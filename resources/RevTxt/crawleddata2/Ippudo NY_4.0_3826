This place doesn't need any more raving but I can't help myself. A few friends took me here during my summer trip to NY. The wait was pretty short, and we were later seated in the supposed same spot Scarlett Johansson ate at (if that matters to you). The whole staff is friendly and greets you on your way in, and the menu is just as exciting. The ramen was top notch, and for what really counts, the dessert is amazing! We ordered the green tea ice cream with mascarpone cheese and pistachios. Sounds simple, and something not exactly out of the ordinary, but it was to die for! I came home to CA a week later trying to mimic it, wasn't the exacts but still so so good. I look forward to my visit back to NY which will obviously include a trip to Ippudo.

I have long wanted to try this Japanese ramen restaurant and finally was able to stop by for a visit. Like many ramen places, the line was out of this world, but as a single diner I was fortunate to grab a seat at the large communal table as soon as I arrived. The venue was larger than expected. It encompassed a wait area, an open kitchen, and several large tables surrounded by booths that reached from one wall to another. The decor was unlike many dark and eclectic ramen places I know, it was rather trendy, hipsterish, and accompanied by servers and ramen chefs who were oddly not Japanese. I started off with the Tako Wasabi ($5) that came in a small cup filled with chopped raw baby octopus served with a smudge of wasabi, salty mustard, a slice of lemon, and mint leaf. Serving was small, but the Tako Wasabi had great texture as the wasabi flavor was sharp but pleasant to complement the subtle salty lemony minty flavors in every bite. I recommend it. My ramen, Akamaru Modern ($15), consisted of tonkotsu broth, umami dama miso paste, pork chasiu, cabbage, sesame kikurage mushrooms, scallions, and garlic oil. The broth had decent flavor with enough lift coming from the cabbage and scallions, but the deep tonkotsu flavor did not render the savory creamy marble broth that I was searching for. I was hoping that the toppings could supplant the lack of depth in the broth, but the added soft-boiled egg ($2) did not have enough seasoning and the charsiu was cut rather small for the price. Service was hands-off and brief. For $17, I was expecting a lot more than what I would get from cheaper and better places such as Tsujita, Santouka, Daikokuya, Robata Jinya, and Totto Ramen. It was overall still a decent meal but the outrageous cost brought the rating down to a 3 star rating. I will be sticking to Totto Ramen on my next trip to NYC.

These 4 stars will not be going toward their ramen. If I were to pass out some stars for their noodles, I'd probably give about... 2 (meh. I've experienced better), because I like my mom's ramen better. This place is very, very hyped, but with good reason. The decor is nice and trendy, people are very friendly here, and they have an interesting concept to most people. ÊAlso, they have these little "community" tables where you will sit next to random people, and I like that. It makes eating alone less awkward. But there are still other tables where you can eat with your party alone. The Miso Ramen, to me, is a lot better than the Akamaru Modern (which was a bit too salty and meaty for my taste). ÊI usually add a boiled egg and bamboo shoots to kick up the flavor a notch. Tasty, yes. Mind blowing? No. The broth was great, but the noodles left something to be desired. Of course, it's all about personal taste. I just happen to like my noodles a bit more soft. Still, looking around, people were slurping up the last bits and pieces of their meal so that speaks volumes. Next time I come, I want to order the black squid ink cold noodles... sounds intriguing. Their octopus salad is pretty good as well. It wasn't too slimy, and the wasabi added a nice kick. Looks like a small bowl, but the portion was perfect. Anyway, the 4 stars is for their PORK BUNS. Omg, so freaking good. Now I'm sure if you wanted to, you could study the anatomy of them and make it at home, but who wants to do that anyway? At Ippudo, it's moist, not too salty, and the perfect ratio of bun to pork. I think it's worth going here for the buns alone. GET THESE! Yes, the wait can be long... but what I do is go in person (they do not take phone reservations), put my name down, and go walk around somewhere or go home until they call. I will say on most weekdays, in the morning/afternoon, the wait is only about 25-30 minutes. Definitely check this place out, just to say you've been here. Curiosity is really what compelled me to come!

Five star ramen. Amazing broth and flavor!!!!!! On the pricey side ($15 a bowl, and $13+ appetizers)... super crowded and the lines are long. I suggest making reservations or putting your name down and getting dessert somewhere else first (which I did). Well worth the wait, but the food is amazing and the service is fast! I ordered the Akamaru Modern. DELISH. We also ordered the tiger shrimp but found that the portions were itty bitty for the big price tag.

The first time I went here, I went with 8 friends for a late lunch. ÊNeedless to say, I was a tad annoyed at first since the wait was almost two hours. ÊI thought to myself, this place BETTER BE WORTH IT, especially since I'm not that much of a ramen person. ÊLong story short, I inhaled my meal and was a new-found fanatic: The Akamaru Modern Ê Ê$14 The original silky "Tonkotsu" (pork) soup noodles topped with Ippudo's secret "Umami Dama" miso paste, pork chashu, cabbage, sesame kikurage mushrooms, scallions, and fragrant garlic oil The second time around, I went here solo dojo. ÊEven going here alone, I had to wait 20 minutes. ÊNo biggie. ÊI was seated in a community table as the odd wo-man out since everyone sitting were paired up. ÊAlthough I ate alone, I ordered for 2 like a heifer: Hirata Buns (2 pieces) ÊPork Ê$9 Steamed buns filled with your choice of either pork, chicken, or eggplant & eringi mushrooms served with Ippudo's original spicy buns sauce Karaka Men Ê Ê$16 The original silky "Tonkotsu" (pork) noodle soup with Ippudo's special blend of hot spices, topped with pork chashu, sesame kikurage mushrooms, cabbage, onion, minced pork, and scallions I tried to be "skinny" and eat just one Hirata bun and half my ramen with the hopes to eat the other half when I get home. ÊHowever, the waitress informed me that they do not give any take-out boxes for those that eat in. ÊReally? ÊAlthough I pretended to be upset by that, I was secretly excited to eat the other half since "I didn't want it to go to waste." ÊI absolutely adore this place and I HIGHLY recommend no matter what ramen you desire, all of which are equally amazing, do not forget to order the HIRATA BUNS with your order!!!!! Ê You can thank me later.

The priciest ramen I've ever eaten, but the quality & taste almost makes it worth the price tag. It was pretty rich as well, so I don't see myself coming here too often. However, I was still salivating and reminiscing the complex broth days and days afterwards, and THAT'S when I know something worthwhile crossed my palate. We came here Friday lunch, around 1pm, and waited about 20minutes for a party of 6. Not too bad compared to other people's experience. I got the akamaru spicy ramen with an onsen tamago (poached egg) on top, and it really was a bowl of idealized ramen you would have in a perfect world. The broth is complex, and the red miso that came with the ramen added another dimension of flavor, kind of like a symphony on your tongue. Although the noodles aren't exactly traditional ramen noodles, they are al-dente and the perfect texture to complement the broth. And the pork buns...did not blow me out of the water. I would suggest saving stomach space for the ramen and really savor the broth. With that said, eliminate your perception of how ramen = cheap low quality eat for poor students, save up some cash, and try this place.

My favorite ramen restaurant. Arrived at 11:10am on a Thursday. No wait. Karaka Men - meaty and flavorful. it reminded me of noodles my grandma used to make :) Wasabi Shoyu Ramen - this was all right. This portion seemed smaller than the others. Shiromaru Hakata Classic - delicious Tori Ramen - Lighter flavor than the others. Yamitsuki Goma Kyuri - sooo delicious.

Ippudo is that one restaurant that has been on my to try list for years, but each time I pass by there are dozens of people loitering in the front which instantly translates to ridiculously long aggravating wait. Well finally one day my boyfriend and I were by union square early in the morning and right around 11:30 am we decided to give this place a try. Our wait time was an accurate 10 minutes told to us by the host. Upon entering the ramen dojo our host thanked us for waiting and walked us through this black hall, we all paused, he looked around, cleared his throat and recited something in Japanese. Whoa was not expecting that, it was awesome! My boyfriend ordered the black squid ink cold noodles (a special), and I had the famous modern akura ramen and a yellow tail sashimi to start. His squid noodles were divine, I loved it, the presentation and the quality of taste was very good. My ramen was okay, yes I ate all of it, but it was not the best bowl of ramen I've had in my life. Something tells me that I should have gone with any of the other ramen dishes besides the modern akura because it had these thin non traditional ramen noodles which were disappointing. However the flavor of the broth was tasty. If the service and energy of the chefs were not positive and high, and if the decor wasn't so nice I would give it a three star rating, but I never had to ask for more water or wonder how clean this place was. I would never wait to eat here for more than 10 minutes, that is just ludicrous, the food is just not worth it... well I wouldn't wait anywhere for more than 10 minutes that's just a waste of time. Side note: communal tables or bar seating, we had the bar seating which was nice because we got to see all the appetizers being made such as the pork belly buns and fried green hot peppers.

Before coming to NY this place was recommended by many friends. ÊSo first stop after landing my gf and I took the subway here...we got there a bit early since they opened at 11am so we walked around a bit before heading back. ÊGood thing we walked back about 10 minutes before they open because sure enough a few minutes after people starting to come and the line got long. ÊLuckily, we were first in line so we were promptly seated when they opened their doors. Ê The ramen was absolute delish but their pork buns were amazing. ÊIt was amazing to see how fast they were able to turn over the tables to accommodate all their waiting customers! A definite must if you are making a trip out there!

ÊService is quick and there's always someone strolling along to pour more water, take away dishes, etc. My friends and I came here TWICE one weekend in NY. ÊWe'd go around late lunchtime to beat the crowd. ÊIt only ever took us 15 mins-25 mins to get a table.

Really excellent ramen. I ordered the dish with miso and the extra garlic and boy it was mighty tasty! I also give credit to the presentation; yes, it's a bowl of noodles and soup, but the way the toppings are laid out does make a difference; it doesn't just look like a country stew. It's served before you rather well, in fact. Do note: the wait is can be pretty monstrous like other Yelpers have mentioned. My family and I got there about 20 min before the place opened and waited yet another 30 min to get a table. Don't come absolutely starving! You may have to wait to satisfy that craving. Being from the west coast, ramen is pretty common and fairly consistently good; the reason I'm taking a star off is because of the price. I get that renting a place in Ippudo's location is expensive, but $15 for a bowl of noodles? A bit steep. I can usually get a bowl just as big and equally as good for $7 here. If you've never had ramen (that instant stuff does NOT count!), and you have a chance to try it here, it will do ramen justice!

One star for the matre d at the front. Initially I wrote a book about how angry and frustrated by an unacceptably unprofessional front person was but exceeding Yelp's maximum 5001 words stopped me. Tip: If you are more than 2 people, DO NOT WAIT!! The front only gives tables or counter seating to group of "2". How I know this? After about 2 hours wait, a couple front of us got in. When this couple came out, I grabbed them and took them to the front and confronted about this situation and this is what I was told. "They are a group of 2 and you are 4!!" I want Ippudo to stop hiring unprofessionally disorganized front person or simply use any reservation services site like OpenTable. It should easily solve this problem. Takashi BBQ on Hudson has a nice reservation service on their site and it's very efficient. Dear Ippudo, Please stop using your customer's agonies for your benefit anymore. Your selfish tactics worked. Your reviews in Yelp is reached to 3788 with 4 stars now. No need to crowd the front area and have a very long line outside anymore to the world to know you are hot. You have succeded to establish your devoted customers. I hope your new location, in front of WJ hotel, was to be opened in February this year . Ippudo NY Genral Manager, Shimazu, Tomoaki, and a head chef are video taping and talking about layout of the new space (in Japanese) at 321 West 51st Street in the old Rene Pujol space, will eliminate this mess. I am sure the space has been beautifully renovated by now. http://www.youtube.com/wÉ

A different style of ramen. Last meal in NYC, and while it was good, in all honesty, not as good compared to the other meals I had in the city. My friend has been hyping up this place the entire weekend, so it could very well be that it was totally overhyped, and thus I came in with the highest of expectations. Pork bun appetizer: DELICIOUS. Make sure to order it, and have the waiter cut them in half. We had a party of 4, so having the two pork buns and splitting them allowed everyone to have a piece. Ramen: We ordered the Akamaru Modern, one of the two most popular dishes there. In all honesty, it was okay--I think Toki Underground in DC has better ramen. However, I will acknowledge the fact that we ordered one bowl to be shared among 3 girls (we really weren't hungry), and the extra bowl of noodels we had probably thew off the ratio of soup to noodles. The meal was pretty decent price in comparison to New York. If you have the time go, but if you just have just a weekend, I would not make it a top priority on your food bucket list. Also, sidenote: Make sure to get there right when it opens at 5 PM, because the line is ridiculously long, and no reservations are allowed.

Fall for the hype. Fall hard. Fall faster than you'd fall in love looking at a photo of me at 3AM after 4 cocktails. Yes, fall for Ippudo Ramen, arguably the finest Japanese noodles in America. If a samurai from Japan could choose his last meal, he'd visit Ippudo and then give up the warrior lifestyle in order to eat ramen til the ends of his days. The lines, we were told, were an hour long at peak time and worth every second to wait, especially in East Village NYC where you can explore the neighborhoods for centuries at a time. We decided to go early (530pm) and there was no line luckily. The service was excellent and recommended the A-something modern ramen and the K-something spicy. Reviews online and from friends check-ins all said "get the pork buns." Pork buns you say? I have them all the time in the Bay Area. 2 for $1! Ippudo charges $9 for 2? This better be remarkable. It was worth $18 (figuratively speaking)! The pork belly melted in your mouth. The outside bun was incredible in softness. Most (cheaper) places have it soggy or too chewy, like beef jerky. Get it! The Akahiro (sp?) modern ramen wasn't bad at all. You could tell the broth was high quality and had a mix of ingredients even Sherlock Holmes couldn't figure out. It's worth getting if you like the regular (not too salty, not too sweet) ramen taste. But the beast of a dish, the creme de la creme, the king of the ramen mountain - K-something spicy. For $15 a ramen, it's worth double that in flavor and satisfaction. It's a spicy ramen that somehow blends a sweet creme to it. It's incredible. Anybody can make a spicy ramen. I could probably make you one with a 99 cent cup of noodles and some jalapenos and stolen peppers from the pizza chain down the street. But to make it spicy and creamy at the same time, heaven. $50 after tip and tax for 2 people, when I am back in NYC I will be going back without a doubt. Maybe even twice for the spicy creamy ramen.

Food so good, it catapulted me out of a grumpy, unjustifiable funk. Even though it's big, noisy, and crowded. That is a pretty impressive achievement. You all know about the ramen. It's awesome. But, man, we got this tofu dish. Wow. I think it was the bakuretsu tofu (had to look back at the menu online). It was one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten, and I have eaten many delicious things. It was kind of like soon dubu, but not. The flavors...aaugh. I am doing the worst job describing this dish. I'm sorry. It is inexplicable. You just have to get it. And the shishito peppers. And the ramen. Just get everything, ok?

A buddy of mine brought me here, my first ramen experience and it was f-ingtastic lol Who knew ramen could be so good! We went for a somewhat late lunch so the wait wasn't terrible maybe 30 min if I remember correctly. However in the time we were waiting I could easily see how bad it could get. Since it was my first time I had to try some apps along with the ramen. We had gotten the fried chicken wings and the pork buns. Chicken wings were good but the pork bun was AMAZING! haha ÊI got my ramen with an egg as well as the extra spicy oil and well there isn't much to say other than it was heavenly till the very last slurp! Although a bit pricey compared to others I still think this place is worth every penny. As for the wait I find the wait to be the same at all the popular ramen spots, an hr minimum during peak hours.

Ippudo was definitely one of the highlights of our vacay in NYC as far as food is concerned. ÊIn fact, I liked it so much that I bought a t-shirt. :) At 3pm on a weekday afternoon, we waited 15 minutes for a table. ÊIt definitely pays to go during off peak hours. We asked the waiter what the two more popular ramen bowls were and ordered it - the Shiromaru Hakata Classic and the Akamaru Modern. ÊBoth were excellent, and if we had to choose between the two, the hubby and I both agree that the Akamaru Modern was better. ÊIt must be their secret "Umami Dama" miso paste - not sure what's in it besides miso, but it takes the Tonkatsu broth to another level. ÊWow. We had to order the pork buns since everyone raves about it, and those did not disappoint at all. Ê Ippudo is a must-try for ramen enthusiasts.

I'm giving this place 3.5 stars for the ramen and 2 stars for the service -- the overall experience was the latter. The rest of this review will focus on how elite and utterly annoying their reservation system is. Here is what you can and cannot do: - You can make a reservation ONLY if it is in person and the day of. You must physically go to the restaurant and put your name on a waiting list. I went at 10:30AM to reserve for dinner and there was already one other person on the list. - There cannot be any add on's (this is understandable). - All members of the party must be present before you can be seated. - You lose your table even if one person is more than 15 minutes late. - If said late member is late (we sat without her, thinking she was a no-show, but wound up coming anyway), she cannot order from the menu and must watch the rest of us eat. No appetizers either. - No orders to go because the chefs are very "particular" about the ramen experience. A lot of restaurants do this, but most restaurants do not enforce ALL these rules. Ippudo is no joke. The manager stood next to our table and made sure our tardy friend did not order anything. The ramen was great, but I don't believe in giving my business to places that do not appreciate its customers. I don't care if you're an establishment that sells dollar tacos or a $17 bowl of ramen, learn some manners!

As promised, I came back to Ippudo the moment I came back to NY. After years away and only a faint memory of how Ippudo blew my ramen-novice mind, I was excited to see how it kept up with time... There was an unfortunate 1-hr wait when we came around 7pm... so we hung out at a boba shop a few blocks down before coming back to wait for our names to be called. **The Hirata Pork Buns**4-stars** Good and spicy, and extra fatty! Best I've ever had? Prob not, but still good. **The Akamaru Modern**4-stars** Broth was as drool-worthy as I remembered! It is similar to NorCal's Ramen Dojo - Spicy Pork Bone... but better! The thin noodles weren't to my preference (after 2yrs of hunting out ramen shops post-Ippudo)... I prefer a doughy egg-ier fatter noodle with more chew. The chashu pork that came standard was also not as flavorful or tender as I'd hope... I now prefer LA's Santouka's chashu *drool*. But the broth all but makes up for it. **The Hakata Classic Ramen**3-stars** Broth reminded me of LA's Shin Sen Gumi/Daikokuya; its not as flavorful as the Akamaru broth... Overall, A-OK. In the end, Ippudo still churns out what is a better than good bowl of ramen in my opinion... and provides for a great all-around dining establishment, minus the wait. Whether it is the best bowl of ramen churned out in the US is probably debatable - Shin Sen Gumi, Santouka, and Ramen Dojo are close up there in my eyes... but I'd give Ippudo's Akamaru Modern broth a good 5-stars - best of all ramen shops fore mentioned. If only their noodles and chashu could fare as well. NOTE TO SELF: Try NY's Totto Ramen.

I don't get this place. 1. Do not come here if you are starving. Come here at least an hour before you're hungry because you are for sure definitely most positively going to wait in line. 2. Prepared to be wildly disappointed because you will not be eating world class ramen noodles at this joint. 3. There are much better pork buns (taste, texture, presentation) a few blocks away. 4. Why is it so crowded? The dining area is uncomfortably cramped and noisy, and the waiters are inattentive because they seem overworked and serving too many tables at once. 5. Their soup broth is worth waiting for, but when you only got the broth going for you, is it really all worth it? Thanks, but I think I will continue geting my ramen and pork buns somewhere else in the neighborhood.

Ippudo NY is a MUST GO when visiting NYC. Hands down the best ramen and pork buns ive ever had. The place is super super cute and spacious. love the way they decided to design it. Usually theres a wait but we went on a Thursday around 1pm and waited only 10 minutes. Akamaru Modern ramen ($14) with extra pork belly ($4): 5 stars!! 2 pieces of pork buns ($9): 5 stars!! soooo delicious.. i was saying "oh my god" green tea creme brulee topped with green tea gelato ($8): 3 1/2 stars, nothing out of the ordinary. only ordered it because yelp seemed to like it. i would seriously come back here weekly if i lived in New York. Its pricey but the food seriously makes up for it.

Ahh- finally after hearing about Ippudo for years, I was able to give it a try. The wait is seriously ridiculous... I came once on a Wednesday night at 10pm, and the wait was 45 min. Seriously?? Luckily, this time around I had a friend handle all of that jazz... Anyway, Ippudo is very good. I had the pork buns for appetizer which were really good. Pork buns are like NYC's thing, and Ippudo does them really well. I can't say it is the best I've ever had, but among them. Ippudo's ramen is very very good. I got the standard pork one and what I noticed was that Ippudo doesn't use like the normal ramen noodles but rather just uses skinny noodles that resemble ramen. This change probably makes the taste difference. Service was fun and helpful, and I like the warm and friendly atmosphere in Ippudo. It's definitely a fun place for a group of people. Anyway, I'm going to conclude this review by saying that I think the ceiling for improvement in ramen is relatively low so I didn't leave the restaurant like a changed person or anything. Regardless, do give this place a try- it's very good (just find a well-connected friend or go at some odd time so you don't have to wait that long).

IF YOU ARE IN EAST VILLAGE AND YOU ARE HUNGRY YOU NEED TO GO HERE. Seriously, make an effort to go. I eat a lot of ramen. A LOT. And Ippudo is fucking fantastic. Five years ago Ippudo was actually the first ramen I ever had and I've never been the same since. This past visit was the first time I came for lunch. We got there around 3, which was magical because it was the first time I've been to Ippudo and was immediately seated. If you are planning on going during a normal meal time, know that you're going to have to wait at least 45 mins. I recommend you go a bit later. Their lunch menu ends at 3:30pm and they have a lunch set deal. We ordered the lunch set with Akamaru Modern ramen, roast pork over rice, and a mini salad ($17). SO DELICIOUS. The akamaru broth is a must at Ippudo. The roast pork over rice isn't just meat and rice - there is a tasty sauce mixed in as well as some chives. Even the salad dressing was better than normal Japanese salad dressing!

I know everybody and their grandmother has been here at least once, so it was a long time coming for me to review them. Actually I was hesitant cause I know most of the soup is pork based. ÊSo that's not really a veggie hot spot. ÊBut I found they have a miso broth soup, so I tried that. ÊIt was good though the mushrooms are marinated... I probably wouldn't order it again honestly. ÊI don't eat meat. That said the apps were great, from the mixed green salad with shrimp to the Yamitsuki Goma Kyuri which is cucumber and a delicious dressing on top. ÊAll told a fun experience.

Did you know that I walked by here the other night, and no-joke - there was a line out the door and all the way to the giant intersection a block away. ÊCome on - what are you people even waiting for? There are a half dozen small, dirty, CHEAP, hole-in-the-wall ramen bars less than as many blocks away serving ramen that's orders of magnitude more delicious than what Ippudo will happily charge you $20 for. Ê You know, this is your basic supply/demand at work. ÊBECAUSE you wait in line for hours to get expensive, mediocre ramen, Ippudo can charge an arm and a leg for mediocre ramen. ÊWe've created a monster, perhaps. ÊUnfortunately, it's like voting: mine alone doesn't matter, and nothing short of a mass-exodus will bring this food-relationship back to parity. So, first thing: let's talk ramen. ÊSure, the general, base ramen costs around $15 or so....more expensive than other places but not egregious. ÊHowever, if you want basically ANYTHING in your bowl, it's an extra $2-3 per item. ÊThat adds up quickly. ÊWhat I noticed was that the broth, itself, was a bit bland, so we splurged extra for the pork belly and some other items, which made the bowl too rich to consume. ÊCan't win, i suppose. ÊPerhaps if you go this route and "build" your perfect bowl, go easy on the add-ins. Êyour belly and wallet will thank you. So what, then, are you paying for? ÊWell the ambience, My Pretty. ÊEvery dark, classy, shi-shi atmosphere comes with a pricetag. ÊPersonally, I don't love the idea of eating ramen at a fancy-looking restaurant (regardless of how laid-back they try to make their classy-ness look), because ramen should be consumed on a stool, at a counter, next to a vat of boiling water and noodles, as the steam fogs up your glasses and you wonder if that A-grade health rating posted on the window was earned or purchased. ÊYou know, as God intended. ÊHowever, the team at Ippudo likely worked very hard to create the dark, sexy, ramen den you will be eating your noodles in. Ê Saving grace? Always. ÊThough there is a lot about Ippudo that I do not like, they did give me one wonderful, precious thing very dear to my heart: ÊThey introduced me to unfiltered sake. And I've never gone back since. ÊSeriously - you want the best deal in this joint? Get a large carafe of unfiltered sake - guaranteed to get you and your date (even if he's a big man) a little tipsy for the bargain price of $18. Why? 1. it's just tastier and more interesting than regular sake 2. you can actually get nearly the same deal if you bought it at the liquor store and consumed it at home, which is basically unheard of when you're buying drinks at a restaurant. ÊGood value? Check. Done.

*********************** 753 Ê************************* Ê Ê Ê ÊLong line outside of this Ippudo ramen shop. Think of Orenchi here in Santa Clara, beside ramen, they offer appertizers and desserts as well. Appetizers worth to try it: Tako Wasabi Ê- Raw baby octopus in fresh chopped wasabi sauce Shishito - Flash-fried Japanese peppers with yuzu salt - I love this. Hirata Buns (2 pieces) ÊSteamed buns filled with your choice of pork or chicken, served with Ippudo's original spicy buns sauce - Try it! - Karaka Men - The original "Tonkotsu" noodle soup with Ippudo's special blend of hot spices, topped with pork chashu, sesame kikurage mushrooms, cabbage, onion, minced pork, and scallions - for a kick, order this. Tori Ramen Ê- Ippudo's "Chintan" clear chicken, fish and pork noodle soup topped with pork loin chashu, memma, kaiware radish, naruto, shiso leaf, and daikon radish & daikon - this is pretty good. For extra Ramen Toppings: Nitamago ÊSeasoned soft boiled egg Onsen Tamago ÊPoached egg Ê Karashi Takana ÊLeaf mustard Menma ÊSeasoned bamboo shoots Ê Kakuni ÊBraised pork belly Ê Chashu Pork Bakudan ÊIppudo original spicy paste Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê They also serve White Bordeaux here & Red Bordeaux by the glass $18, really? Ê Ê Ê Ê The place is nice, I love the wooden table, quick service, but really rushing you out. Come with a friend or 2 is better, because you can share food. No TO GO box offers. Expect to wait up to an hour for lunch and more during dinner hour. And if you are willing to share table with others, much faster! Good ramen, good broth.

Ippudo has over 40 locations in Japan and a few others in other countries, but it is exciting to see that there is an location in the States, where high-end ramen can be quite difficult to find. This definitely isnt your 35 cent instant ramen. Having lived in Japan, I often miss the experience of sitting in a ramen shop with a bowl of hot noodles... So, Im usually down for any ramen experience. But, typically, the ramen you get in the US is average and not at the level of most of these shops in Japan. Ippudo bring truly high end ramen to the States in trendy way while still keeping the authenticity of the dishes. Based in Fukuoka, you would imagine Ippudo has some deliciously rich broths--and they deliver. Hakata style ramen is my personal favorite because of the flavorful pork broths and texture of the noodles. Even though it may seem like the touristy option (especially after being on the Food Network's "Best Thing I Ever Ate"), but the Akamaru modern definitely gives you the experience of Fukuoka with a bit of twist. I think the secret miso paste is a huge win in this dish. The miso ramen is also an excellent option for the ramen novice. Pros: Best ramen Ive had in the US, lively interior, great service, convenient location accessible from Astor Place Station Cons: Ramen is pricey here (can run up to $17 per bowl), they dont take reservations and there is ALWAYS a line it seems

wah wah wah. why is ramen is expensive here? Because it's good and it's the best. Why do women buy expensive designer bags/clothes, when they can buy cheaper products? Obviously, because it's the best. Ippudo, is hands down the best ramen. You can't beat the Akamaru Modern. Yes the wait sucks and yes the ramen is expensive. ÊThe food is worth it here, and you can just chill at the bar while you wait anyway. Obviously it's best if you're here only with 1 person. The more people you have in your party, the harder and longer it is to get seated. You can't go wrong with the soft pillowy pork buns here as an app. The Akamaru Modern is the best ramen in Êthe city. Okay granted i haven't tried Totto Ramen or Minca, but i have tried Kambi which is supposed to be the same as Minca. Totto is chicken broth based, while the Akamaru Modern is pork based, so you can't compare the two. The broth is seasoned to perfection. It is not too salty like some other ramen broths. The noodles are thin and cooked to perfection. Some people like the thicker yellowish noodles, but i like these thin white noodles. ÊI love the soft pillowy fatty pork thats in it. Yes i wish there was more, Yes i wish there was an egg, but hey you can add it in, and they cook the egg to perfection to a perfect soft boiled. FYI don't finish the broth...save some for some kae dama!...yes an extra order of noodles that they will pour into your bowl so you can slurp up some seconds for a fraction of the price...boooyahhhh

I am a ramen addict and ippudo definitely fuels my addiction. The ramen here is amazing from the broth to the noodles to the toppings. I usually get the Karaka miso ramen which is flawless. But I've tried the other choices and they are all delicious. When you come here you must get the pork belly buns. Don't questions me just do it! If there's a long wait grab a beer and order some of these buns at the bar as a pre-meal teaser. You can thank me later. So why only 4 stars? The hostesses here permanently have prickly sticks up their buttholes. Some customer service would be nice. You are not doing us a favor by putting our name on the list, we are doing the restaurant a favor by bringing in our business. Also, I wish the ramen came with more toppings instead of having to order them as add ons.

I'd had Ippudo bookmarked with the note "best pork buns per Wendy at NAOE" for well over a year before finally making it in. ÊWith my pork-and-ramen-loving brother in tow, we headed over to Ippudo for lunch for a very non-traditional Independence Day meal. Even though it was a holiday, Ippudo was hoppin'. ÊWe were told there'd be a 20-30 minute wait, but were seated in under 10 minutes. ÊNeither of us were starving, so we opted to share the pork buns and the Akamaru Modern ramen, topped with more delicious pork belly, and it ended up being the perfect amount of food. The pork buns arrived at our table almost immediately. ÊThe buns themselves were pillowy, stuffed with a tender piece of pork belly, a piece of lettuce, and the "special sauce." ÊIn a word, they were awesome. ÊDefinitely a must-order for any fan of buns, pork, or a combination of the two. The ramen was equally delicious. ÊA simmering bowl chock-full of noodles, pork loin, pork belly, a dollop of spicy sauce and that amazing broth. ÊA winner with every slurp. ÊI love that Ippudo has the option of adding a second portion of noodles to your ramen in the event you need more - we didn't take advantage, but it's great for hungrier diners. The prices were reasonable, and we left feeling sated, but not overly stuffed. ÊI'll definitely be hitting Ippudo for future pork bun and ramen cravings when in NYC!

One of my favorite places in NYC. Definitely worth the wait every time! Somehow, by the grace of God, we got a table for 4 on a Friday night at 7pm without a wait. Unreal! That is definitely not normal (I have gotten there before 6pm on a weekend and still waiting almost 2 hrs). ÊThere is an Irish bar around the street that you can go to if you want to wait. Anyway, the food is great. The pork buns are AMAZING, the samurai ribs are good, and all the ramen noodles are delicious. ÊI have had the Miso Ramen and Akamaru Modern ramen - both very tasty and not too salty, which ramen noodles tend to be.

Whenever I visit NY I will always leave a meal slot to come to Ippudo for their ramen. Usually it's a really long wait, but it's well worth it. Luckily, the last time I was here (after not 1, not 2, not 3, but FOUR unclaimed tables of 2 from the list) we got lucky and only had to wait about 20 minutes. So far my favorite is the Akamaru Modern. Everything on it's own is delicious, and everything together so well. It's a symphony in my mouth. Yum. The broth is just so flavorful and rich and the noodles has just enough bite to them. We also recently just tried the Hirata Buns (pork), and they were really really good also. If you enjoy ramen, it'd be worth visiting Ippudo.

Arriving just before 11am, we were able to skip the line, and had some delicious ramen at this popular NY ramen spot. With a clean, modern black and white interior, jazz music plays in the background which sets the tone for a carefree, relaxing meal. Highly recommended by reviews and friends, we ordered the Akamaru Modern Ramen. The 'original' Tonkotsu soup noodles with Ippudo's secret "Umami Dama" miso paste, pork chashu, cabbage, sesame kikurage mushrooms, scallions, and fragrant garlic oil. Secret miso paste?! Now that has got to be good. And it was. The soup was flavourful yet not too salty. The noodles were less chewy than what I'm normally used to, and the other ingredients were all delicately prepared. This was a complex bowl of soup noodles. We also ordered the pork Hirata Buns. Soft slightly sweet steamed buns filled with tender pork with Ippudo's original spicy buns sauce. Like a delicious mini sandwich, this is a dish that has to be ordered. They have amazing service. Each person had a specific role. Water was refilled almost every time I took a sip. Food was brought by one person, the bill brought by another. It's like they have perfected the most efficient restaurant service ever. Guess a place with 3000+ reviews better have some sort of system implemented. Try to go in the off hours, and you're guaranteed for one of the best ramen experiences ever.

This place really needs no more reviews, but I'm writing this review more for myself than for the people not reading it. I've been here more than a few times. Their Akamaru modern is very tasty. The broth is some of the best I've ever had. However, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that it is roughly 50% MSG. Whenever I drink the broth, which you are suppose to do at a ramen shop, I feel extremely bloated and uncomfortable afterwards. Probably more information than the people of the world wide web needed to know, but like I said, this review is not really for you guys. The pork buns are delicious. Pretty much on par with momofuku. The decor is very modern and clean. The service is warm and friendly. They also have Ginga Kogen Beer here, which is very hard to find in this city. Pretty much a Japanese Hefeweizen. It comes in a nice looking royal blue bottle with some reindeer on it. I'm not going to lie, the prices are pretty high. $16 for a bowl of ramen? I'll give it to them that it's pretty damn good but the prices here make it hard for me to come back regularly. This is really more of a place to which you take out-of-towners. For me, I will probably just stick to my neighborhood ramen joint which is Terakawa on 23rd and Lex. I haven't tried Totto or Minca yet, but will definitely make my way there.

I've been wanting to try Ippudo NY for the longest time and I'm proud to say I finally have. My boyfriend and I arrived around 6PM last weekend and the wait was around an hour to 45 minutes. It sure was a lot of people waiting to be called and seated. When it was our turn, we made our way to the main "dining" area and we were greeted by the chefs and staff of Ippudo. Great and friendly restaurant! We were sat down by the bar where you can see and take a peek at what the chefs are cooking. It was pretty exciting to watch. Any ways, I had the Shiromaru Hakata Classic ramen. My boyfriend had the Akamaru Modern ramen. This was definitely one of the finest and tastiest ramen I've ever had. The broth was so rich and it wasn't over salted or over seasoned. I really enjoyed the texture of the noodles and it was slightly thinner, less spongy like your regular ramen. In addition, I added an extra topping - poached egg which was also a nice texture. Ippudo was a great experience and we sure had a great time . Ippudo, definitely a great place to come for top-notch ramen and an exciting ramen dinner.

Yum. I had the Classic ramen with a side of pork buns. The pork buns were delicious and my ramen was great. The broth was rich with flavor and the noodles were a perfect blend of chewy and soft. The savory cuts of meaty pork and my additional egg only added to the deliciousness of the dish. Bonus, I managed to skip the standard long wait times during Sunday's visit. I dont know if that made the ramen taste any better, but it was a nice surprise that made me very happy.

This place is best to go when they first open or when it's late afternoon.. yes, go at 2 pm. ÊNo wait then... I still love this place. ÊThe broth is amazing in their ramen.. in addition to their ramen noodles. ÊI always go with the classic. ÊI also think their pork buns are delicious!! ÊMaybe not exactly like Momofuku but good...

I am Vietnamese, thus eating pho is my religion, not ramen. I am also no ramen expert, but judging from taste alone, I assure you Ippudo NY will do justice to all of the ordinary ramen you've ever tasted. We visited on a weekday, arrived at 3pm, and still had to wait in line. Who eats at this odd hour? Tourists like me, possibly. The wait was not super crazy, it was about 30 minutes for a party of six. Phew! Their home made noodles were fresh and silky. Flavor of each broth was intense. Meat was flavorful and tender. Our waitress was professional, very friendly, and highly accommodating. Modern decor, delicious food, and exceptional customer service. You can't just miss it if you visit NYC. P.S. Ramen lovers can also purchase their I HEART RAMEN shirt for $25.

Went on a Monday night at 8:15pm. Told the wait was 1-1.5hr and left my number. In 5mins, they texted that a table was ready! I think they say 1-1.5hr wait to give that much time for patrons to dine as it's a small place. But we were lucky ppl left. Kids are welcomed here. They provide kiddie plate settings, and our servers were great! ÊThey didn't complain that our child kept spilling water, but was right there after each spill cleaning it up! They were like the butler in Mr. Deeds! So fast. The food is amazing! I would rate them 5 stars, if the price was a few bucks less per dish. The ramen is not salty at all and you don't get the MSG after taste like other Ramen places, which goes to say that they don't add artificial seasonings to their broth. The portions are pretty big too. It's enough for one sitting. We were so full after ordering appetizers that we didn't do "Kae-Dama" for the extra $2. The pork buns were so good and I enjoyed the Akamaru Modern. Adding the Braised Pork Belly for $4 (2pcs) was worth it. It's so tender and flavorful!

Well worth the wait - especially since my bf and I only waited 5 minutes for a table! Backstory: We placed our names down around 6pm on a Sunday night and were told it would be a 1.5 hour wait. Perfect, since we were planning to eat some seafood at another restaurant and then return to Ippudo for ramen. About 30 minutes later, while we were in the middle of dinner #1, we got a text from Ippudo telling us our table will be ready. Sadly, we had to cancel it... After finishing dinner #1, my bf called Ippudo back and explained the situation. We got placed back on the waitlist, and bumped up to the top! When we arrived back at the restaurant, we were the first people called to be seated. Simply amazing! We both ordered the Akamaru Modern ramen - his with the nitamago (boiled egg), mine with the onsen tamago (poached egg). The tonkotsu broth was deliciously rich, with the secret miso paste adding a subtle spicy flavor. The chashu wasn't the most melt-in-your-mouth I have had, but it was pretty high on my list. Dessert took the form of the matcha brule topped with gelato. The brule was very light, and the top was evenly caramelized. The biggest thing holding me back from a 5-star review is that my bf and I were looking forward to the special octopus sashimi appetizer. Unfortunately, they were out of it - at 7pm! That is way to early to run out of ingredients for anything on your "special" menu. On the plus side, the waiting/bar area is nicely separated from the dining area, so you can enjoy your meal without the noise and crowd hovering over you. Also, unlike many restaurants, Ippudo doesn't try to cram people into the dining space. A rare experience in NYC.

I convinced my friend to stick out the 30 min wait for a weekday lunch at Ippudo, but we came out feeling pretty apathetic about the food and a little mournful of our lost money. The ramen especially was VERY disappointing (we split the Modern), especially considering the price tag. At $15-$20 bucks a bowl, I would have expected more than (what tasted like) Barilla thin spaghetti, three tiny pieces of cabbage, some sprinklings of seaweed, and two pieces of pork. The broth was good in the "this is kinda salty but it's comforting" way, not in the "wow these flavors seem so complex and subtle!" way. We also got one order of appetizer pork buns each. These were delish. The pork melts in your mouth (and rightfully so, as the cuts are 40% fat), and has a really strong flavor. However, they add dollops of mayo to the buns..which tastes good, but at the same time, I was thinking ...really? mayo? So again, no real complexity or finesse. (and honestly, does anything NOT taste delish with mayo on it? ..) The total bill came to 47 bucks at the end of the meal (keep in mind we SPLIT an entree). Neither of us felt the food justified the price - it was like an asian twist on cheap bar food, but made expensive with fancy plating and an over-valued sense of self. While the pork was good, it's a common enough dish in asian cuisine- If you go to any legit Chinese restaurant, you can order a plateful of the same pork for half the price. However, Ippudo had good service and a very relaxed atmosphere. We sat at the counter and were pretty entertained by all the Japanese back and forth screaming and watching the 'chefs' work. This is not the place to go for a cozy intimate date as there's barely any private seating (mostly either counter or 'group' tables), but as a casual best friend catch-up locale it worked perfectly. Overall, we don't regret the trip, which is why I gave it 3 stars. It was a fun enough time and we can now check Ippudo off the 'list' and say "yea, we did that." But I wouldn't come here for really stand-out ramen or if you care about value.

I have no idea why I even need to review this joint, but it is purely for the sake of knowing that I have gone and am able to scratch up a brief review over the experience that I had at this way-overYelped joint. The joint is way too Asian. Not in race, but in culture. Everyone partakes in the cheesy show of calling out acknowledgments, whether to fellow employees or customers alike, in unison. On the whole, it was exciting, but I assume it can get old for the regulars. The ramen itself was pretty amazing. Great broth, great meat, great noodles. They even let you create a second helping of noodles for yourself. As expected, they have some ridiculous guidelines, so as to streamline the process for their million eaters a year: no take-out. At nearly $30 a meal for some noodles and a drink, more for the add-on of an appetizer or side or something, I don't know how much I would say this is worth it. Yeah, you are only in NYC once, but with such a food-centric (fusion grub, no less) city, I would much rather shell out dough to tiny little shops for much more fodder. I am a Texan, after all.

1 hr wait on a Friday night, not too bad, but not worth coming back. ÊHonestly, their ramen is pretty good, but not THAT amazing that I would wait an hr again. Tako wasabi here is delicious; very fresh and I love the hint of lemon juice from the thin slice of lemon in the middle. I had the Karaka Men with an extra side of Nitamago. The broth was excellent; just spicy enough and not too salty. The ramen noodles were very good as well (thin and very chewy), but my favorite part was the nitamago; much better than the ones I've had elsewhere. Now, although I liked Ippudo's ramen and tako wassabi, I still don't think it's worth an hr wait and not worth paying $16/bowl. I've had similar ramen elsewhere and only $9-$10. Another difference is that there is usually no wait, and the noodles are a bit thicker, which my husband and I actually prefers anyway. Service was pretty good, water was constantly refilled and everybody was friendly. Yet again, not worth the wait. Anyway, now I can say "been there done that", but I ain't coming back. =P

I had lunch here with a good friend; it was the first time for him, while the third time for me. That lunch turned out to be a great hit, and I succeeded in converting my friend into a ramen fan. We got there at noon, and was told that the wait was going to be 10-15 minutes. After a little wait, we were seated at a common table, brushing elbows with other diners. I think it recreates the typical ramen-shop ambience that one can find in Japan. The greeters were also rather enthusiastic, as they shout "Irrashaimase" everytime someone comes in. My friend had the wasabi shoyu ramen, while I got their special cold squid ink ramen. It was the most amazing thing; awesomely tender melt-in-your-mouth pork loins, soft-boiled egg, and vegetables swimming in the very tasty broth, where one dips the cold squid-ink ramen into before gobbling it up. My friend also loved his selection. So yeah, this ramen place is as good as it gets. One suggestion though, is that I wished they had more than one vegetarian selection. As it was my suggestion to visit this place for lunch, I forgot that my companion was vegetarian; good thing the wasabi shoyu ramen was a big hit as well.

This place deserves 4 stars, but it's overpriced. You'll end up paying around $15-20 for ramen. There was a long wait, probably about an hour. I ordered the pork bun at the bar while waiting for a table. The bun was moist and I liked the flavor of the pork. I got the Hakata ramen with kakuni. It was good, but I don't think it was worth the long wait. Next time I will try Totto Ramen instead.

ÊIt was a lot too for $20. ÊServed in a fashion similar to soba noodles, the squid ink noodles were cold and you would dip them into the broth served on the side. ÊDelicious!

WORST NOODLE PLACE EVER!!!!!!!!! Seriously which noodle place made noodle taste so good. How can line be like 1 hour long on the good side and serve noodle that good. They charge like 15 buck for a bowl of noodle; seriously 15 buck can feed a family in nyc...i am talking about welfare stuff like that. I felt guilty spend that 15 buck to eat there but seriously this guilt is worth it. If you go here, you will understand and felt guilty for the REST OF YOUR LIFE!!!!!

This place's food is SO AMAZING... too bad I came RIGHT after eating a full dinner. We stopped by just because my friends wanted the pork buns... I was skeptical at first, but the PORK BUNS ARE ACTUALLY THE MOST AMAZING THING IN THE WhoLE ENTIRE UNIVERSE!!! (But beware, it's pricy.... Around $4.50 each one) We also had pretty good appetizer (that were good, but pricey...) including Yamitsuki Goma Kyuri (cucumbers with sesame oil sauce)... and I don't remember (we were a little bit intoxicated from the previous restaurant!) My friends ordered Wasabi Shoyu Romen and "Kuro-obi" tsuke-men. No joke, this is one of the best Ramen places in NY. You must experience it once in your life!! Plus, the ambience is GREAT. People are yelling greetings in Japanese when you come in! It's great.

Finally after 2 years made it to Ippudo. ÊIf you don't want much of a wait, go on the 4th of July with 93 degree temps! ÊLots of empty seats at 9pm last night! (Although I hear they are opening another location, so the long waits should end). Was the famed ramen worth the 30 minute wait? ÊI'd say so. Ê Was it as mind-blowing delicious as I had imagined? ÊNope. Loved the greeting when you walk in, the energetic and fast wait staff, the awesome dcor. Didn't love the pork buns. ÊThey are similar to Momofuko's but not as good and certainly nowhere near as tasty as ones I had in Asia (those ruined me for life). Tasted a strange Kraft Miracle Whip type flavor and perhaps mustard in the sauce. ÊThe pork was too fatty and not tender enough. ÊThe bun was good though. ÊNot worth the 8 bucks. The miso and classic ramen - very good and they give you A LOT of noodles. ÊYou can even order extra noodles for $2 if you have left over broth. ÊThis for once was not a problem for me as I found the huge bowl filling enough as is. ÊThe broth had a great flavor - definitely better than the other 2 ramen places I've tried in the city and excellent consistency - silky, not too thin/watery, more thick and very filling. ÊNoodles great texture as well. Add pork belly as a topping for 4 bucks- brings the bowl to almost $20.00. ÊThe pork belly was a total let down- WAY too much fat on it, not the melt-in-your-mouth type or delicious flavor at all. ÊShould have skipped this topping for sure. Overall it was a great meal. ÊI could see how people say it is the best ramen in NYC. ÊBut unfortunately once again - a place that is good but not good enough for me to return to.

I don't get why this place is such a huge deal. First of all, this restaurant fails as a ramen place. It's more like udon. The broth is good but they definitely skimp on the toppings. Pork buns are also average. I'm just saying, for the quality and taste of the dishes the prices and wait time is not even close to worth eating here. Especially since NYC is full of far superior ramen places.

I really don't get the Ippudo hype. I came in for lunch with a cat friend, and I just thought the ramen was okay. I got the Akamaru Modern ramen, and it was decent, but definitely not worth the $15 price tag. I've had better ramen for $5. PASS.

I've been wanting to try Ippudo for so long that when my friend said "let's go," I was all, "lead the way, oh great one." $15 for a bowl of ramen might seem steep (it is) but for the experience and the food, it was really good. I had the miso ramen - I finished most of my soup and the noodles, and I was so full after that I needed to walk home. We did have to wait 40 min for our seats, but I was 20 min late anyway so it wasn't bad. We also ended up asking why all the waiters and the hostess and essentially everybody was yelling, and it as actually a really smart reason. You'll have to go to figure out what it's all about.

Agree with the overall rating of 4 stars. You can enjoy a good bowl of ramen in a trendy/hip environment. ÊHowever, be prepared to pay $15-$17 for a bowl. What stood out for me was the pork buns! YUM :) ÊPretty pricey at 2 for $9 though.

Awesome place. ÊThey have a great reservation system that you can reply to by txt message. ÊWhen I was there, they said the wait was over an hour, but we were seated in about 45mins. ÊOnly downside is the long wait that you must endure if it's a busy night. ÊThis is not the spot if you want ramen ASAP. ÊOrdered the Hirata buns (fancy pork bun) and the Akamaru Modern. ÊIt was sooo good. ÊThe best part of the dining is the fact that you can order another helping of noodle, just say "Kae-Dama" to the waiter and you're golden. ÊThis is perfect when you've slurped the noodles too fast, but have plenty of broth left in your bowl. ÊCome hungry! ÊLooking forward to the next visit.

My friend used to live about a block away from this place and always raved about it, so I finally decided to check it out before moving out of New York (since I've never had "fancy" ramen :D ). I visited on a Wednesday night and was told the wait would be 2 hours. Knowing people would drop, I waited about half an hour and was seated around 10pm. I really dug the atmosphere in the restaurant, the decor was eclectic like the staff, some sort of middle ground between Greenwich Village and the Lower East Side. I was seated at a community table with 4 couples which provided for some entertainment. After reading reviews, I stuck with the basic Akamaru Modern. It was a delicious assortment of flavors and the pork belly was fantastic. My friend and I basically ate in silence as we shoveled soup and noodles into our mouths. I do wish I had added an egg to the dish, which would have made the soup consistency perfect. Definitely recommend this place as a must try ramen experience.

On a beautiful New York Sunday, let us say....RAMEN! That's what I did with my girlfriends yesterday. ÊTried calling ahead to put our name on the waitlist but apparently you can only do this in person. ÊWalked in at 12:15pm. ÊGot an estimate of about a 45min to 1 hour wait. ÊGot a text message 15 minutes later saying our table was ready. As we were being seated at our table we are greeted by all the servers with a smile and a loud, " (Kangei)!" ÊFeels as though they're cheering for you! Ê Servers here are freakn awesome. ÊEfficient. ÊFriendly. ÊKnowledgeable. ÊWe didn't have one designated server. ÊPretty much everyone helped us whether it came to taking our orders, making suggestions, filling our waters, giving us moist towelettes. Ê Ê Hirata Buns ($9 for 2 pieces). ÊSauce has a subtle kick to it. ÊThey generously pack the delicate pillowy bun with two savory thick slices of tender pork and crunchy lettuce. ÊDamn. ÊThose buns were hot. Akamaru Modern ($15). Ê This is the most popular ramen dish on their menu and I can understand why. ÊChewy soft noodles topped with Ippudo's secret "Umami Dama" miso paste, pork chashu, cabage, sesame kikurage mushrooms, scallions, and fragrant garlic oil. ÊLet us all say, "RAMEN!" ÊThe pork literally fell apart and melted in my mouth. ÊThe broth had so many amazing flavors from the garlic to the miso paste. ÊSo many levels of ramen heaven. Not that you'll have any problem finishing these bowls of sinful carbs, but keep in mind that the chef does not allow you to take home leftovers. ÊNo carry out either. Ê It is worth all the hype. ÊGo!

I haven't had the best history with ramen, and not just the instant fried stuff that costs a dime a pop. On a trip to LA I sought out some great authentic ramen but was led astray to a grocery store food court. The food was all right, but it just didn't have that mind blowing flavor I was looking for. In NY though, I think I found it. After being greeted by a chorus of shouts by the staff, our large party was seated fairly quickly (well, thanks to placing dinner reservations earlier that day). Started with a pork bun which was pretty divine - some of the best pork I'd ever had. This made the decision to get pork belly added to my ramen very fortuitous. My Akamaru Modern ramen was thick and rich, and the noodles were cooked perfectly. You can ask for a noodle refill for a couple of bucks, but the soup was so surprisingly filling that I had no need for it. You can add toppings to your soup too. I got egg which was nice and probably contributed to the richness, but the pork belly is a must have. The fattiness dissolves into the broth, and the generous pork offering adds some sweetness and chewiness. Being the only Ippudo location in the US, it was quite the treat to come here. You'll have to budget some time for it (either a short lunch wait, a trip early in the day for a dinner reso, or a long dinner wait), but it was definitely worth it for me.

I love their pork buns aka Hirata Buns. It's so expensive at $9 for 2 pieces but the taste is amazing. It's 2 pieces of steamed bun with sweet amazing marinated pork in between with some scallions. You can order it at the bar along with other appetizers while you wait for your table. The wait is crazy long here. Their ramens are just average to me. Certainly not worth the $14-$15 per dish. I had the Karaka Men and my sister had the Akamaru Modern. We added eggs so it was even more expensive. The ramens were both delicious but I ended up wishing I had just order a pile of pork buns instead and skip the ramen. The service is average. It is a little difficult to find someone because they're all running around. The servers are nice. I will definitely be back again for the pork buns next time I'm in NY.

Never a big fans on ramen, but this one is surely worth to eat. Line was not too long and they notify you even though you are not around. Service was quick, to seat and order. It's more like NY style dining, or more and so bigger city term. You will seat with other people on the same tables and share the table, more like sharing communal table or when you go to sushi bars. Ramen, was good. Worth to get thumbs up. Broth was very flavourful. Only it need lil bit spices or chili flavor to make it complete. They offer squid ink noodle, only sadly the portion is gigantous, otherwise would have tried that one instead.

Food - 10/10 Service - 10/10 Atmosphere - 10/10 Wow my first and only 10/10 place thus far. One of my friends works here so I was immediately seated ahead of the huge line, and subsequently treated like a king. Their Hirata buns are the best buns/baos I've ever had, even beating out Momofuku's. Say Kae-dama to the waitress after you've finished your noodles to get a 2nd helping of noodles to drop into your bowl, so don't drink all your soup too soon! Their Kakuni (braised pork belly) is also incredibly tender and I recommend getting that as an additional topping. Recommend: Hirata Buns, Akamaru Modern (most popular), any of the tartars. Interesting dish: Squid-ink Ramen

I have to say that I was disappointed by the ramen here. Maybe it was all the hype? We went for lunch so we didn't have to wait through the ridiculous line everyone talks about. Service was good. The ramen noodle were a little hard for me and the soup was good, but I've had better.

Maybe NYC is just too far from Japan and the flavors get lost in the distance. We waited an hour for a table at lunch which was not a problem since we snagged a spot by the bar and ordered appetizers and beer. Pork buns, goma kyuri, tako wasabi and grilled shishito peppers with yuzu salt were delicious. The bartender was polite and efficient as we're all the waitstaff. It's sad that it was the ramen which disappointed. I had the akamaru modern which was spicy but didn't have the complex flavor I was expecting. I'm not sure if this is done to suit a more diverse range of palates but I've also been to Ippudo in Hong Kong which was outstanding. Perhaps being located within a noodle culture is a prerequisite for Ippudo having greater success. All in all the appetizers were exceptional but the ramen was disappointing and you certainly shouldn't be going to a ramen-ya for anything but the noodles. ÊFantastic appetizers/sides should be a bonus.

This is my first ramen experience outside of the 10 cent pre-packaged grab at your local grocery store boil and add seasoning packet kind. Needless to say this place is pretty good. It get packed like nobody's business during dinner time so expect a good 1-2 hr wait, or come during off hours. Service is crazy attentive and makes you feel right at home. They are also so attentive as to when you finished your dish and when your drink is getting low. I would say literally 5 seconds after you have finished a server will come and scoop up that dish for u. Something unique that they do is they yell and cheer some gibberish that I can't understand when you walk right in. What the heck are they saying?! I had the infamous Hirata Pork buns and Akamaru Modern Ramen Bowl. $15 is a bit much for a single serving bowl of ramen, but if you're visiting NY once every blue moon it makes for a good experience. The "Umami Dama" miso paste along with the bones they use for the broth makes the soup less watery and brings home flavorful tastes. Downed your noodles in a hurry and still have a good amount of broth left over? They have the option to add in another batch of noodles for u to clean up. I'm hearing Momofoku's pork buns are better, but I'll have to try it out and see for myself. Overall a satisfying experience.

My desire to eat at Ipuddo finally took over and I won! ÊMy fiancee said, "it's very good but, there is a long wait". ÊSo, on a night she is running her Champagning event I stayed in to get over a cold with the thoughts of warm Bombay Sapphire (the six herbs help I promise) and spicy ramen. I had no idea how great this experience would turn out to be! ÊFirst, I asked the hostess her favorite dish on the way to be seated (20 min for one at 7:30) of course the highest price and highest additive was her choice. ÊI stuck with my original plan of the Karaka Men (happened to be her dish of choice) but to add the Bakudan (their original spice) not the Kakuni (pork belly also most expense add in) as recommended. Well, once the food came out in 5 min or less I tried the spice stand alone... ÊPerfect! Êthis will add the flavor I want plus that kick, for that little bit of sweat feeling . ÊI finished the noodles without eating much of the broth in case I was to say, "Kae-dama please". ÊWhich is asking to add another serving of noodles to your dish, only if your broth isn't too low. Yeah, that happened! And I thru the Pork Belly in there because I just eat one F'in amazing dish and my girl isn't here to say I've had enough (best move ever at this place!). ÊSo, not now chief I'm eating in the zone! (to quote my new F'in hair cut). ÊI blissfully, selfishly and shamelessly enjoyed the most amazing ramen dish (or 2, the pork belly was worth it!) that I could have imagined! Ê Yes, the fried steamed bun sliders (pork, chicken or eggplant mushroom) looked great and I'll probably order them when I go there with my girl (AKA: the ration nazi) to pair with my one helping of ramen. ÊAnd this Ramen dish will be...Karaka Men ($16), add Kakuni (pork belly - $4), and Bakudan (awesome spice - $2). Ê And to those that don't like the price...go spend $5 less, eat shitty ramen and complain about it. ÊOr spend that $5 and feel like King Author returning from slaying 2 dragons, getting your brains f'd out by 4 wench's and being full on ramen and drunk on grog!

Came here in September last year during my trip to NY. I've tried quite a few ramen places in the Bay Area but Ippudo, hands down serves the BEST ramen I have ever eaten in my life. I waited 2 hours here but it was all worth it. Their pork belly buns are a must try although they can be a bit expensive. $8 I believe. From what I remember, their bowls were around $15 dollars. ** My girlfriend and I sat at the bar to eat since no tables were available and we didn't mind. I happened to notice that the 3 cooks were checking out my girlfriend and whispering to each other. I whisper to my girlfriend that they were talking about her and while I'm doing this, I am making eye contact with them. I then hear one of them say "I think he heard us" in a soft tone and they all scatter. It was funny at first to witness this but then it got awkward when I had to sit there the whole time and watch them make my food and serve it to me. Good times.

So here's how you get a seat at Ippudo NY: you rush down here straight after work, arrive before the hordes start showing up, put your name down and go for a walk, or something. When you're actually hungry, you come back here and they'll tell you, "You'll be the next table for two." And you wait for like, five minutes or something. I personally found the rushed and crowded atmosphere of the restaurant a little bit too disconcerting and raucous for me to have a truly enjoyable meal. The continual yelling of the service staff might have contributed to the authentic feel of a Japanese restaurant, but all it did was remind me that the seat I just occupied is still warm from the previous ass that was on it. Anyway, I had ramen here and pork buns. Most people have talked about the ramen, so I see no need to delve into it. The pork buns, however, were pretty magical. A must-order appetizer.

This place is HOPPIN'. The vibrant atmosphere, and the greeting chefs and servers bring about a happy, almost exuberant attitude to this ramen shop. My friend and I were seated at the bar and right away ordered our pork ramen with egg, as well as pork buns. The pork buns were amazing! Wow, never in my life have I tried something this good..probably in a long time! I thought it was a very interesting fusion, you had a folded white bun and tucked inside are some meat and veggies. I thought it was the coolest thing ever. It kind of reminded me of those taco buns with duck that you get at traditional Chinese weddings. Next came the ramen....and it was just savory, delicious, and semi-fatty. I absolutely enjoyed every bite of it. The broth was cooked just right, the noodles were cooked to perfection. I could tell this restaurant was going to be my favorite spot to go to whenever I come to NYC. Absolutely enjoyed this place..and definitely coming back for more whenever I stop by NYC again! :)

This is the best ramen places I've ever been to, including a few in Tokyo. I am a ramen aficionado. it is my favorite dish. The diverse elements that go into the complex taste of ramen have to be balanced well; otherwise, the one element that stands out even slightly will overpower and define the entire dish. In most cases, it's the saltiness that is overpowering (ex. Momofuku Ramen). At Ippudo, they have found the right balance between the noodles, soup, and toppings. only downside is that it's so popular that you will always have a wait.

Recently I have visited Ippudo NY again. ÊThe last time I came here a couple years ago, I think I would have rated it higher for whatever reason. Ê As usual, our wait for a party of 4 was about 1-1.5 hours. ÊI didn't think the staff were too friendly- more like hit and miss. ÊIt's almost like "Hi, it's 1.5 hour wait." and they wait for you to either respond with "Yes I'll wait", or "No I'll eat elsewhere". ÊSince I was with another visitor that has never been to Ippudo, I had to say yes and walked across the street and hung out at a bar until the table was ready. The decor is modern, dim light setting, great for a cozy dinner for 2 (in a more open and loud environment), or a huge party of friends or family. ÊThe menu is pretty self explanatory. ÊYou order you choice of ramen, and pay extra for other sides. Despite the cold welcoming, the food itself wasn't bad, Ok the soup was really good. ÊI've only and have always had the Classic noodle + braised pork belly. ÊThe pork belly was extremely tender and fatty. ÊBut $4 for 2 pieces might not be enough for big eaters. What I would say though, is their soup is really amazing. For my taste, I feel that they don't give me enough soup and too much ramen. ÊBut you're talking about someone like me who eats like a bird. I really like the famous Pork Bun aka Hirata Bun as well, and I do highly recommend it. ÊHowever, next time I would ask for the white sauce inside (I'm assuming some sort of mayo?) to be on the side. ÊI felt the sauce was too overpowering and taking away the pork's taste. ÊSince they did get the idea from Peking duck, I wish they can go easy on the BBQ sauce too. ÊIt was really greasy after eating just one, and it was definitely heavy. All in all I really did enjoy my meal. ÊI think paying $20 for a bowl of ramen, I definitely and as usual, have very high expectations. ÊI also think I prefer the chewier ramen versus the ones they have here. ÊI'm not sure if they offer a different kind of ramen or this type is their specialty. ÊIf you do like softer ramen, you'll like this place. This place is a a must try because most people do really like it. ÊFor me though, I think I've had better.

Ippudo is officially number one on my shit list. We were very excited about trying out "NY's best ramen," and made our way out there around 6pm on a Tuesday evening, an hour after they opened, in order to avoid too long of a wait. I ask for a table for three and hostess tells us they're not taking any more names down.... WHAT THE FUCK????? I was in disbelief and asked her to clarify what she meant by that, once again telling me, "we're not taking down anymore names tonight," responding in a very uptight, stuck up manner, with no explanation. Needless to say, I managed to make my way out of the restaurant before I flipped out...... Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I had walked into MASA, and needed to have my personal assistant make reservations for me two weeks in advance. How foolish of me... This is totally unacceptable for a fucken restaurant that serves ramen and I am only left to assume I was discriminated against. I made sure to research whether this is a "normal" thing, to be turned down in such manner here, but came up with nothing. Although they do seem to have a reputation for having rude, stuck-up hostesses... Dear Ippudo, Kiss my black ass. Love, Gino

ORDER THE PORK BUNS first and foremost. Êthey are the BEST pork bun that have ever hit my tastebuds!! Ê AKAMARU MODERN is way better than the classic. Êmainly because it is more flavorful and more garlicky. Êi would have to say that this is my favorite ramen broth of all time next to Ramen Dojo (San Mateo, CA) however, the noodles are terrible! Êthey are small and stringy, not like the thick, chewy ones in california. long wait, fast on the water service

I'm a little torn about this place because the ridiculous long waits really turn me off BUT the food is kinda worth the wait. ÊThe reason why I say kinda is because I'm not a HUGE ramen fan and I hate waiting for anything because I have no patience however, this is one of the best ramen I've had and it definitely deserves the great reviews. ÊThe ramen noodles alone can speak for themselves and the broth whether you like spicy or the regular one is pretty good too. ÊOther than the ramen, they also have delicious pork buns. ÊThe price is a bit high, but when people are waiting to wait 2 hours for your ramen, I guess you can charge the higher price. My biggest turn off with this place is that they don't talk reservations and its really obnoxious because this is a little hole in the way that have 5 seats with a simple staff operating the joint. ÊThis is a huge restaurant for a ramen joint and they are well staffed, with such an establishment, you are literally telling your patron your time is not important to us by refusing to take reservations. ÊIts almost like a big fuck you, we don't care about your business because we are popular enough. That being said my review of course was based on the food as it always it and therefore this place gets a 4. ÊBUT I still wouldn't wait 2 hours during their prime time rush hour. ÊI would go during their off times like super early lunch or late lunch or early dinner.

Umm, kind of overrated for a noodle shop. ÊI mean the soup is flavorful but I can eat the same at my grandma's house minus the annoying shouting and ridiculous line at the front. ÊThis is definitely not a place for people suffering with anxiety. ÊCramped front room filled with annoyed and hungry people who have been waiting over an hour to eat. ÊJust a note for next time, do not bring a hyperactive preschooler. Êlol. The restaurant is a dim chamber, if you are lucky to have a large group you can be seated at the booths. ÊThe food arrived quickly and was piping hot. ÊGood noodles but not sure if it's worth all the trouble. ÊBut definitely go just to say you've been there once.

Okay,this place opens at 5pm so you need to turn off your computer and start queuing up outside now. Seriously, this place is so popular. You don't have to literally stand there for hours but I was at the front of the line at 4.30 and I was one of the first few customers to be served with their really amazing food.. My friend and I had the spicy miso pork with finely chopped cabbage as appetizer. The pork was so flavorful. It was just slightly spicy with a very nice tangy flavor to it. I'm salivating just writing this part of the review. Next, I had the Nakamura (or something like that) Modern ramen. The broth was so amazing. It had a spicy miso paste (which isn't too spicy). Coupled with a thick slice of marinated chasu (pork), the taste was rich enough to feel "homemade." many restaurants struggle at making the broth yummy because they end up adding too much MSG/flavoring but not at Ippudo. I couldn't give it another star because the noodle did not have this "bouncy" (sorry for the lack of better words) texture associated with the best ramen in the world. All in all, I would still come back to Ippudo each time I visit NyC!

Ippudo put Ramen on the map for white people in NYC :) Yesterday was my second time here, first time back in about 2.5 years... The food is still great, it's just a pain to wait. We actually did it right yesterday - showed up at noon, put in our names and came back at 2:00 to be seated right away... I think Totto Ramen (Hell's Kitchen) and Jin (UWS / Harlem) are close seconds and usually only have about a 30 min wait or less depending on the day and time...

I had the original Hakata Ramen with added pork belly. ÊI really like the texture of the noodles, the broth was pretty good, and the pork belly was super fatty (YUM). ÊI really like the fact that they make their own noodles in house. ÊMy friend and I only had to wait for about 10-15 minutes to be seated. ÊI'm not too sure I'd wait 45-60 minutes for a table. Ê I think I've also been spoiled with really really good ramen in LA. ÊThe Torrance/Gardena/DTLA has amazing ramen. ÊIppudo would probably be the only ramen place I'd stick with when I'm back in NY again; that is, if I can get a seat within 15 minutes.

This noodle house isn't what you'd call a hidden gem. EVERYBODY knows about it, so be prepared for a wait. It's worth it though, if you're a fan of ramen. The Hirata Buns (pork buns) were amazing. It inspired me to go home and try to make them myself. After a few failed attempts to get it right, I've resigned myself to just going back. The ramen comes in a wide variety - I have no idea what makes them all different, but the one I had was delicious. I recommend getting the Bakudan spicy paste as an add-in - it was such a game changer I'm never getting ramen here again without it. Also, save some of your broth at the end becuase for $2 you can get a ÊKae-dama - which is a second helping of ramen. They bring it out and plop it right into your left-over broth. Even if you're not that hungry, it's worth it! In conclusion, if you are into high-priced ramen, this is your mecca.

I know my review is only going to get lost in the thousands on here.. So here's the quick rundown: - Believe the hype, believe me. I've tried ramen at many different places and I live 2 blocks from Totto (which, I must say I love too - they're both just different). - Yell "kae-dama" for a refill. Save your broth because for just $2 you can get extra noodles. Mmm. mm.. - Pork buns. Yes, do it. Fluffy white buns with yummy pork. Reminds me of the ones from Momofuku actually.. - Chicken Wings. Perfectly fried in a yummy sauce - kind of black peppery. And no matter what time you come here, expect a ridiculously absurd wait. I've had to wait like an hour plus on a Tuesday at 3pm. I've come at busy nights where they've turned me down to be simply PUT on the waiting list. Damn you..

I'm not sure what I can say that the other 3,000+ people haven't already said. Ippudo is outstanding. If you're a beginner, order the Akamaru Modern. After that, start branching out and trying the other delicious ramen noodle soups. Add in the seasoned soft-boiled egg. YUM. I feel lucky that I live in NYC and I can eat here every night if I want to. I heart you Ippudo.

Eat your heart out Maruchan!! Several of my friends of suggested that I go here on my visit to NYC. Actually their words are "You gotta try the ramen! Best ramen you will ever taste if you are lucky to get in." Well I am a lady with a mission who doesn't take no for an answer and loves to eat! The place does take reservations...just a little FYI! We were lucky to snag a reso for nine at 8pm. From what I am told this is the only Ippudo chain outside of Japan. The hostess was very accommodating and we didn't have to wait long to sit...maybe 6 minutes. The dining area was decked out pretty modern with a lot of black wood and a visible kitchen area. What we ate: the pork buns and both of us ordered the Akamaru Modern with pork belly and salted boiled egg. The pork buns are out of this world! The meat was so tender, flavorful and just the perfect amount of fat...yumm!!! I have never been a fan of ramen since it is well...meh. The Akamaru was insanely delicious! The broth was so rich with a heavy meat flavor that went down like silk in your throat. The broth is what really made the ramen to be honest. Just remember to stir your soup really well...the rest of Êthe seasonings and ingredients are wrapped up in the noodles. Remember to leave enough broth in your bowl in case you want more noodles too! Overall, it was delicious and I would recommend it again! The only downside is the probably the wait and price. If ÊI didn't get a reso we probably be waiting for hours....they are constantly packed. The soups are quite pricey (two bowls of ramen with the extra items and 1 order of pork buns including tax and tip around 60 bucks)

Came here because of all the great reviews, which turned out to be overrated. Waited in line for a long time. I had pork buns and akamaru chashu ramen. The pork buns were better than the ones I had in gyu-kaku. Everything about the ramen was decent except for the ramen noodles. The soup was phenomenal, so was the onsen egg. The chashu was disappointing, maybe because I am more Êused to Chinese chashu and not Japanese Chashu, (which in my opinion, the former was so much better). The noodles were just so average. For $17+, I expected more than that.

There is a wait...a long long wait.... I would recommend getting there at 10:30am to wait for opening at 11am lunch. This place is fantastic. Like the other ramen houses in New York this has a devout following. The pork is juicy, the noodles are fresh and the broth is the kind of secret you can feel,..no Taste! has been handed down on some parchment scroll from ancient Japan. I am of course a fan just right of crazy fanatic Êbut you can still find me lining up with my best friends for noodles here at least once every few months. I have to agree with Kelsey T, let me have take out. I will never complain. I just need some ramen like some need their coffee!

Came here a few months ago during spring break on a weekday, at around 6ish (BIG mistake, the wait was over an hour!) to see what all the fuss was about. Since the cramped waiting area seems to fuse with the bar, I was itching to guzzle those deliciously, fruity-looking cocktails the grungy-cool bartender chick was whipping up Ê(the lychee cocktails looked absolutely fantastic) just about every 5 minutes. When I was finally led inside, I could already see why the ramen was so pricey (the huge interior had an interesting blend of modern and old school all at the same time--very trendy). Since it was for one, I was seated elbow to elbow with other customers at a long, narrow dinner table. The wait staff looked extremely busy, so I couldn't imagine how they kept track of customers' orders, checks, and requests. I eventually ordered the Akamaru Modern with Menma and Kakuni (felt like indulging myself, hehe). The food came in an instant! I wanted to people-watch some more (I do think Ippudo has a great atmosphere with all sorts of customers, and the cooks in the open kitchen are fun to observe) but I was starving so started digging immediately--head down, the-world-is-my-bowl, literally. I first tried the soup--WAY too salty. Rich, but salty, oh so salty! The pork was AMAZING and tender, just like everyone and their moms have said, but the menma (bamboo shoot) was salty, crunchy but extremely salty with a funky aftertaste. I had a hard time finishing my bowl because of all the salt (felt very heavy and bloated afterwards) so just doggedly stuck to finishing my noodles with extra care not to get any soup base in my spoon. Maybe it was the "secret miso paste" added to the Modern, but all the salt made the bowl almost inedible. Maybe the palate just isn't for me (though Korean food is all about salty goodness), but this is definitely for those who like that richly heavy and cholesterol-ladden taste. Since Ippudo is so wildly popular in NYC, it would be good to try it once. Worth it to go back again for a salt-ridden bowl and $20+ p/p price tag? Nope...

Not sure how to review this exactly. The wait wasn't too bad at 10pm on a Thursday. My friend and I hung at the bar while we waited for a third, ordered a few drinks and a round of the pork belly buns. The bartender ended up giving us a second round for free because no one claimed them. That was fabulous, but already was feeling full. The buns were great but momofuku's are slightly better (sorry!). When we were seated we ordered the classic and modern ramen and more buns. The ramen was definitely good, almost too modern/clean tasting for my liking. But honestly, as good as the food was, $20/bowl is NOT worth it. It's just not. You can make pretty great ramen at home for $1 with an egg and some siracha. So I'm a little torn. I think it's a rip off that could only happen in NY, maybe LA, but the food was so good, it's hard to complain too much!

This has got to be one of the better Ramen places I've been to in New York City. But in my opinion, Ramen can only be so good. It's just noodles and broth guys, it's Japanese junk food, no reason to put it on a pedestal. I would never be caught dead waiting for more than 10 minutes to sit down at this place and I always hate myself when the bill comes and realize i have to drop almost 20 bucks on this stuff. I get that Ramen is a little more accessible than some other components of Japanese cuisine and that's why places like this are "So tasty!" and get yelp reviews about how "the broth exhibits an almost zen-like control over the levels of flavor and saltiness." But the next time you find yourself here with a 20 minute wait, why not take that time going uptown and trying a place like Katsu-hama. Ooh and one tip, you can ask for extra noodles at this place!

Ippudo NY is worth checking out if you love Japanese ramen. I don't know how many times my friends have been telling me to go to this place, but I just had to give it a try. Ippudo can get jam packed on a busy night like Friday or Saturday, so I would make reservations or come here on an off-hour. The bad thing is is that you may be expected to wait as long as an hour before you can sit down if you are a walk-in. First time coming here, my guest and I were asked to wait about 1 hour and 15 minutes, but we actually got seated within 45 minutes of waiting, so there's a plus. I ordered the Shiromaru Hakata Classic, which is more mild broth with pork loin, my guest ordered the Akamaru Modern, similar to the Classic that I ordered, but it has a little bit of a spice to it. For a side dish, we also got Hirata pork buns; oh my goodness, these buns are delicious. Overall, the food was delightful, so much that we ordered 'kae-dama' which means another helping of ramen (for only $3). Just make sure you save your broth and have enough room in your stomach so you can enjoy the second helping! The food here is a little bit on the pricier end than what you'd expect for ramen, but the ambience of this place is very nice and trendy and the location is awesome. It's right by the subway train and only a few blocks away from other bars/restaurants. All in all, check this place out if you're having the crave for some higher-quality ramen, and please please get those pork buns.

What can I say that hasn't been said? Well, I can talk about how much I loved this restaurant. I can also talk about how long I waited in line, but we all know what that is like. I can talk about my experience, though. I didn't even mind waiting in line - my party of 3 came on a Saturday around 5:45 and sat down around 8. We started with the pork buns, and then we all ordered Akamaru Modern for our ramen. Best combo ever. Best combo ever. Best pork buns I have had in a long time. The Akamaru Modern was great, but wasn't the be all and end all ramen for me. If I had to endure waiting in line again, it would be for the pork buns. This is not to say that I did not like the ramen; I wolfed that sucker down so fast. Waiting for two hours does that to you. I heard so much hype about Ippudo, and I felt like I had to try for myself to see what the fuss was about. Even after waiting in line, I still had a great time here.

I came here with a coworker after we were "dismissed" early from work one Friday. We shopped around and then around 3pm, we randomly decided to eat here for lunch. We had no wait and service was excellent. We were just in time for the lunch special that ended at 3:30pm, but the lunch special included a lot a food: the ramen noodles, salad, and a rice bowl. It would have been a good option, if I had the option of taking some to go, but apparently, Ippudo doesn't allow you to have doggie bags. I ended up eating some noodle bowl (can't even remember which one) plus a poached egg. The broth was amazing and very hot. Unfortunately, the bowl also lacked any substantial extras (i.e. meat). I had maybe 2 or 3 pieces of meat. ÊAs much as I love my noodle bowl, I don't think I would wait hours to be seated.

The broth of the Hakata Classic is complex and delicious. ÊThe addition of bakudan (spicy miso paste) and nitamago (soft boiled egg) are a must. ÊOnce you start eating, it becomes very evident that the noodles are not "normal" but they are crafted with care and skill. ÊThe wait, that I heard so many horror stories from my New Yorker friends about, was 15 minutes (lucky me?). ÊBest of all, they had Yebisu, one of the best Japanese lagers you might have never tasted. ÊThe pork bun...freaking delicious...but somewhat decidedly not Japanese. Ê Let me just say that this experience was much better than some other places that I've given 5 stars before. ÊHaving had my fair share of ramen, I can say that the chashu was a bit disappointing and the price was a bit much...for a beer, the pork buns shared between 3 people, and a bowl of ramen plus 2 add-on's, I dropped $40. ÊBut the decor was on point, the hostess was cute and friendly, and most importantly the food was good.

Yes, they make GREAT Ramen, and yes, they are fully aware of this in the way they act towards their customers. This is not a cheap, hole in the wall spot, and there is almost always a wait. My usual order is the Akamaru Modern, providing quite a delicious meal. However, recently while looking for something lighter, I tried the Miso Ramen. This is my new favorite. Not very light... however very yummy. If you only try this place once, give the Hirata Buns a try, all variations are great, including the vegetable version (fried eggplant & eringi mushrooms).

I came here with my boyfriend at the recommendation of a good friend, who raved about it as soon as I told her I was going to NYC for a few days. We came on a day where it was raining especially hard so unfortunately, we got soaked on the way but fortunately, didn't have to wait the notoriously long line. The decor of the place looked really nice and it was awesome that you could see the chefs making the ramen as you were waiting for your food. However, it did appear that most of the things were preprepared so I'm not exactly sure why our order took so long. I also didn't enjoy the fact that we were basically seated at a large table with another couple when there were plenty of other tables available at the time. The shouting in Japanese by the waitstaff to each other everytime there was a new customer or order was cute at first, but kind of got annoying later since it distracted us from our own conversation. My boyfriend ordered an Akamaru Modern and I got their special of the day (which I unfortunately forgot the name of). The noodles came out piping hot, which is exactly the way I like them. The broth was extremely flavorful and tasty but also VERY salty. It almost seemed they were trying to overcome the other flavors with the salt. Also, at the price that we were paying, I was definitely hoping for FRESH house made noodles (we asked the waitstaff and they confirmed that they were not house made) and a couple more pieces of meat. Also, since I don't usually eat a lot, I was turned off by the fact that they didn't let you take your leftovers out. So I was forced to overstuff myself since I didn't want to waste such expensive ramen. Overall, it was a nice meal, but just wasn't actually worth it for me. If they lowered their prices, I would give it one more star but at $16 per bowl of ramen, I was expecting more. This place is DEFINITELY overrated.

I have heard of Ippudo numerous times from various friends. ÊFinally got to come here and give it a try. ÊAbout 30 minutes of wait, even on weekdays. ÊSo popular? Although it resides in the Japanese town St. Mark, the decor of Ippudo is quite Americanized in my eyes. ÊModern, though lacking traditional Japanese touch. ÊMinus one star because of this. Food is awesome! ÊI don't know why I waited this long to make the effort to come here! Ê As for the appetizers, the pork belly and short ribs were marinated in heaven, and the meat was so tender. ÊIt's a lot of calories, but you know, once in a while, it's okay.... And even a tiny dish of a few pieces of shrimp was delicious. Ê As for the Ramen, the special Kasane Black ramen soup had a unique taste of sesame in the soup base, very yummy! ÊThe popular Shiromaru Hakata Classic was delicious too. ÊI really like their soup base and the ramen. ÊThe ramen texture was firm to the bite, bouncy and enjoyably chewy. ÊA few Japanese places in St Mark fail to make impressive ramen soup, but Ippudo has done it right! As for dessert, green tea creme brulee is highly recommended! One complaint I have heard from friends is that the ramen options in menu are rather limited, and after you try their signature ramens a few times, then you'll probably get tired of it.

I first tried to come for dinner a couple months ago. The hostess was really rude, and she told us the wait would be 3 hours. When we asked her to put our name down, she basically refused. She changed what she said before and said it would be 4.5 hour wait... We went elsewhere. I decided to come back again for lunch this time. I mostly just wanted to try it so I could cross it off my list. We arrived too early, and there wasn't anyone in line, came back around 11 AM. There was a line since they hadn't opened yet, and everyone was seated, with tables still empty. Probably has to do with the fact that it was about 90-100 degrees outside! The workers cheer when you walk in. We got the pork buns. Not that great. Momofuku's is better. I tried both the Akamaru Modern and the Wasabi Shoyu Ramen. Both were good but not amazing. I couldn't really taste the wasabi, and it didn't seem like it had much in it.

Time Arrived: 8:30pm Monday Time Wait: Put down our name at 7:30pm, 1 hr wait (Doesn't take reservations) Party: 10 People Atmosphere: Trendy, Dim lighting, Modern Asian theme Food/Drink: This was my 2nd come coming here and I was just as excited to try it again. We got the infamous Pork buns, which was melt in your mouth delicious with its perfectly warm soft buns and mayonnaise sauce. However, there may be some inconsistencies with this place because the 1st time I had it, the meat tasted significantly better than the 2nd time. This time the meat didn't taste as flavorful and soft... I got the Akamaru Modern because it has a stronger garlic flavor. However, next time I might order the Shiromaru Hakata Classic because it seems a little less salty. However, in general this place might be a bit saltier because the soup base is pork. Either way, super yummy. The noodles are chewy - my favorite kind :) Service: Decent Overall: Above average ramen. Would take people here if they are craving ramen and to try the pork buns.

When asked what my favorite meal was in NY...I always say Ippudo! It was the first dinner I had in NY. We were lucky to only have to wait about 15 minutes for a table for 4 at around 4:45 on a Sunday night...thats the trick if you want to eat here...get here either for an early lunch or dinner. This place got packed very fast. I had the miso ramen with the ginger ball. The ramen noodles were PERFECT. They were chewy, firm and almost melted in my mouth. The broth was also savory and tasty, not oily like some miso I have had before. The ginger was also a nice compliment. Also tried the chicken and pork buns that were good too! Service here was fine and I liked the dark, trendy setting. Prices are a bit steep for ramen but WELL WORTH IT! Make sure you go to Ippudo...especially if you love ramen like me!

Hmmm... What can be said that hasn't already been said? Well they are accommodating of peanut/sesame allergies (nephew) and my little nephew finished almost all of his soup after eating a ton on french fries just a little bit prior. That says something to me. The ramen was just really, really done well and service was great. GF got the special ramen for lunch and I got the akamaru modern. While mine was simply, utterly delicious, the gf's ramen was even better. I'll definitely be back when in NY.

Karaka men ($14) was sooo good - best I've had outside Japan. ÊThe pork buns ($9) were even more amazing.

As the first ramen stop that I made when I first came to New York, I have fond memories associated with this place. Since then, I've been at least four additional times and have yet to be disappointed. For what you pay, the portion sizes are filling - and if you're ordering ramen (which you definitely should, as that is what Ippudo is known for) you always have the option of ordering kae-dama, meaning that you pay two dollars for them to bring more noodles to you. I'm vegetarian, so I can't definitively say how great most of their dishes are, but my friends and I have never walked away from Ippudo unhappy. I usually order their off-menu vegetarian ramen, which was recently introduced to their menu as the Wasabi Shoyu Ramen. Other recommended ramen dishes ranked by popularity among friends: 1. Akamaru Modern 2. Kasane Black (limited offering) 3. Shiromaru Hakata Classic The atmosphere is what I'd consider "classic New York" - it's relatively lively, but the wait can be terrible depending on when you go. This is the only reason I give it four out of five stars. Go for lunch and you're set (probably a zero to, at most, 30 minute wait). Go for dinner and you're looking at anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours. Spend some time at their bar if you're 21 or if you're one of many college students with an ID that says you are. Otherwise, put in your name, leave, and come back because the waiting area is cramped. Also important to keep in mind: they won't seat you until everyone from your party is present! That aside, I have confidence that anyone who goes here will walk away with a great foodie experience and a reason to come back. Enjoy!

Oh Ippudo, how I've heard so much about you! ÊLet's start by saying you are well overrated and I acknowledge that by giving you a good review I am contributing to it. Ê I loved the broth, but the noodles were just too light for my liking. ÊI like more chew in my noodles. ÊSeriously? Charging $4-6 for toppings just seems outrageous! Why isn't there a standard bowl that comes with the toppings instead of recommending it and having people order it. The pork buns were heavenly. ÊI loved the flavor and could go back for more. Conclusion, I would go back, but no way am I waiting on line.

Unfortunately I had already eaten by the time I came here so this review is for the bar area only. The area is small but the drinks are interesting and tasty. It's not a restaurant bar that youwould normally come out of your way to have a drink at; more of an area to kill time whilie waiting for your table to be ready. I ordered their Cherry Blossom and the group I was with ordered some Japanese draft beer. Overall enjoyed the experience.

3.75 stars The three of us walked in at 3pm, right before Ippudo was due to close up lunch. One person in our party *ahem* not me *ahem* is a ramen hater! He basically was there against his will, forced by the two of us to abuse his body with sodium, fat...and more sodium! Thank you for being a good sport, luv ;) I ordered Wasabi Shoyu ramen ($15), their soy sauce & vegetable stock ramen (I couldn't stomach pork broth that day.) I asked for the wasabi-infused oil 'on the side' & was glad I did because a smidgen was all I really wanted. Loved the variety of toppings: scallion, tofu, bamboo shoots, Ênori, wasabi. A really yummy bowl of ramen! Other details: The menu offers suggestions for add-ons. Ramen was delivered to our table within 10-15 minutes of ordering. Servers checked in on us a few times. I've heard/read of the horrendous dinner waits; based on my experience, I so would've been disappointed had I waited (we were seated in 5 minutes.) Lastly, no fried garlic Êavailable, but I was given fresh garlic & a grater!

My goal is to hit every ramen joint in NYC and I must say Ippudo has one of the top ramen broths (besides Totto) and pork buns in the city! If you haven't been here before I would recommend the Akamaru. Its not as salty as the Kasune Black (seasonal) which I really don't recommend getting. Also liked the spicy peppers though my dad makes it better, its still good here. Get the pork belly buns but ask for extra sauce! I really don't think this place is expensive especially if you split the ramen bowl between 2 people and order extra ramen for $2 on the side. There is enough soup for even 2 extra plates of ramen noodles!

I can't believe I did the 2 hour wait that was necessary on a Saturday night. I couldn't help it - it felt weak to give up and could I really know Ramen until I eat at Ippudo? When I finally got to try my ramen, I forgot all about the wait. SO good. I wish I didn't fill up on pork buns at the bar while waiting, I wanted to finish my entire bowl. It's pretty large portions and very filling. I just tried some top notch ramen in LA. Ippudo is still my fav. Perfect ramen. I need to go back when it's not peak time and ridiculous.

Craving ramen on a super cold day, we found this place on Yelp. My friend and I (visitors to NY) have never heard of it, and proceeded to go there without realizing the wait. Went in, and saw the gigantic crowd of people. The host taking down my name was extremely stuck up and plain rude, especially when I asked how long the wait was. He smirked and was like "the wait? um..lets see..." and started counting extremely slowly each group that was ahead of me, as if I had asked the stupidest question in the world. anyways, our wait was 1.5 hrs and we decided to wait to see what this hype was all about. We each ordered a ramen and a pork bun to share. Pork buns were good but in my opinion not worth the money. The ramen...., the noodles are nothing like the ramen noodles you get everywhere else. this was a good one-time experience but i dont think id come back to eat their ramen, overpriced and nothing special with no toppings.

Ippudo NY is the closest I would get to a bowl of ramen in Tokyo. I love the white wall decor with the 3D hiragana/katakana writings, well actually ALL the interior design is very cool, the upbeat young staff, and of course their Akamaru Modern and pork buns. I love their Bakudan sauce sooo much!!! If you like spicy you definitely have to get that -- ps: tastes better that way rather than ordering a spicy ramen default. Luckily, I never had to wait here because I am always on LA (body) time. So I would go there just before 3:30 and slide right in! ÊThis is the better Ippudo compared to their sibling in Tokyo itself! I know they have another new one open in Singapore recently but I haven't got a chance to try it yet.

Really not gonna waste your time with a lengthy review but let's just say this modern ramen eatery has the perfect ramen. The shiromaru ramen is pretty standard; I would say just avoid it because it's a standard ramen. It's not bad tasting, it's just that you're paying for exceptional, you're waiting in line for exceptional so order something exceptional: the akamaru modern is the way to go. Ramen is a bit thinner and clearly hand-made. it's chewy and delicious. The broth is amazing and slightly sweet. Heaven. The pork in the pork buns are soft and fatty but crispy on the outside with a spicy kick... yummy. Let's not ignore the bar while you're waiting. The lychee martini here is the best I've had. The bartender or the recipe is really something special. The combination of smooth sake and vodka was perfect. It wasn't cloyingly sweet nor face-pinchingly bitter: it was the perfect lychee martini and it was strong. So thank you for making my 2-hour wait better, martini. Which reminds me, come in a small group, be prepared to wait for more than 2 hours, and find something to do in the mean time.

*here goes another generic review thrown into the mix of 3639 other reviews* WOW! A noodle-fanatic friend of mine who lived in Japan for several years had told me that this place has the best ramen in the U.S., so I had extremely high expectations coming here. Of course I did my homework and read a small sample of reviews from here before going and decided to line up before they re-opened at 5:00PM. We got there at 4:25PM or so and there were already 4 groups of people in front of us. By 4:50PM, I couldn't see the back of the line anymore. The exterior of the restaurant seemed very basic, with a simple design of blocks of wood placed unevenly, but as we walked in, we found that the interior was very nice and dimly lit for a perfect date. The structure was very well done in that there's a bar right in the front waiting area so that people can grab a drink while waiting hours for their turn to get a taste of America's best ramen. We were led by the hostess through this dark hallway and upon reaching the opening to the dining area, we were greeted with a refreshing welcoming from all of the kitchen and wait staff. What an awesome idea to make guests feel special huh?! Onto the food: like everybody else, we started the pork buns and oh my, it was scrumptious! The fluffy bread, succulent pork, the juicy sauces! We moved onto the akamaru modern w/ kakuni topping and the karaka men and my oh, once again, it was delicious! The broth smelled and tasted like heaven, the noodles, taste and texture, were very tasty. The akamaru modern came with thinner noodles which was a bit disappointing, but it still tasted great. We also ordered the Ginga Kogen beer, the aroma and taste was unique, quite expensive as well at $9 for a 10oz bottle. Lastly, the matcha brulee was also a unique experience, did not know there was such a thing! The service was the best I've ever experienced. The staff is extremely friendly and genuinely wanted to serve you. The food came very promptly, as were the dishes being taken away. There were always somebody walking around, so you'll never have to look around and flag someone down. Needless to say, I'll be returning on my next NY visit!

Next on the list was Ippudo NY, GOT RAMEN??????? It doesn't get any better than this: upscale, spacious, admirable, and distinctive food. Reservations are suggested as this restaurant gets packed! Party of seven please..... What's to order? Ippudo salad ($8) Mixed greens served with sesame shoyu dressing-Killed it!! Hirata buns ($9) Steamed buns filled with your choice of pork or chicken, served with Ipuddos original spicy bun sauce. You know we got the pork belly right? The buns have excellent texture. Fluffy and spongy. The pork was seasoned well, but I still like momofuku's better. ;) Yamitsuki Goma Kyuri ($8) Japanese cucumber seasoned with Ippudo's original sesame oil dressing. My girlfriends didn't care much for it, but I did!! Shiromaru Hakata Classic ($15) The original silky "Tonkotsu" (pork) soup noodles topped with pork loin chashu, sesame kikurage mushrooms, memma, red pickled ginger, & scallions. We added a poached egg and extra noodles. The light-brown broth was a revelation. It was nutty, complex, and deeply satisfying, its flavor enhanced by the slices of tender pork. The noodles were firm but not quite chewy, perfectly al dente. Karaka Men ($16) The original silky "Tonkotsu" (pork) noodle soup with Ippudo's special blend of hot spices, topped with pork chashu, sesame kikurage mushrooms, cabbage, onion, minced pork, and scallions. The broth was spicy and lively; fire and pork. It was the miso that made our tongues tingle and cheeks flush. I highly recommend if your craving some good Ramen, Ippudo NY is the best place to go!!

Unimpressive, overpriced and a long wait for average food. I been observing the long lines here for a long time and was excited to try it out.

Absolutely love this place. I had been to one in Hong Kong and had an unbelievable meal, so figured that I would give the NYC one a shot. It was equally as good. I had the special "Kuro Kasane" and it blew me away. One of the best bowls of ramen I have ever had. Nice and flavorful. The appetizers were equally as good, if not better. Of course, they are known for the pork buns and they did not disappoint (they are actually very similar to a Taiwanese bun called "gua bao"/pork belly buns that you can get at baohaus on 14th). The cucumber (Yamitsuki Goma Kyuri) had the perfect dressing. Even the edamame, which is difficult to expect anything special of, surprised me with the yuzu salt. The hirata chicken wings were merely good, nothing too special, however. Great meal!

after many unsuccessful attempts at ippudo in the past year, i finally tried it last friday with a few friends. we waited almost 2 hours. Ê we sat down and i ordered the Akamaru Modern with the poached egg. don't get me wrong, the ramen was good, but it wasn't worth the 2 hour wait. Ê if the wait wasn't so long, i would come back. Êi enjoyed the broth so much i practically drank the whole thing. Êi felt the noodle portion could have been bigger. Ê i also felt the cha su i got was meh. Êi feel like the ramen we can get at the mitsuwa food court is better on all levels - it's cheaper, the cha su is melt in your mouth and the noodle portions are better. Êi'll give it to you that mitsuwa is farther, but that's about it. Ê also, i recently tried the ippudo in HK and i have to say that the HK one was better. Ê the HK broth was delicious and the pork buns we got in the HK ippudo were also great. Ê too bad i didn't order the pork buns in the ny ippudo to compare. Ê i say the HK ramen was better because the noodles and broth tasted better... i don't know what it was, but it left an impression that this one didn't. Ê i don't think i would come back to this place unless there was no line and i am craving it. also, i think this ramen is comparable to the ramen at naruto ramen in brooklyn. Ê i even think the ramen at gyu kaku tastes better. Êmaybe it was the wait that jaded my impression, but it definitely did not meet my expectations. ramen aside, we also got the Tako Sanbaizu (octopus sashimi). Êthat was just okay as well. Ê i was expecting to be wow'ed and i wasn't. Ê i really like sashimi and sushi and this just okay. Êi wouldn't waste $10 ordering it. instead of the pork buns, we got the Samurai Rib to try. Êthe meat fell off the bones, but i felt the sauce was too sweet and it disguised the taste of the rib. Êi also felt it was a little dry. Êat $12 for 2 ribs, i found it to be extremely over priced. Êdo not order this either. stick to the ramen and try the pork buns (once). one last thing that bugged me. Êi hated how the people that worked there weren't japanese! Êwhat is up with that? Ê this definitely does not give the authentic japanese ramen feel to me. Ê it makes me feel like this place is americanized and we are not getting the true ramen experience. Ê after trying ramen in tokyo this past may, i've somewhat become a ramen snob and ippudo is sadly not on my list of must have ramen places.

LOVED this place. And we were actually quite lucky, only a thirty minute wait haha. I probably wouldn't wait more than forty-five minutes, not THAT worth it. But they make the noodles themselves and you can definitely tell. We were stuck at a community table but it didn't really matter. It's just that anyone who has read my passed reviews know I can't stand community tables haha. But they do have plenty of personal tables though. Quite noisy, but fun. It was actually my first time eating real ramen, I always went for the udon bowls. And I was quite pleased :)

Hi everyone, I live in Manhattan and this is my obligatory Ippudo review. It's hard to give this restaurant any thing but a 4 stars. It's delicious, yes, but is it really the hands-down-best-ramen-restaurant that everyone hypes it up to be? And is the food all that matters in a dining experience? Let's break it down: It's on the pricier side, and there's always a wait of at least 15 minutes. The waiters aren't particularly attentive or helpful, and let's be honest, the place is too dark and loud to have a comfortable conversation. RAMEN: The broth is rich. Whether its the Classic or the Akamaru Modern, you always come out feeling like you've even more than just one bowl of ramen (well, I usually get 2 extra orders of noodles so that might be why.) The add-in's are awesome, your choice of: pork belly, raw egg, mushrooms and the like. It really let's you customize your bowl of ramen. My one complaint is that I'm not a huge fan of the actual noodles. Ippudo's appetizers are also tasty, the karaage (fried chicken) and fried pork with lemon. Mmmm. Pork buns are equally good, but I definitely prefer Baohaus. The desserts are decent, but usually I don't make it to that stage of the meal. All things considered, Ippudo definitely deserves its recognition as the top ramen joint of the East Village/Greenwich Village area, but I still have my reservations about awarding it the coveted title of "Manhattan's Best Ramen."

We tried coming here once during dinner time. It was packed. There was no room to stand in the restaurant to wait and the waiting time was over an hour, so we ask for reservations for the next day. The restaurant does not make reservations, so we left. After a couple of days, my boyfriend made it to the restaurant around 5:30pm and there was bit of a wait. The decor was very modern yet cute. Our waiter was very attentive. We order two appetizers, Kurobuta Pork Tatsuta Age and Tofu and Nasu Agedashi. They were delicious. The pork melts in your mouth. The tofu and Nasu Agedashi was pleasing to the palate. My favorite part of dinner is the ramens. I ordered Akamaru Modern and my boyfriend had the Karaka Men (spicy). The meats were tender and juicy. The noodles were not soggy. It was aldente. The soup and everything else balanced each other. If you're a ramen lover, you should come here.

Noisy as all hell. The first time for me that the environment drastically affected my meal. The high pitched girls screaming in Nihongo need to go. Started with the Hirata pork buns. Not as melt in your mouth as Momofuku. Spicier and saltier though. Overall just okay. For ramen I tried Kasane black and Karaka miso ramen. The portions were small for the price and I am not a fan of the whole add-on nickel-and-diming affair disguised as "customizing your meal." Charging me 10% extra for more hot sauce paste? Sorry but no. Extra 10% charge for more ramen because your portions are so small and I don't get more broth? Again no. The Kasane broth was thick like gravy. Almost undrinkable given its consistency. The Karaka ramen was great in terms of flavor but again the portion was lacking. I would order the Karaka again if priced about $4 lower. In the end $52 for 2 bowls of ramen and pork buns that didn't blow me away. The sheer noise and shrieking did blow me away. So far away that I'm not coming back.

Visiting NYC, we had to try this place out. Upon entering the establishment, I really, really love the ambiance. ÊThe decor, the staff, the music, just everything about this place really makes it unique. We had the following: - Hirata Buns Pork: Steamed buns filled with your choice of either pork, chicken, or eggplant & eringi mushrooms served with Ippudo's original spicy buns sauce. ÊThis was melt-in-your-mouth goodness. ÊThe buns were so soft, and the meat oh so tender. ÊI just wanted to order 10 more orders after the first bite. ÊBut of course that sounds silly.. or is it.. - Samurai Rib: Pork spare ribs, seasoned with soy based 'tare' sauce served with seven-spice chili pepper. ÊThis was so tender and so delicious. ÊReally fattening, but oh so good. For our noodles, we added: - Kakuni: which is a braised pork belly, its good, trust me, order it, it will make you go ^_^ - Nitamago: which is a salted boiled egg, also order this, trust me. - Akamaru Modern: The original silky "Tonkotsu" (pork) soup noodles topped with Ippudo's secret "Umami Dama" miso paste, pork chashu, cabage, sesame kikurage mushrooms, scallions, and fragrant garlic oil - Kasane Black - Authentic "Kasane" tonkotsu (pork) & chicken base noodle soup, topped wih pork loin chashu, cabbage, sesame kikurage mushrooms, red pickled ginger, naruto, scallions, and fragrant "Black" garlic oil. Both noodles were out of this world delicious. ÊAnd the crazy thing is, its so light that you don't feel bloated and stuffed like a sumo after you consume this huge bowl of noodles. Although it is quite pricey for a bowl of noodles, it was worth it. ÊI can't wait to go back to NYC just to go eat here again, its crazy delicious good.

Came here with my boyfriend, my sister, and her boyfriend since they were in town and I wanted to have them experience the best ramen dining experience in the city. Fortunately, we arrived at 4:30 PM on a Saturday, with no reservation, but we waited in line (we were second in line) for them to open up for dinner. We were seated immediately at 5 -- and the place was empty (the first time I've been where we didn't have to wait over an hour). I tried the Yuzu Citrus Sake, which was okay. We started with 2 orders of the pork buns which everyone loved. I'm not amazed by them but they are good. We also shared the Kamo Sukiyaki (thin slices of duck breast with yaki tofu, shiitake & enoki mushrooms, tokyo leeks, poached egg, and ramen noodles in traditional sukiyaki sauce) -- it was soo yummy! I loved every bite. I ordered my usual Akamaru Modern -- I usually get the Nitamago but this time I ordered extra pork belly (Kakuni).The ramen already had a ton of pork but having extra was delicious! My boyfriend ordered the Classic Ramen which I thought was just okay. My sister and her boyfriend both ordered the Karaka Men which has a bit more spicy flavor (officially my favorite here and I'll probably order it next time). I skipped out on dessert since I was so full from ramen and broth but my sister's boyfriend tried the matcha brulee which I think he enjoyed. Overall, another great experience at Ippudo and my guests were quite impressed!

ACHTUNG: This Ippudo review has insight that you will not find in the other 3,500+ Yelp reviews!!! Just kidding, but now I have you reading so you might as well keep at it. Getting in: give yourself 1.5-2.0 hours ahead of when you'd actually like to eat. DON'T listen to what the staff tells you how long the wait will be. We were told "around 3 or 4 hours" and we were seated within two hours. Being in: if you are going with ramen fans "in the know," whose in-the-know-ness includes knowing how difficult it is to get IN, please know that your party will wear that giddy-as-a-schoolboy look on their faces the entire night. Consider it endearing. Fitting in: I don't know what this means but I've sort of trapped myself into this review structure. The place is casual cool. However, you literally might have to fit in next to other ramen patrons who aren't in your party. If you are like me and my party of four, you will be placed in a giant booth that easily sits ten. You'll have so much elbow room that [INSERT PUN HERE LATER AUTO-SAVE]. Tipplin': The sake comes in these little wooden boxes. Apparently you are supposed to drink from the boxes because the sake will be poured to the brim. I forget the reason why (probably due to the amount of sake and beer consumed), but I think it has to do with treatin' guests right. Orderin': Everyone in your party oughta order something different, as our party did. As it happens, I ordered best: the Karaka Men. It was spicy (with a side of EXTRA spiciness, hearty and filling). Everyone agreed that the extra buck is worth it (and no one was disappointed in their lesser, but equivalently fantastic ramen meals). Digging in: Put that fork away, and pick up those chopsticks and that spoon thingy. Go to town. Overeatin': Apparently if you say "Kae-dama, please," you get extra noodles. I am too bone-headed to remember such stuff, so I said, "May I have more noodles, please?" and a wallap of a dollop came lickety split. The trick is, you have to RESIST guzzling the broth until your seconds. Leavin': It's a wistful affair. (Or in my case, it was a I'm-so-drunk-and-full-that-I-am-just-going-to-go-?to-bed affair.) You feel that after waiting for so many months and hours, you oughta be able to stay forever. Alack, you CAIN'T. Get out and head a few blocks southeast for endless fun. PS, Yes I spent too much time on this review. There are probably 4,000+ reviews by the time you read this, dammit!

Incredible food and a great experience. The ramen is really outstanding, and as many reviewers have already mentioned, the pork buns are a must-have. This place gets slammed - so go early or be prepared to wait for a table.

"You HAVE to try Ippudo!" "Ippudo is the best in NY!" "If you're in NY you have to go to Ippudo!" Sound familiar? After living in New York for almost two years, I had been told by almost every person who had been to Ippudo that I had to go at least once. I had just finished yoga on a weekday at around 1PM, when on a whim we decided to go to Ippudo. There was no line and we were seated immediately, despite my sweaty exterior and lycra outfit. The modern ramen was good, especially the dollop of miso on top. If you come at lunch you can make your ramen into a combo for another $3, which includes salad and a rice bowl. The spicy roe rice bowl was delicious (although not spicy, and the ratio of rice to roe was way off). Even though the food was good, its over priced and over hyped. If I had to wait 2 hours for that, I would really be annoyed. Doubtful I'll be coming back, but at least now I can say that I've been to Ippudo.

Ippudo is rapidly becoming one of my pet peeves. However, noting that I don't eat beef or pork, you have to take my opinion with a gigantic grain of salt. The ramen here is decent and consistent, but definitely not the best in the city -- for one, Totto is better, cheaper, usually with a shorter wait, and they give you more food. The atmosphere is hip/trendy, maybe even pretentious, which IMO generally indicates a lower quality of food. However, no! Ippudo's ramen is quite decent, just not worth the price ($15+) or the wait (at least 15 minutes, could be up to 2 hours). Toppings will certainly add to your dish (the egg makes it seem more authentic to me, while the Bakudan is good as well), but c'mon, don't pay $2 for an egg -- you will need that $2 for a second helping of noodles. Surprisingly, I noted this from Yelp: "A Yelpy Insight: Vegetarians go nuts for this spot. " This is confusing, because there is only one ramen item (Wasabi Shoyu) that is not based in pork noodle soup. Sidenote: If you can actually tolerate spicy food, you won't find anything here spicy. This place is not meant for people like you.

not many food options, but all are good. 5 stars for great food, but minus 1 star for 1.5 hour wait. This place actually has Sapporo Light. I always love drinking Asian beers, but all other restaurants I went to, none of them has anything Asian light beers. This is the first restaurant that has Sapporo Light. Wonderful! My suggestion: if you would like to eat here, call ahead, put your name and a number down for a table and ask them to call you when the table is ready before you go. This way your wait is minimum.

After all the rage and hype, we decided on having Ippudo for lunch. We came around 11 am when it opened on a Monday, and we did not have to wait at all. Ippudo is a trendy, Americanized type of ramen restaurant. It has a great atmosphere, but the music was really loud. We had to shout across our table to hear one another. And it seems that the majority of servers are non-Japanese. I will say that the ramen is amazing, but I'm more dissatisfied with the service. We were seated at a booth with enough room for 8 people, and we had 5 people. Our friend was running late, so we decided to start first and have him order afterwards. Apparently, "add-on's" are not allowed and they made a huge fuss about adding a person to a booth which had more than enough room for him. I ordered the Akamaru Modern ($14), and we shared a couple plates of pork buns. The pork buns were excellent ($9 for two), and the ramen was, as I said, amazing. The broth was tasty and not overly salty. The pork was also very tasty, but I wish there would have given a couple more slices. They also require 20% gratuity for parties of 5 or more, so if you want to try Ippudo, come in small groups!

Karaka men with a poached egg and the pork belly buns. It was melt-in-my-mouth delicious and I'd go back to NYC just to have that meal every day. Although there are signs warning you of not taking your time to be considerate of waiting customers, I ate there alone and stayed long after I finished eating and nobody rushed me. It was crazy busy at 12pm with locals and tourists.

Finally I can comment on the Ippudo vs. Totto clash!! Noodles: Totto wins, hands down. Broth: Ippudo has a slightly more complex flavor, I think, and it's less salty. Toppings: This is hard, but I got some pretty spectacular pork belly at Ippudo today so I have to say...Ippudo. Sides: I got the Ippudo lunch combo and the rice / salad was nice but nothing special. Totto has nicer dishes for the price. Atmosphere: Ippudo was much nicer and much larger. Totto is rather squished and hole-in-wall-y. Depends on what you're going for. Service: Ippudo. My friend (Nancy S.) and I stayed here for hours chatting while the line outside was long (we're sorry! It was raining! She just got back from Asia!) but the servers never hurried or bothered us. Plus we got some nice red tea at the end of our meal. Price: Totto is definitely more affordable than Ippudo, which can get pretty pricey very quickly. I have to say it's a hard choice, but it depends on what you're going for. Ippudo would actually make for a nice meal. Totto is for the ramen, period, no dilly-dallying around.

Waited the expected over 1 hour wait around noon on a weekend. And then... I cannot say I was blown away by the ramen. So yes, this place is over hyped but the food was definitely not bad bad by any means. The apps were done well and tasty. But when the ramen arrived my 5 senses did not immediately awaken. I expected at first sight and smell to be in mouthwatering anticipation for the first taste. Unfortunately that did not happen. The soup itself was creamy but did not invoke that desire to finish the last drop. The ramen itself was just fine but I enjoy more bite in my noodle. On the upside my glass of water was always quickly refilled hahaha. Extra points gained for decor and the 2 clean ladies bathrooms to the 1 mens room. There is a bar in the front waiting area so check out the draft beer handles and the bowls on the wall. Also, small parties should not expect to get their own table but share a larger communal table.

Wow, this easily met my high expectations. I had a moment in the middle of my meal where I was almost peaking on the combination of incredible ramen, fantastic music, sake, spiciness, and whatever. Went at 6:30PM on a Wed and waited 30 minutes for 2 seats at a communal table. I hate communal tables. If I'm going to pay $100 or more for a meal, I want my own table. I also hate waiting although in this case my buddy and I were able to use the time productively (the ice cream shop down the street is tasty). What's the matter with taking reservations? I do know the secret but I don't have time to make rezzy's in person. So we sat down at our communal table and the music was blaring something awful. Bad electronic music with 80's synths at an incredible volume that made conversation impossible from further than 2 inches. The seats were somewhat comfortable which was a welcome surprise. The service was hover-y and smother-y and still somehow not satisfyingly attentive. It was all bad timing and a rotating cast but they were perfectly adequate and didn't mess anything up. I ordered bottled water and they brought me this baby San Pellegrino bottle. I mean, charge me whatever but it's pretty ridiculous when a restaurant can't give me a big boy bottle of water. Just saying. We ordered a bottle of the house sake which was good. I'm not a huge sake buff but it was cold, milky (unfiltered), and went down pretty smooth. But the point wasn't the service. The point was the food. There is a tip box in front of the kitchen for the chefs. USE IT! The fried tuna app was delicious. The sauce had great texture and flavor and the fish was cooked perfectly. The pork buns were also excellent. The Kasane Black ramen with an egg and 1/2 a spicy ball (not sure what they called that but it was on the little add on menu with the egg) was next. Right when they brought it out, the music changed and Thom Yorke (Harrowdown Hill, I believe) started playing, which I considered an awesome change of events. This was immediately followed by Massive Attack's Safe From Harm. At this point the sake was kicking in and the broth of the ramen mixed with the egg yolk and spice was absolutely the best thing I've eaten in recent memory. It was so rich and velvety and thick and smooth and balanced, oh my gawd. The noodles were perfect, just the right bit of texture and just the right size. The cabbage and mushroom and other bits of this and that were awesome. The meat was thin and falling apart and delicious. It was the whole package. I just starting blissing out to the blaring trip hop and stuffing noodles and broth into my face. It was so fugging amazing. I never wanted that bowl of ramen to end. I will be back very very soon, A+.

I crave this place! I love the pork hirata buns and then it's a toss up between the miso ramen and the tori - don't forget to yell kae-dama for an extra ball of noodles for only $2! Try and save room for dessert... I recommend mascarpone cheese and ice cream - you won't regret it! NOMZ! TIP: day of dinner reservations - you can come by an hour early and put your name down... bummer that you have to go IN the restaurant but it's nice to know... swing by, grab drinks elsewhere, and your table will be waiting :)

It was a birthday treat to get a table here within a few minutes of arriving, though that's on account of my friend stopping by early in the evening to put our name down. For an appetizer, I had the pork buns. They were delicious - spicy and texturally complex. I chose the "modern" ramen. The broth was one of the best I've had, as were the noodles. The pork was a little boring though. The constant yelling of the cooks and the wait staff makes for a loud and mildly obnoxious meal. Does that make it more authentic? Regardless, the food's good, and you've been warned!

The interior and overall decor are nothing to write home about. While it's definitely sexy enough for a hot date and candid enough for a beginning to a legendary night out, it doesn't really stand out from a lot of the other establishments that surround it. In fact, I would say it (alone) is pretty forgettable relative to the rating it's received on here. The service is excellent. You won't have to play "Where's Waldo" with your waiter. While I have nothing to add about the deliciousness of the ramen served here (though I wouldn't slap my mother over it), I highly suggest getting the tako wasabi. It's a great conversation starter and will help make your 60+ minute wait a lot shorter while making new friends! This place is okay, though I wouldn't hop on a plane to NYC just to try it. (If you do wish to do that, go to Momofuku instead. The nearly-religious raving over it is completely warranted.)

This place was good, but I wish I could give it 3.5 stars. It wasn't ind-blowing or anything. We got there at 5:45 on a Friday and waited an hour for two. Waiting at the bar is nice though, there aren't any seats but you can lean against it and order appetizers. Get the pork buns! They are amazing! We were told that the ramen wasn't big enough for two to share, but it definitely is. We got extra noodles with ours, which we probably didn't need, but that's because I like the broth more than the noodles. We also got pork as an add on- definitely a small portion, you could easily get two add ons. Wish we would've done egg. Overall, it was good, but I like Slurping Turtle in Chicago better. Didn't have room for dessert but would've liked to try the green tea creme brulee.

ÊThe ramen was good, but not what I had oped, especially for the $14 price. ÊThe pork buns, however, were delicious (but overpriced @ $9 for 2 as well).

Get there early and have the two for one beers at the bar while you wait. The pork buns melt in your mouth, and the modern ramen is AMAZING. Broth is perfect! If you think you'll still be hungry at the end of your meal, then save up your broth. You can get extra noodles for two bucks more. If the wait is more than one hour, then just leave and come back. It definitely lived up to the hype.

If ramen is all about the broth, then this place has some of the best ramen I've ever had. ÊMy friend couldn't stop raving about this place so when the we found ourselves in the area, it was a given that we would stopping by. We arrived just before noon on a Friday and had a relatively short wait of 20 minutes for a seat. ÊWe started with an order of their pork (belly) buns. ÊThey were good, but given that it has been the new "goat cheese and beet salad" at every hip Asian restaurant (thanks to Momofuku), it wasn't anything extraordinary. ÊThey were good, but it's not something I would rush to order on every visit. After much hemming and hawing, I decided on the Akamaru Modern - "The original silky "Tonkotsu" (pork) soup noodles topped with Ippudo's secret "Umami Dama" miso paste, pork chashu, cabbage, sesame kikurage mushrooms, scallions, and fragrant garlic oil" with a soft boiled egg. ÊI sampled the broth without the miso pasted and sampled it with the paste mixed in. ÊWhoa. ÊThat dollop of miso paste makes all the difference. ÊWithout it, the broth is good, but pretty standard. ÊWith the miso paste, the broth was fantastic - rich, complex and boldly flavored. ÊThe noodles are hand made on the premises (you can see them make it downstairs) and are slightly chewy and perfectly cooked. ÊThe toppings were pretty generous and fresh, with the egg being perfectly soft boiled, as it is supposed to be for ramen. Ê One bowl is definitely filling. They do offer ramen and rice combinations, appetizers and a wide variety of ramen dishes. ÊI wish I had spicy fried chicken, but that will have to wait for a future visit. Ê Service was excellent Ê- attentive and quick. ÊThe energy level here is at an all time high, with the music turned up and lights turned down. ÊNot your typical ramen joint, to be sure, but a fun time with great food to be had here. ÊI really liked the open kitchen and being able to see all the staff in action.

Ippudo was pretty tasty! ÊI ordered the akamaru modern which was topped with their secret miso paste, pork chashu, cabbage, sesame kikurage mushrooms, scallions, and fragrant garlic oil. ÊThe broth was hot and flavorful, the noodles were cooked to a medium texture (not too firm, not too soft) and the toppings worked as a perfect combination. ÊAlthough, I didn't taste the garlic oil. Ê We got there shortly after they opened for lunch, which was good because we didn't have to wait, and by the time the place started to fill up with the lunch crowd our tums were full and we were out the door.

Hard to rate overall because on a food tour we stopped in here. Pork buns. Yup as good as it gets. No wonder it is mentioned in over 1000 reviews. Perfect blend of spiciness, tender pork, scallions and soft bun. Oral sensation!!! I waited till we came back again 2 weeks later to dine inside. For some reason at 3pm there was an hour wait! We came back hungrily at 4pm. We had the pork buns again and they were great. Same as earlier. Samurai ribs were a pleasant surprise - not as good as my own version of asian ribs but fall off the bone sauciness was very good. Ramen - this is a ramen place after all.....we had the black style special ramen and kae-dama'd it. More ramen! It was also very good and I'm not usually a ramen fan! Pricey but worth a try.

Cucumber salad - overpriced for what it was, not marinated long enough 3.) Duck breast sukiyaki - came with napa cabbage, tofu, and some noodles. Tasty but very small portion for $15. 4.) Blood orange sorbet + pear sorbet was great! pear sorbet tasted like i was biting into a pear, blood orange was very fresh ** Love the ambiance of this place, indoor decor is definitely pretty unique which is really cool.

I've been here a few times and have gotten there right when it opens for either lunch or dinner. It's always been packed whenever I go here so I recommend getting there about 15-20 minutes before Ippudo opens. I usually end up waiting for 10-15 minutes to be seated. You can have a cocktail at the bar while you wait :) I have had the Hirata buns with pork - pork belly in a steamed bun. The pork belly is tender and well seasoned and the bun is super soft. I usually get either the Akamaru Modern ramen or the Special Ramen of the day. The broth is rich and full of flavor. You can add braised pork belly, a fried egg, spicy chili paste, etc. for $2-$4 extra. Delicious! Warning: it's really loud and dimly lit in here. The staff members are shouting in Japanese as you enter and as you leave - it's a very lively in this restaurant!

Ippudo NY with it's devoted East Coast fan base and infuriating long lines fell short. Considering how I rarely spend over $10 for a meal and my bowl of ramen was $15, I'm talking very, very short. With a price like that, I was expecting something life-changing. I left this place life relatively unchanged, and wallet hurt'n. Shiromaru Hakata Classic ($15) - The soup was flavorful, but I prefer it creamier. The pork chasu was a bit too tough for my liking. With every bite, I just craved Daikokuya ramen more and more. Hirata Chicken Wings ($7) - better than the ramen in my book. 3 pieces of honey-glazed wings exploding with ginger soy flavor. The skin was fried to crispy perfection. Can I dip everything in this sauce? Ê If you're visiting NY, I say come here just to say you've been to the famous Ippudo. I'm glad I came, but I won't be returning. Totto Ramen in Hell's Kitchen is so much better though. Also, don't claim Ippudo to be the ramen ever until you've had my beloved Daikokuya in Socal, guys. There are better things out there. Trust.

I've been to Ippudo several times and I know to always come early because it gets CROWDED after 7pm. My first time here I shared a fried oyster appetizer with my husband and we each had a ramen, it was good and filling. We sat in the middle of the restaurant and it's a nice atmosphere. Another time I came here with 3 other friends and we got a booth which is more than enough space for 4 people. We ordered the Maguro Tartar and another appetizer - both were delicious. Of course we loved all our ramens too. When I brought my friend here who's been to Ippudo in Japan and HK, she said the NY location was not as good as what she had. Well, despite that, this is where I'm going for my ramen-fix.

Every time I come here, I ask myself if it is really worth the wait, especially since there are other decent ramen places much closer to our house... but when I take my first bite of a fresh bowl of Ippudo ramen, I remind myself that it is worth it. Always remember to order the kae dama (second helping of noodles). Since they are fresh from the kitchen, I think it almost tastes better than the first batch in the soup. ÊKae dama is the part that I look forward to most, it finishes off my meal perfectly.

Ippudo waits start at an hour to sit. Or you can go to the bar, as we did, three perfect spots, standing room only, order up some beer, sake and buns and you're good to go. Fluffy like no other, the buns hold the most tender roast pork one can imagine. A slightly spicy sauce combines with the crunch of the flake of lettuce to conceive what is one of the most satisfying morsels you may ever have the pleasure of devouring. Two to an order ($9). Shishito peppers with yuzu salt arrive crunchy, firery, sweet and buttery all in the same mouthful ($8). Splendid they are. Karukute Oishii Junmaishu is a semi-sweet sake, palate cleansing and perfect to finish off our start of a long day of indulgence ($11) and arrives in a mini jar with a peel off top. A few Yebisu beers, mixed in, manage to produce an almost pilsner-like effect. Ippudo deserves to be tried.

Yes, Yes, Yes!!! Downside is the super long wait time, but it's always well worth it. Try the lychee martini in the meantime. Everything is exceptional. Must have? The pork belly. I'd even go here alone on a rainy wednesday afternoon if the craving set in.

Ok so I was visitng NYC just like everyone else, and decided to come to Ippudo with my family. We didn't even have to wait suckas lol I thought the ramen was good, but the pork buns were better! How ironic right to go to a ramen place and leave thinking about something else haha. My mom on the other hand thinks she can make better ramen at home, but this place is decent. $14 for a bowl of ramen though idk about that....I think the pork buns are more worth it =P

ÊThis is a place I will come back to, for sure, I need to get the pork belly. ÊAgain, my pesce-ism held me back, NOOOOOO!!!!! Ê So the tails, or deets. ÊYou will wait, it is certain. ÊThey said an hour, it was more like 35 mins. ÊWho cares, it's worth it. ÊOrder a drink and bao bun at the front bar and chill the f out. ÊWe got the peppers. ÊThe deal is 1 in every 10 is hot. ÊWell three out of our 16 or so peppers were hot and I managed to get every one of them. ÊWhew, my mouth was on fire from one of them! ÊI also got a sake cup inside of a sake box, yes sir, just the way I like it! ÊWe finally sat in the back at a communal table and slurped away. ÊThis isn't the best ramen I've ever had, that award goes to Daikokuya in LA, but it is up there. ÊTotally worth a visit or two, or three, or weekly if you live in NYC.

Ippudo is the best ramen place I've been to in NY. I had Totto for lunch one day and Ippudo for dinner the same night to compare and Ippudo still comes out on top. Start off with the pork belly buns, they are just delightful. But wait, it gets better. The texture of the noodle is fantastic, you can tell it's fresh. The broth (all of them) is out of this world and the toppings you can get with them is all real good. It is a long wait and if you think about it, 16-20 bucks for a bowl of ramen is a little outrageous, but it is certainly worth the wait and worth the money. Go for the kae dama if you can stomach it. I never have room for dessert after a pork bun, beer, ramen and kae dama so I can't attest for any dessert. Game plan; grab a handful of friends, go to ippudo after work and tell them your party size, go to st. marks and grab a couple beers, come back, get seated and have the best ramen you'll ever have outside of Japan.

This place is like heaven! When I had my first bite of the Akamaru Modern Ramen, I literally almost wanted to cry...Their broth had the right amount of pork flavor, their noodles tasted very fresh, where you can tell it is definitely handmade (Not the ones taste like freakin instant noodles! Trust, ive been to restaurant where they try to trick you!!!!). Although they only have 2-3 slices of pork in the ramen, but man... that pork tasted very tender and flavorful!!!! Their appetizers are just as good as their ramen. I only had their Samurai Rib, but the rib tasted just as good as the pork in the ramen. The only downside is that the wait is really long. I waited 2 hours...but come on this shit is definitely worth it!!!! I rated Shin-Sen-Gumi as the best ramen place in LA, but Ippudo is probably the best ramen place EVER created in the world! The reason I said that because I also went to the one in Hong Kong, and it is just as freakin good as the one in NY! Overall, this shit is fucking amazing!!!!!

ÊThis is the largest of the top 5 most known ramen places in NY so the wait time isn't as bad as Totto or Hide Chan where it can go up to 2 hours plus!

Except for the wait, it's almost a flawless dinning experience. Except for the wait of course. The service is attentive, and the food choices are stream lined but all incredibly delicious. Highly recommend are the pork bun sandwiches as an appetizer. If this place sold this and only this I would still come here. The ramen is excellent. I couldn't believe all the fuss and hype. Now on my third visit the ramen here is very unique. Heaven forbid you're still hungry you can get a second helping of ramen for a few dollars.

2PM on a Tuesday - 15-min wait - pretty decent. The pork buns were amazing - 4 stars! Succulent, juicy and tender pork slices sandwiched within extremely soft steamed buns. A truly foodgasmic moment! Akamaru Modern - fantastic broth (I could taste the hours put into boiling the core out of the pork bones) and chewy and silky noodles! BUT the grand number of thinly sliced pork pieces in my huge ramen bowl - TWO - and they were really small (my friend had 3 slices in hers). There wasn't enough meat in the ramen for the meaty punch - rather disappointing. Terribly overpriced at $14.

Ippudo was on my list of restaurants to eat at on a trip to NYC. It came recommended from a few of my New Yorker friends, and I love noodles. The Wait: Ippudo does not take reservations over the phone, but you can make a same day reservation in person. I went to Ippudo at 5:00pm to make a reservation for later that night for a party of 9. They had an 8:30pm reservation available, but we decided to get put on the waitlist instead. It worked out perfectly because Strand Bookstore is only 1 or 2 blocks away and it's easy to spend 2 hours there while waiting. Our party was seated ~6:45 pm. The place was packed. Decor/Ambiance: The wall behind the bar is decorated with rows of noodle bowls in different styles and sizes. The bar has a glass top encased with uncooked ramen noodles. The focal point of the dining room is a massive bamboo tree. There is an open kitchen. The decor is modern and a little funky, and the ambiance is fun. Service: Service was okay. It wasn't exceptional or terrible. Cocktails: I had the Sawakaze (Shochu, Ginger, Soda). It's super fresh and gingery. Someone at my table ordered the Grapefruit Hai (Shochu, Grapefruit, Soda). Our waitress dropped off a glass of Shochu and soda and half a grapefruit on top of a squeezer at the table and walked away without a word. I guess you are supposed to squeeze the juice out of the grapefruit yourself and add it to the cocktail? It was a bit strange. I tried this drink and it was good (super fresh and grapefruit-y), but I don't know anyone who enjoys squeezing citrus fruits. Food: I ordered the Maguro Tartar, the Samurai Ribs, and the Kasane Black ramen noodles. The tuna in the Maguro Tartar was fresh. The Samurai Ribs were exceptional. Presentation of this dish was beautiful, and the ribs itself were fall off the bone tender and served with a very flavorful sauce. The ramen noodles were as good as ramen noodles can be. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the broth was flavorful (Note: I added Bakudan, the spicy paste, to my dish. I need spice in my Asian food, so I would've found the broth a little lacking without the spicy paste). I am not a ramen noodle expert by any means, so I don't have a list of restaurants to compare Ippudo to, but I enjoyed the dish. Final Thoughts: If you are not a big fan of noodle soup to begin with, then Ippudo isn't for you. If you are, then I think it's a good place to go to once in a while for a ramen noodle splurge.

There are no words to describe the pleasure that is Ippudo NY. Ordered the Akamaru Ramen... It was unbelievably divine. If I could pick one meal to have in NYC, it would be here at Ippudo NY.

This place is so very good. Order anything. I've had the pork buns, akamaru modern ramen and duck. Everything was delicious. Cons: The wait is almost always long. Coming here at an off time and with a smaller group may help. NO RESERVATIONS. Luckily, there are plenty of places to walk in the area while you are waiting. Bathrooms are all the way downstairs. Pros: Besides the good food, the best part of this place is that they are accomodating to those with allergies. Very friendly people here.

Have been dying to come here for forever but finally got seated yesterday, which was surprisingly uncrowded for a Saturday night. Let me start off by saying I love the ambiance of the place. It's dark, romantic, and trendy. The place is covered in mirrors and everything feels really zen. When you walk into the seating area you are immediately greeted by all the waitstaff with big happy hello's in Japanese. Even the chefs yell across the room to greet you. All the waitresses were extremely friendly, which made ordering easier. I ordered the avocado and tofu tartar for my appetizer and my friend got the pork belly buns. The buns were absolutely amazing. Way better than any other place's I've had including Jum Mum and Jebon. My friend even claimed it to be better than Momofuku's, which is $10 for two, while Ippudo's is only $8 for two. I loved my tartar. The tofu was incredibly soft, as well as the avocado. The sauces were flavorful, although I wish they had given me a bit more. It was served on a large plate with little see-through noodle bits, which added a nice contrasting crunch to the light dish. Finally, the ramen came out. We both ordered the akamaru modern, for $15 a bowl, and $2 for additional toppings. All I can say was that it was amazing. The soup was full of flavor without any of that fake powder floating around like in most other ramen places. The noodles were cooked to al dente and the serving was quite large. My friend liked it so much he got an additional serving, which they bring out to you for only an additional $2. Although the place isn't cheap, I thought it was well worth the money. I will definitely come back again to try out the other interesting appetizers and ramen.

I get it, there's a lot of hype about Ippudo and the insane wait times can lead to unrealistically high expectations. ÊBut after eating my way through many ramen spots in the city, I still come back to Ippudo time and again. Ê The key standouts are the pork buns (seriously amazing) and the ramen broth, making this my preferred ramen noshing locale. Pork buns are simple, fatty pork belly slices (2-3 per bun) with iceberg lettuce, zingy mayo and soft, doughy, slightly sweet buns with a squirt of Sriracha. You get 2 buns per order and I frequently find that each person needs his/her own order. The ramen broth is amazingly smoky and complex. ÊI definitely recommend for your first time getting the Akamaru Modern and then later branching out into their other flavors, like the Wasabi ramen. Ê The decor is surprisingly sophisticated; subtle touches of color and patterned clothes, mosaics made out of sequins and dark wood make up the palate. ÊOnce you are whisked inside, away from the madness of the crowded lobby, the restaurant itself is spacious and doesn't feel crowded. ÊBe prepared to potentially share a table, but as soon as your steaming bowl of ramen gets set down in front of you, all you'll think about is slurping as quickly as possible without burning your mouth.

I've only been here twice but each time was amazing! I am planning on going back as much as possible. I love eating ramen and Ippudo makes the best fresh ramen. Don't get me wrong, I could eat those fried 10 cent packets of ramen everyday but I do enjoy a freshly made noodle. I tried the spicy garakamen (I think that's how you spell it) with a 3 dollar eel bowl and little side salad. The noodles were fresh and the chasew (pork) inside the ramen was excellent! The eel was fresh as well and didn't have any hint of a fishy flavor. I will definitely come back here when I can. I found out you have to come around 11am-12pm if you don't want to wait for an hour+ to get a seat.

The Pork Hirata Buns are so tender, succulent, to die for. I recommend the Bakuretsu Tofu appetizer to sizzle your mouth for the next best thing on the menu: the Akamuru Modern. I added a much needed egg to my dish because there was a lack of pork, cabbage, and mushrooms. For dessert you should definitely get the Mascarpone Cheese and Ice Cream plus the Annin Sorbet. For the Sorbet, choose the PEAR flavor! It's a wonderful light and sweet treat that really hits the spot after the savory main course dishes. Ambiance was beautiful and dark. Make sure you get there early because the line is freakin' long.

Came here early at 4:30 for an early and quick dinner before we caught our flight bak to Atlanta. Outside was a cold and dreary day, inside was an explosion of Japanese pop culture. ÊEven though it was pretty early, the place was packed and we had a fifteen minute wait at the bar. Once you go into the main dining room, you are instantly assaulted with enthusiastic screams of Konnichiwa, and the open kitchen is on full display as cooks boil ramen and man the grill. Known for its tonkotsu ramen, the broth is the best I've had, and I've been to LA, the other mecca for ramen. ÊRich and full of umami, it was perfect for a cold New York day.

Had to come here on my first trip to New York. On a Thursday afternoon at 1pm, WE ONLY WAITED 5 MINUTES FOR A TABLE!! Now you know when to come to avoid the wait. Tried the steamed pork belly buns, original broth ramen, and fried chicken rice bowl. All were good, I wasn't a huge fan of the amount of mayonnaise in the buns and rice bowl but I also can't stand the stuff. The pork Êbelly was cooked very nicely and the broth was DELICIOUS. I miiiight prefer the noodles from a certain ramen place in LA (no, not Daikokuya but Santouka in the Japanese supermarket). Just saying. Overall a great dining experience. The way they welcome you into their dining room and announce (well, yell) as they bring the food to your table is really fun. I can see why so many people like this place. Tip: skip dessert at Ippudo and go to Momofuku Milk Bar afterwards for a compost cookie or slice of crack pie! It's super close, only 5-6 blocks away.

Mehhhhhh - I think this place is hyped up to be extraordinary, but really - it's a bag of Ramen noodles, mixed with a few other things, and bam...check comes... $50 dollars for two meals of Ramen Noodles? Come on now -- at most that had to cost them like 20 cents to make! AND - there's just nothing that magnificent about the food, honestly. Reading some of these other reviews, I think somehow these people have been brainwashed just to agree that the food is good, but it's not..

It is just not worth the wait. Ramen is supposed to be a working class, eat it and get the hell out kind of meal. Not that it shouldn't be good. But the other offerings on the menu and the table service imply that they want you to stay and try other things like their pork buns (??? it's a ramen place, why are there buns?) and maybe even have a drink or two. The ramen itself is good. A decent bowl. The spicy miso one does not do justice to the broth that they are able to make; I suggest the lighter flavored ones as they do a better job with those. They have fresh and springy noodles. For my money, though, I would still rather go to Totto Ramen. They have a smaller menu and a smaller restaurant but to me they are much more 'real' -- as in, closer to the authentic experience of a cramped little ramen-ya in Tokyo.

Yum-Meeee! What a cute place. We got there right before the lunch rush on a friday and was greeted by yelling japanese happy waitstaff. I had a glass of the Miyasaka (Nagano) sake. Pretty big shot. Lunch consist of appetizers- Shishito Flash-fried Japanese peppers with yuzu salt. Its a must try because the texture and heat mixed with the salt was so good. Can't just have one. Tako Wasabi-Raw baby octopus in fresh chopped wasabi sauce. all i can say it was interesting. Not my fav. Hirata Chicken Wings-pretty tasty sauce. Tori Ramen w/Kakuni-Ippudo's "Chintan" clear chicken and pork noodle soup topped with pork loin chashu, memma, kaiware radish, naruto, shiso leaf, and daikon radish & daikon. That was slurping good. Yes, a bit pricey for ramen but on a chilly winter morning all I crave are those noodles with the hearty steaming broth!

Went this past Wednesday evening around 6:15 pm. Wait was only 15 minutes. Sat at the "bar" in front of the kitchen- which at first was skeptical about because of the lack of privacy, but it turned out to be great. We were able to watch the chefs work their magic and prepare all the different wonderful dishes. With each plate that went out, I got hungrier and hungrier! We dined on: Hirata Pork Buns- The pork buns lived up to the hype! The buns were soft, light and fluffy. Almost marshmallow-like. And the marinated pork itself was very tender and flavorful. The description of the sauce is "spicy." But it's not hot spicy. It gives it the perfect kick of flavor. A definite must try. Maguro Tartar- ÊThe lightly seared tuan infused with garlic soy and shiso oil was perfect. Not too heavy or oily. Akamaru Modern Ramen - Oh lord, where do I begin! ÊSimply put- this pork-based broth is amazing! At first glance, it doesn't look so appetizing. But once you give it a good stir, and dig in, every preconception you had quickly vanishes! So many wonderful ingredients infused together to create a masterpiece! I can clearly see why this Ramen is a favorite! I could drink the broth alone all day long! Next time I look forward to trying the short ribs - as they looked mouth-watering, and the Hirata fried chicken. This place is a definite gem! I highly recommend! Notes: The place is loud. Lot's of yelling going on - but fun! So avoid if you're looking for a quiet dining experience. The Plum wine was lackluster. Probably the worst I've had.

Ê I Yelped this establishment and ventured all the way down from the upper east side.. and was disappointed at various levels. ÊSince most of the reviews had a high star rating, I decided to wait and give this place an opportunity to taste the ramen. Ê The wait: ÊThe systematic way of sequencing patrons getting seated is very questionable. ÊBoth their website and Yelp state that Ippudo does not take reservations. ÊWhile waiting, I was forced to observe this restaurant's seating system. ÊIt was noticeable that there was a reservation system. ÊPhone calls were being answered with names being jotted down on a separate list. ÊPatrons who came much later were getting seated as soon as they walked in or very shortly after. Ê To Management: it would be very appreciated that you either update your information on your site or give all your patrons equal consumption opportunity on a first come first serve basis. Ê The food: Êthe spicy ramen was mediocre, not memorable. ÊIt was simple ramen that was definitely not worth the wait. ÊThe classic was not as tasty- had a pungent pork odor. ÊPortions were slightly on the smaller side. ÊThere are definitely better ramen establishments around. Ê Ê If you're craving savory pork buns, stop by the bar and order some. ÊThey'll come out in a snap! ÊIf you are craving ramen and you don't mind a very long wait, good luck!

I heart Ramen! Since I was on vacation, I came here in the middle of a workday. Even so, the wait was still about 30 minutes. But it was definitely worth it. =) I heard if you finish all the noodles, they come by and give you more. I wish I heard this tip before i tried ippudo though! perhaps it'll work for you!

O Ippudo, king of ramen... you are responsible for my ramenmania but no matter how far i go or how long i wait for ramen around NYC no one has been able to steal your place in my heart. yum yum yum! There's a wait... a long one, duh. Come early before the first seating of lunch or dinner and you can cut that wait down a notch. In any case, it's worth it. Noodle bowls are large (although some may argue not large enough for the price tag) and filled with perfectly thin noodles with just the right amount of chewy. ÊSecond to the ramen are delicious, fluffy, spicy little roast pork buns. A must for appetizer (even if it means your not cleaning out the ramen bowl) If going for lunch, the lunch set is a good deal, around $3 more than just ramen and comes with a side of rice (different options) and a mini salad. A ton of food, seriously there should be a challenge wall of fame for people who can finish this and go back to work for the rest of the day.

I love Ippudo. And Im pretty sure Ippudo loves me back. because every single time I've been there, its been just as incredible as the first. Not many restaurants can do that. Anyway, the pork buns. ALMOST make the ramen forgettable. ALMOST. the pork buns are two per order and come steaming hot with white fluffy buns stuffed with a slice of perfectly tender pork belly. If I haven't made it very clear, GET THE PORK BUNS. (Oh, and as a side note, some people think that the pork buns at Momofuku are better. uhm. no. The only thing that Momofuku makes that is better than Ippudo is the Compost cookie. And that's only because Ippudo doesn't make cookies. I'm convinced that if they did, they'd be better at Ippudo.) Anyway, as far as the ramen..I always get the Akamaru Modern. The broth is really thick and smoky and I absolutely love it. For you guys who aren't satisfied with just one bowl, if you ration your broth you can order the kae-dama which is another serving of noodles. Not bad for just two more bucks. (another side note, if you're in NJ, check out Mitsuwa Marketplace in Edgewater...they have a ramen section there that makes comparable ramen. It's not as good but its half the price and you won't have to pay the ridiculous 12 dollar toll to get to Ippudo in NY)

I can't say anything that hasn't already been said - The waits are long but I've never had a bad dish here, and there's a bar around the corner to get a beer while you wait. The pork buns are amazing, and in a different league than Momofuku's. The shisito peppers are tasty. The ramens are heavenly. ÊAll of them. ÊWith seasoned eggs and spicy paste and ... just heavenly. Ê Fun atmosphere.

I don't understand what the big deal is. ÊI have not found the ramen at Ippudo memorable in anyway. ÊIt's always way too busy & they do not take reservations. ÊI never eat the pork in my ramen here. ÊThe prices are way too high for ramen. I accidentally went to an Ippudo in Kyoto & it blew my mind. ÊThat Ippudo puts this one to shame. ÊI did enjoy the mid to late 90's music mix that brought me back to my earlier days. Save your money & make your stomach happy by going to Jin Ramen on 125th & Broadway.

So it turns out I've been here twice. The first time, I'm told I was too drunk to really remember what the hell we ate. I do remember being pleased and full and then passing out later. As I result, I knew I had to come back again. This is definitely the hippest ramen spot I've ever been to. Way fancier than the Ippudo I've been to in Japan. The chicken wings were spicy and sweet, but most importantly, tasty! Ippudo's ramen has good broth, meat, and a soft-boiled egg. I'm not a fan of thin noodles, but this was still a great experience.

After coming here a bunch more times, I have settled on the Shiromaru Hakata Classic and the hirata buns as my go-to order. As much as I hate paying $15 for a bowl of ramen and $9 for the buns, they are totally worth it. I have not been able to locate a better bowl of ramen, (un)fortunately. PS: When you order a ramen that comes with a heap of minced garlic in the middle (Karaka Miso Ramen for example), the waiters will recommend you to blend it into the soup. DON'T DO IT. Even if you like garlic, the heap is totally overpowering. Just take the whole lump out, otherwise you wouldn't be able to taste the complexity of the soup at all. HEED MY WARNINGS!

Ordered the akamaru modern. Must have been sort of an off-day. I found the broth a bit lacking. But the noodles were cooked well and the pork belly was fatty and soft. Solid 4-star discounting the buzz. I'd definitely avoid this place if I had to wait in line. Still glad I tried it.

Walking around the streets of NY can get very cold. Best way to warm the soul, at least for me, is a nice hot bowl of ramen and this place sure did the trick. I got the limited time special ramen Kasane Black. Black garlic oil sounded interesting to me and I had to see what it tasted like. Now this was not your average ramen. The broth was much darker from the black garlic oil and tasted richer then what you would expect from a tonkatsu, miso, or shoyu ramen. The meat was nice and soft and I loved the mushrooms. Everything in the bowl all just married together. Comparing the broth of my friends Akamaru Modern I think mine was better. Well I did pay more for my dish. Definitely different from the ramen I am use to. Muy Delicioso!!!

I ordered the Akamaru Modern with Pork Belly and Bakudan (spicy paste) as recommended by the waitress and I was in ramen heaven. The noodles were good. Not too soggy and not too hard. Ê The pork belly was a good mix of fat, I mean deliciousness, and meat. The second best part was the Bakudan (spicy paste)...I could eat that stuff by the spoonful. The best part was the broth!!!! If I could combine the broth with Pho noodles, oh man, that would be the best soup noodle dish ever. I could drink the broth by the cup.....sadly

3.5 --Good ramen, but it did not live up to the hype and hour long wait for two people. The staff was friendly for the most part. The Best thing to do, is to go here without any expectations whatsoever, and order the akamaru modern. Don't waste your money on the extra sides though! I got an extra side of their bakudan spicy paste, and barely used it. Why? It wasn't even spicy, and had a odd floral taste to it. My rating would probably bump up a star if I had tried the pork buns, but that'll have to wait for another visit :P Another thing to note is that its expensive. Ramen $14 + Bakudan $2 is a bit much in my opinion for Ramen.

I let Yelp choose my meal and went with the Akamaru Modern ramen and an order of the pork buns. ÊDon't judge! ÊIt was my first meal of the day after a 5 hour flight from SF, alright? ÊFirst of all, yes, it is overpriced and not worth waiting an hour+ for, but having said that it's still a very tasty meal in a great atmosphere. I went straight there from the airport, luggage and all, and arrived about 10 minutes before it opened for dinner so the wait was minimal. ÊI was kindly seated at a communal table with room with my luggage and the service was very friendly. ÊThe pork buns came first and were soooooo tasty! ÊI would eat them all day if I could - and thought they were worlds better than the ones I had at Momofuku Ssam bar (but I'm not a fatty pork belly fan). The ramen broth was so delicious, I was tempted to actually drink it all, and the noodles were unlike any I recall having before - much thinner and more al dente. ÊAs I would hope for $16, the bowl was actually a decent size and had me pretty stuffed, especially after eating a pork bun, but after learning that taking food home was against the rules I powered through, finishing my bowl of noodles and the second bun. ÊGoing full-fatty never felt so good. Ê:) Next time I'm in town I would love to eat there again, but I'm pretty sure I'd have to pass unless I went at a time when I could be seated in 30 minutes or less. ÊI could practically smell the ramen as soon as I got out of the subway, so having to wait outside for hours sounds super miserable. ÊPlus, having tried Ippudo, touted by some as "the best in the US," I can soundly say that there are some damn decent places around SF so that's a great take-away from this meal.

Yes, Ippudo, you are pretty darn delicious and I am a fan. But it is pricey and sometimes I cannot stand waiting in line for more than 45 minutes just to get seated and then another 15-20 to get my food. The interior is absolutely themed and I liked how you can see them making the ramen. It's really fun to enter the restaurant because they all yell "welcome!" in japanese when you walk in. And the staff is so friendly, they all say thank you and greet you when you leave and when you come in. I love all the ramens, They all taste delicious and divine. I even love the specials they have for a limited time. It's great. You have to go if you're ever visiting New York. There's a reason why it has more than 3K awesome reviews!!

Akamaru Modern + Nitamago + Kakuni Ê= over $20 for my bowl of ramen. It was good, but not as good as I thought it would be. The pork belly could have been..more...dare I say..fatty? I also wasn't that big of a fan of the noodles. The crowd gets kinda nasty during lunch, when I came here. By "nasty," I mean...super grouchy about the wait. Even though they estimated it would take 45 minutes, we got called about 15-20 minutes in. Tea is served at the end of the meal, which is a nice touch! The service is also pretty good and efficient here.

I never really understood the hype around this place. Yes, the ramen is decent. And yes, the pork buns are good. But no, it's not really worth the amount of hype and attention that people give it! ÊAnd DEFINITELY not worth the 3 to 4 hours I've spent waiting! Call me impatient, but by the time we are FINALLY seated, I'm so miserable that I can't even enjoy the food. Or I order way too much food to make up for the fact that I've lost a good portion of my life waiting. Anyway, the ramen is okay. Not bad. But the appetizers are better. I like the Samurai Ribs, Shishito Peppers, and of course, the Hirata pork buns. Make sure to try these (if you do decide to sacrifice your life in line).

Since my review will mark the 3464th review of Ippudo, how much weight does it even have anymore? But I just want to say that the ramen here is mind blowing. We arrived from Chicago at about 9:30pm, checked into our hotel, and then headed to Ippudo. We got there at 10:30pm and there was an hour wait for a table for 2. We got the nigori sake and sapporo beer at the bar while waiting. The broth of the Akamaru ramen was so intensely flavorful that I didn't want my ramen journey to end. My husband got the Osakane ramen that was on special and he even ordered a second helping of noodle. We also ordered a side of the tako wasabi came with raw octopus that was addictive. Eating ramen in Chicago now will never be the same anymore, until Ippudo decides to open in Chicago. I'm hopeful.

You NewYorkers should be ashamed, how can you regard this level of food as praiseworthy? ÊIs it good? ÊKind of. ÊIs it great? ÊOf course not! ÊWhat have you never tried a good ramen place before or something? ÊExtremely American Fusion themed, all white people working forced to speak sloppy japanese cliche lines that are actually quite annoying. ÊThe vibe is too forced and the price is jacked up so much because it's a hipster joint. ÊMakes me disgusted that hype still fuels reviews, what because you have a bunch of people trying to say Itterashai and Arigato you guys think it's cool and awesome? ÊThe broth itself is good but not great and it gets compromised by the pickled veggies they drown it in.

Went to Ippudo on a Tuesday afternoon, around 5:30 pm, with intentions of only ordering the pork buns, so we went straight to the bar where there were only 1-2 people there. The buns came out within 5-10 mins of ordering them and they were delicious! A little spicy for me because i can't handle any heat at all. But the pork was well marinated and had lots of flavor. The bun was warm and soft. A single order came with 2 pieces for $9, a little pricy, but work trying. Oh! And happy hour had 2 for 1 deals. *review was for April 2011 visit

definitely overrated. porkbuns are good but the sauce a bit overpowering and a bit salty. iono maybe i just got a bad one. the ramen is good. i've tried their classic, akamaru modern and even their special black sesame ramen. They are good but not phenomenal. my favorite out of the three would be the modern - very garlicky. if you have the time and the patience, its worth a try. however, for me, its not worth it to wait more than an hour for this. there are definitely better ramen places out there.

Get to the Chase: Pros: 1) The pork buns are absolutely amazing 2) The ramen is pretty well put together and quite satisfying with a beer! The additional ramen noodles for $3 if you have broth/soup left is also a great idea! 3) The venue is very well decorated and on the wall's you can see all the different types of ramen bowls, with the traditional "Irasshaimase!" yelled out when you get seated Cons: 1) I put 3 stars, because the ramen was especially greasy....I've visited Tokyo, Okinawa, and the north of Japan and have never tasted a ramen that made you feel like a lining of oil was left in the back of your throat. 2) For the no reservations allowed and the 1-2 hour wait-time, it's not worth the wait 3) Basically I've had better for the time and money I have to exchange for a bowl of good-satisfying-hit-the-spot ramen

Akamaru Modern ($14 at lunch): Tonkotsu pork bone broth with "Umami Dama" miso paste, handmade noodles, fragrant garlic oil, cabbage, kikurage, scallions, and sliced chashu pork. A soft boiled egg for $2 is a great addition. I loved the Akamaru Modern, but next time I want to try the Shiromaru Hakata Classic, which doesn't have the miso paste and comes with slightly different toppings. The pork buns were just okay. At Ippudo, the ramen is where it's at! We got here before they opened and were able to get a seat without too much of a wait, but I've heard of wait times longer than an hour if you get here during the rush (which seems to be pretty much anytime).

I was expecting a whole lot of amazing ramen considering the massive hype surrounding this place. I got here 15 minutes after dinner opened and they were already predicting a long wait, but I was able to sweet talk the hostess into seating me right away! B-) Ordered the "kasane black" tonkotsu in a pork and chicken infused broth with pork loin, fish cake, black garlic oil and 3 pieces of pork belly on the side ($ extra). The broth was somewhat disappointing as I was expecting more complex flavors. Instead it tasted rather bland (if not a bit salty). 1 fish cake, which was so tiny and flavorless. Not impressed with the two pieces of pork loin. Noodles were also not to my expectations considering the lack of a good bite and firmness. Compared to the ramen I had in Tokyo this captures some of the essence, but falls short dramatically in many areas, most specifically in the broth. I just was not interested in finishing it. I do recommend ordering the pork belly on the side as it basically changes the entire character of the meal. Without it, I think it would've been a rather bland meal as a whole. Service is great. The waitresses are sweet and attentive. I would come again, but not if I had to wait any longer than 30 minutes. $16 for ramen is really expensive. My bowl was really just noodles, two pieces of pork loin, and a fish cake with some vegetables. There's no way those ingredients by themselves cost more than $3. So why was my bowl of ramen $16?! I think that the hype surrounding this place is a lot of people trying to justify the amount of time they waited in line. Honestly, there's nothing here that I haven't had before in LA or the Bay Area. My rating does rate Ippudo relative to other ramen shops in japan and taiwan because a lot of people have ranked this place as the closest thing you can get to legit ramen in NYC.

I must say this place is a BIT overrated and overhyped but its GOOD don't get me wrong..i was expecting the BEST ramen in the city but I wouldn't go that far as to saying it is. I went around 2pm there wasn't a really wait. However, the pork buns is something totally different. That was AMAZING. I got the famous akamaru modern and it tasted extremely sodium-y. It was just decent and I will probably go back just for the pork buns....Service was nice though!

Oh Ippudo, how I long for your bold flavorful broth too frequently... The beaux and I hit this ramen place during our food venture in NYC. With all the existing great reviews, we had to stop for a meal. We started with Tako Wasabi, raw baby octopus with fresh wasabi sauce. It came in a tiny side-dish bowl, with a slice of lemon holding up the raw octopus. The lemon's sharp acidity cut through the fishy-ness of the octopus and the wasabi added great flavor to it. I had the Miso Ramen with poached egg, which was perfectly cooked (with cooked whites but runny yolk) in the delectable broth. The noodles had the prime texture for ramen. I was also able to try the beaux's, who ordered the Akamaru Modern with Kakuni, the braised pork belly. The moment he tried his bowl, he looked like he was floating in serenity. I tried the broth, which was as savory as it could be. The flavor was strong, but kept your palate longing for more. His noodles were a little thicker, but were still tasty. The atmosphere is a bit loud and busy, with the waiters/waitresses yelling Japanese words (or maybe some were even shouting random syllables for the fun of it) to heighten the atmosphere. By the time we walked out the restaurant, the main waiting area was PACKED with people. I was super glad we beat the dinner crowd! Ippudo NY is definitely a must-go for anyone who loves ramen. I will definitely be returning when I visit NY again :)

Pork Buns are a must!!!! They are so soft, flavorful and will bring and unexpected surprise in your mouth! The ramen noodles are very large and have a unique flavor compared to the typical ramen you may be used to. I had to wait about 30 minutes to eat here but it was worth the wait.

more pricy than totto ramen but the ambiance is way better. I feel the totto ramen broth was more meaty and the ippudo soup base were more clear. both were good i guess. I'd probably come back here more often since the seating is way better here. wish i could give this a 4.5-star. the service is great, very friendly staff. the only minor drawback is probably that it's not exactly the best value - but not exactly a rip off either, especially for the pleasant ambiance and experience.

First of all, ramen has never been something I crave...I can count the times I've had ramen (excluding the packaged kind) on one hand. As far as noodle soups go, I prefer Vietnamese. Not a fan of the wait...1 hr and 20 or so min...but at least they got decent happy hour to compensate. I had the Akamaru modern. It was good, but just as good as you would expect food to be at a restaurant. But not good enough to justify the $15 a bowl and 1.5 hr wait...there was a rather pathetic # (3?) slices of pork (granted, it was good) and not much else besides noodles and soup. I enjoyed the meal more for the company than the food...

I am ashamed to have waited 2 hours with my family for a table on a Sunday night. Well worth the wait... The ramen is refined. ÊI thought Santouka in LA was good. ÊIppudo is in another category and a separate league. Ê The broth is complex and smooth at the same time. ÊI usually do not drink the broth due to the high fat content, but I caught myself slurping it up. ÊThe miso paste brings another layer of nuttiness and texture to the broth. ÊThe noodles are perfectly cooked and chewy. ÊYummy, yummy, yummy. BTW. ÊThe pork buns and shishito appetizers were excellent as well.

The only other time I've had Ippudo ramen was from a box. Granted it was instant ramen from Japan that blows cup o noodle out of the water. The toppings in the for real restaurant is for sure better than dehydrated stuff. The soft boiled egg was perfectly cooked, the 2 slices of chashu was decently cooked, and the bamboo shoot wasn't drowned out like the ginger. However, I thought the broth was a tad too salty (and 1d) and the noodles were just okay. Service is efficient and nice. The wait for a table can be long even for that in-between time after lunch and before dinner. Unfortunately, I'm not sure the food lived up to what I expected for the price.

I came here during my visit to New York with a high expectation. Wrong turn. The first night, there were four of us, and we were told that the wait was 2 hours. Understandable it was Friday night, we ditched the idea. The following night, there were two of us and we decided to give it another shot. The wait was 1 hour. Still bad, but alright, we finally decided to wait. We ordered a cucumber appetizer-basically a japanese cucumber diced neatly into pieces, drizzled with their house sesame dashi and red pepper. This is a good, refreshing dish, enough to open up our apetite. Next, our ramen came. I ordered their modern style pork ramen with red miso and my friend had their special of the night-black something. I added a soft boiled egg that costs $2 into my ramen. Oh yes, their toppings are that expensive. Nothing below 2 bucks. I thought I've tasted better ramen in the Bay Area that what I was tasting. I mean, it wasn't all bad, in fact I remembered enjoying it so much I finished the entire contents in the bowl. But, with the impressive wait time, it's almost mere the worth. The bill came down to $50 ($10 tip) = $60 Ramen for 2. Woo! I'd spent som' like that at other East Village eateries.

Holy crap the wait is long for this place... but man, it is worth it. My boyfriend and I hit up this place on our last trip to New York because... well it's the highest reviewed place in ALL of New York on Yelp. We just had to give it a shot. And the 3000+ reviews do not lie. The insane thing is we went somewhat near closing time (around 10 pm) because we were expecting the wait and were hoping to catch the tail end of the dinner rush... and it was still a 2 hour wait. That's how good this place it. A quick tip though... don't bother waiting in line... like actually waiting in line. There's this speakeasy round the corner not too far from Ippudo NY that my boyfriend and I went to while waiting for this place to clear up called Angel's Share. Look it up... it's seriously good. We spent about two hours, taking in the amazing atmosphere that is New York before trekking back to Ippudo *just* in time to get a table. Crazy perfect timing. Just put your name down for a table and ask the waiter/waitress approximately how long you have and plan to be back slightly before and it'll work out great. The inside of this place is pretty unique. The food, even more unique. Plus, this place inspired us to try the original Ippudo in Japan. We ordered the Akamaru Modern and the Wasabi Shoyu Ramen. Both were heavenly! In fact, when we went to Japan a few months later, it seems this place really matches up with "real" ramen :D The Akamaru Modern had such a depth of flavor with the tonkatsu broth that I can't really describe it. I actually preferred the broth of the wasabi shoyu ramen because it was something I'd never tasted before; the slight hint of wasabi complimented the soup incredibly well (so much that my boyfriend drank almost the whole thing O.o). Very unique, and highly recommended. All the toppings complemented the ramen so well too... Their service is a bit spotty at times, but I never felt neglected at any point in my meal. Plus, my boyfriend managed to get a kae-dama in for extra noodles, which meant twice the ramen awesomeness~! (hint: don't drink all the broth before you ask for this... this is actually a pretty common practice in Japanese ramen shops in Japan). The noodles were cooked perfectly too... oh how I wish I could go back to this place soon :D This is probably the closest you can get to actual Japanese ramen (even in price range with the $15 bowl of ramen... lol). There are some small differences of course, but this is hands down the best ramen I've EVER had in the United States.

We took a group of friends who was visiting NYC for the first time to try this place. ÊIt's been about 6 months since the fiance and I were here. The wait was about 45mins for a table of 6 around 9:15pm on Thursday. ÊThe wait is always questionable every time - is it really worth the wait?? ÊSince we've been raving about this ramen place to our friends, we had to wait how ever long it would be just so they can try this place out. ÊLuckily, they all agree that it was well worth the wait. I didn't give this place 5 stars only because the wait is ridiculous - i think its about time to do an expansion. The wait area is small and on a cold NYC night no one likes to wait outside. The food is just as awesome as the first time we tried the place - we got the steam pork buns for appetizer and we got them for dessert (yeah they were still that good). Ê*Tip - they don't to go the steam buns* I finally got to try the Shishito peppers and OMG they are sooooo delicious (I LOVE THEM!!) Êour usual order is the Akamaru Modern w/ extra noodles and for dessert we got the Mascarpone Cheese and Ice Cream. ÊAll of the food was delicious... our check came out to be a little over $200 for - 4 ramen, 1 extra noodles, 5 orders of the pork bun, 1 dessert, 1 order of the peppers, 2 cokes, & 3 beers. This place is still pretty pricy but it was worth the splurge since we don't get to come here often and with our friends The service was pretty good except for when I first approach the hostess station - a little stuck up; they didn't acknowledge my existence until about 30secs of standing in front of their faces looking at them dead in the eye (all three of them). ÊAfter that, they were okay; I guess they were extremely busy... but still smile and just say "hold on a sec" ÊI understand you're busy, I can see it. I hate to admit but this place is still one of my favorite Ramen restaurant despite the wait time. If you're going to try the place make sure you allot about 2-2.5hrs for this place.

We've got great ramen here in LA with the Big 3 (Shin-Sen-Gumi, Daikokouya, and Santouka) reppin hard, but NY is home to the most highly revered ramen joint in the world, Ippudo. ÊA title they clearly deserve. Ê During my visit I got the Akamaru Modern which was nice and porky just the way that I like it. ÊThe ramen is served piping hot with their signature "Umami Dama" miso paste, handmade noodles, black garlic oil, cabbage, kikurage, scallions, and a few slices of perfectly fatty pork. ÊI also opted to add a seasoned soft boiled egg for added texture and flavor, and I suggest you do the same cause they do it right up in here. ÊDefinitely one of the best bowls of ramen I have ever had. Ê We also decided to share a couple orders of the Hirata Pork Buns, which were absolutely delicious. ÊThe pork was very tender and braised to perfection. Couldn't hurt to have a tad more belly up in those buns but there won't be any complaining here because I gobble those suckers up like it was my job. I would also recommend getting the samurai ribs, and while I have yet to try them, my friend will not stop raving about how deliciou and tender they are. ÊNext time I guess, and for those of you reading this, be advised you still have time so do whats good for you and place an order upon arrival. Overall I would say that Ippudo delivers on flavor, quality, service, and selection. ÊThey have several varieties of ramen to choose from as well as a slew of appetizers to keep you busy, until your ramen masterpiece makes it grand entrance. Ê APPROVED!!!

My first (and definitely not last) time dining at Ippudo NY will from here on out be known as 'The Day I Broke Down and Ate Meat.' See, I'm a recently born-again pescetarian. The only animals i pillage are of the seafood variety. However, good ramen minus the pork does not compute. So, onto the meat-fest extravaganza. Ê Our wait? Not long at all. There was a bit of a crowd waiting to be seated but I guess it pays to get there early. Pro-tip: the bar maid mixes a dangerously good lychee martini. Sip slowly for your own safety. The food: Harata Buns (Pork and Veggie) - Let me make this clear... I love me some pork buns. And Ippudo's were delish. HOWEVER, I have had better. What really surprised me was how much the veggie buns blew the pork buns away in both flavor and texture. I dunno what kind of black magic was enlisted to create this wonderful morsel, but eggplant and mushrooms never made me want to take it out behind the school and get it pregnant before. It's that real. Samurai Rib - This right here was tender and flavored simply. Nothing fancy happening here, but it's worth ordering if only for a slight departure from everything else texture wise. And now, the ramen... Karaka Miso Ramen - If the bowl my ramen was served in was any bigger, I'm sure I would've tried to dive right in there. How many adjectives can I use unnecessarily to describe this dish. LET'S SEE! Comforting, spicy (but not too spicy), tender (THE PORK), flavorful, Êcoma-inducing, sinus-clearing, dance-in-your-pants spectacular, etc. All in all, it was honestly some of the best ramen I've ever had. A close second to my current, hands down favorite (i'm not telling).

This ramen is amazing. Ê Yes. ÊThe wait is long. ÊSo put your name in and go take a walk. Yes. ÊIt is not a cozy and authentic little shop like Totto Ramen. ÊBut guess what? ÊThe food's four times as good. ÊTotto Ramen with a restaurant that big would still just have their dozen of people in it because their broth is thin and flat. If you can't deal with the wait and you're stuck down there wondering where to go, I'd say Minca on 5th between A and B is your best bet. ÊThat being said... Ippudo is worth the wait. ÊOr get on the 6 train and head to Hide Chan. ÊEqually as delicious and their happy hour is amazing. All of the ramen is good at Ippudo, but on a rainy day, the Miso Ramen is my favorite. ÊAll that ginger will kick the cold. Ê This is one of the few restaurants that I say is a must for any travelers to NY... just because, in the vast majority of America, you won't find anything like it.

When it comes to ramen in this city Ippudo is one of the best. Other than Totto Ramen this restaurant has no real contenders in the realm of ramen. The Akamaru Modern is their steaming, crowning glory, and you'll be impressed with its complex flavors. The other night I discovered a fantastic appetizer here--Renkon Age--made of thinly sliced fried lotus root chips and topped seasoning. The lotus root is actually the Êrhizome of the lotus plant and very popular throughout Asia. I have only had it boiled in soups and was pretty floored by this dish! The root is delicately sliced, fried, and pretty spicy. It tastes a little like fried yucca chips. I wish Ippudo would package this into a product so I can buy bags of these things and eat them at home instead of always trekking downtown to have them at the restaurant! UPDATE (5/15/2012): in the world of food there is no such thing as "equally as good". The best are the best because no one else does it better. After trying out Totto Ramen recently I had to dock a star from Ippudo, now the 2nd best ramen place in NY in my book.

The place was not too packed when I went. We only waited 20 minutes. The interior is spacious and cute. I ordered the akamaru modern and my friend got something else. They both honestly tasted the same. It was also too salty for me but it could have been the pork. They give you pretty good amount of food to fill you up and a cup of hot tea to probably erase that feeling of fat and greasiness you just took in.

The best ramen I've ever had in my life. I've heard high reviews about Ippudo and I also knew that it was quite pricey, so I basically came into it wanting a good meal. My friend who works there told me to reserve on the day of several hours in advance because they fill up VERY QUICKLY! I got the Akamaru Modern and the large bowl came in about 10 minutes.

With 3K+ reviews for Ippudo, not sure how much of an impact mine will add butttttt... here goes anyway! Friday night, 8:30PM. Even in a rainy torrential downpour, NYers need their ramen fix! I expected a 2hr+ wait and correctomundo I was - 2-2.5hours we were quoted. About 1.5hrs later we came back to check up on our wait and they sat us right away. Note that we were a party of 2. We were seated at a communal table (as per usual), but still had our privacy to speak freely. We went with an order of the f'ing amazing pork buns & the special ramen of the day - Kasane Black. Apparently they change up their menus quite often so some of their supposedly amazing appetizers were no longer there *wompwomp* This was my 3rd time at Ippudo & I still think the ramen ($16) is overpriced and super salty. I'm also a huge fan of thick noodles so the slippery thin noodles they serve didn't satisfy me. The pork buns were the best I've tried by far in the city - def come here and get an order or two of these! I hear you can just order them at the bar so you don't even have to endure the 1hr+ waits!

Ummm, alright, I don't really know where to begin. Ever since I tried going a year ago and was unsuccessful, because of the three hour wait - I was determined to return. Prepared to hear there would be an astronomical wait, we graciously accepted the two hour wait limit and grabbed some drinks around the corner while I tried to keep my excitement contained. The service was friendly and prompt with their projected call when our table was ready. It took us a hot minute to walk through the NYC slush to get back to the restaurant, so I was tad nervous our coveted table would be given up to someone waiting and willing to slurp some savory broth. But, no, they waited and immediately sat us. I am sure the some 3300 reviews previous to this one mentions how the staff greets you when you walk in, but I am going to go ahead and mention it again. They yell to alert the restaurant of your arrival. Not sure where or at who the host is yelling at, but it definitely demands an excited response that makes you feel welcome and even more eager to eat! We, of course, ordered ramen and were beyond impressed. Each ingredient shined through, while the broth was the perfect temperature. It wasn't spicy, yet had a unique and inexplicable flavor. The pork buns as appetizers are also highly recommended from yours truly. Perfect size and texture to fill you up just right in order to tide you over for your ginormous noodle soup. Another fun perk - they will supplement your broth with fresh noodles, but only if they deem your broth worthy of some noodle reinforcement!

over an hour wait just to eat Ramen is not worth it. It is probably worth it for the pork buns but I am not sure because I didn't order it and I regret not trying it out.

I'm actually hovering between 2-3 stars for Ippudo, given that I've had it both in Singapore and New York and it's no longer really anything special but just another ramen joint to choose from. And to be honest, I hardly pick Ippudo because the wait is ridiculous. For example, I called at 8.30p on a Sunday and was told 'we're closed' without an explanation. When I asked what time the normal closing was, the reply was "11.30" (or whatever it is) and then when I pressed for an explanation, "the wait time exceesds our closing so we're not accepting any more customers." Sigh...Ippudo, why the hype? It's overpriced, the wait is RIDICULOUS (sometimes 2 hours for 2 people), and you have to eat at weird times like 5pm or 10pm (on a weekday) in order to wait a reasonable 15-30 mins. Good Hakata-style ramen, though. The Akamaru Modern is very tasty and the noodles could be cooked harder to bring out the texture more (I always ask for them to be harder - as they're done in Singapore - and my instructions have never come to fruition). Tip: whenever the menu states "pork loin chashu" as an ingredient, go the extra $3 and order an extra topping of normal pork chashu. Despite the fact that all their ramen are the same price ($15), the conversation I had with the waitress today showed me that you cannot exchange the dry, tasteless pork loin for the juicy, charred chashu, you have to order an extra side. Sigh. Also, absolutely unbearable ambience. Waitresses and line cooks shouting extremely loudly to each other every time a customer enters/exits or a dish makes its way out of the kitchen, music blaring, and as a result you have to shout to be heard across the table. I come out of here with my ears ringing sometimes. No, I do not consider my ears being blasted off as "fun", thanks.

I will have to agree with AJ-K on this one. ÊThe broth did have somewhat a different flavor than what I'm used to from the likes of Santouka and Shin Sen Gumi back at home in Southern California. ÊThe broth really isn't as rich, yet it was oily and had seasoning. ÊWhat I will say though is that the meat was super tender and that the pork buns were truly amazing. Our bill for two ramens with a couple of add-ons with a Kirin ended up to be about $45. ÊYes $45. Ê What do I have to say about all that? ÊI think anyone should go here at least once. ÊIt really isn't too bad of a place, but when we are talking price to value..I can not vouch for it...not especially when we have $10 ramen that has all the bells and whistles only a few miles away. ÊIt's not a place I miss, but I am happy that I at least was able to try it.

The wait sucks, but it's worth it. The pork buns are good. No way are they Momofuku good, but they are good. The ramen is top-knotch awesome. I prefer Ippudo's ramen to Hide-Chan and Momofuku any day. The noodles are tender, you can tell there was care put into making them. I love tonkotsu ramen and this place does it right. It's not cheap for soup, but this is better than your average soup. DC ramen joints stand no chance against Ippudo. The atmosphere is a bit chaotic. Waiters and waitresses chanting Japanese terms as food is coming out.

Friends brought me here for the first time, and I must say it was a lot of hype. I didn't want to spoil their moment in grace after waiting 40mins to be seated, but Ippudo does make some damn good ramen. The interior decor is nice, even from the bar sitting infront of the entrance, all the way to the packed tables in the back. The servers and waiters we're cool, but I'm just going to judge based on the food... The ramen was good, and pork buns were awesome, but expect to pay for what you ordered. I believe a majority of the ramen bowls we're around $17+? kinda on the pricey side, but definitely didn't matter since we came here completely hungover from the night (morning) just a few hours earlier.

My fiance and I were on a mission for really good ramen. ÊOff we went to Ippudo! It was 4:30 pm on a Sunday and there was an hour wait. ÊWhat? We thought we'd avoid the 7 pm rush hour but that kind of didn't work out as planned. ÊThe kicker was that at 7 pm it was much less busy. (# poop, taco #) Be prepared for it to be busy. ÊMaybe a call before coming in? The ambiance of the place was very cool. ÊIt was simple and elegant. ÊI'm too lazy to explain it but they did a good job considering that it's a simple ramen joint. ÊThere were numerous dining areas where you sit next folks that you don't know but we didn't mind. Ê The ramen was good. ÊNot amazing and mind numbing. ÊNot the best I've ever had. ÊIt was good. Worth the 1 hour wait? Maybe not. The dessert we had was reaaaally good. ÊIt was a crepe cake. ÊLayers of pastry with cream in between. ÊI don't think I've ever had anything like it. Ê The complimentary tea at the end of our ramen was a nice touch. Ê I'm not sure if I'd come back here again. ÊThere seemed to be so many other ramen places in Manhattan. ÊConsidering the price and the wait I'd probably take the risk of trying another ramen joint.

Wow definitely worth the wait ! i can still remember that first bite into my ramen noodles it was almost mind blowing ! and that broth was just spectacular and perfect ! And the portion is quiet generous for a $14 bowl of ramen noodle ! the wait can be a little long but you can just put your name down and cell number and they will call you once your time is coming close. i went to a near by bar so that i could avoid the crowd of people in ippudo waiting in one tiny bar area ! will definitely come back whenever i returned to new york ;0 best food I've had during my trip thanks ippudo !

My girlfriend took me here after a cocktail at nearby Angel's Share and it was one of the best dates ever. The pork buns will melt in your mouth. Ramen is a bit on the pricey side for ramen, but it's pretty good (and huge- wish we split it). Awesome ambiance to boot; loved the deep red hues and true ramen kitchen-style seating. It gets busy busy so plan to grab a drink or do something nearby while you wait.

More like 3.5 stars. You can't come to Ippudo and not wait for a table. But don't fret, give your name, number and head around the corner to Central Bar til they give you a ring when your table is about ready. For an hour wait for a table for 4 people on a Monday night, I hoped for more from their ramen. I had the Wasabi Shoyu Ramen and although it was good, I preferred the version at Zutto better. Maybe I just chose the wrong one? Service was fast and friendly.

Cousin wanted to come here because his brother had told him about this place and he wanted to see what the hype was about. I've been here once before to see the hype as well but I thought, why not join him and try this place again? It's packed once you get there since the bar and waiting area are crammed in the front. Poor layout in my opinion for such a small place to eat. We got to sit right in front of where they make the appetizers and boy, oh boy was that torture! We got pork buns as suggested by cousin's brother and they were delicious! The pork was flavorful and having the chefs make it right in front of us was evil. We were contemplating on sneaking them onto our plate as they made them or something. Would go for seconds and thirds! Ramen was mediocre. Nothing special and a bit overrated in both of our opinions. I prefer Totto Ramen!

Well I wanted so badly to not like this place because I have a couple favorite ramen places back where I'm from that I would never want any other place to top, but it was inevitable. the ramen here was so delicious! When you walk to the seating area all the workers cooks and waiters yell something in Japanese to greet you which was very unexpected and welcoming. Ordered the Akamaru ramen with extra pork belly. It was near perfect. The noodles were nice and fresh, soup was spicy but not really drinkable because it was kinda oily. The chashu pork was one of the best I ever had, don't know of it was the soup thy added a tenderness and flavor to it but it was very good. The best thing about the ramen was the added pork belly. I swear it is the best pork belly I wet had, again dot know if it was the soup base that added the tenderness, juiciness, and flavor to it but it was so soft and melted in my mouth like butter with a smoky flavor to it. Also ordered the wasabi octopus appetizer which was very good as well. The octopus was very fresh chewy and the hint of wasabi gave it a full flavor. This place is now my number 1 spot for ramen for now.

I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, even though I lu-hove soup, especially with noodles and egg. ÊIt didn't live up to the hype. ÊThis place is hyper-hyped, and if you aren't between the ages of thirteen and twenty-two, and/or prone to OMG'ing just about everything better than a four on a scale of one to eleven just because it's in NYC (or just because you're between the ages of thirteen and twenty-two), then this place and its food is going to fall flat. As I waited for my friend to arrive (they won't seat incomplete parties - no big), I noticed the place was overrun by college kittens. ÊDiners and employees. ÊIt was as if I'd been plonked down in the middle of Hipsterville, USA. ÊThe "OMG! ÊThis place serves the best authentic ramen!" lauds went up in flames at that point, and unintentionally took a few points from the restaurant. ÊAt this point, I tried to take the judgmental hat off my head, but it was still within eyesight. ÊHorrible little hat, should have never asked my friends for recommendations. My friend and I split an order of pork buns, then each got a bowl of ramen. The pork bun was okay. ÊNo, it was rather good, but too salty. ÊAll I tasted was the sauce on the pork. ÊIt was a pork sauce bun with several different textures. My ramen was equally okay. ÊNo, not rather good, just okay. ÊTori Ramen, if you must know. ÊI wanted something a bit lighter on sodium and fat, and kept my fingers crossed that this would be the one. ÊThe broth was fine. Ê(I make better soups at home with no sodium or fat, however, so I was a bit unimpressed.) ÊI had an egg added; one was a bit too overcooked. ÊThe noodles didn't wow me. ÊThe noodles that a friend would disown me for speaking ill of, were boring and didn't taste fresh. Go here if you must, but don't read too much into any of the reviews or listen to your die hard friends. ÊThey'll ruin it for you, then tell you that you must not like ramen because you don't agree with them. ÊBy the way, I was disowned by my friend*.

I guess it's about time I write an updated review for Ippudo. Since first coming here 4 years ago, I'm still coming back. That has to be a sign that they make good ramen right? Shoot, it has to be if I'm waiting in like for 1-2 hours every single time I eat here. Even when I come 10 minutes after they open, I am stuck waiting in line for 45 minutes. This ramen is like some gift sent from the heavens. So what's the big deal with Ippudo you may ask? The are TONS and TONS of ramen joints in the city, so why the ridiculous wait? Well, some of it is due to the Yelp madness. I can say for a fact, that before this place got raided by Yelp, the lines were not like this. I could get in and sit down within 5-10 minutes. Those days are long and gone. The restaurant itself is swanky. Just looking at this place and walking around, you can't tell that this is a ramen joint. There's a bar when you enter, and there are tons of seating. With ramen joints, I'm used to sitting in small, cramped areas, where the whole place can only fit 20 people. Ippudo can fit about 50-75 people here, but....you're going to have to wait first. After to weather the storm and finally get seated, it is time to order! My personal favorite is the Akamaru Modern. It has never failed me before through all these years, so I'll stick to what I like. If you want to feel like a baller, give yourself some extra fixings. I tend to go with the menma (bamboo shoots) and the kakuni (stewed pork). Beware though. After adding those, you're looking at a nice $21 bowl of ramen. YIKES! If you have deeper pockets, try the pork buns out. Yeah, I know, you're only supposed to order karaage or gyoza when eating ramen, but these buns aren't half bad. Oh yeah, they're also $9 for 2 buns. You're killing me with these prices Ippudo, but damn the taste justifies it all. The pork buns are full of flavor and the pork is juicy. With the ramen, the broth is where this place deserves all it's praise. There's a nice rich taste with the tonkotsu broth, and you're left with this hearty aftertaste. Ippudo, I know you like to punish us with these ridiculous waits, but somehow I justify it. I love your ramen, your expensive pork buns are good, and damn, I LOVE ramen.

This place was awesome. I came into town one weekend and met up with some old friends and it was suggested we go here. And a great decision it was. They are known for a long wait, so we put our name down and they told us 4 hours! I have never been given a 4 hour wait time in my life for any restaurant, so now we have to try it. Well, while at a friends apt nearby, sure enough they called after about an hour and a half and we got right in. The atmosphere is really cool. We sat in one of the big square booths as we were a lot of us. There were so many people waiting when we got there and it was so cold out. We ordered a few things to start: Tako Wasabi (raw baby octopus), I didn't like this at all, it was sour and spicy, two things that don't go together and I love octopus. The Hirata Buns which were delicious, the Ippudo Teba Gyoza, and the Samurai Rib. Those were excellent. For dinner we ordered the Kogashi Miso Ramen and the Akamaru Modern. They were amazing. I wish I had access to this place, I would go all the time. They don't take reservations but I find this place worth the wait.

Helen C.: you should definitely come here next time you're in New York. The ramen here is DEFINITELY delicious and worth the wait. There are a handful of choices you can select from. My favorite would definitely have to be the Akamaru Modern. They have other appetizer options to chose from as well in which if you choose to go that route you should certainly get the shisho peppers and heavenly pork belly buns. But really, focus all your attention on the ramen. Because it's "don't talk to me I'm too busy engorging my food" good! The staff here are super friendly, attentive, and efficient here, too. They are constantly yelling out "welcome" and "thank you!" in Japenese. Very hospital and certainly appreciated. There is indeed a long line out the door even before it opens, so be wary of that. But, should you need to wait..no worries. There is a bar you're more than welcomed to start enjoying yourself at until you are seated. However, my award for #1 Best Ramen I've ever had still goes to Daikokuya in Los Angeles!

Until I go to Japan for REAL ramen, I will say this: This is the best ramen I've had in all of the USA! All I can remember is that I spent $20 on my bowl (with a gang of add-ons of course) and it was definitely worth it! Be sure to get a pork bun or 6 because they are seriously out of this world! There's a crazy wait to get a seat, but put your name down and take a walk around the area, and build up that appetite. You'll be glad you did.

I love Ippudo so much...seriously love this place! I always get the Classic and the pork buns. I'm a creature of habit and have never ordered any of the other ramen on the menu. Crazy, I know. Whenever I have friends in town, this is the place I absolutely must take them to eat. Needless to say, it never disappoints and everyone walks away happy, full and thrilled to have waited for a table. My advice for anyone who wants to eat here without a wait...get there about 15 minutes before it opens. There will be a line, but you will get a table. You'll be eating on the early side, but it's well worth it, that way you can grab another meal later on. With so many dining options in NYC, Ippudo is a destination that cannot be missed!

I've never wrote a review for Ippudo!??!?! I've been here a bazillion times (the very few times feels like forever when you are waiting in line!) and this last time really topped it. I ain't going to talk about the food because everything is amazing, every ramen is da-bomb. Let's talk about service. I had a family friend come in from DC with her two kids, 4 and 2 years old respectively wanting ramen. I called Ippudo up to check if they were children-friendly...and they certainly put a spin on children-friendly. I came at 5pm to put my name down, told the hostess I got two kiddies in tow for the reservation, and she promptly called me around 7:00pm, was very patient when I told her my party was still flagging a cab from Madison Sq Garden. She told me to let her know when my party arrived since we didn't want to keep the kids waiting, especially in that loud, packed bar area. Party came, we were seated and the waiter brought out plastic cups with straws for the kids, cartoon bowls and plates for them with plastic forks and spoons. We requested all sauces to be on the side, cause we were afraid the peppery sauce may be too much for the children. The waiter/waitress were very attentive, coming by with extra napkins/wet towels, making sure our waters were always refilled. At the end, the 2 year old began crying and the waitress came by with a scoop of pear sorbet that shut the kid up...probably helped relieve teething discomfort. Of course, the kids began to roam and run after dinner...and the waiters cleared the way. I must say I was super impressed with how sincerely child-friendly they were. They deserve a 6th star for their service, despite their insane lines/crowd. :) Tip-bits: Dinner starts at 5:00pm. Either stand in line at eat at 5:00pm, or put your name and number down for dinner at 7ish. Bathrooms are down the stairs that are off to the R of the hostess table. Kid-friendly

I've been here twice now. The first time I went was the first time I'd really had deluxe, non-$1 ramen. And it was incredible, but I had no point of reference. My friends howerever were freaking out over every bite. And rightly so, because a few days later I had ramen from another spot in the East Village and it was "meh" at best. I was spoiled. Because now my reference for ramen is the premier. When I went back recently, I knew to appreciate it's incredible quality. I had the Akamaru Modern Êwhich comes with pork belly in it, which is divine. It evaporates in your mouth. In a good way. The noodles are perfect, the garlic in the broth is fantatic, and when you've eaten it all you can't believe it's over. We also got the Shishito peppers (which are not spicy, they are a must try!) and the Pork Buns which simply killed it. How do they make those?!? Hitting this place on a Wednesday night was perfect. Call ahead and check the wait, there will probably be one, but their drink specials will serve you well while you wait.

Came here again last week, and had my fave akamaru modern ($14)- which tasted as flavorful and tasty as I had remembered it last. ÊThis can be exemplified by the fact that only a few droplets of broth were left at the bottom of my ramen bowl. ÊAny time I have eat or drink something delicious, you can expect it to be completely finished (99%-100%). ÊAnd this was no exception. Ê I'll admit the broth was a tad salty, but that's what makes ramen..ramen! This time I tried their pork buns. ÊMy friend told me that momofuku's pork buns were better, but when comparing the two places' pork buns ($9 for 2 buns), they taste just the same...juicy, sweet, tender, and mouth-watering. At the end of the meal, the server gave me some tea, which was something I needed to wash down the salt and oil. Ê While the wait at ippudo may be discouraging for some, I still think it's well worth waiting for (up to about maybe an hour). ÊA bowl of ramen is definitely great especially on a cold, wintery night in NYC!

Best ramen place in my book!

Location is easy to commute to from the trains, so easy to meet up with friends. The atmosphere is cool, very chill, trendy, and comfortable. Then most of all, the food is freakin awesome!

Excellent! ÊFlavorful. ÊHot broth. ÊAl dente noodles. ÊEfficient and quick service. Melt-in-your-mouth pork. After hearing about Ippudo from my friends who live or visited New York quite often, I had to try this ramen place.

ÊBroth is really flavorful - full of fantastic pork flavor. ÊThe 2 slices of pork just melt in your mouth, literally! ÊYummy! My friend and I also shared two appetizers: Shishito peppers: lightly fried (not heavy), comes with lemon and seasoning salt. ÊYum. ÊWhere can I find this seasoning salt? Pork buns: Êpork belly ? that is marinated well, wrapped in white Chinese buns. Êpork melts in your mouth as well. ÊYum! ÊComes with 2 pieces. Service is organized and efficient and quick! ÊThey seat you, take your order, give you your food, and bring your check very efficiently. ÊNot ideal for big groups, although they have 2 booths serving bigger parties. ÊOtherwise, you sit next to strangers. Luckily, we didn't have to wait too long. ÊI've heard there's a 2.5 hour wait. ÊGo on a weekday lunch and it's probably less of a wait.

Alright, alright, I get why this place is 4 stars. It's very trendy, very warm and friendly staff. One hour wait usually. I'm not going to give this place 4+ stars because this place is nuts for charging 15-17 dollars on ramen. The portions aren't that big and the ramen is good but it's not mind blowing. I've had good ramen elsewhere thats half the price. Ramen isn't supposed to be meant as a gourmet food by any means and charging people up the ass for good but not great ramen is ridiculous. It's like setting up a pho restaurant and that's bling bling and charging 15+ bucks for it. Um, yeah, this place is a 'I've tried it once, and I'm done." type of place. I'd rather save my time of waiting 1 hour and go to a place that doesn't put ramen on the pedestal and is just as good.

Ippudo is great...the hour and half wait sucked..but it hit the spot on a cool winter night...If you feel the symptoms of passing out from hunger, Pomme Frites, Otafuku, Mamoun's is down the street for a snack. I enjoyed the greeting from the cooks as we were seated...and the fancy booth that we sat in...nice ambiance...The Hirata Buns are good. Perfect dough texture and pork flavor. The Ramen was wicked awesome. I had the Shiromaru Hakata Classic and wife had the Akamaru Modern. The broth was exceptional with the great taste of ginger. And the quality of noodles is like eating a perfectly al dente pasta...add an egg poached or boiled...both awesome additions. The only thing the wife complained about was that she added pork belly to bowl that already came with some and it ended up being a little oily...otherwise a perfect dinner.

Singlehandedly the best meal I had in NY. The signature cheese ramen = unique, delicious, ruined most other ramen for me. The broth was pretty good, the noodles were terrific, and the side toppings were pretty good. The whole bowl just meshed perfectly. I also tried the spicy miso broth and the tongkatsu. If you are not adverse to trying new things I'd recommend the cheese, otherwise go with the spicy miso. We also had some pork belly buns which were pretty good. The wait is looong but worth it. Service was great, servers were very nice & quite WEEABO.

ÊNot that I would mind eating it (but the last time I ate there I really could not bring myself to finish the noodle, which says something because I usually empty the entire bowl - soup noodle and all - if the ramen is really good) other than the fact that it is overpriced, and also the way the management treats the customer where it is pretty obvious once you get seated that their goal is to make you leave as soon as possible. ÊThis is totally un-Japanese in customer service, they really do not care about you as a customer, as they care more about getting you out so that they can get those people waiting in line to fill the tables. ÊNo thanks I won't be back.

I came here with a friend around 1:00 pm on a rainy weekday. ÊThe waiting area was fairly packed. ÊWe didn't want to stand in the rain, so we walked over to Momofuku Milk Bar, ate some dessert, and then came back. ÊWe then waited 5-10 minutes (during which I amused myself by taking photos of the dried ramen noodles under the glass at the bar), and then we were seated at the communal table. ÊI hate communal tables in general, but I didn't mind this one too much since we were seated at a corner of the table. My friend told me that I should get either the Shiromaru or the Akamaru. ÊI looked at the menu descriptions: Shiromaru Hakata Classic Ê$15 The original "Tonkotsu" noodle soup topped with pork loin chashu, kikurage, menma, red pickled ginger, sesame, and scallions Akamaru Modern Ê$15 The original "Tonkotsu" noodle soup topped with Ippudo's secret "Umami Dama" miso paste, pork chashu, cabbage, kikurage, scallions, and fragrant garlic oil I said, "OK, I think I'll try the Akamaru." Ê(How could I resist a SECRET miso paste? ÊOr fragrant garlic oil?) "But that's the one *I* always get," my friend said, sounding a little bit hurt. "Umm... you can get it too..." "No, it's OK. ÊGet the Akamaru. ÊI'll get the Shiromaru so you can try both." ÊAww, how kind. :) Then the giant bowls were set down in front of us, and suddenly I was afraid. ÊMy stomach was already full of Momofuku cereal milk soft serve. ÊHow was I going to eat this? But then I took my first bite (slurp?). ÊAnd another. ÊAnd another... and quickly made a dent in the bowl. I liked both, but I ended up liking the Akamaru a lot more. ÊFor once, my tendency to swayed by phrases that either sound cool or amusing to me actually did me some good (as opposed to the "angry shrimp" dish I got at a Thai place because the phrase made me laugh... hey, this was before angry birds came into existence). ÊI did like the secret miso paste and the fragrant garlic oil very much! I would love to go back, just not during peak hours.

Went here with a few buddies from work. When they said we were going for Ramen, I wondered how a restaurant could get over 3,000 positive reviews by serving a food that is kept under my bed in college and served best with a can of Natty Light. Now I know better. ÊThe food was excellent and I will definitely be going back. Don't be alarmed when you go for your first time and you get yelled at in Japanese. Apparently they are just welcoming you in to the restaurant and are VERY excited about it.

Must Go Restaurant in NYC. Even though the line is longer (around 30 minutes) it is totally worth it. I recommend Akumaru Modern Ramen and Crab Cream Croquette (sorry for bad spelling). I've been to totto ramen and thought it was the best but this food here is more amazing. Totally worth it and I will definitely come here next time.

the king of pork buns. but that is all. it isn't worth getting a ramen with sodium overload. some people may love it, but i've had better. the pork buns are the perfect blend of smooth, spicy, and flavorful for every bite. the best of the best. yum. to bad they don't allow you to get them to go! and the service, especially at the podium goes downhill each visit. but i'm still there with visitors at their insistence.

Having never been to a ramen noodle brassiere I had no idea what to expect but boy was I pleasantly surprised! ÊMy boyfriend got the signature Modern dish and I got the miso ramen and it was delicious. ÊThere was so much flavor in the broth and the pork added a saltiness that was out of this world.

Spot is off the chain. All soups (Vegetable one) especially are nuts. Ramen is absolutely addictive. Tuna Seared great, Pork BBQ Ribs Great.

Why 3 stars? ÊBecause I didn't understand why there were 1-2 hour waits to eat soup? Ê --- Ê --- Ê --- It's all in the title. ÊI had not been privy to the "Ramen" phenomenon. ÊI feel like the Grandpa who does't know what the "H-D" in HDTV stands for, but the only Ramen I knew of was the 10 cent bags of Ramen Noodles you buy at the grocery store. This Ramen was better than any dime Ramen, but wow...was it in high demand! ÊThankfully we had a friend that worked at Ippudo that was able to get us on the list for a table when we arrived. ÊIt was an average meal...if we had waited an hour, I think the review would have sunk down to two stars. The funniest part of this experience hd nothing to do with Ippudo itself: We hauled a cab at the WTC and had him drive us to Ippudo...and boy did he drive. ÊThat guy drove like he wanted all of us dead. ÊI had fun in his roller coaster cab, but when we got to Ippudo, my girlfriend came out of the back of the cab with tears streaming around her face. ÊIt's ironic because that is exactly what I would have been doing if we had waited two hours for a table at the restaurant.

I don't care what the reviews say. This place is not worth the three hour wait on a Friday night. I want to kill my friends for putting us through that ordeal. I don't care how delicious the food is - which it is! I'd gladly rather boil water, throw in plain/bland ramen in a pot - and eat it the next time rather than coming back here again.

YES. THIS is what I was looking for when I scanned Yelp for a ramen shop in NYC. My dream of a rich, complex broth brimming with delicious goodies was popped by Totto Ramen, which had a very bland broth and little in it, but Ippudo saved the day! There can be a wait so come early.

The Akamaru Modern here is the best ramen I've ever had. ÊI've tried ramen dishes in LA and the bay area, and they don't come close to being as good as Ippudo. ÊI get extra noodles, egg, and pork. ÊThe pork buns are also really good, but I go there for the ramen. I've been fortunate to eat here during unpopular hours (always when I'm in NYC on vacation), so that the longest I've had to wait was 30 - 40 minutes. ÊAt a popular dining time (noon or 7pm), the wait can be 2+ hours. The price is kind of high, but I think it balances out with all of the mediocre $0.10 ramen you eat in college.

Disclaimer : I am vegetarian. So maybe this was the wrong place for me to come as a vegetarian...however, my husband loves it here and i wanted to join him so here i am. If you are a vegetarian, the only option is a wasabi based ramen...and they arent joking about the wasabi. ÊIt was untolerable, i had to drain the liquid out and ask them to bring me plain broth. ÊNote, they wouldnt do that for me they told me that its my fault I ordered it, so I had to sit there at my table and dilute the broth myself. Forget about the 2 hour wait because its fun by the bar and it actually only ends up being 1 hour. Ê I get it, the food is incredible for non vegetarians...but if youre like me I suggest you avoid at all costs.

I came here by myself last week, on a cold, rainy night. The waiting area was predictably slam-packed with people, so I approached the host's table with trepidation. Me: "May I put my name on the list for one?" Host: "You may, but we actually have a seat available right now." Me: **speechless** Actually, I wasn't speechless. I think I started singing, or maybe that was the ramen gods alighting my ears with a song of victory and power? I threw up a peace sign to the weary masses, as I strutted from the waiting area to the dining room. If ever there was a time for swagger, this was it! Things got even better in the dining room, as I was seated at a table where I could see the kitchen (I love watching cooks at work). I highly recommend the Akamaru Modern ramen, which comes topped with miso paste, though next time I'll go for something more spicy. Hype aside, this a solid, albeit wildly overpriced Ramen joint. Get some in your belly today.

The hype around this restaurant actually is what kept me at bay so long. But finally after a few years of living in Manhattan, I made it through the doors to Ippudo. After marching the few short blocks to 4th Avenue at 11am on a Friday I was met by a group of maybe 10-12 eager noodle lovers waiting for them to open up shop and our early bird status paid off when we were seated right away. The decor is sort of gorgeous. This is not like any of the stripped down ramen shops I've been to before. The staff welcomes your arrival with a round of cheers, your party (which won't be seated until they've all arrived, mind you) will snuggle up at the bar or lounge in one of the great modern booths. The menu is relatively simple, with variations on ingredients, amounts of noodles and broth. We got the pork buns to start, obviously delicious and about on par with Momofuku. I also shared one of the lunch appetizers with Fritz: fried chicken over rice. It was tasty, savory and dry flash fried, a nice - if a bit heavy - starter to the large bowls of ramen that arrived soon after. My Modern was perfectly salted and satisfyingly savory, with hands down the greatest broth I've had yet. The other ingredients didn't blow my mind though and I actually prefer the noodles at Terakawa, Setagaya and Minca. I also tasted the Ippudo Special ramen that was actually made with parmesan cheese infused broth and thicker noodles - almost like an Asian Spaghetti. It was unbelievably yummy, though, and something I could see myself craving in the future. Is it worth waiting an hour and a half for? Probably not. In the end, the food met my expectations and while it's a pricier ramen destination, when I have the time and patience I'll definitely return for a special meal.

Going out to lunch on a workday is risky enough without waiting an hour and a half to be seated (which is entirely likely here). If you're going to brave your boss's wrath by picking Ippudo for a weekday lunch, do one of the following: A. Bring her along. B. Go at 11 am, right when they open, and you'll get seated immediately. I like to be safe, so I did both, AND wore a helmet while crossing the street. On foot. Now, other than the aforementioned wait, I have a number of Issues With Ippudo. I'm going to put them all at the bottom of this review for you to read if you so choose. However, I want to just say that once you are spooning the unctuous, deliciously complex Akamaru Modern broth into your face, all other issues are moot. This broth makes it all worth it. And they give you a nice little spoon holder for when you're chopsticking noodles and fatty pork into your mouth. I like that. ____________ Issues With Ippudo. 1. I get that it's part of the "experience," but I don't enjoy meals punctuated by the entire waitstaff screaming in Japanese every time someone walks into the dining room. Especially not that scraggly looking white guy. (Yeah, I said it.) 2. The pork buns are seriously tasty. But they aren't $4.50 apiece good. 3. I understand why you don't want our late friends to be able to sit down at our table and order, lest they increase our dining time and deprive those waiting of seats. However, in our situation, it made no sense. Because: 3A. They arrived so soon after us, and your service is so quick. As I could've predicted, they were done at the same time as us, so we all walked out together even though they were forced to dine separately. 7 feet away. With their backs to us. 3B. By seating them at the bar seats, you deprived two other diners of THOSE seats, when we had plenty of room. Because... 3C. The table you sat us the four of us at could have fit at least 12. I literally could have laid down across the seats with my arms outstretched and not touched another member of our party. 4. The guy in the cramped bathroom downstairs made no attempt to close the stall door and hide his junk from view as I walked into the bathroom. This is not Ippudo's problem...but it is that guy's. And now mine.

My dining experience at Ippudo from putting the name on the list to final completion of the meal took a total of 5 hours. Yes, that is a long time... and yes, we had a party of 7 people, which is probably why. I ordered the akamaru modern, which is the original tonkotsu ramen, with pork chashu, cabbage, scallions, and some sort of garlic oil. The broth was amazing-- creamy and tasty just like how I imagined an excellent tonkotsu would taste like. However, I wasn't such a big fan of their ramen and wished that the bowl had included more ingredients. I also got the pork bun, which is another one of their must-try items. OH MAN. Now, this little appetizer was uh-mazing. Loved the pork belly, cooked perfectly. It's juicy and fatty and melts in your mouth. The actual bun is light and fluffy, which goes well with the flavorful piece of pork. YUM. Anyway, my friends and I came here during my birthday weekend, so I was pleasantly surprised with a birthday dessert! I got a green tea creme brulee, which was your traditional cream brulee with green tea ice cream. The plate was beautifully decorated with "Happy Birthday, Cassy!" Plus, the entire staff brought it over and sang the birthday song... so of course, I have to say A+ for customer service! (Well, at least for the actual waiters and waitresses; Êthe hostess up in the front can be a little intimidating and less friendly than one would like). So, bottom line: if you are in NY, I'd say yes, go and try their ramen and pork bun! Just don't go with a large party or you might wait forever. Or go a little before they close, so you can snatch up some seats.

It's the best ramen that I've ever had, though I don't frequent this cuisine much. ÊNonetheless, the Kasane black special, akamaru classic and modern akamaru were all excellent, very tasty and distinctively different broths. ÊThe pork buns were terrific, spicy and fresh. ÊTo be fair, the food is probably a 5. ÊThe no reservations policy with an hour wait is really the only thing that would knock it down.

Came here for ramen and pork buns and left completely satisfied. The pork buns were very flavorful. We ordered the Japanese cucumber- which I highly recommend! My entire party ordered the ramen with black garlic oil and each of us finished every last bite of it. Yes, it was THAT good. This is the best ramen I've tried in NY so far. It's different than my favorite spots in LA, but not necessarily better or worse. The noodles are pretty thin for ramen, which actually soaks up more soup and flavor when you eat them. The use of special miso paste and black garlic oil in the bowl really elevate the dish. This place is a little more pricey and upscale than the ramen joints I'm used to in LA, but I don't really mind since the food does not disappoint. I also really like the hip and bustling ambiance of the restaurant. Solid 4 stars!

I bring out-of-town guests here if they want to try a ramen place in New York. Why? Because the service here is really friendly and the restaurant is clean. Whenever I come here I always spend around $25 per person. The ramen is a bit overrated, but I always leave with a smile on my face and a happy, full belly. Get the pork buns as appetizers. They definitely leave you wanting for more, so when your ramen comes, you're in the mood to dig right in.

Noodle broth is better than Momofuku: super salty and fatty. That might be the only pro? Let me list all the cons: 1) wayyyyyyy too noisy (my brain's gonna explode, horrible music, it's neither Jpop nor proper dance club top 40) 2) unclassy setting (yeah it's big, but comparing with Momofuku which is actually modern and comfy) 3) strange service (at most Japanese restaurants, they put love and thoughts in their food, and you could taste it... NOT at ippudo. ) 4) pricinss (15 bucks without tax/tip for the most basic ramen) 5) ridic line (that's just evil, if you understand supply and demand, you know Ippudo basically manufactures this "fake" hype) As a reviewer of an independent mind, I have to disqualify Ippudo from its credits. Noodle is good, but not worth your long wait.

Awesome Awesome Ramen. Anytime you go to a place on a Tuesday at 9pm and you have to wait 45 minutes...you know something is good about this place. During the 45 minute wait, I hung out at the bar and drank a bottle of sake with my brother and my fiance. Once we were done with the bottle it was time to get seated. A Right when you walk into the restaurant, you can tell this place is very trendy. I ordered the Akamaru Modern with all of the toppings. This was very delightful and the soup was as delicious it gets. I've tried as many ramen places in Houston and in New York and Ippudo is definitely on the upper echelon of ramen places in the US (...I want to go to Japan...) Being a trendy place the price is obviously a little on the higher side. Almost $20 for that bowl of ramen...but it was worth it on a cold rainy night in NYC. I'm definitely going to go back when I visit NYC again.

For the single white boys looking for an experience, this is the place to be! It's basically russian roulette for your heart and your bowels. I'm only going to assume that the digestive tract will only be affected if you have the spicy ramen. When you come in and wait to be seated, you can stand at the world's smallest bar and enjoy rounds of people rub by you as they try to get to the restroom. This doesn't happen once by the same person, it happens twice! ÊOn their way back. If it's an attractive girl you might as well turn around and enjoy the little grind session! Yes I enjoyed that part the best! I was sat down with a packed waiting room after five minutes! Not too shabby! Then you realize you're alone and say "awwww" like sad zoidburg. When you're seated solo, you pack in to a 12'x 4' table with random couples. If you're lucky, a table full of hot girls back from the whip cream store like the table across the room where I was NOT sitting. Typically I like to get a "house specialty" drink when I eat. I found an oolong high in my hard plastic bound menu. ÊBefore I could google my drink order, I was startled by a burn victim which turned out to be my waiter "Kim chi". I call him Kim chi because I have no idea what he said his name was. Kim chi grabbed my order of oolong high, pork buns, modern ramen and bolted like he was still on fire. When I did come to find what oolong high was I instantly knew it was a mistake. I didn't want tea; I wanted tea doused in booze! A young chap of 19 beside me asked for vodka and the waiter replied we do not have vodka. Let's be frank here, the type of alcohol they serve is some sort of funny named liquor I can only pronounce when I slip and rack my nuts on the monkey bars. The ingredients are, fermented sweet potatoes. ÊLast I checked sweet potato is served at thanksgiving NEXT to the mashed potatoes! Granted the sweet potatoes had marshmallows and brown sugar on them. Still it's a potato, therefore vodka, therefore founded by the cosmonauts in Russia! The GREAT USSR will not take this one on the chin! Let's not start another cold war. It also turns out that my oolong tea was spiked with this knock off vodka. They didn't have Splenda. Kim Chi-Z ( his rapper alias) brought me two breast implants with BBQ pork in-between. I'm really unsure on how to eat these twin peaks of pork, so I dug in with both hands! If I ever experience a woman's chest in real life, that's how I would handle the situation. When Kim chi (regular name, label dropped him) brought my ramen, he said something about a pork something and an Easter egg. He could have said he put anything in my soup and I would have nodded like my head was on a slinky. My red bowl of ramen came with what appears to be 12 layers of bacon glued together. This must the the "pork something" my unfortunately disfigured server gave me. I also stumbled upon a brown egg. This was a little frightening! Ive only seen brown eggs after I ate a whole uncooked white egg in its shell as it rests in a porcelain bowl, not the red one that sits before me. My spoon is way to big to fit in my mouth all the way. I was wondering why everyone was staring. It's not as pleasurable to watch a man do this as it is a woman. I think the same thing applies to a banana. There are always people shouting and I feel like they're saying "banzai!" I spent most of my time under the table in fear of another Pearl Harbor incident. I'm half way through my bowl of questionable noodles when I start to hit the wall, like when I eat ramen at home, two packs and I'm done! Preferably beef flavor and bouillon cubes. I only put bouillon cubes in because I hear you need a ton of sodium to survive. It has electrolytes and I need me some flavor! I'm just about finished eating when I noticed all the Asian people eating here! A little message to the Asian folks! Quit living to your stereotype and go eat a bucket of chicken! When I finished, I knew not to ask for a desert menu because Japanese people eat fish while its still alive. I paid my bill and immediately went on a hunt for a tooth pick. I was unable to fulfill my quest for "The One Toothpick." I find if you title a task like a movie, it becomes more tolerable and entertaining. One does not simply FIND a toothpick.

Came here all the way from Jamaica due to flight cancellation and my friend strongly recommended me this place. ÊPrior to my trip to Japan, I came to this super popular place in NYC (well, they are pretty popular Ramen joint in Japan too). ÊHowever, my experience was much left desired. The store is clean, modern design, just like the store I bypass in Osaka Umeda, the menu are basically the same, with the twist to please the American/New Yorker's tongue. ÊHowever, its the item that I dislike the MOST. The Pork Bun: ÊMy god, this is so....wrong.. If you are talking about fusion food, it is fine, but being traditional Japanese Ramen lover, you will never see this combination in any store: ÊPeking duck bun (semi sweet) + lettuce (wet) + mayo (Sour/Sweet/Grease) + Chashu (Salty) = BLAH...I felt I want to return this item to get my hard earned $9 back. I opted for the Modern Red Ramen, the soup is good, MUCH better than Hakata Ramen that I have been to in LA (Mottanai Ramen in Gardena when come to think of). ÊBut I wish they have more choice of noodles. ÊBeing $14 a bowl ($16 if you want soft boiled egg, which they screwed up as well). ÊThey have to do better for the price that they charge. To me Ippudo is good, perhaps great, but definitely not the WOW ramen that I will travel all the way for next time when I am in NYC. ÊThere are many more restaurants that worth my time, money and attention. If you still insist to come visit, my tip for you will be come right at 11am when the store opens, and be prepare to sit separately even when you come as a group or couple so the wait will be less.

I really wanted to be blown away by awesome. My trips are usually based around meals, and NYC was no different. Ippudo was one of the top places I had heard so much about. We came here on a Tuesday afternoon and were seated immediately. Toast ordered the Akamaru Modern and I ordered the Karaka Men. Both of the broths were really good, but I still compare the broth to Izakaya Sozai, and it was almost there. Almost. The noodles were laughable and really thin/weird for ramen, but the broth is more important to me. Price is ridiculous for lunch pricing, but I know it's the city. It would be a 3.5 I guess..

Went here on 3 occasions. The 1st time I met up with my sister and she invited other guests so our wait time doubled; we migrated elsewhere. Came back the next day hoping to fit some ramen in before I headed back to Philly, time didn't allow. 3rd times the charm. Met up with some friends after a bachelorette party the night before, def hungover. The wait seemed excurciating under the circumstances (hungover, hungry, and cranky) Nonetheless, we were finally sat and warmly welcomed. Appetizers: pork buns (amazing good), wings (fantastic). Akamaru ramen, what can I say, a beautiful bowl of ramen. Great flavors going on.

I made it my mission to try this place while I was in town this past week. Originally the plan was to try to go for lunch during the week to avoid the wait, but events forced us into trying to get a table for dinner on a Saturday night. No easy feat. We showed up about 15 minutes before they opened and the line was already significantly long. By the time we got to the hostess, the wait was already up to 45 minutes. No problem - I was prepared to wait that long. We were lucky enough to find a space around the bar and enjoy a beer while waiting. It ended up being a little less than the original 45 minute estimate, which was a nice surprise. We started with the pork buns, which were so fantastic, I could easily eat just a meal consisting of just those. I'm getting hungry just thinking back on them. I then ordered the Akamaru Modern and added a soft-boiled egg. The ramen was delicious. Going in, I was sure I was going to get more noodles because I'm such a big eater. But by the end of the bowl, I actually found myself very satisfied. The service was OK at first. I felt a little rushed towards the end, which I suppose I can understand. I'm sure at that point the wait was significant and the moment we stopped eating we were just holding up a table. But don't hover over me. If the guy on a 3 hour wait wants a table, he should have gotten there super early like we did. Also, once our food was dropped off, I never saw our server again. I was hoping to order another drink, but that never happened. The food was terrific, but I probably wouldn't wait more than an hour to eat here.

So the ambience is amazing, cool decor. I could only eat the vegetarian noodle since I dont eat pork and everything used pork broth. Dammit, wth!!!

We waiting in line nearly 30 minutes before store opening. So of course, no wait. Wished we had come 10 minutes after opening, because then too, no wait. But come 30 minutes after opening and you'll have to wait 30 minutes. So get there when it opens. We ordered the popular ramens (vegetable and pork, don't remember the names), and no one at the table spoke to each other. It was our first meal of the day, but seriously, best ramen I have had. We ordered the infamous pork buns...gahhh. Out of this world. The service is courteous and really fast. Our food came out really fast, although we were probably one of the first tables to place their order. My dad wanted to charge his phone (where else can a tourist charge his phone), and she did it willingly and kindly. Too bad we spent $68 for 3 ramens and 1 dish of pork buns (a family of four came out quite content, but not incredibly full), no drinks, tip and tax included. New York, you're expensive!

I am not usually one to give one star reviews , in this case I'd like to give them no stars but unfortunately I don't have that option!Went back to Ippudo again and all I have to say is the entire staff and management team are a bunch of pigs. They didn't write our name for the reservation so when we came back 45 minutes later the manager told us to wait a few minutes which turned into 1:45 minutes when we confronted another manager again he was nasty and said the first manager doesn't understand english and that he takes his staffs side over ours. He then said we have to wait another two hours to be seated. These people wanted me to wait five hours to eat, are they out of their mind!

I'm stunned that people wait upwards of three hours for a taste of this. After all the buildup, what I got was a bowl of soup. Mind you, it was a perfectly decent bowl of soup. But it was not what I expected after such preparation and anticipation. Steamed pork buns are far superior at Momofuku Saam Bar, where my wait was...zero minutes!

The wait here is ridiculous! After 2 unsuccessful attempts, I was finally able to get in without waiting by coming at 5pm on a Tuesday evening. Maybe I was expecting more due to the long wait, but I was underwhelmed by my meal here. My friend and I started with the famed pork buns. A slab of pork belly served in a white bun with a sad looking piece of pale lettuce. Momofuku's were more flavorful (although very greasy). Now onto the ramen... Don't let the pretty bowls distract you from the fact that the portion size is so ridiculously small. And I was served 2 tiny slivers of pork belly that were sliced so thinly... What a let down :[ Forget about Ippudo and go to Totto Ramen instead!

The pork buns are scrumptious and the Ramen is as good as it gets. The interior and service are good enough. So why just 3 stars? I'm not a fan of the ridiculous wait times...it 's not THAT good. And it seems so overpriced compared to what I pay for the same stuff out here in L.A. I guess you pay extra for the hipster server as opposed to the limited English Japanese ones we find here. I prefer the latter I guess.

The wait is almost always long (also for the restrooms, AH!) and the little place where you wait to be seated is extremely small, but once you get past that point, it's all good.

I'm pretty sure this is my favorite restaurant in all of Manhattan. No one likes to wait about an hour and a half for a table but this is the ONE place where I think it might be worth it. So sit or stand at the bar and order a leche martini - on a weeknight you can also get 2 for 1 Japanese. Use your time at the bar to get ready to be stuffed full of Ramen goodness! Start off with the Pork Buns. Although you go there for the ramen, these are out of this world. To this day, I can't figure out how they keep the buns so moist. As for Ramen, The Classic and The Akamaru Modern are both AMAZING! I always order it with the pork belly and extra hot paste. Don't expect to do much after you leave, Ippuddo always leaves you completely full and ready to fall into a food coma.

I think Ippudo NY has taken so much money out of my wallet by now that it's probably not worth trying to count how many times their place appears on my credit card bill. I pretty much don't like to send away friends visiting NYC who are Ippudo NY-virgins without trying it. If you think ramen is shin ramen or pre-packaged ramen (which is an overwhelming amount of people in the world), please try this and come back to me to talk about the awesome-ness of whoever invented japanese ramen. Ippudo's broth is definitely superior to any ramen broth I've tasted (and definitely out of all the other ramen places on St. Marks street...). And although I've yet to try ramen in Japan, as far as I'm concerned, this is the best. I've had Akamaru modern (try it if first timer), Shiromaru Classic (if you want something slightly different than akamaru but still safely good), Tori (ehhh..), Karaka men (only for lunch, a little spicy kick! definitely not for everyone although if you are a spicy food eater, it's nothingggg :D). I don't really like miso broth with ramen -- that concept confuses me -- but maybe one day when I'm feeling super adventurous... and of course, their famous pork buns. Pork buns are exorbitantly expensive and not that insanely awesome after the first time. I recommend trying it once because... I believe that experience is priceless... but then after that, order extra kakuni (braised pork belly) or chashu pork in the noodles. When I'm feeling fancy, I also add an egg to my noodles as well (although in my head, I can't justify $2 for an egg when I can buy a dozen for around the same price). And the fact that I typed all of that out without looking at the menu proves how much I've eaten at this place. No, I'm not japanese so these terms are not normal for me to store in my head. Finally, the drinks selection -- if you're waiting for a while, they have happy hour early dinner time -- get a drink and make it a fun waiting time! I don't really drink beer as much anymore, but when I used to, I didn't leave unless I had a mug of Sapporo (favorite Japanese beer). If you're not into drinking alcohol, take a short walk to Saint's Alp Teahouse one avenue down between 9th and 10th st and get some boba tea or whatever you fancy while you kill that one hour wait. The wait can be longer esp for larger groups and esp at peak hours, but a party of 2 seats relatively okay if you go in less peak hours. Finally, ever since I've tried this place, every ramen I've eaten has been a sad experience. And that is quite unfortunate...but good thing I'm in NYC, a foodie's place to be!

Plan to have lunch early so you can be in line before the sign goes up and the doors open. A quarter before 11am, people are ready to slurp their noodle soup and is Ippodu ready to let them have it. At first I asked the waiter to bring me a bowl of Shiromaru Hakata Classic, but then I realized the Ippudo special was in my face asking me to try its cheesy-miso goodness. Thankfully I remembered because the Ippudo special unique blend of salty parmesan and strong miso made my bowl of ramen real exciting to eat! They couldn't make the soup shovels any bigger to enjoy your bowl of soup. And with an extra $3, I made myself a lunch special adding a small salad and spicy fried chicken over a bowl of rice. Ippudo is not serving you 10 for $1 ramen. Don't forget the Hirata Pork buns--they are spicy, sweet, salty, soft, and gone within minutes of being served. The space is clean and contemporary with a huge shape of a tree made of bamboo stalks by the kitchen. When the host brings in new guest he cheers and the chefs and waiters follow with the same excitement. Definitely not the typical noodle experiences. The wait staff is decked out in bright bandannas on their head and shirts that read I HEART RAMEN. It's definitely a comfortable, laid-back meal you're in for. This is more of a 3.5 star review, but a 3 will do, because Ippudo management has issues with seating your party if the place is kind of empty a person or two is running late. Obvi we'd all like to eat together, but if it's going to mess up the flow of the kitchen, I guess that's fine because the noodles are pricey and not from Nissin.

I do not consider myself an expert by any means, but having recently spent 3 weeks in Japan, and having eaten a wide variety of Ramen while there, I can only say this... Ippudo is the most genuine, authentic and true to its roots restaurant I have ever eaten at in this country!! Ê We arrive starving and there was a 35 minute wait. But it went by quickly with a yummy japanese bloody Mary and a little snack at the bar. Once seated, we were greeted with the traditional Japanese enthusiasm and promptly brought water. We started with the yellow tail tartar which just melted in my mouth. Delicious!!!!! ÊThe spicy pork soup ramen was amazing with extra pork belly. The complimentary tea at the finish was a nice touch. The staff was great, very knowledgable and prompt!! ÊI wish we were staying longer so we could go back

YES. I've attempted to go here before with my cousin, but this time we braved the two hour wait and finally made it in. I noticed most people knock down their stars because of the wait...seriously? I think it's well worth the wait; to pass the time, my cousin and I walked around and ate small dishes at other places. It isn't the only restaurant in the area, but it should definitely be the main attraction of the night. The hostess who Êguided us in called out for workers to greet us with a rousing "IRASSHAIMASE!" which left me very flattered. If you think that workers yelling welcome from every corner is loud, that isn't even the start. I couldn't hear myself think, but it didn't matter because I was there to eat. We started off with the infamous Hirata Buns, and I was delighted. Granted, this is before I've tried the ones at Momofuku. I loved the soft bun and the sweet meat, with the wonderful Japanese mayonnaise. More please! We then had the black charred miso ramen (mine was the Kogashi Miso Ramen, not spicy, and my cousin had the Karaka Kogashi Miso Ramen, which is the spicy version.) I also ordered nitamago, because what is ramen without the egg? I shed a tear as I sipped the hot broth with the humongous soup spoon, because it touched my SOUL. The egg somehow managed to retain a runny yolk in the rich steamy broth, which was perfectly complimented by the fresh noodles. You can definitely taste the difference between these and whatever dehydrated instant kind you ate through college. No dessert, thank goodness we had our sweets beforehand. I don't think I can ever eat food again, I'm so full. Never ever ever again. In summary: expect a long wait and an even longer food coma afterwards.

I debate between 3-4 stars, but only because of the ridiculous wait. ÊI had friends visiting from Boston last weekend who suggested we eat at Ippudo. ÊAfter reading the Yelp reviews, I knew we'd have to wait. ÊBut I didn't realize we would wait for THREE HOURS for a table! ÊTHREE HOURS! ÊYes, we were a party of 7 and yes, it was a Saturday night, but 3 hours is ridiculous. ÊAnd I'm not sure how the wait system actually works for larger parties, because the hostess did not seem to know what was going on, and after just less than 2 hours she would tell us our table would be ready in 20 minutes, but that never happened. But, the pork buns and the ramen were out of this world. ÊI'm glad I waited, but I wouldn't wait for 3 hours again. ÊEvery ingredient in the ramen was to die for... and the broth was unlike any other broth I have ever had. ÊThe pork belly used is tender, and melts in your mouth. ÊDefinitely get the pork buns... but go with a smaller group and don't go on a Saturday night.

I'm giving this 3 stars only because of the pork buns. ÊOtherwise, it would've been a 1 star for me. The wait is ridiculous -- we got there at 1 and they said we wouldnt get a table till 3:30... so we made reservationsfor 6:30 (they don't take reservations over the phone -- just in person... pretty dumb rule). But that wasn't the issue. ÊNot at all, I'm used to waiting long hours for good food. We get there at 6 and they said our table would be ready later. ÊThat's fine. ÊWe chill at the bar and have some beers and order some pork buns. The pork buns... are amazing. Ê$9 for 2 of them, but it's well worth it. ÊThe buns are so perfect and the pork inside is amazing. ÊThe sauce is just godly. ÊThe pork could be a bit more tender, but it's still great. ÊCool. ÊCool. ÊGood stuff... 6:30 comes by. ÊThey estimate 6:50. ÊOkay. ÊThat's fine. 6:50 comes by... they say not yet. 7:15 comes by... they finally come. Okay, 45 minutes after our reservation... not too bad. ÊAt least the world famous Ippudo ramen will cure everything. ÊI've had Ippudo before. ÊI remember thinking that it wasn't as good as Santouka Ramen inside those Mitsuwa stores. ÊBut that was a couple years ago... maybe I was just naiive? Nope. The ramen noodles itself were amazing -- best I've had. ÊSoft and flavorful and everything a ramen noodle should be. The broth... Êlacking. ÊIt's rich, but not as rich as I prefer (and get at other places). ÊIt's not seasoned as well either. I got the soft boiled egg. Ê($2 extra). Ê Cold. ÊCOLD? ÊReally? ÊI'm sure they pre boil the eggs and put it in an ice bath to stop the cooking. ÊBut... really? ÊCOLD? Ê I mean the soft boiled egg is in my ramen broth, how can it still be cold? ÊSigh. That's fine. ÊI still got my chashu pork and my pork belly ($4 extra). ÊChashu pork was just embarrassing for an establishment like Ippudo. ÊIt was not tender nor flavorful. ÊTHe pork belly... not tender at all. ÊThe ones int he buns were much more flavorful than the one in my ramen. Normally I finish my food... but not this time. ÊI was so disapointed. Ê$21 for a bowl of ramen that is inferior to an $8 bowl near me with pretty much no wait... I think the answer is clear as to what I'd choose. Again, I'd probably give this place a 1 had it not been for the pork buns. ÊBut those pork buns are magical.

Scores of New Yorkers warned me against how overrated this place is, but I had to hit up the place myself. My friend and I got here minutes after they opened at 11 am, so we only had a few minutes to wait. They must be printing money in here at this rate, and I've heard of three hour epic waits. After eating here, I'd be grouchy about waiting more than half an hour honestly. I had the akamaru modern ($14) lunch set with the mentaiko rice bowl (plus $3). Tonkatsu broth with a nubbin of akamiso to be stirred in. The broth was decent, though muffled by the garlic oil, but the noodles were pretty sad. Nothing like ramen I've ever seen and it seemed closer to a certain Chinese noodle. The toppings were the most disappointing. One measly piece of chashu and then it was all filler (cabbage, kikurage, green onions). Nor was the mentaiko bowl anything to write letters to Momma about. Itsy bitsy ball of mentaiko on a cushion of kewpie mayo does not really carry a whole bowl of white rice. Usual upscale oriental look. You know, kanji on glass walls and such. Staff shouts greetings and goodbyes, which is a nice Japaneezy touch, but still, makes it hard to chitchat.

It was COLD. RAINY. WINDY. I wanted ramen. We waited 2.5 hours this time to get a table. Luckily, they call when the table is ready so we can explore the area as we wait. This was my second time at Ippudo and I brought my boyfriend here for his first experience of delicious, hot, broth with fresh noodles in NYC. BUT. If it wasn't for the ramen...I wouldn't really come back. Service the first time, was terrible. My server was curt, rushy and rude the last time I was there. I was hoping for something different this time, but needless to say, I was wrong. Upon sitting down, he brought us waters. He comes back 15 minutes later (as if we hadn't waited a long time for the table already) and asks if we are ready. Sorry, perhaps in the south, we do things differently and we ask for drinks first? He took our order and the food runners brought out the appetizers, one at a time. They were great, as was the busser, but our server? No where to be found. It was only at the end with our check when he appeared. My boyfriend and I paid for our portion on our card, and our friend with cash. I had gone to the restroom and when came back, the boys were already getting dressed to leave. I was going to leave the tip when they said it was taken care of. Later on that night, I was outraged. My friend didn't have a choice in his tip. The server didn't come back with change and expected that the extra $20 was his. My friend, being passive, didn't ask for it and let it go. I, however, would have said something. Unless the words, "no change" are expressed, change should ALWAYS be brought back...especially one for a 25% tip on CRAPPY service. On the food: my friend ordered the pork buns, which were delicious but NOT WORTH $9 for 2 buns, Kurobuta Pork Tatsuta Age, it was mediocre. Nothing special and the Samurai rib which had great flavor but it was familiar in taste (my mom make something similar) and was not worth $12 for 2 ribs. Ramen, of course was delightful. It came out hot, steaming with flavor. We all ordered the Akamaru modern. the broth is so rich and delicious. For $15 a bowl, it fills you up but I don't think I will wait 2.5 hours again. Not for the service.

The pork buns are great but you can get similar ones elsewhere. Usually there's a line by the time they open and they only seat you when your whole party have arrived. Their soup is delicious but I don't like their noodles, thinner than elsewhere and too chewy. There are better noodle places elsewhere for similar or lower costs if you take the time and look for them.

The winner? ÊTotto! Totto has the better broth and chasu. ÊIppudo has a pure tonkatsu broth and better noodles. ÊBut in the end, Totto wins overall because of that da@n broth and chasu!!! Ippudo has some great pork buns and side dishes. ÊBut really, when it comes to ramen, man...it's hard to beat Totto.

We actually only had to wait outside about ten minutes then inside maybe another ten. After talking with our friend who lives in NY she said this is pretty much unheard of so maybe the rain had a factor in our speedy seating time? Either way, I'm not complaining. Got the Modern ramen with egg topping and tried my first ever Shochu cocktail. Everything was fantastic and put all other ramen places I've eaten at to shame. It's too bad to get here I have to suffer through a 5.5 -7 hour journey cramped in an airplane cabin next to a fat man whose legs keep spilling into my personal space. There were three of us and we got seated at a communal table at the back and just so happened to also be seated with two other groups from the Bay Area! Coincidence, and proof that the reputation of Ippudo is bi-coastal. Next time I'm in Manhattan I will definitely be back, and in the meantime I am going to scour the interwebs to search for a reasonable recipe to recreate the magic - I'll even get over my aversion to handling pig's feet.

Best ramen I've ever had, considering all the different criteria - noodles, pork, broth, other ingredients. I always get the tori ramen, and the broth is just heavenly - not too oily, rich, tasty, and very drinkable. Haven't tried this yet, but I imagine the kakuni (pork belly) would taste better than the chashu that comes with the ramen. Line up is insane but it's so worth it.

WHAT IS UP WITH THIS PLACE???? whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy is it so crowded!?!?!?!? and why can't they take reservations?? that's so annoying! Good thing my cousins got there like 45 mintues before I did, so it was minimal waiting in the mosh pit. ÊWe got a really cool booth and I was actually amazed how different the atmosphere is inside the restaurant. ÊThe waiters are pretty cool and the presentation of the food was fun. Ê We had the pork buns which were like peking duck except pork. (yummy) ÊI ordered the miso ramen the spicy one. ÊI thought I wasn't really going to like it bc there was so much grease on the top of the soup but I ended up being ok w/ it. ÊDef. could've used way more veggies....they were skimping on the veggies!!!! Everyone raves about it, but I think i'd rather try a different place esp. since it's like $20 for a bowl of glorified noodles. :P NEXT!!!

I'd give it 4 stars but to counterbalance the overrated-hype element I'm reducing the rating. ÊFor cost no object diners who have zero respect for value the by all means give it 5 stars... not me. Wait is not bad if you go after say 1045p even on a Saturday. Pork buns are good but not that special. ÊThey are just side pork wrapped with the soft and fresh version of what the American peking duck buns ought to be (Chinese joints only serve smelly frozen to death then thawed a thousand times buns). Ê Ramen is good, al dente if you like, but what's up with the price? ÊAnd no egg included??? Good people-watching. ÊAlmost all couples are Gaijins with their Asian girlfriends.

Not my favorite ramen restaurant in Japan, but definitely hits the spot and satisfies my ramen-craving in the US. Delicious, well-crafted Ippudo Ramen. Tastes just like the Ippudo I've had in both Osaka and Tokyo. Authentic. Worth the lines. Gochis?sama-deshita!!

I always have a great time here, and for some reason or another, I often find myself back here despite the ridiculously long wait. I think the shortest I've ever waited here was 35 minutes and the longest 2 hrs (beyond that I'm usually heading to other places for ramen). Let me get this across first before I continue: I love ramen. I, like many before me, always get the Akamaru Modern with a nice soft boiled egg. The broth has a nice miso base, and that savory umami taste. The pork is good, but sometimes it can get a little tough (I like it fatty, melty, and soft). I've also had the Shiromaru Hakata Classic, which is good too. The broth runs slightly more clear, but it also has a lot of flavor. The pork belly buns here are amazing! The buns are fluffy and light, and the pork is well glazed and very soft (just like I like it). There's a slow heat in the flavor too, that isn't spicy enough to be overwhelming but just enough to remain on the tongue after you eat it. The service here is always great. I've struck up conversations (whether to their benefit or dismay) with other patrons and several of the waitstaff. In fact, the last time I was there I ended up giving one of the servers my phone number in case he was ever in my town (I seriously never do this). Anyway, if you plan on going to Ippudo, make sure you're prepared for a wait. Or you can have a drink at the bar up front. Where else can you drink at a bartop paved with ramen? The Bloody Marys looked good... if you're into that kind of thing.

I was a hungry bastard before coming here for lunch, and some technological issues left me waiting out in the cold for 30 minutes before my friend met me about 20 blocks uptown of Ippudo. ÊAnd every one minute that she didn't respond to my calls/texts, I imagined the wait multiplying by a factor of two. ÊAnd as my fingers became progressively more frostbitten, I could feel the warm, warm touch of a bowl of ramen slipping further and further away..... And then we got there at about 11:45. ÊAnd walked up to the hostess's station. ÊAnd asked for a table for 2. ÊAnd they immediately reached for the menus. ÊSCORE. Seeing as how Ippudo is the most yelp-reviewed place in all of New York, I don't know how much of a contribution I'll be able to make as someone who is certainly ramen-loving but not quite a ramen-expert. ÊBut I'll try anyway: I almost got the Akamaru chashu but was convinced by our server to go with just the Modern and to add pork belly instead. ÊTHIS WAS THE BEST IDEA EVER. ÊThe pork chashu was decent, but the belly was AWESOME, with an atrociously good layer of fat on one side, and tender meat that fell apart beautifully underneath. ÊSeveral bites approached mouthgasm levels of greatness. ÊHighly recommend as an addition to this ramen. The ramen itself, as apparently every person above the age of 2 and with a functional esophagus can tell you, is outstanding. ÊThe miso paste is ridonkey kong and will provide you with an extraordinarily rich-tasting broth, while the noodles are cooked perfectly to leave them with just the right amount of tensile strength. ÊAnd as long as I'm jumping on the bandwagon, I should also tell you that the pork buns were absolutely delicious, with a perfectly soft bun and a very healthy serving of tender pork inside. 2 other things that jumped out were the great service (quick and very friendly - the place maintains somewhat of a hip atmosphere but is still super laid back) and the fact that Ginga Kogen beer is delicious (though my friend had to shell out for it.....$9 for a bottle). Yeah, I'll be back here fo sho. ÊAnd even though I was fortunate enough to encounter zero wait my first time, I'd be willing to hang around for a while for this stuff. ÊMaybe not for 3 hours. ÊBut a while.

To have even a passing interest in ramen and to be in New York City for any length of time is to wind up at Ippudo eventually. Well, a couple of days ago, I guess, it was my turn. ÊOf course, I made sure that I arrived early (right around the time that the doors opened) and that I was alone. ÊIndeed, it was my calculation that, if I were by myself, I would be able to squeeze myself in (perhaps, grab some counter seating) and bypass what would surely be a tiresome wait. Sure enough, it worked. ÊAs parties of two or more were told that they would have to wait for upwards of 45 minutes to an hour, I was seated right away. ÊThere was one lone seat left (at the edge of the front counter right by the cashier's station); and, it was perfect. ÊI plopped down and ordered without much hesitation since I knew exactly what I wanted. I asked for the Akamura Modern, which features a tonkotsu (pork bone) broth and toppings such as chashu (sliced roast pork), kikurage (wood ear mushrooms), negi (scallions), mayu (blackened garlic oil), and a dollop of Ippudo's special umami dama miso paste. ÊTo augment the already impressive lineup of toppings and to "go all out," I asked for some kakuni (braised pork belly) and onsen tamago (a poached egg) as well. Before long, I was sitting face-to-face with a hot bowl of ramen. ÊArmed with a pair of wooden chopsticks and an oversized soup spoon, I paid my respects at the altar of the bowl (Tampopo-style), and dug in. Ê I was struck immediately by the moist and tender chashu and pork belly (blessed as they were by their Berkshire pedigree). ÊThe chefs completely nailed it. ÊI don't think they could have improved on the taste and texture at all--just superb. Ê Furthermore, the broth was excellent. ÊIt had all of the hallmarks of the finest tonkotsu broths (with a depth of flavor that was not too salty and a rich creamy consistency that was like milk). ÊObviously, the broth had been simmering for hours upon hours to allow the pork fat to emulsify into the broth and bond with the dashi base. Ê Ê The final touch of the blackened garlic oil and special miso (which, together, conspired to punctuate the broth with a fermented, garlicy presence) simply enriched the proceedings that much more. ÊTruly, it was a fine and complex bowl of ramen. However, what detracted from my enjoying the experience totally and unequivocally were the noodles themselves. ÊIppudo's ramen noodles are very somen-like and are much thinner than what I prefer when I am supposedly eating "ramen." Sure, there are variations; and, some ramen noodles are thinner. ÊI just prefer a thicker variety; that's all (along the lines of Chinese lo-mein noodles -- which, after all, inspired ramen in the first place). Ê Ultimately, with the issue of the noodles aside, my brief and satisfying ramen bowl at Ippudo was, without question, one of the better ones that I've had so far in New York. ÊWas it the best? ÊNo; but, on a brisk Manhattan afternoon (with my next food adventure already planned in my head), it didn't have to be.

My daughter brought me here and this was such a winner that we went the next night as well! Where to start? Love the ambiance, service (the first night we had a great woman, 2nd night the guy was awful!) And the food!!!! BBQ Pork buns - a must Tofu and Nasu agedashi - the eggplant (nasu) was delicious! Could do a whole side of only that. Gindara Saikyo Yaki - delicious, but way too small a portion for the price $16!!! I can't even remember which ramen we had..... the first night we each had something different and the 2nd night we tried a different ramen (just one) and did the Kae-dama where you get an extra serving of noodles for $2. This was perfect! And a generous size of extra noodles. We also added extras, which ups the price, but well worth it - can always go for an extra braised pork! They don't take reservations except for the same day.... AND you have to go in.... nothing over the phone! So stop by during lunch and make your evening reservations. Crowded waiting area. But so worth the wait. If you have room for dessert.... walk over to Rice to Riches! :)

I'm the 3397th review.. WTF?! What more is there to say? The ramen is perfection. I'm sure no matter what kind you get, it will be amazing (especially after the one hour wait). THE FOOD The dishes that blew our minds: 1. Akamaru Modern with a seasoned soft boiled egg 2. Karaka Men with a poached egg 3. Pork Belly Buns (Hirata Buns) - not as good as Momofuku's, but still good. A little drier and saltier than Momo's. 4. Blood Orange sorbet - very refreshing ending to a perfect lunch OVERALL My advice, don't go when you're hungry because you'll be STARVING by the time you get seated. Go an hour before you know you will get hungry =] Also, A+ service. Very inviting and friendly. Ê My best food-ing experience in NY!

Right place at the right time - just happens once in a while. Came here at 5:30 p.m. yesterday, was sixth on line. ÊNumbers seven, eight and nine were a party of three. ÊWe began chatting and got a table for four once it opened at 6 p.m on the dot. ÊGood move - got to try more than I would have otherwise. ÊAnd I loved every bite. Our appetizers were the shishito, tofu yasai tar tar, agedashi tofu yasai ankake, pork hirate buns and bakuretsu tofu. ÊI was able to eat only the first two since those are the vegetarian-friendly ones, but they were terrific. ÊThe shishito was very lightly grilled, and the salt was not overpowering. ÊThe tofu yasai tar tar was melt-in-your-mouth soft and moist. ÊThe presentation was beautiful - it looks like a flower. ÊSomehow, the raisins, asparagus, avocado and cucumber were the ideal touches for the dish. ÊNot a crumb was left on any plate. Our ramens were wasabi shoyu (my choice), wasabi tonkotsu, karaka miso and akamaru. ÊThe wasabi shoyu had two huge chunks of tofu, and the texture was perfect for the soup. ÊMy new friends sampled each other's dishes and all agreed that the best was the karaka miso. ÊSo if you are a carnivore and can't decide which to get, that may be the best one. The service was excellent - water glasses were refilled quickly and the wait staff were experts about the menu. ÊI was quickly given the vegetarian options without the sneering I receive at some restaurants. As noted, I waited only a half-hour to get in and was with great conversationalists, so I can't complain about the wait. ÊBut Ippudo has a friendly, inviting atmosphere, and it seemed that everybody here was having a terrific time. Love that there are two women's rooms and one for men. ÊFirst time I have seen a line for the men's room outisde of a sporting event. Thought the price was reasonable so no complaints there. ÊBut if you decide to make the trip, you may want to bring friends so that you can share. ÊSo happy that I did. Can't remember the last time I had so much fun at a Friday night dinner. ÊLet's do it again. Love you, Ippudo!

My second visit and this time was definitely more memorable than the last. I came here before it got extremely popular which means waiting for an hour this time was something new. Surprisingly the staff inside were quite friendly and the boyfriend and I even had a joke or two with them. But come on, it's actually about the food here - not the staffs. We shared 3 appetizers, had our own ramen bowl and ended with the dessert that I remember from the first time I was here. Hamachi Carpaccio - brilliant play on taste, the thinly sliced jalapeno was not hot at all Kurobuta Steak Ginger Sauce - the pork was nicely cook, the runny egg yolk covering the pork with the ginger sauce was divine Umakara Tori Tatsuta Age - chicken wing with bones already taken out and replaced with minced pork was deep-fried and pair with a spicy soy sauce, crunchy and gives a new meaning to fried chicken wing Regardless of which ramen you get, the broth is rich. The thickness of the broth makes you wanting more because it's not salty or overly seasoned. As for dessert, we had our Matcha Brulee which ended the meal nicely. With a glass of hot tea to wash everything down, the meal was complete. The one hour wait was definitely worth the wait.

Went here with boyfriend because of its popularity - every time I passed it, there is a long queue outside the door. We arrived there at 11:10 am on a Saturday morning, and waited for about 15 mins for seats. Ordered the special pork ramen ($16 pretax) for both, and the Japanese cucumber appetizer ($8) due to recommendation from online. The cucumber was okay, but the ramen was not that good. Perhaps my expectation was too high, but only the soup of the ramen deserved the price (though too oily for Japanese ramen), as far as I see it. The service was good. But the environment was too crowded and loud - they chose the loud and fast music for encouraging people to eat faster, which is not Japanese at all. Not recommended mainly because of the price.

Sort "Restaurants" in NY by "Number of Reviews" and Ippudo is what you get; 3200+ reviews!! By all means, this place is NOT over-hyped / over-rated. We got there on a Saturday night at 5:30pm. Had to wait approx 45 mins, BUT IT WAS SOOOOO WORTH IT. Raw Baby Octopus Appetizer - imagine small slices of octopus in a limey and slimey wasabi sauce. Êi'd rate this an 8/10 Pork Belly Steambuns - 10 out of friggin 10!!! the pork belly just melts in your mouth. Akamaru Modern Ramen - 10/10. Try it with additional Pork Belly and a soft poached egg. You can also add extra noodles for 2 bucks. A couple Kirins and all of the above was more than enough for me and my fiance. ÊReal talk.. I eat ALOT (cuz i'm a fatty) and I couldn't even breathe after our meal was done. ÊThat's saying quite a bit. The bill came out to a little over 70 bucks with a 20+% tip. ENJOY!

Pork bun is the best pork bun I have ever had!! $10 for two. Spicy bbq pork inside the fluffiest bread. I had the classic ramen ($15). Not bad. I didn't get the thirsty feeling I usually get when I have ramen, which is a good sign. That means their dishes are not loaded with salt. You also get a cup of tea at the end to help wash it all down. 1 star off for the wait. Came here before they reopened for dinner (5pm) and there was already a long line. Table of 2, wait was still almost an hour long. Love the decor inside! Place is very noisy though.

ippudo is a strange one. in japan (or even ippudo branch in singapore), a ramen shop is a place for you to come in, eat your ramen, pay the bill and go but alas NY ippudo is not like that at all. seems like it has become a place to hang out, chit chat, have a few drinks while slurping on that ramen soup kinda place SLOOOOOWLY. SO STRANGE! anyway the first time i came at about 6.30 they asked us to wait for 3 hours (there were 3 of us), we walked away of course. so i learned a trick on how to get a table in ippudo since they don't take reservations. come during lunch time, tell them you'll be back in the evening, do your errands, watch a movie, buy a few things, have your coffee and come back for that bowl of ramen. is it worth it? i was soooo totally prepared to hate it but (ARGH!) i have to admit their quality is consistent. the verdict is in and it's good. so yeah it's troublesome and a bit crazy but if you really want to get your ramen fix, be crazy, roll your eyes and back. once you have that first sip of the soup, you know it's worth it. i ususally order akamaru ramen here~ :)

I was taken here by a friend for a birthday dinner last month. We both wanted to eat here since we've heard about all the hype. I must confess I am not a huge ramen lover, but my dining companion was and she really liked it. Sure the Akamaru Modern ramen's broth was a lot better than the type you get from a 50 cent package of ramen, but I'm not sure I'd willingly shell out $16 for ramen on my own accord. The real star of the entire meal was the delicious pork buns! I would just come back and get two orders of those and no ramen. The pork buns are pricey, but pork in the buns have the perfect fat to lean ratio and the buns were the best I had ever had. Definitely must get this!

I *DO* love this place. And I'm reviewing mostly on the food. Top ramen and pork bun for sure. This is very authentic ramen and the broth is really savory! The pork belly is outright DELICIOUS and smoky tasting. I found the dark broth to be too salty and strong, but in the lighter broth, it's wonderful. However, the wait is a HUGE deterrent to making this a regular place. The space is large, and I know very popular, but I have never gone there where they didn't say there was an hour or more wait. Since they don't take reservations (unless you go in the middle of the day and they will then give you a reservation for 11pm), it makes it next to impossible to ever get a seat. And I'm not *that* much of a fan. I cannot tell you the number of times friends and I have wanted to go here and could not get a table. That's fine I guess, because it allows me to savor the many other excellent ramen, soba places nearby anywhere in the east village. So while I love their ramen, and it *is* worth eventually getting a reservation there early for late in the evening, it's not something you want to deal with when hungry. It's a beautiful place, but I wish they would make it a little easier to get a table. Maybe it makes them look highly sought after, but after this many years later, I am not as willing to play the game and more than happy to go to other places that are quieter and have just as tasty noodles. This is why it doesn't get 5 stars from me.

Was on Vaca & Ippudo was on our list of NYC Restaurants to dine in... Turned out to be an excellent choice as they served me some of the BEST Ramen I've EVER had the pleasure of eating... But Ippudo is not all about their Ramen... We started w/the Pork Belly Steam Bun Sandwich & it was mouth watering, second we had their BBQ Ribs served w/a chili powder mix & an orange dipping glaze, the meat was so tender, fell right off the bone & the orange glazed w/the chili paired perfectly... We went w/the Akamaru Modern Ramen & added: Salted Egg & Braised Pork Belly, the broth was crisp/clean & very flavorful, not overly muddy/thick like some can be... For Dessert we had the "Anin Sorbet" Sweet Tofu Custard w/Blood Orange Sorbet, texture and flavor was simply amazing, you would never know you're eating tofu and that's a good thing as I am not a big fan of tofu by any means... The Service was GREAT, the staff was extremely friendly, very informative/knowledgeable regarding he entire menu and very detailed in how the treated all the tables, but by no means did they ever "hover"... What is also cool about Ippudo is the VIBE it exudes, you feel very welcomed from the moment you enter as you're greeted loudly/warmly... The community tables are a nice touch, along w/the large group booth like seating & the open kitchen is very nice as the cooks are all quite the showmen... Side note if you're not opposed to dining later in the evening, like after 9:30PM the wait is nothing compared to earlier in the evening or for lunch, in fact we were seated immediately upon arriving... Would love it if they opened one of their restaurants in SF!!!

I don't understand why the waiters and cooks yell everything here. Are they trying to create an authentic experience? Because I studied abroad in Japan when I was in college, and I never heard anybody yelling in any ramen shops there. The yelling really bothers me. Otherwise the food is really good. But I don't know if I'd wait an hour and 45 minutes for it. The pork bun appetizers are even better than the ramen.

Oh my god. I totally get the hype now! Honestly I'm not sure why I waited so long to taste the amazing-ness that is Ippudo! Two days later.. and I'm still dreaming about it. There is a super long wait, be forewarned. My friend and I got there around 5:15 on a Tuesday and we had an approximate 5 minute wait.. but I'm sure it would have been longer if we had arrived later. Yep, on a Tuesday.. It's a really fun ambiance. You can see the counter where the chef's prepare the ramen. Also the waiters and chef's yell at each other in Japanese the entire time.. no clue what they were saying. but thats ok. It was fun. My friend ordered the vegetarian ramen, I had the modern. I was debating between that or the classic - I'm not into super spicy foods. ÊI'm so glad I listened to the waiter because I asked what the difference was between the two and he said the modern was more flavorful. DEEEELICIOUS. ÊI seriously cannot WAIT to go back! btw, I wouldn't choose this place as a first date spot. It's so super noisey and you can barely hear the person sitting next to you. Your tastebuds, however, will thank you!

Rather than waste time reading reviews, just go wait in line. Seriously worth it. In addition to the ramen, try the pork and/or chicken buns. Once in, the wait for food isn't long at all. Waiters are awesome, food is delish, What more could you ask for?

Best place in NYC to experiencing a japanese style pork or miso based ramen. The noodles are very fresh. Be sure to ask the person waiting your table to surprise you with some added toppings. Great selection of cold sake. Beware of the very strict reservation policy.

four stars because they will not let me make a reservation. ÊDefinitely have to get here early because the crowd gets ridiculous. ÊThe later you come, the longer the wait. The must try - pork bun appetizer. Êwowzers. the ramen - pick the description for the broth that you like because honestly, they are all good. dessert - green tea creme brulee - delicious. A little on the pricey side but you cant make this stuff at home. ÊThe most I do at home is add in some spam and an egg...call it a day. Happy eating, suckers.

Believe the hype, people! I absolutely agree with the reviews of you fine fellow Yelpers. I just want to add that at 11:15 a.m. (fifteen minutes after opening), there was a 20 minute wait. And I'm almost positive that the waitstaff is screaming "WINNING!" in Japanese.

It was all a dream, I used to read ramen magazine, Samurai ribs and pork buns up in the limousine. The shiromaru hakata classic ramen tastes superb. The broth is rich and creamy, and not too salty like a lot of other places. ÊThe braised pork belly doesn't add to the soup (and it's also not so great), so add on something else. ÊThe noodles have the perfect thickness, texture, and taste to boot. Ê The samurai ribs are the bees knees. ÊThe meat falls off the bones and into my mouth. ÊThe pork buns are fantastic as well. ÊIt's basically a piece of pork chop smothered in a yummy sauce wrapped in a warm, soft bun. Uh, and if you don't know, now you know, uh.

Ramen doesn't quite taste the same after visiting this place. It is, hands down, the best ramen I've ever had. Warm up your taste buds and get the pork buns for an appetizer. Order the Akamaru ramen and you will be absolutely DELIGHTED. Everything was perfect. Service was helpful and friendly, food was obviously amazing, and the ambiance was sophisticated and contemporary. During my one week stay in New York, I can easily say this was the best meal I had.

Look the ramen is great, it is on par with the best to be had anywhere. ÊBetter than any of the NYC other ramen shops I have tried. Ê Here is the caveat - despite all the hype, it is still ramen noodles, so brace yourself and reel in those emotions before you go. Ê The food is five star, the wait is miserable and is a huge negative against the place, nonetheless a 4 star treat.

There was only 2 of us on our party and we went during lunch, so our wait was no more than 15 minutes -- score! They only have larger tables so if you are a smaller group be prepared to sit next to and with others. ÊThe servers were very attentive and knew the menu very well. ÊDuring lunch they had this "lunch box" type option where we were able to order a ramen with a side order, i.e. unagi don or fried chicken over rice. I guess I should've started off by stating that I am not fond of ramen ... or any soup for that matter. ÊBut because of all the hype I thought I should just give it a shot -- and needless to say I was quite impressed. The ramen was very tasty and, much to my surprise, I ate till I was actually full. ÊBeing that I am an extremely picky person, I would rather starve than eat something I don't like =X. ÊHowever, I must admit that I did enjoy my "side order" of unagi don more. ÊOh, and the pork/chicken buns were great!

Whoa. This place is seriously hyped up, and after finally getting a chance to go there I think it meets the hype. First, a friend recommended that we go on the weekend for lunch to minimize wait time. Since the two-hour-long-lines are almost infamous here, I thought it was a good idea. Turns out that even on Sunday at 1pm, there's around a 45 minute wait for a table for 2 (which, apparently, is a short wait!). But it was worth it. We started off with the hirata pork buns. Amazing. Pork done exactly right + mayo + lettuce = "omg we should get like 10 more". I got the classic ramen with the pork belly as my entree. The soup is everything that yelpers describe it as: laced with not-quite-crack-but-something-equally-addictive. It was very hearty (umami!) and I wish I could've gotten more of just the broth at the end of the meal! The noodles themselves tasted very authentic, but be warned: they're actual noodles, and not at all like American instant ramen noodles (in other words, they're a bit springy, less starchy, and more filling). I was also surprised by the decor; I was expecting a place that felt older and more foreign. Instead, it was a hip restaurant where all the waiters were fairly young (and not Japanese!), with very modern decorations. It was a great setup! In short: definitely worth the hype.

Getting a seat here is a challenge, but worth it. Ê The service was swift and friendly, though I thought it was a bit overdone with the Japanese. ÊThe decor also gave the place a nice vibe, and I liked that there were both individual tables and shared spaces. Ê The ramen was very good (especially after a night of drinking) and on par with the ramen found at shops in Japan, and the pork buns were delicious. ÊThe tuna tataki was also very good and interestingly flavored, but I've had better.

The ramen was great, the wait was ridiculous, but what really hurt the rating was the Êunbearable noise (ultra loud, crappy pop) and an overwhelming sense that the "friendliness" and "fun" was all in the interest of getting us out of there as fast as possible. I don't mind hectic and informal, but there was something so forced and fake and commercial and just physically unpleasant about the whole thing. Still, I liked the food enough to go back. I think.

I came here on a Sunday evening, and as soon as I entered the restaurant I was starting to regret my choice, since apparently half of Manhattan has had the same idea. But I was not gonna get scared off so easily! Despite being rather hungry I decided to give this a try, having read so much good about it. A short 20 minutes later my name was called and I was escorted to a communal table. I ordered the Akamaru Modern, which turned out to be an great choice! A lot of Ramen in a hearty broth, with some cabbage and scallions, and two pieces of chashu pork . I also ordered the Nitamago topping (seasoned salt boiled egg), since my waitress recommended it, which accompanied the dish nicely! Next time I might add an additional topping, though, a little more vegetables couldn't hurt in there! Stir everything up and enjoy... The communal tables are really nice to sit at, but I might be partial since for some reason I have a thing for them... overall I liked the whole layout of the restaurant, and service was really good and pretty fast. Awesome on a cold winter night!

OK your ready? I've walked in and out of this place on several occations, even if its "magic ramen" Ben isnt waiting two hours for a table. We got lucky this time ten minute wait for a deuce. ÊTaDa! Ramen gods were happy with me last night they wanted me to be there eat and get mad at their shitty service. Ill get to that. So apparently its a trendy cluster fuck of a place, As I'm sitting there waiting for a table they are playing late 80's early 90's happy rap music, I was transported out of the Ramen spot and im 10yr old chef ben standing on a basketball court in brooklyn wearing brightly colored clothes with a crappy haircut. "What the shit was that?" I said to myself wondering if ÊI was eating or in a Run DMC video. Just me, myself, and I? Êdid u get that last one? ok moving on... So douchey Mcdouchebag is our waiter. ÊWe didnt want any but he didnt offer drinks or apps. ÊWhen he saw that we just order two bowls of Ramen i saw where this was going. I got the Miso, my favorite. I judge a place on the miso. ÊAnd I will admit the broth was pretty amazing. Ive been to other great spots but this miso was different it seemed heavier but in a good way I liked it a lot. Now what I didn't like was Mr.Douchey not even checking on us once, not even "Is everything ok?" Are you f*cking serious? Do you think this place is that good you dont even have to ask your customers if everything is fine and do you need anything? Ê I did like the bus boy, happy dude from Guatemala.

5 stars for ramen in the US ( just so my Japanese friends know I'm not comparing this to ramen in Japan). My wife sums it up as "uppity izakaya with ramen" :-) I had Wasabi Shoyu with a side of Kakuni, my wife had The Shiromaru Hakata Classic. ÊWasabi Shoyu had just the right amount of wasabi, the broth was as it should be :) The Kakuni was spectacular, I could have eaten a meal of that alone. The Shiromaru Hakata broth was similarly just right. The noodles were cooked perfectly. Staff was very friendly, quick, they all spoke at least a little Japanese. The manager was obviously Japanese as well. ÊI say this because it lends credibility to the food as real Japanese ramen and not someone else trying to pretend. We sat very quickly given how busy it was, larger parties were waiting for quite awhile. ÊThey turnover small parties pretty quickly at counter style eating. There are very few big tables which is why it was probably a wait for those other larger parties. Atmosphere was also great, modern but with hints of traditional Japanese ramen shops.

Ippudo makes me so happy. It's my favorite place to eat in all of New York. Lunch is worth it. Dinner is not that worth it. I always lunch combo the Akamaru modern + Roast pork over rice. I always effin have to effin order the effin pork buns. These three items are enough to share between me and a girlfriend. P.S. don't get any toppings because it's not worth it. Come with only one other person; seating is faster for a party of two. Come right when the place opens at 11am. Don't come on a weekend dinner, but if you do, leave your negative reviews whining about how long you waited far from this place. I honestly could care less about service if the food is this damn good, but JUST SO YOU ALL KNOW: their service is top notch. I NEVER have to ask for my water to be refilled, it just. somehow. always. is. refilled. like Jesus feeding the 5,000. There's a Japanese guy with silver hair who works here and he's hella courteous and professional and I honestly just love him and I love Ippudo because they're not at all about cheesy smiles and careless smalltalk. It's all about business: they get you in, serve you the best damn meal of your life, then get you out. All without a fuss. Damn, I love Ippudo.

Having recently started a new job in the neighborhood, I took it upon my cuisine-crazed self to explore all of the restaurants within a 4-block radius. This is the best. One afternoon around 1PM, I walked by and couldn't help but notice the swarm of lunch-breakers lined up at the entrance. I popped in to inquire about the food and wait. Ramen and a long-ass time. "I'll come back." I told the friendly hostess. The next day I took lunch at 11:45. Arrived at noon and still had a 10 minute wait! The place is huge, but the good food keeps it packed all day. I ordered the Akamaru Modern ramen as per the countless Foursquare/Yelp fans' recommendations. Kinda Expensive. Real delicious. Treat yoself.

I wish I had visited this place a lot more so that I can write a review based on many tries. But, as all of the New Yorkers would know, this place is difficult to get into. The food is really good, one of the best ramens I've had in NYC. The place itself is pretty neatly decorated, too. But I took a star off because I honestly didn't think their ramens are worth 2 hours spent on the street. Also, if you're in need to get a bowl but don't want to wait, try around 2:30pm during a weekday. It's not so crowded.

Good ramen, yes. Overpriced, yes. We arrived early (right before 11, when they open) & it was a Friday, so there was no wait at all. We wanted to get here early because of the ridiculous stories we've heard about the lines. Glad we did, or else I might not have liked this place as much! Food-wise, it really is pretty good.

This place is super hyped, but I cannot deny that they do serve a good and hearty bowl of ramen. It's good but not good enough for the price. Ippudo's noodle was on a skinnier side, but still chewy. The broth is very rich and milky in color. It's meaty and flavorful, but quite salty. The pork was tender and not fatty at all. Basically, it's everything a bowl of ramen should be. I really like their pork bun though. It's super rich, fatty and filled with tons and tons of flavor, and who can deny that it tastes better with the mayo they put in it. I also like that they put lettuce for the extra crunch. And like the ramen, the pork bun is also on a pricer side, but I think the bun is actually well worth the dough. I would definitely come back and definitely order a few buns for myself.

ÊThe service here is good, everyone is really nice and they pour water for you every 2 minutes lol...just that the food just took FOREVER to come out. Really? 25 minutes for ramen? I ordered the signature ramen dish (the Akamaru Modern), it was a bit bland...I should've added poached eggs or some other topping to make it taste a bit more better. ÊCreamy, a bit salty, not enough cabbage, pork they gave me had way too much fat on it (i know, its pork but anyways...) so I added a WHOLE lot of sriracha sauce to make it more fulfilling.

BEST RAMEN EVER. Already planning my next NYC trip so I can pay Ippudo another visit. BF and I were not intimidated by the wait at all (roughly 2 hours). Luckily I had an urge to go shopping so we walked down several blocks and killed time at Urban Outfitters. When we came back, our name was called Talk about perfect timing. All the servers greeted us with what seemed like Japanese chants in unison. It was cute. As per fellow yelpers suggested, we both decided on the Akamaru Modern and added egg and pork belly. I'm usually not a big fan of ramen because I get sick of the broth so easily.. but NO! Ippudo has it down to perfection. Not too heavy or flavorful, but still so amazingly delicious. The noodles were the PERFECT texture! It's unbelievable. We also ordered the pork belly buns which are TO DIE FOR. Absolutely hands down the best buns I've ever had... Mouth is watering as we speak.... *DROOL* Ambiance was nice, service was up to par, and the wait was worth it so I gotta go with a full five stars! Oh Ippudo, the things I would do if only you weren't 2500+ miles away... With that being said, I will be back in the very near future!

You walk in and the place is filled with so much energy. They have couples tables and then the communal ones which are my absolute favorite. Everytime I go, I order their pork buns which are so yummy! Best part is their ramen. Akamaru Modern. Only 14 dollars and worth the wait. The broth is amazing and the noodles are so YUMS.

For a place that is so hyped up, no one really needs to Yelp it to see if it's worth their time, money, and palletes. So, I didn't Yelp it. Instead, I judged it for what my blinded experience would lead me. Alas, I found that an hour and a half wait on a Monday night was ridiculous, and definitely not worth the $15 bowl of noodles. It was good. But not $15 good. For that, go fly to LA and get some $7 Orochon ramen. Atmosphere was nice though. Romantic, moody, but not quiet. They give you hot tea at the end. I heard the pork buns (appetizers) are delish but I didn't get them. What a regretful decision. But maybe not for the extra $ it would have added to my check. Speaking of checks, so my friend needed 6 cents, so I give it to him, and our server finds us outside after we pay to ask if we were unsatisfied with service-- because we didn't give him 6 cents! No way, right? Because first of all, we did pay the 6 cents. And second of all, if the server lost it while collecting the checks, then is it really that big of a deal to find 6 cents? I dunno. A pretty big turn off.

Sorry fans.... amari oishikunakatta desu. (It wasn't that delicious.) It wasn't bad, in fact I really enjoyed my ramen dish. However, I feel that the ramen just wasn't living to the high expectations that I expected from reading the Yelp reviews. I had their special: Wasabi Tonkotsu Ramen served with Ocha-zuke. I enjoyed the noodles, but I was underwhelmed with the broth. It didn't have a kick to it as much I was expecting with wasabi. I also feel that the prices are relatively high. I came in for lunch dropping a $30 bill by myself, and comparing both menus, there isn't much of a price break between the two. Loved the atmosphere though. Loved that they had set ups for different times of customers: big groups, singles, small groups. There is no ignoring the chorus of "Irasshaimase!" to all who come in from the kitchen staff when you're shown to your seat. I just don't know if this place deserves the crown of best New York ramen, or its long lines out the door... I guess I will have to come back and try it again.

I finally went to this place!!! We arrived there around 1230. There wasn't so many people waited. But they won't let u get seats until all the guests are there. one of our friend came late so we got our table at 1:15pm. The pork bun - highly recommand!!! The bun is so soft and the pork belly tastes sweet and spicy. It's kind of suprise when u find the first taste is sweet and then is spicy. BUT, they r too SMALL for me! The special ramen - ramen soup with some cheese. It tastes like some chowder things. Since i like cheese, i like this special ramen. I ordered the egg as the topping.

I came here with my husband after hearing so much about it from one of my friends having somewhat of high expectation.... The wait was 45 minutes when we arrived at 7pm since you can only do walk ins, we walked out of the restaurant and browsed around the neighborhood but when we came back, we had to let the hosts know otherwise, we might lose our position...kind of annoying. ÊThe timing from when they supposed to seat us is pretty accurate and on time. The atmosphere of the restaurant is like that of a night club except with large communal tables ... We were so hungry that we ordered the pork bun right away since we heard it's a must try. ÊThe plate came pretty fast and even though it's kind of unique, it's really nothing that special and it served with overwhelming amount of mayo in it which makes it a little heavy for such a soft bun and covered the taste of the pork. We then ordered a grilled chickens for appetizers but they mistakenly gave us the wings...we didn't mind since it looked so yummy and it did tasted really good with just enough flavors. For dinner - we ordered the Akamaru Modern for me and Miso Ramen for my husband with a side order of pork belly in each of our bowls. ÊThe ramen is okay, not the best of ramen that I have tasted but the broth is kind of good and made up the lack of taste/texture for the ramen, the pork belly was exceptional but the rest of the toppings in the soup is just okay. Ê We then finished dinner with Matcha Brulee which was also okay and tasted kind of bland. I have eaten at many ramen places from LA to Hong Kong to Japan and I really don't think the ramen here are the best I have eaten and the not the worth the price for what was served... I think all the hype is because of the ambiance and that's it.

We heard of the crazy wait time, so made an effort to get there at 10:45am, but there was already a long line! The decor was hip/mordern, and I was surprised to see how big the interior was. We ordered the Classic Hakata Ramen($15), Akamaru Modern with extra egg($17), sizzling spicy tofu($10) and Mille Crpes cake($10) for dessert. Over all, the soup was flavorful and the noodle were cooked al dente, the best part is definitely the egg, it was cooked perfectly, the egg yolk was creamy and just a little bit runny. The spicy sizzling tofu tasted similar to mapo-tofu, served in a small stone pot. The most exciting part had to be the Mille Crpes cake, it's a 20 paper thin, hand-made crpes layered with ethereally light and creamy custard, my favorite dessert while visiting Japan! Ippudo is definitely a great place to hang out and have good food. But for the prices, I can find much better ramen restaurants for cheaper in L.A.

Delicious and fun. Started with the pork buns and while they looked somewhat like a bland Momofuko rip off, they were absolutely amazing! delicious tender spicy pork, soft bun and their version with mayo and lettuce is genius. The shishito peppers were what you'd expect and the hamachi appetizer was decent, just not mind blowing. ÊWe had the house special ramen, shared it, and it was all that you read. ÊDeep, flavorful broth rich with complex flavors but not overly salty or oily and the two strips of soft savory pork make for the best ramen I've ever had. ÊThe vibe is casual rollicking fun, loud house music, young servers and cooks having a good time. ÊDefinitely will return.

OK Ippudo, after numerous visits taking all my out-of-towner friends here, I am going to have to downgrade you a star. I think you changed your noodles and got rid of my favorite ramen to date, and I never found it again after that first time I had it. Sorry Ippudo, you've just lost some of your sparkle for me. Also having to wait ~90 minutes most nights is kind of getting ridiculous. However, I am still a huge fan of the pork buns. I'd eat 3 orders of them myself if I could.

Insanely long line....but ramen is great, if you can get it that is.. Ê Their ramen is a bit more 'refined' than Minca and Momofuku, and the decor is pretty fancy. ÊBut you also pay for that. To me, the spirit of ramen should not be about refinement, it should be about the intensity of flavors and should be really economical. ÊIt should be a comfort food but not really be a high end cuisine... Nevertheless, they have great ramen, especially the half cooked soy egg that has the perfect consistency and flavor.

We went here on a rainy/snowy day and we became immediately fans of this joint. It was conveniently located near the subway exit so it wasn't too hard to find (maybe a quarter of a block from Astor Pl subway?). My BF's buddy recommended this place and told us he ate here everyday during his stay in NY. ÊThat statement piqued our interest enough that we searched for that place on such an ugly day. The shishito peppers were off the hook! ÊIt wasn't too spicy and it was a little bit sweet. The BF ordered the Wasabe Ramen and I ordered the Karaka Men. The wasabe flavor in the noodles for my BF's ramen was noticeable but I liked mine better than his. ÊThe sauce on my Karaka Men was more flavorful and it wasn't overtly spicy. ÊI loved the sesame seed grinders they have handy. ÊI kept adding a lot to my ramen. The green tea brulee was ok. ÊJust like the name, it pretty much tastes like the lovechild of creme brulee and green tea ice cream. I thought it was weird that we were seated on the same table as other patrons of the restaurant. I didn't mind it at all because everyone pretty much kept to themselves. ÊThe service was fast and the servers were nice.

Japanese Chain is just as good in the states. They are the staple and fore runners of every little ramen shop in Manhattan and has every reason to be. Ê FOOD: Authentic, delish! they have their stuff down. I've been here 3 times and always left satisfied. You have to get their pork buns! Their Aka. Modern ramen is one of the bests. ÊHowever during their seasonal periods, the spicy miso is SO GOOD! the broth is so thick and tasty and flavorful! WOW is all i could say after i finished it. More unique than any other place for sure. SERVICE: Fast, on the dot and ready to please. Expect to wait 1 to 2 hours during peak times. You can come earlier in the day and reserve, but you have to go in person on the same day. ATMOSPHERE: Really spacious inside, pretty crazy in the reception area though due to the high limits of people. ÊDecorated it to mesh traditional Japanese decor with a modern twist.. You will be impressed. SUMMARY: One of the finest in Ramen in Manhattan, nay in the states! bring friends and come early. You won't be disappointed. However if you want a more intimate and authentic dining experience, Totto Ramen isn't bad either : )

A friend wanted to go here while we were visiting and so we went for Sunday lunch. Our wait was 30 minutes but when we were walking out, the waiting room was so stuffed full of people, you couldn't move. The place is adorable! They greet you in loud Japanese when you are being led to your table by the hostess and then you sit in these adorable seats that were obviously custom made. We had the pork bun appetizer which was delicious but very gamey. We also had two different types of ramen (I don't think you can go wrong here but I recommend staying away from the cheese one simply because it's exhaustive to the palate). Finally, leave room for dessert because the matcha creme brulee is pretty spectacular!

******Yelper reviewing this place number 3075****** Finally Lost my virginity to Ippudo (Yes, Tonight). After cheating on Ippudo with other ramen places. ÊI thought Ippudo was not worth the Wait, Was not worth to eat. Tonight, You surprised me with the Pork Bun. With their Special sauce and mayo that made me had an orgasmic taste in my MOUTH. Miso Ramen $ 15.00 (with extra egg for $ 2.00). ÊTook one star down because the pork at Totto was better than here. ÊEverything else was good, ÊALSO a big scoop of garlic was in the center of the bowl (Which I don't recommend you to use all of them) The soup was pretty good that I was able to zip half of the bowl (compare to other ramen places this was not salty). An incredible experience that I'm not sure if I can handle you again Ippudo (this time waited less than 30 minutes because it was before 7 PM dinner time). ÊService was superb!, Everyone was super friendly and also NOTED me that if I was not able to finish my meal (my pork bun), I was not able to take it home. Sadly to say, I will have to do everything in the room with Ippudo.

Had lunch here early fall of this year. We must have walked over 15 -20 blocks from our hotel in the blistering NYC wind...brrr it was cold. I really worked up an appetite form the long walk. Ramen noodles was a hit, just perfect for the weather! I had the Karaka Men with onsen tamago (poached egg), kakuni (braised pork belly), bakudan (spicy paste). ÊBest ramen I've had. So much flavors, so delish! Also, had the Harata pork buns & shishito (Japanese fried peppers with yuzu salt) for appetizers. Oh yea also had the Tako wasabi (Raw baby octopus in wasabi sauce) Overall, FIVE stars!

I finally made it back and felt the need to write another review! Damn I love this place! From the good-lookin' staff Êupstairs to the the ramen boys downstairs by the ladies room! Oh and the ramen too. puhahhaa. First off, typical one hour wait at the bar. Japanese bartender, plus! Doesn't hurt to have eye candy at 1 pm in the afternoon, and minus the fact that he made really great cocktails Cocktail 1) Hakata (Sake, Gin, Lemon Grapefruit Juice) Ê Ê$8 Cocktail 2) Lychee martini, one of the best I've ever had. Hate the syrupy ones Cocktail 3) Wine.. gettin mah buzz on... Seated and greeted, and had amazing service! Appetizers1) Hamachi Carpaccio Ê Ê$13 Thinly sliced yellowtail sashimi with Japanese carpaccio sauce. Hungover and wanted something fresh n light. It was spot on! Appetizer 2) Umakara Tori Tatsuta Age Ê Ê$10 Marinated chicken, thinly coasted with rice powder and delicately fried. ÊServed with spicy chili sauce. Hungover and needed something greazzzzy. Completely hit the spot. Main Attraction: Akamaru Modern Ê Ê$15 The original "Tonkotsu" noodle soup topped with Ippudo's secret "Umami Dama" miso paste, pork chashu, cabage, kikurage, scallions, and fragrant garlic oil. Hungover and needed "The soup fix" This was to die for!!! I also added the leaf mustard, and seasoned salt boiled egg. So yeah, basically the most expensive ramen I've ever eaten TWICE! I'm so proud to say that too! Last but not least... us ladies made a stop to the washroom downstairs. Walked by and noticed a little dungeon with two guys pushing out fresh ramen. Pretty effin' cool!! They have this small jailhouse peephole so either 1) to sight-see or 2) to keep ventilation going for the guys. Well I just saw noodles, machinery, and midsections of two miscellaneous guys, and just strolled on through to the washroom and had a mini convo w girlfriend. gf: the guys making the ramen is so hot! me: really? the chubby one texting or the skinny one? gf: he's not chubby me: u sure? lemme go see. So I crept by and peeped through and sure enough, he was a cutie. Snap a photo, and thanked them for the delish food, and walking the streets we went.

Went a second time, got the same thing, still tastes great. PLUS, I found out the reservation system: They only take walk-in reservations for the same day, at least two hours in advance. So, if you want to eat dinner at 8, go in a few hours before and put your name down, then arrive at 7:45. They'll most likely seat you late, but it beats a 2 hour wait.

My only negative comment is how rude the host was. My friend cut her toe on the door entering the restaurant and nobody helped her. I assumed they didn't understand what was happening even though it was somewhat obvious. After waiting for 2 hours to be seated I asked the host how much longer and he said he had just called us, but he didn't, and gave me a hard time. He acted like he wasn't going to give us a table but finally decided to seat us. Food was great but rude host.

This is the best place to eat Ramen in the city. I have tried several different types of Ramen here, but my favorite is the Shiromaru Hakata Classic. The appetizers are also very good, in particular the Tako Wasabi and the Hirata Buns. The decor is quite nice as well. The bellowing of japanese greetings from across the restaurant is characteristic of Yakitori and Ramen restaurants, and does seem to fit the atmosphere. Since there are Japanese wait staff, the opportunity to converse in Japanese is there too, which is nice, seeing as a number of other nearby Ramen restaurants are Korean owned. There is a gargantuan difference between the average Ramen restaurant and a place like Ippudo, that is praised by both New Yorkers and Japanese alike.

How good could noodles be? Really !@#*(&ing good. ÊI came here last Friday night with three girlfriends, we had a reservation for 9pm and sat at about 9:40. ÊYou can only make reservations if you go in person during the day, which is sort of annoying, but the place seems to always have an insane line so I guess the alternative would be making a reservation months in advance. Anyways, the food was great. ÊWe got an avocado crab dip with asian chips for an appetizer and each got different noodles, all delicious. ÊHowever, a weird incident did happen. ÊA table near us put a note on a napkin asking us to buy their table pork buns because the staff would not let them order the pork buns themselves. ÊThere was money in the napkin so we decided to do the mystery table a favor. ÊAs soon as we ordered the pork buns, our waitress asked us if someone else had asked us to order them, we lied. When the pork buns came, restaurant staff surrounded our table watching our every move and clearly noticed that we weren't touching "our" pork buns. ÊWe were all weirded out. ÊFinally when all the waitresses/hostesses etc. left us alone a girl came over to our table quickly took the pork buns and scurried back to her own table. ÊAs soon as this happened all hell broke loose. ÊAll the waitresses came back and started huffing and storming around. ÊOf course, were confused and scared to eat our food. When our neighboring table was leaving, we asked them why they weren't allowed to order pork buns... restaurants want more money don't they? They told us that their friend came late for a reservation and the staff would not let her order pork buns on her birthday. ÊThe waitress angrily corrected them and said that was "bull shit" and they had been there for 5 hours switching out guests to the reserved table. ÊI'm sure the story was somewhere in between the two but nonetheless, it was weird. Back to the restaurant - hip, modern, Japanese atmosphere. ÊThey played good music. Overall enjoyed it and the pork buns incident was amusing if nothing else.

Yum! The broth was delicious. We ordered the original. Wish we would've tried the one with duck! Vegetarian ramen was also fantastic, especially if you like the miso and seaweed flavors. Made me think of sushi but in delicious soup form! NOTE: you can choose between thin straight ramen noodles and the typical curly ramen noodles. the server didn't tell us this, but I overheard the people at the table next to us discuss this option with their waiter. wish I would've known! The tofu egg appetizer was delicious. We slurped the broth that came with it. Heavenly!

First off, their pork buns are so good! It makes me want to go back there just for the buns itself! Their ramen is amazing, but I like Totto's a bit better, maybe it was because of the kind of ramen i ordered at Ippudo's. About the wait, I went there at around 1pm, on a Wednesday and we only waited for 30 minutes, or even shorter. People who were there before us, got tables quickly, so it went by pretty fast.

So I went to Ippudo and I managed to not jizz in my jeans upon the first time I slurped their ramen into my mouth. ÊHere's the incredible and true story of how I managed to contain my manly excitement. Being a guy who lives by himself in the East Village, one who is too lazy to cook, and who is a part of the Yelp community, constantly surrounded by self-proclaimed foodies, it is impossible for me to go about my meager existence in this beautiful yet tragically sadistic city without hearing about Ippudo once or twice a week. ÊThis left me with two problems. ÊProblem number one: every self-indulgent hipster or yuppie and their mothers wanted to give the place a try, which meant there was always an incredibly long wait. ÊSupposedly a wait of up to an hour and a half was not uncommon. ÊOne of my co-workers said he would put his name down and just go somewhere else for drinks and wait for them to call. ÊProblem number two: expectations were high. There was no way in hell I was going to wait an hour and a half to get a bowl of noodles. ÊI'd wait that long to meet Olivia Munn and get her autograph, but not for a bowl of noodles. ÊActually I waited four hours to meet Olivia Munn and get her autograph at Midtown Comics. ÊWhile on my way back to the neighbourhood, and feeling a little hungry, I was thinking I should grab something to eat. ÊI happened to have been checking my facebook on my phone and one of my friends had just posted that she got into Ippudo by herself at 10:45. ÊThis was Monday, and by the time I was a couple of blocks from Ippudo, it was 11:15. ÊJust me and my indignant self at 11:15 on a Monday night. ÊPerfect, let me try this. Alright, so I was seated right away. ÊExcellent. ÊI was happy I did not have to wait at all. ÊI was given a seat at one of the big round tables to share with other people. ÊThis was apparently dimsum style. ÊIt brought back so many sweet memories of the time I lived in Flushing. ÊBut the similarity stopped there. ÊUnlike all the other ramen shops in the East Village, Ippudo was spacious, dimly lit, and had swanky decor. ÊIt was also very, very loud. ÊI had no idea why the entire staff was yelling every time a party was finally able to get seated. ÊIt wasn't like they were the ones who just waited an hour and a half to finally get a bowl of noodles. ÊMaybe they were just happy for the customers. Ê"You finally got a seat! ÊHooray!" On to the menu. ÊThe Shiromaru Hakata Classic caught my eye for having pork loin and red pickled ginger. ÊThen I thought, would this singular bowl of noodles be enough? ÊI had better order another dish, too. ÊThe Kurobuta Steak Ginger Sauce caught my eye as well for being grilled... Êpork loin... Êtopped with a fried poach egg. ÊYes I love pork loin. The Kurobuta Steak Ginger Sauce came out quickly enough. ÊIt was pretty good, but nothing too memorable. ÊThe grilled pork was tender for being grilled, and the "Ippudo ginger Japanese sauce" was savoury and added moisture to the dish. ÊThe fried poach egg, however, wasn't really necessary and I thought it didn't really add anything to the dish. Ê A group of three NYU girls had sat down at my big round table between the time I ordered and the time my grilled pork dish came. ÊSomehow their food arrived before my second dish, the noodles, came. ÊAs if that wasn't annoying enough, I also had to watch one of them hold her chopsticks about an inch from the ends that touched the food. ÊTo add insult to injury, one of the girls asked me to take a picture of them with her Nikon, and proceeded to tell me how to operate her crappy DNothing. ÊAre you kidding me? ÊI know how to use a damn Nikon. But I digress. ÊOn to my noodles. ÊI have to admit that the broth was the best ramen broth I had ever tasted in this city. ÊFor me, the difference was in the aftertaste. ÊAt each and every slurp of the broth, the savoury flavour lingered in my mouth and the sides of my tongue like Dolores O'Riordan lingered in my mind after watching my first Cranberries video. ÊThe pork loin, especially delicious for having swam in that broth, was so tender, it was ready to melt on my tongue and slide down the underbelly of my mouth as soon as I took a bite. ÊAs for the noodles themselves, they were different from other ramen shops in the neighbourhood in that they were more uniform, and they were also a bit on the mushy side. ÊI actually prefer noodles that are not uniform, but that's just me. Yes, I agree Ippudo is the best ramen shop in this city. ÊBut no, I did not have a gastronomical orgasm upon eating their ramen. ÊSo there you have it.

Its as good as it gets in NYC! A pricey place for ramen but worth it. Got the kogashi ramen and Êjtried the akamaru ramen both amazing. The nitamago (salt boil egg) is to die for, one of the best I ever had! COOL tip : Kae-dama $2 extra: ÊKae-dama is a system that offers you an extra serving of noodles. When you have almost finished your first serving of noodles, order by saying, "Kae-dama, please". In a few minutes the server will bring you another 'ball of noodles', and put it in the soup. At that time, you must have enough amount of the soup in the bowl to accommodate the new noodles, that is, you shouldn't drink much of the soup if you are going to order the Kae-dama.

I had the Hirata buns (pork) and Karaka Kogashi Miso Ramen...everything was perfect. We arrived at about 4:45pm, just in time to get in during the first wave. I recommend going early since the place fills up fast. Service was timely and polite. Atmosphere was lively. This place never disappoints me and is becoming a MUST every time I visit NYC. **we went to Ippudo with our daughter last time and while it doesn't scream "kid friendly", our waiter went above and beyond what we had expected.

Weeeell - I really want to give it 3.5 stars so 4 is a bit of a round-up. ÊI guess I'm doing that b/c the rest of the menu is probably decent even though I didn't have anything beyond the Akamaru Modern ramen, and the interior was pretty hip (although all the waiters yelling "Irashaimase!!" at the top of their lungs when you first walk in is disconcerting). So the Akamaru is thin ramen in tonkotsu soup base with a small dollop of "umami sauce" or some sort of red sauce with a few bits of ground meat in the middle of the bowl, on top of the ramen. Ê3 slices of chashu, a half-boiled egg I ordered, green onions and a few pieces of bamboo shoots complete it, I think. ÊTry a bit of the umami sauce before you mix it into the soup. ÊI liked the sauce, but it got lost once mixed into the tonkotsu soup. ÊCutting to the chase, the Akamaru was good enough so that if it was in the Bay Area and you couldn't stand the line at Orenchi Ramen, you'd be fine going here. ÊMaybe even about as good as Santouka. ÊBut not as good as Ramen Dojo.

This place was great! ÊYou've got to love a place that serves almost nothing but ramen and the servers walk around wearing "I Heart Ramen" shirts. ÊThe ramen is expensive ($14-17) but delicious. ÊI had the Akamaru Modern - a giant bowl of mild but richly flavorful broth with roast pork and a heap of miso paste. ÊThe pork must have been roast pork belly - it was so tender, succulent, and rich, without being too fatty. ÊYum. I also love the GIANT spoons that come with the ramen - they were about 3 inches in diameter, had a hook at the end of the spoon to prevent the ramen from sliding into the bowl, and your spoon came with its very own spoonrest. Ê The pork buns were very good, but not as good as Momofuku's. ÊThe pork belly was deliciously tender, but I missed the sweet hoison and pickled cucumber, and I could swear the buns were less soft and delicate. That said, still delicious. Ê I'd have a tough time deciding whether this place's ramen beats Momofuku's - they're both top notch!

AKAMARU MODERN. 'Nuff said. =) Visiting Ippudo was on my to-do list on my last trip to the NYC. Boy was it worth the 30 minute or so wait. It was definitely one of the top 3 bowls of ramen I've had in the US, if not THE BEST. However, my base is in LA. We have plenty of ramen options (and they're getting better almost every month with new stores opening up), and for CHEAP. Actually, let's just say NY prices are inflated because a bowl of ramen in Japan is like 600 yen or so ($7~8 USD). Not trying to start a ramen feud or anything, believe me I love the NYC and all, but seriously... paying $12~$16 or whatever at Ippudo and Momofuku vs. $8~$10 at Santouka or Daikokuya (which are the bigger LA ramen names you'd hear although I personally don't care for any of them)? I don't know... But if Ippudo decides to come to LA and serve an Akamaru Modern at about $10 *hint hint*, that's the end of the world for me. I'd be in ramen bliss. Namu amida butsu... 5 stars for the ramen, but docking 1 star (more like 0.6 star) for the ramen-chic thing. I know, it's quite subjective, but I don't get it. Ramen is street food, soul food, found in hole-in-the-wall dumps underneath a JR overcrossing in Tokyo, etc... made me feel like I was eating ramen at a posh bar or something.

I almost cried when I had their ramen. I had not been back to Japan for a while and I was longing for a good bowl of ramen. Recently I went back to Japan and tried some ramen there. If I could have other good ramen, I wouldn't give 4 stars for this place, considering long wait and even taste, but for the time being, best ramen in NY that I have tried so far.

I strongly advise you to NOT come here on a weekend during prime lunch/dinner hours. I tried coming to Ippudo's on a Saturday at 6pm, and the hostess informed me that we wouldn't be seated until 10:30. 4.5 hours, are you KIDDING ME? So we ended up leaving and came back at noon on the following Monday, and waited a little under 5 minutes. Service here was great! Our waiter was very friendly and since he knew it was our first time he went through his personal recommendations and was really helpful in helping us pick what ramens to order. A MUST: Get the pork buns, you won't be disappointed. I actually think I enjoyed the pork buns more than my ramen. We had the Classic, Akamaru, and the Special (Wasabi broth) ramen. The one that really stood out to me was the special with the wasabi broth; the wasabi flavor added a kick. The noodles were cooked perfectly, I just wish they would put more ingredients into each serving, I think I only got 2 small and thin pieces of pork in my bowl. I think I had my expectations set way too high for Ippudo's after hearing all of my friends rave about it, and not to mention the insane number of reviews this place got on Yelp. Don't get me wrong, the ramen was good, better than most other ramen places I have been to, but it just didn't blow my mind like I had expected.

Best Ramen Place EVER!!! Food is AMAZING you just have to try this place yourself. I went to New York for a vacation wasn't expecting much from this place but was recommended by so much people so I decided to check it out. The wait was ridiculously long( worth every hour of my life) especially at night so try going right at the morning to reserve a spot. The place is decorated nicely and there's a bar right in the front of the restaurant how cool is that! You can have a couple drinks while waiting to get your table. The environment is just so warm and welcoming which put me in the mood. I say it felt like home for a second. Well the music was great, went very well with the restaurant. No mainstream music like other restaurants which was surprising, they had a lot of underground japanese artist. The customer service was great and food came really fast and made perfectly. Now onto the food which was just amazing! We ordered the pork buns for appetizers which was just.... just idk how to describe it. It was soooo GOOD! It was pretty pricey but c'mon YOLO and I only got 1 for $5 but totally worth it! One is definitely not enough!The ramen tasted great too never knew it can taste like that. Its not like ordinary ramen you get. I ordered the Akamaru Modern and added the pork belly with an egg. You have to get the pork belly it just wouldnt taste the same. Pork belly was so tender and the meat felt like it melted in my mouth dont know that is possible. The flavoring was perfect and the noodles were made by themselves. SLURP SLURP! Overall this place was fantastic! Everything was perfect and defiitely will go again when I visit. I wouldn't mind blowing hella money for this place again so you shouldn't either! Ramen will never taste the same again trust!

The Akamaru modern ramen with a soft boiled egg is worth the long wait. The broth is rich and flavorful and the noodles are textured and well cooked. Be aware that the noodles for the Akamaru modern and the Classic are slighly different. Personally, I would skip the pork buns in favor of the Momofoku buns (Ippudo uses a spicy mayo base whereas Momofoku uses a sweeter hoisin sauce; Ippudo buns also have less pork belly and is missing the pickled cucumber to tie all the favors together). I'm a big fan of the decor and it's a great place to get together with a group of friends for lunch or dinner. If you want to skip the long wait, come at 3 or 4pm.

4 stars for the Akamaru Modern, -1 star for the pork buns. ÊNot going to lie, my expectations for this place was pretty high. ÊThe ramen did not disappoint! ÊBest ramen I've ever had. ÊOnly small nitpick is that the noodles could be a little more firm. ÊThat aside, the broth was rich and exploding with flavors. Ê Their pork bun was good, but not OMFG-delicious! ÊSmall shout out to Facing East Taiwanese restaurant in Bellevue, WA for having the best pork buns I've ever tasted. ÊThis bun in comparison, falls short. ÊOn its own, I could see why others might rave about it. Ê Quick advice: Êpay attention to the restaurant hours here. ÊWe came at around 4:45pm (the restaurant opens at 5pm) and already there was a short line. ÊFifteen minutes into waiting the line became even longer... Plan ahead, know how many people are in your group and get there early! ÊWaiting sucks. ÊEating is always more fun.

Thursday late lunch at 2:30 PM - no wait. Nice interior decor. Larger than expected with booths and benches and all sorts of seats. Pretty fancy looking for a ramen shop. Service is fine. Food came out quite promptly. Barely any waiting. I guess they're trained to be as quick and efficient as possible. Pork Buns may have been worth it when they were a few bucks each, but at $5? I cannot say that they are worth it. Bread part was perfect. Pork was too sweet. Not enough vegetables. *sigh* I can't justify spending $10 on them ever again. Ramen was on the mark though. No complaints. They do know how to make good ramen. Broth was flavored well (maybe a teensy bit too salty for some). Noodles, cooked perfectly. The condiments are a great addition. As I looked around though, I saw a lot of diners eating rice bowl entrees. Perhaps those are worth exploring. Anyways... if you must, try the pork buns, but don't say I didn't warn you. Ramen is nod-worthy, but I'm not BLOWN away, so go and see for yourself.

This place is both roomy and cramped. It's roomy in the dining room and cramped everywhere else. I thought that I'd beat the crowd and show up at 9:30, but I was wrong - I still ended up waiting for 25 minutes or so. I was seated at the bar in front of the kitchen and watched them work on the appetizers being pushed out. It seemed as if each cook has his/her own app and will cook just that for the rest of the night. I had the Akamaru Modern Ramen. The miso paste they made tasted slightly spicy, but when mixed in that flavor was not present. But that broth was really amazing, full of meaty flavor and some fat grease (not a whole lot). They give you a lot of noodles and by the end, I was on pace to having no more soup with noodles leftover. However, the only thing wrong with the dinner was the chasu pork. The fatty part of it was cooked until it would melt, but unfortunately it's attached to the rest of the meat, and that was overcooked, it seemed. It was dry and I had a hard time chewing it. tl;dr the broth is the best I've ever had, lots of noodles, chasu might be overcooked.

Consistently puts out some of the most satisfying meals I've had in the city. I like everything about this place. ÊThey have one featured type of dish and they do it very well; service is polite, competent, and efficient; ingredients are high-quality and fresh; and the preparations are always done just right, consistently. My dishes of choice: shishito peppers with yuzu salt (simple and delicious), cucumber/sesame oil salad, pork hirita buns (we ordered chicken buns this time around for the hell of it, but they do not compare, not even close, don't waste the calories), and the akamaru modern. ÊAdding pork belly is also highly recommended. ÊProbably overkill but it's so damn tasty. The wait sucks but what I appreciate about this place is that I know I'm going to get something good at the end of the wait, and it's going to taste just like I remembered it. Ê I always find it funny when I'm waiting inside and see the reservationists repeat, "one and a half to two hours" to everyone, over and over, and the jaws of 80% of the people who come through drop, and they just stand there for like a minute contemplating what to do. ÊPut your name down and keep the line moving. ÊI promise it's worth it.

More hype than substance. Ê This review is even despite the fact that I didn't need to wait the requisite 1+ hour that everyone speaks about. ÊI was actually able to get seated within 15 minutes of getting there. The ramen was fine. ÊAt this point, in comparison to your other ramen options in the city, it is not something that will blow your mind away. ÊIt's just pretty good ramen, and that's all it is. Ê Perhaps the most annoying part of eating here is the constant yelling of mispronounced Japanese by the waitstaff and the soundtrack from DJ Hero in the background. ÊIt makes you feel like you're trapped in a Japanese themed restaurant. Ê There are comparable tasting ramen places throughout the city that don't have the ridiculous wait time. ÊWhat the Ippudo difference? ÊAt other places you can't tell people you ate at Ippudo.

Nothing is certain but death and taxes....and a two hour wait at Ippudo. I've eaten here several times now so I will say this is a rather fair review. ÊThe energy and ambience of the place is really hip, and all the bartenders are unique and nice. ÊThe ramen is admittedly delicious, though my favorite by far is the Karaka Miso Ramen (slightly spicy). ÊIt's wickedly flavorful and everything has a perfect texture from the noodles to the meat. ÊI'm also a big fan of their pork buns and fried Japanese peppers. ÊBasically, the food here is a hit. Now, don't get all excited thinking you can just stroll in and grab a quick bowl of ramen. ÊOne time I came on a gross rainy Monday evening thinking I could get lucky...no. Ê2 hours for a reservation of 3. ÊThere is no getting around the wait so you just have to live with it. ÊSo if you're super hungry, Ippudo is probably not your best dinner choice. tip: My suggestion to people would be to get the ball of ginger on the side or none at all. ÊIts just too strong, and I grew up hating ginger because sometimes I would mistaken chunks of ginger for meat in my mom's stir fried pork and my gag reflex would trigger.

Actually pretty disappointed with the ramen. ÊI got the Shiromaru Hakata Classic bowl which is the very first one on the list. ÊIt tasted like Paula Deena made this ramen. ÊThe broth was too rich in terms of fattiness that tasted kind of like butter. ÊThis bowl was 2 stars. ÊI feel that people with a more American palette will appreciate this dish better. Also, I though I appreciated that you can get an extra bowl of noodles for $2, I was annoyed that you had to pay $2 to get a bowl of spicy sauce. ÊThe ramen does not come spicy originally. ÊApparently, you need to add this sauce to make it spicy. Ê Though extremely disappointed with this dish, I do wish to go back to try their other stuff. ÊThis place is undeniably trendy and I've heard really great things about their pork buns.

Not that ippudo needs another review, but I'll add my two cents anyway. This place is YUMMY! I wasn't sure whether to believe the hype but now that I've been I totally agree that this is the best ramen in the city. I love spicy food, and their Karaka Men really hits the spot. If in doubt, their classic ramen is a good choice to try as well. The only down side is the wait can be grueling--once I was quoted 2 1/2 hours--so try to go on a weekday for lunch if at all possible.

Eh, not sure how I feel about this place. Went on a Saturday early afternoon and waited about 25 minutes, not too bad. It's a pretty small place, and the atmosphere is loud and typical "chic-y" Asian. The white dudes (servers) yelling things in Japanese is a little tacky. I mean, it's supposed to be authentic, we get it. It just seemed a little... forced. Anyway, we sat at the bar and I ordered the same thing I always get at any ramen house, traditional tonkotsu ramen, extra (a lot) green onions/scallions. I thought their tonkotsu broth was really quite good, but the noodles themselves were strange. They didn't look like any other ramen noodle I've had before, even in Japan. They were a bit too thin and therefore difficult to pick up with chopsticks. Don't get me wrong, the ramen was very very good. I just don't think I'd wait more than a half hour to get it. When I compared this place to Hide-Chan, I'd say both were even. I do like Hide-Chan's atmosphere WAY better. More authentic. Hide-Chan's tonkotsu ramen is just as satisfying, IMO. The broth at Ippudo is ever so slightly better (less salty), but I think I like the noodles better at Hide-Chan. All things being equal, if it's a snowy cold night and there's a 2 hour wait at Ippudo and a 15 minute wait at Hide-Chan, I'm going to the latter. PS We also had the pork buns. They're good. Not sure if I'd spend the money and calories on them though. The ramen is the star here. Don't bother with other 'fillers'.

I can't think of a better way to write my 100th Yelp review than on my favorite NY resto (and in my top 5 in america; haven't decided a chronological order but Ippudo is pretty much #1 as of recent). So a little over a year ago, I discovered what it was like to have a beyond earth experience with food when I devoured the Akamaru Modern ramen bowl at Ippudo. Now I've never been to Japan, nor have had ramen (prior to Ippudo) that leaves me with the feeling of wanting to swim in it all the live long day; but going to Ippudo gives me the impression that I am in Japan, swimming in the best ramen noodles and broth and pork known to man. I've tried almost all the bowls and all are stand-out, it really just comes down to preference. Akamaru Modern and Miso have been my favorites. I like my noodles hard *that's what she said* but even the regular noodles have a perfect bite to them. Again, all about preference but EVERYTHING is guaranteed to be good. Other dishes that are just as mouth-watering are the Hirata chicken wings and the Hirata pork buns, Êand the Japanese cucumbers which is the best appetizer ever created. If you still have room for dessert, the match green tea creme brule is amazing, as everything else on the menu is. Seriously. The wait is totally worth it, people. There is a bar (with a great selection of japanese cocktails, beer, and sake) & you're in the east village so walk around outside. If you're bored waiting then you are a boring person. Choose to leave and you will be missing out on an amazing food experience in NY.

Ok. Everyone hears alot about Ippudo. Is it REALLY all this n' that? Short answer? - Yes. The ramen is the best I've had in NY. It really is. And enough CANNOT be said about the pork buns (or chicken if that's ur stylo). SOOO f'n good. Great location, as its just a few blocks south of Union Sq. And the staff there is fun and very friendly. Ok. The downside ... and I'm not even gonna SAY "the price", because that's neither here nor there. Depends on how much you get in addition to the bowl of Ramen. Throw in alcohol? And if you are taking a date there and are paying for TWO? Yeah, It can really get up there, and QUICKLY ... But if you just stick with ONLY ramen, its not too bad. The only REAL downside is the wait time. If you plan on eating Ippudo, you better "Plan" on eating Ippudo. Meaning you go BEFORE you are hungry, leave your name, and go do something else for an hour and half - 2 hours or so (the wait can be like that on weekends, easily). Luckily there's plenty to do in the area, as its way too crowded to sit and drink there at the bar. Or, if ur not up for that, weekdays in the early after afternoon, say after 2pm, you should be able to get in there without a wait at all. So ... yeah. Aside from that minor quibble, Ippudo is as good as it gets ... I kinda want to buy their t-shirt ...

For the wait time and the $200 bill, not really sure I was loving Ippudo. Last Thursday 5 coworkers and myself came here for my boss' send off dinner. We arrived at about 6:15, and we were knew were going to have to wait which was fine. It was rather busy, and we saw the line outside and I never thought we'd get a spot. But it was a 30 minute wait, and we killed time at the bar where they do 2 for 1 happy hour but only with their two draft beers. Which is kind of stupid but people buy into it. Once our name was finally called we were looped around to the back to a table in the corner. The table was extremely low and almost uncomfortable. After being there for not even 15 seconds, the hostess came back over and told us that a bigger table that was reservation opened up and if we wanted it, it was our. We were all over that! After being seated once again, we started to check out the menu. We figured it would be best to just order appetizers and have a few bites of everything. We had scanned the menu and narrowed the list down but of course wanted to pick the waitress' brain to see if we missed anything. We were basically right on point we everything we had planned to order. She suggested that if the 6 of us were going to share to order anywhere between 6 to 8 plates. We ordered, edamame, 2 orders of pork buns, one order of shrimp buns, Hamachi Carpaccio, crab and avocado dip, the shrimp special of the day, Tofu Yasai Tar Tar and the Maguro Tataki. The edamame of course was your standard. It was served with this powder that we were all trying to guess what it was, we were saying everything from ginger to mustard seeds but it turned out to be a citrus based powder. Added an interesting taste to it, but I certainly wasn't getting any real hints of citrus. The buns! The girls who had the pork buns, died and went to heaven. They were so good, they ordered another round of them. The shrimp buns were also just as good. It was one piece of shrimp, tempura style, in a light airy bun accompanied by a piece of iceberg lettuce and a spicy mayo sauce. The Hamachi Carpaccio, which was thinly sliced yellowtail sashimi with Japanese carpaccio sauce. This was just okay. The presentation was outstanding, but when fish is going to be served liked this, for me personally I want it to be really cold and this was room temperature. The crab and avocado dip was an absolute stand out and I think everyone at the tables favorite by far. It was rather simple too, it was basically just a guac base with crab meat in it. Served with what might have been the smallest box of chips and for more chips it was $2. We hadn't quite finished our dip and the buser had cleared it from our table. The restaurant manager was kind enough to notice this and brought us out a little bit of a smaller version, which we finished before it even hit the table! The shrimp special of the day, was grilled shrimp in a clear garlic sauce. This was another dish that I thought was really good, out of the numerous dishes that we had. The shrimp was grilled nicely and the sauce had hint of flavor but also of chili flakes. It was topped with potato sticks which I haven't had in ages but the two paired nicely together. The Tofu Yasai Tar Tar. What a disappointed. And I feel bad because I was the one who wanted this because of my veghead diet. Talk about boring. They could have made this dish much better by marinading the tofu in the sesame dressing rather than the suggestion of just pouring it over the dish. Again the presentation was great but the flavors didn't come close to its pretty looks. Finally, the Maguro Tataki. This was raw tuna, served with avocado and grapefruits and in the grapefruit juice. The tuna acted a bit like a sponge and soaked up the grapefruit juice, giving this dish a citrusy bite to it. For the busy eatery, the service was very attentive and took good care of us. The decor of this place was really a stand out as well. While it was dark, with the tonal colors of the wall and the giant stick tree brighten the joint up! I'm not sure I'd be running back here anytime soon, although I would like to try the ramen. But with that being said, I'm sure I can get ramen in Ctown for a better price and maybe a little more authentic!

Was visiting New York during Halloween when the storm came in. Luckily my friends and I got to enjoy this place before the snow, rain and wind came in. The wait here is pretty long but just try to be smart about it. My friends that I was visiting decided to put our name in and go to another bar while we wait. Such a GREAT idea! After an hour or so feeling buzzed and ready to eat, our table was ready for us in 10-15 minutes. We started out with the Yamitsuki Goma Kyuri ( cucumbers with sesame seed oil) and the Hirata buns. YUM! The cucumbers were refreshing and buns were a good meaty, sweet way to start off the meal. As for the ramen I went with the Akamaru Modern with Bakudan (spicy paste) and the Nitamago (boiled egg). This was by far the best ramen I've ever tasted. The broth had a great thick consistency and every slurp was amazing! If I could just enjoy the broth by itself, that alone would be heavenly good. This place is definitely worth the wait to enjoy the mouthgasmic experience of delicious ramen. Especially a great way to warm up on a cold night. If I ever come back to NYC, this place will definitely be on my list of places to chow down at again.

we came for lunch before it opened and lined up for 1/2 hour. The restaurant has an impressive bowl collection on the wall and a bamboo tree near the kitchen. We ordered akamaru modern - ok, thought the soup would be more flavorful, but the noodles were the most disappointing part. they are textureless and overdone. pork pieces are also flavorless. edamame - ok, expensive for just edamame pork chop - ok, too salty overall, the experience was disappointing with the 2 hour wait. The noodles are the most disappointing part, just overdone and too soft.

Went with my boyfriend on Saturday night, we were told a wait time of 1.5-2 hours. Actual wait time was 1 hour and 15 minutes. The host was really unfriendly, but whatever. On to the food... We started out with the Hirata Chicken Wings, which were alright. The drumette was super dry, but the wings were great. Awesome sauce. The Pork Hirata Buns were good, but super saucy. The bf really liked the Kamo Sukiyaki. I thought the duck was overly dry, but he didn't mind. The Akamaru Modern Ramen was tasty. The noodles were good and the broth was rich with flavor. Overall, pretty good, but not as good as Santouka Ramen in LA. The service was good once we were seated. It's pretty loud in there with the servers yelling out orders and constant irasshaimases with each new party that enters the floor. The prices seemed a bit high. It was good, but if I were to go back and had to wait over 30 minutes, I'd find somewhere else to eat.

I flew 2000 miles just for the PORK BUNS! Need I say more? Don't be discouraged when you arrive and they tell you there is a 2 hour wait. You can get the Pork Buns at the bar! Yes, that's right! You can grab a drink and some pork buns while you wait to be seated! (In an effort to keep my review from sounding redundant and excessively long, I'll be abbreviating.. P.B. = Pork Buns) Ok so I actually flew into NY for a wedding but I had to make sure i made it over to Ippudo for the P.B. Even at $9 an order (2 per order), its worth every penny! My girlfriend and I barely squeezed through the door at 3pm and was told they were seating anymore patrons even though they say they're open until 3:30pm for lunch. This was quite upsetting. So I begged, pleaded, winked, flirted, bribed..ok well maybe not but I did explain to the host how I flew all the way out from California to eat here and wouldn't take no for an answer! She said to hang out for 10 minutes or so and she would let me know. In the meantime, "4 orders of pork buns please!" After devouring 6 of the 8 P.B., we were seated so we could eat some ramen too. Not going to lie, I was already getting full by the time we sat down since I had so many P.B. Against my better judgement, I decided to be a fatty and order a bowl of ramen anyway. I'm sure glad I did! I don't remember the ramen being so good last time I was here but this time I remember all the little details. Flavorful soup base, noodles cooked to perfection, and just the right amount of meat in the bowl so that you don't run out, or have an excess. I tried to order another set of P.B. to-go for our friends who couldn't make it and was told they don't have any to-go boxes in an effort to allow their patrons to try and experience their food hot and delicious! I can definitely respect that so I just took a few pictures and showed them what they missed out on :D If you're ever in the area, this is definitely a must try place. Even if you're on a tight schedule, you really need to rearrange your plans to come eat!

Forget Momofuku, imho, Ippudo makes the best Ramen in the city. Not cheap either, and the wait is long (and sometimes annoying since I've waited only to go in to find empty seats all around the place) but food wise, it's delicious (if a tad overpriced for some things on the menu). Service inside is great. If only the maitre D up front was as nice, but I guess they can be snooty with the crazy wait.

ippudo was probably the most anticipated restaurant during my last trip to new york...i saved it for last...just before departing out of LGA... my dining partner and i got there about 15 minutes before opening and there was already a line... was somewhat disappointed...except for the hirata pork buns...they were really tasty... http://www.yelp.com/userÉ http://www.yelp.com/userÉ... i thought the ramen was okay. Êi had the hiromaru hakata classic http://www.yelp.com/userÉ and kaarage with rice http://www.yelp.com/userÉ i enjoyed the flavorful broth and the fatty berkshire pork, but the noodle was somewhat of a let down...it was thin and soft...there was no resistance to the bite... my dining partner had the miso ramen http://www.yelp.com/userÉ and the cod roe with rice http://www.yelp.com/userÉ all this time, the best (so far) ramen has been in dallas at tei-an...who would have thought??

Came here on a recommendation from a couple of friends. ÊBut I was not prepared to wait for hours to eat at this place. ÊWho knew it was this popular...so I figured it must be really good. Ê We had a group of 6 and our estimated wait time was 4 hours. ÊARE YOU SERIOUS???? 4 hours!!!! WTH!! Since we were visiting NYC we figured we have to try this place out and so many people raved about it. ÊWe decided to break away with the group of 6 and pair up to reduce our wait time to 2 hours instead. Ê Ramen was okay slightly different taste then what I'm use to eating normally....but nothing that WOW me or anything. ÊThe best part was the pork bun that was delicious. Ê Our total for two bowls of ramen, an order of the pork bun and dessert was $60/including tip...that's one pricey meal for something I can get back home for about $20. I wouldn't mind going back, but this time to hangout at the bar and order some cocktails and the eat the porkbun.

I've tried pobably 90% of their entire menu. I would say the classics are the BEST. The charred broth is a good experience but I prefer the classics. The broth is made to perfection and the noodles have of inexplicable quality. Their noodles have the good bounce to that you only find in really authentic ramen shops. Its definitely worth the trip and the wait for everyone visiting the Big Apple.

When I look back at my first trip to Ippudo one word comes to mind: Ê "Zuzutto!" Ê I'm not a big ramen guy, but I eagerly made my first NY ramen run to Ippudo after salivating over ramen pictures and reading reviews from yelp and other other articles months before I moved to NY. The long and the short of it is that Ippudo rocks, one of the most memorable meals I've had in New York so far. ÊEven if you go for the ramen, the pork buns are also a must, perfectly marinated and super tender. ÊDelicious and memorable. Ê The Akamaru Modern, moreover, was pure bliss in a bowl, though the noodles were not the star of the show, but the broth. ÊIronically, I found it slightly annoying that the noodles were getting in the way of the broth. ÊI often hear soup/ramen joints talk about the slow and delicate process to make the broth. ÊThis one is believable, as apparent from the complex flavors impossible to sufficiently describe. ÊDelicious...soothing...every zuzutto made me smile. At any rate, I probably cant provide more insight than the nearly 3,000 reviews. ÊJust to reiterate, plan your trip accordingly and expect a long wait. ÊIt's well worth the trouble. ÊZuzutto!

There have always been those eating spots that are so big in NY that the news travels all the way to CA. When I was in high school, it was Dylan's Candy Bar. Then Momofuku after that. My most recent to-do obsession has been Ippudo. And I'm happy to say that after my last trip there I was not disappointed by the hype! It helped that I called ahead to see if they were open on Labor Day, then planned an early lunch date so that we could be there right when it opened. But even when we approached at 11am sharp, there was a line down the block! Luckily, they seem to have their system down and we were seated within 10 minutes or so, to the boisterous Japanese shouts of the staff. One day I need to learn what they're yelling! I went with the Akamaru Modern ramen, as I was enticed by its promise of "Ippudo's secret "Umami Dama" miso paste." The others at my table went with the Shiromaru Hakata Classic ramen, and none of us regretted our decisions. Being the glutton that I am, I was tempted to get an appetizer to share, but to be honest I'm glad I didn't - the ramen was more than enough and I was happy that I had an empty stomach for that huge bowl of broth and noodles! That special miso paste is as amazing as you'd imagine - a complex umami flavor that really adds to the dish. Of course, I had to get a soft boiled egg added to it as well, and it was perfectly soft boiled - I need to learn how to do that at home! The service was brisk but happy and friendly, and I was in love with the decor. It's really slick and designed inside so you can kind of tell that they're a chain and have had some practice at this whole restaurant thing, but it's still charming. I especially love the blocks of instant ramen noodles under the glass bar at the front of the space. So clever! The last time I read about Ippudo it was David Chang and some other famous chefs and foodies saying it was overrated compared to the hole in the wall ramen legends in Tokyo. They may be right, but I've never been to Tokyo and this is the closest I've come so far to ramen heaven!

I dont know what all the HYPE is about... Honestly when I heard about this so called AMAZING Ramen place in NYC my heart jumped because I LOVE LOVE LOVE Ramen or any type of noodle soups (ie PHO) and I will travel as far as I need to, to get that experience. Unfortunately...I was disappointed. NOT WORTH THE 2 HR WAIT + Pre-service: As mentioned 2 hr wait. They called us and said they were ready to seat us because a group was paying...then they had us wait 30 more mins...what a teaser! so in total 2 hrs and 30 min Service: EXCELLENT..our waitress was on point...she let us add an extra person last min even though we had a head count already and had seated, when usually they don't. Price: NOT worth the price for a small bowl of ramen or taste. Pork buns: BOMB, I would say BETTER than the ramen. YOU MUST HAVE THEM!! not just one but 1 orders! Karaka Miso Ramen: No bueno. Not up to par as to what I have experienced before. It wasn't as flavorful as I expected. It is supposed to spicy, but it was NOT SPICY at all. I just don't think the combo of flavors works with this type of ramen. IT actually tasted bland than I expected. Shiromaru Hakata Classic: I only had a taste of my friends, but this one is much better than the one I had (above). Noodles: Yes they are handmade, but I have had better handmade ramen noodles in California. They are thinner than normal and have a slightly different texture. its not crimped like normal ramen and I felt that it taste more grain like. Overall: Not worth the wait...I mean if you are visiting I guess its worth the try...but I wont be coming here anytime soon, unless a visitor comes to town. One thing for sure is that considering there is not ANY good ASIAN restaurants in Manhattan, I wil have to give it to them.

Okay, there was a bit of a mess coming into this place around 2:30 on Sunday. ÊI was foolishly hoping the brunch-loving crowd would steer clear of ramen. ÊI was wrong. ÊThe wait was at least an hour and a half, so we waltzed over to McSorley's because there's nothing better than drunken noodles! We called after 2 hours because we didn't hear anything and they said to come right back. ÊAnd this could've been my fault, but when we got back, we were told it would be a longer wait because the guy had us down for two instead of three. ÊFine. ÊMaybe 20 minutes later, we were seated, but I got a call from my partner saying he could possibly join. ÊWe asked the waiter if this is okay, and were promptly told we would have to go back out and wait even though we were at a 4 person table and had already waited over 2 hours. ÊI get the policy that everyone has to be there, and I honestly didn't think we had anyone else. ÊI also think a restaurant that doesn't want more money is silly, but that's on them. ÊStrangely even after saying we are fine to three different waiters, they send over the manager. ÊOnce again, not snippy, they are just wasting time that we could've ordered and gotten the table turned over. Ê Enough of that, on to the food. We got two apps: duck breast with tofu, mushrooms, poached eggs and noodles and the crab croquettes. ÊThe duck was good but I would skip the croquettes- they more creamy than crabby. ÊFor noodles, the Karaka with pork belly on top was really satisfying. ÊGood broth to noodle ratio and I can't imagine how anyone would take them up on the additional noodle deal. Ê I won't come back unless I'm a little smarter about getting there early and with the right amount of people.

My friends will probably yell at me for giving this only 4, and not 5, but you'll see why. A large group of us went here a few weeks ago, 8 of us. ÊI understand this place is extremely busy, not too big, and there is a really long wait, this has no bearing on the rating. ÊBut, what is good, they have a small bar area, so you can drink your face off while you are waiting. ÊWe ended up waiting close to two hours. Ê We were all starving by the time we sat down, we ordered numerous orders of pork buns. ÊI have heard and read about these, and it was not the hunger, not the prior alcohol, but these things were absolutely incredible! Ê2 pork buns come to an order, me and my gf ordered 2, so we both got to have 2, and let me tell u, it was worth it, i'd go back and order 10 orders of pork buns, these things were amazing. Ê For dinner, i was torn on which ramen to get, but I ended up getting the Akamaru Modern, with spicy chili paste, and a boiled egg. ÊWhen it came, wow, damn, it really is as good as everyone says. ÊThe portion is large as well. ÊThere is a lot of broth, and pending on your appetite, heres a little trick, when you're done, you can order more noodles for cheap, add it to your leftover broth, and essentially eat more, or have another meal. This place was reallly good. ÊYou might go, why only 4 then. ÊWell, unfortunately, shortly after walking out, 2 of my friends got sick, 1 of which was not drinking, so it was not the alcohol talking back. Ê Will I go back? ÊYes, easily. ÊIf you are a large party, be prepared to wait a long ass time.

I'll keep it simple: -Best ramen we've had on either the east or west coast -Go for lunch, you'll have a lot less of a wait -Don't expect a leisurely, drawn out meal-- your ramen arrives, perfectly al dente, approximately 3 minutes after you order it. I can't imagine anyone being disappointed here. ÊIts great.

After seeing thousands of reviews for a single restaurant, I set my expectation for this place sky-high and really want to know how good this place is compared to the godly Ichiran Ramen in Tokyo. I went there Monday 12.00 pm and didn't have to wait at all. Pork bun was excellent but ramen was very disappointed. I had their black-tonkatsu ramen and the first thing I noticed was how thin the chashu was. It was paper thin. A lot thinner than the pork that came with pork bun. The soup was generic so I didn't want to slurp it bottom up. The worst thing about this place is the price. Two bowls of noodles and 2 buns costed me almost $50. Not really worth it. I don't know if Ippundo is the best ramen in NYC but the quality is not even close to many generic ramen shops you can find in Japan.

Hirata buns - aka pork bun sliders, sooo good! OMG just thinking about them make me drool Akamaru ramen - very garlicky, but worth the garlic breath Ippudo NY Kasane Aji - special ramen with bamboo shoots. I don't know if they have this all the time, but it was worth the extra couple bucks Karaka Miso ramen - slightly spicy, but good broth. This one is my fave! A little pricey for ramen and there's always a long wait, but put your name on the list, walk around for an hour or so then come back. Oh and the drinks are great too.

My little brother considers himself an expert on all things ramen (and all things generally). I took him here for lunch to celebrate his 18th birthday and he had to admit it was pretty great. We got the Hirata pork buns which he said were like the "delicious bastard love child of a Bahn mi and Chinatown pork buns" he thought they had too much mayo (but we are both mayo haters...). He got the Shiromaru Hakata Classic Êand I got the Spicy Miso Ramen, we agreed that his was good...mine was better (i will take my victories where I can get them). Both were delicious. I explained to our waiter that it was his birthday and that I want as big and embarrassing a spectacle as possible with our desert (Lady Cake). They did not disappoint! The cake came with a candle and a caravan of singing waiters, many of our fellow diners joined in... he was thoroughly humiliated but left full and happy. MISSION ACCOMPLISHED

After reviewing a ramen establishment on the west coast, Daikokuya, I had to give the east coast icon, Ippudo a fair shake. ÊI have been to Ippudo on several occasions, and I must say while it is very quality ramen, it is not my favorite spot, and does have a few dim spots. The biggest knock on Ippudo is the wait. ÊThat might go down as I hear there's a second location, but seriously, it is impossible to get a seat for a decent wait time during peak hours. ÊThe best strategy is to go right before it opens for dinner (like around 4:45pm or so) and wait there to be the first ones in. The pork buns are good, but they are not as good as Momofuku's pork buns, which are nearby. ÊThat being said, they are definitely worth getting while waiting for your ramen to come by. ÊThe Akamaru Modern is the standard dish that I get, and getting extra toppings such as egg and pork are great options. ÊHowever, the broth isn't as good as other places I've tried, but all in all it's a very quality ramen and tasty. When going to NYC however, it's a decent spot for its ambiance (though sometimes the fake Japanese yelling does get annoying after a while), and you should definitely check it off one of many places to go when doing a ramen tour in NYC. ÊPlan accordingly, if there is a long wait, you could always chill at the Astor Place Starbucks nearby.

Finally had the opportunity to try the famous ippudo! Ok.. First.. The wait. The restaurant quoted us a 1.5 hours wait (yikes!!). However, they took my number and explained they would text us to come back when our table would be ready. With that time on or hand, my girlfriend and I strolled through soho and enjoyed some window shopping. Before we knew it, we were texted to come back ( in about 55 minutes) .. Not to bad. Now on to the food. We started with the pork buns. Quite frankly, these are the best buns I have had... And I'm Asian! The bun was light and fluffy and held a deeply flavored complex pork that melted in my mouth. The short rib appetizer did have a similar profile to the pork and was fork tender. However, i would only recommend this dish for those who are not afraid of eating some fat. Finally, on to the ramen. We shared the akamaru ramen with Ippduo's special sauce, pork belly, cabbage, scallions, miso paste, kikurageand, and garlic oil. It's was simple yet delicious and just the way to finish off a great dinner (note: if you are a meat person, add extra because it only comes with two slices). I'd definately come back to Ippudo with the great energy and fantastic food they offer... But it is not an every day affair as you can find alternative ramen solutions with a smaller hit to your pocket. That said... I'm still dreaming about the pork buns.... I have yet to find better. Yum yum!

I feel obligated to keep the Yelp hype going -- this place is awesome! On a Wednesday night, we waited about 30 minutes to be seated -- but we didn't care because it was 2-for-1 beers at the bar. The food was ridiculous. We started with the pork buns -- totally worth the money, do not leave Ippudo without eating a pork bun! I got the Kogashi Miso Ramen, and I thought I'd died and gone to heaven -- black charred miso, pork, cabbage. I have to go back ASAP, as this special ramen is on the menu for a limited time. The staff was great -- everyone seems happy, upbeat and totally psyched about the food. Even with the long lines, we didn't feel rushed, which I always appreciate. I highly recommend sitting at the bar to see the chefs do their thing -- very cool.

I stayed away from Ippudo for a while but went again this weekend because a friend of mine visited me and she and some people wanted to go. So I thought, fine, I'll give it a third try especially since they did most of the waiting while I was still at work. The wait time for 9 people on an early Sunday evening was one hour, which is shorter than my past experiences. Between three people we shared the tako wasabi, a special tofu dish with crab, pork buns, and two akamaru modern ramens (one with kakuni, or pork belly, and the other with an egg). The tako wasa was good, not better or worse than others I have had. The pork buns were also delicious as I remembered, although this time it was a little too mayo-heavy. The tofu dish was scrumptious and my favorite of the night. It tasted refreshing and I loved the crab-flavor jelly that covered the tofu. The ramen was very flavorful, and I still thought it was too heavy. It didn't taste bad, but it's still not my favorite or preferred ramen in New York. I enjoyed the pork belly though. The noodle's texture was cooked well to the line between firm and soft, though my personal preference is for softer noodles. Overall, I still don't think it's worth the hype. I like other ramen places more, and if the wait here was less than 40 minutes I'd like to come repeatedly for the appetizers. My friend's thought was that she was glad to have tried it, but the ramen was expensive and she wouldn't come here again because it was good but not that great.

I went there with some friends around 2pm on a weekday and was told it was an hour wait. Since there were a lot of cafes and bars in the area, we gave them our number and had ice coolers while waiting. They called us 30 minutes later, and 15 minutes after that, we were seated in a big booth. Let's start with the food. We only had ramen. We didn't even look at the other dishes they have there. We had the classic ramen, which was amazing. None of us talked. We just sat there, sipping, eating. After that disappointing visit to Momofuku a few nights before, it was so refreshing to be ingesting wonderful ramen with lots of flavor. But even better, the servers were hot! Seriously. And they were so pleasant to talk to. I would go back for the servers ;) and the ramen, of course. I'd definitely suggest going when they've just opened or about to close. Otherwise, it'll definitely be around an hour and a half wait. But heck, if you don't mind the wait.

Being a HUGE ramen lover, I figured it was only a matter of time until I tried Ippudo which is supposed to be the ramen of all ramens. My friend and I got there and the wait was an hour and a half! Figured that its always going to be like this, so we stuck it out. Definitely recommend going to the central bar around the corner on 9th st. Had a great bartender there that was super friendly and its a good place to kill some time. After staying at the bar for a little over an hour, we went back over to Ippudo. We still had to wait about another 15 minutes, but it was fine. The place gets waaaaay crowded so you kind of have to shimmy through everyone. We sat at this huge table with burnt wood in the middle. Loved the environment in there. Waiteres screaming Japanese things every second. It's a cute, trendy spot with an awesome wait staff. We had this awesome guy from Japan who gave us recommendations and everything. My friend and i shared the pork buns for appetizer. DELICIOUS! Our waiter said its the most popular and after trying it we knew why. Steamed buns, fatty pork, mayo, and lettuce .. perfection. After debating through the list of ramen, we both decided on the Kogashi Miso Ramen (one of their special ramens). YUM. Never had charred miso soup before but it has sooo much flavor and I basically inhaled all of the soup when i got the bowl. The soup is a little heavier compared to normal miso soup, but still tasted awesome. There were also a ton of bamboo shoots in the ramen. I'm usually not a fan of bamboo, but because they soaked up the flavor of the soup, I devoured every last bite. Usually at these trendy kind of restaurants, I expect small portions, but they had decent sized portions. Recommending this place! The wait just kind of sucks, but you have to come here at least once ato try the ramen, its one of the best i've ever had.

ok. so i used to be obsessed with ippudo, and then they changed their noodles to a thinner, smushier variety, which really broke my heart. i also felt that in general the food wasn't very consistent anymore, and it wasn't quite worth the wait (ugh to the notoriously unreliable time estimates the hostesses give you - 45 minutes means something closer to 80). i hadn't been back to ippudo in over a year, but i had family in town recently who wanted to try ippudo, and family always wins. AND I'M SO GLAD I WENT BACK AND GAVE IT ANOTHER TRY. because the noodles are SO much better (comparable to totto ramen or jin ramen) - an almost somen-like noodle that holds its texture beautifully. every bite was a delight. i asked around, and a little birdie told me that ippudo recently changed the flour for their noodles, and my mouth and belly heartily applaud their decision. the pork buns were, as always, delicious. this was the ippudo i fell in love with, let's never break up again.

Ippudo is an awesome NYC eatery. My friend suggested this place as my first meal in NYC. Ambiance is modern and chic, although a bit loud. ÊEven on a weekday lunch, there was a little bit of a wait, which can probably be attributed to the immense popularity. Since I wasn't too hungry, my friend and I shared the Shiromaru Hakata Classic ramen. We ordered the set which came with a salad and grilled eel over rice ($17). We also ordered the Hirata Buns($9). Hirata Buns are delicious! The buns were sooooo soft and the meat was tender and went well with the sauce which wasn't too spicy. The eel over rice was too was awesome. The rice in particular won me over because it was so soft and cooked just right. The eel was good too and wasn't overly sauced. The ramen was nice and piping hot when it came out. The broth was a bit too salty. But the noodles were cooked well. Service was really quick and efficient. Overall, this place was pretty dope!

Ippudo is good, but not amazing. I came here once with friends and it was a good time. The atmosphere is good and service was great (the guy learned my name). Unfortunately, the food just wasn't worth the wait/cost. The noodles were tasty and served in nice bowls but I just remember sitting there going "Why am I paying so much for this when I could buy it for 10 cents?" I feel that this place is over rated for what it is. I would recommend this place for a special occasion where you're willing to wait and put some money down for the atmosphere.

- The wait is a long time, but thank goodness it is located near DSW Shoe Warehouse, so a grrl can do some shoeshoppinz while waiting for her table. +Ramen is duhlish. ÊYeah, yeah akaru modern. Yeah add you-self an egg. ÊYeah carb-overload it up and get you that second helpin' o' those noodles! Ê +YEAH big guy slurping up every drop of that salty soup into your wide, gaping mouth. ÊYou da man! ~ Pork buns are s'ok. ÊMayonnaise and lettuce leaves and pork belly stuffed in a soft bun. ÊAll s'ok! I like Ippudo. ÊI like it too much. ÊI ate it three times in one week, and then I couldn't eat it anymore for months. ÊSomething like tasty overload. ÊOr MSG. ÊI know your tricks, you wily Japanese!

I have been to Ippudo a few times in the last two years. Ippudo is a very pricey ramen spot. However, it does look nice inside and the decor is good. Inside the waiting area, you get to see all different kinds of bowls on the wall with different art on the bowls. They're pretty. If you go to the bathroom downstairs, you can see the chefs making ramen. Also, if you come as a small group, like two people, you'll most likely have to share and sit at the large table where they seat two people around the large table at a time. I know most people don't like to share tables. The ramen was very good with the fatty pork (charsiu), but it is too much just for a bowl of ramen even though they do make it fresh from scratch on location. The pork buns were pretty good too! Nice and juicy! Beware that you should show up to the restaurant before it opens at 5PM to get seats quickly. Otherwise, you will be standing on the long line just to get seats. It is a long wait for seats as they do not take reservations. It's a once in a lifetime kind of spot. I wouldn't go here too often.

Pretty tasty, but butt ef expensive for ramen. Pretty legit good though, noodles are really doughy, saw them rolling it out fresh. The broth is perfectly balanced and tasty, a tiny bit on the lighter side. Good, but c,mon it's ramen, I'd rate them a 4 if it wasn't so pricey

I must be missing something while eating my ramen, where was the "WoW" factor? I'm no expert in ramen but I do consider myself a enthusiast in eating them in the past. We arrived there as they opened only because from everyone who told me how great it was and the wait for a seating was over an hour long. We got seated almost immediately and started ordering appetizers and to our surprise they were really yummy. The pork hirata buns which came in pairs were very juicy and tasted like any buns you get in any Asian bakery. We ordered two different Êramen's just to get two different flavors, which were the: Akamaru Modern (The original "Tonkotsu" noodle soup topped with Ippudo's secret "Umami Dama" miso paste, pork chashu, cabage, kikurage, scallions, and fragrant garlic oil) & Miso Ramen (Soybean paste and pork noodle soup topped with pork chashu, cabbage, kaiware radish, menma, fresh grated ginger, and scallions) - Both tasted extremely different and had a hard time finishing them both, the table next to us was praising the ramen and drank the entire broth. I looked at him and could not figure out how or why he did that. At the end of the meal, we asked for the bill and walked out of there for $65 and just have to say to ourselves not to believe in the hype and this is not the best ramen I have every eaten but the worst.

A place that can hold a 3+ hour wait and sell 15.00 bowl of ramen is really something else. And it didn't even include the egg!! Ack, that is the quintessential topping of ramen. If you're a ramen aficionado, noodles at this price is not putting out. If eating ramen is an occasion, do it.

Food: ÊThis place has the best ramen I've ever eaten hands-down. ÊDelicious. ÊThe ramen was so good... the pork that was inside melted in my mouth and the broth was creamy from the miso soup-paste that was in there. ÊSo good. ÊJust incredibly tasty. Ê Price: ÊThe price is steep for noodles at $15ish for the base dish plus $5ish for add-ons. Ê$20 for ramen is pretty steep, but oh man do you get your money's worth in flavor. ÊAlso, the food was pretty filling unlike a lot of fine dining establishments where they give you a 0.001 inch-thick slice of air bread avec fouton blanc or somethin and you need to eat like 15 hamburgers just to sleep that night. Reservations: ÊMy only complaint with the place is that they don't take reservations so you need to put your name down in advance (likely 1 - 2 hours before you actually start eating). ÊIt's not bad once you get used to doing it. Ê Decor: ÊSuper swanky. ÊEvery single person that I saw there was good looking and well-dressed and there were like crazy black and white mosaic-style Japanese art pieces on the wall as well as calligraphy. ÊPretty cazy stuff. Go here. ÊYou will enjoy yourself. Ê:D

Been here a couple of times and they never seem to disappoint me. The noodles and broth are just sooo yummmy. the noodles are freshly made. i never knew that until i went downstairs to use the restroom and passed by this small room where this guy is just making noodles. And you can't forget the pork belly sandwich....kinda drooling about it right now haha. Also had the crispy shrimp with spicy mayo as an appetizer. It also has these crispy noodle pieces that reminded me of the asian snacks i had as a kid. really good! as for the wait....i've waited over 2 hours twice and the other times i waited only 10 minutes. Of course you will have to wait 2+ hours at night but the afternoon has a pretty decent waiting time. the best waiting time i had EVER was during cinco de mayo at night.....waited only 30 mins for some reason....probably because everyone was out getting their drunk on haha

Ippudo has quickly distinguished itself from other ramen joints in the city and seems to stand a solid notch above the rest - judging by its out-the-door lines and the crazed fervor with which its devotees gush about the perfect springiness of its hand-pulled noodles, sublime porkiness of its broth, and Momofuku-rivaling pork buns. Here's the lowdown: by now you have hopefully deduced that that you will not find the likes of cup o' noodle or Maruchan instant noodles here. ÊYou will find traditional Japanese items, such as miso and soy sauce ramen, agedashi, tonkatsu, and ochazuke...as well as more playful and trendy items like glazed chicken wings and the aforementioned pork buns. Ippudo does fatty pork very well, and the sticky unctuousness of it all leaves you simultaneously regretful and craving more. ÊThe pork adds an otherworldly dimension to the stock used in the ramen soup. ÊTry some of the traditional additions to cut the rich flavor and give just the right touch of sour or crunchy bite - the karashi takana (pickled mustard greens) or menma (seasoned bamboo shoots) will do the trick! Ê You can't go wrong with the akamaru modern or shiromaru hakata classic ramens. One word to the wise - and the reason for the docking of 1 star from this review: Êany trip to Ippudo will leave your body craving water like a thirsty hound dog trapped in the desert. ÊHydration is key to a happy post-Ippudo experience.

I would give this place five stars for their pork buns alone! If food could be so good that it brings tears to your eyes, this would be it. ÊThe bun is warm and soft, the meat is so incredibly tender, no words to even describe the flavor but it bursts and melt in your mouth at every bite and I died a little when it was all gone. ÊThis is not an over exaggeration, your life will never be the same again once you taste this. ÊA New York staple for sure! I tried the akamaru ramen! It was around $15 dollars for a very large and generous portion. ÊThe price is pretty steep for noodles but it was delicious! ÊI wouldn't say it's the best I've ever had, but it would surely be top five. ÊThe broth was very flavorful, a little bit on the salty side but partner it with a beer and it'll taste like rainbows. Ê The myriad Of scallions, cabbage, corn, etc. complimented each other well and I was left stuffed and satisfied. Service was absolutely amazing, forgot our server's name but he was the only one wearing a bandana as a headband if that helps you spot him out. Sweetest kid that catered to our every (touristy) needs and made impeccable recommendations. ÊI hear it gets very busy and the wait can get lengthy so don't come with an empty stomach! We got lucky and got seated within 15 minutes even though we had 7 people!

If you're ever in New York, you need to make a stop at 65 Fourth Avenue (between 9th and 10th Street). ÊIppudo NY has the best ramen ever. ÊThis should go on your bucket list. Ê "Irashimase." ÊWhen I stepped into the restaurant, we were greeted with smiles. ÊThe first thing I noticed was their wall of beautifully lined up ramen bowls. ÊThen I saw their bar counter was a glass case of dried ramen noodles (like the individual packaged ramen size). ÊThere were art all over the restaurant and the interior design was amazing. ÊThe decor turned this regular ramen joint into a fine dining ramen restaurant. ÊWe were lucky that day, we didn't have to wait in line. ÊAccording to their website, Ippudo NY does not take reservations or allow customers to take out. ÊHope you all will be as lucky as we were with the line. I love noodles and I'm in love with Ippudo. ÊThe noodles are thin and soft. ÊJust the perfect texture of slurp-ilicious goodness. ÊI ordered the classic Shiromaru Hakata ramen which is topped with pork loin chashu, kikurage, menma, red pickeled ginger, sesame, and scallions and I added a Nitamago on the side. ÊNitamago is a seasoned soft boiled egg. ÊIt was just the right addition to my big bowl of ramen. Ê The pork based broth was flavorable and unforgettable. ÊI could see the bottom of my bowl, all the broth and ramen was bye-bye. ÊIt was just chopstick licking good. ÊIt was my best New York food experience. ÊOishi!

I hate lines. Yes, I hate lines. I almost hated this place because I almost got denied twice. Once they stopped accepting people and the second time they told us we had to wait 1.5 hours but it was only really 30 minutes. Gist - expect a wait. But it was worth it! Yes, the classic and modern ramen were super delish, tasty, hot, deep with flavor. If you have to wait at the bar (don't whine, we all had to do it), drown your sorrows in some warm pork buns (some of the best I've ever tasted). If you're from Los Angeles and you live and die by Santouka's chasu/salt ramen then you'll be happy here. Your belly will thank you.

Very good ramen restaurant. Not only was the ramen tasty but the starters were very good too. Shishito - excellent, but very pricey for shishito Stuffed chicken wings - the accompanying sauce made this excellent Black charred miso ramen - very good, robust, spicy, noodles firm but delicate Umami miso ramen - very good, comforting, soothing Service is efficient and friendly. Atmosphere is lively. Drawbacks include wait time and the hefty prices. Were it not for those factors, this would have been 5 stars.

This is a long overdo review. We went to Ippudo about a month ago. 1. The noodles are hand made in house and are perfectly textured ramen (egg noodles). 2. The meats are flavorful and prepared well but nothing special. 3. The broth... OMG, the broth. Writing this review makes me want to travel downtown and add my name to the hour long wait (min.). I ordered the ramen with the Umami paste with garlic essence and it was so good that I daydreamed about it for weeks. The Chasu pork slices (not well seasoned but good) were perfect compliments to the salty rich pork broth that it came with. My husband ordered the veggy wasabi ramen and was pleasantly surprised. The wasabi smelled so over powering that I had to dare him to take the first bite. He was glad he did since the wasabi was at best mild in his noodle broth. He thought the ramen (different style than mine) was cooked perfectly and everything combined was delicious. I have been hesitant to come back because of the wait but I WILL be coming back. I would give it a five star rating but the waiting list and the staff at the front of the house were at best tolerable. The staff, after seating, was great.

When you first enter the restaurant, you're greeted with a cheery staff. The restaurant has a good ambiance for dates and groups. The wait staff are friendly and fast. I recommend coming in early Êbecause a line starts forming before it opens up again at 5pm for dinner. If you come any later than that, you'll be standing outside in the cold for awhile. It's a pretty popular place. The ramen was good and comes in a big portion. I had to force myself to finish the rest. I absolutely LOVED the Hirata Buns! I could eat those all night.

*I'm sorry this is SOO LONG guys* It's hard to give this a solid rating because after the wait we were all so tired and hungry that we were there less than 30minutes. I think it could have been a significantly more enjoyable experience if we were more strategic about it. 2 hour wait for 3 people on a Wednesday night! Strategy: have at least one friend come early and put your name in, then explore all that the st.marks area has to offer :) It's kind of hard on a weeknight because most people don't get off til 6-7 and by the time you get here it could easily be 7-8p which means your not even getting seated to eat til 9-10p which can be pretty late to start eating for most people. If you have one friend that gets off earlier and can be there by 6 and doesn't mind stopping in to put your name in, then you are golden and should be seated around 8 :) Ê Very nice inside, but kind of noisy and open kitchen so you can see the chefs at work. All the servers were hipstered out with tats and the whole bit. They do some table sharing, but your spaced out not crammed next to strangers. Ê Not the best place ever for a vegetarian.. though I didn't get to ask detailed questions about the appetizers because it was already past 10p and we went straight for the entrees. Even though there wasn't a huge selection of vegetarian options, at least they have some, and by the quality of this spot and confidence in the servers' voices you can trust that they are ACTUALLY vegetarian. The majority of the tofu ones on the menu some kind of pork or broth involved. I think there might have been 1-2 vegetarian friendly appetizer choices and two "specialties" (which seem like they are too small to be an entree unless you are getting appetizers and dessert). There was only one vegetarian ramen.. It's the "Wasabi Shoyu Ramen" which was kind of deceptive to me because I expected it to be at least a little spicy and have some wasabi flavor with that being the first word in the name.. but unfortunately it had ZERO spice (heat) and wasn't strongly wasabi tasting. It was very hot temperature wise as it came immediately the whole three steps from the kitchen. I love that.. I love HOT foods. I also love spicy foods so I was kind of bummed.. in retrospect I should of requested sriracha or chili oil or extra wasabi! The bean curd in my ramen was extremely sweet, really if taken out and paired with ice cream it could have been a dessert! I didn't mind it at all but wished that they had cut it up more or at least given me something to break it apart with. Same deal with the nori, it was really good, but in one huge piece when I would've preferred to have the flavor in more than one giant overwhelming bite. My friends shared the Pork Buns, they both have extensive experience with these and unusually high standards, but they enjoyed these. Not the best they've ever had but definitely top 5. They definitely preferred them significantly more than momofuku's. One of my friends got the Shiromaru Hakata Classic, the first ramen menu item, I believe he got the braised beef on top as well. He said it was one of the better ramens hes had but he was a little disappointed that the braised meat was tougher than he thought it was supposed to be. He had the same issue with huge chunks of meat and would've preferred more even distribution of ingredients like I wanted in mine as well. My other friend, who happens to be the pickiest by far, had the Karaka Miso Ramen and enjoyed his the most. The meat in his was much more finely chopped. Also, when he order the server (the only actual Japanese one in the whole restaurant that night) said that this was his favorite ramen there as well. Next time I will definitely be taking advantage of "Kae-dama, a system that offers you an extra serving of noodles for $2 extra. ÊWhen you have almost finished your first serving of noodles, order by saying, "Kae-dama, please". ÊIn a few minutes the server will bring you another 'ball of noodles.' ÊThis time I was too full from our snacking exploits around St. Marks during our 2 hour wait. Man.. am I bummed I didn't see the dessert menu! Everything looks AMAZING!! I'm coming back just for dessert! The best sounding desserts: Mascarpone Cheese and Ice Cream Ê Ê$8 Matcha Brulee Ê Ê$8 Green tea flavored creme brulee topped with gelato Ê Annin Sorbet Ê Ê$7 Sweet tofu custard topped with your choice sorbet (Blood Orange or Pear flavors) excited for my dessert update :)

This is a tough place to review because they are always so busy and there is always a long wait. ÊThey could double the restaurants size and still have a formidable wait for a table. But once seated the food is just ridiculously good ! Appetizers-haven't found one on the menu that isn't amazing, the pork buns and Êfried oysters to the front. Noodles are all extremely flavorful (only once a little salty) and they offer poached egg and braised pork belly as a side to Êaccompany the noodles. (flavor bombs!!!)

It's right around the corner from my home. But I've managed to eat here only once, because this place is too damn (1) popular and (2) expensive. I only had the ramen once, at 10:30 PM after I came back from work, when they happened to have one seat available at a communal table. Yes, Êat10:30 PM on a Wednesday night, this place was packed, with multiple groups waiting. I think they should give priority to people from the neighborhood. Heck, Webster Hall lets us get in for free because we live within a few blocks. Rantings aside, the ramen is superb. For that, Ippudo beats Momofuku and M's uptown, cheaper competitor Naruto hands down. But at $18 a pop, I would come here at most a couple of times a year. There's a lot cheaper and decent place on 2nd Ave.

ÊSo come at least an hour before you actually want to eat so you dont get HANGRY waiting. Food: We got the Hirata Buns with pork and they were pretty good. ÊNot amazing, but decent. ÊThen I got the Modern Ramen and added Nitamago Ê(Seasoned salt boiled egg). ÊThe Ramen was pretty bland if you ask me. ÊI had to ask for some hot sauce to spice it up a bit.

Service: Amazing service and they were very good at refilling the waters and checking in frequently. Ambiance: Loud, crazy and fun! ÊThey group people together at big tables so you end up making friends. Overall: Go if you dont have to wait 2 hours, but honestly I dont understand why this place has 3,000+ reviews and 4 stars.

I considered giving Ippudo 5 stars but I rarely (if never) give 5 stars unless the establishment had me on my knees with culinary satisfaction. Considering there was a 1.5 hour wait at opening, AND they don't take reservations, I have to take away a star. My friend and I started with the famous Hirata Buns with pork - delicious! The pork had great umami tastes with the rich soy sauce. The buns was steamed to a soft perfection. I followed with a bowl of ramen with fresh noodles and piping hot broth. I can't say the broth is the best I've ever had but it wasn't greasy and was very refreshing. The noodles were probably the star of the dish (and the pork belly!). For dessert, my friend and I share the matcha creme brulee - a beautiful concept but not delivered as well as I'd hoped with Ippudo. It had the typcially amazing attributes of a creme brulee - cream filling, sweet deliciousness, and a nice burnt sugar crust on top. What was missing was the matcha flavor - if the dish weren't green, I would've forgotten it was matcha. This is genuinely a great place to eat if you're a ramen fan but beware of the wait!

Wasn't really wowed by their ramen--the broths were salty or just not something i found all that great. The pork buns, though far from traditional...was quite good and would probably go back just for those they have a ever so slight kick vaguely similar to korean spicy pork, and the sauce which i guess was kind of like an aioli almost was a big hit with some of the people on the table.

Soft steamed buns, crispy lettuce, thinly sliced chashu (+ some spicyness) = YUM Fresh thin noodles, delicious hakata broth, melt in your mouth chashu = DOUBLE YUM If you go to NY, please go here. We went on the hottest day of the summer and it was still delicious. I can't imagine going there and being disappointed. We got the pork buns to start and ramen all around. It reminded me a little of Japan, minus the fresh garlic on the table. Cool decor too inside. Only downside is there's usually a wait, but lunchtime is a lot better I hear wait-wise.

4.5 stars. Best ramen of my life, hands down. Very fun and exciting place to dine. I love how all of the waitstaff yell Japanese greetings as you're on your way to be seated. I really liked that festive flair. Hirati Pork Buns: Buns were perfect: super soft, doughy, and slightly sweet. Pork belly was delicious and very flavorful. Topped with mayo, sriracha, and napa cabbage. This was good, but not amazing, I'm not sure if I'd get it again. Akamaru Modern Ramen (The original silky "Tonkotsu" (pork) soup noodles topped with Ippudo's secret "Umami Dama" miso paste, pork chashu, cabage, sesame kikurage mushrooms, scallions, and fragrant garlic oil): OH. MY. GOD. The broth is INCREDIBLE, like nothing I have ever tasted. I tasted a bit of umami mushroom flavor, miso, definitely some kind of garlic (but not raw), and other deliciousness...everything complemented each other so well that I couldn't quite pinpoint the flavors. All I know is that it was amazing, clearly well-conceptualized and executed, and unlike anything I have ever tasted before. Noodles were perfect: al dente, not mushy at all. One minor complaint: the two pieces of pork belly were sliced thinly and tasted bland. The waiter recommended this dish to me, even after I eyed the kasane black tonkotsu. He insisted that the Akamaru was the best ramen they had. So glad I went with his recommendation! Green Tea Matcha Creme Brulee: Texture of the creme brulee was more like matcha whipped cream rather than that of a thick custard. The dessert wasn't terrible, but I wouldn't get it again, I just can't say no to anything matcha. I won't hold this against them bc obviously people don't come here to eat creme brulee, haha. The people-watching here is awesome. I saw a group of cute and well-dressed investment bankers talking about their stock portfolios, a group of Paris Hilton-lookalikes, solo diners, couples (middle-aged and young) on dates, in addition to groups of teenagers that looked like they were pre-gaming before Prom. I loved seeing people from all different walks of life come here for the sole purpose of eating delicious ramen. I don't think I've ever been as impressed by the diversity of a restaurant's diners as I was at Ippudo. Service is friendly, decor is modern and trendy with Japanese flair, noise level is pretty loud. I will DEFINITELY be back!

I was so ecstatic to find out that I was within walking distance to Ippudo after seeing Esperanza Spalding at Webster Hall. I had been yearning for authentic hakata ramen since DC doesn't have a whole lot of ramen selections. Growing up in LA, I was no stranger to Shin sen gumi and Ajisen ramen. Well Ippudo was the perfect spot for a rainy Saturday night. Loved the age dashi tofu - broth was not too salty with a pinch of sweetness to it. I had the classic hakata ramen and one slurp took me back home to LA. Nostalgic indeed. Service was great as well so I will say that it did live up to its hype, for me at least.

Spicy miso amazing (no MSG after taste!) The regular miso good. Its a decent size bowl. it has a lot of fillings. The pork bun/taco was goooood! The crab croquettes were a little too creamy for me, but it was still good. The fried tofu? it was good. The blacken soup?? it was one of the specials. light plum wine good! Free green tea at the end. Ramen shouldnt cost 15-16 bucks, its basically NOODLES with added flavor and season.But i must say the best i've had so far!!!! Cons: The ridiculous wait!!! last time 3 hours. Second time half an hour so its doable.

Ippudo is like that decent looking girl that has a pretty great personality. ÊYou're like kinda interested but she's making you wait because she's not sure... so you're like, girl, you're just not worth the damn wait. The primary reason you go to Ippudo is the ramen. ÊBut honestly, the ramen is whatevers man. ÊThe broth isn't smooth, the pork isn't juicy, the noodles are ok. ÊIt's one of those things, that's solid on a cold day. ÊIt's that, ehhhh sure feeling. ÊLet's do it. Here's the problem with that. ÊIt's trendy and cute, great place to take a date. ÊYou know what that means? ÊLike all things trendy in New York City, you're gonna get a beast like wait. ÊAn hour minimum folks. ÊIs mediocre ramen really worth it? But remember how I said this girl has a great personality? ÊWell she does. ÊIt might not be the main reason you go to Ippudo, but their appetizer, the FREAKIN PORK BUNS, holy crap. ÊThey're ridiculously good. ÊIf I could just buy a million of those, I would just bath in it like Scrooge McDuck does with his money. ÊThat's how good these pork buns are man. ÊIt's just a perfect blend of fat and lean meat. ÊOh geez. ÊI'm drooling as I type this up. ÊIt's as if an angel sliced that perfect piece of pork, sauteed it in a zesty and mildly spicy sauce, put a playful leaf of lettuce on top of it, and wrapped it in a cloud. ÊWonderful..... So if this girl is wishy washy, making you wait, move on. ÊIt's not worth it man. ÊPlenty of other fish in the city. ÊLike the Hot Girl on 52nd.... Totto.....

Supposedly this place is the King of Ramen. Also supposedly the wait is 2-3 hours long. For the first part, since I am no Ramen affeciando, I can only say the Ramen was pretty good. For the second part, I can only concur the wait is stupidly long. Good news is you can leave your number and they will call you when it gets close... We got the: 1. Traditional 2. Modern The traditional honestly taste like any ramen I've had. The Modern was good. Two hours wait good? No... We added pork belly. Very good. Almost worth waiting... Had the pork belly buns. Very good, ok this place isn't bad at all. Overall the food was definitely delicious. I wasn't super impressed with the traditional but everything else was amazing. I doubt you can leave here hungry as you can keep adding ramen for $2. Food was expensive though at about $15-20 a plate depending on add ons.

Ippudo...ok - it's alright - but the price you pay for what you get - it's too expensive for Ramen. ÊI've been to a bunch of Ramen places all over the place - what you are paying for is ambiance...i guess. I'm ok with waiting in line - that's fine with me the interior of the restaurant is really chic looking with some bright lights across the walls and dim lights over the tables. ÊThe seats were interesting as they were chairs that when put together could kinda double as a makeshift loveseat. After waiting for what seems like days - you enter the restaurant and as you do everyone shouts in japanese something. ÊAnd they shout it loud. Ê(We'll touch upon this again later) - so you walk in and they shout and you sit down and the waitress brings you water and your menus and then disappears for a little while. Every ramen dish starts at $15 and goes up b/c of toppings and what not. ÊIt came out - piping hot, and tasty. ÊI had an extra order of Chashu meat in the hope it would be a huge portion, but it wasn't...it was only a little bit more. Ok so you are eating dinner trying to converse with the person next to or across from you and all the waiters and cooks and everyone shout in japanese to greet the next customers. ÊSo it's a ramen house - turnover is relatively quick - so think of that every 15-25 seconds. ÊIt kinda gets annoying and redundant. Ê Overall : Food was pretty good, very expensive for what you get. ÊI felt like i could make a bowl that they served up. ÊWould i come back? ÊProbably not.

My first time...I finally made it here! I hear its like the BEST place to get ramen...however, I have a few gripes about the place. Regardless, quality of food what quite awesome...but this is a whole package review. My friend Rich and I went to the restaurant right after work...we got there somewhere between 545-6p. The wait for two people was between 15-20 min. Awesome enough, we got seats afer 5-10 minutes. It was great. The place has a great (totally worth checking out) atmosphere. It's definitely something to experience. I was told I was to try the Classic or the Modern. I've actually yet to do this as the special actually caught my eye: Wasabi Tonkotsu Ramen - their famous Tonkotsu noodle soup infused with wasabi, topped with pork loin chashu, fresh choppedd wasabi, menma, naruto, sesame, and scallions **It was awesome! (and also $15) I was going to order pork buns (which I was also told to try) $9 for 2, to go, but they don't do take out. They don't even have the containers (thus, a LOT disappointment). Also means nothing for the boyfriend to try. The other thing I got was their sake in a can ($10), which you can get at the bar while you wait. It's delicious. If you're in to sake, the sweeter variety, you should definitely give this a shot. The place is awesome, though they get crazy crowded very fast, have no take out at all and are over-priced. I'd say definitely give it a shot and form your own opinion. The food's GREAT (Tony the Tiger style). However, I'm not sure that I'd need to return (as long as I'm making my measily salary) if I can find a better place for a better value.

I'd give 4 stars for the food, and 2 stars for the wait. Their popularity has gotten to their heads. ÊLast week, we were given 2 hour wait estimate... After 40 minutes, AFTER we decided to leave (being told that it's another 90+ minutes) and ordered food elsewhere, they then call us and tell us that our table is ready. Last night, the wait estimate (we lined up outside the door at 5pm for opening), didn't get to put down our names until 5:30. ÊThe 90 minute estimate turned out to be closer to 2 hours. The food is good, but that's because the quality of ramen in this city/country is seriously lacking. ÊThey have great-tasting appetizers (somewhat overpriced for the amount of food you get), and the selection of ramen is pretty good. ÊGet the Akamaru Modern ramen if you like the heavier type of broth. ÊGet the ginger-based one (forgot the name) or the clear chicken one (also forgot the name) if you're in the mood for lighter broth. ÊThe extra noodles for $2 is money well spent, especially if you're hungry.

I love its ramen broth which was so rich in flavor and showed that they had cooked it for long time. However, its noodle was not as good as I expected. I felt the noodle was not made by them and did not fit the ramen broth. I had karaka men added menma which was spicy yet tasty. I loved their soup base which was very very tasty at first but I was not a fan of their ramen noodle. Toward the end of the bowel, I felt the soup was salty and very greasy. I wish the broth could be rich in flavor yet light on the oil. My other friend had Shiromaru Hakata Classic and I also liked their broth. However, my friend also felt the soup was salty toward the end. Overall, I still will recommend people to go and try this place. It is a decent Japanese ramen noodle place. The wait could be long so try to plan this meal with about 1 hour or longer wait time.

OK OK , everyone, don't get angry. I liked Ippudo, but didn't think it was that exciting. The depth of flavor of the salad dressing on the salad portion of the lunch set, was more interesting than my Wasabi Shoyu Ramen, which is disappointing to say the least. The Ramen dish arrived with one of each of the tasty bits promised on the menu, but noodles themselves were plentiful and pretty good. I've had better noodles though at Hung Ry, Tasty Hand-Pulled Noodles, or Terakawa. I didn't really taste any wasabi, so I added some of my friend's spicy paste. I needed a kick... The bean curd was particularly disappointing since it was just a piece of inari. The Grilled Eel in the lunch set was very tender and quite a highlight, and the rice was very sweet and starchy, like Japanese rice should be. Honestly, I think I enjoyed my Êlunch set more than the main event. My friends had the Pork Buns, which they said had mayo in it, which made it very strange. Also, $9 for two "buns" (they're more like sandwiches) seems ridiculous*. If anything, you're paying for the ambiance, but I don't know if even that is worth the wait (sometimes as much as 2 hours) or the high prices ($14 for Ramen). I walked out feeling jipped. I'm glad I tried it, but I'm not at all interested in going back. *I said to my friend "9 bucks for pork buns! That's absurd." and he leaned in and whispered, "Well, we are about to pay $14 for Ramen". Touche, my friend, touche... Note1: If you don't eat pork, there is exactly one ramen dish for you. Yes, just one. Makes choosing easy! Note2: They won't let you take your leftovers home with you. I get their reasoning, but that's still absurd.

5 Stars for their call-your-cell-phone feature when your table is ready. We were told the wait was going to be 45 mins. - 1 hour (typical for a Sunday afternoon) so we left them our name and number and continued to stroll down the street to Union Square's Forever 21. Half way through, they called and said some cancellations came through so our table would be ready shortly. Food is pricey. We had 5 people so we had to order 3 orders of the Hirata Buns (2 pieces) which was $27 - for an appetizer. But those things are sooooooo delicious! Also ordered the Hirata Chicken Wings (3 pieces) which were okay because it seemed like they were drenched in too much sesame oil. Our server was super friendly so "Ohayo" to him! ***Also heard they will be opening a 2nd location in New York shortly!

After reading all the hype at this place and seeing how long the wait is when I got there, I had extremely high hopes for the ramen. The broth just wasn't as flavorful as Totto. We ordered the japanese shishito peppers and hirata pork buns and let me just tell you, I'm in LOVE with both of those appetizers. The peppers were addictive, and I couldn't stop eating them. The pork buns were a delight as well. Everything about it just swooned me. If i'm coming back here, it's for my love of the peppers and buns!

tried their new wasabi infused ramen today and thought it was okay. it has a slight kick at the end of each bite, but I would have preferred a stronger wasabi taste--halfway through my meal I had already gotten used to the flavor and barely noticed it. Still a solid bowl of ramen though--a full-flavored broth with chewy but not dense noodles and yummy kakuni pork belly that never fails me. I like getting the pork belly in the noodles--you get three huge chunks for an additional $4 instead of paying $9 to get smaller amounts in a bun with some sauce drizzled over it--more bang for your buck! And that matters when your basic ramen is already $15 to start. They served everyone hot tea afterwards which I thought was a nice touch, and definitely needed to help dilute all that sodium I just ingested. Service this time was a little funny--they scolded us when one additional person came to join our party and said that had she joined us after we had ordered, they would not have served her. I thought we were seated in a pretty spacious area that could have easily fit another 2 people, so I didn't quite see what the problem was. They also don't allow takeout, so we couldn't bring pork buns home for a friend. Other than those quirks, good place to enjoy a steaming bowl of ramen!

Ippudo totally lives up to the hype. Even though I am not a ramen fiend, the ramen here is as good as it gets. I had the classic hakata ramen set with the fried chicken rice and a small salad. The broth was rich but not at all cloying or greasy, and the noodles perfectly al dente. I really liked the pickled mustard leaf we ordered on the side in the soup as well, as it added some acidity to the overall porkiness. The fried chicken rice was pretty good as well, although a bit too sweet with the glaze and not spicy as it was supposed to be according to the menu. But then again, Japanese food is never really spicy... The service throughout our meal was excellent, which surprised me since this place is usually so packed. Luckily my party of 3 came on a Friday at 3 pm for a very late lunch, so we only waited about 5 minutes for a very large table all to ourselves. I would definitely come back again for some hearty, comforting ramen on a cold day during offpeak hours... don't think I am fanatic enough to endure a 2 hour wait when there are so many other options in the area.

Came here on a random Sunday when a friend came to visit. Heard great things about it, but did not realize that it is Yelp's top reviewed restaurant! Boils down to what you order. Ramen, meh, not great. I would not pay even half the price they charge for this too-salty dish. HOWEVER, with that said, the pork buns here are heavenly--these pork buns crush momofuku's pork buns any day. We also ordered the short ribs which were incredible. My friend and I decided that we would only eat these two things when we came. So my message to you--DONT COME FOR THE RAMEN. Momofuku's ginger noodles and chili noodles are way better.

This was the only place that my friend requested going to during our NY trip. When we arrived, we were happy to hear that the wait was only 30 minutes. While we waited, we had a couple drinks at the bar and tasted their pork hirata buns - so good. When we walked in, I was surprised to find the restaurant was actually pretty large, nice decor throughout, including a ramen bowl mosaic in the front. I tried the spicy miso ramen. It was much better than ramen I've tried at other places, which tends to be too thick and rich. This broth was much lighter yet still very flavorful and had just the right amount of kick. I ended up ordering a kakuni, braised pork belly as an addition to the ramen based on my friend's request. It was so tender and flavorful -- they should sell this at all ramen places!

Low lights, modern hip ambiance that appeals to the young crowd and older folk who like to try out new stuff. Ippudo is always busy especially at peak eating hours. People always line up for a bowl of ramen at this place. Food highlights for me included the Pork and Shrimp hirata buns, and my bowl of wasabi shoyu ramen with nitamago.. Absolute ramen perfection! The bowls are pretty huge but I think good enough for 1 person with a huge ramen appetite. Ippudo differs from other ramen joints because their broth is exceptionally tasty and varies from one kind of ramen to another; their noodles are also round and firm, and the toppings in the noodles further accentuate that first sip of broth and bite of noodle. A visit to Ippudo and a taste of their ramen will haunt you as it has continued to haunt me.. this has definitely raised the bar up high for all the ramen out there.

I gave it another shot, toughed it out and waited 2 hours and really didn't fall for the hype. This place is too commercialized to taste good. The menu was not as extensive as I think it should have been...for a place that is all ramen, they really need to expand it to include some more interesting dishes. Maybe by the time I finally got a table, even my taste buds were too tired to do anything, but I'd choose one of the many hole in the wall places over Ippudo. Sorry...

Okay... I'm the 3092th person to rate this place... Êthis place gets lot of traffic. No, it's not rubber-necking or accident... but congestion due to sheer volume. The staff was efficient and nice. Once we actually got to our seat, the water came within seconds. The waiter came for the drink order in a about a hot minute. Gave us about 5 minutes for the dinner menu. Pork buns came out about 10-15 minutes after we ordered. Ramen almost immediately after our empty pork bun dish was removed. To rate the food itself... it's a 4. You know... i preferred the pork buns from momofuku. The service i think may deserve a 5. But the wait.... oh ... the wait... Got there are 5:45. Left our name. Called around 7:20. Host recommended we come back. Waited on line to tell him we're back. Waited about 5 minutes until they called our name. By the time we were ordering our dinner... 8:00. 5:45 to 8:00PM!!! (Oh yeah, the host said 3 hour wait when we first walked in... but i thought, seriously?!?! 3 hours. can't be ... let's try) Granted it was Saturday night but NO! No food is worth that much waiting... unless I'm cooking, which in that case I'm multi-tasking. Not loitering around union square to kill time. My recommendation. Never had it before? Go... make the trip. Enjoy the adventure. Make sure you get there when you're not hungry so you can beat the ridiculous line. Would i go again...NEVER AGAIN. fun fact: supposedly this place is a chain in Japan. If i ever make it out to Japan... I'll try it there. I'm hoping the lines are shorter.

Ok, how many more reviews do you need for place! I came here on NY Marathon Weekend because I needed to carbo load. We started with the Yamitsuki Goma Kyuri Appetizer (japanese cucumber mixed with sesame oil dressing) - this was a good idea to start with this dish because it was refreshing! Let me say what blew everyone's mind at our table - the Hirata Buns Appetizer. AHHHHHH we kept ordering more and more. The manto buns were tasty and filled with pork or chicken .Mmmm mmm. Then my whole table ordered the Akamaru Modern Ramen - the broth is very good - thick and filling, although oily as well. I do have to say that this type of broth and the firmness/texture of the ramen takes getting used to. I still think the ramen I've had in Hawaii is my favorite, but it's probably just a matter of preference on broth flavor and noodle texture. Also I liked getting the Ramen Set as opposed to just the Ramen dish - the pork rice that comes on the side is excellent and the salad is refreshing. Prepare for long waits but then again you already knew =) . when you get into the actual restaurant it's actually quite open and spacious with a great 3 sided booths that could fit ~10 people.

This really is the best ramen in NYC. Those who don't have a passion for ramen could care less (they think it's just a bowl of soup) -- fine. However if you're a ramen aficionado this is as good as it gets. Be ready for an hour and a half wait (no matter what time of day). I suggest going well before you are hungry. It's worth the wait. Use the time to walk around the neighborhood or enjoy a cocktail at the bar. Warning: the "waiting area"/bar is CROWDED, but you should be used to it now in this city. No matter what anyone says, this is the best -- especially their seasonal ramens. When they're on the menu, don't turn them down. PS-Toto Ramen is a close second when you compare each restaurant's classic ramen menus.

This was my first time eating ramen and it was simply amazing. We had the pork buns, the hamachi, and two of the ramen bowls (Shiromaru Hakata Classic and the akamaru modern). All was extremely flavorful. The ramen and pork buns were soo good and so porky and so tasty. It's been three days later and I am still craving for the buns and ramen. ramen plus egg plus braised pork (15+2+4) = $21 and I would pay it again and again. They're noodles are made in-house and you can taste the difference.

I'd been wanting to go to Ippudo for a while now, but the long wait always kept me away. ÊGo early! We got there at about 6 and had no wait at all. We started with some sake and plum wine, which was nice. For an appetizer we had the shrimp buns. Oh man. I don't know what I was expecting, but this certainly wasn't it. It was Delicious. Perfectly cooked shrimp in a perfectly steamed bun with an out of this world spicy sauce. I want more just thinking about it. We both ordered the Akamaru Modern Ê Ê (The original "Tonkotsu" noodle soup topped with Ippudo's secret "Umami Dama" miso paste, pork chashu, cabage, kikurage, scallions, and fragrant garlic oil) And I added a soft boiled egg because that's my favorite part of ramen. The sliced pork was flavorful, but thin. I wish there had been more than two pieces. You can ask for a second set of noodles if you wish (Kae-dama) which is neat, but it's already a huge bowl. However, and I wish I'd known this before, They have a VERY strict no take out policy. Yes, you can get Ippudo delivered, but you cannot take your food home with you if you don't finish. Some of the best ramen I've ever had. It was flavorful and filling and really just perfect. Much better than the other places I've been in NYC

So I finally made it out to this place. For two of us, there was a 2 hour wait on a Saturday night. Should've known. No worries cause we grabbed drinks during that time, and actually came back in a bit over an hour to find that we were next. Sweet. Service was fast, friendly, and helpful, so no complaints at all there. Prices are a bit steep, as expected from a place like this, especially for the sake, ($20 for a glass?) but that's New York for you. The food definitely gets 5/5 for me. We had the salty peppers, grilled cod, octopus and pork buns as apps. Softest buns ever. Everything was really good, small portions, and again on pricey side, but so worth it. Then came the ramen. I must say, not the best ramen I ever had, and I like it a touch spicier, but really tasty. I had the traditional ramen with pork belly and it was rich, delicious and satisfying. If the line up wasn't so goddamn long I'd definitely make this place a staple but, alas, I feel like I can only come here on special occasions/big nights out. Good thing there are tons of good places right next door if this place doesn't pan out.

Everyone always complains about the long wait to get into this restaurant. Sure, you can't call in with a reservation, but that's okay. I came here twice, once for dinner on a Friday, and once for Lunch on a Saturday. Both days, I must have gotten lucky, for I waited no more than half an hour to get seated. Everyone always talks about how good the pork buns are. They truly are food sent from the heavens, though having too many can and will make you sick. The ramen choices are quite extensive and the combinations alone will boggle your mind. Combinging pork belly with any ramen is something I personally like to do. I would recommend this place to those looking for ramen, it's definitely a delicious place.

I went and ate the $20 bowl of ramen, it's kinda like getting the $20 burger, or the $20 burrito. It's good, and fun, but not on the regular.

To what lengths will people go for Ippudo's firm, flavorful ramen? A couple visiting from Boston in December told me they'd arrived in New York on a Friday, a day earlier than their last visit, so they'd be sure to get in. They'd missed out in their previous attempt. Neither a hyped Japanese brasserie nor a revived ramen craze brought this effort. Originally from Japan, the two had eaten in the island nation's Ippudo restaurants, which number 43; they were fans intent on eating at the New York branch. It is with similar determination that Ippudo's local patrons wait in the lounge to be seated in the East Village hot spot that spills out into the street at night and can command 20-minute waits at lunchtime. Reservations are not taken. Reasons to keep returning despite the crowds: * Arguably the best ramen in New York City. My favorites: Tori Ramen and Shiromaru Hakata Classic. (Ippudo was ranked #2 in January 2012 in the Village Voice's "NYC's 10 Best Bowls of Ramen.") * Culinary adventures such as the shishito peppers appetizer. Each jalapeno-like, lightly fried pepper surprises with a taste that can be mild or hot or killer. Diners can indulge in two taste sensations beyond the peppers themselves -- a squeeze of lemon and a dip into yuzu salt. * Eclectic musical soundtracks that sometimes reach back to the 1970s and 1980s. * A wide variety of sake that stops short of being overwhelming. * The chance for a solo diner to be seated immediately at the communal tables or the mostly dinner counter, despite a big crowd. * Interesting conversations with strangers at the communal tables, like the one I shared with the Japanese natives.

Overview: Order hirata (pork) buns & shishito FOR SURE! Then, any ramen is good!!!! There's a reason why theres such a long wait here and why Ippudo is said to be the BEST EATS in the country!! Why can't this place exist in Cleveland, where I currently reside? As my friends and I were getting on the NYC subway and getting lost on our way to Ippudo, my friend kept guaranteeing us it was worth getting lost and worth taking 2.5 hours before sitting down & eating at the restaurant. Uhm... he was so right!!!!! I came here on the FIRST SNOWSTORM that hit NYC in 2011 and my friends and I still take the subway to get to Ippudo just to taste this place. We had a 1.5 hour wait before we were actually seated. Appetizers: First, the waitress so nice and friendly! We ordered pork belly buns (Hirata Buns) as an appetizer from her and she recommended us these peppers called Shishito. Uhmm.. THE PORK BELLY WAS SOOOOO GOOD! With a group of 9 people, we ordered 10 pork belly buns (comes in 2s) and we had to fight for the last one by having the waitress spin a chopstick on the table to determine who gets to eat the last pork belly bun. The pork belly was soooooooo tender and fatty and YUM. The appetizer that REALLY took me by surprise was the Shishito. I don't eat peppers or onions because i reallyyy hate the flavor and texture of it. But for the first time in my life since awhile, i decided to be more ballsy and go for him and I am SO HAPPY i tried this! The shishito is sooooo good specially with lemon and the salt over it! We ended up with 3 leftovers and shared it among 9 people (1/3 of a pepper per person). Main course: Ramen Classic. I love how for $2 per additional toppings, you can pretty much add anything you want into the ramen. And if you dont have enough ramen, you can add noodles halfway through. Anyways, the ramen was AMAZING. the amazing part was definitely the broth. I haven't had such good borth for awhile.. you instantly know how long it must've taken for them to marinate and make the broth to such perfection! In addition, the broiled egg is made to perfection too. the egg isn't cooked and the egg white is cooked while the broth is left raw (sooo good!). Then, the chasu in the ramen is deliciousssss!! This place is a MUST GO if you are ever in NYC. The only thing my friends and I complained about may have been the ramen noodle.. the noodle they use is just this thin flat noodle. I thought ramen noodles are suppose to be more Q (chewy) and curly?

There's a few places in NYC that I absolutely have to stop by when I'm in town and this is definitely one of them. The first time I had ippudo was Jan 2011 and I craved it for 9 months until finally I was able to come to NY again and this was the ONE place I had to go to. First time I came here was during a cold Friday in January for dinner and had to wait 2 hours! (It ended up working out since we went to a nearby bar and ordered some beers before returning for our table). The second time I learned my lesson and went for lunch on Monday at 11am and had no wait at all! Ê Call me predictable, but ÊI ordered the same thing both times: Hirata Pork Buns and Akamaru Modern Ramen with Nitamago (Soft Boiled Egg) and Bakudan (Spicy Paste). The Akamaru Ramen is really good on it's own, but if you add the Bakudan, it takes it to a whole new level of deliciousness. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it! The Hirata buns are soooo perfect and it really is so much better from the Pork buns from Momofuku where the pork is just fatty and oily. Overall, my favorite place to eat in New York. Can't wait to go again!

Best.Ramen.Ever We waited about an hour last Tues. night and our party of 3 was seated around 10:30 PM. ÊTotally worth the wait! Here's what we ordered: Pork Hirata Buns (2 buns) - $9 Tori Ramen with Menma (bamboo shoots) - $15+$3 = $18 Shiromaru Hakata Classic Ramen with Kakuni (braised pork belly) and Onsen Tamago (poached egg) - $15+$4+$2 = $21 Akamaru Modern Ramen with Kakuni (Braised pork belly) - $15+$4 = $19 Diet Coke - $3, no free refills Kirin - $6 Our favorite of the 3 ramens was Akamaru Modern. ÊSooo wish they had a location in LA. We also saw the Food Network's Anne Burrell eating at the bar.

The first time I came here, I fell in love. The second and third time, not so much. It could be because it seems they made their portions smaller. The ramen soup is very good and the service great. The only downfall is the wait. Unless you go during off hours, you could wait up to two hours and I'm not sure that any place is worth that long. All in all, this soup hits the spot and is very comforting. I will visit again (at 2 or 3 in the afternoon).

I took my sister here for lunch. Knowing there are sometimes 2-3 hour waits, we came right at 10:45am and got seated 15 minutes later. If you plan on going early, the restaurant seats ~ 60, so as long as you're #1-60, you'll probably get seated. Listen to everyone else and get the pork buns. I was so excited to have ramen (pining over the amazing Ichiran I had in Japan), that I overdosed on my bowl. I ordered the Akamaru Modern + pork belly + half-boiled egg. It was good broth, but I was not expecting the noodles to be so thin. For some reason, my sister's bowl had the thicker, normal noodles. ÊWe asked about it and a waitress told us that there are 3 types of ramen noodles they use. I would have loved more garlic in my broth. Maybe that's just a preference thing. ÊI was stuffed to the brim from my bowl. My sister ordered the Karaka Miso Ramen, which was divine. Her soup was so pungent and left a fullness in your mouth. It was definitely a heavy soup base, but it's so memorable. I wish I had ordered that one! ÊPlus, for some reason, she got the normal noodles. Overall, I'd do it again, but it was CRAZY expensive. Ichiran in Tokyo is still my #1.

Apart from the outrageous price (for a bowl of ramen), Ippudo is one of the few ramen shops serving authentic Japanese ramen. Ê Specify the doneness of the ramen to "barikata" and the richness of the soup to "koime" when you place your order to experience a bowl of ramen close to what they serve in Japan. Ê I can't complain about the ramen, but I do question the concept of Ippudo...overcharging for the entertainment factor is not okay. ÊWait till another decent ramen shop opens up in Manhattan, which has already started happening e.g. Totto Ramen, and Ippudo will surely see its share of the NY ramen market fall, as Ippudo is only a mediocre franchise in Japan.

Out of my experiences with vegetarian ramen, Ippudo wasn't bad. Last year, I had a great experience with eating the Akamaru Modern ramen. This year, I had the Wasabi Shoyu Ramen which was good. I love the texture of the ramen. The soup was not salty either, and I could taste the faint flavor of the wasabi. As a part of the lunch special, I also had the unagi rice bowl which was awesome!! My hubby had the Akamaru Modern ramen which he liked a lot. He also ordered the spicy roe rice bowl which wasn't that exciting. Lunch specials were $17 each ($3 for rice bowl and $14 for ramen). Service was great as usual. I love the enthusiastic welcomes and thank yous from the kitchen. The wait to get into the restaurant was still horrendous - about 30 minutes for lunch and this was around 2pm. The verdict - Totto Ramen has better rice bowls compared to Ippudo. Totto is better for vegetarian ramen. Ippudo is better for the ramen with meat due to the broth.

Pork Buns and Ramen!!! I went to Ippudo while visiting NYC for a few days. ÊI've tried what many say is the best in my L.A. 'hood (Shin Sen Gummi). ÊBut I've got to say that Ippudo is the best I've ever had. Like seriously, no joke. ÊI'm having dreams about the pork buns. Food Ordered: - SHIROMARU HAKATA RAMEN w/ Nitamago Egg: Delicious, savory and hot. ÊPerfect amount of noodles. Pork is thinly sliced and yummy. - HIRATA PORK BUNS: ÊI would go back just for these items. ÊThe bread is fluffy, sauce is to die for, meat is tender and delicious. Ê Plus, they add a piece of lettuce which I've never seen in a pork bun before. ÊYOU MUST TRY! - HAKATA COCKTAIL - perfect lil cocktail before the ramen. Fortunately for me I didn't wait at all (I joined friends who were already waiting and about to seat) so I can't speak on the wait too much. Ê However, after I've tried their buns and ramen, I would think an hour or two wait would definitely be worth it.

What can I really say about this highly-rated eatery that over 3400 reviews haven't said already? ÊYes, the food is excellent. ÊIf you love ramen, this place is a must. ÊAnd the service is absolutely on point. ÊHubby and I came here on a Saturday night and upon putting our names down for a table for 2, we were told the wait would be 2 and a half hours. ÊOuch. ÊWe decided to take our chances and hope that a table would open up sooner, so we hung out at the bar and enjoyed some sake. Ê15 minutes later, the hostess approached us and informed us 2 seats at the counter were available. ÊCounter, huh? ÊWhy not? ÊWith front-row seats to the open kitchen, this was definitely the way to go. ÊSure, a table is nice, but when you are given the opportunity to watch all the action that goes on in the kitchen, you should seize it!

This broth is SO phenomenal, when I get my multi-million swag pad built, I'm going to have a faucet installed in the kitchen that dispenses this ramen broth anytime. That, or I'll just put their ramen master on my retainer so they can make me ramen with that delectable, succulent braised pork belly any time I want. Which is pretty much any time. The best testament to a restaurant's success is how long you have to wait for a table. In which case, this place must be ramen mecca or something. The place has a very chill, young vibe to it, with the staff still yelling their happy greetings whenever customers come in. I went for the classic tonkotsu ramen, and decided to add the braised pork belly, because of three words: Braised, Pork, and Belly. To this day, I can only count the smartest decisions I've ever made in my life on two hands. Adding the braised pork belly on that ramen would be on those digits. Goddamnit, it is so effing GREAT. It was so soft and fatty and unctuous and flavorful and...AAAAAAH. Just, amazing epicness, proper English be damned.

Yes, hate me. ÊAt 6:10 p.m. on a Wednesday night I waited 15 minutes and got seated for a party of two. Ê10 minutes after I checked in, the wait time for new signees was already up to 45-60 minute waits. ÊSo go early on a weeknight... beat the after work dinner crowd! Pork Hirata Buns - 2 for $9. ÊGood, flavorful fatty pork with lettuce and some mayo. ÊA little pricey (heck, everything is a pricey here for the quantity you get). Hirata Chicken Wings - 3 for $7 (they made us 4 pieces for an additional charge). Ê Sweet black pepper sauce that made my tastebuds jump, fried to the perfect crispness, loved it. ÊBut more than $2 per wing. ÊWorth trying, but Bon Chon is a much better deal. Ê Akamaru Modern - $15 with bamboo shoots (additional $3) with Kae Dama (extra noodles $2). ÊTonkatsu soup with miso paste, pork, and garlic oil. ÊA very good ramen, but I can't say for certain it's the best I've ever had. ÊI would've probably been better off not ordering the additional noodles because the extra ones I received were undercooked and a bit stiff. ÊWasn't fully absorbing with the soup. Ê Karaka Miso - $16. ÊMy friend ordered this and I got a taste. ÊIt's their version of spicy miso with pork. ÊNo complaints from me. Ê The decor is muted lighting, trendy, busy. ÊWe got seated at a communal table with two other couples we didn't know. ÊThe service is attentive and efficient. Ê Ê If you ever come to Los Angeles, I'll introduce to you some ramen places. ÊThe best ramen in the city is probably at Santouka, which ironically, can be found in various Japanese supermarket food courts. ÊFor under $10 you can have a the thickest, tastiest shio broth to go with your noodles. Ê Or you can wait at the Ippudo of Little Tokyo, Daikokuya, where the wait is always an hour (unless you go at 4 in the afternoon), but you can get a ramen and pork rice bowl combo for about $15. ÊAnd the chain Shin Sen Gumi isn't too shabby either. Ê Anyhow, slow your roll New York. ÊIs Ippudo really worth the hype? No. ÊBut are the noodles good? ÊYes. ÊI'd wait 30 minutes for it, but not 75 or 120 minutes.

The wait is long, so what? At least they let you grab some Japanese beer at the bar while waiting. It's expensive, so what? It's the best freakin ramen in the States! I won't make this review long because there are so many reviews on this restaurant anyway. Akamaru Modern - MUST. GET. With an egg, of course. Tori Ramen - If you want something else. Very clean taste. Chicken broth tends to make me feel gross afterwards.. Not this one! Pork Buns - W...t....h.... WHY SO GOOD?!?! You must get this. I don't care how full you'll be from the ramen.

One of, if not the best Japanese Ramen in town.. The decor at Ippudo is very modern and city sleek. But before you even get a chance to try their ramen, be prepared to wait a while. Due to its popularity, the wait can be upwards of over 2 hours. My suggestion is to leave your name down on their list and walk around the shops in the area or have a drink then go back. Luckily they will keep your name on the list if you are not present at the time they call it. Akamaru Ramen is best item I've tried there so far. Rich and flavorful broth with ramen cooked to perfection. Be prepared to pay for perfection though at $15 a bowl with only 2 pieces of chashu, pork. If you're a big eater like I am, save some of your broth for "Kae-dama" which is another portion of ramen at $2. Recently took my girlfriend there and she loved it. Funniest part was when we got home an hour later she said "I'm soooo surprised I didn't need to drink a gallon of water." Not too salty nor full of MSG. I can't wait for their midtown west location (Early 2012, 51st St, between 8th and 9th Ave) to open up since that might possibly shorten the wait times. Must try if you have not already.. Highly recommend.

What more is there to add to the 2600+ reviews already written? I'll summarize - 1. Get there early. I arrived about 4:45pm and there were about 6 people in line ahead of me. By time the doors opened at 5, there were many more people in line behind me. 2. Sit at the counter if you can. I asked to be seated at the counter and they happily accommodated me. It's great to watch the artists at work, delicately crafting your food. I was actually surprised at the number of non-Japanese in the culinary department. However, they spoke Japanese and had obviously undergone intensive training. 3. Order the pork buns. Yes they are a bit pricey at $9, but they are worth every single penny. The buns were steamed to perfection and the pork was so tender. It's a simple dish, only pork, lettuce, mayo, but sometimes the simplest things are the best. This was. 4. Take your pick of the ramen dishes. I chose the Akamaru Modern. The broth was amazing. The ramen is cooked slightly al dente, but it will continue to cook while in the bowl. I added Kakuni (pork belly) but I really didn't need it. There was plenty of pork chasu in the bowl any way. 5. Save room for dessert! - The crepe cake was delightful. Light and creamy, served with slices of kiwi and strawberries. I have never eaten anything as good as that dessert and sadly, I probably never will, (but that won't stop me trying) 6. The service is perfection. Typically Japanese (polite and gracious). My water glass was never empty, used plates and bowls whisked away promptly. Is it hyped? Yes. Is it worth the hype? Most definitely.

Here are my two cents since everyone has already said: THIS PLACE IS SO GOOD!! ÊIt was just me and my husband and we were told it was a two hour wait! ÊYikes! Ê(it was worth it!) ÊWe just ordered a couple of Ichibans at the bar along with those yummy looking pork buns that everyone else had and the time went by. ÊHardly anything is better than the first sip of Ichiban on tap and the pork buns were very delicious. ÊI got the Akamaru Ramen because it has miso and garlic, plus I added an egg and the spicy paste. ÊSO GOOD. ÊI had to unbuckle my belt to the next hole so I could stuff more down my stomach it was so good. ÊThe servers are very attentive, but aren't over your shoulder pressuring you rush. ÊI take one star off simply because this place is just so darn popular that you have to wait and it's quite expensive. ÊFor this kind of ramen, though, WORTH IT.

Laura and I looked at each other as soon as we sat down, "This place is so New York." ÊSure, Ippudo had a 20 minute wait at 11pm. ÊAnd the dark, slick interior is cool as can be. ÊThumping club music bounces offs the wall and all the servers and cooks yell out greeting in Japanese to each new party. ÊThe point is, Ippudo oozes atmosphere. ÊAnd places that do that usually get by with average or good food. But Ippudo has amazing food. ÊTruly delicious. ÊJapanese gourmet ramen. ÊA concept that sounds so simple until you taste it. Ê My recommendation: Order the pork buns for an appetizers and stick with the classic ramen. ÊLaura and I both loved our dishes, large bowls filled with noodles and other fresh ingredients. Bottom Line: Ippudo has top notch food and atmosphere. ÊIt's cool and delicious. ÊThat's rare, and is why there is still a wait for dinner at 11pm.

This is a good spot to take out-of-towners, especially those who don't mind waiting an hour or more for a bowl of ramen and love the bells and whistles this place has to offer. The Akamaru Modern is fine, but the Karaka was better and more flavorful in my opinion. Pork belly buns are good, too. (Momofoku's are slightly better though.) My friends rave and rave about Ippudo and visitors always want to trek here to cross it off their foodie checklists. HOWEVER, if you just want a delicious bowl of ramen without the frills and fuss and long lines and constant yelling of Japanese phrases and you don't feel like spending a lot of time and money to slurp up some noodles in 5 minutes -- then go to Minca in East Village. It hits the spot and you don't have to wait forever.

why is the wait always overquoted? BY 1 HOUR! One time, they told us the wait is 3 hours. ... I would get the fried chicken wings every time. I can eat just that. My fav Japanese fried chicken. Pork buns are good, but I'm not a fan of mayo, which is in the pork buns. I would eat any of the ramens. And all if I can. The broth is rich and semi-clean at the same time. I've only came here with out-of-towners after the time they told me it's a 3 hour wait. Redic. Will not wait here to eat ramen on any regular night. But, I can eat this on any regular night.

I have to say....second time around with 2 years since my last visit and I think the food has gone downhill. MAJORLY DOWNHILL. Ramen has become a very trendy food....cause it's DELICIOUS when it's done right. For as simple as this dish may be, the broth is key to the whole dish. You get that wrong and it's all show. When I lived in LA I ate ramen once a week in several places around Little Japan and Downtown LA. So when I was in NY and wanted some ramen, I found Ippudo on Yelp and my friend and I ventured to try it. I remember the ramen being REALLY REALLY good. Cut to my most recent visit to New York, and now, this place is all the rage....so being on my own with a pretty decent hangover I got there at 11am and was seated right away. I ordered the PORK BUNS and the AKUMARA MODERN Ramen. If you have ever had the pleasure of eating pork buns at Momofuku, don't bother ordering them at Ippudo....waste of calories. The RAMEN dish looked beautiful when it came. The Akumara Modern is a TONKUTSO broth, which is a broth created by boiling pork bones over high heat for many hours, which suffuses the broth with a hearty pork flavor and a creamy consistency that rivals milk or melted butter or gravy. Read that? CREAMY......it's the flavor that makes you delirious with flavor. Ippudo's ramen does NOT have a great tonkutso broth. The noodles where pretty good....but without that broth......it's a loss. Too bad.

I LOVE YOU, IPPUDO. It's places like you that give me hope after having bad dining experiences! With your consistently great food and service, I will always sing your high praises. Ê I returned after a long while with my gf and we had a fantastic meal! We had dinner on a weekday right after work. There was no wait and we were able to get a table and not have to sit at the awkward communal table. We decided to order something we both never had before, the "Piri-kara" Ika Sansai ($8) which is Smoked Squid and Mountain Vegetables w/ Spicy Sauce and then we decided to order a favorite of both of ours, the Hirata Pork Buns ($9) which comes with 2 Buns filled with Pork served w/ their Ippudo Original Spicy Buns sauce. The Smoked Squid came on 4 little open lettuce wraps, which contained the pieces of the delicious smoky and savory squid and vegetables topped with the spicy sauce. The Buns were just as delicious as I remembered them. The buns were fluffy and the pork was juicy and sweet and a little Êspicy at the same time. Ê Onto the star of the evening, the RAMEN! I ordered the Akamaru Modern ($15). It was the first ramen I tried on my first visit and I loved it so much that I haven't been able to try another one. My homegirl, Yu-Ching L., told me to get an extra with it: Poached Egg. This took my ramen to a whole other level. Breaking the egg and seeing that yolk break all over the delicious broth and noodles was a beautiful sight!! I think I'll be doing this from now on!! Like a beast I licked my bowl clean. 5 stars, always and forever. Thank you Ippudo once again for a wonderful meal!

Ippudo is amazing. We went for lunch a few weekends ago, and had to wait 20-30 minutes for a table of 3. Best wait ever, as we stood at the bar and enjoyed some authentic beers and 2 plates of the best pork-buns ever created. These rice buns were so soft, pillowy, and perfectly chewy and stuffed with perfectly roasted pork, with a little sliver of lettuce and some sort of sauce that I couldn't really put my finger on. HEAVENLY, and also $9 for 2. We split 2 orders and were raving about them while finishing our brews. 20 minutes went quickly, and we were soon perusing the ramen menu. I went with the house special and staff recommended "Akamaru Modern". My dining companions had the daily special ramen, and the spicy "tonkatsu" (pork-based broth) ramen. All 3 were phenomenal! I've eaten a lot of ramen and udon all over the country, and this was definitely the best bowl of soup my spoon has ever encountered. I was recently in Hawaii for a few weeks, and had what I thought was the best bowl of ramen ever, but Ippudo soon set me straight! Yes, it's like $14-20 for a bowl of soup, and the pork apps are a little pricey, but all are expertly executed and there's a bar, so c'mon.... It's a fun little space too, just be plan for the wait or to get there early enough...I think i'll go this Memorial Day Weekend, the wait has to be less, no?! Haha...

I really dig this place. It has amazing ramen noodles and divine pork buns that, for my money, beat out those at momofuku. The space itself is lots of fun, as in, hip, modern, good looking, asiany. We had to wait for about an hour, which I am starting to see might be standard for ramen places. The cocktails were great as well. The table set up..it's a bit odd because you will be sharing a large table with groups of other people. But that's part of the fun now, isn't it? We split a pork ramen, and the noodles were amazing. They had to have been home made. Broth was spicy. Definitely enough for 2 not very hungry people to split.

My first time here and it was ok. The wait wasn't too bad but there were only 2 of us. The ramen is too soggy for me and I'm sure I've had better ramen for less. BUT the pork buns.. they are delicious! kind of expensive for just 2 ($9), but it was something I would go back for.

Short & sweet: Service: 4 Food: 5 Wait time: 5 Price: 4 Cleanliness of bathroom: 4 So yum! We got there at around five-thirty or six so there was no waiting - excellent! The ramen (I think: Akamaru Modern) was delicious, yes, with the tasty broth and noodles and all, but the pork buns we had for our appetizers were phenomenal. What was in it? Pork and heaven? Pork and angel dust? I don't know, but all I know that it was pricey, but so worth it. The entire meal was worth it.

I love, love, love ramen, and this is one of the best places in NYC to get it. They have good variety and the broths are delicious. My complaints are that they are a bit too expensive and the thinly sliced pork is very dry. The pork at Totto Ramen is far tastier. This is a great place to take someone visiting NYC.

I can't say this place is worth the wait nor that it's amazing. I remember waiting but don't really remember what I ate here. Not worth the wait and overrated. If there's no line then definitely give it a go. I stand by my statement "Ramen is Asian for Cereal"

Still a must go amongst all the ramen joints in NYC and I still consider them one of the better examples of customer service BUT last night's fail is worth an update. As I mentioned, they'll take your number if the wait was long. ÊLast night, my out of towners and I, six total, ended up with a 5+ hour wait which put us at 12-12:30AM. ÊI convinced everyone to just nibble around East Village with me to wait for Ippudo. ÊThe night progressed and I even called at 10:40 for an update ... grr still 12-12:30. I finally called at 12:20:08AM (from my phone log) since we hadn't heard a word. "WHAAAAATTT???!!!! You tried to call me?" ÊTurns out they were trying to call me (with a number which was obviously not mine). ÊIt gets worse, we show up and they refuse to serve us (trying to close down the kitchen- I get it). ÊWhat I don't get is how they failed to mention that our time slot would be at closing. Ê What's worse is the hostess, (not the usual girl who took my name & number) who apparently was calling the wrong number, AND the MANAGER failed to apologize for the mishap on their end. ÊThat's just bad business. ÊI have faith that they were trying to get a hold of us, but I believe they handled the situation wrong. I hope this is a warning to other Ippudo faithfuls. ÊThey are good, but not perfect. ÊKeep calling because you don't want to be stuck expecting ramen on a chilly night for five hours for nothing.

I love Momofuku so it's taken me two years of living in New York to get to Ippudo. ÊWell, there's room for both in my heart. ÊI prefer the pork buns at Momofuku and the ramen at Ippudo. ÊThe wait here can be scary but if you come after 10pm you'll get right in. ÊThe Modern ramen is my favorite, not too salty, perfectly seasoned and not too heavy (although I still prefer to split it with someone). ÊThe pork buns are so different than Momofuku and I like them almost as much. Ê They taste less asian than Momo's in a way--more spicy and with a mayo based sauce. ÊIncredibly delicious and so crave-worthy. ÊThe staff here is super nice and fun and the atmosphere is trendy and fun. ÊThere's some pretty big tables making it perfect for big groups. ÊIf I ever get over how amazing their Modern ramen and pork buns are, perhaps I'll even try something else on the menu one day : )

My favorite ramen in New York period. You'll be dreaming about their tonkotsu (pork bone broth) for days after. It has a deep and developed flavor that is unmatched. If your smart and patient with the walk-in policy there shouldn't be too much of an issue for a small group. I often come right before last call and walk right in for the communal table. Every bowl of ramen I've ever had here has been fantastic but i tend to stick with the 'Akamaru Modern' or the 'Miso' with Kakuni (braised pork belly) or Bakudan (spicy bomb). Dont forget a draft Sapporo!

Finally! On a Sunday afternoon, a party of 6, and 4pmish, we only had to wait 45 minutes to be seated @ Ippudo! I was super excited because my brother (@Droolius.com) really hyped this spot up! We ordered the pork buns, which was exquisite with the fatty pork pieces and airy buns! ÊIf I could have had my way, I would have just ordered the yummy white buns by themselves! So I ordered the Shirimaru Hakata Classic with Extra Egg ramen and my boyfriend ordered the Akamaru Modern Ramen (one of Ippudo's specialties). Ê My Shirimaru hakata classic really reminded me of SSG's ramen (YELP list: http://www.yelp.com/listÉ), where I fell in love with pickled ginger & soft-boiled eggs in my ramen! ÊThe main reason I ordered this ramen is because it was one of the few listing the pickled ginger! ÊI loved it! ÊHowever, I noticed that the ramen here did have MSG (unlike SSG), because I definitely started getting sleepy after inhaling my ramen! :( Now that Akamaru Modern Ramen was pretty different & spectacular! ÊI really enjoyed the infused garlic oil. ÊThe broth was pretty awesome! And, there was a wasabi ramen available that day. ÊMy boyfriend tasted his friend's ramen and said the broth tasted just like wasabi! LoL. ÊI bet that cleared any clogged nostrils! This place really lives up to its hype. ÊIF you are a ramen aficionado, you should definitely come here!

I'm glad I tried this place because of all the hype, but the broth of the Akamaru Modern just didn't blow my mind. The spicy ball of paste on the top was also a bit unnecessary. It was a kind of in between spiciness that gave it a neither-here-nor-there flavor. The noodles were also straight and on the thin side, versus the al dente wavy noodles that I prefer in ramen. I noticed some of the other ramen came with this kind of noodle, so it could just depend. For all the rave over the Akamaru Modern though, I just wasn't impressed. I also tried the pork buns which were raved about, but I didn't think it was worth the price. The iceberg lettuce it came with also wasn't to my liking. The prices were quite inflated too, possibly because of the fame and hype that this place as has. Even though this is New York, I still couldn't justify in my mind a $15 bowl of ramen and $9 pork buns. The venue had a very trendy vibe though, and it would be great for groups, since they had some longer tables. They seated us community style with different parties all at the same long table. Nobody seemed to mind, because they were all about getting some ramen! There was also loud top 40s music blasting with the waiters yelling out Japanese phrases every now and then. Ê Glad I tried it once, but probably not going to be my go-to-ramen place. Luckily there was no wait at all for this place at 6pm on a Monday, because it wouldn't have been worth an hour long wait.

When in New York...go to Ippudo. Not because it has over 2900+ reviews or anything...but it does help. I'd never seen that many reviews for one restaurant, we had to go. I think it upholds it's reputation has being one of the finest Ramen Noodle houses in NY. I would advise to go early if you want to avoid waiting but it is inevitable and worth the wait. We made it just as they started serving (5:00 p.m. on a Monday). We didn't get the pork buns but I hear they are the best. I got the Akamaru Modern Ramen. The broth was light and tasty. Love the noodles. You also get tea close to when you are done with your meal. Perfect temperature. Not too hot or cold. Bring some real ramen to Texas!

Ok I gave it an extra star since last year was the last time I've been here. Waiting 2 hour plus when other groups of over 4 passed us by...NOT fun. ÊI guess you have to throw a fit in order to have your group get sit faster like I saw other groups doing when they arrived WAY later. Ugly. I guess the key is to come by yourself or in a pair, the wait was so short! Being hungrier this time I thought the ramen was better lol. ÊLast year I got their special tan tan men. ÊThis time I got something off their regular menu, ÊKaraka Miso Ramen--which I thought was really good. Ê It was strong flavors of ginger which I liked and also spicy. ÊI also had the pork buns this time; the meat was really flavorful and slightly a hint of spiciness. Also they have Lady M cakes! We tried that and also the Matcha brulee. ÊThe desserts were ok. Ippudo, granted it is not the best, but its the best compared to all the other ramen place I tasted. ÊWould I wait 2 hours again for this place? OH HELL NO! Next time when other friends are visiting and they want to try this place, I am going to send them off with a picture map and tell them I'll meet them three hours later, seriously. I don't think its that good or worth it...but I guess it a good standard to start off with if you've never had ramen.

This should be filed in the over-hyped folder. Broth: Hands down the richest and most flavorful I've ever had. No question, the best. Noodles: Skinny and not particularly interesting. I would have preferred them fatter and a little undercooked so you get that slightly soft almost chewy texture. Pork bun: Perfect ration of fat to meat, probably 40/60. So tasty, but only questionably worth a second look because those tiny things are $9 for 2. I will agree that this is good ramen, but they've turned a street dish into the focus of an overpriced destination for the kind of people who think that food trucks are really edgy and don't have the imagination to explore other places for what is basically a very expensive version of what we ate late at night in college using a hotpot.

Had to add this review to speak out about their seating policy. ÊMost restaurants have a policy where you can't be seated until all members of your party are present. There is logic to this policy but there are also times to be a little lax with the policy. ÊFor example, meeting a friend at Ippudo for a late lunch (3 pm) on a Monday, my friend was a bit late. ÊI knew what my friend wanted to order but no, they wouldn't seat me without my friend. ÊMy friend arrived and we were about to be seated but my friend decided to pop downstairs to use the restroom. ÊWe couldn't be seated because "not all the members of our party were present". ÊWTF? Ê I tried to reason with the hostess that we are both here and I know what my friend wants to order. She was unwilling to budge. ÊI explained that we were in a bit of a hurry, but she was unmoved. ÊHer explanation was that the waiters won't even take your order unless both people are there. When we were seated we discovered that the dining room was barely half full making their strict adherence to the rules seem even more ridiculous. ÊIt's a shame that Ippudo hires people who can't think for themselves when circumstances shift slightly from the norm. Ê If you're in the same situation--knowing that your friend will be late--just ask to be seated on your own; don't mention that you are waiting for someone. ÊThey can't really seat you at a one-top. ÊJust make sure your friend knows to come to the dining room to find you.

communal style seating, which i dont mind, but it gets extremely loud and very hard to have a conversation. majority of the menu is filled with pork! i do NOT eat pork, so not many things i could eat. i had the veggie ramen and wasnt quite impressed. very salty and not much substance or flavor. it literally tasted like the ramen from the sq size package u get from the grocery store.

Be prepared for a very long wait: 1.5hrs for me. ÊI had enough time to walk to another restaurant, eat and then be back for this hyped up ramen joint. ÊThe atmosphere was great. ÊI walked in and it feels like I'm in a club with the upbeat music and cool dcor. ÊThis place I heard is known for its ramen bowls. ÊI ordered the Shiromaru Hakata Classic: the original "Tonkotsu" noodle soup topped with pork loin chashu, kikurage, menma, red pickled ginger, sesame, and scallions. ÊThe noodle is different than the traditional ramen noodles. ÊThis is thinner and tastes lighter than the other ramen place which is my favorite part of the dish.

The Shiromaru Hakata Classic has all of the characteristics of an excellent bowl of shiro (white) ramen. All of the ingredients (pork char-siu and veggies) are flavorful and distinguishable. The noodles are chewy/ springy. ÊThe pork broth is especially flavorful and nourishing. At the end of the meal, your bowl will probably bear the mark of good ramen; that is, you'll see the bottom of your bowl! The decor is nice too, and service is very fast.

This is only my second time in this ramen joint and the noodles are just awesome! Its busy, its lively, sure you get to wait quite A While before you get seated, but its how you know the place is really good! Everyone goes for the Akamaru Modern to try and it is indeed a great choice! I brought my boyfriend here on one of our night outs in town and he definitely loved the place. Everyone greets you with a shouting welcome of buzzing waiters and waitresses. And the food comes in fast and fresh! The Akamaru is a huge serving set in a red bowl with tender noodles and a really tasty broth. I couldn't even finish mine three quarters down, but the Novio loved it so much that he didn't hesitate when I offered the rest of mine. Oh yeah. If you plan to venture out to this ramen place, and its your first time, make sure to put your name down at least half an hour to an hour early before you meet with the rest of your party. Either that or simply get a few drinks at a nearby bar and then come back just in time.

Came here on a Thursday night and the place was packed. Ended up waiting 1.5 - 2 hours to get seated. Luckily, we got there during their happy hour so two beers for 6 bucks plus meeting some cool New Yorkers helped us pass the time.

This review will just get swallowed up but heck I'll still write a review. At night I still drool for a bowl of ramen from Ippudo and only dream of when I can visit New York next to eat more ramen. It is the place for which I now compare all ramen that I eat. Ê The Yuzu Citrus Sake is so good. My fiance ordered one and it was so good we ordered a second. You have to try the Hirata Buns filled with pork or chicken which is served with Ippudo original spicy buns sauce, mayo, lettuce, and tomato. My fiance liked the Yamitsuki Goma Kyuri - Japanese cucumber mixed with sesami oil dressing. I though it was just ok. It just so happens that Japanese cucumber is so freaking delicious. Lol. My fiance's ramen - Akamaru Modern - The original "Tonkotsu" noodle soup topped with miso paste, pork chashu, cabage, kikurage, scallions, and fragrant garlic oil and for toppings we also added braised pork belly and a poached egg. Oh my lord, divine. My bowl, the Karaka Miso Ramen - Soybean paste and pork noodle soup with a blend of hot spices, topped with pork chashu, cabbage, spinach, menma, fresh grated ginger, and scallions ----and of course I added a little more toppings of poached egg and braised pork belly. Pork belly melts in your mouth, so flavorful and perfectly cooked. Yum. The Annin Sorbet - Sweet tofu custard topped with a pear sorbet, mint leaf and strawberry, I ordered it because it was almost Nina spelled backward. I am such a loser, hahaha. But it was yummy.

I have been looking far and wide for a good ramen place. I'm from Chicago and sadly our best ramen is the $7 one from the Santouka in Mitsuwa (Not that I'm not complaining, but I figured someone would have opened up a good independent ramen place in Chicago by now). After having excellent ramen in the Bay area (Ramen Halu in San Jose, Orenchi in Santa Clara), I was looking this time to NYC for my ramen fix. People have very specific preferences when it comes to ramen. I'm drawn to fatty tonkotsu broths like a fat man to a cupcake. I was torn between getting the classic and the Akamaru, and finally decided on the latter and added a soft boiled egg. It was an excellent choice. That garlic oil is awesome and really amped up the savoriness of the broth. The noodles were perfectly al dente when I first started eating, but I was trying to savor my ramen and ate too slow -- that hot broth cooks your noodles, so if you're picky about the firmness of your noodles, scarf those noodles down. I don't know if I'd be willing to wait 2 hours for this place (cuz really, what really is worth waiting 2 hours for?), but if you come at the right time, at most you wait 45 minutes. And it doesn't hurt that they take your cell phone down either.

I ordered the spicy miso ramen.Being the fatass that I am, I added the braised pork (because the menu told me to...lol). Bad idea.

Finally paid a visit here after hearing about all the hype from everyone and their mom...which may have impacted my review of this place. Had to wait an hour to be seated (which we expected). But, they really should utilize a more formal system of calling out the people to be seated instead of just calling out the name, since I had to squeeze myself into the crowded bar area in fear of not losing my place on the list. Ê Anyway, we got seated and ordered the pork buns to share and akamaru modern (yeaaaaaaah we were playing it safe). The buns arrived promptly and they didn't disappoint! The fluffy buns, fatty pork, and the mayo worked so well and the deliciousness + my hunger lead to me devouring that in less than a minute...although I really tried to savor that ish since it cost me $4.50 for one... Then the akamaru modern came. It was definitely mediocre for me. Although I understand that the noodles are supposed to be thin for these types of ramen (I'm half-japanese, goddamnit), I preferred them to be a little thicker and chewier. Also, the broth wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped for. I was let down :( Service was great, waiters/waitresses were popping up everywhere refilling our water/checking up on us. and this place was kind of dark so sometimes, i was like, woah!

There's no doubt that the noodles here are delicious. The wait for a table took forever though. It was like an hour wait for a table for 2... I got the Akamaru Modern. The BF got the same with the pork belly. I love love love the chashu and the noodles, I just wish there was more of both in a serving. I also tried his pork belly, it was tasty and tender, but I just couldn't get enough of the chashu. We were seated at a large table sharing it with a few other customers. The couple who sat across from us ordered the Samurai Ribs. I definitely want to try it the next time I come from the smell alone. Too bad it was like $18 for what looked like 4 pieces...

After a long flight from LAX to JFK, we were picked up by some generous friends and made a beeline for Ippudo NY. Being noodle monsters, we had to give it a try after hearing so many rave reviews. // LOCATION // Unpretentious location in the East Village that was easy to miss due to a lot of construction and large scaffoldings blocking the entrance. Scarce street parking was snagged across the street. // AMBIANCE // I felt like I was in the Tao nightclub of ramen restaurants. The restaurant actually extends pretty far back and is much larger than it appears. The lighting and Asian-themed decor gave the restaurant a popping bar vibe. // WAIT // 30 minutes on a Wednesday night at 6:30 PM // FOOD // + Tori Ramen : Came in an adorable bowl. Lighter soup than the miso ramen. Add a poached egg for added deliciousness + Miso Ramen : Delicious and creamy. Topped with a melon-ball Ê Ê Êscooped round of ginger that incorporated into the broth nicely. Not for ginger non-believers. + Pork buns : The buns were soft and pillowy while the pork belly melted in your mouth. Definitely not healthy dining though. + Chicken buns : Ordered for the bf who is definitely not a fan of pork. The chicken was so juicy and flavorful you definitely did not feel like you were missing out from not eating the pork buns. + Cheesecake : Japanese style cheesecake that was creamy without being overwhelmingly sweet the way many American style cheesecakes can be. Including a crispy layer for added texture. Overall, in a comparison between Momofuku Noodle Bar and Ippudo, Ippudo wins for better ramen while Momofuku wins for better pork buns (they include delish pickled cucumbers)

Good luck trying to find a seat in this house...let alone take a piss on the window outside. Horrendous wait time, but damn the food is BLEEP'N good! It makes me want to get up and go back to the kitchen and shoot the chef, just like Once Upon A Time In Mexico. For appetizers, you should try indulging on the Agedashi Tofu Yasai Ankake and Hirata Chicken Wings. ÊThe wings are not over fried, over marinated and the black pepper sauce gives it a nice kick. ÊThe Tofu feels like it's melting in your mouth with ever bite. The Tori Ramen was my pick for dinner. ÊThe broth is rich in flavor, the meats and veggies accompanying the ramen were all fresh. Ê Overall, very attentive server, but then again, the service is always great here. ÊJust waiting for a table makes you want to pick up knitting or whatever fancies you.

3.5 stars. I have yet to find a really good bowl of ramen in the city. Everyone raves about Ippudo, so I had to check it out. I came here late night with a few friends (that was the only time there wasn't a line) and ordered the Shiromaru Hakata Classic ramen. While the broth was good, the noodles were a little thin for my liking. Others at the table ordered the Akamaru Modern, which came in a cool red bowl... perhaps I'll try that next time. Though overall, I'm not convinced paying $15 for ramen is worth it. The Hirata pork buns are pretty delicious. -L.

On our first food tour to NY, my friends and I defeinitely wanted to check out Ippudo NY because of all the reviews. We went around 2ish that time and it was packed! the wait was at least 45 min for 4 people. Needless to say, we had another appointment and had to cancel. So on my second food tour to NYC, I HAD to try to Ippudo. My bf and I arrived at around 1:30P on a Monday. We were pleasantly surprised that our wait was only around 10 minutes. Ê When we called, we were greeted by all the employees speaking Japanese. The set up of the Êrestaurant is quite unique. There are individual tables surrounding the restaurant and there's a big main table where people from multiple parties share. we got sat at the big main table. My bf ordered Akamaru Modern Ramen and I ordered the Miso Ramen with nitamago (boiled egg). Both ramens were delicious but I loved mine. ÊCompared to Totto's miso ramen, Ippudo's miso ramen broth seems creamier or thicker, which I enjoyed. Make sure to fully mix in the ginger ball on top of the miso ramen because it definitely adds great flavor to the ramen. We also ordered the pork buns (Hirata Buns). Again, we were pleasantly surprised. they were very soft and the sauce was very good. At the end of lunch, they gave us a hot tea to drink. We couldn't drink too much because we were already sweating from eating our ramen up. Ê I definitely would eat here again, but try to find a time when it isn't too busy (after lunch...it seems like people in NYC like to take their lunches around 1:00P). ÊI'm not sure if it's worth waiting hours for this ramen, but will definitely hit the spot on a cold, wintery day!

i waited over an hour. for RAMEN. absurd right? I'd only do this in NY. the ramen is delicious, slightly reminiscent of daikokuya because of the fatty broth. the noodle texture here is more on the smooth side. the samurai ribs were AMAZING. meat slid off the bone, with flavor still intact. all in all, it was a great meal. but if you have a limited time in the city (as i did), I would probably opt for another place with a shorter wait. but maybe i just say that cuz i live in LA where amazing ramen is prevalent

Is there any point in writing a review at this point? ÊPlace is delicious, atmosphere is top notch, and service is very friendly. ÊThere are no reservations so expect to wait between 30 minutes and 2 hours depending on night and party size. ÊOnce you DO get seated though expect to wait less than 10 minutes for your meal. ÊWhile you wait, try the pork bun apps and have a couple of pints at the bar. ÊOr, if pork bun deliciousness doesn't appeal to you and the bar is too crowded, feel free to roam the local area for a pre-dinner cocktail/app elsewhere and come back around the time they say the wait is, they'll be happy to let you know where you are in line. ÊA great date spot or even get together for friends. ÊI would recommend a relatively small party, however, as the already long wait times can grow for 6+.

Konichiwa! The waiters, hostess, sushi chefs, and managers welcome each guests as they walk in....does it get to your head when you hear them great some other party? who cares....i'm too focus on the food to notice anything. We waited what felt like days outside in the dark in the the cold (it was around 45 degrees when I visited). We were the first to enter the intimate setting of Ippudo. I felt like a king. Good service and better food...something I thoroughly enjoy. The pork Hirata Buns are a must as an appetizer...and you'll need 2 for yourself, trust me. Soon after, order their ramen (either Shiromaru Hakata Classic or Akamaru Modern). Here's is the tricky party: eat fast and savor the taste....you'll need to let it cool for a bit since they come hot. Once it settles then go at it before it gets cold and the taste dies with it. Getting full? Not enough noodles? Ask for Kae-dama if you dare....an extra serving of noodles for the fearless. When you're bowl is empty, sit back, let what you have ingested enter your mind, body, and spirit. You'll feel a sense of awe. Be happy that you have got to experience this....pay a well deserved tip. Go home and sleep...your coma awaits you.

You can ADD PORK BELLY. I mean, come ON! This place is just outrageously good. High recommendations go to the Akamaru Modern, a traditional bowl served with the restaurants secret "Umami Dama" (read msg). And don't forget to save room for kae-dama, a double portion of noodles for just $2. The pork buns are also solid, if you're feeling hungry enough. My girlfriend took one bite and declaimed, "I want to eat only this for the rest of my life." They are not as good as the Momofuku buns, however. On the lighter side, the cucumber salad is delicious and creative: a great way to get in some greens without filling up your belly. You WILL wait for a long time if you go during any normal dining hour, so get used to that idea. Just goes with the territory, and you can't fault a place for being popular.

Akamaru Modern is the best NYC can do for (tonkotsu) ramen? I sure hope there are better because it's not nearly as flavorful as the delicious bowls you find in Japan. I know places in the U.S. have replicated it, but this place didn't do it for me. And while their pork buns (Hirata buns- $9) were pretty good, I have to admit that David Chang does this much better. Also, every good ramen should come with an egg (nitamago, which is boiled in a seasoned broth, or hanjuku tamago, a slow-cooked runny egg). This place makes you pay $2 in addition to the already overpriced $15 bowl. $17 for ramen is laughable. The bottom line is, everything was pretty good, but I wouldn't come back unless someone reeeally wanted to take me there. I hate to be a ramen snob, but if you're ever in Tokyo, you have to try Nagi Ramen in Shibuya. It's also about 800 yen ($10), which is the most you should ever have to pay for ramen.

Went on a Thursday evening, put our name down at 7, gave them our cell number in case their 2-hour prediction was too long, and walked over to Financier Patisserie for a snack. ÊWalked back to Ippudo at 8 and had drinks at the bar until we were seated at 9. Ê This is ranked #4 in my husband's ramen list of favorites and I can see why. ÊThe broth is to delicious and the pork is so soft and flavorful. ÊOnly reason it's #4 is the type of noodles that they use. ÊIt's just not his favorite kind (thin eggy noodles that don't taste like they were just made in the kitchen). ÊAside from that everything else is delicious and goes well together. Ê I had the modern ramen that has some miso and garlic oil added to the bowl. ÊI really enjoyed it. ÊI also added half-boiled egg too. ÊWe all shared the pork buns that were good but I've had better. ÊIt was interesting that they add mayo to the little sammich. ÊMy favorite dessert was the green tea ice cream with mascarpone cheese, pistachios, and honey. ÊSounds strange but it totally works and I gobbled it up.

The ramen was good (altho a little too rich for my tastes) but the pork buns are the real standout. My friend and I ate one each, and I ended up wishing I hadn't agreed to split the dish with her.

I really was expecting to be disappointed by this place because all I've heard was hype... .........but DEAR GOD THIS IS THE BEST RAMEN I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!!!!!!!!! I got the Akamaru Modern and honestly, everything was perfect. The texture of the ramen noodles, the flavor of the soup, THE TASTE OF THE PORK (I wanted to cry it was so good)... the only thing that would have made it even better is if they gave an even bigger serving because I could have eaten that stuff FOREVER.

Came here on a Wednesday night to have dinner with Leo P. I've heard/read about this place numerous of times but never actually thought I'd get to ever experience it. Not gonna lie, I was a little overwhelmed with the crowd. As soon as you open the door, you've stepped into the bar. It was jam packed...to the point where I could read the text messages someone to the left of me was sending on her Crackberry. The wait was almost an hour but with the drinks Leo and Christian (the bartender) were handing me, I completely forgot about the wait or the fact that we went there for noodles. We were seated...loved the dimmed lighting (romantic setting). And we ordered 4 appetizers: some type of chopped raw octopus with juicy wasabi things it was marinated in, some sort of shrimp things, a fish thingamajig and yeah, sorry I'm not helping. But they were pretty solid...my favorite was the wasabi octopus. (was it even octopus? Idek anymore.) Finally, the noodles. I got the wasabi shoyu ramen (I'm a wasabi junkie.) and Leo got his usual, Tori Ramen (I'm hoping I got the name right). Loved the texture of the noodles. Good portion for a hungry person. It's safe to say that this is my new favorite Japanese noodle place. Would I come back here again and damage my liver at the bar for the wait for the noodles? Yeah, probably. All in all, I had a great time. Thanks for making it happen, Leo!

In the NYC food scene, restaurants with reputations come in two forms: 1) those that truly care about the food, first and foremost, and 2) those that build a reputation around something other than their primary business of food. ÊIppudo falls in the second category. Why do people wait hours here? ÊI am honestly not sure. ÊThe restaurant does have a nice feel (once you can actually get past the bar), that I would liken to a lounge. ÊHowever, if you are waiting a long time for a table, you probably want to experience a great meal. For starters, we ordered pork-stuffed chicken wings and shrimp on potato chips, covered with a fish roe-mayo sauce. ÊAs a huge fan of meat stuffed with meat, I was really excited for the chicken wings. ÊUnfortunately, what we got was a fried, greasy mass of meat that was largely void of flavor beyond a taste of fat. ÊThe shrimp were okay, but a bit rubbery. ÊThe potato chips the shrimp topped were fine, and the roe sauce was the only saving grace to the otherwise lost dish. For main course I ordered the Shiromaru Hakata (Classic) ramen. ÊFor the fifteen bucks I paid, I was anticipating the best bowl of ramen in Manhattan. ÊThe delivery was another big letdown. ÊWhy do people rave about this ramen? ÊThe noodles were sort of rubbery and extremely thin. ÊWhile the broth was quite tasty, the portion size was small, the pieces of pork were extremely thin, and the other ingredients were also skimpy. ÊA restaurant that gained fame as a ramen joint should deliver a much better dish than this. I also got to try the Samurai Ribs that my fiancee ordered. ÊThe ribs were cooked well and the soy-based sauce was nice and flavorful, but the orange sauce that accompanied the ribs tasted like bitter, leftover pulp. ÊAlso of note, the ribs were really fatty...but, I can't fault fat on ribs too much. The bottom line is that I would have given the food here a solid three stars (definitely not worth the wait), but the prices and portion sizes definitely knocked this place down a star.

Best ramen place.. ever! I've been to Japan and back.. tried out several joints in NY too and found that this place has been my favorite. The noodles are so smooth, the soup so good... I gave it a 4 star for the crazy waiting times I always get. It's totally fine if it's with a huge group, since we can just go hang out somewhere. It really sucks when you're going there starving or if it's with a date.. It's usually really crowded even by the bar area.

Long wait? Yes. Worth it? Yes. Can you go elsewhere and be just as satisfied? Yes. This place is good. The Pork Buns alone will win you over. Ramen broth was delicious. I had the Akamaru Ramen. Tons of flavor without overdosing on salt. I've been to quite a few ramen shops during my time, and this place is a sure bet. Having that said, I am giving you a heads up: The wait is rediculous. It's as if they're giving something away for free. The hostess told me 1 hour, and we waited for more than an hour and a half. I'd say, for a fraction of the wait, go to Minca. The Ramen broth is just as good. The only downside is that you won't be able to eat Ippudo's heavenly pork buns. Those things are really out of this world... Solid 5.

I am not a ramen person. ÊI think ramen should come in packages and be spicy and be about a dollar to eat. Ê This place is the only place I would go back to for ramen. ÊThey just did something to it that made it delicious and so worth going back to. The only thing that makes this place less than my number 1 go to place in the village is the price and the line. Ê Pro Tip: They open an hour before they serve alcohol (or at least that is what they do on Sundays), so if you want a beer with your ramen, you have to get there at noon. Pro Tip: go on Sunday for lunch, right as they open. ÊNo lines.

Came here with my sister (Stefanie L) for lunch on a bachlorette weekend. ÊWe came about 15 minutes before they opened and were almost the first in line (e.g., we were seated immediately). ÊBy the time the place opened at 11am on a Sunday, it was full to bursting for the first seating. ÊLines = boring :: planning = good !! The pork belly bun things are good, but...nothing special? ÊAfter all the hype, I would have preferred a steamed char siu bao from Chinatown, to be honest. Ê I got the Karaka Miso Ramen. ÊIf you get a poached egg in your ramen and break the yolk and whisk everything around the broth becomes almost impossibly rich (almost too rich to drink - it almost feels like you need to chew the broth). ÊTo be honest, it might have been too much richness / fattiness for me on an empty stomach (this is coming from someone who doesn't bat an eye at 3 strips of farm bacon, 2 eggs over easy and a short stack -- normally). ÊI dunno how the super skinny hipster guys next to us managed to put away an extra helping of noodles. Ê Serving tea at the end of the meal is a nice touch to wash down all the fattiness coating one's esophegus. Ê The only negative thing I have to say is that it was almost $60 for the two of us...which is 3x more expensive than most ramen places. ÊSo was Ippudo 3x better than say Sapporo on W 49th? ÊAdd to it that you'll have a long wait at Ippudo most times and no wait at Sapporo most times? Ê On the whole, I don't think Ippudo lives up to the hype, but it was fun to try once, for a special treat.

Oh man, this place is delicious. For you ramen lovers, you'll love all the different ways to personalize your order. First of all, the place opens at 11:30 (we got there at 11:40) and was already packed. It is more of a fancy, high energy ramen restaurant than what I am use to. Like most places in new york, the interior is done well and the service was great. I got the akamaru modern with egg, spicy and mustard leaves. I love the big spoons they give you, helps you shovel all the delicious broth in your mouth! At the end, we finished off with dessert tea. The price is pretty reasonable, $14 for a bowl. In my case, it ended up being $20 because I had to get so many extras :)

I've heard great things about this place, so my boyfriend and I paid a visit here last month to try it out. We went on a weeknight, which of course resulted in about a 30-minute wait, but I would say the wait was worth it. Because of the number of people there at that time, we were seated by the bar, which gave us a direct view of the side of the kitchen that made everything other than ramen. Our waiter was a little slow in coming around to us, but again, the place was busy. We ordered the Hibata Buns with pork...mouth-gasmic. For ramen, he got the Shiromaru Hakata Classic and I got the Karaka Miso Ramen; both were delicious, especially mine, which came with some extra bakudan (spicy paste). I thought about getting an extra serving of noodles (kae-dama), but the first serving was surprisingly filling, so I decided against it. Overall, I'd say the wait (and the money) is worth the quality of the meal. I will be back!

If you don't want a 45 minute to 3 hour wait, come on a random weekday for lunch, 11am or 11:30am is your best bet.

Four hours of standing for an awesome sweaty, screaming-out-all-the-lyrics concert, we went for Ippudo for refreshments. (Because we wanted a beer at the concert hall but when we saw it cost 13 bucks- I said Hell no!) I had a lychee martini and my husband had a Samuri concoction. 15 minutes we were seated, drinks in hand, ordering ramen. I order Tonkotsu and hubby had the wasabi ramen. The broth was hearty; the deep meaty flavor was a synergistic explosion with each sip of the lychee drink. (Don't ask me how that works, I'm not a physicist).

Could the number 1 rated place in Yelp across the whole U.S. live up to the hype? Well Ippudo meets the hype the moment you bite into one of their pork buns filled with pork belly. ÊNot just any pork belly my friends, but pork belly that is so succulent and tasty that it must have been cut from the chuck norris of pigs. ÊOnce the ramen, in my case the Akamaru Modern, reaches the table and you take the first slurp, Ippudo will have reached the status of legendary.

ÊBut damn this place is all kinds of awesome... ...I came here for lunch with a party of 3 and was immediately seated. The ambience is stylish/modern/hip. When we were escorted to our dining table everyone in the kitchen greeted us very loudly in Japanese...it was like we were VIP's. On my friends recommendation we started with pork buns. THEY WERE AWESOME. Steamed buns with pork belly, lettuce, and their special sauce. I wish I could open up food carts in NYC selling this stuff...I'd probably make a killing. For ramen I ordered the Akamaru Modern, with an addition of pork belly and an extra egg. OK listen, growing up I had that cheap instant ramen all the effin' time. Little did I know what real ramen should taste like. ÊWOW. After having consumed this epic soup, I can honestly say I am now cursed. The curse of the Ippudo Ramen...never again can I enjoy ramen, let alone soup, from anywhere else. The secret miso paste really adds flavor. This soup is sooooo savory. ÊThen noodles are cooked perfectly. The pork belly addition is a game-changer! And the egg....the perfectly cooked egg with it's soft runny yolk. Ippudo has their $#!* on point. You gotta come here and see for yourself. ÊIt's ninja-approved!

Came here for the first time few years back. And only 2 times more after that. The wait time has gotten way too long! The ramen is amazing and I love the atmosphere and all the barking of the waiters LOL. I would definitely come more often (rather this place than the others on St. Mark's and its vicinity) if we get a table quicker. The bar is WAY too small to jam 30 people waiting on line.

I still think Momofuku Noodle House serves the best ramen in town and possibly in the country because David Chang provides a southern comfort sensibility to his ramen creations with pork belly and shredded shoulder. Surrender to your inner redneck and authenticity be damned. Ippudo's ramen, on the other hand, tastes much more Japanese and looks more like a bowl you would get at a higher-end noodle shop in the Ginza. It's not quite as satisfying, but the execution is pretty impressive nonetheless. Waiting for tables at the bar and on the sidewalk, the hipster clientele transfixed by their smartphones appear to agree if you can get their attention. Jamie W. and I waited about half an hour for a table last Saturday morning, which judging from the feedback from the preceding 27-hundred Yelpers, sounds like we scored quite a coup in terms of timing. Alas, we were seated at the kitchen counter where six stools were crowded together for the inevitable elbow jousting. Next to me, I kept feeling the snappish breeze of the giggly Asian twenty-something flipping her Farrah-like hair back for the benefit of her client... I mean her boyfriend. Regardless, we focused on the menu and ordered two appetizers. First was the $5 Tako Wasabi, which we were forewarned was purely raw (see photo). Bring it on. Fresh with a nice underlying kick due to the wasabi though the briny texture of the octopus didn't appeal much to Jamie. More unanimous praise came with the $8 Yamitsuki Goma Kyuri, a beautifully presented cucumber salad sprinkled on top with tobiko and sesame oil dressing (see photo). Very tasty although it struck both of us that the profit margin must be astronomical on this dish considering the ingredients involved. Finally the ramen. Jamie was lured by the daily special, the $15 Nakasu Kawabata Ramen, which consisted of soy-flavored ramen noodles with a chicken tonkatsu broth and topped with pork chashu, red-pickled ginger, cabbage, garlic, and scallions (see photo). It was an excellent combination of hearty flavors well worth the slurp, especially with the $2 addition of a seasoned salt-boiled egg (nitamago). Mine was even better, the $15 Akamaru Modern, which uses the original pork tonkatsu broth as the base and tops it off with their mini-meatball-shaped house miso paste (umami dama), pork chashu, cabbage, kikurage, scallions, and garlic oil. I took their advice and added not only the nitamago but also the $4 cuts of braised pork belly (kakuni) which brought the total up to $21 for a bowl of ramen albeit a fine-tasting one (see photo). Lazy bum that I am, I wished the belly was sliced rather than placed in the bowl as a mass. The ramen noodles had a nice al dente texture to them, although I have to admit I was surprised they were so thin compared to other housemade ramen I've had. No matter since the combination of savory flavors worked so well together. It's little wonder that Ippudo is such a popular chain back in Japan, and true to that aspect, the place was bustling with activity with all the sous chefs shouting "Irasshaimase!" in a typically boisterous fashion. For all the chaos and blaring music emanating from their Muzak, the service was quite courteous. FOOD - 4 stars...top-drawer albeit pricey ramen bowls with appetizers that provide the ideal complement AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...busy as a beehive, honey SERVICE - 4 stars...cordial despite the cacophony TOTAL - 4 stars...trendy, tasty ramen for the hipsters... and the rest of us, too

Fellow yelpers, you all did right by me. All the rants and rave over the modern, classic, and pork belly buns, well I could finally see why. The pork is absolutely made to perfection to suit each of these dishes. I also had the chicken wings, nothing really worth mentioning though. It reminded me a lot of General Tso's chicken. I really loved the atmosphere and decor of this place. Staff are all extremely attentive, friendly, and speak JAPANESE despite their mixed heritage. Awesome experience. By the way, great beer deal during happy hour.

I'm from California, so I've only heard of this place through myths and legends. I finally got out to NY and my friend took me here. Deliciousssss. We all got ramen, shared some pork buns, and shared some sake, all of which were ridiculously delicious. Although this may have been enhanced by the fact that we all had a fair amount of alcohol while waiting for our table. The only reason I have to give this place four stars is its really expensive for ramen and the long wait. Ramen should not cost over ten dollars... (it probably shouldnt even cost more than five dollars- its ramen!) Also, we had to wait a good two hours for a table, which I suppose speaks to ippudos popularity, but waiting two hours for food is never a good thing. Anyway, the food was delicious and this was one of the best things I ate in NY

Ippudo is definitely a must try here in NYC. It may be a bit pricey but well worth it. People wait hours just to eat here and it is always bound to be packed so make sure to get there early. It just may be the best ramen in NYC!

Almost 3 stars, Almost. What bumped another star up was the knowledge (or perhaps requirement?) that all the employees had for the Japanese language in terms of ramen restaurant terminology. ÊMaybe they hate it but to keep it consistent throughout the night is seriously a task and props to all of them. (Not all of them are Asian) The ramen itself was just okay for me. ÊIt may be one of the best in New York but I've tasted a lot of ramen that tasted similar to theirs back in Japan. ÊI was a bit sad that they didn't provide Togarashi, neggi (onion), or a ginger bowl so that we could add more spices and ingredients on our own. ÊThe broth was definitely great though--Hakata ramen is my favorite style and I was very content. Ê If Ippudo is considered the top ramen places of NYC I'm pretty curious to know how the other ramen joints in the city taste like... hmm :/

I'm not a big fan of japanese ramen, but their ramen was delicious. lot of flavor in the noodles and broth. but what won me over were the pork buns. an absolute must try! interior was also beautiful. i hate red and black interiors, but ippudo pulls it off nicely. wait time was only about 40 min. pretty short, given that we came smack in the middle of lunch time.

Upon walking in on a Sunday night, I was thoroughly turned off by two drunken Asian kids prancing around like they're in a club or something. The place was already packed with people waiting to be seated yet these two guys along with a somewhat sober girl were acting like idiots and I believe one of them looked like he wanted to puke. (I hope he puked on the girl wearing the ugly fur coat with Chanel bag) But anyway, I was glad the wait wasn't too long (30 mins), which is quite shocking. My friend and I got seated at a communal table and quite honestly, this is my second time coming here and I still can't justify why this place is so popular. It's loud, feels trashy, and food is nothing but unspectacular. I could barely hold a conversation with my friend because I felt ÊI was screaming my lungs out. ÊTheir ramen is mediocre and lacks ingredients to make it worth $15-$17 a bowl. Just two slices of char siu pork?? However, I actually prefer their pork buns over their ramen. We also ordered some octopus appetizer topped with green onions Êand it felt like chewing on plastic. No flavor whatsoever and it was $7...not worth it. Unfortunately, I have to say the best part was the crepe cake dessert but it doesn't matter because it was from Lady M, which is not their own made dessert. Sad to say this has become a 2 star experience for me.

This was my first meal upon arriving in NYC. I didn't get a chance to dine here last time I visited NY because it was July and I sweated buckets from walking couple blocks.

So, on my first trip to Ippudo, I was kind of bracing myself for a bad time: my girlfriend, who had been here before, swore up and down that it was overrated and busy and, as vegetarians, we were going to be kind of disappointed in what Ippudo had to offer. ÊBut our friends wanted to go here, so we sucked it up and hoped for the best. Ippudo, you charmer. ÊYou weren't bad at all! We got to the restaurant around 6:15pm, which is admittedly early for dinner, but if you walk past this place anytime after 7pm, there is a small nation's worth of people on the sidewalk waiting for a table. ÊWe attempted to beat the crowd and succeeded -- the five of us were seated immediately. ÊOur server was completely charming and made some awesome suggestions for dinner, but ultimately, we all got ramen, which is what we had come for. ÊI had the Wasabi Shoyu Ramen, the only vegetarian ramen on the menu, filled with nori, inari, spinach, and scallions. ÊIt was DELICIOUS. ÊSeriously, having been promised a mediocre meal and then receiving a really tasty one was a pleasant surprise. I liked the atmosphere and the open kitchen, although the place was already at a deafening level at just after 6pm, which makes me think that as the night goes on, you have to give up on conversation. ÊThankfully, there are noodles to be shoveling into your mouth, so who needs to talk? ÊWe were all pretty stuffed by the end of the meal, so no dessert or any other accompaniments, but I'd love to come back and try more of what Ippudo has to offer.

Ippudo NY is highly recommended by many of my foodie friends. I know it is a must try when I visit NYC. Knowing how crazy the wait could be, I got there bright and early before they open at 11am but there were already a fairly long line outside. The wait was about 30 minutes which wasn't too terrible. I knew I wanted their Shrionmaru Hakata Classic and Akamaru Modern ramen. Also ordered the Hirata Buns and Teba Gyoza appetizer while I wait for the ramen. The buns has a good light and fluffy texture. The meat was well seasoned and tasty. It was nice but unfortunately still no competition to the super juicy pork buns at Momofuku Ssam. The Teba Gyoza is really a stuffed chicken wings. Fried to perfection. Very crispy and tasty with very nice shoya sauce on the side. Their ramen broth is hands down the best I have had in US. It is out of this world amazing. I have tried numerous highly rated ramen places in SF and LA but there aren't anything even close to what Ippudo has to offer. The tonkotsu flavor is intense and milky. The flavor totally immerse your pallets and it was quite a treat. Very complex. The extra miso paste and garlic oil in the Akamaru Modern version enhanced the broth even more. It was amazing. I don't know if ramen broth can really get better than this. The noodle are the thin and firm Hakata style ramen. The texture is very good. The only place I have better is at Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi in LA. Shin-Sen-Gumi's noodle might be tiny bit better because it is fully customizable. It is a close competition though. The toppings, even with the extra kakuni and nitamgao, were pretty standard fare. Kakuni is tender but flavor is on the sweet side. Their standard pork loin chashu is lean and the meat is dry. Typical for Japanese Ramen but I was just too spoiled with higher quality meat at places like Santouka. With broth and noodle this great, I guess toppings are really optional. Just a basic bowl of ramen came out about $15. Definitely on the expensive side. It is worth it? You bet. I just can't find a place with ramen broth more addicting than Ippudo NY.

I'm know I'm just adding to a already well reviewed place, but I LOVE Ippudo! Everytime I'm in NYC, it is a must stop for me. The Pork Buns alone are worth the trip but the ramen, specifically the pork based ones is what keeps me coming back. I just wished they allowed take-out so that out of towners like me can bring home some of this yummi goodness! I've had pretty good luck with the wait times. Going at the end of the lunch shift before they shut down for dinner service is the best time for me! ONLY a 20-30 minute wait ;) Ippudo, I'll see you in November! Can't wait!

I can't believe I've been here countless times as a tourist as well as a local and havn't written a review for this place yet. Ê Obviously, with all these reviews, this place is an over-hyped Ramen joint in the east village. ÊOverhyped, but well deserved. With hype, comes a flock of people. Beware the long lines and it's really best to go at 11 am when it first opens. Come 30 minutes afterwards and be prepared to wait. ÊYea it's a long line but i dont understand people who give it 1 star and havn't tried the place. ÊDon't give this place a bad reputation just because of the line. This is usually the "go-to" place I take out of towners for Ramen because it is a good package: Êgood ambiance and overall, good ramen with an added extra of their awesome pork buns. Big groups tend to wait longer so coming in pairs is the best way to be seated quickly. Ippudo's broth is creamy and well seasoned. Also, this place has one of the BEST runny eggs in ramen; I have yet to find another ramen place that does this; usually it's overcooked and dried. Be sure to order their pork buns; it's melt in your mouth fatty pork. Oink Oink!! And of course, if you're really hungry, be sure to yell out "Ka-e-dama!" for a second helping of only 2 dollars extra (just save enough broth!) Is it the best Ramen out there? No, I think Totto is better. But, depending where you are and location, Ippudo is an ideal spot if you're going to be in the east village.

With so many solid ramen spots now scattered throughout Manhattan, Ippudo no longer boasts the crazy two-hour wait typical of years ago. At least, that's not what I experienced. When three girlfriends and I visited this Thursday, we waited just 30 minutes before being seated. But perhaps we got lucky. Though Ippudo is cheap for NYC, $14 to $16 for a bowl of ramen is not. This ramen, however, is worth every penny. The broths are flavorful and complex; far beyond the watered-down, simple taste of what you'd get from instant ramen. The noodles themselves are perfectly al dente, and the toppings - from eggs to spicy paste - offer a fun customization option that can greatly enhance your meal. Ippudo's appetizers are solid, too, and the pork buns are an absolute must! The spot itself is chic and cool, and surprisingly open. It's a cool little restaurant to bring out-of-towners to for a cheaper unique experience. Just be careful with the drinks, as it's the $10 cocktails that cause the bill to run up. If you want more noodles in your soup, don't forget to go Kae-dama. For $2, a waiter will bring you another heaping scoop and drop it in your broth (so make sure you don't drink too much of it). And don't forget to do like the Japanese and sluuuurp! It shows appreciation of the meal... and if the noise level at Ippudo was any indication, you better believe everyone there was more than content with their experience!

Yes you should go! Don't even think twice about it. I've been to NYC a few times just for this. The 2-hr wait is well worth it. Trust me, it is. You can always wait at the bar and order the famous pork buns and drinks. Then when your table is ready, you can just dive right into the savory ramen. You can't go wrong with any of the ramen bowls, so order away. Remember to get extra toppings, I usually like the soft-boiled egg and chashu pork. Extra noodle is also available. REMEMBER to finish all your food because you cannot take anything to go, and you will regret it if you leave some behind, even the broth, which I haven't had the chance to say that: it is a.m.a.z.i.n.g. Alright, writing this makes me want some right now. I can't wait for the day Ippudo opens in Boston.

Being Japanese I guess I could be bias. But Ippudo ramen was not real "tonkotsu" ramen. Yes the broth was good, but not creamy and rich enough. The toppings were okay but you don't usually put kikurage on ramen....The pork belly, had better. Not melt-in-your mouth pork belly unfortunately. But sure, I understand Japanese fusion style ramen. Fine. But the NOODLES!! COME ON!! Straight noodles?!!! RAMEN IS ALWAYS CRINKLY NOODLES!!! Not just straight noodles, that's like eating spaghetti in soup! That was a big fat no no. I've eaten alot of Ramens but I gotta give it to Daikokuya in LA, they have the best ramen in the US still. And who the heck charges $14 for a bowl of noodles?! Wayy over price. If you're ever in LA, go to Daikokuya. You can get delicious rich soup, crinkly noodle and oh-so damn good pork belly slices for abut $8 bucks.

If only I could figure out how to eat ramen without needing a bib and what they yell at me in Japanese when I enter, I would have a better experience here. I do love the vegetarian wasabi ramen, but I got to say, if there was another veggie option on the menu, I'd go there more often. And that would give them a lot of business because I work across the street. Maybe you could also charge me 4 bucks less for a bowl of what I could probably make at home?

It's a love-hate relationship with Ippudo. And I LOVE it. The Akamaru Modern was delicious..the broth is amazing and the flavored are fixed right... though I wouldn't pay 15$ for a bowl of ramen all the time but it's so worth it. You can ask for more noodles for 2$ more granted you still have enough broth (1/2 bowl). The meat just melted in your mouth with a perfect balance of meat to fat. And the noodles were actually separate (not stuck together) and tasted excellent. My friend ordered the pork buns which looked delicious and smelled delicious. Come EARLY. We tried going for dinner but the wait was 3hours..so we came the next day (11:15AM) and we still had to wait a bit (5minutes for a party of 8). The atmosphere is wonderful with bits of Japanese attenuating above the low dull roar of the open kitchen and crowds of people.

Everyone keeps saying this is the best ramen in NYC, so I had to see/taste for myself. We (party of five) decided to get there around 9pm on a Tuesday for a late dinner, and hopefully to avoid the long waits. Many of the people there waiting were party of twos and threes. Fortunately for us, there was a booth available and we were seated immediately! The staff was friendly; the restaurant was very trendy, but also very loud. The bathrooms, though, were pretty disgusting. But back to the food. Their pork belly buns IMO tasted a bit better than Momofuku. The Kaisen Bakuretsu Tofu was really tasty though and the right amount of spiciness. I had the Akamaru Modern ramen along with the boiled egg and braised pork belly. Must say the pork belly was really really good and the portions were good-sized. I liked the option of getting extra noodles at the end of your meal, but I was stuffed already. All in all, very good, but I have to ask myself if ramen for $20 is worth the potential long wait.

Love this place to bits, but hate waiting in the long line. If you want to try Ippudo very badly but don't want to wait on line, go on a weekday during their lunch hours or right when it opens up for dinner. Ippudo (originated from Japan) provides authentic Japanese ramen to its customers. The ramens and the hirata buns are to die for!! The ramens are so savory & fresh, and the pork soup is out of this world! Out of all the ramen places I have tried in NY, Ippudo is the best!

*ULTIMATE RAMEN EXPERIENCE* The hostess told us that the wait time would be 30 mins, but I felt like the line moved quicker than that. We were seated in no time. The staff enthusiastically greet each of their customers. This was very nice to hear the first 3 times. It started to get a bit annoying after awhile. The ambiance is great. I love the decor. It can get a bit tight in certain areas of the restaurant, but we had plenty of space around our dinning table. The servers were friendly, prompt and helpful. The couple sitting beside us weren't familiar with the menu and our server stood there for about 15 mins explaining everything to them (with a SMILE). My water cup was ALWAYS full. When our server forgot to place an order for one of our appetizers, he was so apologetic and courteous. We didn't care, we were too busy stuffing our faces anyways. But it's nice to know that the servers here are so in tune with their customers' needs. The food is to DIE FOR. I feel like it comes very close to the Ramen I've tasted in Japan. I would hope so, since they have about 43 Ippudo's in Japan. I definitely had a pork OVERLOAD here. Anthony Bourdain would have been proud of me. The broth and noodles are delicious. You can tell that the broth has taken many hours to prepare. The noodles are fresh and delicate. Complimentary tea at the end of the meal is a nice finish.

I've been reflecting on how to write a bangin' review for this place and its people, so I hope this reflects a true 5-star review. When I go to Japanese restaurants (Korean too, for that matter), the one thing I expect is a high level of service. I definitely got that with our server, Peter, who I was promptly informing regarding his good looks. Did I mention that I got one of their I(heart)Ramen tshirts? I'm gonna wear it and be a walking advertisement because I heart ramen. But of course, we can't forego any mention of the food here. I was really digging the hearty broths, and pork belly is delicious on top of pretty much anything here. Marbled fat on top of noodles can do no harm, no foul. Highly recommend the octopus app, as it comes with a nice salty horseradish kick. Pork buns are also really good here, as one of the folks I was wish was totally into it despite an aversion to pork. Like many others, my dish was the Akamaru, but I enjoyed my samples of others' too. Sharing is totally possible here, and I really appreciated the huge soup spoons so that we could do just that. Of course, this review wouldn't be complete without assuring you that yes, the house sake and wine are good, especially for the price (mid 30s for a bottle in a resto? Awesome). I can't wait to go back. My stomach is growling!

Dang, I'll keep this short because everyone has recommended the very best-- pork buns for your appetizer and Akamura ramen + egg + pork for your main course. This place was so good I seriously ate two dinners. I was at Pourhouse with some friends and got full from a burger, fries, and a beer. Then we headed over to Ippudo and I was just planning to join them. But once I got there and started seeing all of the food and reading various Yelp reviews, I couldn't help myself but order the pork buns + Akamura. Best choice I've ever made. Quick tip: just do it

ÊI mean, living in Houston, we don't have Japanese Ramen. ÊFor the fourth largest city in the nation, I'm surprised there isn't a single restaurant that offers it. ÊThe most gourmet you're gonna get is throwing an egg in your bowl of ramen you whip up at home. Ê We hop out of our cab and start scoping around for Ippudo. ÊWith no signage, more like a Japanese only signage, our eyes were darting around the block looking for it. ÊMy gf asked a random guy off the street if he knew where it was. ÊCoincidentally, he wore an Ippudo shirt Ê"I Heart Ramen"! ÊHe pointed us to the restaurant, and from that moment on, I have become enlightened to a whole new world of gourmet Ramen!!! Of course we run into a wait. ÊI didn't mine at the time, I was still full from dinner an hour earlier. ÊAbout 45minutes later we got seated. ÊWe were greeted with a loud "WELCOME" in japanese by the staff. ÊI like how they have several choices of broth for your Ramen. ÊI chose the Miso Ramen. Miso Ramen: Soybean paste and pork noodle soup topped with pork chashu, cabbage, spinach, bamboo shoots, fresh grated ginger, and scallions. ÊI also added a soft poached egg and a small bowl of porkbelly. ÊBoth were additional charges. ÊBut c'mon, how can you have Ramen w/o these two pieces of protein? The in house noodles were al dente and firm, not your regular bag of mama noodles. ÊThe dark brown broth was fragrant and umami. ÊThe pork belly was beautifully braised. ÊLike butta! ÊIt was perhaps the best bowl of noodles that I have ever had! ÊSo this is what real Ramen is all about! ÊThey also let you re-noodle (add another helping of noodles) if you have enough broth. ÊWhaaa?! ÊDamn, my button was about to pop. ÊI was so full! ÊWhy did I waste my time eating at Megu earlier that night!? ÊShould've went here in the first place. Ê Ever since that night, I have gone on a ramen craze in various ramen houses in L.A. ÊThere's one or two that really stands out. ÊHowever, Ippudo still reigns supreme. ÊBoth a blessing and a curse. ÊIppudo is so good that it ruins my experience at the other ramen shops. ÊNo other place does it for me. ÊIppudo's my gold standard. ÊThey'll always be in the back of my mind whenever I have a hot bowl of Ramen.

A lot of hype for the #1 restaurant in NYC. ÊWanna avoid the lines? ÊYou only need to get there about 12.3 mins before they open. ÊThey greet you lively when you walk in too but you can only assume they're saying nice things unless you speak Japanese. You must try the Hirata Buns with pork belly & spicy house sauce. ÊIt's just simply amazing and you will not be disappointed. ÊI waited too long to Yelp about this place because I cannot remember which ramen selection I engulfed. ÊBut I do remember adding in the boiled egg and the pork belly. ÊI'm telling you...the pork belly is EPIC. ÊYou'll want more! The boisterous greeting the staff gave every incoming party was getting old and quite annoying by the time we were ready to go. ÊIt's easy to see why they would have lines...they don't have much seating. ÊBut I guess we didn't really have to get there before opening because when we left, there still was no line yet. ÊI'm sure we wouldn't be so lucky on a Friday or Saturday night though.

So, I finally tried this place. ÊIt's regarded as one of the most popular yelp restaurants. ÊI believe it was Top 10 in 2010. ÊAnyways, I had their veggie ramen. ÊIt Êwas pretty outstanding. ÊProbably the best I've had in my life. ÊRemember, I can't speak for the other pork-based stuff. ÊMy friends had the non-veggie and they said it was okay. ÊI loved the veggie ramen. ÊMost ramen places don't sell veggie ramen since ramen is usually animal based.

I arrived here with a few of my business buddies at 4:45 to line up for a table. ÊBy 5:00, there were 20 people in line waiting to get in. ÊAs soon Êas we got in, we got seated at a cool table and took in the cool, trendy decor. The place feels like a lounge or club....dark with hip-hop music blaring loud. We started the meal by ordering the spring rolls, spicy tofu with seafood, pork buns and their famous ribs. ÊThe rolls and tofu were good.......but the ribs and pork buns were totally, insanely awesome! ÊThe ribs were honey glazed and sweet and the buns were spicy hot and yummy. After the last bites, I just wanted to eat more! For dinner, we had 2 modern ramen and 2 miso ramen with, pork, egg and pork belly. ÊBoth ramen bowls were just outstanding! ÊThe broth for both ramen bowls were just out of this world. For desert, we had the green tea creme brulee and the crepe cake. ÊThe green tea creme brulee came with green tea ice cream.......the strong flavors of the green tea were super tasty. ÊThe crepe cake was sweet, creamy and super delicious. We left wanting to eat more and we will return.....now I know why it takes 1 to 2 hours to wait for a table during peak hours.

Best Ramen in the city. Its better than Ramen I had in Asia. Holy crap its good. The chicken wings are also super tasty. Its been said before me, but, yea, I'm only giving it 4 stars because of the wait. They were more than happy to serve us apps at the bar (big plus.) I hope the bartenders are paid well because they were very entertaining, friendly, and engaged multiple groups at once. Go early or late and eat your heart out.

This is one of those rare restaurants in NYC where the hour and a half wait is truly, truly worth it. Grab a drink and some pork buns at the bar (the pork buns here are better than the ones a Momofuku), and the wait doesn't feel too bad at all. Once seated, I loved getting to sit and watch the chefs creating all of the food. Everything is so fresh and delicious. We got a couple of really good apps and the Akamaru Modern ramen that everyone raves about. I got mine with the soft-boiled egg, and my boyfriend got the pork. Both were soooo good, I literally keep craving this ramen! Next time, I would maybe split a ramen and get more apps because I couldn't get close to finishing the giant bowl of ramen. You MUST eat here!

Ippudo serves up soupy dreams made of deeply rich Tonkotsu broth, perfectly cooked noodles with just the right amount of bite, and succulent slices of fatty pork. I've had them all, and while they are all very good, the Classic is what takes my breath away and haunts me when I leave. We have our fair share of ramen joints in Vancouver, BC, but Ippudo's ruined me for life. I could go on and talk about the Pork Buns, Maguro Tataki, and Shrimp Mayo...but this review is starting to making me hungry and just a little bit sad, as according to Google maps I'm separated by 2978 miles from my dearly beloved noodles. *sob*

This place is good for classic ramen. The place was really crowded when we came in, I heard the hostess tell a guest for two it might be an hour and a half wait. I came in when it opened to make reservations for 7 at 6:30, arrived promptly at the reserved time, and was seated in less than 10 minutes. Akamaru modern has a fantastic deep broth flavor, the Kagashi Shoyu ramen was a little too salty for my taste. The regular pork was decent in tenderness and fat content. The braised pork belly was more tender and much much more fatty. Soft boiled egg was cooked well and the noodles, although thin to my liking, were good in texture and consistency. Pork buns were the highlight of the meal; fatty pork and interesting mayo sauce. Overall, welldone.

Two words: trendy and overpriced. If you're used to the traditional Japanese decor and ramen chefs from say, Daikokuya, you'll be scared straight by the trendy vibe and upscale haughtiness of the hostesses, leading you down a corridor that should be reserved only for the clubs that cost you an arm and a leg cover charge, and that's before they do the mandatory gun search and drink price rape. Or, you'll think it's awesome. Whatever. Trendiness is fine, but then you go ahead and look at the ramen prices and notice that a bowl starts (STARTS) at $15. Oh sure, they try to sell you on fancy toppings and interesting pictures, but ramen is ramen, people. It's a bowl of delicious, Japanese soup. All that could be forgiven if the bowl of ramen is mind-blowingly delicious. But alas, it's not. The broth is very good. The noodles were not. I got the classic tonkotsu, or in Ippudo terms, Shiromaru Hakata. As I said, the broth was delicious and delectably salty. The noodles were thin and limp, not at all worth the price tag. Wrong day? Maybe. Wrong price? Definitely.

If you show up about 20 minutes before they open and get in line, there probably won't be more than 7 or 8 parties in front of you and you'll be seated in the first round. Also, they'll all cheer for you when you walk in and after a while the novelty of having customers wears off I guess and the cheers become less spirited. You don't want to miss out. Get the pork buns - the chicken ones are alright too, but unless you don't eat pork you don't want to settle for alright. The Akamaru Modern (I think? this is from memory) is what I had - And while they absolutely, 100% nailed the broth, but the noodles were a little less substantial than I would have liked, and I guess I'm used to fattier, more flavorful tonkatsu. Neither of these things should turn you off to Ippudo, however. Also bear in mind that unless you're with a large group you'll probably be seated at a communal table; however as far as I can tell most of ippudos customers are decent, considerate people. I don't think it will be a problem for you.

I'm giving this place a 5 star based on their Pork Hirata Buns. Hands down this was one of the best pork asian buns I have ever have. I'm still thinking about it over a month later. Ship me a few of em yummy buns por favor. The Karaka men was good and had a great balance in flavor, but the price was a bit pricey for what is was. Maybe it's an NYC thing, but I don't think I could regularly pay $14 for a bowl of noodles with two slices of pork. I'm Vietnamese and am used to noodle bowls being filled to the top with delicious flavorful meat for $6-7 a bowl. Just saying... Service was good. I didn't expect a fine dining experience and got service like an other casual eatery. No more no less. I would definitely recommend this place for those incredible Pork Hirata Buns though.

Went on a thursday at 11:10am. ÊNo line, no wait, food came under 10 minutes after ordering. Lots of msg. ÊWas so thirsty afterwards. ÊI drank like a camel before, during and after the meal. ÊThis usually doesn't happen after a meal of ramen at different ramen joints around the city. Noodles are fresh. ÊBrooth is okay since it's masked with MSG and miso. Mordern noodles good. Classic is good but just boring. Not worth $15, $10...much better. Pork buns are good. ÊWish the bread was a little more firm so it doesn't stick to the roof of my mouth. ÊPork was moist and good though. Service was great. Ê Don't have high hopes when going, because your hopes might not be filled with these noodles in the end.

Imagine if you could take a blistering winter night spent snuggling with hot cocoa (with marshmallows) on a over stuffed couch with a down comforter, and package it into one bowl... it would be Ramen at Ippudo. The pork broth is to DIE for (may be a little too fatty for some, but hey, my philosophy is that if it aint fatty it aint good), and is the foundation to the heartyness and flavor of the whole bowl. I don't know how they make it, but the broth tastes like its been slow cooked in my grandma's kitchen since I woke up this morning. The flavor is really intense on its own but is the perfect balance when eaten together with the slightly more bland tasting ramen noodle. And the other ingrediants... oh man...the bamboo shoots are a perfect combination of soft yet crunchy and the yolk of the soft boiled eggs are just the right amount of gooey. The pork.. don't even get me started.. its so tender it feels like butter when you sink your teeth into it. Every single time I have come here I have waited over an hour to get a seat (for a table for 2), but since I obviously have a love affair with this place, its been worth it every single time. My friend and I have been on a ramen tour for over two years now, I've tried Manchenko-Tei, Totto Ramen, Momofuko, Terrakawa Ramen (#2 fav), Kambi Ramen, Rei Rei Ken... I thought maybe the less popular or more unknown places would have the better ramen. No. Ippudo is HANDS DOWN the best.

Pork buns, oh how I miss thee!!! I'm not a ramen lover so I really don't care about the ramen... meaning that I definitely don't go to Ippudo for the noodles.

If it wasn't for the wait, I'd give this place a 4. ÊThe food is good, the space is cool, but I know a ton of places where I can get the same quality for less and not wait half the evening. The service is punctual and friendly once you get seated and the ramen is delicious. ÊIf you're really craving some tasty Japanese food, slip the hostess a twenty and see if they can save two hours of your evening.

Although Ippudo already has more than 2500 ratings, I want my vote to count!! So it begins, I definitely have a love affair with Ippudo. Of all the ramen places in NYC, my favorite is Ippudo. Ahhh the Akamaru Ramen is to die for. Anyway I'm here to give you a small tip. If you are like me and don't stay in East Village, Cannot find friends to put you name down for you earlier, You are told "A table for 2? That will be in about 1.5 - 2hours" Here is a great suggestion on what you should do. Put your name down, then head to the AMC/Loew's cinema on 3rd avenue and 12th Street (One avenue and one street over from Ippudo) and watch a movie!! I did exactly that and 1 hour 50 minutes after the movie ended, I returned to be told "Thank you for your patience, your table is ready now. Follow me this way' P.S. We are no longer in a recession, Ippudo has increased prices. There is however, no inverse relationship between price and wait time. It remains constant.

WTF Guys... Was here the other night for a table of 7. We got there at 6:30 to wait, they wrote down the phone number wrong, which happens. I get it. But we sat waiting INSIDE at the bar, right in front of the hostess stand. Instead of yelling our table, they assumed we weren't there and gave away our table TWICE. UNBELIEVABLE! I love this place, i been here tons of times but thats just crazy. After complaining, we weren't offered a drink or a dessert or anything complimentary for waiting 2.5 hours instead of the 1hr we were quoted.

I am definitely a ramen person, and Ippudo's ramen is as good as it gets. The pros: -We ordered the Akamaru Ramen and the Karaka Miso Ramen. They were very different, but both were sooo yummy. Rich flavors, great spice, perfectly cooked noodles... i could go on and on... -The service... so fast, friendly, and efficient. The so-so: -We shared one order of pork buns... these were okay... tasty, but nothing special... however, if you like mayonnaise and fatty pork pieces, you'll love it anyway. -The price. A little steep for ramen in general, but sooooo worth it for THIS ramen. The cons: -The wait... over an hour for 2 person seating. Eat here... it is well worth the wait and the price

I had such a great time at Ippudo. Came after work, didn't have a long wait long, maybe 5 minutes, though the place was PACKED. Such a scene. And I'm sure it didn't hurt that that Sarah Jessica Parker was with her family in the booth next to us. I had the Akamura Modern. It was really good, salty but not too salty, and completely filling. What was really special though was the cucumber app I had before it. My goodness that was so tasty and... refreshing? However, it's pricey and there are so many other more affordable places to try, so I may only visit Ippudo again on a very special occassion (ie. someone else's dime).

My wife and I were extremely hungry - but decided to wait for 1 hour based Êon the reviews here on Yelp. ÊThis was our first time having ramen - so we didn't know what to expect. First and foremost - the service was awesome. ÊThe servers were extremely friendly and helpful. ÊEven though the place was packed to the brim, our waiter took the time to explain the different ramen choices to us. ÊHe didn't rush us at all. For an appetizer we ordered the pork Hirata Buns. ÊWe loved them. ÊThey have a spicy mayo/mustard sauce on them (which I guess is a Japanese thing) that is unforgettable. ÊDefinitely order these if you like chashu pork. ÊMy wife loved them because they reminded her of manapua from our trip to Hawaii. For dinner, Êmy wife ordered the Akamaru Modern with Nitamago. ÊDefinitely great ramen - but it lacked the flavor of my dish. I ordered the Karaka Miso Ramen with Nitamago. ÊDefinitely spicier (not too spicy), definitely more flavor. For dessert, we asked if they had some type of mochi ice cream - but unfortunately they don't. If you are in the city and are craving ramen - definitely stop at Ippudo - but be prepared to wait.

Message to all you New Yorkers.... You guys may have us Californians easily beat when it comes to pizza but you guys are getting the shaft when it comes to "good" ramen. Come to the bay area and you can get better ramen for about 5 bucks less! And some places in the bay don't charge for extra toppings. I had the miso ramen and it was good. I've never had bad ramen per say but I do prefer my noodles a bit thicker. The scoop of ginger just isn't necessary as well so I scooped most of that off. Also, where are the side dishes? I know authentic ramen houses don't serve kimchee but if you're charging me 14-15 bucks for just noodles, I think i'm entitled to some sides. Service was fine but paying 40 bucks for two bowls after tax is just ridiculous. I can pay a little more than 20 in Mountain View for the same amount and get better ramen.

Came for lunch with my friend. ÊIt was very loud and "upbeat". ÊDefinitely did not care for the loud exclamations when customers came in and such. Ê The ramen was very good, as expected. ÊGreat texture and the broths were very very well seasoned. Ê We had: Edamame with Yuzu salt - slightly undercooked (like, raw tasting, but still fun to eat) but the yuzu salt was like crack. Raw Baby Octopus - spicy/wasabi/shiso with some lemon. ÊTasty and crunchy bowl of octo. Ramens: Pork/chicken broth ramen with shiso leaf (wish there was more!) and bamboo shoots - Delicious broth. ÊTasty well seasoned pieces of pork. I also had some eel on broiled rice + a small salad for 3 dollars extra (set) Also ordered a 4 dollar side of Braised Pork Belly which was delicious but I think my grandma does it way better (more star anise spice, tenderness and intense soy flavor). ÊHah. My friend ordered the miso flavored broth ramen which was also very tasty. Did not order the pork buns because Pork Belly is like 1 dollar a pound and you can do it at home SO EASILY. Ê Buy a package of frozen steamed buns and steam it yourself, add your own condiments... cucumber, cilantro, julienne carrot, daikon, jicama, scallion, mint, hoisin, teriyaki blah blah blah lettuces lemon lime the list goes on... you can do it at home for 20 times cheaper. ÊI was sorely disappointed with David Chang's Noodle Bar Pork Buns so I have no desire to pay 9 - 10 dollars for 2 buns in any restaurant ever. Very good overall. ÊLot of solo-diners.

I'm sorry but I have to be the negative one here. Ippudo is overrated. For the price and the portion size, I've had much better in the Bay Area. I was excited too! I mean the decor is super modern and all the workers greet you the moment you walk in but... the food is really just mediocre. I believe I got the Miso Ramen set with Grilled Eel over rice. They use different ramen for different orders because my friends ordered a different ramen. We all agreed the miso ramen noodles were far better. The only thing I didn't like about the ramen was the huge scoop of ginger. We also tried the pork belly buns because of all the yelp rave. Ehh... Nothing special about it. Lunch for 3 ladies was probably about $60-70 and all we ordered was ramen for each of us and 1 order or pork belly to share. A bit over priced for ramen? Me thinks so!

Oh My Goodness. This place is gooooooooooood! There is a reason why this is the most reviewed place on yelp and maintains its high star rating. Went there with a group of 5 around 4:30ish. It was our first time at Ippudo and we were a little discouraged by the line to just get our name down. When we finally pushed our way to the front, the hostess said it will be a 2 hour wait but we did not have to stay in the restaurant and that she would call when our table was ready. Can you say, THANK YOU! So we wondered around the east village, our tummies grumbling for ramen, anticipating my phone to ring. 45 minutes later, Êmy phone rang and thanks to the ramen gods, a few parties did not show up and our table was waiting for us. We basically took down a few innocent samaritans on our way there. When we arrived, we were seated promptly in a huge booth that could have sat 10 people. Looking at the menu, I wanted everything but decided on the Modern ramen with a boiled egg and spicy sauce on the side. The boyfriend and I also split a steak appetizer on their seasonal list. The steak appetizer arrived first and was delicious, not to mention the great hidden gem on the plate, the potato salad. When my ramen arrived, I dove right in. OMG OMG OMG... the broth was so rich and almost buttery thanks to the pork. This broth was so good that I did not want it to leave me. The ramen noodles held its own with the creamy broth, the perfectly boiled egg absorbed all the good flavors, and the slices of pork, OHMG... just put this whole bowl of ramen over the top. We were all so happy eating our own personal ramen that the only sounds to be heard were the constant slurps and moaning mmmmmmms. BIG SHOUT OUT to our fabulous waitress. She checked up on us enough and definitely let us just live in the moment when it came to devouring out ramen. Ippudo, you hold a special place in my heart and forever will.

The bf LOVED this place the first time he came so he brought me here to be wowed by the ramen. Unfortunately, I don't think I'm the biggest fan simply because the value for money just ain't there. The pork buns were lovely and fatty. Steamed fluffy buns (Chinese, may I add) with one thick slice of essentially, BACON. The sauce made it fabulous. The cucumber - presentation was impeccable and I appreciate that the used a true Japanese cucumber (the long skinny sweeter kind). But BOY was it saaaalty. My tongue curled up into a ball and shriveled in the corner while I waited for my noodles to come. Chicken Ramen - The ONLY chicken ramen (I can't be bothered to look up the name) actually looked like pork when it came to the table. I asked for a poached egg for an extra $3, but my egg was pretty much fully cooked (sniff...I was dying for a LIIITTTLE bit of run in my yolk) Flavor was fine and noodles were chewy and delicious, but BOY the star of the dish was the freshly ground sesame seeds that you get to grind on top of your noodles. LOOK FOR THAT SESAME GRINDER and put those sesame's in your noodles. I'm not coming back for another bowl of $20 ramen noodles. It was good, but not THAT good. P.s. Get used to the "yelling" welcome that everyone gets when you walk through the door. You'll be hearing it a lot when you're there.

Yeah, you'll probably have to wait for a long time before you get to eat but when you do get to eat it's a bowl full of heaven. Caveats: I've never been to Japan. I've eaten a lot of different ramen in San Francisco but only Ippudo in NY. I'm a big fan of noodles and soup in general. Now that that's out of the way, ahem. Best. Ramen. Ever. Get the classic or the modern and only branch out if you come often. I recently visited NYC for the weekend and thought I'd branch out with the wasabi. It was wonderful but I had a sip of the modern broth my man was slurping and I got totally jealous. The tofu tartare app is also quite stunning, btw.

I visited this establishment a few months back and had a great experience....I loved the shishito peppers and pork buns were fantastic... I forgot what type of ramen I had but it was something tonkotsu ramen.. Ramen was very sollid as well but I think I prefer the shishito peppers adn porkbuns more. 4 Star for the NY location Yesterday, I visited the Hong Kong location because I was craving something brothy and wanted to see how it would compare to my NY experience. I was disappointed as they scale down the menu alot. They didnt have the shishito peppers and the pork buns were made differently... I understand that they catered to the Hong Kong population, but overall I thought the menu was weak compared to the NY location...Service was superb tho.. 3 star for Hong Kong location

AMAZING. Completely lives up to the hype. tips: 1. EAT THE PORK BUNS. They are obscenely good. I may want to eat them for the rest of my life. 2. Don't fret too much about which ramen dish to order. Everything is delicious, so it's really hard to make a poor decision. I really enjoyed the akamaru (in the classic broth, great rich and savory flavor) and karaka miso (thicker, spicy and gingery broth). 3. Order the nitamago (seasoned boiled egg) with your noodles. It's not cooked through completely, and it brings a classic ramen accompaniment to a higher level of deliciousness. 4. Come with a small group. Table seating is semi-communal, so 2 people is ideal. Less people = less time it takes for you to get your hands on amazing pork buns (see tip #1).

This is place is great but everything is too expensive. ÊI mean $15 for ramen, what the fcuk? ÊI arrived at the ramen noodle house around 5pm when it opens thus I didn't have to deal with lines. ÊApparently you maybe waiting anywhere from 1 to 4 hours in order to get into the restaurant during the weekend, which is not for me. ÊThe places decor was cool and I did enjoy the workers shutting out hello in Japanese when new customers entered the restaurant. Ê Also my water was always re-fulled which was nice. I had the Akamaru Modern ramen, which was good. Ê I ended up ordering extra noodles and I even drunk the broth, which I hardly ever do! ÊI tried a bunch of appetizers including; Hirata Buns, Ippudo Teba Gyoza and Samurai Rib. ÊThe ribs and the buns were amazing but the gyoza was the only thing that I didn't enjoy. ÊI didn't get it, they stuffed pork into a chicken legs but the favors just don't work together.

Pork buns: Amazing!!!!!!!!! Ramen: I love my classic Shin Ramen that I make at home for like a dollar. ÊThe ramen is good though, very CLEAN tasting. Ê Ê The projected wait time for me was around 2 hours, peak dinner time on friday night. ÊActual wait time? ÊLess than 1 hour. ÊThere are TONS of people who come in, put their name on the list, and leave/or miss when they are called. ÊThe hostesses are extremely efficient about just moving along on the list. ÊSo if you wait patiently by the table and are alert, you will probably be seated in 1/2 the projected wait time. The communal tables to me are just a little weird..but nothing to be freaked out about haha.

oh my. I used to like the ramen here a lot. As in, when I last tried it 3 years ago, I thought the noodles were perfect, the broth was good, but the meat unsatisfying. Now, the noodles are 'eh...' the broth is 'eh...' and the meat was gross. it crumbled in my mouth like powder. the porkbun was a tiny disappointment too. a friend recommended it to me as the best she tried. just go to momofuku instead, they're also slightly bigger there. they used to be pretty good though. what happened? the only thing left of it was the good, quick service and the complementary end-of-meal tea.

I was craving ramen and I've never even had "real" Ramen. ÊThis is the place to go--went during lunch on a Tuesday at 12:15 and only had to wait like 10 minutes (if that.)

A perfect balance! Let me tell you, out of my many visits to the city, I am glad to have tried Ippudo NY in Manhattan. It is PURE deliciousness. I got the Akamura Modern Ramen. Pho fails in comparison to this dish! The pork in the soup was perfect and tender. The broth was balanced and full of flavor. If you're in NY, definitely come here. Again, I kept this dish simple. You can ask for a side of the spicy sauce to add a little flavor, but don't pour it into the soup, like most people do. The smell from the soup is aromatic and is just the right portion to satisfy you but leaving you wanting for one more scoop. DEFINITELY, a highly recommended place. But, don't take my advice for it, just see for yourself with the 100+ people waiting around the entrance/bar for a 2-3 hour wait. Hint, call in advance.

Wow 2500 reviews.. what can one say that hasn't been? How about a practical how-to guide for users who have already committed to the adventure that is Ippudo? Ê Challenge nominally accepted. ÊThis guide is laid out into three seemingly logical sections. 1) What to do while you wait? 2) How to order [appetizers]? 3) How to order [ramen]? 1) What to do while you wait? a) Go to trader joe's wine shop a few blocks away and peruse the selection b) Get some kirin or yuzuski (yamazaki and yuzu sake) at the bar. ÊNote that you can order appetizers, e.g.shishito, edamame, pork buns c) Get dessert at one of the many really cool e-village options (dessert truck, chikalicious, spot) Just think of it as a s'amuse bouche since the one thing Ippudo doesn't do phenomenally is dessert 2) How to order [appetizers]? a) Get one of the cucumber, shishito, or spinach with mushrooms. ÊNow you're eating healthy and can order whatever else you want b) ÊAn item on the menu is called Hirata's buns. ÊThese buns normally compete toe-to-toe blindfolded with mono against momofuku's, but here's a tip. ÊHirata, you could say, is a living legend. ÊAsk the waitress where he is. ÊIf she points to behind the counter in the kitchen, just to the right of the bend in the counter, you must add one plus (1/2) * (number of people in your party over 2) orders of buns to however many you were going to get. ÊIf fish are available, you may substitute up to 1 fish bun over pork per person but no more. ÊWhat Êyou are about to experience is legendary c) Depending on whether you already had dessert, you may order the samaurai ribs and chicken wings, both of which are fantastic but quite heavy. ÊAlso messy, in a good way. ÊYou can play cat and mouse games with the waitstaff when they try to steal your dirty hand-towel (current record: 22 days) d) Whatever you do, do not fill up on appetizers. ÊThis would be FAIL. ÊV. important to save lots of room. 3) How to order [ramen]? a) If you haven't read 2, rewind b) Unless you have a medical condition preventing you from eating pork, do not get the vegetarian or chicken-only ramens. ÊIf you do, you are a cop-out, fake foodie, lame-o and must return this guide c) You have spent 2.5 hours waiting and have [nearly] read an entire guide. For you, then, there are really only 3 choices - the akamaru, shiromaru, or one of the specials (kasane-aji or kogashi-miso recently). ÊIf this is your first time or you have never had ramen in Japan, you should try the akamaru or the special. ÊIf you are used to eating Ramen in Japan, you will find the Shiromaru has a thicker, more traditional pork broth. ÊI am a big fan of this dish when Kasane is not in season. ÊIn either event, it is imperative that you get an extra nitamago or onsen tamago (I prefer the extra salt to go with my salty ramen). ÊIf you have a medical condition, split a nitamago with your friend. ÊThere is one coming in your soup anyway, so that extra half may help you kick the habit Ê(http://anse.rs/AllergyWIN) d) Before you finish all your broth, take a moment and remind yourself how long you waited. ÊThen decide whether you have the guts for a second helping of noodles to down your remaining broth. ÊIf yes, order kaedama to finish in style. On your way out, say Domo, oishikatta des. Also it is quite definite that this guide is the most comprehensive guide on ramen, japanese food, and things written, ever.

As a NYer, I didn't want to believe the hype. A ramen place with a huge wait, trendy Astor Place location, and over the top reputation? Couldn't be good. But at the risk of sending more people here, I have to report that, OMG, it is DOPE. Stopped in for a quick lunch, and it was the perfect experience. You are greeted in Japanese by everyone on the floor. All the servers are informative, polite, all smiles, make you feel welcome and amazing. The pork buns are ill as shit (which, btw, unless you're morally/religiously restricted, why would you EVER order the chicken?!!!). The ramen is authentic, amazing. The service is attentive, but unobstrusive. ÊThe non-Japanese waiters who obviously speak Japanese are the cutest. Question is, will I love it as much on a Friday night when it is full of drunken fools? I can't wait to find out!!

Woah. This experience is intense. The ramen is amazing. Absolutely amazing. That broth is magic. I had been told that you can often expect to wait an hour to sometimes two hours, so one cold day recently (yes, this is the coldest spring ever, which means soup season has been extended) I decided to go early. I had early evening plans near Union Square, so I had hoped to grab a bowl of ramen beforehand. When I got there, they had not even opened yet, and there was already a line. Once they opened the doors, we were ushered into the bar (not the ramen bar, but the drink bar) area. As each person/group went into the dining room, I heard shouting, not angry shouting, but cheering, and then I realized, it's that phrase that Japanese stores and some more traditional sushi places use to welcome customers, but this was that phrase times 1000. I felt like I was at a sumo match. The hostess tried to seat me at the ramen bar where about ten employees shouted every time someone walked in. She was nice enough to seat me at a communal table further back instead. It was still very loud, but better. But can I tell you, once my ramen arrived, I think I went deaf from brothy, porky goodness and no longer cared about the shouting which happened every five seconds. As soon as I finished the last strand and the last spoonful, I needed to get the check and get the eff out of there immediately. My verdict is that this is an awesome place if you're in a festive mood. Go with a bunch of friends. Order some sake. Maybe learn that Japanese phrase and shout along with the staff. That's what I intend to do next time.

Who woulda known there'd be a hipster ramen spot in the heart of NYC? Just kidding.. although it is pretty hip for what it is. ÊNice, dark interior... the servers are also easy on the eyes. ÊGood thing we came here on an off day.. even on Weds night we had about a 30 minute wait for 3. ÊThe place can be a bit pricey, but let me remind you that you are paying for the ambiance and overall experience I guess. ÊA bowl of ramen here will run you $15 which I guess is pretty normal since a regular bowl in the bay area will cost you about $9-10 or so. Ê We had the Akamaru Modern and the Karaka Miso Ramen, which was was the spicy ramen and definitely my favorite! ÊExtra egg will cost you $2 and bamboo shoots $3.. but its soooo worth it! ÊAnd of course we had to get an order of the steamed pork buns.... OMG SO GOOD! I almost wanted an order to go to bring back home.. but I probably would've eaten it all to myself. ÊWe also had an order of the duck over eggplant which I thought was really good as well. Writing this review made me crave some ramen and pork buns.. UGH!!

I initially thought it was a bit pricey for just ramen, but it's not just any ramen. I tried their Akamaru Modern & seriously, it was SO bomb. The texture of the noodle was incomparable to what you get at other ramen places/ramen you get from the market. The soup was flawless & I really liked the pork that was in soup :) I'm really sad I didn't try their pork buns, but I heard that those are freakin` good! There was a wait, but they had happy hour for beer at the bar (2 for price of 1), so that was pretty cool. Maybe I was lucky cuz the wait wasn't crazy like over 1 1/2 hr (I waited about 30-45 min) but yeah, even though it's good & all, I"m not sure if I'll wait THAT long to eat this. I would go back though~

I LOVE Ippudo!!! Hands down the best ramen I have ever had! How can you not love freshly made noodles?! When you go downstairs to the bathroom sometimes you can watch them make it.

The wait was over 1 hr for 2 people on a Sunday at 7pm. The food was good but not worth the wait. I did love the Hirata Pork Buns.

Finally after numerous attempts to visit Ippudo, I have succeeded. ÊI went to Ippudo on a Saturday as the first stop on my food crawl of East Village. ÊThe bf and I arrived before it opened and there was already a line. ÊGood thing we were fifth in line! ÊI was excited. ÊUnfortunately, we were two out of our party of six and had to wait for the entire party before being seated. ÊWe arrived at 10:30 am and were not seated until 12:00 pm, probably about 40 mins after our whole party arrived. Ê(Note for next time..pair off and eat in smaller groups). Ê The bartender was very nice and attentive to detail. ÊWhile we waited, we had a few drinks. ÊHe stood there and picked the seeds out of the lemon garnishes as he was cutting them. ÊI love that! The decor is super cute at the booths. ÊWe started off with the pork buns. ÊYummm, the pork was tasty, a bit salty but the mayo balanced it off. ÊI wish the lettuce was shredded though and there was a bit more fat on the pork. ÊNot as soft and tender as Momofuku. Ê We ordered the Tori Ramen and the Shiromaru Hakata Classic. ÊWe got an egg in both (whew $2.50 for an egg! ÊA bit scary that we actually paid for it..) ÊThe Classic had a more complex flavor with all the toppings on it. ÊThe Tori was initially more bland. ÊBut as I let it sit, the noodles soaked in the chicken and pork broth. ÊYumm. ÊThe pork was dry though. Ê Good experience overall, I'd definitely come back with a smaller party but not with an hour + wait.

I love Ippudo. The food's good, the workers're very energetic (they greet you everytime you come into the restaurant), knowledgeable and friendly, the place's clean trendy. I ordered the Akamaru Modern with extra pork belly and spicy sauce for your broth. The meat - chashu pork and pork belly are incredible, you guys must try it!!! I can't even describe the meat, it's tender and just so heavenly good. The broth's great; all the spices and ingredients fit in perfectly. The noodle could be better, I've had better noodle in other ramen restaurants. But then again, when you eat the noodle with the soup, it's still a pretty darn good combination. It's about 15 bucks per bowl and 2 bucks for refill on the noodles ONLY. That is why I suggest saving your soup or else eating the noodle by itself is kindda pointless lol. The portion isn't that big here and they're kindda skimpy with the meat and noodle. This is why I'd prefer the ramen in Cali better, they have bigger portion, better tasting noodle and cheaper. Regardless, my experience at Ippudo is still a great one. Is it worth the 2 hours and 15 minutes wait? Yeah it is.

I don't think any review could do this place justice because it's an indescribable experience, but I'll try my best to honor this place. I wish I could give it 10 stars! The first time I went to Ippudo I was overly excited with pent up anticipation from reading all the rave reviews from magazines to blogs to newspapers. I went with the Akamaru Modern. OH. EM. GEE. If there was a Ramen Heaven, this would be it. The triple reduced broth is so packed with flavor that it transforms the dish into something entirely nostalgic yet completely brand new. It comes with a poached egg and pork that are just as epic. I got an extra side of spicy paste/chili to add in and it made the heavenly bowl even better. My friends ordered the same and got the blood orange sorbet for dessert. WOW! It literally fizzes on your tongue and is so refreshing... perfect ending to an amazing meal. I left that night feeling buzzed -- literally -- from the food. I couldn't stop talking or thinking about the ramen, it was that incredible. For my second visit I went with my boyfriend and we got the pork buns to start. INSANE. Fluffy airy white buns that encase some incredibly barbecued pork with just the right amount of fat to give it that amped up rich sweet & spicy flavor. Best. Pork. Buns. EVER!!!!! For the rest of our meal we repeated from the above except this time we ordered an extra side of dry ramen for our leftover broth... awesome! It's like eating a different meal because the noodles are al dente since they are being freshly added so it slightly changes the taste.... so good. We discovered a neat trick. If you're having a beer and plan on ordering the sorbet, save a little bit for the sorbet because when you have the two together, it almost creates a really cool flavor and the beer brings out something different in the sorbet that I cannot explain. Try it and you won't be disappointed. We were shocked ourselves. The wait here is miserable and they won't seat you until your entire party is there. They gave my friend a hard time for joining our table 15 minutes after we had all sat down, but whatever. Tables are communal/cafeteria style unless you're able to get a large booth on the side (for 5-6 people). The staff yells/sings when you enter the dining area and it's pretty amusing. Prices are so cheap for what you are getting; I would easily pay a lot more money because the experience is worth it. I have had a lot of different ramen growing up, but this place takes the cake for sure. It's simply magical. Take your taste buds on a vacation here, they will love you forever!!!

I would have given this place a higher rating, but there were some things that we saw happen during our dinner that made me want to give it a lower star rating. The wait--- 1 hour for 2 people. We got to sit at the counter and watch the chefs prepare the orders. For me, I ordered the Karaka Miso Ramen with Onsen Tamago (poached egg). I was hoping that it would have a little bit more flavor, but it was a little bland and not quite spicy enough for me. It was decent though. I asked for more soy sauce and after putting it in, the soup was ok. Also, if you still have broth left in your bowl, you can ask for more noodles. The noodles are sooo GOOD!!!!! The reason why I'm giving this place a 2 star is because we were watching the chef cook the pork belly buns. He was in the middle of shaking the hot pan and I think he was trying to flip the pork pieces when one piece fell on the floor. We thought that he had picked it up and threw it away since it looked like he was washing his hands. As we continued watching, we were thinking he was washing is hands pretty thorough. Come to find out, he was washing the pork belly that had fallen on the floor and put it back in the pan. YES- that order was served! We were thinking about ordering the pork buns, but I'm glad we didn't. Then it got me thinking about how many other things that may have potentially fallen on the floor and if they just pick it up and continue cooking without throwing it away. For a more upscale restaurant that charges $15 and up for ramen, I would think that they would make sure that they don't reuse goods that have fallen on the floor. I would have to think twice about returning to this place in the future. If the incident didn't happen, I'd give this place a 4 star.

Got to update this. Went there recently and got there at 4:45 to try to get in the first seating for the 5pm opening for dinner on a Saturday. Got in. Service was so spot on, as it always has been, ambience very nice, the pork buns and pork rib appetizers were so good, and the sake recommendation excellent, that it is worth the price. Dinner for two with 2 bowls of ramen, 2 apps and a small bottle of good sake came to around 80 plus tip I think. It's worth it. Have had only had the ramen here a few times, but it is absolutely delicious porky goodness. A little pricey or would have been 5 stars. Definitely plan on going back to try more stuff but only during off hours like random weekday afternoons between 2-5 Êwhen you can get a table for one in about 5 minutes.

WOW! Ippudo probably has the best ramen that I have even had. I was very happy that we were able to get a table on my recent trip to New York. Friends in the past said that they waited 3 hrs to get a table. On this particular trip we were in the area and decided to try to get a table. When I tried to put our name down for 6 people. they said they would likely not be able to seat us that night. However, they took our names down and luckily within the hour we got a table. Service: The service was awesome. Everyone was very kinda and polite. The frequently checked on us and drinks were always full. Food: The ramen is very good. These were the lightest noodles I ever had. I ordered the special ramen with a side of pork belly. We also ordered some pork belly buns. Everything was delicious! Awesome ramen. Thus far the best place for ramen. I have also eaten at many ramen places in Los Angeles, including Orochon. Nothing compares to Ippudo. You must try it if you are in the New York area.

Good, quality ramen. But for being number one on yelp for ramen in NY? No. Much better ramen in CA and obviously Japan. I enjoyed it, no doubt, but I don't think it's the best NY has to offer. At least, I hope not. Get the pork buns though. Delish!

I came here to check out what this Ramen craze is all about. ÊI think i picked the trendiest spot to try Ramen. ÊI wasn't really expecting to pay $20bucks for ramen but it was my first 'ramen experience.' Ê I waited a bit to get a table but had the pork bun while waiting. ÊNow that was awesome!!! Very good pork bun very memorable! as for the Ramen; i got the #2 ramen and added pork belly. Ê I guess i was expecting more; but it didn't really do it for me. I'm no ramen connoisseur but it was avg. Êthe noodles are freshly made/ but I guess i was expecting a different kind of noodle. ÊI think i'd need to try more places to give it something to compare too.

Definitely a fan. Come early, like come when they open, seriously! I bet there are a bunch of people there already when they open. The lines are so long. But come at like.. 11:01. Akamaru ramen is the bomb. SO FRIGGING GOOD. My friend got the miso ramen, which has a lighter taste. Their ramen are thin but tastes so good. PORK BUNS! YUMMIEST LITTLE CREATURES. The buns are so soft, meat is so tender, they're irresistible! These pork buns are too good to be true. Great atmosphere, modern chic layout, and waiters are, lets say interesting to look at.

Bf and I have been going to Ippudo for awhile now. And we love it every time. Granted the wait is outrageous - but this never seems to deter us. We have a system - place our names in the queue then head over to a coffee shop, movie or pool hall to kill time. It always works out. I've brought family over when they were visiting and we've successfully converted them to the religion that is Ippudo noodles. The Hirata buns are pure organismic goodness. I switched over to pescetarianism about 5 months ago and I was overjoyed when a couple of times I went there and they had the Hirata fish buns. This is definitely our go-to place when we want some bomb-ass noodles. The wait is minor compared to the amazing food that awaits you.

Well, a little bit fancy for my tastes, but maybe that's just the NY way of doing good ramen. They have some good appetizers. ÊLike most places, it seems, it's a combination of izakaya and ramenya. ÊWhile most places seem to fall pretty flat trying to do both, Ippudo shines on both accounts. ÊThe buns were delicious. ÊThe seasoning in the buns was quite memorable, as opposed to just throwing in some hoisin and scallions. ÊAnd the crunchy asparagus pork maki (I had to just try this) was the tops. ÊCrunchy, but not overly breaded (so it didn't get soggy after 5 minutes like tempura), and balanced flavors. Oh, but the ramen. ÊI'm not a fan of the skinny noodles, but they stick to their hakata roots with the shiromaru: tonkotsu broth and thin noodles. ÊOne sip, and I put this place in my top 5 or 6 in this country. ÊThough, it was a tad bit salty for my taste. ÊThe akamaru adds some of their special miso, which adds some richness to the broth, but, surprisingly, wasn't quite as salty. ÊI'd probably get that next time. Oh, and this might be the best nitamago I've had in this country. ÊIt was a bit well done on the outside, but it was still slightly runny on the inside. ÊWhile I wouldn't give up tasty soup for a perfectly done egg, it adds the wow factor for me, since it shows they're willing to put in the extra work.

Ippudo NY, is one of those trendy places where hip New Yorkers go to get high quality Japanese ramen noodles. I have finally had the chance to make a trip and my takeaway is that Ippudo gets 4 stars for offering several flavors of ramen broth of varying complexities. The only downside of Ippudo is that among the party of 10, which I arrived with, some had thought that the broth was a bit salty. We arrived early, but without our entire party, so the waiters didn't seat us until our entire party had arrived. Service was prompt and as a first course, we tried the pork bun appetizer. Each pork bun had two slices of fatty pork - I think pork belly - lettuce leaves and a mayo dressing. The combination was excellent as the pork was braised in a low sodium soy. The pork also had a very porky flavor, that of which I didn't know how they accomplished. The bun was a Chinese style mantou, sliced hamburger style. It was light and fluffy and not dense. As for the ramen, I had the Shiromaru Hakata Classic, which contained two slices of pork loin, and most notably, a crunchy purplish seaweed. The broth was the most exciting park of the dish, extremely complex with a miso base. The scallions and garlic oil provided a deep, rich flavor. I ordered the Kae-dama, which were extra noodles for $2, well worth it for its size. The ramen were definitely interesting to taste. There were two types and each were paired with 7 different types of broth. Some in our party had yellow ramen while others had a more neutral beige, soba-like noodle. We were not given a choice of noodles, as I believe each noodle was made specifically to pair with a certain type of broth. I had the beige noodle and it tasted freshly made, but unfortunately there was nothing special about it. The yellow ramen was a bit better, but for some reason, it didn't have the firm, chewiness of yellow ramen I had at Terakawa, a favorite of mine near Gramercy Park. All in all, 4 stars are warranted for the excellent atmosphere, quick service and variety and high quality of broths. The prices I felt are a bit high, but a restaurant with a vaunted pedigree as Ippudo's can easily justify it. One final note, no takeout of any kind is allowed!

If I have to wait in line for more than 15 minute to eat at Ippudo NY.. I would have give them a 1 Star and if I have lousy services I would have give them 0 star! We arrived just 10 minutes before they opens at Ippudo NY on a rainy Monday for lunch, so we got seated right when the place open..so minimum wait! (Why would people wait for a hour or 2 to eat here??) Services here was wonderful!! One of the best service Ramen places I been to! Our waiter was patient, attentive and polite. As a lunch special fanatic of course I ordered Lunch D Shiromaru Hakata Classic ÊRamen & Eel with Rice with a spring salad ($14+$3) - both the salad and eel with rice was just standard... dare I say AYCE standard.. but for $3 I shouldn't expect too much!! - Shiromaru has this strong flavoured milky broth which has great meaty aroma.. unfortunately it was on the salty side...maybe just my personal preference - The Ramen itself was A-OK... chewy with great texture.. and I like how it have a great bite - But sadly the Chasu was one of the most pathetic toppings of Ramen I ever have... 2 thin pieces of pork loin which were so thin and lean and dry that can made any dieter cries... Hirata Buns ($9) - Pork Belly that is not too fatty... or soft or melt in your mouth tenderness is always disappointed - Spicy Sauce and lettuce didn't do anything to help to intense the flavour - I like the Momofuku's version a lot better... at least they looks better in my photo! Done that! Ate that! And with no regrets saying I won't be back for another bowl of Ippudo's Ramen soon....and no way I going to wait in line and pay close to $20 to eat one!!

My heart doesn't generally skip a beat for steamy bowls of noodles in broth, but Ippudo is pretty solid. I ordered the Modern ramen and added pork belly. All the pork with cooked very well. I could finish all my noodles and pork, but not all the broth, so the portion size is fair. We went on a Monday at 6:20pm, during the summer (read: no NYU), so the wait was 5-10 min. There is no way on earth I would ever wait 2 hours to come here. Sorry. I liked the decor, it seemed "cool", but not trendy. There is a giant "palm tree" made out of really long curved bamboo pieces that extends throughout most of one dining room. NOW. All that being said, the PORK BUNS were phenomenal. I could seriously eat 12 of them.

Upgrading my review because I saw that they receieved an "A" rating from the health department. Êgood job! As always, the wait was really long (1 hour) and the ramen was terrific. ÊAfter trying out a few spots, I've come to realize that there is a true difference between GOOD ramen and average ramen. ÊIn fact, after my first visit to Ippudo, I wasn't really impressed. ÊBut, after sampling some of the other ramen houses within the city, I now have a new appreciation for the quality and Êtaste of the ramen at Ipuddo. Ê(Pork Buns are still second to Momo, BTW) Not my favorite place to go, simply because of the wait. ÊBut, if you have the time- then you'll definitely have a great meal.

To be honest, I ventured to Ippudo mainly so I could write my review, to "put down my flag," so to speak, on a well-known, highly-heralded restaurant in New York City. And that is, pretty much, what I've come to tell you today. Because of all the advice from Yelpers, I decided to come right when it opened, at 11am, for lunch. Good choice -- we didn't have to wait a second! This restaurant does a good job making you feel like you can have a private moment in a large, open, loud space. The communal tables, even, feel not ridiculously tight, in part due to the chair design, which reminds me of a cube. (Trust me, you'll get it when you see it.) My friend and I went for the pork buns and the Akamaru Modern (original tonkotsu soup noodle with pork belly chashu, cabbage, kikurage, and scallions). It was dense but definitely damn good. (At $13, you'd better hope so!) Interestingly, both my friend and I felt that with each bite, the flavors and experience got better and better. There's really nothing to complain about regarding this visit, but I'm not falling on top of myself to get here again. Then again, for any foodie, it is a must. In the words of Eddie Izzard, "We stole countries with the cunning use of flags. Just sail around the world and stick a flag in." So, Ippudo, here's my flag!

The best ramen I've ever had. EVER. All of the ramens sound amazing, but I can't get away from the Modern. And their pork buns are out of control. In the great pork bun debate, I vote for Ippudo. Sorry Momofuku. Ê Definitely not the place for an intimate date, but the atmosphere is great. There are several larger tables/bars so you may be sitting next to people you don't know, and the hostesses, waiters and chefs yell all kinds of things at random, but I think that adds to the ambiance. The service has been friendly, attentive and quick every time. The wait can be intimidating, sometimes 2-3 hours, but it's worth it. Put your name in a couple of hours before you actually want to eat, wander around the East Village or go around the corner to Black and White Bar and get a couple of drinks. They are super nice and you can call back and check your status on the wait list. Seriously one of my favorite restaurants in the city.

Good alternative to Momofuku. Sorry - I'm a Momofuku slut. Cool decor! Went with 4 people and we were all happy happy at the end of our meals. We sat in the very back, like walk left - it was quiet. Also guess we had reservations because there were mad people waiting to be seated when we got there - like people on the sidewalk waiting. But we didn't wait. Definitely make a reservation.

Is NYC the haven for all things food? Probably. Is Ippudo the best Ramen I've ever had? Absolutely. Maybe it's because we don't have much choice (being in SoCal and all), so my sample size isn't as large as it could be. Regardless, Ippudo gave the impression that a clean/hip/small ramen house is required in every busy city. This is ramen that will melt you if you're not careful. It's served damn hot in a big ass bowl (just the way it should be.) You really can't go wrong with the Spicy Miso Ramen as it seemed like a well-deserved crowd favorite. This place is ~2900 miles from where I live and I can't wait to go back.

Finally made it to this place and I will say that all the previous reviews are on the money as far as their Ramen Soups go. I had the special Wasabi Ramen Soup....it was incredible...My wife had the Miso one and she loved it as well. I do have a couple of small negative things to say...for one the waiter was nice but a bit pushy. ÊWhen we ordered two Ramen soups because my daughter is only 8 and would share one with me or my wife, he kept insisting that we order one for her as well. ÊNow these are big portions and there is no way a small child could finish the whole thing. ÊThis bothered me a little. Now from reading some of the other reviews...I ordered the pork steak in ginger sausce. ÊI ofcourse asked the waiter what he thought and ofcourse I got the usual answer that it was his favorite..( for once I wish I could get an honest answer from a waiter...but will keep trying...LOL ). I must say I will never order that dish again...the pork had no taste and very fatty. We also ordered the the Tuna and the buns...The buns are excellent..the tuna was very good. As far as my rating goes...The Ramen Soups get 5 stars...but the place is very pricey...For two soups and three appetizers the bill was over $100 dollars. If you are in the mood for excellent soup this place rocks...if you order other things prepare to pay up.

When I was in NYC last year I got together with several friends and we we're sharing our respective food destinations for the weekend. ÊMany of them were set on checking out this ramen place called Ippudo in the East Village and I thought 'hmm, its not like I don't get enough good ramen in LA, I think I'll pass.' ÊAfter returning home I started hearing 'Ippudo' come up in conversation among my LA friends repeatedly and well spoken too, even among fellow ramen lovers. ÊEven one of my close friends who grew up in Tokyo told me she has to get a bowl of Ippudo every time she's in NY. ÊHmm... Fast foward to 2011, I was back in the city again with a few friends and we made it top on our list of places to try. ÊCatching an early flight in the morning we made our way straight to the E Village in the morning hrs waiting for the shop to open with a line of hungry lunch goers already growing. Ippudo is a well known chain in Japan with over 40 locations, starting in Fukuoka and while most ramen shops in the motherland are tiny little mom & pop establishments, Ippudo's flagship NY restaurant takes on a decidedly more upscale and hip look fitting of the NYC dining scene. ÊDark and lavish interior finish belies the somewhat humble and traditional looking front. ÊAlso reflecting the upscale interior and premium E Village real estate are the prices. ÊBowls of ramen run $15-16 which I'll be frank, is a bit steep, but once lunch was served, I quickly put the prices out of my mind. Ippudo's menu not only consists of ramen, but many in house specialities that look equally appealing like japanese style roasted duck, grilled black cod and berkshire pork loin. ÊBut this was our first time and we wouldn't be distracted by other such delectables. Starting off with some appetizers we got: Tako wasabi ($5) - Raw diced baby octopus seasoned in wasabi sauce, was a great starter that wasn't overly chewy and had a light bite with the wasabi and vinegar. Teba gyoza ($10) - A japanese take on a taiwanese specialty, these chicken wings are stuffed with ground pork and vegetables, then deep fried and served with a vinegar shoyu sauce. ÊImagine having a gyoza that's a chicken wing at the same time. ÊYes you can't pass it up. Ramen: Shiromara Hakata Classic ($15) - I've been a fan of Kansai region hakata style ramen since my introduction to Shinsengumi in LA, and while I'm far from an expert, this classic pork broth ramen brought back that same feel and consistency. ÊWhile I can't customize the broth or noodle firmness like they do at Shinsengumi, frankly I didn't have to, everything came out...just right. Akamaru Modern ($15) - The same 'tonkotsu' broth as the hakata classic with a topping of spicy umami miso paste and accented with garlic oil. ÊBetween either the classic or this, you cannot go wrong with either choice. ÊLucky for me my friend ordered this one so I got to sample as well. Kakara Miso Ramen ($16) - For something on the spicier side of life, this miso based ramen definitely ups the hot factor, offset slightly by the healthy dollop of fresh grated ginger. ÊA great choice for someone looking for a little more fire in their noodle soup. Ê Overall, yes, $15 is a bit much for ramen but once I started eating, I had one of those rare moments where the background lights and noise dim out in the movies and it was just me and the soup, enjoyed in the silence of my head. ÊI don't get moved very easily any more when I eat and this was one of those rare moments. ÊHence it earns the 5 stars.

Yum!!!! The pork buns were to die for. Porky, pillowy goodness. The duck appetizer was inhaled by our group. Quack quack. Perfect. The spicy miso broth ramen was so intensely good. The broth is too good for words. The service was impeccable for us. They kept it moving and removed things as soon as you were finished, but did not make you feel rushed. Got refills on our Kirin pints just when we needed them. Well worth waiting for.

The Ramen Series The Situation: It was a dark and semi-stormy night. I was getting over the shame of indulging in American under a $1 instant ramen and had been been craving real ramen from a recent real ramen experience. [See the other Ramen review set to post this week.] I had experience an art epiphany and tapas wasn't going to cut it. With a friend willing to indulge my ramen raving and waiting in the rain onward we went to Ippudo. The Scene: I was drawn to all the Yelp reviews to try this place out and was willing to brave the NYU crowd..and by crowd, that was quite literal. A friend had recently taught me to check out everyting about a restaurant and although the bar area made me feel like I was sacrificing personal space, the dining area had one of the best layouts I've ever seen. The open kitchen was attractive and decor coupled nicely with the walls and ceiling. My friend and i sat in front of the mirror/driftwood display which may sound odd, but was strangely soothing. I vowed to come back with a group to score one of the tables with the funky wall decor. The Staff & Such: Great staff that didn't lie about the crazy wait. There is Japanese yelling involved that reminded me of the Karate Kid movie..although I couldn't discern if it was a welcome yell to the patrons, the bowls of ramen or both. Food: Amazing food. Just the right portion size, although if you wanted the "more noodle option" for an extra $2 that could be indulged. Alcohol: I went traditional with the sake, which was aptly recommended by our waiter. The Threads:One of the good things about an NYU crowd is that you can pretty much wear what you want. Definitely coming back to this spot on a not so rainy night with a group of peeps.

After waiting for two hours to get a reservation here (call in ahead of time to get reservation), I was on the verge of tears as I was certain we wouldn't get a decent table here, but we did, and relief washed over me in an awesome way. The ambiance, costumers, and employees were lively, and chatter filled the room. This place is known for its noodles, and if that's what you are coming here for, you won't be disappointed (at least not too much). The noodles were good, but they were certainly not the best (the reason it's not 5 stars, and the service which I will get to), but overall, it was a good experience. There is a small bar there too, but I don't like where it's situated. The service was okay, but not great. Okay, I was trying to sugarcoat it, the service was terrible. Our waitress barely paid any attention to us. In fact, she didn't even stop by after we got our food to ask us how our food was, and if there was anything else that we needed. Now I know, she probably was busy, or maybe had a bad day, but is it hard to stop by once? I mean, she did only pass by our table 3 or 4 times. Did we really wait 2 hours for this service!? Beside the service, this was a good experience, and I would probably go here again if I want some noodles. I also tried their Japanese beer "Ginga Kogen Beer", which was a unfiltered wheat beer; it was very good.

Dang, the 2 hour wait on a Saturday night was totally worth it. Luckily we had some popcorn during the movie, so we weren't very hungry when we put our name down. We actually had time to grab a drink at another bar too. We sat down and ordered the cucumber appetizer and pork belly bun, which we devoured almost immediately. The cucumber is just soaked in sesame oil with red pepper flakes and sesame seeds sprinkled on top. It was very refreshing and crunchy. The pork belly buns were delicious. The fat was absorbed by the bun they use for peking ducks. The waitresses were nice and suggested good items on the menu. We got a flowery sake for the table and enjoyed it with our meal. For ramen, we got the Miso and Akamaru with Nitamago in each. The Miso soup was cloudy with the miso and it worked well with the al dente ramen and pork slice. At the end, I did need to drink some water to wash down the miso in my throat. I'm not a big fan of the lump of ginger, but half of the ginger mixed into the soup complimented the soup well.The Akamaru had an aromatic soup, which I like more. It was soothing. A friend got the Bakuretsu Tofu, which stayed hot in temperature during the rest of the dinner. It reminded me of soondubu, except with a sweetness to it.

Best food experience I've had in the city. Hands. Down. There was not a single item I had that I did not think was in my top foods in this lifetime. We had the pork buns as the first appetizer. No need to elaborate. Tender yet not mushy. Flavorful. Wrapped in soft white pillows. That would be my ode to the Ippudo pork buns. Then the Japanese style barbecue ribs came out. I didn't think something could top the previous dish, but this did. Literally falling off the bone. Succulent. Juicy. Tender. Melt-In-Your-Mouth. Fall-In-Love-At-First-Bite. Eating Partner deemed this as his #1 of the whole weekend. When our ramen came, I was already full, but I could not stop myself from finishing my entire bowl once it was placed in front of me. I ordered the special, which I thought was the best of the three ramens we had ordered. Eating Partner and Host got the first two basics, which I thought had a less balanced and less intricate blend of flavors than mine. Eating Partner also saved his soup and got an extra serving of noodles for a measly $2 extra. Our experience here left us on Cloud 9. I am coming back here first from now on. Absolute LOVE. *Beware that for dinnertime on weekends, the wait averages to be about two hours. *When you first walk into the dining area, people will scream at you in welcome. Please do not be alarmed. The Ippudo culture seems to involve a lot of screaming.

Came here on a whim Saturday afternoon around 3. We thought we were going to be late enough to miss the lunch goers and early enough before dinner rush. We were very wrong; it was packed. The hostess said it would be an hour to an hour and a half wait. My bf had parked right outside Ippudo so we decided not to waste an awesome parking spot. Walking around and shopping made the time pass a lot quicker. When we got back, we were seated within minutes. We had the Hirata pork buns which were very tender and the lettuce actually made it a bit more refreshing than Momofuku Ssam's pork buns, although I did feel they had a bit much of Hoisin in there which overpowered the pork belly. For the ramen, we ordered the Akamaru Modern and Karaka Miso ramen. I absolutely love the Akamaru ramen! The broth is very deep and flavorful and had a great balanced flavor. Karaka Miso... eh, not so much. There was so much grated ginger in there. If you like ginger, you'll like this. Sadly, I'm not one of those people. For dessert, we ordered the Matcha Brulee. It was okay, very green tea tasting. It tastes exactly like what you would think it tastes like, texture and all. Would I come back? Probably. But not if I had to wait over an hour to eat. And honestly, there's not really that much shopping around the area, so much as more food places (I was very tempted to buy some gelato and sandwiches and Pommes Frites).

I don't need to comment on the ramen. We already know it's delicious! Its definitely the pricier side though. I'd like to shed some light on the other dishes as well. Had the Kurobuta Steak (its actually a pork steak, not beef) and it was fabulous as well. Aside from the long wait, service was fantastic. Courteous and attentive staff. I can't wait to come back!

Like tons of other restaurants in this ridiculous city, Ippudo is a must-try-at-least-once-while-you're-here type place. At 6:00 on a Wednesday night, there was already an hour wait. At 1:00 on a Sunday afternoon, there was an hour wait. So is it worth sitting/standing in that cramped lobby for a bowl of noodles? Well, with enough advanced planning, you can definitely make it worth it. Here's how: 1. Put your name on the list. Find out how long the wait is. If it's over 45 minutes... 2. Walk about 5 minutes to Pommes Frites, another New York City must. Stave off your hunger with some double-fried Belgian fries and sauce. 3. Get back to Ippudo at least 15 minutes prior to your estimated seating time. 4. Kindly ask the hostess to check where you are on the list. 5. Be seated. 6. EAT RAMEN. The ramen here is pretty inventive, and the broths are complex. People complain that it isn't all that, but really, it's broth and noodles - I think Ippudo does plenty with this dish to make it worth trying. Also worth trying is their pork buns - better IMO than David Chang's.

I had hope this place was going to live up to its four stars rating by two thousand reviewers... and thank goodness it did =) We walked in at the prime time of dinner with a lobby full of people and we had a feeling it was going to be a long wait...so when the hostess said "It'll be 10 minutes," I had to repeat what she said because I was sure I must have heard her wrong. Sure enough, it wasn't even 10 minutes, we were being led through a dimly lit, modern decor dinning area, with an open kitchen on one side of the wall. We were seated at a long length table, shared with other guests. Even though the restaurant was busy, our waitress promptly presented herself and we were given menus. I ordered the Hirata Buns (as suggested by our waitress for first time guest) and Akamaru Modern. The Hirata Buns tasted like a Chinese Gua Bao, with a bit of kick. It was pretty good. The Akamaru Modern was served with a medium firm ramen, in a flavorful broth. Was it the best ramen I ever had? No. But it wasn't bad either. THREE STARS for the food. What I really like about this place is their excellent service. Our waitress was very attentive. During our meal, she came by multiple times to make sure everything was good. At one point, she came by suggesting that it was best to eat the buns while it was hot (when it gets cold, the bun becomes hard). FOUR STARS for service. Ps. For quicker seating, come either by yourself or in a party of two.

I went at 6:30p whch is still before the usual NYC 7:30p dinner peak & was seated within 10 minutes though there's almost always a wait which I suspect is something they purposefully engineered Shake Shack-style to generate priceless buzz. Nonetheless, to keep it brief as 2980+ other reviews have already reviewed this place to death, Ippudo deserves a full 5-stars as its consistently & repeatedly delivering perfect, perfect, perfect ramen no matter the dish is true to the high esteem and art which the Japanese give ramen. And I mean real ramen, not the instant stuff which is nowhere near this place's high art. I forget which appetizer I got but despite having eaten at countless Japanese restaurants, the quality here makes it particularly memorable, all at a normal price point. Need you know more? Go!

I haven't seen my friend Moline in over 10 years where she's been chilling in NYC for a while. ÊSo I let her choose the restaurant for us to meet and eat and she gave me a list of places. ÊI chose this one as she hadn't eaten here yet. 3 1/2. ÊWe got here Wednesday afternoon at 14:30 and there wasn't ayn issue getting seats. ÊWe were seated right by the entrance to the kitchen and given the lunch menu. ÊI was a little caught-off guard at the prices. ÊRamen bowls were $14! ÊWow, that's really expensive. ÊOK, so we're in the Village but still, that's expensive. Ê$17 if you got the bowl as a "set" which meant getting a salad and some rice on the side with it. ÊWe were both ready for some sake but saw the cheapest sake was $9. ÊThat's for 1 cup. ÊYeah, we passed on the sake. ÊAnd I ordered the pork bun appetizer as everyone says they're really good. We didn't wait long for our appetizer to get to us. ÊThey really are good. ÊPork was a little fatty which gave it some great taste and the buns are sweet that mixed well with the pork. ÊI was impressed. ÊOur ramen took a little while but finally came. ÊIt's really good. ÊI ordered the Wasabi Shoyu Ramen and it's barely spicy to me. ÊBut the wasabi infused broth gives it a really unique taste compared to other ramen soups I've had. ÊI decided to ask for kae-dama which means another order of just noodles to add to my remaining broth. Ê So the ramen here is really good but not great. ÊWhy? ÊBowls are fixed. ÊIt didn't seem like you could mix and match different broths with different ingredients and the broths were also fixed. ÊI've been to ramen shops where you could vary both depending on your tastes. ÊNot that I count this as a complete strike against this place-I really don't. ÊWhat do I count as a complete strike? ÊWhy didn't this place get 4 stars or higher? ÊYou've just read what Moline and I ordered. ÊThe bill? Ê$42. Ê$50 with tip. ÊIs that reasonable for lunch for two people eating ramen noodles? ÊNo, no it's not. ÊSo on taste alone I gave this place a 3 1/2 stars but I wouldn't ever come back here. ÊThere are plenty of other ramen shops in NYC that taste just as good-maybe even better, for a lot less price.

Get in Line! I got there 30 minutes after they opened and there was a 25 minute wait. With that said this is the best Noodle bar I have EVER eaten at. My mouth is watering just writing this review. The noodles are as fresh as you can get, you can watch them making them because it's an open kitchen and it's the focal point of the larger room. The staff is amazing, fast, fun, and friendly. Ask questions if your a first timer - there are so many items to choose from it can be overwhelming. No matter what you choose stay seated cause your about to dig in to some serious flavor. They say on the menu that you can request more noodles if you run out but I just don't see even a Sumo wrestler needing more. Enjoy and make sure you take the time to wait in line, it's worth IT!

Amazing. The very best ramen in NYC. The soup portions are large so you will leave with a full belly even without ordering an appetizer and dessert, and if you eat all your noodles too quickly just alert your server and they will bring you more. However, the appetizers and whatever specials they're offering have always been great so they're worth trying if you have the stomach space. If you're a meat eater, definitely have the Pork Buns and Akamuru Modern ramen and you'll be in heaven. If you're a vegetarian, try the Shishito (flash-fried Japanese peppers with yuzu salt) and order the Wasabi Shoyu Ramen, also the only vegetarian ramen on the menu BUT ask to have ramen noodles instead of the noodles that come with it. (It comes with these thicker, chewier noodles which do nothing for the soup except ruin the "ramen" experience if you're craving ramen). Ê The first time I ordered the Wasabi Shoyu Ramen it came with the thicker noodles and I was VERY disappointed because I thought I was getting ramen like everyone else (the menu doesn't inform you). I almost didn't want to go back but decided to give them a second chance since the broth was so good. The next time I ordered it and specified I wanted it with "Ramen" noodles instead, and wow...now I knew why everyone raves about this place. Lol. It was a fantastic meal and I got my Ramen fix. ;) *Add the toppings for any ramen you order if you like them because they really add to the meal. The only negative is the bar menu is very limited versus the restaurant alcohol menu. Sure, the bar menu has a good beer and sake selection but the restaurant menu has some nice exotic cocktails like the Shochu with freshly squeezed grapefruit juice. So I wish I could order cocktails while at the bar since cocktails don't pair well with a huge hot bowl of ramen. (Beer and sake are much better paired with ramen, which is why I never order cocktails here anymore). Please add the cocktails to the bar menu since they're useless only on the restaurant menu. I'm not removing a star, but I'm offering a very strong suggestion to the manager to do this so customers can enjoy an exotic cocktail while waiting at the bar - perfect way to pass the long wait time. *Note: soups are $15 per, but you're on yelp, you see the price tag, so don't act surprised and then complain on yelp it was expensive. You'll pay more for Italian pasta, but not for the best ramen in the very expensive NYC? If it's a problem, you can buy instant ramen for $1 at a corner store and spare us the whining.

I am fairly certain I am not adding anything new to the all the reviews below, but Ippudo has the BEST ramen in NYC and is really worth the wait. Depending on when you go, be prepared for a 30 min wait (if you go at 5pm on a Saturday night...if you're lucky) or brace for a 1.5 hr wait. Suck it up and grab a drink somewhere and come back. The bar area gets super congested. I highly recommend the Akamaru Modern ($15). I like the broth with an extra kick. If you like your broth creamy, order the classic ramen. Add the pork belly ($4) and preserved salty egg ($2) as toppings. Portions are large but it has never stopped me from devouring the entire thing in less than 10 mins. You MUST order the pork buns as appetizers (each order comes with 2). Melt in your mouth good!! I am still trying to figure out what's in that special spicy mayo sauce. Service is fantastic and super efficient.

Okay... so I had to try this restaurant everyone was mentioning that had to do with Ramen. To me ramen comes in a plastic wrapper and is bought in bulk. I have been to this restaurant 2 times in two weeks. -The classic ramen was good. -The chicken wing with dumpling filling was not very good. I don't even see it on the menu anymore. -The hirata pork buns were the star of the show. I think they are better than the Momofuku pork buns. I also tried the karaka which had lots of ginger in it. It was supposed to be spicy but it wasn't too spicy. I liked it. Go for lunch and go early....put your name in then sit at the bar and have a drink.

Ippu-DOH - The DOH is for the damn 2 hr wait to eat a bowl of Ramen during peak times (4pm - 8pm), or basically FRI, SAT, SUN. Really? Shesh. The best time to go where you don't have to wait at all is basically during lunch time around 12 to 1pm during weekdays. You'll be whisked right away to the Japanese Fantasy Ramen land. The Decor is definitely cool hip, Japanese zen modern. Nothing like a dead fake tree in the middle of restaurant to keep the atmosphere trendy. :) The service keeps it lively and friendly there - Japanese style! expect everyone to be yelling Irasshaimase as you walk past them! To be honest, I'm not the biggest fan of Ramen. If Noodles were my craving, I'd go for Pure Thai Shophouse... its much more flavorful! Anyhoo - I usually go for the Akamaru Modern - but to tell you the truth like they essentially all taste the same with only slight variation but then again my taste palette has not evolved since the Ice Age. What is amazing is the PORK BUNS - i generally just skip the ramen when I go there with out of towners and just order two sets of Pork Bun and call it a lunch. Soft fluffy bun with slightly chargrilled with "special" Ippudo sauce, don't question what the special sauce is made out of... after all it is a Japanese joint. in conclusion - Do The Pork Bun.

Delicious broth (A+++), soso noodles IMO (not what I usually imagine ramen noodles to be), MUST add on the pork belly. Samurai ribs were pretty good as well. The main centerpiece art looks like a gigantic wok-cleaner. Make a reservation if you don't want to wait 2.5 hrs for a table.

Get some drinks at the bar at the front of the house while you're waiting for your seat. Order your ramen with some super dry warm sake. Chatted up the owner the last time I came here. Seems like it's always this busy-- which definitely adds to the hype. However, the ramen lives up to the high standard that I was aiming for before I came. The ribs are worth trying too.

I don't know how I feel about super thin ramen noodles, but the appetizers were amazing. the raw stuff- halibut, tuna, yellowtail were amazing. the sauces were not the typical ponzu laced stuff... it was the real deal...

Well what can I say that 2000+ others have? Not much.. Ramen - Try the Akamaru - if you plan to order extra toppings, get them on the side, you usually get more (insider tip!) MUST GET: Pork buns, 2 per order - They don't take reservations in adv. Same day reservations are taken in person though - Avoid the wait, go at 4:45 PM to get in line for 5-5:30 PM for dinner - Happy hour 2 for 1 drafts 5-7pm (standing bar only) - high volume and fast turnovers - NOT good for big groups because the most they can accommodate is 8 comfortably in a booth. Groups of 10 and 12 have been done but it's tight. Bathrooms to the right of the hosts and hostesses, downstairs. FYI - yes Ippudo uses MSG in their ramen, that's why it's so good.

ÊI also like Ramen places that actually have Japanese chefs. I'll be the one that says "gochisousama deshita". I'm torn between Ippudo, Toto, and Momofuku for best ramen in NYC.

If you live anywhere in the city or close from it, chances are you've heard of this place a thousand times. One of the most hot spots in town, I first went in thinking, how good a bowl of ramen could possibly taste? ÊIT'S ONLY RAMEN. But boy, was I wrong. I ordered Akamaru Modern, which we were told by one of the servers is one of the most popular ramens they have. It took about 10 minutes for the ramens to come out, took that first sip of the broth and..... WOW. It was simply AMAZING. It's the best Japanese ramen you could treat yourself outside of Japan. Not to mention, pork buns I ordered for extra few bucks were amazing as well. Their noodles aren't the best however, but the broth and the meat makes for it. The average wait here is 1 hour on weekdays, 2~3 hours on weekends. They do have a bar inside for you to have a beer or two to wait it out. Everything on the menu here is overpriced, but the dishes are well worth the prices. If you're in town and don't mind chilling and waiting around for great food, this place is definitely a must go.

Rude waitress, Êpricey ok tasting ramen.... I totally missed the boat on this one. ÊI'm not sure what the hype is all about? Ambiance is cool, Êwith its dark, hip vibe, tables and chairs, and large booths. From what my NY friends said, it's always a long wait and reservations are a must. ÊWhen you make reservations here, they are very adamant about your whole party being at the restaurant before you are seated. ÊThe hostess repeated this to us a couple of times. ÊWhen we got there, the place was packed but we were still waiting on two friends. ÊMy friend told the hostess the whole party was there anyways. ÊShe literally counted all of us and asked where the other two where. Ê"Um one is in the bathroom and the other is around the corner parking his car". ÊShe looked skeptical and said ok, as long as they are basically here. Ê As soon as we were seated our waitress asked the same thing about the missing two people. ÊReally? ÊSaid they were coming. Ê10 minutes later she meanly said, oh your friends aren't in the bathroom or parking the car are they? ÊDANG. ÊShe repeated again what the hostess told us about reservations and said she'll take our orders this time but only this time. ÊWhat a Biatch. Ê She wouldn't even let us order for our two friends who were on the way. ÊWhat kind of customer service is that? Ê I understand it's a busy place and reservations are important. ÊOk we told a little lie, but wow to call us out like that and talk to us like we are little kids? ÊIt's people like them that give New Yorkers a bad rep for attitude and service. Anyways, we all ordered ramen. ÊEveryone said it was "good" but it wasn't "GOOD". Ê I ordered the Hakata Classic. ÊMy broth was fine, nothing spectacular. ÊNoodles were good, al dente. ÊThe pork was tough to chew. ÊMeh. ÊI've experienced better. ÊCan't believe I paid 14 bucks for this! Fail. ÊSo I would've given three stars for the ramen, but with the service, there goes your star.

Ippudo's broth is about as good as it gets! Compared to the many other Ramen shops we've tried, Ippudo's would rank very close to the top. The Ramen has a lot of great things going for it. #1 the ability to order more noodles! A good Ramen house that offers extra noodles?!? It doesn't get better then that. In our experience only the bad ramen houses offer this kind of deal. The high point of the dish was easily the broth. We got the akamaru modern ramen. It's tonkatsu flavor base was outstanding. Smooth, creamy, and flavorful. All without being overly salted. The meat was good, kind of a hit or miss, some pieces had plenty flavor and were very tender, while others were tough. The boiled eggs were a nice touch though! We highly recommend getting the eggs soft boiled. The creaminess of the egg york goes very well with the ramen! We also added the braised pork belly and decided it was a waste of money. It doesn't add anything to the dish and it seemed like the ingredient was out of place. So for future reference don't add the pork belly. We knocked a star because the noodles were a big let down. Personally we don't like them that thin, but the broth was good enough for us to look past it. In addition, you must get the pork buns! They are ridiculously good!! As for the restaurant. It's waaay overpriced for ramen ($20 bowl for ramen after extra noodles and pork belly) and my god is this place crazy busy. We're so thankful we got there at 5:15pm. They were able to sit our party of 9 in an hour and thirty minutes. The wait time they told us was accurate. Right before we got seated, we heard it was a 2-3 hour wait time for just a party of two! I mean the Ramen's good... but not worth that kind of wait. That broth made it a real treat to eat at Ippudo's. We would recommend anyone that likes Ramen to try it out, but only if you can withstand the wait and don't mind spending some extra money on something that's usually much cheaper.

oh. my. god. This was quite possibly the most accurately hyped place I have ever had the luck of finally getting a table at in all of NYC. I must have tried three dozen times over the course of 2 years to try and eat here, but was never prepared to wait the requisite 2 hours before being allowed inside. Last week, however, I happened to be hungry and nearby around 11:30pm and decided to try again. SUCCESS!!! No wait at all, and the place was still pretty full (it was also a weekday). Sat at a counter type seat (not the one by the kitchen) with my dining partner and were given menus and waters immediately. Perused the menu and asked the waitress which was the best. Passed on appetizers, as we knew we just wanted to get down to the important stuff: ramen. I decided to go for the Akamaru Modern, with a boiled egg. My dining partner, being picky, asked if he could just have noodles and broth, which they were happy to accomodate. I was surprised as how expensive this ramen was ($16 or so for a bowl without add-ons), but once I tasted it, I realized I would pay twice that without hesitation just to eat this again. Our food arrived SO fast! I couldn't wait to dive in. It was love at first slurp...I couldn't even speak after that. I just stared in amazement at the bowl and couldn't understand how something could taste this delicious. It was unlike any flavor I've ever tasted before, salty, but so complex...I'm thinking maybe it's that umami flavor I've been hearing about since I can't describe it. As I delved further into the bowl and tried the noodles, the meat, the egg, the veggies, every bite just kept getting better! I stole some of my dining partner's soup, which was also delicious but in a different way. I don't think I'll ever be able to order anything else here! I just need to figure out a way to justify the long-ass wait...probably going to be eating most of my meals in the middle of the night now, or perhaps I'll use this as an excuse to drink at Angel's Share for a couple hours before heading over to eat. JUST GO! SO WORTH IT!!!!!

On a recent visit to New York, we needed some food recommendations. ÊIppudo was highly recommended to us by a couple of local friends as the best ramen in the city. Be prepared to wait! ÊWe arrived around 7:45pm on a Wednesday night and it took an hour and a half to get a table for 3. We started with the pork buns. ÊTender, fatty pork meat, a piece of lettuce and a slather of special mayo sauce stuffed inside a soft bun. ÊGreat way to start the meal. ÊFor ramen I had the Akamaru Modern since it was highly recommended by most yelpers, and paid extra to add corn. ÊThe flavor of the soup base was good and ramen had good texture but overall nothing to get too excited about. ÊPortion was rather small too. To sum it all up, good food that's overpriced and not worth the long wait. ÊIf this is the best ramen in NY, all you New Yorkers are missing out & need to make a trip out to LA.

Everytime I've tried to go to Ippudo, the wait would always be more than an hour, and that deterred me from eating there. Finally, I built up the patience and the free time to wait for a table for 2. This time, it was a 75-minute wait. We checked an hour later after a brief excursion, and I was somewhat pleased that they were keeping track of our time wait, letting us know that we still have 15 minutes left. And indeed 15 minutes later, we got our table! The interior is posh yet welcoming with the giant tables where different dining parties share. The rest was a joy ride. We saw many options of ramen with suggested toppings. I got the Shiromaru Hakata Classic with Karashi Takana (leaf mustard), and it was soooo comforting to eat! ÊThe ramen is top-notch, and even though I wasn't so hungry then, I slurped that dish away. My friend liked hers too that she got "Kae-dama" (extra serving of noodle) to go with her soup. I can easily go back to that place, but I probably will have to come on a weekday afternoon or late night to avoid the mass.

Is the ramen good? Yes Are the pork buns delish? Yes Is it worth the 1.5 hour wait? Not in my opinion. There are very few foods worth waiting that long for and I'm not sure how much I trust their system of writing down names and highlighting rows. When asked an hour and 15 minutes within my reservation how much longer we had, the person who looked like a manager said, well you've been waiting an hour and a 15, we told you that you had an hour and a half wait, so you have 15 minutes to go. Very precise? Or very douchey. ÊYour call.

Really guys? This is a 4 star rated ramen place? I don't think so! Don't get me wrong, the ramen is pretty good, but is it worth the 2 hour wait and the $15? um, NO. This ramen must be made out of gold or something. If you go to Japan, the GOOD ramen there will cost you about $6 to $7 tops and you don't even have to tip! I think you can get better quality ramen at Totto for a bit cheaper if you are looking in NYC. The pork buns were pretty good, but $4 for that sucker? It's just bread and pork for crying out loud...

I waited for quite some time but I understand that it's really famous.. That's why we have to wait.. Anyway.. Let's not talk about the waiting.. My friends and I order different kinds of Ramen.. Here is what we ordered.. Shiromaru Hakata Classic Akamaru Modern Wasabi Shoyu Ramen Karaka Miso Ramen If you want me to pick which one I like the most.. I have no idea.. but if you want to try something spicy.. go for Karaka Miso Ramen.. Something salty.. go for Shiromaru Hakata Classic.. I will probably recommend Akamaru since is the most famous Ramen and the waiter recommend it too.. Compare to 4 of those.. Wasabi Shoyu Ramen is my least favorite but is still good.. Never get a chance to order the bbq pork bun.. :( will return some day to try it.. :)

First time I had went with my mother; it was around lunch time. The atmosphere was warm and welcoming as we were seated immediately. My mom and I both ordered a tonkotsu ramen. I personally loved it, being a lover of all food; however, my mother being a traditional Korean, found the ramen too oily and oddly salty. The second time, I had come with my boyfriend. Ê He loved the ramen (I recommened the tonkotsu ramen again)-- He also loved the atmosphere. It's a good place to drop by to converse with a friend or loved one.

YUM! Êquite possibly the best ramen broth I've had in the U.S. Ê We waited probably about 45 minutes but found our way to a nice corner of the bar and ordered some drinks and appetizers to help tide us over until dinner. ÊThe place was surprisingly larger than I expected when we were finally sat at our table. The service was friendly and the food definitely tasty. ÊDidn't mind the wait since we were expecting it and will for sure return again.

Any place with a consistent 2+ hr wait and lines almost everynight deserves a try right? I wouldn't wait 2.5 hours for this ramen but it is DEF a must go-to spot. Ambiance is really cool and staff is friendly. ÊGood vibes and great NY feel to it. ÊBeing a Cali girl, I have pretty high standards for Asian food in NY and I'm used to Asian food that is better or equal in taste for 1/4 the price. So I'd have to say, this ramen is one of the good ones. ÊIt's a good portion for NY and Ramen always leave you full anyways.

OK, just ok... ÊThis was an experience difficult to rate and review as I thought the food was 4-star but the other things bring it down to 3-star. (disclaimer: Êthis is my snap review, based on only one visit, and may not be reflective of others' experience.) I arrived mid Sunday afternoon. ÊGot a seat for 1 after waiting for only about 5 minutes. Êwoo hoo! Ê(most other reviewers mentioned up to 2 hours wait.) The front waiting area/bar is really cute. ÊOne can cough up $10 for a cocktail or two if you end up waiting there a long time. ÊDon't know if they take reservation or hand out beepers for you to walk around. Dining room is large and stylishly decorated, but somewhat of a cafeteria style. ÊYou either sit at a communal long table or with your own group in a booth. ÊThe loud incessant greetings "iras-shai mase" are a bit annoying and gimmicky, IMHO. ÊNowhere in Japan I heard this level of customer greetings. I was promptly seen, order taken, and pork buns appetizer was quickly served. ÊYou get 2 pieces for $9. ÊThey were excellent but I think the Momofuku ones were a little better. I ordered the Akamaru Modern Ramen. ÊThe broth was rich, nice and admittedly more "refined" than my fav place Menkui tei midtown. ÊIt's $15 with 2 miniscule pieces of pork which were really intense and almost gamy.... The noodle was top quality. ÊVery good bowl nonetheless. ÊThe overall portion size is a little smaller than most other ramen houses. ÊYou may add an extra portion of pork for $3 or 4. They also have an "extra" noodle option where you can ask for additional portion of noodle for $3 or $4 brought to you in a few min to add to your soup. Ê(the menu and waitress even warn you that you should leave some soup in your bowl and to order when you are ready as they bring it out so quickly...!!-- OK! whatever!!) ÊHowever the guy across from me ordered this but he had to wait 10-15 minutes while his soup was getting cold. ÊSo at least for me, a satisfying bowl with the right amount of protein and noodle would be like $23 !! (extra noodle and pork)--this is based on some really good ramen I had in Japan. Êi found this a bit excessive. I had a green tea cocktail. Ê$10 and I could have had this done better at a hole in the wall for $4. ÊWith tax/tip my lunch was almost $40. Overall, its a good place for ramen if you do not have to wait that long,and even better if someone else is paying. ÊThe pork buns are Êgreat like most people rave about. ÊSkip the cocktails. ÊI have not tried other ramen and dishes, of course. However if I have to wait 1 hour or longer to spend $40 or more Êfor lunch and so-so service, with staff shrieking irasshaimase every 5 minutes...I do not think I will make another visit.

Ippudo is more on the modern than most ramen houses. The service is good. We had the fried wings. They were pretty good with the cabbage that came with it. The servings seems bigger than the other ramen houses we have been to so far. The noodles are a bit smaller than the general ramen. Overall, delicious. The complimentary tea that was served after dinner was a nice black tea. I would bring my friends along the next time I am in New York.

I envy NYU students, who have the luxury of referring to Ippudo as their college bar. ÊMy "college bar" wasn't really a bar per say, it was a place to go that served cheap pitchers of beer. ÊThere was no fancy ramen. ÊNo hipsters. There were just guys with North Face fleeces and Boston Red Sox caps turned backwards chugging draft beer. Ê The ramen was 5 star. ÊSee every other review that slobbers all over Ippudo. ÊThe wait was absurd. The chicken wings and pork buns were better than good. Ê It's probably worth it to go with a group of friends (if only once), so that the 1+ hour does not phase you or cheapen the real reason you are there - the ramen. Ê Courtney P. recommended and Chris J approved. Ê Ippudo is that friendly reminder that I'm on the wrong side of 25. ÊTake that for what you will.

Trendy ramen joint with long wait. Another one of my food adventures from our previous NYC trip. I've heard many good things about about Ippudo and decided to make an effort to give it a try. Arrived for lunch and waited about 30-40min for a table of 2. Luckily there's a bar by the entrance to keep us entertained. The drinks were good but pricy which was expected. I had a beer and the gf had some yuzu sake infused cocktail. The layout and design of the restaurant was very trendy NYC, we were sat in a long table sharing with others, which I did not like. I ordered the Akamura Modern ramen. Ramen came out in quite a small bowl for $15.00. Although the noodle had a nice texture, I did not like the type of noodle, it was much thinner than I'm used to at other ramen places. The soup base was OK and their soy sauce marinated egg was not runny enough. Overall, the ramen here was subpar (a bit disappointed) but then again I had really really good ramen in Japan and I live in San Francisco, where there are a couple of REALLY good ramen places. This place is definitely over-hyped but is not bad at all. I can just give it a A-OK because I've had much better ramen elsewhere.

When I found out Ippudo was the most reviewed restaurant on Yelp in 2010, I knew I had to try it STAT. Well, its 2012 and finally got around to it and now I can see why. ÊFirst off, there was a line to put your name in for lunch on Saturday at 12.30pm. ÊWait was an hour, no big deal. ÊDude behind me was the most impatient ever; listening to his convo was hilarious. ÊHe either needed a major hangover cure or a major dose of Xanex. In any event, YES it is worth the wait. We had the fried chicken and pork and vegetable steamed buns to start. ÊVeggie steamed buns were the best, surprisingly, but no Momofuku i might add (not that they are supposed to be). Fried chicken was good, but a little rich. Passed on the Ichiban on tap to save room. ÊOrdered the Modern Ramen which was awe-some (see my photo). ÊNoodles so fresh and tender with just the right amount of al dente. ÊExcellent flavor and taste. ÊToki Underground in DC is good, but Ippudo is better. It is simply amaze. Oh! And did I mention the bathrooms? ÊFloor to ceiling mirrors so you have to watch yourself relieve yourself. Hilarious, but follows the interior design motif throughout the restaurant so maybe its no surprise. ÊLove this place, can't wait to go back.

A super trendy spot that has been hot for quite some time. I was here first maybe 2 years ago, and the lines at that time rival the lines of today. In any event, this is quite the ramen place. If you plan on going, plan on waiting up to an hour. The venue is trendy, upbeat and beautiful. There is a bar that serves some delicious cocktails for you to pass the time for the queue to dissipate. Once your name is called, be prepared to be ushered into a feast for both the eyes and the tummy. Despite being Asian, I understand minimal Japanese and have no idea what any food other than teriyaki, ramen and sushi are. Perhaps because I am not Japanese. In any regard, I had no idea what both the staff were yelling or what was on the menu. Therefore, I have no idea what I ate, but I know I ate a lot and it was delicious. Venue: (^_^) Wait time: (T_T) Bang for Buck: (O_o) Taste: (^_-) Presentation: (^_^) Overall: (^_-) Glad I came, and although I may recommend to friends, I won't become a regular. PROTIP: Go during happy hour so you have cheap drink specials while waiting to be seated!

$25 for a bowl of ramen? YES! It's cheaper than a plane ticket to Japan for this good stuff! Came at an odd hour for lunch (around 3 or 4pm on a Sunday) and got seated right away, but either way it would be worth the average wait time that this place is infamous for. First off the decor is impeccably done. High energy atmosphere paired with communal type tables just perfects the experience. We sat anonymously across from an elderly lady and her friend, while others were scattered among the long tables with strangers, or squeezed in big U-Shaped booths with close friends, love it. We started with the pork buns. Which is basically the worlds most incredible steamed bun stuffed with some god-like pork and sauce. Seriously, I have never seen anything this soft and succulent since the Marriott bed at a resort in Maui. If I could date this pork bun I would. If I could take this pork bun home to meet momma I would. Pork bun I love you. I ordered the Akamaru Modern with all the suggested toppings and it was to die for. So many flavors and textures, and the meat was so well braised it melted in my mouth. The eggs were perfectly cooked, with enough yolk to keep it interesting, and the broth was incredible. A++ in my book so far!

I have to admit that I had been dying to go this place. ÊI like ramen and I especially like genuine ramen. ÊIppudo has been getting all the latest raves and reviews, from foodies to chefs alike, and they have been consistently good. So, I came here and waited the signature 2 hours to get into a New York restaurant that is currently all the rage. ÊBe aware that they do not take resevations. ÊHowever, if you go in person and give them your name, they will give you a wait time and you can come back. ÊFor restaurants with extremely long wait times like Ippudo, it is good to do this early and then go and take a stroll. Once I get in with my girlfriend, we are so starved that we actually proceed to order half the menu and sample a bottle of sake too. ÊEverything is consistently good, just as previous reviewers have said. ÊGood, but not fantastic. ÊI would skip the appetizers (they are standard asian fusion fare) and go straight for the ramen. ÊThe service is attentive, but at times, rushed because literally, there are about 100 people waiting for your small seat. ÊThe dining room is a mixture of Japanese steakhouse-like communal seating and private tables. ÊIt is a good place to go with a fellow foodie or a friend, but not so much for a first date if you are looking to impress. Ê I did not come out of Ippudo feeling so completely wowed that I was dying to go back right away. ÊHowever, I also did not come out feeling jipped for the long wait. ÊThe food is good, the wait is long, the service is thorough but rushed, the hostesses are a sea of calm in the chaos and it is a good place to hang out with friends before hitting a bar but not for a lingering date. ÊSo there.

The ramen here is on par with Menchanko Tei but with the same bowl at $10 at Menchanko and $14 at Ippudo, the 40% markup is RIDICULOUS! That drops it from 4 stars to 2 stars right there. The pork Hirato buns are just a rip off concept of a Taiwanese dish called Gua Bao (and not nearly as good). They were tiny too, I mean one bite tiny. And for $10 for two buns, that's $5 a bite essentially. The prices here are out of control. There are just as authentic ramen places in the city that you don't have to pay a HUGE markup for just because they play rap music and have trendy decor. I love rap music, but I ain't payin' an extra 40% to hear it!

I must say, the one hour wait was worthwhile. The setting was very lively, energetic and loud. The waiters constantly shout in Japanese, quite amusing actually. I didn't know such delicious pork buns existed....until I came to Ippudo. The buns were like heaven, SO freaking soft. The pork is likewise so tender and juicy. And although one order came with only two buns (which I happened to finish in two bites -_-) cost $4 each, it could be double that amount and I'd still get it, shoooot. And as for the ramen (I got the Akamura Modern), superb! But imo, it was a bit too salty. Regardless, it was very tasty, rich and wonderful. I leave with one happy stomach. The end.

My first time in New York and this is probably my favorite place my friends and I tried. I think the best thing I tried were the pork buns. Wow were they an interesting flavor. It's definitely the one exceptional thing on the menu. I went in expecting something like Peking duck (which is something I love) but it was really something entirely different, in a good way. I only wish there was more than two per order. My girlfriend doesn't even like pork but she still ate my pork bun! I got the akamaru modern ramen which was really good as well. I liked that the broth wasn't too thick and greasy. The noodles were very thin which I am ok with. Again I just wished there was more. I did get extra noodles for $2 but I really wanted a complete refill. The wait was long, over an hr for us. By the time we got our table the wait was 3hrs! I noticed people would just come and put their name down and take off to come back hrs later. But overall it was worth the hr wait, just wish the portions were bigger.

Where to begin with this restaurant?! You truly do not know Japanese ramen until you go to a highly recommended place like Ippudo Or how about the rowdy and boisterous welcome in Japanese as you walk into the unsuspecting huge resto. Big groups are welcome and little kids are as well. My A+ for Ippudo is that they had adorable and reusable bowls and sippy cups for the tikes - not those styro foam with plastic one time use straws you get in diners and most restos. I could have eaten the pork bunwiches but could not pass up the chance to try their secret ramen recipes such as the Akamaru Modern. Shockingly, when I asked for a take out container at the end of the meal they informed me that no food can leave the premise! This was a first for me to hear such utterance! I learned that there are soy sauce or miso based broths that accompany the ramen so do inquire about the additional toppings!

I lost my Ramen virginity to Ippudo. I was young and scared. I was out on a Friday night in the city. Looking for action. When along comes Ippudo. I walked up to it, showed a little skin and got ignored. It told me to come back in two hours and try! I was crushed. Was it my jacket? My shoes? Or even worse...My hair? What had I done to deserve this? For a minute I thought of forgetting it all together and just going back to my sheltered life. But alas, two hours later I returned. Ippudo took me by the hand and walked me into the back room. I was warmly invited into it's arms and bathed myself in warm bowls of porky goodness. I will never forget that night. It was magical.

Did you know that in Japan, Ippudo is a chain of cheaply priced ($7-$8 a bowl), uber casual ramen shops? It's not the dimly lit, doubly priced, club-like abomination that's the New York incarnation. Not that I'm hating (I'm waiting on a 40 minute queue to get in on a Tuesday), just spitting truth. Other truths: waiting on the Ippudo line with hunger pangs always leads to hunger anger. Also: the pork bun appetizers are very good. So far, only 2 ramen places in NYC are good enough to mention. Ippudo is one of them. Maybe that, and the realization that you're waiting close to an hour for overpriced Japanese fast food, is all that really matters.

It wouldn't be completely false to say that when it comes to Ramen, I'm a late bloomer. I mean, I am no stranger to the Top. ÊShit, I lived in a dorm. ÊI practically survived on the 19 cent a pack stuff for 2 years. Ê However, when it comes to REAL Ramen, it has been my Yelp homies that have brought me into the know on what it's all about.

So it seems fitting that now that I have explored many of the Ramen offerings in my home of LA, that my favorite Asian yelper, Felicia C., has, once again, shown me something new in the Ramen world. ÊShe's my own Mr. Miyagi...except Chinese...but whatever, she still took me there...you get the idea. So my own personal sensei took me to discover a newish twist on a food I have come to love. ÊNamely Ippudo's Special Ramen. Pork pate, monkfish liver, tonkatsu with oyster sauce and a soft boiled egg to boot. Ê The noodles were thinner than the LA noodles I have tried but the portions were great, the flavor was on point and I'll tell you what, I'd be more than happy to change from the student of Felicia C. to the teacher of any of you yelpers who need to learn about NYC Ramen. Ippudo is where you should go. ÊLearn from me, it took me 32 years to find it, don't let the same amount of time pass for you! ÊDo it Yelper-San...trust me.

My friend from Pittsburgh and I are ramen fans, and that's putting it lightly considering my friend from Pittsburgh will drive eight hours so we can spend a weekend stuffing our faces at various ramen places in new york in search of the holy grail of noodles. ÊWhen we first came to ippudo we found it. Since my first experience at Ippudo (in which I waited four hours in line on my birthday for a table at my best friend's insistence) I have been hooked, and I've taken anyone and everyone vaguely interested in ramen on a pilgrimage to this site. ÊMy parents won't eat ramen anywhere else after coming here, and I frequently mention the place to friends only to see their faces light up with excitement: "I LOVE THAT PLACE!" I will never give a restaurant a five star rating without having been there multiple times, and so far I have been here 6 times with only one bad experience. The experience in question had nothing to do with the food but rather our waiter. ÊWe had ordered samurai ribs and when we never got them, even after finishing our ramen, we confronted the waiter who claimed that we had never ordered the ribs and actually argued with us on the matter instead of just offering to immediately put in an order. ÊBut I'd come here many times before then and experienced not only impeccable but extremely friendly service, and since then have been more than satisfied! I only have two warnings: on a weekend come maybe 20 minutes or more before the restaurant opens. ÊMy friend and I once came 10 minutes before they opened and found ourselves already waiting an hour for a table. ÊAlso if you're looking for a quite place to eat and catch up with a friend, this is not the spot. ÊIf you want loud music to which your synchronize your loud and greedy slurps and pump you up for the third order of noodles (kaedama), my friend, welcome to nirvana!

Hands down, the best ramen noodles in NYC. Cheaper, more food, and better food, and less hyped up (which means less chance to disappoint - yeah I'm talking to you Momofuku). The pork buns are excellent too... tender porkiness with a touch of spice. No matter what ramen you get, make sure you have some pork belly in it. You can also get a second helping of noodles for like $2.

ippudo has great ramen! the broth is a little salty for me but i'm fine with just eating the meat and noodles. i don't remember exactly what it was that i ordered, but it came with a side of rice topped with chopped up veggies and meat. whatever that was was delicious! all the rice and noodles filled me up quick. oh, if you're a first timer here, try the pork buns. they're pretty expensive, but worth at least one try!

The wait was and hour and 20 min, which i have no problem with as I just wandered union square in the meantime. After being seated and ordering, it took them over half an hour to get our appetizer on the table. They served many people who came after us. Regardless, the yellowtail was the highlight of our meal, it wasn't completely raw, it wasn't cooked, it was delicious with a drizzle of lemon and wasabi. Then came the ramen, I got the karaka miso which came with grated ginger on top (i think, the spicy one) and my friend got the special with a black pepper base or something. I tried a bit of both, both had good but not spectacular broths. The noodles were good, the toppings were sparse but good. Overall worth the experience, I suppose, but felt pretty underwhelmed, I mean they seated us in communal seating so I couldn't even face my dining partner in conversation!

With the months and months of hype, the 2000+ reviews, I was prepared to be blown away by mouth watering ramen noodles and broth. But...I wasn't. I came here alone, so i waited only 10 minutes, which was a nice relief. I decided to order the spicy broth and added Pork Belly. The noodles were great, I'll give them that. The broth was nice, but not great, to be perfectly honest. And the pork belly? This was meh. It was tender, but it was the first time I couldn't/didn't want to eat it all. Don't get me wrong, this place has good soup, but for $20+ with tax and tip for a bowl of soup and addition of pork belly? Come on, really? Unless Thomas Keller is making my soup, its hardly worth that much.

So this place is growing on me. ÊI swore I wrote a review on this place a year ago and gave it a 3 star. ÊEither I deleted it on accident, or I'm bat shit crazy. I'm very into instant gratification and not much into long waits, even if the food is mind blowing. ÊI've been to Ippudo a total of 6 times now, and this place keeps getting better in my eyes. ÊA big part is probably because my wait times have significantly gotten better. I had a wait time of 15 minutes at 6pm for a table of 5 two weeks ago, and this past week I had a wait time of 40 minutes for a table of 12 (2 tables of 6, they can only seat a maximum of 10). Lately i've been going with the Spicy Miso Ramen. ÊI like the spicier kick that makes me sweat balls. Ê Noodles: ÊAl dente and perfectly chewy. ÊOption of extra noodles by yelling out "kae-dama" when you still have broth left. ÊI finally yelled it out, instead of just asking the waiter. ÊMuch more fun yelling out you want some extra noodles than asking politely. Broth: ÊPerfect spiciness. ÊNot so spicy where you are pining for water and filling your stomach up, and thus having no more room for extra noodles. Ingredients in broth: ÊMaybe possibly too gingery for my tastes, but still pretty good. Finally, the pork buns. ÊI'm starting to think they are better than Momofuku's. ÊMore tender and better tasting. Ippudo has moved up to my 2nd favorite place for ramen right behind Ramen Dojo in the Bay Area (http://www.yelp.com/biz/É) I'll be back, since it's right around the corner from my house :)

While not as good as ramen in Japan, I was shocked at how delicious the akamaru ramen was. The chashu pork was pretty tender, especially compared to other ramen places here. It could have used a little more seasoning in my opinion though. The brother had a slight kick to it because of the spice, scallions, and garlic oil. It was deliciousssss. My boyfriend had the miso ramen and had tried the shiromaru before, and we both agreed that my akamaru was by far the best. We also tried the samurai rib, which was succulent and melted off the bone right into the savory sweet teriyaki sauce. We will definitely go back next time for MORE! P.S. We arrived at 11:30pm....super late for dinner, but we didn't have to wait at all. We had a big snack a few hours before. The restaurant was still pretty full.

4 stars because of decor and the Hirata pork buns. First came here on a Saturday, was told there was a 3 hr wait. What?! Went to a different ramen place. Came back on a Tuesday afternoon around 11:30 am, 5 minute wait! Hell yes! The place definitely reminded me of a cool club scene, from the screams of "irasshiamase" the second you walk in to the dim lighting and huge glittered montages on the walls. It was a bit jarring to have all that in my face during lunch, but it was a nice change from the usual small traditional shops that serve ramen. The buns were delicious, and this is coming from someone who hates eating any fatty meat. The meat was so tender and the sauce complemented the flavor of the pork perfectly. However, I think I, like Megan L., also had too high expectations going in for the ramen. I got the Akamaru Modern and couldn't even finish it. The ramen noodles weren't chewy enough for my taste and the soup didn't blow me away. Don't get me wrong, the ramen was good; I just feel like I've had better at places right here in the South Bay. Maybe I just like richer broth and thicker chewier noodles... I probably would not go to Ippudo again if I had to wait in line at all. It seems to me like a cool "been there done that" kind of thing to check off your list.

To some, it might be incomprehensible to shell out $14-$16 for a bowl of ramen, but with all things considered, this is by far one of the better ramen places in the NYC. ÊThe wait is excruciatingly long so don't come hungry but feel free to enjoy one of their fun cocktails or an ice cold beer at the bar while you wait. Ê The lobby is crowded with hoards of people waiting for a table so I suggest you find some way to entertain yourself either by grabbing a drink at the bar or elsewhere. Ê Once your table is ready, you're greeted by a modern, chic dining area and chefs behind the counter who shout and holler at your arrival, quite festive. Ê The ramen selection is great and personally, I love adding the poached egg to my bowl. ÊOne downside is that they took the burnt ramen option off the menu. ÊThe noodles are cooked perfectly if only the portions were a little bigger; I'm generally less than full by the time I reach the the bottom of my bowl.

Amazing ramen is hard to find. I'm stating the obvious, but it seriously is! Ippudo has only a couple locations but if you can find one, GO TO THERE!!! The Akamaru Modern is like a party in my mouth and everyone's invited :) Every ingredient is distinct, flavorful and perfectly cooked. In comparison, your run-of-the-mill ramen shop frequently ends up serving a sludge of 10 ingredients which become one-note somehow (a miracle of terribleness). Lastly, the pork belly buns... I basically flew to New York for this dish. It's definitely very very good, but certainly not what I'd call "inspired". The mayo and lettuce reminded me too much of a McChicken... There's a time and place for McChickens (3am), but the point is, this bun needs some work.

Whats there to say the other 1000 reviewers haven't.

Ê What do you know 20 minutes later she told me a table opened up and we were seated promptly upon arrival. Good thing we stayed around the area. We got the pork buns and I got the Akamaru Modern ramen, wich some egg, it was delicious. Ê The soup and noodles were excellent!

Stopped by around 630p... an hour and half wait. Wow... I was ready to skimp, but my husband was dying to try it out. Time seemed to pass by really fast... but as I looked at my clock, the hostess was pretty accurate. I think we sat after about an hour and 10min? We saw Anne Burrell there so this place must be pretty good. An hour and a half wait and $15 for a bowl of ramen. Was it worth it? I think not My husband loved it though. Yes, noodles were fresh and broth was good. Maybe if we came at slow hours ... and maybe if I was craving ramen THAT bad, I would come back... but I dont think I ever crave ramen THAT bad to pay $15 for it. But maybe I'll try something else on the menu....

Akamaru Modern, Pork Buns and Green tea brulee. Enough said! Best ramen spot in the city. It gets really busy around late lunch-dinner time. 1-2hr waits, but well worth it. There's usually parking around the side streets. Just MAKE SURE you don't go over the time limit because you WILL get a ticket or possibly towed.

I love Ippudo for their ramen and their out-of-this-world delicious pork buns. I am missing them right now as I sit at my desk in San Francisco dreaming of NY. The sauce is amazing, bun is soft and the pork belly is tender with just the right amount of fat. I like the Shiromaru Hakata Classic and the Tori Ramen (I really can't decide which I like better). Both of these have a thin broth (unlike Totto for example with their thick rich chicken broth) but they are both soooo tasty. Also, try the Annin Sorbet dessert. Sweet tofu custard with fresh sorbet (to die for!) which I recommend after a salty meal. They do a great job here. Service is good (if you don't mind the wait before you're seated). I spent 6 months in NY and miss it terribly. Please enjoy a bowl of ramen and a pork bun for me - I'm jelly ;)

I recently told my friend that I had never been to Ippudo before. He looked at me as if I had said something blasphemous. So I finally decided to check it out on a Wednesday night. I'm sorry to say that I didn't love it. Since we went on a weekday night, the wait wasn't so bad. We were seated in 45 min, which was mild compared to my friend's last visit (2 hrs!!). I really did appreciate the friendly hostess who definitely went the extra mile to notify each party when their names came up on the queue. Ippudo definitely exudes that trendy, modern vibe with its dark interior and bar-like seating arrangements. We were a party of three, so we sat across from another party, relatively close to the kitchen. I noticed that some tables faced mirrors - not something that I particularly like in restaurants but a minor point. We ordered two starters - the special Shrimp Pinchos with Tofu Mentaiko and the Umakara Tori Tatsuta Age. The Shrimp Pinchos came in five pretty delicious bite-sized pieces. I happen to like avocado very much, so this was a great pick for me. I wasn't blown away by the Umakara, which was breaded chicken. Oh well! My choice of (high-end) ramen? I went with the Akamaru Modern + Nitamago (egg). The broth, I must admit, was tasty at first. But after a couple of spoonfuls, I didn't feel like lapping it up. I certainly didn't need the extra serving of noodles, which is a nice gesture on part of the restaurant. All in all, Ippudo was just okay. I wouldn't wait two hours for ramen, but that's just me. As a last point, service at Ippudo is good. Our waiter was super attentive and friendly.

quick. efficient. delicious. i was a little scared to come to this place because i really did not want to wait an hour for yet another good new york eatery. however, we got there at 6 pm on a monday night with a party of four and were able to get in, get seated, order, get our food, AND finish eating it within one hour (though i must give ourselves some credit for being speedy eaters). the ambiance of the place is not at all what i had expected, though i guess i knew very little about the place before coming. it has a youthful, modern vibe. it's dimly lit inside with contemporary decor and hip, outdated, young music (who still plays ashanti nowadays?). service was really speedy and friendly. our waitress was very nice and kept checking up on us, though the servers were borderline hovering in order to get us out of there quickly. but with the long line outside, who could blame them? we got 4 master's special ramen for our table and wowzzz the broth was AMAZING. it was so flavorful. you know a place is good when you find that no matter how hard you try, you will probably never be able to recreate the dish you just ate. that is how i felt about this ramen. granted i'm no ramen-maker to begin with, but there seemed to be some secret ingredient in the ramen broth. truffle oil maybe? i don't know but it was darn good for sure. this place is pretty pricey so you probably can't come here weekly for your ramen fix but do try it, especially if you love ramen!

There was no wait on a Monday afternoon around 1pm. Hooray! + Lunch sets: In comparison to the ridiculously priced ramen, it seemed smart to shell out "only" $3 extra for a small bowl of rice + meat + small salad. The chicken tasted fine. + Akamaru Modern: very nice, probably my favorite ramen so far (compared to SF/LA) because of the texture of the thin noodles and the magic sauce they put in the soup. - Shiromaru Hakata Classic: MEH. No one should be paying $14+tax/tips for a bowl of pretty regular ramen with TWO slices of meat, no matter how delicious the noodles are. The pork buns the couple next to us ate looked really good, but I didn't want to order anything else after asking for my $3 glass of coke. WTF, $3 for a small glass of non-refillable coke?? Come on! The decor was kinda cool (though no, I most certainly did NOT enjoy staring at myself in the mirror), but they usher you in and out pretty quickly, leaving no time to chill/enjoy the atmosphere.

Ippudo was everything I anticipated and more, thus very deserving of a five star rating!! ÊRamen--good! ÊPork buns--good! ÊShishito peppers--good! ÊSpare rib (app)--good! ÊTop it off with simple, clean dcor and super friendly, attentive, knowledgeable staff makes Ippudo amazing! Knowing how long the wait is my two companions and I settle for an early dinner arriving at 5:30pm, and were seated within 10-15 minutes. ÊLove the fun loud welcome in Japanese--instantly makes you feel welcomed. ÊMy two dining companions have been before, so appetizers were settled, and one with extra hungry eyes thought the spare rib sounded excellent, so that was that. ÊHere's my take on everything we ordered: - Pork buns - The pork so tender and well-seasoned and flavored. ÊThe bun itself just the right amount of sweetness and oh so soft. ÊAnd the spicy sauce just brings it over the edge delicious. ÊI have to admit, while the iceberg lettuce was fresh and crisp, it didn't do anything for me. ÊOne of my companions agreed and we even started thinking of other veggies that could have worked better...caramelized onions, pickled dikon, red radishes. ÊHaving said that we thoroughly enjoyed them and ordered 3 orders, one order for each of us. - Ê Shishito peppers - Supposedly every seventh pepper you eat is really spicy. ÊI had four or so and none were spicy. ÊPrepared nicely and didn't taste deep fried at all. The dipping salt was a nice touch. - Spare ribs - Fall off the bone tender and so flavorful is why we were so glad we ordered them. ÊOne of my companions even went as far to say that the spare ribs were more enjoyable than the pork buns! ÊI concur. Ê - Akamaru Modern with Kakuni (braised pork belly) topping - Hands down THE best bowl of ramen I've had in my life! ÊNever have I had a broth so rich and layered with flavor. ÊAll ingredients played an integral role in complexity and flavor. ÊNice that there were a generous serving of the pork belly chashu and braised pork belly. ÊAnd while I enjoyed the noodles, I almost prefer a thicker more textured "wavy" noodle...maybe it's just because it's what I'm used to though. ÊI can see why they offer an extra order of noodles for $2, as the soup is so rich it can be enjoyed further by another ball of noodles. No room for dessert...especially because we couldn't take home our pork buns which pretty much forced us to eat our second pork bun. ÊThey have a pretty strict no take out policy, which I think I can almost respect. Ê Enjoyed my dining experience at Ippudo for the food, service and ambiance/vibe are supreme! ÊWill definitely make this a "must go to venue" every time I visit NYC!!

Ippudo is good ANYTIME of the year because it warms the soul :-) It's a definite "must try at least once even if have to wait 2 hours". ÊIf it's not too annoying, order Hirata buns (steamed pork buns) at the bar and have a drink while you wait OR I sometimes like to walk over to 3rd Avenue and 9th for some taro milk tea at Saint Alp's. ÊEither way, HIRATA BUNS ARE A MUST HAVE! I've tried all of Ippudo's different ramen combinations and I happen to love their Shiromaru Classic with extra pork, bamboo shoots and bakudan (a spicy paste that you can add into the broth). ÊThis combination is juuuuust right. Ê Did I mention that you should really get the hirata buns? ÊI'm greedy so I order my own set of 2 instead of eating only one and sharing one. ÊENJOY!

My first visit to Ippudo was at their opening party, and I indulged in an Akamaru ramen and nama beer. The taste brought back memories of my time in Japan, which indicates flavor AUTHENTICITY With a mostly Japanese crowd, a Japanese TV crew (Fuji terebi perhaps?) spotted my gaijin-ness in an instant and interviewed me on the taste, to which I appropriately gave a thumbs up. I didn't think anything of it until a month later some friends in Japan mentioned seeing me on TV. I wonder how much of a hot mess I looked surrounded by steaming bowls of ramen, yikes! Our group didn't realize that opening party meant ON DA HOUSE, or else we would have definitely ordered more grub to try. Even if I had to pay, I'd most definitely return. Actually, I have a few times already :)

They've done it again. As usual, of course. I made reservations for 8pm but I got there at 6:55 since I knew I was probably going to have to wait 45 mins regardless. ÊLuckily I was seated around 7:25. Anywho, I ordered the wasabi shoyu ramen. I shared the Kamo Roast & Nasu Nibitashi with my friend which was really delectable. The duck was tender and savory. I usually don't like eggplants but this was an exception. The wasabi shoyu was more paste like compared the akamaru modern that I tried before. I added the nitamago again as always. It wasn't overly spicy though but you do taste the wasabi. Ippudo, you never disappoint me.

The best thing about Ippodu is the ramen. ÊYou could try other stuff here and not be disappointed, but the ramen is off the hook! Went here with four friends and we each ordered a different dish. ÊThere are a few flavor bases you need to know to be able to maneuver a ramen menu and thankfully they explain it right on the menu. ÊI got the the Akamaru Modern. ÊI savored it to the last drop. ÊI can only describe the broth as...multi-faceted. ÊIt's so complex with so many different flavors contributing to the overall umami orgy--it's like there's a party in your mouth an everyone's invited! ÊIn fact I can say that about all the meat based broths. ÊEach is complex and delicious in different ways. ÊI wanted to order extra noodles (Kae-dama) but I didn't want to seem like a fatty in front of my friends. The only one I don't recommend is the Wasabi Shoyu Ramen, which my friend had and she didn't much like it. ÊI had to agree since it tasted like diluted soy sauce. We also got pork buns, and they were ok. Oh yeah, -1 star because the wait was atrocious (2 hours!). ÊIt seems that it's so popular that there's always a wait.

WHOOO I love ramen and they do a great job of it at Ippudo NY. This is the most reviewed place in NYC so it was a MUST for me to come and eat. I got here at 12:30 in the afternoon with no wait. It's one of the best looking ramen restaurants I've ever been to from here to Japan. The service was great and the presentation was a plus as well. I ordered the pork buns which was delicious. The only place I liked it at more is Momofuku Noodle Bar. I ordered the Akamaru Modern ramen. It had thin noodles with pork slices. I also ordered a side of egg which was runny. The best way you can get a egg. The 3rd Item i had was the eel rice bowl and it was splendid. I couldn't go wrong with anything I ate here. Great food and great service. Recommendation: Akamaru Modern ramen w/ Egg, Pork buns, and grilled eel over rice.

Very, very good ramen. We went early and so had absolutely no wait at all. I got the Shiromaru Hakata Classic and my friend got the Akamaru Modern. She seemed like she was in heaven and was going to start tearing up at any moment (touched by the amazing ramen?). I have to say, they do a really good soft boiled egg. Delicious. Super fatty soup, but super super super amazing. I think I tasted butter or something but damn, that was good soup. A little pricey, as ramen usually is. I'd have to say though....this is only the second best ramen I've ever had :-p. If you're ever in California, Orenchi is worth a try.

Get ready to wait at least an hour to get seated here, but you can always order some pork buns, shishito peppers, and chicken wings at the bar while you wait to hold you over. I got the Akamaru Modern, and added Kakuni (braised pork belly) to it. ÊMake sure you add the Kakuni, because it's the most flavorful of all the pork cuts they offer. ÊIf you read the menu closely, the pork that comes with both the Akamaru Modern and Shiromaru Hakata Classic is not the same braised pork belly, so it's totally worth the $4 to add it. ÊThe noodles were a bit thinner than I would have liked, but the tasty broth totally made up for it. As for the appetizers, I thought their famous pork buns were just OK. ÊMaybe it's because I got them at the bar while I waited, but still, I've had better. ÊIf you haven't had them though, you should still order them to try at least once, because they are tasty and some think they are the best pork buns in the city. ÊShishito peppers, chicken wings, and samurai ribs are all excellent, and also ideal to share at the table. ÊMy favorite appetizer was the TAKO WASABI. ÊYummm!!! ÊThe only downside to this dish was that it was tiny (literally about the size the of the soy sauce dish you get at sushi places...barely even enough to satisfy one person, so don't even think about sharing at the table).

I am no ramen expert but these were the best noodles...ever. Came here on a Friday after work, the wait time for 2 people at 6pm was 30 mins.. The waiting area is practically non existent so be prepared to stand really close to everyone else.The dining area is also ridiculously small. The pork buns are such a must. Unbelievable how good these things are. The bun alone is so soft and melts in your mouth. The pork is delicious. I also had the modern ramen with the miso paste and a boiled egg. The bowl was huge and the broth was amazing. The broth was so good that when the noodles are done, you must just pick up the bowl and drink whatever is left. So good, so so good. So filling! I will definitely come back here for a ramen fix. Would never bring a large party though. I think the best bet is during an off time or early evening.

Karaka Kogashi Miso Ramen w/ Kakuni + Hot Sake = Complete NY night. I thoroughly enjoyed the smokiness of miso and it's complimentary characteristics with the spice. The heat doesn't only come from the ramen but also the soup. It wasn't overly spicy but if you were to stop eating (which I didn't until I ran out of ramen) the heat will creep up like drunkenness from 6 shots of Hennessy XO; hits you out of NOWHERE! The ramen was flavorful and not bland whatsoever. In most cases of ramen restaurants, the ramen repels any flavor from the miso soup base and for Ippudo's ramen was the only exception in my experience with Ramen. The ambience was lighthearted and housed friendly staff from the front to the back. The waitress happened to be from California with a California state tattoo on her neck and made the whole experience even more rich. Only con is the amount of space they had that Friday and had to reserve FAR in advanced (meaning when it first opened at 11AM) to get a seat at 8 PM. Tip: arrive early, check-in and make sure your whole party is there. The front staff will do their best to move you from the front (which has a wet bar) to the back into your seats as soon as possible (It might have something to do with our party of 12). Overall, satisfactory. I did not speak one word while eating. Our entire table had a moment of silence while eating minus the occasional slurping.

Ambiance: 5 Food Quality: 5+ Ê Service: 5 Value: 4 The Gist: My girlfriend and I have been on a noodle kick for about a month now, determined to find the best noodles in Manhattan. Ippudo was our first stop and by far out classes any of its combination. With 5 restaurants per block in Manhattan it is not often that you hear about people waiting for an hour to sit let alone four hours. Yes that is correct, people will wait for four hours just to try these delicious soups. I can honestly say that while I would never wait four hours, I can see why people would. The soups are majestic. Every spoonful tastes different and unique from the last. Ippudo may be the best noodles in Manhattan and is a must try for anyone with a little time to spare who is craving a good ramen!

Ippudo is officially my favorite ramen :D Not only is the broth amazingly awesomerific, but the noodles are so light and full of body that they make the meal feel much lighter than it actually is! I love leaving a ramen place feeling well fed and not completely fatty and bloated. Also, the pork buns... WOW. I wish these existed in California D: They are amazing. Seriously. I don't know what they do to make these things so awesome, but they're doing something right. The service was impeccable (but we went early for lunch with no wait), they kept refilling my water, the waitress was nice, and wow it was just... a great experience. I seriously would come back to NYC just for this place. Geebus. Delicious times a million.

At 10pm on a Monday night, there was still a 20 minute wait for table of 2... ARRRRrr =O But oh my.... the broth and the noodles = UMAI~~~ Hirata buns were good.. the bun were perfectly steamed and fluffy. The pork is soo tender with spicy sauce balanced with Kewpie Mayo. But I thought the lettuce totally throw-me-off, kinda gave it a american-burger twist to stuffed steamed bun. This time, I ordered the Kogashi Miso Ramen (Ippudo chintan based noodle soup, a dark, rich broth made from charred miso, topped with pork belly chashu, 1/2 boiled egg, cabbage, spinach, naruto with added menma) First thing i saw was the charred pieces ((ohhh no.. gonna get stuck in between my teeth)). The broth is fatty, rich, silky smooth, very vey porky flavored with porky fat! SO GOOD! And I preferred the kind of noodle in mine than the Akamaru Modern, which is what my friend ordered. The soup base is not like a typical miso soup where you stir and all the residue flows around.. And I didnt really taste the miso flavor, probably due to it being charred. can't wait to come again!!

Price and wait aside, it was VERY damn yummm. i can see what the hype is about. is it still worth it? come on a sunday around 3pm so the wait isnt so bad, and then yes, it is worth it! wait and price aside, food rocked! Yuzu rock cocktail: delicious and fresh. bartender was awesome enough to tell me NOT to get the one i was gonna order, sign of a good place. Japanese cucumber with chili flakes and sesame oil: who orders veggies?! these are delicious!! fresh but still savory, and the seasoning makes it so on point. scarfed these down. Pork buns: all the rage! these were great snackers. they are decent sized - about the size of your hand - and come in a 2 pack per order. Akamaru ramen (chasu) with extra kakuni braised pork belly: i LOVE pork belly. the chasu was well done also, and the broth was actually pretty amazing. it wasnt pasty and it complimented the food just right. After just that, we were FULL as heck, and i went out in a rolling food coma. Didnt even finish my ramen. i know, travesty. DID learn, though, that if you still have extra broth, you can get a SECOND ORDER OF NOODLES FOR FREE. yes FREE!! that's like a second dinner, on them! awesome. hip locale, great friendly young staff, wonderful food. would definitely come again.

Sorry sorry sorry, I know this is supposed to be mind-blowing and I'm supposed to never want to go anywhere else and I'm supposed to pray to the gods that exist in the kitchen of Ippudo but really... I just don't feel it. The vegetarian broth is mushroom based and I really dislike mushrooms. Usually in ramen broth, it's masked by all the other delicious flavors, but the veg broth at Ippudo is so extraordinarily savory, it's like mushrooms boiled with extra mushrooms thrown in and then a bunch of salt. It's really overwhelming and I found myself just eating the noodles and then pretending I was full as to not offend them. Basically, it's a destination-- people wait outside in the rain for hours-- and that tends to breed overratedness (yes, I can make up words if I want to). I kind of doubt I'll be back, which is sad because I wish I could love it here like everyone else :(... at least the decor is nice!

Overdue review! When travelling back to NY this past May I was excited to see my friend and when she asked what I wanted to have for dinner I told her ramen. There seems to not be any slamming ramen restaurants in the Pacific Northwest so I was hoping to be impressed and Ippudo definitely lived up to the hype! I've been told that this place is notorious for the dreaded 1.5 hrs+ wait regardless of what day of the week it is (in fact the friend I was with had walked over to another restaurant, ate some soba, walked back to Ippudo and still waited a bit for her table) but we only had to wait maybe 20 minutes! Lucky! Get the buns with the shrimp omg! And whatever ramen is their special of the day. Seriously, you won't regret it. Considering the price and location it isn't too bad... though i wished there were more pieces of meat served than what it came with.

Ramen is probably my single favourite dish, so this was high on my priority list during my visit to NYC. My friend and I showed up at 5:30pm on a Friday and there was only a short wait (5-10 minutes). No sweat. That said, I'd be willing to wait. I went with the Akamaru Modern, which was fabulous. There wasn't a boatload of toppings, but what was there was great. I read a few reviews where people thought the chashu was under-salted, but I thought it let the flavour of the pork come through. Plus, I find that a lot of places over-season their chashu. The broth was the real star--thick and creamy without feeling heavy and really flavourful and balanced.

I went here because Frank Bruni reviewed it as decent in the NY Times a while back, and I just finished his book, and I'm a huge Japan nerd. ÊSo...not an ideal reason to go to a restaurant, but good enough. ÊI went with my friend, who is also a huge Japan nerd. I was pleased with Ippudo. ÊI had looked at the website and seen that the wasabi shoyu ramen was a vegetarian option, so I knew that's what I was getting and didn't take much time with the menu. I ordered the yuzu-shu (citrus sake) and my friend ordered the Calpis cocktail, which puts shochu in the popular Japanese drink. ÊI already knew I would like the yuzu-shu because I'm a big yuzu fan, but we were both delighted by the "Calpico High" as Ippudo called it. ÊThis wasn't a combination either of us had thought of before, but we both really enjoyed it. As I already mentioned, I ordered the wasabi shoyu ramen, and my friend got the shiromaru hakata classic with nitamago (soft-boiled eggs). ÊHe said that his was very good and the broth was a bit thick and tasty. ÊMy ramen was pretty good, but my plan was to get the kae-dama so I didn't focus on the broth much. ÊThe noodles that came originally were perfectly cooked but the kae-dama portion was a bit undercooked. ÊStill, they were delicious. ÊThe thin tofu slices in the ramen were absolutely delicious. I also ordered the matcha (green tea) brulee but was not very impressed. ÊIt had a strong matcha flavor but the creme brulee itself was not so great. ÊIt comes with matcha gelato on top, which was good. The service was excellent. ÊOur waitress was very cute, but we were also checked on repeatedly by other servers walking by - two asked if I wanted kae-dama! ÊWe only had to wait up front for about 15 minutes, having arrived at 12:30pm, though while we were waiting I heard that the wait had gone up to 30 minutes! ÊThe bartender up front served us drinks and I saw he also served appetizers, so the wait passed quickly. I did notice very large U-shaped booths, great for groups! Again, I was very pleased with my visit to Ippudo, and I definitely rate it high among the several Japanese places in New York that I've visited.

I would say the Ramen is a OK. Went in a windy Tuesday noon for lunch special with my friend. The line was ok and the staff were really nice. Like the deco of the restaurant. When we entered the hallway of the restaurant, all the staff greeted us in Japanese with a joyous voice, cool. Ramen was less than decent in portion, yet quite tasty with rich and oily soup. My friended said the rice was really good. Crowded and obviously the staff wanted us just finish the food and leave. It took them around 8 mins to get the change for us. All in all, this place is worth trying but somewhat pricey. Very commercial and westernized rather than an original Japanese-style ramen stand where you feel cozy and down-to-earth in the streets of Tokyo or Osaka.

First Rule of Ippudo NY - Do not eat anything within five hours of going (trust me). Second Rule of Ippudo NY - Try to keep your beverage consumption to a minimum (every time I leave, I feel like I'm 10 months pregnant) Third Rule of Ippudo NY - If you don't want to wait over an hour for the best ramen and pork buns in NYC (sorry David Chang), then come at lunch time. Ê Every time I come here, it is an absolute pork fest. ÊWhen you are ushered into the dining room, you are greeted by the entire staff in unison. ÊIts great when you can go somewhere and order without even looking at the menu. ÊHere is what you should order when you go: - Samurai Ribs - Hirata Buns - Akamaru Modern Ramen with the following extras: Kakuni (pork belly) and Nitamago (soft boiled egg) Just take a deep breath, enjoy, and remember to limit your beverage consumption so you have enough room for their amazing broth. ÊIf you still have space, you can order more noodles by banging your fist as hard as you can on the table and screaming: "KAE-DAMA!" Ê=)

I know writing this review is moot since Ippudo clearly doesn't need another good review. But it's so mindbogglingly right that I have to officially declare my love from the treetops... or better yet, more discreetly via Yelp - and hoping that this unabashed love will spur them to open another location (of equal quality, of course). Seems to me like Ippudo been around forever, but you can't tell that from the hour plus waits on any given weeknight at prime dinner time. Nice try on their part adding a bar to make the wait go faster while generating more cash for them, but it's so crowded by the front that it's a much better bet just to go early or put your name in and duck elsewhere for a drink. You're in the East Village, so this isn't hard. Once you're seated, pat yourself on the back for being such a tried and true New Yorker - you're truly awesome- and treat yourself to an appetizer - I'm partial to the pork buns and occasionally will go crazy and get one of the special appetizers. The Êfish buns we tried last were a delicious, sophisticated Japanese version of the Filet o Fish, with a just right sweet and sour sauce balanced by a soft doughy bun and crunchy lettuce. After that, it's Akamaru Modern all the way. You can try something else, but chances are at the end you'll just wish you'd gotten the Modern, so to thine own self be true.

So the 2 ramen places on my list of places to go was Ippudo and Totto ramen and it could be because I ordered the right thing but I have to say that I liked Ippudo more. ÊI normally pick the hole in the wall over the nice fancy shmancy place and to be honest the prices are pretty high for ramen but it's just sooo good that it deserves no less than 5 stars. ÊI had their special, the black pork sesame ramen, and I just have to say that the first slurp of noodle I had - a tingle of sesame oil that got sucked up with the first slurp of noodle knocked my socks off. ÊI didn't expect to be that impressed by the ramen here but the more I ate the more I just couldn't stop. ÊThe soup flavoring was amazing, the black pork was tender, and the flavored egg was cooked perfectly. ÊI didn't leave a single drop of soup in my bowl. ÊI have to say though that people who don't eat it fast enough didn't seem to enjoy it as much.

After the rave reviews from other Yelpers, my sister, and every other person I know in New York, I had high expectations. The ramen was flavorful and tasty, definitely better than what I've had in Chicago and easily beating the local favorite Noodles by Takashi Yagihashi. But while it might be the best ramen in NYC, it just didn't bowl me over (pun intended) the way other restaurants have. Having said that, the little pork bao are delicious (they pan fry the pork belly) and the chicken wing gyoza is very creative and tasty. Worth a visit, but maybe doesn't live up to the hype.

This is one of the most hyped up restaurants in nyc - numerous glowing reviews on yelp and often there's a long line to get in. ÊI was eager to check out what the fuss is all about. The pork bun was good, but would be better if the veggie was not lettuce but something pickled or with more assertive taste/texture - that would have added some depth to the flavor profile . Ê Miso ramen was quite disappointing. ÊThe broth had a lasting tonkotsu taste, which was nice. But the miso taste was quite weak. ÊWhile the dallop of grated ginger helped to add some nuance to the broth, it further masked the already weak miso taste. ÊChashu was good, but not great - can't hold a candle against Santouka's toroniku. The noodle itself was the most disappointing - overcooked and too soft - almost tasted like instant ramen. If you want the texture of authentic ramen, go to Totto Ramen. Adding insult to injury was the inflated price. Ê14 bucks is quite steep for regular ramen, even for New York (mind you that there was nothing fancy about it. If you want onsen tamago, that's $2 extra). ÊThere are cheaper options in the city that do a better job. Decor was nice for a ramen place, and service was good. ÊBut the ramen itself was simply not that great. I don't understand the hype at all. Sorry.

Disappointed! My friend and I arrived at 1:00pm and were seated at 2:10pm. With all the hype around this place and the long wait, I was really hoping to be blown away but was thoroughly disappointed! - Overpriced! For example, a bowl of ramen was $13 and soft boiled egg was an additional $2... more bamboo shoots, another $2. want to make it spicy? another $2... a bowl of ramen can potentially get over $20! Ê - Noodles were thin, slightly starchy and overcooked. Not the squiggly ramen noodles I like! - Pork chasu was tough and lacked flavour. I only took one bite and did not have any desire for more. - Soft boiled egg was overcooked. - Long wait! ÊI don't mind waiting over an hour for good food but I didn't find this to be the case here. - The only thing I did enjoy was the broth which was thick and quite flavourful. The pork buns were good. ÊGood amount of meat and fatty bits. ÊSpicy Ê and super tasty. ÊHowever, again, it was overpriced (2 for $9).

I'm not going to add too much to this review because there are already 2000+ reviews on here. ÊBut here's my short two cents on this cool ramen joint. ÊI've been here twice and I've only gotten the Akamaru Modern ramen, so I'm sorry if my review seems rather incomplete! Wait times are ridiculous on the weekends - expect an hour or more wait, especially if you have more than 2 people in your party! ÊI did go with a friend right after work and got there around 6:15pm, and our wait time was only like 10 minutes! ÊSo beat the after work crowd by coming in around 6pm on weekdays.... is my advice. Akamaru Modern ramen's broth is super thick and creamy, just the way I like my soups. ÊThere are small chunks of garlic in the soup, which make it smell wonderful. ÊThis bowl made me appreciate ramen again, because I'm more of an udon person myself. ÊI don't order any of the extras and just eat the noodles and soup. ÊThat sufficiently keeps me full! You WILL be sitting next to people you don't know if your party is small (like under 3 people). ÊThey will seat you at the long tables with everyone else who have parties of 1-2. ÊSo if you're not comfortable with that, I suggest you bring more friends so you can snag a bigger table!

I would like to believe that I am quite the ramen connoisseur. I've tried almost every ramen establishment with high ratings in SoCal and I've created a mental ramen ranking and compare new bowls of ramen to my esteemed list. Therefore, I had to give Ippudo a try during my last trip to NYC. Even if that meant that I would have to walk 2 miles in the cold after shopping and enjoy dinner by myself. Luckily, because I was the only one in my party I got seated almost right away at the bar. I heard other parties of 2+ having a wait time of 2 hours or more. Yikes! The bar outside was PACKED with people waiting to be seated. Even some sitting on the floor. I assume they came in a big group so you know that's a big NO-NO during peak hours. I was seated at the bar and I knew what I had to get--the Akuramaru Modern and fish buns. The ramen was definitely worth all the hype. I loved the broth so much and it was very different from the ramens I've had back at home. The black sauce made the soup dark and very rich in flavor. The fish bun was also very delicious. I noticed the hard work and care the chefs in front of me were putting into all the dishes they were making. They put A LOT of thought and effort into the presentation of the dish as well as the taste. I also loved the diversity of the workers and chefs. They didn't hide their non-Japanese chefs in the back like other restaurants. The decor inside was very modern and dark. I was very surprised to see such a fancy decor for ramen, a staple I can get at a Japanese market food court back in California. Unfortunately, the price definitely matched the swanky decor. Everything wowed me about Ippudo except the price, making it 4.5 stars. Ramen for $14?? I understand that it was quite amazing but I pay $8 for ramen that is equally amazing back at home. Well I guess it's NYC and you pay for the ambiance as well. Regardless, I will be back. It was definitely worth the 2 mile trek and solo dinner.

Ippudo (& fellow Yelpers), you have done me proud. ÊI am so happy to have finally experienced the YUM-ness that is Ippudo. Ê The ramen portions are HUGE (and with the $2 kae-dama, you definitely won't be going hungry). ÊI sampled the Akamaru Modern, Tori Ramen, Miso Ramen, & Karaka Miso Ramen (supposed to be spicier). ÊThe winner(s) hands down were the Miso Ramen and the Karaka Miso Ramen - my preference being the Karaka Miso Ramen for its extra spice kick. Ê Zuke Maguro Tapas (Lightly marinated fresh tuna with seasoned avocado sauce): Fresh & tasty, highly recommended! ÊThe only sad part is that it's very small portions so I only got one piece :'(. Ê Shrimp Spring Roll (Fried spring rolls filled with shrimp, avocado, cream cheese, served with wasabi mayo sauce and nori-salt): This tasted good, but I wouldn't consider it one of the mandatory items to try during your visit. Ê Tako Wasabi ( fresh chopped raw baby octopus in fresh chopped wasabi sauce): I was really hesitant to try this, but then curiosity got the better of me and I caved in. ÊReally glad I did though because it was AMAZING and fresh. ÊThe wasabi definitely gives it a very nice kick, but it wasn't overwhelming. Ê Maguro Tataki (lightly seared tuna accented with daikon, avocado, and grapefruit): I ordered this with a side of rice per the server's recommendation. ÊThe tuna was extremely fresh and I would've been equally happy if they had given me just that on a plate to eat. ÊThe sauce that it lays on is really refreshing and the server recommended that I toss it with my side of rice, but my rice was occupied by the Karaka Miso Ramen broth (this combination tastes even better than the ramen noodles in my opinion). ÊDid I just go there?! ÊYESSS I did! Server - AWESOME & quick, yet very attentive as well. ÊHe had forgotten about my request for lemons until the end of the meal (I didn't mind) because he still brought them out. ÊAlso, thumbs-up to you for recommending the Maguro Tataki. My only complaints are their insane wait time (1.5 hours!) and the small portions, but it's so worth it!!! ÊWill I be returning for a future visit? ÊHELLS YEAH!

I have to admit when I walked in and saw that most of the staff were white people peppered with a few Mexicans yelling and speaking in Japanese I wasn't too sure on how good the ramen would be but looks can be deceiving. I just think it was a tad too pricey at $15 Êfor a bowl of Ramen and $17 for the tray which includes a very small side salad and a side dish that I ended up going with (which is a better deal). I chose the fried chicken over rice which was pretty tasty. The side salad was the loser of the bunch, it look like it had retired and planned to moved to Florida all shriveled up like that. On to the soup. I'm more of a Pho guy and I've just recently started getting into ramen that's not "on top" if you know what I mean *cough* poor *cough*. So out of the few times I've had ramen this is definitely the best I've ever had. I ordered the Karake-Men ramen and if you love spicy you will love this. The cabbage was a nice touch and the pork was melt in your mouth delicious. I will definitely be coming back and next time I see white people speaking Japanese I'll feel a bit more comfortable.

Got at the restaurant at 4:30 for the 5Pm opening. Was probably around the 6th or 7th in line. Bay the time 5pm rolled around, there was close to 60 ppl lined up for this restaurant. The food was really good, the soup broth was absolutely delicious and the same goes for their appetizers. I dont know if it is truly worthy a 2 hour wait though. If you want the best dining experience, I'd say go for when they open and show up early.

The pork on their AGAMADU MODERN is the best I've tried over any. Noodles and broth... delicious but there are others who can rival. The 1.5 hour wait simply makes it not worth all the hype. They play good music though.

Came here for the first time last year with my brother, and despite the lack of reservation-taking and the expected wait, I've been back numerous times. For starters, I love the almost classy underground atmosphere and the japanese shouts when you are getting seated. Appetizer: Always, always ALWAYS the pork buns. I actually like these better than Momofuku's, but both are fabulous. Ramen: The first time I was here, I had the Akamaru Modern ramen. Nice, thick, flavorful broth. Kept me intrigued for another visit. Every time after that, I got the Tori Ramen. I'm a fan of its thinner yet still flavorful broth, and I always request house-made hot sauce to go with it. I love spicy food. :) I recently went to Momofuku noodle bar, and it was yummy, but after Ippudo, I was underwhelmed. Their desserts always look promising, but after some yummy after dinner green tea, I'm ready to be rolled out... all the way to Sundaes and Cones 2 blocks away. I recommend this place.

I have wanted to try Ippudo for a very very long time but have never had the patience to wait out...well the wait. ÊFortunately, on a cold afternoon while waiting for Maha to finish work Nelly and I had a fantastic idea...and it involved ramen! ÊWe walked to Ippudo and were quoted a 40 minute wait. ÊMaha walked in and a few moments later we were seated. ÊWe immediately ordered sake and Sapporo and decided to start with the famous pork buns and be adventurous and hit up the octopus sashimi. ÊThe minimalist yet somehow adventurous decor, coupled with the Japanese greetings were actually quite reminiscent of Tokyo Ramen houses and made me feel all warm and fuzzy. We each ordered our own ramen, making it our own version of special, ÊI got the classic katsu broth with braised belly, bamboo shoots, garlic infused oil and red miso. ÊNelly and Maha opted for ginger and more classic miso with the good old pork belly. I mean what can I say that the ten million reviews before me have not eloquently iterated. Ê I can tell you that I now LOVE octopus sashimi. I can tell you that no one has ever really made a pork bun before but they are all big fat liars. Ê I can also tell you that I understand why families in Japan cook the broth for ramen for generations and pride themselves over secret recipes for the rich depth is beyond description and was rich and comforting in ways salt and fat alone cannot lend to a dish. Ê Conclusion: just go. Dont go starving. Wait. Order all of the above in a dozen combinations. Eat. Be satisfied. Onagaishimasss!!!

This is the best ramen I've had in the states. ÊIt's pretty expensive (especially considering you can get a whole box of ramen at the supermarket for the price you pay) but it's worth it. ÊThe wait is pretty crazy so be ready. ÊThe service I had was really good, no problems. Ê I started off with the Hirata buns which I recommend. ÊI tried the Shiromaru Hakata Classic ramen which was really good too. I would love to visit this place again.

If you're from LA, you're not missing anything - IMHO, Daikokuya is way better than Ippudo. That being said, Ippudo is probably the second best ramen place I've been to in the US. What makes Daikokuya better, you may ask? Well, it's really everything - the broth, the noodles, the melt-in-your-mouth pork, the egg.... I will give points to Ippudo for space and atmosphere - like most places in New York, it's very trendy and can accommodate large groups, whereas Daikokuya has all the atmosphere of a dive and can handle groups of 4-6 at the largest (and that's a stretch). I was able to sample three of the ramen dishes, thanks to my generous in-laws. Here's the run-down: Akamaru Modern: They do this really well, and if you can only order one dish, this should be it. The broth has a nice fullness to it. I was a bit disappointed with the noodles in all the ramen soups - they were more like somen noodles (thin, straight, white, not holding the taste of the soup very much) than the ramen noodles I'm accustomed to (thicker, yellower, chewier, retaining the broth). Karaka Miso Ramen: This is the spicy version, and it's pretty good, though I think Santouka's is better. Shiromaru Hakata Classic: Good broth, but the Modern is better. The Hirata Pork Buns were also quite good - more flavorful than spicy. The bun is similar to the bun you would get if you ordered Peking duck at a Chinese restaurant. Hamachi Carpaccio: Yeah, this is definitely not a sushi restaurant - don't order this. It wasn't spicy, and the yellowtail tasted fishy - never a good thing. Consider yourself warned. Service was excellent. We had 8 adults and 6 children under the age of 6 in our party, so you can imagine the amount of chaos and special orders involved. For example: Could we get another order of the buns? No pork, just the buns. For the kids. FYI, it's $2/bun. They also cut the pork buns into multiple pieces and brought out extra bowls so everyone could share.

As a person grown up to love noodles, I must say that they were pretty good. But Êif you are a party of 3 or 5, forget it. The restaurant, designed for communal seating, only seats tables of 2 and 4 in a prompt and timely fashion. Any other seating arrangement you will be waiting for centuries. Even if a couple arrives way after you have, they will be in and out the door way before you are seated. We went knowing we had to wait, but after seeing couple after couple entering and exiting before we even got our chance i began questioning the hostesses method of wait times and seating. After kindly asking her why she was doing what she wAs doing, her rude , unprofessional and lack of consideration of customer service put ,e on the edge. To our experience even worse, we ended up with a greedy, selfish and inconsiderate waiter who believed that placing a bowl of noodles in front of you was fantastic service. Coming from the service industry myself, a tip is earned and reflects not ony your service, but the experience the restaurant gave. Well after we gave what we thought was an appropriate tip for our poor experience, our server complained about his tip. Saying that our poor experience at the front of the house had nothing to do with him and that he was a poor student trying to make a living and that he wasnt being paid enough by the restaurant. Well dear greedy server, Tip is earned not deserved - it's not only about you, but how the whole restaurant treats you You have the right to ask if there was something wrong with the service, not to ask for more money If you have an issue of being underpaid. That is a discussion between you and your manager, clearly someone is making money and it certainly isn't you If you aren't happy with your tip, then give it back. Sincerely A disappointed customer

After all the reviews and curiosity, we stayed online for what seemed like forever. But every minute waiting was worth it. Ordered the pork and chicken buns but the main course, the Miso ramen. I was drooling and had a hard-on at the same time, which was weird. Best place in the city. Eat here before you kick the bucket.

Solid four stars. Minus one star because I didn't like the noodles that much. I ordered the Akamaru Modern (The original "Tonkotsu" noodle soup topped with Ippudo's secret "Umami Dama" miso paste, pork chashu, cabage, kikurage, scallions, and fragrant garlic oil). The broth was so yummy - savory and tasty. ÊThe noodles were a bit thin for me. I like noodles with more of a bite. ÊThe waitress also convinced me to get the pork buns which were very tasty, but not as good as what the reviews say. This place was swarming with people on a Monday night. A table for four would have been an hours and 15 minutes. Lucky (or unlucky for me) I was a party of one and sat at the bar. ÊZero minute wait. :) Glad I tried it - definitely recommended... but maybe not worth the wait.

Avoided this place for years because just felt it would be bad. Instincts were right. This place is hateful on so many levels. It's not like any ippudo in japan and really does the name a disservice. Loud music booms in a hazy, dark, club-like environment filled wall to wall with an impatient and overly lubricated crowd. Don't expect to have a conversation or even be able to hear your name when it finally is called. Waited 45 minutes and was done eating in 20 minutes. Ê It's not a ramen-ya. There is ramen on the menu, but it's more a generic japanese restaurant with assorted food options. The tonkatsu ramen does not even approach the quality of ippudo's ramen in japan. It doesn't taste the same and just isn't good enough to merit any sort of wait. The tiny amount of noodles included with the standard ramen bowl weren't cooked enough and they charge extra for egg and other toppings that are included at their branches in japan. Ippudo is a chain and there should be some sort of consistency. ÊIt's like being asked to pay $2 to add cheese to a big mac at McDonald's in japan. Most staff were professional enough but nowhere near what would be described as friendly and the waitress who took our order was outright hostile.

My favorite Japanese Ramen in the city so far. ÊI've had Ramen at 4 other places in the city and this can be considered my favorite place. ÊI've never been the biggest fan of Japanese Ramen but Ippudo made me think otherwise. ÊI was a little hesitant at first because of the hype but it didn't seem to disappoint me. I've been here twice and both times we had to wait for about an hour. ÊNo biggie since there were awesome happy hour deals going on at the bar ($3 sapporo light drafts). ÊSo waiting at the bar while sipping on some yum cold beer right after work with your friends made that hour fly by. Ê I personally liked the open kitchen and the huge cheesy tree hovering over the tables. ÊI liked the cheesiness of the servers yelling "ilashiamaseh" every time someone new walked into the dining area. ÊI liked their pork buns althought they were frozen, premade and heated up before serving. ÊI liked their version of the pork tofu dish that was biting off the Korean stew "soondooboo". ÊAnd overall.. I LOVED their original ramen. ÊDEEEE-lish. Ê Been here twice and will go back.. especially for their Sapporo light deals and a pork bun.

Damn delicious and well worth the wait. ÊThe last time we went, we had an appetizer (rock shrimp?) breaded and deep fried, served with a spicy mayo sauce, two different ramens (yes, go ahead and get the egg) and desert, which was the best mille fleur (?) ÊI've ever had. Each layer of the wonderful crepe-like cake was perfectly golden brown, and the cream in between the layers was just sweet enough. Divine.

The ramen was good, but I didn't notice too much of a difference than the one I had at Minca a few weeks ago. I guess maybe I'm just not a ramen aficionado and don't see a reason to wait 2 hours and pay twice as much for a bowl of soup. ÊThe pork buns are what I would come back for, but I'd probably just order them at the bar as the ramen was just not worth 2 hours of my time.

The ramen is some of the best i have ever had in my life; however, my only complaint is that they do not let you take your left overs...

As far as tonkotsu goes, I don't there is a better broth in the city. If there is, I am yet to taste it and I have been to a few. Both the akamaru modern and the shiromaru hakata classic are fantastic. The broth is the star, the noodles themselves - not so much. Lately I've been getting disappointed with the cha shu that they put in their ramen. ÊAs the wait gets longer, the slices seem to be getting leaner and to get real slices of meat you have to order the kakuni on the side for an extra $4. So we are talking about a $18 ramen here - a bit too steep... but what can i say? I am sucker for the broth so I keep going back. The pork buns are a must have as well.

Been here a few times. Everytime there was a long wait. If you ever crave that warm slippery stringy sensation in your mouth and also in your pants? ÊGo here. ÊWarm slippery strings of noodles will warm your taste buds, and your pants will also be warm, and perhaps slippery and moist as well, when you see the bill. ÊThe total bill itself is not high, but it's way to friggin expensive for Ramen, which is considered cheap eats in Japan and should be cheap eats anywhere else. Noodles (even the fancy one) should not cost more than $10, that is the thumb rule in Japan. But it's as good as Ramen outside of Japan can get. ÊOne less star for the price, which also accounts for laundry cost the following day, and the feeling of being ripped off everytime.

With two thousand plus reviews I don't know why I'm even wasting my time writing this but here goes... First of all anyone who thinks the pork buns are better than Momofuku is fucking high! ÊOr maybe they work here. ÊEither way, and I'm not joking, between the lettuce and glob of mayo if I closed my eyes I could have been eating something from McDonald's. ÊMy girlfriend agreed. ÊVery disappointing. But this is a ramen joint, not a pork bun joint so I'm not going to further harp on the lackluster pork buns but I had to get that off my chest. The ramen, I had the Shiromaru Hakata Classic and I have to admit, it was fantastic! ÊI like mine a bit spicy but I wanted to try their staple dish unmolested for my first time. ÊNext time I'll order it with the Bakudan spicy paste to give it that little kick that I prefer. The big spoon was odd at first but I learned to love it, no worrying about it slipping into the bowl! I'll be back, for the ramen only. ÊI want some right now actually.

I came here last Thursday with two other people right at 6pm, and they were able to seat us within a few minutes. ÊThis was both good and bad, as the happy hour (2 for 1 Kirin and Sapporo) is only good at the bar until 8pm, and they can't transfer checks from the bar to your table. ÊSo we were all double-fisting on the way to our seats... quite an impression to make! ÊIt's ok though - the hostess was really nice about waiting for us to pay our tab. ÊIn general, the people who worked at Ippudo were fantastic - really friendly and welcoming. The food was also pretty great. ÊI got the Akamaru Modern with the soft-boiled egg. ÊI think if I'd ordered the extra pork it would have been too much... as it was, with the two beers and the brothy noodles, plus the (excellent!) pork buns and edamame (with delicious salt for sprinkling on top) we got for the table, I can't remember being so full in my life. ÊMy friend had ordered a side of spicy sauce, and I dumped some of that in my noodles, which added a great kick. ÊI think I might have gotten sick of the broth if it weren't for the extra spiciness though. ÊAlso, my egg was hard-boiled, which was disappointing... I love soft-boiled eggs so I was particularly looking forward to it, and you'd think they'd get the cooking level right when it's an added extra thing you have to request and pay for. Ê I do think the prices are ridiculous - I ended up paying $16 for a bowl of noodles and egg and broth. ÊBut hey, there are tons of people willing to pay, as evidenced by the long wait times, and congratulations to them for doing so well in a city where it's tough to create a viable business out of a restaurant. ÊI'll definitely go back, especially in cold winters.

Why is this place always packed at night? Why would anyone wait up to 1 hour to eat ramen that takes literally 5 minutes to make, and maybe 10 minutes to eat? The rich broth is chock full of good hearty MSG, I merely go because of peer pressure. If it weren't for my friends who love this place, I would not have gone as many times as I have. I do enjoy the hustle and bustle of the atmosphere, the decor and of course the MSG mostly. The ramen is not bad either. But is it worth an hour long wait? I don't think so especially not during the winter and if you're not a smoker

This Place has the best Ramen in the city. Truly a place to go and try at least once for any foodie. There is almost ALWAYS a wait here, whether the place is packed or not. I've ventured inside after a 40+ min. wait to find there were at least 3 other open tables. HOWEVER, the wait is well worth it. Great tasting ramen and broth will take away any lingering feeling of the long uneventful wait you had to endure. The selection is pretty wide and unique, compared to other ramen places in the area. They also have season/event special ramens from time to time. Keep your eyes open for those if you do come here. The service is good, fast paced and the inside decor feels homely with a nice Japanese feel to it. DO: Come here for the food and the experience DO NOT: Come here with large groups, you will be waiting.

This was THE place that I had to eat at on my trip to NYC. When we arrived there was a 2 hour wait which was to be expected so we put our names down and came back when they called. We ordered the pork buns for our appetizer and they were orgasmic! ÊI ordered the Akamaru Modern with the Nitamago (boiled egg) and Kakuni (braised pork belly), while my friends ordered the special ramen (forgot the name), Tori Ramen, and Karaka Miso Ramen. The favorite of the night was the Tori Ramen. The broth was extremely delicious! It tasted like sweet and creamy chicken soup. The Akamaru Modern ramen was good; however, after a while I found the pork broth to be a bit salty. I really enjoyed the pork belly but it was a tad overcooked. For dessert we had the Matcha Brulee (green tea creme brulee); however it was nothing to rave about unfortunately. I was unable to taste any green tea. We loved the decor especially the artist's resume. Staff was really friendly and attentive. Definitely will be hitting this place up again next time I am in NYC!

First Impression: The very first thing that you will notice going in Ippudo is the length of the waiting line (yes, sometimes it may go OUT THE DOOR), and it's very difficult to say "Yes I will wait" to the hostesses IF it is your first time. Experiences: But I have to give you the heads up that their ramens are DANGEROUSLY GOOD! I've gotten a Akamaru Modern the first time I've been there, and the 'First Bite' brought me to heaven (still craving it now). Make sure the way you eat includes a spoonful of broth because that's what make the ramen extraordinarily full of taste. The ramen strands are perfectly made; not stretchy, not soggy, not too soft, but just right. The TOFU appetizer was simply delicious with the soup/broth which it came along with. I've also ordered a plate of Ribs and this is the first time I've ever seen a Rib slide off its bone slenderly and beautifully. The texture of this Ribs is just amazing, and there's practically no words that describes it until it is experienced though your taste buds. Dessert: I recommend the crepe cake because it was one of the most unique dessert I've seen through their menu. For the other ones, it seems just too original. The crepe cake had many layers, and when you bite into it, you'll feel each layers drop into your tongue, and its' just great. -- Although the food inside are great, there are barriers that frighten costumers away; that would be the waiting time (I've waited an hour and 30 minutes the second time I went there). I believe this restaurant should receive no criticism against their queuing line. It only really demonstrate how delicious their ramens are and only should receive the rightful praise. If you plan to wait, that's alright because the hostess will CALL you once it's your turn if you plan to go out and walk around for a while. The price is another story for selected amount of people. Ramen can cost ~13$+, appetizers are also at a price CLOSE to that of ramen around ~8$+, however there are some cheaper ones. I believe this price is not too expensive because Ippudo is in the city after all. 13$+ ramen seems reasonable compared to other restaurants. It's reasonably not overpriced. I GUARANTEE YOU, the WAIT (if you plan to wait) and the PRICE (it's definitely affordable) will WORTH it.

My most visited restaurant in the city and it's for a reason. This is one of the few places where you can have as much as 2hr wait, and people will do it because they love the food here so much. I've been hooked since the first visit last year. My favorite items to order: Akamaru Modern (Ramen) and the Pork Buns. You cannot go wrong when ordering those two items. The "Modern" has the perfect combination of flavors, and I love leaving the pork in the soup for last. :) The pork buns are so delicious. Soft buns with melt-in-your-mouth bbq pork and their signature mayo. My mouth is watering. The service here is excellent as well. Servers are very attentive and friendly. Bus boys/runners are on top of things and always clear your table when you're done with a plate and you'll always have a full glass of water. Can't say enough how great this place is.

Ê I wish I could pick one thing off the menu to order but I really cant. Ê ÊEverything was amazing, I would recommend this to anyone who really digs asian cuisine.

Apparently, the wait here can get pretty long, but we must have hit the off-peak jackpot because there was only one other table being served when we came here for dinner. This was literally the BEST ramen I have ever had - all I could think about for the following week was how Philly doesn't have a legit ramen-ya and by then I was already craving another bowl of the Akamaru Modern. Yes, it's pricey, but the broth itself is worth every penny! Oh, and the Hirata buns were pretty tasty too.

Got there around 8:45pm on a Sunday night and waited an hour to be seated. No complaints! The ramen was delicious, savory and hot! Perfect for a cold New York evening. The pork buns were mediocre though. They were tasty, but nothing mind-blowing. Texture of the bread was a bit too chewy. Fun hustle-and-bustle atmosphere with a cool interior layout. Will definitely come back.

I've been here several times and never much liked it. ÊMy reasons, however, may not apply to everyone: a) I don't eat pork, and b) I don't like mushrooms. ÊAlas, every bowl here is pork-based except for one veg bowl which is--you guessed it--all mushroom. Ê The chef says no substitutions: no beef, no chicken, no way no how. ÊTo which I say: bah humbug, Mr. Chef! ÊGo shove your noodles... into other people's mouths. I did try one of the pork bowls once, planning on giving the meat to a friend and trying the broth and veggies--and I didn't think the broth was all that tasty. ÊI'm in the extreme minority here, apparently. Ê In Ippudo's favor, I'll say this: the service is excellent, and they serve a fantastic Japanese beer--Ginka Kogen?--that I've never found anywhere else. ÊDefinitely try it. ÊIt's the one in a blue bottle with a reindeer on it.

I really luv his place. I willingly wait 2-3 hours for a table....at first i thought WHY would this ever be acceptable? then i finally got a table and i realized. because it's delectable, flavorful, and simple at the same time. also because if you time it right you can satisfy a little of your starving, ready to pass out hunger with a pork bun or wings (which are fantastic apps!)..while anxiously hoping you didn't miss your name being called. i've only been here during the cold winder months, but i think when it's warmer (or not 10 degrees) it's actually nice to wander around and the shops in the east village during your wait. ramen i've had here: -Akamaru Modern- my fav- i highly recommend this for your 1st time! -Shiromaru Hakata Classic- not bad..not as flavorful as i would like -Kogashi Miso Ramen- good..but very rich & fatty...in a good way =) -Miso Ramen- OK other apps -Shishito Ê(fried japanese peppers)- i didn't like these so much. it was too oily & not much to taste -pork buns- delicious! -wings- only 3 little guys...but very good as well -raw octopus in wasabi sauce- a must have! So far it's my top ramen place to date =)

This is a great noodle place that serves up some of the best ramen I've ever had here in the US or in Japan. The drawbacks are that it's a bit pricey and you are almost guaranteed a long wait. It's absolutely worth the trouble, though. Great flavors in the broth, and fresh-tasting ingredients overall. Highly recommended.

I don't speak Japanese but I'm pretty sure Ippudo translates to happiness in a bowl. We stopped in on a cold December day for lunch and must have just beat the crowd - we waited less than five minutes for a table but saw lines of people queued up as we were leaving. We ordered two different types of ramen and the pork buns to start. Everything was fantastic and rivaled Momofuku as the best ramen I've ever had. I normally love all things pork belly but decided to order the Shiromaru Hakata Classic (pork loin chashu instead of belly) and actually preferred it to the bite/slurp of Akamaru Modern (pork belly chashu) that I had. Ippudo is hyped to the gills but in my opinion, deservedly so. Get there early or be prepared for a long wait.

We came here twice, the first time for dinner and was told that there is a 1.5 hr wait... so we left. The second time we came for lunch, one of us arrived early but we still ended up waiting longer than they told us. They do not take reservation. It definitely is very inconvenient considering that they always have such a long wait... but sometimes we have better things to do in our lives... That was the biggest negative for me.. Now on to the food! May be the best ramen I had so far... I had the Akamaru Modern lunch set ( with chashu over rice). Both the ramen and the rice dish were delicious! but it was heavy!! The bowl was huge... it was so great at first but eventually I got so tired of it... I was ashamed that I didn't finish the ramen or the rice... :( Will try to order just the ramen next time, that is if I could stand the wait.. Overall pretty impressed, but man, is the wait scary...

Ate here with my cousin this past fall and I must say...Oishii!!! ÊMy cuz was really itchin' to try the NYC version since he used to teach in Japan and according to him the ramen is cheap and delicious there...go figure. The NYC Ippudo was pretty slammin' the night we went and we had to wait over an hour for a table, but I just showed him the sights and the hostess gave us a call when we were almost ready to be seated. Pretty cool of them. Ê The place is pretty swanky, and the servers were really nice and helpful. ÊEverything on the menu had some sort of meat in it, and with me being a vegetarian our waiter dipped into the "secret menu" for me and the chef whipped up a delicious bowl of vegi-ramen. I left full and happy and my cousin says it was good, but not as good as the Ippudo in the land of the rising sun.....especially since the prices in Japan are only a fraction of the cost of its NYC brethren. Oh well...I'm not flying to Tokyo anytime soon so I guess I'll have to make do with Ippudo NY!

Ramen was the perfect pit stop for lunch with the cold freezing and dry weather we suddenly got ourselves into it during our mini get-away. ÊHappily, we only had to wait for about 20 minutes, which was not bad at all! ÊAs we walked into the venue, we were greeted loudly by all the workers. ÊAlways delightful and so energetic those ramen workers are, especially when it is coming from pure Americans and not from Japanese workers :) . ÊThe decor was awesome for a ramen restaurant! ÊSo modern and so upscale compared to the ones in SF! The pork buns were delicious. ÊSoft and the pork with mayo and spices blended well together. ÊFor 2 buns though, it was quite costly, but this is NYC! I decided to order the Akamaru Modern since I love some garlic infused in my ramen bowl. ÊOf course, I had to order the extra side order of Nitamago that cost me $2 !! ÊThe noodles were a different version than what I usually eat. ÊThey were plentiful and had a great presentation. I am not sure if it is because everyone overhyped it for me, but since I've had my share of ramen around the Bay Area, everytime I have Orenchi in Santa Clara, it hits the spot perfectly. ÊWhen I had Ippudo, they didn't have the same effect on me!

Over-priced and a ridiculous minimum-of-an-hour-long wait (that is imposed even while there are empty tables to be had) screams POSER all over this joint. ÊI think all 3 times I've been there, I've always left wondering why on earth I stayed on that line for that experience. ÊRamen isn't bad but I couldn't say I didn't have similar at lower prices. ÊPork buns are good but I've become a vegetarian ever since and I'm not so adamant about having Asian-influenced desserts when there are less expensive options within a 3-block radius. I always got the urge to try and talk the other poor suckers on line to leave while their appetite and happy outlook on life were still intact. ÊThen I realized this is a choice that each person must make for him/herself of whether or not s/he wants to buy into the hype.

If you haven't had high class ramen and only think of ramen as cup noodles, you've been seriously missing out in life. In my book, Ippudo lives up to the hype! the 45 minute wait was definitely worth it as a friend and I just strolled around the corner. Presumptuous thoughts going in: one of the best ramen places in NYC known for its broth, better than Momofuku Noodle Bar. We ordered their samurai short rib and their akamaru modern ramen. Short ribs were smothered with teriyaki sauce and came with side sauces of an orange, miso, and spicy sauce. The flavors worked really well and my palette was really happy and saturated. Transitioning to a miso based Akamaru ramen was perfect to wash out the richness of the teriyaki. I could really tell the broth was well made - perhaps soaked in pork shoulder for hours. That mixed with miso and fragrant sesame oil that made for a very rich, distinctly flavored, and memorable broth. I was so happy when they let you have a $2 noodle refill! So sure the noodles aren't the best in the world, but they were soft and delicate enough to be satisfying. They even spotted us with free green tea which helped considering it was raining outside. Lastly, I got the green tea creme brulee - delicious! Having green tea ice cream on top of creme brulee was freaking genious. I'm all about hot and cold collision experiences for deserts and I must say this was quite satisfying. Overall I left with a very big smile on my face and I totally encourage everybody to check it out.

Yet again, another ramen-ya that doesn't meet my expectations. When my friend and I arrived we waiting in the front and ordered a bottle of sake. The sake was amazingly good, as it should be for $45. The bartender was really nice and accommodating of our needs. As for the actual dining experience, the staff was very nice and courteous. They were very knowledgeable of the food and made excellent recommendations. I ordered the tori ramen, and it was good overall, but not the stellar dish of ramen I was expecting for such a crowded place-and for the price! I just have to say nothing has beat Orenchi back home... which I suppose for me is an amazing thing. While in the city, I think I'll just stick with Ramen Setagaya.

The ramen is still as good as I remember, although the lunch menu is a scaled down version of what it was on my last visit. ÊThey have a new combination menu for lunch, which lets you add a salad and side of rice with a protein for 3 bucks which is not bad for this place. ÊThey also got rid of those horrendous "L" shaped chairs in the communal area in the center, which is a plus in my book. ÊDefinitely a must visit for ramen lovers.

The first thing you need to know is that there is a long waiting list, and plan accordingly. ÊI actually didn't dine here the first time because the wait time was about 3 hours and no way i was going to hang around for that long. ÊAlso, they do not take reservations over the phone. ÊHowever, I called and got friendly with the girl, and told her my story about my first experience, and luckily after she spoke to her boss, gave me a reservation over the phone. ÊI was excited. We were checking in, but there was a girl in front of us, and long and behold it was Anne Hathaway, she was very nice and heard she's a regular. ÊShe's shorter than I thought, and HOT in person :) We had a great Japanese waiter, and pretty much gave us a history lesson on RAMEN and Japan, he was very friendly and informative. I had the Akamaru Modern, a pretty much a must have if its your first time. ÊAlso had pork buns, it was good but the ramen was better, and comparable to fat buddah buns, which i think are amazing for some reason. I totally get the hype and the demand for this place. ÊGreat food, ambiance, and most importantly amazing ramen and friendly staff, we felt at home. We'll definitely be going back again.

I went here months ago, but forgot to write a review. Because the meal isn't completely fresh in my mind, I'll stick with more general comments. The pork buns were very tasty and had us considering seconds. Ramen was enjoyed by all and I was pleased with the flavor of the broth - not too salty, not too bland. A good balance. Weighing the food against the wait-time means this was a pleasant experience but I'm not planning to rush back.

I never had Japanese Ramen so a friend suggested we go to Ippudo two days ago. ÊAnd I'm glad she did. We met around 7pm on a Monday and had to wait about 20 minutes.. on a Monday. ÊIt's pretty packed inside as are most places worth eating in NYC. ÊWe ordered an appetizer of deep-fried pork belly wrapped around asparagus. ÊI don't know what the dipping sauce was made of but it was delicious. We both ordered ramen, my friend had the Shiromaru which had a slightly cloudy broth (maybe had a little miso). ÊI tried some and it was pretty good. ÊI had the Tori which is a clear broth with pork loin, spinach, bamboo, and some daikon. ÊI loved the Tori Ramen. ÊWe topped both ramen soups with a poached egg (I grew up eating ramen with a poached egg), egg with ramen is nostalgic for me so I consider it standard fare- unless you don't like eggs, of course. ÊI also ordered the kakuni topping (braised pork belly, another nostalgic flavor for me) which actually came on the side (more on that later). The service was great, the staff was courteous and on top of things (in a good way). ÊGoing back to the kakuni- when my food came out, the chef came over to tell me why it was in a side dish. ÊHe explained that the Tori had a lighter flavor than the heavier kakuni so he didn't want to mix them. ÊHe wanted me to be able to try the Tori first to get its flavor and leave it up to me whether I wanted to mix them. ÊI'm glad he did that because I wound up keeping them separate since they each had different distinct flavors. ÊHad he mixed them, the original Tori flavor would've been overpowered by the kakuni and been lost. ÊThe Tori was amazingly light yet very flavorful. My mouth is watering a little writing this review, it's a good thing I'm heading back down to NYC this weekend. ÊI will definitely head to Ippudo for one of the meals. Highly recommend this place if you like noodles in soup.

Um. Woooo. Breathe. Breathe. I'm trying very hard to stay cool, calm, and objective about this review. BUT IT'S SO FREAKIN GOOD I CAN'T HOLD IN MY EXCITEMENT. All the reviews are true, their TRUE. Ippudo's ramen is heaven in a bowl. Every sip of broth, every mouthful of noodles, is absolute heaven. I don't even like ramen that much. Well, of course I do NOW. I believe that Êyou could come here with any question in the universe in mind, and after you ate, everything would become clear. I wasn't sure which one to order, luckily since I was with a group, I tried them all! That's what friends are for! The Modern was the best. The broth was rich but not too dark and thick like the Kogashi Miso. The noodles were thin and soft, whereas the Miso has thicker noodles. The porkbelly wasn't really the star of the show but it was a good compliment with all of the flavors in the Modern. The Kogashi Miso was also good and it was a great combination with the Modern because it tasted completely different. This one was much thicker and darker. It was a little less smooth, dotted with the slight bitterness of miso. The soft boiled egg is sooooo good. The yolk is like rich jelly. Next time I want to add a poached egg too. Also, even though you only have ramen on your mind, stray just a moment to try the Hirata buns which have a giant, fatty slab of pork belly with spicy hoisin-y sauce. Get the pork, the chicken is good but lame in comparison. This is worth a 2 and a half hour wait. Yes it is. Just go snack and drink somewhere else in the village and then come back when they call you. It's worth any price.

One of the reasons my boyfriend and I made a trip to NYC was to try out this ramen place. Seeing that there was over 2000 reviews, he really wanted to try the ramen here. The ramen here are definitely worth the wait. When we walked into the restaurant, the hostess told us it was a 45 min wait, and since we had deliberately come for ramen, we put our name on the list. However, due to the fact that there was only 2 of us, the wait time was really only about 20 mins. Service is pretty fast, as they really just want you to eat and go. We had ordered the spicy pork buns to start. They were good and definitely worth trying, but for us, it was a one time thing only. My boyfriend ordered the Akamaru Modern, 'The original tonkotsu' soup noodle with Ippudo's special sauce, pork belly chashu, cabbage, kikurage, scallions, miso paste & fragrant garlic oil, . It was one of the top ordered ramen. It was good, but I found the soup base a little too strong. I ordered the Tori Ramen, which was a salted ramen with chicken and pork broth, but served with half raw boiled egg, pork belly & spinach. This one had a cleaner, lighter taste. Although the ramen is pricey, it's definitely worth a try. We will be back to try some of the other ramens on the menu!!!

Now, I always see my friends checking-in to Ippudo when they're visiting NY and I always hear such great things. I should really stop hyping things up for myself. This review is coming from a girl that does not particularly like Japanese ramen. We missed our exit on the subway so we had to walk about 2-3 miles to get here in the cold (yes, I could've taken a taxi, but it was a big indulgent weekend. I needed to find room for excercise). Ramen sounded like a great plan for the brisk chilly weather.We didn't wait long, which seemed like the theme for me this past weekend. We were sat at a community table, seems to be common in New York. My girlfriend and I place an order for the pork buns, large sake, and 2 classic ramens. The pork buns were great. Well, in all honesty, it was my first pork bun ever, but I know when I like something. This was tasty and the pork wasn't too fatty. I acually prefer this bun over Momofuku's. Yes, I said it. For the ramen .. Good, solid, clean tasting ramen. Nothing to jump up and down about. I am not a big pork eater, so I took a bite of the pork and gave the rest to my friend. It had a bland, dry taste. The broth was creamy, but not fatty creamy, and tasted really clean. The noodles grabbed my attention because it wasn't the typical curly-like ramen noodle. The noodles were long, thin, and straight. 2 large hot sakes later, the broth was tasting better and better. Loved the pipping hot green tea at the end. I wouldn't wait the ridiculous wait that others have experienced to eat here.

Ippudo is in my mind a New York Foodie Must for both the local and the tourists. ÊIt's a great way to introduce anyone to the Art of Ramen When first moving into NYC 5 years ago I though of ramen as the college students thing of ramen, cheap noodles that come alive in water. Ê So the idea of going to a restaurant for ramen that cost money in dollar terms was not appealing. ÊAfter much research on YELP I realized that I should try it out. I ordered everything that yelpers recommended: Pork buns (5/5) Ramen (3.5/5) - ÊAkamaru ramen/I added siracha sauce to add a kick Venue (4.5/5) Dessert - Don't remember because it was not rememberable. One tip. ÊGet here on an odd time after the lunch rush or before the dinner rush. The lines is a bit deceiving, many put their names down and are not there to claim their spot. ÊI once came and they explained to me the wait was 1.5 hours, which was really 30 minutes. TIP: Pork buns can be bought at the bar, in the waiting section. ÊI come here just for the pork buns if I'm close to Astor Place. Ippudo introduced me the joys of ramen but the price is not worth the quality given.

So the argument goes on with what and where the best ramen place is. "Daikokuya is the best." "Foofootei the best" "NO NO Ajisen is the best!" "NO Ajisen sucks, Daikokuya is meh, Orochon is the best!!" There's also about fifteen different ramen places I've enjoyed while I was in Tokyo....and a lot of them were epic, but I can't recall their names (more than 4 syllables long) and of course, I can't review a place in Tokyo on Yelp. Ippudo ranks as the second best place I've ever had for Japanese ramen. This place was so good, we took not only one picture, but THREE pictures of our food. We came here with a party of four, and we just all had to try each other's bowl of Japanese goodness. If hyper-sensitive taste buds were a medical condition, this place can kill you. We ordered: Nakasu-Kawabata Shoyu Ramen (Special Ramen they have, not gonna be around forever so get it soon). I should have ordered this...it had tonkatsu pork, pickled ginger, garlic, and some sort of special soup base that has a fairly meaty broth-like finish to it. It also PROBABLY has crack, too. The noodles were perfect in "chewiness." I don't recall enjoying noodles that good, anywhere else. Shiromaru Hakata Classic. Your good ol' Shoyu based ramen with the usual: gingered pickles, sesame, shoyu broth and noodles. With the noodles, same as the Special...perfect! What made our trip here even more enjoyable was that we waited five minutes and got seated right away. The server was pretty helpful and friendly; he recommended us to a place called Prune when we asked him, "what's better than Shake Shack?" Stay tuned.

Went early and there was no wait. With the hype, I envisioned different things, and after finally going, I left happy and full. Ramen's such a big deal in the city now.. but I would have to say if I were just rating the pork buns alone, I would give them all 5 stars! A huge portion of ramen. With helpful advice, I got the akamaru modern, filling and flavorful, but pricey in my opinion. Overall, I enjoyed my large booth and I actually liked the random japanese yelling, added to the whole experience. Flashy decor was not what I envisioned, but a homey waiter who was insightful and knowledgeable balanced it out. Food was good - definitely a great lunch spot.

Pricey? Definitely Decor? Modern, "sophisticated," upbeat, very nice with the music booming in the background Pricey? Yes Expensive? Duh Did I mention that this is the most expensive ramen i've ever eaten? Did I wait long? Contrary to what other yelpers say, and to my own surprise, we showed up for lunch around 1230 and only waited for 5 minutes Anyways, pork buns (9 bucks for an order of 2 buns) = delicious, in fact, so delicious, we ordered 2 orders Akamura Modern with extra chasu and a soft boiled egg (19 bucks?! yea I ordered it) = fantastic. Its uncommon to find a restaurant that can properly SOFT BOIL an egg (maybe thats why adding the egg cost 2 dollars, and yes I was dumb enough, or at least curious enough, to order it). I've been to ramen houses in SF and LA, but this is by far the best I have every eaten. The noodles were cooked to perfection Al Dente, the broth was flavorful, but not overpowering/salty. The pork was not too fat, but still retained a lot of "fat" flavor. And did I mention the perfectly soft boiled egg? Probably. Was this place pricey? Yes definitely, Was the ramen and pork buns good enough to justify what they charge? Well...im sure part of what they charge is due to the hype, but im sure i can find some crazy justification for paying what i paid for that bowl of ramen and those two pork buns....

Ippudo Ramen tugs my taste buds into too many directions. I thought I sat down to eat Japanese food, but at the same time I tasted Chinese. The noodles are on the harder side. The Pork Buns were delicious! However at first glance I saw the white buns usually used to serve Peking Duck. I got really excited, confused and scared. I did not know how to feel. Where was my loyalty! I really like the atmosphere of this restaurant.

I'm going to make this short and simple. After trying countless times (and failing) to get a table at Ippudo, a friend and I just decided to suck it up and wait. We left our names for a table of two (the smaller your party... they faster you'll get your seats) and proceeded to wait approximately 2 hours. Despite the wait, once we got our tables- the service was pretty damn amazing and surprisingly quick. We got our ramen in about 10 to 15 minutes and our waitress was super nice. The restaurant had a cozy (but spacious) atmosphere and played great music, though it may be a little too loud for a romantic date. I ordered the Karaka Miso Ramen, I like it spicy... and unfortunately- this just wasn't spicy enough for me. The soup was tasty... a bit heavier than I expected and the noodles were okay... I expected something amazing after such a long wait... I've had better ramen... but it was good and I was pretty full after the meal (the portions were pretty generous... but then again, I'm a little asian girl). It's a great place to dine with your friends, I just wouldn't wait two hours again.

Ippudo, you cost a pretty penny for ramen that is definitely above average, but not worthy of more than three stars. ÊThe noodles were fresh, but they were very stringy, and didn't do that great of a job soaking up the flavor from the broth, which was delicious. Ê NYC should really get a Santouka ramen (or hope that Santouka comes there). ÊNow that's a good bowl of ramen.

Came for lunch, I got the Akamaru Modern set which is the bowl of ramen, a bowl of rice with your choice of topping (I got Fried Chicken) and a salad. Hands down, best ramen ive ever had. I was skeptical of everybody on here so I wanted to see for myself. I did nothing but fool myself, the ramen was, dare I say, godlike. Definitely get the Akamaru Modern if its your first time here, my friends got Shoyu and the Karaka. I liked the Karaka but couldnt help but feel that ive had better Shoyu elsewhere. Though the Akamaru Modern pretty much kills it, best ramen Ive had anywhere! And like everybody says, the Hirata Pork Buns are mouth watering. We also got drinks which consisted of Shochu cocktails and Sapporo Drafts. The waiter and the manager? were kind enough to come over and show us how to squeeze the fresh grapefruits (even though we already had an idea of what we were doing). Although I believe the Shochu cocktail was mixed with water, as well as the added grapefruit just to note. But none the less it was very good, the grapefruit gives a nice touch to the Shochu. And last but not least, I wasnt crazy about the Salad. The salad itself was good, but I think they used a wasabi ginger dressing. I dont know, to each his own on this one but I dont think the Wasabi complemented the salad very well. Oh and you can also see them hand make the ramen when you go to the bathroom downstairs. And the decor of the restaurant is very classy as well. And I suppose I should note, we got here at 12pm to literally NO WAIT. When we left around 1:15pm there was about 10-15 people waiting. Do yourself the favor and get here early. The earlier the better. And this was only lunch! So to sum it up: Akamaru Ramen + Set Hirata Pork Buns Delicious Cocktails and Sapporo Drafts = 5 stars. Youll be in love.

Ippudo is infamous for having long lines going out their door, so we took no chance at arriving early. Our punctual arrival was rewarded with being the first customers seated. The restaurant's design and dcor is visually pleasing both externally and internally. The dining room successfully incorporates traditional patterns with modern flare. I love the ramen bowl-lined wall behind a glass-covered ramen counter bar. Separable tandem seats around the communal table we sat at were also a nice touch. It's also nice to have a lively atmosphere with shouts of Japanese greetings welcoming new patrons every few minutes. On top of that, the service was great; the food came out fast, and they accommodated our big luggage that traveled with us. The ramen here was as good as advertised. I got the Akamaru Modern and I can now say that I have had the best ramen in my life. Compared to the ramen from Santouka, the broth from Ippudo is perfect. Normally, I don't finish the broth, but I found myself slurping down the delicious umami-filled nectar of the Japanese gods. Another must-try item here is the pork buns. While the meat is not as tender as the BBQ pork buns from Momofuku, I found the flavor to be a lot better. The sauce was amazing with a hint of spice, and some type of citrus mayo. For dessert, the Annin Sorbet, a sweet tofu custard with pear sorbet, was a refreshing end to our meal. While it wasn't as visually pleasing as much of our meal and everything else at Ippudo, it tasted satisfying enough. Be sure to check out the tiny noodle-making room downstairs near the bathrooms, before you take off.

I've had to wait 5 minutes when I was the first person in line as the door opened at 5pm. ÊNow that's crowded. I go at off times to avoid the wait. ÊLike the minute before they close or just as they open. ÊBut it's worth it. ÊThe classic and modern ramen is insane. ÊLike liquid pork. But Êdefinitely add the extra pork belly. ÊYummm. ÊAnd do yourself another favor and get the pork buns. Ê This place blows Momofuko out of the water - but I still go there because I don't have to wait so long.

Food: I've tried the Akamaru Modern, Classic, Miso, Spicy Miso Ramen, and stuffed mushrooms (not on menu anymore). The soup base is very flavorful, and I always go for the additional items (pork and eggs). With everything added in, it brings it to ~20 per bowl, but you get complimentary ramen if you have enough soup. It's well worth the splurge (wait time + money). Atmosphere: Very hip and lively. The bar at the front is for people who want to wait while having a few drinks. The wait usually runs from half an hour to two hours depending on the day. The decor is very nice too - no matter where you're seated, there's always something to converse about. Staff: The staff are very into it, everyone speaks some Japanese - whether it's to greet a customer, place an order, or thank a guest. They're always on the move though, so it might be difficult to ask questions or get their attention. Final Thoughts: I haven't found a better ramen shop, and I try to make it my goal to eat here at least once a year (I'm not from New York). It really is a dining experience, and everyone should try it at least once.

I've always liked ramen but I never knew it could be this amazing! The 5 star rating is based solely on my one-time experience with the Akamaru Modern. It was simply delicious. All the flavors came together perfectly and I felt like I could eat 10 more bowls of the thing after finishing. Wait time for the restaurant was not too bad. My boyfriend and I waited about 5-10 minutes at around 5pm on a Friday night.

GREAT rich, flavorful broth, and as expected with NY standards, they were somewhat skimpy on the toppings. I was disappointed because mine came default with thin ramen noodles - no bueno. Make sure when you order you get the thicker ramen noodle, it is not indicated on the menu! Also, the pork buns were good but not up to par compared to the ones from Momofuku. 3.5 stars, but rounding to 4 because our server was super nice!!

Highly recommended. Worth the wait - put your name down when they open and come back later. I almost gave up when they told me it was a 3 hour wait, but my bf didn't give up as easily and told me to put my name down. When we finally got seated at 10pm, I realized what the craze is about this place. So much thought is put into the ramen. Try the one with the dark miso (second to the bottom of the list, I think). WOW! Broth is unlike any I've had before and the noodles paired well with it.

Great bowl of ramen, but not a fan of the wait time (almost 2 hours), price and the serving size. ÊI guess I've been spoiled by Ramenya in West LA/Santa Monica border. ÊIppudo's portion was half the size and you pay twice as much. ÊI'm guess it's because it's a NY price tag.

Happy Happy Joy Joy! After my brother's girlfriend introduced me to Ippudo, I became instantaneously OBSESSED. Êhappiness in a bowl! Wait times during the evening can be harsh (up to 3 hours if you come in around 7pm), but thankfully, I work in hospitality and have an all over the place schedule, so my most recent visit was with an out-of-towner, and we showed up around noon on a Wednesday. ÊWait was only 2, yes TWO minutes!!! Ippudo is the most authentic (or so I think) ramen joints I've been to in NYC. ÊIt's fancier than most other ramen houses, but upon entering the dining room, you're welcomed by all the servers and chefs, by them yelling at you in Japanese. ÊIt's such an amazing experience and I love how their shirts say I heart RAMEN. I need one of those! Do not go without ordering the PORK BUNS. ÊI'm not even a big pork fan, but these are always the highlight of my visits to Ippudo. ÊI always either get the SHIROMARU HAKATA CLASSIC or the AKAMARU MODERN. ÊFor fist-time ramen goers, I'd recommend the Classic as it's a bit more simple and not as overwhelming/complex. ÊIt's the original with pork loin chasu and 1/2 boiled egg like normal ramen. ÊThe Akamaru Modern, however, is much more complex! Instead of the loin, it has the pork belly (much more flavorful IMO) as well as a special sauce that gives it a bit of a kick, some miso paste and garlic oil. Yummy yummy. Be prepared to wait for dinner, but totally worth the wait, especially for those pork buns.

How does Ippudo make me grumpy, oh let me count the ways: 1) I hate waiting 45+ minutes for a bowl of noodles. ÊThis is not the Cheesecake Factory. 2) In Japan you won't find a ramen shop that has 150 seats, 20+ servers, and an eight-page menu. 3) I hate waiting 45+ minutes for a bowl of noodles. ÊThis is not a ride at Six Flags Great Adventure. 4) In all honesty, real ramen shops don't serve pork belly buns. 5) Did I mention that I hate waiting 45+ for a bowl of noodles? ÊPeople in Japan eat their noodles quickly and LEAVE, people!!! In the end, it doesn't matter. ÊI love their food. ÊI will wait in line like a starving lemming. ÊI will shamelessly eat pork belly sandwiches, no matter how unauthentic the experience. ÊI'm such a poseur.

I've been back twice since my last review. The current special ramen they have right now is delicious! and I highly recommend trying it. For my most recent visit (as of today) I brought my friend who hasn't yet been and so we'll just say she was poppin' her Ippudo cherry today! I recommended the special ramen to her, while I went back to my Miso ramen! This time I was smart. I didnt mix the full scoop of fresh ginger into my brother like the server told me to. I took a pinch and removed the rest and I was a happy camper! The broth was so much better with out it. I'm sure if my cousin was with me, she'd gobble it all up. It's just too much for me. I happily enjoyed my ramen and slurped up every ounce of it! Though we visited during the lunch rush, it was a pretty speedy wait (under the quoted 40 minutes), so they are well deserving of their 5 star rating!

We waited for two hours and it was worth it. We ordered chicken and pork steamed bun appetizers which were awesome. Very flavorful and nicely presented. The ramen was delicious. We will definitely return. The service was also just fine. We had seats near the kitchen and noticed most of the cooks were not Japanese, but they were clearly well trained. Recommended... Just, don't arrive at prime dinner time (e.g. 8pm) unless you bring a full case of patience with you.

Hip, trendy, very good food. I little too expensive, I guess. I always get the Akamaru Modern with a poached egg. The ramen is around 14$ or more but I'd rather pay 14$ for good ramen then 8$ for mediocre ramen at St. Marks around the corner. The lunch special is pretty good too. 17$ for the same ramen at dinner, an appetizer, and a salad. Short and sweet review for a place that is so hyped by everyone else.

So here I am in the middle of the night eating my own bowl of makeshift noodles, where I began to reminisce of the multiple times I have ventured through the door of Ippudo in giddy anticipation and groaning hunger, with my latest pork filled journey in particular. And so the meal began with the infamous painful waiting queue (yes, I consider it part of the experience, it's like the suspense in movies!). I arrived at 7PM, and for a party of 2 the wait would be an hour to an hour and a half! Luckily, you're allowed to leave your name and call in to check on the status of your table so +1! All the waiters were extremely accommodating, seating us without rushing despite how busy they were. BTW, I love how the whole staff welcomes each and every party in Japanese during the walk in. itbeawesome. Despite already visiting the place a few times I had never tried the Hirata Buns (2 for $8); pricey but still good. Then... came the ramen, oh the glorious cone shaped bowls of delicious sinful gluttony. She had the Shiromaru Hakata Classic ($14) and I the Akamaru Modern ($14). Of course both of us indulged without hesitation, gulping down spoonfuls of their delicious tonkotsu soup and their pork with near perfect balances of meat and fat. Never have I been disappointed by Ippudo ramen, and I don't expect to anytime soon. So with a shared appetizer and dessert, along with a ramen order each, the bill came out to $50... which is awesome in my book! Lastly for dessert we ordered a green tea flavored creme brulee and it was a perfect finisher, light and sweet! Just everything here was amazing; the engaging yells of welcome from the staff, the amazing bowls of heaven that do not judge you, their bar that may have people judge you, and of course the intimacy of the candle lit decor! Big groups or small dates are the way to go here. Ippudo, please don't ever break my heart! :]

The wait. Oh the wait. It was my first time at Ippudo and we had a party of five (all arriving at different times), but thankfully the host let me put my name down before everyone arrived. We ordered the Hirata Buns w/ pork for apps and they were delicious! I ordered the Akamaru Modern w/ Kakuni and I never though Ramen could possibly taste that good. I'm a huge fan of broth (at least, when it comes to instant ramen noodles) and could pretty much skip the noodles, but it was not the case at Ippudo. I ate till my stomach hurt! The only downside is that you cannot take leftovers home (they said the noodles expand and the broth separates, which is a huge no no for them) - I would have loved to take it home, heat it up and enjoy the experience all over again. Alas, I wish I could have finished it all and I can't wait to eat there again!

Thanks to Ippudo for being able to welcome and accommodate a huge group of 10 during such a busy Friday night! The place was beyond crowded and we were so thankful to have called in a few hours before dining to make reservations. WHEW. The interior was beautiful! Decor was intricate and the lighting was dim enough for a romantic/cool vibe. Music was great. Overall, the food was good. ÊI ordered the Shoyu Ramen (included pork chashu, bamboo shoots, scallions, seaweed, and spinach) with extra bamboo ("menma") for $2. I'm not sure if the freezing cold had anything to do with it but the broth was yummy. It was salty and creamy, and just perfect for any chilly night. The ramen was cooked well and the pork chashu pieces were good but could've been better (more tender). I tried my boyfriend's Shiromaru Hakata Classic ramen bowl and it was good but I think mine tasted better. His was a bit too salty and I didn't like the boiled egg... maybe he left it in there for too long and the yolk made the broth clumpy but it was just okay for me. ÊI also had a taste of my friend's Karaka Kogashi Miso ramen bowl and the broth was something else! It was strong in flavor but really tasty, although a bit spicy so I would not be able to finish a whole bowl of that for sure haha (I'm a pansy when it comes to spicy foods). Appetizers: my boyfriend and I ordered their seared scallop appetizer... yummy, seared goodness. It was a bit spicy but bearable. Also tried their chicken wings -- they were okay, nothing spectacular. My bowl of ramen came out to be ~$18. Granted, it was a huge bowl, but still... for the price, I would expect the ramen to be crazy spectacular if I'm paying almost $20 for a bowl -- it was really good, but not THAT good (I still prefer Santouka and Daikokuya in Los Angeles). **Make reservations -- be sure to call in hours ahead and get it settled. Once it's time to get seated, make sure your whole party is present. **Service was on point, waiters were nice and quick. **It gets CROWDED.

A and I came back here, since we both are obsessed with their Hirata buns. Ummm, this was the first time ever we weren't happy at all. The pork was so dry and tasted gross. First, it was the Ramen and now I guess the Hirata buns aren't good as when they first opened!

I did my research and made sure my boyfriend and I got here at 4:30pm (they open at 5) so we wouldn't be in line for 9 hours and miss Wicked. For the first 5 minutes, there was only a party of 4 in front of us and my boyfriend didn't see why we had to get there so early. Within the next 10 minutes, however, the line increased exponentially and by the time 5pm rolled around and they let us in, there were at least 30 people behind us. Now, I hate when restaurants don't do reservations and will never understand the appeal of making people wait in line like sex-hungry clubbers at a Hollywood dance bar (I'm looking at you Giacomo's!) but I'll make an exception for Ippudo because my experience here was mind-blending. Obligatory decor/service/non-food observations: Sleek yet cute, Japanese writing on walls, other Asian decorations, darkly lit for la romance. The nicest, friendliest, most gracious staff you will ever meet, all of whom (Caucasian, non-Japanese speakers included) shout out random Japanese phrases every few minutes when the restaurant first opens for reasons unbeknownst to my non-Japanese speaking mind. This ends (thankfully) after about 10 min. OK, the food. The pork buns are as delicious, light, fluffy and savory as everyone and their dog raves. The Karaka ramen is spicy, ginger-y deliciousness guaranteed to make your nose run. The Akamaru Modern is proof that we are meant to eat pigs. If I had $1 million, I would build an Olympic-sized swimming pool and fill it with the Akamaru Modern, and swim/feast in it until the salmonella forced me to go to the hospital. Words cannot describe how good this ramen is! Jebus Hong Christ is it good! And dessert! Being HUGE fans of the Ichigo Cream pastry in Boston's Japonaise bakery, we decided we couldn't pass up the opportunity to get our sweet on. One glance at the menu and our choice was set: crepe cake. Oh. My. Mother-loving. God. How do I begin to describe the orgasm that is this cake? Yes, I know they don't actually make it in-house and that it comes from Lady M on the UES but fine then, she/they can get all the praise. Whatever. The point is, this cake is SO INCREDIBLY AMAZING! Layers of crepe sandwiching smooth vanilla cream, served with strawberry and kiwi slices and hard chocolate slivers. How insanely delicious is this cake? It's so delicious we ordered it AGAIN! That's right. We finished the first slice, the nice Japanese lady came with our bill, and we politely refused it because, as we explained, we were about to order another slice. She promptly went into peels of joy and started gushing with us about how good it was, then moved heaven and earth to get our second slice to us ASAP. I am literally cheating on the pasta I am eating right now by fantasizing that it's crepe cake.

Hmm, an hour and 15 minute wait for some ramen. ÊEither people really need ramen all at once, or the food is really good. ÊI can say that it is the latter, with a little bit of the former. The place is a mad house up front, but clears up nicely after you've waited for an hour. ÊGetting past the hostess stand is like a right of passage - the place opens up nicely. ÊBig seating on the left, kitchen seating on the right, hibachi type seating in the middle (no hibachi cooking - just looks like a hibachi table), then some shared tables in the back. Checked 4square, saw that the pork buns were necessary, in addition to the akamaru ramen. ÊPork buns - necessary. ÊIn fact, order enough so you get 2 or 3. ÊSeriously. ÊThe akamaru was quite delish - the noodles were ok, but that soup was laced with cocaine. ÊThrow in the pork belly, and you've just made it into crack - soo good. ÊThe pork belly flavor just seeps into the soup, making it awesome. ÊMy girl got the classic, which she liked more (I did not). ÊThat was more like miso and less punch. ÊAkamaru, punch. ÊIf you come out with black eyes, don't blame me. ÊThe green tea creme brulee was refreshing and light. ÊThe stout beer was quite good - recommended if you like darker beers. Can't say I'll ever come here often (if ever again). ÊIt isn't that I dislike the food (quite the contrary), but an hour plus wait for ramen just doesn't fly.

I wish I could give this place 3.75 stars. Ê It's very good but the wait is 1hr (on a slow day)! ÊNormally, I wouldn't consider wait time in my reviews but it was just too ridiculous, esp for an expensive ramen place. Ê The broth is very complex and flavorful. ÊI ordered the Shiromaru Hakata Classic ramen. ÊI wish I had the slightly thicker noodles my bf had. ÊHe ordered the vegetarian ramen. ÊHowever, sometimes I feel when there's so many flavors in the ramen, it can be distracting. ÊSometimes simplicity is best especially since we're eating ramen. My friend ordered the ramen with the clear chicken broth and I felt that was extremely flavorful. ÊFor a "light" meal, I would definitely recommend that. Next time, I probably would go try a different ramen place. ÊBut, I would recommend the Classic or the one with the chicken broth.

Great ramen! Better than Momofuku noodle bar. Get there soon, 6pm to get a table in 20 minutes, otherwise you'll have to wait 1h at least. The ambiance is cool, with all the staff greeting each costumer when they come in. I order the tripes for appetizer and the traditional ramen and loved it!

I've been to many Japanese ramen noodle places in NY and honestly I'm not sure what's the hype, particularly with this restaurant. So I get the fact that this restaurant Êis one of yelp's hot spots, but what kills me is when you walk through those doors during peak hours the wait will be about 2 1/2 hours long. Example, you come in at 7pm, the host will tell you to either come back at 9:30pm or wait with the rest of the people who is packed in a sardine bar setting. What kinda logic is that??? Really??? Luckily I decided to wait and I must say, the ramen is GOOD! The ramen was fresh and al dente to the bite and the broth was just absolutely amazing, esp since I think most broths today have gone unnoticed by being substituted with MSG or bouillon cubes (yuck) The restaurant, dcor and presentation were very impressive. I like the fact that tt's chic, clean, vibrant and fun. Despite waiting so long, I actually think if it wasn't for all those people, the experience wouldn't have been the same.

one shouldn't go broke eating ramen every night unless you eat at ippudo. it has a nice decor inside. and thats probably what you're paying for. the benches/banquets where a little uncomfortable to sit on. we had a few appetizers that were tasty, but they were $8-$10 per app. there was only one of them that i didn't like. it was the asparagus wrapped in pork belly. but it wasn't like the pork belly that i was used to getting from chinatown. it was more like just the tougher part of the fat from the pork belly, wrapped around the asparagus, breaded and deep fried...was very rubbery and not so good. i figured if fat was deep fried it should at least be good & crispy like the skin when you're eating fried chicken. also, the miso ramen was ok. the noodles weren't like ramen noodles. they were more like shanghai dan dan noodles. not what i was expecting. the slices of pork were very good, but you were only given 2 slices of pork. the miso broth was sort of mild which is what i prefer as a lot of ramen i have is too salty. i like a little spice with my hot broth. i asked the server for hot sauce and he brought out a teaspoon of chili paste out to the table. i added it and it wasnt enough to even change the taste of the broth. after we saw the bill, i was charged $3 for that hot sauce. WTF? you're charging $16 for ramen noodles, and then you're going to nickel and dime me for a teaspoon of chili paste? is it right to charge customers for condiments? at least let them know ahead of time. it would be like McDonalds charging for ketchup. don't know if i would try this place again. bill for 4 people was over $100 and no alcohol.

GF took me about a year ago on my visit before I moved here. I still remember their steaming pork bun, each made to order and very tasty. I believe I got the Shiromaru ramen with pork belly and GF got the chicken one. ÊTheir broth is not only good, but very complex. Ê When you stir it, you see layers of different texture and colors. ÊThey take their ramen seriously for sure. I'm a fan of real japanese ramen, but personally they're always overshadowed by vietnamese pho which comes with heaps of meat, vegetables and always gets you satisfied. They're great at what they do. ÊI'm very happy to have tried them. ÊBut at $15-18 a pop, I just feel something is amiss... for a bowl a ramen, no matter how upscale. ÊAnd your stomach isnnnn'tttt quite full. 3.5 stars, but deserves the 4 star show.

This is the only ramen shop that has rivaled LA's Hakata Ramen Shinsengumi IMO. I tried a few ramen shops in NY over the years, and none of them came close to Hakata in LA. When I finally found Ippudo, it was a sigh of relief. Now I could have stellar ramen on both coasts. Ippudo is much hipper and louder than any other ramen shop I have been to. The wait is inSAAAANNE so don't go here hungry. During busy times, you'll hear the hostess quote 2-3 hours for a wait. Even when they tell you 30m, it usually winds up being 1-2 hours in reality. That part, I hate. I've endured it a few times though since on a cold night in NY, nothing hits the spot better. Their ramens are hearty and salty bowls of soul-satisfying slurpiness. I always start with an order of steamed buns stuffed with sweet pork belly or chicken and sometimes an order of fried chicken. Love watching the open kitchen activities when I sit at the bar. The wait (well, anything under 1.5 hours) is worth it for the best ramen in NY.

I have only ever ordered the Akamura Modern ramen, no I lie, sometimes I get the Akamura Chashu if I'm feeling particularly piggy for pork belly. I do not know what they put in the broth other than straight heroin, it is that good. one may almost be tempted to say it is merely a vehicle for the noodles, except that those are quite perfect as well. with fried shishito peppers and those fab pork buns to start, it makes for a very satisfying meal. if still hungry after your gargantuan bowl of noodles, you may order additional perfectly-cooked noodles to sop up the rest of the broth you haven't poured directly down your gullet. yes, there's a wait. yes, you share a table. but they care -- true story: my sister once disappeared to the bathroom right before our bowls arrived. our server, extremely concerned that the noodles would not be of Perfect Tooth when she returned, offered to bring back fresh noodles upon her return.

When I went to visit NYC in 2009, this was one of the places that everybody recommend I check out. Now before this, I had never eaten real ramen in my life. It's always been Maruchan and Cup Noodles haha. So on one of our last days, my friend and I decided to check out Ippudo. It was daunting when they gave me the menu because I didn't know what any of the soups were. I settled on the Akamaru Modern Ramen. The soup came out in a ridiculously large bowl with an equally as ridiculous large spoon. I felt like a tiny person eating a giant's meal. It was awesome. The broth had a milky look with a smooth and full flavor. The egg was cooked about 3/4 way, which IMO is perfect. The pork was tender (not as tender as Monta's Noodle House in LV tho). This was definitely one of the highlights of the trip.

Incredibly popular for a reason - this place is great. You won't to miss the pork buns. As for the ramen - the noodles are thin, and the broth is excellent. Rich, salty deliciousness. Have I had better? In Japan. So what's the downside? It's always crowded. You will wait for a table even at 2:30PM on a weekday. It's a little upscale for a ramen joint, which may or may not be a downside, depending on your perspective. Doesn't matter - the ramen is great here.

The akusama ramen has a rich, deep, complex tonkatsu broth with perfectly cooked al dente ramen and chasu pork. I recommend adding the soft boiled egg and roasted pork belly topping for a greater depth of flavor and variety. For appetizers, get the Japanese peppers and the pork buns. The peppers are slightly spicy, but the seasoning salt and the lemon that come with it both help to cut the heat. The pork buns are roasted pork wrapped in Chinese style bread with a bit of lettuce and wasabi dressing. Don't tell my grandmother, but Ippudo's are better than hers. Ssshh. Everything is delicious here and the 2.5 hour wait may just be worth it. No reservations, but as they say, "Good things comes to those who wait."

What can I say other than WOW, This is by far the best restaurant I have ever eaten at in my lifetime! I am sad that I've only eaten here once ever because it is just so delicious. It was quite a while to wait but it is the BEST ramen you will ever eat in your life. The ambience of the place is very trendy, hip and young. It's very intimate and probably a good place to take a date. Everything that was made was made in house. From the pork buns to the ramen noodles. Everything was a sensory experience. The pork buns that we ordered were amazing! The way it was prepared was very innovated. But the star of the meal was of course the ramen. I cannot gush enough about how much I loved the ramen. The broth had so much flavor, the pork was just tender enough to not be chewy, the noodles tasted freshly made. I have never had ramen that tasty before and whenever I visit NYC I will ALWAYS be making a stop there every time!

Holy Mother of Fatty Pork Belly and Charred Freaking Miso, Batman!!! Ippudo's Ramen rocks my socks off like I was facing away from one of those big blasting 90's speakers. And I've been around. I've had Totto, Sapporo....Okay, that's pretty much all I've had but none have compared to Ippudo's CHARRED MISO RAMEN. Most people get the Akamaru Modern, but YOU WILL BE MISSING OUT if you don't try their charred miso. (I just forget the name...It's like the last item on the menu.) SO TRY IT. And tell them Jennifer sent you. Their WTF look is priceless. Atmosphere-wise: Love the decor; all the servers shouting at new incoming customers, kinda gimicky but cute.

Omg!! This is a must try when in NYC!!! Ippudo does have a long wait but it's good to come in a small group! I had the spicy miso ramen with ginger and chasu! It was so good!!! Loved the broth it was spicy and flavorful. At first you don't taste the spiciness but as you keep sipping the broth it hits you and it gets progressively hotter! The chasu is very tender and melts in your mouth. Though they do skimp on the size and amount of the chasu, it still taste good. The ginger puts in a kick into the ramen broth. ÊOverall it's a close 2nd to what I had in Japan but still can't beat it.

Ippudo is a very established institution by this point, and I've eaten here 102983109 times because I always take out-of-towners here. The wait has gotten a bit better at 45 min-1 hr. Your best bet is to get there right when it opens for minimal waiting. Definitely get the pork buns, and then knock yourself out with whatever ramen you want. Ippudo is slightly on the richer side for me, but I have no complaints as I've never eaten ramen with quite the same flavoring. I LOVED the wasabi akamaru special they had (not sure if they're still serving it), and it was my go-to bowl every time. Workers are EXTREMELY friendly and chill. Spacious seating and delicious asian pear sorbet are all pluses in my book.

Ippudo, I heart you!!! ÊI will rarely ever admit this, but the 2 hour wait was definitely worth all the hype I've heard over and over again. ÊI'd do it again in a heartbeat! I went with a party of 4 and we ordered the following: 2 versions of ramen: Shiromaru Hakata Classic Akamaru Modern +extra orders of pork belly for all (ohmyfreakingoodnessssss yummm) Maguro tataki (seared tuna with special Ippudo sauce) Tako wasabi (raw baby octopus......sooooo delish!) 4 large sapporos Oh and for just an additional $2, you get an extra order of noodles. ÊIt was so worth it, especially for the boys! One of my friends even picked up an I love Ramen tshirt for $25 (cash only), and I would've totally picked one up too but they didn't have any female sizes, so boooooo. Ê And of course, the ambience was amazing, chic and earthy decor, and the customer service (our waiter was exceptional) was top notch! Fabulous company, amazing meal (we all agreed it was the best ramen we've ever had), and with a $130 something bill, it was all worth the wait and the magnificent hype. I can't wait to come back again and get my Ippudo fix!

I'm a bit torn, the food itself was good enough to be a four. And yet, because it is so over hyped I find myself wanting to give it a three just to not follow the crowd (and it's wait time). In the end, I let the food speak for itself. The ramen was good, I had the Shio and friend had the Akamaru. Also had the pork buns which were also very good. Most of the other reviewers have mentioned the same thing, the wait time is ridonkulous. The food is pretty good, service is lively and bustling. In the end, would I really wait an hour and a half again for ramen again? Hell no. Is it worth going there at least once? Probably.

Used to be great, and the food's still delicious, but I feel like you have to consider the whole experience, including the wait. I've been there countless times and had pretty much everything on the menu. Used to be able to go at peak times and just wait at the bar for a bit, then the regular NYC cycle hit and now you can go there at 5 pm and they'll have a three hour wait. Better to go to rai rai Ken. The pretention and peccadillos used to be charming, but when you combine it with having to wait so long, your low blood sugar just makes all the shouting annoying. Ippudo has fallen victim to its own success.

I decided to hit up Ippudo since I haven't been there in a while.. I wasn't surprised how packed it was but surprised how packed it was for an early weekday afternoon. Ippudo definitely has gotten too trendy for its own good. As I walked in I wasn't surprised to hear people waiting up to an hour or more for a table. Since I was by myself I got seated right away. I really didn't feel bad for people who have been waiting there all day. I ordered my favorite Akamaru ramen but decided to get the charasu. It was a total rip-off in terms of price. They seem to have shrunk all their pork slices. I received 6 tiny morsels of pork. In reality it was like eating 1.5 full size pork slices. The noodles and broth was good as always (although their broth seems to have gotten even saltier). I wish they gave you more noodles for what you're paying for. Looks like I won't back for a while unless I'm really craving their ramen. Maybe some day their pork slice will get bigger but I'm not holding my breath.

I guess its time for me to finally finish my NYC reviews, here goes: Ippudo is very inviting, it has the smaller feel of a Japanese restraunt, but its actually pretty decent in size. Everything has an ultra modern japanese feel. Something about the L shaped chairs left me puzzled but happy. Also, everytime someone comes in they should something I can't repeat in Japanese (hello how are you perhaps?Welcome?). Foodwise, the Ramen is pretty good, I had the special which happened to be a spicy mix of pork and beef. The Pork belly was delicious, perfectly braised so it melts in your mouth, without too much of the hard fatty texture(don't get me wrong its fatty). Pork buns, on point, never thought I'd get anything better than my Cha-Sew baked bun in Chinatown, I was wrong. Anyhow, highly recommended.

As a huge ramen fan, I've been wanting to try Ippudo for years now but haven't had the time or patience to put up with the hour-long waits. I finally gave in last week and now I have absolutely no problems with the waits. I would wait days if I must just to get back in for another bowl of ramen or plate of hirata buns. From just my first visit, I fell head over heels with the hirata buns with pork, Shiromaru Hakata Classic, and Karaka Kogashi Miso Ramen. The servers are great, and I do not have the words to describe the awesome attitudes of the girls working the front, especially given the high volume and long wait lists.

Woke up early to take the subway across town to get in line for some ramen. Got there around 1130 and it was already packed, waited 15 minutes for seats at the bar. My brother pointed out to me there is a guy that only makes these pork buns. of course we ordered it. Also ordered a nice hot bowl of ramen, btw, nothing beats a late night of drinking and a headache than ramen. the pork buns came first, and they were very good. tender, and they come in the buns that you eat at chinese restaurants that pair with crispy duck skin and hoy sing sauce, yeah, sooo money. The ramen came next and it was awesome. The broth wasn't too light or heavy and you know if you let it sit the broth wouldn't coagulate like a lot of places here in the SF Bay Area. They also offer thinner noodles, not vermicelli thin, but still noticable. I liked it. After face slamming into my bowl I finished and we called for the bill, but not before they delivered after meal tea... very nice touch. I also have to say this... Someone needs to confirm for me but does everyone speak Japanese.. The caucasian host spoke japanese, the hispanic prep cooks were speaking it too.. and i d ont mean like 'domo oregato mr. roboto', I mean they are having actual conversations in Japanese. Either way I can see why this place is so popular, better than all the ramen places i frequent at home, sigh.

I've had better ramen. Their specialty tonkotsu ramen was okay. Their spicy karaka ramen was too salty and too over seasoned - it was barely touched. A friend mentioned that the spicy ramen tasted more like bun rieu, a Vietnamese noodle dish that consists of tomatoes and crab, and she was right. I wont go back for their ramen. It's not very good and it's over priced ($13). Not worth the wait. However, their pork buns are pretty delicious.

Went here while visiting new York, and let me tell you, I was absolutely blown away by their ramen. I ordered their spicy ramen with pork shoulder. It came very quickly (around only 5 minutes). The broth was a bright and fiery red, very creamy and delicious! The noodles, which are hand-cut, were very tasty. Actually, the noodles in my spicy ramen were cut thicker than the ones in my cousin's plain miso based ramen, so that means that each Dish has a unique type of noodle! The pork shoulder (which you actually have to pay extra to be included in your dish) was absolutely huge! Veery tender and delicious! The best thing about the dish though, is that for only two dollars (and as long as you still have enough broth), you can get a refill of noodles! Overall, this was some of the most tasty ramen I have ever had! Was definitely worth the almost two hour wait. Next time I visit New York, I'm definitely going to visit this place again!

ÊI've been searching around the Northwest for a place that has anything close to the same flavor, but I'm slowly coming to the realization that I'm just going to have to return to NYC or plan a trip to Japan.

There are really only 3 vegetarian options on the menu, only one is ramen (the others are ok cucumbers and so-so tofu salad).

Lets just say thank god I eat pork now or I would have never been able to try this orgasmic noodle creation. The noodle soup is amazing, the noodles have a creamy yet firm texture that is to die for. ÊThe broth was perfected when I mixed their spicy sauce (+$2) inside. Ê I was not crazy about their pork buts the texture of the bun was a tad funny for me plus the pork had to much of a mayo sauce on top.

The ramen is classic here and brought over from a legit and equally famous Japanese chain. This place is definitely pricey for a bowl of ramen ($16 odd) but definitely worth seeing what the fuss is about for fresh noodles and broth. For proof, see the 2 hour long lines every evening and the guy cutting fresh noodles out of dough downstairs. If you are hungry, save some soup and ask for seconds of noodles, which for a few bucks a waiter will happily bring around a ball of noodles to sop up the rest of your broth. Ippudo doesn't take reservations, so for a tip, stop by in the afternoon and put your name down on the list, then come back later for your table.

I don't know what Ippudo stands for, but I think it should translate to "Heaven in a Bowl". Ê I've been to a lot of ramen places, it's one of the few things I always need to try out whenever I go on vacation. ÊI usually find at least one issue with the ramen place. ÊThe soup was too bland, the noodles were too hard, if this restaurant mixed their noodles with this other restaurants broth, that'd be the perfect ramen bowl, etc. ÊBut with Ippudo, I don't have any issues with it. The broth and noodles are perfect and if you eat your noodles too quickly and have a lot of leftover broth, you can order more noodles! ÊSo no more leftover bowls full of broth, as long as you can finish an extra bowl of noodles. ÊThe pork buns are also some of the best pork buns I've ever had. ÊYou can seriously just order a bunch of the pork buns and make a meal out of them if you're not in the mood for ramen. Ê Lastly, the coolest thing about this place is that they separate the kitchen from the eating area with a bunch of windows. ÊSo you can see them making the noodles and all of the other stuff right in front of you. ÊIt's not Benihana's, but watching them cook kills some time before you get your food.

ÊBecause we've been diners here for so long, we became friendly with some of the staff who are all super awesome. - The ENTIRE menu is worth a try but if we must must must choose favorites, they will be the shisito peppers and any of the buns to start. ÊThe Akamaru Ramen is just plain stupid crazy delicious. ÊIt is so rich in flavor and the veggies and pork toppings complement the noodles perfectly. ÊMake sure to stir in the paste placed so neatly on top of the entire kit and kaboodle bowl of magic. ÊI usually order the special chili paste to add in because I love spicy (I practically drink sriracha) and the hubs would get the pork belly and extra noodle toppings. ÊTheir special ramen now rotate every 2-3 months which I highly recommend to order because they are always so different in taste and flavor from each other and a must-try. - I've come here on date night with my babes and as part of parties of 15. ÊService never falls below spot-on and it's always fun. Ê - Come to Ippudo if you don't understand how noodles which used to be just $.25 in a package at the grocery can be this life-changing to seemingly crazy fans like me. ÊTrust me, you will get it then.

Hands down the best ramen place in NYC. I've had most of the ramen on their menu and every single bowl has been great. The broth is flavorful, the noodles are the perfect texture and if you get one w/the pork belly.. it's to die for. No joke! The pork belly is like butter, it just oozes w/flavor and melts in your mouth. You wont stop thinking about the pork belly once you've had it. Other great dishes at Ippudo that also needs to be noted is for the Shisito Peppers, roasted and comes w/a powder dipping sauce, it's like garlic or something, it's really good. I love it when the peppers are spicy! The pork buns here are the best! Again their pork belly is just amazing and that makes their pork buns THE BEST! Waaaaaay better than the ones from Momofuku (although those are good too but these are the BEST). I love the pork buns w/a dab of sriracha on them. Prices are not cheap, at $13-16 for a bowl of ramen, it's kinda steep. Appetizers are priced pretty normal. The wait is ALWAYS long, I've tried coming in all sorts of times during the day, and there is ALWAYS a wait regardless of the time. The wait time is around 1hour+.

After reading a fraction of the reviews, albeit a small, small fraction, I planned my attack on Ippudo carefully... leave hotel on upper west side by 10:10, arrive via subway by 10:55, and straight into a bowl of ramen. ÊUnfortunately, a small kink in the plans (i.e., slow walking) caused us to arrive ten minutes after opening, and into a 10 minute line. ÊNo problem, we just amused ourselves with looking at the ramen and ramen bowls. I have to admit being a little bit embarrassed at the group greeting... but the bf loved that added touch. ÊMeh. The bf got a classic set with eel, which seems to be tonkatsu with a little bit of everything and fried eel atop rice, and I the karaka-men set with spicy chicken, a spicy tonkatsu with slices of pork belly. Ê The small salad and our rice sets arrived first, his with eel and mine with chicken. ÊI can't attest to the eel (I hate the eel texture and flavour) but the breaded fried chicken atop light mayo and rice was amazing. ÊThe flavours were this amazing blend of spicy and sweet and everything made my tongue happy. ÊThe salad was a salad, enough said (I'm not a salad person either). Ê Then, the bowls of ramen arrived. ÊWhile not a ramen connoisseur, I'm aiming to be one day. ÊThe ramen noodles were satisfactory, perhaps a tiny tiny bit overcooked (sitting in soup too long?). ÊAnd the soups were fairly delicious, albeit not as thick as I like for tonkatsu soup. ÊIppudo's spicy soup, the karaka-men, was disappointedly not spicy, even after adding the entire dish of spicy sauce they brought me (for a surcharge). ÊHowever, two or three ramen noodles, once gingerly placed inside the gigantic spoonful of soup and slurped down... was quite delicious and satisfying. Overall, the food was quite delicious, and I'd go back in a heartbeat. ÊBut I've been spoiled by Daikokuya in LA.... sigh.

After going there a second time this past weekend, I think I've decided this place is officially my favorite ramen joint in Manhattan. It beats Momofuku Noodle Bar by a mile! The wait may seem daunting, but its always been worth it in my mind. I don't mind drinking a few Sapporos at the bar with the attentive bartenders, while awaiting the delicious awesomeness that is Ippudo. I still haven't ventured far from ordering the same 3 items every time, but I figure, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. I usually start with the Shishito fried peppers, followed by the pork buns, and then the Classic Ramen. All 3 area always satisfying and I want to keep going back for more! I'd be interested to see what the wait is like on a week night, I've only been on Friday and Saturday nights...until next time!

My brother and five of our friends went here and had to wait two hours to get a seat. However, let me say that it's worth it. The ramen here is incredible. I had the Akamaru Modern and it was delicious, especially with the pork belly. The fact that they allowed a refill on ramen was even better. I definitely was full by the end of the night. The wait was worth it. The environment here is very cozy and warm especially after the cold winter that we waited outside in. The dark ambiance was very attractive and the fact that we got to see the cooks do their thing, it was nice. I liked the walls that had the hiragana. It was a nice touch and it's made of foam. They're actually the names of the people who had a hand in either making Ippudo a reality or their financiers. I don't remember, but it was a very nice touch. I also liked the paper paintings located between the tables in the back and the bar. I recommend coming here at least one time. This is the best ramen I have ever tasted so far even if the wait time is long. Trust me when I say that it is worth it.

With over 2300 reviews, there really isn't much more to be said about Ippudo...however, imma yelp it anyway! ÊOn a Tuesday night, arrived at this dimly lit location around 6:30pm, hoping to beat the crowds. ÊA 45-minute wait for a table for 2, the hostess informs us. ÊAfter a nice walk around the city, we arrive back and are promptly seated around 7:15pm. ÊAt that time, the wait time increased to an hour-30min. Ê As we are walked to our seats, the traditional "irashaimase" is yelled by the staff to welcome us to the restaurant. ÊBeing the polite Japanese kid I am, I thank them kindly (my mother raised me well). ÊFirst thing I notice is the black and red decor...I've decided my next home will mimic their ambiance, as it makes for the ultimate bachelor pad...sleek, sexy, and professional at the same time. Ê Start off with the hirata pork buns ($8 for 2 buns); was not a fan of the mayo, but the pork slices were fatty and melted in my mouth, as did the fresh steamed bun. Followed this with the Akamaru Modern ramen ($14) plus the nitamago ($2), or delicious egg that soaks up the salty and creamy soup base. ÊWhile I could easily get a dozen eggs for the same price, just order it...you'll thank me later. ÊThe menu describes the ramen better than I can: "'The original tonkotsu' soup noodle with Ippudo's special sauce, pork belly chashu, cabbage, kikurage, scallions, miso paste & fragrant garlic oil." While awaiting my friend to complete her meal, I decided my hunger was not abated by just one set of noodles, so I yelled "kaedama" to demand my 2nd portion of noodles (equally sized to the first) for an additional $2. ÊThankfully, I left enough broth in my bowl to coat and flavor the thin, but robust noodles...too bad I had finished off all of the other goodies in the bowl. Overall, a wonderful experience...quick and attentive service, delicious broth/food, and attractive decor. ÊI now understand why people wait the length of time they do for such a simple dish, and I would wait again to enjoy it.

Ive never been a big fan of soups, but seeing the reviews on this place we felt we had to try the Ramen. ÊWe put our name on the list and they called our cell when the table was ready so it was nice we didn't have to sit and wait. ÊThe reviews were correct, it has to be the best Ramen around.

Probably the best ramen I've had in US... I so want to go back there and eat it again just to make sure it was as good as I remember. I had the Akamaru Modern which was just the most perfect bowl of ramen. ÊThe pork slices literally melted in my mouth, and the broth had just the right amount of flavor without being too salty or greasy. Noodles were cooked just the way I like them. ÊI really felt like "wow, this is why some people become ramen addicts, ÊI get why people foam at the mouth discussing different ramen places" lol. I tried different ramens that my friends got, but it wasn't as good as mine. ÊSpicy miso was really good the first few bites, but the flavor was too overwhelming after that. ÊSo I was very happy with my choice. :) Also the pork buns were scrumptious... probably the same pork belly that goes in the ramen, so tender and yummy. ÊJust as good as Momofuku, if not better. Ê If you're a ramen-holic like some people I know, definitely give this place a try next time you're in NY! ÊAnd order the Akamaru Modern. ÊWish I could eat some now... yum.

I came here at the recommendation of a friend. I heard they had good ramen. I was not able to try the ramen because: * I will not wait two and a half hours for ramen. * I will not wait two and a half hours for a meal in a restaurant with a 'B' health score. I find the concept to be offensively anti-ramen. Ramen is 8 stools and a ticket vending machine. Ramen is populist. There are no rules, and I suppose that applies to gourmet ramen as well. Twenty minutes? Sure, I can wait. Forty-five? Well, maybe I'll get a drink at a bar nearby. I'm sure the ramen is very good. Amazing, even. But they ought to expand or open a new location--if the ramen really is that good, it will stand on its own.

Ippudo is, to the east coast what Snoop is to the west coast what 'face is to Houston. Nitamago in the house is so necessary, no bra with that blouse is so necessary, no panties and jeans is so necessary, Why eat anywhere else, is that necessary? this place is the stickiest of the ickies, the creamest of the crop, for the pickiest of the picky, from the C-list to the top prepare for long lines 'cause the wait is insane it won't be a long time until you need it in your veins. in all seriousness, the akamaru modern with the poached egg and the extra hard noodles and the hot sauce will take your tastebuds to a place much warmer and friendlier than New York City. make no mistake about it, monosodium glutamate is a drug, but unlike most drugs, you don't OD from this one.

PROS: - AKAMARU RAMEN: delicious broth and ramen. The ramen tastes totally different from the instant ramen you usually get. (get this with nitamago - boiled egg topping - really good) - HIRATA PORK BUNS: Delish! It was so juicy!! - GYOZA: very unique - it's a fried chicken wing that is stuffed with meat and vegetables. - LADY M MILLE CREPE CAKE - tasted sort of like Napoleon cake with it's crunchy layering. Comes with small pieces of strawberry and kiwi. In the picture of the dessert menu the strawberries looked bigger. I was expecting a whole strawberry not small tiny pieces. Overall this dessert is good. - Nice presentation of food - can order Kaedama (more noodles for just $2) - quick service and fast clean up - Nice Decor - Very Modern. Cool chairs that open on the side. (its sorta of like missing an left arm rest. CONS: - A little pricey. - the wait. (My friend made a reservation for 7:00pm but we still had to wait like 15 minutes.) - to reserve you have to go in person on the day of

Best [Japanese style] ramen I've had so far. I went with the classic and added a poached egg. My husband ordered the same thing but instead of the poached egg he added pork belly. We also ordered the pork buns which was heaven. Service was EXCELLENT. We got there 10 minutes prior to opening and waited in line for a good 15 minutes before we finally got seated. The staff was welcoming and friendly and we weren't rushed at all. They knew everything on the menu and gave recommendations.

I don't know what the fuss is all about. I've tried to go twice, and the wait was over 1.5 hours long so I went elsewhere. I guess third time's the charm, since my friend and I only waited for 10-15 min. I'm so glad our wait was short because the food is not worth any sort of wait time. I'd much rather go to Saint's Alp for some noodles at a reasonable price. The drinks weren't bad, and were the average price for NY cocktails (around $12). I don't eat meat, so maybe the veggie option wasn't the best, but my friend got the pork and wasn't very impressed either. For $3, I can make ramen at home that tastes much better, so why bother?

Been here a few times, and I absolutely love Ippudo!! ÊIt's my fave ramen restaurant in NYC. Once, I waited 2 hours to get in here because it was really packed on a Saturday night. ÊI love the neighborhood, so there was plenty of stuff to see and do to kill some time, esp over on St. Mark's. ÊNormally I would never wait that long for any restaurant. ÊOnly that once though b/c I wanted Ippudo so badly that night. ÊHowever, the other times, I went during the off-peak hours, which is usually for right when it opens for lunch, late lunch or early dinner. The hosts/servers are all REALLY nice. ÊIt's cool how when you walk in, the host would say something in Japanese and the people that are cooking yell out something back. ÊStill no idea what they're saying, but it's fun. ÊThe place is really nice, very clean. ÊI love the decor - trendy/modern. ÊThe servers are always very attentive, and they've always been patient to answer any questions I had. ÊThey'll even give you suggestions if you're undecided. As for the food, I've had the following: hirata buns (chicken & pork), hirata chicken wings, shiromaru hakata classic ramen, and akamaru modern ramen. ÊMy fave is the hakata classic ramen. [I always put an extra Nitamago - boiled egg - in my ramen. Oh yeah!] ÊThe food is absolutely amazing!! ÊI keep ordering these same items, and I absolutely love it. ÊMaybe it's time to try other items on the menu. ÊPlus, the food is very reasonably priced. I love it here, but try to come during the off peak hours. ÊIt's totally worth it!! :-)

I came with my boyfriend on a random night and we waited about an hour for a table. He ordered the spicy ramen and I had the vegetarian wasabi ramen. Mine was delicious! The noodles were a little bit hard and chewy which is how ramen should be - not soggy. I normally hate wasabi so I was hesitant, but this was the only vegetarian option. Not to worry fellow wasabi haters! The soup had only a hint of wasabi which was actually pretty nice and the entire dish wasn't spicy at all. The veggies in the ramen were tasty too. My boyfriend told me something funny about the restaurant. He's Japanese and his brother recently told him that the Ippudos in Japan are actually really casual, cheap, quick-meal restaurants.

Not sure why a rational person would wait over 90 minutes for a table... then again, unclear whether New Yorkers are really rational, myself included. ÊLuckily, the bar is smack dab in the middle of the waiting area so you can beat the snarling hunger pangs down with appetizers and drinks. The bar was actually pretty amazing given what it was and where it was. ÊThe bar food (some of which is on the regular menu) is good as well. ÊWish there were more chairs/seating area but real estate space is precious and only crowded standing with highly recycled air for those that wait. The ramen lives up to everything I've heard. ÊI mean, yum! ÊThe broth is what you come here for and it was good. Ê(Akamaru modern.) ÊThe special is good as well, but the Akamaru modern has a special place on my tongue. ÊThe egg is a must-add. ÊYes, it is $2.5 for an egg. ÊBut yes, definitely worth having. ÊThe wings are good as well, but I wouldn't recommend having more than 1 or 2 since it has a strong taste and makes everything else you eat seem paler in comparison. Service was fine, ambiance was fine. ÊTons of NYU'ers so depends on how you feel about the young'uns.

Ippudo sounded like a good idea, until I heard that the wait can be up to two hours!! What is it with New York and these excessive wait times?! That is definitely something I will not miss when back in LA. But I did want to try it, especially since there are 43 Ippudo's in Japan and Ippudo NYC is first location outside of Japan. I did however manage to make the 2 hour wait work in my favor. ÊOn my way home I stopped by and put my name down and came back an hour and 45 minutes later for dinner. Upon arrival I was seated immediately. ÊPerfect! Obviously if you can't get there 2 hours before you actually want to dine, you should either A) pay someone else to go put your name down or B) go elsewhere... Walking into the dining room, you are greeted with the the familiar shouts heard when entering a sushi restaurant, although they are even louder, longer and more enthused at Ippudo. You will be seated either at the counter or one of several communal tables. I heard that their hirata buns were great - filled with pork or chicken and filled with lettuce and Êa spicy bun sauce. ÊThese may have been the best buns I've ever had - yes better than Momofuku. We also tried the bakerutsu tofu- spicy tofu casserole served with minced pork, crunchy noodles in a spicy broth in a stone pot. ÊThis arrived to us boiling hot. ÊIt's a great appetizers for those who aren't averse to hot things - both temperature and spice. I had to have the famous ramen...I choose the akamaru ramen, the original tonkotsu soup topped with Ippduo's special sauce, pork belly, cabbage, scallions, miso paste, kikurage (a Japanese mushroom) and garlic oil. This is definitely a great ramen, and at $14 it's incredibly filling and enough for two people...I recommend sharing. I would love for them to open an Ippudo in LA. ÊIt's a fun, ethnic experience in a modern atmosphere at a great price.

2859 reviews on Yelp. That's the most I've ever seen. And I couldn't be happier to round out the number to 2860! I FINALLY braved the line and awaited glory at Ippudo last night - and let me tell you - it was absolutely worth it! Some of the most delicious food I've had! I tried the shrimp buns, miso cod and wagyu beef - all amazing. Tried the Akamaru Modern ramen dish and it was the most flavorful broth and bowl of noodles I have ever had. I did not have desert here - but I love Lady M cakes (thin layers of crepe with creme between them) and the fact they serve it makes me love the restaurant even more.

I'm obsessed with Ippudo. ÊThis place has the most delicious, authentic tasting ramen I've ever had outside of Japan (and frankly is better than a lot of places I've tried in Tokyo). ÊIf you're looking for delicious tonkotsu ramen, this is definitely your place. ÊMy favorite is the Shiromaru classic. ÊThe pork belly (kakuni) is to DIE for --- amazing flavors and cooked to perfection. ÊIt's excellent in the pork buns, but also amazing added to the ramen. ÊIf you go on weekday afternoons, they also have ramen lunch set, served with a simple salad (with a yummy ginger soy dressing) and a small bowl of pork belly over rice that is surprisingly mouth-watering. Ê The biggest downside is, of course, the wait. ÊI have tried to go to Ippudo at all hours of the day to avoid the 2 hour line --- weekday, weekend, 11am, 3pm, 6pm, 11pm --- you name it, I've tried it. ÊThe best I've ever been able to manage is a 1 hour wait on a weekday afternoon (although one time I was told the wait would be 2 hours and ended up waiting only 45 minutes. ÊTHERE IS A GOD). ÊBut if you have the time to put your name down and shop around at the stores nearby (or go to Saint's Alp for bubble tea!) it is definitely worth the wait.

3.5 stars really. I have never missed going Ippudo every time I'm in New York but it's really not for the ramen. There are many great ramen places in California and Ippudo falls far behind them. What stands out in Ippudo are really the appetizers. Some favorites are the pork bun, chicken wings and the pork ribs. The raw octopus which looks really weird was also surprisingly excellent. The Akamaru Modern ramen, on the other hand, left much to be desired. Though the broth was tasty, the soft boiled egg was more hard than soft and the noodles they used was thin and not chewy enough. Another pet peeve is the wait time. If we had to wait 1.5hours for just two people, I would have expected the food to be amazing but it was just alright. I'd probably not come here often if I live in the city but it's still a must-go for the occasional NY trips for their tasty appetizers.

Watch out! ÊNoodle whore coming through!! Ê3.5 stars rounded up! We came here on a Friday afternoon because Momofuku was unexpectedly closed. ÊBoooo!

ÊWe also got the Hirata Buns after seeing our neighbors' plate and they looked amazingly appetizing! They offer this cute little brochure on how to eat and enjoy your ramen. ÊFirst, sip the broth to savor the culmination of many ingredients and long hours of preparation. ÊNext, slurp the noodles and indulge in the flavors. ÊLastly, feast your eyes and go apeshit with the toppings! ÊHaha I did exactly that and was delighted with the very bold, flavorful broth. ÊI almost thought it was a bit too salty, but not overwhelming. ÊIt was still enjoyable, and the pieces of chashu were super fatty and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. ÊI think if I came back, I would try the Shiromaru Hakata Classic or Miso Ramen for a less sodium overload! The Hirata Buns (2 pieces for $8) came out and they looked absolutely delectable! ÊPieces of savory, fatty pork belly enveloped in a nicely, fluffed steamed bun. ÊThe crunch of lettuce leaves gave it some texture and the original Ippudo spicy sauce gave it a mild kick! Overall, I enjoyed the ambiance and decor of ramen bowls hanging on the walls and uncooked ramen displayed underneath the glass tabletops. ÊThey make their ramen fresh daily and you can definitely taste the long hours and love they put into their broth. ÊHowever, I felt prices were kind of steep, even for NY standards, but it's a good ramen place to try! ÊTotal with tax and tip ~$50 for party of 2.

I'll echo everyone's sentiments here that the ramen is excellent. I ordered the Akamaru Modern with the egg and pork. Who knew that pork goes well with ramen? Well I just found out it's a great combination today for lunch. I was more impressed with the music they had playing here though. The speaker in the bathroom was loud enough for me to Shazam one of the songs. Whoever comes up with the playlist for the day has excellent taste in music.

Best ramen ever! ÊMy fiance and I call it 'crack ramen' because once you try it, you just can't get enough and your body craves. My personal favorite is the Modern with a side of Kakuni Ê(braised pork belly). ÊThe pork is braised in soy sauce so it's salty, fatty, and oh-so-good. ÊThe two tiny, thin slices of pork that comes with the ramen isn't enough so a side order of some sort of protein is a must. ÊAlthough, for $15 a bowl, they could afford to put in a few more pieces of pork. This place isn't cheap. Ê$51 (including tax and tip) can get you two bowls of ramen, a side of Kakuni, and a beer.

I heard such great things about Ippudo that I was sure I'd be disappointed with such high expectations. I was so happy when I was wrong, and Ippudo met all my expectations and more. I came here late one afternoon, about half an hour before they closed. ÊThe rude hostess (she seriously gave not only me, but everyone in the waiting room, or at least all the females, an attitude) told me that they weren't seating anyone anymore. ÊI said they were still open for another half hour. ÊShe said the wait would be longer than that (there were maybe 2 groups of 2-3 waiting at the time) so she couldn't seat us. I was seriously annoyed when she left to seat one group (leaving only my party of 2 and another party of 2 waiting) and another hostess came to the front. ÊMy bf asked her how long the wait would be and if we could still be seated. ÊShe punched something into her computer and said 'sure'... So after that debacle, we were seated maybe 10 minutes later. ÊI decided to forget about the rude hostess, and focus on the menu. ÊI ordered the Shiromaru Hakata Classic while the bf ordered the Akamaru Modern. ÊTo my utter delight, they were both delicious when we got them! ÊVery flavorful broth without being overly salty. Ê Definitely a winner, if you can get past their not-so-friendly hostess (from what I encountered there was only 1 rude person).

Seriously - have I not written a review for this place?! Yelp tells me no. Well over 2000 reviews - all I can add is that this is the destination for ramon - the vibe, the flavor, the flavor, the flavor. Though over an hour wait means you can never get the 5th star, despite your nirvana'ish food. TIP: go at off busy times, like 4pm, surprisingly easy to get in and I know your stomach won't mind the timing inconvenience.

Love the ramen here, I have tried the miso and "original" ramen, but the "modern" or akamaru is my personal favorite. The broth is so silky and delicious, I practically lick the bowl clean when I'm finished. I've also tried many of their appetizers, including the fried green peppers that comes with I think yuzu salt, hirata buns (pork belly buns), BBQ spare ribs, which were all yummy. The only drawback is the wait time, where it can reach up to 2 hours! It makes you wonder is it really that serious to wait that long for a bowl of ramen? ÊNo matter which day of the week, you can count on a 1-2 hour wait time, unless you're there at 5pm when they start dinner service. I have tried other places in the city, like Minca and Totto Ramen, but it doesn't compare to Ippudo. Ê5 star for food & 3 star for wait time!

3.5 Stars Ordered: Shiromaru Hakata Classic Ê Ê (Tonkotsu noodle soup topped with pork loin chashu, kikurage, menma, red pickeled ginger, sesame, and scallions) The soup was excellent - very flavourful. ÊThe noodles were chewy and delish! ÊThe chashu was tender, but lacked flavor. Service: Good - very attentive Bottom line: The bowl of ramen from Ippudo NY was good, but I just cannot justify a $20 bowl of noodles (even in NY.) Ê I think you can get something similar for a lower price.

I really wanted to like Ippudo a lot more. ÊIt was a great meal, but it wasn't as delicious as i expected such a highly revered restaurant to be. ÊThe famous pork buns were too saucy in my opinion. ÊThis caused the bun to be too salty. ÊThe bun also isn't as flavorful as it could be. Ê I had the Akamaru modern. ÊThe broth seemed too fatty. ÊThe chasu inside was bland. ÊThe noodles were cooked perfectly though.

I was hesitant to try this place but boy am I glad I did! Yes, this place is nothing like the authentic family run ramen places off the streets of JP , but it is definitely worth checking out if you are craving a good bowl of ramen in NYC. Noodles are fresh, broth is bursting with flavor and the toppings are perfectly prepared!

Ippudo boasts one of the best bowls of Japanese ramen around. When you walk in you immediately notice its nice decor and obvious Asian influence. Every time I've eaten here, I've had to wait, but never more than 30-45 minutes. Seating depends on the size of your party. If you have 2-3 people, you most likely will be seated at one of their many 'communal' tables, which I actually really like. If you have a larger party, you might have to wait longer to get your own table. Now down to bweezness. The FOOD itself is amazing. I usually order the pork buns (~$8) to start especially if I'm with friends and the Akaramu Modern ramen (~$14) as the entree. I've tried many of the ramens they offer and each BROTH tastes amazing in their own right. For those of you who don't think you'll be full off one bowl of ramen, you'd be surprised. But if you find you're still hungry at the end of the meal and you still have some broth left, you can pay a small fee for more noodles (awesome option since you CANNOT bring any leftover broth with you home). Service is great, the Japanese greetings when you arrive and leave, and the area downstairs where you can see the chefs pulling the noodles, all add to the whole Ippudo experience. Overall, Ippudo loses a star for its slightly high prices and long wait, but if you've got the time, this is a gem for any noodle-soaked-in-broth lover.

I came here with a couple friends today. Their ramen is probably one of the best that I've ever had. The service was great and Êaccommodating and would always check in with us if we wanted more tea, water, if everything was great, etc. Great service always makes for a better dining experience. The only thing I would probably say for people is if you want to eat here, you might want to come early. We came at 11 am, right when they opened for lunch and a line was already forming. Also, I suppose the other issue I could possibly think about is that it's a bit pricey for a college student on a budget. This is one of those places that you would eat out once in awhile but not a weekly occurrence if you are on a tight budget.

Ippudo is without a doubt one of my favorite restaurants in NYC. Having originated from a Japanese chain, it's no surprise that Ippudo serves the best ramen in the city. On any given night the wait time can range from 5 minutes to 3 hours (and is usually on the higher end of the spectrum) but the food is always worth it. They also have a 2 for 1 happy hour special on Kirin and Sapporo to help pass the time. My regular at Ippudo is an order of pork buns to share and the Akamaru Modern which uses a rich traditional pork bone broth base. The pork buns are a must and are way better than the ones at Momofuku in my opinion. The ramen is served piping hot, flavorful, rich, and perfectly prepared. If you're looking for something a little more traditional, the Shoyu and Miso are good options too. And for those with large appetites, the option to "kae-dama" allows you to get a second order of noodles to help with that left over broth for just $2. The service is excellent and the modern Japanese decor creates the perfect environment for me to enjoy my ramen. If you're in NYC, Ippudo is a must try.

My idea of heaven is a big table filled with many bowls of Ippudo ramen (Akamaru ramen with braised pork belly), and an inability to gain weight! As reviewer #2,360 of Ippudo--I know that whatever I say won't add much to the mix--but I will say that this is Ramen Heaven. Wow. If there's a better ramen place in NYC, please let me know. We had the Akamaru Modern ramen and the Kumamoto Tonkatsu ramen special--the Kumamoto Tonkatsu was very very good, but the Akamaru Modern was deliciousness incarnate. Get it with the braised pork belly.

Personally, I really don't get what's SOOOO great about Ippudo. I'm a huge ramen fan but I think their noodles are too thin - almost like angel hair. Their broth is very greasy and oily, and although it's delicious on the first few slurps, I'm regretting it by the end of the meal. My favorite thing on the menu are the pork buns. I actually wouldn't mind going there, having an order and a beer as a quick happy hour, if I were in the neighborhood. I'm not going to complain about the wait because it is what it is. Although, they now encourage you to leave the area and call them back to check on your status. That was a great improvement. I will however complain about the greeting staff. Understand that people are waiting for upwards of 2 hours to eat a bowl of noodles. I heard a customer say, "I hope my name comes up soon, I've been waiting a long time." She gave a smile, and rolled her eyes as she turned around to face me. Basically, she rolled her eyes at him in MY face. Then she gave me the same "smile" and asked me to confirm my name. I blankly stared at her and realized how futile it would be to even say anything. You're the short, doughy greeter at a noodle shop, not the door person at a club. Get over yourself and learn how to be courteous to your customers - especially at a Japanese restaurant to a Japanese customer.

Just wanted to let the vegetarians know that the vegetarian ramen is now on the menu. It's the Wasabi Shoyu something ramen, and broth is soy and vegetable based. It's topped with a little bit of wasabi oil, which gave it a nice kick. Still think the place is way overrated, and I know it's supposed to just be a novelty for American customers, but the constant greeting by the staff gets really annoying. Hard to carry any kind of conversation in there.

I don't care that they scored a B grade from the NYC Department of Health, I'd eat Ippudoo-doo if it tasted this good!!! ÊApparently the desire for a superb bowl of ramen trumps prissy sanitary concerns since this place is always swarming with foodies. ÊThough the appetizers are nice, be warned to save room for your ramen + kae-dama ($2 noodle refill) since this place is super wasteful by not wrapping up your leftovers. ÊIf you must eat across the menu, BYOT (Bring Your Own Tupperware) to be more eco-conscious and enjoy a 2nd round at home. Stuffed Gyoza Wings: I call this chork, chicken stuffed with pork. I love this innovation! ÊWho needs a grain based gyoza wrapper when you can just stuff that filling inside of a chicken wing?!?!? ÊIt reminds me of those minded shrimp on crab claw appetizers you sometimes find on dim sum carts. ÊThe filling itself wasn't innovative, but I loved the meat inside meat dynamic. Samurai Rib: I don't know if samurais actually ate these ribs, but I'd totally turn into a sumo if these were always at my disposal. ÊExtra generous sized pork chunks falling off the rib lacquered in a brilliant glaze. ÊSo much personality in the sauce that you can almost forget how great the meat itself is. Tori Karaage: I love me some karaage, but this was just ok. ÊThe pieces were a little dry and there didn't seem to be that much dark meat. ÊWith so many other great appetizers, don't waste your time on this one. Shiromaru Hakata Classic: I prefer the Classic over the Modern, because with all the effort put into the making the tonkotsu broth I don't want to cover up any of the complexity or subtlety. ÊThe pork bone broth is the best I've had in the States and comes very close to what I've had in Tokyo. ÊThe noodles are perfect texture, freshly shredded from the noodle sheet rolls downstairs. ÊThe chashu pork is soft and tasty, but I always order some kakuni (thick braised pork belly) Êto indulge in the fatty goodness. Akamaru Modern: Like the Shiromaru Hakata Classic but with bakudan (spicy paste) , miso paste and garlic oil. ÊAll those extras definitely make the soup more complex, but at the cost of drowning out some of the Classic undertones. ÊIf you're with a significant other or good friend, it'd be a good strategy to order both the Modern and the Classic to try them side-by-side.

Now, ya'll might think I'm easy because I give so many five-star reviews. To this, I would say that I'm just more inclined to write about experiences that are highly recommendable. i'm also more likely to warn fellow consumers of a business that BLOWS, but I minimize my attendance to these places and Êso only come across them sporadically. That said... Despite the 2 hour wait (yes, it's true) at Ippudo, eating here is a transporting experience that slams home the establishment's mission of serving the "cosmos in a bowl." A week after its 25th year of existence (est. October 15, 1985), I showed up at the glassy facade. Located on the part of 4th Avenue that is desolate in contrast to the lights of Union Square just ahead, the restaurant's popularity is signified by the masses of tourists and local Asian gourmands coincidentally all dressed in black (yet, they don't all "look the same"). There was a line to get in line, but I was already expecting this, and was thus able to numb myself against the imperious aggression of the assholes trying to take precedence over one another just to get onto the 2 hour waitlist. Once I got my name down, I escaped back outside and squeezed onto the railing of an unusually clean ramp leading nowhere (so I wasn't blocking anyone's access to anything) and sat calmly until one of my friends arrived. Once he was there, we leaned up to the paradoxically quiet bar tucked back behind the lines. We ordered a chilled glass pitcher of Sapporo and contemplated the fine clay bowls up on the wall and the squares of instant Ramen displayed under the glass counter. The third member of our party arrived, and we only waited a few more minutes with our crisp beer before being seated at a table made of the trunk of some gigantic tree. Though we were across three strangers, the table was large enough for their presence to be negligible, if not curiously soothing. We had a head-on view of the glassed in kitchen, Êbathed in steam and smoke. Service was almost as fast as any old casual joint, but there was nothing careless or quick about the food. First was the Tako Wasabi; a glistening pile of finely chopped baby octopus (not sure if the octopi were actually juveniles or of a miniature species; sorry). Fresh as a slap on the face, they offered the perfect balance between soft and crunchy and bore the sweet, cold freshness of the sea itself (though the sea is salty, seafood lovers may understand what I mean about the sweetness. Next, pork buns - bigger, more dimensional, and hence objectively BETTER than those that vaulted Momofuku's nouveau take into Western fame. The bowls we ordered were the Special (Ramen with monkfish liver and pate on toast), the Classic (original tonkotsu pork broth with a soft egg but no pork belly), and the Modern (original tonkotsu pork broth with pork belly but no egg, a scoop of miso paste, and garlic oil). Of course, I'm simplifying the ingredients. Those who will get the most out of this experience are the ones who will notice the nuances in the broth. The noodles were skinny as angelhair pasta, but even my preference for thick, chewy noodles was drowned in awe of the broths. I even said, "kae-dama" to get a fresh pile of noodles whisked over to my side for two bucks. Then, I drained the bowl.All the while, the staff gave rousing shouts of Japanese salutation to arriving and leaving customers, making us feel like we were in some den at a warrior's rally in some early century. The dimensional and slow-smoked broths made me nostalgic for places and times you've never lived in. Plenty of ramen places out there deliver novelty and tastiness, but where else can they convey warm shelter from a cold day by the sea? That's the idea behind Ippudo, which is actually a common Japanese chain marked up for American consumption. It's gourmet to us because it is so hard to find the real thing...and this "reality" necessarily revolves around a culinary "terroir" that a lot of us haven't even experienced (myself included). But at Ippudo, any fool can taste it, and it expands the imagination. My friend said that her monkfish ramen was the most "gohsoo" thing she had ever tasted; "gohsoo" being a Korean term for smoky/hearty/restorative. Looking stunned, she also declared, "This is the best Ramen I've ever had...in my life." She then tried to usurp me to pay for the meal that I had suggested and planned, so I physically fought her to the bewilderment of the staff, which was smart and respectful enough to see that I meant business and ran my card instead of hers. The damage; about 30 bucks per person AFTER tip. Well worth it. I grew up on Hamburger Helper in small town Mass, so maybe I am "easy." Well, then take it from my world traveled Seoullite companion, raised on filet mignon and 50-dish catered meals: This is a place to be reunited with the microcosmos on a bitterly cold winter day through a hot, soupy bowl of noodles.

This is what you called the Epitome of what a Ramen should be. Don't get me wrong, this fancy ramen got my vote because this was hakata ramen with variety of flavors. I don't need to say anymore. The lines are long if you come during the lunch time, but if you came tad early, I think you save about an hour of waiting. We waited approximately 15-20minutes before we got seated and this place was huge, definitely spacious. Love the decoration of different bowls at the counter and the see-through glass so you can see people preparing your dish. Came here with bunch of yelpers, Dave H, Wendy C, and Adam E, plus my Indo friends, total about 6 of us. We got seated at the corner and our server was very friendly and courteous. The ramen of my choice was #2 - Akamaru Modern that comes as 'The original tonkotsu' soup noodle with Ippudo's special sauce, pork belly chashu, cabage, kikurage, scallions, miso paste & fragrant garlic oil. I totally love what I had, the spicy miso flavor, the ingredients, I even forgot to order the flavored egg that I usually have in my ramen, so this ramen definitely topped my list. It may looked oily, but when I ate them, it's actually quite perfect, the broth was flavorful and the noodle is perfection for me, cause I love hakata style straight noodle. Back in LA, this would be Hakata Ramen Shinsegumi style-noodle, the fact that they have an option for kaedama (extra noodle) was totally a bonus for me, for a $2 you can get extra noodle and you don't even have to ask, I got it of course! I got a chance to taste my friends' broth of #1 - Shiomaru Hakata Classic and their special ramen that day, everything tasted different, so good in their own way. I also heard about the pork-bun and we ordered them, but for me, it's not that amazing as others said, however, I still liked them, just not as much as the ramen. This may not be mom and pop ramen joint, but they definitely know how to make tasty broths. I can't wait to go back to NY and come here again, especially during cold weather, this noodle would be the perfect meal of the day.

I try not to be influenced by these 2700 plus reviews that Ippudo NY has but this place was alright. When there are so many people reviewing a certain restaurant, it must be groin grabbingly good. I guess I let the hype get to me so when I was done, I was not impressed. Hindsight, the food was great and the service was excellent. Here's how it went down. We decided to try this Thursday at 11:30am with a group of 5. We only waited 5 mins because the place was still empty. We had a big table which was spacious for 5 of us. I ordered the Akamaru Modern combo with spicy chicken and decided to have two orders of pork buns to share. The pork buns were great but come on. Any fatty pork in any cuisine is amazing! I think the momofuku ones were a tad better. The combo was plenty of food. I did not finish it all which is rare for me. The salad was great. The ramen was good but it was definitely really rich. I'm jaded by all the great ramen places in california like santa ramen. The spicy chicken was fried chicken with rice which was okay. Overall I think this place is great if you are craving it. I would not wait more than 30 mins.

It has taken me this long to try out Ippudo but I'd attribute that to the no reservations / crazy long wait issue. We arrived today, day before New Year's Eve, around 1pm thinking the wait would be minimal. ÊWe were wrong. ÊOne and a half hour wait so we decided to grab a beer at nearby Central Bar. ÊMade it back to Ippudo just in time to be seated (thank goodness they didn't call our name earlier). Ê As we headed to our table, it seemed the entire kitchen and wait staff screamed in delight. ÊWe later confirmed that it is a Japanese tradition of welcoming us. ÊWe loved it! For appetizers we split the pork buns -- maybe it was because it was 2:30pm, I was a little buzzed and very hungry but they were DELICIOUS. ÊA perfect "amuse bouche" before our meal. ÊAfter reading the Yelp reviews, I chose to order either the "Shiromaru Hakata Classic" or the "Akamura Modern". ÊMy friend said she's had the Modern two times before and liked it so I chose that. ÊI thought everything was great. ÊThe broth was flavorful and slightly salty. ÊThe veggies and meat were just the right amount. ÊThe noodles were not too al dente but not limp either. ÊThe only strange part was the "ball of paste" on top of each of our noodles. ÊMy friend who got the miso ramen completely removed hers since it was too gingery for her but I ended up keeping mine in the soup -- turned out it was a flavor ball of goodness. Great first experience, would definitely return!

TIME: Any night for dinner PLACE: I came here on a Monday night in July with a party of 2 and had to wait 40 minutes, but the happy hour bar until 6 made it worth it. We sat at the bar and watched people cooking, always reassuring when a place doesn't hide their kitchen. FOOD: Very Very good. I came here because it was on the "best thing I ever ate" list for it's modern ramen. The ramen is perfectly cooked, in amazing broth and had tasty pork in it too. The pork buns were also equally amazing as well as the spice tofu. Recommended: The modern ramen DRINKS: Sake and Beer, Sapporo and Kirin on tap. TIPS: Come on a weekend, and you may have to wait upwards of 2 hours... I recommend weekday nights, before 7 as a good time to plan to arrive.

Holy Moly! Did a bit of research and found that Ippudo has the most reviews on Yelp which beats Shake Shack by 105 reviews as of November 4th 2010 at 11:00 AM. Got here on a Monday at 5PM. They weren't open yet, but I saw a mini line forming already. A few minutes later doors were opened and we were seated rather quickly. Upbeat, funny atmosphere (the workers were screaming every other minute) the decor is absolutely unique, very attractive too, for example the different ramen bowls across the wall. Now I can say I experienced it and my review can get lost with the other almost 2k reviews here. It's seriously way too hyped up. Ê Food, Attitude, Cost, & Taste `````````````````````````````````````` F: Of course have to try the infamous pork buns. I had the Shiromaru Hakata Classic and my friend tried a different ramen. A: Super fast service, but we didn't feel rush. It was pretty loud with the kitchen and workers flying here and there. Not the most peaceful place to have conversation. Though it's a pretty fun place to hang out at. C: OVERPRICED! An average bowl of ramen runs about $15 and that's not including tax or tips. Now you're looking at about $20 for ramen. Hey if you have the resources knock yourself out. Once in awhile is okay, but I can say it's not worth it. If their prices looked a little nicer then it would've got 5 stars from me, but no there's just too many other options. They are pretty greedy with the portions too. T: - Pork buns, yes the pork is very tender and flavorful, but it was a pretty thin piece that the buns will take away the flavor of the pork. They need to give a fatter piece! - Shiromaru Hakata Classic, they provide a big spoon, which is too big and the portions are quite small, not much use of a big spoon, but it does look cool and looks cute too. Thin ramen, there's really only 3 super thin pieces of pork loin, what?!! That's so greedy. The broth was heavenly I loved it, finished every drop of it (exaggerating.. almost every drop).

ÊLuckily, we found a bar close by and chilled there for awhile, but I cannot imagine waiting like this all the time, especially in a place like NY where there's good food on almost every block. Upon being seated, I totally fell in love with the hip decor and art work posted all throughout the restaurant. ÊEverything here screamed Japan, totally reminded of a place I would find in Tokyo, very cool! ÊHowever, for some reason, a major headache came on and the loud music + people talking just aggravated the pain. ÊI got to sample our appetizers, but sadly, by the time my ramen arrived, I had to put my head down. ÊEverything that came to our table looked and smelled amazing, from the plating to the aroma, I was just happy to see everyone enjoying their food. ÊTrust me, I was reminded all throughout the trip how good their food tasted and how much I missed out on. Ê:( Of the things that I've tried, their pork buns + chicken buns were across the board average, but I really enjoyed the hirata wings and miso kakuni (pork belly), but were very flavorful. ÊAlthough I didn't get to eat my ramen, I did try some of the broth from various bowls and they were all oishii! ÊMy definition of a nice bowl of ramen is always in its broth and Ippudo definitely did not disappoint. ÊI can see what the hype and fuss about this place is all about. A place worth checking out when you are in NY, but be prepared to wait, no matter big or small your party may be.

Pros - (Quality) - If you've been to Japan, you can tell that Ippudo has authentic Japanese ramen. The thick, heavy and salty broth takes u back to the back alleys and tiny ramen shops. However, if your only experience with ramen are either Shin Cup or the 79 cent plastic packaged ones from the supermarket, then you're in for an "errr... what is this" moment. Japanese ramen has a very thick broth, heavy, salty and a bit on the fatty side. ÊAside from ramen, Ippudo also offers a good selection of appetizers. We had the pork buns which were really good, highly recommended. Cons - (Price) - If you're used to eating noodles in Chinatown on the cheap end, you'll be shocked at the pricey ramen and the few slivers of meat in each bowl. We think the cost really comes from the thick soup broth instead of the toppings. One bowl of ramen is probably not going to be filling if you came here starving but you can always add extra servings of noodles in your bowl for $2 per serving. The noodles are a bit mushy, not al dente at all and the wait here is pretty long on weekends no matter the time. Recommendation: Pork Buns, Authentic Japanese Ramen Comparable to: Oh Taisho's ramen in St.Marks.

Gotta have it! Going to Ippudo NY was one of the best decisions during my trip. The pork buns were expensive!! $4 for each pork bun but they were worth it. The meat was uniquely tender and filled with flavor. I'm craving one right now actually. I had the seasonal special spicy ramen, KarakaKogashimiso, and it was just as good as the pork buns! The soup was thicker than what I'm used to but it was goooooood! My total bill with tax and tip came out to just under $30 but those were some of the best $30 I've spent!!

I wouldn't wait two hours for a table here, but I can totally understand why this place is so popular. I mean, it's chic, it's sexy, it's delicious, it's classy... What's not to like? Some may complain about this being overpriced for ramen- I say that if you're looking for something that's a little upscale without breaking the bank, Ippudo is an excellent choice. Maybe I am buying into the hype, but the two times I've been to Ippudo I've really felt like it's the place to be, or whatever. I know everyone and their kid sister has been obsessed with Ippudo since it opened, but it's really just effortlessly cool. The mob up front is hidden from view once you're at your table, so you don't feel overcrowded or rushed. It's a little dim and noisy, but not to the point where you're yelling at your dinner partner or reading the menu by the light of your cell phone. As for the lines, I suggest you trying going on a weeknight, so you don't have to contend with such an epic wait time. Just give in your name and fifteen minutes and a half price beer at the bar later, you've got yourself a seat at New York's hottest ramen joint. Of course, a happening atmosphere can only get you so far, and where Ippudo really brings it home is with the food, which is freaking delicious. In general I'm not really crazy about brothy noodle dishes, but I absolutely loved the ramen on both of my visits. The first time I was there around their first anniversary, and they had a special ramen with a little yuzu paste that you mixed into the broth after you ate all the noodles. It was just very rich and flavorful and there was no way I wasn't drinking up all that broth. The regular ramen is great too, and there are some fabulous appetizers as well. The pork belly buns and shrimp buns are delicious on their pillowy white bread. There was also a luscious melt in your mouth pork belly special one of the times I went that was just to die for. If you're morally opposed to a $15 bowl of ramen and turn up your nose at the thought of waiting in line, then Ippudo is just not going to be your cup of tea. But if you like to be out someplace cool and don't mind paying a little bit more than the norm for some truly delicious food, then Ippudo is sure to please.

Coming from a highly concentrated Asian area of Orange County, I have had my fair share of ramen. Looking at the reviews and hearing the praises for this place got me really excited to try something in New York. The restaurant is nicely decorated and the large group booths are roomy and inviting. The menu is simple; I got the Shiromaru Hakata Modern (whatever the one is with "modern" in it; third down) as a set with the spicy chicken rice and salad ($16). A little pricier than what I'm used to, but the bowl is a sizable opponent and the rice bowl adds a nice additional option. The spinach salad was dressed moderately with a simple balsamic vinaigrette, and the spicy chicken was not at all spicy, but the sauce on it was good. I only got 3 pieces of chicken while my friend who got the eel only received 2 pieces, which is not enough for the rice. Our bowls came out and the toppings were noticeably slim, with each bowl getting only 2 pieces of pork chasu. However, the broth was very nicely flavored, and light, which is important because some ramen broth is way too oily. The noodles were the most well cooked noodles I've had in my life so far and I definitely stretched my stomach by ordering the set, but hey, it was my only chance. The spicy ramen (I forget the name) was very unique and the spice combined with the ramen flavors melded together perfectly in a subtle yet strong broth. I tried a bite of my friend's pork bun, which was tender and adequately sauced, but it wasn't as heavenly as it has been made out to be. I'm pretty sure you can find something equivalent or maybe (dare I say it) better in Chinatown. I would have liked to do a bit more exploring in the city because it seems like this is hipster-chic hype.

"Yes, sure I will wait 2 1/2 hours for noodles" Umm, yeah. ÊRamen is the best food on earth. ÊI worship at the place that will be marginally the same as every other noodle place in East Village.

Expect a 1-2 hour wait if you're going for lunch/dinner. ÊBut once the rush passes, its still a little less than an hour's wait. So the Hirata (Pork) Buns are the appetizer favs here and the Akamaru Modern is the ramen fav. ÊI was taken here by a coworker who surprised me and everyone else I've taken here has left with a pretty happy stomach :D (all except the ones who decided to try something other than ramen which is quite risky hahaha). There's rarely a place I'd say is "MUST GO" place to try in NYC but this place, I'm glad to say is one of them :)

#171 NY Review #8 LA, taken as a whole, has amongst the best Asian cuisine you'll find in the US. That said, Ippudo was the ONLY Asian place I put on my NYC food list in preparation for my trip. I figured that nothing would be spectacular enough to overlook NYC's other cuisine specialties given the limited number of meals we would have. In short, I can say that Ippudo lived up to the hype and was as good as my favorites in LA (Daikokuya, Santouka, Shinsengumi, Mottainai), and even better in a couple cases. I ordered the Akamaru Modern (picture: http://www.yelp.com/biz_É). The tonkotsu soup base was slightly superior to anything I've had in LA. It was richer and more flavorful than Daikokuya's Kotteri style, and throw in the pork belly being uber-soft *drool*. In fact, a friend (whom I will not identify) said, "I would bathe in that soup". Me... no thanks haha. The two things I didn't care for were the noodles and the limited number of pork belly slices (2). The noodles were a thinner style than I prefer (in the Shinsengumi mold, if you're familiar). I like a thicker noodle, like at Daikokuya. I can't put Ippudo #1 on my ramen list, but it's definitely in the top three. Damn, I wish I had tried those pork buns too.

I'm a ramen fanatic, and this place was Okay for me. ÊIt's good ramen that's different than most other places however I honestly can't see what the big hype is. ÊWhy is there a two hour line for this place at 9PM on a weekday? I have no idea. ÊIt was good but I've had better ramen (japantown in los angeles for example). ÊIt's flavor seemed unique however rather mild. ÊThe $14-17 price range is somewhat impressive considering ramen is still ramen but this is NYC I suppose. ÊService was excellent. ÊHonestly, what I'm most impressed with is how unlike most places where you will be thirsty for hours after your ramen meal, this place does not leave you with that feeling... a sign of a well made msg-free broth :)

I didn't have to wait in line...even on popular Thursday nights =) Twice I've been here and twice blown away by how delicate and delicious every single bite of the food is at Ippudo. The hype is well deserved. The noodles (original, salt flavored, soy sauce flavored) are infused with flavor from the soup base (which I suspect has been stewed with pork and/or fish for a very long time) and comes in different kinds of beautiful ceramic bowls depending on which kind of noodles you get. I've tried the pork buns and the braised ribs and both are excellent, with the Samurai Ribs being the outstanding superstar. The meat is sticky and glazed over with sweet plum sauce and falls right off of the bone. This "barbeque" is better than any of the real barbeque joints I've been to in the city. Ippudo is a hit everytime and will no doubt impress taste buds across the board. Another adorable thing about Ippudo is it has the cutest loveseats around the central bar area. Great overall dcor that doesn't detract from the real star - the food!!!

I'm in shock that I did not put up a review of this place! If my memory is serving me correctly, it was around Fall of 2009 that I went to NYC with one of my cousins. Before our trip, a few friends who have visited the city have talked a great deal about Ippudo. I really didn't believe the hype until I have tried it myself. I was glad that we arrived at Ippudo just when they opened for dinner because the line has a long tail after 10 minutes. The workers there are super energetic and very welcoming. They make the ramen noodles right infront of you and the broth is to die for. I've never tasted anything as phenomenal and addictive! I seriously think they put drug in the soup because I just can't explain why or how they are so freakishly delicious! You just have to try it yourself as words will not do it any justice. All of their side dishes are great as well. This is a place that I MUST visit if I ever go to NYC again. No, seriously, it would be on top of my itinerary. I wouldn't be surprised if I make a trip to NYC just for it. LOL

The ramen is outstanding and the Hirata Pork Buns are like little, pillowy bites of heaven. My favorite ramen is The Modern which never disappoints. If I could get an apt right next door to Ippudo, I would take it in a heartbeat! Tip: Go with a larger group of people (4+) because you will get seated faster, believe it or not. They reserve their bigger tables for such groups.

I hate saying this but the pork buns at Ippudo are so much better then Momofuko... The special sauce makes all the difference. I've been dying to eat at Ippudo since since last October when I was in NY when they couldn't take a table of 5 at 8:30 in the evening, because the wait would be over 2 hours and they would be close to closing time... What BS is that... Regardless, I had to try it because my sister swear by it and as soon as I dropped off my bags at her apartment this time around, we headed for Ippudo right away. ÊAlthough there was a 30 min wait (it was cold outside, ergo... Everyone wanted hot noodles...) it was to ally worth it!!!! I added bamboo shoots and an egg in my, totally the way to go.

Heard about this place from my friend/old roommate who lives here, he suggested we meet up at this place, as it is his favorite ramen. I warned him that I am a bit of a ramen snob and that we all started eating ramen back home (Katana Ya, Maru Ichi, Himawari, Ramen Dojo, Shoki, Santa, etc), but he insisted that it was very good, or at least to him it was. So we met up at Ippudo after roaming NYU's campus for a bit. The place was packed! A 1 hour wait, but hey, for great food I'll wait a good while. The place was very nice... it was very hip and trendy, and the decor was cool. While waiting, we started drinking, as it was happy hour, and the beer deals were pretty good. Janette ordered Akamaru Ramen and I ordered the special Wasabi Noodle Ramen. Akamaru Ramen - this and Ramen Dojo have the best looking ramen presentation. They really make it look like a luxury soup as opposed to the stuff you get on sale at Safeway, 10 for a buck. The broth was delicious, probably my top broth. You could taste the good quality of the bonito and other stocks (I think pork?). The pork was also very juicy and tender. The noodles are the best in the business, from what I've had. Wasabi Noodle Ramen - again the broth was delicious with a hint of wasabi coming from the noodles. The noodles had a nice light green color from the wasabi, and the flavor was just otherworldly. Very different from any ramen I have had, and the take on it was so unique, with the execution being a 10. The pork also had a bit of the wasabi taste, which was strange, but expected. I personally liked the Akamaru Ramen better. Pricewise, I ding it a bit because its a lot more than what I'm used to paying for when eating at Ramen joints. However, the flavors are so great here... I have a 3 way tie between this place's Akamaru Ramen, Ramen Dojo's Pork Broth Spicy Ramen, and Maru Ichi's Kuro Ramen. I think I need to eat here when I come back again, because this might be a 5... and probably my favorite ramen spot. Too bad I live on the other side of the country =(

I'm not kidding when I say that I dream about this place. ÊI literally dream about eating their Akamaru Modern ramen with a poached egg and pork buns. ÊA friend introduced me to this place on a sweltering July day. ÊHe wanted Ramen...when it was like 100 degrees outside? ÊWell, regardless of the temperature outside, once we were cooled by the A/C and in the cave-like atmosphere, slurping our noodles, it could have been armageddon outside and I wouldn't have cared.

Rich, creamy, and VERY satisfying tonkatsu ramen. I happen to be a huge fan of tonkatsu broth...that buttery porky deliciousness is so satisfying. ÊAnd this place does it *well.* First things first, the wait is out of control, but I knew that so we put our name in and went for a walk. ÊI called about 35 minutes later to check in and they let me know it was just about time to head back. ÊWe went back and were seated within 5 minutes. I love the decor, and the way they use the chairs with arms on one side to partition off the pairs of diners around the big table in the middle. I ordered the shisito peppers as a starter, and really enjoyed them with the yuzu salt for dipping. ÊI did feel they were a little oilier than versions I've had at other places, probably because they are fried rather than grilled. ÊI think I prefer grilled, as you get that blackened outer skin that is very satisfying. My companion had the tonkatsu classic, which was very, very good. ÊPretty much spot on. ÊI had the modern tonkatsu, and I loved the flavors. ÊReally good tonkatsu with a twist. ÊI did find myself jealous of his egg, so I think I'd add one to mine next time. Ê The noodles were nice and firm and yet so thin...just wonderful. In fact, the only reason I'm going with 4 stars instead of 5 is that I did not find the chashu pork nor the kakuni pork to be as flavorful as I've had elsewhere. ÊIn fact, the chashu tasted almost like turkey it was so innocent. ÊIt was not bad, just not the delicious treat that I really like to have in my ramen. ÊIf they can get some more flavor out of their pork, I'll move it up to 5 stars for sure. I'm full, warm, and happy!

Now that denying the arrival of winter is no longer feasible it's time to explore the avenues in which one can reasonably keep warm despite snowstorms and below freezing temperatures. Sure, staying indoors wrapped in a cozy blanket with a hot cocoa in hand is always a good option. But for those who prefer not to turn into a temporary hermit ramen houses are an ideal venue for getting together with friends. In most of Japan ramen is a quick meal. You'll find ramen shops near train stations where commuters will have a bowl on their way home after a long day at work. Often these places won't even have seating. All you see is a line of 'salary men' in their business suits behind a low curtain hungrily slurping down steaming bowls of noodles. And then there are cities like Hakata, where ramen making is an art form and ramen houses are destinations. Tonkotsu ramen is one of Hakata's claims to fame and it is this flavorful pork bone based broth that has become widely popular even in New York. Ippudo, a ramen store chain that originated from Hakata opened its first overseas location in New York back in 2008. Boosted by a pre-existing following made up of Japanese expats in New York, Ippudo was an immediate hit. Complete with the obligatory welcoming shouts of 'irasshai-mase!' Ippudo is a veritable ramen experience that is as dizzying as it is satisfying. The classic tonkotsu ramen is the main draw of course but the Akamaru Modern, with their 'umami dama' miso paste is the favorite of many. It is comfort food in a bowl, one that epitomizes umami, that taste that is so basic yet so complex, and often quite elusive among Western cooking. Of course, as with all good things in New York, to experience Ippudo comes with a price. In this case, it isn't your pocket that will have to pay as a bowl of ramen here comes at $15, but getting a seat at Ippudo might just cost you your patience. Ippudo's ever-growing popularity along with their no-reservations policy means at least an hour of wait time during peak hours. So unless you have time to spare go for lunch or try to get there before 6pm.

Ippudo was a restaurant at the top of my list on my recent visit to NY. It is a definite step up from Momofuku but overall I wasn't all that impressed. There's been so much hype about this place. Maybe my expectations were too high but it doesn't beat any of the ramen places LA has to offer. I got the Shiromaru Hakata Classic. The broth had signs of the signature cloudy white-colored tonkotsu broth but it was simply missing something. It needed something to give it that extra oomph. The broth wasn't so thick and the noodles reminded me of the super thin Chinese noodles. They cooked the 1/2 boiled egg just right. I love it when the yolk is just a little bit raw. The texture is more moist and gooey which definitely beats dried up overcooked yolk. You get thick pieces of the chashu and it's more than what you'll get from Momofuku. We got the Bakudan which is Ippudo's original spicy paste. If you like your food spicy then I highly suggest you add the paste to your ramen. I was initially disappointed with the portion but I was completely stuffed by the time I finished everything. The ambience was very nice. Dark and romantic but can also make for a great night out with friends. The service was top notch. I even got a nice butt massage during dinner whenever the subway would zoom by down below.

Normally, I wouldn't wait an hour and a half for ramen. I love ramen, just not that much... but my sister does, so we waited. Wait didn't end up being that bad. They have a bar up front and it was happy hour, so beers were 2 for 1. You can also order appetizers. Hirata buns were delicious, though a little pricey at $8 for 2 pieces. Pork was definitely tastier than the chicken. My sister and I both ordered the akamaru modern. The noodles were okay, but the broth was amazingly delicious! My bf had the classic. He liked it, but I preferred mine. My broth had a little spicy kick. If you have leftover broth, you can order another ball of noodles for $2.

Had to visit this place after hearing that it was better than Totto Ramen. ÊHad the Shiromaru Classic and the Akamaru Modern, and the Shiromaru was soo good, putting it above Totto. ÊThe other one was nothing crazy- the ramen was good but the broth was nothing special. ÊThe pork buns were amazing (thanks fellow yelpers for suggesting!), although the shrimp ones could be skipped. ÊI had the sweetest plum wine on the wine list, and it is worth a try. ÊThey diluted it with ice cubes so the sweetness was just right, very smooth too.

The 2000+ reviews that say BEST RAMEN EVER are not lying. Though I don't know how often I will wait an hour+ for a bowl of ramen. Delicious, delicious ramen, and on a Friday night, yes, but an hour for a party of two? Only once in a blue moon, I'm afraid. Maybe they make you wait so long so you order more - I'm onto you, Ippudo! No but seriously, best ramen ever. The noodles taste so fresh, and all the other ingredients mix together so perfectly. Akamaru Modern all the way. And I am a fan of the humongous spoons to help me slurp. Appetizers (gyoza and fried chicken?) and dessert (orange sorbet) were good too. Service was pretty good: we were checked on and my water glass was never empty, so points for that.

ÊAlthough behind the flairs the broth wasn't enough to be considered the "best" as many are pointing out nor is it good enough to merit a hefty price tag and a 1.5-2 hour wait. ÊIt's a definite tourist favorite

Maybe my expectations were too high because of all the great ratings. ÊI just thought Ippudo's ramen were just good. ÊThe noodles were nice and had a nice bite, but I found the broth too salty and concentrated. I read in the reviews about the decor and ambiance, but still, I was not impressed. ÊIt was OK. ÊI don't even think it was date worthy. ÊI went downstairs to use the restroom and was a little grossed out. ÊThe bathroom was dirty and the whole downstairs smelled like rotting meat. ÊI've been in butcher shops that smelled better than their basement. I definitely will not be returning.

Definitely worth the wait! I love the artsy and spirited feel of this place. The ramen is absolutely delicious and has a unique blend of spices. Akamaru Modern and Classic are both great choices. If you're looking for something to drink try the Calpico High, its a sake cocktail that is so refreshing.

Noticed I put 3 stars while back. I think i have to update that. I'll put 4. Sure, the walk-in/walk-out experience is a bit much with all the yelling, but the modern ramen is the BIZZOMB. So yeah. This, and Momofuku, and Totto Ramen are my top three ramen spots not necessarily in that order.

One of the best places to dine during a cold winter/fall night in NY. The wait wasn't too bad, if you go around 530pm, expect to be seated around 615pm on a Friday night. Beware of parties or individuals trying to take your reservation or place in line. Someone tried to come in as an "Erin" when they called out "Eric" for party of 2. Just saying. ÊStarted off the night with pork buns and they were as good as everyone else has yelped about, so recommend trying those. ÊThe hamachi carpaccio was as good as any ive tried. ÊWe ordred the samurai rib and the mest simply fell off the bone, it was amazing, cooked to perfection, better than even the American steakhouses. We tried the popular and coveted Akamaru Modern ramen and the Tori ramen. Tori was on the light side when compared to the Akamaru Modern. ÊBoth were delicious, and great to enjoy and eat on a cold night.

I absolutely loved it! :) We came at noon on Black Friday, and the wait was 1 hour. eek. But not unexpected. So instead, we went to grab some takoyaki and taiyaki around the area, and then shopped for a little. It was not a great idea to eat takoyaki and taiyaki before ramen. . . . I was SO FULL and was regretting my lack of judgment by eating almost the entire order of takoyaki by myself right before we were being seated at Ippudo. I was afraid I wouldn't be able to enjoy the ramen. But nope, everything was AMAZING. Even though I was so full, I still couldn't stop eating! We ordered the house special ramen (tonkotsu shoyu ramen) and Akamaru Modern with set (A) Mentaiko (spicy cod roe) over rice. The rice came first. We ordered it not knowing what to expect. It was a small bowl of rice with a little bit of mayo, seaweed, and spicy roe on top. Looked unassuming, but boy was it tasty. I highly recommend! Everything just combined together so smoothly and the spiciness gave the rice a kick. Tonkotsu shoyu ramen has the typical round noodles. The soup was super oily, but that's most likely what made it so amazing. The noodles were cooked just perfectly. But I did notice that there was no egg to be found! I always assume ramen comes with eggs. But oh well, it was good nonetheless. And the pork slices it came with were so fatty, they seemed to melt in my mouth. Hmmmm. Akamaru Modern is entirely different from Tonkotsu Shoyu. The noodle itself is different. It's much thinner, which allowed it to retain more of the flavor from the spicy soup base. A note though. By 1PM, the wait was 2.5 hours. And the restaurant is so busy it's a bit hard to get service. You won't get a specific server assigned to you, so flag whoever you see down and tell them what you need.

Went here today for lunch, I was impressed with the energy of the staff. However, I am a jew, and there lack of non-pork items came off as a bit anti-Semitic. However if you do ask they have a vegetarian option. The Ramen I had was alright... they did have legitimate Japanese people making the food, this is key for good Ramen. I also felt the spice was just right. The chairs were awesome, they had this comfy yet open feeling to them! I also had the peppers for an appetizer, they were fun, not mind blowing, but good to try. The waits are a little rough, 30 minutes for lunch. Worth a try I'd say! But be aware almost everything has pork

Saturday night, 6:30 pm, 1 hour and 15 minute wait for my brother and I. How to kill time during this wait? We walked our little greedy guts a few blocks over down to Momofuku, ordered their famed pork buns to go, and ate them on the walk back to Ippudo, lol! Then we ordered pork buns at Ippudo to compare. Momofuku's artful hoisin-cucumber combination prevails triumphantly as the victor over Ippudo's overpowering spicy mayo-lettuce combination. The consistency of the bun was also more tasteful at Momofuku's, but both versions were extremely delicious in their own orgasmic way. A sidenote about the ramen here at Ippudo: was truly worth the hype and wait. I wonder how cool they must feel to be one of the MUST EAT places when anyone from out of town visits NY! The broth was flavorful and creamy, and paired so well with the slightly al dente noodles. The interior is modern, interesting, and the whole experience is a feast for your eyes as much as it is for your taste buds. I love how the staff yells out to greet each customer as they are seated!

You know how in basketball games where jeering fans go "OVER-RATED, [CLAP CLAP, CLAP CLAP CLAP]??" This is exactly how it is. I'm not a big fan of Hakata style noodles to begin with, but Ippudo really just over cooked my bowl of noodles to soft textureless starch. The soup was warm (not exactly what I imagined after waiting for so long in the middle of winter), the broth itself wasn't as nearly as rich as most places. Overall, this place just really didn't live up to its name. If you are ever in Japan, try their 7-11 instant ramen cups, I actually prefer it over the actual store in New York.

There is no doubt this is the best ramen place in the city. I have tried their shiromaru and akamaru modern: they are both absolutely delicious. The noodles are very thin and firm, the pork is cooked just right and the soup is very rich in flavor. Their pork bun appetizer is also fabulous. ÊIt has a very trendy decor and cheerful ambiance, so it's a great place for a fun date. The downside of this place, however, is that there is always a ridiculously long wait. It's also quite pricey: $14 for a bowl of ramen is unheard of not only in Japan but also anywhere else in the city. Totto Ramen's quality of food is on par with Ippudo and the wait isn't as bad. It's also a lot cheaper. ÊI would come back here once in awhile for the sake of their awesome food, but I will probably end up going to Totto Ramen more often.

I have tried Ippudo 3 times... 2 were great and 1 was not so much... but I will explain why. The first time I visited, I thought it was the greatest ramen ever! I was greeted with random but happy shouts of Japanese from the wait and kitchen staff, and you can't help but shout at least something back. Quite comical, but adds to the environment of the restaurant. I loved the ambiance ÊIt was the complete ultimate UMAMI experience. I ordered the Akamaru Modern with kakuni Ê(braised pork belly). The pork belly was just the right blend and texture of meat and fat and had great flavor. Another time I went with a large party and we all felt like we had umami overdose aka MSG poisoning. Literally everyone in our group of 10 felt like passing out afterwards, and boy was everyone cranky. Many people had vowed not to return after that incident, but I still held on to a glimmer of hope... I returned a 3rd time and had an experience similar to the first, so I had regained my favor in Ippudo. Overall, I still really like this ramen joint. It's a little pricey, but for the experience and quality I would say go for it!

There must be some sort of ramen-crack in Ippudo's broth. It's addictive, just salty enough! I came here a lot for winter comfort food. All their broth is flavored with meat, so definitely not a place for vegetarian. Their ramen portions are generous, and you can order extra toppings or noodles. For lunch, they have huge sets. Like most Japanese restaurants, substitutes are not allowed. Their prices are a few bucks pricier than other surrounding ramen shops. But it is well worth it. The area is nice and spacious. However the bar in the front is very removed from the dining area and quite cluttered since that is also the waiting area. There are private dining tables, but also communal tables and bar seating.

Super busy ramen house... We had to wait 2.5 hrs on a Saturday night. Gotta be a fire hazard with all the people crammed inside the lobby/bar area. The decor is super awesome though the music is incredibly loud as well. Service was better than decent but not spectacular. The menu was large but doable. We tried the Modern, Tori, and the special. I was not impressed by the portions or the ramen. The soup base was delicious but the noodles were sub-par. Extra noodles were $2, a rip off if you ask me! The bill came out to an unbelievable $90+ for four people! I'd recommend Shin Sen Gumi in the LA area instead. I know, the other side of the country but I was only visiting NYC.

3.5 Stars.. I am a ramen fan from the west coast and Ippudo was my first ramen experience in the east coast. We came on a Friday evening (beat the storm) and had to wait only 25 minutes until we got seated at the bar. No biggie. Each time a waiter/waitress seats a party the whole chef lineup screams in Japanese and it provided funny welcoming vibe (among the OONCE OONCE OONCE music in the background). I found it funny... Haha! Two waters came like bam*bam* right when we sat down. We got the pork buns since it was supposedly popular. Seeing them make it by the counter.. it wasn't so special--sweet glazed pork (something or rather like that), mayonnaise, and lettuce, between prepackaged white buns. I found the pork to be dry. The lettuce added crunch and the mayo.. was edible. For $8.. I'll try something else if I come another time I got the Tori Ramen and in that bowl, the broth (chicken and pork) is the majority of the reason why it is getting 3 stars--it reminded me of my mom's home cooked broth. Very refreshing. The boodles were fine, nothing to special, and I would personally prefer the egg noodles from Himawari in San Mateo, CA.. anyway. The pork that came with it was dry as hell and had no taste. If you want eggs, you pay extra $2. You want more of that dry pork? $4 more. and at the $15 base price, it makes me miss Himawari/Ramen Dojo!! My gf got the Akamaru Modern Ramen and I had a taste of the broth. She liked it, but I was secretly glad i didn't get the Tonkatsu base. I liked the soup in my Tori...Heheh =p 2 bowls of ramen, 2 edible pork buns, and good service--Tax/tip $50--Okay.

Definitely a 3.5 star place, especially with all the hype, it's a lot better if you go in expecting it for what it is: a long wait for what is ultimately good (not great) Ramen, great pork (and subsequently pork buns) I would probably never come back if the pork wasn't as tender and succulent as it is. Really, one of the few things that people say melts in your mouth and actually does. Otherwise, it's just ridiculously expensive for a bowl of soup and noodles. I like the space though. It's small and intimate, which makes it great for when you're eating, but this, compounded by the hype, causes the long lines.

With close to 1700 reviews now, at this point reviewing Ippudo is not about "reviewing," but more "Look, I've been here too! Aren't I cool!" Although many of my Yelp friends (okay, which one of my NY friends haven't yelped this place?) have reviewed Ippudo, I have to give the credit to Judy K. for bringing Ippudo to my attention first. More than a year after I hear about it, I finally make it there, which is a lot like the speed at which I adopt technology.* And as usual, Judy K. is correct about everything. That's usually how it is with Judy's reviews. Whenever I think about what I'd like to eat or where I should eat, I ask myself, "WWJKD?" (What would Judy K do?). In fact sometimes having Judy as your friend is a little detrimental because whenever I make a vow that I'll cook more, it's like Judy knows and she'll yelp about some really fabulous place that undermines the best laid plans that I had about being good and minding my budget for a change. I would get upset by all this, except I'm too happy from all that good food. Oh, so the ramen. . . I got the Akamura Modern ramen ($14) with the soft-boiled egg for another $2 (Easily the most expensive boiled egg that I've ever eaten, but I grew up with an egg in ramen and it just seems WRONG not to have an egg with ramen. It's not even a large egg. It was rather small.). Yes, so delicious fragrant creamy pork broth, but what really makes this stand out is the black garlic oil. Oh, dear lord, I would pour that oil on just about anything. It is indeed a very delicious bowl of ramen. At $16 (after the egg, ramen without an egg is just wrong, so wrong) a bowl, it's also a rather expensive bowl. The wait at Ippudo is ridiculous. No other way to describe it. Two people on a Saturday at 5:30, still ended up being an hour wait., which we had known and planned for, so we went around the corner to Central Bar and had a drink instead of being cramped in the crowded tiny bar area at Ippudo. *I didn't own a cell phone until 2005.

My friends and I came to New York as tourists and were craving for some ramen since the weather was cold. Of course, this had the most reviews which we thought oh why not just give it a try. We came during lunchtime so the wait wasn't that long, but usually this place gets packed. Once we got seated, we were all so excited to order. We ordered 3 plates of pork buns. Apparently, that's what everyone gets here. Also, the fact that they were 10 dollars for only two bunns made me think are these actually that good to be this expensive?! As soon as i took one bite of that pork bun, it was like heaven! It was AHHHHMAZING! The sauce, the bun, the meat, everything about that pork bun was amazing. I savored every bit of it. It was the best thing I ever tasted during the whole trip. Those pork buns made my day. The ramen was pretty good too especially when they made their own noodles downstairs. I had to give them props for that because there were no other place that I know would make their own noodles. Overall, this place made my day and I will forever remember it.

PORK BASE - NO GO Ippudo's is more of a watery shio base with Tonkotsu flavor plus the noodles are too thin. MISO BASE - GO My friend had the Akamaru Modern and I wished I had gotten it instead but not to die for - well seasoned, balanced with a bit of spicey zing. If you go there I suggest this one over the pork base options. PORK BUNS They're good but if you've been to Momofuku Saam Bar it does not compare. ATMOSPEHERE The service is good and the staff are friendly, I do love the way they greet you in unison upon arrival and get's you hyped up for the meal. However the music is way too loud unless you like shouting to your friend who is sitting 1 ft. away from you. Then again maybe they want to encourage you to fill up on their soup by getting you dehydrated so you don't notice you don't have enough noodles in your bowl....and if by chance your still not full beware of their $2 "Kae-dama" noodle system (see below). Please give us ample noodles to eat from the get-go and stop trying to make money, your place is packed with people all the time, you can afford it! ABOUT KAE-DAMA "Kae-dama is a system that offers you an extra serving of noodles. ÊWhen you have almost finished your first serving of noodles, order by saing " Kae-dama, please." ÊIn a few minutes the server will bring you another 'ball of noodles', and put it in the soup.

Crowded, pompous, not amazing food, and overpriced. If you want to drop some bills on a chic asian dinner, there are way better places to do it. Places where the wait staff might be a little more attentive, for starters. Of course, it's got a reputation for being good, so if you're with someone who has no taste they might be impressed.

I went here to see what all the good reviews are about. I'd actually walked by this places a million times since I used to work a few blocks south of this place. After a short wait, I was seated at a table with some strangers. Taking a look around, that is to be expected, as they try to fill up all the tables. Compared to the other ramen places in Manhattan, this place's decor looks much better on the inside. It actually has lots of tables and chairs, unlike those small ramen bars with stools. It is also a bit more expensive. I had the Shiromaru Hakata Classic, which came out to $14.15 (before tip). Most other ramen places are $10-$11. I would say the broth did taste more flavorful than other places I've tried. Portion size was standard. So, price is higher, but decor and taste was also slightly better.

Ohhh Ippudo... I would marry you if I could.... For months I've been hearing about this awesome ramen place but the wait was not something I would want to endure especially in heels but my friend who really wanted to try this place convinced me to go. ÊSo after school we went and it must have been in between 5:30-6:00 pm and only had to wait 5 minutes.. BOOYAH BITCHES~ (hehe sorry, i was so excited to miss out on the huge 2 hour wait time). First thing we noticed when we walked in... we knew we werent walking into some regular hole in the wall ramen restaurant. ÊThis is like fancy trendy looking place you want to take your date here cause it looks great. ÊThe random shouting from the employers which I'm not sure if its greetings or what not was kinda amusing for my friend, who felt like a movie star walking in lol. ÊTrust me he's weird. We started out with the steamed buns. ÊIt's delicious, but its so damn small lol! If it wasn't that expensive just for 2 I wouldnt mind the size but meh, it was like crack just eating it. Êi wanted more and more! ÊBut of course we werent here for the appetizers, we were here for ramen! I love anything spicy so I had to try Karaka Miso Ramen. ÊUsually I devour the noodles first (which btw it had a chewy kind of texture which is different compared to other ramen restaurants) but I devoured the broth first. ÊIt was so good, I didnt have to order extra noodles from the extra broth. ÊThe waiters were always helpful and brought us refills. ÊWatching if we needed anything, very nice and smiling. ÊMy friend had the Shoyu Ramen which despite his lack of chop stick skills, he went after that sucker like no tomorrow. The only downside of coming here that its very difficult to talk with your friends since its so LOUD, but it's not much of a bother since the whole eating experience was wonderful. ÊI can't wait to come back again and try the rest of the menu. While walking out we saw the massive line everyone kept saying. BWUAHAHAHAHAHA~ We missed the chaos. =] ÊCome here! NAO! Yes it's expensive for ramen, but I think it's worth it to shell out extra bucks for this awesome food and waiters.

First and foremost, I love, love, love ramen! ÊIt's so good and slurpee-licious. ÊEspecially when you eat it after a cold day of snowboarding! Anyway, this place would be a lot better if it wasn't so stingy. ÊThe broth and the ramen tastes good, but they're cheap on the meat. ÊFor the price and high rating they received, they should be a lot better. Ê For people who don't eat ramen often, or survived through college on instant noodles, you will be devouring down the ramen like you just got out of prison. ÊBut in all honesty, there are better and cheaper ramen places out there. ÊThey're mostly in the outskirts of Flushing, but they're much better and actually gives you pork that wasn't sliced with a deli slicer. With that said, it's still a nice place with decent food. ÊI probably won't be returning there anytime soon though.

I rode all the way downtown for this from East Harlem. Rode at least 3/4 of the way with a woman who also ended up at Ippudo. That seemed like an excellent sign to me. Pork buns delight. I don't even understand how these are as good as they are. Akamaru modern. Everything that could possibly have been said about this already has been said. Just get it, trust me, you'll love it. Go at 6pm. We only had to wait 20 minutes on a Tuesday night, and there are 2 for 1 drinks at the bar during that time! Giant mug of Sapporo (on tap!) for $6.

Ippudo, the inevitable long wait for your delectable servings of ramen was well worth it. We were told that the wait would be approximately an hour and ten minutes. My girlfriend and I went to a nearby bar for happy hour and arrived exactly around that time only to be told that we were next in line. Yes!!!! Our waitress was super sweet and friendly. We started with the Ippudo Teba Gyoza, which was delicious! We could not resist the concept of ground pork stuffed into a chicken wing. Holy fuck. I could eat a whole sunday bucket of them! We also got the Yamitsuki Goma Kyuri, off the suggestion of our cool ass mop topped waitress. She swore it was the perfect accompaniment to our ramen and she was dead on. Didn't think that Japanese cucumber with sesame oil sounded very appetizing but it was savory and refreshing. Once our Akamaru Modern ramen arrived, we were in beast mode. We added Nitamago (Seasoned salt boiled egg) and Kakuni (Braised pork belly) and we were not disappointed. However, half way through our meal, we realized that we were missing the pork loin chashu that comes with the soup. We immediately alerted our buoyant waitress who apologized and quickly came through with a bowl of this indispensable ingredient! 2011 and beyond, this will be our winter time haunt. Thank you Ippudo! PS: I inquired about the Philly Cheese Steak Roll. Our waitress told us that due to popular demand, they would bring it back onto their menu very soon (Fifth star rightfully earned!).

I hate to be one of the 2000+ reviews for Ippudo...but I just couldn't help myself. Hands down, the BEST Japanese ramen I've had! And their pork buns (http://www.yelp.com/userÉ)....... ooohhhmyyyygooooddddddd....to die for. I'd say its a bit pricey for ramen ($13 to $15, and extra toppings cost $2 to $4 extra), and its always jam-packed with a million people... but I can guarantee you won't leave disappointed. Yes, it really is THAT good. I ordered the Akamaru Modern (http://www.yelp.com/userÉ).....AMAZING. I finished my bowl in less than ten minutes.. And the restaurant itself is really nice, and service is great! Our waiter was super friendly, and he was nice enough to seat us before our whole party arrived. I'll definitely go back the next time I visit NYC.

I love Ippudo! ÊThey always have a wait and I was reluctant to try at first, but finally did for a friend's bday dinner treat. We grabbed beers at the bar (have Kirin and Sapporo on tap) at $6 bucks a piece. ÊChatted for the hour wait and between the people watching, good company, and vibe, the wait went by quickly. We were seated at a large communal table in the middle of the restaurant. ÊWe ordered a special appetizer and the Miso Ramen and Tori Ramen. I love that you have options to add either a poached egg or hard boiled egg on top. ÊThe best part is the "Kae-dama" that allows you to add an extra ball of noodles for only $2 bucks. Ê The only potential con I can mention is that the ramen is a bit pricey (it's only noodles afterall) and again, there are always LONG waits, but it's worth it and I still give 5 stars because the food and atmosphere are that good. Yum! ÊI"m a fan. ÊI'll be back.

Since there are so many good reviews for this ramen restaurant, I don't think that I should waste your time... ...but I will tell you that I am a fan of this restaurant because of 1. atmosphere; 2. interior design; 3. food (of course). I got the Akamaru Modern ramen for entree and Hirata Buns for appetizer. Hirata Buns are AMAZING, so I highly recommend that you get that for appetizer. Akamaru Modern was a bit too creamy for my taste, but I still enjoyed my ramen. I'll try the classic next time. As for dessert, my friends surprised me with a dessert for my birthday, Lady M Mille Crepe Cake. This was light and fluffy, so I also recommend this dish if you want dessert. Also, I like how all the waiters and wattresses say "Hello!" and "Goodbye!" That was fun.

When we first discovered Ippudo, my boyfriend and I were coming a few times a month! We stopped for a little bit (the soup is prettyy fatty seriously), and the last time we went, the pork buns just weren't as magical as they were before. Maybe it was just the ones we had, but its not the type of place you can eat at all the time (at least for me, even though I loveee noodles). HOWEVER...... The ramen is delicious and RICH (particularly the Modern, which is my favorite) and very flavorful. You WILL be downing a lot of water though. However, what really separates this ramen joint from the others is the pork buns. Not that I need to rave about them anymore (see every other review for the squealing), but those pieces of delicious fatty pork belly with the smidgen of lettuce and mayo in the pillowy white bun.. is worth the trip. And hey, if thats really all you came here for, you can always order it at the bar and save yourself the hour+ wait to get into the dining room. .

Removing some stars because I wasn't thrilled about my ramen but everything else was delicious! (the wait was a little long too - if only they took reservations) - Pork Buns: a MUST. So amazingly good. The bun is so so soft and the pork is so flavorful and fatty. - Japanese Cucumber: I'm not a huge cucumber fan, but my friend ordered this dish so I tried it and it was SOOO good. It had a vinegar-sesame sauce that was really great. - Karaka Miso Ramen: I asked our waitress what the best ramen was and she recommended this one. I thought the flavor of the broth was not very good - nothing special. My friend had the Akamaru Modern which was very flavorful and good!

This time around, the pork buns didn't seem as good as the first time i had it, but still... this place has really good ramen. I had the classic ramen and added "kakuni"?? I think that's how it's spelled. It's basically extra pork. The broth was great - not too salty, not too bland, just right. Lots of noodles, and lots of flavor. I couldn't really finish, so it's definitely very filling. I would definitely recommend going here especially on a cold, dreary day, but prepare to wait for a long time. It's ok, it's definitely worth it =).

Really enjoyed dinner here! ÊInterior is dark and earthy, with hewn wood table tops. ÊDon't be suprised if you are seated at a communal table for smaller parties. Their pork buns are the best I've had. ÊI truly enjoyed the contrasts in flavor and texture. ÊThe shisito peppers were also great as a starter. I got the Akamaru Modern ramen. ÊIt was very satisfying, and the broth was delicious. ÊI was slightly disappointed that there were only 2 slices of pork belly on top, so it's probably best to supplement with their suggestion of adding kakuni. ÊI also felt that the dish was lacking a little punch of contrasting flavor - after eating a whole bowl of this, my palate felt a little bored. My friend got the Karaka Kogashi Miso Ramen (I think), and I enjoyed this as well. ÊHis broth was a little oily, but it had huge depth of flavor, along with a nice spicy punch. Service was friendly and efficient, but don't expect to linger over dinner. ÊAfter they brought the bill and we paid, they gave us maybe 5 minutes and then asked us to leave, as the wait was long.

To be honest, I came into Ippudo with already low expectations. We were originally headed for Momofuku, but upon the suggestion of a friend who has lived in NY for a couple of years, we had a change of plans. For the ramen, I only give 3 stars. Desserts and pork buns: 4 stars. The ramen was well-portioned (though I still can't believe I paid $16 for a bowl of ramen) but the soup was extremely and almost unbearably salty. The serving of pork was...measly. My friends' soups had an overwhelming ginger flavor though they were allowed a slightly more significant portion of tonkatsu. The pork buns were divine...perfect amount of fattiness, marinade, and delightfully soft buns. As for dessert, we ordered the green tea creme brulee (macha brulee) and the marscapone cheese with ice cream. The creme brulee is the best I have had ANYWHERE. ÊNever have I experienced such a lovely crisp top sugar shell -- I could listen to the crack against my spoon over and over again and still be delighted every time. The green tea flavor is definitely present but not overwhelming by any means. Texture melts in your mouth without being overly rich. The marscapone cheese was also very light and a great pairing to the ice cream. All in all, I would come back again but I do believe it is just a tad overrated.

I'll keep this brief, I've lived in Manhattan for about two years now and have made it a personal goal to try and eat in as many different restaurants as long as I live in this great culinary wonderland....simply because we have the luxury of choice. So out of the 100+ restaurants I've dined at during my time in the city, only about 5 of those I've been back to more than once. I've been to Ippudo FOUR times, and while this may not seem groundbreaking by any means, consider the following: 1) No matter what time or day you go to Ippudo, you WILL have to wait AT LEAST an hour. And that's being optimistic. I've braved the wait four times when I could have easily gone elsewhere. Why, you may ask? Simply because the ramen is THE BEST and hits the spot like nothing else in Manhattan, esp on a cold wintery day. 2) I simply have a hard time going back to the same restaurant twice, more out of a moral discipline than anything else. This place has the allure of being low-key in ambiance, high in quality and great in value. A combination hard to find in NY. If you have time to kill and don't mind a wait, you will be rewarded. I've had almost all their ramens and they are all fantastic. The hirata pork buns should be illegal, they're THAT good.

I will start by stating, I was never one for Raman Noodles. ÊWhen Ramen Noodles come to mind, I think, one of two things, "3 for a dollar special at your local grocer" or "your average college student away at school". ÊThanks to Ippudo NY, that changed. I now know better, and understand why this popular dish in Japan is considered comfort food. I discovered Ippudo NY on "The best thing I ever ate" A Food Network show. ÊIt looked delicious, and I knew, I just had to try it. ÊI soon was told, that Ippudo NY, is rated the best Ramen Noodle, by Japan's critics themselves. ÊCrazy? I know! ÊSo I made the trek over there, and what I found, was a wait. ÊTurns out you need to get there really early, because the patrons come in full force. ÊYou could find yourself waiting in excess of an hour. ÊThat's a sure sign for good food. After being seated at a communal table, we were greeted with smiles and fantastic service. ÊYou were made to feel comfortable, from the moment you walked in, to the moment you walked out. ÊStellar performance by the staff. ÊThe place itself, is very much happening, catering to the more younger city crowd. ÊModern, chic, loud, and an overall great vibe. ÊGreat place to go with friends or on a date. Now comes the food. ÊIt truly was spectacular. A culinary feast that was both affordable and memorable. ÊWe started with their famous Pork Bun. ÊA slow cooked piece of pork, that was smokey, sweet, sticky, and wrapped in a light and airy bun. Light to the touch and equally light in your belly. Then came the fall off the bone braised ribs that just melted in your mouth. ÊSweet, sticky and not big enough of a portion. ÊFinally, the main attraction, the "Akamura Modern" ÊRamen Noodle dish. ÊA rich silky, buttery, sweet, nutty broth, packed with flavor combinations, that set off fireworks in your mouth. ÊYou'll find it garnished with pork, cabbage, and scallions that give the broth some added texture and flavor. Ippudo NY reputation proceeds itself, and now I know why.

ÊTo be completely honest though, I wasn't that impressed with their Akamaru modern ramen, the supposed famous one. ÊI felt the soup was pretty bland and I'm not a huge fan of thin noodles, but that's just my personal preference. Ê The pork buns I thought were delicious, although they did not follow the conventional pork bun ingredients. ÊThey used lettuce instead of scallions, and I don't think they used pork belly, but instead lean pork meat, which I liked but it wasn't like the traditional pork bun. Don't really see why people wait 2 hours for this place...I prefer Maru-Ichi's Kuro Ramen in Mountain View, tbh.

After a very unfortunate event involving a hangover, ramen, and milk my freshman year.... let's just say I'm not a huge ramen fan. I might have ramen once a year, twice if I'm (un)lucky... depends on how I look at the situation haha. That being said, Ippudo was pretty darn good. My boyfriend and I met up with one of his friends there on an early afternoon. The place was pretty much empty since they were closing down for lunch pretty soon so they could open up for dinner a few hours later... which meant faster food for us! Always a plus when you're hungry. I was told that this is apparently a chain in Japan and this is the only branch in the US. I think I remember getting the Akamaru Modern with a poached egg on top... which came in a GIANT bowl (boyfriend kept looking over enviously because what he ordered was way smaller plus not as delicious)! Mmm even though I can barely tolerate ramen more than once a year... this shiz was gooood. Not too overly salty and it actually had a range of flavors. I hate ramen that just tastes like salt and has me gulping down my water faster than an elephant at the watering hole. That being said, the dish was delicious and very filling. The pork was so juicy and tender! When my stomach allows it, I will definitely go back when a year has lapsed from my previous indulgence ;)

I love ramen and I really like this restaurant! We came in on a Thursday around 1PM. The atmosphere and decor of the place was really nice, and the food comes out pipping hot in the bowl. It stays hot even to your very last bite of noodles or your very last sip of soup. I got the miso ramen ($15) with a side of egg ($2). It's actually pretty pricey for ramen. I've had just as good ramen in Los Angeles (and they give you more pork meat with a side of egg) for $10, but this isn't Los Angeles it's New York City. Tea is given after your meal. Every time a group gets seated or ramen is being served to someone, the whole staff just starts shouting something in Japanese- or so you think it's Japanese. My friend speaks Japanese and it's just funny when she tells me that some of them are actually saying something in Japanese while others are just shouting something in gibberish. Haha... My friend had a bad experience with the service here when she came with a group of people on a Saturday. I'm glad she decided to give this place a 2nd try when I came to town.

Could ramen be THAT good? ÊWorth the wait of hours? ÊWith some questions and hesitations, we put our name down for two ~1PM on a Sunday afternoon and told that the expected wait time was ~1 hour. ÊWe came back with hungry stomachs, seated a little after our wait time, and left satisfied with our ippudo experience. Chasu pork bun: good and a great starter; personally not crazy about the mayo or iceberg lettuce, but it was still good. ÊWe'd originally wanted one chicken and one pork, but apparently it's a minimum required order of two. Akamaru Modern Ramen: absolutely loved the broth, which is a perfect combination of savory, hearty, and layered flavors without being greasy or salty. ÊAlso, this comes with honsu-men, which is not the typical curly ramen but a straight noodle version. Ê Spicy Miso Ramen: a very flavorful soup that combines the original tonkotsu and miso with kicks of ginger and spice. ÊMore hearty and "buttery" than the Akamaru broth, but it was enjoyed all the same. We slurpped down to the last drop!! The "experience" is heightened by the chorus of Japanese greeting by all the servers and chefs as you enter and exit. ÊThere are some communal tables and communal bars, so be willing to rub elbows and delight in the experience together. Take-Away: Personally did not come with high expectations but with hesitations about the premium and wait time. ÊWas not disappointed!

I gauged advice from friends (who I met on Yelp years back in 2006, and whose palates I've learned to trust over the years) on what I should do for my gustatory adventures when I took a random trip to New York on a random weekend to take a break from the monotony of Longwood Medical Area in Boston. ÊThat area sucks in terms of food options. ÊAlso, it has been days and months since I had any proper pork or meat products, especially since we just had a final on protein and fat metabolism. ÊI was craving for some quality swine. I got a couple of direct messages and tweets that contained the word "Ippudo". ÊOmid T specified--Get the Akamaru Modern with the Kikune (braised pork belly). ÊI jotted this down on my list of "TO EAT" and faithfully followed through. I lucked out that Sunday morning and was told that the wait was about 30 minutes. ÊWhen you enter the establishment, the outside is separated from the inside by this thick canvas curtain. ÊThe reception room is also a small bar area. ÊThe counter is made of some form of plexiglass atop those dry squares of ramen that we all know and love/hate from college/broke dayz. ÊThe back of the bar is adorned with different types of ramen bowls. ÊThe hallway leading up to the dining area is lined with mirrors. ÊAs soon as you pass that, you hear a clamoring from everyone welcoming you into the space! ÊIt really worked up my appetite even more. Since I was dining alone, I sat among lone diners on this fancy, picnic like table. ÊI ordered what I had on my notepad. ÊThe friendly stranger in front of me started chatting about what I am about to have. ÊHe mentioned how he frequents this place almost every week. ÊAhhh regulars---you know it's good when you got addicts like these fessing up to their vice. When I finally got my meal, I took my first spoonful of the richly complex but delicately balanced flavored Akamaru Modern ramen with the braised pork belly. ÊTHe belly was topped with what seems to be the sesame oil it was braised in. Oh my lord. ÊComfort and luxury in this bowl. I imagined this must be how it feels like to sleep on a tempur pedic mattress with a down comforter and thousand-thread count Egyptian cotton sheets, as your grandmama soothes you with her lullabyes. Ê This scrumptulescent bowl of bliss is a huge "EFF YOU" to what we just learned in medical school. Ê Fast-forward in the spring: an old roommate and her beau were visiting NYC. ÊI was in New Jersey for a baby shower and just headed over to the city to meet up with them. ÊThere were mad delays on the Metro due to construction, but I get to Ippudo before my friends do. ÊI put us down on the list, but the wait was going to be for 2 hours. ÊACK! ÊMy bus back to Boston was going to leave in 1.5hrs! ÊSo when my friends finally got there, I told them.... EFF IT, if they are down to wait 2 hours (since we all took all the darn trouble to meet up for the chance of having Ippudo ramen anyway)..... then i SHALL GET ON ANOTHER BUS! ÊWe all LOVED it.... we also had a really cool server who gave us tips on lipstick color blending. lol. random. ÊWe sat in a more chic area in the back. Ê When we left, everyone bid us an "ARIGATO GOZAIMASU" farewell! It sucks that I had to pay 3X the regular fare for the bus trip home.... but having the SPICY Akamaru Modern with Kikune this time was well worth the trip and the wait. =8)

Walked into the restaurant only to find out that they were no longer taking reservations. ÊThey did ask if we wanted them to call us if something opened up and so we left them a number. ÊWe went somewhere else and were waiting for a table, when Ippudo called us to tell us they had an opening if we could get there right away. We hurried back and were seated at a really big table that easily fit the 5 of us. We had the Akamaru Modern with an egg. ÊIt was DELICIOUS. The pork buns were also very delicious. Kinda pricy, but the food was super good. I would urge you all to go. ÊRun, don't walk!

If you can get past the long wait, then it should be worth it. The apps are good. ÊWifey and I had the Yamitsuki Goma Kyuri (simple cucumber sliced with sesame oil, chili flakes and salt), Tako Wasabi (raw baby octopus in a chopped wasabi paste), pork buns, and at that time a Philly Cheesesteak Egg Roll. ÊPork buns are pork buns, but the rest were awesome. ÊWifey especially loved the Philly egg roll. The ramen is good. ÊThe times we've been there, wifey's had the Miso ramen, the Karaka miso ramen and the Akamaru ramen. ÊI've had the Classic, Akamaru and a special Monkfish Shio ramen. ÊThe one time we brought our girls, they enjoyed the ramen, too. Ê However, there's a reason people keeping getting pulled into the ramen. ÊIt's called Ajinomoto. ÊYou taste it and you're drinking tons of water after because of it. ÊBut that's the way it is.

I heart Ippudo! I've been to A LOT of ramen places in NYC and this is the BEST! Although I would like to take a star off for the wait, all the other factors of the restaurant were perfect and I just can't find it in my heart to do that to my beloved Ippudo. Before I begin, I must add that I've been to Japan and of course, this does not compare to Japan and I don't think it's fair for reviewers to compare it to ramen country on the other side of the earth. Just my two cents. To start, my party and I had the pork buns, the chicken wings, and some special that, by now, I've completely forgotten what it is - except that it was bangin'. Pork buns were fatty and delicious. You can't go wrong with pork buns. Wings were my favorite as it was so flavorful, just the right amount of crispy on the outside yet amazingly tender on the inside - and it wasn't greasy! I could eat those everyday. I ordered the Akamaru ramen with bamboo shoots, poached egg, and the chili paste. Everything was perfect - the broth, the density and springiness of the noodles, the amount of toppings. My friends ordered the shoyu, the karaka, and the one with the curry flavor. I tried each one and I loved all of them but I would say that the classic caters to everyone's taste buds. The waiter was super friendly and accommodating and the decor was beautiful. The atmosphere was friendly and the food was godsend. I think that deserves a solid 5.

Yes, the Akamaru Ramen is a must try and Ippudo's ramen noodles and broths are amazing. But what the other reviews lack is that this place has issues with time management, the reason why this became a 4 star review rather than a 5 star one. Friday night at 8:30pm we walk in without reservations because this place doesn't take them. They tell us to come back at 9:30pm so we shop at Union Square. 2 out of 4 of us comes back at 9:20pm and the hostess won't seat us until the full party is back and the other 2 come back exactly at 9:30pm according to the time on our cell phones which are synced to the national clock. In fact they actually seated some other parties while we were told to wait and wait some more. The waiting area isn't that large and there's a small bar by the entrance to help kill some time. After 30 minutes the hostess found a 4 person table for us in the corner and that helped end the worst part of the night. Our waiter recommended the classic and the modern so everyone at our table got that and its taste definitely justify the rave reviews it has received. Although I've only tried those two menu items, I still prefer the ramen from its smaller competitor, Totto, hidden away in the theater district.

Finally got to try this place after hearing so much about it. Ê Overall, I really like this place. ÊThe ramen is very good with a very flavorful broth. ÊThe noodles kinda remind me of soba as they are thin but they are pretty tasty. ÊI wish they were a little chewier. ÊBut the broth is definitely a hit. The appetizers were very yummy as well. Ê I would have given more stars but the wait was just way too ridiculous. ÊI don't think I can fathom waiting 2 hours for a bowl of freaking ramen, no matter how good it is. ÊBest bet is to go early! Also, it is a bit pricey....

Sooo delish. I went tonight for the second time and it totally rocked, as I remembered from the last time. Even better was spotting Sarah Jessica Parker & Mathew Broderick waiting as we were leaving. So they even make celebs wait here?? I had the Ippudo Ramen Modern. I got this last time too, and as I remembered, delicious. The noodles were perfectly cooked, and the flavor is very rich and flavorful. I find that the broth is much more flavorful and richer here than any other ramen places. We also started with some pork buns (mmm) and some fancy crunchy peppers (not sure the name). Coming to Ippudo is quite the experience. Of course, there's the long wait, although if you come early it's not too bad. We only waited about 30-40 mins early on a Sunday night (~5pm). But, the bartender is very friendly and it's quite a people watching scene when you're standing in the small waiting area, cramped among a mixed, good looking crowd drinking sake and hanging out. Then, when you walk into the dining room the chefs all cheer/clap and you are just so glad you decided to wait. To top it off, the wait staff are all expecially upbeat and friendly here. If it wasn't for the lines, I would come back more often.

I like Ippudo, but I don't like the wait and the noise level. Just about anytime I've been there, the average wait time is about 1-2 hours. It is also very hard to carry a normal conversation without having to shout. The ramen is pretty good, but not as good as what ppl have raved about. I like how they have varieties of appetizers, seasonal dishes and desserts. In short, pretty good ramen, somewhat overpriced, and very small portion.

Ok, i know this place has like a MILLION reviews .. but I just couldn't NOT review this place! EVEN THOUGH i waited 1.5 hours for a seat on a sunday night at 8pm... it was still worth it. As we tweeted about our arrival to Ippudo (to make our friends back in sf jealous and drool, obviously) we entered the seating area with the yelling of many many waiters and waitresses saying hello and welcome to us in Japanese. I dont know why, but i liked that. It may not have been so fun after awhile as more and more people kept coming and more and more screaming ensued... but whatever. We ordered 2 starters - the Pork buns - OMG the pork belly in them was fuckin amazing. So well seasoned - slightly spicy but def. not overdone. The bun was so fluffy! My friends also ordered this tartare thing with avocado, tofu, and seaweed. It was interesting -- not really something I liked too much. As for the ramen... we tried the Akamaru modern (tonkotsu' soup noodle with Ippudo's special sauce, pork belly chashu, cabage, kikurage, scallions, miso paste & fragrant garlic oil) ÊEverything about it was so good. The broth. the pork so tender and well seasoned. the noodles. i.want.more.

im sure im not going to say anything new but i thought id jot this down anyways. Êwe waited an hour for ramen. Êthen our bill was close to one hundred dollars. Êall i gotta say is: Êoverhyped. Êoverrated!! dont get me wrong ive lived in hakata/kyushu where this tonkotsu/thin white ramen hails from. Êit is pretty darn close to the real deal. Êbut i hate waiting so long for food! Êand ramen is not supposed to be expensive! we put our name down and they said 1.5 hours. Êok so we hop on over to copper square hotel for drinks seeing as ippudo had no room for us to stand. Êwe call at the one hour mark and are told it will be another 1 to 2 hours! Êwhat?!??! Êso we stomp back in and tell them hello we are here. Êthey say 20-30 minutes. Êwow Êok that was weird. Êwe wait at the bar. Êi have a yuzu rock and bf had a beer. we were seated at the bar and we order a salad with tofu. Êthe waiter kept asking us if we had questions and we kept saying no we just wanted to order. Êseems like everyone in here can say the things from the menu in japanese. Êthey constantly yell to welcome newcomers as well as orders to create a kind of festive environment. Êi have the Akamaru Modern and bf has the tonkotsu wasabi. the soup is subtle yet rich, flavorful yet not overpowering the other ingredients. Êthe noodles are thin and aldente. Ê$2 for egg. Ê$4 for stewed pork. then $2 for three lumps of rice. Êomg kill me now ... Êthe lumps of cold white rice, they call ochazuke for putting in your broth after finishing the ramen. Ê the food is good but not the wait and the prices

I'm one of the fortunate ones who got in through a fluke of nature, because I had a week off and went in at a strange hour and day..I think 2 pm on a Tuesday. I was all ready to wait...wait...wait....but I just walked right in and got a seat. ÊThe lovely staff was friendly enough to accomodate a cold, shivering me. I had heard about this place for several years, and I am very much a ramen fan from instant noodles (haha, laugh) to Ippudo! I had the Akamaru Ramen. ÊThe broth itself was flavorful, with hints of the vegetables it came from. ÊIt aint your standard powdered broth. ÊThe pork? ÊJuicy and tender and worthy to be in the soup. You could taste the good quality of the stocks, which warmed my tummy to no end. I was considering giving up on ramen before this. ÊLong story short, everything felt the same to me, I was considering gorging myself as a meat-eater of burger and steaks. ÊBut after this, I can see why going on a "plant-based" meal plan is healthy and harmonious. ÊThe veggies really dominated this ramen, giving the veggies the spotlight. Harmony and feeling warm indoors, surrounded by a friendly staff of waitresses and cooks. ÊWhat more do you want?

I was on the fence about going here. But after much thought, we ended up going here over Minca just to see what all the bandwagoners were raving about. After we ordered a beer at the bar we were seating just a mere 10-15 minutes after we put our name in. We shared the hirata pork buns and they were good (frankly though I like Flying Pig Truck's version the best still- but then again this one's not pork belly). The better of the two appetizers was definitely the Agedashi Tofu Yasai Ankake which had an amazingly silky broth. For the ramen, I chose the Akamaru Modern with the egg. The broth once again was the highlight and you bet I sipped it all up.

No where in New York can you get a better bowl of ramen. Simply soul-satisfying. ÊI usually get the Shiromaru Classic. ÊHave gotten the Akamaru also, while delicious, can get a little too salty for me. Ê Other favorites: sliced cucumbers with sesame oil - simple and refreshing pork buns - definitely the best i've had grapefruit with sochu - amazed everytime i get it, how refreshing a grapefruit can make sochu Unfortunately, the only bad thing now is the wait time.

I lived in Japan and used to go to Ippudo at least once a week as I lived down the street from the Waseda location. ÊThey had an amazing lunch special for 700 yen (about $7) which included a bowl of ramen, a plate of gyouza (dumplings), and unlimited rice. ÊThere was also moyashi (bean sprouts) in a yummy slightly spicy sauce. ÊThe whole Ippudo experience was amazing in the cozy restaurants in Tokyo. The Ippudo location in New York is a sad contrast. ÊThe restaurant does not have the charm and coziness. ÊThe staff is rude, mean, and impersonal. ÊI was so excited to go to Ippudo in New York after eating there 50 times or so in Tokyo. ÊI had really, really missed my favorite ramen restaurant and I couldn't wait to have some akamaru ramen and gyouza. ÊWhat a disappointment. ÊFirst, there is no gyouza. ÊIppudo is famous for the gyouza. ÊIt's the best gyouza I had in all of Japan. ÊHow could they not have the most amazing gyouza?! Luckily, the ramen is the same. ÊToo bad the price is DOUBLE! ÊI can live with that though, as most imports do double the price. ÊSo, fine. But the service... it's just terrible. ÊIt is nothing compared to the nice and homey service in Tokyo. ÊI have had a worse and worse experience every time I went to Ippudo in New York, about 6 times total. ÊThe most recent time will be my last until I return to Tokyo. ÊI had some mochi with me and after I finished the yummy ramen, I wanted to eat a mochi to complete my experience. ÊOne of the waiters saw me eat the mochi and asked me to leave since no outside food is allowed in. ÊI was humiliated in a place that I considered so special, and well, I'm not going back.

Ippudo has the best ramen I've ever tasted in my life. Hands down! Thankfully we got there right when they opened (and on a weekday) so we were seated immediately! Within minutes the place was full with a line out the door! ÊI really enjoedy the fact that they seat different parties at the same table! Even though there could be 2 other parties next to you, it is still pretty intimate. I ordered the Karaka Men ramen set with the roast pork over rice. All I have to say is WOW! Especially to the roast pork over rice! The mayo was a great touch! Although the food was slightly on the expensive side (for ramen), it was definitely every penny! Also, if you go downstairs to where the bathrooms are at the right time you can see them making the noodles!

At first I was skeptical...but it was worth the hype. We arrived at 6pm on a rainy Saturday night- that didn't deter the crowd at all. We waited an hour to be seated. Let me tell you- this place is insanely crowded. There's a bar upfront so you can drink while you wait. (great $$ making concept to make extra dough while you make people wait ippudo!) On to the food We ordered the Shiromaru Hakata Classic and Akamaru Modern ramen. Both were amazing. The soup doesn't have that greasy tonkatsu aftertaste (you know what i'm talking about if you've tried many ramen places all over including Japan) and the noodle seemed like it was JUST made. Literally right before they made it! I'm still drooling when I think about it right now. -1 star for the ridiculous wait and the meat was a bit hard. I'd return next time when in NYC- but at 5pm or something!

For a series of restaurants on the fabled Manhattan island I know, I should expect high costs, but that sh*t I ain't buyin' No thanks to paying for over-priced food Despite the fact that it's really just that good Ippudo I'd say is one of those places The price of their ramen ($13-17/bowl) will put you through paces The broths were rich and the flavors were full But dude. ÊIt's a f*ckin' Japanese ramen bowl The worst thing o'er here was the famous pork bun Pork belly in a white casing and folded over for fun Thought that $2 each bun was already pretty overpriced So much to my chagrin, that sh*t was 4, I was ready to die In so much disbelief that I could spend 25 at this joint I'd suggest it to friends, but only after making a point To let them know that it's expensive, but probably worth a try -They have cool insta-noodle packs decorating the tables.... prices shouldn't make me want to die

This place is like no other. Great comfortable place always busy and easily the best Ramen I ever had. Fresh ingredients all the time. Can't wait to try them all in the very near future. For appetizer we had the pork buns and wanted to order more cause they were so incredible. The Japanese cucumber was not boring as I initially thought it would be. I will probably order this again. Its a cucumber mixed with a sesame oil dressing. ÊOrdered some cold sake at the bar before I was seated YUM!! Staff was A+ awesome and explained everything about everything that was served. It was about 1:30 pm and it was an hour wait. Totally worth it though. I can only imagine how busy this place is for dinner time.There's like a billion pictures here on Yelp so check them out and go here. You wont be disappointed at all.

our very first meal here in NYC came with a group of twenty so a long wait is inevitable. we had to split up into two groups and waited about an hour on a wed night as suggested by so many fellow yelpers, we got the pork belly buns appetizer. it was delicious! well flavored, very tender, and there wasn't too much fat. my only complaint would be that 2 for $9 is pretty steep... especially when its like 2 for $5 at chairman bao. but i guess its the start of a pricey food trip i had debated either to get the akamaru modern (which seemed like the most popular one) or the karaka miso ramen. i went with the karaka miso ramen because it already came with hot spices. i was really happy with my choice because one of my friends got the akamaru modern without adding anything and it was kind of bland. ive never been much of a ramen fan, but it was a really good meal. i wouldn't say it was worth the wait and i paid a lot more than i would have expected or hoped but nonetheless a good experience. the ramen lived up to its hype and i am now officially a ramen fan

I didn't even bat an eye when the hostess told me that there'd be a two hour wait for a table. This is the type of thing that I'm used to, silly me - always so insistent on trying the most buzzed-about spots. Thankfully, happy hour was in full swing - 2 for 1 beers for $6. My friend and I got the Saporros and proceeded to while away the hours. The clientele left much to be desired that evening. Behind us at the bar stood several loud d-bags straight off of work on Wall Street. I ordered one of their midori-infused cosmos in an effort to while away the last half hour. Finally we were seated. Um, can you say sensory overload? The ambiance inside stressed me out - too many mirrors, "irasshaimases" and people running around. For appetizers, we got the pork buns and blackened cod with miso. I liked the buns, but the cod was difficult to eat with the bone still in. In a taste test of the Akamaru Modern ramen vs. the classic ramen, Akamaru won, no question. The pork belly and special sauce made the classic taste really bland in comparison. After our meal, my friend still insisted that Momofuku makes a better ramen. Naturally my next stop for ramen will be Momofuku Noodle Bar, as it is the 2nd most buzzed-about ramen joint in the area.

Came here on a friday night 5 min before closing. ÊI was so surprised that they still seated us! luckily there was no wait at this point. Service: they let us in even though it was close to their closing time but the down side is that they were really hustling us ! The min we sat down they started their intro with " this would be your last call of the night" which doesn't sound very welcoming at all. ÊThey did gave us water and hot tea right away though. Food: We ordered their famous HIRATARA BUN ($8 for two pieces) this is basically a steamed bun that's filled with Pork- the texture of the meat is extremely soft and juicy! The bun is drilled with a special Ippudo sauce (soy sauce/Japnese BBQ sauce based sauce) so the bun isn't so dry. ÊThis dish is really good if you have never had this you should definitely try The 2nd dish we ordered was SHIROMARU CHASSHU RAMEN ($13-16)- The ramen has a pork flavored soup base and is topped with some bean sprout and extra pork loin chachu. I personally don't like the way they cook their pork loin chachu. ÊIt tasted a little tougher than it is suppose to be. ÊThe soup was not too salty nor oily like many other ramen. This ramen is also served with an egg and some green onions. ÊI wanted to add Corn as my topping but this item is not available in the store which is quiet disappointing. Ê My overall experience here was just Ok. My friend and I literally finished all of our food in about 20 min because the waiter was rushing us: constantly asking us if we need anything else or else they will clean the table. ÊI didn't like the service but the food was pretty good. ÊI would probably try a different ramen. This ramen wasn't the best ramen i have ever had! Not sure why people hyped it up so much... this place is more like a 3.5 STARS for me if that was an option

Ê i highly recommend the Akamaru Modern for first timers (and my waiter did too :) Êhe insisted that this was the most popular thing on the menu)..i've tried their classic too, which is also very good... but the Modern is still my favorite. Ê decorations here are quite nice... soft comfortable couches for big parties. Êthe servers are all super nice too. Ê i came here four times in my first year at New York. Êevery one who visited wanted me to take them here because of the yelp reviews. Êi definitely love this place, BUT it really isn't for everyone. Êhalf of the people i took here loved it just as much. the other half thought it was way overpriced. Êi can see why- a bowl of ramen for $15 excluding tax is pretty pricey. Ênot to mention that its really hard to fill up the stomach of an average guy (but you can add $2 to get more noodle). for me personally, i like quality over quantity and definitely think that anyone who visits NY should give this place a try.

So, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say.... "meh...." Don't know if it was the hype that got my expectations up and Ippudo just didn't seem to deliver or what but I'm just going to have to go with "It was okay." I think there are plenty of hyped up restaurants that are well deserved of the hype, but Ippudo isn't it...at least not for me. We got to Ippudo at around 11:50 on a Sunday morning and there was only about a 15 min wait. By the time we got out at 1:30 however, there was a crowd of people and we overheard the wait was up to an hour by then. I've had friends tell me that they've waited over 2 hours for Ippudo before, and that baffles me. My disclaimer though, is that I find myself drawn more to Sapporo style miso ramen or Tokyo style shoyu ramen with the curly yellow noodles over Hakata tonkotsu ramen with the thinner straight noodles. Yes, the broth of the tonkotsu ramen is good but I kind of find it a tad overwhelming. So if you're into tonkotsu style hakata ramen maybe this is the place for you. So let's break it down: We got seated and the waitress was very nice and energetic. We got our waters but then waited around for almost 15 minutes before the waitress came by again to take our orders. She was apologetic and the restaurant was busy, so it's understandable. Plus, gave us more time to look over the menu... not that you need it though because there are like 7 options for ramen... you have more trouble deciding among all the varieties of appetizers, in my opinion. I got the Shiromaru Hakata Classic... because I like the tried and true varieties. This was supposedly the "orginal" version of what started it all. It was good, decent amount of noodles, a half of a soft broiled egg, but my gripe with this ramen (and the other ramens we got at the table), was that it wasn't hot enough (not like spicy hot, but temperature wise, it wasn't hot enough). ÊMaybe it's just me, but when I eat ramen, I like the kind that's nice, hot, and steamy...the kind that would fog up your glasses if you wore glasses, ya know? We also had a Akamaru Modern, this was nice and different and had an interesting kick, with the garlic and hot oil...once again though...not hot enough. My other friend tried their special ramen which had monkfish liver pate mixed in...and this one I thought was pretty delicious and different from any ramen I've tried before. I'd come back for this ramen (but not if wait was more than 15 minutes). The pork belly buns got a big "MEHH" because I've had much, much better on the streets in Taiwan, land where pork belly buns originated so yeah. And the pork belly in the buns wasn't even fatty, either! It was lean pork as far as I could tell. They did seem to have lots of other options for appetizers though. Overall the three of us each had a bowl of ramen and split 1 order of pork belly buns and paid $22 each...definitely NOT cheap for ramen, even for Tokyo standards! So to wrap it up, Ippudo gets points for creativity in the monkfish liver pate ramen, friendly service, a really clean bathroom, and nice atmosphere. ÊTheir ramens need to be served HOT and overall taste was just okay...and the wait (if there is one) and price is not justified for me. All in all, I'd go somewhere else for ramen because I'm sure there exist places that are just as tasty, not as expensive... perhaps just not as well known and hyped up as Ippudo.

OMGGGG!!! Ramen never tasted so good!!! MMMMMMM!!! YUMMM!!! I probably could eat 2 bowls. The soup is so delicious with the perfect flavor. Downside, the place gets so busy! A friend suggested the best time to go there was at 3pm. Dinner is too crazy and the place is so small. Also, its pretty pricey. ÊBUT its so gooood. worth the wait.

This place is still busy, even just 15 minutes after opening at 11am on a Saturday morning. The staff is friendly, and the bar is neat and clean up front. Entering for seating, you're still greeted by the staff and others. Still, you notice that what was once mostly Japanese servers and cooks are now replaced by others - perhaps they've gone and founded their own places, or just the second crew works lunch? Seated at the counter, we were able to get a bird's eye view of the cooking, which is useful. Clean and impressive kitchen, I like that. The Akamaru Modern ramen was what I tried this time, with menma added. Nitamgao (seasoned soft-boiled egg) used to be served with this dish... no longer, it's a $2 side order. The ramen was al dente and definitely just right - cooked through without being overly soft. The broth surprised me - it wasn't nearly as rich or flavorful as before in my experience. Disappointingly, the pork was not as good, either - two small, thin pieces that definitely (when I compared with my photos from when this place opened) were both smaller, thinner, and the meat part didn't fall apart in my mouth =( How unfortunate. The only thing that saved this meal from becoming a two - the Pork Hirata Buns. A tasty, slightly spicy BBQ fatty pork slice between Peking Duck steamed buns with mayo and a piece of lettuce, this was refreshing and tasty still. The green iced tea was okay, but the oolong hot tea didn't quite taste right. I'll do take-out of the Hirata buns next time, and go get ramen somewhere else, I think, until others tell me it's gotten better.

Most. Overrated. Place. Ever. The ramen is fairly good, although for the wait, I'd say it would be wiser to go to one of the smaller places which serve equivalent, if not better, ramen. Be prepared for a long wait. ÊMaybe you should bring a board game to play with that special someone you're on a date with. Or perhaps you can bring along your senior thesis, and write about 20 pages of it while you're waiting to sit. ÊYou could literally go to K-Mart across the street, shop for an hour, then head over to St Mark's book store & read a copy of War & Peace, and then get dessert at St Alps (why is it not saint'S alp, I always wonder). ÊAnd you know what? Êyour table at ippudo still won't be ready. Might be best to slip the sometimes obnoxious matre'd there a Franklin and hope for immediate seating.

Had a wonderful lunch here with my ex-roomie and her parents. They told us the wait would be an hour but it didn't turn out to be that bad. What I really like about the place is the decor. The interior design is wonderful with the giant ramen bowl right above the front hostess area. We ordered the Hirata buns (really good, get these) and the Hirata wings (okay i suppose). I decided to try the Shiromaru Hakata Classic which had pork loin chashu, kikurage menma, half boiled egg, red pickled ginger, scallions, and sesame... Delicious!

The Good: Very good soup broth, quick service, great extras to the ramen The Bad: The wait, the price, the ramen doesnt blow me away. Lowdown: This place is Michelin rated. ÊIve been to a couple of those places and they blow me away. ÊThis place did not. To preface this, the best ramen ive ever had is in Tokyo so im a little biased on my review. ÊIts OK ramen. ÊIts definitly overpriced and not even my favorite type of ramen. ÊThe ramen here is thin and not filling. ÊDefinitly not something that blows me away by any means. ÊThe soup base was awesome though and i can drink that all day. ÊThe wait was insane even for 2pm on a Monday. ÊCome here if the wait isnt crazy and your not too hungry.

I went here about a year ago and I'm pretty sure my body is still trying to digest the pork. Ê Starts off fine, if you can stand the uber-hip vibe and long wait at the bar. The beer was cheap. As in it makes no sense for Manhattan cheap. Ah, the next round was double the price. Wuh ? Turns out it was half price happy hour when I first arrived. No notice from the bartender that if we order in the next five minutes we can get the deal before the price goes up. Thanks. Probably I wasn't cool enough to receive the message. But the pork buns ordered while hunkering down for the long table wait were excellent. Note the word pork. It will come back to haunt me. Table in some room straight back then left and then left again. So what to eat. Pork the waiter suggests. Some soup with pork in it. And add in some extra belly fat while you're at it. OK. And so it goes. I think I heard a pig screaming in the kitchen at one point during my meal. Dessert. What ? No pork Ice Cream. Disappointing. I kept it all down which was a triumph. Order with some more discretion than I and you may have a fonder memory. Me, I may never eat pork again. And if I do it won't be here.

YUMMMM 1.5 hr wait fo 3....5 mins for 1 person..or 2 hrs for 4. Just sign up and walk around st marks, or down to soho when waiting then re-enter this noodle heaven that is beautifully decorated and the staff super interactive. They pull out chairs for you, replace napkins, rush out orders! the pork buns are great BUTTTT mayo and spicy parts were a little off for me. Great but not japanese..they should have used their pork belly pieces they put in the #2 normal ramen which I had..the only thing that was missing was an egg from mine. The rest of the food was amazing too...there were booths that made me want to bring all of my friends here. sigh...heavenly. I wish i had room for dessert. Ramen was good, soup flavorful, the pork belly the best ive had..and everything was clean, yummy, and fast!

I waited 2 hours to get a seat at Ippudo on a Sunday and you know what? It was totally worth it. Everything was delicious, hot and right off the stove, and reasonably priced. I just wanted to eat everything. The pork buns, ribs, soups.. I could go on forever. I can't wait to go back. I will say that there are a couple of drawbacks besides the really long wait which is probably why no one can give this 5 stars. The hostesses are pretty rude which is annoying when you are waiting for so long and the place itself is pretty small which means it gets very hot inside. The open kitchen cooking at very high heat had me sweating uncomfortably and I couldn't help but think how horrible it must be to eat here in the summer. Try and stay away from sitting at the bar. A table will give you a much better experience.

Aside from all the other factors, they make really good ramen with rich broth, nice blending of flavors, and perfectly cooked noodles. It's proper and authentic. It's worth the wait, worth the travel, and affordable. Definitely one of my favorite Japanese restaurants in the city.

We went to Ippudo last Saturday night right after we landed in New York. ÊHaving been informed by the hostess that the wait would be 2 1/2 hours long, we left and came back on Monday at 5 pm (when the restaurant opens) and there was still a line already (albeit a much shorter one than Saturday). Well, the wait was quite worth it. ÊI started with the Shochu & Fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice. ÊHigh-quality shochu was served with half a grapefruit and a citrus squeezer: a fun touch of presentation for me since I always like the interactive element. ÊFor appetizer, we tried the Ika with Mozzarella cheese. ÊWhat a creative combination! ÊThe smoky flavor of the squid is a good compliment for the subtle mozzarella. ÊBut nothing can really compare to the pork buns; in the opinion of my friends and I, best pork buns of North America. ÊThe softly steamed buns melt in your mouth and the pork's sweetness lingers on your tongue. ÊAs I savored them, I was so content with the full range of flavors at my taste buds, tart & bitter from the Shochu with salty & sweet from the Pork Buns. The Shiromaru Hakata ramen was a steaming bowl of goodness. ÊIf noodles died and went to heaven, this was where they ended up. ÊPerfectly-cooked ramen intertwined with fresh pork and crunchy pickled ginger in hot garlic oil broth. ÊIn the frigid air of Manhattan's autumn, this was the culinary answer. Ippudo has received a lot of Yelp hype, and now I know why: they are taking over world, one thread of ramen at a time.

Visited on a Wednesday afternoon around 2pm and was seated immediately. This ramen and restaurant space can fix anything - a bad mood, a quarrel among lovers, and cloudy weather. Coming from Los Angeles where Japanese food/ramen has become as American as apple pie, we have our favorite spots to seek out a bowl of indulgent pork based broth at pretty much any hour of the day. However, being from California, gone to college in LA, and becoming a resident foodie I've become very aware of my fat intake and have always shy'ed away from drinking ramen broth.....I mean come on, leave a bowl at Santouka still for a minute too long and the broth begins to film over from all the excess fat.... ...until I came to Ippudo where I drowned myself in the broth, leaving nothing in my bowl except my utensils and the dish dash of spice that I couldn't slurp up with my tongue without losing any remaining self respect. Order anything and everything, it's all good. P.s. On your way to the bathroom there's a little window you can watch the ramen-master make the noodles (fresh!). Check it out!

The ramen here is good, no doubt about it. The pork buns I think are even better! The pork belly isn't as melt in your mouth like Momofuku's but it has a great kick and spice that Momofuku's lacks. (But add a lil rooster shiracha sauce and I think Momofuku's buns will take Ippudo's down any day!) My only issue with Ippudo is that it's ramen!!!! Êit shouldn't bust a hole in your wallet! Oh and if you're not there early or real late, forget about getting a seat!

I like my ramen simple: HOT soup, noodles with a tad bite to it, and a tea egg where the yolk is cooked just enough to still melt when cut into. ÊThe best IMO is Daikokuya in LA (not just because I'm from there). This place has a nice, kind of romantic ambiance. ÊThere are a selection of soup bases to choose from, but we opted for the original one. ÊMy friend got this spicy one, I don't remember the name, but it was way too oily for my taste. Overall, it was good, but NOT 2 hour wait good and not better than Daikokuya. ÊI wouldn't recommend this place for the ramen, but I would recommend it as a cool place to have dinner with friends and try the other dishes they have. *Sigh of relief* I don't have to fly back to NY to get ramen. ÊSaved $400 plane ticket back to NYC! Daikokuya still ranks supreme!

ÊYou can walk around, shop, or drop by other eateries while you wait. The broth for the Akamaru Modern was excellent. ÊIt was so flavorful and rich.

This place definitely lives up to its hype. There are only two Ippudo locations: Tokyo and NYC. I've been here at least 5 times. My advice is to go as early as possible (opens for dinner at 5pm) before the dinner crowd (NYU students+hipsters) hits around 630-7pm, otherwise you're looking at least an hour+ wait. If you do want to endure the wait, least they have drink specials at the bar so you can enjoy some Sapporo on draft. But, recommended dishes to get is the Pork Buns for an appetizer, worth trying out, but overpriced in my opinion ($8 for 2 pieces). For an main dish, definitely get the Akamaru Modern ($17) with Kakuni ($2) (pork belly) and the poached egg ($2). You can never go wrong. Plus you can get a refill of noodles (assuming you didnt drink all of the soup) for $2. Overall, its decent priced for eating in the city $20-25 a person, although some might disagree thats a lot for ramen. Personally, I like this a lot better than Momofuku Noodle Bar. I would nominate this the best ramen in nyc.

Well, first impressions weren't the greatest.. We arrived there around 2:45p to find they had closed early and they didn't have the best way of keeping people out.. I mean, I know the 'closed' sign was there but there were tons of people waiting in the lobby and I don't know, just as a first time guest, kind of confusing. We decided to keep trying to go so at 4:30p we lined up for the 5pm opening.. Line was around the block by 5pm! Upon going in, it was a great experience, loud individual greetings, great decor. Even though you sit with multiple people at one table, you still feel the exclusivity of your party. The waiters were great, there were tons of them waiting hand and foot, my water glass was never empty. The chairs though, seemed to feel the traffic, as they didn't feel as sturdy as it once was probably. As far as the food goes.. Since I'm vegetarian/pescetarian there wasn't really much for me on the menu since ramen is pork broth, but since we mentioned it to the waiter, he told me of a vegetarian option not on the menu. I thought this sounded really great.. And tasted great too! Overall, this place was good, and if I'm ever in the city and feel like ramen, this would be the place I'd go. On the other side, I would have to say, if you're ever in LA, it's better there for less (in terms of the food) but the decor/service here is definitely one of a kind.

I've been to Ippudo upwards of 8 times now, and sadly every time I go back, I am less and less impressed by this place. The decor and layout is great, and for a place that essentially serves a fancy version of what I ate every day during freshman year of college, its pretty damn good. But in a city like this, there are so many other places you can go without having to wait 2 hours for a table for ramen of equal or greater quality. The only thing here that's worth that wait - the pork buns. Scratch the ramen, get yourself two orders of the pork buns (it comes with 2 pieces), and your 2-hour wait will have been worth it!

This trip to NYC, I had ramen at Ippudo, Minca, Momofuku Noodle Bar, Sapporo, and Totto. ÊIppudo is the clear standout. ÊNone of the others come close. This is the first time ever that I finished all the noodles and contemplating whether or not to order extra noodles. ÊI had the Karaka Men ramen and Yamitsuki Goma Kyuri Ê(cucumber appetizer). ÊThe cucumber was very good, but too salty. Unless you have a large party; most likely you'll have to share a table. Just go early or late during the week to avoid the long wait.

I came to Ippudo for 2 things: pork buns and ramen. The pork buns were dankkk! The bun was warm and fluffy, filled with a thick slice of chewy pork belly. The sauce was a balanced mix of sweet and salty. It was melt in your mouth yum. The ramen was just as dank. I had the Shiromaru Hakata Classic and it was incredibly satisfying. The broth was piping hot and rich with flavor. The pork meat was tender, not too lean or fatty. And the noodles were the AMAZING. They were thin, chewy, and cooked perfectly. A bit pricey considering the simplicity of the dishes, but I think justified by the quality and deliciousness. P.S. They don't have take home boxes.

I left my heart in New York City, or more specifically Ippudo.. I love this place. We went on a Monday night, 45 minute wait, which the owner said we got pretty lucky. It's a dark little spot, right when you walk in, while waiting you can grab a drink at the bar and some appetizers. When my name was called, i walked down to our table and was greeted with overly excited employees in Japanese, I had no clue what they were saying but it made me feel like a celebrity. This place was super fancy, from their seats, their tables down to their plates. We sat at this fireplace area, it was real nice. But it was a casual restaurant. We ordered the Akamaru Modern Ramen, but it was delicious. It wasn't salty like most places I tried. We even got to meet the noodle maker. He makes the noodles downstairs, FRESH! But ramen aside, I LOVE their bbq pork bun, i was expecting the chinatown pork bun for a buck, NO, this is some supreme shit. It's those white pork buns you get at weddings with the peking ducks but with suculent soft and moist bbq pork. It was so good we ordered another order for desert. We got the Avocado & Tofu Tartar, it tasted really healthy. i didn't like it, but my friend did. I did feel refreshed eating it though, very different taste. Being this is my first NY trip and for them to bump Biggie & Junior Mafia, it made me feel soooo nicee(borat voice)I love this place! We will meet again ippudo. BTW, you can buy an I love Ramen shirt!

It's my first time to the big apple and I pretty much had a field day! ÊWhat day would be complete without trying one of New York's awesome restaurants. I mean with just under 2000 reviews it can't be that bad right? Let me start with getting there... ÊI got there at around 11pm and it was PACKED. We were told it would be 30-45 minutes for a table if two. I didn't really mind cause I already expected it from reading the reviews. I ordered what everyone raved about; the pork buns and the modern ramen. My girlfriend had the classic. I agree, the pork buns are amazing. Basically it's a slice of pork belly with some spicy sweet sauce and some lettuce. In my opinion they should forgo the lettuce and replace it with some other Asian green or sprout. The bun was really soft and reminded me of a "lai wong bow" (sunny milk bun?). Definitely try this; pork belly all the way. The ramen, which I guess is their claim to fame, is actually not very good. Sorry to say but I have had ramen a million times better. And to add salt to the wound, it costs 14 USD for a bowl of it! ÊDid I mention that the total count of toppings in the bowl was maybe 2-3 slices of pork? ÊWTF? ÊI've been to places where it's about 5 CAD and it's loaded to the brim, plus the noodles were better. I do have to admit that their tonkansu broth was quite flavorful and good. ÊAnd they did have a cool open concept kitchen where you watched a guy make ramen as if his life depended on it. In my opinion Ippudo NY is way overrated. It's expensive and line ups are long. And for what? ÊMediocre ramen with amazing pork buns. Maybe they should have a pork bun stand? Ps where can I get a "I love ramen" shirt? Those were awesome.

Yep hands down the best Ramen. I just had to include my two cents worth despite the 1000's of reviews already....they know how to do pork - and I don't usually eat pork!. Thier pork buns are divine and the special ramen at the moment is a rich, bursting-with-flavour chicken and port broth that has me craving it! The salty, umami flavours pair well with the fruitier chilled sake. Mmmmmmm Be warned, once you start you can't stop eating (and the bowls are huge!) Well worth the wait...just line up early, even 4.30 is not too early to ensure a 5pm seating.

Will you please stop yelling!?! I don't even know what you're saying!! Ahhh ramen - Every proper Asian loves their noodle and this little person is no different. I guess I came on a good day since there was no wait. I loved the atmosphere and seeing a bunch of Caucasian New Yorkers yelling in Japanese was very amusing...for the first 5 minutes. Then with every order there was more yelling. The restaurant was full, so the yelling never stopped. I wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry - midway through my conversations I'd forget what I was saying because I'd look up to see who was yelling, lol. It added to the atmosphere though. One can't be upset for that. I had ordered the Tori noodles, which were amazing. The broth was light but had the most flavor I had ever had in a broth. For $2 you can add more noodles, but as the menu warns you, you need to make sure you saved enough broth for it. Steller deal. For desert, we had a tofu custard topped with a choice of sorbet. I was hesitant over ordering the tofu custard, but am glad I did. It had a very strong and rich custard flavor, but without the heaviness in the texture. It was amazing and I would highly recommend it to anyone. Asian stamp of approval.

Every now and then, I have a dining experience that changes my outlook on the things I put into my mouth. I came here first about a year ago for dinner with my coworkers, had no idea what real ramen was and I fear I was spoiled with the awesomeness of Ippudo for all other ramen experiences! I had the veggie ramen and it was just amazing. Such a huge bowl that I could only finish half. Sake was delicious too! Pricey, but worth it. We had a big group - about 12 of us, yet we only had to wait 20 minutes after our final guest arrived. As other people turned up throughout the meal, they were fine with letting them join us in one of the huge side table booths. It's dark and loud in the restaurant, which is very fun for being with a group of friends. I came back another night with 2 people for a work-oriented dinner meeting and had a little trouble focusing on our conversation above the staff yelling at everyone who entered. Again though, seemed like a very short wait to be seated in comparison to what I had heard to expect. The bar at the front with bowls on the wall and dried noodles in the counter is very cute. Also, I'm a sucker for places with nice bathrooms and I really like them here. I love you, Ippudo. I think about you all the time.

When I ate meat, the ramen here made me very happy and full. I've never had such a delicious bowl of ramen. Tastes classy, tastes rich, tastes well thought out. It's the real deal. I hate having mediocre meals in New York--that happens more than I'd like it to--and it makes me very upset and disappointed. That doesn't happen here. It happens at places like Veselka and Mud. If I could eat meat (it makes me feel ill these days), I'd be rolling through Ippudo, downing their pork based, wholesome broth.

Apps: Started out with the Shishito...Which were deep-fried Japanese peppers with yuzu salt...These were really tasty and light...The salt had a nice tartness to it from the yuzu... Next were the Samurai Ribs...Pork spare ribs, seasoned with soy based 'tare' sauce served with seven-spice chili pepper...These were BANGIN!!! Crispy exterior, tender meat...WONDERFUL flavor...The only downside was the price...10 bucks for 3 spare ribs...I hate when there is an odd number for 2 people...Oh well...I could have eaten 20 of these suckers easily... Finished off with the Hirata Buns...Steamed buns filled with your choice of pork or chicken, served with Ippudo original spicy buns sauce..We got the pork...Oh boy...These were really good...So much flavor...The pork was so rich and succulent...Salty deliciousnessss...They looked like little cartoon charectars you could scarf down...8 bucks for 2 of them... Mains: I got the Shiromaru Hakata Classic...'The original tonkotsu' soup noodle with pork loin chashu, kikurage, menma, 1/2 boiled egg, red pickled ginger, sesame & scallions...I added the leaf mustard and braised pork belly to it...Very tasty broth and good textured noodles...The mustard leaf added a nice bitter note to the dish...The pork belly was tender... My guest had Akamaru Modern...'The original tonkotsu' soup noodle with Ippudo's special sauce, pork belly chashu, cabbage, kikurage, scallions, miso paste & fragrant garlic oil...I actually liked this one better...Was alot richer and had more of the flavor i was looking for...Plus the poached egg she added gave it a whole other dimension to it...Highly recommend!!! We both ordered Kae-dama..Which is another bundle of noodles for an additional 2 bucks...if you do this make sure you dont lap up all of your broth!... All in all we had a wonderful time at Ippudo...We showed up at 5:15 and there was a line out the door already...We were quoted at 40 minutes but got sat 15 minutes later! Fun decor and great service! look forward to coming back soon!!!!

Complete deliciousness. I tried the daily special ($13) which was Ramen with a thai peanut sauce flavor added to the broth. I can't get over how complex the broth was; such an awesome mix of flavors - sweet, spicy, savoury...ooooo The noodles were good and the pork was super tender. More please. We didn't have a problem with the wait as we arrived at opening time. We were a party of 6 and I really loved our "booth", the set up was great. Would highly recommend for a larger group, if you can get a table.

this place was okay. I am a sf native and definitely ippudo's noodles are not that great in the united states, but definitely i would say that they are good for new york city. I waited for about an hour, and during that time i looked around st. marks. I also got the pork buns which were delicious, I liked the bar and the vibe too. I think this place is a little too hyped up.

Often cited as one of the best ramen places in the US, Ippudo was on my must try list when I visited NYC. ÊWith solid California ramen places like Santa, Santouka, Orenchi, and more, I felt like I could see what the hype was all about. Luckily, Ippudo was a mere 3 blocks from our great hotel in Union Square and we came at 11:00 am, before the work crowds started congregating. The interior is absolutely lovely. ÊGreat ambiance, fun dual chairs, and lovely walls, decor, and style. ÊThe servers and staff greet you enthusiastically when you enter and I'm sure it's even a more fun place at night. For our orders, we decidd to try one ramen order of their famous Akahara Modern and one of the Shirohaturu Classic. ÊFirst thing to note is that this ramen is pricey. ÊAt $13 a bowl, this isn't gonna be a cheap lunch or dinner like ramen should be. Classic - a very traditional preparation with two slices of lean pork and a slight ginger flavor to the tonkotsu broth. ÊThe lean pork was slightly overdone and I found the broth a bit underwhelming. ÊThe noodles were standard fare and overall I was disappointed by this version. Modern - the modern adds a dollop of spicy chili sauce, a slice of fatty pork instead of lean pork, and a richer, fattier broth. ÊI definitely liked the spicier, richer broth better, but wouldn't say it was the best I've had. ÊNoodles were the same as the classic and overall, it was very good, but not fantastic. Ê Spicy cod roe over rice - I actually ordered a combo and had some spicy cod roe mixed with mayonnaise and placed over rice. ÊDidn't realy like the mayonnaise and felt the spicy cod roe was forgettable. ÊSantouka has a much better ikura rice preparation. Ippudo is a gorgeous restaurant with nice crowds and a solid bowl of ramen, but I was unimpressed with the actual broth and the prices. ÊWhile I think the Modern is worthwhile to try, I wouldn't go out of your way to wait or try it. ÊIt probably cracks my top 5 ramen places (Santouka, Santa, Daikokuya, and Orenchi are better) but I expected a whole lot more. Ê Ippudo accepts credit cards, including American Express.

Purely on taste and food, this place should get 4 stars However, reviews are all relative and this is certainly not a place that deserves the amount of hype that I have seen it get Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed my over priced bowl of ramen when I came here but I have had as good or better in SF The wait, the attitude, the over priced menu make this place just so hilarious and living proof of what viral enthusiasm can have on a business

Being from San Francisco, CA, I have been spoiled by some really good food. I have also been blessed with Japanese friends who are chefs from Japan. I had heard a great deal about Ippudo before visiting NY. And to be honest, I wasn't all that impressed. BUT I definitely like Ippudo over Momofuku. Hands down. The ramen is good but I've had better. (Orenchi in San Jose, Kahoo is a close second) But I will say, the noodles were cooked well and the broth was good but not great. I did, however, really enjoyed the pork buns here. Sinfully delicious. I think this place definitely warrants at least a visit. The service was really friendly and attentive. We got lucky and only waited about 15 min for lunch. And the food is decent.

Perspective from a San Franciscan: I came here at 10 PM on Valentine's day with a few friends after dinner, already full from sushi and boba, but I HAD to try the ramen, so I ordered the classic. Definitely the priciest bowl of ramen I've ever had at $14 a bowl, but also one of the best I've had thus far (decidedly better than this nasty maruchan cup I am eating lol). That being said, I wasn't blown away or anything. The tonkotsu broth was really really good - rich, meaty, and not too salty, but I personally prefer a thicker, more al dente noodle, even though my friend says that thinner noodles are more authentic. I also wasn't thrilled or anything about the toppings. Overall, I'd still say Ippudo's ramen rivals most of the ramen I've had in the bay area (so I've tried Katana-ya, Halu, Santa, Ryowa, and Maruichi; Orenchi pending), but honestly, is it necessary for them to charge almost twice as much? We also ordered pork buns. Too fatty for me :( Bottom line: not fall off your chair amazing, and overpriced, but four stars for trendy decor and solid food.

Ippudo still hasn't quite won me over. For me, the joy of ramen consumption requires concentration and relative quietude, two elements unavailable amidst Ippudo's loud and trendy atmosphere. For a warmer and more quaint atmosphere, (slightly) superior ramen, and FAR SHORTER LINES, I commend to you Minca (see http://www.yelp.com/biz/É) -- still my favorite ramen joint in NYC. Even so, Ippudo's ramen is unmistakably delicious. Though my first impression of Ippudo's "classic" tonkatsu ramen (Shiromaru Hakata Classic) was that it was salty and greasy, though tasty. Upon my second tasting I found it less salty and greasy than a remembered; the broth featured deep and complex flavor and I enjoyed the thin and springy ramen noodles. The sliced pork loin, though tasty, bordered on overcooked and dry. I also enjoyed the tasty and spicy version of the tonkatsu ramen (Karaka Men Ramen), but found the broth a bit too salty (due to the special spicy sauce) and greasy (due to the sliced pork belly). I wouldn't wait 2 hours for Ippudo's ramen, but ramen lovers should visit Ippudo at least once. Ippudo's decor expresses an appreciation for ramen cuisine, as evidenced by the myriad of ramen bowls and ramen noodle bricks adorning the bar area. I also appreciate the "Zuzutto" booklet available at the register, which explains the short narrative about the origins ramen and how to eat ramen.

It's good ramen, but really good ramen should not require reservations or a 2 hour wait. Granted, the two hour wait gave me time to subway back to Brooklyn in order to fetch my car, but that's just silly. That nonsense aside, quite good, fine service, and I don't remember the ambiance since it was late, and I was too hungry to notice. I would go back, but this time I'll plan on reserving or showing up at 10:30pm.

I just don't get the fascination with ramen. ÊIf you're referring to the stuff beyond the noodles, fine. ÊIppudo is all right, the wait is way too long and the price is high for pretty salty food. ÊThe pork buns were way too greasy. ÊNot all it's hyped up to be, really.

Okay, so apparently they don't take reservations--but it doesn't matter, this restaurant rocks my socks and everything else!! The wait time is mind-bendingly unbelievable, but I guess I can't blame them since it was weekend. Go figure. :/ To not bore anyone further, I'll get straight to the point: the noodles are absolutely thick and tasty, just the way I like it; the broth is thick, rich and SO SO flavorful. Not much meat or noodles but you can always add more stuff. It's worth it, or just get two bowls, and try different things. Okay, I'm literally salivating at this point! I can't wait to go back to New York and of course, eat at Ippudo! Go there at once, don't let the lines deter you from excellent stuff!

I'm not really the biggest ramen fan because I usually get tired of eating the same thing in every bite of my meal and can never finish it, but I have to say that Ippudo is pretty damn good. Dropped by on a Friday night around 6pm, put down our name, and was told the wait was an hour and a half. Not a problem since I live nearby anyways, but it's not an ideal situation when it's cold if you don't live near by. I really don't understand why they don't just take reservations by phone- it doesn't make sense to have people come in to put down their names and then have the restaurant be awkwardly crowded while people wait. Also, I noticed once we were seated (exactly on time, which was awesome), that there were empty spots that stayed open for a while. The place was busy, but not SO busy in the back to justify the crowd in the front. Anyways that was the only negative for me- I loved the food, service, and ambiance. I had the pork buns, and thought they were amazing- the buns were perfectly plump, the pork belly was perfectly cooked with an awesome marinade, and mayo..never hurt anything in my book :) I also had the Spicy Karaka Ramen, which had this peppery/spicy red broth that was rich with a little bit of kick to it. It also had pork belly which was super fatty and the egg in it was just the right amount of cooked- where the yolk is just under being fully solid I finished the whole meal, which is saying a lot for me when it comes to ramen, and I can't wait to go back.

YES, I finally came here after numerous friends and family spoke to me of this restaurant's greatness... And coming from a mixed asian background, I think I would know my ramens and BAOs... so of course, I was a little skeptical at first.. It didn't help that we couldn't make reservations and the wait time was around 1 hr 15 min at lunch time...so naturally, I was confused as to what made this place so EPIC... but I thought I'd sit down and give it the benefit of the doubt... Me and my bro ended up dropping over $100 for lunch just on the food...which is rare because we're cheap asians with an income even lower than our height Ê^^ Hot menu items were: PORK bao buns, wasabi octopus, akamaru modern, sticky ribs, shrimp tempura, and by one of my esteemed friend's recommendations, the green tea ice cream with marscapone, which was god-like They have this nifty trick where you can refill your ramen bowl with an extra serving if you have sufficient broth left... WIN :D All in all, well worth the wait and the money dished out... plus our waiter was sexy... but thats just cuz we got the asian fever ^^ 5/5 -Av

I'm going to add to the 1800+ reviews and say that Ippudo is an absolute jewel. ÊWe always come here when we feel like celebrating something. The wait is always long (45 - 60 minutes), so don't come expecting a quick seat. ÊYou can pacify yourself with small dishes at the bar, which include the heavenly pork buns.

Like many other ramen fiends in NYC, I had been eagerly anticipating the opening of Ippudo for some time. ÊAfter reading all the glowing reviews that quickly came in, the anticipation was reaching a crescendo, yet something was holding me back from making the special trip there. ÊI suppose I feared that the reviews were overrated and Ippudo would be overhyped, like Ramen Setegaya and Momofuku were for me. Alas, I can happily say that Ippudo lived up to its hype and deserves all the high praise it's been receiving from ramen aficionados. ÊGoing at lunchtime is a great way to avoid waiting on the 45min. - 1.5 hr lines that I've been hearing about. ÊI came in after 3pm and was quickly seated at a nearly empty communal round table, which gave me a front row glimpse into the kitchen. ÊThe bamboo "tree" that "shaded" me was a nice touch and reminded me of a bamboo sculpture I had seen at the NY Botanical Garden last fall. ÊThe raised hiragana on the walls was also really cool, although I'm incredibly rusty with my Japanese and couldn't make any sense of it. But you're not really coming to Ippudo for the decor or ambiance, are you? ÊHonestly, if Ippudo was another hole-in-the-wall ramen joint like many others in the city, you'd still be happy to slurp up every last drop of your soup. ÊBecause, damn is that broth fantastic. ÊIt's so rich and thick with flavor - I believe it when they say that they simmer their pork bones for 14+ hours. Ê I had the Akamaru ramen, which came with extra special sauce. ÊThe pork slices melted in my mouth, and there were bits of ground pork canoodling with my noodles. ÊThere was only one drop of soup left in my bowl by the time I was done, and that's only because I was too embarrassed to lift the bowl to my mouth. ÊI usually don't bother finishing the soup when I eat ramen because I'm too full, but there is such a nice balance of pork, noodle and broth that you don't feel like a glutton lapping it all up. ÊBest of all, I didn't even feel bloated afterwards, just satisfied. Aside from the amazing ramen, the overall experience at Ippudo is very pleasant. ÊThe service is typically Japanese - prompt, courteous and efficient. ÊThey also serve complimentary tea at the end of your meal. ÊWhen I was finishing my first cup and they thought that I was lingering, they brought me another one, which was unexpected but appreciated. ÊIppudo definitely tops my ramen list and the wait was well worth it. Ê And when you think about it, $13 is a small price to pay for a genuinely delicious taste of Japan. P.S. ÊAdd the braised pork belly to your ramen for $3 - it's melt in your mouth yummy!

I've never had ramen not out of a package before so when people started telling me about this place, I couldn't quite fathom why people would pay so much for ramen. I associate the food with college kid budgets and sodium induced highs. However after last night's visit, my life is changed. They probably shouldn't call it ramen because it doesn't really deserve the negative connotation. The wait can be brutal but that's understandable. The ambiance is beautiful. There is a small bar as soon as you walk in with a wall full of unique ramen bowls (must be a bitch to dust and keep clean!) The hostess is adorable. To keep her waitees straight, she draws little pictures of what each person is wearing. My friend and I were known as green coat and black coat (full-on trench/peacoat pictures in effect). The restaurant is a lot larger than I thought. There are beautiful private booths (probably would be great for big dinner parties) and long wooden tables made for family-style eating. There are stark white walls with pop out Japanese characters and an open kitchen so you can witness all their noodle-making chaos. Don't expect a terribly expansive menu- they're really known for their broth ramens. There are five different kinds. Classic, Modern, a Spicy Classic, Miso, and Soy. I was told the Modern was the most savory so I decided to go for that. I opted to add in a flavored hard-boiled egg. It was everything I expected it to be. The broth was so incredibly flavorful- it was a blend of creamy pork flavors infused with a wonderful garlic aroma (don't worry, the garlic is subtle so you can still kiss your heart out later on, ha ;) ) The noodles are al dente and fresh. They are a little reminiscent of somen noodles but without the mushiness. There are three pieces of tender pork meat, cooked so well that the fat was nothing but an explosion of juiciness that dissolves automatically on the tongue (and I despite fat!). Might be worth it to spring for an extra side order of it. The broth, in all its deliciousness was ultimately too salty for me to finish but is really worth every single slurp. I definitely woke up this morning with an intense craving that is foreign to my carb-conscious self.

4.5 stars If I lived in NYC, I would frequent this place so much, not only would they know me by name, they'd probably think I work here. What keeps the crowd coming back to Ippudo? Umami. The reasoning behind this special "taste" isn't new to us. In fact it has been around for decades. ÊOur taste buds have been conditioned to recognize sweet, salty, sour and bitter. The fifth taste, Umami, is what keeps you addicted. It's an enhanced flavor. The extra oomph. The it factor. (yes, they use MSG) Pair that with a lively greeting when you walk in the door and a classy Êambiance in a roomy Japanese spot, well, you've got yourself a winner. The service is very attentive too, but we're really here to talk about the ramen, right? The Tori ramen ($13) -- small serving but this ramen is stupendous, especially for clear broth lovers like me. You get salt flavored ramen noodle in a chicken/tonkatsu broth, pork slices, 1/2 of a hard boiled egg, menma, naruto, shiso and scallions. ÊI was completely and utterly satisfied with my ramen. The bf had the Akamaru modern ($16) -- it had original tonkatsu noodles, miso paste, garlic oil, pork slices, cabbage, onions, kikurage and scallions. I liked his noodles better than mine, it was slightly thicker and more chewy. A lot of yelpers raved about the Hirata buns ($8 for two) which are steamed and filled with sliced chicken in a spicy sauce. ÊThey were good but not extraordinary. We arrived at 3pm so the wait was only 10 mins. We sat in a large communal table which was cool because I had a direct view of the kitchen. (psst...the food preparers wear gloves) Ippudo, you've earned quite a following as proven by your 1100 reviews and needless to say, you've got my vote too. * Thanks Jason C for showing me the way to ramen heaven *

On your mark, get set, ramen! Ippudo is a chic, spacious venue, right near Astor Place. I LOVED the art on display, including the front bar's ramen counter, and the pieces in the corner where we sat. Their low seats also lent a sort of informality to the place that I liked. We arrived at noon and, to my surprise, our party of 11 was handled with ease. As we walked to our table, Ippudo's staff greeted us with shouts of "irasshaimase!" (Japanese for welcome). Service was exceedingly polite, not stuffy by any means, and our server took our orders without any major issues. Armed with wooden chopsticks and large spoons (and hangovers, for a few), we attacked our lunches with gusto: my spicy tonkotsu ramen ($13; extra spicy, got it at the hottest level) came with hot sauce, ground pork, sliced cabbage, onions and scallions. I forgot to order a raw egg for my ramen, but asked for one separately. (Definitely get the raw egg added BEFORE your soup gets to you.) I opted out of the $2 noodle refills (Kae-dama), but my friends didn't, taking advantage of the extra goodness. Hit up Ippudo for a tasty meal.

Wow, I think I've found the most amazing ramen in the U.S. After much research on Yelp and various blogs, I decided to come here last week to see if all the raves were accurate. And they delivered. We took the subway from the upper west side to the East Village and it was windy as hell that day. I was trucking along in my knee high boots trying not to topple, thinking about the nice, hot, bowl of ramen I'd be eating soon. Finally, we get to Ippudo, walk in, get a seat immediately and proceed to peruse the menu. There were so many options that I had to ask the waiter what to get. He recommended the Akamaru Modern which came with slices of berkshire pork, scallions, cabbage, onions and kikurage. I added seasoned bamboo shoots to it, being a Panda and all. I need my bamboo! My bf had the tonkotsu shoyu ramen which came with pork, cabbage, bamboo, 1/2 boiled egg, seaweed and scallions. We waited about 10 minutes and the ramen arrived in these huge ass bowls. I was so excited! I dug in and OMFG, it was freakin delicious! I used to not care for ramen much since I ate that stuff in college non stop, but damn Ippudo glamourized ramen! The noodles were thinner and straighter than other ramen I've had, pork was so tender that I barely had to chew it, veggies and bamboo shoots gave it nice texture and the broth was just amazing. It was perfectly seasoned with the right amount of fattiness, yet wasn't salty or greasy. Bravo! BF liked his ramen, which I tasted and liked as well. However, mine had better flavor overall. Service was polite and good. Our waiter seemed to know his ramen, so another plus for him. Prices were $13 per bowl of ramen, and a couple bucks per item you wanted to add. Not bad at all for good ramen. Out of all the places we dined at during our week in NYC, Ippudo still ranks in the top 5. I highly recommend this place for ramen lovers. It definitely lives up to its hype! PIX- http://pandaliciousformeÉ

I love going to restaurants with my kids. ÊThey're entertaining and know a lot of random games, so waiting for a table isn't always a bad thing (yes, what was funny when you were in elementary school is still funny now). My kids are also useful for moving us up a waitlist at places where I don't know the matre d': Ê Ê "Okay kids, can you put on the 'Daddy, I'm hungry and we've been Ê Ê Ê walking from 43rd to 59th St. look? ÊEyes bigger. ÊBigger!" Damn, that works especially well for hostesses. Ê Best of all, at happy hours, I can order six drinks at a time as I now have--count them--three (3) pairs of hands: TRIPLE THREAT, B*TCHES! Ê(And, unlike my friends, they don't drink what they're supposed to be "holding" for me. ÊWell, hardly ever, anyway.) Walking into Ippudo after a full day-after-Christmas double-decker bus tour of the city (don't ask, but I froze my ass off), we were excited to try their hot broth and ramen to warm up. ÊAlthough there was a bit of a wait, the younger of my two kids commandeered my BB to play BrickBreaker, the older one and I played a word game called "Ghost"* as I taught him the skill of talking smack. ÊWell, technically HE was teaching ME as he was kicking my butt (let's just say these kids inherited their intelligence from their mom, and good looks from me)--I blame my loses on the masu of sake, a junmai ginjo from the Niigata prefecture of Miyao Shuzo, Shimeharitsuru and glass of shochu I had while we were waiting to be called (thanks though, to the bartender, Yuka, for introducing me to them). Luckily, we sat down before he totally lost all respect for my spelling skillz (he thought I let him win, and who was I to disagree), and we ordered: Shiromaru Hakata Classic - The original tonkutsu soup noodles with slices of simmered berkshire pork, kikurage, red pickled ginger, menma, egg, sesame and scallions ($13). ÊWow, I am glad I dragged the two little runts across town for this. Akamaru Modern - The original tonkutsu soup noodles with Ippudo's special sauce, miso paste and fragrant garlic oil; slices of simmered berkshire pork, kikurage, red pickled ginger, menma, egg, sesame and scallions ($13). ÊI think the broth of this edged out the classic by *fingers together* theeeese much. Ê Tori Tatsuta-age - Marinated fried chicken with sweet chili mayonnaise and spicy sauce ($10). ÊThis was some good eatz, right heah. ÊI almost felt bad about telling the kids this was vegetables so I could eat it all myself, except they looked at each other with the "We know what Tatsuta-age means, dad." look, shrugged, and then ate it anyway. ÊDamn kids. Kakuni - Berkshire pork belly braised in soy-based sauce, served with bok choy and a flavored hard boiled egg, wasabi soybean sauce ($9). ÊCHILDHOOD OBESITY, HERE WE COME. ÊThe kids loved this (apple doesn't fall far from the tree), and I had to pull rank on them to even taste a piece of this. I'm going to print this as my "STAY OUT OF NURSING HOME CARD". (I don't plan to live that long anyway, but just in case. ÊJust in case.)

Yes! I finally got to eat at one of the most coveted ramen establishments known to man. You can be jealous now. A culinary sampling of New York just wouldn't be complete without a visit to Ippudo. Unfortunately I got on the wrong train and was delayed 45 minutes, further building my anticipation. Nothing beats a bowl a bowl of slurp-tastic ramen on a cold winters day so I was overjoyed that I only had to endure a 30 minute wait. I had to order Ippudo's signature bowl, the Akamaru Modern to which I added a poached egg. The lunch set also included a side salad and choice of side rice dish. I thought it was a good value for $16. I'm also a sucker for pork buns so I threw in an order of that as well. I really liked the pork buns. I can't believe how delicious these animals are. Crispy skin, savory fat and tender meat all contained in a pillowy soft steamed bun. Perfection. The tonkotsu broth was the star of the show, dark and beaded with oil and melted fat, it was both luscious and smooth. A mellow yet assertive flavor only made more naughty with the introduction of the gooey yolk of the poached egg. The chasu was tender and delicious but not the most tender I've had and there was only two modest slices. The noodles were also a bit soft for my liking, I prefer a nice firm snap to my noodles but still quite good nevertheless. Overall a great experience, albeit a rather expensive one for a bowl of ramen, salad, rice and pork buns but when shared makes a rather good lunch-sized portion for two. A must try!

I like noodles. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. Ippudo is a a chain restaurant from Japan. From what I've been told Ippudo in Japan is cheap and simple. Ippudo here not. The place itself is super-glam. The staff is great. The ramen are the best I've ever had. Even though it's a little costly it's worth every penny. The only thing that keeps me from making this my number one ramen bitch, is that it gets very crowded and the wait can be long. That's okay sometimes because they have a great sake bar at the front. _____

I'm just gonna say it and be done with... This place is OVERRATED. If you're a tourist who likes to spend a hefty penny for some ramen (and overpriced appetizers if you're really hungry), come here. What irked me was that I couldn't customize my modern ramen to include the chewy soy noodles. It's only available of you opt for the $2 kaedama where you get extra noodles (meat costs extra). It's not to say that the quality isn't amazing, but for the same quality of food, less wait time (2 hrs?? Ridick!), and better Ê Êbang for your buck, I'd rather hit up Totto Ramen in HK.

As promised from my previous review, I brought a bunch of newbies to Ippudo. ÊEven on a weekday with heavy rain, there was a wait of about 40 minutes to get a seat for 6. This time for appetizers I ordered a Êspecial menu item made of baby octopuses for $7. ÊCan't remember the name of it and since it's not part of the regular menu, I can't look it up. ÊThis dish was delicious but for the price, all we got were 4 very small bite sized pieces. ÊValue for your money this is not. We ordered the pork buns and everyone was in agreement that this was so good. ÊWon't repeat myself so I'll leave it to my previous review to describe how much I love these buns. Ê The Spicy Ramen was what I ordered this time. ÊThis was also the reason why I am even bothering to update this review. ÊWhy oh why is this dish not part of the regular menu? ÊIt was the special ramen dish of the month so I was finally able to try it this time after reading so much about it ( last time I was there, it wasn't available). ÊIt's not really that spicy but the hint of spice mixed with the fragrant, rich, porky broth gives it an extra kick to elevate it above even the other already extraordinary broths from this place. Learning from my mistake from last my last visit, this time I knew that I could get a refill of the noodles for only 2 bucks more. I found out that they even allow you to choose between their thin or thick noodles for the refill. ÊIf you wanted to try a different type of noodle then the one that came with your broth, this is a cheap way to do it to see what works for you for future visits. I also ordered an extra helping of pork belly for the noodle refill. ÊIt was $4 and I was expecting the same size portion as what they put into the regular noodle order but was pleasantly surprised when they returned with two huge chunks of pork belly in a wooden cup sized container. ÊAs always, these were so good with flavorful fat mixed into the "it's so soft that it's falling apart already" pork belly meat. Once the meal was done, one of my friends (who was very hard to please with new food places) said to me, "Wing, we need to come back here often." New addicts converted. ÊPromise kept. ÊMission accomplished.

Will someone please tell me exactly what everyone is creaming themselves over, here? Ê I mean, okay, the space is kind of cool, but in a very trying-to-get-featured-on-Gossip-Girl kind of way. ÊGiant open kitchen with lots of screaming cooks and servers, communal tables made from redwood trunks, the Top Ramen-filled bar--it just all seems very...deliberate. ÊI can totally see Serena and Dan coming here during one of those isn't-it-cute-when-Serena-slums-it-for-her-wrong-?side-of-the-tracks-boyfriend Êmoments we've all come to love on GG...aren't they the best? ÊShut up, you know you watch it. And the ramen? ÊWell, for more $$ than at Momofuku you get a lot less soup, and a lot fewer items in your soup as well. ÊNot okay! ÊTo be fair, the broth and noodles were extremely rich and tasty. ÊBut the pork? ÊCome on! ÊThere was just one tiny slice of meat that wasn't all that fresh tasting, whereas David Chang gives me basically half a pig's worth of deliciously tender shredded yumminess. ÊIt's kind of a no-brainer. After leaving, I can only conclude that the whole ramen thing is veeeery close to jumping the shark. ÊHopefully Ippudo will make it onto GG before it's *totally* not cool anymore. Êxoxo...

Okay. ÊSeriously...$13 for a bowl of ramen?!?! ÊAre you seriously serious?! ÊWith tax and tip, one bowl of ramen cost me $16. ÊAnd that bowl of ramen was not big either. ÊFor that kind of money, I can get TWO decent bowls of ramen! Ippudo serves only one type of broth--tonkatsu. ÊI have to admit the broth is really good. ÊIt scored major brownie points when I saw that there weren't many fatty floaties, like many tonkatsu broths do. ÊBut I'm not a fan of their noodles. ÊThey use thin angel-hair-like noodles, rather than the thicker, somewhat curly-type of ramen noodles I'm used to seeing. ÊI didn't like the thin noodles. ÊTheir stewed Berkshire pork was fatty and literally melted in my mouth. ÊBut the portions are too small. ÊI was not satisfied when I left, so I got myself a falafel sandwich (such a fatso, I know). The interior and decor is really chic and modern. ÊI came around noontime on a Wednesday and it was not crowded at all. ÊI thought the place was closed because there was no long line in sight, as I had anticipated. ÊOverall, albeit the tonkatsu broth was really good, I don't think this ramen was worth my $16.

So how long is the wait here? Let's put it this way... if you're supposed to meet somebody outside the Union Square/14th St. station, but you're a stupid tourist and you end up getting off at 14th St./7th Ave. instad (and obviously didn't even take the right Metro line), if this person were to walk clear across town to come retrieve you (since you don't know your way around and it's cold and scary outside) and together you walk back all the way from the way way West Village to the freaking far East Village and arrive at your destination some unknown amount of time later, you'd STILL be waiting. Yeah, about that long. BUT, I'd like to say that it's actually worth it. 'Til there was Ippudo, I'd never "dined" on ramen. However, ramen is one of my most favorite foods ever, so to have it served up pretty and posh in an upscale restaurant every once in a blue moon is actually a treat. I was quite happy with our meal here. Started off with the avocado and tofu tartare (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É), garnished with "kelp beads" and served on a bed of clear rice noodles, two sauces on the side. Wouldn't have been my first choice, but it was different, in a good way. I was especially a fan of the sesame sauce. For the main course, I ordered the "Shiromaru Hakata Classic" (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É), while new friend tried the "Akamaru Modern" (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É). True to its name, mine was quite the typical standard flavor ramen; the Akamaru is a little different, and comes with a meatball-looking thing on top (I think it's just the special sauce). The noodles here are straight--sort of the same width and look of soba noodles (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É). Yet their consistency is straight up ramen. Yum. I am glad though that I didn't spend the entire wait in the cramped entrance area... though the art in the front is pretty cool, one can only stare at a bunch of bowls forming a bowl for so long (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É). The bathroom though is quite the art show! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É)

Ippudo or Ippudon't, that is the question Whether 'tis nobler in the belly to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous ramen, Or to take arms against a sea of bad service. It's Thursday night, and the mood is right, gonna have some fun go get ramen, TGIT. ÊOr ... maybe not. ÊIt was 10:30pm, why was the wait 30 minutes, wow this place must be really good. ÊThere weren't many Caucasians so I was excited that it would be awesome, totally authentic and really delicious. ÊHmmmm... By the time we were seated, B and I were STARVING. ÊWe picked out what we wanted immediately. ÊThen...waited, waited and waited. ÊAnd, realized how uncomfortable the table was that we were sitting at. ÊYes, a cute idea to have a tree trunk like table, but totally dysfunctional. ÊFinally we ordered, I got the modern, B the original. ÊWe waited, waited and waited. ÊRamen doesn't take that long, this I know. (as the guy seated next to us came 20 minutes after us and got his food the same time we did...) Finally the food came, but ... well there was a language barrier of sorts. ÊI ended up getting B's and she ended up getting mine, and of course we didn't realize it until we were mostly finished. ÊThat was annoying, and our server was one of the people who brought the food, so yeah, nice job. The Ramen broth was rich, velvety and flavorful. ÊBut, there was hardly anything else in there, I kept looking in through the noodles like a treasure hunter. ÊNothing was too be found. ÊAnd, there weren't that many noodles, which is good for my waistline but annoying for my wallet. People love this place, I don't get it. ÊMaybe I'm a ramen hater?

The idea of paying in excess of $10 for "Noodle Soup" doesn't really entice my taste buds. ÊOf course, paying north of $20 for a large Margherita Pizza made with either Fresh / Buffalo Mozzarella is also deemed as insane, yet I do it anyway. ÊBe that as it may, not having the pleasure of dining at Ippudo NY (after having eaten at other ramen notables as Momofuku Noodle Bar, Men Kui Tei, and Menchanko Tei), is comparable to saying you've had the best sushi in NY, without having gone to either Sushi Yasuda or Masa. ÊWith that in mind, I ventured off to Ippudo NY on one fine Sunday afternoon. Arriving at the Ippudo was a sight in its own right. ÊIt was evident that despite it being 2:30pm, there was already a wait for the table. ÊI promptly entered the restaurant and requested a table for two. ÊThe host, Pierre, stated that it would be a 45 minute wait. ÊI proceeded to put my name down and headed straight to Pommes Frites during the 45 minute wait time (see Pommes Frites review)... 30 minutes later... I returned to Ippudo and was immediately seated after checking in with Pierre... The Ambiance... ÊIs best described as sleek with a modern Japanese twist. ÊThe first notable eye catching display of the restaurant is the wall immediately behind the bar. ÊThe wall is decorated with various ramen noodle bowls from different areas and time frame in Japan. ÊAdditionally, the restaurant area has wall dcor ranging from Japanese writing, black and red panels, as well as strategically positioned fluorescent lighting. ÊLastly, the open kitchen provides a first hand sight into the ramen bowl assembly process. ÊIt is clear, that the management company in charge of Ippudo spared no expense in making this establishment as "date friendly" as possible, while eliminating the common "hole in the wall" stereotype when it comes to noodle shops. The Service: ÊWas comparable and understanding to any amendatory requests of a particular dish. ÊI found that our waiter paid special attention to our requests when ordering and was prompt when requesting extra water or tea. ÊThe turnover time is more favorable than that of any other noodle soup restaurant. ÊIppudo provides a relaxing atmosphere that's laid back, which omits the feeling of a conveyor belt operation. ÊOur meal time at Ippudo lasted about an hour, at any other noodle shop, 15 - 20 minutes at most. The Food... Appetizer: Fried Shrimp w/ Spicy Mayo ($12) - 5 Extra Large Shrimp are Tempura Battered, then Deep Fried and topped with a Mild Spicy Mayo. ÊThe Shrimp are served over a Mixed Green Salad with Balsamic Vinegar. ÊAt first bite, the richness of the dish was evident in that the golden fried texture of the shrimp works harmoniously with the velvety spicy mayo. ÊThe mixed green salad provided the acidity and texture required to balance out the heaviness of the shrimp and spicy mayo. Ramen Courses: Miso Ramen ($12) - Ramen Noodles in a thick broth, served with Berkshire Pork Cha Shu. ÊThe only nod against this application is the lack of content served for the price paid! ÊThe bowl contained two 1/4 ounce slices of Bershire Pork and at most 3 ounces of ramen noodle. ÊDespite the food contents of the bowl, the taste of the broth and noodles are best described as remarkable! ÊThe ramen noodle possessed an overwhelmingly fresh taste, that was greatly aided by the lightly salted / creaminess of the pork broth. ÊGranted, I had to request a Kae-Dama (extra noodle serving). ÊNevertheless, the taste of the noodle itself is incomparable to any other ramen establishment I've had the pleasure of dining at. Shoyu Ramen ($12) - Ramen Noodle in a Soy Sauce flavored borth, served with Berkshire Pork Cha Shu. ÊThe application of this dish is similar to the Miso Ramen with respects to the contents. ÊThe ramen used in the Shoyu application was that of a finer coarse ramen noodle (similar to the egg noodles found in Chinese noodle shops). ÊThe texture of the noodle was well balanced with the darker and saltier broth. ÊOne nod against the application would be that the soy sauce flavored ramen was a bit too salty and overwhelmed the semi-delicate texture of the fresh ramen. ÊOf course, the choice by the chef to use this particular broth with the ramen was of perfect pairing, as the ramen used in the Miso application would've been overwhelmed by the saltiness in the Soy Sauce Broth. The overall impression of Ippudo was that of applause and appreciation. ÊFor starters, Ippudo reinforces the notion that it's patronage understands the difference between fresh and processed ramen. ÊIn addition, the extra step Ippudo takes in properly matching the correct broth and noodle allows for a consumer to appreciate how the basic concept of "paying attention to detail" can render such a highly acclaimed product.

I'm reminded of the old adage, 'good things come to those who wait'. ÊFor me, it's been a 2 year wait (normally it's about 1-1.5 hours), as i've never had the patience to stick it out for an hour+ for a $14 bowl of noodles. Ê For the past two years since Ippudo's opening, the process would follow this pattern: 1. ÊIppudo! 2. Ê2 hour wait (guh) 3. ÊFuck it, let's go to Setagaya 4. ÊLeave unhappy This time around, we made the right decision: 1. ÊIppudo! 2. Ê2 hour wait (beer and good company helps) 3. ÊFuck! this ramen is amazing. ÊThe broth beats the coveted broth at Minca, the noodles are more toothsome than Setagaya's, and the pork buns come close to rivaling David Chang's. Ê 4. ÊLeave happy

For a party of four, wait time was just under 90mins on a Saturday afternoon.. but it was all good with a bottle of Yebisu (which is now officially my fav Japanese beer)~!! ÊAs we get seated, I am absolutely loving our booth! ÊSo spacious and comfortable ahhhh~!! ÊSo.. I wasn't expecting much to be honest even though my trustworthy Yelp buddy was raving about Ippudo. ÊI guess it's only because I couldn't count the number of Japanese noodle restaurants I've been to that claim they were authentic in the DC, MD, VA area.. only to find myself frowning @@; So we start off with Pork Buns & Hirata Chicken Wings. ÊHoly shizz they were amazing!! ÊBut how was it so good when so simple!? ÊPork, a piece of lettuce & mayo. ÊWTF? ÊDon't pass up on these if you come here, it was just soooo good. ÊAnd the wings.. I thought to myself how good can they be? ÊThey looked crispy and cajun, so it should taste alright. ÊWrong.. they were freaking amazing wth!? ÊI'd say noticably a lot better than Bon Chon (well I haven't been to the one in NY so you can tell me otherwise), but I was telling myself basically.. WOW. ÊI guess that must mean the noodles were alright because the appetizer's were coverup. Here comes our noodles, each served in a unique bowl different from one another. ÊWe all stare at it for a good minute just in awe, yeah it sounds very strange and was quite peculiar too because we didn't even taste it yet.. ÊAnyhow, it is basically Heaven o0o.. yeah. ÊNever tasted anything like the Shoyu ramen which is what I ordered. ÊI had a sip of everyone elses soup base but I was most satisfied with mine. ÊUpon finishing the noodles, it was a bit too much for me to drink the rest of my soup because of its rich flavor! ÊI mean it was good, but my stomach couldn't handle the part about feeling fatty afterwards haha. ÊStop reading my review and gogo!

Do not leave here without having the steamed pork buns. The sweet and spicy sauce on the tender pork slices wrapped up in a sweet, flat mantou-like bun (http://en.wikipedia.org/É) is superb in every way. Order it at the bar while you wait the average hour or so it takes to get seated. I had the spicy ramen - the name escapes me but it comes in mild, spicy or extra spicy. The rich sauce was so fragrant and spicy. I love how thin and fresh the ramen is. I could have used more than two thin slices of pork and cabbage but I made do. I had a lot of broth left over and wasn't totally full so I requested another serving of noodles to drop into the broth (only an extra $2). The staff was quick and responsive. I adore the decor. I can't wait to come back here again and again and again.

I don't care what the recent reviews say. I orgasm at the THOUGHT of ippudo ramen. (and I'm not that easy to please, if you know what i mean.) If you have taste buds, then you won't be disappointed. The best part of Ippudo is the broth...it's not like every other Ramenya in NYC -- meaning I don't sit there asking, "Can i have some ramen with that salt?" The broth is rich, tasty, and just...purrrfect. (Yes, it makes me purr...on top of the other noises that uncontrollably slip from my lips while I stuff my face...oh-so-seductively) The pork buns...oh man those juicy, tender pork buns. I love pork, but when you stuff it in some hot buns and spread it with that special sauce...my eyes roll back. ...Is it hot in here? Look, if you want great ramen, great decor, and great company...then invite me to eat w/ you at Ippudo ;-) (If you don't want to wait for an hour, then don't go at primetime. Go at 5 or 6 and you'll get seated in 15 minutes or less. But yes, it's extremely popular so if you want to try it w/o the crowds, head over for lunch or for an earlier dinner.) Ok...I'm seriously heading there now. I'm so addicted. I'll be the girl ignoring her friend and throwing back the bowl like it's a shot glass.

Disclaimer: For a 5 star review, Ippudo's pork buns are NOT as good as Momofuku's. Their ramen is worth the wait. On a Saturday night at 930pm, a party of 4 had to wait 45 minutes. This place is poppin' since it's right next to NYU. The prices are decent and the interior is swanky and hip. The interior reminds me of a Vegas lounge that would serve up expensive sushi or something. Ippudo is definitely a hot spot and I really dig their L shaped seats. I turned it around to sit on it like a V...very relaxing. PORK BUNS http://static.px.yelp.coÉ Go to Momofuku instead. BAMBOO TEMPURA (special of the night) http://static.px.yelp.coÉ I don't like bamboo but I like tempura. Thought I'd take a bite of this and it was alright. The bamboo was crispy, and it came with a dipping sauce and 3 powdery things. I don't know what it was. The others at our table enjoyed this! FRESH GRAPEFRUIT SAKE DRINK http://static.px.yelp.coÉ Ok that's not what it's called, but it was something along those lines. They give you a glass of sake with some spritzer in it and there's half a grapefruit with a squeezer next to it. You squeeze as much grapefruit juice as you want to add to your drink. It's an interesting concept but I view it as manual labor, haha! RAMEN http://static.px.yelp.coÉ It doesn't matter what ramen you order -- they're ALL good. I was able to try the special of the night w/ some silky chicken broth. That was good. I got the Amakame Modern (??) ramen and that was good too. Had a meatier taste to it b/c of the broth. Yummy ramen, and yummy noodles. I would come back to Ippudo for Ramen on my next visit to NYC. The wait is worth it, trust!

Took my friend here for a belated birthday dinner. ÊAs she was running late and the front room was already filled with people waiting, I thought we might have to wait for a really long time. ÊBut, I was seated right away - yay! There were booths for large parties, a round communal table, bar seating and conventional table seating. Ê I sat at the square communal table with the chairs that look like a loveseat, but they actually separate from each other to be one-armed individual chairs. ÊI really liked the sparkly mural piece on the wall in the conventional seating area. When my friend finally showed up, we ended up ordering the mixed apps plate and salmon carpaccio to start and the akamaru and the karaka-men. The mixed apps were 5 little portions: pickled vegetables, grilled pork on salad, braised pork, a shrimp tempura on tartar sauce and I guess the last one was just not memorable enough to remember... ÊDecent, with the shrimp tempura being one of the best that I've ever had. ÊUsually shrimp tempura are made with shrimps that are too small and tempura that's just a bit gummy under the crunchiness. ÊThis was a large shrimp that was perfectly crunchy and not greasy and sat in a small puddle of tartar sauce that tasted homemade. The loss of its star for me was the salmon carpaccio. ÊPlease don't call it carpaccio if it's not raw. ÊI really should have refused it and sent it back. ÊThis carpaccio was a plate of about 8-10 slices of FULLY-COOKED salmon surrounding a small dressed salad. ÊIf you watched Top Chef this season, this is kind of what I think Richard's sous vide salmon would have tasted like. ÊTo give some credit, the salmon was not overcooked. ÊIt was prepared well, but seemed a bit watery... ÊI would not recommend anyone order this dish. After that disappointment, I was really starting to look forward to my ramen. ÊMy friend ordered the Karaka-men - spicy. ÊShe said it was good. ÊI'll take her word for it, as I couldn't pull myself away from my Akamaru ramen. The broth was thick and rich and full of porky-flavored goodness. ÊThe ramen was on the thin side, but not overcooked to mushiness. It had a pleasing bite to it - al dente, I guess. ÊI splurged and had kakuni added to mine. ÊI figured that if I didn't like the ramen, I wouldn't want to come back just to have another $13 bowl of ramen with pork belly in it... ÊThe kakuni was a good balance of pork and fattiness. ÊI liked the ball of yuzu kosho (yuzu pepper paste) that melted away into my broth. And, although the broth may have been a touch on the salty side, I did try to finish it all. ÊIt was THAT GOOD. Love the toasted sesame grinders on the table. ÊAdds a yummy nuttiness to your ramen. ÊI may have to get myself one at home and do that instead of sesame oil from now on! Dessert options are limited - green tea brulee or sweet tofu. ÊWe passed and went to Cha-an instead.

We flew all the way from California to try ramen in NY. Arrived at 4pm. Failed. Closed until 5pm. Returned at 4:50pm and the line was already 50 folks deep. (Are you effin kidding me?!) So... Was it worth turning into a popsicle stick from standing in 20 degree weather for half an hour? Was it worth suffering from a small case of claustrophobia waiting for an open table? Was it worth jerkface people cutting in line because they didn't have the courtesy to wait like everyone else? Hell freakin yes. Hidden in the basement of Ippudo lies a secret ramen-making room where it's just one man and a machine constantly shooting out strands of firm slippery noodles throughout the entire evening. Talk about freshness to the max! One of the best parts of dinner was sitting at the bar watching all the chefs at work. This was also dangerous, seeing every appetizer dish work it's way out of the kitchen. If only I had a heartier appetite at the moment, I would have ordered everything...but I am only human, so my brother and I just tasted the Samurai Ribs. With just one gentle touch from the knife, the entire chunk of meat instantly fell off the bone. Meat so tender, teeth are not required to eat (I kid you not). By recommendation from the hostess, I went with the Akamaru Modern (ramen in tonkatsu broth w/ Ippudo's special sauce, miso paste, garlic oil, chashu, & half a boiled egg + extra corn) - supposedly their most popular bowl. It was truly love at first sip. The flavor was not too overwhelming with salt and spices, but rather thick and subtle. I was skeptical with the garlic oil overpowering the tonkatsu broth, but it was the perfect touch to an already perfectly fragrant soup. The noodles were the straight, slippery kind, but somehow managed to stay super firm. I "ooh'd" and "ahh'd" after every spoonful of this wonderful meal. I assure you, not one drop of soup was left at the bottom of my bowl. The only gripe about Ippudo were the outrageous prices. I'm ok with throwing down $14-16 for a hefty bowl of ramen, especially when it's top notch quality, but I'd also expect more than just one piece of chashu or even a full boiled egg instead of just half. For that, I knocked off one star because as much as I fell head over heels over this ramen, I can't say it was worth what I paid for. Then again...you've gotta fork over the bills if ya want the good stuff.

After hearing much reviews about Ippudo, I decided to check this place out..all the way from California. We arrived on Friday night, party of 4 at 7pm. The wait is 2.5 hrs. Good lord. Really? We put our name down and went to eat someplace else, walked around, and came back 2 hrs later. Still waited another hour, making that a 3-hr wait for some ramen. This better be DAMN GOOD. Finally got seated, service was excellent, and the food quality was great. We ordered some of the daily specials and the famous pork buns which were all very yummy. The biggest disappointment was the ramen. Broth was good but too buttery. Are there not that many good ramen places in New York hence people line up 2+ hrs for some noodles? Sooo not worth the wait. Go on a weekday to avoid the long wait. They do have good food, service, and ambience. The food came out super quick and tasted fresh. Minus one star for the ramen being not the best ramen I've ever had and minus another star the uber ridiculous wait!

To be fair, this place might be worth 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding down based on the fact that I personally will not likely return - which is generally what a 3-star rating means coming from me. ÊI had a pleasant night here; the wait wasn't too terrible (even on a Friday night at 8:30, for 2), the service was excellent, the drinks were tasty, the food was fine. Being so new, not only is the decor lovely and modern-Asian, with sleek wood, expansive booths, and a clean, open kitchen - it's also in perfect shape, and has that shiny-new feel to it as a result. It was a bit on the loud side, but otherwise a lovely ambiance. The bar and a few squat seats at the front ameliorate the wait for a table. And yes, it's a wait, I'm guessing around 30 minutes for us - perfectly acceptable. Our server seated us at a truly MASSIVE booth in the corner - the king's seating, really, one could not choice a better location - which was nice of them, considering that the place was packed. Food service was attentive, but my friend found that he had to ask for more drinks, which annoyed him a bit. I could not complain personally; the speed was not zippy, but neither was it lethargic, and I found the staff Êvery friendly. Now, the food. I do not eat pork or seafood, which obviously limited my choices rather dramatically. I knew this going in, but I have to say - I'm still sad they don't offer a SINGLE noodle soup without pork. Yes, I know, ramen is traditionally made with pork - BUT STILL! We are a city Êof many Jews! Work outside the box a bit. I ended up getting the pickled vegetables ($7) (carrots, peppers, radish, tomato - fresh, crisp, and nicely sweet-sour but not outstanding) and the Crispy Chicken Karaage Ê($7) (battered and deep fried, served over baby greens and with a side of sauce - and tasty taro chips). Now. the chicken was quite good, probably 4-star, all white meat, tender, with a tasty, crispy coating, and the sweet, tangy dipping sauce was delicious. However, the portion was a bit on the small side - I realize it's meant as an appetizer, and as an appetizer it's not meagerly,but considering the lack of larger non-pork dishes, I was a bit bummed. A wasabi-based dressing lightly flavoured the greens, but I'm not a huge wasabi fan. I also split the omelet (a special - $9ish) with my friend - it came as 4 thick wedges, one of which was stamped, or should I say branded, with IPPUDO, and the texture was good - not dry or undercooked - but I found the flavour oddly smoky in an off-putting way. They came with a miso-drenched pile of shredded radish, which was not bad, but overall I found this dish extremely mediocre. My friend got the Pork Ramen Original - Akamaru Shin - Aji ($13) with both the special toppings ($1-2/each) (one was a cured egg, which he said was awesome), and he reports that the broth was rich and flavourful, and the dish overall worthy of 4 stars. It was a generous portion, with good proportions of broth and noodles (which seemed more angel hair-like than ramen-like, to my eye), but I agree with other reviewers who noted the somewhat sparse Êallotment of actual meat. We each had the Hakata cocktail - sake, grapefruit juice, and soda - which is one of the better cocktails I've had in a while. Smooth and tasty and highly recommended. ÊI am no sake expert, but the selection seemed good, and my friend had a few different sakes which he enjoyed. One of them was presented in a neat little wooded box, which I found clever. The staff let us linger at our table for hours, which was considerate, and brought us out small mugs of Êhot Genmaicha (toasted rice green tea) at the end - which was Êexcellent tea, and a lovely touch. Still, I left hungry and unimpressed, Êdespite the lovely ambiance and service. I am also highly annoyed that: 1. They do not take reservations. 2. They do not deliver or even do TAKE OUT!

I was really expecting a Tampopo-worthy experience at Ippudo but alas, I didn't find it in my bowl of Shiromaru Hakata Classic ($13) which is according to the menu, '"the original tonkotsu" soup noodles with slices of simmered berkshire pork, kikurage, red pickled ginger, menma, 1/2 hard boiled egg, sesame & scallions." The first two sips of soup were delicious but I soon found it as oppressive as a gorilla fur coat on a NYC subway platform in August. I mean, that broth was so rich, a few more minutes on the stovetop would've turned it into demi-glace! I couldn't finish my bowl. Neither could my Japanese-food-loving friend who ordered the same dish. And trust me, we are not the dainty salad-eating type of girls. Also the noodles were way too al dente for me. I like a chewy springiness in my ramen noodles but these were almost crunchy. I liked that the egg was on the softer side rather than fully hard-boiled but I can cook a decent egg at home, too. I might come back on another trip to try the lighter Shoyu Ramen...or I might just save $12 and the extra $8 I spent on a bottle of Yebisu beer, plus tax and tip, and simmer up a package of Sapporo Ichiban at home.

I've died and gone to RAMEN heaven. ÊSeriously, the pork belly ramen is soooo amazing. Ê Your arteries won't thank you but your tastebuds will. ÊThe broth is simply unforgettable, sooo rich and incredibly tasty. ÊThe pork is stewed to perfection, tender and delectable, and sooooo flavorful. ÊI also loved the dressing for the Ippudo salad. Even if you go off peak hours, there will be a line. ÊFriendly and fast service. ÊI love the design of the place and all the attention put into the decor. ÊGreat ambience.

What baby? I don't see no baby. My BFF recently had a baby and decided to take her to NY. The girl needed to be introduced to shopping and the foodie experience. I brainstormed baby friendly spaces and thought that Ippudo would be okay. I've never seen a "NO STROLLERS" sign up front and have seen quite a bit of families in attendance before. Even still, we didn't exactly parade the baby for show. When our party was finally called, the hostess looked at us wide eyed and surprised. "Oh my gosh! You have a baby!," she said. Was that a bad thing? We got kind of scared. "If I had known you had a baby, we would have given you a better table," she informed us. Oh well. That's okay. We're not fussy people. We sat down comfortably in a communal round table in front of the kitchen. My friends oohed and awed at the swankiness of the ramen house. Kids in California grow up on Maruchan and Sapporo Ichiban ramen at home. Manhattan kids grow up on Ippudo and Minca. Ippudo is very glitz and glamour and the ramen tries to compete. We started with the Hirata pork buns. They come 2 for $8 and while they are excellent, they are no match for Momofuku's. Then came the ramen each fashioned in their own style of bowl. I recommend the Kogashi Miso. The broth is made from roasted miso and topped with slices of berkshire pork, veggies and a layer of oil. It's amazing. The charred flavor of the soup is so unique. I've never heard of or had ramen like this anywhere else. I've also tried the classic Akamaru Modern ramen. The soup is less adventurous and the noodles are a bit thinner. It's good but not as interesting as the Kogashi Miso. During our meal my friend had noticed a party that was seated after us. It was the same party they had seen earlier at another restaurant. For whatever reason, this party got their food faster than us. The same thing happened at the other restaurant. The scenario had the makings Êof a Seinfeld episode, if that show were still alive today. Usually the service I experience at Ippudo is quick. Today, with baby, they had shunned us into a corner and kind of forgot about us. Compared to the other party, Ippudo let us sit for an extra 45 minutes. The leisure of it quickly turned into waiting and waiting and waiting for the food and for the bill. Lesson of visit- a baby announcement may get you a better table but not necessarily better service. Ê I will no doubt say that the ramen at Ippudo is the best in Manhattan. The line outside and food inside merits that. However, it won't get the five stars from me. I find the place loud, stressful and a bunch of hoopla. I prefer Menkui Tei where it's quiet and just about the meal. About the loudness. This is the one time I wish Yelp had audio bits. I would end this review with the good-bye the employees give to their customers. I have no idea how to spell it in Japanese but it always makes me smile. Same thing for their hellos. No matter how busy Ippudo is, they stop in their tracks and acknowledge you.

I've heard so much good about this place from friends that I knew I had to try it out. I wasn't that impressed. ÊWhat made the experience worst is that I had to wait 2 hours to eat Ramen.

I don't quite understand the appeal of "authentic" Ramen, But we HAD to come here because my friend is noodle shaman. This hipster noodle spot seems to generate the most hype. After waiting over half an hour in line, I was ready to gripe. We killed some time by sipping Sapporo at the small corner bar. For a noodle shop, the clubby atmosphere certainly seemed bizarre. Dcor is modern chic with a bouncy house music beat. Upon entering, the staff gave us a loud "WELCOME!" (in Japanese) greet. They seated us at a communal table right next to steam filled open kitchen, It made us feel so sweaty that we could see all our faces glisten. We didn't mind sharing a table with total strangers. Everyone at our table looked normal, so we were in no apparent danger. The diners were mostly young Asian groups or an NYU crowd, Not a place for conversations since the jam-packed atmosphere is too loud. Be prepared for the servers' rushed up pace, They can make your dining experience feel very much like a race. For starters, we had their famous steamed pork buns. They were different compared to the hoisin and pickled Momofuku ones. Buns were fluffy and the pork belly was oozing with fat, It made our lips so greasy that the guys facing us couldn't stop staring and laugh. The secret sauce was both lip-stinging spicy and mildly sweet. They're too light to be a meal, but still a nice melt-in-your-mouth treat. For the main course, we all ordered the same thing in our group. We had the Akamaru Ramen in tonkotsu (pork bone) soup. The soup contained their special sauce, garlic oil, and miso paste. The fatty Berkshire pork gave it a mild creamy texture and nutty taste. The noodle itself was somewhat thin and brittle, But the portions overall were not that little. It's loaded with cabbage, egg, scallions, and kikurage mushrooms. This is probably the best ramen + soup combination I've ever consumed. Kudos! To you Ippudo!!!

On my first visit to Ippudo I had an inclination that it was worthy of five sexy stars. After my dinner there this week, I'm quite certain of that. The impressive cucumber we had last year has now earned a permanent place on the menu and you'd do well to order it. It was every bit as impressive this go 'round as the last. The pork buns and their spicy kick delighted our tongues as we waited for a bowl of Ippudo's one year anniversary special ramen to arrive. But the thing that sealed the deal on this five star joint? The grapefruit shochu cocktail (you squeeze the juice yourself!)

1900+ reviews!! ÊI rate it in the middle compared to the many ramen places I've been to in Japan, LA, and NY. ÊThe ambience is more NY lounge and trendy, and the flavors in both appetizers and ramen here are different than those of the chain of Ippudo restaurants in Japan. ÊIppudo NY is to ramen as Gyu-Kaku is to yakiniku. The best thing at Ippudo for me was their Agedashi Tofu, which is an appetizer of deep fried tofu garnished with thinly sliced nori, grated daikon, and green onion in a flavorful dashi broth. ÊFour good portions make this easy and fun to share. ÊTheir cucumber with sesame app was just ok for me. I tried the Akamaru and Shio Sai ramen (with monkfish liver). ÊThe hakata-style (thinner) noodle tasted fresh and the broth was good. ÊI was hungry so I requested the Kaedama (extra order of ramen) before finishing my first round of noodles. ÊAlthough we had a good time here, Ippudo would not be my first choice for ramen in NY...double the prices did not equal double the flavor here. ÊThis is the gateway experience into the world of ramen.

I had a one night stand with the ramen here and basically fell in love. Don't judge me. Because the hype around Ippudo? Warranted. Over two months since I had my meal there and not a day goes by that I don't crave their ramen - with the straight, perfectly cooked noodles, beautifully presented in a bowl that holds the most deliciously rich, silky, meat broth. Seriously, not a single day. That's how love works, after all. Not gonna lie, I flirted heavily with the idea of licking my bowl when my friends weren't looking . . . several times. In fact, I would've licked all their . . . bowls. Dude, I said don't judge me.

Wow! ÊWhy do I even bother schlepping across two rivers to Mitsuwa for their ramen when I can get my fix here? ÊNot only does this place have awesome ramen, it also has a funky layout, and the atmosphere definitely adds to the experience. Ê Hubby and I always get the pork belly buns to start. ÊI understand there's some hard-nosed competition between this version and Momofuku's, but I couldn't care less. ÊI'm here, dammit! ÊAnd I want some pork! ÊThis one comes with a spicy mayo dressing that's perfect. Judy, there are too many ramen choices- which one should I get? ÊGlad you asked. ÊThe Akamura modern ramen is the way to go. ÊIt's easily the richest-tasting and most complex broth out of all the ramens on the menu. Ê Sometimes I mix it up a bit and try whatever the special of the day is. However, what inevitably happens is I end up taking huge slurps from Hubby's bowl of Akamura modern. ÊIt is truly great to have someone in your life that you can always steal food from. ÊOh, did I say that out loud? ÊI meant share.

My dear Becca, I'll tell you what we're creaming ourselves over, here. THE FOOD. The cool space is a nice afterthought, and the wait is just one of those things you know to expect. It's New York, and good things are often popular. So it goes. Guys, the ramen is Ideal. and consistent. The noodles are perfect. The ingredients are fresh and flavorful, though they happily take a backseat to the broth that's made in the sweetest of dreams. The egg makes me cry. It's like the softest, loveliest, intensest delight. I'm sad I'm not eating one right now. And, duh, order the pork buns to kick things off.

It's ramen, but it's not ramen. This is a noodle experience. It's what Grimaldi's is to "pizza" or Shake Shack is to "burgers." It's the best in class. This is the Mercedes of ramen. Is there too much hype? Possibly. Is the wait too damn long most of the time? Absolutely! But everything on the menu - not just the ramen - is delicious and worth a wait that's under an hour. Value wise, you get a great ambiance, polite and attentive service, and an inspired menu filled with great tasting dishes made with fresh ingredients. There's also the odd healthy steamed item. I really love this place. Great ramen, and if you're a frequent visitor - you have got to try the other extraordinary Japanese menu items as well!

Wow. Delicious. The restaurant is handsome and makes me feel like I just got admitted into a cool night club (after patiently waiting an hour). While the classic ramen is good, I have a penchant for the modern ramen. Either way, I'll always order the extra kakuni (pork). The appetizer list seems to change often and with mixed results. Items such as the wasabi octupus and tuna tataki are terrible. On the other hand, the samurai rib, asparagus and pork buns are impressive. My grievance lies with the long wait time, but I guess there is enough hype to always have a long queue. Sometimes the crowd at the bar area is just as appealing as a sweaty, congested subway car during rush hour. I want to know why there are always three hostesses when only one does work (ok one of them seats patrons, but the other two are staring at each other)? Another interesting issue is the interior design flaw in the men's restroom. The mirror placement is interesting. Who wants to stare at themselves doing business, sitting down? My friends were chanting "kaedama" (extra noodles) all night... even when we wanted to throw up after the first kaedama and 3rd order of kakuni. This is a restaurant to try at least once, unless you are satisfied by inferior tasting ramen. IFHTP 3+

I've been contemplating what rating to give Ippudo for awhile. 4 stars it is, as yelp only has integer stars. In order to eat a $13 bowl of original Shiromaru ramen, we waited 2-3 hours in line. I arrived early after my wine class and put my name on "The List". 2 hours the hostess told me. 2 hours. for ramen. This better be the best ramen of my life, I thought to myself. I waited. We waited..and we weren't the only ones. Unlucky for us, those 2 plus hours was broken up in teasingly short 30 minute long increments. Only 30 minutes left.. we'll have a table ready after that she said. 30 minutes later... yes, only 45 minute wait left! wait... what? We finally make it in. Between Shiromaru, Akamaru, Miso Ramen, and Ramen salad, I choose the first ($13). I contemplate whether I should have ordered the extra noodles for an additional $2.95. It's already the most expensive ramen of my life, what's another 3 Shin Ramens.. I mean 3 bucks? It comes in a milky rich broth with the pale yellow noodles swimming beneath. Two pieces of pork lie atop accompanying the striped green scallions. Mmmm, the aroma. I dig in. First the broth. I drink and I slurp. Warmth and soothing richness coat my tongue in a comforting caress. A happy sigh escapes. The yellow curvy ramen noodles begin peaking out of the broth. A ha! Thin yet chewy. It is gone too soon. Hm, I should have left it alone in its brothy home to let it multiple a little longer. Oh, it doesn't work that way. I see. Well let's make a night of it. Sake! (at $65 dollars a bottle) Really smooth. ÊWe order two. Yipes! Matcha Brulee (Green tea brulee and vanilla ice cream with fruit and candied fruit slivers) Wow. Not over powering in its green tea-ness and yet, not overly sweet. Please sir, can I have some more? Ah.. a good meal. Worth a 2 hour plus long wait? Hard to say. I did it and still gave it 4 stars. I guess that speaks for itself. Would I do that again? Probably not. Maybe for a less busy lunch. They don't take reservations. (Obviously) review 4/11/2008 I.M.Y.

I had been waiting almost three years to get to Ippudo after first hearing the rumors of it opening in New York. ÊSure there were already tonkotsu (pork bone) ramen places in the city, but this was supposed to be - the - one to visit. ÊIt seemed that my attempts to reach here were foiled again and again: Attempt 1: ÊSeptember 2007 In New York. ÊReports indicate Ippudo is working on getting the chef and is still closed. Attempt 2: ÊJanuary 2008 In New York. ÊReports indicate Ippudo will open soon, and it finally does a few months later. Attempt 3: ÊAugust 2008 In Okayama, Japan waiting to transfer trains while on the way to visit family friends in the country. ÊDecided to explore Okayama and pass Ippudo on the way back to the train station. ÊDo not have enough time to eat there. Ê EPIC FAIL. Attempt 4: ÊSeptember 2008 Attempt to go to New York to visit friends and finally check out Ippudo. ÊWork causes cancellation of trip. ÊFriends call later and inform me that yes, Ippudo is amazing and yes, I missed some delicious ramen and yes, it was worth the wait. Ê:sad face: Attempt 5: ÊNovember 2008 Reach New York City. ÊBus hits a dumpster two blocks from Penn Station and we get stuck there for almost an hour before finally getting off. ÊFirst stop after dropping off bags is Ippudo. Since it was around 3:30, there was no line and no wait. ÊWe were seated right away. ÊThis place is huge! ÊAnd so much trendier than any ramenya I could have imagined. We settled on the shiromaru, the akamaru, and the karaka men. ÊIn minutes, three huge bowls of steaming hot ramen greeted us. Shiromaru - aka the classic. ÊDefinitely what to get if you want to experience Hakata style tonkotsu ramen. ÊThe soup wasn't as kotteri (thick? or fatty?) as I was expecting. Akamaru - The soup flavor was deeper than the shiromaru and maybe a little more kotteri. ÊI think I read somewhere that it was from miso or something. ÊAlso very good. Karaka - aka the spicy one. ÊI know they're not going for crazy spicy and it isn't kimchi jjigae, but it wasn't all that spicy. ÊStill had a good flavor, but I prefer the shiromaru and the akamaru. The soups were also great in that they weren't ridiculously salty like at some other ramenya I've visited. ÊI didn't have a desire to chug a gallon of water after finishing. The only sort of letdown for me was that the chashu (pork). ÊRamen masters are usually devoted to perfecting the soup, the noodles, and the chashu, and Ippudo's chashu wasn't as good as I had anticipated. ÊThe chashu had a good flavor but was a bit chewy, and the pork fat was just attached to the meat like it should have been discarded. ÊMy ideal Japanese style chashu is tender to the point of melting in your mouth, and any pork fat should be unctuous enough to give more flavor and juiciness without being overwhelmingly fatty or greasy. It may have been nice for them to ask how firm you wanted the noodles too, but they were fine. ÊMaybe my expectations were too high based on all the hype, but it was still was a great bowl of ramen. ÊIf they tweaked the chashu I'm sure they'd become even more popular. ÊIt would also be kind of cool if they added Kumamoto style ramen (tonkotsu ramen with garlic).

WHY DOES THE WAIT HAVE TO BE SO LONG!! We waited for 2 hours for a table for 8 people. I suggest you come an hour early to request Êtable. In the meantime, go to central bar around the corner for drinks. Ippudo will call you when your table is almost ready. There is a bar in the restaurant but the front waiting area is super crowded. The place is super dark and has a modern feel to it. When we were finally seated, we were only given 4 menus for 8 people .... good thing our waitress was super nice and fun. she gave good advice on what to order. From my personal experience I recommend: -pork buns -philly cheesesteak eggrolls -the modern -matcha creme brulee***(super good) It only took 20 mins for the ramen to come out! thank god, we were starving! i love the soup spoon they use. It made it super easy for us to try each other's bowls. they even give you wet naps! special thanks to adrian for taking 4 pictures of us without a complaint!

Wowsers, I love this place!!! Ippudo is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. My friend recommended us to check out this ramen place. ÊWe are forever grateful. Ramen is soul food. Forreals....this place is hands down delicious. { ATMOSPHERE } Typically, I talk about the atmosphere at the end of my reviews, but the decor of this place deserves to be highlighted first. The decor is very artsy and well-thought out. I love the bar area where they display bowls on the wall, and the countertop of the bar is covered with ramen! Genius. { ORDER } * Special item on the menu - Tsuke Soba (served only for a limited time) - cold ramen noodles with a bowl of dark soup with spinach, boiled eg, chashu pork. If you're Vietnamese, it reminds me of eating thit kho (braised pork). * Akamaru Modern Ramen set with a side of extra pork AND extra egg! (wasn't enough for the BF...he had to order more pork and eggs) and grilled eel over rice. { SERVICE } Our waitress was super helpful and friendly. This was the best service we have ever had at a Japanese restaurant. If you're with a party of 3 or less, they may seat you at one of the long benches so you'd be enjoying your meal with strangers. But that's okay too because 99.9% of the time, you will be so absorbed in enjoying your meal anyways. The wait was about 30 minutes, but they seated us within 10 minutes because there was only 2 of us. We had to sit at one of the long benches, but we didn't mind at all. It was actually a lot of food! Based on the reviews, I wanted to try the pork buns but the BF stopped me from ordering. :( next time I guess! Gives us a good reason to visit the city soon!

I was doubtful. I've had $1 ramen you buy in supermarkets and you heat up in your microwave and comes with the little packets of seasoning/grease/salt. I've had $9 ramen that was good, but kind of salty and in the end I still felt like I was eating ramen. $14 ramen? How good could it be? Without even tasting the ramen, I was already impressed by the ramen Êbowl that was size of my face. It came with a equally large soup spoon to match. The key to great ramen is the soup. So I tentatively took a small sip. The flavors just exploded in my mouth! It was savory with just right amount of salt. The pork was moist and also perfectly seasoned. All my previous doubts were washed away with each additional bite of the perfectly chewy noodles and soup. If you are waiting, you can get a head start on your meal by getting drinks and appetizers at the bar. We had the edamame that was served with a side of citrus salt. The salt was delicious was probably the best part. I like the chic decor, but the music and noise volume was high. Wouldn't have minded if the overall volume was turned down a few notches. The staff is really friendly and accommodating even when they're so busy. I never felt rushed or ignored. I guess I've joined the hype. This place is definitely special.

After growing up on Sapporo Ichiban Ramen on a daily basis made by my late grandmother, I'm pleased to say I've found a rather high-priced spicier version to bring me back to those days. Chopsticks were optional then and so was the watered down thinly sliced kimchi she so lovingly dipped in water so I could handle the heat. Ê Which explains my addictive tastes to anything with noodles with a hit of spiciness. In comes the Special Spicy Ramen. Love, pork and sodium in a steaming bowl. Would I wait two hours for this? Hail no. Luckily, we had a friend's birthday dinner here and some pretty sweet friends decided to hold a table for us two hours before dinner. We also ordered pork buns for everyone and I was pleasantly surprised at how good they were. Pork was juicy and deliciously fatty. They also put in a layer of mayonnaise in the bun, just in case you forgot you were eating pig fat. I hear the raves all the time about these things, but, nothing will come close to my Momofuku pork buns. We're bffs. After the porky broth and strands of noodles hit your system, you'll forget that your white server was speaking to you in Japanese. Food this good shouldn't make you wait this long, but this is New York so I'll let them slide.

I've been hearing about Ippudo for a long time and figured it was time to make the trip. ÊI went on a Monday at about 7 and the wait was about 15 minutes. ÊNot bad. Ê I ordered the pork buns and the Akamaru Modern. ÊThe pork buns were diviine. ÊThey had excellent flavor and the bun itself (not sure what that's called) was so soft, it basically just melts in your mouth. ÊI could've eaten about 10 of them, but unfortunately it only comes with 2. The Akamaru Modern was phenomenal. ÊI ordered it with the recommneded toppings- the pork belly and egg. ÊThe broth had a really nice pork flavor, the scallions were so fresh and the pork belly was perfect. The egg gave it a really creamy finish, which was nice. ÊAnd usually, the noodles are my least favorite part of ramen (kinda strange, I know), but these noodles were fantastic. ÊI ate until I literally could not fit anything else in my stomach. ÊI was still full in the morning. I am docking one star because it's probably the most expensive ramen I've ever had- $75 for two people (including tip) is a little crazy. ÊAnd it's also very loud inside the restaurant. ÊThe waiters yell things out every now and then together in unison. ÊIt's kind of strange and a little distracting. ÊOverall though, this was a fantastic meal. ÊHighly recommended.

Although a bit on the pricey side, the ramen here has great flavor. ÊYou can choose from many different varieties of broth and noodles. ÊI've tried a couple different ones and all have not disappointed me. ÊThe wait staff is friendly and helpful with any questions you may have. The decor and atmosphere is NYC chic, and provides for an interesting dining experience. ÊJust beware, at peak hours the wait is at least an hour long, but be patient because it's worth a try!

I was visiting NYC and my friend decided to bring us to Ippudo for lunch on Sunday. Since I read multiple yelp reviews beforehand, I knew we were going to have to wait for a looooonggggggggg time. We put our name down, walked around the neighborhood and finally found a waiting spot inside the restaurant. Good thing we decided to wait inside instead of standing outside because the hostess did not go out to announce the opening of a table. She just announced it from the stand and if your party couldn't hear her call your name, then I guess it's your lost. We all ordered the Akamaru Modern Ramen. The broth was incredibly flavorful, the noodles were done just right and the pork was melt in your mouth delicious! Definitely worth the hour wait! Tip: For all your garlic lovers out there, remember to ask for extra garlic. They give you fresh cloves and a garlic press so that you can put as much as you want in your ramen.

I hate this place. This is one of those places where the atmosphere totally ruins it for me. I usually find it annoying when people complain about food not being "authentic" (that's not really a negative by itself; it just means it's a different/new category of food) but I'm sorry, ramen is cheap drunk food. I shouldn't have to wait an hour in a pretentious nightclub atmosphere for the privilege of buying a $15 bowl. It doesn't help that the hostesses are all the snotty, bored-looking type, who never seem to do anything but ignore customers despite the fact that there always seems to be at three of them. Thankfully, once you're actually seated, the staff is your typical friendly, polite, boisterous type, through your tolerance may vary on suffering skinny white dudes shouting "Irrasyaimase." Admittedly, the ramen is pretty good here, if overrated. I prefer a slightly thicker, chewier noodle, and thin pork slices rather than the big chunks they use here, but that's just personal preference. The broth is generally pretty good. The main "modern" or "classic" ramen flavors seem to be the way to go here; I tried the shoyu duck once and found it thoroughly plain and unimpressive. I grudgingly admit that the steamed pork buns are among the most delicious things I've ever eaten in my life. Worth dealing with all the annoyances that comes with eating here, at least occasionally. All in all though, I'd rather go to the at-least-as-good Kambi for my ramen fix.

Everyone's been raving about this place and I've been so stuck on Momofuku that I hadn't tried it. Finally my friend convinced me we had to do it. We went and put our name down and had a 1 1/2 hour wait. We went around the corner for a drink and then came back an hour later. They told us we were the next table to be seated and we were, so I was happy we didn't have to wait much longer. I was a little turned off that they didn't have veggie ramen on the menu and it was just to be ordered on request. I decided to have the ÊJapanese cucumber mixed with sesame oil dressing which I loved. It was just so up my alley and delicious. Loved the presentation. I then had the veggie ramen without mushrooms. They told me when they brought it to me that it had a lot of wasabi in it. I had never had wasabi before, at least I don't think so and yet I enjoyed it. My friend got the chicken buns and one of the meat ramens and liked it. We both liked it but definitely felt like we were betraying Momofuku. The next day I woke up with a horrific allergic reaction - I'm thinking it was to the wasabi. Not good.

Omg I love this place! ÊGo for lunch and you might not have to wait for 2 hours. ÊThat's what we did and waited only 10 minutes! Ê When you think about getting ramen at a restaurant, you don't exactly think hip, swanky, and modern. ÊAt least I don't! ÊSo you can imagine how pleasantly surprised I was when I entered Ippudo and saw an artsy fartsy display of bowls on the wall and the chic decor of the restaurant! ÊWhat a nice place for just a bunch of soup noodles! Ê I got the Akamuru Modern because it has pork belly- my FAV! ÊThe soup was delicious and perfectly seasoned and the pork belly!! mMMMM!

The bar has just been raised on Ramen in NYC by Ippudo, for a number of reasons: noodles, ambiance, service, and decor are better than all the other competitors, with particular regard to the last three points. Entering the vestibular front bar area, you are immediately and pleasantly enveloped in a subtly cool scene that hints at this spots overarching aim (or so I thought), which is to be both ramen bar and cool place. The bar itself has a glass countertop, and below it little packets of dried ramen noodles. Cute. The hostess let me know it'd be 45 mins - JUST FOR ME - to eat. The blogniscenti ruin everything these days. Inside the main dining area, they've got a whole lot more modern pizzaz than other ramen spots. It's funky in decor, and has that Japanese attention to detail. There's a sort of wooden bamiyan tree whose little wooden branches spread out dendritically across the whole ceiling. It's really cool and unique like that. The tables are laid out rather whimsically - there's a round one, a bar with several stools facing an open kitchen, booths on the opposite wall, and another bar type of area. It's sort of chaotic order or haphazard OCD. But it works. The food I tried was really stellar - a deep fried shrimp appetizer with a sweet mayo sauce was great. Simple, hot, and delish, and, counterbalanced by some slivers of pickled bell pepper. the ramen itself - I tried the modern special - was awesome. the broth was extremely rich in flavor, but not overly thick. The noodles are more spaghetti style than instant ramen style, but still very soft and supple. It was all topped with fatty and rich cut of very excellent quality pork. This is a simple, hearty take on the dish, but a fully satisfying one. I'll take 5 good ingredients in balance and prepared well over 10 in a melee in the bowl anyday, and I got that here. The staff were basically all Japanese (I may have been the only white person eating in the place at the time too), and exceedingly welcoming and friendly. They ham it up and holler at each other much like the staff at Bond St. This is sure to be a winning fixture in the Japanese & Ramen crazy east village.

Was the food delicious...?

A bit much for a ramen spot, don't you think? But don't get me wrong, i did thoroughly enjoy every morsel of food that touched my tastebuds and slid to the back of my throat into my tummy! i was very surprised that even their salad was so tastey! But let's get to the ramen.. broth, noodles, toppings.... everything was on point... exactly on point! Nothing left to be said but that this is one freaken good ramen joint!

By far my FAV ramen in the city. I grew up eating ramen like most asians...***Flashback 20 years or so (DAMN WTF...it's okay Ippudo is worth proclaiming my seasoned age) when I was off from school and my mom and dad would head off to work, I placed around 3 cups of water on the stove, brought it to a boil, added the ramen seasoning aka MSG that came in a little silver packet, put in the freeze dried noodles, waited a few minutes for the noodles to cook, cracked an egg and let it cook for a few seconds, and enjoyed. I thought I was a flippin chef at a young age. ÊHow does this archaic story relate to my experiences at Ippudo you say? Eating there brings me back to the good ol days...where the food is carefully prepared (better ingredients than my ramen of course) and slurping your soup is a must. ÊI'm just going to say it...Ippudo you have a special place in my heart. Be sure to put your name down as soon as humanly possible even if your "asian time" party isn't all there cuz this place gets PACKED during busy hours. ÊBut, if you have time to kill or just don't give a rat's a$$ you can walk in, put your name down, and have a few tasty beers by the bar which is located in front of the reception desk. I was lucky once when I went mid week around 9 PM and waited maybe 5 minutes for a table. ÊFor parties of 2, sitting at the bar may get you seated a bit quicker. ÊI personally think sitting at the bar is interesting as you get to see how the food is prepared and served. ÊI couldn't stop looking at the white dude preparing the ramen! Sorry, token white dude chef. It was the ramen I was staring at. Order the shishito peppers and pork buns for apps! I guarantee you won't be disappointed. ÊI also usually order tonkatsu base ramen...can't go wrong with that...ever. Ê The price is reasonable. There are cheaper ramen places but I think Ippudo is totally worth the few extra dollars. Ohhh...writing this review is making me think of my next visit. ÊPerhaps next week :)

I would have given Ippudo a 5, but their 2 hour wait is no joke. When the rude, ugly hostess told us their wait was 1 hour 45 min, I thought she was kidding around with us. But we quickly realized that we needed to get comfy cause there was a long wait. We had their 1. pork buns- REALLY GOOD, but momofuku's was better 2. ramen salad- interesting, it had pieces of grapefruit in it. wouldn't order it again. 3. Akamaru Modern ramen- AMAZING (Minca's is comparable). It was very porky, garlicy, and brothy. LOVED IT! it had a good amount of pork belly pieces, you can add more if you need. Another thing I really liked was that you can order more noodles for an extra $2 if you need it. Personally, I was stuffed and didn't need anymore. I wouldn't wait for 2 hours to eat Ippudo again! Maybe if it was 20 minutes.

I hate to be a Debbie-downer, but.... 1. 2 hour wait for soup and noodles? Ok, this is NY. 2. $12 Ramen Mango Salad the size of a small side salad? Yes it was delicious, but was expecting a little bigger portion. 3. $8 Chicken with a secret hot sauce? HOT! Absolutely amazing, but again, something more than like 6 nugget sized pieces makes it almost an appetizer 4. Not vegetarian or Rob-allergy friendly. ÊLeave your vegan friends out of this dining dash Is it really worth the hype? I didn't think so. ÊSure we all survived on Ramen at least in one point of our lives. ÊBut I survived just nicely making my own concoctions. The decor was a worthy attribute. ÊI so wanted to start climbing the pressure treated wood facade in front while waiting the 1-hour, then 15-minutes, then 30-minutes, then another 15-minutes, then another hour....be realistic with your seating times for godsakes! And another note, skip the dessert. ÊObviously not their forte.

Alright - apparently Ippudo is a super ramen place and I like ramen noodles a lot. So when Chun (yeah, I'm putting you in this review bub) suggested to come here for a quick dinner I was all kinds of OK with it. Now, it is important to reiterate that I do not eat any moo or oink. I noticed on the menu on menu pages that all the ramen had oink in it, but then I also noticed that the base broth was a chicken stock. So I figured I'd just ask them not to add the pork and I'll be golden. Apparently that is not the case. They simmer the marrow bones of the piggie in the chicken broth. Now why isn't this mentioned on the ingredient list on the menu? Who knows. However, this effectively quashed any ramen noodle soup eating on my end. Chun looked suitably contrite. But that didn't stop him from ordering a big bowl of soup. I contented myself with a weird version of a shrimp cocktail, which was a panoply of interesting flavors. I also ordered the ramen noodle salad, which was pretty tasty. I think, for me, the hit of the evening were the chicken buns - really, really tasty. So am I coming back here? No, because I can't eat most of the stuff off the menu. No fault of Ippudo's, just my own culture. Also - I know the constant yelling out greetings and farewells in loud Japanese is what they do here, but the constant yelling is a major turn off. Give me a quiet little noodle shop on St. Mark's place any day.

I finally made it out to Ippudo! ÊI love the attentive and courteous service. ÊMy bf had studied abroad in Japan for a semester, and he said the loud greetings are very representative of the Ramen Houses in Japan. ÊWoohoo. ÊWe were definitely in for a treat, especially since my younger brother has been raving about ramen at Ippudo! Highlights of the meal included Grapefruit Sochu (which had light alcohol & fresh grapefrult flavor), Tako Wasabi (raw baby octopus appetizer with wasabi), and Shiromaru Ramen. ÊAll of which are highly recommended and would return to re-order again. ÊBoth bf and I are big fans of lighter and natural flavors. We also ordered Karaka-Men and the Hirata Pork Buns, both of which we thought were pretty good, but had a few kinks. ÊWould have rated 4 stars but took a star off. ÊThe flavors of the Karaka-Men (ramen on the special menu) were great; however, I have to say, it was overly salted. ÊIf I were to guess, it probably had about 2 days worth of salt (that you're suppose to consume) in that one bowl alone. Ê(Bloomberg's National Salt Reduction Initiative can't come fast enough!) Ê As you guessed it, I drank about 3 additional cups of water to drink away my thirst from the salt. The Hirata Pork Buns were actually pretty good in flavor. ÊThe bun itself actually had too much sauce on it that I didn't get to enjoy the natural flavor of the pork itself. ÊI would recommend these Hirata Pork Buns if you're looking for an Americanized version. ÊI was expecting the authentic ones with the pickled veggies inside instead of iceberg lettuce, which both bf and I didn't think complimented the pork. ÊThe bun itself was very nice and fluffy. ÊKudos! Nonetheless, I can totally appreciate the fresh noodles in the ramen here at Ippudo! ÊI also like how you can peek in downstairs and see one of the workers there putting the noodles through the machine. ÊPretty sweet! Also, where else would you find 2 female bathrooms and 1 male bathroom? P.S. Bf and I went to Ippudo on a Saturday morning (after an hour of paddling in the Hudson River) and there were NO lines! ÊWe were in and out of the restaurant in under an hour. ÊExpect to spend about $20 a person to be full. ÊOne bowl of ramen will NOT fill you up.

OK. ÊThe food here is great.....i gave it three stars for one reason. ÊThat reason is there is a pretentiousness to this restaurant.

ÊI was thinking it can't be that packed....sure enough, as the hostess was walking us in, there were so many empty seats! ÊThey were few people behind us waiting for seats and i just wanted to yell out, there are plenty of seats available!

Let's not beat around the bush... Walking into Ippudo, I had very high expectations. ÊI usually try not to get my hopes up about a new place because they're almost always dashed, but given the media and buzz in the Japanese community, soaring expectations were inescapable. So it comes as great surprise that I was NOT disappointed. Before I get into details about the interior I should tell you that I grew up seeking the best ramen in Japan in sweaty pint-sized shops wedged under a subway with a fine patina of grease covering everything. Entering the temperature controlled cavernous interior of Ippudo I was transported... not to Tokyo as you might expect, but to one of those night-time establishments in Meatpacking. This isn't a sin in-and-of itself, but experience has shown that flashy interiors have an inverse correlation with quality of food. Although the wait looked intimidating, the interior quickly swallowed up the line and I was sitting at an impressive whole-tree-stump communal table in a few minutes. From their two main offerings I chose the Shiromaru Classic which is their signature tonkotsu stock (white creamy stock made from pork bones). Though the place was packed, my bowl showed up hot and steamy a few minutes later --fast efficient service by any standard. So how was the ramen? In keeping with my past ramen reviews I've split it up by importance into 3 key pieces: soup, noodles, and toppings. Soup: This is where Ippudo really shines. The 18 hours they spend cooking the bones releases a richness and depth that just can't be faked (I've heard of places using cream or even peanut butter to try and achieve this). It's incredibly mellow and well balanced having just enough toromi (thickness), without being cloying (like Minca), just enough umami without being salty (like Setagaya), and a pleasant hint of sweetness at the end. Noodles: The noodles are of the thin Hakata variety and were cooked to perfection. Briny, eggy and with just a bit of springy chew in the texture. Toppings: They really go traditional here with just 2 thin sliced of chashu (japanese char siu) a bit of cabbage, scallions, and wood ear. The quality of all the toppings was impeccable, but having gotten used to a more heavy handed approach to toppings I have to say I did want for a bit more, especially for a $13 bowl of noodles. This may be a bit of an unfair comparison, but compared to Santoka Ramen's "Toroniku", Ippudo's chashu was both unsubstantial and unremarkable. Overall, I'd have to say Ippudo is now my #1 spot for Manhattan ramen. Working two blocks from the place I'm even okay with the highish price since my pocketbook will keep my waistline from ballooning out of control. Update 4/13/2008: Okay, I've been back a few times now and the lines have gotten out of control. I love ramen, and this place makes a damn fine bowl, but 1.5 hours for lunch just ain't cool. I'd suggest either going on an off hour, or waiting until the hype dies down.

Here's the deal, i know what GOOD ramen is. I've been to japan and back. And I had HIGH expectations for this place. Since I was suppose to go here a long time ago, but the line always turns us away. So this time we went on a tuesday afternoon around..1 and waited maybe 20 mins, or less. depends on how many people you are with. We got a corner table for the 3 of us..soo spacious! I ordered the set meal/lunch that was ramen (Akamaru Modern) that comes with a salad that i didn't really eat, it was okay salad, the dressing makes it overwhelming after two bites. It also comes with a bowl of rice with eel on top. The eel was really good. The ramen was very good! It's not the noodle they use in japan but the soup was pretty good tasting. I feel like there's a lot of msg but whatever it tasted fine. Definitely Asia quality, or closest you can find with ramen these days.. the cold noodles weren't that good..but my friend enjoyed it. I will definitely return when i go to nyc again. if there isnt a 2 hour wait..

Momofuku, you just got kicked in the nuts! Your days are numbered! Finally a ramen place that has it all, looks, quality booze with great food! I never thought I would describe a ramen bar as sexy but the restaurant is that. ÊThe lighting made everyone look attractive and sophisticated, the J-pop music is sultry yet poppy w/o being obtrusive and the food. . Mmmmm, I'm smacking my lips just thinking about it. Ê Future Date write this down. . .Ippudo puts me in a mood, the hot and bothered kind of mood. Ê Ê On to the food: Yes, it's pricey for soup but hot damn! The soup is awesome! The pork is succulent, broth is amazing (creamy, rich without being fatty) and the noodles, while not as great as Setagaya's, were still pretty damn good! Ê The rice cooker spoon they give you deserves some praise too! It catches any accidental drops of noodle back into the bowl (no splash!) and holds enough broth so you don't have to dip constantly. ÊYum. I went during the soft-opening so there are a little kinks to work out; took awhile to get water, the server left our menus on our table after we ordered and it took sometime to get the check but it wouldn't deter me from returning back. Ê Ippudo welcome to NYC. ÊDon't ever leave.

Ippudo, I remember when I first came here, I was dazzled by the smoke and mirrors effect of the nice environment and the friendly staff. I remember thinking the pork buns were amazing and the ramen being pretty good. After breaking the initially spell that was cast on me from before, I went back to Ippudo with a friend for lunch the other day, and I realized a couple of things. This is a place you should check out at least once, and yes you should have the pork buns, 2 for $8. Yes, that is equivalent to 8 whopper jrs or double cheeseburger at Burger King. And the while the ramen is tasty, I had to drink all the soup just to feel a little satisfied because the amount of noodles they gave were hardly enough to fill up my hungry stomach. Most of the ramens for lunch were priced at $13, just think of the burgers you could get for that price, you could feed a family. I realized, I'm usually big on quantity more than quality, not that I like eating massive amounts of cardboard but, I just don't think the price for what you get at Ippudo is better than walking down the street to other Japanese ramen places for maybe half the price for the same amount of food, but that's just me. If you want tasty pork buns, try Mei Li Wah bakery in Chinatown for 80 cents for one. So let's do some math, 10 pork buns for 80 cents is $8. Ippudo's pork buns 2 for $8 (plus tax).... 10 is greater than 2 people... Don't get me wrong, you should try this place out, and you should spend the money at least once to try it...I won't be waiting a hour to throw away my money at this place anymore...

Okay, the broth here is delicious. ÊReally delicious, and not too oily or salty. ÊI drank the whole thing, which I normally don't do. ÊAnd the noodles were also good, really great consistency and flavor. ÊAnd the pork belly is melt in your mouth good. Ê Not so good..waiting an hour and paying like 16 dollars for my ramen. ÊSeriously? ÊIt's not really THAT good. Ê Somewhat not convenient, but not that bad..sitting at a communal table and sort of loud and random music. Ê I'll come here again, but only at a really random time where hopefully there's not a wait.

A friend recommended Ippudo to me during a visit to New York in October, 2009. ÊBest ramen I've ever had, by far! My friends and I went here during dinner on a Saturday so there was quite a wait (45 min - 1 hour) but it was well worth it. Ê First off, I love the decor of Ippudo. ÊThe wall in the waiting area is adorned with soup bowls and the glass counter at the bar cleverly encases squares of dried noodles that line the entire counter. The main dining room looks sleek and modern. ÊWe were seated at our own booth, spacious enough to seat 6 people (and probably more if necessary) which gave us a great view of the entire dining area as well as the the kitchen staff merrily cooking away. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful in offering recommendations. For starters we ordered several appetizers but the only ones that I can recall were the chicken wings and Hirata pork buns. ÊThe chicken wings were quite good but we were all blown away by the pork buns. ÊIn my opinion, I think the pork buns at Ippudo are better than Momofuku. I am going to echo the reviews of many other yelpers and say that the pork buns were just heavenly. ÊThe consistency of the buns were light and fluffy. The was pork was so soft and succulent that it just melted in your mouth. ÊCombined with their tasty sauce, it's positively orgasmic for your palate! Our table got a mix of different ramen but the most popular choices were the Akamaru Modern and the Shoyu Ramen. ÊI ordered the Akamaru Modern and it was absolutely THE.MOST.DIVINE bowl of ramen that I've ever had! I cannot emphasize this enough...it is one of those meals that tastes so good you're gonna say OMG. The noodles were cooked perfectly - not too soft and not overcooked. ÊAnd the broth was so full of flavor without being overwhelmingly salty. It was a bowl of absolute ramen heaven. ÊI had a taste of the Shoyu Ramen which my boyfriend ordered. I think the shoyu has a saltier flavor but it was still just as tasty as the Akamaru Modern. "Eating ramen will guarantee to make you happy" Ê- this is no lie, particularly here at Ippudo. Writing this review just made me wish I was back in New York. Average price per person: $20-30 depending on whether you order multiple orders of the pork buns (which we did). Well worth it!

Noodle soups are my weakness. And Tonkatsu broth ramens are my special weakness. So, Ippudo opening in NYC shortly before my trip was serendipitous. It was like the Food Gods calling out to me: "WE BROUGHT YOU IPPUDO, EAT IT NOW!" Obviously, I was willing to brave 2 hour wait times (as warned by my advance scout, Mr. Tomita). I even planned for it: leave my name, wander around the Village, and come back just in time for a bowl of tasty ramen. ÊAnd well, I left Ippudo thoroughly annoyed. There was actually only a 40 minute wait, and when we wandered back 45 minutes later, our table was ready. I think the gave away our original seats, but sat us immediately anyhow. The waitress pulled out the seats for us too, how nice. Sleek, modern decor in black, red, and white. Wide open view of the kitchen. Port holes into the rooms downstairs where you can see them prepping ingredients and making fresh noodles. Seats at the bar, on long communal tables, or in booths. The menu is pretty simple, not a lot of options, but everything looks interesting. ÊWe each ordered the #1 Shiromaru ramen, and I got the Braised Pork Belly for a starter too. The Braised Pork Belly is solid. Tasty with layers of fat (it's pork belly, what do you expect?), served pretty. Looks like the Chicken Karaage is the more popular choice, but it didn't look as appetizing to me from across the table. And the Shiromaru? Yes, their special broth is the porkiest pork broth ever. Delicious, I loved it, I could drink it forever. No arguments. But shit, at $13 a bowl, I expected thicker and more plentiful slices of pork belly. I expected bamboo sticks, more toppings*, anything, just MORE. But not so much. The ramen itself was unmemorable. Not bad, but not great either. Ok, the food was pretty damn good, just way too expensive for what it is. I'm pretty happy from the yummy goodness. ÊSo why did I leave so annoyed? After we finished our food, the waitress cleared away our bowls and NEVER CAME BACK!! After spending 20 minutes waiting, chatting, and trying to make eye contact with any server, we flagged down a runner to ask for the check. After that, it took another 10 minutes for somebody to pick it up, even though I stood the damn thing on the table in front of me with my credit card sticking out the top. I believe they'd closed for the afternoon, but there were plenty of other diners, some just ordering when we finished. At the prices Ippudo charges, I expect better service. Fuck, I expect better in general. I'm sure I'll be back. I just can't help myself. The broth is that good. Besides, I think the waitress figured out her goof at the end, since she kinda apologized. In sum, Ippudo is hugely over priced, slightly over hyped, and quite possibly not worth the trouble. Feeling generous here with four stars. Does the Mitsuwa in NJ have a Santouka? Because I'd much rather save myself $5-6 and eat there instead. * Apparently toppings are extra like at some ramen shops, but seriously, $13 and you want me to pay extra for toppings? Shit.

BEST RAMEN! A lot of hype is what surrounded this place. I expected great things, for Ippudo was the equivalent of a Casey Kasem #1 America's Top40 colossal giant that stayed at #1 for 20 weeks in a row, except the Yelp version. Did I just allude to Casey Kasem? Shit I'm old. I digress.... Did it live up to my expectations? Read on... To give you an idea, on a Monday, it was roughly a 15min wait at 7:30pm for a party of 3 to 4. You get to use plastic Ippudo decorated hand fans while you wait. red paper on one side, white paper on the other. Not bad. Maybe people don't want to eat hot foods in the Summertime. Maybe not. Who cares. I'm in there like swimwear! Upon entry I notice a stairwell going downstairs. Assumed correctly that that's where the prep room and bathrooms are. ÊStraight ahead are the hostesses which take your name down Êand lets you know the wait time.There were 2 when I went. If you can get by Fort Knox, to the right is the bar area seating and further back is the open kitchen. Right away I observed that there are 4 forms of seating: communal tables, dining tables, bar seating, and booths. The empty spaces between tables are adorned by 1 1/2" wide thin bamboo strips tied together and further elongated, blossoming into what appeared to be a ginormous (I hate that word) bloomin' onion at Outback Steakhouse, only it was tied together by red rope and had some random red painted bamboo sticks scattered about the onion. Someone tell me what kind of symbolism this represents please. -Kitaba Pork Buns ($8) - the choice btwn pork and chicken was a no brainer for me. It was served on a hot ceramic rectangular dish with two rectangular holes on each side. Allow me to demystify all these misconceptions I have been reading on Yelp: *THE BUN - M&I: mantou bun, i don't think one is bigger than the other (tie) *THE PORK - M: thick piece of berkshire fatty pork, so fat that the fat melts in your mouth I: berkshire not as fatty, thinner and smaller pieces, left me wondering where the pork was half the time *THE FLAVOR - M: very clean, no frills I: packed with flavor *THE SAUCE - M: there is none so they advise you to add Sriracha, if you are a purist, this is for you. I: very tasty and perfectly spicy. *THE PRICE - M: $10 I: $8 Verdict: Momofuku wins! (Ippudo skimps on pork..BOO!) -Pork Ramen Original - Akamaru Shin - Aji ($13) [new recipe, ramen noodles, thicker pork broth, berkshire pork chashu, cabbage, scallions] - they had me at thicker pork broth (and garlic oil, which is not mentioned in menupages btw). Served in a huge cavernous red clay colored concave bowl. You get a HUGE plastic white ladle (yes ladle, not spoon) and a ladle rest to drink your soup. I noticed a small blob of red in the center of my ramen upon receiving it. It tasted like half bean paste, half yuzu. *THE NOODLES - Now this lived up to the hype and there was plenty of it. Served al dente. I could taste flour in the aftertaste of the ramen. Don't know if that's good or bad, but I'm assuming that's a sign of freshness. Not a ramen freak but I know quality when I taste it. THIS WAS QUALITY RAMEN! *THE MEAT/VEGGIES - 2 super thin pieces of berkshire pork belly (virtually non existent), some cabbage, some ground pork. MINUS ONE STAR..FOR $13, GIMME A BREAK! *THE BROTH - cloudy brown color, super rich, super thick, super flavorful, super good! I drank all of it! Note: +3 (Niku-Iri) for more pork chashu topping +2 (Kae-Dama) for more noodles Decor: dim, lots of wood, I almost felt like I was whisked away to a log cabin in the Catskills (with a brownout) Service: Very good, inobtrusive, courteous, polite Choice between 3/4 sleeve black T or short sleeve white T..$30/ea. I opt for the black. Cash only for the Ts please. Must go back to try the Matcha Brulee! Total came out to $26/pp w/ everything (1 order of buns, 1 order of ramen)

My ramen experience before Ippudo: just-add-water packaged kung-fu ramen and watching my beloved characters in anime scarf it down. ÊThanks to Ippudo, a whole new world has been opened. ÊI got the Akamaru Modern. ÊA ramen noodle soup that is both light and flavorful with subtle veggies and berkshire pork. ÊFor appetizers, I got the "holy fraking pig" pork buns. ÊI have erotic dreams about this meal. The service? greater than 5 stars. ÊYou are greeted courteously by the hostess. ÊAs you are being seated, the kitchen gives you a rowdy cheer as if you just won the Superbowl. ÊThis is how one should be welcomed. ÊOur waitress explained the menu items to us noobs and was very attentive. ÊIppudo Ny cleanliness is also greater than 5 stars. ÊI would lick the table if some of my soup happened to drip. Itadakimasu!

Ninety minutes after I put my name down for a table on a gorgeous Thursday evening, I cannot help but beam with a sense of pride the very moment Êthe hostess called my name. It is similar to the joy you experience when crossing the finish line of a race. As we were led to our seats, the anticipation for what I was about to experience was like a LOST fan eagerly awaiting the season finale episode to start after a 90-minute retrospective. On the other hand, ninety minutes was sufficient time to exhaust every topic of conversation there is between my dinner companion and myself. By the time we sat down, other than consulting each other on options in the menu, there was nothing left in the tank. I was filled in on everything that had happened to her in the past year and vice versa. Dinner was rather quiet - much like a date that was not going well. All this just during the wait to be seated. I can now appreciate why the wait was hyped as much as the food! Epilogue: At this point, the hype and number of Yelp reviews are enough to get someone to try Ippudo at least once. Choices and preferences have been documented well over a thousand times. Therefore, there is nothing groundbreaking to note except: The Japanese prefers to visit restaurants that serve authentic Japanese (style) cuisine. On the night of my visit, it was surprising yet not shocking to see that the clientele was almost 100% Japanese-free....

You will get to know those many bowls hung on the wall very well since you will most likely be spending a healthy amount of time in the waiting area. White people will speak to you in Japanese as you are led to your coveted table. You will rationalize spending $15 on ramen. I was in deep soupy love with my Kogashi Miso Ramen-- infinitely rich broth made with charred miso and perfect chewy noodles. Ippudo is worth it, really. The $15, the wait, the awkward 'Arigatos'... so worth it.

First of all, the Shoyu ramen was quite good, as was the chicken, the crab appetizers and the sake. ÊThe broth was not at all salty and the noodles were just tender enough. ÊThe space is very nice with beautiful decor and really nice servers. ÊI enjoyed my meal here, especially after waiting almost 2 hours for a table. ÊThe prices are doable, but a little much for the portions, I thought. Under any other circumstances, I would give this place 4 stars. ÊBut the fact that they don't take reservations and the wait time fluctuates from 1.5 hours to 30 minutes back to 45 minutes, well, Ippudo, you don't impress me that much. ÊTrue, I am having a ramen craving, and true, Ippudo is the only place I can think of that will satisfy my craving, but I can't stand people who can't get over themselves. ÊAlas, restaurants can get away with being like this in New York City, so I don't see a change coming any time soon. Like Ippudo is the Studio 54 of ramen. ÊAs if. ÊI didn't see no Bianca Jagger riding around on a white horse.

After perusing some NYC reviews, I figure I should try out the ramen comfort food noodle craze during my weekend trip to the city. ÊI found this specific restaurant based on MiRIAM W's reviews - I had to try it out. My dinner party and I ordered each of the ramen noodles offered. ÊMy classic was tasty with fresh ramen noodles and AMAZINGLY salty wonderful pork slices. ÊI wish they gave me more than two slices. ÊI don't remember what exactly they're called, but the third one on the menu was extremely flavorful red broth and wonderful. ÊThe other one was good too, but it was too spicy for my personal taste. ÊMy table also ordered some pork buns with sweet spicy hoisin sauce blend that made their pork slices spice sweet in addition to its salty wonderfulness. My Manhattanite dinner party were extremely impressed with this place so it's gotta be good. ÊI found it delicious

Ippudo finally got my business. I know they've been eagerly awaiting my $13 + $3 for braised pork belly for a long time. I apologize that it took so long, but the wait and the timing just hasn't been right for a while. So my time finally came. I made my journey over to Ippudo on a Saturday. It was the first real day of autumn - you know the real autumn where a light jacket makes you just a tiny bit cold, but it's a nice, comfortable cold. Basically, it was the perfect day for a bowl of delicious ramen. We showed up just before 5pm, in time for the daily ceremonial 5pm opening where the nice ramen man hangs the "OPEN" sign right over the window. Thanks to kristine r.'s (note the lowercase k) recommendation, I got the Akamura ramen with pork. Unlike her, though, I had no qualms lifting the bowl to my mouth, so I devoured every last drop of that soup. The noodles were a perfect texture and the medley of various meats swirled into the heavenly broth absolutely melts in your mouth. Perhaps this next bit will show just how gluttonous I am. My biggest complaint is that I was nowhere near full after I finished my bowl of ramen. Neither were my dinner companions, so we ordered one order of pork buns, one order of chicken buns (4 buns in total). They were delicious!! A little too much sauce, but, to me, that's better than the opposite problem. I liked the pork one better, but I definitely have a bias towards pork. Either way, both were delicious. I really can't give the 5 star rating yet. Perhaps when I start craving it more, I'll give Ippudo the final star. For now, I don't appreciate the strategic timing that has to go into dining there. And, the price of the bowl really should have left me full, not searching for more food. Either way, this is possibly the best bowl of ramen you'll find in NY, so the time and money is what you'll have to give into the experience.

Ippudo is sooo yummy. I come back again and again and I love it. My first time was with a coworker who brought his sister visiting from Spain, who was awed by the staff's energy. It's a cool joint to take someone new to the city to, for the bustling chefs and interesting interior decor. The wait's usually the shortest during the summer, when no one wants to eat something that'll make them even hotter, but it's worth the wait during the fall beacuse it'll definitely warm you up better than a cup of Campbell's soup. The Akamaru Modern is my favorite. It may seem like $13 is a lot to pay for a bowl of ramen but it is the best made ramen you'll ever have. The noodles are fresh and the broth is perfect - not too salty, rich with pork flavor, and the Akamaru sauce gives it a kick. I've tried the Shiomaru which is also good, but I keep coming back. The appetizers are pretty delish (ie the steamed pork buns, braised pork belly), but the noodles are the reason to go. Mmmmm....

Rather than reiterate what's been said in the thousands of posts before me, I'd rather contest a review by Lissa B (1 star). ÊWhen I look up restaurants on yelp, I typically will search for the worst reviews and see what was wrong with their experience as a gauge for what kind of disasters might arise with mine. "I lived in Japan and used to go to Ippudo at least once a week as I lived down the street from the Waseda location... The whole Ippudo experience was amazing in the cozy restaurants in Tokyo. The Ippudo location in New York is a sad contrast. ÊThe restaurant does not have the charm and coziness." I do agree that the restaurant lacks a coziness touch to it. ÊMore so at the bar where you wait with the other hordes of patrons who will be sat in the coming hours. ÊYET, once in the dining room I found the tables to be comfortable and conducive to an amicable experience. "The staff is rude, mean, and impersonal. ÊI was so excited to go to Ippudo in New York after eating there 50 times or so in Tokyo." My visit was a stark contrast to this. ÊI found the hostess (despite having to deal with a mob of 200 people at 1pm) accommodating each time we asked her 'how much longer?' ÊAlso our server devised a complex series of arrival times for our dishes to make a pleasant dining experience. "I had really, really missed my favorite ramen restaurant and I couldn't wait to have some akamaru ramen and gyouza. ÊWhat a disappointment. ÊFirst, there is no gyouza. ÊIppudo is famous for the gyouza. ÊIt's the best gyouza I had in all of Japan. ÊHow could they not have the most amazing gyouza?!" Why would you want gyouza when everything else is so good?? You'd rather eat the same thing over and over and over and... "Luckily, the ramen is the same. ÊToo bad the price is DOUBLE! ÊI can live with that though, as most imports do double the price. ÊSo, fine." Eh, it's New York. ÊRestaurants with a 'name' get this privilege. ÊGlad to hear I'm getting the real thing! "But the service... it's just terrible. ÊIt is nothing compared to the nice and homey service in Tokyo. ÊI have had a worse and worse experience every time I went to Ippudo in New York, about 6 times total. ÊThe most recent time will be my last until I return to Tokyo. ÊI had some mochi with me and after I finished the yummy ramen, I wanted to eat a mochi to complete my experience. ÊOne of the waiters saw me eat the mochi and asked me to leave since no outside food is allowed in. ÊI was humiliated in a place that I considered so special, and well, I'm not going back." Something must've been pretty good if you went back 5 times despite terrible service on all these trips. ÊThe tenacity to wait that long for food to only be treated poorly, is a feat. ÊOr it's a sign of an abusive relationship.

The Ramen is good for American standards, but still doesn't match up to Japan Ippudo, from what I've gathered, is a chain of ramen restaurants throughout Japan with one location in New York. ÊAfter living in Japan, I can't say I've ever seen an Ippudo franchise in Tokyo, but with literally thousands upon thousands of competing ramen restaurants in the greater Tokyo metro area, it doesn't seem all that surprising. Ê My first impression is that this is easily the fanciest ramen restaurant I've ever seen in my life. ÊSomewhat ironic considering that ramen is truly the working man's food in Japan and one of the most affordable at that. That brings me to price. ÊAt $13, this is not exactly cheap eats in either New York or Tokyo. ÊSo, considering the price, I really tried to judge it accordingly. Ê To me, a bowl of ramen needs three factors to make it excellent: 1) a broth so delicious you want to drink it on its own, 2) "chashu" pork that's flavorful and delicate enough to literally fall apart in your mouth without chewing, and 3) noodles that are homemade with a good texture to balance out the other two components. ÊSimply put, I didn't find that Ippudo did any of those things truly well. ÊThe "tonkotsu" (pork-bone) broth wasn't really remarkable, the chashu pork wasn't flavorful or tender enough, and the noodles seemed too soft. ÊWere they store bought? Ê Additionally, I noticed staple ramen condiments like white pepper and chili oil missing from the table. Ê If I was in New York, and really hard up for a bowl of ramen, I might come here again. ÊI would really have to think about it first though. ÊIs it better to imagine dishes as they should taste or to simply eat them knowing they could be much better?

I think I had Ippudo hyped up for me just a little too much, and though it was quite, quite good, and easily the best I've had in New York, I was disappointed that it didn't make me weak in the knees. ÊI think my problem is that I'm in love with a ramen place back home that I can no longer have (Ramen Nippon in Reseda, CA) and I'm dating other ramen places here but can't really get into it. Three of us arrived at 5 PM on a Sunday and were seated rather promptly. ÊTables seem to be heavily communal, and the waitress tried at first to seat all three of us on one side of a long table. ÊI requested that we sit across from each other, and she accommodated us without complaint. The vibe is very trendy, with dim lighting and dark decor featuring plenty of black and red with tables looking cool in light wood. ÊSome wall decorations of crumpled patterned fabric threatened to give me an OCD aneurysm, but I'm just weird. ÊThe kitchen is open to view, with a bar lining the divider. ÊThe bowls are lovely, as are the wide spoons you use to shovel your food. Service is fast and generally unnoteworthy except for one thing - man, there are some shrill voices throwing down in that space, and you're kind of captive to the piercing nasal exclamations of "Arigatou gozaimaaaaasu!" We ordered two appetizers - pork buns and oden. ÊThe pork buns were over-mayoed, but otherwise quite tasty. ÊThe white buns were soft, warm, and moist, just spot on, and the pork was juicy and stunningly flavorful. ÊOden was okay but nothing special, and the broth left a lot to be desired. ÊIt was salty but lacked the warm soothing taste of good dashi. I ordered the Akamaru with extra menma, and my two companions ordered the Spicy Tonkotsu, extra spicy. ÊI love a spicy soup, and my one true love is a spicy shoyu, but I actually preferred the Akamaru to the Spicy Tonkotsu. ÊBoth broths were delicious, though, with a lot of depth that came from well-thought-out combinations of ingredients that were not all based in grease. ÊThe house-made ramen was also nice - the noodles came out looking so thin that I worried they would be overcooked, but they were perfectly chewy and a little al dente, even. ÊBamboo shoots might've been cooked a half minute too long, though. ÊSome of that wonderful menma texture had been sapped before it entered my bowl. ÊPork was just okay, tender but not melt-in-your-mouth fantastic, and a little on the bland side. At $30 a person including tip, this was probably the most expensive ramen meal I've ever had. ÊWhen in New York, though, right? ÊWhile it wasn't the best ramen of my life, it was a great dinner that left me potbellied and content, and I'm almost certain I'll be back.

after trekking around Manhattan during my first day in NYC, my cousin and I decided to hit up Ippudo for dinner. It was on my list of restaurants to try, and since we were close by, we decided to go. while waiting at the bar for our table, we chugged down a few glasses of water (on this particular day, it was 100+ and humid). i enjoyed looking at the dry blocks of ramen decorating the bar space, and also the ramen bowls attached to the wall behind the bar. interesting, cool, fun decor. after being seated at our table, i kept looking around at the decor. i loved the chic, simplistic, asian influenced decorations. if you're not sitting on the booth, their chairs are pretty interesting - L shaped leather chairs. as for the food, it was pretty good. i had the Pork Buns and Akamaru Modern ramen. the pork buns were delish - soft and fresh bun with pork inside - the best part was the mayo tasting sauce. as for the ramen, i thought the broth and components were very, very good. However, I didn't love the ramen noodles - I don't know if it was just mine, or if they're supposed to taste that way. but they tasted kinda hard or stale. overall, Ippudo was pretty good - it wasn't mind blowing, but good. i thought it was kinda overpriced - $14 for a bowl of ramen? kinda nuts. but regardless, i was glad to have tried one of the must try places in NYC.

This place is an ABSOLUTE-MUST if you're visiting NYC!!! My friends and I were SUPER EXCITED about NYC because we had heard so many fantastic reviews about this restaurant. A word of advice: this place gets crowded quickly, and you will need to place reservations. We arrived on a Saturday afternoon, and the cashier told us we would have an 1.5 hour wait, but we were eased when they said they would give us a call 20 minutes before our table was ready. What to do from there? Take a trip to SoHo and get some shopping done! Sure enough, we did receive a call and by the time we came back to Ippudo, our table was ready. From the moment you enter in the actual dining area to the moment you leave, it's quite the experience. It's a traditional Japanese ramen house, so naturally you are greeting by the waiters when your party enters the room (they announce it to the entire room). My friends and I were seated in a nice, private corner where we were able to have a good conversation (and take a ton of pictures!). We heard great reviews about their pork buns. Something about these buns were so addicting and enticing. Think traditional buns for Chinese duck, but filled with these fatty juicy pork slices with a spicy mayo-like sauce. Our table ordered 6 of those, and gobbled them up within seconds. Next, we had our ramen. Don't order any other ramen. Just get their Akamaru Modern. Simply the best ramen I've ever had in my life. One sip of their broth and a bite of their perfectly cooked noodles is all you need to get hooked. The feeling of their ramen is simply indescribable. The broth is so rich and decadent. The noodles are light and springy. The toppings add to the dish as a whole. They have options for different toppings. I would recommend adding a poached egg, as the yolk adds a different consistency to the broth. The restaurant also has the option of Kae-dama. Basically for an extra 2 bucks, they'll add another ball of noodles to your broth, provided that you haven't wolfed it all down ;) Definitely worth the try. I swear, it was like having food orgasm after food orgasm in my mouth. With every bite of the pork bun to every sip of their broth, this place was definitely worth the trip to NYC! In summary, 1. Order Pork Buns 2. Order Akamaru Modern 3. Obtain Food-gasm! Simple, right?

Since there are so many good reviews for this ramen restaurant, I don't think that I should waste your time... ...but I will tell you that I am a fan of this restaurant because of 1. atmosphere; 2. interior design; 3. food (of course).

WARNING: I am by no means a ramen connoisseur (I don't even know how to spell "connoissuer" --thanks Yelp spellcheck). ÊWhen I was a kid I used to pour half a bottle of Sprite into my ramen, so take what I say with a grain of crazy. I came here on a Friday night at 10 PM with a party of 7; it was like we were in a who-can-score-the-longest-wait-time competition. ÊWe scored a respectable two hours. ÊTWO HOURS! ÊIn two hours your stomach goes from hunger to starvation to red alert to oh-wait-is-there-a-famine to i-guess-i'll-stop-metabolizing-to-survive to there-IS-no-stomach-outside-of-the-Matrix. The space inside the cavernous restaurant was surprisingly big and decorated in a go-big-or-go-home manner. ÊLots of big and bold flourishes and extravagant details. ÊNice. Our waiter was extremely earnest. ÊMade all seven of us go "awwww!" ÊHe explained everything in detail and was super patient with our questions. ÊI thought I was being served by a Canadian. But let's be frank --we came here for the ramen. ÊI ordered the Classic. ÊOur waiter had exlained that the Modern is spicier, with fattier pork and a heavier taste. ÊIt was 12 AM and I was stone-cold-sober; I opted for the Classic. I am going to propose that your first slurp of your bowl of Ippudo ramen is the best. ÊYou will get knocked off your feet by how flavorful the broth is, how heavy the ramen noodles feel between your dark wood chopsticks (not disposable -yay environment!), the way the savor lingers in your mouth afterwards. ÊTHAT is a five star feeling for sure. But as you continue to slurp and slide through the rest of the generous but not overwhelmingly sized bowl of noodles, you might find yourself disappointed at the lack of other "stuff" in the bowl. ÊWhy so few of those dark rubbery things? ÊOr other vegetable-based ingredients? ÊI guess a true ramen aficionado (thanks again spellcheck!) would argue that anything other than ramen and broth is just a distraction. ÊMaybe so. ÊBut I personally like nuts in my brownie, toppings on my pizza, and other culinary distractions. The major reason I'm scaling this place back to four stars is because after a few minutes at the table, I started to feel absolutely parched. ÊBut I still wanted to put the entire contents of the bowl into my stomach, so I resisted drinking any water. ÊMy friends felt the same way. ÊThe broth was so flavorful, so concentrated, that it felt like we were drinking a half-diluted paste. ÊAnd once again, I heard that decades' old voice deep within, whispering slyly in my ear, "Do you have any Sprite?"

Still amazing! ÊFriends were in town and we decided to come here for lunch since we had a massive group of 12 people. ÊWe split up into two tables and only had to wait 15-20 minutes. ÊService is quick and food is delicious. ÊI love the pork buns and the Akamaru. ÊIt's somewhat pricey for ramen, but the noodles and broth are so tasty! Ê If you come at night though - expect to wait a long time, especially for large groups. ÊOnce, we waited two hours for a table. ÊSo if you get your timing right, it will be awesome!

AWESOME!!!!!!!! (I think the amount of reviews shows) Ippudo Special Ramen = AWESOME! Hirata Pork Buns = AWESOME!- I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH HOW GOOD THOSE WERE! TRY THEM I BEG YOU! LOL! Tako WasabiI = AWESOME! Wait for a Table? = Not so awesome but the Food TOTALLY MAKES UP FOR IT. So get there early and walk around while you wait. I got to sit at the bar and watch the Chefs cook everything in front of me and i think they're the BEST seats in the restaurant. You get to see how much time and the art that is put into and every dish. They announce you and your party when you walk into the dining area and all the staff or chefs greet you. The service I had here was quick and great. This is one place that I wont forget to visit next time im in New York.

I came here too many times because every visitor wants to try this place. ÊI'd like to just quote what my Japanese friends concluded about their ramen: Too greasy and thick. It's good, only because they never cared to take out much grease from pork fat and that takes work. Love the pork buns though! Better than momofuku's.

This place is incredible, and if you don't go here it's your loss. I'm mostly just reviewing it so I can find it again when I'm in NY, through my Yelp page. I probably shouldn't review it because there's already long enough lines, I don't want to have to wait longer because you're all going there... but hey, as long as it stays in business, then I'm willing to wait ;)

AMAZING!! My friend and I decided to venture the city and found this place on yelp, of course. It was pretty chilly out so figured some ramen would be perfect and when we got there, they said it was an 1 hr+ wait. Since we were already there and it'd probably take us the same amount of time to find a new place and get there, we just grabbed a drink at the bar in front/waiting area (super smart placement by the way!). We were seated less than 30 minutes later so we were off to a good start! Got the Akamura Modern Ramen AND pork buns and it must be one of the best ramens I've had so far! The broth was flavorful, ramen cooked just right and the chashu pork melts in your mouth. YUMMM. I can only assume their other ramen dishes would be just as good but I'd definitely have to go back and try them. The pork buns were a little pricey ($9 for 2) but it was such a great mini food splurge! Both dishes are a must try!!!! AND THEN - the green tea creme brulee! ÊI am a huge green tea fan and so this was a must when I saw it on the menu. SO GOOOOOD. The green tea flavor was strong enough but not overpowering. The green tea gelato was a plus. Oh, and they have ninja-like waiters! Plates are taken away SUPER fast. Their waiters are nice and service is great. I think I enjoyed this place a little way too much. The overall vibe was very modern with the asian twist, very chill, young, and can get pretty loud. Lots of birthday celebrations going on and just a fun place to stop by to kick-off a friday/saturday night out. If you're ever in the area, definitely check it out!

Man oh Man If it weren't for the fact that it took an hour to get a table at 2PM on a Sunday (and here I thought we were coming at an off time) I would consider adding this to my "must visit" NYC tasty treats! That said, I was up in the city for a short weekend and had several disappointing Asian foodie outings. If it weren't for Ippudo I would have left NYC sad and not Asian-satisfied. It was a day with much eating so the portions/orders were small but we shared an order of the Soy based Ramen (the special of the day) with an extra set of noodles (since we were splitting one bowl we got the noodles at the start instead of at the end as recommended). We also got the Fried Chicken wings in Black Pepper sauce. The waiter was great! The normal order only has 3 wings, he asked if we wanted a 4th one for an extra 2 bucks. We totally did! I know, that isn't a huge deal, but so few places/people think "These people are sharing their food, there are two of them and the order has an odd number...MAYBE I should offer an extra one so they don't fight over the food..." And believe you me, we would have fought over that last wing! I've only had Ramen a few times (that weren't top ramen, naturally) and the last few times it did NOTHING for me, Ippudo changed my view on it. If you have the time to wait, it's totally worth the go. Maybe it is "americanized" or "hyped" or whatever someone who is looking for the "authentic" "hole in the wall" experience might say...whatever! The place is BEAUTIFUL on the inside, the food is yummy, the people are nice and the drinks looked interesting. Popular drink seemed to be some form of Lychee nut martini. No idea what it was as I rarely drink when at a restaurant, but it looked interesting. Yum Yum!

This was my first experience with real Japanese ramen and I thoroughly enjoyed it. ÊWe only had to wait 15min to get Êa table on a Friday for lunch, which was a total shocker. ÊWe were taken to a nice booth in the corner of the restaurant... Êa great view of the kitchen and dining room. We started off with the pork belly app and the pork buns. ÊThe pork buns here are not what I was used to, they have the same "design" as a pita pocket, but the pork filling was fantastical. ÊThe pork belly app was a huge hit with the table and the accompanying sauce was delicious. I went with the extra spicy tonkatsu... honestly, nothing was more perfect than that bowl of soup on a cold january day. Êgreat spice, delicious al dente noodles, really good pork flavor. the only thing that sucks is that I won't be able to eat anything like this in DC... oh well.

After hearing such a big hype about the place, we tried the place after a movie on Sunday afternoon. Luckily we got a table in 10 min without a wait and after us, the crowd flew in.. Lucky us!! Nice atmosphere and cool deco.......BUT...... BUT......I have to say that the ramens there to me was either too rich or pork-ish. I have not tried all the Ramens there yet but, the pork flavor was quite overwhelming almost like gamey. Most of us had Akamaru mordern and it was good but was not extraordinary. Comforting but not quite there comforting... and I was very thirsty later from the thick soup and the topped sauce plus more spicy sauce to mix in. I tasted my friend's Shoyu ramen and i liked it better. It is fried and curly Êthe way I would like my Ramen to be. Akamaru had straight noodle - not fried. I think it might have been better with the fried noodles. Pork belly slices were tender and juicy but still I could not bear the strong flavor. Several Appetizers were good but, forgetable even with good presentations. I found the price in this place reasonable considering the Êpopularity and the great atmosphere. Services were spot on but I am not sure if I would jump with joy if someone suggest to go there again. I prefer Sobaya.

Oh Ippudo. Why do you tease me so? With your noodle-y porky goodness (with an extra measure of pork belly to boot) you make my tummy happy and my heart want to arrest. Literally. For so little money, such happiness can be had! Zoloft has nothing on you, Ippudo. And yet, you tease, and you mock with your two hour lines and crowded bar area. Please expand, Ippudo... like what you have done to my waistline... grow! so that more of us can fit in. Until then... only 4 stars.

BEST RAMEN EVER. What the heck was Morimoto inhaling when he rated Momofuku Noodle #1 over Ippudo? I would gladly brave the 45 minute wait for a bowl of Akamaru (with extra pork belly + egg) and a pork Hirata bun. Bliss. Compared to its other ramen counterparts (Menchanko Tei, Momofuku, et al), Ippudo is far superior in ambience, decor, and most importantly, taste and flavor. Hands down, one of my favorite restaurants in NYC for its consistently excellent ramen. End point.

Japanese ramen is something that I am protective over. Kind of like a child that I've grown attached to but turns out that oh indeed, that child does have a mother and father who loves him/her more than I can. But I get bitter and frustrated because that child will never be mine. Unless I kidnap him/her. Wow, I just got real creepy. I had a great time eating at Ippudo with friends, and thought that the Shriomaru Moto-Aji was fantastic. This is the dish you must try if you ever visit this place once in your life, or that's what our waiter Luke said. He was so freaking cute that I wanted to just munch his perfect green eyes off. AND he spoke Japanese, which is ever so impressive from a white boy. Yummy. We also tried the sweet bread, or those fluffy white rolls, or whatever you may call them. They were pretty damn good as well. But yeah, the Shiromaru was pretty good and the pork was just perfectly tender. But why the loss of a star, you may ask? Although Luke himself would have been the reason for the perfect five stars, the cost was a little too much. I think Ippudo wants to the reputation of a high-class Japanese restaurant, so it got rid of the hole-in-the-wall prices and feel that so many Japanese ramen places in LA has. But it was trendy, loud and felt pretty infused with the New York spirit. I liked. Miss you, Luke.

It was a cold, rainy NY afternoon and I was craving some hot noodle soup. ÊMy friend suggested Ippudo because of it's authenticity and the interesting fact that the place is modeled after the real Ippudo in Japan. Ê I ordered the Akamaru (spicy) ramen and a friend ordered their regular ramen. ÊS'aiight. ÊI found the broth to be a little watered down for my taste, yet also, a bit salty (most likely due to the spicy paste). ÊI just wish there was a better balance in flavor. ÊPersonally, I prefer the richer, pork flavored broth and I just wasn't feeling it. ÊThe noodles are thin, squarish in shape, and cooked slightly under al dente. ÊFor the price, I was a little disappointed that we each only received 2 small slivers of pork in addition to the little sprinkling of toppings. Ê The decor is very modern and the main dining area consists of communal dining tables. ÊThe servers are very helpful in explaining their menu and service was attentive.

Okay I've changed my mind, I love Ippudo and am constantly dreaming of their savory ramen broth... Êmmm.... especially during the cold wintery months~ sadly, so is everyone else, which usually makes the wait to dine rather painful and less than desirable -- Ê3 hours of waiting = Êpass out from hunger fatigue! ÊActually, we only waited 45 minutes for our table last night, but even then I almost passed out onto the unsuspecting restaurant-goers packed like sardines into the small waiting area inside. Since my first visit about a year ago, Ippudo has definitely improved in their noodle & pork portions as well as their appetizers~ their 'eggs' however could still use a little work... I've now tried the 'half egg' in their 'special traditional '80s style ramen' three times, and all three times the eggs have been hard and overcooked at least for my likings. ps. i love the spicy pork buns!!

I think this place is so overrated. Why do New Yorkers like to jump on the food-band wagon so much without really considering the food? I think the portions here are tiny and think it's a rip-off to have to order a separate serving of noodles "on the side"--something any diner with a normal appetite would do. Don't get me wrong--the food is tasty and the ambiance/interior is better than other noodle shops, but the food is simply NOT that good. Their pork belly appetizer is very good though.

I've been to Ippudo over 50 times so I don't need to rave about how awesome their broth is, how fatty the hirata buns are, or how long I had to wait to finally sit at a communal table. ÊThis review is specifically for one dish. Yamitsuki Goma Kyuri (Japanese cucumber mixed with sesame oil dressing) - $8 WOW. ÊOn my 78th visit to Ippudo on this beautiful Sunday where I stood outside at 10:58AM waiting for this restaurant to open, I finally ordered this as my appetizer. ÊIt isn't just delicious, it is heavenly delicious! There is some excellently fine cuterly going on with this dish. ÊAside from its as seen slices, they somehow figured out a way to double slice the insides of the cucumber (or sliced on one side) so when you bite into each piece, the texture becomes diced and you realize a good amount of the sesame oil dressing has fell into every crevice very nicely, so it is extremely flavorful. ÊI die for anything sesame oil, so this dish was the death of my Sunday brunch. ÊIt is a very smart dish. ÊI love it when food is so detailed and thoughtful like this. You've done it again Ippudo. ÊLoves. It.

To each his own. I've been to many ramen houses in all of new york city but THIS is the BEST. Ramen should be about two things--the broth, and the noodles. First, the broth. The Akamaru Modern's pork broth can only come from slow and many hours of boiling pork and pork bones to get the flavor that you only get from Ippudo's ramen. They used to have a spicy version of the Akamaru Modern, but I don't know why they took it off the menu..you can still order their spicy paste on the side. I don't eat anything else here except the ramen and a few beers, the pork buns are okay and a good addition for when Im super hungry but I find that the bun gets very dry and sometimes inconsistent, one bun would have more filling than the others or would have no scallions compared to the others. Yes, there are long lines specially for dinner, but there are NO lines for lunch. You would not mind the wait in the evenings because they always have happy hour to keep you entertained.

After dining at Ippudo, I feel as if the only way to add something new to what has already been written is to write a review via a Sigmund Freudian approach. Considering both my "id" and "super ego" - it is the only way to really give fair praise and criticism to my dining experience. Without a doubt Ippudo has established themselves as "the local" for ramen consumption, as the average hour wait will attest. They did this not by chance. The ramen is certainly delicious, with salty broth, thick slabs soft slabs of pork acting as a flotation device in case of an emergency, and the noodles nice and aldente. Pork bun appetizers were flavorful enough that we ordered them before and after our ramen. Yes, pork bun desserts (better than any creme brule or tiramisu in my mind). The service is impeccable. By the end of your meal your "id" has not only kicked in, but done 360s in your bowl of soup. That all being said, my "super ego" kicks in, with the reality that all of this is in the name of ramen(!!) This is not a kobe steak. It is not foie gras. Not oysters or even clams. When you start thinking that way, you begin to question why you just waited one hour, and why you just dropped a lump sum on noodles. I can only assume that this is the real reason why diners are consistently taken by Ippudo. They do things so well, and are so precise in what they do, that they make you forget the social constructs surrounding what you are eating. Ramen turns into something delicious, and one becomes fixated on that more so than anything else. Small realities outside of the bowl become less prevalent and one can lose themselves in it, if not just for moments at a time.

FINALLY!!! I was able to try Ippudo tonight! This place is worth the hype, and maybe the wait. Luckily my date and I did not have to wait more than 15-30 minutes for a table. We waited a couple extra minutes because we wanted to sit at a table and not the counter/ramen bar. The wait staff was timely with our water and utensils. We looked over the menu and had to glance at Yelp to see what everyone recommended. ÊWe ordered the pork buns for appetizer. For entree, my date had the "modern" ramen and I had the specialty ramen which was on a seperate sheet of paper stuck in between the menu. My ramen was described as Kasane Aji - Ramen noodle in layered "tori-paitan" creamy chicken and tonkontsu soup topped with pork chashu, bean sprouts, onion, boiled egg, kikurage, scallions, yuzu, kosho with extra topping of corn and kakuni (pork belly) The flavors together was mouth watering and delicious! succulent pork belly and chashu pork mixed with the chicken creamy broth was a good mix of salty and sweet. The corn also added a little more sweet to the mix! The only thing is, to me and my date, the ramen was a little undercooked, texture was kind of like angel hair pasta ala-dente, I prefer the ramen noodles at Minca and Kambi more. I think that would make it a perfect ramen entree if it had all those combinations. For dessert, we tried the Green Tea Creme Brulee, and the Soft Tofu - So good! I'm glad i tried something different than what most people on here Yelped about. I would highly recommend you try it too next time you go! The 1+ hour wait is worth it! No, they don't let you do take out or doggy bags - Its better to eat there anyways, if you tried to take it home, im sure the noodles would be all soggy by the time you did take it home! p.s. they do not take reservations, so do not bother calling!

Whether we like to admit it or not, we love the chase (you know what I mean). After numerous failed attempts to get a seat here because no one wants to wait one to three hours for food, I finally found a friend who was willing to wait with me for a chance to eat ramen at one of the most talked about restaurants in NYC. Walking in, you'd never expect this place to be so popular but if you look closely, there are lots of little interesting items here and there. Food we ordered: Buns with chicken: slightly sweet and has a spicy kick at the end; enveloped by a soft (slightly soggy) chinese bun -- good but not addictingly good and reminds me of char siu buns you can get for dim sum in Chinatown Seared tuna: the pairing of grapefruit, avocado, a mysterious daikon-looking cube and tuna was just all wrong -- the dish was beautifully presented but the combination of slightly sour with bland and bland and slightly fishy didn't weld together into what I expected to be an interesting unexplored array of tastes but instead turned out to be bland and mushy with the grapefruit overpowering the rest of the ingredients Original/Classic ramen: I ordered the pickled veggies on the side as suggested by the menu (don't do this) and gave the pork to my friend since I don't eat pork meat. The ramen is submerged in a pork fat-based soup with 1/2 a boiled egg situated above it all. The soup has a umami-like feel to it and the ramen is chewy but overall, I would say the ramen here isn't anything extraordinary. I guess other people just overhyped it for me. The soup is comparable to something I get at Terakawa in Gramercy and the ramen itself doesn't have any special flavors or kicks to it. Do I need to wait in line for an hour to three hours for this again? Not really but I can finally say I've tried this place out.

Not sure why I didn't write a review for Ippudo after I first tried it in April 2008. ÊBack then Ippudo was "Club Ippudo" with its 2 hour wait times. I've been here probably 4 or 5 times now, but still prefer the Akamaru (slightly spicy and more flavorful) than the Shiromaru. ÊAkarmaru is basically the tonkotsu Shiromaru plus a small spoonful of a red paste that includes spices. I'm not sure why people rave about their pork buns. ÊI didn't find them to be tasty or noteworthy. I still haven't been to any Ippudo's in Japan, but I hear they are just good there, and not great. In Manhattan, Ippudo is my favorite ramen place, but I'm not ecstatic over it. ÊSantouka is still tops in the NYC region in my mind, until Ichiran finally opens (whenever they do).

So I finally attempted the feared much wait for ramen at Ippudo. Dinner opens at 5pm, and we arrived at 5:14 on a Tuesday evening. The place was already almost full; we (2) got seated within 15 minutes! The Hirata pork buns were good; they're like the children of Chinese Peking duck buns and Chinese char siu baos. I have to admit the Japanese version is a good contender (It could've been the luscious saucy fat inside). The ramen: we got the Akamaru and Shiromaru Hakata Classic ramen. Heeding the advice of a friend, we requested for no MSG. The waiter looked at us like we each had 3 heads. The food came, presented as "with no MSG" (Would I have known if there really was any MSG? Unlikely, because it tasted so good anyway). We just think this joint may be overrated, considering its price and red tape at the frontlines.

"We've tried a bunch of ramen places in Manhattan, and Ippudo is the best" Recommended: * Pork buns - Nice heat in the sauce without being overpowering, very tasty pork. I prefer Ippudo's pork buns over the ones at Momofuku Noodle Bar, which lack the spice. * Shiromaru Hakata Classic or Akamaru Modern - Ippudo's pork soup is the best as it has the strongest pork aroma without being overly salty. For the Hakata Classic, I would order it without the super thin noodles as they are less soft. I prefer the Akamaru Modern a little more as soup also includes miso and garlic oil. The pork itself is good at Ippudo, although I will say the pork at Minca is better as it's much more flavorful and tender. * Karaka Miso ramen - delicious soup with pork, ground pork, miso, and red spice. * Karaka Kogashi Miso Ramen - the charred miso is a nice change of pace and yummy. Okay: Samurai ribs - tasty pork short ribs although a little sweeter and not as tender than we would have liked. But still a solid and meaty dish. super thin noodles- Êtexture is a little too firm, i would recommend the more traditional noodle styles that are a little thicker Get there early to avoid a super long wait

As I've mentioned in a previous review, I have yet to find decent ramen in Nor Cal so when my friend suggested we go eat ramen in New York, we were all over it! I also previously mentioned that I usually don't feel that a ramen meal is complete without gyoza, but the soup was so delicious here that I didn't even think about it until later. We ordered the tuna tataki salad to share, I ordered the original ramen and my friend Grace and my boyfriend both ordered the akamaru ramen. Personally I preferred the soup that I ordered and savored every single bite. It was definitely the trendiest ramen place I've ever been and the hour wait seemed a little excessive, but it was worth it and unless I find a good ramen place around here I will definitely go back next time I'm in New York.

Okay. You got me. I've actually returned nearly twenty times in the past couple of months. What changed my mind? ÊI've found that all of their (limited) variety of ramen noodles are really delicious -- flavorful, deep, strong. I've also avoided appetizers that sound too 'experimental', sticking to what they're known for, namely the amazingly delicious (and slightly overpriced) pork buns! $4 each, seriously? The stars of the show really are the ramen noodles; and they shine bright, warming my heart and tingling my tongue with each bite. So good that I normally order extra noodles (kaedama) each time. Was that a bit much? ÊWell, stop reading and go try yourself! Food: 6 stars Waiting: -1 star (but I like that they don't take reservations!) Bathrooms: still very clean! Êand with crazy murals!

It's been quite awhile since I've braved the wait at Ippudo. ÊAlmost two years after it opened, I figured I could mosey on down with two of my buds on a weeknight at 11PM and not have to wait, right? Incorrect. ÊWTF. Fine, it was only a 15-minute wait. ÊBut still, wow, that's impressive. Anyways the downgrade in rating isn't because of the wait, it's because of the food. ÊWe ordered pork buns at the bar while waiting, and they were not as tasty as I remember. ÊDry, not enough sauce, sad and wilty-looking buns. ÊThe chicken wings were pretty good, but way too expensive at $8 for three. ÊAs for the noodles, I don't know. ÊThe broth is still good but the noodles are still limpish. ÊThe pork belly in the bowl was also so tough I didn't care to eat it. Well, at least the servers now speak English. ÊAnd now I know that Ippudo isn't worth the wait/price. ÊI'd rather have mediocre ramen at Menkui-Tei than slightly-better-mediocre ramen here.

yea........... i like this place. Something so simple can be made so dericious. Quenches your inner-undergrad-poorcollegestudent-nostalgic craving for ramen only to the n-th level. Sure do pay a price for the stroll down memory lane, but it's fine every now and then. HOT waiters. yumyum.

Another one of those 4/5 star straddlers. In the end, the ramen won out and I had to push for 5. The unctuous broth cut as deeply into the noodles as it did in my stomach. Going through a bowl of the richest kotteri ramen is a feat. Coming from LA, I've had a lot of ramen to compare to, and I still think Ippudo is one of the best. The downsides are mostly related to the price ($16) and their strange restaurant policies. I came here after picking up a half-dozen momofuku cookies. They didn't allow outside food so they confiscated my cookies. I can understand that; it's petty, but it's understandable. What bothered me more was the inane pork bun policy. At the bar, you order the pork buns individually for $4 each. Once seated though, the pork buns only come in orders of two for $8. We had a party of three and they didn't allow us to order three pork buns. The table next to us later had the same problem. The six of us should've just split three orders.

sorry to be the jerk on this one but... MEH! overrated for sure. I ordered the basic tonkotsu ramen because I wanted to try their broth without the distraction of other ingredients/flavoring the other ramens seemed to have. I was sad when I got my bowl... luke warm, thin broth and boring. tonkotsu broth is suppose to be rich and creamy. : ( aaand...

Gosh, I thought Momofuku Noodle Bar was my go-to ramen joint, but now it is a definite toss-up between it and Ippudo. So here are the details of Ippudo... Downside: 2.5 hour wait on a Friday night. Upside: It was totally worth it for mouthwatering spicy shrimp buns and a huge bowl of noodles with a poached egg and pork. Service was excellent. Decor was very cool. I'm hoping to go again during the week when the wait might be a little shorter.

I'm not really a ramen expert or anything, but I know what's good and what isn't. ÊThis place is good. ÊI just got the regular ramen because I feel that the first time at a place you should try their signature dishes. ÊI also got the pork buns too because everyone says to try the pork buns. ÊEverything was delicious. Also, I could see how people would get mad about the wait. ÊThe place isn't as big as I thought it would be, but the turnover rate is pretty good. ÊThe servers are good being attentive to the customers and when they leave to clean up for the next ones. For those thinking the wait isn't too long: I was there 15 minutes before it opened and I was one of the last people to have a spot in the restaurant. ÊFor those who came WHEN it opened had to wait.

I read some really good reviews about this place on Yelp, so I decided to go here tonight for dinner. ÊI was not disappointed. ÊMy order was remarkably simple: Êspicy ramen and ginga kogen beer. ÊThe ramen was just incredible. ÊThe broth was really spicy and yet not hot -- just a robust explosion of flavor. ÊThe ramen noodles were perfect being prepared with an al dente texture. ÊThe meat was good as well, but I would like to have seen more of it. Ê The restaurant is elegant and very nice. ÊUnfortunately, there were a few drawbacks. ÊCommunal seating can be undesirable for example, ironically, if you are eating alone.

I'm a tad disturbed that I haven't reviewed this place yet. ÊI've not lived in NYC since baby-hood, and I've now been here four times, and I've enjoyed it thoroughly each visit. ÊAt present, my favourite two Ramen-ya in N. America are this and Shinsengumi (original shop). Trip 1: Original Tonkotsu Hakata style Ramen + 1 kaedama, Mabo Tofu, Agedashi Tofu, harata buns. Ê1 Yebisu, 1 Sapporo, 1 Kirin, 1/2 bottle Sake. Result: Absolute bliss. Trip 2: Original Tonkotsu Ramen + 1 kaedama, Mabo Tofu, 1 Sapporo, 1 Yebisu. Result: Relative bliss Trip 3: (night) Original Tonkotsu Ramen + 3 Kaedama, Gindara, 1 Sapporo, 1 Yebisu, Result: Coma Trip 4: Snack Shoyu Ramen + 1 kaedama, Showa Gyu Aburi, 1 Yebisu. Result: Needed to rest. Despite the Gaijin shouting along in accented Japanese, their is a very tangible feel of Nippon in this place. ÊGutsy "Irrashaemase"s are belted out with gusto, and the echoed calls of "Niban kimarimasu" fill the room with the texture of a Kyushu styled venue in the crowded night streets of Tokyo. Long waits might fend off the casual, but it is well worth the wait. ÊIf one chooses off hours, sampling the food comes with less of a time cost. Ê Decor is modern and Japanese, with woods, mirrors and fabrics all of an appropriate heft, hue and texture. Ê Food is excellent. ÊIt's expensive, but if you're a ramen snob, there are never that many options in any city outside of Japan. This last trip I tried the 18 dollar appetizer of Beef Aburi. ÊI loved it. ÊTender beef marinated in shoyu, vinegar, turnip, ginger, garlic, scallions, delicately cooked and topped with sauteed Shimeji and Korean squash. ÊI loved it. ÊI savoured every morsel.

There are so many things I like about Ippudo, the hip decor, walls lined with contemporary art, the sake infused cocktails, the savory appetizers with more pop than a bubblegum smacking teenager. But it's all about the ramen. The perfect balance of rich broth, hand-made noodles with just the right amount of bite, and flavorful, yet not overpowering, garnishes. ÊThere's definitely an art to achieving this balance, something that's taken me a while to acquire a taste to, and having sampled a number of different ramen houses, this is about as close as it gets. So why four stars? The wait is ridiculous. ÊLike all fads in NYC, the hyper-dense population of Manhattan, once there's something pretty good in the hood, you can bet you're gonna have to line up for it. ÊHow about two and a half hours on a Saturday night? ÊForgetaboutit. ÊEven then it's not exactly worth it. ÊPlus the prices are a little steep. ÊI could overlook either of these faults on their own, but together, I just can't give this place 5 stars. I'd recommend coming on either a weeknight, or even better, for lunch. ÊAnd yes, you also have to try the pork buns, white steamed buns with sweet cuts of pork slathered in japanese mayo and topped with green onion. ÊDamn, freaking delicious. ÊEven at four bucks a bite. ÊBut I digress. ÊAvoid the crowd and count your five stars...

I've wanted to try this place out for a while, but never gotten the chance to until earlier this week. I've heard how the wait is really long, but I was not too surprised that on such a rainy Monday night, there were already a lot of people waiting to get seated. However, friends had came here early and gotten a table ahead of time, but they wouldn't seat them until entire party is there. I've only waited for a mere 10 minutes because I was late, but my friends waited about half an hour before I arrived. The ambiance of this restaurant is really cute. We were seated by the wall with the Japanese characters, which was pretty neat. The wait staff were really friendly and attentive. For appetizer we had ordered the baby octopus, which was very fresh. We also had the pork buns and they were really good. It has fatty tissues in the pork, but I think that was what made it even more delicious. I had the Akamaru Modern ramen, which was indeed very good! The noodles were not soggy at all and it's made the way I like it. Too bad I am always a small eater, or else I would've added $2 to get more noodles. Oh yea, it's like they know my favorite color is red or something because my bowl was red and all of my friends got a white bowl haha...just what a coincidence hehe. The bathroom is downstairs and they are pretty clean. When I came back up from the bathroom, I guess my eyes were trying to adjust from light to the dark hallway leading back to the dining area or maybe because it's a dark hallway with mirrors...that I walked right into the mirror thinking it was an entrance. Luckily it was just a light bump.

I didn't think it would be fair to penalize Ippudo a star because of it's prices and long wait. ÊCompared with the other restaurants in NY, I consider this to be a bargain at about $15-20 per person. The difference that separates this place from many of the others is that the noodles are homemade in-house (you can see the work area downstairs close to the bathrooms). ÊThere is something about fresh noodles that you can't find in ones that are refrigerated or frozen. The broth is amazing - both mine and my girlfriend's were distinctly different and equally as tasty. ÊThe meat is melt-in-your-mouth tender (though not generously portioned). ÊWith regard to the small portions, there is an option to add noodles to your dish for $2. ÊSimply keep some of your broth and ask for a ball of noodles. ÊThis will surely give those the extra noodle fix to fill their bellies.

When it comes to fancypants ramen, Ippudo has shown me the light. I never quite understood the whole ramen craze until the fateful evening I visited Ippudo. (And I've been to Momofuku.) Nearly every part of the experience was as exquisite as the restaurant itself. The spicy tofu appetizer special was a scrumptious way to start the meal. Then there were the noodles... oh, the noodles. They weren't kidding when they said they stew the broth for 15 hours. That becomes very obvious once the spoon hits your lips -- is there such a thing as a broth-orgasm? Because I think I had one from that Akamaru bowl. Before that, I was pretty skeptical about how wonderful a broth could really be. All I can say is WOW! So much flavor, somehow such rich texture without being at all creamy. I could have slurped my bowl clean after putting away all those perfectly chewy noodles. As for that excellent cut of pork in my soup, well of course that was darn tasty, too. Like everyone else, I would not have minded more than one slice in my bowl, but at the same time, I wonder if my stomach would have been able to handle all that deliciousness...? I wasn't crazy about the matcha brulee. Sometimes I like green tea, sometimes I don't, and this was certainly an example of where it didn't tickle my pickle. I would not hesitate to come back to Ippudo a second, third or fourth time. Some people don't think the food justifies the cost, but I must say, if you're going to pay $12+ for a bowl of ramen, go to Ippudo. Not only will your money get you some good grub, but you'll eat in a beautifully designed restaurant and receive friendly, smiley service from the staff.

Granted eating hot ramen on a summer day was not the greatest idea. But we still did it anyways. The ramen itself is very good, our group totally stopped talking once our ramen got there and we devoured it. Their pork buns melted in our mouths and were amazing! But its freaking dark as hell in there! I'd like to SEE my food when I eat it, just saying. And the place always has a wait, even though when we were seated there were clearly tables empty near us. Do they just make ppl wait to make them think the place is busy? The waiter we had was pretty good, but then he started taking our plates away when our appetizers came, er how are we suppose to eat it then? And then it took a while for him to get the ice for our friend's drink. And don't get me started on the wanna be hip I'm so cool crowd that hangs there with their pretentious attitude. I always find it weird that a bunch of white ppl are greeting you in japanese, yes i'm talking about the hostess. The crowd there seems too fake I'd rather go to another ramen place where you can see your food and the hostess isn't making you wait cause they want to build up a crowd. Their ramen is good, but not worth such a wait and dealing with total retards.

Went here again with my sis this time for some good ol' ramen. I upgraded my rating from 4 to 5 since Ippudo have become the best ramen I have had so far. The dinner atmosphere was awesome, chic, and romantic. The staff was friendly and it was enjoyable to see them doing their job with cheerfulness. The ramen quality, like usual, was superb: The right softness and texture. The soup was awesome as well. You might have to wait for 45 minutes to an hour for dinner time compared to shorter waiting time during lunch hour, but it's totally worth it. Once you are seated, you won't be rushed at all to leave. Hands down to Ippudo NY, I will come back everytime here to get my craving for ramen. It might be a little bit pricey compared to Totto ramen, but it is convenient that you can pay by credit card.

My buddy Takeaki, who's a native from Southern California & New York City recommended Ippudo to me. Gotta give him his props you know? Because I'm from Orange County, the best ramen I can get nearby is Santouka at the Mitsuwa market. Ippudo took them out with ease. Most people I figure would probably head out to David Chang's Momofuku for his ramen. Which is not bad don't get me wrong but I think was particularly designed for the masses. It was Halloween and the streets were full of Amy Winehouse's and Lady Gaga's. It was pouring rain and to get to Ippudo was a disaster. The streets were closed due to the Halloween festival and I walked maybe 3 miles to get to Ippudo. I knew getting there that I would have to wait a good hour or two to get seated. I didn't care. I wanted ramen and I wanted it NOW. (Waitress got me a seat within 30 minutes btw. I think they tell you 2 hours but you never know when a seat pops up) While I waited, I decided to order the Pork Buns. I'm a fan of David Chang and the Momofukus' but Ippudo got you beat on these man. It was straight butter. I liked the taste of the pork in these a lot more. For Ramen, I went with the Akamaru Modern. A true bowl of ramen. Broth was red, Pork was on point, ramen was clean and simple. Pricing was fair for NYC and the service and decor was on point. Dark and 110% Japanese. A fan. And everytime I come to NYC, I'm visiting Ippudo every single time.

Ramen was great; pork belly appetizer is TO DIE FOR. That pretty much sums it up. This is a very popular place, to say the least, and for good reason. The ambiance gives a great downtown vibe and the food will not disappoint. Nevertheless, I personally prefer Totto Ramen up in Hell's Kitchen. Don't get me wrong, Ippudo is definitely worth repeat visits and the long wait times.

This is long over due, but I just wanted to say thanks Ippudo for such a lovely meal. It took us three tries to actually come here, but I'm so glad we did. The noodles are homemade, and the broth is delicious. It was soooo good, that even my bf ate his whole bowl...which definitely says a lot since he doesn't care for noodles. I don't think he slowed down once from the time it was set on the table to the time he slurped up his last bite. Our group ordered the appetizer sampler, but it wasn't as memorable as the noodles. Who can resist a steaming bowl on a cold winter night?? Tip: If you ever get the chance to go to Ippudo in Tokyo. DO IT!!! I thought i had tasted heaven here until I went there.

This place was a recommendation from a friend and a great one at that. I loved this place. Located in the east village. I would probably never go into this place if I just walked by. What a pleasant surprise! When you first walk in all the staff welcome you by shouting at once. It was hilarious. Love the decor. It's like a cozy Japanese dining room. It's also always comforting to see primarily Japanese people at a Japanese restaurant. It gives me the sense of authenticity. The pork steamed buns were the best I've ever had. (Slightly spicy) I also enjoyed the Akamaru ramen. I've never tasted anything like it. We also enjoyed some hot sake (sake!sake!sake). I would definitely return! From the way the staff shouted at us in thanks when we left, I think they want us to return!

Heard so many good things about this place and wanted to relive my times in Japan (I lived off this stuff when I was there). First off, kudos to Ippudo for carrying Yebisu which is a otherwise forgotten Japanese beer here in the states. My friend gave me that useful note while we were waiting in line for 45 mins (I heard that was typical), and we ordered a round. It was pretty good but I don't think it'd win anyone over who doesn't already love Japanese beer. Onto the ramen, first off their broth was superb. It was familiar enough to the basic ramen soup base but they must've added crack to it because I was gulping it down. The 5 large pieces of choshu pork I got with it was also of very high quality and very tasty. The noodles were also interestingly thin and a little hard, which is what you expect from a good ramen place. I've had ramen with thicker fatter slippery noodles and it just wasn't the same.

The great ramen hunt continues... Tonight's hopeful contender is Ippudo Ramen in the East Village. Wifey and I had our doubts as Ippudo has built its reputation on gourmet and "fancified" ramen. ÊDagnabbit! ÊNo fancy-schmancy ramen joint is gonna impress me with its city slicker flash! ÊNope, I gots a jaundiced eye on you, Ippudo... We walk into a dark and neo-modern space. ÊThere are communal tables, fanciful decor, and plenty of people slurping piping hot ramen everywhere we look. I scoff, and we're seated against a wall with a nice view of the open area. ÊThe menu is startlingly spartan. ÊI expected a lot of fluff and extraneous crap with such hip and zingy decor. Ramen really is the highlight here and I become even more suspicious. ÊI order a bowl dubbed the Akamaru Modern, while wifey opts for the more traditional miso ramen. The Akamaru's base was a pork broth jazzed up with black garlic oil, red miso paste, cabbage, slices of Berkshire pork, and a partridge and a pear tree... so many ingredients, I was certain they would ruin the purity of the ramen. Surprisingly, everything in the bowl was harmonious and tasty. ÊThose crazies at Ippudo really do know something about ramen... go figger. Wifey's miso broth was some of the best I've tasted. ÊThe noodles were great too - thin, slightly crisp, and plenty chewy. I was flabbergasted when I went downstairs to use the restroom and passed by Ippudo's very own ramen pulling machine. ÊDamn, these guys are serious. All in all, one of the top ramen experiences we've had.

My favorite ramen in NYC. Plan your visit strategically (i.e., eat during off-off-peak hours) to avoid the long waits. People, the mythical Ippudo vegetarian ramen does exist. I brought a couple who were 1 meatatarian and 1 vegetarian and both were quite satisfied with the experience. The vegetarian ramen is not on the menu, but it has a shiitake-base broth, includes seaweed and bamboo shoots among other ingredients, and is quite flavorful despite its lack of meat. You can also add an egg if you are not a strict vegetarian. I've posted a photo. They also do great things with fried chicken. I've had at least 2 variants of fried chicken there and both were delicious. The service here is exceptional. I'm amazed they are so polite and helpful even with all of the crowds.

I'm still on the fence on whether i'd give this place a 3 or 4... I tried the modern ramen and it was pretty good, but I've had better. It's pricey for just ramen and the portions are a bit small.. but.. THE PORK BUNS ARE SOOOO DELICIOUS!! i heard the wait here can be ridiculous but I must've come at a good time because we were promptly seated as soon as we walked in. This is not your typical ramen joint. It has a loungey feel to it and the interior is very nice and dimly lit. I'd give it 3 stars for its ramen, but 4 for their pork buns!

I went with the some friends..i ordered the Karaka ÊRamen which has the bean paste.. The soup was beautiful, it came with a ball of grated ginger that when mixed into the soup, it spread through out.. I also enjoyed the thicker ramen.. The rest of the people had the Akamaru Modern which is a super porkified broth.. Had a really intense pork flavor and thinner noodles.. I would call these closer to angel hair and my broth a spaghetti.. Place is large but crowded.. Love the seating, lots of booths with comfortable chairs. Also bar seats and bench seats for communal and large parties.. Staff was very nice.

So I've been secretly on the search for ramen that tastes as authentic as the one I've eaten in Japan. I had curry ramen in, literally, a hole in the wall ramen-ya. Foodgasm right there! I've tried everything from packaged ramen to other restaurants' ramen. Before I tried Ippudo, the ramen stand in Edgewater's Mitsuwa was the best. Now it's #2. (Btw, don't try Morimoto's ramen. It's terrible.) Anyway, the ramen at Ippudo is exactly as I remember my ramen experience in Japan was - an extremely thick and rich broth that is the perfect balance of salty, savory, and meaty/"brothy". I don't remember the exact name, unfortunately, but I highly recommend the special ramen that they offer. I've tried the original and I prefer their special one. The original is good, don't get me wrong, but the ginger flavor was a bit too overpowering for me. I've also tried their pork buns and rice burger. Hm, well, I mean it's carbs and pork belly. What's not to love? The bun part was the exact same bun by Momofuku so I think it's safe to say that they don't make the buns from scratch. But that's ok! The pork belly is succulent and goes very well with the Japanese mayo and the spicy sauce. There is a piece of lettuce in here. It adds a nice refreshing crunch and it now makes these pork buns healthy in my eyes :D Their rice burger replaces the traditional bread bun with rice cakes that seem to be pan fried in some butter and then brushed with some kind of soy sauce based glaze. There is also pork belly, this time it's brushed with the same glaze that the rice is. Instead of french fries, it's served with pickled vegetables. This automatically becomes health food people. Go eat 8 of these. So good for you! The only bad thing is the waiting.. but it's so worth it.

Ok the David Chang empire may forsake me because I totally cheated on them last night, but eff it..it was a special occasion so I figured lets do it. First of all, the wait is an hour and twenty minutes. ÊAs someone who really never waits for anything, and probably the fact that I wouldn't wait an hour and twenty minutes for the second coming of Christ I amazed myself with this situation. We plopped ourselves in the community table. ÊEveryone who worked there was very nice. ÊWe must have looked like regulars there because they did not wait two seconds to take our order. For apps, we had the Pork Buns and these pieces of fried Chicken. ÊThe pork buns fight goes to David Chang...probably because I am a sucker for the Hoisin sauce. ÊThe fried chicken was good too. Now it comes down the ultimate, whos ramen is better argument. ÊAnd my answer to that.... nobody wins. ÊIppudo's ramen was good, I enjoyed it a lot! ÊThe broth was full of flavor and everything was great. ÊBut I like Momo's ramen too and find that they are completely different in style. ÊTherefore we aren't comparing apples to apples on this one. So I give this joint 4 stars. ÊI would have given it 3 stars but it got the one star extra because my ass was WAAAAAY more comfortable than Momofuku, partly because of the wonderful chairs and seating they have there. The Breakdown: Buns - Chang wins Ramen - Nobody wins My ass comfort - Ippudo wins

I heart you, Ippudo. First of all, this place is a gastronomical AND visual feast. It's so pretty -- I was really impressed by the interesting decor. I also kind of liked that you were seated with strangers -- it seemed smart and spatially economical. It also gave me a great chance to be uber-creepy and stare at other people's orders. Apparently there's often a bit of a wait there, but there's a pleasant bar area to wait in that's a separate room (another great plus because you're not awkwardly standing next to people dining and salivating like a sad puppy). As it was my first visit, I ordered the classic ramen with pork belly -- the pork belly was delicious (order this!!) and the classic ramen was really good too (though more will come on delicious ramen later). Keep in mind that I was incredibly hung over from the night before so the fact that I could eat this at all meant it was exceptionally delicious. My boyfriend ordered the spicy version of the classic one and whined that it was, as always, not spicy enough. It's only good when it hurts, right? BUT, the big wow! dish was my friend's order of the *miso ramen*. I tried a little bit of it and it was all I could do to not say "Look over there!" and sneakily switch our bowls. It wasn't that my classic ramen was bad (it wasn't, it was quite delicious!), it was that the miso ramen was fantastic -- the stuff dreams are made of. Well, ramen dreams, at least.

Sigh. I've put off reviewing this place in fear of only making the long waits even worse, but I'm getting ready to leave and the time has come... I've once eaten at this place three times in two days. Yes, seriously. It really is that good. In fact, if I wasn't a broke grad student, there's a good chance I'd be eating here twice a day, everyday. This is what you need to order: Samurai Ribs to start. (If you're brave, the raw octopus isn't bad and the Japanese peppers are always nice, but you MUST get the rib.) Then the Modern with kakuni. That's it. You're done. You just had the best ramen you'll ever find without leaving the states. The key to this place is to go at exactly 5:30 to avoid having to wait. If you're in a group larger than 4 people, show up earlier. Oh, and avoid--at all cost--the pork buns. I have no idea why people like them, but if that's your thing, walk over to Momofuku Milk Bar and get some there--the ones here are a serious let down. They're nothing you couldn't find for a quarter the price in Chinatown.

believe the hype. it was good for me, i hope it's good for you. the quick: I waited 1.5 hours, full skeptic I dined and was impressed by Karaka Men Bowl $14 Lunch Yelpers are right, the wait is long from beginning to end wait rating: I would be willing to wait 48 minutes to eat here again First of all, waiting seems to be a staple of this place. ÊSaturday afternoon was a 1.5 hour wait outside. ÊThis place has no trouble with business. ÊI went with some friends that recommended it. ÊI'm not a ramen fanatic but I appreciate a good bowl of noodles and also like to try new places so there we were. The restaurant inside is great. ÊReally modern, hip and dark cool. ÊThe servers are wildly attentive, almost to the point where I felt watched. ÊIt was a bit odd. Anyhow, we placed our orders and the food took longer than a person's usual expectations but the restaurant was running full capacity so I wasn't surprised. ÊPlease also expect that a bowl of ramen will cost you dearly. ÊMore than other reputable places like Shin Sen Gumi () which I already find pricey at $10+ for a bowl with fixings. So the ramen here is actually very good. ÊAlmost amazing but pulled down by the wait and work to get here. ÊBut the flavors on every level from broth to noodles to fixings were really great. ÊI didn't fall in love but my skepticism had to give it up for the quality that was apparent in each wonderful slurp. ÊI really enjoyed my meal and that's what I'm looking for from a restaurant. So while this place is majorly hyped, sky high priced and a tedious wait, you get a great dining experience. ÊIf you're a resident of NY, I might wait for a less crowded time but as a tourist I'm willing to wait longer for an experience that I don't know can be matched on the West Coast at the moment. ÊAnyone willing to recommend a contender in SoCal?

Setagaya, move over!!! Up until 3/26/08 Setagaya was my favorite ramen joint in the city...I didn't think any place would come close to Setagaya and yet here I am writing this 5-star review for Ippudo. I have been there 2 times in the past 2 days...I will have eaten there 3 times in 7 days by this Thursday. I know....CRAZY. The first time I went for lunch and had the Shiromaru classic and lunch special with the spicy cod roe. Can you say YUM?! Goodness, the creaminess of the broth and robust (but not too powerful) flavor...man, those 15+ hours of boiling the pork definitely paid off. The balance of flavor of the broth and the bite/texture of the ramen was perfect. And the cod roe, man, you can't really mess up cod roe but it was so delicious! It came over rice with special mayo, seaweed and thinly sliced cabbage. I was weary of the mayo but I was pleasantly surprised at the delicate flavor once I mixed all the ingredients together. The second time I went I had dinner and chose the Akamaru Modern (note they had prior to launch a separate lunch and dinner menu -the Shiromaru and Akamaru are available in both, but there is a third for lunch and third/fourth different choice for dinner)-- can you say YUM YUM?! I still can't decide which I like better but when you have two excellent bowls of ramen does it matter which one is better??? AND, my table split the pork belly and radish appetizer and that is A MUST. The pork belly was perfectly braised and it was the ultimate slice (perfect portion of buttery fat and tender meat). You cannot go to Ippudo and not have this appetizer!!! So now my NYC ramen ranking stands as follows: 1. Ippudo 2. Setagaya (I have them 4 stars but really they're at about 4.5 stars--but given that I'm putting 5 stars for Ippudo, I had to round down) 3. Menchanko-tei (okay note, the ramen here is probably about a 3.5-4, but the spicy cod roe rice ball...YUM YUM YUM!!!)

Came here last night, the wait is ~35 min long even though I got there at 5pm. I know that I am deviating from the rest of 1k+ reviews in giving this place a 3 star only, this is why: -- atmosphere: chic, dark, cozy, not your typical mom-and-pop Ramen place, but then again, this is a chain. -- service, the hot tea didn't come until at the end of the meal? Êand there is not self-serve Kimchi on the table. -- food: Ê - $8 for 2 pieces of Pork bun, very tasty, but isn't it a bit EXPENSIVE?! - $14 for #2 red tonkatsu original Ramen, very tasty, and the soup is the right rich, creamy texture. But the noodles are very different from what I expected, they are thin and not too chewy, more like Soba noodles than the Ramen noodles I was used to at Santa Ramen in the Bay Area. The topping, $4 extra for Buta Kakuni, it's good, but avg compared to "Kahoo" ramen in San Jose.. - $13 for Shoyu ramen, very avg and nothing spectacular.. -- bill for 2 bowls of ramen + pork bun Ê~~$50! -- for the price alone, I lowered it from 4 stars to 3 stars on my rating system, though I do understand that New Yorkers are used to be over charged for reasonably good food. ---- I might come back again, after I've tried out the more intimate Setagaya and MomoFuku .... Ê but definitely not the best bang for the buck here..

Ippudo was one of my favorite tonkotsu ramen shops in Japan so I was very excited to hear that they would open a shop in NY. ÊThere are however some notable differences between the Ippudo in Japan. ÊHere is what I noticed: 1. There is much more on the menu in NY. ÊIt is more of a restaurant than a ramen shop. ÊIn addition, there were different kinds of ramen in the NY shop such as miso, shoyu and tsukemen. Ê 2. The only condiments in NY was a black pepper and also a sesame seed grinder. ÊIn Japan, there is ginger, takana and raw garlic. 3. In NY, there was no pitcher of rooibos tea. 4. Cabbage was used in the ramen in the NY shop. 5. It is considerably cheaper in Japan. The taste was the same I remember having in Japan. ÊIf you don't mind spending $15 for a bowl of ramen, you won't get a better bowl anywhere else in NY.

I had planned, months in advanced, all the delicious eateries my boyfriend and I had to try while we were in New York and Ippudo was not on the list. So, so, SOOOO glad that I turned on my laptop one morning and logged onto my Yelp account (because logging on doesn't happen too often. I rely heavily on the Yelp app on my iPhone). I can't recall why I logged on but again, like I said, I'm glad I did. Had I not, I wouldn't of come across Ippudo which was featured under "Hot on Yelp". Seriously, I honestly believed that it was fate that brought us together. Anyway, after going over the menu with the boyfriend, we decided to eat here for dinner that day I came across it and boy was it packed! We waited about 40 minutes to get seated but it was well worth the wait. We ordered the Hirata Buns and those buns are DELICIOUS!!!! AAAANNNND I hate pork buns (so that speaks for itself). We both ordered the Akamaru Modern Ramen and it was pretty good considering I'm quite picky with my ramen. For dessert, we ordered the blood orange sorbet which was definitely refreshing and super delicious. Definitely worth coming back! Service was amazing! Food was amazing! Super sad that we didn't get a chance to dine here a second time before flying back to LA but don't worry tummy, we'll be back in May ;)

Great ramen, amazing appetizers (well, SOME of them are amazing)- but if the wait is over 30 minutes, it's probably not worth it. Ê The pork buns are waay better than Momofuku! ÊFor me - this is the item on the menu that makes it worth the wait! ÊAlthough the ramen is also quite awesome. ÊBasically anything with pork is excellent and exciting. Ê Conversely, the most boring/disappointing thing I ever ordered here is the Avocado/Tofu appetizer which is basically like going to your nearby asian grocer, opening a pack of tofu and slicing some avacados on top of it.

I heard so much about this place.. finally got a chance to try it out.. it's definitely worth the trip. I'm not a big fan of noodle. but I have to say their ramen was SO-SO good. I didn't expect this place being fancier than I thought. nice venue. there is always a wait of course. I would say get all your parties together before you put down your name. I saw this happened to many parties when the host realized the entire partied wasn't there, even she put down your name. you are going to wait for long time. I was with 2 people and she told us it'll be 30 minutes and she saw all my parties were there. she seated us within 5 minutes. ÊJust a little tip there. I would HIGHLY recommend the ramens. I tried some appetizers, they were too americanized to my taste. ÊPrice is a little bit on the high end for ramen, but it's worth it.

If you ask me to rate them solely based on their ramen, then it is definitely 5 stars! this place serves up the best bowl of ramen in manhattan. was here on their soft dinner opening. there was a queue at opening time but only because they have quite a big place and were trying to optimize the seating arrangements. the wait was not very long. this place is very spacious for a ramen joint! their decor is also very cool and funky. lighting is on the darker side. fancy wall decor, interesting table top displays. their artistic effort is commendable indeed. even the cooks are dressed in interestingly colourful bandannas and shirts. plenty of wait staff littered the place. they were friendly and efficient. but the girl who served us somehow seem to insist that we have our entrees before our ramen! we told her it was ok to send us our ramen anytime but we only got it after the 3 entrees we ordered. i think they need to work on their entrees in terms of speed of delivery. it took half an hour before the first one arrived. and we also had to wait rather long between each entrees. the spicy tofu was tasty. something like the chinese ma po tofu. the addition of crispy ramen in the sauce gave it a nice texture and taste. my only complain was that the tofu was cold even though the spicy meaty sauce was piping hot. the kakuni entree was delicious. the radish and the fatty pork were both very well stewed and infused with flavour of the sweet sauce. the beef steak ippudo style, however was expensive and very forgettable! and after almost 50 mins we finally got our ramen. we had their akamaru ramen. it is their original tonkotsu ramen with additional special ippudo sauce. the soup was slurpingly delicious. flavourful, creamy yet not too heavy. the noodles were thin but not overcooked. it could have been more al dente but it was acceptable. the pork slice was nicely marbled and tender. adding another slice wouldnt hurt. in just 10 mins, my bowl was bone dry! i would recommend that you skip their entrees so as to enjoy their awesome ramen asap. their potential is definitely there and they will be a 5 star establishment in no time!

As a longtime momofuku fan, it pains me to say: if I want ramen or pork buns, I'm heading to Ippudo. THE PLACE Whatever. Buncha crazy Japanese modern stuff all thrown together. Kinda has a 'Tokyo-1980s-On-A-Budget' vibe. Noisy, open kitchen, plenty of attentive staff. You can get your own booth or sit communal-style. Doesn't really matter, just bring my noodles out. THE FOOD The ramen is perfect: the broth is amazing, the noodles fresh and springy. The spicy pork ramen has wonderful, rich flavor and just enough kick to keep you mowing through it without being overwhelmed by heat. The kae-dama option is genius. You know how sometimes you're eating ramen and you end up with tons of broth and no noodles left? Or if you try to horde your noodles for later, they're soggy by the time you get to them? Kae-dama allows you to get a noodle refresh mid-way through, when there is still plenty of broth and no noodles left. Just shout "kae-dama onegai shimasu!" and out comes another helping of dry noodles, plopped into your bowl. Just the right amount to finish, and firm and springly like when your bowl was new. The buns: wasn't sure how momofuku's approach could be improved on, but Ippudo has done it. They're more japanese in character with mayo (kewpie?), chili oil and lettuce instead of the cucumbers. And that same amazing candy-like berkshire pork. I'll still keep hitting the various momofuku's for their inventive menus, but for ramen and buns, or rare treats like niku-jaga (a light potato and beef stew), Ippudo is it. BOTTOM LINE Just go with someone, get beers, buns and 2 different kinds of ramen just to see. You'll end up getting the Spicy Pork Ramen every time after, but just try another to contrast. gochisoo sama deshita!

The pork fat in Ippudo's tonkotsu broth is pretty in-your-face. It's a matter of taste and some obviously love this much richness in their soup, but I dove into the Akamaru Modern with much pent-up anticipation this weekend and it was just too much for me. The pork-fat punch plus skimpy toppings and high prices leads me to a three-star rating for Ippudo. Nice service and atmosphere though (huge space for a ramen joint - maybe their prices are jacked up to pay their probably enormous rent). Ramen noodles themselves were great. UPDATE: a upgrade from 3 to 4 stars for the excellent MISO ramen I had on a subsequent visit! Maybe it's my slow progression towards pseudo-vegetarianism (burgers being a notable exception), but I loved being able to enjoy Ippudo's thick, flavorful, slightly sweet miso broth with the knowledge that my arteries were not clogging with cholesterol quite so rapidly. I'm not normally a huge miso fan, but I think that faint touch of soy sweetness is what did it for me. With a dash of red pepper, heavenly.

KAE-DAMA, ONEGAISHIMAS! This is a magical, magical phrase if you're a big eater. For an extra $2, you can get an extra ball of noodles plunked into your broth after you finish your noodles (so don't slurp up the broth like I did). That said, the ramen & broth are so good! Noodles are thinner than usual, but it's nice and chewy - reminds me of "la mian" or pulled noodles in Chinese cuisine. Good stuff. I very rarely drink ramen broth because it is crazy unhealthy, but I slurped up every last drop in my bowl, long after I finished my ramen. ÊIt's unfortunate that I accidentally drank all my broth before realizing I could get an extra serving of noodles, but I will definitely be back to take advantage of this next time, as well as try their pork buns and other dishes... which look suspiciously like momofuku's...

Êthe noodles was good too, this is prob the first place where I finished all of my noodles. ÊYes, it cost $13 a bowl... but consider this... for $8 you can get a soy sauce base bowl of ramen... but the broth is just made out of soy sauce. ÊHere, the broth is create with pork and other delicious ingredient, of course I dont know what. ÊI'd say its worth it. Ê We also ordered the pork belly, yummy. ÊDidnt feel fatty at all.

Why didn't I have the Akamaru Modern ramen in the first place?! Delicious savory broth that didn't get salty toward the bottom of the bowl, and perfect, thin, al dente noodles. Ordered the Hirata pork buns again and noticed the sauce a lot more - it was sweet, but had a little bite due to some spice. So good! Forgive me, Ippudo. I have seen the light.

Ippudo attracts those of us in search of a better ramen option in the EV. Though many opinions I've read so far have addressed a serious concern Êfor being overpriced, I think the Akamaru Modern is well worth it's price. On my first two visits I skipped out on the extra noodles (another $3), strictly on principle. A $16 bowl of ramen? No thanks. I felt as if it wasn't as fulfilling as I had hoped a $13 bowl would, but satisfied nonetheless. On my third visit, I splurged and it made all the difference. If you're a price conscious foodie go with a friend and split the extra noodles. It's worth every cent. I've also tried the Kara-age with fried Taro chips and found it very tasty. The plating all around was minimal, but elegant enough to fetch the asking prices. If you're a budget foodie that isn't big on ramen, I would skip Ippudo and maybe try Kenka's/Taisho/Menku ti. If you're a ramen worshipper, a pho fiend (Ippudo is a good substitute - seriously), or Japanese cuisine fanatic then Ippudo is a great place to go.

Ippudo has by far one of the best soups i've ever tasted. .. worth the 2 hour Êwait in line? probably not but regardless, still pretty DARN tasty. Go late or for an early dinner. Wish it were slightly cheaper but hey, it's a damn good bowl of soup. Down side. (and one less star because of it) : you can't take your soup to go.

Okay, first off I have an irrational love for the ramen and broth at this place. ÊI know there are equally good --if not better-- places nearby where you won't suffer through the lines and spend as much. ÊBut I don't care. I started dining here right when they opened the location. ÊI've seen it transition and wane a bit from the initial Japanese launch staff to the New York crew you see today. ÊOverall it's still great and I categorize it as a must visit. The consistency and taste of the noodles is fantastic. ÊI have a set limit of 2 to 3 kaedama (extra noodles) after a particularly obscene session of 5 or so re-ups. My typical gets: Hirata Buns -- usually order the pork variety to split with friends at 1 per person. Akamaru -- my usual go to. ÊThey used to offer a spiced up version of this dish, but now I recreate it with a side of the same spice sauce they use in the Karaka Miso. I usually stick to the tonkotsu (pork bone) broths, but the chicken and miso bases are strong, too. ÊFor first time or one time diners my suggestion is to order a tonkotsu based dish. ÊIt's what they do best.

pros: The restaurant is easily accessible, and once you finally get a table, your meal comes out pretty fast. You are then rewarded for your waiting with tasty, tasty ramen. cons: Eating ramen always makes me sweat. It didn't help that it was uncomfortably hot in Ippudo even with the AC on. I might have said something to the staff, but they really didn't seem to give a shit about us. As we were waiting to be seated, they sighed at us when our party wasn't all here and made us feel guilty that we were keeping them waiting. On top of this, everything is overpriced -- the drinks, the extras that you have to order to add in your soup. overall: If you think good ramen is worth the splurge, the wait, the non-authentic yelling in Japanese, and unattentive staff, by all means, go eat your fill of this nonsense.

Ippudo NY is damn close to the Ippudo in Tokyo. The noodles pack almost as much flavor and texture; the broth almost as beautiful and yummy. But Ippudo NY is also marred by some glaring problems. The wait sucks, the prices exorbitant, and the side dishes slightly above average. I would hate to stand in line for two hours amongst 20 people squeezed at the bar only to be disappointed by a bowl of $14 ramen. At Ippudo Tokyo, I could get ramen and a side of gyoza for less than nine bucks. But at Ippudo NY, I get a slightly inferior bowl of noodles without any sides, which would cost another ten or so dollars. Everyone raves about the pork buns. I say skip the damn dish and just get the ramen. Ipuddo's pork bun would never pass as acceptable at a chinese restaurant. If you want overpriced pork buns in NYC, try Momofuku.

Update: ÊOne key thing: ÊThey have very little room where you can wait for your table, but they will take your phone number and call you when your table is almost ready. ÊThe Central Bar and Village Pourhouse are around the corner. ÊYou guys can figure out the rest. Ê About a 10 minute walk from my dorm in Tokyo was Ippudo Ramen. Ê Ippudo is a small chain in Japan with about 30 or so shops around the country. ÊI can remember checking their website when I was getting ready to leave Japan and seeing a note that they were planning to expand and open a shop in the US, but no timeframe was given. Ê I returned in January of 2007 and quickly forgot about Ippudo. ÊSince it's impossible to get that quality of ramen here in Boston, I was forced to forget about it lest I torture myself unnecessarily. As I prepared to head to New York and visit with some college buddies, I figured I'd be able to find some ramen that would at least compare to what I'd found in Japan. ÊI fired up Yelp and searched New York for ramen. ÊI was shocked when Ippudo was near the top of the list. ÊThey had literally opened on Monday (March 31st.) ÊI counted my blessing and headed there for lunch shortly after arriving. By necessity and culture Ippudo is different in New York than it is in Tokyo. ÊIt's much bigger and roomier. ÊAmericans won't tolerate being seated as closely as Japanese are accustomed. ÊUnfortunately my beloved gyoza (pork dumplings) are not on the menu though I hope they will add them soon. We started off with the chicken karaake, essentially battered fried chicken. ÊThe Japanese tend to like dark meat, and there was no exception made here as the chicken was moist and juicy and had a very spicy sauce on top. We both got shiromaru ramen with a side of rice. ÊMine was topped with cod roe, seaweed and some mayonnaise. ÊIt was quite good and the stickiness of the rice was perfect. ÊMy friend got his topped with roasted pork and enjoyed it immensely. The ramen itself was very good. ÊSoft but still with a good bite. ÊI would like to see them offer you the option of soft or hard one the non-Japanese customers get more used to the ordering process. ÊPerhaps they offer it to Japanese customers now, I have no way of knowing. The broth was exactly as a remembered, rich and fatty and delicious. Ê The only disappointments were the pork slices. ÊI think that perhaps they are using a less fatty cut of pork here and it was a bit dry. ÊI would also like an option to pay more and get more pork slices. ÊIn Tokyo you could go from two slices to six for another Y200. ÊI'd like to see this option here as well. All told it was a great lunch and I'll be back here the next time I'm in the city.

This place definitely lives up to all the hype imho. It was a freezing late December afternoon and we arrived at Ippudo right before they opened before dinner. Thankfully they let all the many, MANY people waiting for them to open to do so in their from entrance by the bar. It was very chaotic when the girl finally came out with the notepad to take everyone's name down for the waitlist. So when they finally opened, we were part of the first large group to be sat. We ordered the tori tatsutage and it was SO FREAKING GOOD! Even the lotus root chips were good! For my ramen I ordered the Akamaru Ramen w/ kakuni. First of all, the black garlic oil is SO FREAKING GOOD! The kakuni was so soft and tasty. The bf went with Shiromaru Ramen and it was good, but definitely not as good as the akamaru ramen. I with they sold that garlic oil stuff. I'd buy a whole case of it! Aside from the food being SO FREAKING GOOD(!!!), I absolutely love the decor. Perfect for a date or a group of friends wanting really great ramen. Pricey? Yeah. Worth every penny? Hell yeah!

How can you NOT give this place 5 stars? You are a celebrity once you are granted a seat. The chefs and employees cheer for you as you walk through the hallway to your seat. AWESOME. definitely perfect for days when you need a pick me upper :) The food absolutely hits the spot. $13 yaku ramen. The broth is delicious. If you haven't done so already, try the fried green peppers. YUMMMO. If you are lucky, you get your own booth, but if you come solo or with a +1, you would most likely be seated at a communal table. Don't be shy, we all like food! There have been times when I'm walked in only to find there is a 45 min wait, or even 1 hr 30 min wait. ÊHint: Come for lunch! Came Tuesday at 1pm and had only a 15 min wait. Worth it and would come back.

4.8 stars! The 2000+ yelp reviews and 4 stars avg speak for itself. Ê I miss you Ippudo! Why must you be 3000 miles away from me... *tears* Ippudo definitely dishes up some solid food set under a fun vibe! ÊI would give them the trophy for the BEST broth. Simply A-MA-ING. Silky smooth, savory, and you can taste the 'umami-ness'. Ê I wish I had the stomach capacity to try their other menu items. ÊAfter devouring their Shiromaru Hakata Classic along with a pork bun, I was at my limit; with only a small corner of stomach space left for dessert at Milkbar (note: I ended up eating dessert at Pan Ya instead b/c Milkbar's desserts were not what I expected and overly sweet). Ê Ê Good place for anyone who wants to just hang out and eat good food. ÊFor groups, make sure you get your entire party there on time. Lol... it's interesting how friends meet up in NY when everyone have to use the public transit to get to places... If I were to live in NY, I'd make sure I live close to Ippudo.

As an avid ramen-fan (I could literally eat it everyday of the week) who has tried numerous places in NY, I must say, Ippudo is hands down, my absolute favorite. It's entirely in a league of its own and you definitely pay for the difference in quality and taste. Although, I personally find ramen to be overpriced in general (considering what you're getting), in the case of Ippudo, it's definitely worth trying at least once. The one thing that sets this place apart from the others (in my opinion) is that their broth doesn't have the overpoweringly fishy taste that many of the other places do. And the noodles have a perfect shape and texture (not too chewy, not too soft). Service is also pretty good. The waitresses here are friendly and personable. However, the major setback is that because it's a small space with such high demand, it's very difficult to get a table/seat. No matter what night you decide to come, this place is pretty much always packed. You'll probably spend more time waiting to be seated than actually having your meal. I came on a Wednesday night with two friends and they told us there was an hour long wait (we chose not to stick around). I almost wanted to take away a star from my rating due to the difficulty in getting a seat here but I figured meh, this place is popular for a reason. And with 1000+ reviews, my rating wasn't gonna make much of a difference anyway.

The restaurant has a really nice interior decor. Which helps when waiting time averages about one hour. The wait wasn't so bad since st marks was nearby for wandering. The bathrooms are downstairs, and leads you pass a room where you can see the ramen noodles are made! Pretty neat. I ordered the Soy ramen. And it was delicious. *Drools. The broth was not as salty as i had anticipated. The duck was just delicious and melts in my mouth. Though you can see fattyness in the broth, IGNORE IT. this is one of the better ramen experiences i have had! I like how they have an option for Extra noodles with the keyword. I mean, often you eat ramen and realize how you wanted more ramen, well now you can! For dessert was Marscapone and green tea ice cream. It had a pie crust bottom, honey glaze on the plate, and chocolate ribbon. This was amazing, somehow marscapone and green tea just blends together so nicely. There was just enough to keep everyone content and not overwhelmed with the sweetness.

There are two reasons why last Saturday was special - 1) It was the first summer-like day of spring! ÊThe overcoats changed into short dresses, the suits into shorts. ÊSullen dispositions turned into broad smiles, and barren roads into street fairs. ÊDark stouts changed into chilled ales, and brandy into mojitos. Ê 2) I finally gathered the patience to wait for a table at Ippudo! Yes, the wait is very long, but I'll say it was more than worth it 'cause I was well and truly blown away. ÊFor appetizers we got chicken wings and the shrimp buns. ÊI am not a regular meat-eater but I was chowing down those wings like a mofo. ÊThere was some kind of glaze on it that was just out of control. ÊI would have given Ippudo 5 stars just based on the wings, but I was forced to consider a 6th star when I took my first bite of ramen noodle soup. Ê I got the "Akamaru Shin - Aji new recipe, ramen noodles, thicker pork broth, berkshire pork chashu, cabbage, scallions." ÊI got the tofu instead of the pork and added a boiled brown egg. ÊThe flavors were just bursting in my mouth. I am no food critic, so I cannot go into details of such intricate flavors. All I can humbly say is, please try it! It changed the way I look at Ramen. ÊEarlier when I saw a packet of ramen, I saw a quick, disgusting meal with no nutrition. ÊNow I see a large bowl of steaming noodle soup that inspired the following comments from my friends: Friend 1: "Oh my god, this is so awesome, I am rethinking brushing my teeth tonight" Friend 2 to the waitress: "Do you have Ippudo t-shirts for sale?" Enough said.

Only reason I am giving it four instead of five is because the wait is kinda ridiculous. The service is topnotch. The food was amazing! I've never eaten ribs with chopsticks before! They just fell off the bone like buttah melting on a hot piece o' toast! Personally, I was more a fan of the appetizers than the noodles. Don't get me wrong though-the noodles were delish! But, the appetizers just set the bar so high that I'd rather go there and order ribs and pork buns than the noodles. Just sayings.

Such a fun place, went during lunchtime, was seated within 10 minutes. Had pork bun, it was very delicious! Different from Momofuku, it has mayonnaise in it.

Ippudo is a very famous ramen chain store in Japan. I have to say when I see it first time in East Village, I was very excited and mean time lol because there was stylish bar counter in the restaurant. A bar counter in Ramen shop?? What is going on? Waiting was about 30 minutes so having a bar is not bad idea in NYC. I was amazed their marketing power to make this place so popular and trendy. Good job Ippudo. I ordered Ippudo Salad, Karaage, Tako wasa and Kokutou Umeshu for my drink. These are delicious. I highly recommend. Here comes the reality. Shoyu ramen we ordered was nothing special. I was very disappointed because it was not much different from I make nama ramen at home. Broth, and ramen noodle were very standard and topping were minimum. I hate to say this but it was better at another Korean restaurant in EV... I give credit for the efforts that they make this place such a trendy place to hang but we are here to eat good Ramen. I think many New Yorkers easily affected by some articles on the some news sources easily. If your tong is well developed you know what I'm talking about. ÊAlso, don't get me wrong, personal preference in firmness of the ramen noodle and soup broth just didn't much with mine. Ê ÊYou may like it.

Tried another one of the Ramens - the Akamaru. ÊTasted pretty similar to the Shiomaru. The steamed Bershire pork buns (2 for $9?) were very good. ÊA little bigger than those at Momofuku but prefer the sauce at Momofuku. ÊI think they sneak mayo into it here (they love mayo here). The pickles appetizer was kind of interesting.

What's all this hype about? Fine, the broth is "flavorful", the atmosphere is classy for a ramen place. But really, it's just ramen. I thought Momofuku was disappointing, but this -- this was REALLY just okay. Maybe I expected too much. Maybe I just like to defy my friends' opinions and go the opposite way. Whatever it was, the noodle just wasn't anything special. At least I got my eggie in my bowl of ramen at Momofuku. The quantity and quality of the pork was also surprisingly better there (even though I didn't think so at that moment). I can't believe I paid 16 bucks for 4 pieces of flimsy meat drowned in MSG (How do I know? The itis effect was pretty apparent afterwards). I thought I would finish off the infamous broth, but no. For once in my life, I was the first to say "yes I'm done" to the waitress so that she could take away this mediocre bowl of disappointment. I'll give it another chance one day when I don't have to wait 1hr+ for a table.

Ippudo, Minca, Ramen Setagaya..? at this point I think the "personal taste" is a critical component when you try to rate Ramen places. Guess there is bad ones (which luckily I haven't try yet) but along the good ones difficult to say which is the best. My list, pretty short. Keep this on mind and I'm European... meaning that, unfortunately, Ramen is a miss in my country. Among Hakata, Ramen Setagaya and Ippudo, although all are really good, I vote for Ippudo. ÊYou can choose 6 different Ramen and combine it with 6 toppings. Choices apart, the noodles are exceptional at Ippudo. Fresh look and taste and perfectly cooked. The broth is the heart of the dish and characterize different ramen dishes and I think is where your "personal taste" plays the game. I have try 3 different so far at Ippudo. I really like the Shoyu Ramen with spicy sauce. So good. Very rich flavor, but delicate at the same time. And the spicy sauce gives an amazing touch. I really love it. The Shiromaru Hakata classic and the Tori Ramen was really good as well although Tori was over-porkish flavor. Portions are huge. I never can finished it, barely half of my dish, but even my friends with bigger appetite than mine can't finished as well. I find out little over pricey but is really good so not a complaining at all Ramen apart....there is more food there? of course and its also good. But at this point I have to say is pricey. Tiny portions, some extremely good dishes, but most of them are just good that doesn't worth the price. The Agedashi Tofu is really good, little bit salty. The Hirata Chicken Wings also good and the Hiyayakko In original Broth very very interesting. If you like Soba you must order this. Too tasty for me but is good and original. I also tried an day special consisting in Sashimi tuna with wasabi sauce. It was amazing. Japan in a plate I'd say. Finally, food apart, the ambiance is nice, relaxing, comfortable. Cool deco, I really like it. Service is good, they are extremely busy and you will notice. Good for groups if you prepare in advance (make a reservation early in the afternoon so you can skip the lines). Excellent friend's group spot for dinner. But tables are for 6-8ppl max, if your group is bigger they will split in 2 separate tables. I already miss it....

Ahhh Ippudo. Now that I no longer live in New York I dream about Ippudo. They have simply the best ramen. Whenever friends and family came to visit me in New York...first things first...Ippudo! If Êyou go at a normal time for lunch/dinner, you have to wait forever for a table. And on weekends...literally FOREVER. Not sure if this is a pro/con but you might also have to share a table. For me this was a pro since I met new friends who recommended me to other fabulous ramen joints. Of course none compared to Ippudo! When people generally think of ramen they think of those dried packaged noodles but there are people making fresh noodles at Ippudo. The noodles at Ippudo are what get me!

I came here while on vacation knowing this was one of the few four star ramen places around. ÊTurns out, my friends and family in NYC all love this place. ÊWe waited a really long time to get a table - long enough that I was able to walk around the entire neighborhood for an hour, go to Crumbs for a drink and still had to wait outside for our table. ÊThis place is really trendy and you can tell by the cool little ramen countertop they have. ÊReally though, does a ramen place have to look like a nightclub and be the loudest place on earth? ÊI did the untrendy thing and brought my little baby. ÊLuckily, she likes loud noises and fell asleep easily. The food was decent. ÊWe had the pork buns which was good and I ate the charred miso ramen. ÊI have to admit the ramen was pretty decent and had lots of other surprises in it which made it just a tad more filling. The one thing that irritated me was that people seated after us got their food before us. ÊI really get annoyed by that and saw the SAME tourists I saw at Serendipity who got their food before us there getting their food before us again at Ippudo! ÊI'd probably come back here next time if I didn't have to wait so long for some noodles!

BRING YOUR OWN TUPPERWARE. Not worth the hour wait, the overpriced menu, the attitude, loud atmospher and the fact that they won't allow you to take any of your remaining ramen soup home. Ê I was raised in Hawaii and ate a whole helluva lot of ramen growing up and i always take home part of my ramen to eat for breakfast the next day. ÊSetagaya, Rai Rai Ken, Kambi - all in East village, all appeal to my little Polynesian quirk nicely, thank you very much. ÊBut NOOOOOOOOOO uppity, noisy, attitude ridden Ippudo tells me that they don't have any such vessel for me to transport the remainder of my soup home in because reheating will jepordize the quality of it.

Put our name on the list for a party of 6 around 8pm. There were SO many people waiting and finally got a table an hour later. The hostesses were super nice and always had a smile when we asked how much longer our wait was. The pork bun was delicious - though it does look like the chinese pork bun they serve in restaurants, I felt that the meat was more tender, and it had a more americanized spinoff. Pretty delicious but not out of this world. The bun seemed freshly made. Got the Akamaru Modern as suggested by other yelpers and the broth was delicious. The traditional #1 meal had broth that was more pork flavored and tasted like Daikokuya back in LA. I wasn't too impressed with the noodles as they were a bit harder than what I was accustomed to, however, when you eat it you can tell it was fresh. You can order extra noodles for $2, which is a small bowl's worth. They recommend you order it after you've finished your noodles so that it's still fresh, versus damp and hard after it's sat in the bowl. Our waitress was very short with us and gave us attitude, but I'm assuming it was just her personality and that it's not the same for other patrons. Ramen is something I can get in LA, so I wouldn't recommend coming here if you want to experience NY. Perhaps a lunch here as I heard that the lunch wait is much shorter than dinner.

I was never into this search for the ultimate ramen place....until I got to NYC. ÊThis place has indeed one of the best ramen I've tasted in a while. ÊHow and WHAT makes a bowl of ramen so damn good? ÊIs it the milky broth with its texture and flavor? ÊIs it the perfectly soft yet firm noodles that go into each bowl? ÊIs it the mildly hot but just enough to blow once and slurp it all up? ÊOr is it that extra thin slices of Chasu that accompanies the bowl, depending on what you order? ÊI might have to say, in this case, it's all of those. ÊIppudo managed to excel at each and every one of those characteristics in a good bowl of ramen. We had dinner here on a saturday night and the wait was a little long. ÊI got to grab a few beers at the bar, but once our names were called, it was gametime. ÊWe had the agadashi tofu, pork chasu bun, which was really tasty. Ê I had the special ramen with fish and chicken broth, my friends had the classic and modern chasu, and another was daring to go for the black halloween...ballsy. This place has a wait, but honestly, its worth it in the end.

I admit, I haven't tried many elite NY ramen places other than Setagaya and Momofuku noodle. So you may take this review with a grain of salt. The wait is pretty remarkable (typically 1hr) for Ippudo - we had enough time to go to SoHo and shop while we waited for our table. The bar is also a good option - you can grab a few beers and snack on appetizers, namely the pork buns. The pork buns are delish; however, my vote is for David Chang's version. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the broth is pure savory goodness. You can get add'l servings of noodles, provided you have enough broth and a healthy appetite. Every time I go, my friends and I barely talk at all, cuz we're busy slurping and slurping away. That's the sign of a gooooood bowl of ramen!

First of all....way better than momofuko! That place is way over rated, and over priced now. This is now my go to ramen house when I take ppl from out of town to eat. Its big and modern inside. Super friendly staff! Gotta get the pork buns. Those are by far my fave. The pork is really tender and melt in ur mouth great! I also love the fried peppers with yuzu salt, its so simple but yet so good. All the ramen is great. Can't really go wrong. Staff is very tentative about clearing plates and keeping the table clean (which is a big plus for me...a clean table makes for happy eaters) fun vibe with and open kitchen. Did I mention the space. Not like the average NYC restaurant where and party of more than 4 is impossible to be sat...this place is big and comfortable. So next time u feel like going to momo-fu walk a few block down and check out this spot...u might love it

Ohhhh Ippudo, what can I say except there is nothing more suited for a cold Fall or Winter day. The noodles here are homemade and always fresh and amazing. Find an excuse to go downstairs to use the bathroom and you'll see the little square room where the guy sits and make them from scratch. PROS - EVERYTHING, the staff, the atmosphere, the food, the accommodations, they will cater to your spicy flavor, I personally LOVE it spicy and spicy it was! CONS- This place is not very vegetarian/vegan friendly. I once ordered a meal that appeared to be vegetarian but it turned out most of their broths are made with beef or these little pork pieces. Also, only come here if you have time to wait. I've been here over 5 times and each time we waited 30 - 60 mins or more to be seated.

The very definition of "It's aiiight." New York, being the hype capital of the world - yes, we are all suckered by it in one way or another; never deny it! - has way more than its share of establishments that fall far shorter than where their reputation projects. ÊIppudo may the Encarta definition of the sad incongruence between hype and product. $4 for a piece of pork bun? ÊHahahaha. ÊIs joke, right? ÊNo? ÊOh. ÊI still have to pay? ÊFine. ÊBut never again. As for the Ramen, sure, it tastes good. ÊBut is it anything special? ÊNo. ÊIs it better than Rai Rai Ken http://www.yelp.com/biz/É? ÊNo. ÊIs it better than Minca?

It's still the best ramen I've had in the city...but thank heavens it's in the East Village, of else I wouldn't know what to do with the an hour and a half long wait on a Friday night! ...but then again, sucks that it's in the East Village, because all you see around are tempting food joints and bars! They have never let me down with the food, but this time, I ordered a Cherry Blossom, which tasted like cough syrup I had to return it for a regular glass of plum wine :( We were seated exactly 1.5 hours later at a long table and there was this point of time that I was sooooo APPALLED by this girl and her boyfriend who were sitting across from us....She poured her water into her AKAMARU Êramen!!! ....WHY? Because she thought the broth was TOO HOT?????????? OMG, omg omg..I didn't now what to say, but I knew I had to say something!! ....I opted for: "I can't believe you just did that!" #_# Anyhow, still the best ramen in the city!

I love Ippudo! My best friend brought me here when I was hankering for ramen after our trip to Tokyo a few years ago. It's some of the best stuff I've ever eaten, anywhere. Be sure to get the pork bun appetizer -- it is so delicious! Any of the sake cocktails are worth trying too.

Hell to the yeah, Ippudo rules! The pork broth is just so.. freaking.. good. I had the akamaru ramen and the pork buns. Both were incredibly delicious. I could pretty much drink the pork broth all by itself. As others have said, this is possibly the best ramen in the US. If I lived closer I would come here once a week.

IPPUDO! ÊIPPUDO! ÊIPPUDO! Ê Long lines, dark lighting, noisy crowd, and overpriced ramens (i swear for my $13 dollar ramen, they probably make $12.50 profit....Ippudo, come on) YOU know as well as I do that the BROTH costs nothing when you make it for thousands of people and YOU know the noodles cost like 10 cents a person... But all this does not change my love for Ippudo because no experience ever beats a nice soothing broth going down your stomach as you chew your noodles, vegetables and pork belly at the same time. Ê Their pork belly is the best i've had in the field of japanese ramens. ÊNo joke, it MELTS in your mouth. ÊIt's like pork belly chocolate or something...it's unreal. Ê Next time u visit NYC, circle Ippudo as a MUST-Go-AND-Stuff-My-Face restaurant.

Instead of simply repeating what everyone else is saying/typing, just do yourself a favor and GO! I'm super picky when it comes to Japanese and Korean Cuisine, especially the "simpler" dishes like SOBA.... If I had one meal left one earth, I would really have to debate on Ippudo, it is simply that good. Actually, not good, GREAT.

Expensive ramen, limited choices, best value is the dessert I went here on their soft open on Friday 3/28. But before I begin, I hope the 5 star reviews of the place before it even opened gets taken off. Those should not be considered as reviews, more like ads for the upcoming restaurant which is now fully opened. On their soft open, they had a huge crowd of people lining up waiting to try out their ramen. I'm glad me and my friends went a bit early (7 ish). Since a couple of my friends were showing up late, My 2 other friends and I decide to order some side dishes first, as their menus don't have any appetizer. We ordered the Kushi Katsu with Dips and a Tonkatsu Coquette. The portions were so small you think you stepped into a French restaurant. Then when my other friends arrive, we ordered another side dish, forgot what it was, just remembered that it was again, small, so I ended up having a veggie from the dish instead of the meat. So let's get to the ramen. They had 5 different ramens on their menu, we had 5 ppl there, so we ordered 1 of each. Each ramen is at least $12 and tops off at $16. If you saw my review of Rockmeisha (one of my first as a yelper), you know I hate over-paying for food that isn't suppose to be expensive. Anyway, back to the ramen, I like the pork ramen classic, and the pork ramen original, both of a really delicious broth that tasted that great with the Ênoodles. Its a bit more flavorful in salt than Rockmeisha, but nowhere overboard like Men Kui Tei. I also like the cold noodle which had Êthe broth served separately. I like the tangy spicy flavor of that broth. The Shoyu ramen was the most lacking, as that's probably the cheapest broth to make. Also, we should have definitely order $2 more worth of noodles, as I was still hungry and really wanted dessert after wards. I got the Matcha Brulee (Creme Brulee w/ a green tea twist). For $7, you get a Creme brulee with a side of ice cream that has slices of apple on top. Of all the dishes, that's only one that you getting your money's worth. I didn't even get into how much the side dishes cost earlier ($12). The Matcha Brulee was quite delicious, and it was a saving grace for Ippudo. Overall, the restaurant is nice, has a very good ambiance, but the food was quite expensive (except for the dessert), especially for its location (a few blocks off St. Marks). You can easily hop on over to other Japanese restaurants in the area and get a much bigger portion. Also, on their website, they say "Ramen is Japan's soul food." Well, how do they explain themselves for charging $12 - $16 for a bowl of ramen when the ingredients are probably 1/10 of that cost? P.S. Don't forget they charge $6 per beer. Is this St. Marks or midtown? The bill came out to $180 w/ tip for 5 people. That's quite steep for a ramen shop.

I found this place after someone had suggested it under Menchanko Tei 's mediocre reviews.. ÊThank goodness they did because I think I've found my new favorite restaurant in New York. ÊI was craving Japanese noodle soup and this place does not disappoint. ÊI had Akumara Modern and it had hands down the most flavorful broth I've ever tasted! ÊPork was very tender, the soft boiled egg absorbed the flavors and complemented the soup beautifully. Pork rolls were great as an app. The only downside is I might go broke from multiple visits! -- it is on the pricy side but this is one case where you definitely get what you pay for. ÊAlso they do kind of rush you along because it gets busy, though be sure you won't be waiting long for food! Ramen as we know it (ie the 10 cent variety) and Ippudo do NOT belong in the same sentence! Ê:)

So whenever I pop the cherry of taking someone to Ippudo for the first time, I always tell them the following: "I don't want hype this place up. ÊUsually when I eat at places that have so much hype, I'm always disappointed. Ê Its like I expect this meal that makes me want to say I could just die right now and be happy, but its never the case. ÊHowever, this is one place where there was so much hype and when I left the restaurant, I felt like it lived up to it" Now the review of the dishes: The ramen is of course what you need to get. ÊThe presentation in the variety of bowls is a nice touch but you came here to satisfy your 2000% daily intake of sodium and you shall receive. ÊThe noodles are what really makes the dish though. ÊIts perfectly chewy, and hand made! ÊThe pork slices are just fatty enough and literally melts in your mouth. ÊI had both the tonkotsu flavored soup and the salt flavor. ÊThe tonkotsu is a real hearty and thick broth that is perfect for a post-hangover meal. ÊThe salt flavor isn't that sallty as one would think and has more of a light, broth. ÊIf i were to use an analogy for you americans on consistency: tonkotsu = campbells chunky soup salt = chicken stock The appetizers are great as well. ÊThe steamed pork buns are a must order. Ê The prices are expensive but I think its worth it and not too unreasonable. ÊSkip on alcohol, wine, all of that. ÊGo to saint marks for that. ÊJust eat a nice satisfying meal and spread the hype!

So I went here with my Dad, who hasn't had ramen since he was last in Japan some ten years ago. ÊI was excited about trying this place, especially since I had heard about it from other Japanese tourists. ÊIt always seems to be busy so we thought we would try it out. ÊMy dad and I only waited 20 min (short wait on the weekend for this place) and were promptly seated. ÊThe decor is amazing, and it's evident how much money was put into this restaurant when it opened. Ê Both of us ordered the Miso Ramen, I added tamago (egg) to mine for $1 or so extra. ÊThe food came in 10-15 min. ÊThe broth was intense.....it was extremely rich and as my dad said "just how real ramen broth should be." ÊI wasn't expecting much from this place but I had to admit that the broth was good. ÊWhat wasn't so exceptional was the noodles. ÊI know that I haven't traveled to Japan yet but I know what good ramen noodles are like and this wasn't it. ÊSo as a caveat, be warned that the noodles are somewhat strange in texture. ÊAlmost overly gummy and rubbery in my opinion. ÊIt resembled soy ramen noodles if anyone has ever tried it. Ê However, my dad was very pleased and he is a tough crowd for food in general. Ê Ordering a bowl of this ramen or any other noodle dish is sufficient for a hungry appetite. ÊI was SO full. ÊHowever, i did manage to find room to try their green tea creme brulee. ÊIt was what i expected and it was done well but i prefer regular creme brulee. Overall I would come back to try the buns they offered on the menu and to explore some other dishes and desserts that seemed curious. Ê Was it worth it???? Well the place was a little overpriced for ramen $13 (known as a Japanese street food equivalent to how the Vietnamese view pho) and the wait can be extreme but you have to try some things once, even if it is on the list of trendy NYC restaurants to visit. ÊJust beware of weekends and the crowded lobby with the smallest saddest little bar.

So far, I've been to Ippudo twice. ÊBoth times I went, pretty much a long wait. ÊI would say, 30-40 minutes? ÊHowever, the bar is pretty cool to hang around, and they do have a 2 for 1 Sapporo on draft happy hour special. ÊBut only for the bar. I loved the decor. ÊI love how you can see the ramen chefs make the ramen. ÊAlso, the bar area with all the different japanese ramen plates. ÊI wish I could decorate my room like that. Ê(my boyfriend suggested I do so) I think I read what Jen W. wrote about the bunch of white people greeting you in Japanese thing.. yea that kinda weirded me out too. ÊAlso, I completely agree with.. why do they have like a million workers there? ÊNot that it has anything to do with the food though... I had the pork buns, just to see how it compares to Ssam-bar's. ÊIt was pretty damn good I would say.. i liked the crunch from the lettuce. ÊI also had the special fried fish buns, it tasted exactly the same as the pork (same marinade) but of course that it was fried and it was fish. Ê I'd say go with the pork. Ê I tried the Wasabi ramen- loved loved loved the bowl. ÊFor me though, I'm alwayss and always have been the traditional ramen type of girl. ÊWhen i say traditional, its the plain pork milky broth with pieces of pork and pickled ginger. ÊThis was a very good modern ramen dish though, I enjoyed it very much. ÊThe noodles were perfectly cooked. My boyfriend had the akamaru modern, which was the 'original' one with garlic oil. ÊIt was pretty good but.. i don't think anything special of it. Ê I asked what was the most traditional one (the one with the milky pork broth that I like), and they did have it. ÊThe Shiromaru classic. ÊIt was pretty good.. but i think a little too oily and salty. ÊIt was good.. but not better then other ramens I had in the past. Also, uhm.. why is this place so pricey? ÊGeez it's only ramen.

What can I say... ÊBest Ramen outside Japan? I don't know for sure... but it was good, very good. The broth flavor transcends your mouth to another place.. far far away from the mad trendy crowds and load burst of Japanese welcoming each new customer. These guys know there stuff, and everyone seems to know it. I can hold the 100 min wait against them... they are popular, that's fine. We put our name in and went to get a drink, came back and had a beer at their bar, watched the bartender squeeze grapefruits... she is good. We tried both the classic and the Akamaru Modern... Both were outstanding... I think I preferred the classic though. Nice pieces of pork belly floating upon a greasy white broth. I can honestly say, these soups made me some how drunk. I felt in a warm cozy place for another hour after leaving the restaurant. 14$ each... Worth the wait if you plan accordingly.

I coulda sworn i commented about Ippudo already, if i did here's another. ÊIt's no Daikokuya (http://www.yelp.com/biz/É) but it's a lot closer. ÊThose that have said this is better than Dai, mmmm as the kids would say FAIL! Yes i did give a plug of another ramen place on the other side of the country close to another ocean called the Pacific. Now back to Ippudo. ÊCome here around "normal" eating hours and prepare to way 2 hours, if you're lucky. ÊRamen's good but the 2+ hour wait makes it less tasty and @ $16 a bowl, it's not helping either. ÊAnother item to try is the pork buns. ÊThen if you're a real foodie, head on over to David Chang's Momofuku and see which you like better :) there'e your little food tour tip of the day.

There's so damn many good reviews of this place I could take a single word out of each post and construct a glowing review. ÊI'm not going to do that because it's pointless and I'm lazy, but see the larger point: there's a bazillion positive reviews of Ippudo, and I agree with them. I slurped and suckled the Kogashi Miso and Akamaru Modern, which were about as similar as a Mac and a PC. ÊThe Kogashi is a brute, mean ramen that barges into your mouth, punches your tongue a few times, and then leaves without fanfare. ÊThe Akamaru gracefully slides onto your palette, redecorates the place over the course of 20 seconds, and leaves it more beautiful than before it arrived. The atmosphere is wild. ÊServers scamper about like those square little Star Wars droids that rolled around the Death Star, only the servers scream "Onegai Shimasu!" every few seconds. ÊAn enormous bamboo burst looms over huge, communal wooden tables. ÊThis seating setup lends itself to large groups, which guzzle and cheer with aplomb. Ê If you're in the mood to wait, and you will wait, Êjust go for it. ÊThe ramen has depths of sophistication unmatched by the other staples around the village.

As much as I hate to admit this being a devoted Angeleno and all, NY has better ramen than LA. I've scoured my entire hometown too for the best: Santouka for their succulent cha shu; Shin-Sen-Gumi for their rich, customizable broth and noodles; and Daikokuya for overall best-in-show. I thought I got it all figured out... until I tried the wondrous brew that is the Ippudo Akamaru Modern. I have my friend in New York to thank for this stunting revelation. He took me there during my visit to The Big Apple and told me this was simply the best. I scoffed at first, but after seeing the intense line out front, I kept my mouth shut and followed his lead and in turn had the greatest ramen to date. I took detailed notes and here are the golden rules to follow for the best possible experience at Ippudo. Rule No. 1 Go during odd hours during weekdays--unless you derive pleasure from waiting in long lines. Excellent times are early lunch and during the golden period called "Linner." If you must go at peak hours, don't wait outside like the uninformed, but enjoy a cold one at their ramen covered bar instead. Rule No. 2 Once you get seated, order their pork belly buns as an appetizer and share with a friend--you won't regret this. Now, they say Momofuku has the best pork buns in the biz, but I beg to differ. Although theirs is stellar, Ippudo's buns are even better. Reason is that they're more generous with their pork. Sandwiched between delicate steamed buns are hefty slices of unctuous, tender hog belly bathed in a sweet and spicy sauce. On top is just the right amount of crisp lettuce for texture and a dab of mayo. That, my friends, makes for the perfect sandwich. Rule No. 3 Get the Akamaru Modern and enjoy. No need to scour their lengthy menu, because this is king. The AM has the original soup base, but they spiked it with a spoonful of what I like to call, "MSG NOS." The reason being is that no one knows for sure what's in this paste other than miso and roasted garlic, but that is what gives the AM its superstar status. And oh yes, don't forget to ask for garlic. Raw cloves comes with a press--put one in your ramen and let it steep for a minute. It adds a different dimension to the ramen. The AM hits you like an expensive perfume with clear top and base notes. First, you can taste the fresh scallions, springy noodles (made in-house no less) and crisp wood ear mushrooms. Then you really taste the pork, both in its material form and its essence in the soup. It's strong, yet delicate at the same time with no greasy aftertaste, unlike Santouka brew. Daikokuya's soup is flavorful, but it lacks that balance that Ippudo is so skillful in accomplishing. Also, Daikokuya also use milk in their soup, which always gives me a stomachache afterwards (I'm cursed with lactose intolerance). It's so good I went back on my own a week later just before my flight home. Now you know the rules... get a plane ticket and start eating!

I have been dying to go to Ippduo. Since my friends aren't down with a $14 bowl of ramen and waiting in a long line for it, I went by myself. I got there are 1PM on a Sunday. 10 min wait for a party of 1. I had just picked up the menu when they called me to sit down. A table for two who put their names before me were quoted 20-30 minutes, so it is definitely an advantage to come alone. The decor is very nice. There was a bamboo "tree" in the middle of the room. It's actually quite small considering how popular the place is. I like the communal seating. Others might not, but its not that cramped that you're bumping elbows. All the workers scream in Japanese to each other. It adds to the atmosphere. I didn't find it annoying at all. So the food. I got the hirata buns like everyone recommended. It was a nice appetizer. I think 1 bun would not have been enough. It is served very similar to peking duck in Chinese restaurants. I thought it was really fatty. I guess that's just the nature of the beast. The bread was nice and sweet. Steamed fresh but I don't know if they made it in house though. I liked the appetizer a lot, but for $8, I think I'll pass the next time I come to Ippudo (Definitely coming back, with or without friends). That's actually a big deal for me cuz I don't like to go eating alone. Ramen: This month's special was "Kasane Aji" It is described as "Ramen noodle layered in 'Tori-paitan' creamy chicken and tonkatsu soup topped with pork chashu, bean sprouts, onion, 1/2 seasoned boiled egg, kikurage, scallions, & yazu kosho" The presentation was nice. The aroma was wonderful. I always taste the noodles and soup separately when I eat ramen & pho . So the broth was cloudy, not translucent at all. I could still see the fat glistening on the top. It was incredibly flavorful, not too salty and not too greasy (one of my pet peeves). The noodles were definitely fresh. The texture was good, it was cooked well. I was in ramen heaven. My only gripe is that they don't put enough goodies in the soup. I only got two small pieces of pork and 1/2 an egg. $2 a pop for add-ins would make this really expensive. I opted not to get a second order of noodles because I was going crazy on the broth. It WAS that good. When I come back, I'd definitely consider ordering seconds of the noodles, but then I'd have to be stingy with the broth. Not really my style. And I don't like to pay for extra add-ins. There should be enough of everything so that you don't need to add anything at all. Regardless, that's their business model for making money and I respect that. This place was amazing. Best in NY hands down. It is pricey, but it is worth it. If you are a ramen fiend, you must come here. It won't leave you stuffed, but you'll definitely feel satisfied.

Ramen has become such a big trend in NYC. There are literally a ramen house in very corner in Manhattan. Ippudo happens to be one of the better know ramen place in the city. I've heard all the raves, and I couldn't wait to try it. My friend (who live in Chelsea) had never been here either. We came with some excitement, but left the place with slight disappointment. Although we only ordered ramen, it was the "best ramen ever," or "even great ramen." It was simply ok. The broth is definitely on the saltier side. I guess the it's really not about the food, it's about how they advertise themselves.

I have been to Japan and have had some of the finest Ramen an American tourist could ever have. ÊI think this place does it well, though I think it is a little bit spendy for just a bowl of noodles. ÊSure its gourmet, but I swear this stuff is cheaper in Tokyo. ÊAnd that city makes NYC look stupidly cheap by comparison. It was a great date night between my old lady and I, this place was glitzy and a nice change of pace from all of the other Italian joints that I hit up all the time.

Yet another Yelp rating exaggeration. Ê I had the Akamaru ramen. ÊLook, here's the 411: it's good ramen. ÊIt is not great ramen. ÊFor $14, your ramen should not only taste like no ramen you've ever had, it should give you personalized dating advice for six minutes. Ê Here's the slurp on the ramen: the flavors were good. ÊThe pork was the star. ÊIt was fatty, buttery, full of porky goodness. ÊUnfortunately, there were only two slices of it in my bowl. ÊAnd truthfully, I feel like a ramen house should make a star out of the ramen, not the pork. ÊIf you name your establishment after a dish and over price the items, it should do justice to its namesake. Next time, I'm going to try Rai Rai Ken. Ê$8 for a bowl of ramen, well-reviewed, and a full house when I walked passed.

I'm a big fan of ramen and so its only necessary that I write a review for Ippudo NY bc the ramen was pretty damn amazing. It was 9:30 at night and we waited a good 45 minutes...but the food def. made up for it! The decor is quite interesting with its usual samurai pictures up on the wall...however what caught my attention was the wall display of ramen bowls; a great foreshadowing of what deliciousness was to come! At $13 a bowl, the ramen isn't cheap...but the taste...oh man...great flavor i tell you! We also ordered the pork belly which i was a little disappointed in. 3 pieces for 9 bucks. seriously now?! Only in NY. Anyways, back to the ramen, what was interesting about the bowl full of goodness, was that the noodles weren't actually ramen noodles, but instead thin noodles. It added a different element to the dish and made it THAT much better. A definite place to check out...be prepared for the wait but you'll enjoy the rewards of a full and satisfied stomach in the end.

Writing this probably doesn't significantly change the general consensus on this place, but I must write it anyway. It's a world renown ramen chain featuring the top two original dishes, Akamaru Ramen and the Shiromaru Ramen. I thought I'd fall in love with the tonkatsu base Shiromaru Ramen, but in fact, I was won over by the Akamaru Ramen, as I'm a fan of the spicy dishes that add a nice kick to the flavors. They're both delicious and a constant favorite. They manage to retain a long line of customers even during a recession and at a premium price. The portions are just barely sufficient, but that's how they get you; they charge you a couple dollars if you want extra noodles. What would be fascinating is to compare the flavors of Ippudo NY with Ippudo in Japan. According to the founder, Shigemi Kawahara, the tastes are quite distinct as different ingredients are used in each country due to import restrictions on certain types of foods such as different tastes in water and a different type of flour used for the noodles. Highly recommended!

Think you want Ramen for dinner?? Plan ahead. There is a 2 hour wait and there is no getting around it. My girl friends came early, checked in, shopped around, waited for me to arrive and we still had to wait about 30 minutes for our table. Like I said, plan ahead. On to the 5 stars: Drinks. The bar tender will not let you down. I had one of the mixed specialties with gin and sake and was totally blown away. Pork buns: You must try these. I could eat a plate full for dinner myself. Ramen: Delicious. Worth the wait. Bravo. Words in this description box cannot describe the party I had in my mouth. Come and try. Ambiance: I swear my ipod was on shuffle. Did I drop it on my way in? No. They just have bomb taste in music. Portis head, The Knife, Thievery Corp and so many more chill beats. I will wait another 2 hours as soon as I land in NYC with a smile on my face and a delicious drink in my hand.

Good environment, simple but friendly service. But the quality/price ratio is too low. I ordered the number 1 on the menu, the hakata classic "set". I chose the rice with roasted pork as the "side". The rice arrived first, which I did not prefer, I prefer to eat all dishes simultaneously. It is a very small bowl of rice (appetizer size) with very few slices of pork and a bowl of some leafs. I mix the leafs and the rice together and finished it in 3 bites, nothing special. The noodle came, the bowl is very big, but the inside, not much content. soup is very thick, noodles are good texture, but the pork is not tender, and dry like wood. I finished the noodles in 4 bites, the soup is tasty because of MSG's. Total cost is 18 dollars. Afterwards, I went to Chinatown's Dumpling house and ate another 8 dumplings, because I was not full at all. This place is good for petite-bourgeouis who want to be very fashionable. But for filling stomach, it is poor.

I came here really hungry and almost left after I was told that the wait was going to be an hour and 15 minutes, but me and my party ended up waiting for only 15 minutes. =) We started out with Hirata buns and some spicy tofu dish. The Hirata buns were really good, but they were small and came with only 2 buns per order, and that's 8 buckaroos for 2 small buns. The spicy tofu on the other hand, was super worth it! It was the best thing I had that night. For entree, we had Akamaru Modern ramen and some ramen of the day. Ippudo's ramen noodle are very good, they're the perfect size, not too thin and not too thick, not too hard and not too soft. Akamaru Modern ramen has the perfect balanced garlic taste. Our waiter checked up on us and made sure our needs were met. Our water was constantly being refilled and finished dished were being taken away quickly. I would definitely come here again for ramen when I'm in NYC! One star off for the high prices.

I would enjoy Ippudo a lot more if I didn't have to wait an hour everytime for a table, and pay so much for noodles and soup. ÊYou hear that Ippudo? ÊYet another yelp minion giving you a hard time on the usual. I'm not sure if I'm just so hungry when I finally sit down and anything will taste like rainbows in my mouth, but the Shishito (deep-fried japanese peppers) for $7.00 is the ShiSHITo. ÊIt comes with this amazing salt (I love my salt) that my friends and I were dipping our fingers into, long after the peppers were devoured. The first time I went, I ordered the Shiromaru Hakata Classic for $13, and was pleasantly full afterwards. ÊThe broth wasn't too fatty, and the noodles were definitely nomnom. However, last time I went, I ordered the Szechuan style ramen for $14 which came with a peanut oil and was way too salty, even for me. ÊYou'll need a firehose in your mouth after consuming this.

It took me and my pals 2 hours to get a table for 6 at Ippudo... was it worth it? Sure! It wasn't as if we were actually waiting at the door or at the bar all that time. (We found a more interesting spot around Astor Pl. to loiter.) Considering the high-priced fare that the Big Apple usually has to offer, Ippudo's a bargain. A real crowd-pleaser. Even the vegetarian in our group enjoyed his meal! Our group shared Hirata buns (pork buns) that were good, but not the most delicious I've ever had (I've had many)... but the ramen? I ordered the Akamaru Modern ('The original tonkotsu' soup noodle with Ippudo's special sauce, pork belly chashu, cabage, kikurage, scallions, miso paste & fragrant garlic oil) topped with an extra egg. Oh, wow! Don't know if it was the weather (it was super cold out), my tummy (it was empty), simply the noodles (the texture of the noodles! the flavor of the broth!) or a combination of all three, but I was able to polish off my entire bowl o' noodles like THAT! So satisfying... I really am not a ramen fan. But I am a fan of Ippudo.

Went to this joint again (my fifth time). I feel like the broth is not as thick and delicious as before. I don't know if i had too much ippudo that i can't enjoy it anymore, but i think the broth is a bit different. But the buns are still delicious. The chicken wings are also not bad.

Went for lunch on Monday, got there before it opened at 11am, and there was already a line. The place was full within 10 minutes of opening. Definitely will come back again to try more items on their menu!

Ippudo NY is tucked onto a somewhat random block, with a simple and humble exterior from streetside. I was meeting a girlfriend for dinner and got there about 15 mins early, but was pleasantly surprised by the cute izakaya-like bar nook awaiting me in the entrance area. Cold pints of Asahi and Kirin Ichiban on tap... Êhello, yes please! ÊI put our names down and was told the wait would be ~30 min, grabbed my frosty Asahi and plopped down on one of the benches. My friend arrived shortly after and we happily sipped our beers while waiting. And waiting. And waiting... Ê Since we were a party of 2, I think we happened to get seated quicker but we still had to wait nearly 45 min (on a Tuesday night!). Luckily, my friend and I were both in chipper moods and looked forward to the food ahead. Upon entering the main dining floor we were immediately greeted by shouts of "Irrashyaimase!!" and led to our table. The decor is fun and funky, but more of a young trendy lounge feel than the kind of purist decor I'm used to -- the music is bumping and the energy is high, so probably not the first place you'd want to take mom & dad but perfect for getting your grub on with good friends or a date night. We both ordered the Wasabi Shoyu Ramen ($15) and my friend added a healthy side of deliciously fatty pork belly on the side. We agreed on the Hamachi Carpaccio ($13) as our poison to start off the meal. The carpaccio wasn't my favorite but it was light, fresh and an interesting spin with the dollop of wasabi and crisp scallion on top. The slices of fish were quite thin and small and I have to admit I was disappointed that only 5 small pieces appeared on our plate. The gay couple sitting next to us had ordered the Yamitsuki Goma Kyuri ($8) and raved it was the best app in the joint, so maybe give that a try but for me, as a Korean, fresh cucumber with sesame oil drizzled across is nothing new or special. Finally, our ramen arrived and... ÊI was delighted that it resembled, smelled and tasted quite a lot like the true ramen houses I was spoiled with while living in Seoul not too long ago. The noodles were cooked to just the right firmness, and the flavors were balanced nicely between salt, savor and that extra kick of pork goodness. Presentation of food was just as hip and fun as the restaurant itself, and I will definitely be coming back here again! Note - I don't think people should come in with too high expectations because while this place IS good, if you're a hardcore ramen purist, it's still nothing like the authentic stuff you can buy basically anywhere from a street vendor in Osaka or Tokyo. Nevertheless, we're in Manhattan and this place is a pretty fantastic substitute. Go and you will enjoy. Want to try next time: ÊAgedashi Tofu Yasai Ankake ($10)

Wow wow wow! ÊIppudo is AWESOME! ÊIt's rare that I would still love a place after waiting 2 hours for a table. ÊBut this place is well worth it. Ê The pork buns are really that good! ÊFatty pork cooked with some special sauce and then wrapped in the softest asian bun. ÊLove it! ÊThis dish is so popular that they have a chef dedicated to making this dish only. Ê We also tried the fried burock root. ÊIt was good. ÊI liked the contrast in texture from the crunchy fried outside to the chewy root inside. Ê For noodles, I got the Shiromaru original and husband got the Special, which was Kasane Aji. ÊBoth were super super delicious. ÊThe soup base was so flavorful. ÊVery nice miso flavor for the shiromaru without being too much. ÊYou could also taste the pork as well. ÊThe Special soup tasted like a combo of chicken and pork and you can really taste each ingredient. ÊThe noodle itself is decent but definitely not the best I've had. ÊThe soup and the toppings more than make up for that though. Be sure to try the braised pork belly topping! Ê Next time I come here, I'm going to bring my own container so I can take some pork buns home :)

The ambience is much nicer than most standard ramen places with darker lighting and a cherry blossom centerpiece. The ramen is delicious with perfect noodle thickness and there were several flavors to choose from (as opposed to Setagaya). I tried the Modern which was flavorful but not spicy but I prefer the original- Shiromaru. The side of roast pork over rice is also very tasty. ÊI usually get the extra pork belly and egg which make the rameneven better! ÊI don't understand the reviewers saying they weren't full- how could you not be full after a whole bowl of ramen- regardless of the taste. Ê I was here for the opening and Japanese TV was filming and asked to interview people about their experience and what they thought about the price. I think a few dollars more for better quality meat and a nicer ambience is definitely worth it. Service is generally quick and efficient- Êonce you're at the table, sometimes there's a long wait depending on the time. ÊI sometimes venture out to other ramen places, especially in the East Village like Rai Rai Ken, Setagaya, etc but Ippudo is so far my favorite.

It's the bf and my last day in NYC. ÊIt's almost 2 o'clock. ÊWe need to be at the JFK airport by at LEAST 5pm. ÊWe are desperate for delicious New York ramen to tide us over on the flight. Of course, there is a huge line at Ippudo. ÊWhat do we do? Ê We wait. ÊAnd surprisingly get seated within 30 minutes (as opposed to the projected one hour wait the hostess told us)! OH. SO WORTH THE WAIT. After being greeted enthusiastically by the staff, we settled in the communal table and ordered the Akamaru & Miso ramen, as well as the Omakase Appetizer (chef's choice). Ê Akamaru Ramen was divine, chock full of garlic and salty flavor. ÊThe pork slices were so tender and nearly melted in my mouth. ÊMy bf's Miso Ramen had a nice creamy and slightly sweet taste to it. ÊWe both conceded that though delicious, we wanted the broth a bit thicker in consistency. The Omakase Appetizer was a delicious spread of three meats: fresh salmon sashimi, roasted duck, and a slightly chilled shredded pork. Ê Great food for a reasonable price. ÊI also loved that a Mariah Carey album was blaring in the background the entire time. ÊThis place is definitely a must-try for any ramen lover.

Honestly, I never knew a bowl of ramen could be so incredible. The food here is amazing - we each ordered a bowl of ramen (the 2nd one listed on the menu) along with pork buns. The salty and sweet pork in between sliced steamed buns was better than many pork buns I've had before. The ramen was freshly made, full of huge flavor and immensely satisfying. The down sides of this place - the wait times are insane at any given time, be prepared to wait for hours. The seating is strange - parties of 5 or less are likely to share a table with other people or be forced to sit at a bar table after all that waiting. The strangest thing about Ippudo is the waitstaff's practice of cheering in Japanese together every time an order is brought out. Yes, EVERY time. This is funny the first 2-3 times, and then it just gets effing annoying. But the food more than made up for all of the atmospheric shortcomings. I HIGHLY recommend this place, the food, especially the ramen is absolutely amazing.

Honestly, I hate this type of atmosphere. ÊLong lines (though not when I went), posh, loud music, dark lights, and overpriced. ÊMaybe the NY scene is too much for me but I felt like I had to eat my ramen really fast. I got the Akamaru Modern which has their Ippudo broth plus some miso broth (I think). ÊMy friend described the broth as "creamy without the cream" and that's precisely what it is. ÊIt even had some red paste in the middle that mixed in well and really enhanced the depth of the broth. ÊI liked the noodles, I liked the meat. ÊVery satisfying. My ideal ramen joint is the mom 'n pop shop that I would love to just chill and relax in. ÊBut for good ramen, I'll stop by Ippudo sometime.

At 4:45pm on a sunday, I went up to the hostess to ask how long for a table for 3 people and received two words I had never heard at Ippudo, "no wait." ÊHaving spent around 10 hours total of my life waiting to eat at Ippudo over the course of several visits, I've let the influence of endless waiting negatively affect my judgment and my opinion of this place. But after flying right into the dim and cavernous confines of this ramen temple, I experienced the pure and unadulterated beauty and wonder of the akamaru ramen. ÊI've eaten the akamaru and the shiromaru ramens here before but that sunday was the first time I ate without the slight bitterness of a wait usually on average of an hour. And that akamaru was awesome. The noodles were chewy and slurpworthy, the slice of berkshire pork was as thick as bark and as flavorful and fatty as any I'd ever eaten with ramen, and the tonkotsu broth...man, there is really is nothing like Ippudo's creamy, porky, and rich broth especially when spiked with the dollop of garlicky and spicy special red sauce. And for only $2 more, I got to do it all over again with the kaedama portion of noodle. Obviously, my ode to ippudo's ramen is shared by the hundreds of others who've written about it. But what I found even more amazing about my most recent experience was that I ate this eye-popping ramen not during peak lunch or dinner hour but at 5pm on a sunday. And the service was really good, as in my water glass was never empty. I've tried the pork buns and the chicken wings to start and they're alright, but if you must overpay for one appetizer, I say to go with the japanese cucumber mixed with sesame oil dressing. These "pickles" will not fill your belly but will serve as great whetters of your appetite. Honestly though, why bother with the appetizers. The akamaru and shiromaru ramens should really be given their proper respect as the best-tasting ramens in New York. And if you've been disillusioned by the prime-time waits, go at 4:45 on a sunday to refresh yourself about this fact.

As a young girl eating Maruchan Ramen (and loving it), I never knew what ramen could be. Better than this MSG-laden bowl of salt and carbs?! Apparently, yes. Ever since I read of Ippudo, I was dying to try it. Convinced some friends to go on Sunday at 5, right as they opened, thus our wait was only about 30 minutes. The ramen was delicious. There's not a lot of options, but it was very interesting and fresh. I can see that being a ramen aficionado would help one appreciate the complexity and superiority of Ippudo... I must admit though it was very good, I wasn't blown away. The pork buns were very umami and fatty (aka delicious). Not sure if they beat Momofuku, but in the world of Pork Buns, there is room for more than one champion. To summarize: Ippudo serves great noodles in an intriguing atmosphere. If the wait is more than an hour and you're feeling hungry, either ditch it and come back at a time when you can be seated sooner or pony up to the bar and start drinking. Some people can stand waits better than others. Portions aren't very large, but flavors make up for that. Ippudo's certainly worth trying, however I'm not sure it's good enough to warrant weekly visits.

Feeling tired? Work has got you stressed?? Girlfriend just dumped you? Well my friend, you have just stumble upon what might be the greatest find since the Terracotta Warriors. Ok maybe not that great. Ippudo has to be one of my favorite places to eat and to commemorate this occasion, i have asked "The Warden" ( my girl lol ) to help me do a "duet" review of this bad boy. So without delay.... "What I like about this place, besides the food, is the instant warm, inviting, upbeat vibe you get when you walk through the door and dining area. Be prepared to be greeted in Japanese! It actually scared me the first time. Very common in Japan to greet their guests when entering in. This was the 3rd time we stopped off at Ippudo for some delicious ramen. The first two times, my ramens were ok but my partner was a big fan so we made another trip. I had the Shoyu Ramen which is one of the two lightest broth they have there. It was the best out of the 3 I had. Kinda reminds me of those chinese instant noodles but 3x better. I even ordered extra noodles bc I couldn't get enough of the broth! But sadly, I only managed to eat 3 more bites and I was stuffed to the brim. If you like light broths, then I highly recommend this Ê" Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê` The Warden part deuce Almost every time i came here, there was always a line. I seriously did not mind the wait seeing as how there was a bar right at the front door! They dont' have a full bar like most japanese establishments but i gotta tell ya.. Ê1 word 3 syllables.. Hakata. Tropicana ruby red grapefruit juice w/ sake ( i think they add gin in as well ). This cocktail was made to please and sooo smooth going down. What might be a turn-off for some is that there is a good amount of pulp from the juice ( me likey some pulp =D:: ) Apps - Hirata Buns - Êsteamed buns, filled with your choice of pork or ground chicken, served with lppudo original spicy buns sauce. Eating these reminds me of eating Cha siew baos ( pork buns ) from chinatown. They're quite tasty and your order comes with 2 so you can do some crossing the arms feeding your spouse type of jizz so you can show you still have a " romantic" side in ya ! lol other notable apps would be the Edamame Ê& Shishito Êwhich are deep fried japanese peppers. Main - Tori... you taste soooo goood. Errr.. no hunnie, it's not what you think !!!!! Torri Ramen - salt flavored ramen noodles, a combination of ippudo 'chintan clear chicken and tonkotsu soup, topped with slices of berkshire pork, 1/2 hard boiled egg, onion, menma, naruto, shiso & scallions. This masterpiece they call Tori is just dam Awesome! The Broth is so clean tasting. The combination of the noodles pork,egg and broth will have you salivating like your name was grover. A must try for any ramen lovers. If you're still hungry after 1 bowl, save the broth.. you can add extra noodles for 2 dollars more.

Many years of stuffing my face all over New York and this is my first trip to Ippudo (insert shame face). We went on a Monday around 11:30 (they open the doors at 11AM); only waited 10 minutes; the host was very friendly so was our waitress. Ordered the Hirata Buns (pork belly buns), it was very delicious, much better than Momofuku's IMO. I ordered the Miso ramen, it was bit creamy but overall very tasty given I got the Bokudan sauce which toned down the creaminess a bit. ÊAfter our meal we got the sweet tofu with a scoop of pear sorbet on top, very refreshing. The portions (ramen) are large; expect to pay about $20-$25 per person given you do ramen and a drink, or an appetizer. Overall my experience at Ippudo was very good. It's not the best nor the most reasonably priced ramen I've ever had, but still very tasty and I would definitely visit again and bring friends here. We left about 12:15 and there was already an hour wait at the door. I was told the line forms very quickly everyday so come right when they open for lunch/dinner if you want to beat the rush.

I met up with a friend for lunch here a couple weeks ago and was excited to try it because I had heard so much about it. ÊWe got there early at 11:30a anticipating the lunch time rush and had no problem getting seated. We sat at one of those group tables and ordered their Pork Hirata Buns which was SO delicious!!! Ahh, I wanted to take some home (but walking around the city on that hot, humid day would've ruined them). I ordered the Shiromaru Hakata Classic with Kakuni topping, and thought it was delicious! I mean, all I know about ramen is Cup of Noodles and cooking it with an egg college-style, so this was amazing to me. ÊI do wish I had ordered Karaka Men because I would've definitely enjoyed a spicy kick to it. ÊI've also heard that the Miso Ramen is delicious as well. Ê The noodles were cooked perfectly and the broth was delicious. ÊAnd I know I ordered extra toppings, but I felt like they still added a good amount of meat into the ramen. ÊI really get annoyed when places skimp out on the meat. My mother did not raise me to be frugal in eating meat... Service was quick and friendly! My only complaint was that hey shout out the orders and it can be really loud and distracting if you're having a conversation with someone, but it wasn't enough to be a turn off. ÊThe place is meant to be casual, not a fancy dining place. I look forward to coming back and trying the other types of ramen!

OMG!! We came here yesterday. We were told that the wait was 1 hour and 45 minutes!! We were crazy enough to do it. Waited at the bar and they had happy hour from 5pm to 8pm from Monday- Thursday. I ordered the Lychee Martini and it was strong but very yummy!! Definitely got me chillin and buzzed for the night. I guess a lot of people didn't want to wait so we ended up getting a table within 45 minutes, which isn't bad at all. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive. Ordered the infamous Pork Hirata Buns and I really didn't think it would be that good... but boy was it YUMMY!! I ordered the Akamaru Modern Ramen and the noodles came out al dente. Oh and the Berkshire pork was very good. I think the "special sauce" in the broth makes the ramen so different than the other ones I have had, it had a deep savory flavor. I wanted to try the matcha crme brulee but we ordered the almond tofu instead which was light and tasty. I guess it means that I would have to return. ;) The overall ambiance was very intimate and cozy. Lighting was dark but it pulled everything together. This is a great place to have dinner with a group of friends or your significant other. The chefs and wait staff would yell when customers arrive and when they leave, which makes the place inviting and fun!!

One one of my last trips to New York before relocating here, I asked all my West Coast friends what I should be doing in the NYC. You would not believe how many times Ippudo came up. On the first try a large group of us tried to go on a weekday night around 8:30pm after we had already had dinner at S'MAC done the street. The hostess looked at us as if we were nuts and informed us of the 2 hour wait. My girlfriend tried then to order a bowl of ramen to go, which they informed her they don't do to-go. It seems it's harder to get into Ippudo in occasion than it is the Grammys or the White House. Not to be conquered by the ramen house, I returned on another weekday at 3:45pm for lunch. With my luck, they of course open at 5pm. After finding a neighborhood pub, we returned back at 4:45...already the 4th or 5th people in line. Once it opened, we were greeted nicely and seated quickly and the show was on the road. The waitress was super helpful and we placed out order of: *Pork Buns *Hirata Chicken Wings *Akamaru Modern Ramen *Matcha Brulee *Biggest bottle of Sake ever She talked us out of getting some raw octopus deal that apparently wasn't that good.The pork buns are amazing here. I didn't realize that until I started trying them everywhere else. Ramen was also really good. Would love to make this a permanent restaurant in the rotation, but I have a thing against waiting in lines for hours. =(

The unveiling of Ippundo has long been anticipated... I walked by a few weeks ago and saw people peering into what appeared to be a wooden box with a few slits here and there. ÊI peered with them and saw nothing. ÊCuriousity got the better of me and after some googling found it was going to be a ramen house! ÊThere could never be enough ramen houses in this growing city so I was siked to slide up a seat and chomp on some oodles of noodles. The facade adds to the appeal of Ippudo. ÊThe sleek bar and decor don't hurt either. ÊOn one end is the food bar with stools situated before the stove and plating area. ÊIt is reminiscent of a japanese street bar, just chic-er. ÊOn the other end of the restaurant lies the snotty sister of the bar with modern light fixtures and square booths for larger parties. Ê On to the main attraction -- the ramen. ÊIt's fresh, evident by the downstairs peer window so you can see the man making the fresh ramen. ÊThis place is a dream for those peeping toms! While fresh, what happened to the rest of my meal? ÊThe soup was tasty but all I could find in my ramen was just noodles. ÊOh yes, there was ONE piece of pork belly and about 3 small cabbage leaves. ÊThat's it. ÊIt was good, but I was left fishing for goodies that I usually expect when eating ramen. Ê I was a fisherman with no catch last night. Ê Thank goodness we also ordered an additional appetizer -- the croquettes which was delicious and creamy. ÊI watched the chef deep fry the croquettes and plate them on top of greens and carrots.. they tasted as good as they looked. While the entire experience was unforgettable from the decor to the hustle behind the kitchen, the ramen was also unforgettable. ÊMost go to the ramen house to eat .. noodles, but gosh darn it, give me some goodies with my noodles!!! Ê If I want ramen again, there are other places to hit up before Ippudo comes to mind.

I went to Ippudo with my coworkers, all Ramen heads. We went during the pre-opening. Waited 30 Mins (its new and to be expected). Ok so I ordered the Shoyu Ramen. Waited a while again for the main course to come out. We shared an order of pickles and Crispy Chicken Karaage. The sides were tasty, actually everything was tasty. BUT the sides we very small. Then the ramen comes out. Ok I asked the waiter if I should order the extra noodles, he said "no it's good". OK. Well I ate the ramen, enjoyed it but.... After 10 minutes I was hungry again. I enjoy good quality considerate food, but I don't love the idea of spending a lot, and still being hungry. My coworkers were alright since they drank beer. I'm not a big guy. I prefer to eat at Sapporo (west), the quality is a little more basic but I spend less and am satisfied when I leave. I have been to Japan (only me no one else ;) and the ramen is very similar at Sapporo to what I consumed in Japan.

I FINALLY tried this place after hearing so much hype and reading the great review in the Times. This place is great. Cool atmosphere and vibe and friendly service. The service might have been one of the best aspects of this place. Luckily, we did not wait the horrendous wait times that most people wait. We got seated pretty quickly. We had some apps. My girlfriends weren't as impressed but I loved the spicy tofu special. So flavorful and spicy. I had the original Shiomaru ramen. It was good. Anything in pork fat is good. But, it was a bit bland for me and I got order-envy and wished I ordered the Akamaru one (the one in the red bowl) which was spicier and more flavorful. The pork belly was so tender and yummy and the portion wasn't great, but I didn't mind so much which is unusual since I am all about portion size. The prices aren't bad (not great, not too expensive). No 5 stars here. It didn't live up to the hype. But to be fair, I am not a fan of Japanese food in general... however, I would go back and definitely would recommend to others.

Ippudo is hard as hell to get into, there are so many damned foodies swarming this place that you could easily be faced with a hour plus wait on any given night. I was able to get a single seat rather easily because I came alone. All I had was a bowl of the Akamaru Ramen, which is their "new" recipe. I'm usually more a fan of traditional, but since this was their spin I thought it best to give it a shot. Simply put, it was freaking delicious. You can immediately tell that the broth had been simmering away for most of the day and the noodles were well cooked with still a bit of bounce to them as well. I also like the huge spoon they give you because there's enough surface area to allow everything to cool down, cause it'll burn your face off otherwise. One critique was that you don't get much meat with each order; the meat isn't the focus of the dish but if you're expecting a bunch you may want to order some extra. One quick tip is that the little red dispenser on the table of sesame seeds is a grinder. I had no idea how to use it so i opened it all up and pretty much drowned myself in seeds. Don't do that.

Review Highlights: GET THE RAMEN (THEY'RE ALL GOOD) AND THE PORK BUNS and you won't be sorry! At 4:45pm I happened to be walking around the city when I saw a line about 12 people deep for a closed restaurant. Without putting much thought into it, I figured if other people wanted it, then I wanted it too, and I fell into line before even finding out what waiting for. While in line, I finally saw the name of the restaurant, and immediately knew that it was familiar. I reached for my precious iPhone and looked to the Yelp! community to confirm my suspicions and was pleasantly surprised that I had stumbled upon a place that I had read about and have been wanting to go for some time now. As I walked in, Ippudo screamed trendy. Then when I was seated, they (the wait staff) screamed again, literally. You'd think after the hours of anime I've watched, I would have picked up something, but their greeting was out of my knowledge, but cute none the less. My guest and I were seated in these two separate, but together, seats that would be perfect for a second or third date. While we were seated at a table with other diners, I never felt like I was on top of the other guests like some places that use that style of seating. The staff was super friendly, and special commendation must be given to the Water Ninja who always seemed to fill my cup up without me ever noticing. I swear after one or two sips, not only would he top off my drink, but also probably fixed my napkin, wiped the table, and pushed in my seat. Going off the suggestions of fellow Yelp!'ers , my guest and I tried their two of their Ramens and their Pork Buns. Thank god I read the reviews, because both suggestions were spot on, and the food was EXCELLENT. The pork buns were surprisingly light and just cooked absolutely perfectly. I could have easily eaten a dozen of them only to throw them back up to make room for their delicious ramen. While I have never been to Japan, I can just imagine that what I had is as authentic as I could get. I've tried other ramen houses, but Ippudo just had so much flavor that I am surprised the bowl didn't shatter from the culinary volume it contained. The ambiance is trendy, the wait staff is on point, and the food is to die for. It is no surprise that they've received such high ratings before, and will continue to for the future. It's always a good sign that even before I have paid for the check, that I thought about what I would get the next time I come back. Because of Ippudo I made sure to learn at least one Japanese phrase... Itadakimasu! (Let's Eat!)

I went to Ippudo a month ago! My boyfriend and I went for lunch and the line was longgggg. However, it was worth the wait. Luckily we only had two and we came before a group of crowd started coming in. We waited for about 40 minutes. We ordered two ramens: Akamaru Modern ($14), and Shiromaru Hakata Classic Ê($14). When we got our order, we didn't expect it to be two huge bowls. We first tried the soup base, and my boyfriend immediately wanted to say "Kae-dama, please." By doing so, for just $2 the waiter/waitress will bring you an extra serving of noodles and soak it into your soup. I told him not to of course, because I wanted to make sure he finished all the noodles and not to drink most of his soup. Overall, this ramen place was worth the long wait. However, I wish their price can be lowered because I would come here everyday!

Slurp slurp slurp. Ahhhhh. It's sooo good here, I practically dream about the perfect broth. I prefer the slightly stronger flavor of the Modern. Get that plus a side of pork, pair with a crisp beer. It's the best comfort food. Ippudo is a thousand times that that over salted broth at Momofuku - yuck!. Sluuuurpp.

I'm surprised I never wrote a review about this place, especially when I was very excited about it at one boring point in my life. It was the first bowl of $16 ramen I'd ever had. I didn't think it was worth it, but my yuppie sister paid for it and she certainly thought it was worth the wait, the crowdedness, and noise, and the taste. It was a good bowl of noodles, for sure. But perhaps not good enough to keep me coming back when I could be getting a $6 bowl somewhere without a half-hour wait for weekday lunch. I understand it. but it doesn't mean i like it.

So yeah, the ramen is great (the braised pork belly swimming in my bowl was to die for). But those pork buns? Those pork buns are what I'll return to Ippudo for. They are effing amazing. As for the spot itself, I love it. Lively atmosphere, modern decor. These are the types of places that make me wish I lived in NYC.

I've heard a few of my friends been raving about this place so we went to check it out to see what this place was all about. I must say the wait was a bit long, we waited 1.5 hr but well worth the money and time for GREAT food. I don't think the host was too friendly and a bit rude. Our waitress was great and very friendly and constantly coming over to check on us. While waiting I did notice that a group of people who came in and when they found out the wait time they were complaining and told the host that they got a baby with them and right away they got seated without having to wait like everyone else did which I think it's a bit unfair. Anyone can tell me why they get special privileges? The noodle was AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!!! It's definitely not what I expected from ramen noodles. We start off by ordering the Japanese cucumbers, chicken wings (a bit overpriced for 3 pcs. cost $7) and the chicken buns. The Japanese cucumbers were so good we had to go for 2nd. The wings were great but still not sure if it's worth $7. The chicken bun we didn't really care for. I got the modern ramen noodle which was so good, but I had to pass on the refill as I was trying to save room for desert. After that night I must say I have change on view on ramen noodles as I used to think of instant noodles when I hear that name, but not anymore. Would've gave it a 5 star if the host were more fair when it comes to seating and be more friendly.

Say what you want, it's already been said before... Yes, the waits are too long; yes, Ippudo NYC is super trendy; no, this is not the most traditional Hakata tonkotsu ramen, neither is Ippudo the best bang for the buck. There is, however, a reason that Ippudo singlehandedly popularized Kyushu-style tonkotsu ramen across Japan, and is still going strong (just opened their 39th location on the West Exit side of Yokohama station). For better or worse, Ippudo was solely responsible for elevating ramen from a working man's fast food to something more special; I rarely visited Ippudo while living in Japan for 5+ years, because I, too, love those cheap, hole-in-the-wall Mom and Pop ramen shops. I lived in Kyushu during high school, very close to Hakata, where Ippudo originates from, and 3+ years in Tokyo, and Ippudo's ramen, though not the most traditional, certainly competes with the best ramen anywhere in the world, period. And Ippudo NY is something different entirely- the largest, most upscale and busiest Ippudo (and the only one outside of Japan), Ippudo is the King of Ramen, not only in New York, but anywhere in the Western Hemisphere, and probably outside of Japan for that matter. The noodles are skillfully hand-crafted fresh every morning in the basement, the true-to-taste tonkotsu broth is superb (and somehow they've managed to all but entirely do away with the acrid pork fat smell so ubiquitous to Kyushu ramen, which may leave some dismayed, but is certainly an accomplishment and welcomed by North American diners), and Ippudo NY features a full appetizer/entree list, as well as a full service bar, sake list, etc. Even in Japan lines often stretch out the door and down the street; and none of the Japanese locations have a fun bar area with a cute bartender and great drink specials to help pass the time while waiting. Give up and just go- great service, delicious food, fun atmosphere- this isn't your Mom and Pop ramen shop, this is 21st Century, gentrified ramen with a trendy twist, and there's a reason everyone loves it.

Everybody has different comfort food. For some, it's pizza. For others, it might be ice cream. For me, it's ramen. And nobody has topped Ippudo, so far. I prefer food with strong flavors, that's why Ippudo satisfies my craving 120% everytime. This could also be the reason some might find this ramen a bit on the salty side. However, I have not met a person who left this restaurant shouting "yuck!" You really can't go wrong with Ramen. I mean it's sodium, carbs, and fat. How can you screw that up, right? But Ippudo really cranks it up a notch. Their broth is creamier than the usual miso broth. Their noodle is chewier than regular ramen noodle, a little bit like spaghetti texture. And the whole bunch of crap they throw on the top is just the icing on the cake. And you have to try the pork bun also. Besides the fact that everyone knows the pork belly in the bun melts in your mouth, I'm here to give a pat on the back for the under-appreciated bun. It's soft when you first bite into it, then it becomes chewy, finishes with a touch of sweetness. yum! I've been there numerous times, and will always go back there without thinking twice. The only problem is 80% of the time, there's an hour wait, and their bar area is tiny. So waiting outside in the winter is more than what I can tolerate for ramen. So make reservation, I suggest.

I can't quite see what all the fuss is about. My friends and I went to Ippudo on a quiet weekday afternoon with high expectations, perhaps a little too high, given the acclaim it has received. Since I arrived early, the hostesses kindly asked if I wanted some water or a drink while I was waiting for my friends. Bonus points for them. We ordered the chicken wraps/sticky buns for our appetizer, which were pretty delicious. The chicken was tender and moist and had a nice balance of sweet and savory. I ordered the miso ramen as I always use it as a benchmark for a ramen place. On the balance, I think the miso ramen was good but not rave worthy. The noodles were a bit overcooked for my taste but of obviously high quality. I liked the broth though as it was more flavorful but less salty and oily than the broth at Momofuku. However, I think Momofuku still has the edge on the quality of the pork in its ramen. Our server was accommodating and let us linger well after we had finished since my friends and I hadn't seen each other in a while. Overall, Ippudo was a decent experience and I would go again. But if you want a more authentic experience, follow the salary-men, not the East Village hipsters, and try Sapporo or Menkui Tei. UPDATE: So I've gone back multiple times and had a change of heart. Ippudo is now my benchmark for ramen in NYC. The shoyu tonkatsu and the akaru modern are now my staples and don't get me started on the pork sticky buns or I'll never shut up. The wait time is still ridiculously too long but ramen fiends like me will keep coming back.

Honestly, this place is as close as you get to authentic Japanese ramen... Unfortunately, I feel sorry for the people who pay for them here, because Ippudo in Japan is just a fairly average ramen shop chain that you see about anywhere in many cities, even small ones. This means that you are paying top dollar for chain food. Also, I don't understand how there could be lines for it, ramen is supposed to be eaten as a fast food such as you eat and go, I don't understand how they have a "ramen restaurant," that's why you rarely see actual Japanese people here, because they aren't stupid enough to pay $12+ dollars for ramen, hah. Also, I think the better place and cheaper place where you can actually hang out and relax and not have to wait for lines usually is just 2 blocks away, Menkui Tei, The staff is more chill, the atmosphere is not so aggravating like Ipp's (aka the trendy hipster/"I love Japanese stuff" crowd.) If you want authentic TASTING ramen, this is pretty okay, but keep in mind that ramen is like a snack, not a freaking dinner with fancy waitresses lol.

So I was here on a business trip and I heard about this ramen place through my boss and BOY was he right this place blew my mind away. This is my favorite place to eat ramen. I love the decor and how they have authentic japanese people working there. I went during lunch hour it seems like they always have a wait so make sure you plan ahead prior to your visit. I got the lunch special Akamaru Modern Set and added an egg on top. It was like heaven starting from the salad dressing all the way to the last sip of the broth. Writting about it makes my mouth water. I can't wait to visit again hopefully in November. But yeah the lunch set is not bad it comes with the following:- salad- soy wasabi dressing (not the typical mayo dressing over in the west coast) small bowl of rice and chicken karage ramen-the broth was amazing different flavors and i love the miso paste with the garlic oil. I believe they make their own noodles there too because when I went downstairs for the bathroom I saw some guy stucked in a small room cranking those ramen noodles it was pretty impressive. I definately recommend this as one of the MUST TRY when you are in NY!!!!!

What tha Ramen!!!! Blissfully flawless is the best way I can describe this spot!!! This place does it right and does it gooooood. The space is trendy (perfect for a date) and the food is amazingly authentic. I recommend ordering a bottle of sake and drinking it from the wooden box that comes along with it if you really want that authentic Tokyo vibe. Where the hell do I start... came here with a buddy we decided to go all out and try whatever we could. It's hard to come here and not compare it to Momofuku, mainly because they are two of the only ramen spots in the city that I feel do it perfectly. For appetizers we had the raw octopus in wasabi sauce and pork buns. The octopus was full of flavor and extremely spicy, if you're looking for a punch in the gut, go for it! Now, here's where I think momofuku takes the lead in a battle of the ramen spots - the pork buns.... Momofuku's buns were definitely better, but not nearly as good as Bao Haus. Not to say that Ippudo's weren't tasty, but they just weren't a highlight. Then came the reason we were there.. the Ramen! As I write this I still can't recall the explosion of flavors and textures that erupted with each bite. Biggest differential between this spot and MoFu was that MoFu's broth is a bit saltier...that's it! Ippudo does it damn good and even offers you the opportunity to add noodles towards the end of your ramen endeavor. I would always recommend that option because ... who the hell wouldn't want MORE NOODLES!!!! In ending, this place is legit. Like a backalley ramen bar in Osaka, this place explodes with authenticity and creativity. I would absolutely recommend it. Also, I'll never forget the beavy of good looking ladies who littered the place... very good reason to go a second time!

After my friend raved about it and all the hype I had very high expectations for ippudo, especially to justify the prices. For example, a bowl of noodles here costs more than at Nobu (udon or soba, not ramen). I doubt anyone goes to Nobu for noodles but i just found that interesting I had the Akamaru ramen with the special sauce, and split a bowl of extra noodles with my friend. We also each ordered the side of pork belly so basically I ate until my sides hurt. And it was the best tonkotsu ramen broth I've had. The broth is extra porky, the thin slices of pork are very tender, and the noodles are a perfect springy texture. Maybe it was an off night but the pork belly I found a little tough- extremely bummed about that after being told how good it was. And so after my $20 ramen experience I was stuffed and satisfied. But also in retrospect a little disappointed. I mean its a decent price for dinner but its a lot for a bowl of ramen so who knows when I'll be back. But if you're ok with that its the best tonkotsu ramen in the east village...only a little pricier but much better than momofuku and ramen setagaya. I would prefer it to minca and rai rai ken too, if price were not a factor. Oh, and the wait was almost an hour both times I went. Small groups will most likely have to share..somehow we ended up sharing a table with my friend's boss...awkward. *Update* The Hakata classic ramen is pretty bland compared to Akamaru so I'm sticking to that. The miso is pretty good too - think they add black sesame? I recently tried the Ippudo in Japan with the same friend and it was AMAZING. I think they tone down the flavors for NY or something. Ê:(

Woo Hoo, went @ 6:30ish on a Wednesday for a table of 2 and DING DING DING - NO WAIT! ÊSCORE!!! Got the usual Akamaru Ramen, it would take a lot to make me stray... Instead of of the Tofu, ground pork dry ramen app (the quality of this app had been spotty lately) we usually go for, we decided to go with the: Hirata(sp?) Buns (steamed buns stuffed with pork belly, lettuce, and spicy kewpie mayo): YUM! ÊThe first time I had these, it felt a little skimpy on the meat, but I very much enjoyed the lettuce and spicy kewpie mayo. ÊThis time, the meat was plentiful, flavorful, w/ juices running off the bun (in a good, manage-able way). Ê BTW, we were seated at one of those large communal tables near the kitchen and I was totally eyeing this man's cold soba noodles. ÊLooked absolutely delicious, but I couldn't give up Ippudo's broth for cold noodles...

I have never had authentic ramen in Japan so I may not be spot on when it comes to my judgement of the ramen here. However, I am a BIG fan of noodle soups in general whether it be Pho, Ramen, etc. The selection of ramen is limited and they only have pork...I guess thats the way it is suppose to be? I ordered the Akamaru so that is all I have to go by. The noodle itself was delicious...tasted like homemade noodles.Yum! However, I felt the broth was a little too complex and overwhelmed me with flavor. I wasnt able to distinguish the different flavors as they were all strong and overwhelmed my taste buds. Maybe this is because I ordered the spicer ramen...I have no clue. ALso I do not enjoy pork belly as it is mostly fat and no meat. But overall I did enjoy my expensive bowl of ramen! I will return to see if I can find the ramen I like best...maybe the classic ramen? Decor-wise it was very modern yet Japanese at the same time. Although I didnt have much time to look around I can tell that the restaurant was very nicely put together. The Êseating took me by surprise as it was lower than what I am used to. We definitely came at the right time because there wasnt a long wait and by the time we left the entire front bar area was filled with hungry ramen eaters.

So i finally came back for the Ramen...twice. I gotta say while i liked the Ramen, ÊI did feel that the broth and fatty pork COULD bea little less greasy.

Shoyu ramen with the braised pork belly (extra $3) hits the spot when you're craving the perfect bowl of ramen. ÊVery savory and filling, but I don't feel gross like I often do after eating a bowl with tonkotsu broth. Ê Service is ultra fast. ÊWe had our ramen within 5 minutes of ordering.

Mmmm mmm - who doesn't love Ramen? Even if it is in the middle of the summer and the wait is 20-30 minutes? I went to Ippudo for lunch on Sunday and while I thought I was getting up earlier than most New Yorkers (noon), the place was still packed. The tables are shared, but they don't feel cramped, but the service is a bit hectic. It took us awhile to flag down our waiter. I ordered the Akamaru Modern which was unbelievably good. The broth is always what does it for me at a ramen place, and Ippudo was no exception. It had a really rich flavor and when I stirred in the special sauce, the broth became even tastier. The pork was really super tender and the noodles were cooked perfectly. I was definitely lovin' life as I slurped down my lunch. I would definitely come back here again - I wish they did take out though. I would love to eat that ramen while watching Top Chef in my underwear at home.

Ippudo is a solid 4.75 stars for me when I factor in the price tag and the wait time - but the minute I walk through those doors and start to inhale that brothy smell, all knowledge of what a dollar sign means goes out the window. Make your tummy happy, but be prepared for a wait if you go during dinner. If you only have one or two people in your party, it's a lot more fun to sit at the bar so that you can watch them prepare and plate the food. The noodles are silky, the broth is rich, the pork buns are savory. Nomnomnom. /craves

Ippudo is so good!!! ÊBut the wait is so long! Last Sunday, a group of 4 of us tried to come extra early - like, 11:45AM in order to skip the huge queue. ÊStill, because of the way the tables are set up, and I think all the "other" clever people who came at 11:45AM, we still had to wait almost an hour for a table so that we could face each other. ÊSeems like 2 is the magic number here, about 10 couples ate and left before us. Luckily, we came a bit early, and after waiting an hour, it was only 12:30PM and not 1:30PM, so we weren't starving to death yet, we finally got to the table. ÊAt which point, we proceeded to order everything on the menu. Everything was delicious - I highly recommend: 1) Kakuni Pork with the semi raw egg and wasabi sauce 2) Tofu with Spicy Pork Hot Pot 3) Hirata Buns with more fatty pork 4) Their special ramen - Pork Ramen with a Creamy Chicken Broth 5) Any of their Ramen Dishes! ÊWith a side of Kakuni and also their special hot sauce. Everything was so good!! ÊThis is the perfect food for a cold day. ÊJust warms you to the core. Ê I'll be back at 10:30 AM next time.

What's the point of reviewing a restaurant that 1274 others have reviewed? ÊNone, but I can't sleep so here we go. So I moved away form NYC to Cali almost 3 years ago. In the bay area I discovered ramen and fried chicken toppings. ÊI discovered halu ramen, kahoo, santa ramen, hotei. ÊI learned that God created ramen, and ramen was good. Then I moved back to NYC. ÊI heard from friends, whispers on the subway (i'm dead serious) about some place called ippudo. But theres this crazy wait. ÊSo I hate waiting, and put off a visit. ÊI visit a couple of ramen places and meh - it's ok. ÊI'm not impressed. I hold my chin up high and declared that nyc does not know real ramen. ÊMarch rolls around, and it's my friend's birthday. ÊHe has a secret, how to get reservations for 10 at ippudo at 7. ÊWe arrive, we're seated on time and I order the akamaru modern. I don't have any crazy expectations, and in the midst of taking crazy pictures with friends, some mantou pork and chicken buns land on our table. Oh nice! I grab the pork mantou. holy mother of.... Hi waitress, is there crack in his pork mantou? Yes it tastes orgasmic, there's crack in here right? viagra? no? My ramen comes. i take a million pictures. I grab my chopsticks and dig into the noodles. Yummy noodles. They taste fresh, perfect texture, Êchewy, not soggy, Not bad! Meh. ÊAs I'm enjoying conversation with friends which i ended up realizing that it was just me talking as everyone is silently eating their ramen, I pick up a spoon and start to sip on my broth. ÊI get quieter. more focused. this broth... it's so... flavorful. What do they put in here? I cannot identify a single flavor that reminds me of something God put on this earth. ÊThe broth is complex, rich, savory. ÊWhat are all these colors doing in my broth!? I can't identify it. ÊBut it's so sexy!!! Ah you japanese people... what is this magic!!!! Oh no, no more broth...no more magic. :( sadness. 5 stars, for sexy magic. it's so sexy magic that i came back 2 weeks after with a sore throat and akamaru cured it. i knew ramen could cure the common cold.

I am a big fan of any type of noodle/tofu type of soup, so it's no surprise I really enjoyed this place. ÊI came here on a Monday night and avoided any wait times. This is probably the best ramen I've had, though I feel like it's a bit expensive for what it is. ÊI had the shoyu ramen and it was really good. ÊThe broth was flavorful, the pork was great, and the egg was cooked perfectly (slightly runny, yet firm). Ê The pork buns here are amazing. ÊThe pork is delicious and fatty and goes well the peking duck style buns. Ê Overall, a great meal and probably the best bowl of ramen you'll find around.

This place is across the street from my apartment, but I never went due to the absurdity of waiting over an hour for ramen noodles. ÊDecided to go for an early lunch, however, and there was no wait--only lots and lots of ramen. Split the pork Hirata Buns for an appetizer and they were delicious, then had the Karaka Men with a poached egg. ÊThe soup was spicy, but definitely not too spicy. ÊMy girlfriend had the Akamaru Modern, which seemed to have a bit more of a creamy taste to it, and it was excellent too. ÊI have not had a ton of ramen, but this was definitely the best I have ever had. ÊNot to mention, the service was excellent too. ÊWater was filled up every time it got down halfway and our server was incredibly friendly and gave thoughtful recommendations. The only reason this place loses a star is because they don't let you take any ramen to go. ÊIt's so much soup and they don't have containers! ÊAlso, the constant shouting the waitstaff does in Japanese when a new party comes in can get a little annoying, but is definitely not a reason not to go. ÊIf you can get in at a slow time--under 30 minute wait--it is definitely worth a visit.

So far.. this has been the best ramen I have ever had in my tummy. When you are seated to your seat, everyone literally everyone greets you. It's pretty sick.

I'm going to throw my hat in the ring (review #2186) and tell you what everyone else already has: best ramen in the EV and pork buns rivaling those at Momofuku. Fears about the menu being overpriced are unfounded; $16 for the set lunch is a deal for the amount and quality of the food. The space is pretty cool too, very classy, and if you go for lunch...you may not even have to wait that long! We waited about 10 minutes at 1pm on a Monday. Bottom line, it's delicious, go!

The Tokyo legend scaled up to New York hyperspace. ÊProbably four times as large as the branch in Ebisu, at least, with lines going out the door. Ê ÊPrice and decor have gone up as well to reflect the tony neighborhood. Ê This gets in the way of the philosophy of ramen as an inexpensive, casual day to day form of sustenance. Ê That being said, the availability of communal tables to facilitate small parties of 1-2 people relatively quickly helps to a certain extent. ÊPrice for ramen starting at $13, and easily getting close to $20 a bowl is crazy for anywhere else...but for this quality in downtown Manhattan is probably around ballpark. ÊThe raucousness of the wait staff/ordering protocol helps keeps things from getting too upscale and they are generally friendly and having a good time of it. The only catch - appetizers go up to $8-10 which can lead to sticker shock at the final bill....

Ippudo is definitely a locals and tourists hotspot. The ambiance is beautiful with its squared dark wooden tables around a fireside and glass segregated booths along the back wall. Its atmosphere inside the restaurant, contrary to the bustling chaotic crowd in the waiting room, speaks classy relaxed and romantic. The food is flavorful and wholesome and service is friendly and attentive. Ê The ramen here are a must try because they are so simply YUMMY and the broth -so fatty, juicy, and thick-- is the best part! I tried the Shiromaru Chashu and the regular Ippudo Ramen and both were delicious, and tasty. The pork buns are so heavenly tender and lush. And the Sashimi tuna with wasabi sauce was amazing. Sure the menu can be a bit pricey for the small portions they give but the quality of the food and aura is worth the extra cash from time to time. The line can go on for about 2+ hours but come at lunch time to cut your wait time in half or grab a coffee at the Starbucks down the street. Ê I am definitely coming back next time I'm in the big apple and dragging my whole posse with me!

I loved it when I went there, but potentially only because my friend paid for me, and his friend was the bartender, so he kept on giving us free drinks at the waiting bar--now that I think about it, it was an extremely long wait, that didn't bother me only because of the free drinks. ÊAny other way, I think I'd be pissed, or at least, left apathetically as "not being worth it." The ramen is very good, as well as other dishes there. ÊHowever... what was it? Ê$13+ or so for a bowl of ramen? ÊPLEASE. ÊThat is abominable. ÊThat is almost like getting away with murder. ÊOh, East Village.... ÊOh, Japanese restaurants that have figured out they can make a fortune off of street food... But I guess if you're not from Japan and don't know that ramen should basically NEVER be more expensive than $8, it shouldn't bother you so much. ÊAnd it's really good! ÊPreferrably make friends with the nice guy at the waiting bar. ÊAnd get a friend to buy for you. Just an FYI, I saw online that the Ippudo prices in Japan are around 700 - 800 yen, which would be around $8, which people still complain in Japan as "expensive for ramen."

Man, this place made me wait 40+ minutes for seating. ÊI don't even think any NYC club has made me wait longer than 10min.

ÊYou will need those puppy dog eyes to bargain for seating if it comes down to your party being passed over. ÊMother gave me my big brown eyes for a reason, and I'll be damned if I don't use them! We had this pork appetizer in a bun which is reminiscent of the Peking Duck in a bun. ÊYum.. and most of the yum is from the pork fat. ÊI had the shoyu ramen which was so-so. ÊThe broth is flavorful, but nothing spectacular. ÊThere's hardly any meat in it. ÊI was very sad about that. And for some reason, I cannot stay away from the brulees of this world.

Ippudo has finally been implanted into the heart of NYC and my fellow New Yorkers now have a chance to experience the true taste of Ramen. Ê The broth is extremely flavorful and the noodles are perfect. Ê For the heavy eaters... definitely order the extra noodles that are place on the side. Ê The other items on the menu are average but did you really go to a place specializing in Ramen for Gyozas? Ê ÊThe price is a bit steep but you're paying for a nice enviroment with a very attentive staff. Ê For those who complain about the cost should stay home and make instant ramen noodles. Ê It is also a great place to take your significant other. Update: --------------------------------------------------?--------------- I went to Ippudo on July 10, 2008 and had the Spicy version of the ramen with an egg and pork belly and had extra noodles on the side.

In the pursuit of the quintessential ramen bar, Ippudo reminds us that sprucing up decor and ambiance does not push mediocre food into anything else. A noisy affair with an exposed kitchen juxtaposed against candle-lit tables built around fountains and trees, Ippudo doesn't seem to have it all together, including their dishes. And so, our search continues.

Ok let me say a thing or two about ramen: Ramen is one of those things in the world... There is good ramen and there is bad ramen. Whereas one says of things like pizza, vodka and sex; when it's good its really good and when it's bad... it's still pretty good, ramen is more like gin and rock 'n roll; (to quote Bowie): When it's good, it's really good, and when it's bad I go to pieces. If you have even a passing interest in ramen you owe it to yourself to see Itami Juzo's film "Tampopo." It's available on Netflix. In Japan, ramen is as ubiquitous as coffee is in the States, with a similar range in quality Êfrom "Did I just die and go to flavor heaven?", to clear violations of the Geneva convention. For many years the range of quality in New York ramen has regrettably been between "Wow! This almost tastes like ramen", and bowls of stuff that raise the philosophically tangled question of whether spaghetti in broth is Ramen just because you call it that. I was coming to the conclusion that just like you have to go to Dublin if you want an actual pint of Guinness, the first place you need to go to get a good bowl of ramen in New York City, was JFK. I am happy to say that in recent years this has changed. And clearly Ippudo is a player in that change. Of particular note is that Ippudo is one of the places offering a credible tonkotsu ramen in New York! This is the cloudy, pork-bone soup ramen characteristic of Ramen from Kyushu. I've always been partial to this variety so this pleases me greatly. Ippudo's noodles are of the thin and relatively firm variety. Smooth, but not quite silky. They hold up ok, but this is the hardest thing about ramen outside of Japan. The noodles are tricky and depend on many factors not necessarily under the control of a single establishment. That being said, these are certainly in the ball-park, and are well matched to the soups. The soups are what is of most interest. I've tried two of them: The more traditional Shiromaru (white-ball) is a pretty straight-forward tonkotsu with some really good balance and a rounded flavor. But the Akamaru (red-ball) is worthy of further study and investigation. Strong sesame and spice flavors. Very rounded but much bolder than the Shiromaru. Neither of the ramens are overloaded with "stuff," allowing the soup and the noodles to do the heavy lifting. Ippudo's Akamaru is a ramen that clearly says "Oh yeah! You're coming back for more of me!" I will obey.

Ippudo is overrated. There I said it. There are a number of other great ramen places in the East village, but Ippudo is the one everyone talks about. So, I decided to go and check it out for myself. It was ridiculous that everytime I tried, the wait is 1 hour, no matter what time of the day. Are you serious ? 1 HOUR WAIT to eat a bowl of cheap ramen? This better be the best golden ramen ever. Finally one night, I decided to wait the hour. Sat down, got the ramen, and the Pork buns. I have to say, that Pork bun appetizer is the best I've ever had. and the ramen? sorry. Nothing really that special. The noodles themselves were bouncy and the soup was thick and creamy. But will I wait 1 hour again for this? ...never. Good for a 1 time experience, but a repeated experience just for that 1 bowl for ramen? Go to Rai Rai Ken or Ramen Setagaya

Literally overrated. ÊVery long wait (Sunday, around 12:30pm, 45 minutes wait time for a table), at least $15-16 for a bowl of average ramen noodles, and chicken Êbuns that were lacking (they weren't stuffed; there was a lot of empty space inside the buns). Not worth the long wait and the $.

Best ramen I've had in New York so far. Definitely not your hole-in-the wall slurp down a bowl and get out joint that I'm still looking for, but the Akamaru was fantastic. The first taste of the soup was great and the noodles themselves were even better. My only complaint is that the bowl was rather small, especially for the price. I tried the pork buns that everyone seemed to like and it actually surprised me. The pork was very fatty, juicy, and melted in my mouth. The whole experience was delightful. The atmosphere is clean, hip, and young. It is a very stylized interpretation of a ramenya. I went at 2pm on a Friday and there was no wait at all. There was actually plenty of seating still open. I will definitely be back.

Last night I died and went to pork belly heaven. ÊThis is my obituary: A girl with a penchant for pork belly finally convinced her boyfriend to endure the long wait at Ippudo. ÊThey thought they were being smart by arriving at the restaurant at 11:45PM in order to avoid the notoriously long wait. ÊThey still waited 30 minutes to be seated for a midnight dinner. Ê They shared a bottle of Orion brew at the ramen-decorated bar before being escorted to a round communal table amidst the hustle and bustle of the dimly lit dining room. ÊThe ramen chefs all cheered boisterously as they entered. ÊDhale and bf thoroughly enjoyed the chic vibe of the dining room which elevated the ramen experience to a whole new level. The Fatty McFatFats ordered the Pork Hirata Buns, Samurai Pork Ribs Êand the Kakuni Pork Belly for starters. ÊOh, and a side of the cucumber salad to ease the guilt of consuming so much pork belly. ÊAs they bit into each morsel, their bodies were transcended into a euphoric state. ÊSo tender, juicy and moist with just the perfect balance of fat. ÊEven the cucumbers did not disappoint. ÊCool and crisp with a lovely hint of sesame chili oil. Ê After 4 courses of appetizers, they decided to split a bowl of the Akamaru Modern with, of course, pork belly. ÊThe broth's explosion of flavors induced an eye-closing-moment-of-silence from the couple. ÊRich and savory but never overpowering the natural essence of the soup. ÊGenerous portions of perfectly crispy pork belly floating atop the magical broth like little edible life preservers. ÊAnd endless threads of al dente ramen to bring this symphony together. ÊIt was mind blowing. They came home and laid their bodies down for the most satisfying food coma in history.

WOW. WOW. WOW. WOW. WOW Okay, so my buddy Justin E Êhighly recommended the place, so I couldn't pass it off. The entire week I was looking forward to going to Ippudo. I had my friends get a reservation first since I was stuck in traffic. He said 2 hours. We went to walk around the area and came back 2 hours later and still had to wait. We hit the bar and was tempted to order an appetizer, but didn't want to spoil our appetite. We ended up waiting a little over 3 hours in total (2 wandering around and another hour or so at the bar). Was it worth it? YES! TOTALLY WORTH IT. The table we were in line for had their check, but was taking forever to leave the table. My friend kept talking to the receptionist and asking what the problem was. We told him not to keep bothering her, or we would never get seated. Surprisingly, she came up to us and apologized that the party was taking forever on their check and put us for the next available table no matter what. Within 10 minutes of her talking to us, we were seated. Along with the bar area, the dining area was amazingly trendy. And of course the staff was as well. I was surprised to see some non Japanese waiters and cooks, which kind of threw me off because I thought the place was authentic Japanese. I would later find out that it didn't make a difference! The ambiance and design of the place had a good hint of modern and traditional Japanese, which was a great feeling. I recently discovered calpico hi, so I ordered that. WARNING FOR CALPICO HI DRINKERS: IT DOES NOT GO WELL WITH THE RAMEN! Or well IMO it doesn't. I will definitely make sure I stick to just water next time. The waitress came by and asked for our drink order, but we were so hungry that we put in our food order as well. I ordered the Karaka Kogashi Miso Ramen, but I heard that everything on the menu is delicious and you can't go wrong. We ordered the Ika and Mozzarella (correct me if I'm wrong) as an appetizer along with the pork buns. The Ika was interesting, but the pork buns were AMAZING. GET THEM! I added the pork belly to my ramen, and kind of regretted it. Don't get me wrong, the pork belly was good, just a little too much since the pieces were HUGE! FOR VEGETARIANS: They do have a vegetarian ramen that is not on the menu, so make sure you ask your server if it's available! Bottom Line: No way in hell would I have ever waited 3 hours for a meal, but the reviews on yelp and my friends have all said the place is amazing, so the wait didn't bother me that much. We were actually served within 10-15 mins after sitting down. The total time we spent eating was actually only 30 minutes. Prices are a little steep, but with the quality of the food and quickness and attentiveness of the service, you can't complain. I cannot stress how essential it is for you to get there early. If you plan on eating at 6, get there at like 4:30 or maybe even 4. You NEVER KNOW! BUT IT'S WORTH IT IN THE END! YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED! If I had one word to summarize the food? HEAVENLY! Oh it gets a little better..I also sat across from Jesse Eisenberg on my second visit here..AWESOME! haha!

So I finally went to Ippudo the other day with my boyfriend. Nice, modern interior and very attentive and friendly staff. Pork buns were delicious I'm glad I screned yelp before heading over to make sure to try the best dishes...what would I do without you yelpers? ;) And how can you frown upon 2for 1 $6 Sapporo on draft? Ippudo jump started me up with all the great things that I was looking so forward to hitting the climax- the ramen. Sadly, this is were they lacked and disappointed me. While the food was good, it did not have the "wow" factor. I'm sure everyone raves Ippudo for the impeccable service, the great Ênterior and the tasty appetizer but afterall, this is a ramen place. I cannot overlook the fact that the ramen was nothing to write home about although everything else was fantastic.

Found this due to another Yelper's recommendation and have become an incredible spokesperson for it. Ê Do not waste your time going for the mild version of the the Raman - you MUST have the Akamaru Modern - incredibly rich broth and delectable Raman noodles that are made downstairs in their noodle room. Ê If you want another treat, try the Friend Japanese peppers (which are not spicy the way you'd think) with a incredible salt mixture that makes all the difference. ÊAnd the sticky buns - both the chicken and the pork (as a bar appetizer) Ê- outta this world. This is one of the gems you will find in the East Village - and you will be pleasantly surprised.

I don't know about the utility of adding the 890th review -- seriously that's the number as I write this -- but here are a few quick notes: The wait times are as aggravating as everyone says. ÊHOWEVER we got there at 6:15 with 2 of our 3 person party and they could have sat us if we were all together. ÊPerson 3 showed up at 6:30 though, so we had to wait another 20 minutes. So I'm no advocate of eating dinner at 6:30 -- but if you are willing to, that could help. ÊThis place at 8:00 must be a disaster. The appetizers are just not that great. ÊI didn't try the buns though -- we tried all three special apps. The ramen is the best I've ever had -- better than Minca and Setagaya. ÊI love Setagaya's lack of pretense, but this place is just better on every aspect: the broth, the noodles, the quality of ingredients (its also NOT much more expensive). ÊMinca's broth compares, but their noodles are nowhere in the same category. A word on the character and consistency of these noodles: they transcend al dente, with a chewy give coupled with a satisfying floppiness. ÊThe incredibly rich broth slides off the noodles slowly, so they each bite is perfectly flavored. ÊIncredible noodles. ÊWAY better then any thing I've had elsewhere. I got the Classic, but the Modern and the chicken/shrimp are both very good. ÊFor first timers I'd recommend the Classic. Forgo the extra pork belly; it's completely unnecessary.

One of the Best Ramen Places in NYC. The broth of the ramen is full of flavor. there appetizer are delicious, the ambiance of the place is interesting. I was seated at the counter where we got to see everyone prepare all the food. Everyone there looks like they were all having fun and that they were all friend. I wish my work was like that. Great place to drink and chat with friends, not a place for kids or old people. For a Bowl of Ramen you are looking at about $14, which some would say is over priced. Also from being out of town we have to take a Taxi to get there. So you got to take in transportation cost into effect. But you know what? I would pay the $14 and would pay Taxi Ride just to eat there again. Ê For those that love Ramen, try it and make a decision for yourself.

It's February, and Ippudo still hasn't opened up shop, though it seems most of the construction of the NYC store is complete--they now have flyers posted in the windows looking for hires. Let's just hope they manage to get things started soon; we're long past the "Fall 2007 opening" now, and ramen on a hot summer day? No thanks. Still, if the NYC store is anything like the branches in Japan, it will be well worth the wait. The shiro-maru (white sea) is already quite good, but the real highlight is the aka-maru (red sea), which takes the shiro-maru and adds a spicy miso paste and garlic oil that gives the soup an incredible depth and complexity you'd never expect from ramen. The real kicker (if Ippudo brings it to the NYC store) is the lunch special, which adds six hitoguchi gyoza and a side of rice to the ramen for a set price of about $9. To be sure, the noodles are a tad soft to my taste, or at least at the Nishiki store in Kyoto. Then again, Ippudo's claim to fame is the soup. If you're looking for ramen that will really blow your mind, you'll have to directly go to Japan, to landmarks like Daiichi-asahi (http://daiichiasahi.com) or Shinpuku-saikan (http://shinpuku.net), which for better or worse certainly won't be coming westward anytime soon. Of course, this is ramen we're talking about; you can only make so-much of a fuss before it gets silly. But, just because it's overhyped now doesn't mean it isn't good; New York just hasn't had a taste of what a real ramen scene is like, and hopefully Ippudo can deliver. If it does, it will easily become my favorite ramen spot in the city--as long as they don't tamper with the menu.

I've been here three times and as much as I appreciate the spaciousness and profusion of friendly service the ramen just doesn't compel me to savor and slurp my bowl clean in Tampopo fashion. Granted the tonkotsu broth is rich and flavorful but I find it to be a touch too salty and oily for my liking. My gripe is not so much with the soup stock as it is with the noodles. A good broth engages your taste buds but it's the firm texture of curly ramen noodles that makes it a complete experience for me. It's the same type of satisfaction that comes with good soba noodles or perfectly al dente pasta. The noodles here are of the limp straight kind and as another reviewer stated lack the "resiliency that I love about ramen".

I've lost count of how many times I've been to Ippudo. And, I don't even want to begin thinking of how many calories I've consumed here. Everytime I go, I am compelled to order enough food to feed a family. The fresh noodles and savory broth are fantastic on their own, but the chicken wings and the pork buns? My goodness! If Heaven were something edible, I wouldn't doubt if it came in the form of Ippudo chicken wings and pork buns. Just thinking about it makes me want to hop in a cab and go put my name on the list.

What can I say about Ippudo, our own little piece of Japan in the heart of St Marks.. Probably some of the best pork-based Ramen you can get in the city and one of the best pork buns you can get... Now the problem with Ippudo is...the wait and the lines and the incredible number of hipsters and yuppies who crowd the bar, if you do have have a reservation, dont even try. The line begins half an hour before the restaurant opens and really doesnt stop till it closes. That being said the ambiance is nice but it is not a place you want to bring a first date to because of the massive amount of people and the estimated wait time. Overall though the food is excellent and really top of the line Japanese with few competitors in the city that match up to the dishes offered here.

Dropped in on a Sat night for dinner and we ended up waiting an hour and a half for a table, but!: By far. the best. Ramen. I have ever. tasted. The Hirata Buns were also delicious. All well worth waiting for, and you can order drinks and snacks at the bar up front (recommend the fried peppers). Incredibly delicious, fun atmosphere, and despite the long wait and the crowd up front, we never felt rushed or hurried. I also appreciated the hostess team, who managed the list well and seemed both pleasant and at ease despite the large number of people (pet peeve: obnoxious host/ess). I'll be back for sure, but perhaps lunchtime or midweek to avoid the biggest crowds.

OMG!! ÊRAMEN!! This place dishes out some scrumptious ramen and no it's not your instant noddle kind you noodlehead! ÊIt's the made from scratch kind. ÊThe broth (tonkotsu) is the amazing part of the whole dish. ÊIt tastes like it's been cooking for hours on end. ÊSlightly thick and packed full of flavor. ÊThey give you a nice big shallow spoon to help you scoop broth into your noodle-hole and Êto assist in the twirling of the noodles w/the chopsticks (modified Italian pasta eating style) to avoid splatters or sounding like a brute slurping away. If you feel like the "original/classic" ramen, the Shiomaru is the way to go. ÊThe Akamaru is also another dish on the must eat list. ÊI like it spicy, so I went for the Karakamen. ÊUnfortunately, I ordered spicy instead of super spicy. ÊDon't get me wrong, it packed kick, but I like a beat down once in a while. ÊFor the purposes of enjoying and tasting, spicy will do. The place is very relaxing. ÊIn the booths, walls have nice Japanese characters (the alphabet I was told) written down on it and the seats are lined w/tatami mats w/seat cushions for your bum for added comfort (just like in Japan). ÊHave yourself a beer and unwind to the yummy slurping going all around...

This place was so hyped up for me before I got to try it, that I thought for sure I was going to be disappointed... but NOPE! No disappointments here. The only annoying thing is that there is always a damn long wait. This still remains the top place that I want to take my boyfriend to, we tried last time but the wait was something ridiculous. But if it were up to me, I say the wait is worthwhile. The ramen and the damn pork buns are so DAMN GOOD that it makes you want to cry. How can noodles be so good??? It makes you wonder... The soup is delicious, rich, and sooo so so satisfying. The pork is nice and tender. The pork buns are a MUST get for your appetizer. The buns are soft and fluffy, and the pork is just right amount lean vs fat. Flavoring is amazing. I LOVE this place with all my heart (and mouth), but I really really wished they would expand it into a bigger restaurant.

Screw the noodles. Just give me the shinomaru broth. And a syringe. I was lucky enough to be invited to the soft opening...everything on the menu (minus drinks) was on the house. To be quite honest, the only thing worth getting is the ramen, which, despite the price, is good enough to muster up four stars. The other side dishes (marinated beef, pickled veggies) are okay but vastly overpriced. I haven't been there in quite some time only because the wait-times have gotten longer and longer.

Just got back from my first trip to Ippudo (Monday, December 28th), and had what potentially could have been a very good meal ruined by some awful service, not from the waitress, but more from the manager and the host/hostesses that ran the seating arrangements. ÊI really hate when I lose my appetite even before I've been seated. ÊThe ramen was solid-- had the "modern" ramen and probably would have enjoyed the food if I hadn't been owned multiple times in one meal. Ê Probably would have given it 4 stars, although, I've had better (Daikokuya out in LA). Ê My problems with the service/ management: 1. ÊPut ours names down at 6:30pm and did not get seated until 9:30pm for a party of 5. ÊAt 6:30, we were told that it would be 2 hours max. ÊAt 8:30, we were told that it would be no more than 40 minutes, but likely about 20 minutes. ÊIt was not until 9:15 where we had 3 different people from our party ask about our table that the manager decided to do something. ÊTheir solution was simple (which I suggested, might I add)-- put the 5 of us at a table for 4, which ended up being fine. ÊThis problem could have been solved hours ago, as we saw parties of 4 who came in 1.5-2 hours after us get seated before we did. 2. ÊAfter squeezing us at a table for 4, would not let an additional 6th person join our table, even though there would have been more than enough space for that. ÊThe manager basically told us that one person in our party had to leave, or else the 6th person would have had to just wait all over again. ÊRidiculous. ÊEven the waitress thought this was the most absurd thing ever, and apologized on her manager's behalf. ÊIt's really disappointing to find this type of management at a restaurant that serves high priced ramen, but I would get better service eating in a mall food court than at Ippudo. Ê I will not come back here again, unless the management decides to invite me back and do things correctly. ÊIt is not waiting 3 hours that bothers me-- it is being disrespected time and time again at a restaurant that is at a price point where I don't have to deal with these shenanigans. Do they have an e-mail or person I can speak to about the service I received? PS: ÊYou can't take out or bring left overs home. ÊTalk about wasting food, what a joke.

I really wanted to like it because of all the hype. The hour long waits are just not worth it. You go inside and the restaurant isn't even full. The soup and ramen are good, but I actually think the pork buns are better than the ramen, but again not worth the hour long wait for a table.

100TH REVIEW! I was thrilled last night at Ippudo, telling my eating companions that Ippudo would be my 100th on Yelp, because it's so worth it. I ate like a Queen. A very fat, Japanese Queen. The night started out with drinks and appetizers.... raw octopus, fried asparagus, little, fresh, pork/chicken/bbq sandwichy things. All amazing. We moved on to dinner: ramen, ramen, and another ramen, all being lovingly rotated around the three of us so that all could be tried. And all were good. Tea came out and then dessert... cheese and green tea ice cream! Oh, so good. The service was amazing. Everyone is having a good time and getting the vibe of the restaurant to be as authentic Japanese as possible, so don't be surprised if you are constantly hearing the servers and cooks shouting at each other in Japanese; according to one of my dinner companions, that's what they do over there. In a nutshell, Ippudo is a great experience, and wonderful for a date or a small group. It's a nice, clean place without being over the top fancy, and you certainly get what you pay for. Worth the wait!

Yes, I'm sold. Ê I don't actually know enough about food to comment on the "texture" or the "fragrance" or any of those fancy terms they throw around on The Food Network and NYT food columns. ÊSo my reviews/evaluations are steeped in the general atmosphere of the restaurant, the service and professionalism, and, well, the taste and presentation (in my somewhat limited layman's opinion). Ê The overall experience at Ippudo was terrific. ÊNobody enjoys long waits in line, but it's not the restaurant's fault for being popular. ÊIppudo goes above and beyond by providing frequent updates regarding where we stood on the list, and having a bar in the entry lobby so we could sit and sip on a drink instead of awkwardly staring at the other patrons. It was a snowy day--imo perfect for warm ramen--but the crowd was a bit thinner. ÊOur wait (for two) was only 30 minutes or so. ÊWe got the pork belly, which literally melted in my mouth. ÊIt was sooo tender, I could've eaten three more servings. ÊThe ramen was great as well. ÊI got Kamo Nanban, and was too full from one bowl to order the $2 Kae-dama noodle refill. Ê However, the best part about ippudo isn't the food, it was the open layout, communal seating, and exciting staff. ÊIt's easy to feel at ease at a place like this. ÊYou don't have to be self conscious about slurping your soup, or using the utensils the correct way, or any of the etiquette that comes with eating out at a fancy place. ÊAt the same time, it's not too loud or too crowded to hold conversation, and the service is at the top of its class as far as casual NYC restaurants go. Yeah, it's a bit pricey. ÊIf you need your ramen fix three times a week then Ippudo is probably not for you, but if you're like me and enjoy a bowl of good ramen every couple of months, then the extra $10-15 is well worth it.

I heard a lot of good things about Ippudo so it was one of the first restaurants I tried after moving to New York. I love noodles (esp ramen) but I was a little bit lost after looking at the menu. The waiter was really friendly and recommended the Akamaru Modern which is supposed to be the most popular one. I was eye-balling a few other spicy dishes but decided to play it safe with this one. I didn't love it...but I didn't hate it. I don't think i'd order it again. The noodle quality was good but once again, I just didn't like it THAT much. For a restaurant that gets so much buzz I was honestly expecting better. The broth was a bit on the salty side for my taste, and usually i LOVE soup but I didn't end up finishing this one. The pork was yummy though and I like how they prepare their eggs for the ramen so I would definitely recommend adding egg. I got the pork buns as appetizer and they were GOOD. The bun is nice and fluffy and the pork is fatty and tender. I want to go back to Ippudo sometime and try another item on their menu. Maybe the Akamaru Modern just didn't particularly suit my taste. The atmosphere is fun and loud but don't expect too much privacy, which is surprising. I could hear the awkward conversations of the people on a date right next to me.

An excerpt from my food blog about Ippudo. Visit my blog: http://www.backstreats.cÉ for a thorough review that encompasses: History of the restaurant, Location, Ambiance, Service, and Food. "Buns. How I love thee. Let me count the ways. 24/7. 365. The "Hirata Buns" have a beautifully large piece of Berkshire pork belly with Asian mayo for a little twang and a sauce that added a very faint, spicy afterglow. The pork was tender and had just the right amount of fat to melt away in my mouth. All the ingredients were caught in the embrace of a fluffy white bun. It wasn't like many pork buns I have tasted before. Most of them were on a slightly sweeter side. But, I really liked the change of pace. $8 is a little on the pricey side for these gems. Seeing how I was thoroughly distraught when I finished them, I would still definitely recommend getting them at least once. For the main course, my server chose the Akamaru Modern. The description Ê"'The original tonkotsu' soup noodle with Ippudo's special sauce, pork belly chashu, cabbage, kikurage, scallions, miso paste & fragrant garlic oil" seemed a bit of an understatement when she brought out the beautiful red bowl. The broth was lovely and rich. The combination of the garlic oil and the miso paste just melded into a symphony of flavors. It was savory and hearty and definitely worth slurping my ramen loudly. Japanese etiquette, you know. If you're not slurping, you're being offensive to the chef. The noodles were perfectly cooked as well with just enough firmness to not become soggy in the hot broth. Bravo, your highness, bravo. I decided to splurge that lovely day. I ordered mascarpone cheese and ice cream for dessert. In a word, B-E-A-UTIFUL. A delicate green tea ice cream, cylindrically shaped, was topped with mascarpone cheese, crushed pistachios, and chocolate shavings. All placed on top of a sweet trail of honey."

DUDE!!. Êhave you had this stuff? it feels like someone took your favorite blanket + your mom's hug somehow converted into a culinary rendition then served in a pretty red bowl with an egg on top. the noodles are yellow and super chewy...but different.... depending on which style you get. the spicy paste is nothing i've ever had here in the west coast! it's super intense and it's not just sichimi that other places use. ippudo uses... i think a combination of chili flake, sesame oil, pepper soy, garlic, etc. Êetc...which is super spicy and PERFECT for the miso/pork broth. and when you drink the thick, fatty, delicious, pork-flavored broth, you're instantly HOOKED. like CRACK......yeah...i think i'd smoke ippudo ramen if i could. ingest it any way i know how. i'm disgusting...huh? and as you're coming down from your high...you desperately clench onto your bamboo chopsticks in your hand swishing and swirling the broth for that ONE...LAST...BITE....and then you realize...there's a better way! ah-hah! im a friggin genius.

I came here for a late lunch and was fortunate enough to avoid the line. There was virtually no wait. But I have to say that the hostess needs to work on being a little nicer to customers. I hate it when people act like they're doing you a huge favor by letting you dine at their restaurant. Lose the ego already. I was greeted with the traditional loud yelling 'irasshaimase!!!' by the entire kitchen staff. I ordered a miso ramen from the waitress who was quick and friendly. Overall it was good but I would've loved it more with less ginger. While tasty, it didn't knock my socks off and honestly, I've had better ramen in San Francisco. It's a satisfying bowl but I would probably not want to wait in line for an hour for it. With my glass of iced green tea, the total came to $20 with tip. A bit pricey in my opinion but it is New York. 4 and a half stars for the food. Minus 1.5 stars for the mean chick up front.

BEST tasting of all the popular ramen joints I've been to so far ... yes, even better than Momofuku - at Ippudo, you don't feel like you're dying from clogged arteries after eating a bowl of ramen The broth is extremely tasty (borderline salty but all of them are!) and the noodles are genuine hand-made goodness ... it's made fresh within the premises (and tastes it) and with just the perfect ramen texture - Ê I've had both the shiromaru classic and akamaru modern, which has the 'special sauce' and I must say I like akamaru better maybe because it's slightly spicy. To be honest, both of the ramens taste similar, at the end of the day so don't strain yourself trying to pick the right one I've also been there both in my indulgent and my conservative moods (i.e., order-every-ramen-topping-possible, and keep-it-plain-and-simple) and I must say I came out a happier customer just keeping my order as is, WITHOUT the extra pork belly, chashu and hard boiled egg toppings. I rave about Ippudo but still give it a 4 stars because my first time at Ippudo has never been topped by any other subsequent visit. I get a feeling, it's easy to get sick of eating Ippudo ... It really is a once-a-month or once-every-two-months kinda place

Ippudo is a wondrous restaurant where Êthe noodles are tasty and thin and broths have more flavours than you can imagine. For appetizer, you must get the steam pork buns (x2!)

ÊIt comes with salad, rice with your choice of topping, I recommend the eel. ÊYUM! ÊGiant bowl of ramen. ÊDelicious. ÊWe also ordered the pork buns, but I'm not a fan of mayo in my pork buns. I would definitely recommend!

[I am Japanese. I am picky when it comes to Japanese foods] Ippudo's Ramen reminds of Ramen from Japan. (I hate fake Americanized Ramen....I don't even want to call them as Ramen ) but I have to say when this place open, Ramen tastes 100% better. I am guessing that most of Japanese real Ramen chefs went back to Japan...Now I see non-Japanese chefs in the kitchen. My favorite - Akamaru. Reason of 4 stars - I know they can provide better one. Like when this place opened. - Long wait... Long long lo~~~ng wait time to get in there.

Meh.... Went there with my sister, bro-in-law, and two friends. Decor was cute, menu not so much. Not vegetarian friendly at all. There were a few vegetable choices as far as appetizers, but no vegetarian ramen. I asked if they could prepare a veg ramen and was told no. So while everyone chowed down on what looked to be delicious ramen dishes, I ate appetizers. I was very unpleased. I think this place received a lot more credit than was deserved.

My brother brought me to Ippudo during my visit last month-- he had been raving about the ramen ever since I arrived. I had my doubts that they could serve up a better bowl of ramen than my favorite ramen joint (Santouka) in Los Angeles but I was open to giving it a try. So, they say you should never judge a book by its cover... Ippudo is hip, modern chic, clean and looked so shiny and new... which, well, to most people, is probably a sound choice when it comes to restaurants, but to me, it seemed like another Asian restaurant trying to appease the non-Asian crowd. I imagined folks who knew nothing about ramen raving about this place when they couldn't you tell the difference between Soba noodles and Ramen noodles. Basically... just another gimmicky P.F. Chang-type spot. But I digress... and I was terribly mistaken. Ippudo was pretty damn amazing-- the Berkshire Pork Belly Buns and the Akamaru Ramen were both excellent. Ippudo is probably one of the better ramen joints I've been to but I think paying $13 for a bowl of ramen and modern chic Êdecor is a bit steep-- considering I can get a $8 bowl at Santouka.

As a ramen-lover, I was so excited when this place first opened up. The first few visits were just to die for - soooo delicious! Then as what happens with most restaurants, they lost their touch. ÊEither the master chef who came over to train all the others has left the country, or they just started slacking. My favorite - the Akamaru - is still delicious, but I rather go sit at the bar and have some of those AMAZING pork buns, sip some sake, and call it a night. Ê:)

1/2011 Ê ÊEDIT: ÊOk i've been back here 4-5 times since my first review and I am lowering the stars from 3 stars to 1 star. ÊThe hirata buns came with n extra dose of mayo and it made them actually kind of gross. Ê And the ramen - i've tried to give it so many chances and this was the LAST ONE. Ê The inconvenience of a 1+ hour wait is most defintely not justified by my ramen which came with TWO PIECES OF PORK FAT instead of the formerly FATTY PIECES OF PORK BELLY. Inedible and disgusting. ÊI used to love the broth but even the broth now doesnt do it for me. never again. 4/23/10: MMmmm....Not to say their broth isn't super tasty and probably the tastiest our of all the other ramen places i've been to, but.... its freakin ramen. seriously. ÊThe first bite is always good but then I kind lose interest and then i cant wait to just be done with it. Ê I actually prefer their appetizers and side dishes over the actual ramen. The atmosphere is nice and they have a nice selection of Japanese beer and sake. Ê But its not worth the wait for me. ÊThe only reason I have gone back 3-4 times is because i have friends who like it or have never tried.

My friends were raving about this place for the longest time. Thus, the first time we went, the line was super packed and we couldn't get a table til 2 hours or so later. We opted for Bonchon. But, the second time we went, we made sure we went just right before the opened and got a table(45min wait). But , totally worth it. The Decor is AMAZING. beautiful, japanese like and very very friendly staff. I loved the interior design. IT was noisy but had a fun ambience to it. I ordered the Spicy ramen (forgot name), but it was amazing!!! I couldn't finish it but everything just melts in your mouth. It was piping hot when the server served it to me and i could taste everything. THe flavors just was wow. the noodles were equally amazing. I heard its handmade and definitely A+ class. I haven't tried other noodle joints in NYC ,but this one is a fav. I also had their hot sake. it wenet down smoothly and it was my first time. I liked it. Go give it to a try!

4.5 STARS!!! The ramen here are delicious! ÊI got the Shiromaru Hakata Classic. It's definitely worth experiencing. I went around 5:30pm and waited about 15minutes on a weekday. If you go after 6pm the wait can take up to 2 hours or sometimes maybe even more. They do not take reservations beforehand so definitely expect to wait. You can always get a few drinks at the bar while you wait. The bar and restaurant has a very cool ambiance. The bar is energetic and the drinks are very tasty. I really like Japanese ramen and I have to say this is one of the best I've tried. I like more citrus drinks. For drinks I recommend Shochu w/ Fresh Squeezed Grapefruit Juice or Yuzu Citrus Sake. It's both very refreshing but not too sweet and not too strong on the alcohol. VERY GOOD!

Damnnnn. 26 reviews already for this place and it just opened! NYC is going ramen crazy fo sure. It bugs me how my beloved ramen is going from an affordable and convenient meal to a now overpriced and over-crowded affair. It was smart that they built a bar in the lobby cause man there's going to be some long ass waits. -Has better pork than setagaya's dried cubes of meat. -Agree that they may need a little more ingredients but not overflowing like momofuku's. -Really buttery soup that made me wonder how many calories I was intaking. -Need more than one piece of pork! (!st trip tried special version and had one juicy piece of fatty pork. I tried the regular one on my 2nd trip and there were two pieces thinly sliced. Do they offer different types of pork cut for different bowls?) -Need some kick ass gyoza too! I bet a lot of people who claimed setagaya was the best ramen will now change reviews. haha. Êi love NYC foodies. ps. went to momofuku again today and my conclusion is: it sucked. ÊThe broth is too pork braised flavored and the shredded pork was too dry. ÊI couldn't even finish the soup and that means a lot. ÊAnd $15 for your ramen is way too much! ÊThe noodles are definitely not as good as setagaya or ippudo.

Came here at around 10pm on a Friday, was told the maximum waiting time is 1.5 hours. Well, because of its fame we decided to stick around and see what's up. We ended up getting a table after about 30-35 minutes. I must say I like restaurants that over-estimate waiting times (a psychological trick that never gets old). The decor of the place is very "trendy," the reason I put a quotation mark around the word is because I personally didn't like the decor at all. There were several large tables where different groups of customers share the same table, and just like what my sister told me, it was hard not to overheard other people's conversations. I don't really remember what the restaurant looks like exactly, but I remember there was this giant white wall amongst mostly black/red motif, that was covered in Hiragana and Katagana. Just seemed kind of clashing in my opinion. My sister and I ordered the same ramen, the Original Tonkotsu Hakata. My sister added the Braised Pork Belly, Bamboo Shoots, and the Spicy Paste; I added Bamboo Shoots and a Poached Egg. In addition we also ordered the Japanese Celery & Wild Mushroom in Dashi Broth. The appetizer was great, with very clean flavors. I grew up eating stuff like this so it was like a blast from the past. It was a bit ridiculous to charge $7 for a tiiiiny little mounds of veggies tho. Ok, let's talk about the ramen. I thought it was honestly just ok. The noodle itself was on the thinner side, and even though my sister said it had a great texture, I thought it was still a bit soft. I'm used to ramen noodles that are on the thicker side with relatively chewier texture. Also, the amount of noodles were not a lot considering the bowl of ramen (without ANY toppings) costs like $12 or $13. For someone like me that's used to a $8.50 bowl of ramen from Daikokuya it was kind of hard to swallow. In terms of the style of the ramen, it is Kyushu, which is my favorite. However, the broth was on the saltier side. My sister told me that a lot of times people don't finish up the soup, but it's usually the best part of the ramen (especially with Kyushu style because the soup has all the yumminess and nutrition from pork bones) for me. Again, I couldn't help but compare with Daikokuya. Topping wise the ones we ordered were pretty solid. The Poached Egg was perfect. The yolk had a runny texture but not completely uncooked, and the bamboo shoots were tender and crunchy. My sister's Pork Belly had a good flavor but the seasoning was a bit too heavy for me. I did like the Spicy Paste my sister ordered though. It reminded me of a spicier XO-Sauce, even though my sister didn't agree. All of that cost $47.90. Yiiiiiiiiiiiiiikitty Yikes. Ramen is street food.

So we came here hoping the ramen would knock our socks off. ÊSo we tried their classic ramen, and order of the cold ramen salad, and some pork buns. Ê The pork buns came out first. ÊYou should have seen our faces. ÊI think we were drooling before the waiter even put the plate down. ÊThe pork buns were absolutely, amazingly, delicious. My husband and friend both ordered the classic ramen. ÊI had a taste and I thought the ramen was good. ÊThe broth was very very flavorful, but the noodles didn't seem right. ÊThey didn't seem like "ramen" noodles. ÊOh well. ÊAlso, more meat in it would've been good. I shared the cold ramen salad with my girlfriend. ÊThe flavor was pretty good and it was very "refreshing".

This is THE original place that made me LOVE eating out for ramen, so naturally, I had to come back! ÊThe Akumaru modern tasted just like I remember it, extremely flavorful with the perfect garnishes to accentuate the taste. ÊThe Hirata buns had the really fatty, flanky meat, but was SOOOOOOOO gooooooooooddddd!!!! a MUST ORDER!!!! Salivating as I'm writing this review....New items I tried this time was the hot shishito peppers which was good and an eel donburi type bowl(can't rem the name). ÊThe eel was nice and tender, but both were dishes that I don't necessarily need to order every time.

I really wanted to like Ippudo, I've heard so much about this place and the legendary ramen. The wait was about 2 hours since we had a group of 8, to me it's not a real down side as far as ratings go. Waiting just makes me hungry :) Ippudo's website states that they transformed ramen to art. I totally agree the ramen looked beautiful and the price accompanied it. I had the pleasure of sampling 4 ramens during my trip (Shiomaru Nikuiri and Akamaru Shin-Aji, Miso, and Shoyu and an order of extra pork) I'm a huge fan of Shio ramen, I love the salted pork broth. Nothing in my mind comes close to that creamy, flavor filled soup. To my dismay I really felt that their ramen was a bit too delicate and complex in flavors. to my ramen is supposed to be simple and flavorful. Their pork was not outstanding, I've had pork prepared better at Santouka (toroniku) and that's in a grocery store food court. The combination of the delicate broth, mediocre pork, and high prices earn Ippudo 3 stars. I would much rather enjoy a both of Santouka Ramen or Ichiraku Ramen, If I can find it ;) It's an experience none-the-less so if you're visiting and have plenty of time to dine, you should stop by. If it's your first real ramen experience even better!

I swore I would never wait an hour standing in the line for ramen. It defies the logic of having ramen, which is supposed to be fast food. ÊSo we were walking around the area on a saturday evening and it was 15 min to opening time and we figured we might as well give it a try. We got in promptly 15 min later. ÊAnd I must say the ramen was very good. The broth was rich and flavorful. It is definitely not the typical ramen that one would get in Japan. There were special touches to the recipes and one gotta go to a specialty ramen shop even in Japan to have this type of flavors. Ê So was it worth a 15 min wait? Definitely. But anything over 30 minutes I would give it a pass, because, at the end of the day its just ramen.

This place is really full of itself. ÊI got there at 9pm, and even though there was only one other party waiting, the hostess told me that there was a 30 minute wait. ÊThis is what I hate about over-hyped restaurants, they always purposely make it seem more popular than it is. ÊWell, only 10 minutes later we were seated. I did not like the texture of the noodles, they seemed to be a lot thinner than normal ramen noodles and the soup base was too oily. ÊDon't bother ordering the extra large version unless you like to eat dry ramen noodles, as it comes with a portion of noodles on the side without additional soup. ÊI'm baffled, extra large at every ramen place I have been to means that the bowl is larger with more noodles and soup. ÊHow can you just eat ramen without soup?!@?!?@ I would not recommend this place and won't be going back.

When we read that there were lines to get in..........no kidding. On Sunday, even before it was opened a long line formed. We both shared cucumber (in sesame oil, etc.) and their famous pork buns (two small buns, each with small piece of pork/lettuce in some spicy sauce) appetizer. ÊBoth tasted great, but both were way overpriced for $8 each appetizer. As for main, I had the seared tuna (in some citrus soy sauce), and my wife had the shio ramen with extras added (egg and pork belly). ÊThe seared tuna dish was good, but definitely not to be ordered as a main (very small in portion). ÊMy wife really enjoyed her ramen, but next time probably will not ask for the extra pork belly; it was basically one huge piece of fat (pretty disgusting to even look at). ÊI was able to try her ramen; it tasted good, but a bit salty and way too greasy (I could feel my arteries clogging from just eating this). Even though she enjoyed her ramen, she didn't think it was worth the $20 for a bowl with the few extras. Ê Service was pretty good, considering that they were swamped. Overall, we enjoyed our culinary experience at Ippudo.

Well, well, well what can I say about one of the trendiest Ramen noodle restaurants in NYC. Ippudo left something to be desired. In other words it was disappointing. After a half hour waiting to be seated, we were led to the general dinning area. The decor was very trendy and pleasing to my eyes but after sitting down for a couple of minutes I realized the constant yelling of the cooks and the waiters really started to annoy me. It is hard to have any meaningful conversation with all the noise pollution. My Japanese girlfriend tested the hostesses on their japanese. It turns out that management only train these girls on what to say in Japanese. As they were unable to answer questions they heard in Japanese. Oh well go figure! Well onto the food and drinks, I started out with Kirin Beer. Which is always good and did not disappoint this time. The main dish we had was Shoyu Ramen. That was a big dissapointment. While the broth was mediocre and the noodles were bland. The soup completey lacked or was short on Êsome of the traditional items you find like boiled eggs, naruto, scallion. The Shoyu broth was ok but even the pork cutlet was tough and tasted bad.The bowl even seemed smaller than the standard Shoyu Ramen bowl served at many other places I have been to. The other appetizers made up for the Ramen. Kaarage served with spicy mayo was delicious. Tako Yamaimo Ponzu appetizer (Octupus in ponzu ) was also tasty. These appetizers save this shop from getting a complete 1 from me. A restaurant cannot fail on the main dish when that is the restaurant's specialty. They are much better Ramen shops all over NYC. Momofuku, Rai Rai Ken are some that come to mind. Not worth the wait. Only value is if your trying to meet trendy people at the restaurants bar.

My friend and I attempted to try out Ippudo on a week night but when we arrived, we were greeted by a crowd of people waiting to get in. It felt silly to wait on line for ramen since there's so many other good places to go in the East Village. The trick is to go on a Sunday morning for brunch. You may be asking yourself, "who eats ramen for brunch?" EXACTLY!!!! ÊWe got there right before noon and the place was full but we were seated right away. The ramen is Êworth every dollar in my book. **Just noticed that for some reason yelp does not list Ippudo's Sunday hours. hehe! perhaps, that is one of the reasons why we Êdidn't have to wait for Êa table. According to their website, they are open: Sunday, 11 am to 11pm. Does someone know how to change the hours on here? Wait, do me a favor and don't. :)

We came exactly at 5, when it has just opened, so we got seated right away. I was amazed by the place because it was sooo.. elegant.. well the image of a ramen place in LA was like small place, and not so decorative. The waiter was kinda not so friendly, maybe because it was getting crowded, but they are loud, like every 1 minute they shout something in Japanese.. We ordered the pork bun and the Akamaru modern for each of us. The pork bun was delicious, the bun was so soft and so do the pork. I added egg and also the chili paste for my ramen. It tasted pretty good and tasteful. The broth was so.. indescribable.. and the egg was the one that i loved the mostt.. yummmmmm well, the price was also so different with the ramen in LA.. we can get 2 portions of LA ramen for each of Ippudo ramen..

Everything was tasty, we ordered the pork buns, ribs, edamame and entrees were the ramen. ÊMost of us ordered the Modern and Êmy husband ordered the Classic. ÊHe ordered "extra noodles" but was very full at the end (and hes not a tiny guy!) The pork buns were good (but Momofuku is better). ÊI didn't have any of the ribs but it looked good drenched in sauce and spiced on top. ÊThe broth was very rich and the noodles were yum.

Holy shmoly - + 1200 ratings already??? ÊI wonder how mine will contribute!? ÊI'll try my best.... Once inside, I was quite surprised that this very busy place was huge! ÊTables wrapped around the whole restaurant. ÊI found my one of my 3 friends I was meeting at the bar. ÊIt was still happy hour (yay! Ê2 for 1 6$ ippudo! 5-8PM) so we got some beers while we waited.

ÊBut to ease the pain, we got several more rounds of 2 for 1 beers. Nice. After TWO hours, we got seated next to an odd group of two extremely fob asian girls + their american male banker escorts whose conversation literally was like this: Ê"Why wouldn't you date me??

ÊThe chicken buns were delicious! ÊThey were slightly spicy which was nice. ÊThe texture of the bun was soft and not soggy like some places I've been. ÊWe then ordered our ramen. ÊOne got a vegetarian tonkotsu (yes they do vegetarian versions!), the rest got the Shiromaru Hakata Classic. Ê Once I got my ramen, I immediately tried the soup. ÊWow. ÊFirst sip was golden. ÊThe flavor is very rich and totally different from other ramens I've ever had. ÊAfter the first couple, utterly mind blowing, amazing bites, all I could think about was how much MSG + what is the sodium level of this soup!??! ÊHowever, I kept eating it because it was so addictive. ÊRegarding the noodle to soup ratio, I personally thought the amount of noodles in it were fine because I was quite full after I finished.

Ippudo took my expectations, threw them into a blender, and then threw that blender into AN ADDITIONAL blender! ÊIf this image is to absurd for you to handle, I'll use plain language - My expectations were sufficiently surpassed and destroyed and I freaking loved it. The Akamaru modern was absolutely out-of-this-world awesome. ÊI have had amazing ramen in Tokyo and this easily stood toe-to-toe with it. ÊThe ramen masters in the kitchen put together a fantastically creative dish that I loved from the first bite. It is an amazing amalgamation of their special sauce, miso paste, garlic oil, pork, cabbage, onion, kikuragi, and scallions. ÊAlso every employee yells a greeting when you come in, which is great. I also got to try the Kogashi Miso(spicy) and it was really, really great. ÊThis dish did unto my taste buds what Arnold did to the Predator(dropped a huge log on them and forced them to self-destruct). Also, props on the decor, which is super slick and very comfortable. ÊExcellent for casual and date levels. OK I will now just capitalize AKAMARU MODERN RAMEN for those people quickly browsing this yelp page of seemingly endless reviews.

I am not saying that this place isn't awesome...but I am more of an okinawa noodle kind of guy. ÊThe soup is awesome but the only gripe I got is that the noodles aren't chewy. Ê The buns filled with pork belly or spicy chicken are awesome and you could sell that from a cart on every corner in the city and you would make a killing. I fortunately went on a tuesday before the lunch rush and did not have to wait the ridonculous 2 hours wait for these noodles. ÊIf i had waited and gotten what I had gotten I would have probably put them down for a 2 star. ÊI know I sound like a noodle snob but I like what I like and if I wanted that type of noodle I would have gone to eat soba.

Wow, 1400+ reviews... I guess to add mine would be pointless but let me at it anyway. I'm a huge fan of ramen, bouncy noodles, luscious broth. What's not to like? When an out-of-towner comes all the way from Boston and insisted on going to Ippudo, I know there was something about the place. So I meant to go and try on my own for a long time. The decor is pleasing, from the calligraphy on the cloth outside combines with the wooden exterior, to the wall at the bar full of ramen bowls, to the white wall of Japanese characters. It's decidedly trendy and forward. After waiting for around 20 minutes, I got seated at the bar and I was immediately feeling the welcome howls and the thank you howls that echoed throughout the establishment whenever a customer steps in and leave this world of ramen. The waitstaff and chefs in the kitchen wear colorful festive traditional garb adds to the ambiance. The advantage of seating at the bar, is the ability to see the chefs behind the counter preparing food. The chef in front of me was ceremonially peeling and cutting asparagus with awe-inspiring precision. I understand it might be quite cliche but I almost can feel the respect taken to the ingredient. After going back and forth with the menu and being extremely aware of my choice to yell out "kae-dama" and get additional noodles for $2, I ordered the Shiromaru Hakata Classic with additional corn and additional kakuni. The regular bowl of noodles without the additions would be $14 and with the additions it costs a whooping $20. But I wasn't going to skim on things since I've waited long enough and was famished. During the waiting and checking out the food preparations in the kitchen, I've decided to order the Hirata Pork Buns. The Hirata Pork Buns came first, they are slightly spicy braised pork in peking duck style white steamed buns with a few dabs of mayo. I had been wanting to try Momofuku's pork buns but was too lazy to walk there so having these have satisfied some of my other culinary urges. They were ok, not spectacular and probably not worth the $8. The bowl of noodles however was great. The ramen are thin and really al dente. I'm not really used to that degree of teeth-bounciness. I was very glad that I'm gotten the kakuni because it's the single most delicious item I've tasted, the hard boiled egg on top was cooked perfectly with the yolk still soft shining a bright yellow gleam. The broth is made from pork bone, delicious and filling. I honestly don't think I can kae-dama it. I was content and happy that I tried Ippudo, The pricing-wise it's very steep. I justify it by thinking that if I go to a high class restaurant I'd probably be paying more for a simple lunch and since I do love ramen, I'd just be as happy or happier to dine at Ippudo but I'm also reminded that Ajisen Ramen in Chinatown also have a kakuni (tenderous ribs) ramen for $7.95. I can probably save a bunch in sacrifice of the magnificent display of cooking skills but I was glad for the experience.

On a summer day, I came here with my sister when my friend was just getting out of work at Ippudo. She recommended the Hirata Buns, which uses the steamed bun you get from Peking Duck. There's a choice of pork or chicken. I went with the chicken because its healthier but I heard the pork bun was the best. It was 2 pieces for $8. Then we each got a bowl of ramen. My sister wanted more noodles. At Ippudo, you can get extra noodles for $2 by ordering "Kae-dama" as long as you have enough soup in your bowl.

Loved IPPUDO Japan, and so glad it's in NYC, I make it a MUST STOP everytime I am in the city. Rich, flavorful, DEEP broth with all of their ramens with the most juicy pork and perfectly slightly more al dente noodles. ÊThey must put crack in that broth because theirs is the ONLY broth that I drink (don't want hypertension!) ÊSitting as a group with unknown strangers slurping away orgasmic noodles is always fun :). Service is great, everyone greets you (typical Japanese fashion) and the interior has a cool old-mixed with new vibe. ÊSkip the appetizers and go for the ramen (the shrimp ocotopus in ponzu jelly was....gross). I miss you.

Ippudo is a Japanese restaurant that has been receiving a lot of media praise lately. Is it deserved? Well, the aesthetic of the restaurant is wonderful. It's a beautiful space that is meticulously decorated. The staff are highly attentive. And there's the Japanese schtick to amuse you: the host or hostess announces your arrival and the entire staff greet you as take your seat. It makes for a unique dining experience. But dining is about food and, for me, that's where Ippudo does not deserve praise. I ordered the vegetarian ramen, which I learned about from another Yelper's review. (The vegetarian ramen is not on the menu.) It was the blandest ramen I've ever eaten. It was comprised of mushrooms and a small amount of tofu. It was seriously disappointing. I have had really great vegetarian ramen at Rai Rai Ken (http://www.yelp.com/biz/É), so I know that it's possible to make a tasty vegetarian ramen dish. VEGETARIANS, BE WARNED: Ippudo is not for you or me.

After 2 weeks of engaging in the ever-unpleasant experience of eating lunch at my desk, I felt like a caged animal and decided to venture out of my neighborhood to Ippudo for lunch on Friday with a colleague. There was a brief wait since we were there during peak lunch time, and as we sat at the bar, I was already starting to get annoyed by the noise level. I guess this a good spot if you're going stag during lunch, but it was difficult to carry a conversation over the constant Japanese greetings. I forgot the name of exactly what I ordered, but I think it was the classic Ramen, I should also say that this was my first Ramen experience outside of the 6/$1 ramen nights during my dirt poor college days, so ÊI wasn't sure exactly what to expect. Overall, the flavor of the noodles were ok but I wasn't too wowed by the taste and had to ask for the hot chili powder to top it off. I might go back again by myself and try another dish.

I liked their decor better than I like their food. ÊIt was just okay and didn't live up to it's hype. ÊI really wanted to love this place because I heard such great things and I really loved the way they designed the place, especially the bar counter; there was ramen under the glass...very clever and cute. ÊI love the atmosphere and design of the space. ÊIt was unique and very nicely done. Ê The noodles and the broth were good, but after a while it got pretty salty. ÊI don't know it they were having an off day or what, but their meat was pretty dry. ÊTheir pork buns were good though and much better than their ramen. Oh and the wait for a table is kind of crazy, I think we had to wait a little over an hour. ÊWe actually walked over to Mark's during that hour to eat a few sliders while we waited for our table. ÊSo get there early or do not go there hungry. ÊI might come back in the future and give this place another shot. ÊI'll write an update when I do.

Cons: - Long long wait (not sure if it's worth it) - Ramen isn't as good as hyped up to be. - Prices are sky high, even in NY terms. - Weird waiting list rule where you have to be in line of sight of the Greeter for your name to be called. Hard to explain. Basically, can't risk going to the bathroom, filling the meter, stepping outside. Pros: - Pork Buns are awesome. I want one now. - Combo option. You can choose to combo-ify? Combify? Combolate? your ramen to come w/ a side of rice and topping. I chose the Grilled Eel (Unagi). It was very very good. Better than the ramen. - The salad dressing on the combo is crack cocaine. - Ramen tasted alright, but they cheap out on noodles and toppings. Like 2-3 slices of meat. - Usually Japanese waiters are kinda douchey (Looking at you KENKA!), but the ones here were very nice and attractive. Summary: Stop by. If the wait is longer than 30 minutes go elsewhere. If you got the time go for it. The ramen itself isn't that great but the pork buns are a must try. Also, combo up that jam b/c that rice is great. Was gonna rate it 3 stars, but the pork buns and combo option gave it the extra star.

I was curious to see if Ippudo would live up to the hype, especially after having tried several other really good ramen places in the past. First, let's talk about the wait... or lack of a wait, actually... We drove in from NJ on Sunday morning and parked a couple of blocks away. Since Ippudo opens at 11am and we were worried about the wait, we actually showed up around 10:30am and were the only people there. Within the next 20 minutes, several more people showed up and a small crowd started to form. Everyone was seated quickly as soon as they opened and we noticed anyone arriving between 11-11:30am were pretty much able to be seated immediately. My tip is that if you want to avoid a long line, get there early. Now, onto the ramen. I ordered the Shoyu ramen and hubby ordered the Classic. We both thought that the noodles were by far the best noodles we have had at any ramen place and so yes, they absolutely lived up to the hype. The broth was also very good. The pork itself was nothing special (which is the primary reason for the 4-star rating) but I suppose it's the noodles and broth that are really important. Pricing was okay by NYC standards ($13 for shoyu ramen and $14 for Classic). The service was friendly and ambiance very pleasant. So did it live up to the hype? I'd say yes -- it wasn't anything mind-blowing but it was still some of the tastiest ramen I've ever had.

I'm not going to lie. I was BLOWN AWAY by the food. I don't even need to describe it, it's just insanely tasty. The BIG PROBLEM with this place is their ridiculous seating method in which they leave many empty tables in the back and have people wait often HOURS for a table. I asked why on earth after having waited 70 minutes for a table, that when I got into the back there were at least 15 seats open, the waitress said "the wait staff decide when they are ready to handle more customers and will signal for more to come back" really??? REALLY!?!?! This restaurant doesn't want maximum turn over? I mean our food came in literally 2 seconds and clearly it doesn't take hours to cook some ramen, so why the insane wait when there are empty tables? I think it's more than what the waitress said, that's all I can ascertain but in the end it's ridiculous. Even at 5:30 we waited over an hour.

As an answer to the question of: Ippudo v. Momofuku? Ê This is pretty much a wash, and it will usually come down to the common denominator on two factors: Ramen and Pork Buns. Ê When it comes to Ramen, there is no question that Ippudo rocks the house. ÊGreat flavoring, Great sides to accompany it. ÊThe accouterments really add a nice texture to the experience. ÊUnparalleled in my opinion. ÊMomofuku is a tad bit on the salty side, and is only saved by a hefty portion of their pork. ÊTheir broth is nothing to write home about, and if I did, my mother would ask me why I'm writing about such crappy Ramen. Ê BUT, it can never be mentioned enough how incredible the Pork Buns are at Momofuku, which places them leaps and bounds in front on this end. Ê(I realize that I've capitalized "Pork Buns" here, and when you make something this good, you give it the due respect.) ÊIt has a great layered taste, lingering after you've bitten trough the thick piece of pork belly seasoned to perfection. ÊIppudo's pork buns are puny in comparison and smothered with sauce. ÊIn my not-so-humble opinion, sauce smothering is the lazy man's seasoning. Ê(I remember an old Schoolhouse Rock bit on not drowning your food, and I believe that it has profoundly affected me to this day.) Ê Sadly, or in my opinion, not so sadly, I recommend you check both these places out, and love that you live in a city with such incredible dining. ÊIf you're still up in the air about which is better, well then, I guess you'll have to just flip back and forth and eat at both locations over and over and over and over and over and over . . .

Man this place has some expensive noodles. ÊWe waited for over an hour to eat here. With that long of a line, you would have thought they can afford to open another location. We sat down to eat and I noticed a bunch of empty tables. ÊThey need to get more Asian and just stuff random people into any empty seat. ÊIt's all good, make it communal. ÊThey should do it like a ski lift and let those who don't mind joining someone's birthday party eat if there's an empty seat. ÊWe had a table set aside for us because we were a group of 7, and 3 of them bailed. ÊWe ended up having a huuuuuuuuuge table, and we wouldn't have minded if others filled the table. ÊIf that reduces everyone's wait, it's cool in my book. I'm not a big fan of ramen or noodles, but I did enjoy my $14 bowl. Ê It needed more noodles or something in it. ÊI still walked away hungry. ÊThose pork buns are way pricey at 8 bucks for a pair. ÊI thought they were okay, but I guess the folks raving about them have never been to chinatown.

Good. Very good. I had the special tonkatsu with oyster sauce, fried Ginger & ankimo pate on garlic toast. Ok, super fussy for ramen, right? Right. Still, very tasty. Not crazy about the noodles in that bowl. D ate the miso ramen which was perfection, springy noodles, creamy broth, pork belly (pieces of pork belly were all fat no meat which gave the bowl flavor but my husband is the original Jack Sprat). We also shared the ponzu hotate...delicious barely warmed raw scallop with yuzu, ponzu & jalapeno slicez. So good. The atmosphere is definitely clubby...lots of yelling of irashaimase and arigato, like everyone over the top kind of thing. Almost the Japanese version of staff in a country western bar yelling when someone rides the mechanical bull. Fun, though. I am glad we went. I wanted to try Setagaya or Minca but they weren't open early enough for brunch. These were good bowls, efficient service even if the hostess acted like she was "over it". Girl, if you're "over it" at 22 you're going to be in bad shape attitude-wise by the time you're 30. Trust me. A little telling tidbit about the "special" ramen bowl: I didn't take my leftovers to go.

A Candid Note to Akamaru Modern Why do you taste soooo good? Your noodles are soo creamy and smooth, cooked to perfection. Yes, Summer is slowing fading away and it was hot outside, but I still wanted to eat you! I wish I knew the recipe for your noodles, they are exceptional! Let's move onto the broth: the perfect combination of tasty + salty (the good kind), made me use my ginormous sized spoon to gather you to my lips. When I ate the first bite of pork, it brought tears to my eyes. LITERALLY, it melted into my mouth. How do you do it? Until we meet again, Dreamsrey

Recommended by many. Came on a Friday night and told there was a 2 hour wait. Ended up only being a little over an hour. ÊIf you end up having to wait, go to the bar down the street called "Continental". They have a special on shots.....5 for $10. The ramen IS one of the best bowls of noodles I've ever had......but it's waaay over priced at $15 a bowl. We were told that the pork buns were really popular. They ended up tasting like bootleg peeking duck. The wasabi tako was very different from anything I've ever had...but again, overpriced.

Since this place was recently featured on yelp as being hottest place of the month, I wanted to go check it out. Ê The interior decor of the restaurant fits with the area as it's pretty trendy and modern. There's huge leather private booths for large parties and then there's tables that are big and long so that you sit and eat with others on the same table. The kitchen is open so you actually see the chefs making your order. Most of the people who eat here are Japanese so if you look anything like Japanese the servers will immediately speak Japanese when they seat you and tried to take your order. I ordered what was essentially the spicy ramen with pork bits and vegetable with an extra order of noodles (I forgot the Japanese name of my meal). The toppings on my ramen is pretty skimpy but the focus here of course is the ramen noodles and the broth. So how was the ramen noodles?? It was really good, probably one of the best I tasted. It wasn't overcooked and you can taste the egg flavor. The broth is what make or break the ramen and here it was served steaming hot and the flavor was pretty strong almost too strong (the strength of flavor of the broth is comparable to miso soup but of course a different flavor). People around me were enjoying their ramen as you constantly hear them slurping their noodles and drinking the broth with their huge spoon. Overall the ramen noodles were good, the broth was strong and flavorful (it's good if you like that), but I think the meal was a bit overpriced. My ramen was $15 with the extra noodle but add in tax and tip and it gets to be almost $20. ÊAnd to me I don't think anyone should pay more than $10 for a bowl of noodles

A group of us held a ramen contest today and surveyed a few ramen houses by taste-testing just a little in each restaurant. My husband chose Ippudo as the winner (he's a true foodie, excellent cook, but he's European) and I chose Menkui Tei (I'm Asian and grew up on ramen). ÊMore on that later. Ê What I did not like about Ippudo is that they take themselves way too seriously for a ramen joint. ÊSure, the broth was tasty but all of the grease left me feeling like I had eaten a pound of butter. ÊMy husband loved the pork, and I agree that it was tender and delicious. However, a broth should be simple without all of the extra grease and oil to make it "tasty". Ê Also, on a side note, the pretentiousness really got to me. ÊWhen we arrived, they were not busy at all and wouldn't seat us until our guests got there. ÊI'm 7 months pregnant and on a hot summer day, it would have been nice to have been seated. ÊAlso, I had a bottle of water that they insisted they take away from me since they don't allow bottled water in the restaurant. ÊAgain, cut me some slack... I'm hot, pregnant, and tired. ÊI would not bring in a bottled water to a five-star restaurant, but to a place that serves ramen noodles?? ÊA ramen house - no matter how well decorated - should never take themselves that seriously. Enter Menkui Tei in midtown. ÊThe soup is simple yet tasty. ÊThe noodles are fresh and cooked just perfectly. ÊAnd all you do is enter, eat, and enjoy. ÊJust like a ramen house should be. ÊPlus for the price, you get more bang for your buck.

So this review is not to wax rhapsodic over the noodles, the broth, the service, the buns, the peppers etc. There are, to date, 1277 reviews that do that. And yeah, Ippudo does warrant the praise 100%. What I want to do is to share a little tip to those of you who complain about the enormous waits. Do what I do. GO ALONE. I get my craving for Ippudo on the weekends for lunch (I just can't think of ramen as dinner food) so I grab a book and trek down there and ask for a seat for one. Most of the times I do this, I get seated within 10 minutes. This works because logically it is hard to fill every single seat at all of the shared tables so the chances are high that there will be one lone seat available. And Ippudo is one of those places where I actually prefer to go by myself. The first time I went with friends, but after becoming an addict, I just think "Screw that---I want my Akamaru ramen with Shishito and a crisp cold Yebisu---and I don't want to share and I want it NOW!" Who needs conversation when you have heaven in a bowl? So if you are jonesing it strong enough, forget your friends, hit Ippudo for lunch and enjoy the stares of anger as you most likely will breeze on by the lines!

At $14 a pop, I expected the most amazing ramen I've ever had... I ordered the Akamaru Modern and like previous reviews, I felt that the best component by far was the broth. ÊComplex, full of umami flavor and the garlic oil floating on top is like ramen crack. On the flip side, I was through the noodles in about 6 bites... I promise I'm not a fast eater. ÊAnd if you like your noodles thicker and egg-y, this is not the place for you. Ê2 pieces of pork belly, a small handful of scallions, and a few measly scraps of cabbage. Ê That's all he slurped. The sister ordered Shoyu Ramen and thought it was "good." ÊNot amazing, not "can't wait to come back." ÊSame type and quantity of ramen as above. ÊI tasted her broth and it was also delicious- more clear and you could really taste the seaweed and bonito flavors. Overall, not worth the price or 90 minute wait.

I stopped by Saturday night - they are in a soft opening phase but they are officially open on March 31.

The front of the restaurant is a small bar area. ÊThe bar is kindof a cabinet that holds a bunch of dry ramen squares under glass. ÊKindof cool. ÊThe wall behind the bar has a bunch of noodle bowls hanging up. Ê My only complaint with the bar area is there were no seats at the bar. ÊNot a big deal since the wait wasn't that bad. ÊThey had lots of different sake drinks and a few Japanese beers. When you get seated, all the waiters and cooks yell something out in Japanese. ÊI'm guessing they said "Hi" or "Welcome" but since I don't speak Japanese, they could be telling me "Get ready to pay too much for your ramen." The dining room is nice. ÊNicely lit, not too cramped even though there are communal tables, and has a cool vibe. ÊMaybe I don't get out enough but I liked the dining room. Ê I had the Akamaru ramen and the broth was really rich. ÊThe noodles were a little stiff. ÊI'm not sure if they needed to be cooked a little bit longer or if that is the way they come but I would have preferred that they be a little softer. ÊThere was a nice slice of pork but not much of anything else in the bowl other than ramen, a slice of pork, and a lot of broth. ÊI would recommend getting the extra noodles ($2). ÊAll in all, I thought it was a good bowl of noodles but maybe a little expensive since I can go to Chinatown and find a bowl of noodle soup for about $5. ÊBut I really can't complain about the cost. I'll probably come back after they have their grand opening.

Listen I don't pretend to be a ramen expert but I do enjoy a nice bowl of ramen. ÊMy favorite bowl of ramen is at Santouka, which is located in the food courts of most Mitsuwas. ÊI've tried a couple of others but the combination of broth, noodles and pork are exceptional at Santouka. ÊMy friend Joe said that Ippudo is the best ramen in the US. ÊHigh praise especially if you've ever met Joe. ÊSo during my NYC excursion the average temperature was in the high 20s and low 30s. ÊRamen was a perfect late afternoon snack before our show. ÊEven at 4pm Ippudo was pretty crowded. ÊWe ordered the chicken wings (they're no Bon Chon or Kychon) and the classic. Ê The tonkatsu Êramen broth was magical. ÊMy GF likened the broth so Korean kalbi-tang. ÊIt had the creaminess, depth of flavor and porkiness you'd find in a great broth simmered for hours. ÊQuite simply the best ramen broth I've ever had, better than either the Shiyo or Miso ramen broth at Santouka. ÊThe noodles were ok, they were very skinny and seemed like they were homemade. ÊI've never been a huge fan of ramen noodles so take it for what its worth. ÊThe berkshire pork was tender and tasted great but only 2 pieces? ÊIt's not quite as good as the special pork at Santouka. ÊOverall a great bowl of ramen but about 30% more expensive. ÊI guess thats the cost of living expense calcualted into the NYC ramen. ÊI wish I could do a bi-coastal ramen taste test between Ippudo and Santouka in the same day.

For some odd reason, I had a craving for ramen and so my friend suggested Ippudo. I can't remember the ramen dish's name but it was the most popular one with miso in it. ÊAs soon as I took the first bite, I loved it! ÊThe noodles, which are straight and not curly, was cooked to perfection and the soup was really tasty. ÊI'm not a pork eater but their pork meats were really good. ÊIt was nice and tender; a real treat. Ê We finished off our meal with the creme brulee topped with green tea ice cream. ÊIt was soooo good. ÊIt's not common for ramen places to have good desserts but it was good. Ê It was worth the trek and I didn't have to wait online because we were the first ones to arrive; we got there at 5PM when it opens.

The pork buns are worth dreaming about. I don't care if they're $4 each. Well, I care a little bit but seriously, they're THAT good. Please please please order them, you'll be doing yourself a big favor. They're better than Momofuku's, I know that for sure. The Momofuku ones are good, yes, but the hoisin or plum sauce or whatever they slap on is overpowering. The Ippudo buns have a nice neutral crunch from the lettuce and the mayo helps to balance the saltiness of the pork. Now the ramen? The ramen is awesome. I am a shoyu ramen girl, sadly. I wish I could have the full tonkatsu broth but I have a sensitive tummy and sometimes super rich foods can really do a number on me. I have had several spoonfuls though and can say it tastes indulgently porky and delicious. I'm not all that sad to have to order shoyu broth though. It's still really awesome. I've also had the fried shisito peppers. They're decent but not really my thing. I say skip 'em. The wait times are totally ridiculous. Only in New York would people be willing to wait an hour and a half to get a bowl of ramen. As much as I like the food, there aren't many places I'm willing to wait an hour plus for. I like Ippudo, but I don't hour-and-a-half wait or even one-hour wait like Ippudo.

This was the holy grail of ramen in NYC, so I was told by my cousin and best friend out there. Ê Needless to say, it did not disappoint. ÊShoyu ramen with spicy paste to give it a kick. ÊPhenomenal. Ê As a quick tip, Ippudo shuts down around 2:30ish to prepare for dinner. ÊThis is the perfect time to get in and get an order on, as we had no wait whatsoever near the end of the that lunch shift. Ê Verdict: ÊThis place was delicious... I would gladly revisit on any future trips to NYC!

I took a group of coworkers to Ippudo for lunch. They were skeptical at first, as they didn't think paying $16 for Cup-o-Noodles was worth it. ÊBut minds were soon changed. ÊAs soon as we walked in we heard lots of yelling, so we immediately took positions of cover as there may have been some sort of food altercation. ÊInstead, apparently, yelling is how the cooks alert the waiters that the food is good to go. FOOD: ÊIf you don't eat pork, forget the ramen. ÊAll the ramen dishes have pork. ÊBut this place serves other dishes too... for an appetizer, the fried jalapenos were different, but in a good way. ÊThey also serve buns of either chicken or pork. ÊThose were good. ÊAnd then the ramen... it earned a hearty approval from all parties at the table. Ê ATMOSPHERE: ÊNow I don't normally judge a restaurant in whole by its bathroom, but the one here was foul. ÊThere was toilet paper all over the floor like it was a high school prank gone bad, and it smelled. ÊOtherwise, in the dining room, there's lots of yelling. ÊIt was lunchtime so the place was packed, but it's roomy enough that you're not sitting butt-to-nut next to someone else. ÊNot exactly a romantic type of atmosphere but then again, who the hell goes to a ramen shop for a romantic dinner anyway? SERVICE: ÊSquared away. ÊThe "main" waiter was attentive on his own and he had a platoon of other waiters who constantly refilled our drinks and ensured we had whatever we needed. One last thing... there was something on the menu called bukkake. ÊWhat? ÊYea. ÊIf you're into that thing, I'm sure Ippudo is as good a place to get bukkake'd as any other. ÊI didn't try it though. ÊYea I may live in the Village, but I don't swing that way.

I was expecting a lot from their pork buns and was left feeling disappointed. Maybe it's because Momofuku's version is my idea of pork-laden sublime. Maybe I'm an extra picky pork bun enthusiast. Who knows; but what I do know is Ippudo's version drenched in spicy mayo and iceberg lettuce just didn't ring true for me. Pork buns aside, I loved the dcor of the bar area. The use of ramen on the bar itself is fabulous. I would love to try and build something similar as a coffee table with the ramen under glass. The noodle bowls as display pieces on the walls were a nice touch too and it was an easy place to just hang out at the bar. It was extremely busy on a Sunday evening which leads me to believe that the ramen is probably amazing, however, those pork buns are no comparison to what Momofuku is creating just a few avenues over.

Came here in Sept 09 (dinner) and Nov 09 (lunch)... both times I loved my ramen... Dinner- special wasabi ramen. I forget the official name but they added wasabi oil, and gave you extra if you wanted it. Had to wait an hour to get in, hung out around east village in the meantime. ÊThis wasn't on the menu the next time we came. Lunch- Akamaru Modern with pork belly....loved it although a bit oily as well...but the flavors were spot on for a chilly day in NY! :) ÊZero wait time. The staff here always impresses me as well....although not the greeatest at taking your pic for you... but I think he meant well, haha. I also love that it's right by the subway. Ê4 stars cuz I STILL can't justify paying $$ for ramen...see earlier and similar feeling towards Katana-Ya in SF :P ÊAnd, I wish they took reservations. Love the packs of raw ramen at the bar and the bowl assortment on the front room wall as decor.

If you're going to eat ramen, go to Ippudo. I'm pretty sure they have the best ramen in New York. The long wait sucks, but it is definitely worth the wait. Your taste buds and your stomach will thank you afterward. And when you are there, be sure to order the Hirata pork buns. They are amazing. The pork melts in your mouth and swirls together with the special Ippudo sauce. So good. And that is just the beginning of the deliciousness. I ordered the Akamaru Chasu, which comes with extra slices of pork. Oh. My. Goodness. I think fell in love the moment I took a sip of that rich, savory broth. It is hands down the best broth I've ever had. The noodles were of perfect texture, and the pork was succulent and delicious. Everything about that bowl of ramen was perfect. I'm not even kidding. It was amazing. I'm thinking about it right now *drool. Ippudo, where have you BEEN all my life?

Waited a good hour to get in, but it was delicious and probably the best ramen I've had on the east coast. Got 2 orders of the special ramen (with chicken) and their miso ramen (which was better than the special ramen) and an order of pork buns as an appetizer with raw ceviche octopus. ÊWe also got their pork buns as a dessert too because they were SOO GOOD (light, fluffy white bun with deliciouis, soft flavorful pork and great sauce). Delicious! ÊGave it 1 star less cuz of the wait.

Short back story - we decided to go after hearing about a friend of a friend (Japanese dude) fly in from Chi town for the weekend in order to eat here. ÊSo we asked, what kind of ramen is worth a plane ticket? The kind where you stick your nose in for the first inhale, roll your eyes back in pleasure, take a sip of the broth and toss any preconceived notions of what gourmet food is out the window. ÊMake no mistake, this is gourmet food. ÊEach ramen comes in a unique, rich, and complex broth that tastes like it's been simmering and slowly reaching perfection all day. ÊI had a special once, that came with a dime size dollop of green chili paste. ÊAwful by itself, but dip that into the broth, and the ramen is immediately elevated to a whole other level. ÊGenius. Their berkshire pork is also delicious - lightly smoked and full of flavor. ÊThe pork buns are pretty pricey - at $8 for two. ÊBut the balance of sweet, spicy, and mayonnaise exemplifies what fusion food is about...none of that grilled salmon with ginger glaze rubbish. Ê Yes the wait is long, but it's worth tasting something you can't find anywhere else in the city (let me know if you do tho!). ÊIf you haven't been back for a while, this place has redone some of its on-the-menu ramens - version 2.0's. ÊEven better!

Yeah, three stars for Ippudo. That's right. I'm not afraid of all you ridiculous Ippudo fanatics. ÊBring the pain you nut jobs. Let's get it out of the way; is Ippudo delicious? Of course. ÊI've only ever had delicate well cooked ramen with tasty broth and pretty good pork at Ippudo. But, shit, I don't like waiting forever and then paying too much to get tasty ramen. ÊI have a suspicion: too many people come to Ippudo after hearing how great it is supposed to be and then they have to wait a long time and pay a high price and suddenly "well, I don't want to look like an idiot. ÊI went through all this trouble and everyone else likes it so much... this must be far superior to any other ramen I've ever had". Ê When I get ramen I want it to be delicious, cheap, easy, and served somewhere cozy. ÊIppudo is good ramen, but every time I go back I think "people love this place! ÊIf I go again then certainly this time it will be so much better than Naruto that I won't care about the wait or the price" Nope. ÊF that. ÊStill 3 stars.

Just got back from NYC... and one of the places recommended as a "must try" was Ippudo. Walked to this place the first night in NYC lugging around 2 bags (Chinatown to here is a little over a mile). ÊGet there and the wait is 1.5 hours! ÊNah... I am tired...want to check in and check this place out later. Ê Later came... and decided that I could stand the wait. ÊSo we headed over. Ê ÊIt was about an hour... but definitely worth the wait. ÊLets start off with the staff. ÊThe staff was nice and extremely helpful and I liked that they all knew some Japanese phrases (I studied it for 1 sem). Ê They make their noodles here... so I had to order the Ramen. ÊI ordered a special they had... spicy base... but not spicy enough for me. ÊAs I took my chop sticks and grasped the Ramen... I could feel the firmness. ÊAs I placed the noodles into my mouth... ahhh....yeah... thats good stuff! ÊThe soup base, although not spicy enough for my taste... was really good and the pork was soft and full of flavor. Ê So why only 3 stars? ÊWell...I live in LA... and there is 3 places that I can think of here that are just as good as Ippudo, but when in NYC... this will be on the top of my list! Ê:)

Yes it is expensive for ramen.. but oh so worth it. Previously we had gone to Menkui Tei and thought their ramen was amazing.. but after going to Ippudo.. we prefer this one. The atmosphere is amazing. Feels like you're in a very fancy restaurant. The waiters/waitresses are extremely friend and nice. The place is almost like asian fusion. There is a lot of seating room.. but the seats fill up extremely quick. The tables have many chairs.. so you might be sitting next/across people who you do not know.. but most people are friendly. We sat across from a young Korean married couple.. they were tourists and were friendly. Expect to pay about $13-$15 a person for soup.. a bit pricier than other ramen places.. but the broths are so rich and flavorful. Definitely will go here again.

What better way to satisfy our hunger than some ramen. ÊMany of our friends raved about this place all the time so we thought we would give it a try AND we are so grateful that we did!!! We went in and was greeted with a 45 minute wait. Though it was a long wait for lunch we decided to stick it out and have a few drinks at the waiting room. Our name came up much quicker than expected. We were seated at the bar and was able to see these chiefs in action! We were so impressed with the cleanliness, speed and craftsmanship. We started with their famous Êappetizer (Hirata Bun - pork). ÊThe smell of them makes my toes curl and the taste is just amazzzzzzzzzzzing! ÊFatty pork buns rock my world! ÊHaving that as a start, we knew the our main course would be just as mind blowing as the buns. ÊI had their special spicy ramen (Akamaru). I thought all the flavors blended well and it wasn't too spicy or over powering. ÊMy bf had their Shiramaru Hakata Classic and it was just as good. I thought his was on the more saltier side but still has good. ÊI did like the touch of the pouched egg in his. I would totally go to this place again. ÊIt was one of the highlights of our wknd.

There isn't a whole lot to say in addition to over 1000 reviews here. ÊI really wish DC has an amazing ramen place. ÊBoth the classic and modern were amazing.

I'm used to small ramen restaurants - usually crowded, fast paced, and the decor being nothing out of the ordinary. Ippudo knocks everyone else out with their spacious and hip interior. I opted for the pork belly ramen upon recommendation and tried the chicken buns along with it. I had the ramen with some added spice and the heat always makes the soup more enjoyable. The chicken buns are amazing! I missed out on trying the pork buns but will keep that in mind next time i visit. The ramen itself is comparable to my favorite place - Shinsengumi in California. The soup base is noticeably different as Ippudo has a much more dense soup. They're both very flavorful and it's hard for me to decide which I like more. 5 stars!!

Reviewed: 12/30/2009 So apparently my sis and I caught Ippudo's last opening day of the year (they will be closed starting tomorrow and until Jan. 3rd, 2010). After my first dining experience at Ippudo, I don't think I can ever eat my own ramen again.....of course, I am not really comparing apples to apples, haha. The restaurant is creatively decorated -- with dried ramen underlain as tabletop decorations, fancy ramen bowls pinned on the wall, and an open kitchen that allows the cooking aroma to conveniently grab hold of hungry stomachs..this place feels more like a hip night bar than your usual Japanese restaurant. I tried the Akamaru Modern and their "Special Ramen of the Day". Personally, I felt that both bowls tasted pretty similar, but I would prefer the Akamaru Modern due to the tenderness of the pork. Besides the meat, the egg yolk was the next best thing in the bowl: it wasn't too dry and the yolk really soaked up the strong flavor of the broth. The broth on the other hand, was great too, but a little too salty and oily. The greasy after taste was a little too much for me. However, the ramen itself (and probably the most important thing in the bowl) was nice and chewy, and had the perfect thickness. The price is a bit expensive, though - $14 for a bowl of ramen. The Hirata Buns looked great too, but we were too full to try more. Ramen Rating: 3/5

I'm a fairy impatient person. ÊI don't like waiting and am a huge (HUGE!) fan of reservations. ÊOne of the few foods that I will wait up to 90 minutes for is the Akamaru Modern ramen at Ippudo. ÊYes, it is that good. ÊWhat makes it worth the wait? ÊWhere do I even begin... Ippudo, a ramen chain imported from Japan a few years ago, offers a variety of ramen, appetizers, drinks and desserts. ÊBut I am loyal to one bowl of noodles alone - the Akamaru Modern. ÊFeaturing pork belly, cabbage, a medium-cooked soy egg, scallions, chewy, springy noodles, garlic oil and "special sauce" - the broth is a study in umami. ÊI am jealous of others slurping out of the bright red bowl, even though I know my own will be placed before me in a few minutes time. ÊI plan my Ippudo trips days in advance and look forward to my Modern. ÊI pick less-busy days from work so I can go to Ippudo early. ÊSounds crazy - all this for a bowl of noodles? ÊYou'll understand once you've tried the Modern. Enough about the Modern though - you'll just have to try it for yourself! ÊIppudo also offers a variety of appetizers. ÊI'm a fan of the hirata buns - steamed pork buns with sweet/spicy sauce. ÊThis time, my eating buddy and I tried something new - the tori karaage. ÊA crispy fried chicken dish accompanied by chili and mayo dipping sauces, we couldn't go wrong. ÊFried? Mayo? Sign me up. ÊAnd for those who want to try a different ramen selection (who are you??), the classic offers a milder alternative. ÊLess garlicky and decidedly milder, I'd suggest the classic if you want to go easy on your taste buds. ÊBut really, get the Modern. The wait is long. ÊI'm pretty sure the hostesses hate me (I'm a "How much longer is the wait?" customer. I'm impatient, remember?). But I will keep returning as long as the best bowl of ramen in NYC awaits me. Worth the (really long) wait!

Review 1642. Boy, I feel special. Question: Is a two hour wait really worth all that jazz. Probably Not. Noodle soup is all about the broth and the noodles. If based on those two variables alone, this joint is LETHAL. My pork broth was sooo divine. I licked every last drop out of that bowl like no otha. However, the wait was simply way too long and I would have liked to have more treats in my ramen without having to sell the family cow. Not being cheap here, who me?!! Nah-uh. I'm just so use to ramen or any other noodle soup that comes with heaps of fun stuff- meat, fresh veggies, artificial crab, egg, fish balls and so forth. Otherwise, this place is pretty sweet, especially with the random tourette outbursts from staff. I just love to yell random gibberish- Êlove it!

The ever evolving noodle culture is strong and alive. Coined as the soul food of Japan, ramen is the quintessential noodle bowl that satisfies. Ramen is a simple concept but break it down you will find the depth in the noodle making, soup base, roasted meat and boil soy eggs. To me, eating is a process that is as much of deconstructing the ingredients as they are put together. What can you say about New York city? It's truly international bringing Ippudo to the city. Shigemi Kawahara is apparently the ramen king of Japan. When I arrived at the restaurant I could tell from the crowd that it's going to be good. While waiting we hung out at the bar, decorated with ramen noodles and bowls. It's so exciting to order Sapporo on tap it was crisp and refreshing after a long day of walking in the city. The appetizers looked so irresistible we ordered a few to try namely the edamame served with Yuzu salt, the mild lemon salt was amazing! It created a sort of umami flavor much like the MSG but it's all natural. I could not stop dipping in that bowl of potent tastiness. The shishito peppers were also very good, they were flash fried making it softer also it brought out the flavor of the pepper really well. More yuzu salt dipping moments. The hirata buns, steam buns and braised pork bellies with their special bun sauce. It's probably been over 15 years since I ate a pork belly steam bun which were served on special occasions or festivals. It was the most satisfying finger food especially serving the memories of my childhood. Our wait was not too ridiculous we were seated at a round table along with other strangers who were dining there. It brought home the point of a big city where strangers came together for quick meal very surreal indeed. I ordered the Akamaru Modern: Akamaru Modern The original "Tonkotsu" noodle soup topped with Ippudo's secret "Umami Dama" miso paste, pork chashu, cabbage, kikurage, scallions, and fragrant garlic oil. From http://www.ippudony.com/É With the addition of ni-tamago (seansoned salt boiled eggs) and Bakudan Ê(Ippudo original spicy paste). Anxiously I waited, the bowl came out with smelling amazing. The noodles I noticed were of other variation than I preferred (thick). It was the thinner soba but looked handmade at the restaurant. The milky pork broth was rich and full of umami. The roasted pork were thinly sliced to soak up the broth. The nitamago was just perfect with the yolk still runny in the core. I added the nicely scooped hot paste in the soup turning it bright red. It was so spicy but I was loving it. My verdict: The most delicious well-flavored soup base I ever had, it was so tasty I didn't waste a drop of it. At the end, close to licking the bowl I realized I just had the most euphoric experience, over the broth.

Over Hyped. I feel like ramen noodles is a specific type of noodle, and when my friend ordered a ramen it came out to be like spaghetti noodles. Definitely not something we expected. I think it's also ridiculous that the ramen was $15 a bowl. This place is not worth the wait. We waited 30mins for a table of 4 people and it's suppose to be not that bad of a wait. I also didn't appreciate being rushed out of the restaurant especially because I waited for so long. We weren't even done with our meal and they kept on taking it away after telling them that we weren't done. I feel like if I'm paying $12 for a rib I should be able to use all the sauce and savor the flavor. This was just something that I thought was annoying.

Came back for lunch more than a year ago from when I wrote my last review. We ordered the pork buns again and after just having the Momofuku buns about a week earlier, I found the Momofuku buns better with more meat and less dough where as the Ippudo buns we got was filled with one piece of meat in an over-sized bun. I ordered the Karaka miso ramen which I was afraid was going to be too spicy, but it wasn't that spicy. I found the portions smaller (more broth, large bowl and small amount of noodles) than I remember and the noodles looked more like soba noodles than the curly, ramen noodles I'm used to.

Came here while vacationing in NYC. ÊMy friends and I were greeted with a loud welcome as we were seated... seriously, the staff was literally yelling Japanese greetings. ÊThe menus included a lesson in ramen etiquette, which I found really informative. ÊMy friends and I each had a ramen set, which comes with a rice bowl and meat, followed by a bowl of ramen. Ê The tonkatsu ramen was delicious. ÊI really enjoyed my experience here, from the ambiance, to the staff, and of course the food.

Akamaru Modern & Pork Buns are the only way to go. ÊThis place had such high expectations to live up to and it did! ÊThe Akamaru Modern is warm and delicious, and the pork buns are succulent. ÊCan't wait to come back! Only complaints are that I would have liked more egg in the ramen, the cocktails were fine but nothing too exciting, and the seats we sat in were super uncomfortable.

I had the Akamaru Modern -- the pork was delicious and the broth rich and creamy...though I would have welcomed a little more spring to the noodles. Delicious. Pork buns were amazing as well, meat was tender and perfect amount of spice. I do prefer cucumber than a little piece of lettuce -- more texture and flavor -- but again, I am getting a little picky. Shishito peppers were very good -- and stirred some San Sebastian memories. Service was excellent and it is quite an operation to watch from the bar. Walked in with some high expectations and was not disappointed. Will return.

I was in HEAVEN when I tried the Ramen here. This was my last day in NYC and I was a bit disappointed with all the restaurants I have tried so far (up until I had my first taste of the Akamaru Modern Ramen here). I'm usually not a big Ramen fan; since I can't find too many restaurants that makes it right (either it's the noodles or the broth is too salty). This restaurant is better than Santa Ramen in San Mateo. I'm so glad my friend recommended this restaurant to me. It was definitely worth the trek to East Village! The lines here are LONG, so be prepared to wait at least 1 1/2 to 2 hrs. I got to the restaurant and it was jam packed. I told the hostess please try and squeeze me in since I came all the way from San Francisco. I told her I will sit anywhere, so she put me in a communal table. ÊIt's best to make a reservation or tell the hostess you are willing to sit anywhere. I have to say I got super lucky in scoring a seat in 10 mins. while other people had a wait time of 1 1/2 hrs. I met some really nice people who sat at the same table with me. One sweet girl (thanks for helping me snap some pics) from the Boston area and a family of 3 from the Bronx. It was all their 1st time as well. They all had friends who told them about this restaurant. I watched some of the dishes that were coming out; since I sat right behind the open kitchen area. It was nice to see all the delicious food coming out. The energy of the waiters and waitresses here is amazing! Even though, this is a busy restaurant, the waitress was very attentive and nice. She came by several times to check if everything was ok. I even had another waitress and waiter come by to see if everything was ok. I ordered the Akamaru Modern Ramen for $14- "The original tonkotsu" soup noodle with Ippudo's special sauce, pork belly chashu, cabbage, kikurage, scallions, miso paste and fragrant garlic oil. The broth is bursting with flavors. If that doesn't fill you up you can add two more dollars for the Kae-dama (extra serving of noodles). You can add any of these Ramen Toppings: Nitamago (seasoned soft boiled egg) - $2 Onsen Tamago (poached egg) - $2 Karashi Takana (leaf mustard) - $2 Menma (seasoned bamboo shoots) - $2 Kakuni (braised pork belly) - $4 Chashu Pork $3 Bakudan (Ippundo original spicy paste) - $2 I also ordered the Hirata Buns appetizer $8 (pork buns). They were soooooooooo good!!! You have to order this when you come here. Everyone seemed to order this dish at this place. It must be one of their signature dishes. The pork was flavorful and melts in your mouth. If I ever make it back to NYC...I'll be hitting this spot again! Thank you Theo for the great recommendation =)

1.5 hour wait for a Monday night. Haha. This city is getting so fucking lame. The ramen was OK -- I don't see the big deal. According to the Japanese kids I was with this is like a Denny's in Japan -- or slightly higher end because the Japanese are obsessed with Denny's. Anyway, I was more impressed with the things that were not ramen -- the house-made pickles (oshinko?) were really great. Good for a lunch, not worth waiting for dinner.

I've eaten here once and it was definitely solid. ÊI want to go back. I didn't pay but looking at the menu it seemed a little pricey. I kept asking for more hot sauce and they bring out this little dish that I think they were charging me $2/ pop for. ÊI had like 7 of them. Yes, the pork buns were really good but I'm hesitant to say better than Momofuku without a side by side challenge. ÊAt least as good I'll say for now. Very good ramen, some of the best I've had in NYC. ÊThe noodles had a nice firm texture and the broth was multidimensional and quite tasty. We just walked right in at 12:30 on a Wednesday and it wasn't full so not sure when this place gets crowded, maybe dinner?

Wow, this place had a long wait. ÊStill, there are plenty of places to walk to in this area, so the wait wasn't mind numbingly boring or anything. ÊOur table ordered the pork bun appetizer, modern ramen, and hakata ramen. ÊThe modern ramen was interesting, but I still would rather have the hakata. ÊThe modern ramen's broth was a bit more in-your-face and had a bit of a spicy kick. ÊThe hakata tasted like how all hakata should - pork bone stock simmering for hours. ÊThe pork bun appetizer had a soft, doughy bun with tender, slightly sweet pork strips. ÊThe addition of lettuce really gave it an american "slider" feel, which was nice. All in all, a great place to eat, but probably work to avoid the crowds.

Do you like a topping of hype in your ramen? Then Ippudo is the place for you. I've heard glowing praises sung of Ippudo since it opened. "Yeah, it's expensive and there's a wait," my friends would say, "but it's such a good bowl of ramen, it's the best I've ever had." There was no way Scott and I were going to do a weekly survey of New York's ramen shops without dining here, so after going elsewhere when faced with a 45 minute wait on a random Tuesday evening a couple weeks ago, I managed to snag a reservation this past week - in order to obtain a reservation you have to make one in person the day of - and we actually arrived early, so we pulled over to the bar at happy hour and had two for $6 Sapporo drafts. Ippudo is decked out very stylishly. The restaurant is heavy on black and white, with the notable exception of the red-upholstered chairs and benches. Some of the chairs, especially at the four-seater tables, are shaped like corner booth seats, which are nice to lean back into while you converse. Although I heard great things about the pork buns, after we paid $10 for two at Momofuku we decided to not pay that much again, and at $9 Ippudo was too close. Instead we opted for the fried chicken wings stuffed with pork and the shrimp pinchos. The chicken wings, which sounded awesome on the menu and even in my brief description, turned out to be bereft of any flavor - just bland, greasy meat where the textures of the chicken and pork were almost indistinguishable from each other. The shrimp, which were topped with a cod roe puree and served on potato chips, were alright but nothing special. Scott's fiancee had the Samurai Ribs, ribs served with a soy glaze and spice powder. These were good, albeit fatty (those two adjectives have so much more in common with regard to food than you might think), but the orange dipping sauce they served it with was too bitter - too much pith, not enough zest. By this point I was somewhere between two and three stars. However, Ippudo's a ramen shop, so let's see how that stacks up. Scott and I both ordered the shiromaru hakata classic, which was the most recommended one on Yelp and in keeping with my tonkotsu kick. For $15 and all the accolades I read, I was expecting a really delicious bowl of ramen. Instead I got one that was totally mediocre. The broth was fine, although it had a slightly different flavor from most tonkotsu - almost as if it were made with pork meat instead of pork bone (tonkotsu). The noodles were almost angel hair-thin and poorly cooked - they managed to be rubbery and not al dente. The pork was also disappointing. After I took two bites out of one piece I realized that it had in fact been two pieces, but they were so thin that I hadn't noticed when I picked them up. It also lacked any barbecue flavor, rather, it tasted as though it had been roasted without much care. The rest of the toppings were standard - scallion, mushroom, picked ginger, egg - move right along folks, nothing to see here. To top it off, this was also among the smaller bowls of ramen I've eaten. For a restaurant that serves okay food Ippudo's prices are outrageous. The ramen wasn't bad, but I would never pay more than $10 for it or rate it higher than three stars - $15 is almost double what it's worth and moves Ippudo squarely into a two-star rating. If you like buying into hype, being sceney or being seen Ippudo could be the place for you, but I don't think I'll be back. It's not worth it. The best ramen I had that night was in a chocolate ramen bar that was not purchased at Ippudo. Next time on weekly ramen, Scott and Mike get back on the wagon but then decide it makes a poor iPhone.

Went here for lunch today. Lunch special is Ramen, Roast Pork with rice and pickles for $3 more than the Ramen Price. The Ramen is absolutely amazing. Haven't had that good since Tokyo. Two compliants: 1.) We arrived at 3pm for a late lunch and they promptly wanted us out at 4pm. I hate being rushed. 2.) As others have commented, 15 bucks for ramen is bit insane. I am all for paying for a good meal, but we have notions of what ramen is worth. 10 bucks maybe. Still the food was very good.

A lot of 'show', but just not enough 'go.' ÊGorgeous dcor that definitely deserves 5 stars The environment makes this place a great place for a date or a hangout. Ê Unfortunately, the stingy two small slivers of meat I got in my Hakata ramen is only deserving of just that... 2 stars. Ê The broth was filled with great flavor and probably comes second in line to the decor. Ê The noodles were nothing to complain about, but I have to note that it wasn't traditional ramen. ÊThey were skinnier with a more firm texture. ÊI'm not really picky with noodles (which is why I happily ordered a second helping of noodles), but just a heads up to you picky ones. I wouldn't mind coming back. ÊMaybe I should pack my own meat next time haha.

I had two distinct advantages and one disadvantage when I first tried Ippudo. The advantages were a native-born Japanese boyfriend and a friend who lived in Tokyo for six years. Both have been to the Ippudo in Tokyo. The disadvantage, was that I'd just been to a Yelp event, and was coming off being a little bit drunk, so I was feeling kind of icky. We had a short wait (25 minutes, which early on a Saturday is pretty damn good; I drank some green tea and sobered up). I looked at the menu, thought the Akamaru was most to my taste, and my bf ordered that for me, along with some tororo rice. There is something about Japanese cooked dishes that makes them feel so nourishing in my body. I swear I can feel goodness radiating from my stomach to my fingers and toes. A few bites of both dishes and I was suddenly feeling human again. The noodles were fabulous--I knew already from another ramen shop that I prefer the hakata noodles over the thicker ones. My sweetie ordered them hard, so they were more chewy. About halfway through the delicious, mulit-layered, pork broth with miso, I added some hot sauce, which made the experience even more beautiful. The pork is by no means lean and my cardiologist will probably kill me, but sometimes you need some meat with fat and this is one of those times. It's a little loud, and I find it amusing that they're trying to give what is essentially a workingman's lunch and turn it into a classy experience, but no matter. I'm all about the noodles and will be back.

I've eaten here twice this week. The first time I met a friend at around 10:30 and thought, there can't possibly be a wait this late. There was. The second time I met a friend at 5:30 and thought, there can't possibly be a wait this early. There was. Was it worth it? Absofrigginloutely. People are hollering about their food- literally. Yelling as they walk by with huge bowls of steaming ramen. Normally I'd be like, "WTF?" but here it makes total sense. By the time I get my own bowl of noodles I understand what all the yelling is about. I kind of want to scream out, too. Layers of deep, luscious flavors- spicy, salty, fatty, UMAMI! God, yes. Slurping never felt so good. The perfect tools for the job are the chopsticks and XL miso spoon provided. Slurp slurp yummmm. Have I mentioned the pork buns? OUTRAGEOUS. Like fluffy, pig-filled pillows of love. Sweet, spicy, soft, and perfect. This is a must have. Ê Other than the wait for a table, it's a quick in-and-out meal; not much wait for your food or service. The kitchen is wide open which is a major plus for foodophiles like myself. If you haven't been, do your mouth a favor.

I'm still a little perplexed by how ubiquitous Japanese aficionados are in NYC. ÊThere's a ton of ramen places, robata-style places, and now the Japanese dessert places are mushrooming (review to follow, hopefully). ÊBut it's all good, whatever floats your boat, New Yorkers. ÊI love you all the more because of it. I ordered the Akamaru Modern as a set, with small salad and the spicy cod roe over rice bowl. Ê(Talk about carb crazy) ÊThere's a warning on the menu that says their "spicy" is really spicy, so be careful when you indulge. ÊHonestly though, none of the stuff I ordered was spicy at all. ÊEspecially compared to my dinner last night at the Halal cart. The spicy cod roe over rice was good, but nothing special. ÊNonetheless, I was so hungry that when I wolfed that thing I thought it was the greatest thing ever. ÊAs for the ramen: the noodle was thinner and straighter than I've ever seen before. ÊIt's reminiscent of.. angel hair pasta. ÊBut it has really good bite. ÊBroth was good, there's this floating ball of spice (?) but I detect a strong sesame taste, which I love. ÊThe chashu itself was delicate and sweet. ÊVery, very good. I would love to go back and try the spicy miso ramen, but with the multitude of choices in this city, I vowed that I wouldn't go to the same place twice during this visit. ÊSo.., maybe next time around. Oh by the way, they try to make the ambiance as Japanese as possible by shouting hello, thank you, good bye, come again in Japanese like they do in restaurants in Japan. ÊMaybe they could be shouting something like, "look at that girl, what a pig!" ÊBut alas, I don't understand Japanese.

I never had ramen noodles before, so when I moved to NYC less than two months ago, ÊI put on my to-do list to try ramen. I've heard and read great things about Ippudo so it was without question that it will be the place for me to have my first ramen. I went here on a Saturday night around 8 pm, and no need to say the restaurant was packed, I had to wait almost an hour for a seat. I am actually glad to say that the food was worth the wait. The broth was good as well as the ramen. The addition of egg to the soup was a nice touch and gave an unusual taste to the broth, I liked it. The ambiance was nice as well. I liked how they all shouted Êin Japanese when they are seating new customers or picking up food from the kitchen. The restaurant itself is elegant and the tables and chairs very trendy in my opinion. The service was fast and the staff friendly. I had a wonderful time here, and will definitely come back.

1st time here. Went with boyfriend. Heard about the wait. The wait time simultaneously turn us on and off. When we got our estimate wait time---1 hour and 25 mintues---we thought, we must try this place because such a wait time, we thought must mean a very delicious dinner as a reward. It was a dismal rainy, albeit Friday night, afterall---try trying this place on clear and nice day, we could not phantom. Cut to 40 minutes later, boyfriend threatened to leave. I asked him in my most neutral tone, "Really?" He said, "Okay, let's wait a bit" Cut to 1 hr and 30 minutes later, boyfriend started blaming me, "You never told me about this place, now we waited so loooong, they (the hostess and Ippudo staff) might have forgotten about us, and the food might suck afterall" Cut to 10:32 pm, we were in the car, post Ippudo dinner, boyfriend said, "What wait time?" and this is because the dinner consisting of Ê2 Akamaru Modern ramen, Phllycheese steak spring rolls, and Shochu w/ freshly squeezed grapefruit juice (they squeeze it right in front of you), and matcha creme brulee was so good, it made you forget you had the nearly 2 hr wait time. Well, almost. But the wait was worth it. One thing about the ramen---as previous reviewers mention, the soup becomes very salty and too heavy near the end. The first, and for me, midway part of the soup (for others, it gets salty and heavy midway), was incredibly good. The first sip, was so flavorful without any greasiness at all. At $14/bowl, I wanted have every last drop of the soup BUT I think it would've been perfect if I just stopped have the soup mid towards the end. Next time (there will definitely be a next time!), I will do that and it would have been PERFECT. The pork, the egg, the noodles was all so wonderful--how will I have ramen elsewhere ever again??

Julie I've stopped by this place a couple of times and couldn't fathom waiting over 60 minutes like the rest of the minions hanging around... Ê so a plan was crafted... find an opportunity to visit during off hours... my happened to be on a sunday afternoon at 4pm.. Walked in to a thunderous greeting by 2 petite asian hostesses screaming something at me in Japanese which I presume to mean "Welcome" ÊAs I walked into to restaurant, more loud Japanese screaming ensued from the wait and kitchen staff... ÊI couldn't help myself and did a beauty queen wave to the diners inside :) Ê The setting is quite cozy where everyone sits in a communal table unless you get a booth for a party of 6 to 8. ÊThe seats are unique. ÊIt's like a love chair for 2 that splits open and even though you are sitting in a communal table, you feel kinda on your own. Ê Started the meal with some Kirin on draft and the pork buns. ÊMade in the typical white bao that you would get in Momo or Baohaus... this one was topped with a spicy mayo teriyaki like sauce with a crisp lettuce as well... Ê And it was wait for it..... Ê "Legendary...." ÊAs good as the Baohaus buns... For ramen I went with Amareku with pork belly. ÊIt's a miso based soup and was fabulous. ÊNot too salty like Momofoku. Ê Infgredients were bits of pork, seaweed but the real star is the soup base.... Ê I also tried the ramen special which was called tonkutsu I think not to be confused with the japanese fried pork dish called Tonkatsu. ÊThe special had a nice spicy soup base and equally masterful. Ê Everything is well thought out from the wet naps after having the pork buns to a triple sized spoon that grabs heapful of delicious ramen broth. ÊAnd although the food and atmosphere felt very authentic, the wait staff all spoke perfect english and my guess is that they're all NYU or Baruch students that had to pass a yelling in Japanese test in order to obtain a job at this joint.... ÊI can only wonder if my upcoming experiences in TOkyo will be similar to this... I now understand the long waits at this place. ÊWould I wait 60 to 90 minutes in the future... hell no... but i will save my cravings for this place during off hours such as very early afternoons or right before they close.... ÊThis is now my top Ramen house in NYC....

Had the Akamaru Modern ($15) with boiled egg (+$3). It was excellent, especially the creamy soup base. Also had the pork buns which were really good, despite being fairly simple (mayo, pork belly, mantou, lettuce, some sort of bbq sauce). Some caveats: seating took about 40 minutes, despite going on a Sunday after 9pm & it was too pricey for ramen ($75 for 3 people). For these two reasons, I would not frequent Ippudo, but would occasionally come back.

It was a long wait but I went there on Friday night so what can you do... But while waiting, me and friend had a drink at the bar. I had sake martini type that use sake and mix with fresh grape fruit. They had few more but I only tried this and also Japanese Whiskey Yamazak on the rocks!! Little bar area is small but hip with red color wall and decoration on the wall is all sorts of noodle bowls were displayed. I had akamaru and was definitely yummy but the kind of noodle was thin type ramen noodle which is common from kyushyu area or that tonkotsu kind.

I thought I was smart by asking for a ride from my awesome big deal of a friend who works across the street from me, who drives in his car everyday to the parking space he gets for free because of his big deal status. I thought I was super savvy to dodge the long blocks home on a cold night and the claustrophobic feeling of the bus when it's crowded during rush hour by hitching a ride with my big deal of a friend. Little did I know that my big deal of a friend is a workaholic. It's 9:30 pm and I'm still sitting here at work. Cries! But anyhow, what better way to spend my time than to yelp about the places I ate on my third trip to the Big Apple? So presenting... IPPUDO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THE MODERN RAMEN WAS SO GOOD. The broth was super flavorful... and all the spices... oh dear... I'm wiping off drool just reminiscing about the bowl of ramen I had here. I came here with P and he wasn't too fond of his choice -- I think he got the classic shoyu ramen or something. We also got the steamed chicken buns -- anything with mayo sauce is so good. I hear the pork buns are better. I should had listened to the server and had gotten that instead, but I thought it was an overload of PORK since our ramen came with pork... Negatives: There are no small tables here -- note that you will be sharing a table with strangers or you'll be seated at the counters. Price is a bit on the expensive side and be prepare for a LONG wait -- seriously. Ê So I hear Ippudo is a chain... Ippudo, can you please come to SF???

Kinda upscale for ramen, but it just tastes sooo authentic. Had the Akamaru. Comparable to ramen I've had in Japan. Also, waitstaff speaks Japanese and greets you loudly with an "irasshaimase"...which is somewhat more comforting than a lot of other Japanese restaurants which only serves Japanese food. Long wait, but they're more than happy to serve you at the bar as you are waiting.

My cousin raved about this great ramen joint in NY. Being a ramen junkie, I just had to give this place a try. A short walk from the subway stop, we arrived at the front door. We were ushered in quickly upon arrival. The service was excellent. I took the advice of other yelpers and arrived around 2 pm so there was no wait. I ordered the original hakata ramen. I did not order anything else as the ramen itself was expensive enough. The ramen was delicious. While some yelpers think that the broth was greasy, I find it quite refreshing. The noodles were thinner than other ramen I've had before. The chewiness was just right. Overall, a great bowl of ramen, very balanced. The decor of the place is nice and hip. We can see the chefs working hard behind the counter. However, I am here for the ramen...I do not really care if they have cool charred wood decoration in the middle of the table, or nice utensils. As long as food is good, I am happy.

I would actually give it a 3.5, but rounded up like my elementary school teachers taught me. Perhaps it got built up too much before my first and second times at Ippudo. The 60 minute wait and having no space to breathe while we waited did not help...as a caveat, I will never opt to wait more than 45 minutes for any dining experience. I get grumpy. So, my Ippudo experiences are always coordinated by a very dear friend. I will concede that the ramen is boiled and cooked "al dente" but the soup itself was a bit on the salty, sodium-laden side for my taste buds. Flavor of the noodles is excellent - very thick with pork flavor, savory chives, and the magic Ippudo touch I suppose. The pork bun appetizer is a classic (beware of visible layers of the fat you will be consuming) and so guiltily* delicious. *No, guiltily is not a word.

Why oh why does Ippudo have to be so far away from me. The agony!! I so wish they would open one or have something similar to this in So Cal. On my last visit to NYC, my traveling buddy Mymy L. suggested for us to try this place. I am so glad she did because it was an awesome restaurant! Everything from the ambiance, decor of the resturant, to the service and food Êwas impeccable. The only thing was that we had to wait pretty long to get a table, especially considering we came right when they were open for dinner. But for food this good, it was well worth the wait. We started off with a few appetizers: chicken wings, tofu agedashi and pork buns. The chicken wings and tofu were quite good but the best appetizer of the night were the pork buns. They were absolutely delicious!!! We had eaten the pork buns at Momofuku for dinner the prior night but these were definitely better then Momofuku. They by far were the best tasting pork buns I have ever tasted. The pork buns were so soft, tender, succulent and flavoful. YUM! YUM! YUM! I would totally come back just for the pork buns alone. For our main course, we all ordered a variety of Ramen. I ordered Akamaru Modern Ramen and it was exceptionally good. Very flavorful and tasty. My bf ordered the Shoyu Ramen and I gave it a taste. It was quite good too but I personally liked the Akamaru Ramen a bit more. Our group of 6 paid around a 100 bucks per couple and thats because we ordered a large bottle of sake and multiple orders of pork buns otherwise, ÊI think the average price per person would be around $20-25 bucks. Decently priced for some great food. I can't wait till my next visit to NYC just so I can come here and eat again.

Ippudo's ramen is heaven in a bowl. ÊI've had just about all their varieties of ramen and love them all. ÊIn my honest opinion, Ippudo is the best ramen joint in all of NYC. ÊRamen here is delicate and perfectly cooked. ÊEvery broth owns a homey uniqueness that comforts the soul (especially on a cold NYC day/nite). ÊYour soul will be more so comforted with extra side of pork belly or poached egg. ÊAs far as sides go, I've had chicken wings, pork and chicken buns, and fried shishito peppers. ÊThey are all tasty, but are only sidekicks to the superhero that is their ramen. Ê The service and atmosphere have always been pleasing. ÊServers are knowledgeable, courteous and by no means over or under serve you. Ê For those of you that would like to visit Ippudo but wish avoid the ridiculous waits, I recommend going for lunch on a Sunday or on any mid-week day just as they open. ÊInstead of waiting 1-2 hours like you would during normal eating time, your wait time will max out at 30 mins. Ê Ippudo has definitely set the bar high for all other ramen joints in NYC. Êohm nom nom nom nom!

I'll admit, being asian, it's going to take more to impress me with ramen than most. But the broth is the most delicious ramen broth I've ever had. Same goes for the pork belly. The ramen is mediocre at best. It's thin and the texture is pretty mushy. I guess I'm looking for more texture in my noodle but clearly when you're here, it's about the broth. Go for the Classic #1 and add pork bellies as a topping. I've never thought, wow, I like the pork fat more than the pork. But it melts in your mouth and it's delicious. Besides the mediocre ramen noodles, small portion sizes and an over $50 bill for two bowls of ramen with 2 drinks takes away from what would surely be a 5 star meal. But again, the taste of the broth with the pork belly is amazing. Surely a splurge for ramen, but definitely worth it once in a while.

The long wait for this place is worth it. Ordered the Akamaru Modern Ramen and tasted almost like the delicious ramen I had in Japan. Plus, they give you more noodles for nominal fee. The pork buns were amazing too. To this day, I still think it tastes like a Whopper from Burger King and no one can tell me different.

Wow. ÊI really liked this place. ÊThe spicy ramen special with fatty pork belly was really tasty, although I also liked the broth from my friend's ramen, which was a more traditional Shoyu version. ÊHonestly, the broth wasn't spicy at all though, so I was a little disappointed. The highlight was a *really* delicious deep fried pork belly appetizer. ÊPlus, we got the shishito peppers, and a nice glass of sake. ÊThe ambiance was hipster cool. Ê My only complaint is the price. ÊYes, it's great quality food, but I know these dishes are not that expensive to make. ÊYou'll still get plenty of margin on the booze. ÊC'mon, it's ramen!

Ippudo makes the best ramen I've ever had. I've tried everything on the menu but the Akamaru Modern is my favorite. ÊI sometimes get extra chasu on the side. ÊThe pork buns are definitely worth trying too. They don't take reservations so the wait (there will always be a wait during prime hours) is long but you can get drinks at the bar which makes it better. Trust me, once the food gets to your table, you'll totally forget how frustrated you were the hour before.

I am a huge ramen fan and I visited this place because of so many good reviews and recommendations I had heard about. If I had to describe my experience in one word, I would say AVOID! ÊThis place gives ramen joints a bad name...If you can stand waiting 1-2 hours for ramen during dinner time, then by all means GO HERE! ÊIf you like uninspired, fairly bland broth flavored ramen, GO HERE! ÊIf you like crappy service and wonder why they do not clean up tables quickly so that the next customer can come in and reduce the amount of time for turnover of a table, then GO HERE! We ordered the berkshire pork and crispy chicken as our appetizers and sampled a few of the Pork Ramen Classic and the Miso Ramen to get a flavor of the different standard offerings. ÊFor the amount you are paying, the portion sizes were incredibly small. ÊThe food was decent, but you can find better pork at Momofuku and the ramen itself is no better than stuff you find at Rai Rai Ken or Setagaya. There is one thing that this place is sorely lacking and that is a good house manager, who knows how to service people quickly and create the proper table turnover to maximize revenue. ÊFurthermore, the layout of the restaurant does not make sense at all, there is so much wasted space, along with those huge square booths, that they should have taken a page out of Design 101 to understand how to maximize the space. The one pleasant note was that I heard the Ippudo in Japan are much better and serve higher quality food. ÊToo bad we did not get the same in NY.

What's in the Akamaru Modern broth? CRACK?!? Geezus, I could NOT get enough of that thing. Came in 2 Sundays ago for the "best ramen in NY" and I left very, very satisfied. ÊWe arrived around 1:00pm, starved. ÊThey said, "oh, the wait will be about 15 minutes." 15 minutes passed... 20 minutes... 30 minutes... WTH I'm hungry. ÊWhat's with the wait?! Finally, they called our name and I was skipping happily (in my mind) after our hostess. ÊShe yelled out some kind of greeting and all of a sudden, we were greeted loudly by all the kitchen staff. ÊAll eyes were on us for a split second. ÊEmbarrassed with my head down, I walked alittle faster after our hostess. We were seated in a small table off to the left of the room, in which I was overjoyed, because I was yearning for some sort of privacy. ÊSomething about dining in the main hall makes me feel uncomfortable. ÊI don't know, I'm weird OK? ÊAnyways, when our waiter came to our table, he did the most peculiar thing. ÊHe knelt down so that he was at eye level, or maybe even lower, to take our order. ÊIs that a Japanese thing? ÊBecause I found that rather cute. We ordered the Hirata Pork buns to share and for each, Akamaru Modern Ramen. Ê The pork buns were made so delicately. The bun was white and fluffy with a subtle hint of sweetness only a plain bun can offer. ÊThe pork was juicy and fragrant and it complimented the bun so well. The Akamaru Modern...WOW. ÊThat broth, that special sauce, the meat, the silky noodles. ÊIt was more than I could bear. ÊI drank all the broth - even made the slurpy noises - and I wanted more. ÊSince I didn't want to look like a fatty, I decided against asking for extra broth. ÊI mean, I've heard of asking for extra noodles but broth? I left disgustingly full yet content.

But, the pork buns are definitely a must have when coming here. Remember to come here early or you'll have to wait for a really long time... we came at 6pm and waited 45 minutes to be seated.

My Akamaru Modern ramen was the saltiest thing I've consumed to date, which coming from me speaks volumes considering how reckless I am in the salt department (just check my raging blood pressure). But in friendlier honesty, the pork buns were melt-in-your-mouth delicious, and for that alone I give this restaurant its 4th star.

Definitely one of the trendiest "ramen" places I've ever been to (includes Tokyo, Kyoto, Torrance-Little Tokyo-Sawtelle areas in Los Angeles, Dallas). ÊBar at the front of the restaurant, two young female hostesses by the door, dozens of interesting ramen bowls hung on the walls as decoration, communal tables and nice booths, and a semi-long wait at around 11 PM on Tuesday night. I'm at the communal table by myself since I'm a loser on a business trip in NY with no friends. ÊRamen portions are relatively small (size similar to a small bowl by Torrance/Little Tokyo stds). ÊThe duck in the ramen is very tasty, but there's only 2 pieces, and the broth isn't as rich as I like it to be. ÊOverall, satisfying ramen.

Freakin' awesome! Loved every bit of Ippudo!. I've been craving Japanese Ramen since like... forever! I'm from Boston so not many options for Ramen. Just one place that I know of. All workers were very nice and attentive. I didn't find the need to be a douche to order drinks at the bar... not that I normally do.... When you are seating, all the waiters will turn and greet you really loudly. I'm not sure what they said, probably welcome or something. I thought it was really cool. Definitely adds a fun atmosphere to the place. Our waitress was very kind and hospitable. There were times where I turned around in my seat just checking the restaraunt out, or just stretching, and she was suddenly next to me thinking I was calling her. So here was my setup for the night: - Beer: Yebisu (Japanese malt) It's awesome! - Apps: edamame = edamame; chicken wings = yum yum - Entree: Special Ramen plus side of roast pork and side of hot paste - I devoured my own bowl, plus half my girlfriend's. She got the traditional one. My broth was tastier in comparison. Loved every slurp of it... - Desert: couldn't do it.... I suppose the only bad thing that came out of Ippudo was a really bad case of food coma.

Oh, Ippudo. If only you knew the pain you put me through. First off, you made me and my friends wait for more than an hour before giving us a table. Secondly, you made me endure nonstop yelling, which I was told was "authentic." Authentic yelling? How about I'm in a restaurant paying 3x the amount I'd normally pay for a bowl of ramen, so please shut yer trap. Lastly, after serving me the most delicious bowl of ramen I have ever consumed, you asked me if I wanted an extra serving of noodles to make use of all the extra broth left behind. Only $2! you said. Because I am a cheap sucker who likes to throw good money after more good money, I said yes. And promptly got a stomachache from all the ramen expanding in my intestines. Which caused me to call in sick the next day. Really. So why 4 stars after so much unpleasantness? It's because IPPUDO MAKES THE MOST DELICIOUS TASTING RAMEN I HAVE EVER TASTED. But would I go back to Ippudo? Probably not. Because you see: ramen isn't even supposed to taste this good. It's supposed to be delicious and fast nourishment, not a divine meal served after an eternal wait. So despite all your yelling, Ippudo, I'd say you're serving up a pretty INauthentic ramen dining experience. But that's not to say it isn't mind-bogglingly good.

The 4 stars is strictly for their appetziers, because I really think that they are the stars, and not the ramen itself. There was a short wait of about 35 minutes on a Sunday afternoon, definitely not that bad. We always get the Hirata buns but this time I also opted for the Philly Cheesesteak Spring Rolls. ÊUm, seriously, WHY HASN'T ANYONE ELSE THOUGHT OF THIS?! ÊIt's so friggin ingenious! ÊCheese + beef + fried spring roll wrapper = HEAVENLY! ÊNot too greasy, and not too meaty where you get sick of the taste. ÊSO GOOD. The ramen was just normal... to be honest, I think their broth is just okay, definitely not worth the obscene lines this place gets at times. ÊAlso, what's up with all the non-Japanese workers... it just adds to the not too authentic feel of the whole place you already get with its trendy vibe and decor. ÊIf it was not for the pork belly, I'd probably never want to come back here. ÊAnd yes, I understand that I've definitely strayed from my opinion a year ago. ÊWhat can I say, I guess my tastebuds have matured! As a side note, if you are already finished with your meal, pay your bill and get the f out. ÊI saw one couple that was sitting across from me, just sitting there with their half empty soup bowls, PLAYING WITH THEIR PHONES. ÊWhen the server came by to ask if they were still working, the guy quickly replied, "Yes" and picked up his spoon to drink some more soup. ÊUh, dude & dudette, did you not notice the obscene lines outdoors? ÊHave some courtesy. ÊMind you, this couple also took their time drinking their after dinner tea... the girl seriously finished every drop of her tea before they FINALLY got up and started to slowly put their jacket on. ÊJERKS.

I was quite the ramen virgin, but this was a must-try on our last trip to NYC. ÊI figured that, being an outpost of a Japanese chain, Ippudo would at least be authentic. The twenty minute wait, mid-afternoon, was a bit of a surprise. ÊBut at least we didn't try to get a table during the peak hours! I sampled the classic shiromaru with extra noodles ($15). ÊThe tonkotsu broth was rich and deep with flavor - as slurplicious as they say it is. ÊThe slices of pork served on top of the noodles were moist and tasty. Ê Since DC has exactly zero (0) ramen shops, I've only been able to compare Ippudo to Menchanko-Tei and Motomachi Shokudo (in Vancouver). ÊI think Ippudo is still tops, in my experience.

I'm a vegetarian and I can't say much about the rest of their menu. However, hands down the best vegetarian ramen I have had anywhere from San Francisco to Hawaii to New York this is by far the BEST. It was pricey at about $15 a bowl and a bit on the salty side but, the flavors in the broth (Mushrooms, I believe) makes it all worth it when on a cold New York evening you are craving for something soupy and warm. The inside of the restaurant was lovely. However, the wait was quite long. If you are a vegetarian this place is a must try. Any other ramen place will offer vegetarian's a water broth or something with no flavor. Come and try and I'm sure you'll fall in love!

Ippudo is amazing!!!!!!!! Not to brag or anything, but I discovered this place before it was lauded by everyone as one of the best food destinations in NYC. The pros: The ramen is unbelievably delicious. The broth is salty, porky, and creamy in this really unique way. It literally warms my soul. The pieces of pork belly melts in your mouth, but word to the wise, the ramen only has 2 pieces, so if you want more, get a side order (which by the way is plenty for 2 people). The modern soup is my favorite, and I always get it with the spicy paste on the side (ever since they took the spicy soup off the menu and make you pay $2 for spicy paste). The chicken wing appetizer is also delicious, as was a special of fried wasabi oysters I had last time I went. Also, they make a great lychee martini that is sufficiently strong, and not overly sweet. The cons: As everyone probably knows, the waits here are insane. I always try to get there around 6-6:30 and it is still an hour wait. That's probably why I don't go as often as I used to, but it really is worth the wait. Also, it is rather overpriced for ramen, but once again, it's just so delicious that I'll pay the price. Seriously, I won't even eat ramen anywhere else.

AMBIANCE: Very very crowded. For Saturday brunch, they made us wait over an hour for a table for four! We just left and wandered around the Farmers Market in Union Square, but when we came back after an hour like they told us to, they made us wait an additional 15 minutes. Inside is very lively, although the loud shouting gets a bit annoying after a while. Definitely room for groups. FOOD: Hirata pork buns are the shit. They come out all warm and delicious on a doughy wrapper. But then again, slap on some mayo on a lot of food and it'll taste better. I ordered the ramen special (something with monkfish liver), which was surprisingly delicious. The noodles are straight and thin, different from what you would think of as "ramen." The broth is pretty savory. I never drink ramen broth (I prefer my arteries unclogged kthx), but gave this a few good sips. You can add extra noodles for $2, but just the normal course was more than enough for me and my friends. SERVICE: After the really long wait to get in, we had a really long wait to get our food. In fact, our appetizers came out like 5 minutes after our ramen. They are pretty good at refilling your water. Numerous friends hyped up this place a lot (like "OMG THE BEST RAMEN EVARRRR"). And though the ramen is undeniably good, I feel it's a bit overpriced for a bowl of noodles. Will come back again (for the good broth), but won't make it a habit.

Don't believe the hype. ÊInstead you should eat and experience the hype. ÊThe ramen is that good. This is not your ordinary sapporo ichiban ramen (which I still love to this day). Ê The Shiromaru ramen (choice #1 on the menu and identified by the white bowl)is so tasty and rich with flavor that I couldn't get enough of the soup. ÊYes, it's not as full of pork and vegetables as Momofuku's ramen, but this is damn good broth with thin noodles and a couple of slices of tender pork. Ê My girlfriend had the Akamaru (choice #2 on the menu and identified by the red bowl), and it definitely had a lot bolder garlic flavor. Ê Looking around the room, it seemed like the young japanese folks ordered this bowl a lot. ÊThe older Japanese-speaking patrons seemed to favor the white bowl. ÊWith the red bowl, you don't get to taste the flavor of the pork as much as you do taste the special sauce and garlic. Ê I love garlic and while i thought this tasted good, I really enjoyed the white bowl much more. ÊI just like the white bowl's basic pork goodness. The place has a weird overall vibe due to its seating arrangement and decor. ÊIt's modern, but not. ÊIt's cozy... but not. Ê There are communal tables and there are also these gigantic enclosed booths that could seat 8 people comfortably but they seem to give them to any group that is more than 2 people. ÊAnd the booths are so disjointed from the rest of the restaurant. ÊIt's kinda like En Japanese Brasserie... but scaled down. Ê How do you avoid waiting 2 hours? Go at 4:45pm, wait 15 minutes and be the first ones in. Ê There was Êa decent line by the time the doors opened at 5pm. ÊLots of japanese families and couples. Ê ÊI know most people don't like to eat dinner at 5pm. ÊBut hey.. you can eat great Ramen at 5pm and a light dinner later on if you're still hungry (and awake). The broth tastes so good that it would be hard to believe there was no MSG. ÊAll I know is after eating the ramen I was really satisfied but damn sleepy and thirsty. Êif you're a big eater, i would opt for the extra noodles for the extra charge. 5 stars for great Ramen. Ê3 1/2 stars for the atmosphere. Ê Is $13 expensive for ramen? Êyes. Êbut it's damn good, hearty ramen.

First time trying ramen at a restaurant... so my review may be tainted. Ê Arrived around 6:30pm on a Sunday evening in anticipation of some well-earned hot soup noodles and given a 30 to 35 minute wait. ÊWe (3 of us) returned 20 minutes later, and were told to wait again an additional 20 minutes. Ê Decided to wait (based on recommendations from a cousin of mine)... probably the only reason I give it a 4 star... Next time, will come earlier and with less hungry stomach. Ê The service is amazing because they waiter and bartender seem to genuinely care if you have any needs whatsoever. Ê Decor: very posh looking, modern Japanese.. I love the bamboo tree. Seating is in the form of large tables but they will sit you with other groups (no small tables). Ê We got the deep fried mackerel $15 to share but for only 4 pieces... not sure if it was worth the money. ÊRamen was awesome... the option to get add more noodles (kae-dama) was unnecessary for me. ÊPortion was perfect for what I was longing for. Ê Very flavorful and Êsatisfying. ÊRamen starts off at about $12 to $13 per bowl, then $2 to $3 per extra... I would probably invest in extra pork belly and/or egg... YUM. Ê After having fresh ramen, I've decided I don't like pho (I know, completely different taste but ramen was much more filling and flavorful when you're comparing soup noodles in general). ÊI would still like to try a smaller ramen bar though.. I would DEFINITELY come back here though. Ê=)

Pork buns are def worth a go around...I drizzled the spicy sauce all over mine and created great bliss. The ramen was pretty good, I ordered another side of spicy paste, made it even better. Sake was ok, a little pricey. The ambiance was perfect for a mellow date, have no clue what the chef screamed at us and every other customer walking in the door but its all part of what they got going on.

I was heading to NYC on business and asked many friends where to eat while I was there. ÊI received numerous recommendations for Ippudo NY. Ê As warned by many, there was quite a wait. ÊWe came in on a Sunday night and waited 1 hour, 45 minutes for our table. Ê(And just FYI for visitors, you're seated faster if there are just two in your party.) Their reception/waiting area is quite small so be prepared to stand a while. ÊThey do take down your cell number to call you when your table is ready if you prefer to wait elsewhere. Once our party was called, we were taken to the back where we received an emphatic "Irasshaimase!" and promptly seated at an enormous communal table. Famished from the 2 hour wait, appetizers were a must. ÊWe ordered Tori Karaage (fried chicken) and Ebi Tempura. ÊBoth tasted great at the time, but I can never truly trust my judgment when all I want to do is get something solid in my stomach. The real test was, of course, the ramen and I have to say that even with all the hype surrounding this place, I was quite impressed . ÊI ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen topped with Monkfish liver and pork chashu. Yes, this an extremely overpriced bowl of ramen (about $15), but it's one of those things you can't help but smile about after finishing your bowl. ÊThe broth was flavorful and not overly salty. ÊThe meats and veggies were properly portioned, and tasted fresh. ÊAnd the noodles, ah yes, the noodles...that was the best part as it was cooked with a nice "bite" but not quite al dente. I'd definitely want to try this place again, but hopefully without the nearly 2 hour wait next time!

My friends and I came here on a rainy afternoon at around 12pm. To our surprise, we were seated instantly. We had heard of the crazy long wait but fortunately enough, we never experienced it. Ordered the miso ramen with a side dish that was somewhat forgettable. The real star of the show here is the ramen! The noodles were perfect and the ground ginger when mixed into the broth is delicious. It almost left this buttery taste. It was the perfect temperature and overall a great bowl of ramen. The ambiance is nice and very modern but I prefer the traditional feel of a ramen house meaning small, bar seating, and a bit crowded. It's all part of the ramen experience. But I will definitely be back for a bowl next time I'm in NYC!

Tons of hype, check. ÊLoud techno, check. ÊMaking you wait for no reason, check. ÊLots of cool haircuts, check. ÊOk, you get the idea... But yes, the food was yumyum. ÊPork everywhere, so you gotta love that. ÊWell actually, the vegetarian I was with didn't like it, but whatevs. ÊI don't have a ton of ramen experience so I can't vouch for authenticity, but it tasted pretty damn good to me. ÊI will agree though that it was just a tad expensive for what it is. Side note. ÊHalf way through my meal I noticed that it seemed like all the gorgeous people around me were eating the little fried pepper and mystery powder appetizer. ÊI felt like I needed it, but alas I had already ordered. ÊMaybe next time.

The Samurai Ribs were falling off the bone, perfectly sauced and seasoned, black pepper imported from Japan was a distinctive touch. ÊThe ramen itself---AMAZING. ÊEveryone other ramen place reminiscences what you can make at home with the microwave (cup o noodle days?) but this place takes ramen to a new level, or brings it back to how it should be. Meaty, fishy, hearty broth. ÊGood portions of tender pork. ÊI ate it down to the last few spoonfuls of broth and I pushed the plate away, finished. ÊMy friend, a veteran, looks into my bowl and scolds disappointedly, "You NEVER leave a bowl empty here" before bringing the bowl to his mouth to finish the deed. I promised I wouldn't do that again.

The noodles are unlike any other ramen I've tried. ÊBut really, that's about it. ÊI would really give this place a 3.5, but I'm rounding up. We went around 7 PM on a Wednesday night with a party of 3, and it was packed! ÊBut we only ended up waiting half an hour. ÊNot bad at all. ÊI definitely would not wait more than an hour for this place. ÊNot worth it. I had the Akamaru Modern ramen, which was tasty. ÊIt's definitely a heavier broth, so keep that in mind when you order. ÊIf you want something lighter, order the Tori ramen. But like I said, the only thing really special about this ramen, for me, was the noodles. Vince W. got the Shiromaru Hakata Classic, and he enjoyed his as well, but really, neither one of us were blown away. ÊNeither of our lives were changed by this dining experience. ÊIn fact, Vince W. enjoyed Momofuku more. Overall, I think we (Bay Area's) have a few ramen places that are comparable to Ippudo. ÊI still really enjoy Ramen Dojo in San Mateo. ÊEven Himawari and Tanpopo in the city are worth the comparison. We tried the pork buns, and they remind me of the pork belly buns from the Chairman Bao cart in SF. The ones at Ippudo are definitely more flavorful, but also more expensive. The Yebisu beer was good. ÊI enjoyed that. The I HEART Ramen shirts were cool, but not for $25, no thank you. ÊI definitely didn't like Ippudo THAT much.

I just don't understand why everyone is in love with this place. I've been back several times to TRY to like it. Even through the 2 hour waits and $15+/bowl price tags, I still TRY...and FAIL every time to see the charm. Ippudo just seems to me like a modern, fusion, overpriced ramen place with some pretty innovative, but underwhelming dishes. The noodles don't even taste fresh to me. The pork slices are razor thin, and what? I only get HALF an egg? The appetizers are decently good, but portions are so tiny, its got me licking the plates just to get my money's worth. I'd rather trade a seat on those fancy 2 sided chairs for a stool at Totto or Minca. At least I'll get a whole egg. Yay.

Waited 2 hours for a table. When presented with the menu at the table, found out that all the bowls contained pork products (I have a pork sensitivity). Had the vegetarian option. The $15 I paid must have gone to the ambiance because I cannot think of what else it could have paid for. Ramen: water, salt, noodles, and meat is optional.

I been wanting to try Ipuddo ever since I hear about them a few years ago but never got a chance because they were always closed when I visit a few times. Today was the day that I finally got a chance to taste their ramen noodle. I was so excited because of the great reviews on yelp plus the pictures on yelp/website look freaky delicious. We didn't have to wait long to get a table which felt great. We look over the menu but knew exactly what I was going get because of reviewing their website menu hehe Yes I am one sick puppy LOL I order the Akamaru Modern set menu which come with a small salad and a choice of a rice dish so I choose eel of course. For once, I didn't order any beers because I really wanted to taste my soup. The Akamaru Modern look and smell dishes. My first bite was good and the broth was very tasty especially with the garlic oil they added. The pork just melted in my mouth and that was proably the best pork that I ever try in a ramen dish. The noodle was decent but it wasn't firm enough for me. Personally I like mine more chewy and after you leave it in the broth for awhile. The Ipuddo noodle was soft. Overall it was a decent but nothing close being the best ramen that I taste. It might be on my top 5 list but no way it can be my top 3 ramen noodle place. It was way more HYPED then performance......I am still on a misson to found the best ramen so if anyone who know of a place, please email me!!!

This place blew my little mind, and my mind is not easily blown when it comes to ramen. We went at a super weird time on a weekday, so there was no wait whatsoever. Score. A couple days later I walked by and there was a two hour wait. Fools! I hadn't eaten all day because I was hungover in one of the worst, hottest NYC days of the summer so I was cranky and needed this to cure me. I ordered the Tori Ramen, which the waiter described as light and delicate, and indeed it was. The broth was a combination of pork and chicken, the noodles were silky and perfect, the chashu was thin and not fatty, the soy egg and bamboo shoots, nori and shiso all complemented the lightness of the broth and noodles excellently. My friends both for the Akamaru Modern ramen. I tried the broth, which was a pork broth seasone with scallions, garlic oil and red miso paste that you mix in, was to die for. Absolutely incredible. Our waiter was really knowledgeable and answered every single question we had, describing each type of ramen perfectly! I wanted to try all of the ramens. I'm actually kind of sad that I live in SF, a ramen desert, and won't be able to come back here in the near future. I'm still daydreaming about it!!!

Dinner with friends in NY earlier this month. I was just getting over a bout of stomach flu, so when friends suggested ramen, I thought that was a great solution. We started with the Pork Buns, Chicken Wings and Philly Cheesesteak Spring Roll. The pork buns were TASTY - different from your everyday BBQ pork buns. Chicken Wings were perfect for the three of us (3 per order) and nicely spiced in a black pepper sauce. The Philly roll was truly decadent, deep friend and over the top, but something to split between a small group. All of us tried very different ramen..... My friend's husband went with the dark, charred goodness of the Karaka Kogashi Miso Ramen. My friend went Akamaru Modern, a nice moderate broth, medium color. I kept it more low key due to prior illness, with a nice lighter broth, Shoyu Ramen. We were quoted a one hour and 15 minute wait on a Tuesday night at 8 pm. They told us we could skip out for a nearby drink, and to call periodically after 30 minutes. Once the iPhone timer rang, we called and were told we were the next 3 person party and to head over. We arrived as they were clearing our table and were lead around to the other side.... it was much bigger than you see from the front. Quite crowded, quite boisterous and great music - Michael Jackson, Talking Heads - a fun and festive atmosphere. Our server was fine, not at all snobby or impersonal like others have lamented. He gave us plenty of descriptions and notes about the menu and was around just enough to keep tabs on us without over intruding. Definitely a fun spot, would like to see the ramen trend head to Chicago.....

You won't want to go back to eating ramen out of packets after you come here for REAL ramen. The ramen and the pork buns are both really good. Broth tastes realy good and pork buns are nice and fatty. Come here at 5pm, otherwise, expect a really long wait. I had to wait for more than 3 hours one time because I came with 5 people, so we went to get a snack at saint alp's teahouse which is a few blocks away. This place is probably worth a 2 hour wait...but 3+ plus might not be worth it.

I was torn between giving Ippudo 1 star or 2 stars. I wish I could give it a 5 like everyone else, but that'd just be a dishonor to the true Ippudo in Japan. (hint hint*if you've had Ippudo in Japan, DO NOT COME HERE) I went with my parents and my sister, the 4 of us went in around 1:15 pm, put our names down, and the hostess said the wait will be around 20 minutes. So we went walked around the corner and came back at 1:30. The hostess said we'd be next. But we ended up eating at 2:30 pm. How did this happen Ippudo?? The hostess said there's 3 tables that are done eating, done paying, so they're just waiting for them to leave. Meanwhile, parties of 2-3 were being seated constantly. At one point we almost thought about just eating separately. When we finally went in, we were surprised to see so many parties of 2 occupying tables that could fit 6-8 people easily. So then we knew, the hostesses were idiots. They just don't know how to seat people properly. We ordered as soon as we sat down, because we've had an hour and a half to stare at the menu. 1. The ramens were expensive. Close to $20 if you get a side of rice with it too. In Japan, you can get that for $7. 2. They tasted awful. AWFUL. We got the shiromaru and the akamaru to test if they're up to standards, and they weren't. We started out thinking that's it's good, and realizing in the next second that we were just hungry as hell. The noodles were mealy and bland. The broth was too salty and dense. Tonkotsu broth is supposed to be rich and kinda dense, but not so dense that you feel sick in your stomach feeling like you just drank cement. The chashu in the pork was so unpleasant. It smelled/tasted like it's been in the freezer forever and thawed incorrectly. It's got that meat smell, old meat that's been there for too long and they try to cover it up with spices but didn't work so it's worse. All of our bowls were more than half full when we sat there disappointed, not moving our chopsticks. The waiter asked what's wrong, we told them what's wrong, and they said "no that's just the way we make our ramen". Now excuse me for the language, but that's SUCH SHIT. My family's been to Ippudo in Japan a million times (so much that we've eaten at Ippudo 7 times a week before we discovered Ichiran), and the service/food/atmosphere between Ippudo NY and Ippudo JP is just heaven to hell. The only decent tasting thing we ordered (and we ordered a LOT because we were starving), was the hirata buns. The pork in the hirata buns were better than the chashu. That's the effort they should've put into making the chashu for the ramen. The bowls were on the small end as well. If it was good, I wouldn't pay close to $20 for it either. Ippudo NY, you are such a let-down. You're embarrassing to the ramen world. ÊI trust that there's better ramen in NY, it's a shame I didn't get to try any. I hated this place.

Yes there is a pretentious feel with the hostesses at the front Yes there is generally a long wait if you go after 7. But... If you follow these steps, there is a high probability that you too will fall for ippudo the way many have. Step one: think of happy thoughts. Step two: pretend you are at your favorite concert and nudge your way to the pretentious hostess to put your name down. Think to yourself "only a 45 minute wait? At least it's not 3 hours..." Step three: Hang out at the bar while you wait- order a kirin and some pork buns. ÊTexture and flavor fireworks in our mouth! (STOP, breathe! think about baseball, avoid anything premature at this time) This small morsel is just a teaser for what is to come! Step four: order akamaru or karaka miso ramen. Prepare for bliss, ready the towels. Step five: order kae dama to prolong your pleasure. Step six: try to stay awake while whispering sweet nothings then hop in a cab while patting yourself on the back for a job well done. Love this place.

Yes, Ippudo has pretty good ramen noodles. ÊThe ramen is freshly made on site. ÊIppudo's ramen comes in 2 kinds of soup base: milky; and clear & light. Ê We ordered the Akamura Modern Ramen and the soup was "milky." ÊOften times, the seasoning makes the soup salty. ÊThis was Not the case. ÊThe flavoring was just right. ÊGarlic oil gave off a nice appetizing aroma. We ordered the Shishito Fried Green Peppers, Hirata Buns, Akamura Modern Ramen, and Green Tea Creme Brulee. Ê The fried green peppers had a nice kick, but was not spicy. ÊThe Hirata buns were pretty good and had a nice creamy mayo sauce. The Green Tea Creme Brulee was just "okay". ÊIt tasted just like a regular creme brulee, except its green. ÊIt had a hard carmel top layer and creamy custard based. ÊBut, it was also topped with green tea ice cream. ÊDouble whammy of the green tea. ÊGreat for St. Patty's Day! Ê Of course, everyone has their own preference when it comes to their noodles and soup base. ÊSo, do give Ippudo a try. Oh there is plenty of hype around ramen noodles these days, so be prepared to stand in line and wait. ÊBest time to go is during day After the lunch crowd. ÊWorse time to go is during dinner time, esp on weekends. Ê Staff were nice and service was good. ÊNice decor. ÊRestrooms were clean. ÊBe careful with the narrow stairway down to the restrooms. Good luck. Wear comfy shoes and may you find your perfect ramen.

You come here to say you did. Food: Pork buns were scrumptious, as were the deep fried oysters. Akamaru Modern --mild broth/noodles cooked superbly. I am not a fan of very fatty meat though, which the pork was...though I knew what I was getting into: (pork belly!) Karaka Kogashi Miso Ramen was extremely rich and difficult to eat. We enjoyed our meals, but later that night I felt extremely sick/nauseous. Wait: On a Sunday night we waited in line for 20 minutes just to put our name on the list. Be prepared to wait three hours for a table, so plan a walk for aperatif somewhere else and come back to check in. The tiny bar was only accommodating around 8pm, otherwise packed. Between 3:30-4:30 and you won't have to wait long. Service: Hostesses were patient, kind, and calm with all the chaos going on around them. Bartender was attentive and replaced my friend's drink when it didn't appeal to her. I expected the dining service to be superb because of the popularity of the restaurant, however, it wasn't. ÊOur waitress was very hurried and generally blah. I think the prices match what you get very well. I'm glad I went, but I probably won't brave all that again just for ramen.

It was my goal to eat at the best Ramen house in New York City during my brief visit over the weekend. I'm from San Diego, which has a fairly decent Asian community, but I've never been blown away by any of the Ramen our fine city has to offer. After reviewing multiple different noodle houses on Yelp, I selected Ippudo as my destination. I walked right in and was greeted robustly by the staff. I was immediately seated and my pork belly appetizer and draft Sapporo were out nearly instantly. I'm a big fan of pork belly, it's like the foi gras of the pork world. Two decent pieces, snickers fun size bar in size. The first piece was incredible, absolutely the most tender piece of meat I've ever eaten, the layer of fat just melted in my mouth, and the meat itself fell apart with the most minimal chewing. The second piece was much tougher, and not as enjoyable. I don't believe this was on purpose, most likely a bad cut of meat, or not prepared as well as the first one. As far as noodles went, I decided to invest (as it was a $13 bowl) in the Akamuren Modern, which is the tonkotsu broth with miso, garlic oil, and a few other bells and whistles. It was simply breath taking. The noodles were perfect, I've always preferred mine with vigor and life, soft noodles are for amateurs and nissin. The broth was awe inspiring, savory, sweet, salty, and spicy, a veritable avalanche of flavors and nuances in a tug of war of taste in my mouth. Ê I only received a slim piece of pork, and a few vegetables in my bowl, but I could really care less. My goal was simply noodles and broth. Before I knew it I had already completed the entirety of my entire bowl was empty. Not to be daunted by a single bowl of ramen, and in the effort to give the menu a full exam, I asked my server if they were serving shoyu ramen. Sadly, my server informed me they only served shoyu ramen during dinner service. Bummer, it's the omelet of the ramen world in my view, and I would love to see how Ippudo does it.

I totally thought I reviewed this place, but I guess not... What can I say about Ippudo that hasn't already been said? ÊThe ramen is spot on, straight from Hakata authentic. ÊThat much I can ascertain (as a girl who used to eat it locally about 3x a week--hey, I didn't get this hot body just sitting on my ass!). Ê I've been several times and the quality of the food has never disappointed me, not even once. ÊI always get the shiomaru since the akamaru is a bit too complex for me--shiomaru tastes like pure pork, and you really can't go wrong with that. ÊTheir plum wine is also delicious. ÊI wish they served it in glasses about 3 times the size they actually served it in. Ê What makes me sad a little, and quite honestly, can't be helped if you're paying a premium for space in Manhattan, are the prices. ÊI'm used to paying tops 8 or 9 bucks a bowl, but at $13 a bowl, it's on the steep side. ÊOn the bright side, it comes with free edamame and a cup of delicious tea (I still can't figure out what it is. ÊHoji-cha?), but those can't possibly be worth the $4-5 difference in price. Ê Despite the prices, I keep coming back to Ippudo time and time again because as of now, it's the best ramen joint in town (until Setagaya opens...).

Pretty good ramen. I got to try all of them because I forced my friends to order the different types of ramen they have (it was my b-day, I was allowed to demand).

The wait is outrageous!!! I waited 45 mins in line for excellent broth but pitiful number of pork in my soup. I ordered the spicy tomkatsu noodle soup and the broth is flavorful and thick. The noodles is nothing special but the portion as well as the quality of the meat is really disappointing. I got 2 thin slices of pork meat in my soup. It tastes well seasoned but on the dry side. I have much better pork slices in other ramen noodles place such as Minca and Menkutei. Overall, it is a great bowl but lacks meat and the wait makes me wonder really what i am waiting for.

Maybe I got lucky, like win the lotto lucky, but I only waited about 5 minutes to be seated here (might help I got there at midnight Saturday night). That being said, this Ramen is the best ramen I've had outside of Japan. And I ate ÊA LOT of Ramen in Japan. First off I'd like to put this out there: IPPUDO beats MOMOFUKU. Why? Because you get better portions for better prices. Momofuku is like the $100 hotel restaurant steak compared to the $40 Ruth's Chris that tastes exactly the same, and for your money you can get more. So yeah, I just said that. Started off with the Hirata pork buns - good sized pork buns with crispy edges, a sweet sauce and a little bit of spicy mayo (nice touch). Then moved onto Ramen. Akamaru Modern with extra sliced pork (seriously, just ask for the extra pork, and you'll love it). Served with a thick thick succulent broth - it tastes like they've been stewing it in a huge pot with an entire pig for days and days - was amazing. The noodle (made in house) had a perfect amount of chewiness and texture - did I mention it was made in house? The pork...oh the pork...more of the similar pork from the Hirata bun, the pork is fatty and salty, which is to say ÊAMAZING. Yes, so order more. Another nice touch, is about halfway through eating it, you can tell your server "Kae Dama" and for another $2 you can have another serving of noodles added to your dish, which basically ill give you a nice 2nd bowl of ramen. If you're splitting your ramen, its a perfect way to satisfy both - if you're like me and you're a fatty - it'll satisfy your craving for more. People complain that they don't think $14 for a bowl of ramen is a good deal. I'll give you that, $14 is crazy when you consider $1 ramen packs at Êthe market $7 bowls of pho at a viet restaurant, and $10 bowls of pasta at Italian places. BUT SERIOUSLY guys, for an authentic, flavorful, and satisfying experience, $14 is a great deal - and when you compare it to the cream of the crop ramen houses (Sapporo, and Momofuku come to mind) its just within the field of play.

ÊThe inside makes you feel like you are in a noodle house in Japan. Ê Other than the long wait - I would go back more often! ÊWe ended up grabbing drinks at another bar and killing time for an hour and then going back for dinner at Ippudo.

Honestly I'm a HUGE ramen fan and I think this place is pretty overrated... The upside: - the bbq pork bun is delicious. It has the Ippudo spicy sauce and the pork is super tender (read fatty). - black cod smelled fishy but super moist and tender - $2 noodles refill if you have broth leftover in your bowl - the cute decor with the variety of ramen bowls on the walls with the red lanterns, the nice seating arrangement, the dried ramen noodles bar and place setting. - Ramen broth was tasty but oily. - Friendly staff and great service The downside: - 1 hour wait to get seated. It's a PITA to keep your excitement after 1 hour wait when it's 40 degrees outside... burrr. - the stringy ramen noodles (I like my noodles chewy and curly) - hard boiled egg (the soft boil eggs are a must for good ramen combo) - expensive for ramen I had better ramen in Japan and other places in the Bay Area... Anyways it's still good but not super like everyone says...

It's a little weird to see people sucking down noodles and following that action by taking a sip of wine. It's also a little odd to think you'd have to wait 90 minutes for a bowl of ramen. But, that's Ippudo for ya...puts a high end spin on something that is normally quite simple. I had a salt based broth, husband had the special Akamaru. Both were delicious. Add an additional serving of noodles, pork buns and fried peppers to that mix...two sapporos on the happy hour special (5 - 8 pm) and you have dinner for two for $65 with tax and tip. Pricey as far as ramen goes, but frankly, I'd do it again...if I didn't have to wait a #$^!# hour and a half.

This place was decent. Actually, above average really. I think it's just because I've heard soooo many great things about it, that my standards were flying sky high. The soup base was great, I wasn't used to the noodles. Wouldn't say it's the BEST ramen outside of Japan b/c everything I've had back in Vancouver was much better. Like, leaps and bounds. For the set lunch, it came to about $20. Which IMO, is hefty for ramen?

My vote for the best ramen in NYC, hands down! Gorgeous decor, fast service (but not rushed!), and tasty tasty noodles and broth are what make this my favorite ramen joint in the city. ÊI have been here repeatedly over the past two years and had consistently good food each time. The small plates of appetizers great - mentaiko rice is fantastic and the steamed pork buns are also worth trying. ÊAll of this is optional though, for those who just want more noodles with their hearty broth, you can order an extra side of noodles. My favorite broth is the slightly spicy one. Waits can be a little long, if coming solo, it's usually a quick/no wait time. ÊHowever, during peak dining hours with groups, I've had to wait 45 minutes - and I did so happily, knowing that the most satisfying noodles in the city would be waiting for me!

This is my first experience of "RAMEN" . i didn't know this existed Were have i been ..i know where EATING TOP RAMEN ..in shame with just the little seasoning package....(and i strained the broth is there any other way) Wow Wow ..~--this is the best combo of words i could think of. When you get inside your greeted by a bar made of Ramen .then different combination of Asian bowls on the wall. We went on a Friday Afternoon, took about 15 minutes to seat us. It was my California friends that were dying to go here it was very busy the thing that stood out the most was the yelling in Japanese. I didn't get it but they explained what they was saying on the menu. The wait staff very accommodating .. Now the Food I had the original my friends had the soy broth ...I can see why this place is loved by many I got the "set" which included rice, with roasted pork and the rice .something was extra good about the rice was soft i cleared that bowl like there was no tomorrow. The Soup i had "extra" pork which was sensory overload of flavors

Lunch stop day #3 in NYC... I am a ramen fanatic. I figure I know what type of Ramen i like by now... We came after 2pm so the wait was only about 5 min. Now this is the fanciest ramen place i've been to EVER. Ordered the Akamaru Modern Ramen along with the pork buns. Pork buns were pretty tasty. Ramen portion was pretty small. I enjoyed mine very much and my bf thought it was super salty (hello MSG!). He thought the portion and the char su was very skimpy. Noodles weren't super springy how we like it.... Overall, for ramen this place is expensive. But hey, you must know that going in by reading all the reviews. Just had to try it!

If you're visiting NYC, this place is a must go. ÊIt's great comfort food, especially on a cold rainy day. ÊThey serve the best ramen i've ever had. Some of the items I tried: Pork buns - great flavor, spicy, fat adds to the flavor, delicious. MUST GET! It was heavenly orgasmic. ramen tried: #2 (akamura modern) - one of the beat ramens I've ever had. Thicker in texture and very flavorful. Leave fat on meat which gives more texture. Excellent. Might be a bit much if you ate the whole bowl considering saltiness flavor. #1 (classic) - thick broth. Light in flavor but keeps the flavor throughout he dish. Very good on a hot day. #4 (shoyu) - light in texture. Soy sauce base. Light and taste. Not too salty. Excellent. - Service is great. The friendly waiters are very attentive. - Price: $14 per bowl. Pricy but worth it. - Waiters are Japanese so feels more authentic. - Decor is modern but sticks to the Asian root. - Hustle feeling and people sit at tables situated right next to each other, very Asian. - Happy hour: 2 for $6 beer

I'm cringing as I do this, but yes, I'm giving this place 3-stars based on my one and only experience here. The Houston ramen scene is laughable/non-existent and I had been excited for weeks to go to NY and try Ippudo's infamous ramen. I was prepared to wait (1 hr 15 min) and my wallet was ready to shell out $20 for a bowl. I must have read over 40 of the 1432 reviews and clicked on 100 of the 413 pictures before I came. Let's just say the only thing kept me sane as my plane descended through turbulence was 1) I'd soon be landing and 2) I'd be able to eat ramen that night. I ordered the Akamaru ramen and the steamed pork buns. The broth was very flavorful, rich, and like nothing I've ever tried before. Although, it was on the heavier side - a tad salty for me. The noodles were thin (like angel hair) and I would have preferred thicker, chewy noodles. The pork belly in the ramen and in the steamed pork buns was tough to chew and not the tender, melt-in-your-mouth feeling every other reviewer seemed to have. My eating partner kept trying to downplay it saying that usually the pork isn't that bad. Sigh. Fail. I really want to like this place. Guess I'll have to wait another 6 months for a redeeming bowl of ramen, as the only time I got to NY anymore is for work.

Three stars for the hip, trendy atmosphere. One star for the food. Solid, and good, but meager portions. One star for the service. Attentive, friendly, and Irrashaimase-yelling. Minus one star for the LONG LONG LONG wait. Waited two hours once for a table of three, and ended up sharing that table with other people. Don't mind the communal style so much, just thought I would point it out. Minus one star for the prices. $15 for a bowl of ramen, and I was still hungry afterwards. And it really doesn't take much to fill me up... Also the spoons are really large and kind of awkward to use. I usually try to sip from it daintily, but on most occasions I fail.

THIS PLACE DESERVES 10 STARS!! seriously, if you've missed all other restaurants, don't worry, you can come here and it'll make your trip to NYC worthwhile. first of all, their ramen is just ORGASMIC. i don't use this adjective very often, but that's really how good it tasted. i took one sip of the soup, and i couldn't help but stop and jump for joy. oh god, don't order anything else. you have to try their Akamaru Modern. it is the best ramen that i've had in my life. something about the soup makes it tastes devine. the noodle is not the regular ramen noodle, but rather the soba noodle. in addition, the pork buns are also equally amazing. definitely recommend getting it!!

Stopped in Êwith a friend after a long bus ride up to NYC for the weekend. We were seated right away as it was around 10:45PM on a Thursday night. Started with the pork buns, and then had the Akamaru Modern. I'll be honest... both were really good but it didn't blow me away or reach the expectations i paced when i tried to come last year and was greeted with a 1 hour wait. But all in all, Ippudo is a place i'll definitely want to come back to in the future but i probably wouldn't go out of my way or even wait more than 20 minutes for. Quick Tip for you beer lovers: Try the Japanese Stout they have along with the pork bun. Pretty good combo!

FInally the wait is OVER!! I've heard so much hype about this place and have been trying to come here several times but the wait was always too long. ÊI made a spontaneous trip into the city just to give this place a shot and see if yelp delivers. And boy did it show me up big time. Even though I still had to wait an hour (recommend going down the street to Chikalicious Dessert Club during the wait), I finally got to sit down and try those pork buns and ramen everybody talked about. ÊI was SO happy to see that the pork buns were made with the same kind of soft bread as the peking duck sandwiches at the peking duck stall in flushing. There was also a spicy mayo type sauce on top of the pork and lettuce. An absolute 5 out of 5. I asked our cute waiter whether i should try the Sichuan ramen (spicy) or the classic. He recommended the Sichuan style so i trusted him and went with it. No regrets. The broth was amazing with a little bit of a kick to it. Nothing too spicy though. The pork belly was super tender. I loved the concept of extra ramen for $2 but knowing myself, my eyes are bigger than my stomach so I settled with digging for every little piece of ramen left at the bottom before reluctantly giving up my bowl to the waiter. ÊMy friend ordered two desserts- pear and blood orange sorbet and the green tea marscapone (sp?). They were okay in my opinion. I'm not a huge fan of green tea flavored desserts. I would definitely go back for the ramen and pork buns though. Two thumbs up. I'm going to bask in my food coma and think about when I can return for a second round...

I don't wait in line on the street like a Plebe; I simply go in early, put my name down and then go shopping or have drinks at Angel's Share, a to-die-for bar a block away. The ramen here is insanely fastastic; I've been to Tokyo and lived in Japantowns all over California and this may just be the best ever. I do advise coming in early in the evening though, because the quality seems to decline later at night. I ordered the special miso ramen for the month and was amazed a week ago at 7PM, while I had it yesterday at 9PM and wasn't so impressed. The flavors seemed to be muddier and they skimped on the broth-- probably because they were running out. They don't take reservations, except in person, and they are insanely busy every evening, even on rainy weekday nights. Come 2 hours early (unless you want to have lunch or eat right when they open for dinner at 5) and put your name down and come back. Generally they are a bit later than they say, and if you come at 10 or so on a weeknight the wait is often "only" an hour or so. The noodles are handmade and come in various thicknesses, depending on the broth, the buns are awesome, the seafood appetizers amazing and the ambiance really nice for a reasonably priced restaurant (even if it's a bit noisy). The service is good and the waitstaff are mostly hot young students of white, Asian and Eurasian extraction, who often butcher the Japanese greetings they shout. :P Ramen aficionados must here at least once; it's part of your ramen bucket list. :)

The first time I went to Ippudo was on a cold day (-6C) at 10pm. The place was packed and the wait was 1.5 hours. I decided to try again another time because I just had to see if Ippudo was as great as everyone said it was. It's true, Ippudo IS good. The broth is good, I had the Akamaru Modern and I sampled the broth of my friends' ramen (they had the vegetarian and the burnt miso). While the ramen is good, I must say that you are also paying for the ambiance and decor of the place, which has a nice modern vibe to it. My friends and I were seated at a booth, and it was very nice! I liked the seats and the rope textile underneath the glass table. However, the portion of the ramen is small and they are skimpy with the toppings. I should point out that I don't eat lot. For example, I normally share a happy meal with another person and I also shared this ramen with someone since I was eating it at 12AM. I didn't get an egg with my Akamaru Modern because I think it was like $2 to add an egg... and the Akamaru Modern was already $14. Seriously, for $14, you should have at least half an egg in it already! As for the Akamaru Modern, the soup base was very good. The noodles were pretty good, but they were the thin ramen type. I prefer the thicker noodles that was in the burnt miso/vegetarian ramens. Perhaps I can ask them to give me the other noodles the next time I go (but some ramen places refuse to do that type of thing, so who knows). The burnt miso broth was also very flavorful. The waitress described it as having a "charcoal" taste which doesn't sound very appetizing... but it is tasty. The vegetarian broth tasted sort of like shoyu broth, but sweeter. I think it would have been better if it was less sweet, but that's just me. Overall, Ippudo is quite tasty.... but also quite $$$ for ramen. But the service/ambiance is also above average. This place is also open very late, so it is convenient for those who like to snack late at night like me! And they have all broths available, even at 12AM, that's AMAZING!

How is it possible to get so many people to review this place on Yelp? Ridiculous -- but at any rate -- that was good PR on their part because that was the deciding factor that made me want to go eat there. For those skimming Yelp entries for the gist of things, here are a few key takeaways: 01. THIS IS A RAMEN HOUSE 02. WORKERS ARE LOUD AS HELL 03. 1-2PM WEEKDAYS IS A GOOD TIME TO GO 04. OVER-PRICED FOR WHAT IT IS, BUT WILL GET YOU FULL Now for the details, we ended up waiting only about 15 minutes because we had arrived at the tail-end of lunch. The ambiance was nice, and all the workers were literally extremely friendly and helpful. The only annoying part was that their 'irashaimase' and 'arigatougozaimashita' belting was too obnoxious to have a decent conversation with anyone you were eating with haha. I ordered the Akamatsu Modern? + Unagi rice bowl lunch combo. It was enough to fill me but not to the point of not being able to finish. Quality of everything was good and the food came pretty fast. Although, seriously, I swear you can find tastier ramen houses somewhere else in this city & for cheaper. What a rip off ...$20 for ramen when you can just make the same caliber for about $8. In Seattle -- it can be done! Either way, this place was good but not phenomenal. I will not return. But it's worth checking out and frequenting especially if you live or work around the area.

Essentially, Ippudo is what you get if you ask a trained chef to make ramen for a living. In Japan, the restaurant is a chain, sporting multiple locations, but in New York, there is only one location. Wait times can get quite long since Ippudo seems to have found a niche in the food world. The noodles are handmade and fresh, and the broth is too. I agree that Ippudo ramen has a distinctly different taste than cheap, packaged ramen, but I can't say that Ippudo is the transformative experience I was looking for. While flour noodles floating in broth would be a great pre-race carbo-loading meal, ramen is definitely not something you would want to eat on a daily basis. In summary, I would say, give Ippudo a try, but I would not visit Ippudo again since there are many more choices for great food in New York.

If Naruto was real he would definitely make Ippudo his favorite Ramen shop. This review will be quite short. Their only problem is that they are TOO GOOD so there is always a wait of some sort. Now then, the broth is great, the noodles are not overcooked and its all so good and flavorful you just want to continue eating, slurping and then want more. If you are careful not to drink all your broth, you can order more noodles for your soup. Just great stuff! Definitely a must go to all Ramen lovers. Oh the service is very friendly, and they greet you as you walk in with a good cheer. Kudos to all the service and kitchen staff!

Its the best quality ramen, I had the akesgsdow(sorry I forgot how to spell it) modern with rice & eel. It was delicious. I finished the whole meal from start to finish. I was quite pleased.

At 6:00 on Friday night, Ippudo's wait for 3 was about 40 minutes. ÊThe restaurant's exterior resembles a fairly traditional Japanese restaurant, but the decor inside is very trendy. ÊThe restaurant is dark with black and red walls filled with mirrors; because of this, it can be somewhat disorienting to walk around the restaurant. ÊThe decor was too trendy for me, but one cool part was the murals they have in the bathroom; from afar, it looks like an ordinary picture of a geisha, but it's really made of small scraps of paper, kind of like a photomosaic. ÊPretty cool. Ê I ordered the Shiromaru Hakata Classic ramen, which I thought was okay. ÊTo be honest, I prefer udon over ramen, but to me, the broth was a little too salty and the noodles were too thin to be real ramen. ÊI was also able to try the Akamaru Modern and the Kogashi Miso. ÊThe noodles in the Kogashi Miso were more similar to ramen I've had: they were a bit thicker and had a softer texture. ÊThe Modern had the same style noodles as the Classic. ÊAll of the broths were a bit salty for me. ÊThe portions are big and should be enough to fill you up on their own; I was only able to finish a small portion of it and gave the rest to my friend. I would definitely recommend coming a little earlier for dinner; we were lucky because we didn't have to wait too long, but by the time we left (~7:30), the bar was much more crowded, and others were waiting outside of the restaurant. ÊPerhaps the best time to eat at Ippudo would be during the fall or the winter when it's easier to enjoy a nice bowl of hot noodle soup; it's getting hot enough just going into the summer that trying to eat the whole bowl can be overwhelming.

What's all the fuss about? Wasn't blown by the ramen special. It had way too much garlic in it. Tried a few small dishes but wasn't digging them either. The chicken wings and short ribs were ok. The noodles were a bit too al dente for me. And $16 for ramen is just not cool. If you're gonna charge me double the price it better be 4x as good!

I get it. Ramen is super. But how much better can one ramen be than another ramen? A lot. A whole lot. Ippudo has the best pork ramen broth I've had in my life. It's way better than Momofuku (I feel a little blasphemous saying this since I'm a huge David Chang fan) and way way better than Minca. The pork buns are pretty darn good, too, though Momofuku wins in this category (whew - I feel a little less guilty now). I ordered the Shiromaru classic ramen with a poached egg, but found that the richness of the milky broth didn't need the extra oomph from the egg (though I did thoroughly enjoy it). Next time, I'll be having the Akamaru Modern, which is like the classic except with a spicy little kick. If you're famished, don't finish all your broth. For 2 bucks, you can get Kae-dama, which is basically noodle refill, and then you can extend your eating pleasure for another round. Full review and pics on my blog at http://wp.me/pAdDT-8x

The Akamaru Modern broth is perfect! Flavors are rich and complex. It is probably one of my favorite broths. Noodles were cooked well but I like slightly thicker/chewier noodles. Just a taste preference. Tori Karaage Fried Chicken was tasty but really..when is fried chicken not tasty? Hirata Buns (Pork) were okay. Meat was not that tender but flavor was alright Yamitsuki Goma Kyuri Cucumbers are so good. Love the crispness and the tasty sesame oil dressing The waiting area is small and the wait is usually long. There also are only a few chairs in the waiting area. I have gone here at 9pm and at like 130 or 2pm and there always seems to be a pretty decently long wait.

We went here after a rave review from a friend. ordered pork ramen with and without the ippudo special sauce. the broth tasted great at first, but half way through the dish, the whole thing tasted like an overload of msg. we also ordered the chef's taste menu which consisted of 4 small... tiny dishes - tofu, 2 tiny pieces of chicken katsu with mayo, pork belly, and 2 tiny shrimps = $20. if you enjoy great service, i would highly recommend and the decor is really nice, but if you're looking for authentic ramen, this is not for you.

I've had a lot of ramen before, but damn this place is goooood! And I have absolutely no objections to paying $13 for a bowl of noodles in this place. (That broth is slammin'!) I had the Spicy Tonkatsu Ramen and it was nice and spicy, perfect for a cold winter night. My companion had the Modern and it was quite tasty. We also ordered a side of berkshire pork belly, which was super tender. By the way, we went on a Friday evening at 6:30pm and was seated promptly. By the time we left the place had people lining up out the door. So my advice is to go early.

A good friend of mine suggested I check this place out after not being wow'd (sham wow style) at Momofuko and it was great. My previous favorite spot for ramen was in Little Tokyo in Downtown LA but this place is better (although, just a bit more expensive, but thats okay). Started at the 2 for 1 bar and headed to the table and everything was great. Plenty of people on here have gone into detail about each entree so I don't really need to dive into it all that much, just know it's good. I am planning on making this a regular stop for me, especially during the winter.

For my 100th review, I knew I had to review someplace special. A place that holds a special place in my food loving heart. A place that has the most amazing bowl of ramen I have ever put in my mouth. OH EM GEE! I don't even know why I've never reviewed this place. I think I've tried just about everything on the menu now and it never gets old. You may complain that each bowl is about $13 bucks, but pay for a $16 bowl at Momofuku Noodle bar and you will wish you never talked bad about the Ramen King! The noodles are insanely fresh and made downstairs. You can even watch through the little window on your way to the bathrooms. The broth is PERFECTION! $2 gets you extra noodles, soft and chewy, just the way i like it. Pork buns could use a little less sauce, but still very tasty. Pork belly, GOOOOOOOOOOD. Chicken wings, GOOOOOOD. All the food was just GOOOOOOOOOOOOOD times 10. They must sprinkle some addictive substances in their ramen because ever since my first time, all I do is crave Ippudo. I want to be permanently hooked up to a machine that feeds me their ramen. Or I'm gonna have to marry this Ramen King and make his ramen babies just so I can get my daily fix. Drool. Need. Ippudo. NOW! BUT... I must say the drinks aren't very strong. I think I had three one night and felt absolutely nothing. Tasty though.

Ran over here for lunch on a hot, hot day. I was shouted back to the big table and sat in the best spot, next to the pillar. Had the Miso Ramen with seasoned egg and the peppers to start. The peppers came in one split second. They were really good but, for one person, a little much with pepper, pepper, pepper. The ramen took a couple minutes longer than it should have to come, but it was SO GOOD! A little stingy on the toppings. One star off for no gyoza.

What? i cant believe it? Ive never written a review on Ippudo yet? This is absurd! im completely shocked! As all the reviews have already stated this is the best mofo - ing Ramen place in the city BY FAR. There is NOTHING that even comes close to ippudo... I think ive been to at least 10 Ramen places in the city and nothing can even compare. my only problem is that its too f ' in good that theres always an hour + wait to get the food. mmmmm everyones so damn friendly too! Its crazy! all the wait staff, kitchen staff, etc! Great Food, Great Service, Great Atmosphere ( i like crowded places, more the merrier) What can you possibly complain about besides the long wait. The noodles are simply delicious. I love how they are fresh and home made. The akamaru modern, which is seasoned with garlic oil and a secret sauce has no comparison. This is simply the best. yum yum yum yum yum Im starving now :(

Asking my foodie friends about their favorite places to eat in NYC, Ippudo consistently popped up amongst the top of their lists. There surely had to be something to my trusted friends' hype, right? I must be honest. I'm not much of a ramen head. I ate it when I was little and hungry before I realized the miniature sodium packets could kill me. As an older girl, I had minimal experience with the stuff. But if it was on EVERYONE's list of places to go, I figured it'd be worth the shot. I went with two NYC residents (neither had been there before) on a Sunday afternoon, and was taken aback by the darkness of the interior. While we waited to be sat, I made a trip down to their bathroom. It was cool to see the ramen being made downstairs. After about a 20 minute wait, were sat at a table that could've easily accommodated a party twice our size, and I took to the task of figuring out what to order. After consulting with the rest of my table (seeing as they had more ramen experience than I did) and our server, I opted for the Akamaru Modern ramen. While it was good, and I pretty much bodied the whole bowl, it certainly wasn't earth-shattering either. The flavors were generally delicate (maybe too much so) yet there was an overwhelming saltiness to the broth. The pork was quite tender and the rest of the garnishes were generally well cooked and had good texture. I'd go again if I lived in town because the other options my friends had and what filled out the rest of the menu looked intriguing. But I can't see myself waiting an hour for it.

The Bad - Long wait - No sense of privacy since you are most likely bound to sit with other people - Expensive for ramen - No take out!! The Good - Karaka Men (better than average ramen--although not the highlight Êof the day---not that spicy) - Pork bun (best pork bun I ever tasted although they should cut out some fat; but overall loved the pork Êbun)--really expensive though The Bottomline- Definitely worth coming just to try their pork buns. Forget their ramen. Just order a couple of pork buns and you are good to go. These pork buns are way more awesomer than regular asian dim sum restaurants. Yummm

Love their ramen and the pork bun!!! I will not talk about their ramen since it's their signature dish and has been known by many how delish and flavorful it is. Ê Besides their famous ramen dishes, you should try their pork bun as well. ÊThe pork is marinated and cooked so well that it absorbs all the flavor, juicy and very very tender!! The bun itself is very very good too! So I would recommend the pork bun!

The wait for 2 around 12:30 was less than 30 minutes. Better than I expected! Pork buns = bomb. Totally worth the $8 and a great appetizer while waiting for your ramen. I got the Akamaru Modern (yum) and my dad got the special (Shio something). ÊI wish I had realized that the noodles were straight and thin before coming here. I hate to say that I discriminate against any noodles that aren't crinkly and thick, but I do. Thus my experience was slightly marred when I saw people slurping straight noodles. I think they go down too easily and aren't chewy enough. However, for straight noodles, Ippudo does it goooood. Loved everything else about the Akamaru Modern, from the incredibly flavorful broth to the tender, tender pork. Ê Prices are a little ridiculous though. I can get a perfectly delicious bowl of ramen for under $10 in the Bay Area. Ippudo is certainly an experience, but would not be a place I frequent.

$13.00 for a bowl of ramen with a somewhat over-salty broth, skimpy toppings and a greasy slice of pork is an experience which I do not plan on repeating ever again. I had very high expectations of this place, based on the reviews that have been written here, but was sorely disappointed. The much hyped-up ramen here did not justify the steep price one bit; and I still think Shinsengumi Hakata Ramen out in California serves the best tonkotsu ramen in this continent. Much as I tried, I could not bring myself to finish my bowl of Shiromaru and didn't bother to stay for dessert either. Sorry, Ippudo.

There are probably many better options in NYC, but this place is still pretty alright. They are fancy schmancy looking. They sure need to turn up the A/C though when you're eating your boiling hot ramen and it's 80F outside... The soup is pretty good, it's almost the traditional fatty pork broth, plus a little sweetness, maybe from the addition of a soy sauce or other seasoning. The noodles are a nice chewiness. Biggest gripe is the portion size. You get two pieces of paper-thin pork. A couple of green onions. BUT, I like that they added 'cloud ear' fungus. I love that stuff. But I want moooore of that in my ramen. At least you can add an unlimited amount of sesame yourself with the grater on the table. Muahaha! The overall bowl portion was just right for me. But I'm smaller than most people--maybe my tummy is average size.

Taking off 1 star just because it is a bit pricey and the portions are small but still VERY WORTH A TRY! The decor and ambiance of this place is amazing. Luckily we came in a large group and got our own section. Seemed like smaller groups (2-3 people) were getting seated with other people. Well, more like a long table and they just seat people together. I can't freaking eat with some strangers directly in front of me! On with the food: - Akamaru Ramen - Delicious! The soup/broth is very well prepared. Only bad part is that it's $13. - Harita Buns (sp?) - Pork buns taste better than the chicken buns. Very tender meat. Good sauce. However, the chicken was a little too saucy. $8 for 2 buns. - Chicken Karaage (sp?) - So good! I only wished the gave me more!

Ippudo effectively transports ramen lovers to Japan, where the chain hails from, to happily slurp noodles. Ê While the East Village presents a mini Japan of its own, replete with the requisite assortment of ramen shops, Ippudo out does anything ramen the East Village can offer--both in terms of quality broth and interminable lines. Ê An hour-long wait is not uncommon on weekday nights, and weekend waits offer a challenging test of patience, sometimes reaching two hours. Ê What can one expect after such a wait? I recommend the shiomaru ramen, with its rich broth of meaty, smoky flavors, and garnished with a modicum of fatty pork, scallions, and cabbage leaves. For a heavier ramen, I recommend the miso ramen, which offers a rich, sweet, nutty flavor. Ê Unlike the typical bamboo boxes that most ramen shops set up in, Ippudo offers a different design: a Kurosawa-meets-Enter-the-Dragon aesthetic, complete with calligraphy murals, disorienting mirrors, and a bamboo hut. To taste great flavor-packed pork broth, skip the trip to Japan, and head to Ippudo.

Got here at like 4 or 4:30, no wait at all (the place was half empty!). Cool interior, lots of Asian-inspired decor. We were seated at a U-shaped community table, which was kinda cool. You are far enough away from most of the people at the table so it's not too awkward. Started with the pork buns- exceptional. That pork is so damn good, along with the slightly spicy sauce that is in there as well. Also had the black pepper chicken wings- also good, very peppery (obviously) but kinda sweet at the same time. She had the Akamaru and I went with the anniversary special. She liked hers but we both agreed mine was better. Why? The broth. It just seemed to have more flavor. The ingredients in each of our dishes was pretty similar so not sure what the differences are but go with the special. The noodles themselves were good, not amazing or anything. And again, the pork in the soup was awesome.

For every Ippudo skeptic, there are 10 ramen believers. ÊI believe, I believe! I ate at Ippudo almost 3 months ago and still daydream about those silky smooth noodles and that heavenly broth. ÊIt's hard to believe a $13 bowl of noodles could be so life-transcending, but this place really lives up to the hype. ÊIf they offer the special appetizer of jalapeno peppers, order them right away, you shant regret it. ÊThey're accompanied by a yellow powder for dipping (damn my weak memory) which may as well have been cocaine because it was so damn delicious and addicting.

This is the ramen shop of choice for me and my friends whenever we are near the EV. I usually start with the Hirata Buns and split a bowl of Shiromaru Hakata Classic with whomever is accompanying me for lunch or dinner. Since I prefer a higher ratio of meat to ramen, I end up ordering a couple of sides of Kakuni (awesome braised pork belly) and throw in an extra Nitamago (hard boiled egg). Of course, all of this goes very well with an Asahi Super Dry:-) Be warned, it's best to try going here after the lunch rush (1:00 pm is decent), or after 9:00 pm on the weekdays. Expect a long wait (1-2 hours) Friday and Saturday evenings. The service has always been excellent, although it is a bit weird to hear a few of the non-Japanese waiters shouting to the kitchen and patrons in Japanese.

Ippudo has messed me up. I crave their thick magical ramen ALL THE TIME but don't want to deal with the waits, so go to setagaya or minca or rai rai ken. (Screw Momo and its $17 ramen). But no bowl even approaches being as good, which just makes me crave Ippudo more and drag my boyfriend back the next day. I'm an Akamaru loyalist, though the Kogashi is worth trying. Go during off-hours for a chance of no wait. Slightly cheesy interior.

This is the second time I came here for ramen. ÊI didn't like it the first time around. I couldn't remember what I ordered, but I did remember the pork not being fresh. Last night, however, after a grueling 2 hour wait, I got to try ippudo ramen again. ÊWe started out with pork buns, which were pretty solid. ÊThey were tasty (especially the fatty part) and the lettuce gave a nice crunchy texture. ÊThe sauce was a bit spicy, but it added to the flavor of the pork. We also ate chicken wings- they were spicy, sweet and crispy, but not the best ones I've had. ÊThey weren't as good as San Tung's or Um Ma Son chicken wings...with oozing spicy, garlic sweet sauce. They weren't bad though. I ordered the modern ramen with garlic oil. The soup was nice and light compared to the creamier broth in the classic ramen. ÊThe thin egg noodles were sooooo delicious!!! ÊThey were very fresh and fit perfectly with the rest of the meal. This time the pork was perfect..."melt in your mouth" flavor. ÊI recommend getting a nice beer on the side to balance the savory-ness of the broth. ÊMy sister thinks it's better than Santa Ramen which is a huge statement to make. Too bad the wait is so long. :(

NOT WORTH THE WAIT!!!!!! That is what someone should scream at the crowds of people waiting at the bar and outside the restaurant. Ê A 2 hour wait is just outrageous for ramen. ÊIt is ridiculous. ÊOF COURSE it will taste good after starving for about 2 hours to get a table and another half hour for your food. ÊYes the ramen is pretty good but no ramen is worth that kind of a wait. Never, ever. Ê How about this: look into those peep holes in the wood paneling and count how many empty tables you see. ÊYes, Ippudo plays that game. ÊMake everyone wait at the bar forever when there are empty tables in the restaurant. Ê The bad attitude of the hostesses doesn't help either. ÊI do not understand why Ippudo needs 3 hostesses to stand there, do nothing, and give people an attitude. I will not return.

I have eaten at Ippudo twice so far, and I can honestly say that the ramen is pretty good. ÊIs it the BEST ramen in town? ÊI can't really answer that. ÊHowever, the ambiance is nice and they really did try their best to give visitors the best "ramen" experience when they designed this restaurant. Ê Two of the negatives that I can think of are: 1) ÊThe long wait. ÊI know that this is probably one of the trendier and more popular ramen places in town, but waiting an hour for ramen might be considered unreasonable to some. 2) ÊThe prices. ÊYes, the ramen was good, but paying $12-$13 for a bowl of ramen can be quite steep. ÊThe last time I went there, the bill came out to about $100 for a party of 2.

Good ramen is hard to find, especially in Boston. There's pretty much just Ken's and Sapporo Ramen. I figured I would try to find some during my next trip to New York so I asked a friend what his favorite place for ramen in NYC was. Without hesitation, he mentioned this place Ippudo. I probably should have familiarized myself with the place (via Yelp) before going as I could have walked into a beastly wait. I also almost missed the place since the sign is in Kanji. I arrived at about 5-5:30 which only required a 15 minute wait. Right away I was pulled in by the fun atmosphere. Waitstaff and chefs shouting welcoming japanese phrases and delicious smells filled the room. I sat at the bar which I recommend if you're not with a large party. It's fun to watch the chefs at work and talk to the staff when they're not too busy. Staff gets an A+ for friendliness and knowledge of the menu. Despite being very busy they manage to make great conversation and take an active interest in their customers. I also had someone offer me a sample of a dish not on the menu, a battered fried baby octopus. Soooo delicious! :D I also tried on of these amazing pork buns everyone raves about. The meat was quite tender and succulent and the spicy sauce compliments them nicely. On to the Ramen! I tried the Shoyu ramen (soy sauce) as that's how I test a ramen place's quality. The price is pretty high at $13 but I just found out you can pay $2 for seconds on the noodles and essentially get two bowls as a result. The presentation was nice and the flavor of the broth was excellent. I hadn't finished a full bowl of ramen in quite some time before this place. I cannot stress enough the quality of their pork! It melts in your mouth! A must try for traditional ramen fans. So while I got lucky, I would advise anyone coming with a party be prepared for a wait. I couldn't believe the crowd of people waiting outside as I was leaving. Definitely worth a trip!

Best ramen in New York City - period. Went on a Monday afternoon and was seated immediately. Tables are communal. Ordered a Kirin. Waiters are extremely friendly and Japanese orders being yelled back and forth makes for a fun atmosphere. I ordered the Karaka Men with Nitamago (seasoned salt boiled egg) and Kakani (braised pork belly). The broth was silky and flavorful with perfect blend of spicy. The cabbage, pork, mushrooms were divine as were the noodles. I will go back for the pork buns - and keep going back for the ramen. Loved it.

Ok there are more than enough reviews here to give you the idea that this ramen place is the place that is worth checking out despite the rude hostesses. 1. If eating with more than two people, the earlier the better... after three attempts at waiting in line for more than an hour for 4 seats during normal dinner hours (7pm onwards), Êwe did the early bird special and went around 5:15pm and had only a 20min wait. 2. Skip the pork buns, youre here for ramen...use the carbs for extra noodles instead. The buns are soft but just ok in my opinion, plus you can get cheaper and better in Flushing. 3. Dont listen to anyone who says to get anything other than the original (aka "Akamaru"). Like anything original, its tried and true for a reason and considering how many time or how long you just waited to get in, its daunting to think youll be queuing up anytime soon for a second try. 4. Slurp, you really do taste more depth in the broth when you do so :)

Ramen with pork loin chashu, kikurage, menma, egg, red pickled ginger, sesame & scallions. YUM! Definitely THE best ramen I've ever had.

Only four starts because it was a bit loud with conversation, music, and waiters/chefs yelling orders. Not the place to go for an intimate talk. But really great Japanese food. Makes my vegetarianism more of a distant past while I ate their pork buns. (We had to have a second order, too) Ramen met my expectations. I tried my friend's but the one I ordered was the best: Miso Ramen. Ippudo has the best appetizers though a bit small. I recommend the Ippudo Salad and Tako Wasabi.

There is nothing more comforting than a big-ass bowl of ramen from this hip ramen and kakuni bun restaurant. ÊTheir Hakata ramen is SO flavorful, and the buns have just the right amount of kick to them. ÊWho doesn't like kakuni??? ÊIt's comfort food to the nth degree for fans of Japanese food.

First we waited an extra 30 minutes because one of the three hostesses up there wrote our name AND number in our party down wrong. Three of you! And we were sitting right in front of them. No apologies, just a you'll be next. The bartender was fun and sweet. The bathrooms were clean. The fried peppers were mild and very spicy. The ramen. Meh. I ordered the special. Why oh why did I not read my favorite Yelper reviews first? I'm usually great at ordering. It was a creamy wasabi broth, delicious but not complex. With yummy noodles - but two thin slices of pork and some green onions and one tiny dime sized piece of fishcake. I wish someone, the waiter, someone - told me to add more stuff, but I thought as the special it'd be loaded. I added $2 for 3 tatertot sized bits of rice with pooped rice and seaweed - yeah just order extra noodles. It was served not hot. Not lukewarm, but not hot. Same with some mopwater tea. How do you serve warm tea?

I came upon Ippudo by accident with my hun & some friends last night after being turned away by another restaurant around the corner from Ippudo. We had walked by Ippudo on our way to the other place and decided to circle back to check it out. We were immediately greeted by a hostess who took our name down and told us the wait would be between 40-45minutes for 5 ppl. We hung out at the bar area just inside the door with a ton of other patrons. The wait wasn't bad at all and before we knew it, she called my name and we were taken to our table. The restaurant is dimly lit and is sizable. The bar in front is small but the waiting area is actually quite big and so there's standing room w/o being overly crowded as you wait to be seated. It's great space to accommodate group gatherings. As we were led to our table, we were greeted by several staff members "thanking" us for waiting! How insane and great is that?! We were FINALLY seated at a rather "strange" table/booth. It was in a corner that was unusually dark and beside another booth/table that looked like it was temporarily being used as a storage area. Our server came over to greet us immediately to hand us the menu. Forgive me because I can't remember all the various Ramen's we ordered. I had the Miso Ramen which I enjoyed because the Ramen noodle was super chewy and thick just the way I like it. My friends all wiped out there Ramen noodles and almost drank all the broth too. I gave away the pork in my soup because I don't like the taste of it and there was a bit of fat around it. We ordered a Green Tea Creme Brulee and their dessert special of the day, which tasted like fresh Soy based Tofu. The Green Tea dessert was fabulous! The music was a bit TOO LOUD which made it a bit tough to hear each other. Perhaps they could pick something more mellow instead of the HARD ROCK that was blaring. The service was EXTREMELY polite and friendly. I think it was the BEST service I've ever received and this includes the high end places I've dined at! When we left, I believe the restaurant manager actually opened and held the door for us! I'm definitely a fan and will come back to try their other menu options.

Apps - great, you may as well order them all, the portions are smallish but they are yummy yummy yummy. Ramen, we all had the house standard house variety, it was very good but upset our tummy the next day....too rich? I rate the Ramen up there with Minca, but if I was just wanting Ramen I'd go to Minca as it's cheaper and you get more pork! Overall it's a great spot, go early as the place is getting slammed.

This is one of the best ramen destinations in the city, and everyone knows it. ÊThe decor is very modern, the main room is spacious, and the service is kind and attentive, if not super-quick. Ê How's the ramen? ÊReally damn good. ÊA bit saltier than Ippudo locations I've tried in Japan. ÊBut still really good. ÊBut really overpriced. Ê Going for lunch is probably the best way to go, because their lunch special comes with a great plate of pickes, and a small donburi with either pork-belly or spicy cod roe, both of which are fantastic.

Finally got in the door here as I went randomly for lunch on a weekday -- the wait at night is still far longer than I'd choose to endure -- and was seated within five minutes, at a communal table. ÊI had the classic ramen as part of the lunch set, which came with a small salad and a rice dish of my choosing (I chose the roast pork on rice, my companion got the codfish eggs, along with her ramen, which was a spicy version of the classic broth) for $16. ÊA little much, but with the lines and the hype it was about right. The milky-looking broth in the classic is every bit as good as everyone says. ÊSo was the pork, and the noodles were just right. ÊThe addition of generous amounts of ginger put it over the top. ÊExcellent. ÊThe rice dish and salad were very good too. ÊI think I prefer the larger assortment of items that Momofuku puts in their ramen, but this was a better product overall. Service was good. ÊThey refused to put part of one of the ramens in a container to take home, which was a little frustrating, but overall it was very pleasing.

I know I haven't been to many places since moving to NYC this fall, but today I was lucky to try out Ippudo, just a skip away from the Astor Place station. Ramen was very delicious, mostly because it was authentic and had lots of pork belly fat, butter, and miso in it. It was the perfect dish for a freezing cold day and wasn't over the top expensive. My friend had the set with the roast pork on rice, which looked and tasted - so he said - absolutely delicious. The ambience was really cute. The tables were a little tight, but it was cozy. We had the green tea creme brulee afterwards and it was heavenly. I would totally come back again anytime!!!!

:'( I once heard from a friend, A, Ippudo is their favorite restaurant in NYC. I once heard from a friend, B, Ippudo is their favorite Japanese indulgence. I once heard from a friend, C, I have to take you there, asap! I once heard from a friend, D, Best Ramen shop, period. You heard from me: "OVER-HYPED.." If you've ever been to Japan (or even Frisco), you'll know that Ippudo is not the tastiest Ramen shop around. Especially, since they have consistent hour-plus queues, the noodles should be To-Die-For. However, the soup nor the noodles ticked my fancy, even after the hour long wait. I had no urge to gulp down the soup; nor were the noodles "springy" enough for ramen standards. But, maybe it's the uber-distinct architecture. Maybe it's the appetizers and the additional dishes (pork buns). But as for the Ramen: 5 points, out of 10. -- Because 90% of random ramen bars in Tokyo rock this Ippudo. For the lunch-set price, maybe that brings the rating to a 7. For NYC/East-coast standards, I guess it deserves a 9.. (since my Japanese hairstylist has Ippudo as his top ramen shop.) However, I have yet to explore the ramen scene.. Once I do some more digging, as Arnold said in Terminator -- "I'll be Back..." ..with updates~

I have been reading rave reviews about Ipuddo for a long time and finally had a chance to dine here. They don't take reservations but we were 2 at 5:45pm on Wednesday night and seated immediately. I have to say the chic atmosphere and communal tables make this a fun spot for a date. Yet I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that the food here left me longing for the huge noodle dishes at Yamo, a hole-in-the-wall spot in the Mission District in San Francisco. I had the "special ramen" of the day which was wonderful and my brother had the wonton soup. We ordered pork buns to start. They were spicy and the buns were perfect but it's more of a sandwich then the dim sum I'm used to. The lettuce also tasted like it was from McDonald's and made me question the $8 price tag for two. Overall, this is a wonderful spot for reasonable NYC prices. I realize I love the idea of ramen, I just like it more when the setting is grittier. Most will probably disagree with me but I often consider "no frills" more fun.

Oh. My. God. If I could only eat one meal for the rest of my life- it would be this one! (Granted it would be a very short, but very delicious life) We went here on a recommendation of the friend (who came with us). And I got the Modern with the braised pork on top. The ramen was delicious. The soup a kind of miso based not too salty. The noodles were delicious. But really what got me was the braised pork and the way that flavor entered every spoonful of soup. The meat was even beautiful to look at- marinated in some kind of magic soy secret delicious seasoning. And so tender I could cut it with my chopsticks! I don't know if I've mentioned this before, but it is my goal in life to discover the best pork dishes out there (sorry non-pork eating cultures!). And Ippudo has definitely topped the list. They even have the option of just eating the braised pork by itself as a main dish, which I am tempted to try. However, the website says that "Ramen is Japan's Soul Food". And I have to concur. Comforting, rich, and meaty! Note: This is my first Yelp review after a 2 year hiatus. Yes it was THAT good that it made me Yelp again!

Yes, you do have to wait but really, what good ramen house ever comes without a wait? If you are a ramenaholic, I know you don't mind waiting.

ÊIf I am lucky to go again, I may try others but it's so hard to give up a good thing in search of something better.

Mmm...Mmm...Mmmm... Memories of the ramen last night keep interrupting my thoughts as I try to write this review early Saturday morning. Oh those slurpy noodles! Oh that rich, meaty broth! Oh I am so hungry. This place actually DOES live up to all the hype! And the long wait is, unfortunately, real. We waited for an hour and a half for a table for two on Êa Friday night, but it was WELL worth it. The place looks small from the outside, and there is a little bar area by the door with some chairs to help with the long wait. But once we got seat inside the place was a lot bigger. There are glass windows to the kitchen so you can see exactly what the chefs are doing. The lighting was dim and the decor was not at all tacky. +One star! Our waitress was super adorable and friendly in her "I heart Ramen" shirt, she took our order so promptly and never let our water glasses go more than half empty. +One star! We ordered the Pork Buns. And let me tell you, it was heavenly. The bun was moist and soft, but the PORK! Oh the pork, was so fatty and delicious, coupled with that slightly spicy mayo, oh so good. I just wish they were bigger! I gobbled that bun down in 4 bites.+Two stars! Next, the original ramen. The noodles were pretty average, but it was the broth that made the meal totally amazing. Every sip is packed with intense, rich, meaty, pork flavor. Incredible. +One star! Yay five stars! The bill came out to around 70ish for two. Which, for any other ramen place, I would say is pretty expensive. But Ippudo is worth the money. I will definitely be back very soon to convert my non-ramen lover friends. See you there!

You can't go wrong with a bowl of Akamaru Modern and a side of Hirata buns. After enduring what might seem like the longest wait you'll ever wait for food, you'll be seated with Êwarm welcomes from all the employees in the restaurant. First of all, before you do anything else, you MUST try the pork buns. These pork buns must have been blessed by the gods or something, because they're absolutely delicious. As for the ramen, anything you order will be ensued by deliciousness. Also, they serve the ramen to you in these funny-shaped bowls, which make it all the more appealing. And if you just so happen to still be hungry after your bowl, they offer ramen refills for only $2. Nothing tops off an amazing dinner like dessert. Although their portions may be a bit small, you should not leave without trying the green tea crme brle or the tofu sorbet. Definitely one of the best, if not THE best Japanese ramen noodle restaurant. In case you want to avoid the long lines, Ippudo opens for dinner at 5PM and for lunch at 11 AM.

Color me impressed. I went to Tokyo two months prior to visiting Ippudo, so yes, I had high expectations as everyone was calling this the best ramen in the States. But like everyone reassured me, Ippudo lived up to them. We showed up around noon shortly after they opened so we basically didn't have to wait. I ordered the Akamaru Modern which was more than filling. The broth was super rich and tasty, and the ramen was chewy and soft. So good. I love how they greet everyone who comes in so that it's true to the culture. Luckily I didn't have to battle a 2-hr wait time, but I recommend coming in even numbers (best to come in a pair), since a lot of their seating is for 2 people.

First impression when I walked in was...wow this is a very ritzy ramen-ya! Putting aside the glorified setting, most everything else...and MOST importantly, the broth was the real deal. The tonkotsu base was rich, strong and...super fatty! yum.That is exactly what makes a good base.The noodles themselves were not especially great, but bathed in the broth--just fantastic. We got the pork buns and chicken wings as sides. Good stuff, but to be honest not that special. Next time around I think I'll do straight ramen and then get a refill on the noodles!

To put it simply, -Order the ramen and pork buns, especially if it's your first time. -Although the wait is usually around an hour, there's a bar. You can order drinks and even order pork buns as you wait. -They don't take reservations and since they're always busy, they'll be rushing you out if you're just sitting and talking. -I had the special of the day (they change everyday) similar to the main miso soup ramen (sorry i don't recall the name). *i strongly encourage asking your waiter/waitress what their opinions are for the ramen! I gave Ippudo four stars because i thought the decor made up for any problems i had. (definitely picture-taking worthy!) They do have tables for larger groups (maybe fits around 7). Tip: Have someone from your party get there early and to give them your name. Make sure they're a pretty patient person, it's a long wait.

I thoroughly enjoyed every part of my meal. The noodles were cooked perfectly - not too soggy and not too al dente. I got the Shiromaru Hakata Classic with extra egg. The portion was not gargantuan, but enough to satisfy my stomach after not eating for 8 hours during my delayed flight. My favorite part of the meal were the pork belly buns.

I'm sorry Totto, I cheated on you. I went for the richer, fuller model today, and while you'll always have my heart and soul, Ippudo has my tummy. To put it plainly, this slut does it better. The rich, spicy, salty in the Karaka Men was so flavorful and delicious I nearly embarrassed myself by trying to slurp from the bowl, pouring much of it in my lap - thankfully, my pants are clean and when I got home, I had a little treat before throwing them into the laundry (joke... This is a joke...) The noodles were quite thin and had the perfect texture of combination of al dente and chewy.

Dear Ippudo, Why do you insist on not doing takeout? I would eat your hearty, tasty ramen more often if I didn't have to suffer through waiting in line. I understand though, you're very concerned that takeout will diminish the quality of your product. You like me to eat your ramen piping hot, just after it's served from the kitchen. I remember the time our waiter was concerned that my friend wasn't at the table when his ramen was served. Don't worry, he was back just a few minutes later, and the ramen was still hot and delicious. Despite this, you remain my fave ramen spot in NYC - or the entire USA for that matter! Only ramen in Japan can compare to you, and it's no surprise since you're from Japan too. How can I not love a place that has Sapporo on tap? That's not easy to find in New York City! And half price at the bar during happy hour? It's like heaven. Sapporo on tap is the perfect complement to your yummy ramens. You don't even need to give me a menu, I already know what I'm going to order when I sit down. Hakata pork buns to start, shisito peppers (if I'm hungrier than normal) and an Akamaru modern ramen. The Hirata pork buns remind me of the Chinese Peking duck buns I love, but better! Both the pork and chicken are good, although my obsession with pork belly makes me partial to the pork. What really makes this dish though is the sauce. It's spicy and flavorful and you get just enough on the bun. Simply divine! I'll admit, I was hesitant to try the shishito peppers at first. I'm a spice wimp and I thought these would spicier than I could handle. Reluctantly, I agreed to share this with a friend and I'm sure glad she convinced me! The peppers are only mildly hot, but they are deep-fried goodness! With a little sourness from the lemon and a touch of that amazing yuzu salt, these peppers are a wonderful treat. I can't describe how excited I get when I see the red bowl with your Akamaru Modern ramen heading to my table. Your other ramens are good, but the Akamaru Modern is superb. I love knowing that the noodles are made fresh, I've seen the guy making them in the little room downstairs. The broth is rich, almost decadent, and the miso adds a nice depth of flavor that I just LOVE. I have never failed to finish every last drop of the complex and flavorful broth. I have loved the Akamaru Modern since my first visit here and I still love it now, even after you reformulated it last year. I guess if you continue to refuse to do takeout, I'll have to just deal with the lines. Or if I can ever bring myself to come here and not order ramen, you might see me grabbing a beer and some appetizers at the bar.

4.5 out of 5 actually. ÊI wasn't too blown away when I first had Ippudo. Don't get me wrong, the place is modern, the food is excellent, but the only reason why it doesn't get a perfect score is the hype and slightly pricey menu. You won't regret the AKAMARU MODERN RAMEN and the PORK BUNS - trust me! Nothing thrills me more than seeing the boiled egg in my ramen ooze thick yellow yolk goodness. The noodles are authentic and very much al dente. And those pork buns?! - White pillow fluffy goodness with a heart attack pork center.

The Ramen: Pretty awesome. ÊIt's clean, light but full of flavor. ÊI'd recommend getting the egg instead of the pork belly as an add-on. ÊThe pork belly seemed to overpower delicious broth. The appetizers: Very well presented, but very mediocre. The ambiance: The nicest group of human beings I've ever encountered. ÊIf I was having Êa bad day, I would go here to eat just to see the happy wait staff. The Decor: Absolutely amazing. ÊIt's inspired me to do certain things with my own house. The Price: About right. Ê2 bowls of ramen and 2 appetizers will run you about $25 a head.

After Momofoku disappointed me, I was a bit skeptical about this ramen craze going on in NYC. ÊI must say, however, that Ippudo is THE best ramen I've ever had. Totally worth the wait. ÊI arrived around 7pm on a Wed night and the wait wasn't too bad - about 45 mins. ÊI expected it to be a cramped little Japanese restaurant after seeing the crowd of people waiting outside, but it's actually really nice and chic inside! ÊThere are large booths along the side of the wall and big long tables in the middle, so the seating is definitely more comfortable than the cramped little Momofoku! Ê I had already decided on the spicy tonkatsu ramen, but when the waitress came, she recommended the special anniversary ramen only available the month of April. Ê(Also funny because she says "I'm not recommending it b/c it's more expensive!!) But I figured I can try the Spicy tonkatsu another time and got the anniversary special. ÊThe broth is TO DIE FOR!! ÊIt's the yummiest and most flavorful ramen broth I've ever had. ÊI wasn't even that hungry but I didn't leave a drop of soup in my bowl. ÊThe noodles are really thin and not as chewy as Momofoku, but still very enjoyable. Ê So if you come this month, I'd definitely recommend their anniversary special! ÊIt's $15 for a bowl of ramen, but it is REALLY the best ramen ever! ÊI definitely have to make another trip back this month before it's too late!!

Whenever I have friends in town, I always recommend this restaurant. Best ramen I've ever had and keep in mind that it's the only place my one Japanese friend will go to for ramen. The wait is always long but so worth it. If you get impatient you can go to Saint Alp Teahouse on 3rd to pass some time. I get the Akamaru Modern, I've tried other ones but this is what I always come back to. I've had a few of their appetizers but none of them were as memorable.

We had a nice casual lunch at Ippudo in October 2009. From everything I read, it seemed like you could wait a while there. We arrived around 11:30 and got lucky, I think. When we left the restaurant, it was wall to wall with people waiting. Of course, we had to start with the Hirata pork buns. Anything with luscious, fatty pork is probably going to be a winner with us, and these were no exception. The texture of the bun itself is almost like a sponge. That sounds really unfortunate when in fact it is quite tasty. I could see myself eating about 20 of these in one sitting given the opportunity. Afraid we would covet the other's dish, we un-creatively both ordered the Akamaru Ramen. Now, we may have ramen like that here in Austin, but I haven't found it yet. Suffice it to say, these are not the ramen I made in my college dorm room with a hot plate. A flavorful broth, noodles with a firm but not crunchy consistency plus, it included more delicious pork. What's not to love? The price point seemed a little bit high to me (around $45 for our meal and two drinks), but my husband wasn't about to complain, since it was pretty much the cheapest meal we had in New York. : )

I went to Ippudo the first week it opened, and I've been going there pretty regularly ever since, because visitors from out of town asked me to take them there. ÊThey've been hearing how great it is, and they wanted to find out for themselves. Ê But every time I visited, I realized how the taste of soup has changed drastically since it has opened. ÊInitially, I really liked the richness of soup of Akamaru Modern, but I've started to notice, it's gotten saltier every time I visited. ÊPlus, the portion of Pork belly with poached egg has gotten smaller and smaller, but I believe the price of the Pork belly has gone up a dollar or two. ÊNow, I think it's complete waste of money to order this dish. ÊAlso, they offer 3 piece Chicken wings for 7 dollars, but I don't think it comes any closer to tasty Boka Chicken which is around the area. Ê I would like to give 2 and half star for this, but the atmosphere of the restaurant that gives another half star. ÊIf you're bringing a friend who has never been to Ippudo, they will like it, but for locals like me wouldn't recommend it. ÊI'd say take a little walk down to Menkui Tei which has more variety of Ramen with more balanced soup. ÊOr visit Boka for its tasty chicken which is also around the area.

Great ramen; pescatarian/vegetarian friendly. Had charred squid to start, veggie ramen bowl. Really fantastic. Good service. Expect to wait unless you are a solo diner, as I was. Even on an off-night at a weird time, you can wait 45 minutes. It's very popular.

I'll admit it, I've been lured in by the current ramen trend. I can't say I've tried them all, but I have tried the major ones - D. Chang, you were my first; Minca / Kambi, you're my potential true love; Ippudo, you're the pretty one who never disappoints but it's also just not the right fit. I've now been here twice and sampled the pork belly app, the pork buns, the spicy shrimp app, the tea-steeped pork slices and the regular and spicy ramen. All presented extraordinarily, all tasted lovely, but none made me go "ahhhhh..." however, i do love the decor and the crazy japanese service. overall? ippudo is a good date place if your date likes pretty things, but for the real deal, keep looking.

FOOD: This is the place for your ultimate ramen fix. Their savory, tasty broth goes soooo well the al dente, thin straight noodle. Apps: PORK BELLY...trust me.

I'm so grateful for the ramen craze and Ippudo is the leader of the pack. The pork bun appetizer I had was incredibly delicious with a salty/sweet knockout flavor and the main event - the ramen - is the best I've ever had. The wait is sizable, but knowing that you are going to have one of the best gastronomic events of your life makes it fun and there is so much to look at around you - a playful restaurant layout, art and pottery on the walls, instant ramen noodles under glass... When I was in Vancouver this winter I went to a world-class ramen joint. I read the review for the place (which is on the other side of the continent and in another country) and it said that although it is the best in Vancouver it doesn't compare to Ippudo in New York. I'm not making that up. If you are hooked on noodles, I recommend watching "Tampopo" (a zany film about Ramen) and waiting in line at Ippudo. They're open until 11.

Based on most of the reviews already, you already know the food is amazing; possibly one of the best ramen joints with the trendiness factor.

I don't know what the hype over Ippudo is. I came here because it was featured on "The Best Thing I Ever Ate." The Akamaru Modern ramen was ok but I thought $17 was a little much even though it came with salad and a side. I've had much better ramen at cheaper prices. Also, the decor was really trendy but I expected something more authentic and traditional for a ramen place.

This was my first foray into Ramen beyond having Oodles of Noodles as a kid(do they still make those? 8 for a buck at Shoprite?). I was in love with their extra spicy broth! ÊIt was the 2 hour wait(!?!) on a Tuesday night, albeit a table for 8 doesn't come along that often. ÊI am trying it again to see if it is more reasonable with a party of 2 or 4. ÊI normally would NEVER EVER wait that long to eat anything, I don't care how good it is...but because I was with friends and hanging at a bar first, it wasn't as bad. Like others say, the atmosphere is very cool. ÊWaiters are definitely multitasking tables all night. ÊFood came fairly quickly. ÊWe ordered the following: Shrimp and pork foldover sandwiches(not sure what they were called). ÊShrimp and asparagus with noodles(some sort of salad). Cold sake(I'm not a fan of sake period) And then, the ramen...the noodles were delicious, and like I said, I was all about the broth - I would warn you that to order it extra-spicy is not THAT spicy for West Coasters who may be used to hot Thai food or Authentic Mexican. ÊHowever it was definitely spicy! ÊBut not inedible - it was delicious! ÊMy only issue with the ramen was that there was not enough veggies/meat in the broth - next time I will be ordering extra so I get my fill of protein/veggies and not feel guilty for eating a bowl of carbs! All in all, I'm curious to explore the world of Ramen, but this one was delicious! I would recommend - and certainly the earlier you get there(ie before 7pm), the shorter your wait would be...

Having just spent two weeks in Japan and eating some of the best Ramen on the planet, including two stops at the original Ippudo's in Hakata, I have to say I was very disappointed with the local version. Not only am I an avid Ramen eater, but I've been coming to Ippudo in NY since it first opened. Not sure if I'm imagining it, but I feel the place has changed. The hosts were very cold and unwelcoming and had us wait for an hour and a half, which is typical, but it was not a busy night. Once our table was ready we walked into the main room only to realize that the place had plenty of open seats. We got ushered to the room just off the main room where there were even more empty tables. Why had we waited an hour and a half when there were so many empty spots? After taking a better look we realized that the main room was filled with many Japanese guests and our room was only occupied with American guests. I have to say that we started to feel quite offended. Although the food came out quite quickly, it lacked the distinct qualities I have come to know and love from Ippudo. We both had the Classic Ramen which is always been a solid choice, but this time the pork was very dry and seemed overcooked. The waiters didn't pay too much attention to us and as we were leaving we noticed the couple sitting next to us (also American) seemed to be feeling quite neglected as well. I hate to believe that we were discriminated upon, especially at one of my favorite restaurants in NY, but I have to say that it was quite obvious. Shame on you Ippudo. You're better off staying in Japan where the food and the staff are much more authentic. Sayonara suckers.

Update on this review: I should really take a photo of myself eating the pork belly mum and sent it to my mom. She's been making pork belly buns all these years and could never get me to sink my teeth into the fatty pork. But now that i'm away from home I'm actually excited to find pork belly buns. It's goood. Try it. Ippudo..once I've tasted it I can never go back to just any other bowl of ramen. All these years I've been eating sub-standard ramen, I know the real thing is out there somewhere and I've finally found it. In order to avoid the atrocious lines at peak hours, we came in at a little past 11am, and was seated right away. It's my first time here and I always order the most basic item on the menu to test it out. And since my friend Yuki ordered the classic ramen, it's always safe to follow the Japanese. Soon a steaming bowl of ramen was sitting in front of us. It looks really plain and I took a sip of the broth. It was an instant explosion of the pork flavor. There are only two ramen shops that I ever loved in my life and I noticed the thing about good ramen is that you'll keep wanting another bite, even if you are full. Soon Yuki was expertly slurping away at her noodles...I don't know how she can do it without burning her lips. I'm still working on it. But in between slurps she confirmed that it was about the same standard in Japan. Back to the noodles I loved the springy texture and the rich broth . I'm usually not a soup person but I certainly drank a lot of that soup. I loved the chashu that simply melts in my mouth. It's the best pork-based ramen I've had up to this point. Now that I've found a favorite for chicken based and pork based ramen...time for me to search for a favorite shoyu ramen. mmmm

My gf MH raves about this place so we made a point to arrive early to score a huge table for our group. We started with the Hirata Buns (2 for $8) which are steamed buns (clam shell shaped) filled with pork or chicken (we chose pork) in a spicy creamy sauce. Pricey but delicious! We came for ramen so ramen we ate. Most of us went with the Akamaru Modern Ramen ($13 a la carte). This hosts the 'original tonkotsu' soup noodle with Ippudo's special sauce, pork belly chashu (1 piece), cabbage, kikurage, scallions, miso paste & fragrant garlic oil. The ramen itself is made with somen noodles rather than egg noodles. It gave the ramen a lighter feel because of the rice noodle texture. The broth was quite good actually. Light miso flavor, sweet chicken broth and whatever secret ingredients that added. The toppings were a little light - meaning the one piece of chashu was deliciously buttery but there was only ONE piece. Definitely order the bowl with extra chashu. For the greedy folks, we opted for the Lunch Set ($16): Ramen + mini salad + rice bowl (4 choices: Mentaiko (spicy cod roe), Roast pork, Fried chicken, or Grilled eel). ÊI chose the eel. I had 2 bite size pieces on top of a lot of rice. It wasn't worth it. The chicken or pork is a better deal, but really, it's just a bowl of rice. Probably better off with another hirata bun. Liked the decor, modern feel which stands slightly contradictory to my imaginings of ramen bars. But would I wait an hour, no way. Because we were able to score a table early, I felt like I had a great experience. Oh one note: they don't allow you to take home leftovers. We had an extra Hirata Bun and they wouldn't let us take it out. Seriously? We had to sneak it into a napkin and then into a purse. Really, let people take home leftovers! Other than that, great place.

So far, I've tried the "best" ramen of two major cities in the country. Katana-Ya in San Francisco and now, Ippudo in New York. In this battle, East coast is in the lead. BUT, I have yet to try the famed Daikokuya in Los Angeles, so until then, the verdict is out. I got the special ramen of the night, pictured above. I forget the details but it was topped with garlic toast, which was surprising, in the best way possible. It was perfumed immensely with garlic, which I die for since garlic is what I live for! The broth was rich and velvety and had great flavor. I most often enjoy my ramen at hole-in-the-walls but surprisingly when I walked into Ipuddo, I was semi-shocked to see a hip, trendy restaurant. I was happy that the ramen delivered in taste and tradition. Everyone else's ramen was thoroughly enjoyed as well, my sister had this spicy one (which I forget the name of now) that she died for. Since it was my birthday, they also threw in a complimentary dessert; we chose the green tea ice cream with mascarpone. It was a perfect ending to the meal: delicate, light and delicious. I love anything green tea so it won me over just with its name.

Went here yesterday, right at opening on Sunday.. Only waited for 5 minutes, which I was happy about, after hearing of people waiting for nearly hours to get in. Once I walked into the dining room, the whole staff, including the chefs at the open kitchen, shout at you, as a greeting (or who knows, maybe they are cursing at us all along?), in Japanese.. We sat at a Rectangular table, similar to one you would find at a Hibachi restaurant, just without the grill. On to the food.. We started off with Hirata Pork Buns. Best in the city, no doubt. A little bit more pricey, as it is $8 for 2 small buns, but believe me it is worth it. ÊPork was of superb quality and the accompanying sauce was too good. Fortunately, and unlike many other places, the inner ingredients actually stay inside the bun, easily. Not too sure what the bun was made out of though, still wondering.. After that, we had Wagyu beef nagajaku(sp?). Square cut pieces of beef, in a broth, with potatoes and other vegetables. The flavor was familiar, but I could not actually pin point what it tasted like. It was good, but I do not think I would order it again. I chose to side with the Shiomaru Moto Sji Spicy Ramen. The broth was thick, flavorful, spicy.. It was truly amazing. At $13 bucks, it was a good deal, considering the amount of ramen you get. However, it was pretty hard, at least for me, to finish it. Leaves you full.. Once we left, we noticed a huge line in the front, almost out the door, with the waiting time for 2 being at 1 hour and 15 mins. And this was at about 1: 25, nearly only an hour after opening. ..Oh yeah, don't be turned off by the heaps of Japanese men and women slurping their ramen down, it's the polite way to do it..

Whenever I tell people I'm crazy about a $13 bowl of ramen, they don't seem to understand how that can be possible. ÊMost likely because ramen typically brings 5/$1 packets of dried noodles to mind. ÊThis, of course, is only distantly related to that ubiquitous instant meal. ÊSavory, complex, attention-absorbing from the first chopstick-full of noodles to the last sip. All the soups are delicious, so give any a try. ÊBe sure to splurge on an order of extra pork slices... you'll be glad you did. ÊThe appetizers are also amazing, so you'll want to try one or two. ÊPork buns and deep fried peppers have been my favorites. Go for lunch or very early dinner (5:00-ish) if you want to beat the long waits.

ÊThat's 12 buns! - Spicy Ramen (i don't recall the exact name, but there's only one spicy ramen on the menu) is AMAZING. ÊI will come back here for this. ÊBroth is thick and spicy, and the soup is just perfect. We went a bit nuts with appetizers and also ordered a few orders of black cod and bbq ribs. ÊThey're okay but not unique to this place. ÊWe also had shrimp tempura, which is battered in coconut shredding. ÊSo good! But you get very little in each order... like 3 shrimps? I don't recommend the Modern Ramen as the noodle was so thin and the soap base wasn't thick enough. ÊNo one in our group enjoyed it. ÊNext time i visit here, I will order pork buns and spicy ramen, and forget the rest on the menu. Total bill was about $300 for 5 ppl which isn't crazy for the amount of food we ordered :) FYI, they don't let you doggy-bag the leftover. ÊNo exceptions.

Very good bowls of noodles and the cocktail I had was decent, but not outstanding. Really loud in there, though, because the staff scream every time someone enters the dining area and at other random moments. Not as cheap as I expected but a good meal that left me satisfied. We got there around 5:30 and were able to get a seat within 5 minutes, but when we left around 7 the waiting area was packed, so you should go early.

Being a fan of Naruto, i got a craving for some Ramen. Yes, I watch Naruto. And what? Anyway, I've been at Ippudo's front door twice. One I got in, the other I walked away when the hostess said the wait time was over 2 hours. You know you would too! Thats too much time to wait. The time i did go, was during a weekday. I was seated within 15 minutes. I was with a friend and we both were impressd with the food. The ambience is cool and friendly. They clap and cheer when you order more noodles. I'm not sure what they say. But whatever, the point is, the noodles are great and not too pricey. I got the classic noodles with extra pork. IT WAS GOOD! when you go there, remember "Kae-dama" means more noodles. But if you don't finish them, its a sign of dis-respect to the chef. At least that's what I was told.

Ippudo Ramen - I went on opening night and had two bowls of noodles: the Shiromaru and the Akamaru.. Shiromaru is definitely the better of the two. ÊThe soup base is amazing, but its so small! You don't get a lot of noodles, and there are only like 2 pieces of pork (compared to four at Ramen Setagaya) and barely any veggies.. I also had the Pickled Vegetables in Soup .. horrific, 7 bucks for a bowl of pickled flavored liquid with some carrots and other veggies in it.. The most amazing part is the desert, Green Tea Creme Brulee - amazing! I came with a side of vanilla ice cream with strawberries and strawberry glaze drizzled on top. Also - they had me wait for about 45 minutes, but when I went inside - it was half empty!!! Go to Ramen Setagaya instead - lots of bamboo shoots, the salt egg, and the pork, and amazing soup base as well!

6.01.08: I have never been so intrigue and so eye wandering in my life. As I stepped into this place it looked very small a host stand with bar like thing to the right. The bowls on the walls and just the whole front layout was already making me excited. The decor was unique, I couldn't wait till I headed inside for my surprised. As we slowly walked through to the next open area I was like a kid in vegas. Awe at the tree, at the tables, at the walls, at the ceilings, at the art and at the chopstick holders. Each table had its own design. It was different. There was a table that looked like a tree trunk. Another table that look like a bar, and booths that are so big they fit about 9 people. Unfortunately for me I had the plain boring table that looks like a wood bench at the park. Besides the incredible decor of this place the food was good. I still like Shin Sen Gumi in San Gabriel better. But it was the service and the decor that got me saying WOoHoo, 5 stars please! I heard usually this place is packed like crazy, being the lucky duck I am we only waited 5 minutes! Yeah ME! Come here you won't regret it!

Ippudo makes you wit 30 minutes even with reservations which pisses me off but it was worth the weight. It has a very trendy look that almost makes you feel like you're in a lounge although there is a full bar in the front. The ramen might have been the best I have ever had. Yea, it is weird to throw down $20 for a bowl of noodles but when it comes out looking like a ying yang sign, separating the soup and the soy sauce in the bowl, you have to pay a premium for the artistry. The broth was strong with a hint of garlic oil and the noodles were thin and perfectly chewy. My side of pork belly was a little disappointing considering my high expectations but nonetheless good. Beware, a bowl of this stuff will put you in a coma.

Went here for lunch on a Sunday, around 1130am. We didn't have to wait, since they opened 30 minutes ago, and got seated by the bar. At $13/ bowl, I think it's pricey for ramen; but, the noodles are fresh, and the broth is excellent. It's a decently-sized bowl which will leave you satisfied, but not stuffed. My boyfriend ordered the Akamaru Modern, and I ordered the Miso Ramen-- both excellent, but not mind-blowing. plus, the noodles taste fresh and chewy, not frozen or tough. For some reason, my noodles were thinner than my boyfriend's, but they both tasted the same...? This place is not vegetarian friendly for you strict vegetarians-- the broths are pork/ meat based and without meat in your ramen, there's not much else besides broth and noodles. (minus 1 star....) The decor is definitely trendy and contributes to the overall ramen-experience, and the service is fair. Oh, and they don't serve alcohol until after 12 pm. So: 4 stars for food, quality; minus 1 star for price.

I went to Ippudo twice over the weekend because friends were craving ramen. I tried the Shiomaru, which along with the Akamaru are Ippudo's signature ramen. Shiomaru is the original recipe and smoother than the Akamaru. The Akamaru has a more complex flavor and seaweed in the broth. I tried the Shoyu ramen today. The soy sauce soup is mixed with the ton kotsu soup. I liked it. I felt like the portion size was was a little smaller than the ton kotsu ramen. We also tried the avocado and tofu tartare, which was absolutely delicious. It sat on a bed of agar agar noodles and comes with two sauces. One is peanut based and the other is soy-sauce/honey tasting. For dessert we had the annin tofu (almond tofu). Very creamy tofu paired with fresh fruit. We were stuffed.

After hearing rave reviews about this place (the ones in Japan), my friend from Japan and I went there for dinner. There was a long wait and based on ramen I had at other places like Sapporo and Momofuku, this wasn't as good as I thought. ÊAnd my friend from Japan told me that although things taste almost the same, it wasn't as good as what he had. I will try this place once or twice more to see if I would recommend to others but as of yet, the wait isn't worth it.

4 stars for food, 5 stars for service, 1 star for THE WAIT = 4 stars overall This place has GREAT ramen. ÊThe noodles are fresh, the broth is very flavorful, and all the extra sides and fixings add to the quality of the meal. ÊThey have a few options for Ramen combinations and I was very full afterwards. The servers are very attentive and take great pride in their food and presentation. ÊWhen my water was half full, they immediately refilled. ÊThey knew exactly when our orders were coming out and let us know that we should anticipate our ramen in the next couple minutes. ÊAfter fnishing our udon, and they let us enjoy the remainder of our meal and did not rush us even though it was beginning lunch rush-hour. Ê The difficult part with Ippudo is the wait to be seated... ÊIts a very popular restaurant and the first time I attempted to eat here for dinner I was told it was a 1.5-2 hour wait! ÊI finally gave up on having dinner and resorted to having lunch.... Êwhich was still great! Ê I look forward to when I have time to make it to Astor Place again for some yummy Ramen!

So after all of the hype, all of the stories of the long waits, I was finally able to make it there on a Monday night...and only a 45 min wait for 2. ÊSo we got the pork buns...and they were definitely good, but I'm not sure if they were above and beyond what a good Chinese/Japanese restaurant would have. ÊThe beef tendon was above average but not anything special. Ê Next I got the classic ramen, and I will say it was good, but it wasn't as incredible as I thought it'd be. ÊI'm not sure if it really commands the $13 premium...maybe $10, but not $13. ÊSo overall this place is very good, but when you combine a long wait with high prices, I need something incredible if it's going to get that 5th star from me.

Average. I hate how ramen places feel the need to cook even their VEGETARIAN ramen in PORK broth. How does that even make any sense? I'm not even vegeterian, but I don't eat pork, so I couldn't even enjoy the spicy chicken ramen I spotted on the menu. After all of the hassle of getting a table at this crowded place, that was a little disappointing. Instead I got the avocado tartar appetizer which was TINY compared to most tartars I've had, and not nearly as good. I'll give them some stars for nice ambiance and a thoughtful staff, and I am sure this is a fabulous place for those who eat anything.

If you're looking for a high energy ramen noodle place this is it. I recommend ordering the pork buns too (I got the chicken ones) and the option on getting another set of noodles when you're half way done with your soup. I liked this place a lot. The sake was served in a wooden box. The bartender was super sweet and cute. The prices were totally reasonable -- $13 for a big bowl.

I confess that up until today, all of the ramen I've eaten came out of a small plastic bag with a satchel of spices and sodium. ÊIf you're looking to taste some REAL ramen, check out Ippudo! ÊStep inside and you'll find a stylish hostess stand complete with an interesting display of ramen bowls hung up on the wall. ÊBut don't let the cozy entranceway fool ya! ÊStep back into the main dining room and you've got a large open space with visibility into the busy kitchen. ÊThe staff was wearing these great, "I Love Ramen" t-shirts, would have loved to have gotten one. ÊDecor ranges from rustic japanese to asian bamboo/characters, they've got several shared tables and some party rooms on a platform. The menu is not huge, you've got a bunch of ramen soups, a nice array of appetizers and a small selection of japanese beers. ÊWe started off with these awesome pork buns! ÊWe're talking spicy, braised pork on a small steamed bun with a bit of lettuce. ÊD-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s! ÊI've had those same buns with peking duck but nice change to do it with pork. ÊThe wings were studded with sesame seeds, a nice rendition. ÊAnd finally, my ramen bowl with slices of berkshire pork and cabbage made for a nice end to the meal. ÊMy ramen was done al dente with a bit of chewiness and salt, yum! ÊPresentation of all the food was playful and well-done. Ê Service was attentive and prompt, major kudos there. ÊFrom what I understand, Ippudo is a ramen chain based out of Japan and this location might be the only one in the US. ÊAnd it shows! ÊThere's a certain feel of Japanese authenticity to the place once you get past the stylish decor. ÊBetween the food, service and ambiance, I highly recommend Ippudo for a nice change of pace and some serious noodle-slurping!

Dining solo to me a very unsatisfying experience. You have no one to share the evening with, you're limited to usually one or two dishes, and frankly you seem lonely and isolated. So when a meal picks you up while you're eating alone, it really is something noteworthy. After poking my head in the door, I got on the waiting list and assumed it would be 45 minutes like the hostess had told other people. But thankfully flying solo has its perks and I got a seat at the counter within 15 minutes! I then proceeded to nosh on the Hirata Chicken wings - perfectly fried, wonderfully crunchy chicken wings that are sweet, sprinkled with black sesame, and served piping hot. They were bloody awesome. I then took down their mainstay - the Shiromaru Hakata Classic ramen. The bowl that comes out is heavy, loaded with broth and noodles, half a boiled egg, and some ginger and green onions. After plowing through the noodles, I asked the waiter for "kaedama" which essentially means, "reload my bowl with noodles." After polishing the bowl off, I took my now loaded belly home and promptly went to bed. If you happen to be guest-less, sit at the counter. Watch them make the food. It makes the food even better.

I had to come here on three separate occasions before I figured out how you actually get seated at this restaurant. ÊIt's actually quite simple - come early (like 6pm) and put your name down. ÊThey'll give you a wait time estimate (on the order of 1-2 hours) but you can pretty much ignore it. ÊIt seems like the restaurant's policy is to let you come back at whatever time you like - even if your name was called 45 minutes ago! Now that said, the waiting experience can be fun. ÊSure the bar area is ridiculously crowded at all times and you likely won't be able to sit down, but the edamame (served with soy salt) makes for delicious bar food, and the cocktails they have are very cool. ÊI strongly recommend the grapefruit juice with shochu, though I think half the fun was juicing my own grapefruit, and that wouldn't have been possible at the crowded bar (I ordered mine when we sat down). When we finally got past the hostess into the restaurant, I was shocked by the mammoth size of the place. ÊThere's really a hell of a lot of space, and the environment is truly authentic Japanese - down to the windowed cooking area, communal tables, and constant shouting by the waiters to welcome EVERY party that gets seated. ÊHonestly, it's a loud place, and it is NOT romantic, which was actually perfect for my catching-up dinner... but I digress. ÊJust don't expect to get any real conversation in at this place. At first we thought the menu was laid out like tapas because there are so many appetizers and so relatively few entree/ramen options. ÊWrong. ÊComing to Ippudo and not ordering a ramen soup entree (~$14) runs against the grain here. ÊHowever I would definitely recommend getting 1-1.5 appetizers per person in addition. ÊShare them - they're amazing! We had the breaded tuna, which was out of this world and definitely my favorite. ÊWe also had the hirata buns, which have a very unique texture and were basically mini chicken sandwiches. ÊThe hirata chicken wings were delicious as well - the meat is very tender and comes right apart in your mouth. And finally the ramen. ÊI had the akamaru modern. ÊDelicious. ÊEspecially the meat, which, like all the meat there, is ridiculously tender. ÊThe broth was very rich and looked to have some cream in it, which scared me as a lactard. ÊYou definitely don't need to heed their suggested add-ins, and they give you plenty of noodles so you probably don't need to save the broth for a refill of noodles ($2). In the end we had each spent ~$55. ÊI guess it all adds up! ÊIt was worth it, definitely, but the myriad inconveniences bring Ippudo down to 4 stars. ÊI certainly will be coming back, but not soon or frequently.

I FREAKING LOVE IPPUDO - and this is a long overdue review -- If you like ramen - this is THE place to go in NYC for a delicious, rich, creamy, expertly seasoned, fragrant, mouth watering ramen. I have order pretty much everything on the ramen menu and while they are all good - I highly recommend ordering Karaka Miso Ramen - the spicy soup is to die for - that and a side of a poached egg and you're ready to go to ramen heaven. Also, dont miss out on the pork buns appetizers - to honest, they are quite expensive $8 for two buns but they are definitely worth it - spicy and delicious. The service at this place is one of the best. The waiters are extremely attentive and very polite. Dont be put off by the ladies at the front who take your reservation Ê- they can be a bit cold and dare i say it - bitchy - but you would be too if you have to field hungry customers nagging you for tables ALL DAY. ADVICE: Êit can very tricky to get a table for dinner - my longest wait (for a party of 2) has been almost 90 minutes - I highly recommend going here for Brunch on the weekends - come at 11 right Êwhen they are open and you are guaranteed to be seated within 10 minutes. I know it's a bit early on the weekend and ramen for brunch sounds odd - but I promise you will not be disappointed.

Not to sound like a snob, but I've had ramen from places in LA/OC, San Francisco, Hawaii and even Tokyo and Ippudo edges ahead the rest as what I would say is the best ramen in the world....yes.....THE WORLD. The Akamaru Modern is their spin on basic Tonkotsu Ramen. ÊAmazing. ÊVery flavor full, I would lick the bowl if I could. ÊI usually don't eat the hard boiled egg in ramen but this packed a whole world of flavor....I've been missing out on that the whole time. Ê One thing I was disappointed about was the Karashi Takana (mustard leaf) add on. ÊI expected it to add a horseradish/wasabi like kick to my ramen but nope, not even close. Ê The Pork Buns are a MUST!!! ÊIts perfection in the form of steamed dough and pork. ÊIf I was Muslim, I would convert so I could eat this. ÊThey were so good, I didn't even want to finish it, I wanted to take it home and cuddle with it for the rest of the night.

Ended up here after a long delayed flight. I was starving and badly needed a drink. My friend and I started at the bar, while waiting to be seated. Our wait wasn't long, but it was close to midnight. The bartender suggested two cocktails - Yuzu and something with tequila. Not a fan of either, though the Yuzu was better. We got the pork buns as an appetizer. Amazing, though I was not prepared for the spicy. The ramen was so good. I've never had ramen at a restaurant before, so I have absolutely no comparison. But I thought it was delicious. For dessert, we split the creme brulee. It was tasty, but I wasn't a huge fan - too much green tea flavor. Service: Attentive without bothering us too much. And they gave us a warning when the kitchen was closing. Environment: I don't think the environment was quite for me. It was still pretty busy even at midnight and there was just too much bustle after such a long day. And I was not a fan of the shouting.

Gotta love this place. The only thing - they don't take reservations. So you have to give them your name, wait your place in line, and hang out at the bar for an hour (or just bounce around the village and come back). ÊSure I think it's a ploy to make you spend a few bucks on a drink, make you hungrier, and get a little tipsy before the meal but it's never a bad scene. Ê The pork belly buns here are probably the best you'll find. ÊThe Ramen...yeah it's all about the noodle. ÊDefinitely good stuff but to be honest it's the decor and atmosphere that makes this place worth the experience. ÊThis place blends modern and traditional textures into a very cool and deliberate look and feel. Compared to other ramen establishments there is no contest Êin the vibe. But if you're hungry and don't want to wait in line for an hour and it's the ramen you're craving- there are a few other places nearby with almost as good of a noodle, but this place has a slight edge better.

Broth is good, but I wasn't entirely satisfied with the noodles. I like my ramen noodles a little thicker and chewier, and the noodles here are of the thinner variety. But admittedly it was a solid bowl of ramen. I got the "special" which included two smallish pieces of garlic bread (!). ÊKind of unexpected and random, but it worked. Though the second piece of bread was overly soggy by the time I got to it, so it was kind of yucksville at that point. The hostess initially tried denying us because we reached the restaurant at 11:25, near it's closing time. She was pretty bitchy about it, until a gentleman who appeared to be of management intervened and let us know that we could stay, and that only ramen would be available. Fine by us, since it's what we came for. So I'd say overall a 3.5 experience. Probably a solid 4 if not treated like bums in the first two minutes.

Yup. The verdict is in. Best ramen I've had in North America. It beats Satouku in Mitsua, which has been my benchmark for ramen. I had the miso ramen (my favorite) with cod roe over rice as a side. My wife had the popular Akamaru. The miso ramen was seriously the best I've had. They claim to use the tonkotsu broth as the base for the miso (actually all their) ramen broth and it really delivers. It's thick yet not too oily (unlike the oily Santouku ramens). It's salty just to the right level. It has a really deep bonestock+miso flavor all mixed in together. Very very impressed. The Akamaru wasn't as good, I thought. But then again, I'm a miso ramen guy. The noodles on Akamaru ramen were thinner, which I didn't like as much as the curly, handmade looking noodles in my miso ramen. Also the place is too fancy and expensive for my taste. I tend to like hole-in-the-wall places more (like Baten Ramen in Fort Lee, NJ with their library of mangas--Japanese comic books). But they are serious about their ramen, and I can let the steep price slide. I would recommend this place to any ramen-manias out there.

1. Be prepared to wait. At 7:30pm on a Friday night, a table for two was quoted to be 45 minutes. We waited for about an hour, but there is a bar inside that makes the wait a little easier (caveat: it's crowded, noisy, and standing room only). 2. Get the pork belly buns ($8 for two). They're served with a spicy red sauce, as well as a dollop of spicy mayo and the combination is addictive. We also ordered a cold appetizer of duck in a balsamic dressing but it was not memorable at all. At the end of the night, we actually skipped dessert in favor of another order of pork belly buns. So much more satisfying than the ones at Momofuku. 3. The Akamaru Modern is delicioussss. You will be blown away when you try the broth and the noodles are the perfect consistency. They might actually be the best ramen noodles I've ever had! Still, my reaction didn't last for too long. The explosive flavor that first shocked my taste buds got old real fast and, after the first four or five bites, all I could taste was salt and fat. Their ramen is too complex to really be considered comfort food yet not quite as transcendent as I thought it'd be either. Still delicious though. 4. The Shoyu broth was less impressive. My boyfriend described it as "ordinary" and too salty, but there was an underlying bitter taste that made it more interesting. 5. Noodle refills. If you save your broth, you can get a refill of noodles for an extra $2! A single bowl plus an appetizer should be more than enough to fill you, but it's nice to see this option. 6. Beautiful decor, and great for groups if you can afford the wait. There are large booths for 6-10 people, as well as some long communal tables. There's an open kitchen, and every time the hostess brings in a new table, all the chefs/waiters/busboys shout to greet them. It's charming, but it gets old real fast. Kind of like how the guys at Cold Stone have to sing everytime they get a tip. Definitely a place to try once, and maybe even return. I did have some complaints about the service. Though everyone was friendly and attentive, it was almost to a fault. They move dishes far too quickly. As soon as one person in the party finishes their portion of an appetizer or puts down their chopsticks, a waiter or busboy swings by to take away the plate. It's a little rude, especially if the other person is still eating, but at least they always ask before they remove anything. Food also comes out very quickly. I'd probably rate this place higher if it weren't for the ridiculous wait, but ultimately I don't think the entire experience is worth more than a 30-minute wait. The food and service is still a ramen house- a chain, at that- and besides, the place might be too loud for my tastes (I'm an old woman at heart).

My fist time at Ippudo and I had such a wonderful experience! I loved everything about it. We came in before the rush (before 7pm) and took advantage of the 2 for1 beer special. Nothing like two ice cold asian beers for $6. When the last person in my party arrived we were greeted by some enthusiastic Japanese chants as we entered the dining area. If that couldn't make you happy to be there then nothing can. We ordered some sake and I love how they pour it in the traditional Japanese custom- may your cup over flow. We skipped the appetizers because as I've heard from fellow yelpers that you can't take anything home with you. I ordered the Karaka Kogashi Miso Ramen which I think is my new favorite soup ever. Spicy, salty, tangy plus noodles and pork belly... HOW COULD YOU GO WRONG? My dates chose the specialty ramen of which I took a taste of and it was delicious as well. I repeat, I love this place. I finished my whole bowl. That is all.

This place is the best ramen you can get. ÊThe broths are just so flavorful and complex. you can tell they take time and effort to make it. ÊMy favorite is Akamaru Modern, then the Miso Ramen. ÊAdd an egg in there, some kakuni as well... BANGING... lol ÊThe appetizers are good, and some of my friends love them, but I'm all about the RAMEN BABY. Êif you must get an appetizer, get the chicken wings, and the pork buns, those seem to be the favorites when we go out. Only down side I would say would be that if you try to eat during prime time hours, you going to wait a long time. So go either during lunch hours, or really late during dinner hours. ÊYou can also try to get there 1/2 an hour before dinner starts, that worked for me once lol. ÊAnother negative would be the feeling of paying $20 bucks for ramen is pretty crazy, but you gotta try it at least once, because its SO GOOD. ÊI visit this place every 2 months or so. TRUST... its good money.

After hearing so much hype about this place, I checked it out to see what all the fuss was about. The soup base is pretty good, the toppings are solid as well, but the noodles aren't as good a quality as the rest of the ingredients. ÊIf you're specializing in noodles, they should be the focus! The menu here is stocked well with appetizers outside the usual fare. ÊAnd it should be noted that the decor is above average for this type of establishment. You could have a similar experience for half the price somewhere else. Pro: Good menu selection, great soup & toppings, decor, Con: Nothing worth the long lines and cost compared with it's competitors, Small portions, noodles not great

Expect a LONG wait. ÊAverage wait for dinner is usually 45 mins (if you're lucky) to 1.5 hrs. ÊTrendy, chic, "can get expensive" kind of ramen place in East Village. ÊThey do NOT take reservations. I usually start out with the Shishito/"deep fried peppers". ÊIt comes with a side salt for dipping. ÊThe peppers are lightly fried, delicious. ÊHirata Buns/"steamed pork or chicken buns" Êare extremely soft and moist. ÊThe meat is flavorful. ÊVery good, but pricey at 2 for $8! NOW - the RAMEN part, you waited over an hour for the ramen so you have to order it RIGHT. ÊGet the Akamura Modern ramen $13 with Chasu Pork (braised pork belly) $3 and Bakudan (spicy paste) $2. ÊThis bad boy will cost you a total of $15 for a bowl of ramen. Ê$15 for a bowl of ramen, are you kidding me?!?! ÊHowever, absolutely delicious. ÊThe broth is rich and flavorful. ÊIt can get a bit salty if you're a broth drinker like me. ÊGood news, if you're a big eater, for $2 extra, they will give you more ramen noodles (kae dama) after you finish your first batch. ÊNot bad. Pros: ÊHome-made ramen, rich broth, trendy decor, friendly staff... I always come back if I'm craving ramen. Cons: Êlong wait, over-rated at times, broth can get salty, pricey

Ippudo was one of my "have to eat" stop when we visited NY last November. Came here during lunch and the line was out the door. The wait time for a party of 6 was about an 1.5 hrs. Good thing I was with other ramen lovers who was willing to wait. To our surprise we only waited 30 minutes. Score! Decor of the place was done well, it has an open feel to it and most of all clean. I also noticed while waiting at the bar that the bar table itself was made up of unbroken top ramen noodles. Cute. We ordered the Shirmp Mayo Sauce, Pork Hirata Buns, Shiromaru Hakata Classic (the best ramen soup ever), Wasabi Shoyu Ramen (it got saltier the more I ate it), and Akamaru Modern.. Everything was delicious. Ippudo has won its way into our heart and stomach. Now only if I can find something similar at home..

I came in a party of three to eat here at around 9pm, and we had to wait almost 2 hours just to be seated. That was what first irritated me about this place. This place is not worth the wait. Here is why: 1) The noodles aren't even the right thickness to be called ramen -- they looked more like Chinese egg noodles than ramen. 2) This bowl (shiromaru) cost $13, yet the serving size of the actual noodles was relatively small compared to the size of the bowl, and I got one (yes, ONE) small piece of pork. I felt so insulted just looking into my bowl that I kept on fishing my chopsticks into my soup to see if another piece of pork was hiding somewhere at the bottom. In the end, my chopsticks were very sad. Nothing at the bottom. This is what upset me the MOST. 3) The service was very strange. A person in my party asked what the "secret sauce" (that's what it says on the menu) in one of the ramen dishes tasted like. The server said, "I can't tell you. It's a secret." He then asked her what it TASTED like, not what the ingredients were. Her response? "Stickers." And in the table that we had to share (yes, you share tables here) with another party, she kept on bending down to speak to them even though she could speak to them normally standing up like she did with us. Their food somehow seemed to be coming out faster than ours was, and they came later than us. Part of us thought it was discrimination because their party was White and our party was all Asian, but maybe that's just us being paranoid. 4) The hostess at the door had an air to her that made it seem like we should be honored to eat here. Our wait time actually increased from what she originally said (45 minutes) over the span of almost 2 hours. No, we're really not. 5) The table right by the open kitchen that has glass separating the kitchen from the seating area is awful. My boyfriend was sitting with his back facing that piece of glass, and he was heating up! Ê ÊThis place is a lot more about coming here to be seen rather than coming here to eat some good, rich ramen when you have cravings. It's a very trendy place and is outfitted that way, but overall, not a place to go if you're just looking for good food. I will say, though, that the shiromaru broth (the first one on the menu) is very rich and satisfying, so that's what increases my star rating from one to two. I don't know of another ramen place in the city that makes broth this good.

Return trip! Ê Was here last night. Ê Get all the appetizers and non-ramen items too !!!!!!!!! ÊScrumptilescently delicious. At the bar: ÊOpen-faced siopao (steamed meat buns but almost like in a taco format) that had barbecued pork and lettuce in it. They come in sets of 3. ÊI forget the name of the dish. ÊAlso try their green chili peppers with sea salt. ÊOur Japanese friend (different from the one in my last review) said this is typical Japanese bar food.

No clear broths here. ÊYou may want to try Ramen Setagaya for that. ÊI'm tempted to give Ippudo another star. ÊI'm glad the broth wasn't as heavy this time around. ÊMore flavorful and complex than I could ever imagine.

If Ippudo was a little bit cheaper, I'd be here all the time. The ramen is good, and probably the best that Manhattan has to offer at this point--believe the buzz. ÊI personally still like Setagaya better, as it doesn't sit as heavy as Ippudo's offerings, but if you want rich and heavy, Ippudo is what you want. ÊTonkotsu ramen can too often be stinky from all the porkiness (and I know you're thinking, "That's a bad thing?" but trust me, there is such thing as stinky porky-smelling broth that ain't delish-smelling) but Ippudo's ramen is surprisingly stench-free. ÊAnd while I rarely drink the broth from ramen because of the general saltiness, I almost always finish the broth when I come here... it's even more satisfying than the noodles themselves. Purists and newbies, stick to the shiromaru. ÊHeat seekers, go for the Akamaru. ÊYou can't go wrong here by playing it safe and sticking to the two classics. ÊApps are overpriced for the teeny tiny portions, and the ramen itself is filling already (gut-busting if you come here for the lunch specials, which come with an additional rice bowl).

For Tokyo standards, it's 3-stars but for Stateside ranks, it gets a 5, or more like a 4.872. ÊThe egg was overcooked with the gray lining of the yolk. ÊThe handmade noodles were cooked to perfect al-dente standards that kept the chewiness intact. ÊFor the shiromaru, the noodle portions are minimal at best, only two slices of the berkshire pork make prices steep but since there are not many places that can pull off a good bowl of ramen, enjoy it with each noodle-slurp. ÊAnd the after-meal tea is a nice ending. Just come early to avoid the long wait.

Good spot, young and hip with freshly made ramen. the soup bases are good and you can always ask for more ramen if you have enough soup left in your bowl. wish they had more choices on their menu, like different broth. Try to beat the crowd because the wait can be as long as 1 hr and there isn't really a place for you to sit Êby the semi-minibar. They also close early during lunch time if they ran out of broth. -1: no waiting area, a bit expensive.

Having heard so much about Ippudo as THE PLACE to go in NYC for ramen, I was definitely psyched. Although I'd normally prefer not to start off my day w/ such a heavy meal, it beats waiting an hour in line for Ippudo. So, there we were @11am, getting seated for our Ippudo experience. ÊAs we approached into the dining area, we received loud, warm greeting from the staff in Japanese. My ramen met my expectation, which was pretty high... The broth simmered w/ pork bone was thick and tasty, and topped w/ thinly sliced scallions. ÊThe noodles were thin and chewy. ÊThe Chai Shui (Chinese bbq pork) tasted heavenly - braised Chinese pork belly slices cooked to perfect that melt in your mouth. While I did enjoy Ippudo, I'm still unsure whether I'd crave for it, esp if it entails the typical hr+ wait.

Yes while everyone raves that this is the best ramen in NYC, With the prices they serve they better be, but it only makes me wish for Japan Êramen more. At least the ramen is cheaper, and tastier. But if I am to be at NYC, then this is a substitute I must go. I have finally got the chance to eat here one night before another party I went there, and was surprisingly the first person on line. The place at 5pm, like other places at St. Marks, for the dinner rush. I knew, and yes within the time I was there, the place filled up. I was there today around 6pm as well, but the wait proved longer than what my friend and I were willing to wait. So my advice is GO EARLY! I heard from people, that by the time it is 7PM, the place is like just waiting to be served.. Ê Oh back to my first time, the soup was all right. I liked how chewy the ramen was. I had a a dish with Tonkatsu, and was recommended by the waiter to being a good starter dish to enjoy the first of Ipudo's many ramen dishes. If you have soup left over, you can order another helping of noodles. So I have been hankering for ramen lately, so I will be going sooner or later.

Delicious, as always. We took a NYC local here who was convinced that we would not be able to get in. (Also I find it strange that we DC-area folks had to convince a native to come here). It was a Thursday, 5:30pm, and we got in straightaway. I don't think any food is worth waiting 2 hours for, so as long as we visit New York, we'll continue to try to get here at an off-peak time like 5 or 5:30pm Monday-Thursday. Not even gonna touch it Friday-Sunday. We ordered hirata buns, miso, shoyu, and a daily special "spicy" ramen. Two thumbs up! Also, if you like Reisling or dessert wines, the Kokuto 'Brown Sugar' Plum Wine is one I usually order.

Not too bad. The wait wasn't that bad, 45 minutes for a party of 4 on a Thursday night around 7.30pm. ÊThere are some interesting cocktail options at the bar by the waiting area and the installation of ramen bowls on the wall behind the bar is interesting to look at while you wait. The restaurant inside is very cavernous and dark. ÊThere is bar seating but from what I recall, it's not bar seating that faces into the kitchen (which would've been nicer). The appetizers are tasty but the portions are tiny. ÊThe fried chicken wing and braised pork belly are all delicious, but for a party of 4, there was just enough for each person to have 1 wing and 1 bite (literally) of the pork belly. Contrastingly, the portion size for the noodles is substantial. ÊThe broth is very tasty. ÊThe noodles itself is kinda springy and has a certain aftertaste/flavor to it that somehow reminds me of wonton noodles (is that sacrilegious?!). There is very little accompaniments to the noodles, just some strips of black wood-ear fungus for texture contrast and 1 slice of braised pork. ÊI hear from them that eggs will be added once the restaurant is officially opened (by now it should be). Ê But overall, it was a pleasant bowl of food to eat. I wouldn't say it is the ramen of the century, but definitely a good contender.

A self-proclaimed Ramen Enthusiast, having sampled my fair share of ramen-yas all over Tokyo, I've long been disappointed in NYC's ramen selection. ÊHow can such a big city with so many people fail so many times at matching the exquisite flavor and texture of such a popular Chinese-turned-Japanese dish? When I heard that Hakata Ippudo was coming into town, I was excited. ÊI rounded up a fellow Tokyo Study Abroader and we headed over on day 2 of business, put in our names and whiled away the 1.5 hour wait at a bar down the street. Ê When we got inside, I was immediately impressed by the decor (my favorite highlights: paintings reproduced in colored grains of rice in the bathroom, a window into the noodle-making station downstairs, the wall behind the bar decorated with ramen bowls, and the space under the bar's glass-top lined with instant ramen cakes). ÊVery, very slick interior design. The menu was a bit of a disappointment, with only a few ramen options and limited appetizer choices (most of which were odd fusion-type things). ÊI went for the safe option and chose the standard Tonkotsu miso (Shiomaru) while my friend got the House Special Tonkotsu (Akamaru -- they add a special secret ingredient to the broth). ÊWhen the bowls arrived, I was a little disappointed by the toppings, too, since all I saw was a couple of thin thin thin slices of char siu (pork), some green onions and some seaweed, and the noodles were all hidden beneath the broth. ÊI think it was more that the bowl was way bigger than a normal bowl than that the noodle portion was smaller than usual, but it still gave the impression that I was getting a little ripped off for $13. Ê However, upon actually tasting the stuff, I must say I was impressed. ÊMy friend didn't like the saltiness, but I'm used to it. ÊRamen is synonymous with salt in Japan (after 1 hour you'll be needing water, pronto). ÊI was impressed that they seemed to have gotten the broth down better than any of the other NYC ramenyas I'd tried, though the noodles were a tad undercooked, even for Hakata noodles which are supposed to be thinner and more al dente than regular ramen noodles. ÊI passed that off as being a side effect of busy day 2 business and not standard operating procedure. Ê(And in fact, I went back later with a different friend and the noodle problem had indeed been solved.) ÊOverall, they were the best I'd had in New York, though still far behind ramen found in CA or Japan. Ê(The rumors are true--the best ramen in New York City is in Edgewood, NJ in the Mitsuwa food court.) Ê All in all, I loved the decor, liked the noodles, didn't like the prices, didn't like most of the other menu options, didn't like the scarce toppings, but since I don't have the energy to go to Jersey every time I want good ramen and it's got great ambiance for a date, I have to give Ippudo 4 stars just for doing a better job than anyone else in Manhattan so far.

This place would kill in LA. ÊWhen will they bring a place like this here?!!? Ê So I liked it just a little ;). ÊThere is a similar, but different place in LA called Daikaku. ÊBoth places offer rich, flavorful broths, but that's where the similarities end. ÊWhereas Daikaku resembles a true, albeit larger, Japanese ramen-ya, with the counter view to the cooks, Ippudo is like most of the places I visited in NY. ÊNot only did it offer great food, but there was a hip and trendiness that you often don't find in good eats in LA. ÊSemi-dimly lit with avante garde flatware, the din in the place was energetic without overpowering. ÊIt's almost a place to impress a second or third casual date. Ê Okay okay okay... to the food. ÊWe were only able to try three of the dishes: Êa cucumber appetizer, the akamaru and the shiyo ramen. ÊThe cucumber was deceptively... phenomenal. ÊIt was a simply sliced (and as my date pointed out, even serrated on the bottom so that it soaked up the sauce) Japanese (?) cucumber with a sesame, garlic, sea salt and olive oil (?) sauce. ÊSounds simple right? ÊThe combo was P-E-R-F-E-C-T. Ê The akamaru ramen was.... phenomenal. ÊThe flavors just absolutely dance on your taste buds, largely thanks to the little ball of flava -- I think it was butter, garlic, and some red peppers. ÊNot only did this differ from all other ramens I've had, but the noodles were special as well. ÊThese were fresher, thinner types -- very much like my favorite wonton noodle soup (see my pics -- sorry, can only be found in Ping-tung, Taiwan.) ÊAwesome! Ê The shiyo ramen was good -- as good as any other place you'd find at a respectable ramen place. ÊBut if you're at Ippudo--get the akamaru.

I rarely, if ever go out for ramen. My rationale is that why pay $10 for a bowl of noodles that I can make at home? Well my bf and I were deciding on where to eat out on a friday evening. He was craving ramen and I remember reading all these positive reviews for Ippudo on Yelp. I suggested this place to him and he was game. We came to Ippudo around 4:45ish. The restaurant itself wasn't officially open yet as they start dinner service at 5PM. So we decided to wait inside in the waiting area until they were ready for service. There were at least 3 other couples inside waiting with us. At 5 we were seated promptly and as we were walking to our tables the whole staff greeted us in Japanese. Neat. The decor is pretty modern and nice. It's nice that they have an open kitchen. After we were seated we looked over the menu. I knew that I wanted to try the pork belly buns that everyone seem to think so highly of. Looking over the choices for ramen I decided to go with the spicy ramen (the name escapes my mind right now.) You can get it spicy or really spicy - I opted for the latter as I love spicy food. My bf got the Tonkotsu ramen and decided to add some chasu on top. He got a some Kirin and I opted for the Sapporo. The pork belly buns came first. O-M-G delicious! Thinly sliced pork belly, cucumbers, scallions and hoisin sauce. Yummy. At $8 for two, it was worth it. I could definitely eat at least 3 of those. Onto the main event - the ramen. The ramen was so delicious! The broth as others have mentioned was rich and creamy. This is definitely not your typical, general run of the mill ramen. The noodles were fresh and cooked perfectly. My broth was super spicy - just the way I like it. My bf's ramen was rich, fatty and tasted sublime. The beer that we got along with our orders was a perfect companion. Light and slightly bitter, went along well with the ramen. We both decided that we weren't quite full yet so we got the extra ramen. Big mistake as the the broth wasn't as hot as when we first got it so the noodles didn't taste as good. I think next time I'll skip that part and be content with my ramen. We were debating whether to get dessert or not but decided that we might as well. The dessert menu comes as this little book - super cute. We opted for the match creme brulee. MMmmm. It was a really good choice! The matcha creme brulee had a yummy sugary top and a nice smooth inside. The flavor was just right. The brulee went super well with the matcha ice cream on top. Yumm... I will definitely order that again! All in all a good experience. The place was starting to pick up as expected on a friday evening. There was a couple that was with us waiting at the beginning that went in, each getting a bowl of ramen and finished promptly - leaving shortly afterwards. I would recommend coming in early to get the best experience as it seems like it could get quite crowded. Definitely come in and try the ramen!

This restaurant features both private and community tables, an overall chic ambiance, and peppy service. The ramen is delish, with a very rich and satisfying broth. From appetizers to desserts, everything that I've ever tried there has been flavorful and scrumptious. NOTE: There is almost always a wait, so try going early if you can. This is NOT the kind of noodle shop that you go to when you are on a diet. You WILL come out smelling like food, so dress accordingly.

I think I'm deaf. I think someone may have referred to it as "decibel-blasting" Stepping into the main dining room, the hostess, waiters and cooks are all yelling greetings/orders/insults (I'm not sure since everything was in Japanese) and the bustling atmosphere is punctuated with booming Japanese catchphrases every minute or so. Despite this (or maybe because of this), the food is delicious. I ordered the Classic, hubby ordered the Modern. Loved them both! Delicious chasu Êand kakuni, both fatty and delicious. The prices though are a little bit higher than your typcial noodle bowl place. $14 for a bowl of Ippudo Ramen...vs. $8.50 for Ajisen ramen...vs. $6.50 for a bowl of Pho...vs. $4.50 for a bowl of Lanzhou noodles. All are delicious and each have their value. I would definitely return. Also, take a trip down to the bathroom and there is a tiny slit of a window to view ramen sheets being hand fed through a machine, made fresh.

I really love this place... Probably the best ramen I've ever had.. and trust, I've had a lot. OH! And the pork buns are muy delicious. I also had the fried peppers, which were pretty good too (for those of you that like peppers). I came here at 6pm on a Friday night and somehow missed the long lines (that I had heard so much about). The thought of a long wait, keeping me from my delicious ramen, scares me enough to plan my next visit strategically, as to not have to wait any longer than necessary. I rarely give out 5-stars.. but this joint is truly deserving. Great atmosphere, good service, and delicious food. It's now a staple for every future NYC visit.

Came here with one of my friend, who promised me that I would enjoy the food here. The place isn't too big so I had to wait about a hour to be seated. The service here was good and the employees were all very friendly. The food here is good but the portions are really small for the price they charge. Overall this is a decent place and I would come again but not when I'm really hungry or have to wait that long.

By FAR, THE BEST ramen I've had EVER and of course the pork HIRATA BUNS! OMG. I didn't really want anything too heavy and so I went with the tori ramen - it is OMG goodness! The lunch set, honestly isn't meant for people who have to go back to work... because I had a massive food coma after. I didn't even want to get up and leave because I was THAT full. IPPUDO, I'm impressed. AND you're just so trendy inside for a ramen restaurant! I LOVE IT!

Yes, the line is over an hour wait (double the time the hostess tells you, trust me, 30min means an hour wait, 45min means an hour half, etc). ÊI had enough time to trek up to the Strand bookstore, browse, find and buy 3 books, and trek back with time to spare on my wait. But it's seriously worth it. Best ramen in NY hands down, and comparable to the good ones I had in Japan. ÊGrab their pork buns while you're at it too - you won't be disappointed! ÊGood drinks too, loved their Yuzu cocktail! Wish they would open a 2nd location, but nonetheless... I'll be back.

BEST PORK BUNS EVER AWARD!!! Most delicious and delicate little pork buns you have ever had. Seriously. Love the Modern ramen and the pickled veggies are awesome. Ippudo is always well worth the (most likely) 45 minute wait.

Absolutely loved this place! From the greeting upon entering to the decor. And lets not forget about the main reason, the Ramen! There are about seven types to choose from and each one has its own distinct flavors but all so good. It is a little pricy for ramen and the waits can get ridculous but i think its well worth it.

I was able to check out Ippudo before it officially opened in NYC. ÊI ate there for lunch on MAR 26. I guess I am spoiled by my local ramen shop in California (Shin-Sen-Gumi, Fountain Valley, CA)...I ordered Ippudo's tonkotsu-style ramen (the first item on their menu). ÊThis is a personal choice, but I prefer my ramen noodles hard, but there was no choice for firmness of noodle. The noodles they served were on the soft side. The broth wasn't as thick or flavorful as I'm usually used to. ÊAgain, this is a personal preference for ramen, and others' preferences may differ. Also, I wish there was an option for spicy miso for the ramen. ÊPerhaps they have it, but I didn't see it on the menu. ÊAlso, you have to request for additional condiments (sesame seeds, salt/pepper, etc.) because it is not readily available at the table. Again, I was there before the restaurant "officially" opened, so many items may change in their grand opening. Ê As for the environment, the restaurant looks very classy and upscale. ÊThe bamboo tree that splits into the ceiling is really cool. ÊThe bathrooms downstairs are nice and as you walk to the bathroom, there are small windows so you can see the cooking staff at work. ÊThe restaurant are very polite and give good service. ÊVery cool. ÊI can't wait to visit this place again if I visit the East Coast again. ÊI anticipate that Ippudo will be filled with customers once this place opens and words spreads.

We had 3 different types of soups and chef's choice of 5 appetizers. ÊMy oh my. ÊThe broth in all 3 soups was fantastic. ÊI'm not a Ramen specialist in the least, but my past experience led me to believe the flavours were meant to be understated and subtle. ÊNot the case here at all. ÊVery strong and gorgeous flavors - and all 3 soups were quite distinct, the spicy ground pork one really had a nice kick. Ê The apps were lovely particularly the pork belly which was like eating foie gras on top of chicharon - holy instant heart attack - but at least you died with a smile. Ê The only downside was the apparent lack of choice for vegetarians. ÊNo vegetarian broth, with what seemed like only 1 main that was vegetarian. ÊThe 2 veggies that I was with were frustrated by the lack of choice, but seemed to enjoy there meal. Definitely going back there - at $13 bucks for the noodles its more than worth it.

After reading about the incredibly long waits at Ippudo, I made it a point to arrive as early as possible. At around 5:30PM, our party of two was seated promptly at a large table shared by other twosomes and threesomes. We started with the chicken hirata buns, which were mildly spicy and served the way peking duck is, and quite good. As for the ramen, I had the classic and my friend had the modern. While neither of us are big ramen-eaters, we both enjoyed our meal. The noodles were thin, and smooth, just the way I like them. There might have only been a slice or two of pork in mine, but that didn't bother me. The broth was rich and flavorful..really goood..but became a bit salty toward the end. My only regret is not getting their matcha brulee and opting for dessert from the Dessert Truck instead. I'm already looking forward to coming back!

Yum yum yum. I was in Tokyo recently, in search of the best ramen, and believe it or not Ippudo came up several times as a recommendation. I was like, Ippudo? Like the one in NY? Apparently so. And I love it! The wait at dinner can be long, so go for lunch if you can cause there's pretty much no wait. The service is attentive and knowledgeable and everyone is so smiley and helpful. My friend and I recently tried their chicken wings (since Korean chicken wings were the rage - I figured why not try Japanese ones). De-licious. Sweet but not so much so that its sickening and lightly crisped. And of course their ramen. Soupy goodness in huge portions (that unfortunately you don't get to take home if you don't finish), the ramen is packed with flavor. I love the tonkatsu broth and like adding a little poached egg to my noodle. Their spicy is not too spicy so if you get a spicy ramen don't be afraid to get medium spicy. yum yum. I am salivating just thinking about it. Definitely a spot for destination dining!

Irrasshaimase! From the moment you walk into this hot, crowded, teak-paneled funhouse of an American ramen-ya, you know you're in for a hell of a time. The always-jammed front bar/holding pen, the certifiably insane wait times at normal dinner hours and the servers that always seem to be yelling something-or-other in Japanese at each other, at you, or at no one in particular; that's Ippudo. Itadakimasu! Past 7pm the wait for two can be as long as two hours. Yes, two hours for ramen. My advice for the guys is to get there at 6:30, put your name down for the hour-long wait, pick up your date at 7:15 and walk her past the teeming crowds to your awaiting table just, as they say, the moment is right. No waiting, at this place? She'll swoon! What a gentleman you are! But the ramen steals the show here. Order the shiromaru classic. Or the akamaru modern. Either way, you won't be disappointed. I think there have been literally 1,000,000 reviews written about this most sacrosanct of NYC noodle joints so I won't belabor the point, but the ramen is springy, the broth is rich and the Berkshire pork is all fat and deliciousness. Speaking of, get some of the pork buns to start off, they're just as good as Momofuku's. And Kirin Ichiban, ice cold off the tap, slices through the greasiness of the meal nicely. A friend of mine, who is ethnically Japanese, isn't a big fan. Ippudo isn't "authentic," in terms of the food and the experience. That may be true (he prefers Minca) but that isn't really the point here, I think. Big flavors, high prices, loud noises and absurd wait times... this is an amusement park of a noodle restaurant. It's a caricature. It's a New York ramen-ya and it, quite appropriately, kicks ass.

This was the location of my first date with my now fiance. The wait actually gave us a chance to chat and hang out so it works out. I recall having the agedashi tofu special, 3 pieces each with a different topping. Food art. This place should get 5 stars but the portions are a bit small. This time around, we got the scallop carpaccio. Delicious appetite wetter. For dinner, I got the Mentaiko Ramen which is sauteed and not in a broth. It was listed as an appetizer for $8 but for $12, i could get the large. In about 8 mouthfuls, it was gone. I can only imagine how big the appetizer was. But everything was delicious and leave me wanting more. But it's also a bit expensive. And be prepared to wait. We waited about 45-50 mins, 10 mins short of the time they estimated. They are both very thankful and apologetic for the long wait. The staff and service was very good.

OK with the bazillion reviews here, everyone agrees that Ippudo has really good Ramen. However, I do not think it is worth the 1 hr and 45 mins wait for dinner. Either come for lunch, or grab a snack and eat a late dinner. My friends and I gave up the first time and came back around 10pm the next night and there was still a half an hour wait, but thats Nothing! We hung out at the bar and had a very delicious lychee martini. The place is really loud and fun. When you walk into the dining room with the hostess, she makes a small announcement and all the cooks, waiter screams some greeting at you. I couldn't help but smile. Also, if you're with a small party, you sit at these communal tables with other people. They have really good ramen and the soup is amazing. I do not think the pork buns everyone talk about it that great. The bun itself is soft. But it is kind-of bland. Also, I do not like that all ramen is served with pork.

Hmmm. I am torn. How do you give the half stars? Can you? It's 3.5 stars. ÊIn Canada, with the Globe and Mail rating movies, all movies get 3.5 stars because the critics are mother###ers who don't like anything. ÊSo when I see 3.5 stars, I'm like, oh, I'll probably enjoy this even though it won't blow my mind because it won't have one long take or complete nudity or I already heard of the director and this is not his best-movie-ever and probably julia roberts or george clooney is in it. ÊI mean, let's face it. Their best movies are 3.5 stars. Ê Right. ÊSo. Ippudo = Pretty Woman, if you had to wait like 2 hours on a busy night to see it. The first time I came here with a group of 4 (or 5, or 6 depending on who was getting the text message...Friday or Saturday night, really, we were just being ridiculous to try to go here), they were like: "1.5 hour wait". Ê1.5 hour wait!! ÊActually I think the second time they also said 1.5 hour wait, and I was only two people, and it was Sunday around 9pm. So the whole 1.5 hour wait must be a Test. Ê Then they show me the list and they're like - yeah, all these people we already called them and they weren't there so we are moving quick. ÊSo my companion and I think: ha ha, suckers! you failed the first test! ÊAnd within 40 minutes we are seated. ÊReally. ÊI'm not quite sure about the time because for some reason we were already drinking heavily that day, oh right, I remember, it was my birthday weekend. ÊDigression. ÊAnyhoo - we had time to each go to the bathroom, eat a pork belly bun (AHHHH DELICIOUSNESS), drink a cocktail and a beer respectively and also had time to make suggestive eye flirtations at sexy bartender man while companion was in bathroom. Ê ha ha ha. ÊVery sexy bartender. So - 5 star pork belly bun, 5 star hot bartender, nice space, less than 1.5 hour wait, what's the problem? ÊThe problems my friend is it is RAMEN and I have had some good freaking Ramen. ÊYou want good freaking ramen? Go to THIS PLACE IN HONG KONG (i know, not even Japan) - http://www.timeout.com.hÉ - I don't even know if they have their own website. Ê And their *most expensive* Ramen is $12.85USD or 100HKD. I just did the currency conversion. Ê I mean, WTF. ÊIt's Ramen. ÊYou make the broth. ÊIt's going, it's going, you throw in two fine slices of pork and some scallions, you roast the bones....sure you yell at me "irasshaimase!!!!" and I get all excited and Japanese-y and.... ÊBut you can't fool me with your Japanese yelling and your low lighting and your excellent service because at the end of the day its noodle soup and it tastes just as good sitting on a tiny plastic chair on a slanty street in HK ticking things off a piece of paper. You know what? I don't need to cut you down though, Ippudo, but I refudiate your five stars. ÊBecause you are 3.5 stars. ÊWe enjoyed you. ÊI mean, we paid $100 for all that enjoyment PLUS pork belly bun + cocktails...so probably dropped like $140 really (for ramen)...and we did have a very nice, very milky sake, and I did throw the extra toppings in, and btw the miso bowl is better than the wasabi bowl but if you're crafty like me you'll connive your friend into getting the subpar but still interesting bowl so that you can sample both. Ê But yeah, I don't need to cut you down. ÊYou just carry on with your 3.5 stars and your 1.5hour line and people will enjoy. You're a blockbuster really, you just don't get to win the Oscar for best picture.

The special ramen came w/cha siu patte on 2 small toast and their special broth. I ordered the which had tonkatsu broth, mushroom, radish. All of us added pork belly to our ramen which was sooo fatty but really good. Loved the broth as it was full bodied and not watered down. Bf ordered the Philly Cheesesteak eggroll which was odd to say the least but definitely not worth ordering ever again. Service was friendly. Atmosphere was fantastic.

I always thought Ramen are just like Instant Noodles...but I fell in love with Ippudo the first time I came about 3 years ago...(yes it took me three years to write a reivew =P) I usually get the Akamaru Modern. I will never get sick of it. The broth is awesome..it probably makes the noodles. It's not too thick, not too heavy, just perfect.

Nestled in the youthful Astor Place neighborhood, Ippudo serves up authentic Japanese ramen to vibrant crowds while Queen, Bowie and Robyn soundtrack. Try the Akamaru Modern ($15), a miso-based ramen with scallions and pork chashu, which could comfortably feed a pair of dudes but is unshareably delicious. The Ippudo salad with dried sardines ($9) and Hirata buns (pork, chicken or shrimp, $9) are divine, but steer clear of their "tender" Washyu beef with mustard cream and asparagus ($20). Ramen should be cooked al dente; meat should not.

As a designers point of view, I love the interior/exterior. As an eater, I love their food. We went her as an accident and happily so. We were on our way to watch the Euro Cup finale at the Central Bar and we didn't anticipate the crowd. So we spun around the block and found this place. The facade was a real eye catcher. Faceted wood slats and clean glass, cant go wrong there and the inside was not a bore either. Japanese modern, but, by no means minimal. The menu was short and simple (always a good sign) and we got our food fast! Tasty and fresh noodles with great broth. I would definitely go back if we're in the area.

This noodle bistro is cool for ambiance, but not the best for food. Ê The wait to be seated was easily soaked up by an ice cold Sapporo and my warm company at the bar. Ê If you are a small party (2), they seat you side by side with strangers on long benches. ÊNot private, but it's a ramen house after all. Ê For a minuscule portion of noodles and only enough pork to be bowl decoration, the price is laughably insulting. ÊOne has to purchase a separate dish of extra noodles ($2) and they come out cold, stuck together, and much later than your Êoriginal bowl. ÊThe noodles are unusually thin for fresh ramen and contributes to their lack of texture. ÊA bit too soft, like they have been sitting in soup a little too long. ÊSpeaking of soup, notice how no one mentions much about the soup/broth? ÊEnough said. ÊOr perhaps all Yelpers mother's taught them well: if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it. Although nearby Minca's is smaller and less fancy, it's a superior bowl of ramen and you'll probably be seated by yourselves so you won't be speaking to your date while some stranger is putting on lipstick across from you =P

We cruised over to Ippudo to find that the waiting time was 3 HOURS!!!!! It was worth it!! We were in disbelief Êbut luckily we had time to have a few drinks before dinner. I ordered the chicken appetizers adn the Kogashi Ramen. OMG THE BEST RAMEN EVER!!!! WHat they do is re boil the broth to give it that rustic charbroiled taste.... it has a sweet but bbq-ish broth.

I was born and raised in LA, but nothing beats food from NYC! I have had my fair share of ramen and I have to say that this is my personal favorite. Sure its pricier than most ramen spots, but it is also that much better. The noodles are made in-house, and the original tonkotsu broth slightly more flavorful than Daikokuya in LA. Make sure to order Bakudan with your ramen, a paste that will only intensify the flavor of the soup. The shisito peppers were grilled very good here and served with a lemon salt mixture that gave it a nice taste. Will be back here again FO SHO! This is a must visit if you are in Manhattan.

Ippudo NY fits right in the neighborhood. First, it's hip. Second, it's a Japanese restaurant. Lastly, it's affordable. That being said, it's probably just as good as you think it is after reading all of the reviews for this place. What's something new that I can add? I'm not too sure. I arrived with a friend a little past 5 o' clock. There was still a bit of a wait, but nothing more than 15 minutes. I could already tell that this place would be jammed packed if we had came even an hour later. There's a small bar in the lobby/waiting area. Happy hour drinks are 2 for $6 which is not bad at all for two Japanese beers on tap, Sapporo and Asahi. You can also order appetizers. For the time I was there, I restrained myself from ordering any chicken wings though I was very tempted. (It should be noted that the appetizers at the bar are cheaper than at the table. But I don't know if the portion is made smaller.) As I moved from the lobby to the seating area, the restaurant opened itself up to me. The decor and ambiance suddenly hits you as lively and pleasing to the eye. The tables are rather large and the cushy seats welcome you with their arms. For larger groups, there are equally as comfortable booths seated next to a white wall with raised Japanese characters. The waiters and waitresses were very attentive and energetic as well. You could see them whizzing through the aisles and checking up on other patrons while avoiding any high speed collisions. The menu has a good variety of items. I started out with the Chef's Omokase followed by the Akamaru Modern. The appetizer was an assortment of three small dishes of the chef's choosing that day. It comprised of a piece of braised beef in a cream sauce, a shrimp salad, and three cubes of Êraw tuna served with wasabi. The salad and the beef were very delectable and I do not have any complaints about the tuna. The main entree, the Akamaru Modern, was a different sort of ramen than I am used to. First, the noodles themselves were tender and had good texture. The soup base tasted cool and refreshing. I was conflicted at the time to try this out or the spicy ramen dish. Still, it's a new twist on something old. (Therefore, some people might love it, while others hate it.) I find myself to be pretty indifferent to it. I would have to try it again to form a more solid opinion. I am glad that there is a new ramen restaurant in the area. It definitely appeals to a different crowd and has a different menu all together than my usual place. I rate the food as being 3 stars and the experience as a whole, 4 stars. I'm rather conservative (and also moody), so for now, I have only 3 stars. On a return trip, we'll see how it turns out.

This might be my favorite ramen place so far... I've had at least 3 different ramen soups and all were delicious. I had the Akamaru Modern, the spicy pork, and most recently their seasonal Shoyu Ramen, or as they call it their "1980s-style" ramen. I was worried that it wouldn't be as good as the first two, but it was even better! I also LOVE their pork/chicken buns. I think I prefer it with pork but both are good. It is amazingly soft and tender-both the bread and meat. And I like the spicy mayo and lettuce they put on it. Unusual, but heavenly. Also I love the decor of their interior. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that their staff can be hit-and-miss; sometimes they're very kind but other times they can be rather stand-offish, maybe because they're so busy. I recommend going at lunchtime; usually it's too long of a wait when I've gone for dinner.

This place was on my must-try list, recommended by a handful of New Yorkers so I had to try! Despite the hour-long wait, it was worth it. The hitaka buns (I got the chicken) were amazing - the fantastic balance of soft steamed buns with the sensation of perfectly seasoned chicken with a slightly sweetened mayo sauce... I was in love. As much as I love my late nights at Koraku in LA, I must say the broth at this place had much appeal. It was thicker and spicier than most, but it was also rich and satisfying. I'll always love my classic shoyu, but sometimes it's nice to try something new. Try the spicy tonkatsu!

Had the pork buns (great, with a touch of spiciness) and classic Ramen as well as the Special Shoyu Ramen. Preferred the special shoyu, as it had more rich flavors (a lot of garlic) and spiciness compared to the classic. Setting and ambiance are great with friends, and maybe a date (it is pretty loud and open) - at any rate the restaurant exudes hustle, bustle, and fun. One thing I didn't like (why it lost a star, as well as being more expensive than it should be) was how the waiters/waitresses are constantly running by your area picking up your finished plates and asking if you're done - they're basically rushing you through your meal in order to seat the next customers, which wasn't particularly enjoyable.

This place is yummy. Noodles in broth is always a winning combination in my book, and this place holds up in both areas. This is hardly your avg day cup of noodle that we're all familiar with, this is what those styrofoam imitators try to mimic. A perfect blend of sweet and savory broth mixed with soft ramen noodles, topped off with a little bit of meat, green onions, and half boiled egg. Compared to the other ramen places i have been to in the city, this is slightly more upscale in terms of decor, but is no less cramped than what i'm used to in St. Marks. There is hardly any space for anything except yourself when you sit, and there are few to none isolated tables, so conversations could get a little loud. The service, however, was fantastic. Not only were they attentive and quick, they were kind and friendly. Great service always makes up for lack of space. This place is a little pricey, but definitely worth a trip if you are in the area. One appetizer I would like to recommend is the philly cheesesteak eggroll, at first glance it looks and tastes like a taquito you could get at 7 eleven, but by the time I got to my last bite i was left craving more. It was definitely the better of the two appetizers I tried that night(the other one was a cold app, seafood something, i don't remember).

On a food adventure throughout the city with a Japanese ferret, she suggested that we stop by here at her favorite ramen place in the city. ÊOh you know how this guy can get, get an idea in the head, it not coming out. ÊThis hungry ferret needed ramen and fast. ÊHopefully it be better than the ones from the old college dorm days, and not burn the place down getting it. The bar area has a nice cool interior. ÊThey have various ramen bowls on the walls to decorate the place. ÊThe dining area is also very trendy. ÊThere are plenty of modern art looking items around. ÊThe walls by our booth also has some fancy Japanese writing that is highlighted by the light within the restaurant. ÊNice touch here. The menu was easy to read. ÊThey have description for every dish and list all the ingredients. ÊIt shouldn't be intimidating for anybody to decide what to order. There usually a slight wait since this place is usually busy. ÊAzumaichi Junmai Sake was there to entertain this ferret. ÊThis sake was served cold and have a pure taste. ÊThe flavors of the sake can probably be described as smooth and having a slight dry after taste. ÊIt is served in a modern shot glass but at the same time within a traditional sake box. ÊPaws up for this one. ÊNote also at the bar, the dry ramen under glass as a decoration. Hirata Buns are steamed bread buns filled with a juicy fatty pork, lettuce and a sauce. ÊThese buns are excellent here and have slight spicy kick to them. ÊI recommend getting these as an appetizer. Akamaru Modern is a tonkotsu soup with pork belly, cabbage, mushroom, scallions, miso paste, and garlic oil. ÊThe ramen in this dish was excellent. ÊThey had the right balance between texture, taste and length. ÊThe soup had a strong pork flavor and went very well with all the ingredients in the bowl. ÊThis dish was very satisfying. Miso Ramen is a bit different, it contained Soy bean paste flavored ramen noodles in tonkotsu soup with pork belly chashu, cabbage, spinach, manma, ginger & scallions. ÊThe ramen noodles in this dish was also excellent. ÊThe flavor of the soup is much more milder and not as strong as the tonkotsu one, it not as salty. ÊBut still excellent also, this would be a second choice. Note also for all the Ramen dishes, you can get a Kae-dama order for additional $2. ÊWhich is extra noodle on a plate to add back into your ramen dish. ÊThis is worth the extra two dollars since ramen here cost $13 per bowl. ÊAs long as you have a decent amount of broth left it be a good option, most likely people can finish another order of noodles.

Not quite sure that this place lives up to all the hype. ÊThe food is very good, but the prices seem a little high to me. ÊHonestly, I like the ramen from Kambi (14th St. and 1st Ave.) as much if not more than the ramen from this place, and it is considerably less expensive. Perhaps I would like it more if you didn't have to wait a lifetime to be seated....

california has nothing compared to ippudo. sure it's a bit expensive, sure it's a long wait, sure it's a bit crowded, but come on. if it's the best ramen in the entire united states, what's a little bit of inconvenience? plus it's usually filled with trendy hipster good looking females, so that's always a plus. you know like when you're waiting in line at disneyland for the matterhorn and you get showered with rainbows and unicorns? yeah it's like that. that doesn't happen for you? i guess you need to go to disneyland with me and experience that kind of awesomeness.

I doubt Ippudo needs another rave review but I'm going to throw mine in the pile. IPPUDO ramen is phenomenal. ÊAmazing, deliciouso, whatever you want to call it. I LOVE their spicy ramen...soup is very addictive, lowish prices and spacious, hip decor. ÊTo digress from the ramen I am so a big fan of the "rice burger" and the philly cheesesteak spring rolls. ÊBoth inventive and delicious. Alcoholic drinks here aren't hte greatest but if you must, I'd go with beer. Amazing food but be prepared for a long wait. PS - No, you can't pack your ramen to go (I'm think it's b/c ramen gets soggy and they dont' want your last experience with Ippudo to be a gross one).

Ippudo has, by far, the best ramen that I've ever had. I am not Japanese, but I have had a lot of ramen in different places in my life. I've even visited Japan numerous times so I'd like to think that I have something to compare this place to. This place just gets it - the thick broth of the Akamaru and the perfect consistency of the noodles are something that EVERY ramen enthusiast NEEDS to try at least once. I went for lunch with a Japanese friend who insisted that this place was the most authentic ramen - and I was definitely not disappointed. We beat the lunch hour rush so there was no wait, but a mere 15 minutes later the place had a line out the door. I always associate "authentic" ramen places with shabby, hole-in-the-wall decor, but Ippudo surprised me with their chic decor. it's hip and you can tell it is trying to cater to the young, hip crowd of NYC and it does its job and i'm guessing it's the decor and the ambiance you pay for because i JUST don't think a bowl of ramen should ever be over $10! In summary, i LOVE this place and i can't wait to go back!

To be fair, I think this place deserves a 3.5 star from me. The ramen there was definitely some of the best on the city. It opens late and seves great food. Try any one of their signature ramen and it'll be really good. The design of this place, both interior and exterior is very unique. The facade of the store is made out of planks of 2 by 4s. Under the glass panel of the bar there are bricks of dried ramen noodle. The first kme I saw it I thought it was very cool. The ambiance of the interior can be described as modern Japanese. The only down side is that the wait is too long and the noodle commands a hefty price (for noodle).

I want to give a little short of 3and a half to this place. ÊIt was my 3rd time dining there last week. ÊUnlike the one ÊI visited in Japan, this NY establishment is decorated nicely and the place is always full with people. Every time I go to NYC, I always want to stop by there once. Consequently, every time I dine there, I am a bit dissapointed. ÊI began to understand recently that I do not like their type of noodles. ÊIt does not have that resiliency that I love about ramen noodles in their dish. ÊMaybe because this is rather Kyusyu-style that I am not quite familiar with. I love their Tonkotsu (means pork bone base and not Tonkatsu that somebody wrote) in their review), though.

A long, long wait but well worth every aching stomach growl. ÊI dragged my bf out to try some ramen noodles (even after he complained about the expensive bowls of noodles). ÊWe both enjoyed every last slurp. When you enter the restaurant, there is a nice hostess that highlights and writes the names of each guest that enters or is seated. ÊEven with all the craziness, she has quite a good system going. ÊWhen we were finally called for our table, a waitress came to escort us. ÊWe walked to the back and all you heard was the waitress saying something in Japanese and then an echo of a few men at the stove hollering back. ÊIt appears to be their way of saying "welcome". The soups were delicious!!! ÊThey provide you with a soup spoon as large as a ladle - very interesting way of drinking soup. ÊOur waiter was very nice. ÊHe made great suggestions and told us what additions went well with what soup base. ÊI enjoyed my meal! ÊI would definitely go back, but only when I'm not starving. ÊWait is forever.

Oh New Yorkers... $15 for ramen? Really? Ramen?! ÊA place like this most likely wouldn't survive too well in LA unless it was located within the Beverly hills area. I feel that in New York, most ratings on food tend to lean more towards design rather than the actual food. Interior is lovely though. Great atmosphere. Which I'm assuming is why this place got 4 and 5 stars. The ramen itself is not bad. I got the miso while the boyfriend got the hakata. Nice and flavorful but for what you pay, I expected a little bit more. I actually left still hungry and had to grab some chicken and rice from one of the street carts. Now that was delicious and cost only $5. But I will say that my extra star is for the Sapporo on tap. AWESOME. Tasted very good. All in all, I don't think I'll be coming back. LA is just filled with too much fantastic home made cheap ramen that New York fails to compete with.

My friends talked up Ippudo as having the best ramen in the world! ÊA skeptic by nature, I thought to myself, "Best ramen in the world? ÊEven better than in Japan? ÊNo way!" ÊWe went for lunch during a weekday...beat the lunch crowd and didn't even have to wait for a table! ÊI got the Akamaru Modern with eel. ÊI've yet to try ramen in Japan, so I hesitate to label Ippudo as the best ramen in the world, but I have to say, it really was the best ramen I've ever had. ÊI'm not the biggest fan of ramen in general, but the ramen at Ippudo was better than Santouka, Shin-Sen-Gumi, and Katana-ya! The green tea creme brulee was just ok, nothing spectacular. ÊThere are so many great dessert options in Manhattan... I say skip the dessert at Ippudo and get dessert elsewhere.

Words cannot describe how much I love Ippudo ramen. The Modern Ramen is by far my favorite and I HAVE to get it every time I'm in NYC. I just wish the line wasn't so long. This time, I got there right when the place opened and there was already a line outside the door. Once they opened the door, we were filed in and around the bar like cattle! The same, "don't EFF with me" head hostess was there and I feel like she is part of the experience. My favorite is when newbies try to bargain with her and she gives them the stink eye, muhuhahahah!!! Anyway, my recommendations are the Modern Ramen, get there early, and ENJOY!

I've heard so much about Ippudo and I thought I go check it out with a friend. The friend is not new to Ippudo. She actually likes the place. I, on the other hand, thought the place was OK. The ramen is overpriced. I had Akamaru Modern. It was different, somewhat tasty. The broth was decent. Garlic oil made it unique. Charsu was ok. We had some other chicken dishes but weren't memorable. I just remember the dishes costing a little too much for the small portion. I can't remember what my friend had. I would go back again. This time I'll take a friend who loves ramen and see what she thinks of the place. Good thing we didn't have to wait long for a table. I love the decor. No wonder the ramen is pricey.

I had dinner here last Friday for the first time. I was told in advance that dinner on a Friday night could result in a crazy long wait. I was able to get there at about 5:15PM check in and they told me to check back in with them when the rest of my party was there. We were able to get promptly seated at about 5:45 which was not too bad. The waiting area gets a bit crowded but it is a nice environment with ramen and ramen bowl decorations at the front bar. We ended up being seated at the back which is a lot quieter than the front which people yelling "Irashaimase" every time they seat new people so I consider that a plus. Fast service and very attentive staff. I went with a group of 4. We ordered cucumbers as an appetizer. Some of the best cucumbers I have had. They were very refreshing and has some sort of salt on them. I ordered the Akamaru Ramen. The noodles here are delicious. Thin and delicious. The broth and overall bowl is very good too but somehow I left somewhat unfulfilled (maybe the noodles were too light or serving was unsubstantial). The plating is great and it smells good a very solid fresh tasting ramen dish but a little pricey at around $13 (but I chalk that up to location/decor/name). My boyfriend had the off-menu vegetarian wasabi ramen with extra noodles. He said it was okay but not great. It looks kind of weird and his bowl was a lot smaller. I would go back if friends were interested but I have since been to Minka which I like better.

Needless to say anymore than has been previously said, Ippudo NY was a great choice. The Akamaru Modern and the Chashu Pork were delicious. The ramen itself was very good and not too tender or too hard. The pork was smoky with just the right amount of fat. After i had left the smoky taste was still lingering and I wanted more. My girlfriend had the Karaka Miso Ramen and she also found it very delicious. It has just enough heat to make it spicy but an enjoyable meal. We plan on visiting again.

Ippudo has great ramen noodles, and great pork buns, and great everything! ÊIt also holds the title of 'most visited restaurant in NYC by JLF' Yes, its that good. My favorite is the Modern, with pork belly and rich broth that fills you up and leaves you warm. ÊThe classic is also good but is Êa a little more simple and lacks pork belly, need I say more? ÊAsk for sriracha or Togarashi to spice it up a bit! ÊI am a purist so those are my favorite although friends have raved about the miso as well. Oh, and I always add a poached egg.... Other notes: There will be a wait, always. ÊCommunal seating. ÊA selection of sake & beer, never had any wine although they offer it.

Been here 2x and it's hands-down my favorite ramen place in NYC. ÊEverything is a bit pricier but some of the items are well worth it. ÊThe key is to actually be seated within half an hour after you first arrive at the restaurant, which is no small feat since mealtimes will garner a large crowd in their small, dimly lit bar area (honestly, I've been to nightclubs with more lighting than this restaurant, but no nightclub serves hirata buns, which I will get into shortly...) with wait times that can exceed an hour. ÊThis is not the place to take a romantic date, between the clamor in the open kitchen to all the wait staff yelling in Japanese (and only 1/3 of the staff is Japanese) when orders are being placed or food is being brought out to the customers. For the appetizers, the ponzu sounds fancy but is served in a champagne glass with these long small spoons that you are supposed to use to fish out the little tidbits of octopus and shrimp, not worth the hype. The cream croquettes are delicious (4 for $12); the samurai ribs are tender and tasty but not fall-off-the-bone and vary in quantity (we got less on our plate compared to the one that was dished out the first time I saw it). The kushikatsu is a huge waste of money, 4 tiny tempura skewers for $18. The star of the show are the hirata buns: tender slabs of pork belly soaked in some hoisin-related sauce with japanese mayo, some lettuce in a soft and fluffy mon-toe bun (Taiwanese people will know what I mean) and are ridiculously delicious. I've actually never craved any sort of food the way I crave these buns now. ÊIf I could travel back in time, I'd exchange all the other appetizers but the croquettes for extra pork buns. For the ramen, I ordered the akamaru modern both times, which has the most flavorful broth of any ramen joint I've visited in NY, although I tried the shiromaru hakata classic which is also pretty good. ÊThe $2 extra you pay for hot sauce can be shared with the group but isn't particularly spicy, and you might as well cough up the $3 for another 3 slices of pork. ÊFor the hungry ones out there like me, save some of your broth and meat because you can ask for another helping of plain noodles from the kitchen for just $2. Matcha brulee was nothing special, and the mascarpone cheese on top of green tea ice cream was ok. Go to a real dessert joint if you're craving sweet things after. ÊOverall, I'm not sure if I'm willing to go anywhere else in NY for ramen at this point, since the great broth and addictive pork buns have won over my heart.

If this place didn't always have such a long wait, I'd eat here everyday. ÊAnd that's exactly why there's such a long wait. Ip-Pu-Do: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Ip. Pu. Do. Oh Ippudo, the things I would do to you! No but really, this place not only has amazing ramen (even in comparison the ones in Tokyo), but is also trendy and fun. Ê Things I love about Ippudo: 1. The staff yells at you when you walk in, which serves as the perfect climax to the painful wait, sometimes my heart even skips a beat. Ê 2. There's a display of ramen bowls on the wall, and two of which says "ARIGATOU!" on the bottom, thanking you the very moment you finish your soup. ÊI keep waiting for the day I see those words at the bottom of my ramen, it's exciting. 3. ÊKAE-DAMA. ÊThis is the phrase I use to persuade my roommate to go to ippudo with me again. ÊThe use of this phrase in addition to $2 gets you an extra ball of noodles in your bowl. ÊWow. 4. ÊThe Yokohama Ramen that is only available at lunchtime on weekdays. Ê In conclusion, I would highly advise one to NOT go to Ippudo, so the line doesn't get any longer.

I've never experienced such a horrible service at a high rated restaurant like Ippudo, NY. The host Wendy was very rude from the beginning and the waiter was rude through out our dinner too. Just because they are great tasting ramen restaurant, does NOT give them the right to provide substandard service like this. In fact, i was expecting exceptional service since i was paying for $15/ramen! There are other great ramen places in NY and you'll get more welcoming attitudes than Ippudo.

4.5 stars So does this place get the honor of serving the best ramen in the NY metro are? ÊI think so. ÊI had the special ramen, and it was fabulous. ÊIt was the best ramen I've had thus far in NY. ÊI always thought that the ramen at the Mitsuwa (Santouka Ramen) was the best in this area. Not no mo!! (to be fair, I haven't tried the other great ramen places such as Minca, Menkui Tei, Menchanko-Tei.) A lot of people complain about the prices at this place. ÊIt's not that bad when you consider that it's probably one the best looking restaurants around the area. ÊYou're paying for the ambience and the space. ÊYou're not being crammed into small tables and chairs. ÊUnlike what Lucius K posted previously, the place is not small. ÊIt's not huge but certainly not tiny. ÊI don't think Lucius saw the space in the back. ÊThe layout is in the shape of an upside down U. ÊYou walk in and you have the bar on the right and the hostess table ahead. ÊYou then walk down the corridor and you have the main space and the open kitchen on the right. ÊThere's a very large communal table in the middle. ÊThen you can make two lefts and you're at the other side of the restaurant just opposite of the front entrance. Ê This restaurant could probably fit twice as many patrons. ÊThank goodness it doesn't. ÊThe seating is perfect. ÊA lot of distance between the large tables and the oversized red leather chairs are a huge plus. ÊKudos to Mr. Kawahara for allowing us to both enjoy the food and the space. ÊSo a good slice of that $14 bowl of ramen goes to make up for the loss in additional revenue. Ê The quality of the service here was more than I expected. Oh yeah - the pork buns were great too! Ê This place is well worth the wait. ÊI'd rather wait an hour then to be seated in tiny tables and chairs within inches of other strangers which is what most restaurants in NYC tend to do nowadays.

Ippudo's ramen is fantastic. I suggest the Akamaru Modern. Which is a pork-based broth that I like to add pork belly (kakuni) and a seasoned egg (nitamago) to it. I have not experimented too much with the menu, but what's the point. Go to Ippudo for the ramen. I did have to chow down a few pork buns which are tasty (not as good as Momofuku but...). The buns have a spicy, almost buffalo sauce taste and a touch of mayo. Got there on a weekend day at Noon, was seated by 12:35. I suggest locking a spot down at the front bar, getting some sake, beers and pork buns. Total for two people + drinks was $60. I will definitely be back. A++++ would eat again

Ippudo sort of had the right idea with the quality and quantity of its food, but then overdosed on the hype (1+ hour wait, no reservations, $8 for tofu that comes in a $2.5 package sold at Sunrise Mart located one block away...) -- hence the 3 stars. Ê Ramen is Ramen....is Ramen. ÊI don't care how many different toppings you garnish it with or how sophisticatedly the base soup is "infused" or how awesome your knife skills are that you can chisel a hardboiled egg into the shape of a dinosaur. Ê It tastes good! ÊThe Tori and Shiomaru Hakata are default signatures. ÊBut it's just a bowl of Ramen, aka. Japanese fast food. ÊYou can get a bowl of hand made ramen in Japan with all the garnishes that you want for 300 Yen ($3.00)....not $13.00. Ê Alright, I'm ready for the hate mail.

This place seems to have it all. I went one day for an early dinner, and I got Pork buns and the Akamaru Modern Ramen. Absolute heaven. The decor is great too; low lighting, modern design, atmosphere, etc. If I had any negative qualities to list, it'd probably be that this place is too popular. If you want any chance of getting immediate seating, you'd have to come in around 5-5:30 in order to beat the dinner crowd. In my honest opinion, however, it would be very well worth the wait

Got there a little before 6pm, so the wait was only 30 minutes, but after us the wait was over an hour. Insane! The food is AMAZING. I don't think I've had better ramen, and well I haven't been to Japan yet, Ippudo may be the best in the country. The boy had the Akamaru Modern, which was so full of flavor. It was tasty, it was robust, it was bursting in every part of your mouth. The broth was amazing, and the noodles were great. I had the Tori Ramen, which in comparison to the Modern was a lot more clear. Still a lot of flavor, but it was more of a clean taste. All was really good. Best part of Ippudo is the ramen. They're perfectly cooked. They have this nice bounce when you bite into it. It's not too soft, not really al dente. So hard to explain. It's an experience! Goooo!!

If you never been and having trouble finding this spot, its the one with all the people hanging out in the front. Ê Its very safe to say there's only ONE knock on this place and its the wait. ÊWhat do you expect since they don't take reservations and its uber popular. ÊThere's a bar in the waiting area to wet your whistle but by the time the hostess seats you, mostly likely you'll be half in the bag. ÊSake is one devious s.o.b. but so good. Ê Upon entering the dining area, be prepared for a unison greeting by some of the staff. Ê(I eat late so by the time I came thru for my greeting, it was a very subdued "I've been here all day and I want to go home" acknowledgement.)

ÊA perk to ask for is the Kaedama which is additional noodles you can add to your soup for $2 (make sure you still have broth left over!). ÊOh and the Maiko Shochu (japanese cocktail) is also highly recommended! Ê The service was great. ÊHad a person in my group who was a vegetarian who doesn't eat mushrooms (I'm serious). ÊSince most of the dishes contain either meat or shrooms, our waiter patiently worked with my acquaintance to get his order just right. ÊConsidering how late it was, I give the guy credit. Ê Beer note: Typical commercial Japanese lagers but had an Echigo Stout which is a nice complement.

I have always had an hour and 30 minute wait here. ÊIs it worth it? close to it? Go for a walk and get some apps at Taisho while you wait, and you'll be hungry and ready. My brother and I went, and since we were only two people, we got sat at the bar. ÊThis added a lot to the experience. ÊThey all yell a greeting ending with "ahhhh" at the end. ÊMy brother started to join in the greeting at the night went on. Giving to the ambiance, any time an appetizer is ordered, the waiter yells it out. ÊIt gives the chefs an idea, but the order is still printed out from a machine to keep the order. Pork Buns - I would kill an innocent man for these. ÊGreat caramelization. ÊThe lettuce isn't really necessary but I guess it gives some texture and holds the Japanese Mayo there. I got the shoyu ramen. ÊAdded a poached egg and a side of pork belly. ÊAwesome soft succulent pork belly. ÊThis pig's life was honored in the way it was prepared. ÊHonestly, the egg probably wasn't necessary for the ramen. ÊWonderful broth. I got the refill of noodles. ÊGood deal, BUT it's just not the same. ÊYour broth has gotten a little colder so the overall meal doesn't taste the same. ÊI know you may have thought that you'd impress your friends and go for 2 refills of noodles, but it's just not going to be the same. I don't know if it's possible, but if I had to choose ÊI might just much on some pork buns at the bar for and hour and a half while I waited then just gotten the ramen. It's definitely a good experience. ÊStaff was great at keeping my water filled and removing completed plates within 30 seconds. ÊThanks you for making my belly happy!

When I finally went to Ippudo and tasted the Akamaru Ramen this happened; http://www.youtube.com/wÉ Ippudo is perfection. ÊIt may be my favorite meal in New York. Yes, there is a serious wait but with good reason. ÊThe hostesses' waiting time quotes are fairly accurate so my suggestion is head to another bar for a drink or you can wait in the lobby and order some Sapporo on tap (awesome addition), sake, and start eating some appetizers. They serve the pork buns and Shishito fired Japanese peppers at the bar, what what! Hopefully you are experiencing the amazingness that is Ippodo with your best friends anyway so enjoy their company during the wait and stop complaining. The place is loud and packed at all hours. ÊJapanese cheers greet you as you walk through the restaurant. ÊEverything I have eaten there is incredible. ÊThe pork buns rival David Chang's and I even embrace the smear of mayo on the bun. ÊThe Samurai ribs are perfectly cooked, tender and delicious. The signature Akamaru's broth is an intense pork flavored ecstasy. Êramen, I am all for experimenting but don't mess this up... order it. ÊYou can't help but smile with each bite. ÊIt is the ultimate high! ÊThe additional add-ons of more simmered pork, pork belly, egg etc are available but the true genius is the ability to order more noodles (kae-dama) for only a couple dollars as long as you have enough broth left. Ê I "hear" they have other ramen options but I don't go to Ippudo everyday so why mess with perfection. ÊDon't walk... run to Ippudo!!

Finally got around to visiting Ippudo after hearing rave reviews from my friends. The hostess was a bit rude when we called in advance to ask if we should come earlier than their 5pm opening time for dinner to avoid a line. She said no - we got there about 15 minutes earlier anyway, and by the time they opened, there was a long line that almost reached the next block. Pork buns melt in your mouth, and the ramen is solid - I prefer Ippudo's broth over Minca's overly greasy broth. I thought it was cute how all the waiters welcome you in Japanese when you walk in, but after a while it got annoying because I could barely hear my friend talking over the noise! The ambiance was not what I expected for a ramen place...too fancy schmancy, but really it's the food that matters, and it was GOOD.

Went for lunch and got the set of spicy ramen (can't remember the name) with a side rice and smoked eel. Êit was very very good! ÊThe ramen had a great spicy taste while the broth was very "slurpable" and delicious; a great combination of flavors that makes you want to kick yourself in the face for all the times you ate Maruchan. The ambiance was very nice. ÊThe wait staff are very nice and cute. ÊWhat more could you want? The wait can be a bit too much sometimes. ÊThe prices are "NY" prices. ÊThe only reason I'm giving this 4 stars is that I am slighted by paying 500 yen for a steaming mouthgasm bowl of ramen when I was visiting Kyoto.

They have a pork bun appetizer here that is so incredible, I would get on a Fung-Wah bus right now to have them. The rest of the food, i.e. the ramen noodles, are pretty good but nothing special.

The ramen here is very tasty. The broth is flavorful, the noodles are ok, and the veggies and other things work well together in the dishes I've had. I always add a bit of extra pork belly (because it is just that delicious). A few things: Don't go overboard with ordering. The first time I came here, I asked for a take away box and the waitress informed me that Ippudo doesn't do take away left overs...I'm kind of against this since that probably means there's a bunch of perfectly good leftovers being thrown out. Waste not, want not, folks... It is also a bit pricey for ramen, but that can be somewhat justified by the tastiness of the items. Go early and on a weeknight. I've done this and have had good success with getting a table quickly. For me, it's really not worth it to go to popular places during peak times and on weekends, but if you must go during these times, I've heard you should be prepared to wait.

Love love love everything about this restaurant. Everything lived up to the hype. The energy was fantastic. All the servers and chefs give you a huge roaring welcome in Japanese when you walk in, and a big thank you/ goodbye when you leave. Kitchen is out in the open.. I loved sitting at the bar and watching them make all the great creations. I love it when you can see chefs and where the magic basically happens. Also makes me feel like they have absolutely nothing to hide. All the chefs are always in a great mood, energetic, joking around, yet making fantastic food. Of course there's a wait.. we got there around 4:55pm, 5 minutes before they open for dinner. There was ÊHUGE line outside already. However they were able to seat half the line immediately, and it was only about a 20 minute wait for my friend and I. We passed the time fine looking at the bar which had ramen under the countertop glass, reading the "how to eat ramen" booklet, and deciding what to order. As I'm moving from NYC soon, my best friend and I planned an all day food event to try every restaurant ÊI'd meant to eat at in my 3 years here. This was stop #2 of 4, and we could only order 1 item if we were to leave room in our stomachs for dinners #3 and #4. The choice was easy: Akamaru Modern WOW THIS WAS SO AMAZING. I COULD NOT GET OVER HOW AMAZING THE BROTH WAS. IN FACT I"M STILL IN SHOCK... "HOW DO THEY MAKE IT SO GOOD????" I kept asking my friend over and over again, after every slurp. The broth is INCREDIBLE, the flavor perfect, toppings (seaweed, scallions, special sauce) add the perfect texture/ flavor, and there's just a hint of spiciness that's more of a pleasant aftertaste. The noodles of course were amazing.. I can't even describe them. Just imagine the most perfect noodles ever, and that was this. The free cup of green tea at the end of the meal was a really nice touch, and a great palate cleanser. Also gotta note.. the service was great too! I wasn't really sure who was our server as different people took our order, were filing our waters, gave us our order, and brought us our check. However, they were all incredibly nice, in great spirits, and checking up on us enough Êso we knew they cared but not so much that it was an annoyance.

Went Êhere on a late Friday night and got in right away, because this place is usually packed to the gills. Having been to Japan before i totally thought this place brought me back there.

Ippudo, you were worth the wait. On my last day in NYC, my friends and I were searching for a ramen place. One of my friends had originally been to Ippudo, loved it, so we searched for it and found it. Yes, there was an 1.5 hour wait...but you can definitely just put your name in, walk to soho quickly, then walk back...and it'll be just the right amount of time. Love the decor of this place. Round areas of tables in a kind of woody/tree feelings restaurant, plus a back wall of glass partitioned booths along a wall full of japanese characters written in a silver color, makes this place a pretty unique modern place to eat. Yes, a tad awkward to be sitting at the round tables (you face some other party of people you have no idea who they are), this place is definitely a neat place to go for lunch. To start off, we got the pork belly buns. Oh my, they were good. Yes, a tad too much mayo- had they just scraped off a tiny bit so that when you actually squeezed the bun....you didn't have mayo coming out it? then it would have been better, but still, pretty good. I got the karaka ramen. There was some pork belly in it....kind of wish there was more. Plus...it wasn't that spicy? Still, overall, pretty solid, and the broth was indeed, good. My friends got the classic and they liked it as well. I think overall, I wish the ramen was a tad more softer? I've had better Japanese ramen in LA, but I mean, for NYC, this ramen place was pretty good. I wish the ramen was a tad softer just for my preferences. The bathrooms... are awkward. I did not like looking at myself in the mirror when using the bathroom. haha. Nonetheless, absolutely LOVED the decor of the place and the ramen is pretty good. Definitely a fun stop for lunch..

Absolute truth, I've been to Ippudo more than a handful of times and it took the last visit, maybe my 6th+ time to finally remember what the ramen tasted like, but I decided to try the duck ramen which I've never had before and I was utterly disappointed. ÊBland broth, chewy overcooked duck. ÊI was so sad because everyone seems to love this place. So, in my mind, the ramen here is totally unmemorable. ÊI did try my friend's ramen which was the most popular one, the Akamaru Êrecommended by the server and it was good but not amazing. ÊThe broth was good, there's a lot going on there but I've definitely had better. ÊIppudo is definitely overhyped I think mainly due to the 1+ hour wait. ÊAn hour or more for ramen? ÊNo thank you, I was expecting unique/different/mindblowing but was very underwhelmed. The appetizers are great though. ÊThe fried chicken, cucumber salad, pork buns and tartare are yums but the ramen lacks that made-with-love-and-care broth that I really savor. There are a few other things about the place that I don't love, long wait aside, eating in front of mirrors is not my thing and the yelling when you walk into the dining area doesn't do it for me. ÊAlso when I first started going to Ippudo when it first opened, almost everyone who worked there was Japanese. ÊNow you're lucky to have a Japanese dude cooking your noodles.... I definitely won't return soon when there are awesome ramen places right around the corner with less of a wait time.

I was staying at the Washington Square Hotel and Yelp told me that there was an "amazing" ramen place within walking distance. ÊI love ramen and figured that since NY is way bigger than Boston, they probably do it well. Ê I got there around 10:30pm since my train from Boston got in later and was happy since I was seated right away at the bar. ÊI ordered the pork buns and the special tan tanmen with extra pork belly. ÊThe green tea was decent and the service was pleasant, although they did think the guy I was sitting next to was with me. ÊUnfortunately, this invited him to start talking to me (i.e. hitting on me) when I wanted to eat in peace. Ê The pork buns were amazing. ÊThe bun itself was soft and doughy without being chewy. ÊThe pork was tender, fatty, and had a rich, meaty taste. ÊI loved them - 5 stars. ÊI waited in anticipation for my tan tanmen. ÊIt came in a medium-sized bowl and I stirred it up. ÊI started to eat and thought something was wrong. ÊIt was not spicy and the peanut sauce completely dominated every other flavour. ÊThe noodles were square and tasted floury. ÊThey were not quite al dente but not soft - the texture totally threw me off. ÊI did not enjoy it at all. ÊThey did give you a lot of extra pork belly, which I enjoyed. I would not come back but search for another ramen place. ÊAll hype and hardly any substance. ÊExcept for the pork buns.

I love ramen. Ramen should be loved by everyone, especially CHICAGOANS. If you are a ramen chef and want to make lots of $$, please open up shop in downtown, preferably by where I work, and if you are an Ippudo chef, you'll make $$$$$$$$. I loved the decor. When you walk in, you're welcomed by a wall of ramen bowls, fashioned by a ton of different japanese ramen bowlmakers. If you look closely at their bar countertop, instant ramen is used to line the inside of the countertops with a see through glass over it. If you didn't know you were at a ramen place, this would be a huge hint for you. Another interesting thing is when the host brings you to your table, she announces you and all the servers yell out something in Japanese. Kudos for the special welcome. I ordered the special, a schezhuan styled noodle and the bf order the modern. Both came out with each ingredient sitting in it's own special spot on top of the ramen, but when mixed together, it creates one very special taste in your mouth. I preferred the modern over that day's special just cause it was a little too overwhelming with the schezhuan paste. But I still enjoyed it very much. I wish my belly was much bigger so I could engulf myself in more ramen goodness. I guess I'll need to take another trip back to NYC!

Finally tried this on labor day weekend. We went there at 5:10pm and still waited for one hour. We tried shiro ramen and aka ramen, and their famous pork bun. To my opinion, they r good ramen, a bit salty to my taste, but not worth 1 hour wait, not at all. If u like ramen, u can go to totto ramen at midtown(they r just opened, related to yakitori totto). and if u like pork bun, fatty crab's pork bun is by far my favourite~~

Ippudo made me love ramen. In the SF Bay Area, there seems to be a shortage of good ramen. In fact, I convinced myself that most ramen just wasn't good to begin with (the main exception being butter corn miso ramen... om nom nom). During a previous trip to New York, I casually walked into Ippudo on a weeknight at 6pm and was told that I'd need to wait two hours. Whoa. A two hour wait for what in my mind was just a mediocre bowl of noodles? No thanks. Upon making a return trip to New York, a friend of mine suggested having lunch at Ippudo. I decided to see what the hype was about and decided to try it out. I arrived at the restaurant at noon (on a Friday), where my friend had been waiting since 11:45, and saw that a sizable queue was already forming. We were seated right away in the packed dining room. I ordered the Akamaru Modern ($13), which is a tonkotsu ramen with pork belly chashu, cabbage, kikurage (wood ear mushrooms), scallions, miso paste, soft boiled egg and garlic oil. We ordered the Hirata pork buns ($8), which come two to an order, to share. The pork buns, which are simply a slice of fatty pork tucked inside a slightly sweet steamed bun, laced with spicy sauce, came first. They were pretty good, but weren't as flavorful as Momofuku's, in my opinion. Then came the ramen... The broth epitomized umami with all the tonkotsu taste, yet without the sodium overkill. The garlicky flavor was just right and didn't leave a lingering heaviness of garlic. The pork was tender and melted in my mouth. The soft boiled egg was cooked to perfection. The noodles were delicately thin and straight. The texture was just the right firmness. I finally found a reason not to lose hope on ramen. At ~$20 for lunch (ramen and pork bun, including tax and tip), it was more expensive than I'm used to paying for ramen, but it was definitely worth it. A beautiful bowl of ramen comes at a cost.

Oh Ippudo, there's a reason why you have 1000+ reviews. I made this the first food stop on our vacation to NY and even on a Wednesday night this place was packed and the wait was about 45 minutes. ÊWhat can you do for 45 minutes in a tiny place?? Two words: happy. hour. ÊKirin and Sapporo on tap and 2-for-1? ÊSounds good to me! ÊThe bf and I cozied up to the bar and enjoyed our beers and an order of pork belly hirata buns. ÊThose buns were the perfect little snack! ÊThe pork was melt in your mouth tender and the sauce had a little hint of spiciness. ÊThis bar area gets and stays pretty packed so be prepared! When our name was finally called we started heading towards the dining area and all the servers started shouting something in Japanese. ÊI guess every time someone enters or exits the dining area, all the servers yell... something. ÊIt can get pretty loud but it's kind of fun too. We were seated in the middle of the dining area along the long rectangular table. ÊI thought the dining chairs were really cute - the chairs only have one arm on opposite sides so that two can be pushed together to make a love seat. ÊMakes for some cozy dining. With some recommendations from our server we were ready to order. ÊWe had the tako wasabi to share, the bf had the Akamaru Modern with the suggested toppings, and I had the Karaka Miso Ramen. ÊI wasn't sure if I was going to like the tako wasabi but if you're a wasabi fan it pretty much tastes like crunchy wasabi. =P ÊAt one point during the meal I ended up trading ramen bowls with the bf because I liked his soup broth so much better. ÊThe spicy miso broth was pretty tasty and rich but there was something about that Akamaru Modern broth. Seriously, best ramen broth I've had a restaurant hands down. ÊThe noodles themselves were just okay, not as chewy as I normally like them, but the broth was mind-blowingly good. It's definitely pricey for a bowl of ramen but I would definitely recommend it if you're a ramen fan.

The broth was wonderful - smooth and savory. A well balanced broth, with the miso and the garlic oil working in harmony. And how can you go wrong with pork belly. I'm mean come on...It's perfect. Their Shoyu ramen was also well done. Other ramen, however, such as the Karaka Miso Ramen (spicy ramen) missed the mark. So was it worth the wait? Yes, for one time only, and the wait was only made bearable by a pre-dinner snack. Cool place, but a bit over-rated. 3.5 stars

Mostly ramen is regarded as some cheap alternative that you can buy at a super market for 4-pack-a-dollar . A lot of people don't realize that ramen has another face - gourmet cuisine. And Ippudo is one of those rare existence that offers that. Ramen is art in Japan. There are so many, I prefer to call, "ramen-smith" battling out at 3 major cities - Hakata(northern kyushu island), Tokyo and Sapporo(Hokkaido island) in Iron Chef style. Because of this, there is aestheticism to it. And Ippudo delivers it. They make noodles from scratch as I witnessed in the basement where there was a "noodle factory". When I took a bite out of it, I don't know how to describe it but I could tell that was homemade. It didn't have that, rubber-ish like texture at all. Not that it was premature, but I could feel that it was made out of flour and egg... not chemical. The dish I ordered was "kogashi miso"(smoky miso). Its milky texture with seductive taste of pork fat literally melted my tongue. And scent of smoky miso was very soothing and calming. Toppings were quite generous. ÊIt had good balance of meat and vegetable such as spinach. And also I was really impressed that a Puerto Rican waitter was liaising with Japanese chef in Japanese. In fact, everyone were liaising in Japanese no matter what nationality they were. They were keeping it real. For "real" real.

I liked ramen, never thought I could love it -- blame it on the packaged ramen we get at our American grocery stores! On the other hand my husband loves ramen, its his comfort food (yes even the packaged ones). ÊSo I thought we have to try this place with all the rave reviews. It lives up to the reviews and the notorious waits were true too. Ê1.5 hour wait for two people on a Sunday night is a bit ridiculous but luckily we didn't come in hungry but by the time we sat down we were ready! We ordered: Pork Hirata Buns -- OMG These are soo good, another reviewer said they could eat dozens of these and I concur!! Only if they weren't so pricey! ($8 for 2) Akamaru Modern Ramen -- it's where ramen meets Miso. ÊLoved it!!! ÊThe broth was rich and the noodles were al dente! ÊIt could have use a bit of kick so next time will ask for something spicy to add to it. ($13 without any additional toppings, additional toppings $2 each) Iced Green Tea x 2 ($4 each) Matcha Brulee (Green Tea Creme Brulee) -- this was pretty good - not the best creme brulee but the green tea ice ceam on top rocked ($7) Ambiance: Ultra trendy, loud, not a place to take a date you really want to talk to Service: Prompt, helpful -- all the servers greet you when you come in and bid you farwell well when you leave, also they announce the dish when they pick it up at the kitchen -- so this adds to the loudness.

They have a penchant for saying "no" to customers for off-menu requests. ("can i have a little extra broth?" "no.") ÊTheir welcome shouting scared my girlfriend a bit. ÊBut their product is very very tasty and a welcome haven on a cold day. Ê Wait wasn't that bad. ÊCute table made of the insta-ramen. ÊRIP the guy who invented that fuzz.

Yes, the wait is insane but it's completely worth it. I've been to ippudo at least 10x now and I absolutely think its the best ramen I've ever had in my life including the ramen i've had in Japan. The broth is so intensely rich, savory, and flavorful. Each bowl comes with a good amount of noodles that taste freshly made. They have a nice springy bite to them. I always get the modern with extra pork belly. YUMM! I also highly recommend the pork buns! Delicious to have while waiting at the bar for your table. The drinks here are alright. Nothing amazing. Once in a while they have amazing specials. I'm sad that they're not around all the time. I highly recommend any of these if anyone EVER sees them on the menu. Also, if you could msg me and inform me also, that'd be great!! haha 1. The crispy chicken crisp. So weird, unique, but tasty 2. Asparagus tempura 3. Pork belly on a stick Lastly, the crepe cake is amazingly good. Not too sweet or heavy. However, I have heard that other ramen places serve the same cake for cheaper. The ambiance is awesome. It's modern and chic but at the same time unpretentious. The entire staff greets you in one big shout as you're walked to your table just like in the noodle shops in Japan (there's a word for these kind of places but i cant put my finger on it). Kudos to the interior designer. I've gotten a chance to sit everywhere from the big table surrounded by class, to the communal table by the fire, by the strange wall made of long pieces of wood, and each space is comfortable and inviting. The people taking reservations aren't always the friendliest but the waiters and waitresses are always sweet and attentive.

If Momofuku wasn't right around the corner, I would probably come back to this place. As it is, I got the ramen with berkshire pork, mushroom stem things, little seaweedy things, scallion, egg and a couple pieces of braised pork belly. I did this on purpose, so I could compare to the Momofuku ramen, their signature ramen dishes going head-to-head in a battle to the death. The verdict? Momofuku ramen destroyed the Ippudo ramen like a sumo wrestler coming off the top rope onto some hapless WWF poser. Momofuku ramen: perfectly poached egg, still runny. scallions sliced to paper thinness. Fresh-tasting and slightly crunchy mushroom shoot things. A small pile of moist and delicious shredded pork neck and two slices of out of this world, melty, fatty, pink slow-cooked and moist pork belly that essentially disintegrates in your mouth. Ippudo ramen - half a hard-boiled egg. Scallions of random thicknesses. hit or miss mushroom shoots, non-uniform size and lower quality than Momofuku. Two slices of pork medallions, which are relatively flavorless and dry. Two brown chunks of what seems to be smoked pork belly? It was brown and much tougher. The fact that the pork fat and belly meat were of completely different consistencies meant that they did not unite properly in your mouth, leaving you with a mouthful of chewy meat and kinda slimy fat. Very salty pork belly, which I don't have much of a problem with. The Ippudo broth seems to be there to compete with the ingredients, it's flavored with a bunch of stuff and seems to be as much a gravy as a broth - it's milky and might be miso-based. Momofuku broth is a vehicle for the ingredients in it. It is clear, and while tasty on its own, it serves to highlight the ingredients you are eating. Cute decor, lots of japanese employees.

Hmmm.... I really struggled between 3 and 4 stars for Ippudo NY. They really should make half star systems already! I'm telling you, only in NY can people get away with charging $13 for a RAMEN noodle soup. It aggravates me after awhile how we the people are increasingly being held hostage when it comes to paying for quality food. Okay, let me get to my review. We walked in and it was a really cool vibe for a noodle bar scene. Cute, little bar selling expensive a$$ draft beer. But whatever. So the three girls tell us that it's going to be at least a 45 minute wait for 2, we gave our name and sat around. But we kept watching floods of couples flocking after their meals. Like for every 3 couples who left, they would call one couple in. It was weird and I suspected something fishy was going on. Then I thought maybe the restaurant was huge behind the wall and they were just slow to clean the tables. So about half an hour later we were seated. Let me tell you, I'm really disappointed and really pissed because so much of Ippudo is a self created hype. They sat us on the side of the restaurant against a long banquet with movable tables. There was easily at least 6 tables open all around us and we sat for another 10 minutes after ordering our food before they seated another party. They literally keep you waiting for nothing, just to make it seem like they're hot sh*t and it's soo packed inside that you have to wait 45 mins for a table!!! Wow, that really bugged me and that's just wrong! The little pork buns are amazing to me. That could have been a meal in itself if I had it my way. But I came for the ramen and that's what I got. I ordered the Modern while my date had the Kogashi. I can't believe it comes with ONE slice of pork. He didn't like his too much, but I thought the broth was really cool. It was like a black sesame based soup and just very interesting. The soups tasted a bit oily to me though. We ordered the buns, 2 ramens, 1 draft Sapporo and walked out paying $56. I don't know, but that's the most expensive bowl of instant noodles I've ever had.

Ramen is one of those foods that we think we can make at home because it's "just" noodles in broth. But boiling a bag of Maruchan isn't quite the same as fresh ramen so it feels so good to find someplace where you want to dunk into the bowl like at Ippudo. I came with a friend in the late afternoon so there was no line. Yay. The atmosphere is kind of romantic - dark and a little too sexy for me and a bowl of ramen. I guess I'm just used to those dingy places in Chinatown where you sit on cheap plastic stools and they practically kick you out the minute you finish eating. My friend and I both had the ramen with pork and shared the cucumber with pepper flakes and chili oil appetizer. So good. Bouncy noodles, comforting soup, mMmmm... P.S. Our waiter - a cutie pie white guy who looks like Adam Levine's twin - spoke fluent Japanese. How can you not love this place?

Ugh how the hell did I not review this place the FIRST time I came here? Delicious ramen. Just took some friends from DC here this weekend and I was not disappointed. The guys shared this thing of cloudy sake (I had a black plum wine that had a yummy brown sugar aftertaste) http://www.yelp.com/biz_É This is salmon tatsu-age .. so it's deep fried and served with grilled pepper, this thingie I have no idea, lemon and the mayo that I didn't touch. The salmon was PERFECTLY salted and mmm. http://www.yelp.com/biz_É BF and I shared an Akamaru Modern ramen which had more flavor. I asked for two eggs (for me, he says they're gross when they're only partly cooked) and a side of pork belly which you can see below. We ended up getting another plate of noodles cause he's a bottomless starch pit. http://www.yelp.com/biz_É http://www.yelp.com/biz_É

As other reviewed mention, this place is always busy. Get there early. For appetizer you must have the pork buns. Very light and full of flavor. The one appetizer to avoid is the Philly cheesteak egg roll. Not sure why we ordered this. It tasted like hamburger helper in a pizza roll. The ramen was superb! Perfect amount of ramen. This ranks as high as the ramen I had in Harajuku Japan. The price is about $14 for the ramen which might be a skosh high but well worth it.

The only negative aspect of this establishment is the wait. ÊI waited an hour on a Thursday night starting at 6pm for a party of 5. ÊBut I feel with any good thing in NYC, you have to wait and it was quite worth it. I ordered the seasonal special "Roast miso soup noodles" and the noodles were made with quickness and the soup was very warm on a cold winter day. The overall bowl was not overwhelmingly greasy. ÊThe items inside included seaweed, noodles, egg and meat. ÊThey could have done a bit better an added one more piece of meat than the traditional 1 piece, but the total package was satisfying enough. I'd go again but on an off peak day.

Close, but not good enough. The place was decorated in that way that Asian fusion restaurants are typically designed, but it was definitely a Japanese place.

Seriously, Ippudo serves up Miso Ramen Heaven!!! But, they need to STOP YELLING RIGHT NEAR CUSTOMERS' EARS! Yes, we get it that they are suppose to give customers a near authentic Japanese vibe with confirming order calls, customer welcomes and such. But, these food-servers (especially the older Japanese lady) need to use some common sense. To the servers: If you happen to be serving a customer his or her food, please hold off your yelling until after you finished placing the food down and stepped away from that customer. This also includes being right behind customers when walking around. Ok, I'm still giving this place 4 stars (-1 star for the near-proximity yelling) because the ramen and especially the soup is really that good. I'm super picky about soup since it's my favorite food, and this soup is over the top "Bad to the pork-bone." I really appreciated and could taste the amount of time and effort that went into making that broth/stock. This place sets the standard for how deep, rich and full-flavored miso ramen can be without punching you in the face with salt. The ramen noodle itself was perfectly sized and cooked with a nice level of al-dente. Surprisingly for me I've never ever eaten up all of my soup (usually due to its high saltiness) in any ramen shop I've ever been to before, but this place was my first. By the time my noodles were gone, my soup disappeared. Kudos to the masters in the kitchen for getting the ratio of awesome soup to noodles perfected. In the end, it was a pricey meal at $13 per bowl (or $16 for the set), but that's how much awesomeness costs. My Food Awesomeness Meter registered 100% on this meal. P.S. I'm afraid to say Ippudo beats & pulverizes my former miso ramen champion Santouka in L.A.

An average of 4 stars out of 900 + reviews has got to mean something people! The legend is true; this place is FEROCIOUS. Pork Buns are equivalent to photosynthesis, you need it to grow better as a human. I don't know how that makes sense, but it does. The Ramen is superb as well. I have no attention to details, but I mean what I say, and say what I mean - if I could, I'd eat there every week. Great stuff.

I have tried many different kinds of ramen all over Cali as well as New York. I tend to expect the noodles to look like those from an instant noodle bag, but it never seems to be the case. Anyway, after all my experiences I would say that Ippudo has the best tasting soup and great variety. So why not give it the five stars it deserves? Well it has its flaws as well... I'm not familiar with how ramen should look or taste in the Japanese culture, but I think I have a pretty good idea. Let's start off with the fact that at Ippudo you would be lucky NOT to wait in line. Me and my friend came right at 330pm when lunch hour was ending and we were told to order ASAP. We didn't have a problem with that, we were starving. Anyway, I heard that people wait up to 3 hours on Friday or Saturday nights. So avoid those nights or come super early, like right when it opens. Still, I see people waiting outside before the open sign is even turned. The interior decor is beautiful. You really get the Japanese feel. I love it. And the staff is awesome. They are so nice. They keep checking on you if you need anything as well as clear away dishes right when you are done with them. I love great service. Moving on the food! I came with my friend who ranted about the pork being the best here. So we ordered an order of two which was 8 dollars. Now 8 dollars for two buns?! Seriously? Well there was no mistake, the pork was melt in your mouth delicious. The flavor was so good. I recommend you have to at least TRY it once. I heard you could get the same for cheaper in Chinatown, but that always seems to be the case... We both order the famous ramen bowl which is the Akamaru Modern. I have never tasted this kind of soup before. It was like heaven. Most ramen places you choose from miso, soy sauce based or the garlic based soup. All with pork. But this was different. It was so delicious I can't even describe the heavenly taste of it. I basically drank most of my soup and that rarely happens when I eat Ramen. The pork was delectable... Melt in your mouth and perfectly seasoned to taste. Too bad they only give you two pieces... It was worth it though. It was REAL pork belly, not like the other stuff you get at other ramen places. Downfalls? I'm not a big fan of the noodles. They were super thin and didn't even look or taste like ramen noodles. There were curly.. Sorry I have a problem with ramen noodles that aren't curly or at least wavy. I felt like I was eating cantonese noodles. The soup made up for it though. Other downfall? One bowl of ramen noodles is 13 dollars during lunch and 14 dollars during dinner. I'm not used to paying that much for ramen. Just the other day I paid 9 dollars for ramen. I guess the soup makes up for it, but they don't seem to have a problem with people paying that much. The line is ALWAYS out the door. Bill for two people came out to be 43 dollars including tax and tip. WE ordered two ramens and pork buns. Not cheap at all. Would I come here for ramen? Only if I'm SUPER craving the special soup they have here. Come here for the pork buns? I'm not a huge fan for pork, but I would order if I was here. Would I wait 3 hours? Hell no. Not worth the wait at all. Catch this place on an off time if you want to try it. Don't wait.

After unsucessfully securing a table here on a Saturday night (without over an hour wait!), we decided to hit Ippudo for Sunday lunch. ÊThe staff was very accomodating and got us a table despite the fact that some of our party was late. ÊWalking into the dining area, I was impressed with the clean modern decor with the communal tables in the middle. Having already read some of the reviews here on Yelp about the prices, we already knew what we were in for. ÊThought still a little skeptical on how a small bowl of ramen can cost $13 or $14 bucks, we gave it a whirl. ÊAnd the conclusion... it's worth it. ÊI tried a few of the different broths, and they were all awesome. ÊThe noodles there are just a step above. ÊWe also had the pork buns, which were essentially 2 pieces of doughy break wrapped with a piece of pork. ÊThe pork was spectacular.

So I was introduced to Ippudo from my good friend Phannie. I'm not from NYC, so I can't say how this compares to the local ramen spots, but I really enjoyed the place. There was a bit of a wait, but not nearly an hour long wait that some of the other reviewers had to suffer through. Though a good tip for the starving and patient is to order an appetizer, or two, while you wait to be seated. We of course had the bbq pork buns. What self-professed lover of Asian cuisine doesn't like pork buns? Does this stack up with the best pork buns I've ever had? Yes it does. Piping hot, buns were soft, the bbq pork was sweet, but not overly so. Definitely a must have. The ramen, I can't remember which particular one I had, was very good. It wasn't too salty, nor was it too rich. It was a solid mix of taste and texture in a fairly large bowl. Don't starve yourself, but be ready to eat a good portion. My next excursion to NYC will bring me back for sure!

Salty, fatty goodness! Got there at about 6:30p last Thursday. We were quoted an hour and a half wait so we went to a nearby bar for 2 happy hour drinks. We decided to check back after 45 mins, and viola..were were next to be seated. I honestly think they inflate the wait time to build some hype and suspence. Anywho..got the pork buns, the ribs, and the Akamaru Modern. All are MUST HAVES. The pork buns were the best i've tased. BF said they tased like a BLT though lol. The Ribs were so tender and flavorful. The Modern was a little salty though, but overall great flavor. didnt add anyting to it. Overall i'd say go to Ippudo at least once. Its a cute place to take out of towners, and though $14 bucks for ramen seems rediculous...overall, its pretty reasonably priced.

Oh-my-my, Ippudo is DA BOMB !! No doubt they have the best ramen broth and pork bun. Luckily I never had an experience waiting in line because I always came like ~30mins before they were open.

We came here for lunch and it was my first time. Maybe because of being early in the week there was no line (I was told there's ALWAYS a line). When you walk into this trendy looking place everyone greets you. Pretty fun at first but gets annoying after the 10th group comes in and you just want to eat. The staff is really attentive though and really nice. The food is a bit pricey but it's expected for the location and setting. My suggestion is if you're going with a significant other just order two orders of the pork buns. Get one bowl of ramen with extra pork and then towards the end add extra noodle. Thats a money back guarantee, if my name isn't will williams (my name is not will williams). P.S. I guarantee nothing.

For my visit to this well-known Ramen restaurant, I ordered the "Akamaru Modern" with Nitamago and spicy paste on the side. The miso broth was extremely flavorful and well-adjusted without making you feel that it was too heavy. The thin ramen itself was a softer texture than I would like (texture not due to how it was cooked but rather the type of ramen that was used) but it matches well with the broth. It was pleasing enough to order a second helping of the noodle, which came with a hint of sesame oil (?) to prevent it from clumping. The pork wasn't anything memorable, nor was any of the other toppings. The spicy paste didn't add much, which taste pretty bland other than being slightly hot. At $17, I think it was way over-priced for what I got. It wasn't bad but I had ramen just as good as Ippudo at cheaper price. I prefer to give Ippudo a 3.5 because I think it was better than A-OK but not good enough that it makes me want to visit more often. In the end I decided on a 3 because of the price, the toppings and the type of noodle that was used (personal preference. the noodle was actually tasty but I prefer a harder, wavy noodle). I can understand why others gave this place a big thumbs up but for me there are other ramen places that I am more likely to have a craving for (like Totto Ramen if only the wait wasn't so long).

What can I say? ÊExpensive yes, but the food was really good. ÊLike damn good. ÊI don't know if I could come here every day, but I think I could make it a regular outing. ÊThe place is gorgeous and so is the staff. ÊBut it comes down to the broth and they know how to do it right here.

Ippudo is actually a restaurant chain in Japan, and that's where I first tried it - in the city of Fukuoka. It was some of the most delicious soup-based meals I've had in my life, and forever afterward, I searched for a proper replacement. Hence my delight at a branch location in Manhattan. Hell, it even feels like Japan, with the staff and the majority of customers being from Japan. The decor is more urban-trendy than what you'd find in Japan, but the food and service is just the same. That is to say - AMAZING. The ramen broth is an extremely flavorful, perfectly balanced mixture of complex tastes. The ramen is succulent. I'm a vegetarian, and even I could appreciate the taste of the pork that they put in the soup. You can also ask them for fresh-pressed garlic in your soup to complete the taste. Make sure to order the set meal, which comes with a little side dish of rice and various things topping it. Staff are friendly and efficient, and just like Japan, some of them are more than happy to help you and explain the whole history behind Ippudo and ramen if you engage them a bit.

The lack of 5 stars is definitely due to the extremely long wait times. However, the noodles are awesome. The menu has a good variety of interesting choices and their daily specials are definitely worth trying. I went with two friends, and it is definitely worth going with a group of friends that are not afraid to share bowls. Not only is this the most cost effective method, but the best way to find your favorite bowl of noodles. Basically, each person can order a different kind of ramen dish. You can eat that entire bowl and then ask for a noodle refill that only costs a few dollars. Once you get the refill, everyone can switch bowls and try each others. This way you get 2 meals for about 15 bucks and you can take it home too. The wait staff is extremely nice and friendly, even for such a busy place. Another possible plus is the seating arrangement. If you bring a small group you often share the large communal tables with others and that's always interesting.

A fan of Shinsengumi Hataka Ramen in Los Angeles with its tonkotsu (pork bone) soup/ramen, I had to try Ippudo which offered a bowl of ramen in the same style while visiting NYC. ÊIt did not disappoint. Ê We showed up at 3 PM about 30 minutes before they shut down for lunch and luckily didn't have to wait for a table, but the place was still full of patrons. ÊAs you enter, the staff shouts welcome (irasshaimase) in Japanese. ÊThe staff also shouts it when other patrons enter so it gets quite loud inside when there is a constant flow of people getting seated. The Shiromaru Hakata Classic ramen comes with perfectly cooked al-dente noodles in a white, thick soup made from pork bones with chopped scallions, red pickled ginger, melt-in-your-mouth pork loin cha-shu, 1/2 of a hard boiled egg, sesame seeds, wood ear mushrooms (kikurage) and braised bamboo shoots (menma). ÊA bowl was $13 which is a bit pricier than a bowl in Los Angeles but came with a few more items that would typically be add-ons in Los Angeles. Ê We also tried the Shishito appetizer which was good but not exceptional. A beer on the menu stood out as we had not seen it before so we had to give it a try. Ginga-Kogen Beer, a fruity wheat beer, has the smell and hop aroma of a Hefe Weizen with a fresh crisp apple smell, a light body and a light fruity sweetness. ÊIt was good, but more of a summer beer than something to be consumed in below freezing temperature. If I'm craving Hakata style ramen in NYC, Ippudo will definitely fulfill my need while away from Los Angeles.

got there at 2:40, 50 minutes before the end of their lunch service. ÊWe ended up being the last to sit, so it would be a 40 minute wait. ÊLuckily they have a bar and the bar serves appetizers. ÊWe shared the pork buns and I got the raw baby octopus. ÊPork buns were good. ÊI mean there were two pieces of very good pork belly and some scallions or green onions. ÊBut the filling to bun ratio left the bun unsatisfying. ÊAnd for 9 dollars it was disappointing. ÊBut I dont give stars based on a quality to price ratio (I like ratios). ÊThe baby octopus was great except for the fact that it was chopped up in tiny pieces and I chopsticks as my eating tool. ÊBaby octopus was fresh and had great texture. ÊIt was mixed in some slightly sweet sauce with wasabi in it. ÊIt was clean, fresh, slightly spicy and I really liked it. We were finally seated in a family style table and I ordered the Akamaru Modern with a soft boiled egg. ÊGot our food pretty quickly which was nice. ÊThe first thing I tasted was the "Umami Dama" miso paste which alone was pretty awesome. ÊMixed it into the broth and took my first sip of the broth. ÊProbably the best ramen broth i've ever had. ÊIt wasn't overpowering in flavors like most places, it was clean, complex, well balanced, and addicting. ÊThen I had the noodles. ÊAt first it was alittle weird because I'm use to slightly thinker and softer noodles. ÊIt threw me off a bit, but as I started eating, it really started to grow on me. ÊThe toppings were the usually toppings and worked well, I wish the pork was a little softer and the egg was slightly runnier in the middle. ÊBut as I got to the bottom of my bowl and had finish all the noddles and toppings, I kept taking spoonfuls of the broth. ÊIt was that good. ÊDidn't want to be a pig and drink it all so I had them take the bowl a way. Ê And yeah, the ramen was 20 dollars. ÊI don't give stars based on food value but yeah it's pretty expensive. ÊIs it twice as good as the ramens I've had in San Francisco and So Cal? ÊNo its not. ÊBut really good food with the best quality is always more expensive. ÊIf you splurge with burgers and everything else, I think splurging on this ramen is worth it.

You walk in, people yell Japanese in your face. You get really scared and uncomfortable, but you can't back out now - the dude's already leading you to your table. You notice the extremely trendy and fashionable decor and are pleased. You also notice that your waiter is a white guy speaking with a Japanese accent, which you find extremely hilarious and slightly offensive at the same time. You snicker at the group of fobby asians taking pictures of their food with an instant Polaroid camera in a nearby booth. You order the grilled eel and think it's great - sweet, savory, fatty, and tender. You notice the shreds of seaweed that impart a great oceanic flavor. You also eat the sinus-clearing spicy ramen - a large bowl filled with shreds of pork, leaves, and noodles - and feel satisfied. You try to figure out how to balance the bigass spoon and the chopsticks in your hands. You look like a douche in the process. You note before paying that the prices are doable - 14 dollars for most ramen. You also remind yourself to take your next first date here to look cool and hip.

1 Star for presentation, 1 star for ambiance, 1 for the awesome yuzu sake and another for the meal overall. I ordered Shiromaru Hakata Classic meal with mentaiko over rice, and Yuzu Sake - all for lunch :) Deconstructing the meal: noodle texture was just right, pork was tender and tasty. Perhaps I am being picky because I love eggs - especially when it is done right in a bowl of ramen. The egg was half cooked (perfect!) but taste was lacking that salty sweet taste in the egg white portion. Hence taking off of 1 star.

Tonight was my first time to Ippudo. The wait was 1.5 hours, and the butterface hostess was not very nice about it either. I ordered the vegetarian ramen, and also tried the regular main Ramen (can't remember the exact name). Both were mediocre. I am upset I waited 1.5 hours to eat mediocre, overpriced ramen. It cost $14/bowl of Ramen. I have had better packaged asian grocery store ramen. I never leave reviews on things, and this is my first post on Yelp. The reason I am posting on THIS specific restaurant is because this place was so over-rated that it needed to be taken down a notch.

Came here with a group of 4 people on a Wednesday night. 2 of the people were arriving at 7pm, so we decided to take part in the 2 for 1 happy hour (Sapporo or Kirin) - $6 , while we waited. Man, this place gets crowded. By 7pm there were people waiting everywhere, and with the no reservation policy, there is no way to avoid it. So the rest of my party arrived at 7pm, we let the waitress know we were all there, and had to wait about another 40 minutes before we were seated. Decided to order the shrimp bun special, chef's appetizer selection, and of course, a ramen. Shrimp buns were excellent. I could have eaten about 20 of them. My friend got the pork buns with equal happiness. The chef's appetizer selection was good, however the pork butt was the clear star. I'd skip the tasting selection next time and just order that for an appetizer. I ordered the classic ramen and my boyfriend ordered the modern ramen. Both tasted exactly the same. Not sure if it's all the hype up of the noodles, but I wasn't blown away. Yes, they were very good, no complaints. But to say its the best thing the city has to offer is a slight exaggeration. In any case, food was solid, and I'd definitely go back.

I would drape myself in their pork belly side if it was socially acceptable. Tender and soft like butter, oh so delicious and only an extra $3. Only 3 stars though cause the wait was really long (even while getting a little tipsy at the bar) and the ramen was just a-okay. Had a much more memorable bowl at Mitsuwa across the river. Probably would've been more satisfied ordering a bowl of rice and 3 of those pork belly sides. Atmosphere is nice, I guess, but dark and service was friendly but unremarkable. Would go back if I didn't have to wait so damn long.

I was expecting some great food and had high expectations. So maybe it's just me but I found that it was not worth it for the price. My ramen was good but the broth was way too salty for my taste.

There are weeks when my brother's copy of MAXIM magazine ends up in my hands. Cons? The attractive women on its glossy pages make me feel like I should be eating nothing but celery sticks. Pros? The dirty jokes and occasional articles about dope dining spots overpower that feeling. According to the MAXIM article, instant ramen was invented by a man named Momofuku Ando in 1958. Given the chance, I'd kiss the guy on the forehead. Few things can match the comfort and low price of a hot and immediate ramen meal after a night of drinking in freezing New England temperatures. Brings me back. And in their own way, the Japanese agree. They voted ramen noodles as "the number one invention of the 20th century," beating the compact disk, and even PCs. But I wasn't about to pay $20 for a reheated pack of instant ramen. I had high expectations for this place. We started with the steamed buns filled with your choice of pork or chicken, served with Ippudo original spicy buns sauce. We chose the pork. This appetizer was perfect! The bun was fresh and soft. The pork practically melted in your mouth. The sauce reminded me of spicy mayo you'd get at a Brooklyn sushi place: just the right amount of a spicy kick. Excellent. I decided to order the Akamaru Modern for the entree, since I read so much about how good it is. Akamaru Modern: 'The Original Tonkotsu' Soup Noodle with Ippudo's Special Sauce, Miso Paste, Fragrant Garlic Oil; Pork Chashu, Cabbage, Kikurage & Scallions. This was super delicious and rich. In between bites and slurps, we kept asking each other, "how is this broth so rich?" Some investigative googling told me that "tonkotsu' soup" means that the broth is pork based. So all that flavor was coming from the meat. Once I mixed it all up, the ramen made itself known. The noodles did taste different from those ten-cent packages. The whole combination was excellent. By the end of my meal, the only things left in my bowl were the two pieces of pork (pure white lard, which doesn't appeal to me). One of my friends (who is a vegetarian and got the special off-menu dish) kept saying, "I don't want this to end!" while eating her meal. So this place satisfied all of our taste buds. My only complaint? I lacked some spice. Next time, I'll probably get the special spicy sauce you can add in to the ramen bowl. Or maybe I should just carry a bottle of hot sauce in my purse.

Previous Ramen Experiences include: - Momofuku Noodle Bar - Ramen Setagaya Japanese Culinary Expertise: minimal, big fan of salmon sashimi and green tea mochi. I think I came here with my expectations set too high. After reading the raving reviews, I decided to visit this noodle shop to see how it compared to my previous experiences at Momofuku and Setagaya. I'll get straight to the point - the Modern was way too salty. I'm not gonna lie, the first 3 spoonfuls of chewy noodle bliss and soupy warmth were delicious and almost converted me to be a ramen fanatic. Unfortunately, after the 4th bite, my water glass was empty, and after the 5th bite, I started wishing that the bowl of soup in front of me was actually a big bowl of.... cold Snapple peach tea.

Pros: Amazing and authentic tonkotsu ramen noodles. Pork belly buns and ramen add-ins are great. Complimentary hot tea at the end of your meal.. Cons: Ridiculous wait times are almost guaranteed. Having to sit next to and across from strangers. The ramen here is probably the most authentic ramen I've ever had in the United States. The first time I ate here, I instantly knew I would be a regular here. The broth is absolutely delicious, the noodles are always perfectly cooked. I don't like the bamboo shoots so I always leave them out. Sometimes it isn't enough to just take them out yourself, since the juices leave a slight taste in the ramen. Today, they had a special ramen with toasted garlic oil that was absolutely fantastic. During lunch times, the prices are slightly cheaper, and there is the option of getting the set with a rice bowl and a small salad. I've tried the chicken and the pork rice bowls and they are both quite good. I think the ramen portions are the same, so it's a good deal to come here for lunch. Waiting 2 hours to get seated is the price you have to pay for this amazing food. Thinking about moving closer so that I can run down and put my name down and come back easily.

This month, I went on my ramen quest. My ultimate ramen experience was in Japan, and people keep telling me that it's hard to find the same quality over here. That being said, I reconsidered my expectations as to looking for the next best thing. Ippudo is like an elite ramen house, almost impossible to get into. The first time I tried to sample the fare, they told me there was a 3 hour wait. (this was around 8 o'clock) Finally, I got into Ippudo without the 3 hour wait. We went here around 5:30pm and got seated almost immediately. It was already starting to get full around that time and that gives more justification to how awesome Ippudo is. I tried the Akamaru Modern Ramen with the soft-boiled egg. The tonkotsu broth was rich, delicious and not overly salty. It had a familiar taste to the Filipino "batchoy" dish. The noodles were on the thin side. (Momofuku noodles win by a slight margin) But overall, the Akamaru lives up to its name. You have to mix the broth and noodles with all the other toppings for a complete, amazing experience. If you're a ramen newbie, this one is a definite must-try. My friend tried the Karaka Kogashi Miso Ramen which was pretty much a spicier version of the Kogashi Miso Ramen. I've never tried a Miso Ramen before and I thought that it would taste like miso broth. I could probably be wrong about my idea of a miso ramen but this one, I certainly didn't taste the miso. The broth was dark, thick and spicy, with a bed of oil on top which my friend found a little disconcerting. I've had spicier broth before but this was enough to get you sweating. The hirata pork buns were gorgeous. The pork was not as fatty as the ones at Momofuku and they use mayo and a special sweet-spicy sauce. The sauce begins sweets and leaves a spicy note in your mouth. Food was amazing, they had good sized portions for what you're paying and the ambiance is cool, hip and upbeat. The only downside is the wait, and for me that's very hard to overlook. The staff would yell welcome in Japanese and only a couple of them were Japanese so that was a little weird. In a perfect world, you can get in Ippudo and be seated within 5 minutes. But it's not. Is it worth the 3 hour wait? Maybe if you had something else to do, or you can walk around the city for 3 hours. I would probably just go earlier. Nobody makes me wait for my ramen. :-)

Over-hyped. The large booths make for a very impersonal (just trendy) experience of dinner with a group of friends. Tried a couple of the appetizers (small) so not great for sharing. Everyone in my party (5 all together) ordered something from the ramen section of the menu. Overall, we all have a palate for lighter-fare, we thought the broth was too salty. While the taste was good there are definitely more ramen joints with less pretense and lower prices in NY to try. Fun Fact: Make a point you might be able to spot workers making ramen in a window leading into the sublevel prep-kitchen. Sorta cool. Happen upon their lower level even if you don't need to use the bathroom as you might get to sneak a peek into the window of the prep-kitchen of workers making ramen.

This was my first meal in New York. It was my first time in New York, aside form a 7th grade field trip here, and coming from California, I was surprised to see so many Japanese in New York who live there... Ippudo was so good! Their tonkatu broth is very thick, and it was perfect in the freezing New York winter... waited for about 20 minutes though, and I literally came straight from the airport with my luggage and met up with some friends here. So the broth was good. Get the ramen for sure. Expensive though.. but I guess that's New York!

The food lives up to the hype. Ippudo has over 1600 reviews from mostly satisfied customers for a reason. Their tonkotsu broth is unreal and the noodles are pretty sport on. They stew pork wonderfully and make a lot of the little things like karaage and agedashi tofu very well. My friends and I split the three kinds of noodles on the menu, the classic, the akamaru, and the spicy one. Each was unique and worth trying. Their pork buns, though not as decadently rich and fatty as momofuku's are still good and worth getting. Here's where they lose the star: we got there at 5:15 (they open at 5) and already had to wait an hour. Then my tea cost me $3 with no refill and the cardinal sin was the waiter was clearly rushing us. I waited my damn hour, if I want to take my time to eat leave me alone. He tried to take our appetizers away before we were done with them and was noticeably hovering around when we were almost done with our noodles. As he took them away he spilled some soup on my shoe to boot. FANTASTIC... I wasn't huge on his fake japanese accent either. Ippudo's food is good enough to make up for the unprofessionalism of their staff but until they get that together I'll never be one of the true fanboys. But I guess they already have 1600+ fans so they probably don't care.

Ive tried three time to get into Ippudo. Saturday we tried again, we were 40th in line in my estimation, but got in because they hold the booths for larger groups (we were six) which worked in our favor. The waitress was wonderful, we added 2 more people 15 minute in, walking into Ippudo without a wait must be the greatest feeling ever, after we got the OK from the waitress. We ordered the pork buns and shishito peppers. The pork buns were slightly different from Momofuku, not with as much fat, topped with mayo and a sweeter sauce. Still very good, but I preferred Momofuku. Shishito peppers are always good, no need to comment. I got a special ramen, roasted miso base which you can add chili oil to or not. Only good until the end of February apparently. ÊMy broth was amazing, very homey and not too heavy. Adding the oil makes it very heavy, which my friend didnt enjoy and instead ended up drinking my soup. ÊIt comes with the usual, a little pork, bamboo shoots and half cooked egg. The ramen is made fresh, if it is, I cant tell the difference, which is fine. Was it worth the wait? ÊI feel like your day has to be planned around getting there on time and getting in. I will definitely go again, try the modern or the classic. But there are other ramen places to try such as Totto ramen so Ill get back eventually...sooner rather than later I suspect

Ay dios mio. I sigh and close my eyes when thinking of that delicious ramen. ÊAt the first sip of broth, it was as if a show choir of flavors was dancing complex, gorgeous choreography in my mouth while singing "yes! yes! yes!" Ê I ate at Ippudo for the first time last night. ÊIt wasn't my first time going; I must've stopped in at least 10 x before but couldn't put up with the wait. ÊThis time I must've found the right time pocket because I was seated within 15 minutes of arrival. ÊI think it helped that I was alone. Ê This food was so good that I couldn't bring myself to brush my teeth for hours after the meal - I just wanted to hold on to it, especially since they don't do leftovers. Ê(The flavors won't be as good, which I can see, actually, since as the broth cooled it was less tasty.) It is worth the wait, and I miss the taste so much that I'm going back tonight.

Didn't even have a chance to eat here because the wait was so long, and the hostess was pretty rude. Ippudo, if you're reading this you need to get a better/friendlier hostess because mean people like that turn customers off from coming back.

So I finally had a chance to check out this place and compare it to Minca which is around the corner from my house. I'm going going to write a lot since everything possible has been already addressed in the 1600+ reviews here. Here's the verdict: I like the broth better at Ippudo, but Minca has better pork belly (more tender and juicy). The noodles are great. The egg is decent, but it's better at Setagaya. The pork buns were good, but I feel the Momofuku ones are better. The wait sucks! Almost 2 hours when getting there at 7pm on a Thursday night. Some drinks on the menu that sound like mixed drinks are actually fancy martinis. If you're not feeling like a martini, definitely ask before ordering. So now I need to figure out how to combine all my favorite items in one restaurant. ;)

Mediocre at best when compared to LA's standard for Asian food. ÊThis is why I often skip any suggestions from friends to have Asian food while in NYC. ÊI mean, west coast is like a skip and a hop away from Asia, not to mention we're full of illegal immigrants from Asia (I'm Asian, so i'm allowed to make such comments. ÊPlease do not try this at home if you're non-Asian). Ê I do appreciate the dcor and ambience though, but other than that.. aaah.. it was okay.

This is most definitely 5-star ramen and among the best in NYC. ÊHowever, if all you are craving is a bowl of good ramen noodle soup I think I'd prefer a simpler, quiter place like Minca, as the long waits and noisy interior (constant overenthusiastic yelling of "irrashaimase!" & other things by the otherwise friendly wait staff) begin to grate on me over the course of dinner. ÊSeems more gimmicky than genuine in this case. But what makes Ippudo stand out to me are the large variety of soups as well as the great appetizers. ÊI'd probably come here much more often if it wasn't for the long wait. ÊHowever, if you are even slightly a fan of soup then you absolutely must try Ippudo, long line be damned.

Super excited to eat here. It did and did not live up to its hype. Ordered the Akamaru Modern. I enjoyed the overall dish. Very sophisticated and delicious. The broth was so rich and flavorful. The pork was sweet,salty and just down right bad ass! the egg was well prepared. I was very disappointed with the noodles. They were like chow mein noodles and were very thin. Slightly over cooked as well. I enjoyed the meal but really had better ramen here in the bay area. San Fran. The pork bun aptz was nothing compared to Momofukus pork bun. all in all a nice hot and flavorful bowl of ramen. Pretty expensive and long wait but nice decor and very friendly.

Some annoyances are just worth dealing with though. We arrived at the restaurant at 11:45 AM on a Tuesday and didn't have to wait, but I'm used to waiting an hour or more to be seated at Ippudo and to me it's worth it, because I think Ippudo serves the best Ramen in NY. We started out the meal with some pork buns which are no bargain at $4.50 a piece ($9 for an order of two) ÊHarvey was comparing them to Chinese pork buns that can be bought for less than a dollar in Chinatown, but the quality of most Chinese pork buns just isn't on the same level, and of course, these are made with tender pork belly and not sugary Char-su. The pork on the buns at Ippudo really melts in your mouth, and the schmear of mayo adds a nice counterbalance to the salty sweetness of the pork. Served with a sprig of lettuce on a rice bun, this is more akin to a sandwich than the pork buns many of us are used to. The flavor is intensely stimulating, one is really enough but at the same time it would be hard to say no to seconds. Richness of flavor is one of the themes at Ippudo, I highly recommend people with gout completely avoid the entire block of 4th Avenue between 10th and 11th streets, lest they expose themselves to meaty pork vapors emanating from the restaurant that could dangerously aggravate their condition.

Ippudo. You are great. Best ramen I've had in New York. I want to give you 5 stars, but you only get 4, and this is why: 1. You're expensive. Ramen's supposed to be cheap. Not $14/bowl. This ripoff would not work anywhere else on the planet. 2. If you were based in California, taste-wise you would be considered above average at best. 3. Your waits are comparable to Disneyland waits. 4. You have white employees screaming hello and goodbye in Japanese. Would you want Chinese people screaming hola at Rosa Mexicano? What about Black people screaming ni hao at Momofuku? I'm not trying to be racist, it's just weird. So that's why you get 4 stars. You'll get 5 if you get rid of the screaming white people.

I have attempted to come here three times but the line wait was always 1-2 hours. Ridiculous@! For ramen!?!? Or so I thought. I meet my friend at 7 on a Tuesday night...and this is seriously the best ramen house I have been to. It beats the ramen in Japan and Hawaii. I got the miso ramen. The noodles were perfect. The broth was perfect. Not too salty and still had flavor. The chiashu was a good size. Perfect perfect perfect. ÊThey added a spoonful of ginger on top and it was perfect. One tiny complaint...the bowl is huge. Split it with a girlfriend. Beware however. When I left the restaurant at 8.30 the wait was already up to an hour and a half.

Being from Los Angeles, I'm use to having lots of options with great Japanese food, Daikokuya in Downtown L.A. has by far THE BEST RAMEN. ÊSo when I was in N.Y. I had to try Ippudo, I was not disappointed at all. The atmosphere is very hip and alive, there was a 30 minutes wait to be seated, but we knew that ahead of time. As you walk to and our of your table, all the staff screams welcome and bye accordingly. The Hirata Buns are a great option for appetizer, I tried the pork and was VERY pleased with it. The Ramen are very good as well, I would say they go head-tohead with Daikokuyas' Ramen. Ippudo does have a better vibe. My only complain would be with thebar, i ordered a few Cranberry and Bodka, to be disappointed. Apparently they use shots for the drinks, they are not strong at all. The service impeccable though. I'm glad I got to try it.

I'm obsessed with this place. I think I'm addicted to the Akamaru Modern (with nitamago) the way crack addicts are addicted to crack. That pretty much sums it up. My fiance and I just moved here from California a few months ago and we've brought everyone who has come to visit us to Ippudo at LEAST one time. For extra food crazed guests (like Char & Kevin) we ended up having 5 meals here... during their 7 day stay. Nuts, I know, but it was great. We lived in LA and SF so we've had tons of good Japanese food throughout our lives. And although Ippudo is a little more fancy and trendy than the typical Japanese ramen spot, please don't let any of that discredit the deliciousness of their food. Now that we've been here a zillion times, I think it's safe to say that our hands down favorites are: Yamitsuki Goma Kyuri (Chilled cucumber with sesame oil) Pork Hirata Buns Akamaru Modern w/Nitamago (and hard noodles) Sigh. Writing this review is making me want all of this food right now. I have a feeling we're going to end up there tomorrow night... Can't wait.

This review is long over due! My brother took me here when I last visited NY, and that was last winter. :( yeah.... Well, over all I really liked the feel of this place. The atmosphere was nice, the service was decent, but the food was bomb. We had a party of 3, and we waited about 20-30 minutes to be seated. I didn't mind the wait, since I have waited longer at some restaurants. YOU MUST ORDER THE PORK BUNS!!! It's hella good. We also had the "Shishito" the fried peppers, good stuff. We also ordered the fried zucchini/cucumber.. I think it was zucchini. It was a bit on the salty side, but I think that's how it was supposed to be. I ordered the "Akamaru Modern" it was mega delicious. The meat was so tender! I think it was good for the price, been craving some ever since I got back to CA.

Being the impatient person that I am, I never thought I would EVER wait more than 45 minutes for food in my life. ÊNormally, I would be "on to the next one" however, Ippudo, you have proven me wrong. ÊGood things come to those that wait. ÊCorny I know, but two hours and counting, you were worth every minute of that wait. ÊTo pass time, my friends and I went to some Yakitori place a few blocks over to kill time [also quite good - but I cant remember the name - somewhere on St. Marks]. Ê But back to you Ippudo - ÊI went with a group of 5 and we ordered a bottle of Sake [Kamoizumi] Êand two plates of the Shishito to start.

would give 3.5 if possible. Although the restaurant current has a 'B' and is a bit pricey for what it is, it is still a great place. For Ramen alone, the spicy is by far the best. ÊBut some of the ramen's don't pack as much flavor and the some of them have thinner noodles (my preference is for thicker noodles). ÊThe chicken wings, pork buns and other dishes are great too.

I love the ramen here... but i have to say... i would wait any day for their pork belly buns.....

Here's a thought, just take it in for awhile. If I wanted to know where to find amazing ramen in New York City, I would a) Listen to locals who talk about starving kids in Africa even though they are taking the time to write food reviews and then recommend going to a different but equally expensive and smaller ramen house...when there are starving kids in Africa b) Read Zagat's c) See where Japanese ex-pats eat in New York and follow their lead I choose answers B and C because everytime I go, the service is amazing, the food is consistently great, and everything I've tried off the menu pleasantly suprised me. I suggest going for the ramen but the shrimp and croquettes are also wonderful and the sake selection is amazing, try kanzansui. I will admit that now that the restaurant hired American waiters, the service has dropped a bit, but compared to other restaurants of its size, it does a great job of making everyone feel special and slow service is quickly corrected.

It's a Ramen noodle place. I'll keep this simple: 1. Classic Ramen noodle bowl costs $13 2. Really great noodles and broth. High quality ingredients. 3. Prepare to wait a long time to be seated unless you are just one person and can sit at the bar. 4. This is not a small "noodle stand"-type place. This is a full service restaurant. It's nice inside. Great place if you're willing to spend the money.

Oh glorious glorious Ippudo ramen. So delicious. Okay, I'm not going to lie when I say that I dream about this place. Actually, as I'm writing this, my mouth is watering and my stomach is starting to dance. Ahhh. I've been here very many times now and it is beautiful every time. My favorites are the miso ramen (SOOOO GOOD), the akamaru ramen (the pork in this one is seriously melt-in-your-mouth status), and the pork steamed buns (same pork as akamaru, i think this one tops Momofuku pork buns). All of the other ramen I've had has also been delicious so I don't think you can go wrong. Oh, once someone ordered the ramen salad and was a bit disappointed by that, so maybe don't order that. Beyond the food, the space is beautiful. I like sitting in the booths best and am a bit bummed that they took out the counter seats that looked over the chefs. The people who work here are also beautiful. Literally and figuratively. You figure that one out. Worst thing about this place is the wait. Avoid going at peak hours, esp on Fridays and weekend, unless you want to wait up to 2 hours for a seat. Lunch time is probably best.

Ippudo is very Japanese - as in pretty much the entire staff, kitchen and front of the house, yells "IRRASHAIMASE!" at you as you come in and "ARIGATO GOZAIMASU!" as you leave. ÊOkay. ÊI know this is traditional, and I'm sure that it makes Japanese expats, students, and businessmen feel right at home, but it made me feel a bit of pressure to perform. ÊNot too huge - but still, be advised that you will be shouted at, and there's no ill intent behind it at all. Anyway. ÊI've been going to Menkui-tei for my rainy/snowy-day ramen fix because it was cheap, cozy, and delicious. ÊI went to Ippudo once with a friend who hadn't had real ramen before and we both liked it. ÊI went again for the purpose of reviewing and was not disappointed. ÊThey had a seasonal special, tonkatsu shoyu ramen, and it was amazingly good. ÊThe broth was deeply flavored and porky, not at all oily, and subtly flavored. ÊI should have saved some and asked for extra noodles, but I didn't have too much time to stick around. It's a bit pricey for what you get, though - $13 for my bowl, which seems to be average if you just want ramen. ÊI usually skip the set meals, which means rice + salad with your ramen. ÊThe menu has other things which I haven't tried yet. I can't rate this higher than Menkui-tei for a few reasons: - Price - Really dense-packed (Be prepared for semi-communal seating if you're eating alone) - Not really the best noodles (they're not circular in cross-section like most ramen noodles, and weren't nearly as springy as they could be) Do go to Menkui-tei for: - 2nd dates or thereafter - The extra noodles ($2 for more noodles, just save your broth) - Amazing quality broth - Srs bzns Japanese experience (including a full bar) It's worth a shot - but I still think Menkui-tei is cozier.

delicious ramen and pork buns, and don't forget to try the dessert! Our group got the matcha brulee and sweet tofu, both were excellent! We were amused by the container of sesame seeds on the table that you could grind yourself into your ramen while we were waiting for our food to come. Service was quick and waiters/waitresses were friendly. One overheard us talking about wanting to get some bubble tea after dinner and suggested a good place nearby (St. Alps's Teahouse which is about a block away from Ippudo and has great bubble tea!) Minus one star for the ridiculously long wait. Had to wait almost 2 hours (got there Friday night a little before 8pm), so you might want to try heading there earlier in the night and not Friday/Saturday.

Absolutely DE-LICIOUS. I haven't had a ramen dish here that I have not absolutely loved, whether it was a creamy or more broth like ramen they were all fantastic. I would definitely recommend anyone go here over Momofuku. The complexity of the dishes make every sip a new experience. I absolutely would try their specials since they often put a nice twist on the menu staples. One dish that they had which I wish had made it to the regular menu was spicy tempura shrimp buns. My one complaint and the reason that I cannot give Ippudo 5 stars is the fact that they will make you wait a minimum of 30 minutes no matter what time it is or how busy they are. I have been both for dinner and lunch and both times it was the same wait. It was slightly disappointing to walk back to the dining room and see the number of empty tables present when everyone was crammed into the small waiting area around the bar.

I've been wanting to come here for a while now, but I was pretty disappointed. We started with Samurai ribs which had a sweet orange based sauce which I didn't like because I thought it was too sweet. My friend liked it though. It was cooked just right with the meat easily falling off the bone. We tried the Kogashi and Shiomaru. The Shiomaru was really salty and the broth was so thick it was almost gelatinous. Tonkotsu is supposed to be thick but not like that. I liked the Kogashi better. The broth absorbed some flavor from the vegetables and I think the sweetness from the vegetables balanced the saltiness of the broth. The noodles were forgettable. They didn't have that chewy texture (koshi) that I expect good ramen to have. Ippudo is also over priced. I paid $30 for mediocre noodles, rib appetizer and a beer. If I want good ramen, I'm going back to Rock Meisha where they import their noodles from Hakata. My friend said he would have prefered to go around the corner for $6 ramen at Menchanko-Tei. The plus side of Ippudo was that it had a nice ambiance. I liked the communal seating and the service was very attentive.

ÊIt fit perfectly, as we had a chance to grab some wings and beer at the bar, and the hostess was kind enough to wait for us to close out our tab before taking us to out table. Keep in mind, you won't get a table to yourself, as it's a bit picnic table style seating wise, but you'll hardly notice the other people at your table. ÊThe ambiance and decor was slick, and there's a vibrancy to the restaurant as the hosts loudly yell out to the kitchen every time new guests enter the dining area. But again, it all comes down to the ramen. ÊIt isn't particularly cheap, but you can absolutely taste the quality. ÊThe broths are amazing and the braised pork is ridiculously good and worth the extra money. ÊOh, and it's nearly impossibly not to get the extra noodles.

Oh Ippudo, you did live up to the hype. ÊSure, you didn't have a great deal of variety, and some of the portions were a bit small for the price, but we loved everything we ordered, so clearly there was sufficient choice for us. ÊAre you prices higher than the average Japanese noodle bar? ÊAbsolutely. ÊBut, I dare say the overall meal was very much worth it. Our meal started with Hirata Pork Buns, with lettuce that was so crispy, it was the perfect complement to the savory pork and the soft, sweet bun. ÊNext, we opted for the Cream Croquette after seeing our neighbor enjoy an order. ÊThey were incredibly delicate and crunchy at the same time, and they melted in your mouth with every little bite (and I do mean little - it was quite a small portion). Finally, the main attraction: Akamaru Modern and Kogashi Miso. ÊThe first, salty and earthy, the second sweet and unctuous. Our one issue with both, however, was a real lack of vegetables or variety in the dish itself. ÊA large bowl of savory broth and ramen is certainly a happy dish, but the bits of pork, cabbage, etc. were not sufficent to create a real taste variety throughout. ÊStill, we really enjoyed them, and I would happily recommend the restaurant to all.

I had just gotten off the train at Penn Station and let me tell you, the ramen here is very excellent. Reasonable prices for fancy NY ramen. My bowl was around $11. I also got steamed pork buns, and they were quite good even though they looked like tacos and weren't necessarily "traditional". I think this place is a good date spot. The atmosphere is just right, and the wait staff was excellent.

My bf and I were craving some asian food after days of eating at trendy, expensive restaurants. ÊI heard that Ippudo is great for ramen, and it was near Soho shopping. ÊWhen we got there, however, I was surprised by the trendy/mod music, lighting, and decor of the place. ÊI was expecting something more down to earth and traditional. ÊWe waited about 30 minutes on a Saturday night to be seated for dinner. Ê We got the Maguro Carpaccio with spicy mayo drizzled on top as an appetizer. ÊI liked the fried garlic chips, but did not like how the spicy mayo overpowered the fish taste. I ordered the Akamaru Modern ramen with mustard leaves on the side. ÊThe noodles were so chewy and perfect, and the broth was savory and hearty. ÊMy bf got the Soy Sauce ramen, with a soy sauce broth. ÊHis noodles were the curly, more cooked ramen whereas mine were straight and chewier. ÊHe got the pork belly, and it was so tender and delicious. ÊI would highly recommend adding that to your bowl of ramen. ÊI liked his broth more and my noodles more. Ê This place is really great if you just want a good bowl of ramen. ÊI just wish it was less trendy.

I met with my friend from MI for early dinner. ÊMy friend told me he has been to all the four Ramen shops around this neighborhood, except this one. Ê The decor of the establishment is upscale. ÊAs soon as you walk in, there is the bar and hostess to seat you. ÊUnless you are in a large group, expect to share tables with strangers, which is cool, because you get to meet new people! I ordered Shiro and my friend ordered Tori-shio Ramen. ÊI also ordered Hirata Buns with Pork. ÊI order this to compare with Monofuku. ÊWithin few minutes, our pork buns came. ÊI tried to take a picture, but it was too dark inside. ÊSo we tried it and we agreed that Momofuku pork buns were better. ÊDon't get us wrong, it was good... I think it all comes down to the individual's preference and taste. ÊWhile the port bun was great, we both preferred the Momofuku because the meat inside the bun was thicker than Ippudo. Ê The ramen was excellent. ÊThe broth was smooth and nice. ÊThe noodles itself was little different than your typically ramen noodles, but it was still excellent. If you are in NYC and craving for Ramen, check this place out.

If you need a noodle fix, go here. (period) I Êtell you, I love my ramen stop-shops in Tokyo and Honolulu and Los Angeles, but if you want great ramen on the East Coast, it's very hard to find. ÊThank god for places like Ippudo, which is not only authentic and delicious, but is also in a very convenient location. Go for the noodles. ÊAlthough the wait was a bit long, the $6 mugs of Saporro and Kirin make up for the down time (forty minutes!). ÊMy friend drank a Lychee Martini that was definitely one of the better ones I've had in the city... it was very strong -- Cointreau, Sake, Vodka, Lychee... very good! The waitresses were very nice to talk with, and made some excellent recommendations Êboth while we were waiting and also while we were being served. ÊThe pork buns are EHHH, but that's not why you go here. ÊAgain, I know I've said it multiple times, but get the Akamaru (which is very typical) and some spicy sauce on the side!

Yes, this is a relatively expensive place for ramen, but what I love is that each bowl is a distinctly tasty dish, making multiple visits worthwhile, and each one an opportunity for a new and unique experience. This is not always the case, as ramen places may often try to serve you an assortment of ramens under the guise of different names - but in the end, you get the same broth with the same noodles, with only varying pieces of meat or vegetables or what not to distinguish one from the other. Not the case at Ippudo. ÊNot only is each broth a distinct entity, but they pair each broth with a different kind of noodle. ÊAlthough they prefer that you stick with the recommended noodle for each broth (esp. when you order the Kae-Dama - $2 for basically another full order of noodles? Gotta have it, so don't drink all your soup up front, and save some for a 2nd serving of noodles!), they will pleasantly acquiesce if your heart yearns for something different. My favorite is the Kogashi Miso - deep, richly flavored, making no excuses for the decadent heft that lingers on your palate. ÊI like the noodles that come with the more subtly-flavored Shoyu Ramen, but more because of nostalgia - they remind me of the kind that were ubiquitous throughout my ramen-eating childhood (albeit primarily the 99 cent instant noodle kind). ÊBut seriously, I've tried all except for the Tori Ramen so far, and you can't really go wrong with any of them: they are all fantastic and wholly satisfying. I hate lines and will make every effort to go during off hours, or by myself to secure a quicker spot at the bar. ÊNote that the 5p-8p happy hour (2 draft beers for $6 at the bar? Bring a friend!) is just another reason to eat earlier, makes the time waiting for a table pass more quickly, and definitely tempers the sting that comes from paying almost $15 for ramen. ÊYes, it still stings even if the ramen IS that tasty.

I wish they had more ramen places in Boston but this takes the cake. Fresh noodles, not-as-salty broth, and damn good pork buns. Please, get the pork buns. Granted I've only been here once, I can't stop thinking about it. Two cons - 1) It's $14 a bowl. But when you consider the fact that an extra ball of noodles is $2, word of advice---don't drink the broth and order extra noodles (if you're hungry). You're essentially eating two bowls of ramen for almost the price of one. My friend's friend tried to go for 4 but stopped at 3. Goodness. 2) The long wait. There were 5 of us and we waited about an hour for lunch. It was worth it though. I know there are a ton more ramen places in the city but as of right now, this is on the top of my list. Oh and great service too!

I took my sister here on her first visit to NYC. She's from Seattle and they don't have ramen restaurants there, let alone any specialty Japanese restaurants that serve food other than sushi. We had to wait a long time -- longer than was estimated but it was okay. The waiting area by the bar was tight but bartenders are very responsive. Ambiance was great. A hip vibe without feeling too fake. I got the wasabi ramen. It had just the right amount of wasabi -- enough that you can taste it but not so much that it would make me start crying. Noodles had a nice texture. We also got the buns as an appetizer. We got chicken because my sister doesn't like pork. I think the pork ones would have tasted better but the chicken was okay. They have seating areas suitable for large groups but I'm assuming it's hit or miss whether you'll be able to get one in a reasonable time. I would recommend coming here at non-peak hours. I walked by Ramen Setagaya on the way to Ippudo. There was absolutely no wait at Setagaya. If I knew I had to wait so long at Ippudo, I would have just eaten at Setagaya.

This was our last stop during our NYC trip. We got there right around 11.30am on a Monday and there was no wait. Service was incredible. We had like 3 people waiting on us probably because it wasn't busy yet. We started out with the pork belly buns.The buns were nice and warm. I was caught off guard by the iceberg lettuce. I took it out because I'm not a big fan of iceberg lettuce, reminds me of nasty Big Macs. The braised pork belly was like butta in my mouth. Nice little appetizer before the Ramen. I ordered the Akamaru modern which has the tonkatsu bone milky broth and a side of spicy miso paste. This definitely added an extra dimension to the broth compared to the classic. You could really taste the pork bones and can tell that it has been simmering for long hours. It had a very pronounced pork flavor. They did not overly salt the broth like most places to compensate for the flavor. I had asked for a poached egg on top.. which made it even more creamy and heavenly. The intensity of all these flavors together was nirvana. The only reason why I did not give this place 5 stars is because I prefer the texture of the crinkly Ramen better. The noodles they used tend to taste and feel a little too starchy to me. I'd have to conclude that this is so far the closest to Ramen I've had in Japan. I have tried the more popular Ramen places in Cali such as Daikuya, Santouka, and Shen sen Gumi but Ippudo reigns supreme. I will be dreaming about this place.... Definitely worth the hype.

I have learned something about myself: Êauthentic Japanese ramen from a ramen restaurant is way, way too salty for my tastebuds. ÊI have had ramen from Ippudo, Santoka (in Mitsuwa), and Batten Ramen (in Fort Lee). ÊAnd each time I finished a bowl of ramen from these respective joints, my initial-gut reaction was that it was incredibly salty. ÊBut everyone else seems to like the ramen that they had just consumed. ÊSo I either go along with their sentiments or don't say anything at all because I don't want to be the party pooper. ÊGroup think- oy vey. But upon further reflection and having the benefit of hindsight, I have concluded that I will not consume soup noodles in a restaurant. ÊEver. ÊIt is always too salty. ÊJust give me a bowl of Jahjangmyun instead. Ê The pork buns are good here. ÊAs good as BoSsam's pork buns.

I know that an entire army of people have already rated this place, but out of honor and respect I must give it an official review. I love this place with all of my heart. It has become not only my favorite ramen spot in Manhattan, but also my favorite restaurant period. Ramen is amazing and I love how there is a new special on the menu everytime I go. I usually go for it and am never disappointed. I love the al dente noodles and the broth.... oh man the broth... Just to top it all off I can't forget about the pork buns. My girlfriend and I have contemplated coming here one time and creating a meal out of 4-5 orders of pork buns, but we can never do it... that ramen is too tempting

I heard stories about the wait time so we decided to get here early. We got there at 4:50 not knowing this place opened at 5 on a Saturday (they don't take reservations). ÊThere was already at least 20 people waiting in line waiting for this place to open. ÊBy the time the place actually opened, the line was all the way to the end of the block. ÊI felt like I was waiting on line to get into a club! This place is kinda pricey, but has the best ramen ever! They place makes their own ramen fresh in house.

Look there's nearly friggen 900 reviews of this place of course it's the popular place to be going right now! This Japanese ramen chain has finally landed and it's gotten many rave reviews. ÊI've been here a twice, once the wait was way too long and I ended up getting too hungry and moved on elsewhere. This seems to be the case with more than a few people I've spoke with that have come here. After my second attempt (a 20 minute wait) I was seated in the side room. ÊThe place is definitely much larger than it seems. ÊWhen you first step in you are in a fairly small waiting area with a bar that'll keep you occupied while you wait. The ramen here is definitely delicious and better than some of the other popular ramen places in town, however I will say this. I'm definitely glad I didn't wait the 2hrs plus that I've heard others have done. ÊIt's good enough to justify a 20 minute wait, but seriously it isn't worth it for anything longer than that. After dipping into the broths of my dining companions (ramen broth you sickos!), I'm glad I ordered the Akamaru Modern ramen which I found to have the greatest taste without being overly heavy. ÊIt's definitely a delicious choice on a cold day. If you get seated in the side room you'll have the fun of trying to read the giant mural that flutters with the draft. It's nearly impossible. Someone tell me what it says! Decor here is the typical simplicity found in many hip Japanese restaurants and most of the seating is bench seating which makes it easy to have a communal meal with friends. Staff are all super friendly and attentive coming around exactly when you need it. ÊEven if you're full just try to save some of that broth as I'm sure someone at your table will more than happily add the extra ball of ramen noodle and finish up for you.

Double the price to that compared to southern california, but I guess one shouldn't compare. ÊThe ramen itself was twice the price and the extra noodles were twice the price. Ê There were many different broths available and I chose the Shiromaru Hakata Classic which was the first item on the menu. ÊThe original pork broth. ÊI didn't get a choice of how I wanted my noodles, I'd prefer not to have the hard noodles, but that is what I got. ÊMy choice of extra noodles were of the same caliber, not to my liking. The wait as everyone mentioned was very long, however, the bar can help the time pass. Before I forget, the appetizer of Pork Buns & Chicken Buns were pretty tasty.

I love eating ramen, after discovering that eating real ramen versus instant ramen is a HUGE difference. Based on reviews here, the food should be amazing, and it pretty much was! Unfortunately, you aren't going to be the only one who wants to try this amazing food.. Coming here on a Thursday afternoon at around 1, there was already a crowd of people waiting to eat ramen. A table for two? "Approximately 30-45 minute wait." I was dead-set on eating here, so I was willing to wait the real time of 25-35 minutes. BTW, the place looks really cool and really mellow - black panel places, a bar with ramen underneath a glass case! Nice... Anyway, finally was seated and had their food: Hirata Buns: You really cannot come here without trying their much raved buns. $8 for 2 buns is somewhat pricey, but quite delicious nontheless. The buns were nice and hot, with a delicious piece of pork that was sweet, offset with a nice creamy sauce. Hmm.. it actually just melts in your mouth when you eat it. Akamaru Ramen: The ramen to try at Ippudo - AMAZING. The broth was perfect. When I usually eat at ramen stands, the ramen is overly seasoned with salt . Not the ramen here - you taste the flavoring of the broth along the noodles which are neither too soft nor too hard. Only sad thing about this dish is the one piece of nice tender pork... Wish it had more of it... Aka Miso Ramen: My friend ordered this and this was quite good as well - hmm... nice flavoring of the miso, was quite delicious. YUM. The ramen and the food in general isn't really cheap, since each ramen dish is around 12-14 dollars. However, it is kinda worth it if you are in the mood for great ramen!

The miso ramen here is absolutely to die for! When I studied abroad in Tokyo, I ate ramen 3 or 4 times a week at little divey places that students frequented, and only ventured to the real great ramen places every now and then. I have to say that this place is on par with the greats! The Akamaru Modern is also really good, as is the Ippudo salad, as strange as it is to see salad at a ramen shop. The green tea brulee is a great way to end the meal. Try to go on an off day/time as the wait can be a pain. But, trust me, it's worth it!

Ordered: 1. Pork buns appetizer- decent for the price. Tasty pork. 2. I don't remember the ramen names but we got their specialty with pork which was good. I liked their ramen better than Shin Sen Gumi which seemed al dente. The thicker than usual broth with garlic flavor was TASTY! I ended up splitting a 2nd order of ramen with my friend for $2. It is added to your existing bowl of broth. Ambiance: Cool place for parties or even a date. Semi-dark..enough light to see everyone and menu, BUT dark enough for a lounge/club feel. Waited for 45 minutes for 2 people to sit at the bar. Enjoyed watching the chefs cook. Didn't eat the cucumber appetizer but it looked tasty.

Their ramen was "ok" in my book. I guess I heard a lot of hype from others about this place so I expected it to be amazing. I actually prefer a more traditional ramen, and it was overpriced for what it really is - a bowl of noodles. I didn't care much for the broth, but I'm willing try a different dish next time.

The wait here is ridiculous. Two of us came for dinner on a cold Wednesday night around 8ish, and had to wait over an hour to be seated. I think that the hostesses artificially inflate the wait time, because there was ample space available by the time we finally got to the back and were seated. We order the and pork belly with egg and cucumber for appetizers, and they were both awesome. Don't know how you can go wrong with pork belly, and the cucumber was served with crispy flakes on top and a special sauce. Stuck with the original ramen for dinner. A little bit expensive for what it is and how much you can get it for elsewhere, but very filling nonetheless. Also, servers here treat you like you're part of the assembly line. Appetizers shot out within minutes of ordering them, and were taken away the second the last piece was finished. Understand its a crowded restaurant and they're trying to hustle everyone through, but its almost too efficient.

You know how researchers starve rats for a long time so the food that they use to condition them becomes the best thing that ever happened to them? Many moons ago, my friend came upon my yelp reviews-- "ARGHHHHH HOW CAN YOU GIVE IPPUDO ONLY FOUR STARS??!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"?. That said, I returned to this place last weekend ready to have my mind re-blown by their ramen. The wait was long (they said 45 minutes, it took more than an hour). Although I can't expect much when I come in on a Saturday night. I'm not good with waiting. My mood becomes exponentially worse when my hunger begins to rear its ugly head. We politely asked the woman at the desk how much longer it was. Her response was a cold, bloody stare. The other woman at the desk shuttled back and forth between the bar and the kitchen delivering drinks. A bit of name confusion w/ another friend we bumped into (Hi Eddie!), shuffling, and bad words later we were seated. We were seated across from a huge mirror wall. I suppose it's nice watching myself eat. We ordered the pork buns, the akamaru modern topped additionally w/ Kakuni Ê(MEATTTTT), and the special ramen. The pork buns were delicious. Although it's 8$ for two fist-sized buns. My akamaru modern was sooooo rich. The only thing stopping me from picking up the bowl and spilling its contents into my mouth was how hot the soup was. Special was good as well. Our waiter was polite and quirky. At the end, I was happy and bloated with sodium. But I wouldn't have had it any other way. 5 stars for food, 1 star off for the wait.

The following sentence probably sums up how I feel about Ippudo NY: We went there twice in one week, bringing friends the second time to show them how great the noodles are. I must admit I was a bit dubious initially - being a British girl and I don't think I have ever queued for an hour for a table at any place before (outside of New York). I mean, in that hour of waiting, I could probably find something that will equally satisfy my needs (I.e. Be fed). But the first time, wait we did. And I'm so very glad we did! You are asked to wait in the bar area which even at 5pm on a Sunday was extremely crowded. But generally people are good natured about it and it's a bustling atmosphere. When we were seated, I was struck by the chic decor - not my usual type of place for a bowl of noodles. We ordered and waited for our food, which arrived in about 10 minutes. And wow! The noodles are cooked to just the right point - firm, not soggy. And it's a very good quality noodle. But it's really all about the soup (and very good evidence is my friend who drank all the soup, to his disappointment as he then couldn't have kae-damae - add more noodles). I don't think you get many toppings with the standard bowl, but I think this is perfect as it really is about the soup and the noodles. The other noodle dishes are just as good, between us we have tried 4 different types off the menu. But for me, the best is the classic. Mmm, I think I want to make it three times in a week...

ÊIt turned out to be the best seating in the house!!! ÊWe were able to watch all the chefs prepare and cook all the appetizers including salad, pork buns and my favorite item to look at...the rice burger. ÊThe majority of the chefs were Caucasian which I thought was really cool and they would all yell at each other in Japanese just like at other Japanese restaurants. Ê Ok so the pork buns were amazing. ÊI think that if I just ate 3 or 4 pork buns I would of been happy without ramen. ÊBut then came the ramen...my Akamaru Ramen. ÊA delicious broth with chewy noodles, half a boiled egg that was slightly oozing and a piece of rich, fatty pork belly.

I am torn. The ramen (Akamaru modern, spicey tonkatsu) here is delicious. ÊI am giving Ippudo a 5 for the soup base alone. ÊThere is just something so rich and wonderful about it that if i gave it a 4, a part of me would die. ÊI have tried other ramen joints, Menkui Tei, Setagaya in the city but the soup there just can't touch Ippudo. Ê Now the noodles, I personally prefer my noodles a little bit thicker (they are thin here), but to me they are still pretty great. I do not like how they refuse to give u extra noodles until after u are pretty much done with what you got in the bowl (they do not want the extra noodles to lose their texture or traditions sake). ÊBc by then all the pork and stuff is gone! It is pricey for ramen and there is a huuuuge wait but if you go on an off hour it is bearable.

Walls covered with a bunch of different ramen bowls? Well... helloooo heaven! If I had to choose something to eat before I died, Ippudo's Modern Ramen would be a contender. This place has been raved to be the "best ramen in NYC" and I think it may be true! Love: *the huge ladle *fatty yet light broth - it's not heavy, so I drank every drop! *fresh hand-made ramen noodles made on site! *pork buns *great wait staff The wait was so long - we probably waited about 45 minutes even though we got there around 9pm! However, the wait is well worth it. We ordered the pork buns to start as an appetizer and according to one of my friends' cousin was "the best thing I ever ate in my life". That says something right there. After quickly devouring our pork buns, our ramen found their way to our table! Like I said above, I ordered the Akamaru Modern Ramen which had a nice strong garlic flavor. $14 for the Akamaru, but totally worth it. This is a "must eat" whenever I have the chance to go to NY again!

BOTTOM LINE: Some of the tastiest ramen I've ever had, and obviously a must-go no matter what your palette favours. Arrive early to avoid the line-up. Cost: -$20 for lunch (tax and tip included). Atmosphere/Decor: -Chic enclosed "bamboo" garden with black and red hues. -Communal tables abound with benches, so be prepared to get comfy with your neighbour. Ordered: 1. Akamaru ramen: Recommended by the waitress and apparently their most popular ramen. The soup base was flavourful and thankfully not too salty. The ramen was very good with right amount of chewiness without being too doughy. You can get a refill of ramen for a small price if you still have enough soup leftover. The pork was just alright. 2. Unagi don: Pretty standard affair . . . wished I ordered the pork buns instead given all the rave reviews! Ê Service: -Fairly standard, polite, but obviously a well-oiled machine of moving people in and out at a brusk pace. Conclusion: -Come here for some of the finest ramen you'll ever have!

I had the Akamaru Modern. Their ramen was good; the broth was swimming in umami, but I still like Menkui Tei better. Maybe because Ippudo's broth is too greasy? I have say that their desserts are delicious. The Annin Tofu was heaven melting in my mouth and the Matcha Brulee was also pretty awesome.

I wanted to give 4 1/2 stars, since I don't usually give 5-stars, nor have I had a reason to. *** 1/2 Akamaru Modern Chapter 2- Like any truly good ramen, it needs to evolve, and it needs to grow and develop until it reaches perfection. I hear it was either the egg or the meat that was added since Chapter 1. Obviously, as an Akamaru, it is a red soup, with a sesame flavoring. The soft, fatty pork piece adds well to the broth. Amazingly, even the noodles seem to have their own flavor--as I watched them downstairs preparing since, which seemed to be layered and compressed; freshly made. This created a bowl of ramen that is full of flavor in every bite, even offering you different flavors depending on what you eat. It was good, but I'm still looking for a ramen that is outstanding in variety and flavor. If you don't drink the soup, you can ask for a second ball of noodles for $2. Atmophere There is a lot of yelling, greeting customers, but also about two or three other cheers. The staff also answers each call. The decor and style is outstanding here. From the entrance, using dry ramen as a display, and the noodle bowls on the wall. From here, there are at least four distinct seating areas. One has a stylized tree hovering over patrons that dine alone. The booths have raised kanji lettering. There was also a different theme in the farthest seating in the back. I was seated on the wooden bar, with a curious motif of charred logs in the center. Service I actually enjoyed the fact that the staff was multi-ethnic and not centered upon one genre--I know this makes service more dynamic and interactions different as well. The fact it is near Union Square, the clientele was also similarly diverse. They had a nice and cheery, energetic waitstaff. They didn't bother us too much, but were available when we needed them. Amenities My only concern is the basement restrooms--since people who drink and women in high-heels will definitely have trouble with this. The restrooms were one of the best I've seen, with a multicolored Kabuki mask design built into the wall. Conclusion This is one place that proves that a restaurant is more than just the food it serves. A restaurant is the whole package--it is the look and the feel of the place; it is the people you have working there interacting with customers; it is what you have to offer that other places do not. This makes Ippudo one place you need to visit when you're in New York. You'll get good food, unique and entertaining service, sitting in a room with beautiful, artistic style. They are definitely in the right direction as a restaurant.

3.5, but i'm rounding up. i got the akamaru modern, like everyone suggested, with the braised pork belly. definitely DO get the braised pork belly - it's totally worth it. i think i would've been sorely disappointed by the ramen otherwise. the ramen was really good for the first few seconds, but then the incredibly salty broth hit me. ughh, way too salty! i actually had lukewarm water instead of cold water, so i poured some of that into my broth. it helped a little bit, but i realized that there's something about the flavoring that i just don't like all that much. the ramen itself was quite good, but it was intermingled with this black seaweed-like thing that i also didn't like very much. sad. the service, however, is really good. the waiters and waitresses are all very attentive and friendly. they have a really GOOD attitude - not overbearing/overfriendly (which i really don't like), but polite and nice. as soon as we entered (at 11am - seriously, going for lunch totally beats the rush! we got seated immediately), they all let out this huge cheer in a foreign language (most likely japanese). it was a really warm welcome and i was pleasantly surprised, but it was a little off-putting. it got REALLY off-putting when it happened every couple of minutes, effectively interrupting my conversation with my friend the way an incoming train would. summary in a short list: pros: - DO get the braised pork belly. tender, delicious, amazing. even the fat is yummy. weird, huh? - attentive, really good service - beautiful decor; i envied the people sitting in the booths - very large bowls - you won't leave hungry (i didn't eat breakfast) - salad's wasabi dressing is quite good - lovely tea at the end of the meal; they do NOT try to rush you off - bathrooms are pretty and clean cons: - their warm welcome gets annoying pretty fast - extremely salty / too flavorful broth - i personally don't like the black seaweed-like things - ramen not really worth it without the extras - set is not necessary (i got the grilled eel on the rice; i didn't finish anything and i felt bloated) - mmm, overpriced, i think. all in all, definitely worth going to at least once. but if you're a poor college student, just once should be enough until your status changes.

There is a full-on Ramen war going on, with Totto being the latest to join in the fray. (Reminder to self, go eat there). It took me awhile to get to Ippudo and now I understand the wait outside and the $14 bowls of peasant food. While definitely more expensive than your average bowl of Ramen (lose 1 star), it really does distinguish itself from other Ramen places with its rich creamy broth. So rich you can see a layer of oil (or fat?) floating on top of the soup base. Order the extra noodles cuz it's certainly not enough with what they give you. I'm a fan and will come back but I'm going to search around for something comparable in taste but lighter on my wallet. And perhaps lighter in fat too. Now that would be 5 stars. Hey, eating healthy is always a bonus.

Again, such a sucker for a place that has good decor. But not only the decor was fun (think ramen filled counters, bowls on the walls, shiny things...) the food was delicious! We started out waiting for a table (which, please read the review below)- and ordered 2 buns. These buns are amazing, very flavorful!! We got seated and ordered a bowl for each person and they came our fairly quickly. Very worth while!

I really enjoyed this place. ÊFirst of all, we were there early enough (5:30) on a Thursday that there was absolutely no wait. ÊThe service was incredibly good from the beginning, and just got better. ÊOur waiter, who was apparently also a bar tender, happily made drink recommendations beyond what was on the menu and was super friendly and genuine. ÊThe food was great. ÊThis is real Japanese ramen, which I haven't had since I left Japan three years ago. ÊThey accommodated my request of no pork (either whole or ground) with no problem whatsoever (for strict vegetarians, the broth is still pork-based). ÊMy miso ramen was excellent... the noodles were perfect. and I loved the addition of spicy ginger, sliced green onions, and spinach. ÊTasty broth just like I remember from Japan. ÊI couldn't even finish my bowl and did not need to order extra noodles. ÊAll around excellent experience. When we left around 7, the entranceway and sidewalk outside had filled up and there was already a long wait. ÊShow up early and you can sit right down. Ê Yes, it's a bit pricey for ramen (the miso ramen was about $13), but it seemed worth it to me. ÊPretty average prices for Manhattan.

I have stepped in ramen heaven....now it will be difficult to go back. I have been ippudod along with the other 1400 or so yelpers. The menu is simple, the ramen is out of this world. I had their signature ramen, can not remember the name. The noodles are home made, you can see them on the lower level, the large machine, churning out batch after batch of finely extended threads. The process is simple yet complicated, there are a few people behind the kitchen. The last guy, I will call him the dresser, starts with the bowl of noodles and soup and adds the magic, whatever that may be. Intricate combination of flavours that can not be quite placed but its amazing. I am considering getting a job in the kitchen to learn what they do. Do go for the extra braised pork, its incredible. Staff is extermely friendly and professional. What to say, I'll go to bed dreaming of Ippudo and hopefully I can savour it again in my subconscious.

Pluses: * Good noodles. Deliciously flavorful broth. * Extremely trendy interior! Japanese staff yelling Japanese across the restaurant add to the atmosphere without being boisterous * Very efficient and attentive service. Food is brought out quickly despite the restaurant being extremely busy. * Kaedama done right - I'm always disappointed when I don't get the option of kaedama being brought later and am merely given a super-sized bowl of ramen, so I was happy when my server gave me the option of requesting my kaedama when I was almost done with the first helping of noodles. When the time came, I merely glanced across the room at my server, and she brought a plate of freshly cooked noodles within a minute. Minuses: * No gyoza!?!! Ramen and gyoza go together like PB&J. * Finishing all the broth left my throat irritated for several hours. I am not very sensitive to MSG, so I suspect there was A LOT of MSG in the ramen. * Pricey. Paying $13-$15 for ramen, which I continue to think of as the fast food of Japan, simply feels wrong.

The broth is so fulfilling, but that's about it. The noodles are literally RAMEN? Well not for all the dishes, but the most famous/ippudo noodle with ippudo sauce. ÊIts pure ramen. We also ordered the tuna tartar which was delicious, but deserved more lotus chips. I asked for a refill and they said the chips will cost $2. ARE YOU SERIOUS? Theyre worth NOTHING. I can buy a whole dam lotus in chinatown for less than a buck! Of course i said HECK NO. ÊWe also had the galbi dish, which was just as yummy, but def not worth the money! Their pork ration in the noodles are cheap, along with the eggs. I honestly did not think it was anything much special. But you get filled up if you had appetizers. A word of advice: make reservations, otherwise you'd be waiting at their bar area which is cramped as heck, for about 2 hours for a table. RIDICULOUS. I think this place is just WAY overrated. You want asian food? or good noodles? for a cheap price? go to chinatown. you want to overpay? go to ippudo. I will not be coming back.... anytime in my lifetime, if ever. its not bad, it just was not worth it. i came because of hype, which is always a bad thing unfortunately.

Came here for dinner this past Wednesday. I cannot believe how much wonder the small door hides behind. I was greeted by a room full of people gathered by the bar sipping on drinks and nibbling on edamame and pork buns. Holy cow, are people in New York that starved for a bowl of noodle soup? While we waited, I had a lychee drink which was so damn strong I had to send it back to be diluted with some soda water. The pork buns and edamame were delicious! Some of the best I've ever had. Finally after an hour long wait, we were brought to our seats which we joined another party of 3, a couple, 2 dudes who came on their own. It was a bit strange but whatever. Aside from the 2 appetizers we've had so far, we also tried their special which was asparagus wrapped in a thin slice of pork. Tasty but not salty and just the right crispiness. I tried the Akamaru Modern as was mentioned by so many previous Yelpers and I am very pleased. Get the egg for sure!

My tactic - go to Ippudo at any time during the day and put my name down for the time I want to come back. It totally works and my group and I are only waiting 10 minutes when we get there.

I waited outside in the freeeezing new york weather for 45 minutes before they opened for dinner, for what? To be the first table of the night! YES! Everyone is cheering and in all a hullabaloo when you are seated, and I now know why they are so excited. The food is life-altering. Nirvana of the palate. Even if you snorted a line of coke and smoked a big fat doobie before you came here, the food couldn't possibly be any better (Disclaimer: I'm not recommending that you do the aforementioned). 15 minutes after I sat down at my table, the wait to get a table was already Ê2 hours!!!!! They are not giving food away, Kim Kardashian isn't in town. It's just a typical night at Ippudo, you know, just seducing the hell out of your tastebuds. Ê Before I get to the ramen, I want to tell you all about the most euphoric moment my taste buds have experienced heretofore. ÊThe PORK BUN. I want to liken it to something, but since I already talked about blow and pot, I'll refrain. I'll just say, that if you wait the inordinate amount of time it takes to eat here, do yourself a favor and have some pork buns. Then have ramen. I got the Karaka Kogashi Miso Ramen. I wish I could travel back in time and be in that moment when I tasted it first and almost burnt my tongue. If you're a growing boy and you're really hungry, you can ask for more noodles, Kae-dama. Gosh, I feel like having some noodles!!

Waited an hour and half, expected. Nice atomsphere, friendly staff, food came out decently quick. Had a beef lettuce wrap appetizer (so so), pork buns were fantastic and better than momofuku in my opinion as its more meat and less fat with a tastier sauce combination. As for the ramen. Delicious full flavor broth, but honestly wayyyy too much fat in it. I felt like shit after eating it although it was very tasty. I would reccomend this to anyone because its delicious but I warn you about the insane amount of liquid fat in the broth, overwhelming for me even though i drank the whole bowl and finished my girlfriends too. Will i come back? Probably not and the noodles arent chewy enough.

What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said. I hardly ever go to this place because the wait is obnoxiously long. Always. They will tell you that you have to wait 90 minutes or more without blinking. And it's been that way for years. I'm taking a star away for that. Surely they can come up with some better way to handle demand. But the soup & noodles are really, really lovely. This is what you go to Ippudo for. The pork buns are some of the better ones I've had as well. Other things I've tried are just so-so. And some specials have been not good at all (Kalbi beef appetizer last time I was there was rubbery.) In my mind, they're the only game in town for ramen. And I do enjoy ramen. But not so much that I want to wait in an uncomfortably crowded bar area for such a long time. So if I happen to be in the neighborhood with something else to do, I'll stop by Ippudo first and put my name down. Then head back when I'm done with my other thing. They're usually about ready to seat me when I get back there. I will say that the people at the host station are very nice & patient given all the juggling & maneuvering through the constant flood of people that they have to do. Thumbs up to them.

It's hard to say something original about Ippudo, when there are over 2,000 reviews on the place already. It's crowded. And cool. But sometimes it's worth it to brave the mad throngs for a sip of their rich broth. Keep in mind that this place is best known for its tonkotsu-style soup, which is pork-bone based. The results are heavier than salt- or soy-based soups. Sometimes that's a good thing, sometimes bad... just depends on your mood.

Is it good? Yes. Is it wait one and a half hours in line good? No. More of a 30 minute wait kind of good. The one in Tokyo is less trendy, but far more reasonable of a wait. As with practically everyone else, I recommend the pork buns and akamaru modern. I just wish the noodles were thicker. Broth is excellent, however.

I really have to say, after going to Japan, It is hard to find a place that makes good Ramen!! But Ippudo didnt disappoint. The first time i been here was for my birthday...I heard so much about it that i really wanted to try...When my friend and I got there...there was a long line. We waited about 1-2hrs before we were able to get a table, but that didnt stop us from waiting. After we gotten our table, I looked around, and the mood of the restaurant was different from ramen places in japan...this seemed a little more high-end i would say? I ordered the Bakatsu tofu..and also the akamaru ramen and also the pork buns. The Bakatsu tofu was ok, but the ramen was really good. I really liked the pork and the bamboo shoots. The noodle was cooked just the way i liked it..not too soft, not too hard. Al dente? lol..the soup base wasnt salty like i expected, most japanese ramen soup are very flavorful, since the noodles arent cooked with the soup, so the soup base must be strong...in order for the noodles to soak in the flavor After finishing my bowl of noodles, my friend and I shared the pork buns...omg....let me tell you....those pork buns are amazing!!! It was so tendered...and juicy..from there on, everytime i go there, i would order those buns!!!!!! Oh...and the Matcha brulee is must order dish as well....im a big fan of brulees and Matcha....so i couldnt say no to that...and plus...its dessert...XD....it was really good, not too sweet, and the matcha flavor was strong...so i really enjoyed it!!

Waited for 1.5 hours for a party of 3 at 7PM and it was worth the wait compared to the LA ramen shops that also have long waits. Ippudo is 100 times better than Daikokuya in LA in my opinion. The soup isn't as salty and they use a different kind of noodles-- it's thinner. I never had real Japanese ramen, but I think this is as close as I can get to it in the U.S. I tried the Hakata Ramen, Miso Ramen, and their Special Cold Soba which didn't come with soba noodles but ramen noodles which you dip in a spicy sauce. For a hot NY night, I prefer the cold soba over the hot ramen. I've also never had soba that way before so it was a nice change. Everyone talks about the pork buns, so maybe I will try that the next time I'm in NY.

I don't know much about japanese ramen, but I know a lot about what tastes good. ÊThat said, I did not really enjoy the ramen I had at Ippudo. ÊThe broth was too "milky" and felt too heavy. ÊThe noodles didn't really make up for what I felt the broth lacked. ÊI struggled to finish it. ÊThe edamame appetizer was entirely undercooked as well. ÊAdd that to an hour wait on a Saturday afternoon and I'm pretty sure I'll never be back here again. I also tried the pork buns that everyoner raves about. ÊI did like the slight spicyness of the meat, but I prefer the fattier and more substantial meat portions of the pork buns at Momofuku Noodle Bar.

I live in Japan - I have eaten ramen in almost every major city and small towns along the main rail lines. In total I have eaten at 32 Ramen Shops in Japan. I can say with authority that the ramen at Ippudo are very good. The noodles are definitely on par with what you find in a lot of ramen shops in Japan. The broths are fantastic! The tonkotsu broth is very rich and creamy without being greasy or bland. The only criticism I have is that you are paying double the price of ramen in Japan. You will have to wait a long time but that's the price you have to pay for a very rich creamy perfectly done tonkotsu broth. Setagaya... hmm I am not sure how anyone could be happy to announce they like that place, it's marginal at best. The noodles are definitely not fresh and the broth is just not as evolved, complex and flavorful as Ippudo. I will say that ramen like all food is completely subjective, but some thing are recognized as "standard". Ippudo has done well in New York because the founder took a lot of time to study Japanese and American tastes and what you get is something universally tasty. Some people might not like it but that's as authentic as you will get.

yumm yummmmm! I didn't realize how big this restaurant was! Last time I came here at around 10pm and it was closed :C but not today! I came here for lunch. I had the tori ramen, chicken soup with slicked pork .. idk don't really remember what it's called but it was so good! I love the noodles especially because of its thinness. The waitor was so friendly, I love how all the staffs are so energetic! Walking downstairs to the restroom, you'll pass by the kitchen. I got to see how the noodles were made which was super neat!

1)Wait time for a ramen around 2 hours during weekends 2)Service is outstanding but the ramen isn't as good as it gets. 3)Ramen is edible, but not exciting. 4)Lots of asians but I didn't see any japanese there. 5)This place is overhyped

BEST RAMEN EVERR! Worth the wait? Absolutely yes unless you are dying of hunger, then please get a quick bite anywhere in the area and return, yes, return and wait yo ass for a delicious bowl of ramen. I love the noodles here and the broth. My favorite is the spicy miso. It comes with a little pile of freshly grated ginger atop that you mix into the broth. I was skeptical at how the ginger would add to the broth but it Êadd such a delicious bite to the soup(and i love ginger). The appetizers are not even bite size, more like micro size. The hirata buns are okay. I think baohaus buns beat momofuku's and ippudo's. I think ippudo has the best ramen. I've only been to ken's ramen (Boston), Batten Ramen (Fort Lee, NJ), and Santouka (mitsuwa supermarket in NJ) so I haven't been through all the ramen joints Êbut have you ever discovered something so amazing that you don't dare look elsewhere because you are absolutely happy with your find? Yea, that's sort of how i feel about ippudo.

All I can think about after eating at Ippudo is PORK IN A BOX (aka Kakuni). The small box of braised pork belly you can order with your soup is one of the best things you will ever put in your mouth. Next time I come I might skip the soup and order 4 boxes of pork..... glutenous? I thought the soup was very good but I couldn't help but feeling that the broth needed an extra something (I'm thinking an acid). The pork buns were of course very good but I could do without what I'm pretty sure is McDonald's special sauce they put on them. Best plan is to show up 10 minutes before 5pm so you skip the giant line.

This place is OVERRATED! Ive walked past this joint many times but was always turned off by the line. One day I finally stuck it out and waited nearly an hour before my gf and I were seated on a Sunday. I ordered the Miso Ramen and I have to admit the broth was nice thick and tasty just the way I like it. A also added the chicken tandori topping for $3 which was a total rip-off as they probably put 2-3oz of it on top. Overall great Miso Ramen but not the best and definately not worth the price (eg Momofuku Noodle Bar). Minca in the EV is much better. I have to admit the decor was beautiful. Overhyped, overpriced and feels like a tourist trap.

Ippudo is a nice place to go if you're really craving ramen and not in a big rush. They don't have pages of choices, but the ones they have are pretty good. I have come here for a couple of times already in the past and stopped by again yesterday for lunch. The wait has always been pretty long--at least 20 minutes each time, sometimes longer. When you first walk in, the waiters/waitresses greet you loudly in japanese and seat you pretty close to strangers. You could be seated right next to them, so it can uncomfortable to some people. In my experiences, however, everyone minds their own business and don't invade in your space. The lighting is dim, but bright enough, and its quiet enough to have good conversations. I went for lunch yesterday, which is basically the same menu as dinner, and I THINK the same prices. Some people are really hyped about this place, but I think it's okay. The ramen is good, but not like extraordinary. Definitely better than some others though. They say it tastes just as good as authentic Japanese ramen. I actually got to go to Japan last year, and I definitely think Japanese ramen is better. There, they always add this delicious egg to their noodles. I remember eating it for the first time and craved it everyday after for like a week. Ippudo has the option of adding an egg, but it costs extra. One thing I like about it though is the Kae-dama, where they let you add an extra serving of noodles for $2. Make sure you have enough soup left though. They let you do this in Japan too, so I thought it was cool. Anyway, I'm not crazy about this place, but I still end up coming here occasionally because I love their rice dishes. They are sides of rice with toppings (such as eel, roast pork, chicken, etc). Delclious! My favorite one is the roast pork one and I get it everytime I go. I'd come here just for those.

This has to be my fav. ramen places of all time!! --outside of Japan of course! Everything from the pork buns to the sake is amazing!! Everytime I think of the the perfectly seasoned broth my mouth starts watering!! As soon as the food hits your mouth you honestly forget how long you waited to get seated and drift into some sort of food nivana! The service was great and decor was cute and pretty cozy--it is a great date spot--has all the right lighting, if you know what I mean! I also believe it is a chain in Japan that they are expanding into the US-- Delicious either way!!

You love PORK? ÊThis is the right place. I mean seriously... SERIOUSLY... I FEEL TERRIBLE FOR: 1. ÊJewish folks - being kosher really blows if you knew how good this place was 2. ÊVegetarian folks - i mean really? you don't know what you are missing out here 3. ÊPescatarian folks - ::sigh:: think of this as the freshest and tastiest fish, but like MILLION times better 4. ÊPork hating folks - you are a retard ok... sorry, i had to get that out. yes the wait here is excruciatingly long sometimes, but just go karaoke for an hour and voila! Êwaiting is not so bad! I believe the best ramen to get there are either 1) Shiromaru Hakata Classic 2) Akamaru Modern You can always add additional toppings. For me best toppings to add are: 1) Kakuni(braised pork belly) 2) Menma(bambooshoots) Also, make sure to try their pork buns..... It makes me sad writing this review cause I am not eating all this goodness right now. T_T As always, go give it a shot. ÊIt's popluar/famous for a reason and I really believe it's worth the hype/wait. Oh and one last thing... i don't know if this is worth anything, but my friend who's been to japan said this was the best ramen he had outside of japan.

After wandering around NYC in the snow for 4 hours, the only thing I was craving was a big bowl of warm something. A friend suggested we try Ippudo and although we were warned about the long waiting time, we still decided to give the restaurant a shot. I mean if there are that many people waiting to spend more than $10 for a bowl of soup, it must be some bomb soup right? Luckily we were seated within 15 minutes of arriving. My assessment of the ramen is that the broth is a tad too salty which I hope is not attributed to an overdose of MSG. Hands down, Ippudo's ramen noodles (which they make downstairs) are the best and freshest I've ever tasted! Although I wasn't keen on paying more than $10 for a bowl of ramen, I was pleased with the service and wait staff. I was especially impressed with the attention to detail that went into decorating the restaurant: the wooden walls with little slits cut out for you to look outside, the translucent geisha wall in the bathroom and faux fireplace in the center of the communal dining table are nice accents to achieve a chic dining atmosphere.

I end up coming to Ippudo once a year. I personally don't think it's worth the 2 hour wait and wish I could enjoy the ramen in an un-invaded, quiet environment. I've had the Akamaru Modern with the egg and pork and the pork buns. They are great but not amazing. This place is too mainstream for me.

Everything about this place is cool. It is very well designed, the food is awesome and the atmosphere is great. We had to wait about 40 min for a table. Not a big deal, we enjoyed a couple of shochu drinks while we were waiting. Most of the dining consists of big tables and chances are, you'll be seated at a table with other people. I'm a pretty private person but the tables were big enough so that it wasn't a problem. I love soup and no one makes soup like the various Asian cultures. The ramen was the best. I added a braised pork shoulder and an egg to mine but, even without it, it was full of roasted pork and other goodness. Everyone was friendly and there was lots of energy as people were greeted upon entering and thanked profusely in Japanese as they left. I am definitely going back next time I am in NYC.

Ippudo's classic broth is both thicker and porkier than the kind you'll find at Setagaya, while the noodles are thinner and more al dente. ÊNo doubt, there's a lot of stuff going on in each bowl and so appropriate on a cold winter's day. Ê P.S. ÊWhy is there a 30 minute wait when half the tables are in fact empty?

Such a long wait (an hour even in the late afternoon) but the ramen was well worth it. Perfectly cooked fresh noodles. Pork broth was everything it should be. Pork buns are comparable (maybe even better) than Momofuku's pork buns. I can't decide!

One thing I always look forward to when I go to NYC is to have some authentic/ creative ethnic food. I had been craving for a good bowl of ramen for a while, and my visit to Ippudo definitely satisfied me. After a almost 2 hrs wait, I was starving and couldn't wait to inhale a bowl of ramen. (I was glad of Ippudo's convenient location that allowed me to grab some snack at the bubble tea place 2-3 blocks away.) We were seated at the bar area in front of the open kitchen grill and everything, it got a bit warmer than I'd like, but it was super cool to watch the chefs prepare the orders. Both of my friends ordered Akamaru Modern ramen and I got Tori Ramen. The two soups were very different in tastes and I really liked both. The Akamaru had a thicker soup base with much heavier flavors, and tori had a lighter chicken base soup that's refreshing yet flavorful. I thought the noodle in the ramen was different from what I was used to, but I could tell that it was fresh noodle and I was happy with that. I took off one star for the disappointing specialty dish--Renkon Hasamiage, and the pretty bad green tea creme brulee dessert. And also I am not a fan of all the yelling. It was kinda fun at first, but a headache was starting to develop half way through the meal because the staff kept shouting next to my head...

We came here on a sunday night at 7:00PM and were lucky enough to only have to wait 20 minutes. (as opposed to 90? lucky us?) While we were waiting we tried the pork buns at the bar that everyone raves about. ÊI have to say that Momofuku wins the pork bun arms race, hands down. Onwards to the Ramen! I tried the Akamaru Modern. ÊIt was extremely tasty, but I think the best description I can give of it is that its a very "well-balanced" bowl of ramen. ÊNot too salty and not too rich with a balanced amount of ingredients inside. ÊI especially liked the pork and the egg in the ramen. The egg was almost like a soft-boiled egg. Ê I didn't notice anything off about the noodles, which means they were cooked just right. Remember, if you leave a lot of soup base in your bowl, you can order extra noodles and have a complete second bowl of ramen :9

i love ippudo! i can't add much to the previous reviews, but here is a tip: even though the atmosphere is trendy and fun, i do not recommend going to ippudo with a date you want to impress/like a lot because: a) it'll be difficult to enjoy eating ramen while worrying about looking silly doing so. & b) as a party of two, you may be seated at a communal table so you would not be looking at your date and would awkwardly have to turn. not conducive for intimate convos ;) warning: this place gets mad busy! it opens at five. my dining companion and i accordingly showed up at 5:08 and it was already swarming! eight minutes past opening and an hour wait ensues. le sigh. but we agreed it was worth it.

Ambiance: cool, hip-for-ramen, dark, many japanese greetings fill the air Price: fair Food: got the red ramen, and the roasted-miso ramen, both very tasty, slightly salty in my part. appetized with pork buns and cream croquets, buns were delicious, and croquets were good. the ramen noodles are thinner than the usual (commercial), which could go either good or bad depending on personal favor. portions are good, not too much, not too little. Service: Good, our waitress helped me out with giving my roommate a surprise bday dessert. everybody(waiters/tresses) sang, and the couple next to us/duo in front of us got very very excited (big thanks for the commotion). Will I come back: yes, once I crave for these noodles. Pointer: huge line, since it doesn't take reservations, but great bar to wait at. nice cocktail, and listen to your waitress' advice on plum wine, you will be satisfied. this place has definitely its own significant taste that only can be found here, if you're looking for a generic ramen, or one of a more traditional taste, go elsewhere.

GOOD LORD the noodles are freaking amazing. If you're ever in NYC and craving a bowl of damn good ramen, this is place to be. I think they get their noodles straight up from Japan bc I've never tasted such a thing in my life. Try ANY of their ramens, you'll be happy with any of them. Hopping even on a late Thursday night, don't be surprised if you're waiting to get seated at 10p. Seriously, though, $13 for a bowl of this? Don't think about sharing, trust me. You'll want to eat the whole damn thing, plus lick the bowl after gulping the soup. Minus one star because it's the most freakin expensive bowl of ramen I've had, and service is a little slow. Wahhh, I want to go back.

I went with my family to celebrate Êmy little sisters 21st birthday this past weekend. After hearing plenty of warnings about the wait time for a table (somewhere between 1-3 hours), I decided to make our dinner into a very early Sunday dinner... Hopefully missing the lunch rush and beating the dinner rush... And it worked out PERFECTLY! We got a great table, the servers were very attentive and friendly, and the food was 'mouth orgasm' good.... Im NOT exaggerating. We started with their pork buns (which you could order as chicken too... but I say go with the pork)... It was melt-in-your-mouth amazing... I used to be a true blue fan of Momofuku's pork buns... but I gotta say... these were better... better than better... just ridiculously good. Then we each ordered different ramen bowls from the menu and ordered one plate of the ribs to share. The ribs were delicious... falling off the bone, sweet, and tender. The ramen was fantastic! Fresh beyond belief... firm and not mushy at all... with a nice flavor that complimented the soup. And the soup was amazing... Each different ramen had its own soup to compliment, which came out in nice portions (so keep in mind... if you have broth left over and "would like some more please", there is the option of ordering another order of just noodles for $2!). Try out the Shoyu Ramen... One of my faves. And the wonderful meal all ended with a nice cup of tea to wash it all down. So all in all... fantastic noodle house... The decoration is very trendy and fun... the staff is very helpful and attentive... and we never felt rushed at all. Sitting around and sipping tea and talking was just fine by them. Even with people waiting outside. Just REMEMBER... No reservations what-so-ever! So COME EARLY (or late... however you look at it) and pick your days wisely... But honestly, its worth the wait! Also... if you are coming in a small group... (pretty much groups of 2's) and its crowded... keep in mind... this is a noodle BAR.... So there are huge tables that become 'community tables' where you could be rubbing elbows with another person. Honestly... really not THAT BIG of a deal... Some people dont like it... but hey, also gives you a chance to check out what they ordered and maybe make some 5 minute friends! Enjoy!

STFU!! its cute the first few times, but when you have to sit here for 1+hrs waiting for a table and then spend another hour eating, the yelling is non stop and totally annoying. Do you really have to greet every diner that way? indoor voices please! aside from all the shouting, the food here sooo good!!! get the pork buns!! the dough is so soft and light, the pork so savory and juicy and fucking delicious. i could sit here and eat nothing but the pork buns all day. However, you can't not have the ramen so I had the ramen. It was great. But its really the pork buns that you can't miss! The other downside is, for ramen and pork buns and 1 other dish I can't remember, it was $60 for 2people!!

Yummy! Every time I tried to eat here there's always been a ginormous line... and neither my friends nor I wanted to wait more than an hour to eat dinner. But hearing raving reviews about this place and still haven't tried it, my friends and I decided to wait for a table on a Saturday night. The wait was long it was almost 2 hours long and this was for a party of 3! So we walked around Astor place instead of waiting inside. Our waiter was really cool, cute and funny! I can't really remember which ramen bowl I ordered but it was delicious! I also ordered the calpico drink, being a lightweight, that one drink made me feel all warm and fuzzy. And if you finish all your ramen, you can always ask for another scoopful for around $3 I think.. I'll probably go back here but seriously the long wait sucks :(

i love ippudo! i would highly recommend ordering the hirata buns (pork buns) as an appetizer, and then getting the akamaru modern ramen for your meal. try to just go with one other person because the line is long (and kind of ridiculous). i waited around 40 minutes when i went, and i thought the food was well worth the wait. we got to sit at the serving bar and were able to see the chefs cooking/preparing everything, which was pretty cool. i would say their ramen sizes are pretty big and definitely filling. it's got a very trendy vibe to it, and the place has this great positive energy to it. try to get there a bit before 7 so you don't have to wait too long. a must-try in ny!

Ippudo does have the best ramen. I got the Shiromaru Hakata Classic. The noodles were perfect and it wasn't too oily. I also got the pork buns here and I have to say that I actually prefer Momofuku's pork buns over Ippudo's. Ippudo puts some kind of mayonnaise in their pork buns that I just didn't like. Who puts mayonnaise in pork buns? Seriously! They still get 5 stars for their ramen though. It is definitely tops.

This place is popular! I got there just before 2pm on a Sunday and the bar was full, and there was a 15 minute wait, so why not. The interior is gorgeous, with ramen bowls decorating the wall in the entry/bar area, and lovely high ceilings giving a nice open feel to the dining room, complete with open kitchen. I was dining alone, so I was seated at a big round table that seats 6 - 3 people were a group, and the other 2 were solo diners like myself. I was seated with my back to the kitchen, so I could turn around and watch one of the chefs measure out portions of freshly made ramen on the scale before dropping them in the hot water for a brief boil, then taking up each little basket of noodles and giving them a good hard shake to get out most of the water. After that, they are dumped in a bowl and dressed with the appropriate broth and toppings. I ordered the Akamaru Modern, which has Ippudo's special sauce in it. I also ordered the extra egg. It took a while for everyone's food to arrive, I noticed. When it was my turn, I was served a large red bowl full of steaming hot soup, ramen, a single piece of melt-in-your-mouth Berkshire pork, a few pieces of cabbage and a few slivers of wood ear mushrooms. Everything was topped with chopped scallions, and my floating egg. The special sauce is also on the top, so I mixed it all up and took a sip of the broth - yummy, porky goodness with a strong hit of garlic and salt. This is a very intense, rich broth, and not for anyone who is averse to pork for any reason! The ramen was very thin, cooked to perfection, chewy and springy. The egg was hard-boiled, then cooked in soy sauce, which gave a nice flavor to it. I really enjoyed my bowl of ramen, but I have to say, it took rather long for my order to arrive, and it's rather expensive (up there with Momofuku). And it's not like you get an abundance of food for your money (a single slice of pork?), not that I needed more, but it did seem a little out of proportion with the price. So I would go back with friends, but on my own, I'd probably satisfy a ramen craving elsewhere.

Came here with a couple of friends last night. You HAVE to get there early in order to get a table! We still had to wait about 45minutes even though we showed up at 6:30. The staff were, of course, extremely polite and friendly. The ramen was as good as expected, and much more filling. Also, Êthey had a noodle salad for my friend who is a vegetarian and couldn't enjoy the pork broth. She liked that.

In the years that I lived in Japan, I had a fair amount of ramen. ÊI wasn't a freak, but it just happens. ÊI did make it a point to try the regional styles of ramen whereever I traveled and I specifically recall Hakata Ramen from Fukuoka being the best. ÊI had it at Ippudo. ÊNot sure if it is the style or if Ippudo just makes the best ramen, but I have eaten at the NY one and cannot believe that they have brought that magic with them. Ê It is a few more dollars than I care to spend on ramen, but the place does have a decor and mood that is worth it. ÊThe staff wear neat patterned outfits too. Ê There is often a wait, but just wander around. Êit's worth it.

My first meal in NYC and I LOVED it. ÊI yearn for a ramen place like this here in Hawaii. ÊPerhaps one day, we will get it. ÊDuring my five day stay in NYC, I came to Ippudo twice. ÊBoth times, I had wonderful food. ÊThe pork buns are amazing along with the deep fried peppers. The noodles and broth were simple and delicious.

I love noodles! Freshly made noodles? Even better. I had the classic ramen and that was really yummy. My friend got the spicy tonkatsu and it was also really yummy. The only problem is that mine was really salty and I felt a little queasy afterward. Also, as a Chinese person, egg noodles remain my favorite kind of noodle. But anyway, I'll definitely be back for more ramen especially as the weather gets colder. My friend says the best part is to go to the bathroom and pass all the rooms of people making noodles. I will definitely do that next time!

Went here with some coworkers and we loved it. They have a small menu which is good so they can focus on the ramen. The bartender and wait staff were all very friendly. The decor is modern but comfortable. I tried the traditional ramen and I really enjoyed it! Some of the best I've had (okay - I haven't had that much and I'm more particular to soba). Prices are a little high for ramen but you don't have to order much more to be full. I would probably go back.

One of my goals for New York was to get a good bowl of ramen and Ippudo did it. But when I think of ramen I think of a hole in the wall place where a tiny old japanese lady brings me my bowl. Ippudo the exact opposite super trendy. I got the original and also got to try the one with the special sauce, both can be put on my list of outstanding bowls of ramen. Noodles are perfect, not to soft, but the broth can be ranked in my top 5. I would give this a 5 star rating but $13 for a bowl of ramen is ridiculous

3.5 stars overall experience! Though this place doesn't need another review, I thought i'd put my two cents out there. To break it down, the soup base is the star of ippudo. I love how flavored it is, and how thick it is, like ramen soup should be. 5 stars for the soup base. However, the noodles itself and the appetizers were Ok for me. Nothing outstanding- Personally, I like the pork buns at momofoku more... And the wait can be ridiculous. Not a great dining environment when people are shouting every time something is brought out from the kitchen, which really is every 2 seconds. But, the soup base is delicious!

Unimpressive. Ê That was the word that kept popping into my head while I was eating here (less than 30 minutes ago). ÊI was supremely unimpressed. Ê I came here around 4pm, walked inside, and while there were plenty of staffers hanging around, no one looked at me. ÊThere was a guy directly in front of me that eventually gave me a glance, but then kept going about doing his thing. ÊEventually someone came over to me and asked me what I wanted. Ê I go, "Umm...where...do I sit?" ÊThe girl looked puzzled as though I'd asked her what was the average annual rainfall in the Amazon Basin. Ê"I don't understand what you mean." ÊFinally I said, "Are you open?" ÊTo which she responded, "No, we open at 5." Ê Okay...so for all of the people that were standing there and ignoring my deer-in-the-headlights look, no one could have bothered to simply say "We're not open yet"? Ê Alright whatever. ÊI smurfed around for an hour and came back at 5 to already find a line of 30 people. ÊStood in line and was eventually in the door within 10 minutes. Ê A chorus of irasshaimase later, a waitress sat me at the bar. ÊThe chairs are high and she was awkwardly trying to push me in while I was still trying to hop on, thus just pushing me into the bar. ÊFinally I told her thanks and just did it myself, to which she seemed puzzled that I was capable of doing so. Ê I ordered the Shiromaru (pretty much your standard tonkotsu) and the Hirata pork buns. ÊPork buns came first, soft, not really warm, with a square of lettuce peeking out. ÊI took a bite and... Was unimpressed. ÊI mean yeah it was good and all, some tough spots here and there, but for 8 bucks it was not particularly worth the money. ÊI waited for about 15 minutes and then the ramen came. Ê What. ÊThe. ÊFurikake. Ê The first thing I look at is the portion of the cha-shu- I'm given. ÊThis had to be the skimpiest offering I'd ever had. ÊTwo paper-thin slices that were each the size of a silver dollar. ÊI'm not exaggerating. ÊI was tempted to ask them what the hell, but I decided against it since they were getting busy and I was already annoyed beyond caring. Ê The broth was a little bland to me, porky but not as porky as I'm used to. ÊMeager offerings of toppings. ÊSoup to noodle ratio was heavier on the noodle side. ÊI wouldn't think kaedama would be necessary. ÊThe noodles themselves were soft, and made me wonder if the ramen had been hanging out for a bit before I got it. Ê Again, I was unimpressed. ÊNot worth 13 bucks for sure. Ê The place is swanky. ÊThumping music, lots of noise, long lines. ÊBut the food is....supremely meh. ÊI really wanted to like this place since I'd heard it was the best 'men in the city, but I really don't think I'm going to be coming back. Ê26 bucks (tax and tip) later, I'm full yet unsatisfied. Ê Sorry Ippudo, I'm not feeling it.

Ippudo is amazing. My friends and I went here for dinner because one of my friends just bacame a ramen chef here. It was delicious. We had some chicken wings for an appetizer. Then one of the waiters brought out the cucumber appetizers that was probably one of the most delicious recipes that I have had that consisted of cucumbers. For the entree, my friends and I all got different types of ramen. The special wasabi ramen was probably one of the best. It wasn't too spicy, but it was just plain good. You can tell that their noodles are fresh and the broth that they use is just so incredible. My friend that works there said that all of their broths are cooked over 24 hour periods and that the recipes for the broth and the noodles are both closely guarded secrets that only two people know. Anytime there is a secret recipe, it is reason enough to go. This time it just happened to be tasty and delicious!

1 hour wait maybe 2, what's the big deal not like I have anything better to do. (There's some sarcasm there :P ) Was it worth the wait to have ramen? It was well worth it. Let me explain I had the best pork bun even in my life. Bar/waiting area is absolutely small. If you can squeeze yourself in, treat yourself to a couple of drinks and a pork bun. It will wet your taste buds and make you crave for more. Cucumber appetizer sooooo yummy and refreshing. If your lucky you get to sit at the prep bar and watch them make the food. Eat a bowl a ramen, you would have a taste of what heaven is like.

Hands down the best ramen I have ever had. I've always thought, "Why would I pay $15 for a bowl of fancy ramen when I can eat a pack of ramen for $0.10. ÊThe taste difference is not worth $14.90." ÊWell, that was before I had Ippudo! Their dark soy sauce based broth was awesome! ÊTheir pork belly was awesome! ÊThe bbq pork was awesome! ÊI actually had to order more pork belly because it was that delicious! Ê:D The only downside is the wait! ÊIt's crazy how busy this place is! We also got the pork bun appetizers that my friends were telling me about, but I was so disappointed! ÊThey were good... but not fantastic. ÊI would probably never order them again.

I love ramen. It's great at home cheap, and when it's well done in a classy restaurant such as this, it's both filling and delicious (a comfort food combination). I suspect everything on the menu is stellar, however, I was a bit put off by the price. Sure it's gourmet, but $18 for a bowl of ramen with egg is a little too much. I suppose we might be paying for the classiness, which I acknowledge as being great, but I'll let it pass... it is Manhattan, after all...

Finally got to eat here after multiple previous attempts (where there was a 2-3+ hr wait). Overall decor is nice, and service was pretty good. We got some pork buns to share, and I got their special ramen, which was similar to the Akamaru except with a spicy broth. Bottom line: it's good. the broth is a lot thicker (read: fattier) than typical ramen, so it's very flavorful. If you're more into a "light" tasting broth, then you won't like it. I wish they allowed you to choose how the noodles were cooked. Cons: for the price, they don't give you a lot of meat/noodles. And, yes it's good but it's not 3-hr-wait good. So, I wouldn't mind coming back if there wasn't a ridiculous wait.. but otherwise, there are much more reliable places to go for ramen.

Maybe I went on an off day, but I really felt cheated for what I got. I went alone and really just went there for the food. I ordered a ramen soup that had pork and egg in it, I got a small slice of pork, it was full fat and the size of my pinky and 1/4 of a boiled egg..... wtf..... for $18.... wtf?! When I asked about it, I was stopped mid sentence and told "thats what it comes with, there would be an extra charge". I am giving this place a 2, only because I really thought the broth tasted amazing. Other than that.... it is totally not worth it and I do not understand the hype. I would like to try it again because maybe I went on an off day... but I am not sure if I would be throwing out another $18.

with my favorite cousin and 2 amazing friends to spend a weekend in NYC, what were we going to do? Ippudo was on all of our list of "things to do". The wait was a bit long, and I was starting to get hungry while waiting outside. We somehow managed to squeeze ourselves near the bar. I ordered their lychee martini. suffice to say, I was little tipsy by the time we got our table. Oh their restroom is downstairs btw. It's supppper loud. Felt like a high school cafeteria loud. Our server was wickedly cool. She knew every single ramen and the specialty. I didn't think it was all that at first. I thought it was little too salty, little too greasy. But few months later, revisiting my bookmarks, I realize I am craving ippudo's ramen!

Like so many others, I agree that this is the best ramen that I've eaten. ÊThe first time I visited Ippudo last year, I thought it was pretty good but I didn't quite understand the hype, nor the 1 hour wait (consistently a wait, though not always a whole hour). ÊThen, we ordered so many appetizers (pork buns, yamitsuri goma kuri -- cucumbers with red pepper flakes and sesame seeds, hirata fried chicken wings) that I was stuffed by the time my actual ramen arrived. ÊAt that time, I tried the Shiromaru Hakata Classic, which was the 'the original tonkotsu' soup noodles with slices of simmered berkshire pork, kikurage, red pickled ginger, menma, 1/2 hard boiled egg, sesame & scallions. ÊI thought it was very good, but the flavors weren't as amazing as I expected. ÊSo, I rated that as a 4-star in my mind. Then, fast forward to yesterday, and I went to Ippudo again because a friend staying with me from San Francisco was dying to try ramen. ÊWe skipped ordering any filler appetizers and instead went straight to the ramen. ÊThis time, I ordered the special of the day, which was the original tonkotsu soup noodles with slices of simmered berkshire pork, kikurage (mushrooms), little morsels of sauteed ground pork, scallions and cabbage in a spicy peanut and sesame sauce. ÊOMG the flavors were unbelievable! The broth had a little kick to it with the spices and flavored the nice, slightly firm noodles so well. I was completely blown away and could have easily ordered more noodles to finish off that delicious broth, had it not been for the fact that we had an event we had to head off to. ÊThough, I certainly drank as much of that savory goodness as I could before our check came. Now, I can finally truly rave about Ippudo. ÊI hope they put that "special" ramen on the menu for good, because it was fantastic!

My friends and I had some of the pork buns, and I have to say that I prefer Momofuku's -- Ippudo's has a piece of iceberg lettuce and mayo, and while I love mayo, I do not need it on a piece of pork that is that tender and flavorful. I forgot what noodles I had but I'm pretty sure you can't go wrong with any! Yum.

I can't believe I said I wouldn't be coming back soon, I've been coming back plenty of times. Do yourself a favor and get extra pork brisket in your ramen, in your drink, in your dessert and everything else. P.S. They don't take reservations by phone, just in person. And because it is a long wait I did come by in the morning to make the reservation for the night. Even though I live in the UES! yes, it's worth it!

i love this place i know what the all hype is all about this place. I do admit that the atmosphere and the miso broth is fantastic but the value is not. I paid for extra toppings on my ramen and the amount they gave me was not worth it. $15+ for a bowl of ramen in a trendy place doesnt cut if for me. I would say go down to Kambi/Minca down the street which is at least as good and you dont need to wait an hour or so for your table.

For a place that I fairly like, I can't believe I'm giving Ippudo 3 stars. But before any one calls out the hit squad on me, let me explain. Yes, it's good. Yes, it's world renown. Yes, it's hip. And, as evidenced by the hour (or more) long queues it's popular and trendy. But is it worth it? Evidently my 3 star rating does not give much consideration to popular sentiment. First off, if taste and ramen quality was the only concern, I'd probably give Ippudo a 4. Apart from the ramen, the menu at Ippudo does contain many tasty side-treats. Though it resides in an uneasy space between traditional and nouveau, the flavor combinations do make sense. There isn't anything wildly out of touch with my palette or necessarily too familiar. The pork buns are excellent. Wrapped in a steamed rice bun, the pork is tender and is glazed with what would seem to be a soy and honey/sugar concoction. It's a winner. Apart from that and a few other standouts, the menu seems to carry a lot of filler. Ê The ramen itself is solid. Amongst the variations that I've tried, none have ever disappointed. The broth is rich and filling. As I've said previously, if ramen were the only consideration, 4 stars. However, what's abundantly clear is that you are paying for the design and atmosphere of the space. This isn't wrong in itself and the owners of the establishment have really put a lot of thought into how this place looks. Nonetheless, in my mind, design alone can not speak for a place where people come primarily to eat. And, with the multitude of places were a person can get a solid bowl for a much more competitive price, it's clear that your incremental dollar goes towards what you are looking at versus what is going into your belly. As I've noted, this isn't wrong but it all wends its way into the heart of things --the overall ratings score which I've given --3 stars. Ramen In Asia, its spiritual home, is generally a much more casual affair. This isn't to say that there too, it hasn't been dressed up. And for me, no matter how much you dress it up, it can never stray too far off that mark without becoming something wholly different. Ippudo ramen is a good meal but it is pricey and the wait is annoying. All for something which doesn't really transcend my concept of what Ramen should taste like. I guess ultimately that is the failing of Ippudo (and maybe more broadly, the genre) is that almost impossible to elevate Ramen without altering the spirit of the dish. If you are curious about this place, by all means, go. It is a well designed space and the food is good. It's a great no-fuss palce for a date (just pray that the wait is reasonable). However, for old Ramen veterans like myself I find that there are better overall options to be had.

It's good? Yes. Over the top? Not much. Food is kind of expensive, but I guess the decor, service and location makes up for it. When my boyfriend and I first came here 2-3days ago, we didnt have t o wait because we got there early (around 530PM)! Thank goodness! [because as we were leaving, there was a huge crowd waiting for seats.] We were also greeted by almost every worker in the restaurant -- it was nice but also frightening at the same time because we really didnt expect the loud greetings. We ordered the squid appetizer, it was a little pricy considering how much we received, but it was very good nonetheless. The ramen was delicioussss, and I like the big old spoon that we were given to eat with! Place is dark, romantic (I guess?), loud, nice music, most of all, great staff. And I emphasize on the great staff because they dont make you feel like youre invisible. You are assisted when needed without needing to wait too long. I say this because I know of many places where you have to wave down the waitstaff or try to get their attention, yet they're so rude. Well what i'm trying to say is, def give this place a try --- you wont regret it!!

Seeing as how it's "Hot On Yelp" I figured I must give Ippudo a try. ÊThis was my first ever ramen experience, at least outside of the 49 cent "ramens" you get at the bodega. ÊAnd now my ramen adventures will begin, this is such an intriguing bowl of deliciousness I want to know more about. I figured since it just opened and all I would get there really early, and that I did. I arrived at about 5:30 and didn't have to wait although it was pretty crowded and by the time I left 45 minutes later the place was packed. ÊI loved the atmosphere, seemed like it was a sort of an upscale ramen joint after reading reviews of a bunch of other places in the city. It was really clean and I felt pretty comfortable. The waitstaff was incredibly nice, everyone smiled which is a big thing for me! The ramen was delicious. ÊI had the one with the dollop of "special sauce" which I was thinking might be spicy, however it wasn't really. That was my only gripe, so I asked for some spicy sauce and was quickly delivered a small dish of flaming red sauce. I felt it was just what my ramen needed, I like things spicy. So thanks to a great first ramen experience at Ippudo I now can't stop thinking about where I'll try next!

I'm not a huge fan of ramen but, this place Rocks. I went there for dinner at 7 on a Friday night and had to wait about 45 mins but, definitely worth the wait. The Shiomaru Moto Sji is simply the best bowl of ramen I have ever had. If you're still starving after one bowl, which most are, you can add a kae-dama (another ball of noodles). Now if you are longing for more after a second round, they also allow you to add a third ball of noddles, in which case they will also provide you with extra soup for free (but I would't do this too often). The Matcha Brulee (green tea pudding) is a good ending to your meal. Stay away from the fruit in champagne.

In terms of atmosphere, Ippudo is to Ramen what Little Star is to Pizza. ÊAn upscale Ramen house decisively decorated to appeal to a younger, hipper, generation with its dark tones, dim lighting and Japanese pop music playing in the background. ÊThe staff consisted of 20-somethings and they appeared to truly enjoy their jobs and shouting out cheers in unison in their native tongues. ÊThey completely treated the line outside the door much like a dance club in that they kept people waiting while there were vacancies inside. I was impressed at the cleanliness of the entire restaurant as well as the display of the noodle making process downstairs in the basement. ÊVery cool. Oh yeah, the FOOD. ÊI ordered the Akamaru Shin-Aji and found it to be very pleasant overall. ÊTo me, Ramen is all about the broth. ÊOnly once I got through the spicy flavoring, could I evaluate the broth. ÊI found it to be clean and refreshing, but lacking in fat or "earthiness". ÊThe pork in the broth was unmemorable. ÊHowever, I really got a kick out of the thin noodles. ÊChewy with just the right amount of "snap", I hadn't ever experienced noodles of this consistency or texture. ÊI would go back just for the noodles. ÊThey're really THAT good. ÊWho woulda thought that Ippudo could give me a new appreciation for Ramen? If Ippudo opened up a chain in SF, they would do extremely well for a couple of years and then taper off. ÊIf their broth and meat in the Ramen dish followed the quality of the noodles, they would really have something here. ÊOtherwise, it was enjoyable and delectable in its differences from other Ramen houses I've tried.

OVERRATED. Trendy, noisy, and really dark. Basically, just an awkward place to be eating ramen! Very salty broth, and the fact that you have to pay extra for meat or eggs is really upsetting, considering that it's already an abnormally expensive bowl of noodles. I mean, it's not BAD ramen; it's just not good enough to justify $16 (13 + 3 extra for the braised pork belly, which is actually really good/necessary and I wish they would give you more than 2 slices). It's not even that expensive in TOKYO. After 5:30, the wait can range from 30 minutes to almost 2 hours!!! So if you must go, go at an off-peak hour.

Oh Ippudo, I hate the wait (average 45 min) but definitely think the wait is worth your $13 miso ramen (egg +$2). Had the omakase appetizer-- but thought the chicken wings with spicy sauce was 10xs better (3 other tables ordered it too). Go with no appetite, bc the wait will surely build it!

If stuck, the bar selection of Sake and Shochu is good .. too good ... and I sampled a good deal of them. So much so, I didn't hear the waitress call my name for our table... repeatedly. Hey, I finally had a spot at the bar and, anyway, I wasn't going anywhere ... too cold outside. OK... on to business ... so this was like my 10th visit to Ippudo, but only the 3rd time that I actually ate a meal as the wait can be too daunting. ÊBut I did say that the wait was worth it and it is. The ramen are truly great and it is entirely because of the wonderful broths that are prepared here by the wizards in the kitchen. ÊThese are not heavily prepared with thick seasoning. ÊThese both have a nice complexity and refinement to them that I have not experienced at other noodle establishments. Ê Their appetizers and main dishes are also of a high caliber (flavorful pork buns, salmon carpaccio sprinkled with Parmesan). I do like the layout of the restaurant, but I wish that they found a few ways to squeeze in a few more tables so that I might have more of a chance to come back. Well, there is always the bar.

This is certainly an experience and I recommend that anyone who likes Ramen should try it. You just don't get the same taste (or noodles, as far as I've seen) anywhere else in the city. The appetizers are excellent and desserts are yummy as well. I ordered the braised pork belly and the meat was insanely tender and the sauce very light and tasty. Akamaru and Shiromaru are both very tasty (the special was wide noodles, maybe next time). The matcha brulee was excellent, especially if you love green tea. So for a generally good tasting experience definitely come here. Problem is that you'll need a *lot* of water after downing all that broth... I do have a few reservations. 1) The wait was pretty bad. We were there around 6:15 still had to wait about 45 minutes, but once we sat down we noticed that they don't seat people as quickly as they could (i.e. there were seats/tables empty Êaround us for quite a while). I think waiting once or twice is good, but this may deter me from going back for a regular ramen fix. Maybe if you go alone you'd have better luck. 2) It was quite loud and crowded so unless you like eating in close quarters with people you don't really know... also, since there are so many people waiting in line, you feel somewhat rushed and unable to enjoy your food as leisurely as you'd like. All in all, I really liked this place but will continue to my search for my regular ramen joint...

Tried Ippudo for the 2nd time today and brought several New Yorkers (yes, a Californian bringing New Yorkers) including several Japanese for their 1st times. Stuck with the Kakuni of course, but decided to switch it up a bit and order Shiromaru (which I don't think is as flavorful as the Akamaru) and the pork buns (which were delicious, and surprisingly had a kick which I love). Have to bump this one up to 5 stars after being very satisfying twice in a row.

The food at Ippudo is 5-star fantastic but the wait made me deduct one star. I've been to Ippudo 4 times and I'm questioning not going back just because of the wait. I disagree that the wait is shorter on Mondays/Tuesdays- when I arrived at 8pm this past Monday the wait was an hour and a half for 2 people. Once, I arrived at 6:10pm and there was a 10 minute wait- that's the only way to go. They do have a 2-for-1 drink special at the bar, but there's barely enough room to have a drink without getting knocked into a million times. I'd recommend starting with the hinata pork buns - the pork is so crispy and perfect, they come with a spicy mayo-like sauce. Even more than the ramen, I crave the pork buns!! The fried chicken wing appetizer is also awesome, they are slightly spicy and really crispy, very similar to Korean fried chicken places. The tofu hot pot is very flavorful, and has similar noodles to the ramen inside... It's a hard dish to describe, I've never seen anything like it elsewhere. As far as the ramen goes, if you're going today, they have a special ramen for the month of January that's amazing... It has a thick awesome pork broth and all the trimmings. The regular akamaru is also awesome, I like it with an egg. If you haven't been here, definitely check it out (at a weird time of the day)... you might get addicted.

This one gets a 5 for being the best ramen in the city. ÊI've been here a number of times. ÊThe best one they have is the Akamaru Shin. ÊA friend of mine that grew up in Japan asked them where on earth they got their noodles for this dish, as they are a rare specific style of noodle that she's only been able to find in Japan. ÊTheir response: "Thank you for noticing. ÊThere's no where in America that you can buy them, so we make them here". This is the real deal ramen with no sacrafice in quality...even if that means that they have to take drastic measures to live up. Water Refill Meter: 4/5 Generally I didn't have to ask for a refill but there were a few times that I had to.

So good I went twice in a week! ÊThis place is always poppin when I go. ÊI Êhad to wait an hour on a Tuesday night, crazy! Ê This place is famous for their ramen so of course I ordered the ramen. ÊI have to say that the price of a bowl of ramen is a little steep but when you start eating it, you forget how expensive it is. ÊThe broth is unbeatable. ÊThey make their noodles a little al dente, which I dont like as much but its ok.. the broth makes up for it. ÊI think during the weekdays, they have beers on tap for $4. ÊI tried the pork appetizer. ÊNicely flavored, soft but kinda pricey for the small portion. Ê If you go downstairs to the bathroom, there's a window to their noodle making station. ÊI didn't snoop around too much but there was someone in the room preparing the chewy noodles.

I was only in NY for 7 days and got introduced to Ippudo half way through my trip there. ÊDespite the variety of great restaurants in the city we Êwent back a second time. The ramen is, as everyone points out, really really good. ÊOne of the best stocks I have had for a long time. However, it is also worth pointing out that the other dishes are great. The pork buns were actually fresher and better than the David Chang versions and the cabbage salad was simple and perfectly dressed. The food is also very very cheap and the only way to really build up a proper bill is to enjoy their japanese beers on tap. Go.

Young asian crowd, great Ramen. Seriously, mostly asian. If you go to an asian place with mostly asian then u're prob at the right place for decent food. I would say great for lunch/brunch. I like this place better than Setagaya only because the broth isn't as oily and salty. Noodle is good too. If u don't know what to order, just ask the staff. Order some appetizers too. It won't break ur bank. I promise :) And did I mention they have pretty cute jap waitors? haha, but some with very poor english.. lol

The wait was RIDICULOUS. ÊWe came here on a Tuesday night at 9:45PM, and didn't get seated until 11PM!!! ÊCraziness. ÊWe had a few drinks at the very crowed bar while we waited, and the sake cocktails were very good. ÊWhen we finally got seated, we were starving and ordered pretty much everything the waitress/hostess recommended, since we probably won't come back anytime soon due to the wait. Ê Anyway, the appetizers were delicious--we got the pork buns, this tofu hot pot thing (forgot the name but you could ask), and deep fried Japanese peppers (AMAZING but very spicy!); we then order our own ramen bowls, which were great, but really really heavy (so make sure you're hungry enough before you eat here, or you'll feel nauseous after that quantity of soup and noodles). ÊThe noodles were thin and cooked to perfection though, so no complaints there. ÊHowever, I feel like our experience with the ramen could've been better if we hadn't ordered all those appetizers. Ê:) ÊWe couldn't even finish our ramens, which was a bummer. ÊOne thing to note is that they don't allow doggie bagging, so there's no way to bring your leftovers home even though you paid for them. Ê(Apparently it is to preserve the perfection and taste from fresh out of the kitchen...something like that.) The service was GREAT, and everyone was so polite and nice--I felt like I was in Tokyo. ÊAlso, when we walked into the seating area, all of their staff members (including the chefs in the kitchen) greeted us in Japanese. ÊHow nice! ÊOh, and the atmosphere was great; very trendy and New York-ish. ÊI almost felt like people who were eating there were there to be seen...kind of like at a club, hah. So I'd definitely recommend Ippudo NY. ÊTry it at least once, you won't regret it. ÊJust know that the wait is crazy long, even if you go on a weeknight at 11PM.

Yummm! ÊThis is by far the best bowl of ramen I've ever had. ÊOn my last trip to NYC, I had to be very thoughtful of where I ate since time only allowed me 4 lunches and 3 dinners. ÊI ended up eating here twice on that trip. ÊBoth times I ordered the Akamaru Modern Ramen. ÊIt was just THAT good! ÊMake sure to ask for some chopped raw garlic. Also, the service there was amazing. ÊI feel like good service is so hard to come by these days and I honestly felt like they went above and beyond. I also noticed that lots of reviewers complained about the wait. ÊBoth times I went during lunch and didn't have to wait at all. ÊSigh.... ÊI miss that place.

Last day of New York trip, got lost in subway systems and walked blocks and blocks to find this restaurant and ended on the wrong 4th Ave and missing a meeting time with my friend. ÊSo after getting my belongings and tried to make back to Ippudo before my flight. My first time to Ippudo was a quick but enjoyable. ÊI loved the fried chicken wings, remind me of Fu Rai Bo taste but even more flavorful and tasty. My great friend and chef at Per Se told me to try. ÊNext I ordered Akamaru Modern Ramen i believe it was this one. ÊThe best part about this bowl was the broth, not the noodles and not the two slices of pork they gave. ÊThe broth was rich and tasty. Ê But overall I am a fan but for the price it is not worth it. ÊThe 2 things I ordered were about $30 lunch price. ÊThat's Êtoo expensive to eat for lunch. ÊIf i ever go there again I want to try the Pork Buns and Pork Belly.

I really really want to give this place 3 stars. Maybe even 2. ÊMy fiance and I get there around 8p.m. on a Wednesday nite, and we're told it'll take an hour to get seated. ÊAnd as she had been there before and told me it's the BEST ramen she's ever had, and we're both leaving for LA this Saturday, I said we'd wait. No biggie. ÊFirst things first, we both get beers at the bar and my Yebisu was lukewarm. Ê$8 for a bottle of beer and you can't serve it cold? Really? Then, as we're waiting for our table, people coming in off the street, other couples no less, spend two seconds talking to the hostess and are suddenly seated ahead of us. ÊNow I get that this place is ridiculously popular, but are they really taking payoffs or hooking up their "friends" with seats before everyone else? Ê Anyways, 1.25 hours later, we finally get seated. ÊStill peeved a bit at how things transpired up to that point, I took a deep breath, had a draught sapporo (no more warm bottles) and ordered my ramen. ÊI get my ramen... remember how angry I sounded? Yea. that disappeared after my first sip of that broth, and my first chew of those noodles... hands down. ÊBEST ramen I've ever had, and there is certainly no shortage of ramen in LA. Ê$13 pricetag? Ridiculous. ÊWould I have it again? Yes.

The positives: ÊAmazing ramen with some very tasty appetizers, all served in a fun and lively environment where the Japanese kitchen staff contantly shout out orders to go as customers sit and enjoy their homemade ramen. Ê ÊI enjoy the spicier ramen dishes, as I like a bit more kick to my food. Ê ÊAll of the appetizers I have tried have been very good. Ê Negatives: Ê long wait. Ê they don't take reservations ahead of time so youur best bet is to go for lunch or go early and have a few glasses of Sapporo while you wait for your table. Ê ÊSome fairly good drink specials on their draft beer before 9 pm (around $5-6 a beer I believe).

Any restaurant that has a note next to their Hours of Service that state, "May need to close early if we run out of Ramen Soup" is a good place. This place is beautiful, but still somehow low key. ÊTheir are a lot of helpful servers to make sure you are taken care of. I am not big on the heavy pork soup base, but had to try it here since that's what they are famous for. ÊI did the combo meal deal where you can add a rice dish and salad with your ramen. ÊI got the Mentaiko rice dish- was beautifully done. Ê The noodles were perfectly made and cooked. ÊJust thin and "raw" enough to make it a perfect bowl of ramen. You see them making the noodles and when you go downstairs to the bathroom you can see all the noodle making paraphernalia (not sure if that was on purpose, or I was being nosey). I would try to go there outside of their rush hour, because the restaurant quickly got crowded.

Yum! ÊI am a big time noodle fan and this place is good. I think its even better than the ramen noodles at Mitsuwa in NJ. It's a bit on the pricy side for ramen but its worth it. The broth! ÊIt's all in the broth...that's key. ÊThat's what make it taste so good-good. ÊAnd you can order second helpings of ramen (w/o broth) for like $2 extra...just save the broth! The pork bun appetitzer! ÊDouble yum! ÊSteam buns with nicely cooked, fall off the bone, fatty pork meat and they slather it with some mayo too! Normally, I am not a mayo fan but this works well together :0) Get there early b/c it gets packed and this place does not take reservations. ÊSo, first come first serve and they'll only seat you if your entire party is there...which is fair. They also have happy hour. ÊTwo for one beers most nites (2fers for Asahi beer on tap) and special cocktail drinks of the day. Ê Try to lychee martini...yum! Overall....would go back again when i'm craving ramen Price: A bit pricy for noodles Decor: Asian influence (of course) modern but not obnoxious trendy Vibe: Low key

OK...so it's a bit overpriced. ÊMaybe if I lived in NY I wouldn't want to dish out the money for a $15 bowl of ramen (including tax).

Delicious and pleasure-full ramen experience! I truly love ramen and Ippudo does not dissapoint. The New York outpost of a Japanese chain, Ippudo's ramen span a variety of flavor levels and complexities. The Shoyu Ramen may be simple, but it is robust with flavor. I'm a sucker for the egg and I was slurping up every last drop of this ramen. The Akamaru Modern is a special Ippudo ramen, with their sauce added. While also pleasant, the flavor is more subtle. Still delicious to the last drop. Please get the pork buns. The bun is so soft and puffy, I actually pictured laying my head down on it while I was eating. The pork has a nice tasty crust to it, which you don't always get in a pork bun. The service is stellar and the place is stimulating as well. A definite recommendation for any noodle-head!

Ramen in Japan is like barbecue here in the US: different regions in Japan have very different styles of ramen, all native to that area. The style of ramen served here is called "Hakata Ramen", found natively in Fukuoka, Japan. Its roots, however, trace to nearby Kurume (50 km to the south), where my father was born. Growing up, this is the type of ramen I ate most frequently, especially when visiting my grandparents (who had moved to Fukuoka by this point), two or three times a year, until I was about 7, and every chance I got thereafter. Ippudo is a chain that started in Daimyo region of Fukuoka. They have stores all over, and there was one about 10 minutes from where I lived in Tokyo. In the three years I spent there as an adult, I went there often. There are key differences between Ippudo and Ippudo NY. They made the store furnishings a bit more sophisticated. They also don't use the throwaway chopsticks like most ramen places will provide in Japan. The menu in Japan is pretty sparse, because people going to these stores go for ramen -- we know what we're getting into. To get the proper Ippudo experience, Ignore all but the Shiromaru and Akamaru, the extras for the ramen, kaedama, the rice dishes, and gyoza. That's pretty much what you'll find in a Japanese ramen place. As for alcohol, beer is pretty much what you'll find. Try the Orion beer -- it's a very clean pilsner beer, and should go very well with the rich texture of the dishes. The execution of Hakata Ramen, as Shiromaru, is pretty good but not completely perfect. A true Hakata Ramen aficionado will order the noodles "hard". The "extra hard" wasn't executed as well as they were in the Tokyo stores -- it needed about ten more seconds in the hot water. It also took a touch too long for our orders to arrive, perhaps by about 2 minutes. Neither of these, even combined, merit the loss of a star, however, especially considering the rest of the service was quite excellent. It is a touch more expensive than what one would find in Japan, but then again, the ingredients were top notch, and even the pork was likely imported from Japan, judging by the taste and texture. Unless I want to have my health insurance buy Pfizer yet another corporate jet, I won't go here every week, but it is tempting.

Man they thought of everything here. Such attention to detail. From the decor, to the chorus of "welcome!", to the different bowls for different ramen dishes, unique serving plates for each appetizer, to the attentive service. Really Great ambiance! Really loved everything we tried here. The pork buns give Momofuku's buns a run for their money. There, I said it. And I mean it too. So good. They add a piece of cabbage to their buns which gives it a crunchy texture to play with the fluffy consistency of the pork. Worth trying. We also loved the Samurai Ribs [berkshire pork spare ribs, seasoned with soy based 'tare' sauce, served with kyoto seven-spice chili pepper]. It comes with a little mound of what is apparently really rare chili pepper you're supposed to sprinkle on your ribs. Meat literally falls of the bone. AH-MAZING. Then we had Renkon Hasamiage [deep fried lotus root with minced shrimp, served with tempura dipping sauce]. Was definitely very interesting. Crunchy, slightly spicy with a little mound of green tea powder. Loved the fried minced shrimp. So good. The ramen? Oh the ramen. I want to move to Japan and spend the rest of my life eating ramen if this is what it's like. The noodles are just perfect. I ordered: Tori Ramen [salt flavored ramen noodles, a combo of 'chintan clear chicken/tonkotsu soup, w/ slices of berkshire pork, hard boiled egg, onion, menma, naruto, shiso & scallions] First of all the bowl was super cute, was extra high and had a little dent for what I think was to rest your chopsticks (or sip the broth?). You also get a jumbo Asian-broth-spoon that comes in a super cute resting dish. It was flavored perfectly, the broth itself was rich and delicious. No wonder they give you such a big broth spoon! The flavors just went together perfectly, all the textures as well. AND for $2 extra if you have broth left, you can ask for MORE NOODLES! Awesome idea! You can also pick additional toppings which are listed, for a fee. Love a place that does all the thinking for you! They did forget to bring out my drink but it was probably better that way since my table split a bottle of sake anyway (LOVE sake!). The cocktail list is not super extensive, but they have a good selection of sake and Japanese beer. Love Ippudo! And get there around 6 if you don't want to wait a long time in line! SO even though they screwed up the drinks I still can't bring myself to give them less than 5 stars!

Heard great recommendations about this place as well as all of the positive reviews on yelp, so I had to come here for the ramen while I was in NY! Be prepared to wait or have a snack before hand, because this place seems to be super packed at night and for a large group of 6 or more, it was about an hour and 15 minutes. Once you enter the restaurant, they have a cute little bar in the front where you can hang out, grab a drink and wait for your table. I like the bar because it's nicely decorated with this huge ball hanging from the ceiling as well as a bunch of bowls attached to the wall. When you are being seated, the servers and cooks greet you with an authentic welcome in Japanese. As for my meal, since I wasn't too hungry, I ordered the pork buns and split the spicy ramen with a friend. We thought that we would still be hungry, so halfway through our meal, we also ordered an extra bowl of noodles. Once I took a sip of the delicious soup base, I knew I came to the right place! The noodles were a little bit harder than I prefer, but they were still good. The egg was really yummy as well. Overall, we were both pretty stuffed! Overall, I thought the ramen had a lot of flavor and pretty good but just a little bit pricey for noodles. I think I'd still come again because I enjoyed the ambiance, the service and the food!

Amazing! Probably the best noodle soup I've ever had. I ordered the house special Ramen and it was incredible. The texture of the noodle and the flavor of the broth was ridiculous good. My bowl was $14 but I would have paid $20. The pork belly bun was equally as mouth watering. If you are ever in NYC you must try this spot. Come early as the wait can exceed an hour and the bar is puny.

I normally HATE ramen - reminds me of college. However, this place is a MUST! You will definitely have to wait, although I haven't waited more than 45 minutes on a busy night. At the bar, squeeze your way to the actual bar (which is cutely decorated with raw ramen noodle squares underneath the glass countertop) and order some sake, the adorable man at the bar will even teach you how to drink it like a true Japanese person. If you go here - which you should - order any of the ramen with the tonkatsu (pork) in the soup. Absolutely amazing and so tender - although not many pieces :( If you're a health addict, I didn't feel fat after finishing a bowl (with the extra noodles you can request after you finish the ones originally served - extra $2). I was surprised. The philly cheese eggrolls are a random item on the menu. They are good but taste like Taco Bell should serve them. However, the seared tuna appetizer is AMAZING! crunchy on the outside, raw on the inside. PS the waiter with the rat-tail is adorable to look at, but also very helpful and nice.

I don't even like ramen. I mean, it's okay. I've done the whole Momofuku thing, but was much more into the pork buns than the noodles. Ippudo = game-changer. I had the modern. A delectable, perfectly-apportioned red bowl of amazingness. The pork was succulent. The egg, the noddles, the garlicky sauce... all magic. I'd go again in a heartbeat if it weren't for the hour-long wait. Also, the pork buns were excellent. I think I favor the Momofuku ones, but this had a tangy aioli that was really different.

I didn't review this place yet? ÊWhat is wrong with me? ÊI must be too busy dreaming about it to write. I'll start by saying that I never really knew the truth of ramen before coming here. ÊTo me, ramen was that cheap food that college students pay twenty cents a packet for. ÊWow, wasn't I just the epitome of wrong? ÊA friend went here and promptly became obsessed with it. ÊOne day we ventured into the city and she brought me here. ÊSometimes I wish she hadn't! For real, what hasn't already been said in over a thousand reviews? ÊI get the Akamaru Modern. ÊThe broth is delectably rich, I love the garlicky sauce, the pork is succulent and, of course, the noodles have great bite. ÊI also learned the wonders of kakuni, so now into the bowl it goes for me. ÊLast time we finally ordered kae-dama. ÊAt first you are sad because your noodles are gone but then oh magic! ÊThey have returned for a blessed encore! Yes, the wait is long. ÊYes, you can pay less elsewhere. ÊBut there is a reason the wait is long and you pay more. ÊI just wish they did take out.

It's pricey. ÊThere is guaranteed to be a wait (if you don't get there just after opening.) ÊBut it's worth it. The broth is consistently flavorful, noodles are fresh and cooked just right, and the pork is delicious and not overly fatty (although the portion of pork is not generous). Service was very good. I recommend that you sit away from a service station (lest you enjoy hearing the staff shouting greetings and salutations in your ear). And yes...two bowls of ramen and 2 sodas will set you back $40 with tax and tip. ÊOn principle alone, ramen should just not cost that much, but with the long lines, I don't blame them for charging the premium.

Ack, what the heck. 1h 45m waits??? Ippudo in Fukuoka had a wait too, but not for 2 hours. It was a wait where you stood in line outside the ramenshop in Daimyo. But anyway, it was worth the wait to test it against my memories of Ippudo in Fukuoka, but I doubt I'll wait that long again. Our waiter was actually very helpful in explaining the menu differences which was a nice surprise. The pork buns are PRICEY but soooo sooo good. I just need to figure out that secret sauce then I think I could make them at home. The ramen was solid and good. I got the AKA modern which was the tonkotsu broth with some aka miso and such. It was good. I miss the DIY toppings that I loved in Japan though. And $2 for a friggin egg? Ridiculous. Do it if you're in the mood for a proper ramen. Although I have to warn--it's not low calorie.

Ok kiddies, I finally did it. I finally made it through the wait time to eat at Ippudo. about 90mins from when we put our name in to when we were seated. So what did I think? YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM!! It was awesome. I totally over ate but as a first timer, I feel like this is a usual mistake. Especially if you ask the hostess what should not be missed. btw the ribs - YUM! Now I will admit I am not a ramen connoisseur, but for me this does it! and really any place that has pork belly as an extra (were talking a serious portion of pork) is going to win me over. I was still thinking about it when I woke up this morning... what to order? pork buns!! Samurai Rib, and for the first timer, Akamaru Modern.

Thought I already reviewed this a long time ago, but guess not. ÊI've been there about four times now, and it's only getting four stars because my all-time fave is still a ramen joint in Rosemead, CA. :o) ÊHere's the relevant snippet for you folks from my soup blog: "...That's how good it was. ÊIt disappeared before I could remember that I didn't feel like eating and had to take notes. The broth is rich and porky, just the way I like it. ÊIf you didn't know better, you'd think their secret ingredient was milk. ÊAnd it blends nicely with the secret sauce and miso paste. ÊThe noodles are cooked relatively al dente, although I like mine a tad firmer. ÊThe optional menma adds a nice crunch to each bite, and I have no recollection of the wood ear mushrooms. ÊThey're usually tasteless anyway. ÊThe one thing I do remember about this experience is that the garlic oil was too much for me. ÊI could smell it right when the bowl was put in front of me. ÊI even made a comment to T that it smelled like a lot of garlic, and she said there was no garlic. ÊJust goes to show how sensitive I am to it. ÊGarlic lovers will probably barely notice its existence. ÊFinally, the pork chashu - I do remember the pork, so succulent that it just melts in your mouth."

This place is really nice. It isn't very large (when you walk in, the bar area is even small) but the decor made it a fancy experience. We came in a large group, so on our way to our table, almost all the servers stood on the sidelines greeting us in Japanese. They were very "audible". I've never eaten ramen aside from the instant kind at home so it was new to me. I was clueless really. I liked how the menu offered English explanations of the Japanese terms. I had the Aka Miso Ramen ($13 Red soy bean paste flavored ramen noodles in 'Ippudo chintan' clear chicken and pork soup with beansprouts, corn, cabbage, pork chashu & scallions) with an Onsen Tamago ($2 poached egg). My sister had the Ebi Wonton Ramen Ê ($13 Salt flavored ramen noodles in 'Ippudo chintan' clear chicken and pork soup with shrimp wonton, spinach & scallions) with an Onsen Tamago. Hers was yummy. Mine was okay. I liked the thicker noodles of my dish. Everyone else had thin noodles. I wish there were more meat bits than fat bits though. I thought I would have to get the $2 more extra noodles toward the end, but there was so much soup in the bowl that I was satisfied at the time. I wasn't planning to get dessert, but I felt bad that the waitress (who by the way wasn't the nicest) stood there waiting when only one person out of like 12 people ordered dessert. I got the matcha creme brulee and devoured it in like 5 seconds. Expensive but so yummy. After we left I was hungry again. I think next time I'll order the pork buns (which I totally forgot to do that day). Mehr!

This was not my 1st pickings, my brother took us here, coincidentally Dave H. has been. Very nice spot. Heard it gets packed. More for parties of 2- 3. Bigger parties usually get in easier for big tables. Very Cute, the theme, yelling " Welcome" -in Japanese. The servers was attentive, the water boy , just all in all good service. We tried the wings, extra crispy , pork wrapped in steam bun-Nice. I got the classic, seemed like alot, but the ramen noodles were just enough, just alot of broth. You can get extra toppings for extra 2.00 +. Just alot of food. Nice look inside,front gets a little cramped, but inside has nice seating, huge bamboo stalks bend into the ceiling , abiance quite nice.

I finally tried the infamous Ippudo yesterday for lunch. I think the menu is limited for lunch seeing how I didn't see dishes previously mentioned by my fellow Yelpers. For drinks I had the Citrus Yuzu Sake ($7) cocktail which was amazing. Usually I'm not a sake fan but I loved the grapefruit flavor to it. For entree I ordered the Akamaru Modern lunch set with the spicy cod roe over rice ($16). I liked the spicy cod roe a lot, it was very flavorful while the ramen was overwhelming. Ramen portions are large, the broth was flavorful, meat perfect & the noodles chewy/hard. While the ramen was yummy it was really just too much, I think I'd enjoy it more if they made it smaller. For dessert I had the Green Tea Creme Brulee ($7), I think they did it wrong. Perhaps they didn't mix it well enough & all the green tea sunk to the bottom. I wouldn't recommend this one. Overall, I enjoyed the experience & may even come back again for dinner to see the rest of their menu. The reason why I took a star down was 1/2 for the dessert & another 1/2 a star for the obnoxious screaming when you arrive, it was exciting at first but got annoying fast.

I just had to go back again for the Classic Ramen noodle with the pork belly, it was so good the first time. ÊThe small piece of pork belly just melts in your mouth. Well, to my disappointment the second time there I got two paper thin slices of pork tender loin that looked like they didn't reconstituted enough. Dry like camel dong! ÊThe only good thing was the noodle which was al dente! ÊEven the eel on rice was just okay, nothing to oodle about.

Come for the pork buns, stay for the ramen! ÊThese are my favorite pork buns in NYC, slightly edging out Momofuku. ÊI just like the sauce and the mayo flavor better. ÊWe also had the appetizer ribs which were very tender and delicious. The ramen is really good, too. ÊYou can rack up the price pretty quick by adding extras to the ramen, but really it would be fine without the extras. ÊSo, you have to come here at least to try the pork buns, but you'll certainly find many other delicious things on the menu.

First off, I've never had a ramen set that's actually filled me up. ÊIf it filled me up, it would only be decent ramen. ÊNot only was the food here great, but there's so many things about this place that make this place unbeatable. Now I've had ramen in LA, Chicago, Michigan, heck even several times in Japan, but the experience was nothing like it was here. Ê My friends had the different types of ramen, I had Akamaru and I didn't regret it. ÊI tried some of the other ramens and I had difficulty not wanting to eat their's too! ÊThe broth is perfect, great flavor, the noodles are plentiful and firm, the pork + rice side dish I had was delicious! ÊI added a little more spice to give it some heat which was great because it didn't change the flavor at all. ÊThey even offered MORE noodles for $2 in case you had leftover broth! ÊThe service was pleasant, relatively quick, and accurate. ÊA little on the pricey side but I expected to spend about $12-15 a bowl anyway. ÊWorth every penny. The only thing about this place is, avoid the dinner rush (or get there early); we had to leave because we didn't want to wait 2+ hours for dinner (and it was only 6:30PM). ÊCertainly if you want quality, you'll understand why there's lines out the door for this place.

Delicious food. There is a reason why tons of people wait on line each day, and that reason would be for the excellent ramen of Ippudo. Came here with a friend on a Saturday and it was well worth the wait. ÊSaid friend was not too hungry so he only ordered two appetizers and no ramen. Blasphemy I know. I ordered the Akamaru Modern ramen, which came with charsu pork, miso paste, and kikurage mushrooms, Êscallions, and garlic oil. The broth was smoky and flavorful, and definitely garlicky. It was well seasoned so that it was not overly salty, but not bland either. The noodles were thin, but perfectly cooked. The charsu was meltingly tender and delicious. The appetizers my friend ordered were delicious as well. He ordered the pork buns, a MUST ORDER, and some sort of lightly fried chicken (not the wings though). The pork in the pork buns was tender, moist, and extremely flavorful. They were spicy, sweet, and savory. So much incredible flavor. The bun was sweet, fluffy, and soft. I could probably eat every single day. The chicken was a bit bland, but came with a delicious dipping sauce that completely made up for it. Overall a great meal and I will definitely come back.

Ê It was packed, to say the least. ÊTHEN when they called our names, we crawled through all the people and walked up, and they had given our table away. ÊIt took us less than 15 seconds to get less than 10 feet, and they had ALREADY GIVEN AWAY OUR TABLE. Ê Food was okay, definitely not worth the price.

Ippudo blows the competition out of the water. ÊI doubt they really need 2000+ reviews saying the same things, but I'm going to add my 2 cents. ÊNot only is the food incredible here, from the pork buns to the ramen and beyond, but the atmosphere is well worth a visit. ÊPeople have been known to wait for hours (PLURAL) to get a seat at Ippudo. ÊWhen I got there 15 minutes before it even opened for dinner, there was already a line forming outside. ÊBy the time the doors opened, I felt like I was at Disneyland waiting to ride Space Mountain (well, maybe not so much, but I rarely wait in line to get into a restaurant before it even opens). When the hostess enters the dining room to seat a party, she loudly announces the table number in Japanese to the cooks, who shout back "Irashaimase" or "Welcome" in Japanese (I asked my waiter). ÊThey do this every single time someone is seated in the dining room. ÊI'd like to take this opportunity to point out that most of the staff is not Japanese. ÊAs part of their requirements to work there, the staff must learn certain Japanese phrases, as well as all the numbers so they can translate table numbers that are shouted to them in Japanese. ÊWhen food is ready, the cooks shout in Japanese for it to get picked up. ÊSitting at the bar, directly in front of some of the cooks, was a really fun experience! ÊI thought the environment of the restaurant was energetic and fun. ÊApparently this shouting in Japanese is a traditional part of the ramen experience. ÊThe entire experience was smooth and turnover is pretty fast, no waiting around for your food with a growling stomach. ÊAnd as a final thank you, a complimentary cup of tea. ÊIt's like they know me personally :) Arigato!

I'm from Japan and I know good taste of ramen. This place is so far the best ramen in NYC. It's Kyushu (south side of japan) style which is pork bone taste and thin straight noodle. (I actually love Sapporo : northern island names Hokkaido) style ramen which is yellow lil thick noddle, and miso taste) Taste is the best but lil pricy.. In japan, ippudo ramen is about 7-9$ ...(but also taste not good as NYC one) But I love this place! Because of my rate is 4, it's always long line (wait for hour) and pricey.

Went with a few friends during a Friday night and the wait wasn't that bad. Maybe it was because we were throwing back a few drinks and chit chatting while waiting but the time seemed to go by quickly. We ordered some appetizers before all ordering a bowl of ramen. The tako wasabi was completely bland. I don't even think they put salt on it. All I remember is they drenched a whole lot of sesame oil on the octopus. Fried chicken wings were good (c'mon, they're deep fried chicken wings...can't go wrong) but $7 bucks for 3 pieces...not worth it. I remember we ordered the Hirata buns but I unfortunately wasn't able to sample it. As for the ramen, it was my first time experiencing japanese ramen so I have to admit, it was good. The broth was rich and I wasn't able to finish my bowl (I usually never finish my dish of anything when I eat out). But at $19ish for a bowl of ramen...it's a bowl of ramen.

Two words: Êpork buns. Ippudo is a hot ramen spot and I'd been hearing all the raves about their noodles for a while now, but the stand out for me was the melt in your mouth pork buns - delicious, fluffy, amazing. I'll probably dream about the pork buns but the ramen was delish as well. ÊI got the Shoyu ramen, which was soy flavored. ÊIt was savory and generally satisfying. ÊIt was a lot of food and I couldn't even come close to finishing! Ê Ê The only annoying thing was the close-to-2 hour wait for a party of 2 on a Friday evening - but I knew about that going in, so can't really complain too much, right? ÊStill, I'd go back quicker if I knew I didn't have a huge wait ahead of me.

Let me start off by saying I am not a ramen lover, I actually never crave ramen. Ippudo NY gave it to me like I never could imagine. Everything from the food to the decor to the service was on par and I want to thank them for a great ramen experience. Start off your meal with the pork belly buns...yes! The Karaka Men lunch set with grilled eel over rice was the meal I didn't know I was longing for all this time. The ramen broth had just the right amount of spice and flavor in it. The only part of my experience that sucked is that I was not allowed to take the ramen out of the building. I just want to know what is it going to take to get an Ippudo in San Francisco?

Visited during a busy evening, and had to wait a little over an hour for a table on a Saturday evening. It was somewhat worth the wait though, as the Classic ramen was very tasty, but leaves something to be desired. In particular, the flavors in the soup base were authentic and true to its description (5 stars here!!!). However, the ramen itself was so-so, and the noodles broke easily without the chewiness typical of hand-made noodles (3 stars). The pork belly, while good, didn't feel as if it was worth the additional money. All-in-all, considering the reputation of the restaurant, it was a decent value for an enjoyable meal, but I expected more of it.

The pork buns and ramen at Ippudo are to die for! I still have dreams about the food at this place. Not only is it simply delectable, it's also extremely cheap for New York. $15-$20 for dinner.

The broth of this place is phenomenal, so please make sure you order a second helping of noodles to use up the broth. The char sui (pork) is tender and scrumptious.

YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM. ÊThis place is damn good. ÊI had their "modern" broth which was so flavorful and savory. ÊThe ramen was thin but good and al dente.

If I were to describe Ippudo in one word, it would be "trendy". ÊWhich for me, is a death sentence on a restaurant. ÊI'm definitely fine with a restaurant being trendy but if that's all it has going for it, then it's not worth going to. The first thing that I got hit with upon entering the restaurant is the loud techno at clubbing sound levels. ÊOh man, I can't enjoy my food in peace, nor have a decent conversation. ÊEveryone else is yelling when talking and so I have to as well. Ê The Special Tonkotsu ramen broth was thin on flavor and on material. ÊI chose extra spicy but it more added to the temperature level rather than actually give it different flavors. Noodles were thin too, not only from size but they were pretty limp too. ÊThe chicken wings were very good, similar in taste to Anchor Bar wings in Buffalo but crispier with less grease. ÊThe desserts were small but pretty good - tofu was firm and the bread on green tea ice cream was interesting. Waiters/waitresses in tight black outfits were cheerful but uncoordinated and slow to respond. ÊThey all looked very busy walking back and forth from the kitchen wearing worried smiles and holding nothing in their hands. ÊIt felt chaotic. ÊIt was hard to get anyone's attention beyond the initial menu taking; ÊI had to snipe anyone who was delivering food to get service. ÊI got my bill twice from two different people after asking a third person for it and waiting 15 minutes. I'd go back for the wings and the desserts but not the ramen, especially at $17 a bowl. ÊEven Oh! Taishio has better ramen than this at half the price. ÊNot to disparage Taishio because it is awesome, but more to deflate Ippudo's reputation. ÊIf you want even better ramen in the general area, look up Ramen Factory.

I loooooooooooooove this ramen! ÊIt's #1 on my list of top ramen. ÊMy bf loves Momofuku, and I have to admit it's pretty... but Ippudo is still my favorite. ÊIt is a bit on the pricey side for a bowl of noodles, but it's a nice treat once in a while. ÊThe broth is always amazing and the noodles are always cooked to perfection. ÊIt's definitely a filling bowl, but if you're a big eater you can always order extra noodles or pork to go with your meal. Ê Plus... service is always friendly and the decor is pretty modern too. Ê I definitely have to go back to try out their new ramen bowls in December.

If you can make it through the long wait, get over the interior and the trance music, the noodles are pretty good. I went in December when they had the special ramen where they actually shave charcoal into the broth - that was really good. I'm not sure I'd wait to have it again though.

Best ramen, hands down. Trust me, I'm Asian. I don't know why people complain that $12 is expensive for a bowl of ramen? Maybe it is expensive compared to Top Ramen, but $12 is a freaking steal for a bowl of creamy deliciousness (I always get the Miso ramen and it has a heavenly creamy flavor). Added bonus: Wait staff has AWESOME hair EAT: Miso ramen, pork buns/cabbage/tofu appetizer, extra pork belly (there are two types, the dark/smaller/more cube-shaped one is better and always has an espresso taste to it), black sugar plum wine SKIP: Your whining BOTTOM LINE: Best ramen of your life, will make you sleepy.

After a 5 hour flight to NY, rainy and cold weather, a hot bowl of Ramen is just what I needed! We went for lunch, which was great a deal. ÊWe waited about 10 minutes for our seat, which beats the long 2 hour wait at night. I would HIGHLY recommend the pork buns. ÊI didn't want to share.. I wanted it all to myself. Ê I only tried the pork ramen classic, the first one on the ramen menu. ÊI really enjoyed. also a note for all you big eaters, you can add more ramen for $3 after you finish all your noodles. also you can add a side order with your meal for about $3 dollars. ÊI got the eel over rice which was really yummy. and lets talk about the service.. AMAZING! they would fill my cup with water like...every 5 minutes and I also dropped my chopstick, and our server gave me a new one before I even finished picking my chopstick up.

Having lived in US for years, this is the closest ramen joint that reminds me of the ramen I had in Japan. Ê Unlike the watery crap I've had in other places, the soup base is thick and flavorful.

I' m a huge fan of ramen, and was looking forward to try my first NY bowl; from one of the best the city has to offer. Were arrived at 5:00 sharp and were seated immediately. I was surprised to find a trendy modern interior with Japanese rock music playing in the background. I ordered the Traditional Ê($13) it came with a small topping pickled ginger, menma, green onions, and half a hard boiled egg. The broth was a super rich tonkastu, full of flavor and depth but a little on the salty side. The noodles were good and quite thin but still firm; although i prefer thick. I only wished they had white pepper available to cut the saltiness. Whenever I have super rich ramen I end up with hiccups. Luckily Êa warm tea was served at the end of the meal. It was perfect for neutralizing the stomach and cured my hiccups immediately. I was happy to Êenjoy the ramen-induced-euphoria that followed. Overall it was quite a good bowl! If I am able to return in the future I defiantly want to try the Modern as it is more spicy and seemed to be what everyone was ordering. ÊMy only grief is that the price was a bit steep and that their isn't an Ippudo in California yet.

Nice, distinctive restaurant. Not your typical Japanese noodle bar. It's fancier and a good place to go if you're looking for ramen + atmosphere + you don't mind sharing a table. You can also get your own booth if you're a big party. For me, the ramen is okay but there's too much noodle+soup and not enough toppings. I'm a bigger fan of momofuku.

Dear Ippudo, Your pork buns are heavenly. It's been 3 days since I last had you and you are all I can think about. Why god?!? Why must I be so far from my delicious pork buns? Craving from San Francisco ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~?~~~~ Yea the pork buns are so delicious I want to make love to it. I'm not a fan of pork bun or ramen but I have become a believe thanks to Ippudo. Came here for lunch on a Thursday and luckily there was no line. Started our lunch with their pork buns and Yuza sake. These are not your usual pork buns. They are packed with juicy tender pork and the perfect amount of lettuce and sauce. It was love at first bite. I wanted to take some to go for my flight back so I could make everyone on the plane jealous of my food, but what?!? They don't do take out...NOOOOOO! Fine, I'll just move to New York for those buns. Now let's not forget the ramen. I got the spicy miso ramen. Just the right amount of spiciness, the ramen was the perfect texture and the broth brought all the flavors together. The rundown: Service: Amazing! Everyone greets you when you walk in. Our server did everything to make us happy. We had him running back and forth to the kitchen to hunt down a specific sake. He found it! Decor: modern chic JUST GO!!!!

We went to Ippudo for a late night bite to eat. ÊThe goal was to try their ramen. We ordered their classic ramen, cold ramen salad, and some pork buns. The pork buns came out first. ÊWow, these were even better than Momofuku's! ÊSame concept, but the sauce that Ippudo uses is better, a bit more complex in flavor and a little spicy. The ladies with us shared a ramen salad. ÊI had a bite and thought it was good. ÊNice concept. Now for the ramen. ÊThe broth, which I tried first, was really good. ÊHowever, as I ate the ramen and its ingredients, something was just missing. ÊThough the broth was good, the ramen as a whole just was not all that great. The restaurant itself did have a nice atmosphere though.

Yes - their pork buns are delicious! Yes - they have the best ramen in NYC! Yes - the wait is LONG! Okay, what don't you know about Ippudo? ÊThey are super kid-friendly! Ê;-) ÊI took my brother, sister-in-law, and 2-year-old nephew here when they visited from the Bay Area a few weeks ago. ÊAfter many hours of watching tennis at the US Open, we were starving. ÊIt was early enough (around 5ish) that I thought I might have a chance of getting us seated within a reasonable amount of time. Ê(Had tried taking my parents here the night before only to leave disappointed.) ÊWe walked in and were told a 15 minute wait - YEEESSS!!!!!! ÊWe got seated in one of the corner booths. ÊI was so impressed that they brought my nephew a small plastic cup with ice water without us even having to ask. ÊThey also supplied us with mini plastic bowl, spoon and fork for the little guy.

Mmm....ramen on a chilly day is the perfect way to complement winter weather. Êwent here with a friend on a saturday for lunch. Êthe wait was 20-25 min. Êonce we got in, we were seated at the community table, which was a little awkward but bearable. Êits so loud in there anyway that you have to spend so much energy trying to hear what the other person is saying you dont get distracted by neighboring eaters. i got the shoyu ramen with duck, my friend got the first ramen on the menu (i think the tonkatsu?) my dish was flavorful. the broth was a tad salty but a good balance for the ramen noodles, which were delicious. Êthe portions are satisfying, i had some broth left over (mainly because it had gotten cold because i was too busy savoring every slurp of broth/noodles. yes, its a bit on the pricey side for bowl of ramen. but man, oh man is it worth it if you are in the mood for a good bowl of ramen.

As the reviews below state, this is perhaps one of, if not the trendiest ramen places in NYC. ÊThe food is pretty damn good, I'm a fan of the broth, the noodles were the thin kind, I prefer the long, but the fact that you can get second helpings of noodles to drop into your noodle at a discount price is awesome for a fattie/foodie like me. The appetizers were pretty good, nothing to write home about, had better elsewhere, but definitely people come here for the ramen broth. All that being said.. I find it ridiculous to have to wait 40+ minutes every single time I come here. ÊIt's okay if you're with friends and grabbing a drink at the bar, (bartender was friendly enough and sake choices were pretty good/reasonable prices) but seriously? 40 minutes for ramen? I can walk down the street and find other joints with decent ramen at a better price... Still worth 4 stars for me because despite the waiting time and priciness for appetizers, the people there are friendly, food is good, and overall I enjoy my experience..

As if this place really needs more people telling you how good their food is. A group of friends and I came to this place around lunch time on a weekday. By a quarter to 12, we were expecting long lines for the lunch rush. Surprisingly, we waited for about five minutes in the very cute waiting area and were seated at a quiet table in the corner. I ordered the Yokohama along with the set of salad and eel on rice for $16. I was so excited for my ramen and when it finally came, I started eating first then realized I forgot to take a picture of it! The taste of the soup is really strong, but it's so good with the ramen. After finishing my bowl and downing an entire cup of water, I had this feeling of content that I have yet to experience with any kind of noodles/pasta. I seriously CANNOT wait to go back there again. On a side note that should probably not be mentioned in a restaurant review: go check out their bathrooms. The bathrooms (2 for women, 1 for men) are in the basement after you go down a flight of stairs from the waiting area, and I was really surprised by how clean and spacious it was. (There is, afterall, all the horror stories we hear about cramped and nasty NYC bathrooms.) The wall was interesting to look at while you're in there doing whatever it is you're doing :)

I should start by saying the atmosphere is lots of fun. ÊThe place looks fun, it's massively crowded, and loud. ÊWe sat at a treestump table, which was awesome. ÊWith that said, this probably wouldn't be great for older people or families (and the crowd reflected that). ÊThe food was good, but didn't live up to the hype. ÊThe bowl was on the small side, but decent (and you can add on noodles when you finish). ÊThe broth was tasty, but not the cleanest tasting. ÊI'm also personally a fan of the thicker noodles. ÊWorth the 1hr 25min wait? ÊMehh I probably wouldn't do it again, but I'm glad to have tried it.

I came here with a friend who had been hyping up the place for months. Even though we had to wait over two hours on a Friday night, it was worth it. The ramen was so good and delicious.

This place is awesome! The ramen is off the charts! I've eaten here twice, each time with a different ramen choice, and it has never disappointed. A little bit on the pricier side for ramen, but it was worth it. Unfortunately, ramen was all I ate (because you can get refills for an additional $3) so I can't say about the other foods here but I'm sure they're awesome. The staff was professional, attentive, but a tiny bit annoying. I agree that a staff should be energetic where they work, but the entire staff kept yelling out hellos and thank yous every 2 or 3 minutes as customers came and left. The restaurant is HUGE, and the decor is top notch. I haven't been to many restaurants where the decor just seemed to flow with the ambience. Here, there's always little details that you find yourself fixating on. :-)

I have found my Ramen place. This place tops Momofuku only slightly for me. The broth is really what won me over. It's smoky and rich and just makes you feel all safe and warm. This is what I think good Ramen is all about. The pork is good, nicely charred and adds good flavor to the overall soup. The noodles were ok, thinner than most ramen noodles but nothing too special. Bowls of Ramen are about $14 each. They do allow you to replenish your noodles as many times as you like for an extra $2 The restaurant has a really good ambiance. Seating is spacious and gives you a lounge like feel. The wait to get a table can be pretty long. We got here at 11pm and waited about 15 minutes which is pretty good. If you go during normal meal hours be prepared to wait. The people that work here are legit. Our waiter lived in Japan for a year and you could tell by the way he said the menu items. Our waiter was very helpful and nice.

All my friends love ippudo. Especially their pork buns. All the ramens have been tasted/devoured and given thumbs up. They have non-ramen entree options, too. But keep in mind a lot of it is pork and almost everything has meat. I am vegetarian and their menu is extremely limited in that regard. They have *one* vegetarian ramen (all the other ramens are made with a pork-broth so I can't just say "hold the meat, plz") that is okay. It's sorta bland, to be honest. I love their cucumber appetizer. It's salty and crisp and tasty. Also, fried pepper appetizer is not frightening hot like I thought it would be and was relieved I could eat it. I guess i have just loved my experience there enough to out-weigh the lack of food options. Service is always prompt and friendly (and fun and sometimes loud). They have alcohol (I love sake). It's great with friends....but prohibitively crowded on weekends. I will love this place even more when they put a couple more vegetarian options on the list (which isn't that hard to do!).

Pork bun! 4**** I got the pork bun and the Akamaru Modern. First bite of pork bun raised my expectation so high that I was disappointed with the Akamaru Modern. I'm sorry to say but it's not worth my waiting (45-60mins for 1 seat) if I'm gonna get the ramen only. It's way too salty and oh yeah, they don't take to-go order *pout* I hate waiting to be seated (eventhough I went there alone to avoid the waiting time... but still have to wait for 45 mins??! Crazy); I hate waiting for my glass to be filled; I hate waiting for my check to come...; I hate this place cause it's too noisy for a lazy dinner but what to do?? The pork bun is to-die for although it's expensive. $8 for 2 pork buns? And no to-go?? So that means I have to encounter all my hatreds for the waiting and place just to get my pork bun? Unfortunately, I'll say yes, I'm going to wait again and come to this place although I hate it. I'll do this just for you pork bun-sama. Just for you!

Best ramen I've ever had. What usually gets me when it comes to soup dishes like pho and ramen is that they are served super hot. At this place, it comes out a perfect temperature so that you can eat it as fast or as slow as you want. The miso was excellent, as were the noodles. Also, their appetizers are delicious. We got the pork rice burger which I highly recommend. If only they took reservations, I'd be here more often.

PORK BELLY HEAVEN! OK, obviously Ippudo is known for their ramen, but you can't go wrong with anything pork belly related on this menu. Top any ramen off with this yummy goodness and you will thank me =). I don't really have a favorite ramen... I usually go with the one that's on the specials and that strategy has never failed me! For appetizers, the harata buns with pork belly is a MUST, I forget the name, but it's a spicy tofu bowl (similar to korean (soondubu) tofu soup) but has it's own unique flavors and ingredients.. this app is AMAZING! I've also tried the pork in saikyo miso and the rice burgers - also made with pork belly (which I discovered they recently removed from the menu.. wehhh!) and both are delish as well! ÊThe shishito (deep fried japanese peppers) is a bit weird? - for lack of a better word. I wouldn't recommend it unless you really love peppers. The atmosphere is fun and lively. Good for groups, but might be too loud for young children. The wait can get long during dinner hours, but I usually try to get there before the rush starts at around 6-6:30PM. During this time the wait is minimal as long as your entire party is present. And best of all, prices are pretty moderate and worth every single penny!! I heart Ippudo!!!

I'm literally writing the 1,450th review of this place! Okay so despite that my experiences here have been mixed, I keep coming back. Four times now. Despite the hour long waits, the loud crowd, and the expensive prices, I still keep coming back. The roasted pork buns and the modern ramen are that worth it. The pork is so tender and fatty, and you can tell the broth has been simmering and brewing for a long time, till the taste was just perfect. Never had anything else on the menu besides the modern ramen and pork buns, but perhaps next time! If you've never been here before then I recommend it, but just be aware that if you don't get here by 11:30am for lunch or 5:00pm for dinner, you're going to wait a minimum of 45 minutes for a table.

Every visit to NYC warrants a visit to Ippudo. I would say it is one of the best ramen houses in the city. Ippudo exudes a sexy ambiance which makes it a great place for pre-gaming before a night out. Start off with their savory and sweet pork buns as appetizers, and end with a nice hot and brothy bowl of akamaru modern ramen. If you're a ramen lover, this place will not disappoint.

Located on 65 4th Ave. I heard there will be a 2 hours wait at Ippudo. I guess its just rumors. I was all hyped to come and eat at this restaurant. It was three of my friends and I for dinner. We all got drinks at the bar before being seated. They only had Soju in a cup with ice. That already made me feel uneasy. Then when we got seated, we ordered a few appetizers. The baby octopus with wasabi, pork buns, and fried spicy peppers. The octopus was pretty good, not as good as dish I had in Korea. The pork buns were awesome, but you cant really go wrong with pork buns, You can pretty much stick pork belly in anything and be good. The spicy peppers were okay, nothing special. For my entree, I ordered the special of the night, Wasabi infused Ramen. I got the ramen, it had no distinct colors of smell. It was just bland. The wasabi wasnt even strong in the broth. I was getting angry but i had to keep my cool for the white people that thought it was amazing at the table. So i asked the waitress if they had any spice I can add so they gave me this paste of hott red chili peppers, I added it to my ramen and it became good. Just the sharp spicy bold flavors I was looking for. Then after the meal I gave the waitress my number so she can come visit me

I think Ippudo definitely isn't as good as momofuku, but maybe it's because of my personal preferences in that: 1. I like my ramen noodles thicker rather than thinner 1. I don't enjoy mayo in my pork buns. ÊEw. ÊWhat. Don't get me wrong, it was good ramen, but next time if i'm going to wait an hour and a half for ramen, I'll do it at Momofuku.

I've heard many good things about Ippudo and I've been wanting to try it whenever I went to visit the city -- and I finally tried it this past weekend! ÊThe wait was 1.5 hours for 3 people, but it was well worth it because the portions are HUGE. ÊI enjoyed the pork buns very much, (in my opinion -- they were better than Momofuku!) and I ordered the Shiromaru Hakata Classic, which was a tonkatsu style ramen, with the pork belly on top. ÊAll of the food was very authentic, and the service was great. ÊIt is also a fun, cheerful environment. ÊI will definitely try this again!

I think this place is SO OVERRATED.. it's ridiculous. Granted, it's good.. But not amazing.. Came here with two other friends being told that the wait was 40 mins-1 hour to wait nearly 2 hours..I'm willing to wait but only if the stuff is worth it.. The broth was overly salty, oily.. and I just felt unhealthiness flowing through my veins.. Not my thing.. Not worth the wait, or the money or the excess calories. But the meal was somewhat redeemed with a complementary dessert courtesy of my sassy friend who spoke to the manager about the wait..

too trendy and too creative regarding their menu. I prefer the traditional ramen joints in Japan, simple menu, ramen and gyoza. Ippudo didn't even have gyoza and all the fancy untraditional toppings were bad .... dry meats .... very disappointing especially the long wait

I'd give it five stars but the rules of eating here/ queue is consistently difficult to deal with. You will not be allowed to make any alterations to any dish nor will you be allowed to order a dish if the kitchen runs out of any single ingredient in said dish. Also, if you can't finish your food you'll have to bring your own to-go containers. The wait-staff will at first try to 'politely convince' you that 'you shouldn't order that' but if you press the issue they will flat out tell you that the kitchen will not allow it because of how bad it would taste. Honestly though, the ramen (and the pork/chicken buns!) is so perfectly cooked and delicious that dealing with the Nazi staff is 100% worth it if you are prepared. In short, By all means eat at Ippudo but get there early and bring your own to-go containers.

One of the best bowls of Ramen I've had. Be prepared to wait a long time to get in. I won't fault the place for the hype. Just plan ahead and do something else in the wait time. The ramen here is VERY good. The noodles are made in house so it tastes very fresh. Loaded with flavour and not overly salty. I also shared the duck appetizer with my boyfriend. I thought it was extremely delicious and savory but he thought it was just OK. Highly recommended.

Their ramen is AMAZING!!! We went there for lunch on a Friday. It was very crowded but the food and experience is definitely worth the wait! We had the pork bun for appetizer. It was delicious. I don't know how they cooked it but the pork skin is crisp and the meat itself is so soft and tender. We decided to go with the lunch set. You can choose any ramen with a side rice dish. They also give you a side salad. I had the Akamaru Modern and the eel rice dish. So yummy! I was very satisfied and full afterward. I cannot wait to go back there again.

Best ramen outside of Japan! No question about it. ÊNothing in Hawaii even comes close. ÊYes, the 2 hour lines are well worth it when you taste the richness of the broth and the well textured noodles. ÊIt's truly HEAVEN ON EARTH. ÊTheir cold tofu and pork buns are excellent appetizers as well. ÊGood modern setting but the place can get very packed. ÊI see that some reviewers are complaining about the high prices. ÊPrices are set by supply and demand. ÊObviously with such a long waiting list, there is definitely a demand and no other ramen shop can supply such amazing food.

Had lunch here with two others around 1 on a Tuesday and only waited five minutes. It didn't look too packed inside, so maybe we missed the typical lunch rush. My friend and I had gone here before on a whim, but this time I took mental notes to really determine whether the ramen was as good as the reviews are. Food - I ordered the Akamaru ramen and loved every bit of it. The cabbage and mushrooms retained a slight crunch in the hot soup, and the thickly-cut pork belly's flavor really held its own. The noodles were chewy, not under- or over-cooked. The soup was amazing. Not salty, very savory, and I slurped up every drop. Service - Water glasses were always full, but the waiter wasn't around all the time which was good for us. It may have been annoying if we needed anything though. Overall, I really enjoyed Ippudo. I've never had other ramen in the city to compare, so I can't say it's the best but it's definitely a place I'd go back to many times.

This place was horrible. I usually get my ramen from places like Kenka in St. Marks and little shops in Chinatown for $6 but after reading all the great reviews about this place I had to try it for myself. There was an HOUR long wait and the place was packed at 11PM, I figured the place had to be good since there were people out the door. I was sorely dissapointed. The ramen I had was BLAND and mushy. The noodles they serve are not ramen noodles, I don't know what on earth they're serving but I've had authentic ramen and they do not serve authentic ramen. Their noodles are extremely thin and smush together. The portioins are small and the dishes are over priced for what they serve. I took three or four tastes of my entree then left with my boyfriend because I was just disgusted. If I wanted crappy ramen, I'd go to the grocery store.

Waiting for over an hour gets your appetite going and your saliva flowing. ÊSo when I sit down, I should be excited with my napkin tucked into my shirt and my chopsticks in my right hand ready to down some Ramen. ÊFor 14 bucks and tip, I expected more not only in quantity but in quality. ÊI got the Akamaru Modern which is okay, not the best I've had but not the worst.

oh my god. their ramen is so good that i even got an extra serving of noodle and finished most of the broth! :) Most of our table ordered the Akamaru Modern. It was so freakin' good, there aren't even words to describe how yummy it is... because you just have to taste it! Major food-gasm. We went last Halloween, so all of the employees there were dressed up and it was super cute! The servers are all nice too. Make sure you have somebody sign you up on the list when you go so the wait is shorter. I also love all the decor in the place. All the ramen bowls and noodles that you see! Highly recommended!!!

The wait is usually insanely long (2.5 hours on a friday night), but you can put your name down and saunter around st marks for a few hours pork buns are a must! Êthe bun is a fluffy piece of heaven, the pork is perfectly marinated and juicy, and the mayo/lettuce is the just the right touch. The downside is obviously the price tag.... $8 for two pork buns, and the pork is about 1/5 the size of the bun as for ramen, i always get the akamaru modern. ÊThe broth is thicker/creamier than the shoyu and it comes with a small ball of spices, tender pork, and some veggies (dunno what they are... but they're asian). My fave!!! the atmosphere is pretty cool. i Êusually sit all the way in the back so the tables are fairly roomy. Ênoise level is average for nyc (meaning its noisy) and the constant screaming of the staff starts to get annoying halfway through your meal. Êbut servers are usually pretty good, friendly, and fast

My friend really wanted to try this place out because of her experience in Japan. What she was really looking for were these specific dumplings/gyoza?Idk I'm not really sure though. Anyways, I got the classic red bowl ramen I think and we tried the pork buns which I actually really liked. It was flavorful and everything just went well together, the meat, sauce and the bun. The ramen and broth, although good, wasn't good enough for me. I guess there was just too much hype. The higher the expectation, the bigger the downfall. But anyways, it was a good amount of food that left me pretty full. It was pricey for a bowl though. But the atmosphere was really cool and it just seemed very modern and hip, and dark of course. But service was really good and friendly.

This is really more a 4.5 star rating, but only because of the obscenely long wait. ÊThree hours? ÊGoing into this I told the rest of my party, "this had better be worth the long wait." ÊI think the braised pork belly alone made it worthwhile. This was my first trip here, so the one member of our group that had been here previously recommended that I try the Akamaru Modern with Kakuni. ÊI wasn't absolutely enthralled by the pork buns we started with - I was expecting the bread to be a bit sweet to play off the pork, but hey, it was good nonetheless. That ramen though was the star of the show. ÊRich, flavorful, with a good amount of fat from that kakuni to bring it to the next level. ÊThe ramen itself was good enough - done just right, and soaking up all that miso paste flavor. ÊBut that pork. ÊOh that pork; with the fat that melts in your mouth; the flavor that makes you sit back and thank your deity of choice that you eat meat and that you were lucky enough to have experienced this at least once in your life. ÊIt's enough to make you just close your eyes and really enjoy the food. ÊWhen the bowl comes, you don't think it's enough. Ê"Just two slices of pork? ÊFor $4? ÊThat kind of money in Chinatown would get me an entire side of a pig." ÊBut it's enough. ÊIt's enough to indulge without having any of it go to waste. ÊI was on Cloud 9 after finishing the bowl, though now that I'm thinking of it again, I kind of want to say, "kae-dama" and finish off the rest of the broth that I left behind. Prices are on the higher side for what basically amounts to a bowl of noodles. ÊMy heart alone tells me that I shouldn't eat this more than once in awhile, and my wallet says the same thing. ÊBesides, too much of a good thing is never good (but enjoy it while you're there!)

My friend brought me here on a Friday night but of course it was packed and we were told that the wait would be at least an hour. ÊNah. So I came back on my own the following week for a quick lunch. ÊThe thing is, I don't love ramen, but it's convenient and quick and typically affordable. I ordered the standard ramen bowl. ÊI don't know what it's called. ÊThe first one on the list. ÊEh...and it arrived, and I ate as slowly as I could (because my friend had told me her reaction to seeing images of stomachs of people with varying eating speeds, and you can guess which looked less diseased) and I drank a bit of broth. ÊAnd then I was done. ÊYes, it was small, and $13 at that. ÊMy biggest complaint was that there simply weren't enough noodles. ÊI don't care for pork so I don't remember how much there was of it. ÊThe broth, it must be said, seemed a little less salty than typical broths. ÊJust enough to get a head tilt and small nod from me. ÊIt was rich but didn't strike me as greasy. ÊNo...I've had greasy broth before. ÊThat wasn't it. Service was decent. ÊIf you're big on your ramen bowl looking classy for a snapshot and that sort of thing, you might like it.

This place was really good, but pricey for ramen. I'm looking for more of a spot that resembled more like "Tampopo." Ambience is really nice and cozy. We had the pork belly, which was good, and the Akamaru ramen. The texture of the ramen isn't typical of most ramen places because the noodles looked hand-made. There was a wait, and our bill for a party of 4 came out to $88.00 (no drinks, including tip).

(excerpt of http://winglike.com/eat/É) Ippudo is a ramen chain in Japan that is notorious. When you think chain, don't think of Subways or other bad fast food chains in the US. Ramen is essentially fast food and there are many good chains in Japan. (Just like Menchanko-Tei in the states - They are part of the Onigashima chains) The one in Japan is slightly different than the one here. The taste is different. It tastes a bit more like pork. The Japanese chains also feature an all you can eat pickle pot with three different types of pickles. You can pick at them or put them in your soup. You can also order an order of rice and get unlimited amount of seconds. (although one would recommend getting a kaidama - second serving of noodles instead) And their ramens are under $10. The Ippudo here is surprisingly spacious with large tables shared by 10 or so people. However, they are massive enough that there is some privacy and a centerpiece separating the person sitting across from you. I say that they are surprisingly spacious, because if you go there around 7-8pm, they will always have at least an hour wait. I have found out that the perfect time to go is before 6pm or during lunch when they have a high turn around rate. The first time I went, I tried the akamaru. I was torn between the shiromaru (their house broth) and akamaru (their house broth with "special sauce" - which is basically garlic and additional spices). However, the akamaru was the right choice since they top off the whole thing with the spices and you can still taste the shiromaru broth if you don't mix it in. With the akamaru, you get the best of both worlds. The second time I went I got the Karakamen during lunch, which is a deal when you accompany the noodles with a oyakodon of chasu or mentaiko (you can get pork chasu or spicy codroe topped on a bowl of steaming rice) for an extra $3. I have to say that the best broth so far is the akamaru and that has been my saving grace. I have yet to try the miso or shoyu, but when the akamaru is this good it is hard to experiment with other flavors. The noodles are thin with a perfect chewy consistency. The broth is divine. It looks a little greasy, but it's buttery and full of flavor. It is saltier than it's Japanese counterpart. However, that does not take anything away from how delightful it is. The toppings are a bit sparcer with cabbage, scallions, and 2 melting Berkshire pork chasu. The kakuni (pork) oyakodon and the appetizer is not as religious of an experience, however. I suspect that these pork parts are left over from what they top the ramen with. The whole thing comes out to $12-13 and $2 for an extra ball of noodles. Whenever ordering a kaidama or an extra serving of noodles, conserve your soup! This is also the rare place that actually carries Ebisu beer. Mmm!

yes. the ramen here is pretty good. ÊMy second favorite I would say. ÊRight after Daikokuya in Los Angeles. ÊAll I had was a bowl of ramen so I can't comment on other stuff, and we went pretty late at night - at about 10 or 11? so there was no wait. ÊWhile I haven't had much ramen to compare to in NY, I would definitely come back here again. **update** So, apparently, I've been told my tastes are not refined enough, and "Ippudo is sooooo much better than Daikokuya". Êhaha for what it's worth. ÊI'm sticking to my guns here and like the heartiness of Daikokuya. Ê=D

Probably my fav ramen shop here in the city. I missed out on trying Ippudo when I was in Tokoy and was so excited to find out from their website that it was slated to open in 2008 in NYC. The date wasn't stated but the address of the restaurant was listed and I actually made my way there to the exact address mentioned on the website... only to find the place still under renovations... In terms of ramen, I'm a huge hakata / tonkatsu ramen fan. So I love love love Ippudo's thick pork broth soup base. I especially love their Shiomaru Moto Sji. That special sauce sure adds icing on the cake! I also usually have my ramen with a TON of japanese red chili flakes. That said, I guess my infatuation with Ippudo has somewhat simmered over the last few months. These days I tend to think that they are charging too high a price for a bowl of ramen. Also, they seem to do a poor job in managing the queues. Either that or they are just trying to create the hype about the place because EVERYTIME I've been there, the estimated wait time has always be at least 2 times longer than what it usually takes.

I had a great experience here and the ramen was the bomb sh*t. I had the special shoyu ramen with chasiu and it was amazingly good. ÊBroth was flavorful but not too heavy or fatty and the noodles were chewy and absorbed the flavor of the broth well. ÊI actually ordered a second helping of the noodles cause I liked it so much! Cha siu was not out of this world but it was good and went well together with everything else. The little pork buns were good and little but expensive for what you get. Ê(similar as momofuku's in quality but with a creamy mayo sauce and more veggies) The noodle room downstairs where you can watch them make the noodles fresh is kinda cool and the bar made from dry ramen noodles is cool.

This is by far the best ramen in NYC I've ever had. ÊThe soup is very rich and full of flavor. ÊIf you're hungry, then make sure you ask for the Kaedama (extra noodles) to add to your soup. ÊIt's a pretty good deal. My only problem with Ippudo is that they don't take reservations, so every time I go, me and my buddy end up waiting for a good 30+ minutes before we get seated.

The food was amazing. We waited (no joke) for 1.5 hours. We went at 6:30 (which is super early by NY standards) and didn't get seated until 8pm. I drank sake at the bar while waiting. We got the cucumbers (one of the most delicious things I've ever had!), grilled shishito peppers, chicken kara-age, shrimp buns (only ok), pork buns (WTH! the best pork buns EVER!) and we each had a bowl of ramen. I got the classic. It was good. A bit rich for me, but I know that this is how it's done traditionally. And although I was getting a little bit grumpy, it was worth the wait. The food was good. Too bad I felt like such a piggie walking out of that place...I waddled out.

NY Food Inspection Score: 4 Stars I hate to say it, especially because I paid for and completely devoured my meal, but I have had better. The wait for this place is ridiculous but that's ok. There's lots in the neighborhood to do while you're waiting or you can just kick it at their bar for a minute. I ordered the Miso Ramen and the broth was very good and buttery but the noodles were a little undercooked and the addition of pickled dikon was a bit unnecessary and made my soup a little more sour than I wanted it. But, I did enjoy it. I know that I can pay less for better places. I had bites of other folks (that I knew of course) like the Akamaru and the "80's style" ramen. Both broths were very tasty. But the service and ambiance is great. I really like the decor and the communal style tables. I would come back again but could never say that it is the best I've ever had.

I debated between 4 and 5 stars and figured that "Woohoo! As good as it gets! In NY and CA" should qualify. GET THE PORK BUNS! They look like tacos, but are made of the same basics as a char-su pork bun- BUT OH SO MUCH BETTER! I think these are hands down the best I've had in my life. And for 3 bucks each they better be. BROTH IS AWESOMENESS. Is the color of refried beans, but man, the broth is excellent. Can't imagine Tampopo would get it better. I got the spicy ramen, though I should have sprung for the very spicy. But the broth was thick and meaty without being greasy. I couldn't even begin to figure out how they make their stock. Now in all this excellence the one thing that was not perfection was the noodles. They were good, but not the best I ever had. Still can perfection be achieved in both broth and noodles? Hmmm. The wait is long (but the hostess is very organized and tells you how long the wait will be) and they don't take out (we tried to order extra noodles for someone at home). But the set-up is very nice and I really thought the set up inside was attractive, thoughtful and comfortable. The service is very courteous and attentive.The ladies in the front also were very well coordinated in gray and black.If I were a man, I would have tried to pick them up.

Ippudo is yet another ramen joint which opened in the East Village last year. The first American location of the wildly popular chain in Japan, Ippudo has had a big following since day one. ÊI braved the throngs of people last year, waiting over an hour for dinner at Ippudo. Was it worth the wait? ÊI'm not as sure as Frank Bruni, who gave Ippudo an effusive review. To appreciate Ippudo, you must be a lover of all things pork. ÊThe ramen is cooked beautifully and the broth is flavorful. By flavorful, I mean it screams of swine. ÊFor those pork lovers out there, you would be hard pressed to find a more "pork" infused broth around town. For me, it was a bit much - a little on the salty side and left me thirsty for the rest of the evening. However, I must concede that the meat was tender and the noodles were cooked to just the right temperature - light, with a bounce as opposed to the soggy versions easily found around town. One thing I would caution against - go for the ramen and do not stray. ÊThe temptation to order a side of vegetables is there - I know. But, that's where they get you - $7-8 dollars for 2 cucumbers. Overall, Ippudo is a fine option - but in my opinion not worth the hour + long waits. ÊFor a better option, check out Menchanko Tei. ÊGo for the Hakata ramen - pork with a rich white broth, scented with ginger.

Ippudo! When will I visit you again? I will definitely stop by right when your doors open for dinner so that I wouldn't have to wait on line! Last time I visited I had the Shoyu Ramen with a side of fried chicken. I don't really remember the chicken as much as the ramen. Filling, excellent.. mouth watering... My only qualm is that you're a bit pricey. I'll come back anyway.

The food was quite good. ÊThe wait a little too long. ÊThe service a little too slow, but I would go back. Had the Hirata Buns filled with pork, and was pleasantly surprised by the flavor as they looked a little sad. ÊI definitely prefer the pork buns from Momofuku over these, but they really are completely different. ÊMomofuku has the spicy sauce, and the ones here taste much sweeter. I got the Kogashi Miso Ramen which is the darker broth one. I had it with Bakudan which is the spicy paste. ÊI highly recommend doing this as it gave a kick to the ramen. Ê I'd be back, but I would definitely go to Momofuku Ssam Bar and Momofuku Noodle Bar before coming here.

The meal was great. ÊThe appetizers were a mixed bag -- the fried pork was more to my liking than octopus, shrimp and potatoes floating in jelly... ÊBut that was all in the past when we got our entrees. ÊDelicious broth, tasty noodles, well-prepared meats and toppings. ÊThe ramen selection was shorter than I expected, but there's still some good variety. ÊPlus, the specials are definitely worth a look for interesting twists -- when we were there it was wasabi-flavored noodles, a good option if that's your taste. So this is tasty ramen in a bustling, loud but fun atmosphere. ÊIf you don't mind the wait (up to an hour if it's especially busy), this place is definitely worth a visit. ÊYou could probably find comparable food faster at a less trendy place, but I'm no ramen connoisseur.

Absolutely the best bowl of Ramen I have EVER had in my life. My friend and I got the dish that comes in the RED bowl (i think all their soups are bowl coded) and I had mine sans the pork, since I dont eat pork meat, but will enjoy the F**K out of the broth. It was worth the hour wait, and it was so enjoyable we got the extra noodles for a second helping. Also enjoyable was the cucumber, but it's something you can make at home. The ramen is something even though you could make at home, it would never ever taste as flavorful and complex as it does here.

I was hopeful that Ippudo would completely change my perspective on ramen. After all, there aren't too many places that have a 45 minute wait at Ê9:30 on a Sunday night. But alas, I was disappointed. That's not to say the food was bad by any means. I had the Akamaru almost as a random choice. The broth was pretty tasty, but the piece of pork was the best part of the meal -- some real quality meat. The noodles, on the other hand, just didn't seem that special. They were certainly fresh, but I would have appreciated a bit more chewiness -- they weren't hard or anything, but they seemed a stiff in a way. I would have felt like I missed out on something walking past Ippudo nearly every day and never eating there. It was good food, but for the price and the wait, I don't think I'll ever be back.

This place always has a line out the door for a reason. Protip: ditch your friends and go alone to be seated quickly. Your best bet is a late lunch on a weekday. Definitely the best ramen I've had thus far in the city, authenticity or what-have-you be damned. The broth is rich, the noodles are firm, and the pork toppings fatty and tender. Depending on my mood, I will get either the Modern or Hakata Classic. Both are excellent; the Modern is more complex and garlicky whereas the Hakata is better suited to ramen purists (but equally good). Oh, and the chicken wings ain't bad, either.

If you're here, you must absolutely order the bbq pork bun! something about the addicting sauce that'll keep you craving more. ÊThe bf and I saw a waitress piling her rice bowl with bbq pork drenched in their special sauce and immediately asked if that was offered on the menu...sadly it was only an Ippudo employee perk. The Ramen here was delish! I had the shoyu and I believe the bf had the akamaru modern, and I enjoyed my shoyu so so so much. ÊIt was a perfect and wonderful balance of the ramen and the tasty broth. ÊThe broth was packed with pork flavor goodness, and it was thick but not too thick, tasty and yet not too salty. ÊThe noodles were fresh and chewy, and yet at the same time also crunchy... One of the best ramen places I've been to....the wait is well worth it. ÊMy bf had to refrain me from licking the bowl.

For review #1000, there aint much I can say that hasnt been said. GET THERE. ASAP. This is the best ramen I've had outside Japan. If you're not sure what to get, absolutely take your server's suggestions. THey know their stuff and every time I went they pointed me in the right direction. Hostesses are friendly and efficient, definitely flying in the face of NY's tradition of horrendous hosts at popular places. I had the classic tonkatsu ramen, the garlic ramen, the shoyu ramen, and some special they had that day. All awesome. I think I like the classic best, but the shoyu is a close second. And who doesn't love kae-dama - their system for letting you order more noodles if you still have plenty of broth at the bottom of your bowl? Split it with a friend or two, or go whole-hog and dump it in. Go nuts. Now I've returned to my empty, pathetic existence in San Francisco where there is no IPPUDO and local ramen joints cant compare. Rei, you're a fantastic server and next time I'm in town Im coming to see you.

The food was lovely but I've got to start with the noise. Here's the thing: The hostess, waitstaff, and cooks SHOUT a welcome greeting (in Japanese) to every entering party. AND they shout back and forth to each other. So any table conversation is interrupted by these outbursts. I suspect this scenario is an affectation; I lived in Tokyo for a school semester and I never saw this practice carried out to such lengths. It is most certainly contrived. All that having been said, the ramen was yummy. We went with our personable and knowledgeable waitress's recommendations and started with the crispy chicken legs and steamed pork buns. The three of us agreed that they were exceptionally delicious. The waitress also suggested that two orders of ramen were sufficient for three. She said that she didn't want us to find ourselves with a surplus of food because the restaurant policy did not allow for "doggie bags". We ordered the classic tonkatsu ramen and another of her choosing, a little spicier. I preferred the latter but both were very good. Following her prediction, we had just enough food with just enough room for a light dessert. This was the green tea brulee, a creme brulee with a perfect filagree but made with green tea in the custard base. It was complemented with a small scoop of green tea ice cream. It really was a wonderful meal but that missing star is for the noise. Yes, I'd visit here again alone or with one other person but a group conversation is impossible with the sporadic noisy bursts of greeting. Seriously, Ippudo, it's overdone!

Probably the best Ramen I've had in New York, loved the Ippudo Special Ramen. It's amazing that their boiled egg is always perfectly salty and liquidy-oozy in the center. The broth was also delicious on it's own. $13 for Ramen may be a tad steep but considering the location and comparable food you can get in NY with $13, this place is definitely hands down worth the price. The only reason why I am not rating this place 5 stars is because of the wait. The hostess indicated about half an hour for two but it really turned out to be Êan hour.

For those that really know me, they know that I gave up pork when I was ten because I fell in love with my stuffed pig. One day my mom thought she was being funny and said, "Well if you really loved Hamton you wouldn't be eating that sausage." After a good 2 hours of big doe eye, mouth in an "o" silence and reflection, I gave up pork. There have been a couple cheats here and there (like the time Jarrett and Matt and I walked 7 hours from one side of Shanghai to the other and then waited in line for 1 hour for the most famous soup PORK dumplings in the world...it would have been ridiculous to not have one. honestly it was good but I could have done without) for the most part in the last 20 years but for the most part, I have been a faithful follower of the swine. Ê Flashforward to Ippudo where we waited 1 hour for a table and ran back from the Bao place (again...don't want to talk about it) and I find out every ramen dish has pork in it. ÊThe server gently says, "we're really known for our pork. it's what we do" ÊSo I order the duck ramen which has pork in the broth but I figure I won't ingest too much. Not the greatest...though the ramen was the BEST. Then...Jean sees my big doe eyes staring at her Modern dish with the pork flavored pork on pork slathered in pork with a dash of pork. ÊShe give me one sip of the broth that tastes DISTINCTLY like pork skin which aside from pig tongue is the only other thing about the pig that I remember that I miss. Yeah...twas worth it. ÊI will be ordering the Modern next time and wait 2 freakin hours.

I may have set some kind of record (fine personal record). I made it from Murray Hill, ate and went back within an hour. I came here during lunch time and was able to avoid the usual dinner wait. Note: this is definitely not the place for a quiet lunch, with all the yells of welcome as you are directed to your seat. *Pork buns-Meh. I liked the hint of spiciness the pork buns had to offer, but I wasn't impressed. I think the baos at Baohaus were better, so I probably wouldn't order this here again. I have yet to try Momofuku's version. *Shiromaru Hakata Classic- ÊThe broth had a bit of creaminess to it and was good even before I added the buddaken (chili sauce you can order on the side) to it. In fact it was so delicious that I almost considered not adding the hot sauce (completely abnormal for me). I'm just not sure if it was worth the money to eat here again. Maybe if I didn't order the baos and just stuck to the ramen. The buddaken seemed overpriced for what it was. Don't get me wrong...this is still great ramen, probably one of the bests I've had. But, when I look at my bank statement for lunch? Ouch.

I came here for dinner on a Sunday night and the wait was an hour and a half. You think we would have left, but no, we stayed, and let me tell you it was WELL WORTH IT. Ippudo one of the best ramen I have ever tasted in the US. This hip, lounge like restaurant serves up Japanese fusion appetizers and traditional and new styles of ramen. Three of us ordered the Akamaru Modern Ramen and one ordered the vegetarian option ramen. The ramen itself was thiner than normal and had a specific taste of their own. The ramen wasnt masked by the broth and you can taste each strand of noodle. The modern raman had a delicious pork base broth with a few slices of pork, mushroom, bamboo shoots, a doolop of spicy miso and for mine, I ordered an egg. The egg was marinated and poached perfectly. The vegetarian ramen had a seaweed broth with seaweed, tofu and mushrooms. The broth was clean and very tasty. Perfect ramen, perfect broth. What more is there to say?

Now when I hear ramen noodles, I think Ippudo's and why doesn't Kansas City have something like this! The pork belly was VERY tender and tasty too. Oh yeah, get the poached egg if it doesn't come with it already. Experience Summary * Great staff and service * The people and the inside of the building have a lot of character.

Came here a day after Momofuku, and a couple weeks after Minca in a quest to find the best ramen. Wait was 2 1/2 hours, and the ramen was OK. My friend from Singapore claimed the "classic" bowl tasted quite Americanized to him; I thought my "modern" bowl was decent, though slightly salty. Their pork buns were also a little more seasoned & sweet compared to Momofuku's. It wasn't exactly a desirable difference. On the bright side, their raw octopus (or was it squid?) appetizer was excellent. All in all, Ippudo seemed the least tasty of the bunch. If you can get in without a crazy wait though, go for it!

Perhaps the best ramen I've had in the United States. Definitely the best I've had in New York. Especially loved the akamaru modern and the hirata buns. So far have tried the akamaru modern, shiromaru classic, miso and wasabi shoyu. I look forward to trying the rest. I will say that the wasabi shoyu is almost like a soba type of broth not a typical ramen broth (it even has abura-age the main ingredient of kitsune soba) but still very good. Wish I could eat here everyday. The only downside is that a bowl of ramen is about 15 dollars. I'd like to mark them down for this but really they are a five star establishment. In Japan it's almost impossible to find ramen over 10 bucks though.

The ramen here is surprisingly good. It's just as good as some of the best ramen served in the homeland of ramen, which is Japan. They feature Kyushu style ramen, which is my favorite kind. They serve "kaedama" which is rare in Japan, let alone in the States, but I always order a kaedama if the ramen shop has it on its menu. I'd much rather have more noodles than a bowl of fried rice to fill my tummy. Enough has been said about the pork belly, so I'll skip the details. I would be happy even if this was the last ramen restaurant left on earth, and I will repeat as often as possible, but that said... - The last time I was here, the broth was perfect. This time around, the same broth seemed to lack the richness I enjoyed the first time. Lacking quality control? - The wait after the order is made, is too long. It shouldn't take that long to prepare ramen. The kaedama came in seconds, so that was great. - Noisy. Just noisy. They may be picking up the tradition from their main branch in Japan, but I feel the yelling between the waiters and cooks are a bit too excessive. Almost military-esque how one yell ignites the whole battalion of waiters to scream out their lungs. - You may need to wait a loooong time to be seated. I know a few things they can do to speed things up, but I'll let then know if they call me!

How yummy this was! Knowing about their huge lines, we got there about quarter after 4pm thinking we could sneak in for a late lunch / really early dinner ... turns out they close after lunch at 3:30pm and reopen at 5pm for dinner. so we started the dinner line figuring we would be waiting 45min+ anyway ... sure enough, the line quickly formed behind us when the time came, we walked in and received an exuberant greeting from the staff - it was great the first 3 times, then you realize it's not so fun to be hearing that throughout your meal as new customers enter the dining area ... a little after that you stop to notice, so all-in-all not terrible and it is kind of fun! i thought the restaurant was a little dark - but then again - that might just be my inner grandma whining ... onto the food! Edamame with yuzu salt - the yuzu salt comes on the side so you can have as much or as little as you would like - don't think i've had yuzu salt before - kind of had a sweet / zangy taste to it - yum! Tako Wasabi (raw octopus in fresh diced wasabi) - loved this so much we ended up asking for a second order! the octopus was really fresh and that wasabi - man! spiiiicy! since it was my first time here, i didn't venture too far into the different ramen toppings and just went for the Shiromaru Hakata Classic - it had an awesome broth, lots of meat and i really liked the red pickled ginger in it - kind of freshened it up a little whenever you got a little bite (i love ginger!)

If you look up the definition of overhyped, you'll definitely find Ippudo right next to it. The only good thing about the place is the decoration. The bar table is decorated with instant-ramen. The fireplace right next to the dining table is way nifty too. Coming from California, the ramen at Ippudo was average at best. I understand things are naturally more expensive in NYC. That being said, being in NYC does not justify the hefty $14 price tag for the ramen (it is literally twice as expensive as the ramen in the bay area). Overall: Ippudo: an awesome place for sub-par and overpriced ramen. Also a great place to waste time as well (wait time easily exceeds an hour, even on a week night).

We have tried to get into this place many times, but this time we decided to put our name in at 7:00 for a 9:30 time slot. The atmosphere was thriving and the service was impeccable, and they were able to keep up with my dehdrated self by filling my water glass ever 30 secs. It took us 45 mins to eat, which means a normal wait time at this place is longer than youre actually sitting for. HOWEVER--------------------------------- a HUGE complaint of mine: WHAT IS UP WITH THE 2 PIECES OF PORK IN MY MODERN BOWL?! $15 BUCKS and all you get is 2 measly pieces of meat the size of a half dollar. ÊI think that is ridiculous and just rude!! have the pork buns, sad that I only got to eat 1, since the plate comes with 2 small ones. But the tender meat is delish, and the soft buns make me want to make a bed outta whatever goodness they are made of. fabuloso..but the 2 pieces of pork in my soup really ticked me off. Atleast a warniing would have been nice so that I could have savored the 2 pieces I had. The whole time I was on a search for the missing meat on the bottom of my bowl...let down big time!

When it comes to Japanese food, I'm old school. I don't like dairy or neon-colored sauce on my sushi and I dislike fancified $14 bowls of ramen when a well-made, traditional version can taste like heaven on its own. This was my last ditch attempt to find great ramen in NYC, and I was cautiously optimistic given the 2,200+ reviews. But ultimately, Ippudo was just OK. That's right. Just OK. The atmosphere is definitely fun and it's always a kick hearing "Irasshaimase!" echoed 50 million times when people enter the restaurant, so I'll give them points for that. I was also excited that they serve tonkotsu style ramen (cloudy broth made from pork bones). I had the Spicy Miso Tonkotsu. While it was a tasty bowl of soup, it didn't have enough porky flavor and the cabbage topping was also throwing me off. Hard to place my finger on exactly what wasn't right, but it just didn't satisfy my ramen craving. Husband got the special Kumamoto Tonkotsu Ramen, which basically seemed to be the same as the Akamaru Modern but according to our server was supposed to be "smokier" due to the garlic oil. Well, maybe he should have stuck w/ the regular version b/c the garlic oil completely overwhelmed the broth. If you couldn't taste much pork in my soup, you definitely couldn't taste it in his. Granted, maybe one of us should have ordered the original "Classic" to at least establish a baseline, so our fault for that. But I've also had better versions of the variations. I also don't understand the variations of which toppings are paired with which soups. Why not just offer everything on all soups or make it all a la carte? There were 2 other Asian couples sitting on either side of us and we overheard one person in each party comment that they also thought the ramen was just OK--one girl pointed out that Ippudo is where she goes in NY but it's not as good as what you can get in California. I couldn't agree more. Ippudo does a nice bowl of noodle soup, but it's not GREAT RAMEN. For that, you just can't beat the West Coast (unless of course you go to Japan).

BEST ramen ever... Very nice decor, atmosphere... Been a little over a year since I've been here but my memory is still pretty fresh. Ramen was absolutely perfect w/ the right texture and full of flavor. The little ramen machine makers downstairs on the way to the bathroom was very cool. Definitely a must-try if you're a fan of ramen!

This Ramen noodle house is THE most reviewed restaurant in all of Manhattan (crazy right), and a bunch of my friends have raved about this place, so it was only a matter of time that I tried it out. I came here for Saturday lunch, and as expected, the wait was about 30-45 minutes. Luckily, they allowed my sister and I to step out and come back. When we finally got seated and our food came out, the first thing that my sister said was, "Ate this was definitely worth the wait", as she took a bite out of her pork buns. This joint is popular for having the best Ramen noodles and the best pork buns in all of NYC. I have to agree. The Ramen was hot, full of flavor, and chunky with noodles, vegetables, and spices. The pork buns are also delicious. It was a little fatty, and I had to cut the fat out, but I guess all pork buns come like that. Overall, I do think this place is a little overrated (I don't think this is at all the best restaurant in all of NYC), but I also see why people love this place.. Ramen and pork buns is love, it's filling and it just warms the heart.

Today I went there for the second time just because I had wonderful ramen there before but it was a little bit disappointing. I had ramen with chicken broth instead of the pork broth I had last time which was way much better that what I had today. And compared with the price, the noodle is far away from "enough" for a guy with an average appetite.

There was not a single thing I ate here that I did not absolutely LOVE. We came around 5:30 on a weekday, so there was no wait at all. - The soy Braised pork belly appetizer melted in my mouth and it was so flavorful and moist. (It's obviously very fatty, but I love that in food) - Chicken wings: Amazing! Perfect crust on the outside, light on the glaze, and juicy in the middle. Yes, they're a simple food, but there is certainly an art form that these guys have down. - Shiromaru Hakata Classic Ramen : nice blend, not too salty and just nice solid (as they put it) "Japanese Soul Food" - Green Tea Brulee. Holy Crap. Delicious. The staff was very attentive and friendly. I did not feel rushed, and the interior decor was cool. Price? Just the icing on the very delicious cake.

DELICIOUS!!! ÊMy friends came from out of town and we came here for dinner, but they were packed and the wait time was at least 45 minutes. ÊWe had switched restaurants so we didn't have any reservations. ÊWe decided we were too hungry to wait so we went to another restaurant nearby. Ê Well, after we finished eating at the other restaurant, we decided to grab a second dinner! ÊYes, immediately after our first dinner! ÊNeedless to say, we felt like we were going to explode afterwards. Ê With that in mind, we still thought it was worth it to stop by. ÊWe of course had the pork buns, which were delicious as always.

Good noodles. Ê Food: Ê4.5 stars Service: Ê4 stars Decor: Ê4 stars I would recommend going in as a pair, since they tend to seat groups of two fairly quickly at the communal tables. Ê There are more limited seating areas for larger groups, so be prepared to wait. ÊIn the evenings, the average wait time is likely an hour+ for a group of four. Ê Ramen is fast food in Japan, so it's hard for me to stomach the wait and high prices, but the noodles are good, and that is what is most important.

Let me tell you a little story. ÊA few years ago, I moved to Connecticut from Los Angeles for graduate school. ÊTwo of my friends from home came to visit me, and we made a trip to NYC. ÊOn a rainy Wednesday afternoon we stumbled across a ramen place and decided to give it a try. ÊThis was one of the best decisions I have ever made in my life. ÊThe meat was so tender and juicy. ÊIt literally melted in my mouth. ÊThe broth was the perfect flavor and consistency, and the noodles were juuuuust right. ÊI left floating on a cloud of ramen love. ÊThe only problem was, I didn't bother to remember the name of the place or where it was. ÊBeing from out of town, none of my friends did either. ÊFor months, I could not remember anything about the place besides how delicious the ramen was. ÊI felt like the prince from Cinderella with nothing but a glass slipper to guide me. ÊThen one night it came to me in a dream. Ê"Take the 6 train to Astor Place." ÊI jumped out of bed and googled "Astor Place, ramen" and Ippudo showed up on my screen. ÊThe search was over. ÊI had found her. Ê Every time I am back in NY I make it a point to eat at Ippudo. ÊI haven't found a ramen place like this anywhere else. ÊThis is certainly one of my favorite places in NYC. ÊThe only thing that prevents me from a 5 star rating is that the wait can be rather long. ÊBut, hey, nobody is perfect, right?

Question of the day: Ippudo NY vs. Momofuku Noodle Bar Result: Ippudo NY!! Went to Ippudo with my roomie for an early dinner. Foodwise, I would give it four stars - their signature ramen was delicious with thin noodles that are much easier to eat and a broth that was so fantastic that I actually drank some! But the fish buns were a little above average (although their wasabi mayo was amazing..especially when I hate mayo...) and the sauce they used in the pork bun was good but the pork itself didn't melt in my mouth like that of Momofuku's... BUT: the decor of the place is amazing..with wonderful service (awesome waiter! he had a crazy wicked tattoo all over his right arm but a keroppi watch from mcdonald's on his left wrist! I really wanted that watch!!) and the price was $6 than what my roommate and I paid for at Momofuku's, giving it one more star! I will be back to try their special ramen (without the intestine of course!)!!

First time I tried to go here, there was a 1 hour wait. I'm a lover of all things noodle, but I wasn't about to wait an hour for a bowl of ramen. Next time I tried, it was only 40 minutes. I took the bait and am glad I did. Waiting at the bar area, you'd think there were only a handfull of tables. Once you get inside, you see the place actually wraps around and has plenty of seating. We started out w/some pork belly which was very tender and juicy. For ramen, I had the shiomaru. The broth tasted so good. It wasn't bland or salty... just right. The pork slices were also just as tasty. For a couple dollars more, you can get double the ramen. I may have to do that next time. And the bar has a great selection of sake. Only thing that seemed weird was the non-Japanese waiters with Japanese-like nuisances.

The broth was the best I've tasted from all the other ramen places in ny but my least favorite part of the meal were the noodles. Yeah, I guess they're freshly made and all, but they're thinner than what I prefer. I got the Akamaru ramen. In the midst of my meal, some guy with a garlic presser came around and asked if I wanted more fresh garlic pressed in the broth. Hells yeah, I said yes. My mouth was delightfully unkissable afterwards and I was one happy clam. My vegetarian friend got a salad and a tofu dish and they both tasted delicious and were elegantly presented. Too bad the portions are a bit small.

Yumminess... great place! When I saw the people waiting outside and at the bar, it was kind a noisy but inside, where I was seated was quiet and nice. My husband loved their spicy tofu pot thingy. It was too spicy for me but yum! Of course their ramen are great. I had akamaru, which has a red yummy drop of paste in Tonkotsu (pork broth) ramen. HMMMMMM pork! Their Chashu is also yum!

This place is amazing. The ramen was fresh, with very tasty and flavorful broth, and the pork was so delicious and melted in your mouth (and I usually don't like the fat on pork, but this one made it taste like bacon!). Also, the dessert was very memorable. For this popular place, the wait last Saturday night was surprisingly short (20 minutes)! I had the Akamaru Modern ramen, and I loved it. My wonderful friend, who introduced me to this place, had the spicy ramen (I think it's the third or fourth one on the menu). She liked a lot, too. I've never had the ramen at this restaurant's original Japan location, but this NY ramen is one of the best ramen I've ever had (amongst some of my favorite places in Japan). So, yay! And a lot of the employees (and customers) were Japanese. I couldn't resist in getting my favorite dessert, so I indulged in the creme brulee; however, it was maccha-flavored creme brulee. It also came with a bit of strawberries, a cherry, and a maccha jelly thing. The green appearance of the creme brulee, in general, may not seem so appetizing (well, this may not pertain to maccha lovers), but once you break through the delicious hard-sugared top, you'll see a paler, prettier creme inside... and the flavor is so maccha and creamy! Different than your traditional creme brulee, but still delicious, in a maccha way! If I lived in NY, I'd come here all the time. :)

I usually don't really like ramen but I would have to say that I had a very pleasant experience here! ÊI enjoyed the hip ambiance because I came with 7 people but we were put in a very spacious table. ÊHowever, I did not enjoy the horribly long wait we had to go through before that. ÊEven though they tell you, "you're next", plan on waiting around for another 30-45 minutes on top of that! ÊI suggest to keep going back in to check on your update instead of waiting outside, even though they say they'll come outside to get you. (yeah right!) There's one very highly recommended ramen noodle that everyone gets which I think is called the Akamaru, but some of us tried the miso spicy ramen which is also really good! The spicy miso ramen is thicker, less soupy and has this spice kick to it---if you're into that stuff then go for it! If you want to stick to a more traditional ramen, then just stick to the akamaru or ask your waiter. Overall it was a pretty pleasant experience, good service, good ambiance and good ramen!

If you love Ramen and are willing to pay a bit extra ($12-15 a bowl) than you're used to, Ippudo is where you want to go. I've been here twice and tried both the original Tonkatsu and special Akamaru ramen. Both were very tasty, although I liked the Akamaru better. The reason why you're paying extra is because this is not your hole-in-the-wall, tiny space, sit at bar, ramen place. There is large, comfortable seating available, and fancy internal decorations. A great fun, but "classy" date spot if you're in the mood for ramen.

This was my first foray into Japanese ramen in NYC. ÊLong wait for a table, but I thought it was well worth the wait! The decor is kind of funky but simple. ÊMy group of five got one of the booths, which was pretty big, probably could have fit at least 8 people. We all ordered the Akamaru Modern, and I ordered some menma (seasoned bamboo shoots) added to mine. ÊThe noodles were fresh and had a nice, slightly-chewy texture to them. ÊBut the best part of of the dish is the BROTH. ÊI couldn't stop telling my dining companions how good it was, in between slurps of noodles and soup.

OK... so I dont need to write much about this place. Every one knows it is yums. And if you dont agree, then you must have some sort of high standard of ramen. It is only ramen! The only reasons why I did not rate this a 5 is because of the wait and the price. It is sort of pricey for ramen, but it is sooo good. How can you resist? Go at 11:45am on weekends for quick seating, weekdays or have crazy patience to wait. The cost... eat pb&j for like a few meals if you are "worried" about the economy. I always get the modern ramen (whatever it is called) plus braised pork belly. ÊI have tried others the first few times i have been here and dont really remember them. I say if you havent tried it, then you should. If you feel its too expensive to even think about it... then go look for the review on street meat. This place aint for you. ave price of ramen: $13 plus pork belly $3 = $16 of yummy goodness

This obviously is a trendy place whose pretentiousness has gone awry. That may be an attribute that merits a bonus star in some people's book, but personally I can't find anything more unpleasant and distasteful. That said, if the food is good, I'll look past it. Now, I may be biased about ramen because I used to live in Japan and have gotten spoiled with really good ramen. But this place is not bad even by Japan standards. Might be as good as it's going to get in New York, but frankly enough I haven't tried enough ramen places here to know. When we went the line was an hour long, even though when we got seated it was obvious there was quite a bit of empty seating inside. That was kind of sneaky of them.

The ramen is awesome but the wait can be really bad if you come around prime time. ÊBroth has excellent flavor and isn't overly fatty like Momofuku's and the noodles are perfect. Try the tsuke-men which is one of the best in town. ÊBest thing I like about this place is that they give you the option of ordering extra noodles. Decor is modern, situated in a large space. ÊThe waiting area has a bar with snacks (pork buns a la Momofuku) and is a magnet for Asian hipsters on the weekends (except for the time I saw a white guy order a beer with his baby on the bar!).

I am going to have to add to the love--which is something of a miracle since, you know, ramen is street food! I grew up with it--they were like the Korean version of hot dogs or something. Came on a Sunday night without a reservation and ended up waiting about 40 minutes. There's a bar, however, where you can at least drink and even have appetizers. After eating at Momofuku Noodle Bar and Ramen Setagaya, I believe Ippudo wins hands down. Not only was its ramen the tastiest, but the menu is rife with a variety of choices for appetizers and entrees that won't lighten your wallet too much. I had the pork ramen classic and my special man friend had the spicy one. We also shared the special trio of appetizers, and they were crazy delicious. I remember that even a handful of salad put on your app boat was completely yummy. Wow! As for the atmosphere, it's fun. The cooks shout out when a ramen is up, and the waitresses trill in response. It's kind of like being in a really fancy food stand.

This was my first time having real ramen and I wasn't disappointed. My first visit was for a friend's birthday dinner here just a couple of weeks ago. We arrived on a Friday night between 6:30-7:30. Unfortunately, they don't take reservations and there were 8 people in our party so we had about an hour wait. A few of us decided to go just a couple of blocks down to grab a couple of drinks to pass that time. Ê We were seated in our own private area, which was good since if you're in a smaller party, you're usually grouped with other guests in several community tables. We ordered two orders of the hirata chicken wings and samurai ribs for appetizers. They were both quite delicious and I loved the sauce of the chicken wings. We also ordered a bottle of sweet sake for the table, which was pretty good considering I'm not a big fan of sake. I ordered the shiromaru hakata classic ramen. It was a great dish but I wished there was more of the pork. For dessert, we ordered 2 orders of the matcha brulee and one of the mascarpone cheese & ice cream..mm soo good. It was an overall great experience. I'd probably rate it more like a 3.5 to 4 and would come back again maybe at an earlier time to beat the rush for dinner or lunch here.

I know how I like my ramen and this was not it. I've been living in NYC for 12+ years and I didn't know 4th ave. existed. I was beginning to feel like a loser. I was googling this place's address on my phone and I was like "Where is 4th ave?". I tend to think out loud. (I don't mean to. I am really really trying to restrain that.) So, this nice lady walking by me goes (I didn't even ask. She just came up and offered.) "Are you looking for a place? There's no 4th Ave. in NYC. You must be new to New York. Where are you trying to go?" (Obviously this lady thinks I am a tourist. What gives off?? What do I say? Do I need to correct her? that I am not a tourist and I've spent almost half of my grade school years in NYC?) Instead I said, "Oh, I am trying to go to Ippudo, the Ramen place. It says 4th ave." She goes "Ah! Now that I think about it, there is 4th ave downtown. You can take a subway there. (and the rest of direction)." What a nice lady! That was an awesome experience. I should really start being nice to fellow New Yorkers instead of nudging them ever so slightly in subways to make more room for myself. uh hmm. So, I got to Ippudo and I realize I actually have been here before. I just didn't know that ave was 4th ave. There was a wait. So, my friend and Êwaited. I was hungry. Hunger is a good appetite. Therefore, food should be naturally good. (I was thinking...) We ordered a couple of appetizers; pork buns and ponzu. Then, ramen. ah... what a dissapointment. Only pork buns were decent enough. I didn't care for the ponzu or ramen at all. I was especially disappointed in their Ramen noodle quality. I like my ramen noodle to be a bit al dente and chewy. But, Ippudo ramen noodle texture was like Soba noodle. Soup was ok. But not amazing. Where's all this hype coming from? It's true maybe I don't know how authentic ramen should taste like. I just know how I like mine. I will just stick with Menkui Tei.

Great Ramen, but the wait was almost unacceptable. ÊIt's like Santa Ramen in San Mateo, CA. ÊJust too long sometimes. ÊIt's not God's gift to food. ÊRamen is ramen and (usually) can't be that much better than an average bowl from a small shop in Japan. The Hirata Buns were very good. ÊSweet and porky with a good amount of fat. The Kogashi Miso was to my liking. Overall, I will return one day, as long as I am ok eating lunch at 11 sharp.

I lived in Tokyo for two years and can tell anyone, without question, that this is the only ramen in NYC worthy of the name. They use fresh, delicious ingredients, have excellent broth and the noodles are always cooked perfectly. It is the only place where I take in the aroma and taste of the ramen and am reminded of eating ramen early in the morning in Roppongi after a raging night out drinking with friends. Not only do they have great ramen, but they have great appetizers as well. Their karage took me back to summers in yoyogi-koen buying karage from the little karts in the bike paths and walking through the park eating the juiciest, tastiest, most perfect little bites of fried chicken ever. The seasoning is perfect. It's not the best ramen I ever had, but it's the best ramen I have had in NYC. I have had multiple types of ramen in multiple ramen shops that people all rave about. I don't need to name them, but I do need to point out their inferior products. A friend of mine who is by no means the ramen lover I am went to another shop with me and was immediately offended that we weren't in Ippudo because of how lesser the quality of everything from the broth to the noodles to the garnishes were at this competing place. Go to Ippudo if you want solid ramen. Go elsewhere if you want to save a few dollars.

This place would have six stars if not for the long waits, which can be up to an hour and a half on the weekends. Seriously, I've gone at 4 pm on a Saturday and had to wait before. Still though, if you want the most delicious, rich amazing ramen, it's hard to beat Ippudo and its fabulous Akumaru Modern ramen and open faced pork buns. They also do an amazing job making you feel like you've stepped into another stylish universe-- from the Êway the waiters yell Japanese at you with enthusiasm when you leave to the amazing booths and also bamboo tree sprouting up in the middle of the restaurant. Every time I take an out of town guest here, they're always wowed. It's a moment when you know just why you live in a place as fabulous and diverse as New York.

ÊI loveeee ramen...and I wish this restraunt was in SF! Ê The pork buns were soooo gooodddd. ÊI've had peking duck buns several times, and let me tell you...they do not compare to Ippudo's pork buns. The ramen was delicious! ÊI forgot what my ramen was called, but it was SOOO good. ÊI also tried the fried chicken appetizer with wasabi sauce...also very good..but my favorite are the pork buns! The staff was super friendly and the service was definitley 5 stars...they re-filled my water without me asking, brought me new plates once mine were dirty and they greeted me with a happy smile everytime I asked for something. When I visit NY again, I am definitley coming back... BEWARE- Wait time is at least an hour! ÊI went to Ippudo on a Friday and Monday night and waited an hour!!!!! But it is worth it :) YUM

OMG. Hands down the best ramen place ever. LA has one of my favorite ramen house but I think this place stole my heart. I ordered the miso ramen and for some reason it was so sweet and creamy, just the way I like my miso soup. The ramen was not too soggy and they serve you a good portion. I will definitely come here again even tho the wait was long, but there's a reason why. Environment is friendly, well decor. I recommend people coming here for a first date, since you get the time to wait for food and get to know your new friend, plus you get to eat something amazing for a good price. why not right?

I came here because my wife is from Hakata and is a big fan of the tonkotsu ramen. ÊWhile we were in Japan, she's taken me to some of her favorites in Japan, and the ramen that I had over there was excellent. ÊWe both love ramen and we were excited to come to Ippudo NY. Ê The Ippudo NY is a great ramen shop. ÊThe tonkotsu soup here is better than any of the ramen shops that I have dined in Hakata. ÊThe thickness of the tonkotsu soup flavor is the thickest I have ever tasted, and rivals any good ramen shop in Japan. Ê I ordered the akamaru which is a ramen with a tonkotsu based soup with spice. ÊIt was very good, but not too spicy. ÊMy wife ordered the shiromaru, which is the akamaru without the spice. ÊShe is a native Hakata-ite, and avid ramen lover. ÊShe was very happy with the tonkotsu soup and told me that it may be the best tonkotsu soup she has ever had. ÊMy friend had the chicken ramen, which is ramen made with a light chicken soup base. ÊHe was drinking the day before, so he wanted something light to settle his stomach. ÊHe let me taste a little bit of the soup, and it was delicious, non-greasy, and light. Ê The only reason why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the wait. ÊI got there with my wife and friend, and they told us that there was a 2 hour wait. ÊI couldn't really understand that. ÊWith the business that they have, and the prices that they charge, they should open another shop or at least expand. ÊOther than the waiting factor, I was very impressed with the quality of food. ÊService is average/adequate.

After reading the reviews, I thought I would have to wait at least 30 mins just to get in, but luckily, eating at random times in the day has its' perks. First, there are at least 7-8 choices of ramen, so you can't go wrong. I forgot what I ordered, but I think it was the classic (maybe #3?). Anyways, I would have to say the ramen was good, not too much different than Santouka Ramen in LA. The portions are definitely larger (couldn't finish the entire bowl), but noodles and soup base are the same as Santouka. I would even say the soup is a little too salty for my taste, and I was tempted to dilute the soup with water (which I usually do at Santouka). But I resisted, partially because I didn't want to offend anyone at the restaurant. But what I enjoyed the most was the atmosphere of the restaurant. The communal seating made me instantly comfortable. Overall., ramen good, but the atmosphere is what I would come back for.

This may sound repetitive with all the other past reviews, ah but what the heck - this place is seriously phenomenal. Hands down, the best ramen in town - I like Ippudo even better than their competitor a few blocks away, Momofuku. You can never go wrong with the Akamaru Modern ramen noodles. Between the heavenly broth, rich pork meat, and the garlic that's combined in it....I must be dreaming. The pork bun appetizers are delicious and really hit the spot, but do seem a bit overpriced along with most other appetizers there. At Ippudo, the service and delivery are like no other. Just like in traditional and "genuinely Japanese" Japanese restaurants, you are greeted warmly by all the staff upon entering and leaving. The staff are friendly, patient, and extremely polite. The atmosphere is perfect - classy but unpretentious, with a pleasant injection of Japanese aesthetics and decor. I love the seating arrangements, which has an array of communal tables and group booth tables. The bar area is cool and trendy with decent drinks and great happy hour specials (two beers for the price of one), but does get crowded very quickly. I'd say the only downer about dining at Ippudo is, yep, you guessed it, the long waits. But that's where those delicious pork buns and Sapporo beers come in handy at the bar area.... Overall, Ippudo is an excellent choice to take your friends and share fun experiences in the Japanese culture and enjoy some fantastic, heart-warming ramen.

Hungry? Cold? What are you waiting for, head your way to Ippudo for some warm noodles! Hirabata buns (pork) + Kasane-Aji ramen (special) = Heaven Though I wasn't thoroughly impressed with the Tori Tatsuta Age, I think it's more the chicken that lacked the flavor not the flavoring itself. The special ramen was delicious, the mixture of chicken and pork base is just perfect. The ambiance is great as well - very lively with people shouting "onegai shimasu" every time someone from the front brings people in, etc. Tables are shared with others--the decor is very friendly. The matcha creme brulee + ice cream is to die for!! You'll lick your plate clean, fo' sure. So save some room for dessert!

Ippudo ramen was great. ÊI've had ramen that was just as good on the east coast, but this was well executed none the less. ÊHouse made noodles have the perfect texture and tooth, broth is savory, salty, and delicious. ÊRecommend the Ebi Wonton Ramen and the Aka Miso Ramen. The Pork Buns were spectacular... the bun was sweet, soft, and steamy, contrasted with the crisp lettuce, and crispy on the outside, tender on the inside cuts of pork.

Honestly, the wait time is what makes this a 4 star restaurant. It's a great place, the ramen is terrific, but come on. Ramen Setagaya is a great approximation but without the wait... but sometimes you need the best ramen in the city. I think Ippudo has it.... but only because I think the broth is the most important aspect. Others would say price is key, or the noodles, or the ingredients, or the quality.

Ippudo is one of the best ramen places in Manhattan but to me it's not worthwhile waiting for more than 30 min sometimes 1hour. ÊI always have AKAMARU and it's good but not quite as good as ramen in Japan. In addition, 15 dollar ramen is overpriced. I like their green tea mousse. The decoration is beautifully done and the sweetness is perfect! This time I tried Annintofu which was also good.

ÊIt wasn't too bad 'cause we walked around and by the time we came back, it was our turn. ÊOrdered the pork bun for starters. ÊIf you can eat pork then this is a a must-try! ÊIts roast pork with lettuce some Japanese mayo and spicy sauce in a soft bun. ÊSoooo Yummy. We also ordered one classic and one modern ramen. ÊDidn't order the extra side of pork belly as recommended 'cause the meat is a little though and easily gets stuck in the teeth. ÊI must say... best ramen I've had so far. ÊAfter trying this place, it's going to be hard going to any other ramen place. Ê We end the night with sweet tofu with slices of strawberry and kiwi on top. ÊIt was soft and creamy. ÊIt first there's a light taste of alochol but couldn't confirm if it really was. ÊAnyways, it wasn't too sweet which was great to my liking. ÊThey always seem to end the night with complimentary hot green tea. ÊPerfect finish. ÊBy the way, if you're going to try, they dont take reservations. ÊFirst come first serve, but worth the wait.

Seems like most people order the same thing. Pork bun appetizers are pretty tasty. For the entree, the "red bowl" is the one to get. I opted for the combo, which came with a bowl of rice and a little bit of eel on top. For dessert, had the green tea ice cream creme brulee, which was pretty good. Mediocre rating because of the price. OK for NY, but ramen shouldn't run me $16. And the 1+ hour wait for lunch was slightly ridiculous (no reservations). Waitress was great, though. Patient and gave good recommendations.

Pro's: The atmosphere rocks, as soon as you come in a bunch of guys cheer/welcome you in. Definitely awesome right there, I tried the Tonkotsu(I know I screwed up the spelling probably) Ramen. It was VERY good. Also the big slices of pork that come with the ramen were very good. Con's: I felt a little jipped, the pork stuffed buns were raved about big time here. But in all honesty compared to the Tashubaos in flushing they really weren't that great. They were just ok. Also I ordered some of the "pork belly", it arrived and all it was was a big blob of fat...

Best Ramen House in the East Coast, yes that is real talk. Got the whole nine yards when I went here for lunch. I wasn't expecting much since I never heard of this place. Upon walking in we had to wait a couple of minutes, I wasn't impressed by the bar entrance but I wasn't really paying attention. When we where seated our party was greeted enthusiastically, which was a nice surprise pick me up since we where a little tired of walking at High Line Park. Anyways, the dcor was interesting to say the least. We sat at the booth where the wall of, I would easily guess as Japanese characters, sculptures. My boy enjoyed that but let's get it on with the food porn. I ordered the Akamaru modern which was recommended to me, and I will recommend it to you as well. The broth was very hearty and smooth, the noodles didn't feel heavy and thick like processed noodles do because you know why? Try taking a quick trip to the restroom down stairs, before the restroom doors you will see a long narrow window and behind that you will see why their noodles are VERY FRESH. This dish was absolute top notch but what about the appetizers? Well you should get the buns Yada Yada Pork, Chicken, Yeah Yeah their good. But if you want something healthy, tasty, and possibly spicy hit up the Pepper appetizer with salt and lemon. Surprisingly I didn't get any that where spicy and was told by the waitress "You'll be luck to get one" which made me smile. It was quite an experience, the staff where very attentive without being overbearing and the food was excellent. We all left full and invigorated, Ippudo I'll be back (Terminator stezz).

Some of the best overpriced ramen noodles ever! There's a science to excellent noodle soup and that is... ADD everything; withhold nothing. People who stay true to their culinary craft understand this. What sets Ippudo apart from other ramen houses is the fact that their noodles are made in-house and you can have it chewier or overcooked, whichever way you like. Then add the murky, savory broth with some red chili, green onions, shitake mushroom and my fave: pork belly. Wish they weren't so moderate and just overflow my bowl with pork fat. I would die a happy woman. Also, the seared tuna-look-alike on a bed of raw onions and red pepper tossed in vinegar with a garnishing of cilantro and thinly-sliced lemon (which I paired with the fish and ate whole) was exactly how raw fish should be served! It was pure quality without the sizable quantity-- which may or may not be cool depending on your hunger status. Still, robust flavor RULES... and a drop-dead gorgeous waiter didn't hurt either.

Never had Ramen like this before. The ambiance and food was great. I had the akamaru modern ramen, which was really yummy. I got it with the pork loin instead of the pork belly. I'd probably get the pork belly with it instead next time. I had the pork bun appetizer which was really tasty. Not the best pork belly I've had but pretty close to it.

Êanother time, my friend got there first also around 5 and we only waited around 10-15 minutes maybe? the samuari pork chops are very tasty and almost fall off the bone. the pork buns are delicious, but not necessarily amazing.while the noodles are yummy, its really the broths that are very savory and is worth sitting there sipping one spoonful at a time.

I've lately had this huge penchant for ramen, I blame it on Hide-chan for having me jump on the boat. ÊSo, needless to say, ÊI had to try Ippudo, the proclaimed best ramen in all of NY. Ê I still think whomever gave it this title has not tried other spots. Ê The atmosphere was definitely amazing. ÊThey sat us right at the counter as there were no other spots and in all honesty, I think we had the most interesting and entertaining spots, getting to watch the chefs prepare our meal. ÊThe vibe was exciting with the waiters making you feel like royalty as they announced your entrance with all the staff shouting something akin to "Irrashaimase (welcome in japanese)". ÊDefinitely a fun place for groups. Now...onto the main event, the food! ÊWe had the pork buns and I was pleasantly surprised as I was afraid the spice might be too much but it really was just perfect. ÊI still believe, though, that Momofuku is the winner in that round as the pork in the buns literally melts in your mouth. ÊI also ordered a plum wine that just had far too much ice in it. ÊI usually like mine straight (will have to remember to specify that again if I go) And then there was the Ramen... ÊThe broth was perfect, rich but not oily, definitely something I loved slurping up. ÊThe pork though? ÊVery bland, not full of flavor. ÊAt my friend's advice, I ordered the extra Chashu pork and my egg as I do love me a good boiled egg! ÊOne thing that just almost ruined the ramen for me were the noodles. ÊThey were far too thin and just way too much. ÊI felt like a box of angel hair pasta fell into my bowl! ÊThat's the only thing preventing me from agreeing with everyone else and calling it the best bowl of ramen in NYC. ÊFor $15 a bowl I really do expect perfection and that wasn't what I got. ÊMaybe if it were $8 I'd lean a bit more but not a place I'm planning to make frequent trips to. ÊAlso the wait wasn't bad as I went earlier in the day and put my name down for 10...to their word they seated us at almost exactly 10, nice service! ÊThe service was exceptional with the waiters stopping every time I called them over (not telling me to wait--very annoying when a waiter does that) and they would occasionally check up to see if Êwe were fine I'm still going with my hide-chan and terakawa which are still my two faves in NYC.

Make sure you have a reservation! We showed up at Ippudo at 9:30pm on a Sunday. It was packed! The hostess brushed us off when we asked for a table for two. Scoffed at us actually. We were bummed because we walked a few miles in the rain to get here. It was still raining so we decided to have a beer at the small beer/sake bar in the front. While we were drinking our beers, the lead hostess came over and asked if we wanted a table because she would squeeze us in. Nice! We had the Samarai Ribs, sweet, sticky, spicy. Shiromaru Hakata ramen which was awesome. The broth was rich and savory with a nice porkiness. The noodles were light and had a great texture to it. This is a good reason to make the trek out to Ippudo, walking in the rain, deal with a rude hostess...all worth it.

I'm a noodle person. I can eat pho, ramen, udon, wonton noodle any time of day. ÊAfter seeing the million reviews here about its ramen and hearing many friends recommend this restaurant as a place to eat in NY, my boyfriend and I came here on a Friday night during our first trip to NY. We got there around 7. We were really confused for the longest time on where the actual door was...I won't get into the story because we are probably the biggest dorks standing on the street poking at a wall and I don't even want to think we were probably the first ones to think so...ANYWAY we get inside, put our name down, and they say its about an hour and a half wait or something like that. That long of a wait would usually put me off but we knew we had to stay and try the ramen. We stood at the bar, drank some sapporo and ate two of their pork buns which were BOMB. They were the best pork buns I've ever had. After chilling there for what seemed only like 30-40 minutes, they call us to be seated! We are seated at the counter facing the kitchen and the chefs. I thought this was really fun and exciting to see how they work and to see all the interesting dishes be prepared. The interior of the restaurant was really cute, unique, and approved for dates. The menu is not too big, they have a lot of appetizers but only about a handful of ramens. We both ordered the Karaka Kogashi Miso Ramen. We heard the bartender recommend it to someone heh. It came out very fast and it did NOT disappoint. The broth was very dark, fatty (which is GOOD), and had small chunks of pork in the broth which gave it so much yummy texture. The broth was just so amazing. The noodles were good and the pork was tender and flavorful. The egg was perfectly cooked/boiled, where the yolk was in between runny and solid. I dont' know what else to say other than this was THE best ramen I've ever had in my life. I'm so sad I don't live in New York. I'd be at Ippudo once a week at least. Oh and for dessert we had their amazingly well crafted matcha creme brulee. Order this unique dessert to finish off your Ippudo experience!

The constant yelling or "greeting" of the waiters were welcoming at first, but also kind of intimidating. But yeah. The wait for the famous ramen was ridiculous. It took so long for the noodles to be served, but totally worth the wait. But it took a while waiting for the bill too.

1.5 hour wait for five people. I had the ramen listed at the top -- forgot the name. The noodle soup is impressive, while the service is so-so. Tried their crepe cake as the dessert and I liked it.

Went here for the 1st time, the decor is definetely trendy and modern. Great ramen, a little pricey but really good. The pork buns were delicious, but 2 little ones for $8 = :(. A little crazy that they don't take reservation and almost always a 2 hour wait for a table but being in the village, theres so much to do while you wait. Wouldn't go there if I was extremely hungry and can not wait. I will definetely be returning.

a michelin rated ramen place? Its a must to give this place a try! Came here on a saturday night at 6pm with a whooping 2 hour wait...and it was definitely worth the wait! Started off with the famous Hirata Buns and it was so good that i couldnt stop smiling. MMMMM. I had the Karaka Kogashi Miso Ramen Êwhich comes with a hint of hot spice in the soup and it was delicious! I highly recommend this place just make sure you come here early.

As a stuck up So Cal girl, I was skeptical that NYC could offer something that could be spoken in the same sentence as Daikokuya and Hakata ramen. ÊBoy was I in for a surprise. ÊAs most have already noted, the wait here isn't preferable (especially when it's freezing outside), so what the boyfriend and I did was go around the corner to Angel's Share (will review there as well...awesome place), threw back a few drinks and headed back where we waited less than 5 minutes. ÊFor the appetizer we got the chicken karaage and it was AMAZING with the sweet and sour sauce. ÊWe also had the sake special that evening which was recommended by the waitress. ÊWe both had the Hakata style ramen and if licking the bowl was socially acceptable, I'm sure we'd be do it. ÊI can't say that I think it's got a huge leg up on my Gardena go-to favorite, but I would certainly say that it's better than Daikokuya. ÊWould have liked to see Ippudo have something like gyoza, but for what's it's worth, it only takes up more space in your stomach.

I came here during lunch hours and ordered the Shiromaru Hakata Classic Set with the Roast Pork Over Rice. This was the BEST ramen I've ever had in my life and the rice side dish just made it the perfect meal. For ramen, it is kind of pricey, but well worth it. There's normally a wait, but having come around 3:00, it wasn't too bad. I wouldn't come all the time since there's always a wait, but trying the ramen should be on everyone's bucketlist in my opinion.

I heart Ippudo! ÊThe first time I came here and bit into a pork bun, I literally gasped with delight and quickly polished it off. ÊThe flavors in it were amazing!! ÊAnd the ramen was so delicious and comforting. ÊI have to admit that I'm not that crazy about the noodles themselves but the broth....THE BROTH. ÊThey could put that in a thermos and I'd drink it all day every day. ÊMmm. I usually get the Modern or the special and I've never been disappointed. I've taken my sister and brother-in-law here and they both said it was the best ramen they've ever had. ÊThey also liked the pork buns, but not as much as me and they resisted ordering more even with my not so gentle prodding. ÊI took my mom here as well who has spent some time in Japan and she loved it as well. ÊAnd while she loved the noodles her favorite was actually the tofu dessert, saying it was perfectly light, smooth, cleansing and unexpected. ÊI couldn't agree more. Ê If I still lived in NY I'd hesitate to review this place because the wait already could get a bit long (good thing I'm not adverse to sipping a Sapporo at the bar), but now that I'm no longer in the area I feel free to give this place the glowing review it deserves. ÊAlso, it's surprisingly totally kid friendly. ÊI've seen lots of families here, and I've also gone with friends who had a baby and it was very easy and low key. ÊMan I want some pork buns and ramen right now.

Pork buns were DELIGHTFUL. They come in one of those sweet fluffy pockets that Beijing Duck sometimes comes in and had somewhat of the same flavor profile, in a sweet and savory medley of crispy animal skin and fat. Akamaru Modern came in a steaming bowl of rich, smooth broth. I would recommend adding some greens as a topping, actually, just so the tonkotsu doesn't give you too much of a food coma. Pieces of braised pork were lusciously fatty. They give you a cup of tea at the end to cleanse your palate, which was well appreciated. I would eat here everyday if I could. I suppose ramen, as classic as it is, is a nascent food trend in the States. But in which case, WHY ISN'T THERE SOMETHING SIMILAR IN CHICAGO? I suppose I'll be even moreso on the hunt from now on to find a decent ramen place back home.

the ramen is the best ramen i have ever had. Êwe had a seating snafu where they somehow separated our party of 4 to 2 separate tables, but one of our dinner companions said that this ramen place was so good that we should just ignore this snafu and just enjoy the food then talk about it afterward. we started off with some wings, had the ramen then decided (even though we were deathly full) to try the buns also. hirata chicken wings - the wings were flavorful from beginning to end. Êi had complained about other locations that claim to have the best wings ever, the biggest complaint was that after the first bite (which is very flavorful) let's you down for the rest of the chicken. Êthen you have others that overly cooked and the meat is dry. Êthis wasn't the case, the hirata sauce was very tasty and the meat was moist inside and still had flavor. Êi even ate the greens on the plate covered in the hirata sauce. akamaru modern - this was not the traditional japanese ramen that i am familiar with trying at all those other ramen restaurants. Êthe noodles seem thinner, which makes it easier to eat. Êthe broth though, i took one bite and my eyes grew. Êit was flavorful and thick, yet not chalky. they had a special red garlic miso type sauce that accented the noodles and made the broth unbelievable. Êi also got the extra soft boiled egg and pork belly. Êmaking a soft boiled egg is not as easy as it seems, at least not a good one. Êthe egg white was soft while the egg yolk was still runny but semi solid where the yellow didn't run all over the ramen. Êpork belly is...well, its pork belly so delicious, flavorful and great texture. hirata buns - this either comes as chicken or pork. Êi had it with the pork belly and the buns were thin, soaked up all the hirata sauce and had great texture. the ramen was 5 stars, but with this wretched seating snafu i had to regrettably take away a star.

If you are from Japan no ramen outside of the country is going to be good. I'm a New yorker but am married to a Japanese, born and raised. My mother is also a chef. That being said. although the decor of Ippudo is nice, although a bit busy. The ramen is simply okay, and any Native Japanese will tell you the same thing. Its way over priced and a bit over whelming inside. It might just be me, but i prefer going to Japanese restaurants with Japanese staff. Ippudo is nice to go to once, but not Êa place to go if you want really great ramen.

Overall 4 or 4.5 stars; definitely a solid restaurant - not life-changing like some people make it seem, but a GREAT choice if you're craving ramen or some adventurous asian food. FOOD Kaisen Bakuretsu Tofu ($13) (Stewed spicy tofu with scallops, shrimp, squid, and minced pork, crunchy noodles served in a sizzling stone pot) - Man this is good; very hearty and delicious stew; chock full of flavor and components; not too spicy but bold flavor; shrimp is not the best quality (just medium sized, almost in spiral), and there was too much pork (almost ground up; def the biggest presence in stew), not as much scallops (barely) or squid (just a few nuggets) as i had wanted, but a good amount of shrimp; crispy noodles were small 1" pieces that were throughout and gave a great texture; appetizer size (small stone pot); 4.5 of 5 stars Akamaru Modern Ramen ($15) (the original "Tonkotsu" noodle soup topped with Ippudo's secret "Umami Dama" miso paste, pork chashu, cabbage, kikurage, scallions, and fragrant garlic oil) (PLUS $2 to add the "Nitamago" (boiled egg)) - Delicious! Main flavor is the miso, but it's much more complex with a bigger punch; not at all spicy (somehow I thought all ramen was supposed to be); not overly salty (yay!), not as many chunks (e.g., just "stuff") inside the ramen as expected; noodles were thin and cooked perfectly al dente; egg perfectly cooked so mushy but not over or undercooked; pork tender and tasty (only 2 3" strips); portions good for the hungry person; 4 of 5 stars (would liked more "stuff" in the ramen; also didn't really taste the garlic) Matcha brulee dessert ($8) - green tea flavored creme brulee with a dollop of green tea ice cream and a tiny sliver of strawberry; overall really really good and different - totally tastes like it sounds; perfect balance of green tea bitter flavor and the sweet and thick creme; nice hardened shell on top, but ice cream shouldn't be on top of it, makes it too messy and the below it becomes mushy; top wasn't as super crispy as i would have liked; solid 4.5 of 5 stars for taste, but w the weirdness of the ice cream dollop on top, maybe 4 overall. Didn't get charged for hot green tea! ATMOSPHERE Dark and trendy; great energy to the place (def not at all a romantic restaurant or a place for an intimate convo, but def a fun date or good place to have dinner w a few friends); a lot of table-sharing - essentially 10 large tables (ranging from 6 to 20 seat) and one row of bar seats; lots of spirited yelling in Japanese from the staff (a third of whom are not Japanese); kitchen is visible from tables (everyone looks quite happy). Definitely not a typical Japanese place; tries almost to be like a nightclub scene (in a good way); has rocker chick music on in the dining room The wait for one person at 5:30 PM on a Saturday was 10-15 mins but there was already a giant wait at least 20 ppl deep for larger parties Food came out really quickly and was piping hot Didn't feel pressure to leave/wasn't forced out, even though there were tons of ppl waiting. SERVICE Spectacular service; water glass was never empty; everyone worked as a team and checked in on me; never had to wait to ask for anything; incredibly attentive and efficient. Definitely will come again!

Yes, it's pricey for ramen. Yes, there's usually a wait. YES, it's delicious! The decor is cool. Sitting at the bar is fun, watching the guys plate appetizers. I usually order the Akamaru (plus egg), which is a bit rich but so tasty. The serving size is perfect for me, a girl with a healthy appetite. Are the portions the largest? No. But do you really need that much food? Probably not. I'm not the ramen expert but I love coming here. If you don't mind eating alone, waiting is never a problem. Yummy yummy, Ippudo in my tummy.

Way too crowded even on a Wednesday night, but after an hour and a half wait.... damn good ramen. Also to be noted... although my friend and I sat down and ordered first, 2 other couples received their appetizers AND ramen before we even got our appetizers. My friend felt that there was very clear racial preference (asians before non-asians). I generally doubt these theories,... but it seemed we were less prioritized than others for some reason or another. The pork buns were fantastic as well as the modern ramen.

I was surprised last year when I first heard that Ippudo, one of my regular go-to ramen places in Kichijoji (Tokyo), was coming to New York. I was even more surprised when I ran into one of the waiters who I knew from the Kichijoji shop at the New York shop and when he told me he was now the manager of the New York Ippudo. We were like, oh my god, what are you doing here!? Good for him! Anyway, the ramen tastes the same as the one I usually have in Kichijoji, but it costs twice the price. So yay that you've come to NYC, but boo for the price. The chashu don was tasty as well. All in all, it satisfied my ramen craving.

This is my first time eating authentic Japanese ramen. I went on a Saturday and got there around 12ish and there was no wait. My friend and I were seated immediately. I ordered the pork buns and a beer for appetizer. The buns were good with a hint of spicy mayo. My friend ordered the chicken wings which were okay. I went with the akamaru modern and my friend went with the kogashi miso. The tonkotsu broth of the akamaru was amazing, it had great depth of pork flavor and a bit of garlic from the oil. It had thin noodles that was nice and al dente. The char sui was nice and tender and fell apart as I put in my mouth. I also tried my friend's kogashi ramen and the miso broth was well balanced and the noodles were a bit thicker. Now I have to try other ramen places in NY the next time I come up to visit my friend.

We had an hour wait at Ippudo... on a Wednesday night before 8 PM. No problem - we just went to a nearby bar for a drink, as the waiting room at the restaurant was way crowded and somewhat unpleasant. It's worth the wait, though -- the food at Ippudo is outstanding. My boyfriend's a big fan of the pork rolls, and the ramen can't be beat. My one quibble causing me to remove 1 star -- for no apparent reason, they do not let you take leftovers home with you. Those soups are damn big -- can't we take the deliciousness with us?? Is there a good explanation for this?

Curious to test the hype, I went to Ippudo for lunch last Saturday. Party of 2, we arrived at about 1pm and after a 10 minute wait were seated at a communal table. Food was good, but my bowl of ramen, the classic, had only one piece of meat in it. If I'm paying $14 for a bowl of broth with some noodles, I expect at least a generous portion of meat, one little piece, inexcusable. While the broth was deep, rich and satisfying, it does not warrant venturing across town and waiting hours in line for. Service was excellent, our waiter was nice, as well as the rest of the staff there. I guess you're paying for the name and the decor at this place.

House made hot sauce...$2 Pork buns...$8 Spare Ribs...$10 Bowl of Akamaru Modern ramen with pork belly...$18 Not being able to take home what you paid for...priceless My first trip, not knowing the reputation of Ippudo, I was unhappy with the wait time and sticker shocked by the price. For the second time, I went in with a much more prepared mindset. Spare ribs and the pork belly was definitely the highlight (therefore 2.5 stars). The pork buns could have done without the mayo. $2 for "housemade" hot sauce (we easily overlooked it), but I've had the same exact hot sauce all over Chinatown. And guess what?...you CAN'T take home what you can't finish. I understand that doggy bag is generally found in Europe, but we're not in Europe! Thanks for the lame excuses, Ippudo. So for $18 ramen, I sat there, unbuttoned my pants and finished my ramen. Thanks, Ippudo! If there's a next time, I'm bringing my own tuppeware and hot sauce.

Akamaru Modern w/ pork belly.

First off, I love this place. I went last night when it was well below freezing out and the place was still packed (2 hour wait for a party of 3) I think this is definitely the best flavored ramen soup in the city, the broth is definitely the richest. Beats out Menchanko Tei, Setagaya, Minca, not to mention a host of other me too places. It's obvious there is already a lot of support for Ippudo so I won't spend the whole time singing it's praises. ÊInstead wanted to take a moment to point out a few of my criticisms: 1) I think the broth is a little too salty, I feel like I have to drink half a days supply of water afterwards to keep from feeling thirsty after Ippudo 2) I think the roast pork buns are starting to decline in their quality and are becoming overrated. ÊThe flavor is not as special, and the ones I had last night were a little too sweet 3) I think the consistency of the new noodles is a little on the mushy side. I actually prefer the noodles at Setagaya because they are more... limber? is that the term? springier? Êmore noodly? 4) The wait is getting ridiculously long, but that is not a negative against Ippudo, only for me Notwithstanding these nitpicks, I still think every one of Ippudo's ramen selections beats any other place in the city in terms of taste. Bonus: Their bar makes the wait much more bearable. My favorite drinks are the yamazaki whiskey with plain water and the yuzu rock.

We finally made it to Ippudo last night 1/10/10 after several failed attempts. I was on vacation for 2 weeks and every time we attempted to hit this Ramen hot spot we were greeted with a 1.5 hr wait time. We assumed that a Sunday night at 5:30 would be be a safe bet, but once again there was the inevitable 1.5 hr wait time. We decided since it was early we would settle in and enjoy a bottle of Sake and wait the wait to see what this Ramen was all about. The bartender was sweet and we chatted with some other guests that were also waiting. Everybody seemed to be having a similar experience with the hostess. She was very rude and didn't seem to care that you were willing to wait the extensively long wait time. After about 45mins I went back up to check on our status and the hostess responded with " It's only been 45mins, you still have many people ahead of you, it will be a while!" ÊThis was not very encouraging and I was hoping for a " Thanks for your patience, we will be with you as soon as we can". After about an hour and a half our table was finally ready. We were very hungry and ordered the Pork Bun appetizer for 2 which was very yummy and had a great spongy bun with delectable pork. Next we both got a Ramen. I had the "Modern" Ramen( a broth consisting of Miso and their signature broth) and my girlfriend had the Special Ramen which was a (creamy chicken broth with their house broth) The Noodles were very thin and al dente but very fresh and flavorful. There Êwas not enough of them though. I have been to many many Ramen spots and I have never ever needed more noodles. At Ippudo it's almost as if they know they are not giving you enough noodles and put a note in the menu saying you can buy more noodles for $2 if you still have broth at the end of your meal. Overall the Ramen is quite good and has very complex flavorful broth and they have some creative app choices. The downside is the wait is far too long and it is too pricey for a Japanese street food. I have been all over Japan and have never paid $60 plus for 2 bowls of soup and an appetizer. If you have the extra cash and a surplus of time check it out. I however will be at Rai Rai Ken for my next Ramen meal on 10th, where I can eat a hearty bowl of Miso Ramen wait 20 min or less and still walkaway with some change in my pocket:)

Most of the complaints I see about Ippudo relate to the wait and the service, and most of them are probably valid. I made a point to go at 3pm on a Sunday in the hopes that it wouldn't be busy... There was still a 35 minute wait, which is actually on the brief side considering when I tried to go on a Tuesday night the wait was about 90 minutes. After waiting at the bar we were seated, and our waiter was very friendly as well as timely. No complaints about the service here! And the food was absolutely killer. We had the pork buns and I had Ebi Wonton Ramen - both absolutely delicious. I'd definitely go back, but I think the trick here is to aim for an off-peak time.

Simply. ÊThe. ÊBest. Decor: trendy, tight accomodations Wait: Interminably long Price: way too high Food: but the noodles are totally worth it! ÊJust simply the best. ÊI've had the Shiromaru Classic, Akamaru Modern and the Kogashi Miso. ÊAll have been amazing, though the Akamaru is my favorite. ÊThe only critique I would say is that there are not a lot of toppings with the noodles, and you get a lot more noodles by ordering the Kae Daema (extra noodles) than you do initially getting the bowl. ÊBut just oh so good, nothing comes close as far as broth, noodles, and taste. ÊPerfection.

There is a vegetarian ramen if you request it. Pescatarians will want to go this route too with fishcakes added. It was surprisingly good but heavy on wasabi so be prepared. My eyes started tearing from wasabi fumes even before tasting it. Ê The wait may be very, very long so don't be starving when you get there. For me, the 50 minute wait was worth it.

Came here for a friend's birthday on a Tuesday night, and there was still like an hour and a half wait. I didn't mind too much, since it was beautiful outside, but if it had been cold out...that would've sucked. Anyway, I had never had good ramen before, so this was all new to me. We got some appetizers - the baby octopus special (which was ok), some chicken and pork buns (delicious!) and the fried shrimp in mayo sauce special...which was absolutely to die for! i could've just eaten the pork buns and the fried shrimp all night, and been totally happy. I got the ramen with shrimp dumplings, which was pretty damn good. Overall it's a fun place, with good food, but I'm not a fan of places where you know you will always have to wait an hour+. Also, just reading other reviews and learning about the MSG doesn't help.

Wow, great soup and the pork buns were ridiculously good. ÊAlso ordered the baby octopus with wasabi, chicken wings and fried peppers (very similar to the Spanish pimientos de padron) for apps and everything was really outstanding. The Amareku (sp?) Modern ramen with the recommended addition of pork belly was delicious and surprisingly filling. Be prepared to wait (we waited about 30 minutes but when we were being seated new comers were being asked to wait 2 hours) but is definitely worth it.

Ippudo: delectable Japanese comfort food; RIDICULOUS wait. ÊPerhaps it's the spectacle of being the only location outside of Japan, or maybe New Yorkers just really, really love Ramen, but this was one of the longest waits I have ever endured for a table. ÊHaving yelped this place before going helped prepare me for the wait, but it didn't stop my jaw from dropping *just a little* when the hostess told me it would be an hour and a half to two hours for a table on a tuesday night. ÊIt was my birthday, though, and we were going to eat ramen, damnit! ÊLuckily for us, one of the parties ahead of us skipped out and we ended up being seated a mite earlier than expected, but our wait was still well over an hour. Now that I have THAT off my chest, let's move on to more positive territory. ÊThe staff at Ippudo is fantastic. ÊThey're all enthusiastic, friendly, and attentive. ÊI cannot recall being in a restaurant where I am greeted by every server as I enter and exit the establishment. ÊPut-on or not, it was appreciated and enjoyed. Thankfully, the food was also worth the wait. ÊThe pork and chicken buns were soft, salty, and tender, and the fried shrimp with mayo sauce was quite possibly the tastiest morsel of deep fried sea food I have ever ingested. ÊWe each tried a different ramen bowl as our main course, and everyone was practically licking the bottoms of their bowls at meal's end. ÊMine was a spicy pork ramen, and was everything I conjured in my mind while waiting for it to hit the table. Ippudo is the kind of place you can't visit all the time. ÊThe wait times alone are enough to turn anyone off, and the cost is fairly steep for what amounts to a fancy bowl of broth and noodles. ÊHowever, my experience was a good one. ÊI left feeling full and well treated. ÊIn a perfect world, without wait times, I'd go back to Ippudo in a heartbeat.

We had their chicken buns as an appetizer, and it was what I had expected it to be like.... good but way overpriced for what it is. I think you can get these at an asian grocery store in the freezer's section. Of course, they wouldn't be as fresh as the ones they served here, but still.... 4 pieces (2 full buns cut in halves) of steamed dough/bun with a peice of lettuce and chicken for 8-9$ is quite ridiculous. That being said, since I have never had Japanese ramen before, the Japanese ramen I had here was pretty unique and delicious. I like the creamy broth and the super tender, juicy slices of pork. I think I had the classic one. It was WAY TOO SALTY (and this was a consensus among 3 people) and I couldn't finish the soup, but I still liked it enough. Another friend had the one that is right below the classic ramen on the menu, and it had a completely different taste to it. It wasn't salty at all and tasted delicious as well. I liked mine better because of its slight creaminess but it would have been incredible if it weren't so salty~ Yet another friend had the ramen with miso broth, and that one was good as well. He was hesitant because he doesn't like pork, but he said the pork in it was good and decided that the pork here is an exception to the pork he doesn't really like. :) You can't make RSVPs here (there might be exceptions). We had to wait about 1.5 hours, but there was a starbucks nearby, and we just chatted our time away~ I love how the waiters there speak Japanese and very loudly too. It makes the experience more exciting and perhaps authentic. It was a really different experience and environment than any Japanese restaurant I have been to; it's definitely worth a visit! I would give it 4.5 stars if I could. I don't know the name of the sake I got, but our waiter described it as "crisp and dry". It was the most amazing sake I have ever tasted!! It had a subtle flowery or fruity taste- I just couldn't grasp it, but it kept me wanting more. hehe

Fantastic ramen. Went here for the first time tonight and didn't have to wait for more than 5 minutes to get seated (albeit at the bar facing the kitchen). Which actually I prefer over being at a communal table since you get to see all of the action up close and personal! Really nice of the hostess to pull out and push in the chair for me. Delightful service, attentive yet not annoying. Love the cheering and welcoming of customers. Pretty intense. Ordered the Akamaru Modern ramen and it was an absolute delight to polish off. Slightly on the salty side, but superb otherwise. I would definitely return soon.

Do you have an hour or two to spare? Do you have money to burn on a bowl of ramen that will make you think twice about making instant ramen? Then go to ippudo!! It was a really long wait on a Tuesday night. Very cute decor, dimmed lighting, interesting modern designed seating was very cool. A little over an hour we were seated and ordering the akhimaru modern.. Pork belly was so soft and chewy. My sister tried the kana something.. The spicy one. It was also delicious!! Broth is very hearty and tasty. Noodles were perfectly cooked and chewy. Yum! If you've never tried non-instant ramen, don't go anywhere else.

Food: ÊIppudo serves up a delicious bowl of ramen. ÊThey serve up a number of varieties of soup (a basic soup, salt flavor, miso flavor etc.) combined with various toppings (pork chashu, poached egg, ginger etc.) and everything just works together. The soup is flavorful, the entire dish looks and smells great, but most importantly, the noodle itself is fantastic -- most people think of ramen as the dried packaged stuff, but real ramen is thinner the package stuff with great slightly elastic (in the best way, not chewy, but al dente-ish) texture. You have the option to buy some extra toppings for $2-$4, and you can also order additional noodles for $2. ÊThe extra toppings are probably unnecessary because there is lots of flavor in the basic combinations, but the noodles may be necessary if you're feeling particularly hungry. Ê I don't bother with the appetizers or the dessert (because the ramen is filling enough) and because ramen is the obvious star. Price: Ê$13-$14 for a bowl of ramen. ÊIf you're particularly hungry, pay $2 to get extra noodles. ÊYou can definitely get out of here for $20 (tax and tip included) and feel completely satisfied. Service: ÊThe wait is notoriously long if you come at around 1pm, and you can expect to wait over an hour. ÊCome here for an earlier brunch (11:30am) or for an early dinner (5:30pm) and you will be seated in about 15 minutes. Ambience: ÊThis place is loud. ÊThe servers yell all the time, so you will find your conversations cut short by bursts of Japanese. ÊIt is louder or quieter depending on where you sit, but since you can't control where you sit, just be ready for some noise. ÊIf you have a group of 4 or more, you may get a booth away from the kitchen which is more comfortable. ÊIf you have just 2 or 3, you may be seated at a bar, or share a large round table, both of which are closer to the kitchen and louder.

I have never had ramen like this before! A friend of mine and I came by Ippudo on a Monday night around 8:30 and there was still about a 45 minute wait which speaks to the quality of this place. It's not bad because Êthere is cool stuff nearby so we grabbed a drink and then came back over. We each ordered the Akamaru Modern with a soft boiled egg so we were each out of there for $20. Wow this stuff was on point! I have no idea how they make the soup taste so good but they are doing something right. It is the perfect mix of color, taste, textures, and flavor which come together to make a delightful meal. The pork belly is ridiculously good and they are pretty generous with their serving of it. Make sure you are adept with chop sticks or otherwise make sure you ask for a fork to eat this dish properly. Decor is pretty modern and 'trendy.' Service was friendly and attentive. ÊIf you like japanese or particularly ramen dishes, this place is a MUST in NYC.

This place deserves all the rave reviews. Every time I pass it, at any time of day, the place is packed with people waiting to taste something like ecstasy. All of their ramen have excellent broth and complementary noodle consistency. This place takes 2 or more days to make their broth. Now that broth is gettin' some lovin'. But if you must pick one, the Akamaru Modern is the best. it is definitely the best ramen I have ever had. To tell you how good it is, my friend could not even pick up her chopsticks to eat the ramen because it was so frickin' good. She was making orgasmic sounds for 10 minutes before she actually calmed down and started eating after her first slurp. and while you're at it, eat the pork buns! they taste like they were made from a small shack in Japan. The buns and even the pork melt in your mouth!!

This is my favorite ramen spot. I'm torn between giving it a 4 (only because the wait is ridiculous and they don't take reservations, sometimes the wait can be 1 and a half to 2 hours.) I've tried ramen from different places, this is my favorite/go to place for ramen if I can stand the wait. There's not much more to add other than the other reviewers, the pork buns were good, the ramen is delicious, if the portions are too small as some other reviewers complained, you can add on more noodles as long as you do not finish your broth for $2 (although I was low on broth a few time and was never denied my add-on noodles as it says on the menu.) For those that complain about price, my take on this is, it's Manhattan, and it's one of the best if not the best ramen joints there, so you pay for what you get. I hear the trick is if you get in at 5PM when they reopen for service there is no wait, also if you come around half an hour before they close there is no wait (I've never done 5PM, but I have done around 10:30)

Delicious ramen (though it seems to go without saying). I found the waitstaff very friendly, helpful, but (in chorus) a bit too loud.

Have eaten here multiple times once I figured out the best times to go. Weekdays at lunch, or when they first open on the weekends. Other than that, the wait will be 1-2 hours. The ramen is worth it. Of the appetizers, I like the pork buns and the chicken wings. The shishito peppers used to be great but they cut down on the portion and I don't think it's worth the price. The decor is pretty modern and there are communal tables along with private tables. Service is good and the waitstaff shout at you in Japanese as you are seated and as you leave. My favorite ramen place in NYC.

Okay, so I guess my rating is based mostly on the fact that I'm just not crazy about ramen. Don't get me wrong, what I ordered - the Tori Ramen - was tasty, but at the end of the day, I just wasn't blown away or wowed by what I ate. It was a bowl of noodles - no more, no less. The pork loin chashu that came with the ramen was a bit skimpy, too, especially when an order costs $14, which is simply way too much for a bowl of ramen, two slices of roast pork, and a handful of vegetables. Factor in the fact that there was a 45 minute wait for a table at 1:30 on a random weekday afternoon, and I can't say I am itching to make a return visit to Ippudo.

despite the 1-3 hour waits i've had to endure, i'll still keep coming back for more. it's always a visitor 'must' as well. that broth! so fragrant, rich and silky smooth. the garlic! the straight, firm noodles! even tho i've had better chashu and soft boiled eggs at other ramen spots (santouka and setagaya), the soup gets me every time. rarely do i leave more than a spoonful in my bowl of akamaru modern. i do have to say that the last time i went, all the greetings and huzzahs got so loud i could barely hear my friends next to me. i like their welcomes, but do they also have to shout out orders all the time too?

I was very excited to try Ippudo after reading the amazing reviews. We got there around 6 and only had to wait 20 minutes. This place is amazing! When you are brought to your table, everyone welcomes you. We all had, pork buns, edamame, and the Akamaru Modern. The pork buns were delicious. They were a little spicy but definitely not so spicy that you couldn't eat it. The edamame come with yuzu salt (a Japanese salt) on the side, so you can control the amount of salt you put on them. The Akamaru Modern was fantastic! It was a pretty large portion, and worth every penny. Yes, the place is a bit pricey for Ramen, but in my opinion, it is completely worth it. It is very fresh. You can actually see the chefs cooking everything. Service was quick, but we also never felt rushed to leave. I would definitely go back and hope I do sometime soon.

We ended up choosing Ippudo in the Village. Good place, although the wait times for a table are ridiculous. It has a nice, club-like feel to it without the loudness associated with a club. The food is great. We started with the most popular appetizer, the pork buns. Good stuff. The pork had sirachi and a bit of a kick, but it wasn't overwhelming, which was appreciated. I had the "Classic" and while I thought the meat was a little tough, the ramen was tasty enough to make up for it. It snowed outside while we waited for a table. The snow was so bad that it felt like I was being poked and prodded by a bunch of icy needles whenever it hit unprotected skin. As a result, we had to take a cab home.

Food was great, the wait was not. We got here "early" on a Saturday afternoon (at 6:00pm) and had to wait about 40 minutes which wasn't that bad. I've heard people have waited 2 hours to eat there. There waiting area was so packed the boyfriend and I decided to take a walk around the neighborhood. It sucked that we had to periodically come back and check in since they don't call you when you're table is ready. We finally got to sit and I felt like a kid in a candy store. I had no idea where to start. We decided on the Tako Wasabi (raw baby octopus in wasabi sauce) and it was delicious. It was a small portion but for $5.00 what do you expect. It was a great starter to the rest of my meal. We of course ordered the pork buns and they were yummy. I was sad that I devoured it so quickly before stopping to savor every bite. Next we ordered the Shiromaru and the Akamaru since we had never been there and asked the server what the most popular ramen dishes were. Both came with hearty bowls of soup and noodles along with pork that fell apart in your mouth. We ordered an extra side of pork belly and that was unreal. I really enjoyed the soup the ramen came in since it wasn't full of MSG like other ramen places serve. I knew it was better since I wasn't crazy thirsty the entire meal or afterwards. All in all, I would come back here again and try the other ramen dishes but I need to go early or will end up waiting 2 hours to eat.

I don't remember the name of the dish i got, but it had a big ball of ginger in the middle of the bowl and it tasted like heaven on earth. I thought i was eating strategically, drinking the broth first and then the noodles, but my strategy failed. The broth was incredibly filling and Ippudo doesn't allow customers to take food out of the restaurant. Bummer!! Ê I think about this ramen often. At all times of the day. Not even kidding. The only negative thing i have to say about this place is that the bartender was rude. He was clearly talking about me and a friend in front of us. I think he was upset we were sitting at the bar and not drinking, but no one else was in there at the time and we were waiting for a table! Fortunately, the rest of the staff's generosity made up for that fool's ignorance.

Honestly, the wait time is what makes this a 4 star restaurant. It's a great place, the ramen is terrific, but come on. Ramen Setagaya is a great approximation but without the wait... but sometimes you need the best ramen in the city.

BEST RAMEN EVER! i went to nyc in the summer just for ippudo, and it worth the trip! the place is not what i expected it to be, i expected a really quiet place where waiters and waitress are all japanese. but as i walked into the place, a 6 feet high while guy greeting me in japanese, the music was loud and even we went there on a rainy day, the place was full! the ramen was so rich in flavor, and the chashu was the best i ever had. they have a lunch special menu so i had a eel don too, it was an experiment for me because i hate the smell of any seafood, but it turned out to be really delicious, without any seafood smell.

They raised the prices of the buns to $9! ÊGrrr....$4.50 per bun is outrageous, yet I sadly still ordered them. ÊThey have a new shrimp version ($10) that I want to try next time! ÊI also had the samurai spareribs, which was soft and tender....but a little over-sauced so it made me super thirsty.

I waited no more than 15 mins. to be seated because it was 2:00 pm Sat afternoon and they were about to close at 3:30 pm, really not so many people at that point. However, the ramen is jusk ok in my opinion, kinda disappointed. Only compare to Totto ramen, I paid more and got less noodle. Maybe the taste is a little bit better, but overall, I'd chose Totto for sure.

I got here 10 minutes before opening and there was already a few people waiting. ÊI got the Shiromaru Hakata Classic ramen set that came with eel over rice and a small salad. ÊThe eel was the best part because I wasn't really feeling the ramen too much. ÊI think the top spots in LA and Vancouver, Canada has this place beat. ÊThe chashu was cut very thin and there wasn't much of it. Ê I'm used to fatty pork that just melts in your mouth. ÊI was disappointed and I think this place is overpriced so I'm giving it a three. ÊI paid $21 total.

When going here expect to wait. Plan for it, go to a nearby bar, go get bubble tea at St. Alps (thats what I do), but do not go expecting to be immediately seated. However for myself and my husband it's totally worth the wait. My husband adores ramen and he loves the akamaru ramen here. The pork and chicken buns are excellent as well. There is also a secret off menu vegetarian wasabi ramen that is awesome. The ramen has layers of flavor and you leave feeling happy with warm soup belly. It's the equivalent of how happy you can feel after you eat chicken noodle soup when you're sick - comforting. You can also have a refill of noodles if you have enough broth in your bowl. Be wary of this though because they have no means for you to take home leftovers. So make sure you can handle it before you ask for a noodle refill. Dessert was not as impressive - the green tea creme brulee was awkward in flavor and overly pungent. ÊOur waiters were great though, even though the switched all the time, they were attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu.

The pork buns are great. The special fried pork appetizer is also very good. i've tried almost all the ramen dishes and it was pretty good. the bad: Don't even think about going here if you're hungry immediately. Ê They don't take reservations. ÊWait depending on the people is between 45min - 2 hours. ÊAt the end of the day, there are plenty of other restaurants that serve ramen. ÊIt is after all just noodles. the hostess is not always accurate on the timing of the wait, but that varies on timing. I would suggest a very early or very late dinner. Ê6:30-9pm is the WORST time to go, unless of course you have nothing to do for 2 hours, but wait for noodles.

Loved this place! Went for the first time at noon on a Sunday expecting a long wait but was pleasantly surprised that the two of us were seated within 5 minutes. The interior is nicely decorated with modern clean lines, minimal but still a little stylish. Like they were trying but not trying too hard. Anyways, we ordered 2 ramens - the shiromaru and the akamaru. We both got an egg to go on top. Everything came out piping hot and absolutely delicious. The soup was flavorful and the noodles were quite chewy, almost al dente but softer. The overall taste was excellent and I would say it rivals ramen on the west coast. Will definitely be back!

i've definitely had much better Japanese ramen elsewhere. ippudo is another place hyped up by food network television, and honestly it's not really worth the long wait people endure. i've had the miso and the akamaru modern, and both were just ok. for the same price, i'd rather go to this hole-in-the-wall i know run by one Japanese couple, where the ramen is quality and served in huge basin-like bowls.

I heard many good things about Ippudo and it was said there's always a long line to prove that. Ippdo was fanciest noodle place I've ever been to with dark red lighting. The food turned out to be overly hyped. It's not bad noodles but disappointing after expecting the real thing. Go here if you want to wait 3 hours for $16 bowl of a-ok noodles. They do have a cool ramen bar with 2 for 1 draft beer specials.

Ever wondered what real fresh-cut ramen tasted like? Well, Ippudo is the perfect place to find out. The first time I was ever here was on an impromptu dinner with a friend. The second time, roughly a year later with the same friend. I tried a third time with a larger group of people, but it was a 2 hour wait, so my friends decided to pass. This place normally has an extremely long wait and you can't make reservations. You can only put your name down on a list the day of and see if they have space for you. Luckily, the two times I made it in had wait times under 10 minutes. If you're down to wait, there's a bar near the entrance to bide your time and wet your appetite. I fell in love with the atmosphere of the place the moment I stepped into the dining area. Upon entering the dim dinning area out back, you're greeted with all the waitresses and waiters with what I can only guess is "hello" in Japanese. The layout changed a bit in between my two visits there. The current layout has booths for larger parties all along the left side (as your entering) peppered with large communal tables with one or two smaller tables with center arrangements large enough to give you and your neighbor seating across some privacy. On the right side there looks to be a short cook half kitchen for what seems to be where the fresh-cut noodles are prepared. The kitchen is directly behind all of this. The lighting is dim, giving a sort of private feel if you've come with a guest or a date, so you can feel like you can comfortably have a conversation. There's music playing in the background, but it was never loud that you had to feel like you had to yell to have a conversation. Surprisingly the menu isn't large, which is great. Ramen places typically give a menu too large, so the newbie is left reading the menu items back and forth trying, but ultimately failing, to find something familiar. I ordered the special beef kalbi as an appetizer for me and my date and couldn't have been happier. She typically doesn't eat Asian food (her only ramen experience is from the packages of bad ramen), so she was supremely happy with the kalbi and couldn't wait to see how the ramen was. It was just enough to get us ready for the oncoming ramen flavor onslaught. I had the Shiromaru ramen, which is the classic ramen. I was instantly impressed with it. It had fresh-cut ramen, which I've never ever had before, most places make the broth, but buy premade ramen noodles. The noodles were boiled perfectly, soft, but not too delicate that it would turn into mush. The pork slices were flavorful and not too salty, but melted in your mouth. The soft-boiled egg, which is something that's pretty difficult to get right, was delicious. The outside of the egg had a slightly softer texture than your hard-boiled egg, but took in all the flavor of the ramen. The yellow yolk was perfect, it wasn't too gooey and still had its yellow sheen. The ramen broth was excellent, it wasn't oily as is typical of ramen broth and didn't have an overpowering salty or soy sauce flavor to it. You can tell it was made extremely fresh and not just sitting out reducing to a salty oily mess and complemented the fresh ramen noodles perfectly. If you have the desire to, for a few more dollars, you can ask for more ramen noodles. I've done this twice and the noodles aren't are good as if you had it fresh with your broth, but still very satistying. If you can stomach the $15 bowl of ramen, then this is the best place in Manhattan to grab your freshest bowl of ramen.

I've only been here once so I'll save the last star for a few more visits. But this place is so good I heard, that u have to get there when it opens... or u won't get a seat. So I followed my friends advice and patiently waited til the clock struck 5... Sat down. Menu browsing. Apps, entrees ordered... Packed! Food was outstanding I ordered the Shiromaru Hakata Classic. Rich broth, tender pork, fresh noodles. Can't wait to go back. Great date spot.

As a self professed ramen connoisseur, I am here to boldly proclaim that Ippudo is not worth the wait and does NOT live up to the hype. ÊMaybe, just maybe, this review is unfair because so much hype does surround Ippudo. ÊIn fact the build up before my first visit here was akin to the build up which precedes a young man's first ever orgasm. You see, I've been to over a dozen ramen places in the city and settled on my favorite, Ramen Setagaya on St. Mark's. ÊBut I kept hearing about how Ippudo is on the next level. ÊThe problem was that I wasn't willing to wait 2 hours in line for ramen. Ê With age comes patience, so last week I decided to sign up and wait in line for this so-called transcendental ramen. ÊHere's my 2 cents: The interior is dimly lit and nice for a date and the constant shouting in Japanese by staff prevent it from seeming pretentious. My date and I started with edamame which was overcooked and pork buns which were very soft and delicious. Ê My shoyu ramen was pretty good. ÊUsing Setagaya as a yardstick, I would say that Ippudo's broth was slightly better but Setagaya outdoes them in every other ramen category including noodle texture, and taste of the pork. ÊOverall, I would call it a tie between Ippudo and Setagaya shoyu ramen. My date ordered the Akamaru Ramen. ÊKnowing that I'm an amateur food critic, she let me try some. ÊThe Akamaru broth was surprisingly bad. It is DRENCHED in OIL and actually not tasty. Ê It truly lacks the subtle, light flavor which made me fall in love with ramen in the first place. My fellow ramen fans, Êif you want very tasty, well-priced ramen in a chill environment, then go to Setagaya on St. Marks. Ê If you enjoy waiting in line for 1-2 hours and want to pay more money for ramen that is good but surrounded by unwarranted hype, then Ippudo is your place.

Having spent a fair amount of time in Japan and being a big fan of Japanese cuisine this place was a bit of a let down. We went there for a Valentines day dinner expecting it to be amazing (after all it has over 2000 reviews and still 4 stars on yelp, who has that??) and although it wasn't terrible it was just underwhelming. The hostess was incredibly disinterested. The food seemed to be an 'American' take on Japanese food, all the tempura was very heavy and the flavours couldn't be said to be precisely balanced. To be fair we ordered a series of appetizers and didn't try the Ramen which seems to be what this place is lauded for, however after my boyfriend almost regurgitate his oyster, we left feeling less than satisfied.

I heard good things about this place from friends and read good reviews, so I was excited to try it when I got to NY. ÊMy friend and I split the pork buns appetizer...OMG, it's so good! ÊThe pork just melts in your mouth, the buns are soft, and the lettuce balances out the fat from the pork. ÊI ordered the Akamaru Modern Ramen and my friend ordered the Spicy Ramen (I forgot the name). ÊMine was DELICIOUS! ÊMy friend's was really good too! ÊThe ramen does remind me of the ramen I had in Japan...oiishi desu! ÊThe broth was really good, the noodles were QQ, and the pork slices melted in my mouth. ÊThe ramen is pricey though, $14. ÊFor $3 more, you can order a set with your bowl of ramen. ÊA set includes bowl of ramen with your choice of rice bowl with some type of meat. ÊIf I have time, I will try to go back before I leave.

I have to appreciate that they come so close to living up to the impossible hype. Not an easy task, but they perform admirably. On my first visit here a few years ago, I knew nothing of their fame, and I had decided to forego the ramen. While I remember the grilled chicken being more than satisfactory then, it was still a huge blunder not ordering from their ramen selection, as otherwise I would never have waited so long to go back. The ramen is of course phenomenal (not necessarily the best in the city, but definitely in that debate). The noodles is pretty much perfect. Definitely get extra toppings, the tori ramen would feel incomplete without a poached egg. The Hirata buns are awesome starters: soft bun, perfect amount of sauce, and meat that isn't overly fatty. The chicken wings are also tasty, but could use more sauce especially with such thin skin. The waits can be very long, but what else did you expect? You can put your name down on a waiting list and sit at the bar. If the bar is too crowded (and it probably will be) then go outside to another bar and call to check up on the status of your table. Reasonable I'd say. I did a walk-in reservation about 3 hours prior to our dinner (recommended if possible when you go with a large group). The host was quite pleasant and helpful. In fact, every one working there was pleasant. The servers were jovial and friendly, and most importantly very efficient. Although, I despaired when I was the lone diner at our table to order dessert (yes I know, fatass alert), and the waiter brought it out with 6 spoons. The matcha brulee was amazing by the way, I highly recommend finishing your meal with it. One of my friends described it as green tea candy with a delicious caramel-y crunch. Her description is accurate, except it tasted better than that sounds.

Positioned conveniently in between the East Village and Union Square, Ippudo is a lively spot for an adventurous weeknight meal. ÊI went on a Wednesday - and thank god my friend had stopped by 2 hours earlier to put our name in for a reservation. ÊI've heard tales of waiting for 2 hours for a seat, which is either in a booth surrounding the main dining area or at communal tables. ÊAt the communal tables, you're seated next to (rather than across from) your dining partner. ÊThe room is very noisy, enhanced by the tradition held by the wait staff of yelling each time a new customer enters the dining room - it's not a "woo" or a cheer, more like a monotone moan. ÊAnyway, it's a little different but by no means a deal-breaker. ÊThe tattooed and pierced chefs stand behind a transparent barrier, which is fun to watch as they work over sizzling pots preparing the several different varieties of Ramen offered here. My friend and I started with the Hirata (Pork) Buns, which were my favorite part of the meal. ÊSliced pork belly with Ippudo Spicy sauce, wrapped in a cushy bun that reminded me of memory foam. ÊThe word "spicy" on a menu usually scares me - if the restauranteur thinks it's spicy, it's probably way too intense for me - but these had an appropriate amount of heat to balance the creamy, soft bun outside. Ê For our ramen course, I tried the Akamaru Modern - soup noodles with Ippudo's special sauce, pork belly chashu, cabage, kikurage, scallions, miso paste & garlic oil. ÊThe ingredient list makes it sound more complicated than it is. ÊIt's admittedly challenging to eat, with a combination of an asian boat spoon and chopsticks. ÊPerhaps I overindulged on pork belly this meal, but it was delicious in both courses. ÊThe ingredients are somewhat segregated in the soup upon serving, so it's fun to mix it up and try different elements of what usually is a very basic soup. ÊOverall - a fun spot to try new foods. ÊThumbs-up.

I'm torn...I wish I could give 3.5 stars. Atmosphere: Awesome, though a bit loud for a first date. But great music. Service: Great! The waitress went through a number of the dishes and made recommendations according to our tastes and limitations (one of us was a pescatarian, difficult at such a pork heavy place). But the place loses points for the wait (2.5 hours for us). One of our party put us down and went home to shower, another went to the gym, etc. Probably the way to go if you're close enough. Food: We had the shrimp buns instead of the pork buns. They were really small, but really good. Yet the mayo and lettuce combo somehow reminded me of fast food. The ramen was really good and the broth had an intense and amazing flavor. The broth was a little more oily and fatty than I would have liked, though, and it just made the dish really heavy rather than...crisp (does that even make sense for soup?). The noodles were ok and the meat was tender. Overall I'd recommend it if you have the time to wait around, but it's by no means the only ramen place to ever go to in NYC.

Ramen is good, pork buns are good. Minca has better noodles IMO. The wait is ridiculous, the hostesses are not welcoming at all. Saori E. is completely right, ramen should come with an egg, $15 bucks for ramen is idiotic and $17 for ramen with an egg that it should already come with is repulsive. And btw this place is so unbelievably pretentious for what their main thing is. it's friggin ramen for chrissake! its supposed to be low key, warm, rustic and cozy. Everybody in there is too cool for school it's gross..even in Japan a great bowl of ramen would never go past 1000 yen (roughly 10 bucks) The broth is better than Minca, barely but everything else about this place is soooo OVERRATED and OVERPRICED.

Went a few months ago after reading about the hype on Yelp. We waited about 30 minutes with no reservations. The food is great, but the price is just too much for me.

Visited this place with a glowing recommendation of a friend.

ÊAmazing and probably the best part about this place. ÊI could have eaten 10 of them. ÊWe also had a salad constructed of tofu, avocado and some type of roe on a bed of glass noodles with a balsamic & black sugar dressing.

ÊThe broth is extremely rich & the homemade noodles are good but halfway through, I was done. ÊIt's so rich! It's true that the wait it about 45 minutes. ÊI went on a Sunday at about 1 in the afternoon. ÊThe price is definitely more than some places but it's not unreasonable. ÊThe service is excellent, the atmosphere is pretty inviting to conversation and the food is good. I have to agree with some of the other reviews that it wasn't as 5-star worthy as it could have been. ÊIt is very good though. ÊI would definitely go back to try some of their other items.

Don't mind the wait..... your tummy will thank you for it! My taste buds are excited just thinking about this place. I went here during happy hour for dinner with friends. While the wait was 40 minutes, we endured thanks to our two for one beers. While I guzzled my Kieren, I waited for the rest of my party to arrive, since I couldn't be seated without them. Once seated, my friends- who had been here before recommended the sticky buns and spicy ramen. I also decided to order the fried chicken wings because I love my chicken. The chicken sticky buns were amazing. The buns were nice and light, the chicken was tender and well seasoned. Had I not been with my patrons, I could have eaten our entire order, finished my beer and been perfectly happy. ..The chicken wings were great too, mildly spicy, very crunchy with a light taste of sesame oil. I could have stopped right there, but I still had my spicy ramen on its way. The ramen was very simple, very traditional and very good. The broth was spicy but not hot and very very flavorful. The sliced pork floating around in the bowl was the best part of the dish for me.. My vegetarian co-eater ordered one of the tofu dishes, and as a connoisseur of all things tofu, she was very impressed and gave it two spoons up. I would definitely be back here. I think it would be a great "lets get together I haven't seen you in forever" spot if you can stand the wait. The price was reasonable (there were five of us), we paid $28 each, the tip was already included on the bill. Again the wait is long, so I wouldn't go here if I was feeling famished. The service is okay its not fantastic so definitely don't go here expecting to be waited on hand and foot. Enjoy!

Apparently if you're a Korean-American somewhere in your 20's this is where you should be eating. I ran into four different friends here on the same night! But even if you're not so inherited, Ippudo is awesome and you should check it out! Their classic ramen broth is the richest I've had in the city. The noodles themselves are ok, thinner and more flat than some other ramen noodles. But they are made fresh every morning in-house, according to one of the 20 servers that brought food out to us. You can eat most of your noodles and then when you're almost done, ask the waiter for an extra order of noodles and you can have it with your leftover broth. Despite being the total carb junkie, I devoured all the soup and forgot to order the second helping. Gah! Appetizers are yummy but on the smaller side. Not a sweet tooth, but even the dessert sweet tofu was good. Much bigger than it seems from outside, cool decor, and plenty of mmmm's and slurps to be heard. Must go back!

After living 2 blocks from this place for a year, I finally waltzed into Ippudo with my girlfriend last week. I would have stopped in earlier; however, the crowd of people parked outside has usually deterred me from setting foot in the seemingly claustaphobic restaurant. I walked in an put our name in, and was told the wait was 2 hours. Not big deal to us. We parked our behinds on one Êof the railings/benches?/metal bars near the front of the place and ordered a couple of $6 beers from the bar. They also offer plenty of speciality mixed drinks - sake, etc. I'll probably try one of those next time; they looked creative but I was taking it easy that night. While waiting, we ordered a few $4 apps. The cucumber was crispy and Êthe touch of sesame oil and sea salt was simple but fantastic. The pork buns were decadent - probably a bit more rich than needed with the mayo - but so yummy. The edamame was edamame. ÊThe bar wasn't as crowded as I expected, and we were seated within 45 minutes. For dinner, we ordered the fish balls with radish and mountain peach. They were excellent. We were not very adventurous with the ramen - I ordered the classic, she ordered the modern. ÊThe dish was a bit light on the pork for $13, but the flavors were great and I could have always added the braised pork belly for $3. The broth was rich and the fresh ginger sealed the deal for me as the best ramen I've ever had.* The service was excellent. The servers paused to describe the meals after they served them. Everyone who worked there was very nice. And the digs were great - seating was tight but given the L-shaped chairs we felt we had more than ample privacy. I recommend Ippudo. *A note on my experience with ramen. I am no pro. I have been to Japan once and was only in the airport. I think all I consumed there was cigarettes. So my only comparison is Momafuku. I thought Ippudo was cheaper (especially on the drinks) and less sodium-saturated than Momafuku. I have not reviewed Momofuku. I ate there once and will not be returning. I will definitely be hitting Ippudo again.

FANTASTIC!! Their Akamaru Modern ramen still haunts me in my dreams. Everyone at our table liked it even better than their classic ramen. Also really liked their crispy chicken appetizer--wow! Would definitely be there every other day if it wasn't for the wait (we put our name in, and were promised 30-45 minutes at 9:00PM on a Friday night. We probably waited slightly longer than that.) The only thing that was slightly weird was when I asked for my leftover ramen to go, they wouldn't let me take it. They said even if they separate the noodles and the broth, the broth congeals too quickly. Probably means there is a good bit of fat in the broth, but it's amazing, so I'm not going to think about it. Only wish I could have had my noodles to go. Thanks, Ippudo!

Worth the wait. Last week was only my second time at Ippudo because I'm generally not much for long restaurant wait but the food at Ippudo is well worth it, just be sure not to go when you're stomach is already grumbling or get a snack prior. The ramen is made fresh on the counter at the back of the eating area and if you're going to eat a bowl full of noodles this is the one to save up for. They taste light, fresh and don't have any of that gummy/ starchy that lots of ramen tends towards. Unless you know yourself to be a voracious eater or have trained your stomach for a few days I'd recommend splitting a bowl of ramen with a friend since they don't allow any leftover take outs. My favorite is the Akamaru Modern but the Classic is a good pick for a lighter broth.

I can't wait for this place to turn not-trendy, because then it will have it all. The most flavorful ramen broth I've had outside of Japan, lots of yummy appetizer dishes and a great ambience - albeit a bit loud. The prices are on the high end for ramen (I mean, let's be honest - it's noodles in soup), but it's totally worth it on a cold winter day. I'd recommend getting the first ramen dish on the menu, and then be adventurous with some side dishes.

I'm sorry, but the people who give this place fewer than 4 stars are insane. ÊThey're insane. ÊThis is pretty much one of the best meals you can get in New York City, and is hands down the best ramen I've ever tasted. ÊI have waited upwards of two hours for a table on busy nights and yet have never regretted it. Ê For me, this restaurant begins and ends with the Akamaru Modern. ÊIt is the best soup they offer, and while I enjoy the others soups I've tried, they've never bested the Akamaru. ÊTry it with the bakudan (spicy paste) and egg. ÊThe egg yolks really soaks up the soup flavor and makes for what is the best bite of the night. It goes without saying that the pork (hirata) buns are stellar. ÊSO much tastier than the ones of Momofuku. ÊThey taste almost like high-end, Japanese mutations of the McDonalds hamburger. ÊSomething about the mayo, lettuce, soft bun, and umami flavor. Ê The shishito peppers are also a nice appetizer to nosh on while waiting, and their plum wine cocktail is awesome. ÊStop what you're doing. ÊAnd go eat here.

My favorite restaurant in Manhattan. Period. -- Aside from the long wait, everything here is spectacular. -- The Ramen soup (I always order the Akamaru Modern) and Pork buns NEVER disappoint! -- I usually order extra hot sauce on the side, and I add a lot of the sesame seed powder (cool sesame seed grinders on each table) -- Make sure you say "KAE DAMA" at the right time. The waiter will come over and refresh your broth with a fresh bowl of delicious Ramen noodles. -- The reason this place is ALWAYS packed, while every other Ramen restaurant is empty, is, I believe, the broth. The broth is sublime. -- I bring people here all the time... It's a HOME RUN every time! I l

I had the a great dinner here. It's a small place that fills up quickly. Fortunately I got here early. I started with the white beer, which was as hoppy as they had in terms of beer, and it was good. I also had the chicken buns, the chasiu pork, and the ebi shumai ramen. The chicken buns rival Momofuku Ssam's buns, but I didn't like that they already put the hot sauce in the buns, instead of giving you a bottle so you can decide how much sauce. But it wasn't too hot. The pork was fall apart tender and nicely seasoned without being too seasoned. The ramen was pretty good, with a slice of pork and a few dumplings. The broth was very good and not the MSG-laden soup you get at cheap restaurants or from the packets. I sat at the bar facing the kitchen area, so I got to watch them cook. Everyone working there welcomes every person coming in so I got to hear that a lot while sitting there.

So, I'm not a big ramen person but I wanted to see what the fuss was about. All my friends were telling me I had to try ramen in New York during my first trip to the city so I went to the much recommended Ippudo NY for lunch. ÊI arrived right at noon when they opened because I was told they usually have a long wait and was lucky enough to get seated right away. When I got there, I was seated next to the kitchen and front walkway. It was a little loud with all the staff yelling every few seconds as someone entered the restaurant or received their food so I asked to be reseated to the back area where it was slightly quieter. I got the Akamaru Modern ramen which, I have to admit, was like heaven! So there really is such a thing as glorified ramen. I'd definitely go back despite the noise and the fact that it was the most expensive ramen that I've ever ordered at $20 including tip/tax.

Fresh noodles and perfect ...for lack of a more culturally correct word..."Al dente" texture. Order your noodle of choice from the menu and you'll be guaranteed a satisfying experience in comparison to all the other wannabe ramen places. There is only one appetizer that was unique to me an worthy of a try, except I'm drawing a blank as to it's name. so you might as well guess or go through the menu to find out...lol (my apologies to the more serious character reading my review) Service is great considering how much you're willing to pay for a meal. The staff is happy to give you a shout out when you walk in and when you head out after a hot meal. Discretion: Ramen noodle soup contains tons of MSG (Monosodium Glutamate) despite its tastiness. MSG is famous for diarrhea, headaches, excessive dry-mouth and dehydration, and the -itis...

Simply put, this is heaven in a bowl. ÊIt's worth the wait. ÊIt gets super packed during the peak times, but I've always had luck just going right after work around 6. ÊIt's an energetic atmosphere - the employees are upbeat and it's got a young (and hungry) crowd. Ê The noodle soups are amazing. ÊMy favorite is the shiromaru hakata - good, classic, and hits the spot. ÊI've also tried the akamaru modern - has great flavor, but it's too oily for me. However, my friends often get it and loooove it. ÊThey make their own noodles, and it just might be the best noodles I've had in manhattan. They're the perfect texture. Best yet - if you finish your noodles, you can order another serving for $2! kaedama please :) I've also had their pork buns, which are super super yummy. Unfortunately it's very overpriced, but if you can stomach the cost, your tummy will be very happy with you ordered this. It's good for groups, as they have big cozy tables/booths that can accomodate 6-8(+?) people. ÊHowever, it's a good idea to send someone in your party early to put your name down (if you go during peak times). ÊThere are only a few of these tables and they fill up fast. Keep in mind that they won't seat you until everyone in your party is there. Definitely worth the trip and the wait. ÊThe only drawdown is the crowds and the small waiting area. ÊBut hey, it's crowded for a reason. ÊI wish they would expand!

I went here while visiting my sister in New York. She got a recommendation from a coworker that is really into ramen noodles. He warned her about the wait so we decided to go when weren't that very hungry. After the one hour wait, we hungry for sure so it worked out great, we just sat at the bar and had a beer while waiting. During our wait we saw this wonderful pork buns come in and out of the kitchen and they smelled delicious! When we sat down we knew we had to get some pork buns and they were the most amazing things I had in my life! So good and I'm not even a huge pork fan! They come in chicken also but the pork was so divine. We both got the Akamaru Modern, which is the most popular dish according to our server. I liked it but it was very large and I wasn't able to finish it all. I liked the broth but I think next time I would try the ramen noodles without the broth (they had one with veggies and it looked very good). It's a pretty small wait which describes the wait (besides it being a great meal!) and my sister and I were seated at the counter but it was actually a great spot. They have an open kitchen so we could see directly what they were doing but the seats were very comfortable. We saw them make the cucumber appetizer and fried chicken, which I would try next time because they looked great (along with my pork buns of course!). Lastly, we both tried a desert, she tried the mascarpone and ice cream, which she liked but I'm glad I didn't order because I wasn't a fan. However, I did enjoy my Matcha Burlee, I love trying new types of creme burlee and although I'm not a huge green tea fan, I found it quite good. All in all, we both found the wait worth and if you go, you have to get pork buns!! I can't wait to go back the next time I visit New York City.

Favorite ramen place in new york. Would have given it a 5 except for the horrendous wait time. Been to the place a few times, typically on Saturday night, and almost always had to wait around 45 mins at the little bar in front. Drinks are fun (sake infused stuff), and the appetizers with little buns wrapped around pork belly was great (Hirata Buns). But the wait time, man that just kills me. On to the food.. favorite ramen is the Akamaru modern, that soup...yummm nice and porky...am drooling just thinking about it. The miso is good too. Haven't had a chance to try the specialties, cus it's a bit pricy and typically I'm pretty full after the drinks at the bar, the little buns, and the ramen.

If there is a god of ramen, he works at Ippudo. His brother, the god of long lines, mans the door. The wait is the wait. I have as much patience as the next New Yorker, but despite it I still give it 5 stars. Come on, there are x number of seats and 5x number of customers, they can't do anything about it. You can go walk around (Amsterdam Bar & Billards is across the street for the Homers and Barts, and the Strand bookstore is blocks away for the Lisas). Just come back way before the estimated time, they sometimes seat you earlier if others ahead don't return. The servers let you enjoy your meal once you are seated, and I have never felt pressured, and our water cups are always full. Now what have you been waiting for: The pork buns - steamed warm soft asian-style buns wrapping a glove of healthy green lettuce, 2 slices of the juiciest pork belly, and special sauce. To give you an idea, I am a beef not pork person. When I eat Kobe beef I cut away the fat - yes, a shame, but I can't stomach fat. Here, I gleefully swallowed. Arteries, take one for the team. The ramen - I eat ramen about twice a week for the past 10 years. I eat it from the holes-in-the-walls to the fifty dollar bowls. Nothing I write here adequately describes the god of ramen at work. Just go. Ê The various broths - I have tried the Modern and the Special (spicy) so far. Modern is spot on - not too salty, not too sweet, and the real test is when you toss a second helping of ramen (for $2, a steal), because here is when you can tell if the stock is too weak (becomes bland) or deteriorates with temperature (flavors change). None of these occur. The broth works. The half-boiled half-egg - unsung hero, comes with Modern, or add on for $2 (or $3?). How do they get it semi-hard on the outside and semi-soft on the inside? Yes that slice of pork belly was delish, but that egg wins a Best Supporting Ingredient. And I am not even an egg fan. Verdict? I'd eat my last meal here, and happily spend 2 of my last 24 hours in line.

DELICIOUS RAMEN, BUT A LONG WAIT THE FOOD: Delicious. ÊAll I've had is the akamaru modern and pork buns and both were excellent.

Wow! Amazing. Absolutely AMAZING. I've been here twice, and twice I got the Akamaru Ramen. Tip: Send one of your party group to get here before 6pm to put down your name to minimize wait time. I've gotten here both times before 6pm, and the most I've waited was about 30 minutes. So back to the ramen. Wow! The broth is simply amazing. I don't know much about the art of ramen and all, but I feel like that kind of soup cannot possibly be MSG. The texture feels like it can only be achieved after cooking with bone marrow, or some other fatty element. I feel that if I had it more than once a week, I might get a heart attack! Though I have to say, each time, I found the soup a teeeeny bit too salty by the end. But still, extremely yummy.

I was exhausted when I arrived at Ippudo: my friends were late, and it was still a while before our table opened up after that. We were stuck in a group of smokers out front, and I was ready to be grouchy and unhappy, and leave after appetizers. Instead, I had excellent sake in a CAN (Funaguchi Kikusui), shishito (friend chilies dipped in salt), a shallow pickle with sesame and chili powder, a bowl of fantastic vegetarian ramen with loads of mushrooms and seaweed, and almond tofu dessert to finish. All of it was incredible. They're lucky I didn't walk out with the wasabe oil that was served with my ramen. I didn't expect to be happy in this meaty and loud atmosphere, but our waiter was fantastic with suggestions, with figuring out good selections for a vegan, and I had a great meal and a great time. We closed down the restaurant, hours after I expected to be asleep. I'll be back.

So I think I am being very kind with my stars here. First of all my friends had been raving about this place for a while so finally we all went. The wait while extraordinarily long didn't bother me nor the rude bar tender that's just how it is sometimes. When we finally did make it downstairs the space is super cool just a really great space to eat in. My problem was my sub par noodles and the fact that we received the worst server in the place. ÊThe smaller dishes were fine nothing blew my socks off but good solid starters. My noodles happened to be very sweet too sweet for me to eat ÊI left the plate full and when I informed our server her only comment was I can get you a lemon so I left hungry and lighter in the wallet I guess I could of demanded they remove it from the bill but at that point it didn't matter I just wanted to leave. From what I can tell it was an off night for ippudo because my friends dishes were not as they remembered them and everything seemed a little off Êunfortunately I will not be going back to test out that theory, there are plenty of other ramen places that are great not as expensive with good friendly service to waste my time here.

What makes this place so hip and trendy is just that: people think it's hip and trendy. Why is this place the best? Because it's the only place people know of. It's also the most expensive. Expensive = best. Am I wrong..? The ambiance and decor is great. The ramen here is good so people will keep coming back. The soups here are the winning point but they only offer one type (thin) of noodles. I do have the complaint that it's too oily and makes me gassy, but that's the trade off between taste and health.

Best Overpriced Ramen ever. I've had Ramen in LA that taste just as good if not, better than Ippudo for 1/3 of its price. In all honesty, I would not come here too often. It is way too expensive for my taste bud, but what do you expect when its a chic, almost lounge-like setting restaurant in NYC? This is a place where you'd not only come for the great food, but also the ambiance. It definitely sets the tone for the rest of the evening. I wasn't planning on drinking that night, but being there made me want to have a drink or two.... ok maybe a few more than 2. :) And, it made me want to go out afterwards.... and do some damage in NYC. The broth and the noodles.... omg!!!! Im drooling just thinking of it. *slurp* if only we had one in San Jose. Even though its expensive here, I'd come back again and again... till I've tried everything on its menu .... just so I could figure out which dish would be my all time favorite.

I'm not gonna lie, every time I go down to NYC I go to Ippudo. But I've got a love/hate relationship with Ippudo.

Probably the most expensive bowl of ramen you'll ever have in your life. ÊIt's also probably the best bowl of ramen you'll have in America. ÊThey specialize in Hakata ramen which is milkier, thicker, collagen'y broth -- not the more typical soy based ramen you're accustomed to. ÊI think they also have shoyu and shio (salt based) ramen broths too, but haven't tried. ÊI liked Setagaya's shio ramen, so will stick to having it there. Also, the other appetizers are grossly overpriced. ÊI think $9 for the cucumber? And as noted 100000 times, the wait is horrendous. ÊI try to go at off hours. Ê3pm lunch, etc...

Their ribs are really good and they're always packed, prices are great and affordable and the noodles are pretty good as well. ÊWaiting time to get a table and the food wasn't bad but it seems like they rush you to get out so they can turn over tables fast, maybe it's just me.....

One of the best noodle places in NYC. If you are first time there then you should try their famous appetizer Hirata Buns! (pork)! it is awesome! Their Ramen is very good, so don't be shy and try ! You can't make reservations by phone, but only in person so be ready to be on the wait list for some time.

Back in San Diego now and missing the last meal I had in NYC before I left this past Monday. I had the Akamaru modern with nitamago(boiled egg), pork buns, and a cool sapporo light. Also I came in a little after they opened up at 11 and got seated right away, the place did get packed soon right after. Definitely made me want to stay in NYC and miss my flight just so I can have it for lunch again the next day.

I came here a couple of weeks ago, for the purpose of comparing their ramen with that of totto. after trying totto, i was convinced that there was no way any other ramen could top it...and i was right. everyone has different standards for their ramen, but for me, nothing i've tried beats totto...including ippudo. ippudo's ramen is good, but there are a few things in my opinion that fall short. first, the noodles are a bit too soft and mushy for my liking...i like my noodles firm, and for each noodle in my bowl to have its own defined texture (forgive me for sounding noodle-obsessed). second, the broth was too salty. third, the pork was too rough and not fatty enough. what i do like about ippudo though, is their pork buns! really delicious, fatty pork in a soft steamed bun, glazed with a sweet sauce. i also like the fact that for an extra $2, you have another serving of noodles to add to your leftover broth.

ÊThe one down side of dining at Ippudo is the insane wait that is almost always there when I go. ÊAll in all, the food is well worth the wait.

Hype hype hype. Any restaurant where the wait is more than an hour for a bowl of ramen is riding at least in part on its reputation. In line with consensus, the pork steamed buns were excelllent, but the ramen was mediocre. When the sodium in a dish manages to overwhelm your senses and tastebuds and you walk out of the restaurant feeling like your entire body is puckering up with dehydration, that's when you know you ODed on monosodium glutamate. And that's when you find a new ramen place.

Rockin' out to a trip to NYC. The six hour drive my JPN buddy is all ranting and raving about ramen, this restaurant and the amazing appetizers therein. I humor my good friend and nonchalantly agree to having dinner at Ippudo. Conveniently located near downtown NYC, this place was easy to miss and unassuming from the outside. It was almost closing this night so the appetizers were unavailable but they were still happy to accommodate me and my friend for some ramen. Sitting down to this large round table I'm delighted to open the menu and see a very decent selection of shochu (a very interesting distilled Japanese alcoholic drink [taste will vary dramatically between base ingredients) not to mention Japanese beer I've never heard of. Time fades my memory but the taste of Ginga Kogen beer does not. Although not exactly the best of all time but definitely worth exploring. I nonchalantly order the Akamaru Modern with kakuni(pork belly). I'm uneducated about pork belly at this point and was a bit afraid but its bacon unsmoked and all that. It arrives and the ramen was just the right firmness like an amazing Japanese al dente, the broth tasted like it takes a day to make minimum, the onsen tamago is an amazing soft boil the yolk has layers of color only present with careful cooking, and the kakuni was the embodiment of unctuousness. It was a bowl of umami through and through. From first bite to the last drop of broth, no words are passed from friend to friend. Upon completion and utter satisfaction I sit back in my chair and look at my good friend. I am a changed man. RAMEN! Update: Only order the extra helping of ramen (for $2!) at your own risk, this is a lot of food. Everyone(21 or over) must, I say MUST try the Kokuto Umeshu. This plum wine is made with an Okinawan exclusive "black sugar"(I hear its low calorie) and it is nothing short of astounding. This from a man that does not generally enjoy wines or umeshu. Notes: Peer into the looking glass as you make your way to the restroom. You'll see the ramen machine and 50 pound bags of various flours. This my friends is not your garden variety ramen. Me and my bud have actually traveled 12 hours total round trip just for this ramen and it was worth it every time. Definitely on my MUST do list anytime I enter New York City.

I have been to this restaurant more than 3 times. Though all the food we ordered Êhere turned out to be okay, the quality and the taste worsened each time. The soup for the ramen got worse, and the tea served was not as good as before, too. When I went there last time, I decided to try the new spicy tsuke soba and I was totally surprised when I saw what was served in the end. I wonder whether they tried to change a lot of their menu to be localized, since the tsuke soba doesn't look like any tsuke soba I ate in Japan.

Being the ramen lover that I am, I knew it was imperative I stop by this reported mecca for mouthwatering Japanese noodles. Apparently folks have waited 2 hours or more just to snag a seat inside. To avoid the wait, a friend and I stopped by at 4:30 PM, only to be told that dinner would start at 5 and that no reservations would be taken for the 5 pm hour. *I need to make a note here that the hostess was somewhat rude and seemed to have difficulty accommodating and understanding the questions we asked her. * In the end, my friend and I decided to make a reservation for 6 pm. When we ducked by again at 5 to check out the scene, there was already a very long line outside. Upon returning at 5:50, we were told to wait....and finally got seated at the counter about ten after 6. Service was fast and friendly. The menu itself is pretty diverse, and beyond the ramen dishes there are also what I'd call some American-Japanese fusion offerings such as the Hirata Chicken wings ($7) which are wings brushed with special house sauce. I'd heard great things about the Hirata buns ($8) so I ordered one up. I'm glad I made that decision. Each order comes with two buns filled with pork or chicken marinated in Ippudo spicy sauce, a bit of lettuce and a dollop of what tasted like mayonnaise. Note that the buns weren't the most amazing I've ever had, but they were definitely very delicious. My server suggested that I try the Akamaru Modern ramen ($14) which is supposedly the most popular on their menu. It's got Ippudo's special sauce, pork belly meat, cabbage, scallions, some garlic oil and miso paste. I also asked for an egg to go with it ($2). There must have been some confusion or miscommunication with the server at some point, because she gave me a plate of hot sauce instead of the egg; there was about a 5 minute wait to get the egg ready while I sat staring wistfully at my bowl of untouched ramen...but the issue was cleared up pretty quickly once the check came. My friend ordered the Kogashi Miso Ramen ($14) which had the most amazing broth...it had a smoky, charcoal quality and you could taste all the different elements mixed into it. My ramen was delicious as well, though the taste was familiar and not as exciting as I'd hoped...Read more at http://stuffthefoodie.net.

I come back to this place everytime I am in NYC!! This place should be on everyone's list to try when they go to NYC. The ambiance is dark and modern which I love. The only think I dislike about Ippudo is the long wait. So do not go when you are starving! This place is worth the wait though. The first time I went I waited 3 hrs before getting seated! We walked around though and checked out all the other local eateries in town. My favorite here is the Karata Ramen. It is on the more spicy side the way I like it. The pork buns are also delicious and a must try! This is a great treat for the cold weather in NYC.

I had real high hopes for this place. ÊThe last time I was in NYC I wasn't patient enough to wait in line so made it a point to come back hoping that time had cooled the masses. ÊIt was still a 45 minute wait which is totally Êexceptable for a busy restaurant. ÊThose pork buns really got the taste buds going and I was very eager to try my noodle order. ÊI got the Classic and the first few sips of the broth were heavenly....then it started getting heavier and heavier as it cooled to the point of cloyingly rich and then a little nauseating. They need to get rid of some of the oil that rises to the top of the broth as it cools. ÊNoodle were alright but I like mine a little chewier and squigglier. I've always liked places with a raucous kinetic rock n roll energy but I'm getting old and cranky and I just wanna eat my noodles in peace. ÊForget about having a zen eating experience here 'cause it is LOUD but very fun for the bubbly youth of today who can handle the extra fat and noise.

And i couldn't wait ever since i heard that its better than DK in los Angeles an better that "other Japanese soup" restaurants. We did wait about an hour to get seated but it understandable everyone wants to have the pork buns and we also ordered the stuffed chicken wings and I had the Akamaru Modern it had the most scrumptious pork and i had the pouched egg as well. i definitely saw the difference also in the noodles they very thin and delicious.

"How long is a wait for two, please?" I politely ask the hostess at Ippudo. "A 1-hour wait," ÊShe replies in monotone. Darn! Nothing to do but be subversive - we came this far, after all, we can wait longer! I put my name on the list, and walk outside in search of sustenance to carry Alex & I through the next hour's wait. Off we go to Otafuku (36 E 9th St), a small Japanese street food take-out not far away, and munch on cheese Takoyaki (a poor man's caviar blinis.) Onward to Sunrise Mart, where imported gastronomic oddities are always a treat for the eyes, as well as a hungry tummy. We're inspired to take home instant ramen, Pocky sticks, dry crispy crabs, and green tea. OK, maybe not all that adventurous, but at least the labels were all in Japanese! Ah, we arrive back to Ippudo in time for our table, and happily get seated at the communal table inside. Their dining room is pretty fabulous in comparison to other ramen houses around town: sleek black tile, installation art, (clean) open kitchen... Chic! Now I understand the long wait - the turnover is just like at a normal restaurant, there is no quick in-and-out service here. The menu looks nice,but at that moment I still have the attention span of a fly, so I lean over to the man on my left & ask for a recommendation (I overheard his description of ingredients to his friend in great detail - a sign of an educated consumer!) He suggests that I order Akamaru Modern, which is what he was having (soup ramen with ippudo's special sauce, pork belly chashu, cabbage, kikurage, scallions, miso paste & fragrant garlic oil.) Alexander orders Karaka Men (soup ramen with special blended hot spice, served with pork belly chashu, kikurage, cabbage, onion, minced pork & scallions) and Hirata Buns - pork buns (they were not bad, but the reigning champion is still Fatty Crab.) 1 appetizer, 2 ramen dishes, 4 beers, no dessert, and the check is $65. That seems excessive since most places would charge a fraction of that, but this is Ippudo, and I undoubtedly claim that they serve the best ramen, and I will give them all my money for a bowl. And will happily wait for an hour to eat it too! The only thing which clouded my overall experience at Ippudo was the welcome shout "Irasshaimase!" to new customers. It was too frequent, too loud, and interruptive of my conversation (Alex & I had the pleasure of meeting a great couple of ramen enthusiasts visiting from California, who also confessed to being hungover. My point: shout less!)

Liked the Karaka Kogashi Miso Ramen way more than the Akamaru Modern Ramen. People on Yelp loved the Akamaru, which was why we ordered them, however the noodles were not nearly as substantial as in the Karaka - and the flavors were not as bold or spicy. The Karaka noodles were chewy and plentiful, in a rich spicy broth - however a little on the greasy side. My co-eater said after eating the Akamaru, "I could eat 3 slices of pizza" - I groaned because after eating the Karaka i was super full. Was definitely not crazy about the slices of pork in either dish and opted out of eating those. We also got the pork buns - which yes, were good BUT not what we were expecting - they were served with lettuce and mayo so it was like we had a mini pork sandwich before eating our ramen. I wouldn't necessarily order them again. I gave Ippudo 2 stars mostly because my partner was disappointed with the Akamaru, I didn't love the lettuce/mayo combo on the pork bun and while the Karaka were a solid dish of ramen they were on the greasy side. PS - Waited a solid hour and thirty minutes at 7pm on Êa Thursday night. Would NOT do that again here but would always happily do it for Momofuku ramen and pork buns.

I crave this place....I crave everything about it...What I appreciate about Ippudo is that not only does it taste better but they actually make their own ramen noodles (unlike momofuku their competition). ÊThe staff is very nice and accomodating to your needs as well. The vibe is very chill; for lunch its very laid back mainly because people stop in by themselves with only a book and ramen in front of them...Dinner is fun, much more of an upbeat energy than lunchtime. ÊThis is my IDEAL dinner menu if my stomach were able to contain all this goodness; Shochu w/ Fresh Squeezed Grapefruit Juice (awesome cocktail), Yamitsuki Goma Kyuri (japanese cucumber sliced and mixed in with sesame oil and flakes of goodness), then an order of hands down the best pork buns your mouth will EVER encounter, top that off with the Akamaru Modern Ramen (best with extra Kakuni and Nitamago).

I finally figured out how to eat at Ippudo without the hour and a half wait. Go at 11 am. I ordered the akamaru chashu, and it was intensely porky as advertised. The noodles are probably the best I ever had. The pork belly was rich but not as melt-in-your-mouth as I would have expected. And for some reason the usual ramen trimmings were substituted by seaweed and cabbage. Do not like cabbage in my ramen. The broth was so intense in flavor and richness, I felt it clogging up my arteries mid-slurp, in a good way. The food was almost good enough to drown out the incessant greetings and orders shouted out by the staff. And by the time I left at 11:30, there was already a line.

its still amazing ramen, akamaru ramen, but i definitely think it wasn't as spicy/flavorful as the last time i had it... might be a consistency thing but still great. Êwe also ordered the Yamitsuki Goma Kyuri (cucumbers) which is very refreshing, dressed with sesame oil, chili flakes and panko crumbs. the pork Hirata Buns are still good and if you wanted to share, you can ask them to cut it in half for you, very helpful. Êthe Bakuretsu Tofu is really good with the crunchy noodles, i definitely think it was more liquidity then the last time i had it but its solid. to avoid the wait, we came at 11 when it opened and only had to wait 5 minutes.

Now to quote Wayne Coyne: "You have to be joking They wouldn't do what you said Oh, my vision is blurred again You have to be kiddin' me They wouldn't do those unspeakable things Oh, my Jesus It's worse than you think" I'd like to take an autopsy of many many many (some say many many) brains.

A resounding NO...ELEVENTY BILLION TIMES OVER!!! The short (long) list of WHY's... -Special Ramen with Monkfish Liver, Cabbage and topped with Fried Red Ginger should NOT be in a conical bowl of mis-gastronomical proportions containing nothing more than 3 measly pieces of cabbage, a seemingly negligible hint of fried ginger, with a broth creamy and rich enough to kill a French Culinary Dean of Douchebags -Restaurants that want their food to be taken seriously should not create a club vibe the likes of which sicken the inner most core of anyone aiming to be served a decent bowl of ramen -The bar upfront is the beginning of the bullshit! ÊPointless and frivolous the bartender prays on duped souls with Asian pigtails like a Cheetah running down a 3-legged, retarded Thompson's Gazelle. -THE JAPANESE YELLING. ÊObnoxious Radar goes to 11! ÊShit! I know the tradition in Japanese Restaurants...the proverbial greeting in the native tongue. ÊTrad wisdom speaks of a split second welcoming that is exchanged between the cooks and the patrons as a sign of respect and gratitude. ÊThis place takes that idea and strips it down to the nude, injects it full of steroids, uppers and a pig trough of crack cocaine creating a no-holds-barred, never ending buzz kill of 20-something hipster employees shouting out "learn-ed" Jap-slang-sayings. -The persistence of the wait-staff to bear down on the every move and nuance of your meal. ÊGET OFF ME! And let me eat my overpriced Ramen for God's Sake! ÊSit Down and you're forced into drink and food orders. ÊThey forced a second napkin on my lap for a reason I still can't fathom...I was eating a grilled chicken dish for the love of God. ÊOur dishes were whisked away and our check brought nanoseconds after we chop-sticked our final bite with a falsely folksy "Take as much time you want finishing your Sake...here's the check" -The decor...I mentioned Club-Vibe before...well let me club your face with my fist! ÊThis place exists in stark contrast to every respectable Ramen establishment I've ever come to know. (Note: I haven't been to Japan...but Los Angeles is home to a more than serviceable and respected Japantown and Ramen culture and I know more than the countless droids that populate the East Village street grid like Banded Hyena's looking to scavenge the carrion remains of possibly once respectable Ramen culture! -Every employee was a Hipster Doufass. ÊKramer was not, but these fuckers are! ÊMy girlfriend put it clear as crystal as we waited for our table "Non-Hipsters need not apply" Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!! ÊQuiet yourself down Ippudo. ÊYou are killing my ability to enjoy even the most vice-influenced drunken orgy of a meal shared amongst hedonistic bohemian Brazilian Fair-going performance artists. This place needs to stop sucking itself off and come back down to the grime of real ramen. ÊIt's not good enough to be "up scale" as our very own newbie chef so kindly inserted into his defense monologue of the establishment when pressed to do so by me. ÊIt is, however, attempting to be up scale and it's certainly well aware of its attempt, which is the 5th ranked definition of "V-Neck T-Shirt" in Urban Dictionary. We had a small bottle of Sake: $18 We had a fake bowl of Ramen with a false bowl shape and nary a Ramen broth, not to mention a veritable "lie" in terms of ingredients: $13 We had a Sizzling Chicken that was serviceable but wasn't an appetizer, yet had as much food as one: $12 I could've flossed with Vodka and had the same experience in the end (in terms of drunkenness and over all caloric in take) This place has ZERO HEART! I can't tell you how much I hate that...I'm not a misanthrope. ÊI don't banish fun, great vibes, swanky (When appropriate) settings and presentations or anything else that is typically part of quality up scale dining. ÊBut Ippudo is so AWARE of their opinion of what they should be and their efforts are so cheaply contrived it's sickening... You don't make a couple wait 40 minutes for a "Table" and then say, "Sharon, your table is ready" and then while you walk that couple to their "Table" casually say, "Is the bar OK?"... This isn't a casual cafe...and even if it was, you have the self-dignity to ask the customer before you call them "We have an opening at the bar if that's ok? Or you can wait for a table"

the best ramen ever! the staff is friendly very efficient. The place is very clean and just beautiful to look at. If you want to experience the art of ramen sit by the cooks its amazing to look at. They say ramen is happiness in every bowl and they mean it everytime i come here i leave with a smile and a happy stomach ; ) you will too! Only catch is you should make reservations if youre going in the evening or a friday-saturday.

I have been sitting on this Ippudo review, waiting to try more ramen places in the area before making a decision. ÊThere are better places within walking distance that are not riddled with tourists, and the long wait here is completely ridiculous. ÊI have yet to achieve rock star status in order to be seated here in a decent amount of time. ÊMy husband and I came here on a weekday around 2:30 and the place appeared to be empty. ÊI guess that everyone had a reservation that showed up after us because it took us 45 minutes to be seated in the middle of the day. The dining area is very strange, there was a huge picnic size table that was just for singles eating by themselves and it appeared very awkward for them. ÊWe were seated at a large bar type table, which was for parties of two. ÊThe yelling back and forth that the staff does here is also really annoying because it is very repetitive and you cannot hold a conversation. ÊThe yelling in formal language is cute, and I have seen it work for place in St. Marks, but not here. The food comes out quick, and our waiter was nice enough to give me a free green tea. ÊBeing super expensive, the Pork Belly buns, definitely left more to be desired. ÊLet me give you the secret folks... go to any restaurant in Chinatown that serves BBQ meats and ask for folded buns. ÊThey will give you the meat, scallion, sauce, and buns and you can make as many as you want for 1/4 of the price. ÊHoy Wong (Mott St) being my favorite place to order these folded buns with duck. ÊAnd, then you will not have to deal with tragic globs of hot mayo running down your wrists either. ÊOr, you can be so bold to make them at home. ÊOMG what a concept! ÊIt might require some chopping and microwaving, as well as entering a Chinese grocery to purchase frozen buns to microwave. ÊThe buns at Ippudo were definitely of the same variety. ÊI was not about to throw down an insane amount of money for 4 chicken wings either. ÊThis place is crazy! My Shiromaru Chashu was very bland. ÊThe pork was tender and fine, but the broth did not have depth. ÊThe noodles tasted like super cheap dried flour noodles that you get for $1.25 at the grocery. ÊThe noodles were thin, limp, and did no have any flavor. Ê Anyways, you get the point. ÊI was not impressed, actually I was more infuriated with the whole situation, price, and quality of the food. ÊSum this place up in one word= RIDICULOUS!

How does this place not have more stars? It is impossible to not like this place. My fiancee and I planed to have lunch here but we got there right when they were closing, so we went shopping until dinner. We got back to ippudo around 7. It was packed! So packed we did not want to even try. However we we determined to find out what the big hubbub was about. So we made our way in to just find out we need to wait 45min. (be persistent people!) I had 3 beers then we found out (after asking again) it will be 30min. It was around 8-9 when we finally were called. Was it worth it you ask, YES! Love the atmosphere love the staff and the FOOD! Recommend for those who can manage on an empty stomach for long hrs and have no anger issues :) lol

The first ramen place I went to in NY. It is very good, one of the best in town! However, the wait is ridiculous (45 minutes on a weekday), and $13 for a bowl of ramen is kind of pricey. The chef's selected appetizers were very delicious (but small). The ramen was flavorful and pork delectable. If only there wasn't always such a huge line... The decor gives it a really high-class kind of feel. And sometimes on the way to the bathroom, you pass by the noodle room, you can see them making noodles.

My friend and I got there around 5:30pm on a Thursday, just in time to beat the rush. ÊWe asked what the most popular ramen was, and the waiter told us the "Akamaru". Ê It was SO good!!

NOOOMMSSS! om nom nom nom... its very dark in here... finding the hostess stand was quite the journey. there were three hostesses. one was nice.. the other just sat other people.. and one was super stuck up thinking she was gods gift to earth. BUT! the ramen i got outweighed the wait and the strange mixture of hostesses. I got the pork ramen and ate it with this fat spoon that was more like a ladle. delicious!! my noodle texture and softness was perfection! just enough saltiness.. the pork in here was fat i think.. but it was also delicious nonetheless. at the end my boyfriend didn't want dessert but i ordered the green tea creme brulee and it was pretty good.. very green tea-y. but i wouldnt be able to give a full review on this because of my boyfriends decision to take over my sweet treat. one thing we really liked was that everyone would be shouting in japanese.. even down to the white dude who was our waiter. but he wasn't yelling as loud and often as the large japanese male server. all in all great experience. would definitely go back!!

We went with some friends from Tokyo, who are not huge ramen fans and now live in Brooklyn. ÊThey warned us about a potential long wait to be seated, but we arrived at 6:15 and beat the rush - we were seated immediately. ÊRamen in Japan is often served in low brow mom and pop shops, but Ippudo is hipster, modern, cool joint. ÊOur Japanese guides enjoyed the design (they're architects and enjoyed the irony). We started with the fish buns, pork buns and chicken buns - with pork being the winner. ÊThey are like a taco using a fluffy white dough instead of a tortilla. The ramen was very delicious and unique in flavor and texture. I had the special with wasabi (it said wasabi ramen noodles, but it was wasabi oil) the first say 3 slurps went right up my nose and got me coughing. ÊOur table had the following soups: Akamaru - Êpork broth Akamaru modern - pork and chicken with miso Shiomaru - chicken with shoyu (soy sauce) I preferred the Akamaru modern - it had a deep savory flavor, without being too greasy or heavy. ÊThe ramen noodles are thinner than at other restaurants - are a fresh and straight pasta also (not wiggly like other ramen places) Our tab worked out to about $33 per person after gratuity. So if you are looking for a good working man's lunch - this is probably too fancy and too expensive. Ê But if you like hip foodie adventures and need nice digs then Ippudo is a great choice.

This place is packed during lunch time but it is totally worth the wait. A little bit pricey for ramen noodles but the taste is fantastic! I am pretty sure the people around me knew I was in heaven by the way I was slurping those noodles away! The service you get from the staffs are incredibly amazing and I could not stop myself from going to the front of kitchen counter and saying thank you & gochisousama to the cooks as I was leaving the restaurant. Can't forget about desert! Matcha Creme Brulee with the match ice cream topping was one heavenly ride. So for eating a Spicy Pork Bun from the appetizer, Shiromaru & Akamaru Ramen, and match Creme Brulee & Annin Tofu....totaled up to be about $60. Again, a little bit unthinkable if you ate the same dishes in Japan...but this isn't Japan, its located in New York, so yeah totally worth it!!! Ippudo, you need to come to Chicago!!!

I'll admit the food wasn't terrible. The pork buns are pretty good actually. The wait is a little ridiculous. 45 minutes at 6pm on a Tuesday? The prices are outrageous - $18 for ramen with some pork belly? Ok fine, if I must. But you won't let me take it home??? We got some song and dance about how they want you to experience the ramen with ambiance and don't want us to steal their recipe. My friend explicitly told them she wanted to get naked with the ramen later (no really, she said that) but no dice. They were 4 stars until they forced my 95 pound friend to stuff 6 pounds of noodles in her face for fear of wasting money. Won't be going back.

My friend and I came here for lunch on a Friday at 11:45am and we were seated immediately. Ê The pork buns were great (2 per order at $8), and the meat tasted like it was brushed with a sweet Teriyaki-type sauce. ÊI had the Shiromaru Hakata ramen lunch set. ÊSince I've always heard Hakata-style Ramen is famous, I wanted to give it a try and was very happy with my dish; thin al dente noodles, delicious broth, nice egg, good pork. ÊMy friend had the Yokohama, which came with thicker noodles and a heavier, sweeter, reddish broth that I wasn't too crazy about. ÊThey don't specify on the menu what sort of noodles come with each dish (straight, curly, thin, thick, etc.). ÊThe lunch set also comes with a bowl of rice where you choose one topping; I got the mentaiko, and it was good, but I was so full I couldn't finish it all. The decor is very chic-chic and cool and probably contributes to the slightly higher food prices. ÊI do feel the quality of ingredients they use here are higher than some of the other ramen joints I go to in NYC, but I'll still go eat at those, and I'll come back to Ippudo if I don't have to stand in line. P.S. If you want white pepper for your ramen, you have to ask for it; it's not on the table like other places.

Ippudo Ramen tastes just like the ramen I got in Japan. You can watch someone making fresh noodles in the basement, so you know you're not eating something prepackaged. The prices were a little high for me, considering it's just noodles. Tokyo is an expencive city, but I paid 6.00 in Tokyo for what I got here for 13.00. I guess this is NYC. The wait was extremely long, even on a Tuesday at 1:00 pm. We had about an hour wait for two people. Just know this before you go and make plans to wait somewhere else, because there isn't much room in their waiting area. We went to Think Coffee down the street, which was good too. Anyway, good, you know, for ramen, but overpriced and long waits. See my blog for more info: http://smileyjkl.blogspoÉ

1st time there, even though I've tried several times before but the 1+ hour wait always turned me away. This time, a 45 minute wait seemed to be a blessing compared to previous waiting times. I had the seared which was average at best. However, the noodles were delicious, as many reveiwers have mentioned. Not sure if I will wait 2 hrs for a bowl of noodles though. While eating, I noticed that the turnover of this place was fairly quick (fast ordering time and cooking); but clearing dishes off the table for new customers definately could've been faster. Overall, I would recommend trying out the place at least once, but can't say I would dedicate a 3 hour experience to this place regularly.

I went alone on a Sunday night around 6:30pm and waited about 40 minutes for a seat at the bar. I don't consider that a terribly long wait especially if the food is good. And indeed it was. Hirata Pork Buns - Good. Simply dressed with iceberg lettuce and mayo, the pork belly was glazed with their "special" sauce. They were as good as any I've had, but nothing terribly unique or exciting. Akamaru Modern Ramen - Amazing. Slightly chewy noodles in an "intense" pork and miso broth with half a soft boiled egg and piece of Berkshire pork. This is probably the most "flavorful" Japanese dish I've ever had. I don't think the price is too steep considering I'm likely to pay the same or more for a plate of pasta, which probably takes less work to make, at any decent Italian restaurant. The wait is the biggest downside. The staff can be quite loud as well. Friendly, but loud.

Because it is so difficult to find good ramen noodles in the US, I give you a 5-star for your creation! I will wait on a long line, will be satisfied with the price of a small bowl, and bear the (borderline lively) noise just to experience the smooth tonkotsu soup streaming down my throat........... After tasting some other dishes, such as fried chicken and grilled fish, I came to a conclusion that they are better at their specialty menu. I can't remember exactly what it was........tofu was accompanied by kuromitsu (black sugar syrup) and miso based sauce? I never had tofu with kuromitsu but it was a fabulous combination!

I lived as a foreigner in Tokyo and I've been a big fan of Ippudo since that time. ÊAnd I was thrilled that they came to NY. Their ramen is as good as it gets (well at least in NY).

ÊIn Tokyo, their ramen costs about 500 yen ($5). ÊHere, it's like $14! ÊReally??? It's just ramen.

Went here on a weekday evening with two friends and the wait was over an hour, which wasn't really that surprising. That gave us enough time to go down to Chinatown for some ice cream.

Two stars for fun trendy ambiance and good service. ÊThey even have a long wooden communal table like pain de quotidien. Now the ramen, I don't eat much but even the portions here are too small for me. ÊI wouldn't mind what size they served it in if it was at least good. Ê The ramen was al dente and good, but the broth, being the most important part of the ramen was less than impressive, it was too salty. ÊBut for some, salty is equivalent to tasty, hence lot of stellar reviews. ÊAlso lacking in the broth was the flavor profile- very one dimensional- felt like having salty instant noodle soup- with pork fat added to it.

Seriously guys?!?? 4 & 5 stars?!? Nobody here gas ever been to east Asia or chinatown??? It is good here but certainly not worth the highest rating possible -stick with the spicy pork buns $8 Êis pricey for an order of 2 but absolutely tasty w/ fluffy dough. Any of the ramen bowls will do the trick because they are good but certainly not deserving of the best in ny designation. The 2.5 hour wait was a bit much but there's a lot of fanfare surrounding the name. Personally, I think I can cook up a better bowl of ramen myself -apologies for the tough review guys but if you haven't had anything other than fang bian mien/fang mien/instant noodles then these noodles will rock your world. If experience is on your side, still go, if not to enjoy the ambiance

I'm not a ramen connoisseur but my date said he loved Japanese food. i realized later his 'love' was really just 'like a little sushi here and there'. so there's that. i picked this place after reading reviews on yelp as well as NY magazine. after a 45minute wait at the bar, two drinks (for myself), fried green peppers, one rude hostess and one very nice one...we were seated. the menu has appetizers, specialties, and ramen bowls. we didn't realize that specialties were meant to be eaten like appetizers... $12-$15 for an appetizer... oh okay... we opted for one appetizer (it was on special cant remember it) we didn't mean to get the same dish but there were so few vegetarian options. i wasn't expecting a lot but i was expecting more than one (given other reviews I'd read). my date isn't vegetarian but he doesn't eat pork. making him a vegetarian for the night. i liked my ramen, the broth was yummy as well as the tofu and the waiter was adorable and helpful. if you go, take someone familiar with the ordering style and food choices.

ÊWhile it is nice that they'll call your cell when your table is ready, it only makes it worse when they tell us to get there as fast as possible but upon our arrival its still a 45 minute wait.

first this a excellent ramen, but its not worth the hype - the reason its one star is that the only interest they have there is how quickly they could "turn the top" - i.e. how quickly they good get your seat free again - since i was eating with a friend and we were talking a lot (i.e. not wolfing down a mean) they asked so many times to start eating and if i was done i basically stopped my meal let them clear my plate - left me a very bad taste in my mouth that ruined any flavor that the meal had

What they do, they do well, perhaps better than any other Ramen eateries in the city, which is saying a lot. ÊI thoroughly enjoyed Akamaru Modern as well as the Shiromaru Hakata Classic.

During my first trip to NYC I visited this place twice...in a row!!! I had the original ramen with pork belly and the steamed pork buns the first time and I couldn't stop thinking about it so I came in the next day. ÊI waited an hour and a half for dinner but it was well worth it. For those who don't want to wait soo long for a table, consider going for lunch. It's just as good and they have an amazing lunch special. Not only is this the best ramen you'll ever have but you have to try the pork steamed buns. They will change your life. lol jk but they are really really really good!

The wait is kind of ridiculous, but the food is worthwhile. ÊThis is my second time here and I got the Akamaru Modern. ÊMy recommendation on turning awesome in to SUPER awesome = adding the soft boiled egg. ÊTheir fatty pork buns are insanely delicious - though, holy crap $$. ÊI forgot the type of salt that they use on their edamame & peppers... but I am pretty sure I could sprinkle it on top of anything & devour it.

the miso ramen was little of a disappointment. However, the Akamaru Modern was amazing. and you can spend $2 to add more noodles, which is great for big appetites.

Ippudo is my go-to place when I'm in the LES and want to eat at a place with decent ambiance, chill atmosphere and good comfort food. ÊI always get ramen here (my favorite so far is still the Miso Ramen) although I do wish that it tasted less fatty. ÊI suspect the pork fat is what makes this ramen taste so good, but I would prefer the broth to be on the lighter side. ÊThis place always has a long wait (40 mins-1.5 hour) so come early and get your party on the list! Have fun. :)

We went here on our trip to New York in February 2012 and came here on the friend's recommendation and this place is legit! We got there right before the dinner rush and grabbed a drink at the bar (2 for $6 Sapporo special) before being led to our communal benihana style table. Even though it was a shared table it didn't feel too crowded. They also had cool booths if you can snag one for your group but there were only two of us. We started with the pork buns and the raw octopus with wasabi. The pork buns were delicious and the bun so fluffy. The raw octopus was different but not my cup of tea, the boyfriend sure liked it though. We ordered two of the dark hot ramen's and the boyfriend added braised pork belly to his and that was worth the extra $4 alone. They give you a ridiculouly big spoon but the ramen was sooo good. For dessert we have green tea creme brulee which was okay. Bill came out to about $75 with tip.

I love Ippudo. Pork buns and Modern Ramen are the way to go. The handmade ramen are truly the best I have ever had. ÊIf the Karaka Kigashi Miso Ramen is ever on the menu you MUST order it! A rich, spicy, smokey broth made from charred miso topped with pork belly, hard boiled egg and spinach. It is the ultimate comfort food perfect for a cold NYC evening. Be prepared to wait! When your big bowl of steamy ramen arrives it will all be worth it!

This is my 2nd visit to Ippudo, I wanted to give 4 stars to the food but as a whole, 3 stars. Ê Got there shortly after they open for dinner on a weeknight, the 4 of us had to wait 15 minutes by the bar even when they have tables available. Ê We've ordered 2 teba gyoza tori as appetizer, that's 4 small chicken wings stuffed with gyoza fillings (20 bucks!), I had tori ramen with onsen tamago and kakuni. ÊThe pork belly was very tasty and noodles was good as well but everything was rush rush rush. Ê The restaurant is also very noisy, (non-Japanese) music was very loud, we had to shout at each other. Ê Service was not unfriendly but they rush you out, the second you put your chopsticks down they'll take away everything and slap you with the bill.

The ramen craze in NYC is about to be kicked up a notch with the opening of Ippudo. ÊThe famed Japanese chain has finally opened shop in the ramen-obsessed E. Village, much to the joy of people like me and my fellow ramen-crazed/ obsessed friend, Margie L., who hauled ass in a cab to meet me here for lunch in the middle of work (what a devoted ramen fan she is!). We both went with the Shiromaru Classic ramen ($13)... tonkotsu ramen in pork broth with steamed thin Berkshire pork slices (would've enjoyed a few more pieces of this!), cabbage, mushrooms, and scallions. ÊI chose a side dish, spicy cod roe over rice and seasoned pickles, for an additional $3. ÊA small bowl of seasoned rice with a dollop of roe... good but not sure I needed this. ÊMargie got the pork over rice side... which was a bit better than mine. So what is so special about the ramen here?? ÊWell, it's all about the amazing broth. ÊIt's a really nice, rich, but not oily / greasy, milky white broth that smells just heavenly. ÊYou better believe it that this thing has been simmering for 15+ hours! ÊThe taste... soothing, a nice simple flavor (though I'm sure it's not simple to make this!), not too salty, and even better with a bit of the freshly ground sesame seeds (thanks to J T for the tip about that!). ÊAs for the noodles... it's different than the usual chewy kind that I'm used to... Ippudo's noodles are thinner and lighter, but still chewy enough and delicious. ÊDue to this texture, the noodles didn't seem to soak up all the soup (as often is the case at other ramen spots). Ê Ê As for the decor, I was pleasantly surprised at how nice, modern, and clean the place is. ÊAlot of wood, a bit dark, and dare I say it... actually, kind of a sexy vibe, despite all the people slurping noodles and drinking broth from the big extra-wide ladle-like spoons. ÊThere are different areas to sit in, including communal tables / bars, booths, and a separate red room area in the back that supposedly can be rented out (ramen party, anyone??). ÊLoved the cool front wall decorated with various ramen bowls and the glass counter top of the bar showcasing uncooked ramen noodles. Ê The service was fast and quite friendly... they were all speaking Japanese to me, which was fine even though I didn't understand any of it, since this is all a positive indication that a good portion of the clientele is Japanese (or do I look Japanese?). Ê This place is dangerously too close (right across the street) from my office thus, I'm predicting frequent visits to Ippudo for lunch. ÊThat broth... absolutely perfect and crave worthy if you're feeling a bit hung over or under the weather... I know I'll be thinking about that for the rest of the day. ÊMy instant love and appreciation for this place is a bit scary... how could a bowl of ramen trigger such excitement?? ÊBut it's the magic of ramen... whether it's all those hours that the broth has been simmering for in pork bone, the perfectly chewy noodles, or the soothing first spoonful in my tummy, I could not have been happier with my ramen. ÊSorry Setagaya, Rai Rai Ken, Sapporo East, Men Kui Tei, etc... but I've found a new love and I think I'm addicted. =============================================== (UPDATE: 4/9/08) I went again last week to experience their full menu for dinner w/ my other Ippudo addicts. ÊThe wait was pretty damn long (6:30 on Thur)... but note that they seem to exaggerate the wait time. ÊAlot of folks were turning away, in shock, as they were told by the nice Japanese lady at the front that the wait is "about 2 hours". ÊWe were told it'd be an hour and a half but waited about 45 mins. Ê Started off the meal on a good note with a nice sake cocktail at the bar while waiting. ÊThis time, I sat at the counter, which allowed me to see the cooks in action on non-ramen items. ÊKind of fun... but a loud area to dine in since all the cooks yell out that Japanese welcome greeting whenever new patrons come in to the dining area (which is way too frequently). ÊBut you can't really pick & choose where you sit at this point given the popularity of the place. I was actually a bit disappointed with some of the items we tried... shrimp in garlic sauce w/ mushroom & asparagus, some special egg omelet dish (much too simple), and the matcha brulee green tea pudding was was just a tad better than average. ÊBut the Kakumi (braised pork belly) was excellent... really tender pork meat, rich in flavor, and very tasty. ÊThe tofu special was also great. I thought about bringing down my rating to 4 stars from 5... but no, I can't... the ramen is just too damn good. ÊAnd that's what they're known for. ÊI'm sticking to what Ippudo does best and is famed for... their awesome tonkotsu ramen, which is more than deserving of at least Ê5 stars!

Ramen shouldn't taste this good, but fortunately it does. But the real star of the meal was the pork buns. Wanted to cancel my order and just get 10 or 12 more of those. Knowing this place was famous for long lines gave me an excuse for early lunch. No line when we got there and stacked out the door by the time we left

Two complimentary perks of being unemployed are 1. friends footing your lunch bill and 2. getting to skirt the unsightly line at Ippudo by showing up at 2PM on a Wednesday afternoon. I was skeptical; $14-16 bucks is an unattractive sum to shell out for noodles and soup, no matter how kitchy the open kitchen. The quality spectrum for ramen just didn't seem that expansive. And when our steaming bowls arrived, I noticed that -true to Yelp reviews- they were scantily populated with noodles and graced with only one slice of pork. One bite, though, and doubts were instantly assuaged. The broth was otherworldly-rich, the noodles hit upon the perfect texture and consistency, and within that single pork slice was contained a small glimpse of heaven. Ippudo gets five stars, but that's a -qualified- five stars, gourmands. I was so glutted on that salt-rich, fatty broth, that I couldn't summon a savory appetite again until the next morning. Its taste lingered unpleasantly in my mouth for hours following. I think it's a meal that I could handle about once a year (if that) - but that's not to say it wasn't pretty freaking excellent.

The appetizers were better than the ramen. Appetizers: Great hirata pork buns. Soft bun with tender, well seasoned and marinated pork belly, lettuce and mayo...mmmmm. Bakuretsu Tofu. Excellent soft tofu with substance, pork and flavorful sauce. Ramen: Shiromaru Hakata Classic and Akamaru Modern ramen were good. The broth of the modern ramen was okay, but my wife really liked it. The broth of the classic brought me back to Japan. Wish I could say the same about the noodles. They may be hand made but they are definitely not like the ramen noodles in Japan. The noodles are thinner, white (bleached flour?) and are less hearty. Will visit again for the Hirata buns.

there's not much to add to this review that hasn't been stated in others. i have been enjoying Ippudo in the west and when it was discovered that they would open up the chain in NYC... of course i was ecstatic. it was more than a year ago when i gathered up a group of my closest friends and waited outside of Ippudo for almost TWO hours in the freezing cold. we complained and moaned about the wait, but indeed- we had over 10 people in our party. what did we expect? after what seemed like an eternity... we were called. once inside Ippudo- we ordered and served promptly. the server was very swift and everything we requested wasn't missed. i didn't think NYC would ever have a great ramen chain to cater to snooty eaters like myself. but, it happened. i was pleased. if you've been wondering about this place... it's well worth the wait and praise it gets from blogs and critics. just make sure you're not starving while deciding to come here. grab a snack and bring your iPod. haha

three words: Êhigh maintenance buttaface. dont let the ambiance and authentic air fool you. Êyou'll swoon over the curtained booths and overhead beams with twinkle lights, but some things just arent as pretty as they seem. Êwell ok, maybe they are, but they definitely dont taste as good. i anticipated this ultimate bowl of ramen for a couple years- yes, years - and finally, i had a chance to share japan's soul food with a few friends. i ordered the special pork/chicken, poker geniuspro had the soy sauce broth, chef one had the miso and almostchef had the classic pork base. Êsalty, oily, overcooked and overpriced. Êmy expectations exceeded my reality and i reached for my water more than my kitschy soup spoon. Êwith an open mind, i visited my neighboring bowls hoping to taste redemption, but redemption wasn't home. the pork buns. Êok. Êthe pillowy peking duck-esque bun and slow-cooked pork were tasty - even with the unsightly squirt of japanese mayo. Êhowever, i would probably need to sell a kidney if i wanted to ever eat another one again. Êin my opinion, mei li wah in chinatown has incredible pork buns for a percentage point of the cost, you don't have to eat 4 to be full and you get to keep all your organs. in short, japans soul food just took a piece of mine. and my monies.

4.5 stars. really torn between the round up and the round down, the reason i gave the round up was it is a more stylish restaurant experience than the other 4star ramen places i've reviewed. I got there alone and early about 6:30 (i had an 8 o'clock event to attend a few blocks away) so the line was just starting to build up. Because i was alone there was almost no wait at all, less than 10 minutes. SCORE! design-wise the place is fantastic. this is not your average ramen joint. very nicely styled, dark without being oppressive, light wood everywhere, tables nicely spaced across the space, pools of light everywhere, a thousand little design touches that all work well together, without ever feeling cluttered. the kitchen is open to view and lines 2 walls, and the shouts of the chefs and servers enhance the welcome feel. I had shishito peppers as an appetizer, which were very simple, served with a wedge of lemon and a small bowl of salt for dipping. These peppers are ever so slightly more bitter and spicy than bell peppers with one or two with a bit more heat to them. The waitress recommended a good sake that went well with them. I ordered the akamaru ramen. a very elegant subtle soup, rich but not fatty or overpowering. next time i would probably add some of the optional mustard greens and/or bamboo shoots. the noodles had a very good bite and mouth feel, but i think they were actually a bit too delicate and thin. i get the why, but i would have liked a slightly more substantial noodle. as it was i added a 2nd ball of ramen halfway through.... but i think with the greens and shoots added i might not have.... had a different, also excellent sake after. still having time to kill, as well as enjoying the space, and the food, and the writing i was doing, i ordered a matcha creme brulee and cup of green tea to finish up the meal. cheap? no, not for ramen. but seriously a top top top ramen shop (by the way - i did see someone on line make a rez for 2 hours later while i waited, so there are some sort of reservations possible)

(I am sushi man. ÊI review sushi. ÊToday I review ramen.) Ramen is not my specialty, but here goes. 1. atmosphere is very similar to modern trendy Japanese izakaya / restaurant, only with louder music. ÊAlso Ippudo's staff yell the "irrashaimase," which is more typical of a Japanese place that is not trying to be modern/trendy. ÊBut overall it's a close approximation. 2. staff: unclear how many are Japanese, but many are white (ramen chefs) or other asian (waiters, front of house), and of course dishwashers etc. are Mexicans. Ê This is actually fine: the white ramen chef dudes look quite serious (good for ramen chef), and my waiter was super genki and good at his job (he even kneeled down to take an order! Êeven Japanese waiters rarely do that outside Japan). Ê(also there are two or three hot girls and guys working here. Êgood.) ÊThis is not complicated or especially Japanese food, so you don't really need Japanese waiter. 3. decor is sort of "western fascination with Japanese stuff" style. ÊOne wall is covered with hiragana -- only it has no meaning as far as I could tell. ÊJust pretty hiragana. ÊBut it looks good and was clearly expensive. Ê 4. SHUT UP ALREADY, HOW WAS THE RAMEN? ÊI was shocked: it was actually worth $14. Ê"shiromaru classic" was extremely porky, and contained really big chunks of pork (and half an egg and typical ramen trimmings). ÊThe noodles here are thinner/lighter than typical ramen. ÊBut one bowl of this stuff is super intense and filling. 5. seating: communal tables, packed pretty tight; booths to the side. ÊCommunal seating is a barbaric practice seen rarely outside new york, but I was somehow able to enjoy my ramen in peace. Ê(I know how: polite neighbors. ÊThat's rare, and this place can attract douches.) Ê 6. which brings me to next point: this is NOT a ramen shop experience. ÊThis is an izakaya/restaurant experience involving ramen. ÊAt a ramen shop you sit at the bar, it's pretty quiet, you are really close to chef, and you just eat ramen. ÊThis ramen is serious enough for ramen shop, but the experience is totally different. 7. price. ÊJust one bowl of ramen -- nothing else -- is $18 with tax and tip. ÊI could get the same seriously good ramen in Tokyo for $11, maybe less. ÊBut hey, here you get a huge restaurant with expensive decor, genki staff, and new york people watching. ÊIt's actually a reasonable price. conclusion: to my surprise, I'd go again!

you know, i thought i would poo in my pants from how good the ramen is by reading the reviews and looking at pictures.. but i was just not impressed. my bf and i ordered the shiromaru something.. i had the akamaru modern. the broths were very hearty and flavorful, his a tad bit more oily than we both like, but the noodles were not my favorite. in the bar area upstairs, the bar table is filled with dried ramen noodles (the kind in instant ramen) but those noodles were not used, rather some thicker noodle, it just didn't go with the broth. after i was done, i felt soo heavy and full, but not so satisfied. maybe cause i'm asian, but i wish they served oshinko (japanese pickled radish) to compliment the salty ramen. all in all, it was okay. i love ramen, but i have had better /:

I Saw Ippudo on the Food Network"s the best thing I ever ate and The noodles looked so good I had to go! I live about an hour and a half from the city, and it was worth every drop of gas. I had the Akamaru Modern Ramen which is a hearty porky silky broth with noodles and pork belly. It was to die for. My boyfriend had the soy flavered ramen which was excellent as well. I highly recomend getting as many add in as u like to your soup... everything they make is awesome. You cannot take anything home however, so plan on leaving absolutely bloated. It is too good to leave for the dishwasher. The dining room can get a little noisy, but once your soup comes, the steam sucks you in, and all else is irrelevant.

A solid 5-stars for successfully pulling off a total package of sultry decor, professional staff, beautifully presented food, and bringing out the poshness in everyone that dines here. Ê$13 for a bowl of ramen is certainly pricey, but when considered within the confines of the entire dining experience, it's just about right. Ê I gasped when we were seated at one of the communal tables; we were a party of 2, and the cushy square chairs with side panels forming a right angle had the potential to be pushed together into a love seat. ÊThis subtle detail immediately created a more intimate feeling - there was no sense of being packed in like at other ramen joints, and the design cornucopia created a stylish backdrop that made everyone look like movie stars. Onto the food: Kakuni - 2 LARGE pieces of braised pork belly that rested on a delicate wasabi sauce, with several pieces of daikon radish. ÊEach bite of meat melted like butter, and the subtle sauce was the puuuurfect compliment. The artistic French-style presentation of the dish rounded out the well-deserved $9 price tag. Shiromaru ramen - another flavor orgasm! The tonkatsu broth is usually my standard in measuring ramen, and there is no substitute for the many hours it takes to achieve this level of depth in the savory soup. Likewise, there is no substitute for fresh noodles probably made in-house. ÊThe 2 pieces of pork were tender, and an adequate smattering cabbage and mushroom complemented without overshadowing the purity of the noodles and broth. Akamaru ramen - a spicy punch to the shiromaru, very good if you're in a saltier mood and have already appreciated the delicate flavors in the tonkatsu broth that the spice masks. The portions were satisfying, and the Kagiya sake was excellent. The journey down the stairs to the bathroom revealed a dark, solidly painted corridor with a slim horizontal panel of glass that allowed a peak into a large room where you could see the vats of broth simmering. ÊTurn the corner, and another smaller panel exposed a small room with a lone man churning out the *gasp* fresh noodles that WERE made in-house! ÊSuspicion confirmed. Absolutely fantastic.

Joining a league of thousands...I am adding my review to the sea of others to add to the hype that is Ippudo. We arrived early (for brunch standards) and only had to wait about 15-20 mns and even had some bench space. ÊWe did have to share our table (communal) but that's ok. ÊIt's large/wide enough to accomodate several parties at once. ÊThe only thing is you end up next to those with you and not across from them. ÊSo unless you're going w. a large group, be ready to share space. *Yamitsuki Goma Kyuri (Japanese cucumber mixed with sesami oil dressing): this we got from seeing a high recommendation on a friend's yelp. ÊWow. ÊThis was amazingly good and wondrously addicting. ÊI mean how do they keep the cucumber so crisp? ÊHow is the sauce so light yet packs such flavor? ÊHow do I recreate this delicious and yet so simple dish?? ÊAfter we finished I wished we had ordered 2 or 3. ÊNext time... *Hirata Buns (Steamed buns filled w. pork and served w. Ippudo original spicy buns sauce): this was on recommendation of a ton of other yelps we read. ÊAnd despite the small portion....This was VERY tasty. ÊThe buns are fluffy and are a perfect way to hold all this together. ÊThe pork just melts in your mouth and has a nice rich flavor. ÊWhen you're starving, just having 2 to share amongst 3 doensnt seem like enough... *Shiromaru Hakata Classic Ramen: classic bowl with all the fixing. ÊFresh delicious al dente noodles, a rich body-warming broth and tender juicy pork. *Akamaru Modern Ramen: the addition of the Ippudo special sauce and the fragrant garlic oil elevates this ramen bowl to a whole new level. ÊVery good, although wish it was bigger... *Shoyu Ramen: soy sauce flavored ramen w. all the fixings. ÊFiance found this delicious but also wiched it was bigger. This was a great experience. ÊService is very friendly and the decor is modern with splashes of traditional. ÊThe only drawback is the wait if you want to eat later than Noon on a weekend and the prices. ÊNot a lot higher than other ramen spots but considering portion size...it's higher. ÊOtherwise...Great spot!

this is where you go for swanky ambiance and souped up ramen. you'll pay about $10 for a bowl. i get the appeal, and it's pretty good, but you can make this at home! it's way too complicated to get in here. my friend had to show up at 3 to put down our name and be on call to get us a table at like 8pm. it's an intense process that must be learned. the special for the day was the peanut flavored broth and most of the feedback at the table was good. I had soy sauce based one and it was salty, but i should've anticipated that. for appetizer someone ordered these super delicious steamed pork belly buns, highly recommended. but honestly, too big of an ordeal to attempt again.

I have mixed feeling about ippudo. First of all ramen is supposed to be a low budget, quick eating type of food. My Japanese friends would be shocked to hear that I went out for ramen for dinner and even more so that I waited over an hour to eat it. But I love ramen so I had to eat here. That being said, the ramen was awesome. I had the akamaru modern ramen. The broth was the key. It had this creamy garlicky taste that makes it unique. The noodles itself were on par. The pork chasu was great. Nice portion, tasty, fatty...mmmm! I also had the pork bun and I agree with the other reviews that they are pretty fantastic too. They treat their pork well there! I've been to both totto and ippudo. Totally different places. The atmosphere in ippudo is more upscale and trendy. It was 15 bucks for the ramen which is dang expensive for a bowl of noodles. I would go back again, but it's not somewhere I would be going to every week. So my rating is solely based on the food. If I took account the price and wait it would be 3 stars.

It's probably not fair to say it was a waste of time to dine at ippudo, but I am not a big fan of this place. Super long waiting time (1+ hours without reservation) that set my expectation high, but their noodle turned out not that spectacular. To me the broth was a bit too strong in flavor, and the noodle was a bit overcooked. A bit pricey for this kind of food (ramen). I liked some of their appetizers but it was the noodle that i went for and turned out disappointing.The chicken wings were also just okay. ÊThey have yebisu beer which is a plus to me. Overall Êthis place from my own experience is not up to the hype. i have had better ramen at lower price, without having to wait so long. ÊThe "famous" pork bun turned out just so so, and it tasted like they added a lot of mayo or other similar kind of western dressing....... I didn't like it, but many others must have really enjoyed it? ÊI have had better pork buns at MANY places. ÊOh I would have liked their inner decoration more if I had not waited so long by the time I was seated.

Yes, you are right! It's my very first 5 stars! And it really deserves it! The ramen is the best I have ever tried in my life. A good bowl of ramen needs good homemade noodles; soup base that made of chicken, pork bones, fish bones, seaweed, carefully seasoned with natural sea salt. If there is one better than the other, it's not good already! So for a bowl of ramen that can compare to those in Japan, it's really good. BUT, something you need to know before you go: NEVER go there when you are hungry in 2 to 2 1/2 hours because it's the average waiting time. Never order anything else except ramen because they are only worth 2.5 stars but charging 5 stars' price. Never order extra noodles because when the soup is not hot, noodles won't taste as good as it was. Don't expect good chasiu (bbq pork)! They are a lame! And beside you may find some hot girls/ guys (depends) around when you are waiting for the table and you might find a date after chatting for 2 to 3 hours! (who knows!) ....and let me know if you like it hot! I meant ramen! Recommend to get the simplest ramen, so you can taste the real favor inside the soup and noodles! and enjoy!!!!

I must have gone when it was a full moon . Firstly, the hostess was pretty rude . It was super crowd too, but I didn't really care about that part . The food was not to die for . It was average in my opinion . What really made me dislike the restaurant was how the waitress tried to rip off my friends and I . She had told us that we had to put down at least 15% gratitude(since it's the POLICY) . We only gave about 12% since we did not like the service . When we counted our change to recalculate and we noticed that $5 was missing . I am 100% sure that we did not under 12% and that someone took $5 . Maybe I went on a wrong day but I am never coming here again .

Ippudo has the triple crown of great food, great price, and great surroundings (hip but not to the point of trying too hard). Why not 5 stars? I guess if I have to nitpick, the fact that they don't take reservations is a bummer; we arrived at 7pm on a Thursday night and, even though we were a party of 2, we waited for a good hour -- twenty minutes longer than the hostess had estimated. They have a good happy hour deal on drinks at the bar though -- 2 tap beers (sapporo or kirin) for $6. (Buy one, get one free). Service was pretty prompt, the ramen was totally slurpable, and the pork bun is the best I've ever had. I will definitely be back.

The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because whenever I eat there I have to wait at LEAST one hour! Even if it's on a Tuesday at 3pm, there is STILL a loooong wait. BUT if you have patience it is definitely the best ramen you will ever have.

Authentic Japanese ramen in NYC! the main attraction is the ramen noodles with many varieties to choose from, but the appetizers on the menus is not to be missed out. Tuna tataki is amazing, I want to sneak in to the kitchen and steal their sauce's recipe! The mini pork buns melt in your mouth yummy (kind of reminds me of Peking duck wraps but with tender braise pork) Best wrap up: out of this world green tea.

Why does the kitchen have to close from 3:30-5PM? I was in the area and decided to drop by for an late lunch/early dinner but it was closed so I was so disappointed. I thought that since I was there at 4PM, I'd be able to avoid the perpetual long line but I guess I just don't come here enough to know their hours. The menu is very limited but their noodles are quite good. This is definitely one of my favorite places for ramen. I always order more noodles because there's never enough! I always want more! My other favorite place for ramen is Menchanko Tei.

Tried the famous Akamaru Modern Ramen ($16) and wondered what's so good about it. I usually eat at Terakawa Ramen at Lexington and their ramen is only $10 but definitely a lot tastier and flavorful. In my opinion, Ippudo is highly overrated and expensive just like its counterpart, Momofoku. The pork buns are really good but still too expensive for the size and quantity. To be objective though, the ambiance and service were both good. So if you are looking for a trendy, modern, good service, pricey restaurant with average tasting ramen and small but good appetizers, Ippudo is for you.

Love the soup here but it's totally stupid/annoying they don't let you take home what you ordered if you didn't finish it. I understand no take-out because it's so popular, BUT if I only ate half of my soup and want to take it home with me, please don't tell me the logistics of how ramen gets soggy and cold and the chef strictly prohibits eating it elsewhere. After all, any food you take home with you for later won't taste as great as it does in the restaurant, however, it's silly to make it such a science. If people love the soup, wait for 45 minutes to get it, and cannot finish the large portions, then you should allow them to "risk" eating cold, soggy ramen noodles at home later... because it's New York after all.

I dont understand all these review about Ippudo being a great ramen place. Ê Ive had my fair share of ramen and this just doesnt cut it as anything special. ÊIve been here 3 times and each time, I am less and less impressed. ÊThe thing about eating in NY is that there is so much hype surrounding the opening of these places. ÊI was expecting something heaven sent, and it's just not that good. Ê They have several types of broth. ÊIve had three. ÊHakata classic, Akamaru (or something like that) and the Karaka. Ê The hakata ramen at Menchanko-Tei is a lot better than this place. ÊI had the Karaka with spicy yesterday. ÊIt was too spicy actually and was a bit difficult to eat. ÊI think a bowl of ramen there at Ippudo is $13. ÊThis doesnt include an egg or anything really. ÊIt is kinda dissapointing. ÊA bowl of noodles with Êsome broth and scallions should not cost what they are charging. ÊI know their dining room is fabulous and pretty and etc. ÊBut I dont really feel the need to pay for such cheap excess glamour. ÊI think the owners of this place did a big disservice to their customers by spending so much decorating this place. ÊRamen is ramen. ÊIt should be delicious, filling, and cheap. ÊThat is how it is made in Japan and they should replicate that model here. Ê Also, the quality of the actual noodles is lacking. ÊThe noodles are thin and become so soggy after sitting in the broth for a couple of minutes. ÊThere is no good inherent flavor. ÊImagine eating cheap overcooked angel hair pasta. ÊDo you enjoy that? ÊNo, you dont. Ê Try Minca, Menkui-tei, Setagaya, Menchanko-tei and compare to Ippudo. ÊI think each and every time you will find these restaurants are much better in taste and value. ÊMinca happens to be my all time favorite. Ê I really want to tell everyone reading this, please do not go to Ippudo. ÊIt does such a disservice to ramen, I really hope the place goes out of business.

Pork Buns- a must! Akamaru Modern- a must! I have nothing bad about to say about Ippudo... my advice is try to go early at the lunch rush to avoid waiting; however, waiting anything under 40 minutes is completely and totally worth it.

I already know there have been a bizillion reviews on Ippudo, but here's one more. ÊThe place is gooooood- beats Momofuku Ramen (well, different). ÊAnd worth the wait-- there is tons to do in the area while waiting ! ÊIf you put your name down around 6, it's 1.5 hours- which I guess is on the low end. ÊTruthfully, I don't know if I'd wait 2.5-3 hours. Ê Overall, ÊI felt my experience was pretty Japanese- former Yelpers are certainly right about them shouting welcome and greetings to you when you walk in. ÊWhich was...endearing (what I thought when I sat down), while enduring it- I don't know, I thought it was kind of embarrassing. Ê Most people spoke Japanese but overall I got that hipster/E. Village vibe-- which fits in with Japanese street culture I suppose (as of late). The place looks so tiny from outside, and once you walk in, you can't help but absorb the BEAUTIFUL, rather big space. ÊI like that it's an open kitchen so that you can see how everything is so freshly prepared. ÊThere is a big ass tree in the middle, and lots of awesome booths on the side for bigger parties. ÊI think the space is hip enough for a good birthday party-- though I suspect that you wouldn't really be ordering ramen (without elbowing your partners left and right or slurping loudly in front of your friend/friend of friend who you think is hottt). ÊThere is tons of nice apps to share though, so no worries. ÊAmong them, I would have liked to try: the hirata wings (looked delish, looked like BonChon), Êthe grilled octopus-- we DID try the buns (of course). ÊI have to say- these were better at Momofuku. ÊI've had them at Momo's - both the pork and chicken. ÊI thought the chicken kicked ass there, and that the pork was TOO fatty. ÊHere, the pork and chicken were fine-- but I don't know. There wasn't enough red sauce maybe, because the entire bun felt separate. ÊIt didn't flow-- there was no flavor. ÊOr not as much. ÊBut the buns were nicely gooey :). Onto the main event-- I had the Akamaru Modern (the ONLY time I will eat pork, in ramen! HAHA coincidentally a fancy NYC Ramen joint) ÊMmm, mmm, mmm. ÊPros: awesome al dente noodles, great fresh veggies, perfect blend of garlic oil (yes you can taste it!) and that special miso red paste (it makes this ramen dish !). ÊCons: Êone slice of pork? Really? Ew. Ê(albeit, it was pretty darm good-- tender and pulled apart nicely. ÊThere also wasn't a nauseating amount of fat) , and SERIOUS MSG toward the bottom-- IT GOT WAYYYYYYYY SALTY. And unhealthy- bagh. My friend had the special ramen (?)- it came with slices of duck and chicken. ÊI had her duck- it was dry. ÊThe Akarmaru is better- and that's what most people would say- so I've read. ÊI wasn't going to diverge from the beaten path being a virgin to Ippudo. Lastly, the dessert. ÊMmmm- they ALL looked good. ÊThese definitely beat Momo's desserts-- in fact, I think they serve a whole star just to themselves. ÊThere was so much variety and I doubt whatever I got would have been bad. ÊWe were toying between the soft tofu, the green tea number with mascarpone Êcheese (which we did get upon our server's recs) and the creme brulee. ÊIf you get the green tea item, you won't regret it!!! ÊIt's the perfect combination of green tea, dark chocolate shavings, mascarpone , with a faint layer of buttery crust on the bottom. ÊMan, I could have eaten that thing myself. Until you try this, you have NO idea how well mascarpone goes with green tea. ÊWho would have thought?!?! All in all, if you get those 3 things-- you'll be set. ÊAnd the damage wasn't too bad, about $26 a person. GO IPPUDO and WAIT. ÊI wouldn't make this a daily habit (as I WOULD toggle between here and Momofuku's- but it's def. a good way to treat yourself to a great dinner)

Oh-em-gee. Fine-a-lee. I had dinner at Ippudo! Every time I have come here to eat the line is ridiculous for a foodie sans patience such as I. My friend suggested we meet at 6pm to ensure timely seating and she was right! The three of us experienced the Japanese dining experience and came away only wanting more, more ramen! I ordered the "secret vegetarian option" (which I had called about to ensure actual existence as opposed to rumor). It was so yummy! I love ramen in general but I am no longer sure I can have it anywhere else but here. There was tofu and tiny mushrooms, loads of seaweed, scallions and a hint of washabi. The waitstaff was friendly and attentive - constantly filled our water glasses and kindly brought me a clean pair of chopsticks when I (inevitably) knocked mine on the floor. My friends got something equally delicious with a side of pork belly and couldn't rave about their dish enough. Oh, and I almost forgot the pork buns they ordered to start which looked like art and smelled like food heaven. It seems everyone around us was equally content (can't you just TELL when neighboring eaters are discontent) so my suggestion is to order the pork buns if you are into that sort of thing, and then any ramen and GET THERE EARLY. Is it bad that I am already planning my next trip there...

3+ stars. The buns are outstanding, both the pork buns and the fish buns on special. Completely competitive with Momofuku, but for $1 more I'd have to give MMFK the nod for cucumber that's a bit more interesting than Ippudo's lettuce. As for the ramen, I'm on the fence although I have to admit I'm naive about the whole thing. As a Chinese American, I believe that fundamentally broth should be simple--not too many ingredients and flavor coming from bones rather than spices. Ippudo's ramen, on the other hand, comes in a rich broth full of floaters too numerous to name. Tasty to be sure, but a bit salty and thick for my preference. In fact, I've also tried the wasabi ramen on special and found it too salty to even finish. They redeemed themselves with the classic ramen, which I definitely enjoyed, but only with a "but" left in my head. I'm a fan of most foods Japanese, love udon and soba, and I know Ippudo's a chain from Japan, so maybe I just don't get it. Again I compare to MMFK Noodle Bar, whose ramen was a model of simplicity. A clear broth, two gorgeous hunks of pork, some meaty noodles, and complete fulfilment. Don't need nothing more. My friend R said it best. He likes his broth to contain about two veggie-like things visibly floating around (e.g. cilantro and scallions) and one protein. It's okay to have other ingredients, but you shouldn't see them. Again, I feel like I'm biased somehow. But I've had Pho that's knocked my socks off, Korean soups that seemed to contain nothing but water and bones brewed for days but yet left me fully satisfied, and of course Chinese soups where you could suck on the bones alone and live a happy life. All of these for about $5. Yes, of course these places don't have the fine ingredients, but so what? Isn't broth is about extracting the last bit of sustenance from what's left over from yesterday's dinner? Frankly, I'm not sure how or whether I'd want to spend the $13 on, as far as ingredients go. So maybe it's not Ippudo, it's me. Hmmph. I want to like the place, I like the feel of it and the energy. It kind of rocks out. The buns warrant five stars. The ramen only three, in my book. Call it three and a quarter over all. Maybe I just don't get it.

I had been this restaurant in Japan and the way they look in Japan is way more simpler. I order the 1st soup on the menu; it was $13 dollars. In Japan they charge around $10 dollars. But this noodles house can sit a lot of people. When you have a group of ten people. Most likely you might be able to sit in 1 big table together. But I saw most of the 2 people who came in to dine in. They ending up sitting into a big table and share with stranger. If you are looking for a place to sit and chat. I wouldn't recommending this restaurant. Over all their ramen soup; I would really say is the best I had ever had. They also do fried chicken; I like the sauce that they served with it. And I also loved their mentigo on rice. Yummy. I sure will go back to this place as much as I can. But I will try to go sometime that is not as packed as Saturday night.

I first noticed this place in 2008 when I went to get an ice cream cake for my husband for his 30th birthday in the area. ÊI saw a huge line outside and wondered what the restaurant was so as soon as I got back home I went on yelp and looked it up. ÊAfter reading the reviews and seeing the line I was convinced it was good. ÊShowed a couple of friends the place and tried to convince them to go with me but they backed out a couple of times then went without me! Ê*humpfh! ÊThey got back and kept raving about it. ÊThen Morimoto came out and declared this place the best ramen in NY and I was really convinced I needed to try this place. ÊI had a lot of failed attempts at going but finally we committed to coming here for dinner and I'm glad we did. Ê We went on a Saturday night during prime dinner time and was told the wait was 1 hour and 15 minutes. ÊNot a big deal since we were expecting it and already decided that no matter how long the wait, we were going to eat at Ippudo. ÊSo we walked to Barnes & Noble and read some mags to kill time and came back just in time to be seated. ÊYou can even call Êafter you put your name down and when it's closer to the time they gave you to see how much longer you have and the hostess will tell you when you should come back. ÊAs we entered the main dining room, we were greeted by all the waiters in Japanese and seated at a community table in front of a mirror. ÊIt was weird to see ourselves staring back at us. ÊIppudo definitely has space for large parties. ÊMost of their tables in the dinning room fit parties of up to 10. Ê We ordered the hirata buns with pork (2 for $8). ÊThese buns were so yummie! ÊThe pork with mayo and lettuce in the bun were perfect compliments to each other. ÊI ordered the Akamaru Modern ramen while my husband ordered the Shiromaru Hakata Classic, both with pork belly as toppings. My Akamaru ramen was really flavorful but after eating it for a bit, I felt like the taste was very dark. ÊI liked it but had to eat it slowly so I wouldn't upset my stomach. ÊThe Shiromaru that my husband ordered was a lot lighter and the soup tasted more traditional. ÊI think I'll be ordering that next time. ÊWe both loved the pork belly. ÊIt really made the ramen awesome. ÊI read on the menu that if you don't finish all of your soup, you can ask for a second helping of ramen noodles for $2 more. ÊMy husband definitely did that and he was certainly full after his second helping of ramen. For dessert, we asked the waitress to recommend something and she recommended the Annin Tofu. ÊIt tasted just like a pina colada and was really refreshing after all the hot soup and ramen. ÊThe total before tax was about $57 for 2 people. Ê One note about the bathrooms. ÊThey're downstairs to the right of the hostess when you first walk in. ÊThere are two bathrooms for women and one for the men. ÊThis is probably the only place I've been to where the men actually had to wait for the bathroom vs the women. Ê:) ÊBathrooms are clean & very nice.

My NYC foodie friends recommended that I have lunch here and I'm glad I did. ÊI sat at the counter and had the highly recommended pork buns and modern ramen bowl. ÊFood was fantastic, my waitress was attentive & helpful and the atmosphere was so much fun. ÊI love how they yell out the orders in Japanese (even the non-Japanese workers do this).

omfg. Êwow. Ênow i understand the hype! So, usually there is like a 2 hour wait to get in at this little place. Êhowever, if you go at 6PM on a Wednesday, you will only have to wait 10-20 minutes (hoorah!). My friend and I were promptly seated at the bar area near the kitchen, and got a huge welcome (something in Japanese, not sure what). ÊWe ordered a bottle of sake (the milky creamy one - $43 a bottle). ÊWe split an order of the pork buns. ÊWOW. ÊAmazing. ÊDifferent from those I've had before at Momofuku. ÊThere was some kind of spicy mayo on the pork bun. ÊSO.DELISH! I ordered the Modern ramen (2nd one on the menu) with pork belly. ÊOMFG. ÊBEST.RAMEN.EVER. ÊBEST! My friend ordered the spicy one (last one on the menu). ÊThis was also good - but too spicy for me. Ê Service was also stellar. ÊMy water glass was only 50% full and it was refilled. ÊMy sake glass was like 50% full and it was refilled. ÊI dropped my napkin and our waitress brought me another one before it hit the ground. ÊGreat. Ê I'll be back for MORE!

I never thought I'd see the day when I would admit there was bowl of ramen better than the one at Momofuku. Ok forget Momofuku's ramen. Come here and brave the hour-long waits / get drunk at their bar area and eat their red bowl. No seriously. Don't be stupid and order the Miso Ramen or their Original Ramen. Just skip all that other stuff and order the red bowl. You and everyone at your table will be silent for about 10 minutes while major face stuffage goes on.

Ippudo is the trendiest little ramen joint in town. I used to think that I had to go to a homey hole-in-the-wall ramen place to get authentic ramen but Ippudo proves that ramen can be trendy AND delicious. But be prepared to wait for a table because they don't take reservations and Ippudo is pop-u-lar (duh, 1400+ reviews?!). Appetizers... ...hirata buns with pork - OMG so delicious! I think this may be my favorite thing at Ippudo. The pork was tender with the perfect amount of fat and the (mildly) spicy sauce is heavenly. ...hotate ponzu scallops - These bite size morsels were delicious. I really enjoyed the fresh jalepeno pepper slice with the scallop. ...duck with balsamic sauce - Pretty tasty but I think the hirata buns and scallops are better appetizer options. Ippudo has 5 kinds of ramen to choose from here, plus a daily special ramen... ...shiromaru hakata classic ramen - First of all, I LOVE tonkotsu soup and any ramen place that offers tonkotsu soup based ramen has already gotten on my good side. The classic didn't disappoint~ the noodles were toothy, the pork slices were well seasoned and fatty, the bamboo shoots were crunchy, the seasoned egg soaked in the soup was softened just right, and the sesame seeds added the perfect finishing touches. ...akamaru modern ramen - They add a fragrant garlic oil sauce to the tonkotsu soup that gives the whole bowl of ramen a really smoky, heavy flavor. This is good if you want to try a less traditional ramen. ...tan tan ramen - The shiromaru hakata classic is my ramen of choice at Ippudo, but when the special ramen of the day is the the tan tan ramen, I always get it because it's Ippudo's spicy ramen. Though it's not extremely spicy, I really like the thin ramen noodle and the addition of the cilantro and peanut flavor. Overall, I really like the ramen at Ippudo and they definitely know their pork. My only minor complaint with their ramen is that the soup is a little too salty and heavy to drink after finishing the noodles. Since it's such a heavy meal, I think it's really thoughtful of them to give a complimentary cup of hot tea at the end of the meal. While Ippudo isn't my absolute favorite ramen place in NYC (I prefer Minca), I love bringing friends who are visiting NYC and have never been to Ippudo.

At the end of the day, it's ramen, and your paying $15-$20 for a bowl when there are starving kids in Africa. ÊIt's good - the pork fat in the broth is evenly broken up, the broth is thick, and I liked the noodles, but this place is way pricey for filler and they nickle and dime you for add-ons and appetizers that are not that great. ÊI'd love to see their profit margins. ÊMomofuku still much better - leave this one to the Japanese Tourists.

We went there on a Friday night. Knowing that the wait is usually quite long we only got there at 11:30pm but still had to wait for another 20 minutes. Anyway, its definitely worth the wait.

Delicious broth and nice, chewy noodles with good flavor. My only gripe is that you only get two pieces of pork belly with your noodles... unless you want to fork over extra on top of the $13 per bowl for more meat. I feel like ramen should be a quick cheap meal that you should be able to pop in for anytime... but the popularity of Japanese noodle places in NY makes it a pricey ordeal with a 1+ hour wait.

I'll start by saying that my experience with ramen is limited (this is the second ramen restaurant that I've been to). Even with my limited experience ramen is still one of my all time favorite dishes. I saw the glowing reviews on here and decided to recommend this place to my family when we were in town. It was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. We started with the harita buns, which had an interesting texture. The bun was very simplistic tasting while the pork was tangy and flavorful. The meat was also very tender and juicy. The ramen itself was outstanding. i ordered the Akamaru modern, which if you don't know, is a tonkotsu style ramen. It was the most dynamic tasting dish that I've ever had. The flavor had several different components which were each distinguishable in one taste. The pork was delicious. The noodles were just the right consistency needed to bring out how good they tasted. So the broth was absolutely amazing and so were the noodles. I added an egg in there which mixed with the soup wonderfully. You can't really go wrong when ordering this. Also, a little added bonus, the place plays nice music and the atmosphere is pretty neat. I don't plan on giving many fives star reviews on Yelp, but this place definitely earned it. Definitely plan on coming back next time I'm in NYC.

If you are looking for a fantastic ramen noodle bar search no farther. This place will not disappoint. The atmosphere is alive and animated -- sit and the bar and watch the magic. Go with the Modern noodles if it's your first time. Don't skip the pork buns as a starter.

I am completely obsessed with Ippudo. 100% over the top obsessed. Three reasons for my obsession in order: incredible pork buns, 2 for 1 Kirin special at the bar during weekday evenings, best ramen in the city. Ippudo is a well known chain in Japan, whose main game is ramen noodles. This is the restaurant's first location to open outside of the homeland, and judging by the 45 minute wait every time I go there (day or night), they are doing quite well. Ippudo does not take reservations, and there is almost always room at the bar to squeeze two bodies up to the counter and start sucking down Kirins while you wait. Though the front bar area is fairly humdrum, you will be surprised by the relatively large and slick space that is the dining room, which stands out in comparison to the minimalist Momofukus and the bare bones feel to the other East Village ramen joints. This place has a great, fun vibe (chefs in pajamas constantly yelling to the wait staff in Japanese), and the waiters are always polite and attentive. full review and more at http://www.immaculateinfÉ - let me know what you think!

I now have established that I don't like ramen. ÊTo be fair, the ramen I had here was the best of all other places I tried in NYC!.

Loved the setup & decor - reminded me of Katsuya in Hollywood. There's only 1 location in the US and the ramen is hand made fresh everyday. You can actually go downstairs and take a peek into the kitchen! I ordered the Modern bowl and literally finished the entire thing in 15 minutes. Yes, it was THAT good! Caution - the spicy ramen will set your mouth on fire! Make sure you can handle the heat before ordering this bowl. Even so, both kinds of ramen were delicious! Making this a "must go" spot every time I'm in NY.

I had the Akamaru modern. ÊThe broth seemed too fatty. ÊThe chasu inside was bland. ÊThe noodles were cooked perfectly though. This was definitely not worth the 1.5 hour wait. I would like to try momofuku noodle or some other ramen places in NYC to offer a valid comparison, though. So far, my favorite ramen joint is Daikokyu in LA, so GO THERE if you're ever in the area!!!

I definitely love Ippudo but it does not compare to that of ramen place in Japan. ÊWhen craving ramen, Ippudo is the best thing to get and the closet thing to real Japanese ramen. The wait is not so terrible although it does go up to an hour or two, but if you are sipping on plum wine, sake or beer who cares!

This is definitely in my top 3 ramens (top is a toss up with Santouka at Mitsuwa), especially the akamaru modern. ÊThe broth is incredibly rich, flavorful, and complex. ÊI have a preference towards the thicker type of ramen noodles, but there's certainly nothing wrong with Ippudo's thinner type. ÊAll the yelling/shouting in Japanese gets really distracting and annoying after awhile, but I suppose it's part of the charm. ÊJust makes it difficult to have a conversation without pausing to let the servers/cooks do their shouting thing. ÊBoth times I came here, I went on a weekday for lunch and never had to wait. ÊI honestly probably wouldn't wait more than 15 minutes for this, especially since there are other pretty good ramen places and awesome food in general in the East Village. ÊBut if you're especially craving more unique ramen, then this would be the place.

ÊIt's much tastier than the place I usually go to, and you can get a lunch special with white rice Êand Japanese pickles.

Is there any point in even reviewing Ippudo..... Well, yes, there actually is. This year (2011) New York (Manhattan more specifically) felt like one culinary let down after the other. After many gastronomic missteps my girlfriend found Ippudo. The name sounded familiar, and inviting; so I agreed to go. The building and associated signs are rather small, but you can easily recognize it by looking for the revolving door of patrons and crowded bar area. We dropped our name onto a seemingly endless list and decided to stop at McSorley's for drinks instead of standing by there. I would highly recommended McSorley's during your wait for a few reasons. Their in house brews are excellent as well as cheap (comparatively) and it's easier to find people to chat up if you're so inclined there. Ê After about a hour and half wait we were finally seated. The hostesses have a system in place that monitors which guests stay for the wait and which leave; you can guess which receives preferential seating. I felt a bit like a follower ordering the Hirata buns (pork), but it was well worth the discomfort. These little things are basically the ramen equivalent of a BigMac. It's a steamed bun, a nice fatty piece of pork, lettuce (a touch of mayonnaise?) and a wonderful spicy bun sauce. The default order is for two, but I would strongly advise going straight for four. As far as the ramen goes, they're all very good, but I think my favorite is the Akamaru Modern with Nitamango (seasoned egg) and Kakuni (braised pork belly). These addons will cost you, but they're very much worth it, especially the pork belly. The other additions are not nearly as delicious, with the exception of Chashu pork (pork tenderloin) which is probably already present in your ramen stock right off the menu. Ê The drink selection is excellent. They have several hard to get Japanese beers, numerous hot/cold/unfiltered sakes, and a few Japanese single malts. The mixed drinks are all top shelf, which is nice, and they run about $8. I did not try any desserts in my few visits here, and I find them somewhat inconsequential anyway. Ippudo is a great Ramen house, with a strong menu. The wait can be obtrusive, but it can be alleviated by waiting at any area bar instead. The trendiness factor is high but the food is truly good, and those preparing the ramen are somewhat passionate about what they're doing. If you're in Manhattan, this is a must try, so good that I went twice in a one week stay.

Tried akamaru modern. The broth imparted an amazing flavor on the noodle. However, it did not taste so good when drunk alone. Also, the noodle texture is a bit off, almost undercook or not properly dried after freshly made. I would be curious to know if the texture issue is an isolated incident or what.

My boyfriend and I visitied Ippudo and absolutely loved it! We went on the reccomendation of Claire Robinson after her review on FoodTVs 'The Best Thing I Ever Ate'. And she was right. Simply an amazing Ramen soup! and in such a huge bowl! And the steamed rolls, YUMMY! We had the shrimp ones and it was so tasty and the shrimp was coated in great sauce. My boyfriend tried the pork ones as well but said the shrimp ones were tastier. The whole experience was quite enjoyable, from the loud japanese yells coming from the kitchen to greet customers to the waitress who was nice enough to take a few pictures for us.

It frustrates me that there are generally much less good Japanese food available in SF bay area compared to NYC. ÊOne good example is Ippudo. Why do we not have a place like this one in SF??? People in SF are just as Japanese-food crazed as LA or NY and I would think a place like this would surely be super popular here as well... But enough of the wishful thinking, on to my review. First of, this place is super crowded. ÊWhen I first opened the door and walked into their bar/waiting area, it was so crowded it got me worried if we can get a table. ÊThe hostess was telling other groups of 2s and 4s that there were an 1.5 hour wait. ÊBut luckily, my friend had industry connections and as soon as she arrived, we, the party of 6, were seated almost immediately. Ê The decor of the dining area was sleek, modern and fun. ÊWe were seated at one of their booth tables which looked more like a VIP lounge table... it was kind of neat : ) Ê And I must tell you, there is a reason why this place is so popular. ÊThe food here is ridiculously good. We had Pork belly "Kakuni", Cucumber appetizers, ribs, and buns with pork in it... and they were all phenomenal. ÊMy husband, a kakuni-sucker, melted when he had a bite of their kakuni, and when we all had the ribs which my friend really recommended, we all just rolled our eyes in dis-belief of how good it was. ÊSeriously, who would have thought you can get ribs that good in a Japanese restaurant?! ÊThe meat was unbelievably soft and it just barely hung off the bone when you picked them up. ÊAnd the buns... they were basically Chinese buns like Hao jiao (sp?) and had, yet again, really juicy pork inside it along with some greens and some spicy sauce. ÊThis was another one of my favorites. ÊThe cucumber, which was one of the few cold appetizers available here and one of the few veggie ones too, was really refreshing. ÊIt was just chopped up Japanese cucumber with dressing drizzled over it, but unless you are a major carnivore, I don't think you would've survived our meat-fest unless we had this cucumber. We also got to try their sizzling rice, which was kind of like fried rice/bibimbop (sp?) but on a flat sizzling iron skillet which the owner and a waitress came and mixed up the rice on top of, right at our table. ÊThis was crunchy, crispy goodness too. Then, off to the ramen. ÊThe guys got akamaru ramen with cha-shu pork in it by default but added yet more kakuni on top. ÊThis ramen had rich soup made from pork bone/marrow stock. ÊMy friend and I shared a soy sauce based ramen with duck, and my other friend got the shiromaru ramen. ÊAnd I must say, our soy based ramen was great, but I think the rich, thick akamaru ramen is the way to go here. ÊThe bold flavor definitely was worth remembering. Ê Oh and through the night, sake kept pouring. My husband talked (and drooled) about the food here for several days after this. ÊWe are already planning what we would want to order the next time we are back here. ÊRibs, cucumber, buns, akamaru ramen with Kakuni : ) Ê Great venues like this makes me miss living in NYC all the more.

what can i say that hasn't already been said about one of the best ramen places in new york city? yes, the wait is astronomical*. yes, the entire staff joyfully scream stuff at you as you enter their space. the hirata buns with pork? mouthwatering. and yes. the ramen really is that phenomenal. my personal suggestions are as follows. for first timers, i would suggest the akamaru modern with a soft boiled egg addition. the egg adds a rich, almost buttery flavor dimension to the already explosively flavorful broth. if you're feeling especially hungry, save some of your broth so you can ask for kaedama [extra noodles.] *the restaurant does not really advertise this, but if you walk in earlier in the day, you can make reservations for later on that evening. you still might have to wait 15-20 minutes, but it beats waiting nearly two hours in the cold. ask for a table in the back so you can actually have a conversation that's not interrupted by white dudes yelling stuff in japanese every forty seconds. after finishing a bowl of ramen, be prepared to nap with your eyes open for the remainder of the day. i mean it.

3.5 stars again. Êor maybe it's 4. Êi'm feeling semi-generous. i read the warning somewhere below that it was a 1.5 hour wait on a monday night, and i wanted to give people a heads up that i went last night (monday) at 7pm, and i waited about 9 minutes!! Êi was told 20, so i think people are right about them overestimating, but i was kinda expecting over an hour wait, so woohoo!!! it's a very cute place. i like the little globe up front that says "eating ramen is guaranteed to make you happy". Êthat's kinda true, isn't it? Êwell unless it's like my experience at momofuku where i was overwhelmed by the saltiness of the broth. Êbut that didn't happen last night. i sat at one of the rectangle communal tables. Êthe waitress started speaking to me in japanese. Êi had no idea what she was talking about, but my friend speaks fluently (and has eaten at their ramen shops in Tokyo), and i got the inside tip that you can tell them how you want your noodles!! Êon the firmer side, regular, softer side. Êthat's awesome! Ê i started with the crab croquettes that yelp people recommended, and i totally agree!! HOT, and delicious. Êreally good sauce. Êthen we both got the Akamaru Modern. Êi thought the noodles were perfection. ÊI ate them up really quickly. i had so much broth left over, i can totally understand why people get extra noodles. Ê The broth was pretty good, interesting flavors. Êi liked it.. i wasn't craving it like crack the next day, but definitely a solid bowl of ramen.

Amazing Japanese! Pork bun was out of control, ramen was awesome, add a bottle of sake and it was an amazing dinning experience. Ê The staff was great, very helpful with menu selections and attentive to service. ÊWent just after 5 when they start dinner service and there was no wait, leaving the place over an hour later was another story. ÊGo early, very early, but if you must wait know that it will all be worth it once the food hits the table.

i'm only knocking off a star because ippudo ramen in japan only cost like 6 bux. i could really do without the club/lounge setting, the cheesy shakuhachi dj krush beats on the website, and it gets even more pretentious... they call themselves a japanese ramen BRASSERIE and you need an MA in art history in order to order noodles... ok. come on! well its good stuff and i think i like their pork buns better than the ones at momofuku. but that might be because of the kewpie mayo, which is something i could basically just slather all over my body.

Here we go, a string of updates starting with the lusty temptress known as Ippudo. Located downtown at 65 4th Avenue, Ippudo is a Japanese restaurant that takes the humblest of Japanese dishes and elevates it to upscale pop culture star status. The dark but glitzy interior entry room houses a hostess stand and small bar where one can order 2 for 1 pints of Kirin or Sapporo for $6 Monday-Thursday. Speaking of weeknights, don't expect to come to Ippudo on a weekend without a potentially multi-hour wait. For that matter, try to get there before 6:00 even on weeknights, and even if your party is small. The icy hostesses won't help matters much if your dining situation is less than set in stone. With forced smiles they decree that restaurant policy is to A) Not seat parties that aren't all present (an increasingly common dining rule, but one I wholeheartedly disagree with), and B) Add-ons are not allowed. Wait, what? So when my party of 5 was seated at a table that could have accommodated 7 or 8, apparently were we to have another guest show up later they would not have allowed them a seat. Fortunately, the inadequacies in service are limited to the hostesses, acting almost as the restaurant bouncers who may more may not allow you entry past the red velvet curtain into the dining room proper. Once inside things are a different story. Newcomers may be startled at first to hear an entire restaurant's worth of chefs, hosts, and servers shouting at them when they enter the dining room. In (mostly) traditional Japanese form, the entire staff greets each guest with a hearty "Irasshaimase!" (welcome!) upon entry. The decor itself is sleek but warm, with a sit down bar lining the L-shaped exposed kitchen area. Adorning the back wall is a list of names spelled in Hiragana depicting the business's staff, starting with the founder in the top left corner. But enough small talk. Guests flock to Ippudo for one thing and one thing only: Ramen. Well they don't really just do Ramen. There is an entire menu of hot and cold appetizers, including their famous pork buns, which must be tried to be believed. These juicy little morsels are pricey - about $8 for two buns - but well worth the investment. The pillowy dough wraps slices of sticky sweet pork topped with a crisp leaf of iceberg lettuce and a dollop of Japanese mayo. Upon first biting into one of these heavenly little guys, I recalled a vague taste memory...what was it these flavor grenades reminded me of? Then it hit me: the pork buns at Ippudo taste exactly like a Wendy's Junior Bacon Cheeseburger. And I mean that with the utmost respect and adoration. Ramen. It's delicious, and contrary to some tradition-bound naysayers, Ippudo does it REALLY well. The menu consists of 5 different ramens, plus one nightly special. Choices include a fairly catch-all traditional model, a savory and salty soy based affair, a light and fragrant herbal infusion, a nutty concoction rich with roast sesame flavors, and finally the senses and convention shattering Akamaru Modern - a rich blend of pork based soup with Ippudo's spicy "special sauce", red miso paste, and, floating atop this magnificent elixir, a fragrant layer of garlic oil. Each ramen includes several of a variety of toppings, most of which can be ordered as add-ins, similar to the manner in which you would get a pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and jalapenos (at least you would if you were as awesome as me). For example, the Akamaru Modern includes slices of simmered Berkshire pork, cabbage, onions, scallions, and kikurage (wood ear mushrooms). However I have yet to order ramen without the mandatory addition of incredibly sexy kakuni (braised pork belly), and usually a seasoned hard boiled egg or bamboo shoots. Of course it wouldn't be ramen without the noodles. Ippudo's are a delight - perfectly cooked every time to be slightly toothsome and chewy, but by no means al dente. The best part is that for $2 extra, one may ask for "kae dama" - provided you've left a generous enough amount of soup in your bowl but finished all your noodles, the servers will bring you another portion of noodles to add to your bowl. Having dined at Ippudo with a friend of mine familiar with the staff, I realized that I am indeed a statistic: apparently something like 80% of the customers who go their first time and order Akamaru Modern return within the same week for a second time. Well having ordered Akamaru Modern, I actually returned twice in the same week. A word of warning however: eating at this ridiculously decadent noodle and broth juggernaut three times in a week leaves one's insides dry and crying for moisture (MSG OD anyone?). In this eater's opinion, a small price to pay for such bowl shaped bliss.

Dont get me wrong this place is good. The pork buns are amazing and so are the ribs. The ramen is good but is not so much better than a pack of instant Ramen. If you are in the area and there is no wait check it out. If you have to endure the 3 hour wait I'd say try something else.

I thought this place would just be another overrated New York restaurant, but I was so wrong. Ippudo serves the most decadent pork buns I have ever had in my entire life. ÊI can't even begin to describe how soft, light and perfect the bun is. ÊHow do they make it?! Nestled inside is the most succulent fatty pieces of pork with some mayo and lettuce. ÊSounds simple, but it will blow your mind. The combination of the bun and pork is amazing, but I think these would even be delicious separately. ÊThe pork is marinated in some sauce (maybe something mixed with hoisin?) which is like crack cocaine. After enjoying the pork bun appetizers, I moved onto the Karaka Miso Ramen - absolutely delicious. I've had ramen in Japan and this ramen definitely measures up. I've also tried to Akamaru Modern and the Shiromaru Hakata classic. ÊI think the Modern is my favorite, but you will not go wrong with any of the ramen dishes on the menu. I waited 1.5-2 hours both times I went, and I will gladly wait another 2 hours for these crack cocaine pork buns & ramen.

On my visit to New York, I heard I just had to try this place. ÊYou hardly hear about good ramen places, especially not in Virginia where I'm natively from, so I was excited to have a great taste. ÊI arrived around 12 on Sunday to a nice crowd of people, luckily not extending out into the bitter wind-swept streets. ÊThe wait wasn't too long, and I didn't mind since I was dying to try Ramen (I'm hesitant to say authentic, because I've never had it before) ÊOnce we got in, you're immersed in an atmosphere of modern Japanese cuisine, where the servers enthusiastically shout something and the rest of the staff shout back. ÊExciting stuff. ÊThe prices are just right for specialty food, at around $10 for the pork buns and around $20 for fully-loaded (all options added) bowls of ramen. ÊAnd boy, was it a treat. ÊPersonally, I had the Akamaru Modern. ÊIt's got such a flavorful soup adn the noodles have this unique texture that I've never had before in one of these bowl noodles. ÊNeedless to say, it's very delicious and packed full of flavor. ÊThe atmosphere is very modern, and the seating is very interesting. ÊThere are few dedicated tables, more like long tables where they can seat you down to others who are enjoying the same food. ÊMy whole experience with the restaurant was amazing, and the food topped off the visit. ÊWould I try again? ÊDefinite yes. ÊMy recommendations - Pork Buns and Samurai Ribs (the meat falls off the bone!).

visited NY mid Jan, and turned to yelp to find the most popular place was a Japanese Ramen place! came around 1 or 2pm, and the line was already an hour plus, but we gave them our number and went to Urban Outfitters and they called us. Quite frankly, the pork bun was the single best thing I ate in New York, more than grimaldi's pizza, or the famous Halal Cart. it had everything, an epic beginning, action packed middle, and surprise ending. I laughed, cried, and gave it the standing ovation. The ramen was good, i'm usually not a big ramen guy, it was good but i dont think id wait the hour plus just for it though. but the Pork Bun! ohhhh so good. 4 stars

When you first walk in through the classic Japanese curtains, you see a collage of noodle bowls all over the walls. ÊWe waited just a few minutes to be seated but I loved picking out the bowls I'd want for home. Ê I arrived early on a Sunday morning, perhaps just half an hour after they opened. ÊI was told we were lucky because there's normally a long line and a long wait. Ê My friends both got ramen noodles with pigs belly and another with seafood. ÊI tried both and both broth's were uniquely flavorful. ÊWow I never had a bowl of ramen with such marinated delicious additions. ÊI myself wasn't as hungry and just got the miso glazed black cod which was good. ÊI've had better at Nobu. ÊIt taste as if the miso hadn't marinated thoroughly but it was a nice appetizer. ÊI also had the fried shishito green peppers. ÊI love these suckers! ÊBut only 1 out of every 8 or so is supposed to be spicy, well about half of them were spicy in the batch I had. Ê It was quite expensive for a bowl of ramen but I'd come again, assuming there is no wait!

Of all the ramen places in New York, this is probably the best I've tried so far, though I have to deduct points for the 2 hour wait (how do people put up with the wait???). The pork buns were pretty satisfying - a lot better than the ones I've had at momofuku. I ordered the akamaru modern with extra braised pork belly and the broth reminded me of the broth at Santouka (my favorite ramen place BY FAR on the east coast), though slightly lighter with more of an upscale twist, but still enough complexity to leave me satisfied. I have to say this ramen is rather expensive, but I guess that's what you get for upscale/modern ramen!

I wanted to love this place, but the hour and a half wait left me starving and the bowl of ramen I ordered was not enough to make me happy.

The wait aside, the food was good and the service was friendly, but I was at the point of hunger where I would eat Fro-yo for dinner (not that there's anything wrong with having frozen yogurt as a main meal).

This is not a so traditional ramen place. The menu here is creative yet the foods are tasty. The broth/stocks from hours of simmering really bring out the flavor of the foods.

I brought a friend here to eat some longevity noodles for her birthday. ÊThere were only two of us, and this particular friend does not have the propensity for gluttony that most of my other friends do, which means that she doesn't let me order half the menu like I want to. We started out with two shochu cocktails: I ordered the "shochu with fresh grapefruit" and she ordered the "green tea high". ÊThe first arrived in two parts: a highball glass filled almost to the top with shochu, and a half a grapefruit with a citrus juicer. ÊMy first thought was "whoa, is that glass really full of shochu? what a bargain!" Then, the waitress put the drinks down and started to walk away, and i stopped her, asking "Wait, I have to squeeze my own grapefruit?" She gave me a cheerful "Yup!" and hurried off. Ê I squeezed enough juice to fill my shochu glass the rest of the way, and took one sip, and promptly realized that there was probably about an inch of shochu, and the rest was water. Not so much the bargain I thought it was. Ê The "green tea high" was weird....it just tasted like iced green tea with some vodka in it. ÊI would skip the cocktails and stick with beer or sake at this place. The pork buns were very good, but not as good as momofuku's, and mine had a huge glob of mayo on one side which was not the greatest. ÊThe roasted shishito peppers with yuzu salt were terrific. ÊNice and hot, and the yuzu salt gave it a very tasty zing. ÊThe shrimp tempura was not too greasy, the shrimp were perfectly cooked, and they had the perfect amount of sauce. The ramen is DEFINITELY the star of the menu. ÊWe got the Akamaru Modern with soft egg and bakudan on the side. ÊThis is the first ramen that I have had in 10 years that has been able to make a dent in my two long-time faves: Rai Rai Ken and Menchancko Tei. ÊEven Momomofuki comes in at 3rd place, but Ippudo may have just blasted its way into 1st. ÊThe broth is delicious, the noodles are fantastically chewy, the cabbage is al dente, and the egg is perfectly soft-cooked...but what really made this ramen for me was the bakudan, which definitely had the flavor of sichuan peppercorns, which I like to affectionately refer to as Ê"crack". I will be back for this ramen. ÊIt involves the "crack," so I probably could not stay away if I tried.

i was in a hyuuuuuge group, so we waited over an hour. understandable, as there were tons of others waiting as well. i was at the bar for quite some time and, apparently, somebody charged a drink on my tab. when closing out, i asked the bartender where this random drink came from. rather than argue, she poured me another glass and asked if i felt that was fair. i think tat's fair to most of us :) this place is where vampires would hang out. the ambiance is killer. i typically don't like asian buns, and i don't mean jackie chan's butt-cheeks-- not that i like those... their buns were THE HEAT! awe. some. though not a fan of how they charge for the extra noodles, the taste of the noodles deserve a rap song. they'd have darth vader shaking his shoulders w/ nate dogg singing in the background. value: meh... ambiance: word. service: double palabra food: yessir 4.5 stars.

I scarfed the bowl in 10 minutes...and craved more, instantly. There is a depth in the broth that is absolutely alluring. The tonkotsu broth with splashes of garlic oil was just divine and wait to blend in the dollop of aka miso! The noodles are almost outshone by the broth but they have a delightful consistency and an addicting chewyness. Have I ever had ramen before? At this point I don't think so, Ippudo showed me the light.... And the buta kakuni on top, a masterpiece of delicious and buttery fattiness...just perfect. We also had a "creamy chicken" broth that wasn't even close to the complexity of the pork one....don't bother, even if it's listed as daily special. Sitting in a communal table with the waiters yelling on every corner welcoming guests and serving dishes, this was a real treat. The two guys we met, who were sitting in front of us, ordered 12 pork buns...I guess I don't have to reveal why, check for yourself. I may have liked the Momofuku SSAM ones better tho...too much time in between, can't recollect. Damn pork dishes...never enough!

Why would I take a limo 40 blocks for a bowl of soup? I didn't care about the answer to this question after the two glasses of bourbon that I drank while riding down Broadway in said limo (hey, the guy did say 'help yourself.'). Ippudo serves the best ramen outside Japan that I have ever had. Be prepared to wait a long time for a table. Super friendly service.

After five months of hype I figured it was time to visit Ippudo and see what all the fuss was about. Before I start crying about how good the ramen is, believe me there were tears, I want to talk about the things which weren't so great. As has been pointed out previously, this is a chain, albeit a very good chain, the starters however are ordinary. Having eaten there twice in a week, I have sampled my share. Fried Shishito peppers - These short, sweet and slightly spicy green peppers, were unfortunately deep fried. They are served with a piece of lemon and some rather suspicious yellow salt - AKA chicken salt. My plutonium(MSG) radar was ticking. Karaage (Japanese fried chicken) - The chicken wasn't particularly crispy or really that tasty and was almost a little dry, I would have murdered some mayonnaise. Shrimp fritters - Deep fried shrimp, a greasy batter with a decent mayo/soy dressing. Pork Buns - I am a big fan of pork belly, when the fat soaks into my arteries and flows out of my pores, I lose it a little. Despite this I will try and do my best to remain objective - tasty but not as tender as Baohaus or Momofuku. At about $9 each you may as well skip them as they will be the last thing you remember about the meal, onto the ramen (around $14 each). Please don't mess around with chicken or duck, order the kakuni(braised pork belly) and if in a hedonistic mood, pay the $4 for extra kakuni (one piece). A large bowl of noodles with two fatty pieces of kakuni, kikurage (Mushroom), red pickled ginger, menma (pickled bamboo shoo), 1/2 hard boiled egg, sesame and scallions, drawn together by the most incredibly deep, rich and creamy broth, god damn, I didn't leave a drop. Is it wrong to want to bathe in it? Notes for the first timer: - If you go there prior to opening at about 4:45, and don't mind copping the incredulous stares of passers by not familiar with the Ippudo cult, you can join the line which will form rapidly. Otherwise expect a 45 minute or greater wait. No reservations. - Allow a good six hours mandatory food coma recovery time if you are going the kakuni. No tight dresses or skinny man jeans should be worn after. - The soup spoon comes seated inside a bigger spoon, which at first I thought was simply there to hold the soup spoon while not in use. However after watching a few fellow eaters, I think the bigger spoon is used to assist in the transportation of noodle to mouth. TBA. - Did anyone find it suspicious that they fill your water up so frequently? MSG radar. Tick. Tick. Tick. Both times I have been dehydrated for hours after. It could just be excessive salt. Ê - Did someone say the hostesses were pretty? An MSG foil?

This place was really awesome. ÊThere was a 30 minute wait at 3pm in the afternoon and it was TOTALLY worth it. Ê I don't see what the big complaint about the price is all about, the restaurant has an amazing reputation from Japan and the food was amazing. ÊI got the cucumber for an appetizer or rather something to eat other than ramen and the spicy ramen. ÊI ordered it spicy, but I should have ordered the extra spicy. ÊI felt that the spicy wasn't quite hot enough for the average person, however the noodles were perfectly prepared and the broth was very flavorful. ÊI was very happy with my meal here and will most definitely return when I am in the city.

Confessions of a Fake Ippudo Lover Okay, so don't kill me people, but I only LIKE Ippudo - I don't love it. Ê This place has an intimidating, obsessed cult-like following that I could just never become a part of (for them, not loving Ippudo is committing culinary sacrilege against the ramen gods). ÊI admit, I've even tried to fake it by pretending to love Ippudo in front of friends who constantly rave about it (shameful, I know). ÊIt's just, I find the broth a little too salty for my taste, and sometimes a little too oily (seriously, put your torches and pitchforks away). ÊAnd really, its just a chain restaurant. ÊBut overall, it IS a tasty place to eat. ÊI always thoroughly enjoy anything pork on their menu (esp. the roast pork over rice lunch special) ÊWorth an hour midday wait? Probably not. Anyway, I'm finally outing myself, and no longer will I live in the closet as a non-lover of Ippudo. However, if there's anyone out there with murderous inclinations as a result of this review, I was just kidding this whole time. ÊI LOVE IPPUDO. ALL HAIL IPPUDO!

Ippudo has a fun atmosphere but there isn't a lot of table space so be prepared to wait if you get there after 7. ÊWe tried the ramen which was very good except it used noodles closer to somen than ramen. ÊWe tried the pork buns which had a piece of lettuce and mayo in it which I thought strange but the lettuce worked however the mayo was not necessary and I thought the dish might be better without. ÊWe also tried the duck and eggplant special which was excellent. ÊThe dishes are a little pricey but good quality... I just wish they could use ramen noodles to go in their ramen.

I had the shoyu ramen. ÊThe broth and ramen were delicious ... better than at Setagaya (good but somewhat salty) and Momofuku (super salty; even the ramen itself tasted as if it had been born from a sack of salt). ÊHowever it was topped with only scallions and 2 rather thinly sliced pieces of pork. ÊA bit stingy for $13. I also ordered Chef's Special Pickles for $7. ÊThe pepper, daikon, cucumber, and carrots were nice and crunchy. ÊBut with the exception of the slice of yuzu and a tiny red chili pepper, they all tasted basically like vinegar. There is much more seating here than Momofuku or Setagaya but instead of giving you more room, you are seated pretty much like sardines just like other ramen joints. ÊThe atmosphere is somewhat noisy with the main background music featuring electric guitars. ÊOverall the food is nice but overpriced. ÊFor the tiny amount of toppings, the ramen should be $9 max and the pickles $5. ÊUnless the prices come down, I probably wouldn't come back here again. Ê4 (food) - 1 (price) - 0.5 (atmosphere) = 2.5. I waited approximately 1 minute for my seat; if I ever wanted to come back, there is no way I would wait more than 15 minutes for a seat. here.

Gourmet ramen!! I'd never actually been to a place like this before, so it was a really cool experience. Ê30 - 45 minute wait for a table, a bar in front that's quite useful during the wait, great service, really awesome decor. ÊI tried the Akamaru ramen, and wow the broth really blew me away. ÊSO flavorful and yummy, and the texture of the ramen was also perfect. ÊI think the prices are also pretty reasonable but not great for a meal that's not exactly too filling; but you're kind of paying for the whole kitschy dining experience, and the dishes seem really artfully done and well-prepared. ÊThis place is great for a night out with friends or for a date. I'm definitely coming back.

"And how long would YOU wait for noodles?" I whined. I like this place, but I am not completely head-over-heels in love. Deciding on what star rating this place should get has precipitated lots of conflicted emotions inside of me because of all these new ramen places popping up left and right, all over the east village area... Oh I love them all! How to start comparing what to what? Is this what I deserve for being ramen-polyamorous? So this place is a little bit more expensive than most of the ramen places in the area, excluding Momofuku Noodle Bar. Places that fall under the cheaper price range would be places like: Ramen Setagaya, Rai Rai Ken, May Chan Ramen and Robatayaki, Menkui Tei, Kambi Ramen... You get the idea. So my logical expectation of Ippudo would be that they have to have better ramen than them. They don't disappoint. Their noodles are freshly made and there is a large variety of ramen to choose from. Once seated, the ambiance is bustling, but very relaxing, which stems from the beautiful and unique japanese art pieces. And the service was very friendly and helpful. I like that the staff cheerfully greet the customers as they are getting seated. I try to come here before 6:30 to avoid the long wait list, which can be anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours long. Being the very impatient person that I am, I get frustrated when I have to wait more than an hour in order to get seated. I sit and pout and quietly complain, saying things like, "I mean, it better be the best place in the world to get such a long wait... And even the best places in the world don't necessarily get long waits! There are no 'lines,' in Michigan, where I come from." The bar does help alleviate some restless customers, which is nice because then you can complain while drinking. However, the front waiting area can get very crowded, loud, and unpleasantly uncomfortable. With this being said, I strongly feel that this place cannot get a five-star rating. They get good business, and I just feel that they can afford to get more seating or a larger space. But this space/seating issue is Ippudo's only major flaw. When I went here last, I got a wonderful bowl of Ebi wonton ramen, which was just another example as to how Ippudo makes great ramen with quality ingredients. I have also sampled the pork belly bits from the Akamaru Modern, which is very rich and tasty (and different from Momofuku's ramen pork belly). When venturing to the bathroom downstairs, I also noticed that they have their own noodle making room (see pictures) which you can see by peering into a very narrow and long set of windows in the hallway. The noodle making guy didn't seem to be in today, but you can sometimes spot him cheerfully drawing long strands of dough from a machine. There is no question that every ingredient is freshly made on premises, down to each strand of noodle. Ippudo has their own style in their decor as well as in their cuisine. I love them for that.

AAMMMAAAAAAAAZING! I absolutely love everything about this place but you have to get there early or be prepared to wait. The staff obviously love working here, hell, I even want to work here as everyone is so happy and the food is delish!!! I love the hirata buns with both chicken and pork and the ramen is seriously the best in Manhattan. I usually order the shiromaru classic or the akamaru modern and they are to die-for. WOW - serious ramen heaven. Hooray for the winter as means I get to go to Ippudo multiple times without feeling guilty :)

Hands down, the best ramen I have yet tasted! ÊWith over 2,000 reviews, it speaks for itself! Ê I used to not be a fan of ramen because the broth was sometimes too thick to smooth a thirst of yummy soup and sometimes it would be salty with overwhelming ingredients. ÊMy second time visiting New York with my friend, her sister wanted to take us to Ippudo to try out their ramen. ÊShe raged on how delicious it was and that her friend from Japan agreed that at Ippudo, their ramen is the closest to the authenticity of Japanese ramen. ÊShe warned us about the wait and recommended we go early to get seats because it will get really pack during dinner hours. ÊAnd it did not help that it was a Tuesday night when we dined here. ÊWe still had to wait for an hour before getting seated. ÊThere was a very small waiting area, most people would wait outside or they hang out at the bar and enjoyed a few drinks, perhaps some yummy sake cocktails. The ambiance at Ippudo was very upbeat. ÊEvery party that got seated, the entire house greeted them in Japanese! ÊIt was very interesting and entertaining. ÊAfter an hour of waiting, we finally got seated. ÊWe took no time to order appetizers and sake cocktails. ÊFor appetizers, the four of us enjoyed the Hirata pork buns, cheese steak, and coconut shrimp (I forgot!). ÊI enjoyed the pork buns and cheese steak a lot. ÊThe cheese steak was very delicious, the cheese was gooey and the steak was very tender. ÊThe flavors in the pork bun stood out and pleaded for seconds! ÊI ordered the Shiromaru Hakata Classic ramen ($14) and loved it. ÊThe flavors were very addicting and not overwhelming in flavors. ÊOne of my friend ordered the same one as mine and the other two ordered the Akamaru Modern ($14) and the spicy ramen. ÊWe all enjoyed our ramen a lot and were glad we waited because it was well worth it. ÊThis experience changed how I view ramen. ÊI really did not enjoy it before but after dinning here, I know what I look for in good ramen. ÊIt's truly a Japan delicatessen because it can go good or bad. ÊAt Ippudo, they mastered it from drinks to sake to appetizers to the main dish, RAMEN! Ê The service here was also excellent but the host at the front desk seemed rude and did not enjoy her job :/. ÊI just ignored her attitude every time I went up to check how much longer we had to wait. Ê The prices here are high but then again, this is New York, everything is a little more expensive compared to California. ÊI am still in search of a place comparable to Ippudo in Bay Area, California. ÊSo far, only one place comes close and I am loving it. ÊIppudo, I will be back to devour your yummy RAMEN & appetizers!

Friend took me here on a Friday night and wow is this place busy and loud. A bit more trendier then I would like my ramen shops, which reminded me of the nearby Momofuku, but the food was legit. A nice change of pace from a small joint like Rai Rai Ken, but more authentic then you'd expect from Ramen Setagaya. Other than the ramens (friend got the Shiromaru Classic and I went for the spicey one, both were good), they have a lot of appetizers. Definitely try the spicy tofu dish and the chicken wings were surprisingly good.

Finally came here a couple weeks ago after hearing about it endlessly for years. I had the signature tonkotsu ramen, and the pork buns of course. They...aren't too bad. All I can say is that if this is the best ramen in NYC, I'd be pretty sad. Everyone knows that it literally pains me to say anything positive about LA, but a LOT of establishments there (Shinsengumi, Daikokuya, and many many more) blow this place out of the water. I mean, I'm not comparing Ippudo to places in Japan, I'm comparing it to other US establishments, and it doesn't hold up at all. It's a cute place to go to when you really want ramen, and/or really want to impress your date who likes hyped-up trendy places, and nothing else is open because apparently real Japanese people like to go to bed at 9pm sharp. As for the pork buns, they were a big disappointment. I've definitely had way, waaay better in lots of other places. The meat was scarce, and there was basically nothing else in it - I'm used to fresh asian veggies in these buns to balance out the richness of the meat. Instead they put in a lot of mayo, which I think is disgusting. This is not a deli turkey sandwich, guys. Asian roast pork is already very, very flavorful all on its own. The mayo has absolutely no purpose except as a perplexing distraction and add 1,000 empty calories. It seems that ramen is becoming increasingly trendy, though, from all the places I've seen popping up all over the city, so I'm making it a mission to go try them all and find the best one. Dear NYC, please don't let me down, I did abandon LA for you, you know.

Ippudo has the best ramen I have ever had! Went here for our 1st lunch with my bf. Their soup is soooo delicious and the noodles were perfectly cooked, a little chewy and not overcooked! When the waitress 1st brought out my bf's Karaka-men, I can smell the deliciousness of that soup!!! He dug in right away before I even got my bowl!!! I have always wondered what the hype was, but when I took that first sip of the Kamo Nanban Shoyu Ramen, I was sold. We also ordered the Hirata Buns, which were pretty good too especially the Ippudo special sauce which made it a little spicy...mmm! So now, I'm just waiting to go back to eat more ramen!!!

It's been awhile since my last review of Ippudo. Much has changed through the years for this Ramen place. I can finally say that they are now heading toward the right path by concentrating on their ramen instead of doing other special dishes to attract customers. People want to eat Ramen, that is why they come. I am enjoying their set Lunch menu. The only slight problem I have now is seeing all the non-Japanese people working in the kitchen preparing my food and the Japanese people working as waiters and host. Kind of funny to go into a Japanese Ramen establishment and seeing Americans making the food that they know very little about. ==================================================?== My last review with 1 star rating. I arrived early at 5pm today to beat the long line. I had the Shiomaru ramen and the soup base turned me off right away. It tasted like liver soup pairing with hakata ramen served with 2 tiny small dry slices of roast pork for $13. You will need drinks to chase down the liver after taste. I also had the shrimp with asparagas appetizer and it was not very tasty for a stir-fry dish. They added avocado that was already exposed to the air and turned black, green/red peppers, and tossed with a light sweet mayo sauce on top of fried ramen noodles for $12. I sat near the counter and saw everything they were doing and was not pleased with what I saw. The turnip and pork belly were placed in a plastic container and microwaved, then served to customers. One Japanese cook was making the sauce for 2 steak dishes on the stovetop, tasted the sauce from the pan with the spoon, then use the same spoon to swirl around the sauce in the pan and then he spread the sauce over the steaks. The shrimp was all pre-cooked and placed in a ice water bath(no wonder the shrimp dish I had did not have any flavor; it was all washed out). They even microwaved sushi roll that was taken from the fridge, cut to 6 pieces, then microwaved with plastic wraps to warm, then served to customers with a mayo sauce topping. If they are planning to have an open kitchen, they should be careful not to show too much of their cooking methods to their customers. ÊI will go back in a few days to try their shio ramen before I pass final judgement. Nobody ever mess up Shio ramen before. Nothing really spectacular that made me say, "Wow! I have to come back and have 2 more bowls of noodles" Menchanko Tei also serve the same type of hakata noodles and their broth was more tastier.

The best artisanal ramen in town, which may sound like a contradiction in terms, but there it is. ÊAkamaru (red ball) Modern is the best. ÊForget about trying to get in during peak hours, the wait is egregious. Mid-afternoon on a Sunday, the wait is tolerable. ÊEdamame is served with the salt on the side, which is delicately flavored. ÊYes, the staff shouts out a welcome in Japanese, but being annoyed with that is like being annoyed with gypsy violinists in a Hungarian joint or dissing the mariachis at a Mexican restaurant-- it's part of what makes the ramen experience... Êlike slurping the noodles.

Came in on a Monday for lunch with a party of five. 30 minute estimated wait was actually an hour, I didn't mind so much seeing as the group I was waiting with was awesome. The decor and atmosphere is very nice, and loungey. I had the: Akamaru ramen ( $17) with a poached egg ($2) Ê Hirata Buns (2 pieces) Ê Ê$9 The ramen noodles where chewy and tasted like chinese or vietnamese fresh thin egg noodles that you can get at many noodle places. The broth was good not too sweet, and spicy is not spicy at all. The Buns where decent but not any better than any bao bun with good meat in it. The Pork didn't melt in your mouth like you would expect it to. Overall consensus I enjoyed my time there but the food isn't great and a bit overpriced. I would not crave anything that we ordered but did enjoy the atmosphere.

The ramen was delicious, it's probably one of the best in town. we waited 45 minutes for a $16 bowl of ramen, i still think this is worth it. although many said it's too expensive but all of my friends and they were all asian said it couldn't be better. the pork bun was delicious and juicy, karakage was yummy. next time, we will go there before 12 noon to avoid the line.

i am from washington dc and as big of a city as we are we do not for the love of god have a decent ramen place!!! so for my visit to ny i told my host that i wanted some authentic ramen...and there was only once place he could think of.... IPPUDO! so we walk to ippudo and enter this dark cave...through some velvet curtains...and am immediately engulfed in a throng of people all cramming to get their name on the list. i elbow my way through and add out name on....a 2.5 hour wait time. ETA 6pm. so my friends and i walk around and come back...we get seated and are greeted with a loud shout from all the servers are sushi bar staff. yay! we sit and i let my friend who has been here before do most of the ordering appetizers: pork buns- mmmm sweet tender pork in a light chewy rice cake with some lettuce and a spicy mayo sauce..delish! tofu..something?- i forgot the name of this but it was tofu in a large bowl with a savory broth. the tofu was wrapped in this gelatin like coating that was SO good!! main: i ordered the special of the evening which was the wasabi ramen with pork and poached egg...this was TO DIE for! i loved how the ramen was infused with wasabi...mmmm not too spicy at all!! and the server came around and showed you how to enjoy and eat the ramen correctly. i was super stuffed after the meal and left satisfied. only complaint i have was that the hostess was RUDE and seemed to hate the world. get a grip girlfriend... and the lobby area where we were waiting was SUPER HOT and humid, while the rest of the restaurant was cool. but the 2.5 hour wait in that area was unbearable.. doesn't help that outside was even hotter...

whatever greeting every staff member yells in japanese while each party of people are walked to their table is fun and annoying all at the same time. my boyfriend has proclaimed that i'm a TT, or "tall top." short legs, long torso. the seating at this place offers the perfect balance to my proportions. the seats are low and the tables high. my elbows rest on the table at just the right height. bonus points. the pork buns with their fatty goodness was a great way to start the meal. the ramen reminded me of the noodles you get in wonton noodle soup. though i was told that that's how ramen in Japan is, the ramen at Katana Ya or Santa Ramen in the bay area strike my tummy in a better way. still a great place.

How tasty can ramen be in NY? There's a nice Little Tokyo in LA that's pretty authentic, and if not, plenty of places around Torrance so no need to waste limited stomach space on my short trip here. I was wrong. Ippudo changed the game for me in terms of ramen in the US. It was just so amazingly delicious that my 1.5 hour wait was worth that hearty, savory broth with the perfect ramen noodles. I got the modern ramen, which had their signature soup base (not sure what goes into it but it had a really fragrant pork flavor), roasted garlic oil, and all your favorite ramen accompanyments (egg, bamboo shoots, etc.). There was also a lump of sauce in the middle - not sure what it was, kinda orangey-red, but it added an additional layer of flavor to the dish. More savory, not spicy, had texture to thicken up the broth just a tad more. Aside the beautiful broth, the roasted garlic oil really took the soup to supernova. I had one of those life-altering pauses after my first slurp of the broth which I made sure to add a giant amount of oil too (yes it's visible and it might scare you healthy people but think of it as EVOO for the vacationer. Chilll out, you get to cheat.) The noodles were just perfect. Thin, had the right snap, stood its own in the thick broth, and not the frozen or mass made crap you eat at other places. The noodles were surprisingly delicate against the soup, but it was the right complement. And oh, the pork belly buns, what? I had the Momofuku ones right before, and I can confidently say I prefer these ones. It kinda reminded me of a hamburger because of Ippudo's special mayo sauce and that piece of iceberg lettuce, which I usually nix from my dishes but I really enjoyed it in my bun. The bun was amazingly soft and had the ratio of sweetness to it. The pork belly, admittingly was not as soft and tender as Momofuku, but I really enjoyed the flavor. It was well marinated with some special sauce, and the other thing I especially enjoyed was the contrast between the slightly pan-fried, tougher pork belly to the soft, fluffy bread. It was just a really balanced bun, and I can't believe I had so much to say about one individual bun... Oh, and for the record, they can do tender, ridiculously soft pork belly like Momofuku as showcased in their ramen, but they chose this type of execution. Genius! Just genius...

The ramen is delicious and the restaurant decor is beautifully hip. ÊAlso, I think this is a great date spot. ÊMost available seating are meant for patrons to see the cooks preparing the noodles, which is a nice touch. ÊThe broth at Ippudo is rich and flavorful. ÊThe standout dish was actually the Japanese cucumber mixed with sesame oil dressing. ÊIt's simple, fresh and extremely delicious. ÊOverall, Ippudo is great and lives up to the hype.

Trendy, high-end, crowded, noisy, small Manhattan restaurant. ÊIf that's your scene, then you'll probably be comfortable at Ippudo. ÊIt's less of a traditional Asian restaurant, but more like a fusion restaurant. ÊExpect to wait a while for a table.... Êfrom 1 to 2 hours. ÊThe food is good, but portions are unsatisfactory, and a little too pricey for me. ÊI like leaving full.. either my stomach or my wallet; unfortunately this place does neither for me.

pork belly broth was amazing and the ramen noodles had great texture. Êfor a ramen joint, this place's interior was decorated well and the ambience had an alluring modern feel. Êthe wait wasn't long at all either, and the ramen was reasonably priced. i'm definitely coming back for more...

Hey SF, THIS is how you fucking do ramen! ÊHaving just completed my reviews of the sad state of ramen in the Bay Area, I finally had the chance to taste what ramen is supposed to be. ÊThe Akamaru ramen with the extra hirata pork was like porky heaven in a bowl. ÊIf I could have drowned in the broth, I would have died with a smile on my face. ÊThe hirata pork buns were also fantastic and after having tried the Momofuku buns later in the evening, I must admit that I liked Ippudo's version better. ÊThe buns were just a little more balanced and delicate than the offering at Momofuku. ÊThe service here was efficient and friendly and the cost reasonable for the quality of the food that you're getting. ÊAh... if only I lived in NY....

This place has over 1000 raving reviews and that should say something to you.. it's freaking GOOD!!!! I'd scarf down every last drop of every ramen bowl I've had here if my stomach could fit it all. My favorite broth here is the akamaru. It's very rich and not too salty with yummy pork meat! The miso flavor isn't so bad either. They always have special monthly broths. One time, they had wasabi flavor ramen. It's my second favorite here, but too bad it was only a monthly special. It's a bit overpriced. $16 for a bowl of ramen! But what can you do when they're the best ramen joint in NYC? Anyway, TRY IT! You will not be disappointed!

I have to just say it: better than daikokuya and let me just tell you.. I freaking LOVVVE daikokuya. Their ramen was soooo delicious, and wtf is in their pork buns, I nearly had tears of joy running down my face.. damn those pork buns are perfect. I wish we had gotten more. Inside Ippudo is really pretty .. very trendy! Its like a whole dining experience, esp because we got lucky and got our own big table!.. when you get there they seat you and set up some bowls and stuff Êin front of you. ÊI thought was a bit unnecessary, because it took at while and it was kinda awkward.. but maybe it was just the waitress. ÊBless her heart cuz she was sweet but she kept dropping the chopsticks and bowls and stuff while trying to get it all to balance.. don't worry I did my best not to laugh..too much. Oh and they take their ramen very seriously.. little story: ÊSo we ordered and then a little later, my friend had to go to the restroom and asked the waitress where it was. She explained where, and then asked, you 're going now?? ÊShe was like"uh..yeah." Then the waitress shouts something to the other server/ramen deliverer Êin japanese and she says something back and we were like ..uhh maybe she wants to walk you to the bathroom? O_o and the waitress is kinda blocking her path so she cant get out. Then she looks at her watch and lets her go. After she leaves she explains that the ramen is almost ready so she will time how long our friend is away and if she is not back in 5 minutes, she will have the cooks redo her ramen again. Then we all went OHHHHhhhh~ Ê( coulda said that from the beginning is what I said..) anyway really pleasant /interesting experience, delicious food, and like I said.. the best ramen / pork bun ive tried so far! YUM~

After hearing all the hype, I decided to check the place out. Please note that I had my fair share of ramen from different restaurants in Manhattan. The first thing you will notice about this place is the wait. We went there on a Thursday around 5:30pm and the wait was still 20 mins. I guess this is not bad compared to what I read about. We started with 3 appetizers (Yamitsuki Goma Kyuri, Pork Buns, and Bakuretsu Tofu). The Yamitsuki looked simple but was very tasty and refreshing. The Pork buns was amazing, the meat was not too fatty and very flavorful..too bad I can't say the same about the Bakuretsu Tofu..it was nothing special at all. Onto the main course. We got the Karaka Miso Ramen w/ poached egg. When the ramen bowl came out, the first thing I noticed about it was the small portion. It had like 3-4 pork slices and very little toppings. My first taste of the ramen noodle and broth and I was a bit disappointed. It was nothing special that I never tasted before. The soup was very flavorful but nothing out of this world compared to the other ramen noodle shops (Minca, Rai Rai, Momofuku). I finished the bowl and was still hungry. I don't know how some of these reviews are saying they are full from the bowl of noodle. Our total bill was around $90 with tips.. I had to do a double take at the check. It is definitely on the more expensive side for ramen noodle. Overall experience of this place is that it is definitely hyped. 1-2 hours of wait time, overpriced ($18 miso bowl w/ egg) small portion. If someone ask me about this restaurant, the only thing that comes to mind is their pork buns are amazing, thats all.

I must say this is the best Ramen I have had in New York. ÊThe restaurant is perfect for late night snack on a weekday where there is no wait.

Ridiculously long wait (1.5hrs on a Sunday night) ... the ramen wasn't worth it. Super fatty ramen soup, which is probably the reason so many people like it. Not that great, in my opinion.

Legit ramen, which is of course why people love it. ÊBut $20 good? ÊNot in my mind; check out Shinsengumi on the other side of the country for great broth, noodle consistency, and sides.

I just learned that approx. 1,200 readers already know about this place but for the uninitiated like myself, I'm going to throw in my two cents anyway. I LOVE RAMEN. I've been actively researching several ramen restaurants for years, but I think I've just discovered nirvana. It's called "Ippudo," in the East Village. ÊIt's of all things part of a franchise I'm told, but don't confuse it with KFC. ÊThis place is the real deal. When I arrived, the place was packed, which I heard was the same thing, every single day. ÊA solid one-hour wait, but it was well worth it (I suggest getting pleasantly saturated with cold sake at the too-small bar in the meantime). This is what I sampled, and it was beyond wonderful-- pure gastronomic heaven, unforgettable. ÊFirst, the starters... I ordered the small pork buns, similar to the classic Chinese cha shu bao, but more delicate in presentation, incredible. ÊThen came the chilled Japanese cucumber, smaller in circumference than it's American cousin, but infinitely more flavorful and crunchy, Êawesome. ÊThen I ordered something I've never had in an Asian restaurant, anywhere-- these small, Japanese green peppers, quickly sauteed in olive oil then dusted with a special salt that was equally fabulous. ÊIn fact, I think this single dish was the surprise of the entire evening. ÊThen came the soup noodles. ÊThey begin cooking the broth early in the morning, it was clear and pork-based, thin strips of Berkshire pork glistening on the surface like a piece of Japanese art. ÊIt was the best bowl of ramen I've yet had in New York City, period (still a joint in Edgewater, New Jersey I'm told that's supposed to rival the best in Tokyo, but I've yet to make the jaunt). Ippudo was a bit pricey, but well worth the effort. ÊI highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys truly inspired Japanese noodles at their zenith. ÊScrumptious Factor: ÊWow.

Good, but not great (in terms of ramen). If you'd really like to try this place, I'd suggest going early when they first open at 11am. The lines aren't as long and you get better service. When walking in, don't get startled by them screaming welcome to you. The ramen was alright, but I'm comparing that to the Ippudo in Japan, which is by far way better. The one thing they had the upper hand on was their Hirata buns. Chicken and pork were both really, really good. you definitely have to get those while your there. you'll regret it if you don't.

I came here based on a recommendation from a friend. As many others have stated, the pork buns were very flavorful. I agree with Janelle from SF about the ramen though. I had the akamaru modern with pork belly and egg. I was told by the bartender that this was, "the best ramen you'll find in the U.S." While I appreciate his enthusiasm, this guy must not have eaten much ramen in the U.S. ÊI've had better in both LA and SF (and Japan). The ramen wasn't terrible. However, the broth lacked the complexity of taste that I'm used to. Also, the pork belly was a little dry. ÊYes, that's right, dry pork belly. ÊHow is that even possible? ÊFancy decor and hipster cooks only get you so far Ippudo. I suggest you focus on your food.

a japanese ramen chain from japan that finally comes to the us. i can def see the appeal. but for me, the winner here is clearly the pork buns. my God, the pork buns. Here's what we ordered: - Hirata pork buns ($8): the buns are light and fluffy, with the pork belly already stuffed into this open faced bun, a small piece of lettuce, and a spicy sauce. the lettuce almost makes it seem like it's the pork that's crunching. very nicely done. one order only comes with three buns, so we got two orders for the three of us. i wish we got another order. two/person doesnt seem enough for this slice of heaven. -Akamaru Modern ($13) : beyond flavorful broth - wow! -Wasabi ramen($13): wasabi broth...it was light and good but compared to the akamaru, it just didn't hold a light to it.

There is always a wait - and you won't understand why. Cos by the time they announced to you your wait is over, you walk inside, you see plenty of empty seats. my bet is to make you order drinks from the bar, and build your anticipation (make u hungrier = ramen tastes better) I'd call it #2 ramen place in America. #1 is Totto Ramen on 52 and 9 #3 is Santouka in LA The pork buns deserve 5 star, ramen is 4-star, the wait is 3-star, you need to wait when restaurant is empty is 0-star. Pork Buns - The bread is soft and flavorful. Pork belly is carefully chosen, fat and meat are even, a piece of lettuce + spicy mayo sauce together = perfect. Ramen - I tried the classic and modern and daily specials. I never like the modern or the specials. So the last few visit I got myself classic. I noted the broth doesn't taste consistent, sometimes it's perfectly right, sometimes it's too salty, sometimes too much butter was added so it's too greasy. Noodles too - always fresh, but sometimes its too hard/too soft. Toppings... er, average. the cha siu though, could use meat that has more fat. Other stuff - tried the salmon, tofu etc dishes... well, my word is, don't even bother trying other dishes.

yummy! a bit of a wait but you can sit down at the bar [cash only] and get some snacks and drinks - the mixed grapefruit drink was delish. one annoying thing - they claim your wait time doesn't begin until your whole party arrives, so even if a few of you PLAN to come early to put your names down your half hour to an hour wait is just extended. i sort of flipped a shit when they told me this so I think the hostess just put down that our whole party was there, so maybe just throw a tantrum. ramen was really good but they were a little lacking with the meat (only two pieces!) i've heard this was standard but i could've done with more... the pork buns were super tasty and i tried a different grapefruit drink when i sat down - it was a glass of soju and half a grapfruit that you squeeze into the soju yourself. they took my grapefruit away too early though :( sighs the staff was super friendly and the seating is really spacious and comfy, not super crowded like most other ramen houses. i'm not sure if i'd go back because of the wait and price, but i think everyone should go at least once! i can also see it being really fun for a birthday/group outing.

I'm pretty sure this place is the best ramen place in New York! The waiting time for me was two hours and I'm not sure if it's worth the waiting. In California, Santouka is the best ramen place I've been to. If I had to compare both, that's a really tough choice since their broth are both somewhat different. I had the Akamaru Modern which was very filling. This place would definitely be a place I'd go to if I was in New York again, though.

i highly recommend this place for ramen lovers. i had the shiromaru classic and it was the best japanese ramen I ever had. for any ramen lover, the flavor of the soup and the texture of the noodles has to be on point and Ippudo's ramen satisfies both. one sip of the soup, and you could taste the richness of pork, beef and just the right amount of miso for that truly hearty taste of ramen broth. the noodles were chewey, not overcooked or undercooked -just right. this combination surely brings out the authentic ramen taste and Ippudo lives up to its name. also want to add that the place was very nice. modern interior with an open kitchen where you could see the japanese cooks and the wait staff are very polite.

Ê it's no secret, Ippudo is hopping and popping with good food, positive energy, and excellent service. Ê only 4 stars because they dont serve the spicy ramen in the winter unless you order the spice separately for an additional cost; $20+ for ramen is just a tad much.

wow.. where have the times gone! i've been to this place 3x the past year and i live in MD! haha and yet i still haven't written a review! where have my manners gone... must be all the pork buns that i've been eating making me completely forget to yelp! *wipe hands* ok, now where to start... 1st time I came here, I was like why on earth do I need to go to a place for ramen noodles when I can simply make the packaged ones right in my pantry? right? haha.. oh silly me.. turns out that the ones in the package are bad processed food but ones in the restaurant are made fresh and oh so different.. well not sure if they make it right then and there but it definitely doesn't taste like your cup of noodles - that's for sure =D from the encouragement of my friends, we each got an order of pork buns.. O. M. GEEEEE - wow that stuff is sooo good! i mean better than duck buns.. the pork just literally melts in your mouth! Êfunny, my mouth always water whenever i think back on food when yelping - haha.. anywho, it's good, it's very good. Ê now onto the ramen noodles, i've tried the spicy ramen, miso ramen and the ramen won ton noodles - all good - VERY good.. my gawd, i want to go back again and that'll be in two weeks! haha.. i'm a bit obsessed now, can't you tell. if you haven't been, you should go but then again, don't let me hype it too much otherwise ur expectations would be too high.. so umm, yeah this place sux! don't go! but yeah go still =P If you don't go for the food, at least go for the enthusiastic greeting each time they take you to your seat.. they really love the ramen =D last two times I went were early mornings like around 11am and there wouldn't be much of a line. ÊAny later, you could be waiting for a good hr or so. Êi'd wait of course but that's just me. I want my pork buns! =P

mmm! the smell of delish broth here is very intoxicating! good food, dessert was okay and the mushi-mushi yelling gets old after awhile. i do like how it's an open kitchen. i love watching food being prepared and you know they have to be clean bc let's face it, why would people eat at a spot they can see is filthy?!

it's so funny how we found this place. we were craving ramen and found an obscure address to a ramen joint. i started to ask this random guy on the street about ramen, then i saw his shirt "I heart Ramen" and i said, HEY! that's what we wanna eat, and so he pointed us in the direction to Ippudo. Like most NYC restaurants, you have to wait. i like the noodle choices. definitely get the soft boiled egg and a side of braised pork. who doesnt love braised meats?? AND, if you still have enough broth left in your bowl, you can re-up on noodles!!! who does that?? they will give you another "ball" of noodles to help you finish off the broth. awesome!! the entire waitstaff likes to yell at incoming guests. i guess this is japanese tradition to yell "welcome!!!!(!@#*^!*@#^!!!!" when customers arrive...or when an order is up...or maybe just whenever they feel like it, so the place is kinda loud. but it's a noodle joint. no need for ambiance.

So this was on the Yelp's Hot list. It is a fun place to go but be prepared to wait. I am quite skeptical on ramen and why there are so many ramen places that are popping up. Ippudo definitely opened up my eyes to the world of ramen. The portions are pretty good but still not worth the price tag or the wait. You only get like 3 pieces of meat with your order...definitely not enough. I am glad I came here and it opened up the world of ramen. However, I can't wait to try all the other places.

i am an asian food fetishist. give me a good bowl of udon and i am yours forever. so, when i went with my bossfriend lady, who lived in japan for several years, i knew she would only go to an authentic place to eat her favorite meals. we ordered her favorite dishes plus buns and creme brulee for desert, and i was in heaven! HEAVEN. HEAVEN IN HOMEMADE BUNS AND NOODLES. seriously, amazing service -- if my glass got even half empty, they'd refill it, bing bang boom: never had anything better. A++ SERVICE, A++ food. I'm haunted by it, and I had it nearly three weeks ago! It was 50 bucks combined, which considering the service, food, and ample of both, 25 each is amazing. Best place in town I've been to so far -- better than many Taiwan restaurants, actually. Insane.

i hate lines. so the best solution? table for one. Êi bypassed the 1 hour line and went straight in. Êthe soup broth is very good and is likely what distinguishes this ramen restaurant from the others. Êthe ramen noodles were alright, but they were cooked perfectly.

I try to come here whenever I can!! ÊThis is one of the best ramen places in NYC. ÊNot only do they have great ramen, they have very good pork belly buns and pork spare ribs. ÊThey really know how to cook their meats at this place, everything is buttery smooth and fall off the bone goodness. ÊThis place is more pricey then any other ramen place, and a bowl can run you around 20 dollars depending on the extras you add on. ÊMy default is the akamaru modern with Nii tamago (hard boiled egg with raw inside) ÊExtra charshiu is probably not a bad idea either. ÊThe one con i feel is that the noodles here are too thin, and it doesnt have the chewy texture that i love about noodles. ÊExtra serving of noodles is 2 or 3 bux, but what about an extra serving of broth!! the first time i took my friends here both had finished their broth first since it was so damn good. ÊAll you could see was a heap of noodles, and a sad look on their faces. ÊI have also tried the hakata ramen, it was decent but not as good as the akamaru modern. Ê I still feel like Minca is the best overall ramen restaurant, sure the broth isnt as good as ippudo, but Minca has better pork, better noodles. ÊBut since Ippudo is more accessible to me, i do come here a good amount. Ê Decor is better then any other ramen restaurant, and it probably plays into the factor of the increased cost of the food. Lunch specials are a steal with regular portion ramen, but with 3 dollars more gets you a salad and a rice dish (chicken, mentai (fish cod roe), pork) I will be back again and again..

I don't know what the hype is about but this place is good but not the best Ramen in town. If you get there anytime after 5, be ready to wait for an hour for party of 2, any bigger party be ready to wait up to 3 hours. ÊI always order the miso or standard ramen with pork. I think the soup base is just way to oily. I must say the pork bun is the best thing there. It melts in your mouth. If you really want to wait that long for expensive ramen, give it a try.

wow, 493 reviews? Went in for lunch, no wait, greeted by a chorus of Japanese that just made me smile, though i didn't understand it. was seated at the end of a long table, right next to the dish pit, but with a pretty good view of the kitchen. anyway, the broth was amazing, the noodles were fantastically chewy, but the pork was very boring, and the egg had been boiled to death, and was chalky even after sitting in a bowl of soup for the duration of my meal. Also they were a little heavy handed on the ginger and sesame seeds. Êtagged for 20 bucks with a beer, but worth it. Êand for some reason i love how everybody says goodbye and thank you when you leave, its silly, but it made me smile. I'll be back.

My brother Kevin hates New York. Only because he is frightened to death of anything north of the Mason Dixon Line and exposing himself to walking longer distances than from his front door to his car. This also explains why he likes the Pennsylvania Dutch Market in Cockeysville but hasn't actually made it to Pennsylvania. Lame. Meanwhile, I finally lured Kevin into visiting (actually, this was mostly my sister-in-law), with promises of Taim, A Salt and Battery and cart food. We made it to none of these places. BUT, we trekked to down to Ippudo in the village, and I must say, IT DELIVERED LIKE DOMINO'S (high fives guys!). I've been here before on another recommendation, actually the same source as Esposito's Pork Store, and it was punch-yourself-in-the-face-awesome then too. I did have apprehensions about taking the kiddies there. I wasn't sure how baby-friendly this trendy, but delicious restaurant would be. By the time we lined up for the dinner service, my fears were assuaged. Every other person in line a had tiny baby or a mini-toddler with them. It turns out, Ippudo was an almost perfect choice to take your loud, unruly, pork eating children to. It's loud (to mask their tiresome crying), the booths are big (for them to roll around on the seats like maniacs), and the food comes out fast (always a bonus in case they flip their internal EVIL BABY switch). The rundown: 1. Shishito deep-fried japanese peppers served with yuzu salt. Whole peppers maybe intimidating to some, but the frying mellows out any violent heat. The salt is great. 2. Hirata Chicken Wings fried chicken wings with Ippudo special black pepper sauce. So umami! Salty, sweet, sticky. 3. Hirata Buns steamed pork buns, served with Ippudo original spicy buns sauce. There are no words. 4. Shoyu Ramen soy flavored ramen noodles soup, a combination of chicken and tonkotsu soup, with slice of Berkshire pork, cabbage, naruto, & scallions. I added the tamago option of a soft, poached egg. In conclusion, Kevin would cut off his left leg before admitting, it but he LOVES New York. He probably downloaded that Jay-Z/Alicia Keys New York song as a ringer for his iPhone.

Hand's down one of my favorite Ramen places. Pork buns are delish with the perfect amount of sauce to meat ratio. I think I can eat about 2 orders of them myself. as for the ramen, you can't really go wrong with any of the flavors but my stable is the Classic Ramen. My only issue is the wait... I've never waited less than 45mins for a table. even if it's just 2 people sitting at the bar. This said, I highly recommend that you go, put your name down, leave and grab a drink or 2, then come back. Nonetheless, it's always worth the wait.

We went to Ippudo to see what was up with all the hype and I personally thought it was overrated, especially because of the one and a half hour long wait. The food was delicious, but nothing exceptional compared to other ramen places I've tried. I had the vegetarian ramen and the wasabi octopus as an appetizer. The latter, though it a very small portion, was the highlight of the meal. For the price and the wait though, I'd rather head to a different restaurant.

I went to Ippudo twice this summer. This place definitely deserves its high rating in Yelp. I would give it 5 stars if the wait time is shorter and the price is cheaper. The wait time was anywhere from 30 minutes to 90 minutes. The noodle and the broth were worth the wait. I have never taste noodles like that. Don't forget to ask the waiter for more noodle for $2 or something.

My 2 favorite restaurants in NYC are Per Se and Ippudo. That should tell you a lot! The pork buns here are made with a spicy mayo that kick Momofuku's buns' butts. ÊThe Akamaru Modern ramen (my fav) has a very 'Asian' complexity that is unsurpassed (I add in a poached egg and bamboo shoots). ÊThe almond tofu dessert is the best I've found in the city. ÊI've had all the ramens, and they are all very good. ÊNoodles and broths are made fresh daily. The wait is long, very long, at times, but even if you said, 'there is no wait at ---', I'd keep on waiting.

Best ramen place in NYC by far, hands down. ÊI found Momofuku's Ramen disappointing after having eaten at Ippudo. I always tend to get the Akamaru Modern because it is so good I find myself developing cravings for it. ÊThe broth has so much flavor and the noodles are perfectly cooked - you can tell they make them on site. ÊIppudo even has the option of adding a second helping of noodles to your broth for $2. ÊI have not been able to take advantage of this but I know some friends who have. ÊThe Akamaru Modern is extremely filling as a good bowl of ramen should be! ÊThe Shoyu Ramen and the Kogashi Miso Ramen are other fantastic choices too. However, I knocked a star off because of the wait. ÊEven if you get to Ippudo a little after opening there will still be a wait. ÊNow the longest I've waited is an hour and a half but it's a long time with little room in the lobby to wait in (you tend to stand outside). ÊHowever, I tend to forget all about that when I get inside and start devouring the delicious ramen with a nice cold glass of one of their varieties of plum wine (there are two)! ÊThere's a good reason why there is a wait for Ippudo - the ramen is seriously that yummy. THE place for Ramen in NYC.

The food is still good, though $4 for a very small bun isn't worth it. Come here for the classic Hakata ramen, but expect lines of 1 hour minimum if you have a party of two or more. The service is not as good as it was when it opened, or even a few months ago. Part of this has to do with the new hostesses. They have a hard time pretending to care that you just waited 1-2 hours in the cramped lobby. The old hostesses were very gracious and actually were apologetic about the long wait times. Normally I wouldn't care so much about the hostesses' demeanor but you will probably spend more time in the lobby/bar than you will eating. I hope the lady owner comes back and sees how things are run in the front of the house.

My girlfriend and I have meant to go to a ramen shop, but we've never gotten around to it before today. After reading up on reviews, we decided to make the trek down to St. Mark's and walk over to Ippudo for lunch this morning. Even though we got there around 11:30 AM, we still ended up waiting around 15 minutes or so for a seat. Given the seating arrangements I saw, it's probably easiest to get a seat if you're coming with one other person or with a decent-sized group, as that's how most of the seating is arranged. Our food was pretty quick to arrive, and all of it was delicious. We got the hirata buns and the sizzling grilled chicken appetizers. The buns had delicious chunks of pork belly with a mayo-like sauce and lettuce in a Chinese-style bun, while the chicken was served on a platter similar to those used in fajitas; it was served with mushrooms in a thick sauce. Both were delicious, but I mark them down a bit because they weren't as so delicious to justify the price ($8 for 2 buns, $12 for the grilled chicken). In addition, the chicken was chopped into such small pieces that it felt like I was eating a mushroom dish that had chicken bits sprinkled in. As for the ramen itself - I have absolutely no complaints. You get a large enough bowl that it's plenty easy to get the $2 refill of noodles if you aren't stuffed by then. The broth is also much richer than the prepackaged kind those of us not far removed from college remember (not so) fondly. I had the Akamaru Modern, while my girlfriend had the Karaka Miso. The latter had a little more kick to it due to the spice, but both were rich in flavor and really gave depth to the dish. The pork provided a good base for the broth, and the suggested additions are good advice to follow if you're looking for something more with the ramen. The atmosphere is loud - the waiters and chefs are always shouting when dishes are being ordered or served. I can't say whether or not that's culturally correct, as I don't remember much from the last time I went to Japan. In addition, there were plenty of times when it seemed like they were shouting 'onegai shimasu' more for the sake of it than because of any reason. Our waiter was helpful in answering our questions about the menu, and all in all, it's a fun place to eat. Even though we got a decent amount of food, $60 for 2 is a pretty solid deal. As I noted above, my only real complaint is that the appetizers are a bit overpriced, but the food quality was top-notch. I'll definitely be back again in the future.

Perfectly aldente and fresh, you will not want the noodles to stop. Which is fine, cause you can order an extra portion for a few more bucks. I just wish there wasn't such a wait!

I'd tried grabbing lunch here one week ago and on a Saturday at 11am, the line for 1 person was 45 mins so this past weekend, I came armed with my best friend and found the wait for 2 to only be about 20 mins. ÊWe waited at the bar where unfortunately, they don't serve food but we were offered water and nice crispy ramen - I think - which tasted like asian cousins to pretzels. ÊWe were definitely seated within 20 mins and as they showed us to our seats, we saw the layout of the place. ÊThere's one large room that is well decorated with white leather seats/benches that makes the ambience very hip/classy/nice. ÊThere's a second dining area of that room that is larger and much more spare in dcor/atmosphere. ÊThe chairs in this second seating area are funky in that they are completely mismatched with each having its own style. ÊThe chairs and tables in this room did not scream Ramen but what did was the sequined art wall of Japanese men pulling on ropes. ÊWith the A/C on, the sequins move and give a life-like aspect to this rather traditional Japanese caricature art drawing. ÊEven the music playing in the background fits the entire presentation of the restaurant with contemporary/anime like Japanese music. ÊThe bathrooms in the basement lead you by parts of the kitchen where they make the fresh noodles and prepare vegetables, etc. ÊThe bathrooms also are decorated in minimal yet considerate Japanese style with changing neon lighting behind large wall hangings. Ê Now, I'm a huge fan of Tonkotsu ramen. ÊI could eat it probably 5 days a week and be completely fine. ÊAnd the Tonkotsu ramen here is the best I've had in the city so far. ÊJulie and I shared a bowl of Tonkotsu and a bowl of Akamaru and I definitely prefer the Tonkotsu. ÊEverything is the same except the Akamaru comes with a big dollop of special house seasoning in the soup. ÊAs you stir the soup around, the broth takes on a heavier almost beefy spicier (not in chili spicy but Êtaste. ÊI agree with other reviewers about the noodles being on the thin side for me. ÊThey were cooked just right though and slurp very well. ÊYes, if there was a tiny bit more vegetable/meat to garnish the noodle soup, I think this would be a real winner. Ê Crowd is very heavy asian. ÊAnd lines don't seem to deter people from waiting. ÊBoth bowls cost $13 each. ÊI agree that at this price level, Momofuku is definitely a competitor. ÊNot trying to imply that Momofuku's is a bowl of tonkotsu ramen but it's very good ramen in this price range. ÊI've not had any of the appetizers as the ramen bowls are rather large as it is. This would be a good place for a large group, if you make reservations.

A group of us (6) decided to come here for an early dinner on a Wednesday evening. I was the first to arrive so I reserved a table for 6 for 6pm. The hostess let me know that she would not be able to seat us until our entire group was there, and if we are 10 minutes late, she will take our names off. Simple enough since the place was busy and there was a good amount (~15) of people waiting. One of my friends were running late, so I asked the hostess if she could push back our reservations around 6:30 which she gladly did and said to just let her know when our entire party arrived. So as we waited, we grabbed some drinks at the small square shaped bar near the front. Happy hour specials at the bar, 5 - 8 pm, 2 for 1, so I got two Kirins on draft for $6. Not bad!! Our entire party was finally ready, so I let the hostess know, and we only had to wait an additional 5 minutes before being seated. The ambiance of the place is very hip and modern, far from cozy, a bit dark but a fresh look, with the open floorplan, stone floors, and large wood-lacquered tables (communal style). If you come with a small party, you may find yourself sitting at one of the larger 12-16 person tables, sharing it with others. Situated on the far left wall, there are 3-4 large tables that can seat 8-9 people. A nice treat was being able to see the chefs prepare the meals behind a glass partition. Service was pretty good, as our waiter took the time to suggest some appetizers and explain some of the lesser known items to us. Glasses of water were refilled before reaching empty, and the waiter did come by several times to check up on us. It was also interesting to hear all the workers (half of them not being Japanese) shout short Japanese phrases. We ordered several appetizers which only took about 5-10 minutes to be served, each served 2 minutes apart from each other, rather than all at once: 1) Shishito ($7.00) - deep fried Japanese peppers. These peppers (about 20) were small long & thin whole green peppers coated with oil. On the side, a small dish of seasoning, which most of us joked was seasoned salt or better known as MSG. This dish was fairly boring and the only highlight was the seasoned salt that we dipped our peppers in. But what doesn't taste good with MSG? 2) Hirata Chicken Wings (5 pc. for $10) - fried chicken wings with ippudo special black pepper sauce. These are your typical bar-food sized wings. The black seasoning on the chicken was pretty delicious and chicken tender. A tasty dish, but pricey for 5 small pieces of chicken. 3) Samurai Rib ($10) - berkshire pork spare ribs, seasoned with soy based 'tare' sauce, served with kyoto seven-spice chili pepper. Mmmm, these ribs were juicy and tender. Perfectly complimented with a delicious soy-based marinade. Yum! Don't forget to dip your tender pork onto the chili pepper sprinkled around the outer rim of the dish!! For my entree, I ordered the Kogashi Miso ($14) which is tonkotsu based noodle soup, a dark, rich broth made from roasted miso, topped with slices of berkshire pork, fish cake, green bok choy cabbage, and glazed with a layer of oil. This bowl of broth was dark, almost impossible to see what was lurking beneath. The broth was very yummy, ever so slightly creamy thick. I did find the layer of oil sitting on top of the broth a bit disturbing, but it added a nice thin consistency to the thicker broth. I was a bit disappointed with portions as there only seemed to be Êa small-medium portion of noodles, only slightly more than what you would find in your typical Korean instant noodle package. I would have liked the noodles to be thicker, which were only slightly thicker than the Maruchan instant noodles. The noodles were perfectly cooked, al dente, very good but short of amazing. 3-4 pieces of thinly sliced pork sat on top, which was tasty, but again not enough. In all, I didn't find the recommended appetizers to be amazing with the exception of the spareribs which were delish!! The ramen was pretty good but all-around portions were small for the price. We all left a little hungry but happy with our meals. I may want to come again to try one of their more traditional ramens, but I think I'd like to venture and try a few other places before revisiting here.

Yummy, yummy ramen. It's got a more... authentic taste to it's ramen than Momofuku Noodle Bar (great in it's own right). I got the "classic" and the broth is super rich and savory. The noodles are thinner than usual, which I like, and very al dente. The whole package is better made than menkui-tei and menchanko-tei (sorry). At $13 with a very necessary shot of extra pork belly, it'll run you around $16 a bowl for a normal-sized portion. Bit of a splurge, ramen-wise. Appetizers are tasty too. We got the pork buns (can't really compare to Momofuku's because the taste is totally different) - yum, and the chicken wings - more delicate and flavorful than Bon Chon's. There were plenty other appetizers that looked interesting and equally as yummy. Decor was sleek, sexy, dark, cool. Not as grand as Tao, but very comparable. And the servers all chant "Aregato" jointly as you leave - fun. Also funny - the non-Japanese servers all sounded fluent... Service - this is a japanese restaurant. They mixed up our orders but how can you be mad at such exemplary courtesy? Pros - quality ingredients, great presentation, savory dishes, darkly sexy decor Cons - stinginess with ingredients like meat and boiled eggs, at least an hour wait 5 stars is bold but I'm a sucker for Japanese food.

Ok, I think I was a little too harsh on my initial review. I guess it was because I considered Ippudo as the high and almighty and was expecting some out of this world experience. Went to two other ramen joints and quickly realized how much I underappreciated Ippudo's broth. Oh man, that makes a big difference.

Still in a Salt Coma, & I mean that in a good way. ÊLunch is tricky, due to the joint's popularity, but I showed up a few minutes late to meet a friend & thus was seated promptly. ÊI got one of the ramen sets with the pork belly "topping." ÊOh man consider that RECOMMENDED. ÊThere is a lot of shouting-- Itadakimasu! ÊGochisousamadeshita!

The ramen is pretty good. I suggest ordering the "modern" for the first visit and the pork buns. The price is somewhat reasonable. Ê Since Ippudo does not take reservations, the long wait (about an hour) can be unbearable, especially in the tiny bar/waiting area.

Ippudo doesn't really need another review, but Imma write about it regardless! My sister and I hit Ippudo for an early dinner before getting yakitori around the corner at Yakitori Taisho, so we went in with a mission: to get pork buns and ramen (green tea creme brulee was also recommended but given our packed eating itinerary and limited budget we forced ourselves to abstain... maybe next time!). A huge perk: this place is incredibly accessible by metro! The outside is rather inauspicious, but keep your eyes open for a little white "IPPUDO" label on the black canopy! We walked in around 5:30pm and got seated immediately at a bench table -- just a warning, each time a new party gets seated, the whole staff (note: good looking waiters!) yells something in Japanese - Neat! Can be somewhat embarrassing if you don't relish the spotlight... (once you're seated and have witnessed this several times, you realize that other patrons aren't paying any attention to newcomers at all, and it adds a festive spirit!) Service in general was super efficient and friendly, people constantly thanked you etc. in Japanese, and did I mention cute waiters? The space itself is fairly dark (not so good for taking pictures if you don't want to disturb your fellow eaters with the flash) and super mod, with a reddish lighting and cool Japanese artwork/decor -- a fun vibe and I can imagine it would be a great late-night hangout since there's a crowded bar section at the front of the restaurant too. FOOD: The two of us shared an order of their daily special ramen (about $15) and 1 order of pork buns (2 for $8) -- the pork buns were delicious! Just to clarify (because Sis was a little confused when the buns weren't really like bao zi) - they're more like sandwiches than traditional Asian buns (baozi) with the meat/filling enclosed by dough... as in there's a slab of pork (super tender, juicy, flavorful) in one of the open-mouthed buns typically used when eating Peking duck (skin). There was also a white mayonaissey sauce... which added a slight tang, but I actually preferred the pork bun at Momofuku Noodle Bar largely because Momofuku's buns didn't have this extra sauce. The ramen tasted pretty good and the noodles were really silky -- almost too silky and soft, since I guess I'm more accustomed to slightly chewier or more aldente ramen noodles. However the broth was super flavorful. Sis also ordered a cocktail - "Green Tea High" (about $7?) -- which she enjoyed :) Overall, quite tasty, cool ambience, great service -- I wish I had more stomach space + moolah to try more things on the menu!

Finally, an authentic ramen restaurant in America that tastes above average even in Japanese standards! ÊSame taste as the Ippu-do in Japan. ÊThe only downfall is that the NY Ippu-do is a bit expensive compared to the Ippu-do in Japan (almost double the price.) ÊNevertheless, the ramen is authentic and good so why not take the advantage if ppl will keep coming right? ÊAs for now, I'd say the best ramen in America.

This meal has been a long time coming. ÊAfter visiting Japan back in 2004, and experiencing the life-changing event that is Ippudo, I feel it's time to return to the good old days....but in NYC. ÊI remember staying in Yokohama and taking a subway ride, then a cab ride to finally arrive at our destination. ÊAn extremely small and stuffy joint that looks as traditional as one can get. ÊAs you enter, on your left, you'll see a bar with stools with patrons slurping up goodness; and to your right, small stalls seating 4 each with a max occupancy of maybe 20, and that's a slight exaggeration, I mean, this place is small! ÊOur friend ordered for all of us, and pretty much we got the same thing as everyone in the restaurant, Tonkotsu....the ultra rich, brothy goodness made from pork belly, miso, and lots of TLC. ÊMy experience at Ippudo Japan changed my perception of ramen for years to come... Fast forward 6 years, it's December 2010, and I'm in NYC. ÊThe day has finally arrived! ÊAfter 6 agonizingly long years, it's time to engorge on what I believed to be the best ramen on the planet! ÊI never forgot that glistening feeling on my lips after indulging in that steamy bowl, and to this day I spoke about it religiously. ÊSo before we get to the main event, we start off with Fried Shishito Peppers and the highly regarded Steamed Pork Buns similar to that of David Chang's buns from Momofuku (which I've had and adored!) ÊTo say the least, the Shishito Peppers were amazing! ÊLightly fried to achieve the blistered skin, squeeze fresh lemon juice, dip in salt/pepper and kill it! ÊMake sure not to bite your fingers off....you'll need them for the Pork Buns. ÊI'm loyal to Momofuku....one of my greatest experiences to speak of. ÊNo Michelin stars, no bullshit, good food prepared exquisitely with just the right flare. ÊBut these pork buns are remarkable. ÊPillowy-soft, with an almost velvety texture in the pork belly. ÊAbsolutely out of this world. ÊNow I'll need a head to head taste test to crown the champ of the pork buns since it's been 4years from my last visit to Momofuku, but I'm sure they're still up there. Now to the main event.....I ordered the Akamaru Modern with a poached egg. ÊThose that know me, know when a broken egg yolk is a component of a dish or meal, I'm all in! ÊIt comes to our table piping hot. ÊCreamish in color, with beads of fat accumulating around the bowl, then without warning....i break the lightly poached yolk into my spoon, keep it company with some ramen, piece of pork, and some broth.....OMG! ÊThe pork melts in your mouth, blending with the broth and yolk to create yet another flavor profile that spinning your taste buds out of control. ÊPlease please please....slurp your noodles! ÊIt's a sign of enjoyment in the japanese culture, and also introduces air in the mix which livens up the aromas and flavors! ÊAnd plus, when you slurp and get it all over the place, you definitely enjoy it more! Ê Cheers!

BEST ramen bar none. I've been here over 20 times and I have to say it's the best. I've gotten the akamaru modern 19 times and I haven't looked back. Go at off-peak times unless you're ready to wait a good hour or two. There's a bar in the front that serves appetizers so it's not the worst thing in the world to wait. Also the buns are ridiculous. Ridiculous. You can't afford not to come here. You just can't. Service is great as well. When you walk in they shout welcome in Japanese. If you feel the urge to shout with them they like that. Well maybe they don't.

This place is beautiful and delicious, a great spot for a late meal on a weekend night. ÊNo matter what ramen you get, make sure you get the kakuni (pork belly) it'll make it taste that much better. ÊAlso, I love the calpico cocktail they make- anything with Calpico is delicious! ÊOne caveat, of course, is the wait- you can wait anywhere from 45min-1-1/2hours for a table of 2. ÊIt's always packed here, for good reason. ÊIt's still worth it, though, because once you sit down and get your noodles, you'll forget all about how long you waited for it...

Friends warned that I'd become addicted to the ramen at Ippudo. Yea right, I thought. I never had a thing for noodles. They were right. After my first taste of the Classic ramen, I'm officially reformed as an addict. In my first week, I was there at least three times with different recruited friends. Everyone has been won over. The broth is most amazing and so are the hand made noodles. They aren't the curly, chewy, instant noodle kind. No wonder they won't let Êyou take their soup home either. It must be some special recipe. Start with the Classic and move on down the menu. I'm still at the Modern but am enjoying every savory experience. For appetizers, try the lightly fried chicken and soft bean curd. If the dinner wait wasn't so long or front bar so crowded, I'd be there more often. Ippudo's is perfect for cold wintery days like we're having now.

ÊIf you come earlier, then most likely your wait will be shorter. ÊFor a table of four on a Wednesday at around 630p, we waited about 30-45 mins.

Overhyped restaurant with ridiculous waits. It was a 2 hour wait on a Saturday night for 4 people. I really can't believe I waited for noodle soup but it was for a friend's birthday. Vegetarians, beware: all their ramen soups are pork based, broth and all. Their vegetarian soup is $14 and not even worth the money. The only thing that looked good was my friend's pork buns. I echo Pokei's comment about their bathroom- it was disgusting and smelly. Will never go back.

Don't mind spending money on ramen? Go here. It's seriously the best ramen out of the five I've tried (Minca, Setagaya, RaiRai Ken, and Menkuitei), but of all, it's probably the most expensive as well. Go figure. For appetizers, I cannot recommend the braised pork enough. The stewed radish that comes with it has a very nice radish-y flavor, and the pork itself? Fatty, juicy, and most of all, porky, pork. The Karaage is pretty good too, but it doesn't seem like quite enough chicken for how much you're paying. The chef's pickles are also very good, having a slight hint of sweetness to go with the normal vinegar flavor of pickles. The Akamaru ramen is composed of a very thick pork base and has a dollop of their special sauce on top. Wow, so much pork flavor in the broth! But then you look inside and only find one lone piece of pork... which itself isn't particularly noteworthy. The noodles are nice and al dente at the beginning, and as they cook in the piping hot broth, slowly become less and less firm. If you order the extra noodles, make sure you can eat quickly as time is of the essence: As the soup cools, it loses the ability to cook the noodles, and you might end up with more of a doughy, fresh noodle flavor (ick!) than your initial delicious portion of noodles. Not only that, but as the broth gets cool, you might start to notice it begin to solidify: While this is a good indication of a lot of pork fat and pork bones put into the creation of the soup base, it isn't particularly appetizing. Eat quickly without taking a break. Both times I went, the service was extremely polite and attentive. One of the waitstaff took away my chopsticks with my empty bowl, and another noticed there was still food on the table, and brought a new pair out for me. My glass of water was also hardly ever empty... and what's more, they brought out fresh glasses of water each time instead of pouring you new water from a pitcher. Update - 5/30/08: Tried the miso ramen for the first time. Sweeter and lighter than the broth in Akamaru. The cool thing was that both me and my girlfriend's ramen had two (!) slices of pork, rather than the one I'd received in previous visits. The Akamaru ramen still wins out in my book.

The food and service (especially when compared to other ramen places where you just hunker down at a bar) here are great, but be warned that it's surprisingly expensive for ramen.

YUM YUM YUM! Best ramen I've had in NY so far (I'm impatiently waiting for Ichiran to open, it's my fave from Japan) I went here a few months ago after having an uncontrollable ramen craving. My bf and I had spent a year in Asia and had just come back and wanted some comfort food...we just walked in and got seated around 6. I guess we got lucky...we had no idea there were crazy wait times just for some ramen. Now that I've had their ramen I would wait. Ippudo is trendy inside...not a classic looking ramen joint. You do get greeted loudly in Japanese when you're getting seated. Service was prompt and courteous. Our waiter was always there when we needed him and gone when we didn't which is how I like it. We ordered the edamame to start which was perfectly cooked and came with a delicious yuzu salt that you could sprinkle over the edamame...I loved this. Usually the edamame on the bottom is completely saltless so I could just add however much I wanted. Tonkatsu broth is our all time favorite so I ordered the Shiramaru Hakata and my bf ordered the Akamaru ramen. They were both very good. My bf liked mine more and I liked his more. They're very similar except that the Akamaru has a fragrant garlic flavor that balances the sweetness of the pork. The broth is greasy with amazing pork flavor and permeates the noodles which are cooked just right. I loved everything in the ramen, nitamago was delicious and the charshu was succulent and sweet. My only complaint is that my pieces of charshu had way way way toooooo much fat on them and almost no meat. I think I may have gotten a bad piece which is disappointing. My bf said his pieces of pork had a good meat to fat ratio. The price, at around 14 bucks is a bit steep but if you want proper ramen in this city you're going to have to pay...and I gladly will (at least until Ichiran opens)

While the food was good, the waitstaff was incredibly rude. I had a diet coke for lunch that was served in a 10oz glass. With the spicy food I finished the glass and had half of another. When the check came I was charged $6.00 for the drink ($3 each). I kindly asked the server if it was their policy to charge for refills. He laughed and responded, "sir this isn't McDonalds. Of course we charge per drink." I don't even mind being charged twice but that was incredibly rude. I will not be going back for six dollar soft drinks or terrible analogies any time soon.

thin fresh noodles. the broth savory yet light, did not like the flavors as much when mixed together by the bottom of the bigger-than-my-head-bowl. The pork made me squeal, I was dining alone.

We waited for about an hour to get seats one Wednesday night. ÊLast time I waited for over an hour to get into a ramen place (in LA), it was worth the wait. ÊUnfortunately, I can't say the same for this place. ÊWe started with the teba gyoza appetizers (chicken wings stuffed with meat). ÊAt $10 for 2 pieces, i was expecting chicken wings on steroids, but they weren't, just two tiny chicken wings. ÊTasted good, but they were gone in two bites. Ê Then we got our ramen. ÊDinner buddy got the classic, I got the special (forgot the name). ÊThe noodles were a bit tough, but I think that's because I started digging in when I got it because I was so hungry. ÊIf I had let it sit a little, it might have tasted better. ÊThe broth was ok, nothing special to write home about. Ê I like a rich broth. ÊI was not wowed by this bowl as I was in LA and at a ramen chain in Tokyo. On a side note, I'm not sure if I am weird or have the wrong impression or what. ÊWe charged the amount on a credit card and left the tip in cash behind the charge slip. ÊWe got up and left and got held up a little with traffic in the front of the restaurant. ÊDinner buddy said our waiter tapped him on the shoulder and said "excuse me," Êlooked in the restaurant bill holder thing behind the charge slip, saw the cash, and shook his head and turned around. ÊDid he really follow us out to demand a tip? ÊI really hope that wasn't the case.

another spot I haven't been too in a while so I will give you an update after a recent visit. the hostess was cute and welcoming. Êluckily the wait was not long at all and we sat down immediately. the ramen remains delicious, great savory broth, I recommend akumaru modern with the pork belly chasu, went for lunch this time so I tried the lunch set, which is a selection fried chicken, eel, roast pork or cod roe over a small rice bowl. ÊI had the eel which was flavorful but didn't care for it much when my ramen arrived. Highly recommend but be aware the wait can be long but worth it.

Pros: The best ramen you can get in New York City. I'm a big fan of Hakata-Style ramen they serve, and maybe that's the reason why I dislike other styles of ramen served in other ramen joints in New York. But nonetheless, the quality of ramen here is superb. The portion might be a bit small for some people, but there is an option to add more noodles at an extra cost of $2.The pork buns are indeed tasty, but I wouldn't call it "mindblowingly" good. The ambiance is quite nice and the fact that the servers yell out "Irasshaimase!!" when you enter is a small plus. Cons: Over time I personally feel like the quality of Ippudo's ramen has deteriorated. Then you might ask why it's still getting four stars. It's because the ramen is still that good. There is no other place in the Tri-state area that can compete against this place in terms of taste. As a result, the wait here is always long, especially during the dinnertime rush hours. No reservation means everyone has to wait. The only time I didn't have to wait to be seated was when I went there around 11 p.m. Overall: Ramen is a commoner's food in Japan and I believe it should stay that way. Ippudo NY did a great job of adding some luxury to ramen, but sometimes I feel like It's not something you should wait for 45+ minutes and pay nearly $20 for. Nonetheless, this is still the best ramen in New York and I will be keep going back to Ippudo unless some another superb ramen joint opens in New York or I move to Japan.

delicious. amazing. yummmmm. after being sorely disappointed by momofuku, i know its difficult to find great ramen in new places. but look no futher, becuase Ippudo is grand. Êi had the shoyu ramen (someone said they only have hakata, but that is a fat @$$ LIE) with an extra side of charsui and every ingredient of my bowl was devoured as it was divine. service was great and the price point is solid for manhattan. will def do it again when in town.

Holy. Crap. This place is awful. Their ramen is the worst I have had in the city. The noodles have the same flavor and consistency of Cup ramen. They give you the smallest slice of pork possible. Other ramen places in the village give you two slices of pork that are much thicker than the measly piece you get at ippudo. It is so small you could mistake it for cold cuts. If they did not have such an ostentatious dining room they would not need to charge me $14 for crappy ramen. The service is good, fast and polite. And the space is nice to look at. But why would I want to wait for a seat and then overpay for bad food just because of the service and the decor? I will not be going back to ippudo, and I urge every yelper who thinks that this overpriced crap is delicious to try some of the better ramen places in the village. here is a good rule of thumb: The level of decor and sophistication is inversely proportional to the quality of the food.

On 4th ave bet 9th & 10th, Ippudo, is an excellent addition to the noodle explosion in the east village. They dont take reservations which might leave you waiting but it's worth it. It's the kind of place where the hostess stand and bar is in the front and the main dining area is hidden as a surprise in back. When the hostess leads you to the main room you get greeted with a shouts from the servers & the cooks. The space has a sushi counter style bar where you face the people preparing your food. The rest of the space is lit low filled with large wood communal tables and a few private booths against the wall that seat up to 6 comfortably. Immediately upon being seated the server made his presence known and ensured me that he is ready whenever I am. ÊThe menu consisted of smaller appetizers and mainly their specialty, noodles. I ordered a sake which gets served in a slender glass overflowing set in a wooden box(my fav). Happy with my drink I proceeded to order the original ramen with pork & boiled egg. Seriously only a couple of minutes after ordering, a large steaming bowl of warm noodley goodness was set in front of me. ÊI took one slurp of the spicy broth and smiled. It was so tasty, the broth was loaded with flavor and the noodles were very fresh. The service was attentive, prompt and friendly. The food, well, I can only really say anything about the noodles since that's all I ordered. The ramen is super good here, better than Momofoko. There could have been more meat but overall I was totally satisfied and stuffed. Yum!

On a Sunday night, the wait time was about 30-40 minutes for a party of 4, although we were seated in about 20 minutes - yay! ÊAs you walk to your table, the waitstaff yell something in Japanese, essentially like a welcoming cheer. ÊIt's inviting. ÊThe furniture was simple, which I really liked, and our chairs were two separate pieces, but when combined, it becomes a loveseat. ÊAs appetizers, we ordered gingko, chef's omakase appetizer and the cucumber. ÊWe ordered a spicy ramen to share, which was pretty good. ÊThe broth was more authentic than what was served at momofuku, which i enjoyed. ÊWould definitely go back and try other dishes!

So when I was in NY with some friends, one of them found this place on YELP, so we decided to try it. Glad we did! It was delicious. I don't remember what I ordered though, but it was super bomb! The wait was quite long, actually it was really long. About a 2 hour wait. When you walk inside, there's the host counter and to your right, there's a wall full of different colored/types of bowls (or was it plates?), the restroom is downstairs. The place was quite small, but once we were taken inside and seated, the surrounding decor was really nice and interesting. All the workers that you passed by would say Hi or Bye to you in Japanese, which was really cool. I did not see any Asian workers, since it's a Japanese restaurant. HAHA When we got our food, we devoured it in less than 20 minutes. The service was very well trained and nice. By far, this is the best ramen I've ever had. If I'm ever in NY, I shall stop by this place again. It's a MUST!

Ippudo has the best ramen I have ever tatsed. ÊEverything, from the noodles, to the broth to the toppings to the presentation are top notch and 5 stars. My favourite is the pork based modern one, and I always get an extra side of the pork. ÊHowever, the wait for a table is inevitably crazy long and so minus 1-star.

13 bucks for ramen.. pricey, but it IS really good. Êyou're also paying for the ambience, which has a kind of rustic chic traditional Japanese feel to it. Ê i've really only tried the akamaru modern -- make sure you get your noodles done a little firm so they don't become mush by the end of your bowl! Êthese noodles are handmade and thin, unlike the curly thicker ones you might find in your cup o' noodles or at other ramen places. Êthe broth is porky and amazing, and the pork belly pretty much melts in your mouth. Ê try the hirata buns too if you've got room in your belly!

Hey! I like ramen a lot. and this is pretty good ramen. Among the best. However, because of that, it's crowded. and you might have to wait a while if you arrive later than 6pm. and that's when I decide that I'm just not going to wait that long for ramen and go somewhere else nearby for ramen (menkuitei usually) and that's minus one star. So here's the deal. if you want to eat good ramen, go here during an off hour. otherwise, you will either have to wait a while.

Hm this was closer to a 3.4 so I rounded down. The decor and ambience was excellent, and the pork buns were soft, tender, and delicious. Now, the ramen. I thought the broth in the classic (and one other, the second one on the menu) were way too salty (especially in the bottom). I much prefer the tonkotsu broth in Menkui Tei, which is a 3 minute walk away. The service is always friendly and the waiters know the menu very well. BTW - there is a VEGETARIAN ramen but it's not on the menu, you have to ask for it. I'd definitely come here more often if the prices weren't so hard to swallow.

Ippudo is an extremely popular, gimmicky place that's worth visiting for the peppy atmosphere and if you want to combine your ramen eating experience with a nice time out. That is, you could bring a date or a larger party here. Otherwise, I wouldn't come just for the ramen. For starters, there's always a wait, and that just sucks. Once you're in, you often have to share a table with other people. If you like meeting strangers and chatting about what you're eating, you're golden. If you're like me and can't stand that shit and want to be left alone to enjoy your meal without tourists commenting on "how good!" it is, etc., you may be annoyed that there's no place to sit at the bar. The chefs yell hello (irrashaimase!) when you come in, which is very Japan-y, though they don't do it there. Cute special effects, anyway. The ramen itself probably is among the best in the city, and a Japanese friend of mine asserted that it's the only decent ramen in New York at all, with the caveat that Ippudo is an international chain. Chain ramen is never going to be the best that there is, but Japanese style ramen probably wouldn't make it in New York--or, at least, the dining scene here isn't ready for it yet. If all you want is a nice bowl of noodles to comfort you, Ippudo isn't worth the trouble, but it's certainly a place you should visit at least once. No reservations.

Went on a Thursday at 2pm and waited about 20 minutes for 2 people to get seated at a communal table with a couple other strangers. ÊI liked the ambiance. ÊHigh energy, everyone yells a greeting to you in Japanese when you walk in. ÊI actually don't remember the name of the ramen that I ordered but it's the "original one that everyone gets". ÊProbably the Shiromaru Hakata Classic Ramen. ÊThe wait for the food was just about right. ÊThe food... was delicious. ÊThe broth is rich, deep with flavor, all of the components cooked just right. ÊMy gripes, however.... portions are SMALL. ÊI felt bad for my brother who is about a foot taller than me and gave him most of my noodles so he wouldn't starve. ÊPrices are EXPENSIVE for what you get (I'm used to paying about $7 for a huge bowl of high quality ramen)- although I admit that I was prepared to pay the higher than usual price as I was on vacation. ÊThe wait was fine but I definitely would NOT wait 2 hours to eat here so no, I wouldn't come back for dinner. ÊFor a weekday lunch, after the lunch rush? ÊYea, I wouldn't mind coming back. ÊI also would recommend coming alone or in a group of 2. ÊThe smaller the group, it seems, the less the wait. ÊAlso, the service was attentive and the waiters were very kind. As for the rating, the experience was about a little over a 3* as it wasn't very memorable to me (I'm sure my 3 rating won't hurt the 1000+ reviews this place already has). ÊPrice- 2*, wait- 3*, portions- 2*, flavor of food- 4.5*. Overall it's a place where you should try at least once and gloat to others, "Yea, Ippudo? ÊI've been there."

Synopsis: Decor - 5 Food - 1 Sanitation - 1 Service - 2 Will I come back again? NO. Decor: The decor was fabulous and simple. LOVE the bathrooms, too. Sanitation: TERRIBLE. What in the world are the chefs doing wearing ÊFLIP-FLOPS in the kitchen?! Two chefs walked out of the kitchen wearing flip flops. This is unsanitary as well as a health code violation. (Also, one of the chefs was in dire need of a pedicure. He had black stuff on the side of several toes, EWH!). Food: The expectation was that I would get a better bowl of Ramen than I would at home if I cooked it myself (and believe me, I can make EXCELLENT ramen). ÊI'm not sure I can say I got that. I got good Ramen (broth was good), noodles were thin and different and met my expectations but the PRICE was WELL *not* worth it. Each bowl is ~ $13 for Ramen?! I can buy a whole box. My boyfriend got the traditional bowl while I got the most popular choice (w/ the special sauce). Also, I had ONE piece of thinly sliced pork while he had TWO; I thought we are going through a FLOUR shortage, not PORK. It was RIDICULOUS. Additionally, we ordered the fried chicken for an appetizer; it was great but $8 for 6 popcorn pieces of tender fried chicken?! That's over a dollar a piece. I know food costs are going up but I can buy a WHOLE chicken for that price. PLEASE dont take me as being cheap bc I'm not but OVERPRICED food like this WILL NOT GET ME COMING BACK. Service: typical Asian restaurant where servers were soft spoken and seemed friendly but the server asked us if we wanted a dessert menu and never brought it OUT! She also took forever to return with our check (passed us 3 times before she gave it to us). Not so good.

I was excited to hear that a new noodle shop opened in NYC especially after hearing they serve Tonkotsu Ramen. Visiting my grandmother in Hakata every year, I used to always ask my mom to take me to Yatai in evenings to have Tonkotsu Ramen. I had a very high expectation for Ippudo. Decor is modern and lounge like. ÊI was seated in the middle of the restaurant, on a counter like table with few other Japanese couples. ÊAlthough I thought ordering appetizers would be kind of weird at a noodle shop, I decided to give it a go, and ordered Ippudo organic salad and Beef Tataki. ÊBoth were pretty good, but Beef Tataki, I felt was little over-priced for the quantity. I ordered regular Tonkotsu Ramen ( don't recall the exact name) and my husband ordered spicy Tonkotsu Ramen. I liked my ramen. ÊSimple and not as greasy as I expected it to be. My husband liked his also, but complained that there wasn't enough noodles for him. Also, his spicy Ramen didn't have roast pork in it. So, if you are ordering the spicy one (not miso one.), order it with roast pork. If you are really hungry, order it with extra noodles! I liked this place for what it is. Service was great. I would go back for the experience rather than the food.

This is definitely a worth going restaurant. You might want to go there earlier as it's always packed. It opens at 5pm for dinner, we reached the restaurant at 5:30pm and it was packed with patrons already. We waited 45minutes in line and finally able to get seated. Personally I don't mind waited for 45minutes because this restaurant is offering good food and good services. We ordered two appetizers (steamed pork bun and rice burger) and two bowl of ramen. Not only that their broth is good, I think the texture of noodles is good too. Their rice burger tasted better than the rice burger from MOS (a chain fast food restaurant from Japan). Their pork is very juicy, and the taste blended in well with the bun. Everything we ordered was so tasty that I kept telling myself that I need to come back next time! If you are looking for good ramen, don't hesitate to give this a try!

I LOVE this place. Like, LOVE. ÊAs the other reviewers said the pork buns are incredible, I could eat several of them. Ive never been to Japan, Ive never had ramen anywhere else. I just cant possibly imagine ramen tasting better than this. The portions are enormous, the broth is smooth with a very rich flavor, the pork belly melts in your mouth, the egg is right in that in between cooked and gooey stage where its soft yet it still stays together, the texture of the noodles is perfect. Not too soft not too chewy. You feel all full and warm and fuzzy when youre done. Its so worth the wait but if you go early enough (like 6 or before) you will barely wait, if at all.

Undeniably, Ippudo is one of the most famous chain stores in Japan. But will it ever occur to me as the best ramenya in Japan? I doubt so. On the other hand, it can be seen as an outstanding ramen restaurant in NYC. Still, I do not think the ramen is the best one in the city. The reason I am giving Ippudo a four star is that I consider ramen as cheap and filling, and that was not the image I got from Ippudo. Interesting points are that Ippudo's tonsoku (pork leg bones) soup has a very strong flavor and its noodles are unconventionally thin. And what the f is wrong with all the ramen restaurants in NYC that do not serve gyoza??

5 stars for our waiter and the other servers 3.5 stars for the food 2 stars for value 0 stars for the power-tripping hostess The hostess needs a serious attitude adjustment. ÊHer job is to take names, let people know how long the wait will be and to be a HOST. ÊBeing snippy, rude and giving attitude is not how to go about it. ÊI cannot even give her a pass on it being super busy--it was early on a weeknight and while there were people waiting, it wasn't a packed house. ÊNevertheless, I bit my tongue and said nothing since I was taking a good friend out for a belated birthday dinner. ÊI had been to Ippudo once before and he had never been, so I thought it would be nice to take him to one of the most popular ramen houses in the city. Ê We were told it would be a 15 minute wait (shockingly, it really was only 15 minutes). ÊThe people who came in after us were told it would be up to an hour. ÊI did not understand why seating for the 2-3 people would be almost an hour. Ê A friend of mine (who is and speaks Japanese) once overheard the front of house people discussing in Japanese how even though there were seats available, they were going to make the customers wait longer. ÊIppudo is a ramen house--not a club where partygoers are made to wait in long lines so that the club looks like it's the place to be. Ê In any event, after we were seated, we had a wonderful waiter who was very helpful, gracious and friendly. ÊThe food arrived quickly. ÊThe Hirata buns were yummy and I enjoyed the savory broth that Ippudo uses for their Shoyu ramen. ÊUnfortunately, the noodles were skimpy and not as al dente as they were during a previous visit. ÊMy friend enjoyed his meal so I am happy for that at the very least. ÊFor me, I doubt I will be returning. ÊSpending over $50 after tax and tip for 2 people on 2 bowls of ramen and 1 app (not including any drinks) is way too much. ÊAlso, $2 for an extra egg seems ridiculous when most ramen houses include an egg with the meal. Ê I am still on the hunt for great, cheap ramen in NYC. Ê:o)

I've never been to Japan (though I've lived in Hawaii, which is so overrun with Japanese, it's close) so I don't know what "authentic" or "good" ramen is supposed to taste like but I do know this.. this stuff is (almost) to die for. ÊLike all of the other reviewers have noted, much thicker broth and I have yet to find another ramen place that offers broth as thick and flavorful as Ippudo. But why the four stars? ÊThe wait. ÊSave for early/late meal times on weekdays, expect to wait over an hour, possibly upwards of 2 - 3 hours. ÊOf course, this can be easily spent at a nearby bar (and there are many) building your appetite with drinks (or staving off your hunger by eating a first dinner). Bottom line: Extremely unique; thick, flavorful broth; Plan ahead for the long wait to get in.

i think this is by far my favorite ramen place, ever! Êthey make there own ramen too! Êyou can check out the machine and the broth room in the basement level. Ê i really like my ramen HOT (temperature) and they serve it HOT! Êthey offer tonkotsu broth or shoyu broth, but tonkotsu is the only way to go. Êthe broth is creamy looking and very rich...SO good! Êi get the number 1 which is the standard ramen with the tonkotsu broth (white bowl) there's another one forgot what its called, but its got a spicy sauce and it comes in a red bowl vs. the white bowl. Êits not spicy spicy sauce, its some kinda salty semi-spicy paste. Êi don't like this one as much cuz its a lil more fattier. Êmy friend ellen really loves this one because she think it has more flavor than number 1. Êim not a huge fan of this version of their ramen.

Absolute best ramen in the city, beats the HELL out of Momofuku, and the steady stream of Japanese natives in this place ought to be a sign. ÊVery stylish dining room with an open kitchen, booths, and some communal seating. ÊThe staff is friendly and more or less applauds when you come in or exit the restaurant, and keeps up a lively conversation while working. ÊThe chicken bun appetizers are incredible, too.

best ramen i've ever had outside of Japan? you betcha. worth the wait? surprisingly... YES. went again last night for one of my roommates' birthdays. (yay for friends who go early to reserve a spot!) we ordered the samurai ribs for an app (SO GOOD) and each ordered the akamaru modern. i also opted to get the Bakudan ippudo original spicy paste as an add on - not worth the $2 to get average hot sauce. delicious broth, noodles, accoutrements (yum egg and fatty pork), and company. fabulous night.

40 minutes of wait time outside was a small price to pay for the best Japanese ramen I've had in my entire life. Yes, folks, Ippudo does live up to the hype as the reigning king of ramen establishments in Manhattan. I came with 2 friends, and we ordered family style, so I was able to try the special ramen, the traditional tonkotsu ramen, and the modernized tonkatsu ramen. We also ordered a pork belly appetizer to start. ÊThe appetizer was innovative but tasty, the broth was divine, the egg was a perfect combination of cooked and uncooked, and the tonkatsu was nice and fatty - just the way I like it. The space itself is very cool, too, and surprisingly upscale for a ramen restaurant. I'm already looking forward to my next trip to New York so that I can try all of the other types of ramen and menu items. My new (or perhaps not so new) motto: Will travel for food!

dear ippudo, thank you for reminding me what AMAZING ramen tastes like. it's been almost two years since i moved to the east coast, and about just as long since i've had ramen that leaves me so content and wanting more afterwards. i came here over the weekend with fellow yelper kevin c. and a couple of visiting friends. as a visitor myself to nyc, i decided it was finally time to see what all this ippudo hype was about. we got there around 6pm and put our party of four down on the waiting list, and we were told it would be about a 60-75min wait. we decided to do some shopping and came back after an hour and waited about 15 mins in the bar area before being seated. the bar is a pretty cool place, with a counter display made up of instant ramen packs and a wall display featuring various cultural looking ramen bowls. the full bar also features a long list of sakes, so take your pick and drink your worries away. on top of that, if you get hungry during your long wait, you can order some appetizers to carry you over til you get seated. so when we first sit down, we decide to order these remarkable pork buns that everyone seems to be talking about. i'm sitting there thinking it's like the pork buns you normally see in dim sum. but when the appetizer comes out.. wow am i in for a shock. it's like some sort of modern take on pork buns. yummy tender pork layered with lettuce and mayo and sandwiched between a folded circle of bun dough in what can best be described as a cross between a taco, a steamed pork bun, and some sort of sandwich. exactly what type of restaurant did i walk into?! but it was surprisingly good.. who knew mayo would go well on a pork bun? reminds me of chicken sandwiches that are known for their crispy chicken + lettuce + mayo combinations. but 100x better. i was about to order their classic tonkatsu ramen, but then i saw their special ramen of the day.. a SPICY ramen! people who know me know that i'm a sucker for spicy. i can't get enough of it and i'll almost always order my ramen spicy if i can, even if it's not traditionally done that way. when the bowl came out, i could see why people love ippudo so much. first off, the broth. sooo many tastes and flavors coming out of that one bowl. what is this fantabulous taste?! could it be coming from this tiny puddle of broth in the bottom of my spoon?? so while enjoying this tasty broth, i also happened across this piece of heaven that literally melted in my mouth. what was it, you ask? it was pork chashu! except they were thick slices of pork, complete with fatty meat and so tender i almost didn't know it was meat if i hadn't looked at it before eating the next piece. all the other ramen places i'd ever been to only gave thin slices of pork chashu, and none were as tender as this. but all too soon, this explosion of taste in my mouth came to an end. i looked down at my bowl and realized there was no more ramen left and i felt a sadness come over me. why were the bowls so small?? for $13, i expected something more even though i was already full. it's just that my greedy self wanted more more MORE of this tasty goodness. sighh if only the world were perfect. my only other gripe is that the noodles here are a bit thinner than normal ramen noodles. in my world, bigger is better.

Went on a Thurs night. Be forewarned, the wait is ridiculous. At LEAST 1 hour 15 minutes. We were there for 3 hours (cause we changed the number of ppl in our party) but aside that the wait is long nevertheless. Had the akamaru ramen with a tako wasabi (raw octopus with wasabi) appetizer. They were delicious. But I've had better ramen before. The ramen noodles are unique though. Thin and stringy, but with a strong texture. You can also order a second helping of noodles to be added to your bowl for an extra $2. I personally ordered extra noodles twice, but I eat a lot. The environment itself if very nice and the waiters are really cool. I would go back.

OMG! This was my first time at Ippudo and I really liked it. This place has everything I need to rate 5 stars - Excellent food, nice bar in the front, attentive wait staff, unique interior and great music! Our first trial last night, we had to give up because of the long wait and we had a 8pm show to go to. We came back the following day at 11:55am and the wait was 30-40 minutes. Not too bad. It was worth the wait. We tried Yamitsuki Goma Kyuri (cucumber with sesami oil and ground sesami & paprika sprinkled on top) as an appetizer. It was very creative, healthy and tasty. No wonder it was named "Yamitsuki" = "get hooked" or "addictive" in Japanese. Luckily we were seated at the counter and I saw the whole process of preparing Yamitsuki Cucumber so I will recreate it at home for my pleasure. As for Ramen, we tried Akamaru Modern and Wasabi Shoyu. They were both really good but Akamaru Modern impressed me more. I really wanted to try the "Pork Bun" but had no room in my tammy. Unlike my another very favorite Ramen place "Santouka Ramen", ÊIppudo has so many menu items other than Ramen dishes that make me want to try. ÊSince I liked their food so much, I purchased their $25 really cool "I Love Ramen" T-shirt.

am i the only one who's not a fan? came for lunch and there was barely a line (win!). I had the akamura modern and it made me sick. the broth was too... heavy, clouding the interplay of flavors in the bowl. Noodles weren't sproingy, but they were al dente. big difference.

Overall: 3.5 Ambiance: 4 oh my lord...can we talk about pork buns for a second. ÊThey were absolutely delish! ÊThe best part was I was able to sit at the food bar and watch them prepare the the whole dish right in front of me. ÊThey take these amazing fatty pieces of pork and saute them in that spicy, yet a little sweet sauce and layer it with a couple pieces of lettuce and a spicy mayo and stuff it in a bun. ÊThe bun was warm and amazing. I also ended up watching the chefs fill up their bottle full "spicy mayo" with something that looked like kewpie-that amazing Japanese mayo) ÊAfter some digging, I guess there is a version of kewpie that has mustard in it (karashi), so I'm pretty sure that's what they used in their mayo sauce. Either way..it was bomb. ÊThe pork was cooked to perfection and warmed up the lettuce and mayo to make the perfect bite. ÊThis was definitely good stuff. Now...on to the main dish. ÊI tried the Akura Modern with the addition of Nitamago (seasoned salt boiled egg). ÊThe egg was simple delicious, they cooked it just enough so that the cook was still in a cross between solid and runny. ÊIt was perfect and made me smile =). ÊThe ramen was delicious, but the broth was wayyy too salty for my liking. ÊI don't know if they put msg in there, but it sure taste like it. ÊIt got to the point, where i just stopped eating even though my stomach wasn't completely satisfied. ÊEase up on the salt, or whatever sodium based product you're using. ÊIt's killing the dish. Overall, the place was pretty good. ÊThe pork buns are definitely worth the trip down here. ÊRamen, I was pretty disappointed in, but the egg saved a part of the dish. Overall, the restaurant was a 3.5. The overall ambiance was super cool. ÊEveryone, including non-Japanese waiters & chefs, spoke Japanese! ÊIt seemed like it was a pre-req to work there. ÊThey would greet every customer in Japanese when they walked in the restaurant, and genuinely seemed excited that customers were coming in. ÊThe restaurant definitely had a Japanese Sushi/Bar place that gave a cool vibe!

Rated #2 for ramen in NY and highly recommended by multiple friends, my expectation was high for Ippudo. ÊHowever, the ramen noodles were not as good as other places in NY. ÊMen Kui Tei is probably still #1 for me. Ê(I have yet to try Totto). ÊIn addition, Momofuku and Ramen Setagaya are better than Ippudo. Ê I ordered the Akamaru Modern and my husband ordered the Kogashi Miso Ramen. ÊThe type of noodle used varies for each dish. ÊThe Akamaru Modern used a very thin noodle that I have never had in a ramen dish. ÊThe texture and thickness reminded me of Shanghainese noodles. ÊIn addition, the broth was not as rich in pork flavor as reviews have mentioned. ÊThere was definitely a lot of salt though! ÊOn the plus side, Ippudo offers a second serving of noodles for $2 as long as you leave behind enough soup in the bowl. I am a ramen noodle purist and judge a restaurant only by the quality of its ramen noodles. ÊThe noodle and soup broth at Ippudo do not compare to other ramen places. ÊHowever, it is worth highlighting other aspects of Ippudo. ÊIf you are going on a date and want to eat noodles at a reasonable price (~20pp not including drinks), this place has a great vibe. ÊThe seats around the communal table can be joined to create a loveseat for two. ÊIt is Japanese fusion and contemporary music in the background provides a lively atmosphere. ÊThere is small bar at the waiting area where you can purchase $6 beers or other Asian drinks like plum wine, sake and soju. ÊLastly, the service is great with many waiters and waitresses ready at your request. ÊThey are not assigned to tables so you can quickly address your needs.

To be fair, I give it a 3.5. Highlights: The Yuzu drink, on the rocks The Chashu and the tonkotsu broth of the Shiromiso ramen were fantastic BUT: the 45 minute wait to be seated at the counter was SO not worth it. The prices are absolutely ridiculous. I mean, Ippudo's website claims that ramen is Japanese soul-food and I wholeheartedly agree. In my mind, though, soul-food should be comforting (and cheap). It should NOT leave me sweating about having to drop bank on a bowl of ramen when I only have an unpaid internship. Period. P.S. the waiters/chefs were all awesomely izakaya-esque and attractive.

dave and i finally got a chance to eat at ippudo after many failed attempts over the past few weeks. we waited 1.5 hrs on a tuesday night to get 2 seats at a 6 seat table. let me just say, that in general, ramen is meant to be a high quality fast food experience, and not a wait for 1.5 hrs for a shared table experience. the service was cheerful but ultimately lacking because when we finally got seated we noticed that there were several empty seats in the restaurant, and once we were seated we had to wait another 40 minutes to actually get our bowl of ramen. onto the food. we ordered the kakuni (pork belly - 2 pieces) and the ippudo "special" egg appetizer. the pork belly was served on a wasabi sauce, and was lukewarm and not that satisfying given that for the same $9 at any chinese restaurant, you could get an entire entree of the same quality pork belly (but actually warm). the $8 egg appetizer was anything but special. It was basically 2 eggs cooked tamago sushi style, cut in rolls with the word "ippudo" written on the largest piece. $8 for what amounted to 6 bites of scrambled eggs. dave and i both ordered the shiromaru ramen, which we were hoping would make up for the lengthy wait and the poor appetizers. it did neither. the soup is a solid tonkatsu soup that is rich and complex, but it was served literally with a small handful of ramen noodles (too thin and not cooked enough), random sprinkling of cabbage pieces, and 2 slices of pork. very bare, and unlike any bowl of ramen I ever recall eating in japan (and dave and i averaged 3 bowls of ramen/day during our last trip to tokyo). i was pretty excited to hear that another japanese ramenya was coming to the US (after santouka and setagaya). this place, however, is neither popular in japan nor should it be in the US. santouka is still #1 in my book (especially the one in shinjuku), and is followed by setagaya and men kui tei here in nyc. i would have to think hard to even include ippudo in my top 5 ramen spots in nyc. very overrated and definitely not worth any wait time at all. only reason it gets more than 1 star is because the broth is pretty good and because i have never yet given a 1 star rating before.

You should always try something once - like Ippudo - then remind yourself that you need not go back again - cos you can get better utility outside of $16 than on a bowl of starchy noodles with a few morsels of meat. ÊMan - you could probably buy a whole pound of meat at that price.

Their wait times can sometimes be ridiculous for a bowl of ramen, but it's worth coming here, and when you need ramen, you need ramen. Try the grapefruit squeeze and alcohol concoction. I also like the Shoyu (soy sauce) ramen and the salad with a side of shrimp.

i couldnt rate this place more than 2 stars for a variety of reasons, even though their ramen is pretty good. 1. you will not be able to be seated unless everyone in your party arrives. in which case it can result in a VERY length wait. 2. the ramens are expensive, even though they are good, they are not 15$ a bowl good. keep in mind if you dont order extra toppings, which can easily be more than 5$, they will give you 2 slices of pork if you order the pork ramen. so dont expect to be filled in you came in with a empty stomach or thin wallet. 3. one of the special apps we order was fried shrimp, 13$, which was 4 pieces of large (not jumbo) shrimp with some scallions. tasted good, but would I pay $3+ for ONE piece of shrimp? would you??? Êthe same quantity applied to other dishes too. even the ramen. so in the end. 14$ ramen containing 2 slices of pork and half an egg (nothing else), plus 4 shrimps costing 13$ for apps. I will not come back.

IPPUDO! How can you make ramen taste sooo goood?!?!? I've been a fan of this place for a long time and it baffles me how I still haven't reviewed this place! I still remember the first time I came to this place. It had only been a month since it opened and as soon as I read the blogs and articles about the new ramen restaurant in NYC franchised by the Ramen King of Japan himself I knew I had to go. This place is amazing to me. One of my favorites. Here's my breakdown Decor: The designer of this restaurant must have been very creative to think of using household items that we all have around our house but to display it in a way that is very artistic. ÊYou'll find the Wall of Bowls from around Japan and possibly China, the Japanese Kanji attached all over the wall, the use of dried ramen noodles as decoration at the bar table tops or The bamboo like tree you'll find in the middle of the restaurant. The look is very modern but don't feel obliged to dress up. Service: You'll find yourself being greeted in Japanese everywhere and anywhere you walk. The waiters I've had have always been friendly and informative constantly updating me on food arrivals and how my meal is. There is although ONE thing that makes the service here stand out from many other restaurants for me. They REFILL my water without me asking! Even better, they refill my water before it ever gets empty! What the??? I know it's something so small and so simple but a place that takes the time and effort despite how busy they are to refill my water before I even finish it is a great restaurant in my book. FOOD: Oh the food. The Akamaru Modern. A pleasure and a delight consuming a bowl full of broth that has been slowly developing its many flavors for many hours. Pork so tender it melts in your mouth. This is due to the many hours that thin slice of pork sits in the the broth ,simmering and slowly being broken down to its melt in your mouth state. Noodles that have been hand made and pulled to ensure that every slurp you take is soaked with the heavenly broth it's sitting in. This bowl of ramen is soo good and soo unique I have yet to taste a bowl that can be compared to. The ramen king has fine tuned this bowl to fit the tastes of America and it has been tuned well! TO TOP IT OFF THE DESSERT! This place not only has one of my favorite bowls of ramen but also one of my favorite servings of dessert! Green Tea Ice Cream topped with Mascarpone cheese. The most interesting and tasteful combination of ice cream and cheese, a maple like tasting crust, a drizzle of honey topped with pieces of chocolate. Unlike other desserts that leave you feeling heavy and full, the use of green tea ice cream keeps this dessert feeling light and clean. Taking a bite full of all these ingredients just engulfs your mouth with a combination of different flavors that balance out very nicely. Sweet, Crunchy, Cold, Rich, Clean and Creamy. What more is there? My testimonial to this place does not just end with me or these 1300+ reviews but also through the chain effect I have started with this place. After bringing my friends to this place they told their friends, and then they told their friends and co workers who told their friends and co workers and so forth. A place not to miss if your in the NY area. TIPS: Try to arrive either at Lunch or at the beginning of the Dinner service or else expect long waits and sore calves. Weekends tend to be busy whether it's lunch or dinner so arriving at the beginning of service is key. With over 1300+ reviews at 4 stars it couldn't be anything else but busy.

I would give this place a 0 star if I could. First, guys, this is NOT authentic ramen. Anyone from Japan can tell you this. The noodles they use are Chinese egg, not Japanese, and trust me there is a difference. The soup is good, but not the kind they have in Tokyo. The Ippudo in Tokyo is far, far better. And they are considered a "decent" chain; the very best ramen shops don't even compare to Ippudo. I give them 1 star because, well, Yelp doesn't have a 0, and the saketinis were innovative. Still was not worth the 1 hr wait for below mediocre ramen. I weep for the NYCers that line up to go here and think this is good Japanese grub. We have far more pride in our ramen than this establishment professes to have.

Mouth-watering ramen that definitely hits the spot. ÊThe broth definitely has body and is packed with flavor. ÊA tad bit pricey for ramen, considering I am used to ramen for 6-7 dollars in LA/Torrance in California but sometimes its worth it when you are so far from home!

i don't know how they make their noodles, but these were the best noodles i've ever had for ramen. Êat first, bite it was odd. Êi was not used to the texture or firmness level, but after a few bites i was hooked. Êthe firmness level is superb and the noodle retains the flavor of the broth very well. had the deep fried chili's...amazing had the black pepper chicken wings, pretty tasty. this place isn't huge, so expect a wait if you're here at a peak hour. Êgoto the bar up front and grab a few beers while you wait. Êit'll be worth it. all in all, honestly i love ramen, i will travel anywhere for good ramen and although the broth and pork slices were on the salty side, they were the best i've ever had in spite of that. Êeven with the salty flavor, hands to the table, best ramen i've ever had.

My mom and i recently did a little "trip to Japan" in NYC. I researched for weeks and we walked all over the city sampling Japanese fare that is not available here in Philadelphia. I've never had Ramen before so i suppose my opining upon the subject is nearly moot. I will say that my mom and i went at the end of their lunch hours and were seated nearly right away, which was nice. I got the Akamaru Modern after reading the yelp reviews. I had it with onsen tamago. It was indeed the transcendent experience i've heard so very much about. I drank every single drop. My mom got the Hakata Classic Set with the grilled eel donburi. Neither of us spoke the entire time we were eating and just stuffed our faces. I can't wait to go again, but i think i would like to try some of the other types of ramen available at other places before i do Ippudo again.

The BEST ramen and pork buns! Say no more. To avoid the crowds go there at an odd time like 2pm or 3pm. But be sure to order the pork buns and their classic soup. OMG I didn't think I liked pork until I ate at ippudo. Plus their service is stellar. It's loud and not romantic, so this isn't the spot for V day, but it's perfect for a fun night!

YUMMMMMMY. ÊI think about Ippudo when I am not there. ÊIt makes me really really happy. ÊA large bowl of the Akamaru Modern, with a poached egg added. ÊThose tender slices of pork, and the firm, yet giving noodles. ÊThe savory, creamy broth with just enough kick to make it so incredibly addictive. ÊThe pork buns, which have all the flavor components of some sandwich from McDonalds that I just can't pinpoint, but are at least five million times better. ÊThe wait makes me bonkers, but I have settled on two very satisfactory alternates to waiting in their cramped waiting area. Ê1. Going to Yoga to the People for a class, and rewarding myself with a ramen upon return. Ê2. Going to Angel's Share for a very lovely cocktail in a very cool spot.

if you love being pretentious with your fellow hipsters, love RUDE HOSTESSES, NO take outs & NOT be able to take your leftovers home.. then this is your place... Êi had eaten here months before and expected to wait long being that we came on a weekend.. got there at 6pm and put our name on the list.. our party had 3 people and we waited for almost two hours last night even though the original wait was supposed to be 40mins longs.. unfortunately, the third person in our party was running super late due to traffic and so we were forced to change the number of our party to just two... the hostess insinuated that we were trying to trick her so we could be seated sooner.. my friend and i were treated so badly by the hostess.. and had we not been so tired and hungry to argue.. we'd rip that curly haired hostess a new one.. (hey management.. do something about this will you?) we were seated at the counter.. put our stuff away and perused the menu.. i had been meaning to come back here for the Samurai Ribs..so moist and sweet and falls right off of the bone.. the only reason why this review even has a star.. i asked for an order of Samurai RIbs to eat there and one for take out for the friend that couldn't make it to dinner. the server explained how the restaurant has a policy for serving food that will be eaten right away... because that is how food is served in the restaurants in japan... uh.. ookkk.. so you don't want me to buy more food that i can share with others? hmmm i asked what would happen if i end up with leftovers, would i be able to take them home since i have already paid for them and would most likely want to eat them again later on that night? well aren't you the smart cookie for guessing it right... NO! i could not take home my leftovers... lost my appetite for the rude service and having to wait too long to eat that i did indeed end up with leftovers i could not take home... for months i had been raving about Ippudo NY to friends and now i would need to tell them about my horrible experience so i can discourage them to going.. thanks Ippudo but really... NO THANKS.. I will find a new ramen place that knows great customer service and know how to serve real ramen... go to LA and try Mr. Ramen, staff and management of Ippudo Restaurant.. learn how a real ramen should taste and learn how to serve your customers better.

I've been to Ippudo several times now and I just went again yesterday. I usually get whatever the special is or the Akamaru Modern. First time ordering the Kamoshoyu Ramen (that's what it's listed as on my receipt) but it's the third option in the ramen section. I have never been this close to finishing all my soup. I don't know if it was also because I was chatting so long with my girlfriend but it was GOOD. Not too heavy, not too salty, I just kept eating/drinking and didn't even realize until they came to take my bowl away that it was almost empty. Probably going to be my regular now when I go. The current special, karaka-men is pretty good too if you like your ramen spicy. I always get the hirata pork buns when I go there. I didn't realize they're supposed to be spicy, most of the time it's not so I never noticed, wish they would be consistent with that, but still good albeit a tad over priced so you may want to do without. I haven't been to Minca in a while but I like Ippudo for the variety of options. For example, the special ramen they had during last fall was really good too. They gave you an ingredient on the side and if you add it to your soup it COMPLETELY changed the flavor of the soup. Unfortunately I don't remember what it was called or what the ingredient was. The decor and general ambiance of the place is nicer too at Ippudo. Really depends what I'm in the mood for. Whenever I go there after work I wait 20 mins tops. ÊIf you get there by 6 or earlier you're ok, any later and you might hit the dinner crowd and end up waiting 1-2 hours. And in case people don't know as long as you still have a reasonable amount of soup in your bowl you can get more ramen for $2.

First time here... and I liked it! ÊThe noodles came out fast, no wait time although we did eat at an odd hour for lunch. Ê Many reviews state the long wait times to eat, but since I've yet to experience that, all I can say is the food must be good if you are willing to wait. ÊThe ramen, from the broth to noodles, GREAT! ÊI ordered the Karaka Ramen, spicy, which tasted very similar to a korean spicy beef broth soup. Ê Ê Ê Price: For $40 (including tip) for 2 people its not too bad considering the quality of the food. Ê I can definitely see myself going back on a cold day for a bowl of hot ramen soup!

Had the chicken wings, pork buns, and a bowl of the house specialty ramen. Everything was delicious. The pork buns are great, I would give those ten stars if I could.

This is the second time I've had ramen in a legitimate setting (first was in San Francisco) and not inside my home with some instant noodles from the local Asian market. I must say, what they offer is very unique here and they do a very good job of keeping it that way. Although I found the prices to be a little too much (additions to the ramen, such as menma or even an egg were a few bucks extra), the combination of the environment, service, and most importantly, the identity of the food, make this a restaurant definitely worth visiting in New York.

I will live among the minority, but that's because I have specific tastes. I tried the traditional bowl, shiromaru, because there was something in the akamaru that I might have been allergic to (shrimp maybe?). This isn't your typical bowl of traditional ramen. At all. After eating it the first time, I thought it was tasty, but it relied a great deal on animal fat. I'm sure if you let the bowl sit in a refrigerator overnight, you'd be grossed out. Japanese people don't eat a lot of fat in their diet, so I asked my friend in Japan if he thought the broth over there was thick and confirmed my suspicion: this bowl of noodles was modified for American tastes. The broth is undrinkable because it's so thick with fat. The noodles are very thin. I've never seen ramen noodles so thin. That made every bite dense as well. I don't like that kind of consistency. I prefer it to be more chewy -- the ramen's version of al dente. The pork was very fatty and there was almost as much fat as meat on the slices. I might be exaggerating, but only a little. In most cases, as in this one, good dishes shouldn't have to rely so heavily on fat to carry the dish. The fat is so overpowering that there is little sublety or depth. The price is very high and the wait lines can be pretty long. All things considered, I prefer a more traditional ramen-ya.

Even if the wait is long, I would wait it out because it is worth it! luckily for me the two times I've been here (two weekends in a row, thats how good it is!) I came for a later dinner and an early lunch. So the wait time was only 20-30 minutes. not bad at all. You must get the Harata Pork Buns. At first glance it looks "blah" and you're thinking (or at least my big eater husband is) a small slice of pork on a bun? not worth it. But once you eat it, you'll realize its melt in your mouth deliciousness. These were the exact words my husband said and he never says stuff like this.. "its like little pockets of heaven" LOL! On to the Ramen.... what makes this ramen so good is THE BROTH! Yes, the ramen noodles are made fresh and good too but you can't beat the flavor of the soup. Its so soothing and hits all your taste buds. I've tried three different ones.... Harakata Classic, Akamaru Modern and Kogashi Miso. My favorite is the Akamaru Modern... the special sauce makes it. The others are good too, though I found the Kogashi Miso to be a bit oily, the Harakate too plain, thus making the Akamaru Modern just right.

The ramen tastes like the ones in Japan, which is good. However, the soup is basically just all MSG. The wait was pretty long and my friends and I had to share a table with strangers. The pork bun looked good, but when I ate it, it seemed like it was just all fat. The sauce of the pork bun was pretty good though. You can order one pork bun in the bar, but when you sit down on a table, you have to order 2 pork bun at once.

Ippudo is a wonderful establishment with some of the best ramen dishes in the city. ÊThe decor of the restaurant is vibrant with kanji letters, ramen bowls on the walls and an open kitchen that shows all the magic in progress. ÊYou get to experience all of this after a wait of no less than half an hour no matter the day you go. ÊThe most recent trip was this past Wednesday where we entered the queue at 7pm and did not sit down to order until 830pm. ÊThey do not take reservations. For appetizers, you have to get the Hirata Buns with pork. ÊThe flavor of the pork is reminiscent to Chinese Char Siu and it is served with some of their own spicy sauce on steamed buns which I can only imagine what eating a cloud tastes like. ÊFor the main course I almost always go for the Shiromaru Hakata Classic with added Kakuni. ÊIt is a pork broth and it is amazing. ÊWhen I eat Chinese noodle soup, I usually finish the noodles and the wontons or fish balls or whatever I order with my noodles and call it a meal. ÊWhen eating ramen from Ippudo, I drink as much broth as I can with a spoon and I have to stop myself from lifting the bowl to my lips and slurping the last one or two gulps in the bowl. ÊIt is THAT good. ÊThe main garnish in the dish is the pork loin and even though it is very tasty, I need to add Kakuni or fatty pork belly. ÊThey prepare it with a marinade that gives it a very unique smoky flavor and it is cooked just right so that it is firm enough to stay in one piece but is still tender enough that it falls apart once you bite into it. ÊMy secondary choice is the Karaka Miso Ramen which I get when I need a spicy fix. ÊBasically, you cannot go wrong with any of their ramens. I would probably give Ippudo five stars if it was not for the awful wait everytime I go there. ÊEven if they would only take reservations for the day of and only starting at 4pm. ÊAt least then I would only have myself to blame for not planning ahead to secure that reservation. ÊAs things stand, I feel screwed over before I even get there. ÊIf you are not pressed for time, Ippudo is a must.

Great food, great drinks (the lychee martini is delish). The waiting time can be bizarre. I've been here 4 times, all during the weekend evening hours, and been told waiting times ranging from 1 hour 45 minutes to two (yes, 2), minutes.

ÊThere was also small pieces of grapefruit which happily bursted with tartness. ÊAlso, great mayo sauce drizzed on the plate helped accentuate salmon. 3. ÊTraditional ramen ($13) - GREAT, AWESOME, FLAVORFUL broth. ÊOnly came with 2 slices of meat and it wasn't even that great. ÊHowever, I slurped the entire thing up. 4. ÊModern ramen ($13) - A whole new taste that seems like it's driven by satay sauce. ÊI initially thought that this was my favorite, but it could be a bit bold to eat an entire bowl. 5. ÊMiso ramen ($12) - Without noodles, the broth was sweet, especially for a dinner entree. ÊBut this has to be eaten with the thicker ramen and it's perfectly complimented. Ê We shared everything, so as I finished 1/3 of my bowl, we literally switched three times. ÊI thought that was a great way to eat it, just because all the broths are so different. ÊGo there now!!!

Great pork buns and ramen and worth the wait. The beer and sake help the 30-45 minute wait pass. If you're not a drinker, they offer free tea.

I've tried a few of the ramen options around the east village (momofuku, setagaya) and they dont' hold a candle to ippudo. Êthere are a bunch of ramen options but i can never bring myself to try anything other than the akamaru modern. Êto be fair, there is not much pork (i always order extra) and the noodles are nothing special but the star of the dish is the broth (as it should be). Êit's thick and flavorful accenting the noodles and meat with every bite. Êbe sure to slurp every drop. the ramen itself is more than enough but i usually end up sharing the bukuretsu tofu. Êit's a very unique dish...almost like a japanese tofu lasagna with a lot of extra heat. as for the wait, while they do not take reservations, many times i've gone early, put my name on the list and come back when they say to. Êno problem.

This is my number one ramen spot! ÊI've returned a few times here with different groups and I've enjoyed each experience. Sometimes the wait is long and its a bit crowded, but its definitely worth it. ÊIf you're craving for an ample serving of real ramen with tasty broth, and sake... this is definitely the place to go. ÊTrendy motif, great ambiance and very efficient service. ÊYou can also order more ramen to add to your leftover soup... pretty awesome if you can't get enough of the dish. ÊItadakimasu!

Top notch ramen the way they make it in Japan. ÊMother apparently was at an establishment of the same name in Sendai and thought the food and style of service was similar. The ramen was great; broth was flavorful without being overpowered by any one ingredient and not too oily, noodles done just right and had a generous amount of pork and veggies. ÊGot the side of chashu which was also awesome - the sweetness threw me off at start but was a nice complement to the ramen. The place is pretty loud, with them announcing the dish and seat every time food comes out, but then again, that is what a ramen joint should be like. ÊThe decor is on the upscale trendy side, but it's nice that a noodle shop has more character than a high school cafeteria. For all the warnings of a long wait we got in in about 10 minutes for a friday lunch. ÊThe hype is a bit much, but the food is legit.

This place is AMAZING. I have not been to Japan in recent memory so I cannot *really* claim that it is authentic. However, in my book and almost all of my friends that keep going back for more since we came for Ippudo's soft opening, it's the best to be had in New York. I think I've been there about 15 times now ... and I don't even live in New York anymore! (*teardrop*) My friend rolls her eyes at the mention of the place because I keep asking to go back whenever I visit. The broth is sinfully rich and the noodles soak up that wonderful flavor like no other ramen place I've ever been to. The two main ramens are the Akamaru and the Shiomaru (red & white, respectively). Everyone prefers the Akamaru, but I usually get the Shiomaru because I like how it's a little lighter. We have hypothesized that the Shiomaru and the Akamaru are probably actually the same thing but that the Akamaru has some added red paste (perhaps the Korean Spicy sauce?). You can get additional noodles and pork, although be forewarned that they are stingy on the $3 (?) you fork over for additional pork! There are some great appetizers too - the best one is the spicy tofu one. Other tasty ones are the pork bun sandwiches and the fried peppers. Design-wise, Ippudo has some fun style elements. It features a large bamboo tree, braided rope and ramen underneath glass tables, and wood to offset the otherwise dark room. The service is always speedy, probably so they can get you in and out ASAP! Make sure that you get there early if you have a large crowd because there are only 3 large tables in the entire restaurant, but it's totally worth the wait!

My only experience with ramen are the 33 cent ones you can buy at grocery stores across the country. ÊSo needless to say this is MUCH better. ÊI went with "spicy" on mine because or waitress gave me the look of death when i even considered VERY spicy. ÊIn hindsight i could of handled it easily. ÊMy favorite part about the whole experience is the yelling. Throughout my meal I heard lots of yelling from the waitstaff and the cooks and greeters at various times. It turns out they yell at you when you are leaving. They could of been saying anything but that little bit extra was what i needed as i walked out the door. My friend told me they could be yelling "go to hell" for all we know. I like to think they were yelling " come back eat more ramen" thats just me though.

Really? 5 stars? Our ramen was so-so but I've had MUCH better in small no-frills, hole-in-the-wall ramen establishments without paying upwards of $14+ for a bowl that continued to leave me in a state of hunger afterwards. Let me go back and talk about the wait for our seats. ÊI was irritated that when we walked in we asked the hostess how long the wait was. 15-20 minutes was her reply. We ended up waiting close to 45. ÊWe would have gone elsewhere but after we put in 30 minutes of wait, we kept hoping our name would be next. I almost thought she forgot about us but 15 minutes later, our name was finally called. Thank goodness b/c at this point, I was starving and ready to strangle someone. I liked our server. She was sweet and she made sure our food arrived quickly which I was happy about. But then, that happiness kinda dissapated once I took my first slurp at the ramen and realized that while it wasn't tragically horrible it was just decent, at best. Ê I will have to say though, the green tea creme brulee was delectable. Small but delicious. Overall, it's a "meh" for me and I doubt it's a place I'd highly recommend to someone if they were looking for a fantastic Japanese/ramen restaurant.

mehhh...not worth the hype or $$. i'm not saying it was bad, it was definitely a yummy meal, but i don't really understand its huge popularity. i ordered the classic combo lunch set, which comes with pork belly over rice and salad. the salad had a BOMB wasabi dressing, the rice bowl was passable (mostly rice and not a lot of meat), and the ramen was ehh. the noodles tasted pretty average, like any other ramen noodle restaurant i've been to. the broth was thick the way i liked it, a bit on the salty side, but all ramen broths tend to be pretty salty. oh, another thing is that you can add ramen for an additional fee, but you can't ask for extra broth. i'm definitely more of a broth person so i was rather heartbroken to hear this, but i guess i was asking for too much given that all the pork goodness has diffused into the soup. i'd definitely go back again, but i wouldn't wait in line or want to pay so much.

I'm from san francisco and we have quite a few reputable ramen joints in the bay area. But the ramen Ippudo serves quite possibly surpasses ramen i've had anywhere else. 1. First, the vibe sets this place apart. The entire staff cheerfully welcomes you as you enter the dining room. The open kitchen is very cool and shows that they care about their quality of food. 2. On to the ramen. It was my first time here, but i decided to go to the charred miso ramen instead of one of their usual favorites. It was an awesome thing to behold. THe first sip of the broth was so good i let out an involuntary "oh my god". The noodles were chewy, and of perfect texture... product of handmade noodles. I added kakuni in my bowl, and the tender, fatty pork belly pieces did not disappoint. Egg was cooked perfectly and the amount of toppings were adequate for the size of the bowl. When i go back to NYC, this will be the first place I will stop by. It was the best 40 minutes i've spent in a long, long time.

i felt like i was in line to get into a club. on opening night. i waited almost 2 hours to be seated on a friday night around 730. the music and decor are very upscale and the bar was packed. theres not much room for everyone waiting for a table, so theres major overflow outside on the streets. we ordered the pork buns, obviously. they were good. not great. but really really good. i had the akamaru modern ramen. i usually tend to stray from pork, but for ippudo, i made an exception. the pork chashu in the ramen was OMG, so so good! the soup was really flavorful too, but the noodles were not your typical ramen noodles. i cant decide whether or not i prefer them to the original. either way, i finished my bowl and was happy.

Sure, waiting two hours to eat a bowl of ramen and a pork bun sounds insane but if you don't have any plans for that night there are two bars right around the corner where you and your friends can hang out. ÊThat's exactly what my friend and I did this summer (its helps when the weather is nice). We started with two pork buns each, which were delicious. We also got the ribs, which IMHO were better than the pork buns. The meat was succulent and tender with just the right amount of fat. He got the original ramen while I got the spicy ramen. Both were delicious. Service was so-so at the end as we tried to order another order of ribs but it never game, but I would not hesitate to go back again and try some of their other dishes. Seating at a table next to strangers was exciting and fun even for an introvert like myself.

I was so excited to go and have some ramen at Ippudo! I went with my boyfriend last weekend for a brunch before a movie and I don't think I'll be coming back. Our ramen dishes were OK, the pork and chicken buns were OK, the sake was JUST OK, all in all, I have gone back to Momofuku Saam since going to Ippudo and did not even recommend it to anyone I know. The staff was also very nonchalant, semi aloof and could not explain the food much (hello!?). We're very open minded foodies, we try a bunch of dishes at ever new to us place but here, we either picked dishes that were just bland, or they're just, well, all bland.

I feel bad betraying my neighborhood Totto Ramen, which is excellent, but Ippudo was great as well, in a different, chic-er, more expensive way. The atmosphere is sleek and the staff welcoming. After a half hour wait on a Sunday afternoon, at the bar where we got the delicious fried peppers, we were seated. They had an extensive menu and an awesome staff, our waitress was full of recommendations, Sake tastings, and helpful suggestions. I got the vegetarian miso ramen and it was amazing, really unique flavor for ramen with the miso oil.

I totally agree with Stephanie S, on this one...I didn't think Ippudo was even close to all the hype that it gets. It wasn't AWFUL: the food does taste good, but it certainly wasn't worth the wait or the prices. If I judge Ippudo solely on the food and not factor in the hype, then it gets 3 stars. There are many ramen places to choose from in NY, some more popular, trendy, and expensive than others. I cannot comment on any of them but compared to ramen in Toronto, this was better (if that's even saying anything). Compared to ramen in Japan? FORGET IT!! We, a group of three, stopped by one Monday evening around 6:30pm, only to wait almost two hours though we were told the wait would be far less. Of course, they can't always know how long people will be but this was too much. If it were up to me, I would have just left considering all the options one has in a place like NYC. It was impossible to get a drink at the bar while we waited, unless two of us stood outside as the waiting area was SWAMPED!! The items we ordered were: - Shared starters: tofu yasai tartar ($10): this was really delicious, I only wish there was more of it (I don't recall there being any raisins in ours): silky tofu (kind of like ricotta) drizzled in sesame dressing with slivers of cucumber, avocado and walnuts; miso black cod ($16): not as miso-y as I would have liked, skin not crispy enough, and way too small a piece for $16! I get this is not a cheap fish but c'mon! Miso black cod is so common on menus, but there was really nothing special about theirs. Hmph! - Friend 1 ordered the akamaru ramen ($15). She said it was OK but didn't seem all that thrilled about it. I think she was trying to conceal her disappointment after the ordeal we just endured to get a table. Maybe she was expecting something else? - Friend 2 on the other hand, was not that subtle about how unimpressed he was with his tori ramen. Personally, I would not have ordered that anyway so perhaps he just made the wrong choice. He ate ~half the bowl and left the rest, while Friend 1 and I ravaged every last drop of ours as we were dying of hunger during the long wait. - Me: I had the miso ramen as it is one of the basics that is flavoured by something other than salt (shoyu: soy sauce, and the other one that is salt-based?) which I figured cannot be screwed up. I like to think that how well a place makes the simplest dishes are a measure of how well they know their craft and this one was just OK but the small sliver of chashu (there may have been two pieces in there, can't remember) was pure, overcooked fat so that it would just melt in your mouth--which is not what I was looking for. I would not have minded some actual meat to chew on. And there was also no egg present. For $15, I would at least have imagined half a boiled egg would come with it! I was not about to add $2 to have one brought to me once I am half done my noodles (I get that ramen broth is laborious to make but it starts to get a little silly when your ramen begins to climb to $20). The broth was tasty enough and not salty, the noodles were not plentiful, but they lacked that slight firmness (ie, they were slightly overcooked). The food took forever to arrive, though service was good. It's a cramped but large place (the setup creates a lot of long, narrow corridor-like spaces), and the trip to the bathroom was cute: you get to see guys making noodles in a small window--kind of gross that it be so close to the washrooms but if your imagine is not as active as mine, you needn't worry. The decor is typical of the trendy Asian noodle joint: minimalist, lots of black, wood... I would love to check out other NY ramen places as I am on a mission to find this black-brothed ramen I had in Tokyo at some famous place at Shinagawa station. I still dream of it today and if there is anyone out there who knows what I am talking about, PLEASE let me know!!

We got the fried chicken appetizer, which tasted like chik-fil-et nuggets to me. The ramen was big, enough for 2 people to share. We added the egg with the uncooked yolk and the pork belly (both costs extra). The pork belly was too fatty for my liking, but it does melt in your mouth. The service was good and fast.

Dear reader, Ê It saddens me to say that the Philly cheesesteaks springrolls are sticks of death consumed. They were subpar and just too heavy, reminiscent of a costco sample in a two stick 8 dollar form. Save yourself the one hour wait and train it to costco you can get a one year supply for the same price. Ê Ê The bad news aside, the ramen was tastey, we ate the classic and the soy broth was creamy had a taste of chicken and pork and had a delicious touch of a gingery finish. The pork was tender and very flavorful. Ê I also tried the pork buns which my gf said momofuko was better, but I still enjoyed the light spice, Japanese mayo and tender pork. Ê ÊWe then tried chicken wings which were flash fried in a sesame oil dressing. It was very peppery, but I'm a fan of pepper it might be the only spice I consider carrying with me in my back pocked by my wallet. I pepper potato chips. Nonetheless the chicken was good, it reminded me of kyochun chicken. Ê Last we had their soft tofu dessert, now I really liked this it reminded me of a really creamy yogurt, it wasn't too sweet and just felt really light. Overall I would go back. Just during off hours. I am not a fan of waiting over thirty minutes for places.

I don't understand what the whole buzz is about. ÊI did my 30 minutes of waiting by the cramped bar telling myself that I'll be rewarded soon. ÊFinally, I got a table and I ordered the ramen that was a special on the menu. Ê It's alright, but I wasn't blown away by it. ÊI want rich pork based broth that's milky in color and the noodles that are freshly made and chewy. ÊIf I don't have to wait so long and if it's not too expensive, then I'll go back. ÊBut for now, I'll go somewhere else.

Great ramen - very tasty, authentic, and consistent, with a good selection of both soups and other dishes you won't find at other Japanese places in the city. But: (1) Shockingly overpriced (2) Ridiculous waits at almost any hour In my opinion, worth trying, but probably not worth going back since there are about 10 other places in new york where you can get ramen that is just as good for cheaper.

5 stars as in Yes i will go back again despite the long wait! Most amazing ramen ever, definitely lives up to the expectation and more. ÊHowever I think the wait time was overestimated by the host--she said 2.5 hours, we hung out at a nearby restaurant bar for about an hour, returned to the restaurant, and was seated few minutes later. We were already absolutely full from other snacks during the day, but when the cucumber appetizer (Yamitsuki Goma Kyuri) arrived we devoured it like no other. ÊPretty pricy for a stick of cucumber, highly recommend! ÊWe also got Yamaimo Isobe, the look was deceiving when it arrived (not yam looking, it's japanese yam), but the taste was unforgettable-it had a crunchy but gel-ish texture, it was rather exquisite. I think I had the Shoyu-ramen. ÊThe portion was large but I still finished almost everything! One thing to keep in mind that you might have to share tables with other groups. ÊAt first it was a little awkward, but when the food came we couldn't care less because everything was sooo good! ÊThe service was also pretty good and the staff yells in japanese in an energetic (not rude) way.

My buddy Josh B. says that I use the word ethereal too much. ÊIn point, I have used it only one time before on a Yelp review, and that was for the burnt ends at Arthur Bryant's in KC. ÊThe soup here, is also Ethereal, but in a much different way. Ê Ê This was our 5th visit here, and it didn't diappoint. ÊThe meal starts with the fried rice with your choice of meat. ÊI have gotten chicken before, but the pork is just amazing. ÊIt comes with a side salad, which is small, but has an amazing dressing on it. Ê Ê Ê At this point, the pump has been primed.

overrated and tacky. too noisy. that's nice they do the typical japanese greeting for customers, but it gets lame, over dramatized, and too loud; disturbing my intimate conversation with the ramen broth. how can i serenade the pork strips before they dance into my mouth with this constant interruption. the soups are too strong in taste. overpowering. considering the price, it's a turn off. when i eat ramen in other places, i feel at peace. here, i feel like i'm on crack. crack is whack.

The noodles are verrrrry good... and their pork buns are simply amazing. They're very expensive, but it's worth it. Just go once in awhile and splurge! But one warning though - you may have to wait a long time if you are going after 7:30-8 and that's because there isn't much seating inside, and a lot of people tend to crowd around outside. It's very popular at St Marks and the closest to any quality food. Do yourself a favor and go try out this great ramen place. The only reason why I gave this place 4 stars is because sometimes, their ramen soup is very thick and oily. If you're not into it, as I'm not, it can be rather disappointing. I tend to like the clear, juicy broth..more on the natural side and less on the MSG.

This is by far the best Japanese ramen that I've had in the US. Actually, I had Ippudo in Japan too and I think this place is better, at least according to my memories of my trip to Japan 9 years ago. All the ramen dishes I tried here were exceptional. I am especially a big fan of their spicy ramen bowl (I don't know the name, unfortunately - but i know it's near the bottom on the menu). As people mentioned, the wait can be long, but it's worth it! Although I wouldn't normally drive in the city, I was able to find parking nearby on Sundays. Highly recommended!

I'll keep this short and sweet because there are 1800 other reviews for Ippudo on Yelp. I've been to great ramen joints such as Menya Musashi in Tokyo, Daikokuya in Los Angeles, Kintaro Ramen in Vancouver, etc. but the tonkotsu broth at Ippudo was the richest and tastiest I've ever had. The noodles and the char siu are good too, but the broth is what stood out for me. Everything else in the bowl was simply a condiment. Forget about the price or the lineups or bad reviews about service or whatever else is holding you back from trying this place out. Just go.

We went on a Sunday during prime brunch hours which was probably not a grea idea. ÊThe place was so crowded, but hostess estimated an hour wait and an hour later our name was being called. ÊNote: Êthere is a bar to wait at in the front, but it can get very crowded so be prepared to wait outside if you go during peak hours. Ê Sitting at the "bar" overlooking the open kitchen was fabulous. ÊI ordered the Akamaru Modern with Nitamago (soft-boiled egg). ÊSoon there was a huge bowl of ramen in front of me. ÊIt was delicious, and so filling that I was unable to finish it. Ê To be fair, the ramen was very good but I am not sure I would go back during those hours for it. ÊThe wait was not that bad, and the staff was very patient and did not rush us at all, but I always feel bad taking my time when I know other hungry patrons are waiting for my seat.

Super delicious ramen with a terrific broth- although spare on the extras (veggies, etc).. You can add extra fixings which I would highly recommend. The wait was a bit long but it was a Saturday night (what do you expect). After a few Sapporos at the bar it didn't make a difference. Surprisingly upscale looking restaurant for the price. Speaking of the price- pricey for ramen ($12), but super cheap for new york. Highly recommend!

Hello Ippudo, I heart you! Definitely not a place to go if your a vegetarian because their soups are so good that its a shame if you can't have any. And if you just became a vegetarian, you might want to think about cheating for a day. Not that you have to, because they do have a few veggie options, but their Raman rocks! I had the Sho-yu Ramen and my friend got their special. Their broth is on point and you can get extra noodles for 2 bucks.

When you wait over an hour (even when it's midday), you know this place is poppin'. ÊWhen you wait over an hour and the meal was well worth it, you know this place is a keeper. The decor is beautiful, and the waiting area is quite spacious around the bar where you can order drinks while you wait. ÊAbove the bar is a wall decorated with many different ramen bowls, none of which are the same. ÊThe passageway to the dining area is narrow so that there is that nice separation where you won't have people hovering over you while you eat. ÊUpon entering, I thought the dining area would be quite small because of the narrow passageway but once you get seated, you see a wide open space with beautiful earth tones with bar seating, raised booths for larger parties, and long wooden planks reminiscent of cafeteria seating. It's not a bad thing to wait since you can chill at the bar and order a few drinks and appys like the heavenly Hirata Pork Buns.. I seriously never thought pork could ever taste that good. ÊIt's basically a twist on Peking Duck but executed so well delivering strong flavors with a delicate balance. I'll go out on a limb here and say this place has the best ramen I've ever had in my life. ÊFrom the first sip of the soup, you experience such a multi-dimensional flavor that you know that this broth has been brewing slowly for a long time. ÊNoodles are the perfect girth and texture is nice by being slightly chewy. I most recently tried the First Anniversary Ramen, which as indulgent as it was, was still amazing. ÊI describe it to be a first or second draft at something that could be really amazing. ÊDespite being very flavorful, the broth had a lot of fat floating on the top. ÊThis bowl comes with a small sauce dish of a yuzu, salt, (white?) pepper mixture that the staff recommend you to mix into your broth halfway through eating for a different experience. ÊIt changed the flavor by adding in order of taste: 1. a tart flavor, 2. some spice, and 3. a lot more salt (very reminiscent of white pepper). ÊIt makes it a bit difficult to finish because of the salt level, which is why I called this dish a first/second draft as a better version would be to reduce the salt level. ÊI drank half a glass of water in one break from eating the ramen. ÊI also ordered a few glasses of Plum Wine & Soda, which was the perfect proportion and great refreshing summer drink to accompany the rich ramen. I've had a regular Tonkotsu or Spicy Miso Ramen before and it wasn't as indulgent so for the less adventurous, you can still try those. ÊI just wanted to try the new one since it was touted as a First Anniversary Ramen and it was only $2 more. Ramen portions are perfect to finish individually but they are pricey, $12-15, and if you have a larger appetite, you can just order Kaedama (extra order of noodles). ÊI'm looking forward to trying the other appetizers next time I go.

Ippudo has soul-filling broth that embraces you in the dead of winter. ÊIf you don't want to deal with the line, don't bring your friends. ÊAs I found out myself, there are plenty of other single diners- you'll be seated almost immediately at the singles table, which feels communal since we relate over our singular mission to just eat ramen. ÊOnce you finish the noodles, don't lament over gulping down so fast, since extra noodle orders are a very popular request that gives a second chance to linger just a bit longer.

I really didn't think it was that great. The price just wasn't worth it for some ramen, and some meats in the bowl. Maybe it's because I'm Chinese and I know where to get some cheap tasty noodle. Or maybe it's because all Jap places are pretty pricey. Yea, ramen is not the same as Chinese noodle, but still, my wallet cannot take the price! I guess I keep comparing it to Chinese noodle, which I can get for $5 in Chinatown. Anyways, I had the Akamaru Modern, which was recommended by a Japanese friend. It tastes ok, but it really reminded me of those instant noodles that I make when there is nothing in the fridge, you know the one with the black bean sauce and the dried up veggies in a packet that turn normal looking once it has soaked long enough in boiling water. I'm talking about the soup base, and not the noodle itself. One of my other friends had Shoyu Ramen, and the soup base tasted like soy sauce. Not worth the $13. We also had karagge, which is fried chicken. Pretty pricey for some fried chicken, seriously. However, the ramen itself was quite good. It had a really nice texture, of course, it being hand pulled. I give it high marks on the "ramen experience" meaning real ramen, and environment. I give it low marks on the price, and the flavor of the soups reminding me of instant noodle soup base, and the HIGH sodium content of the soup. Seriously, I kept drinking water afterwards. It was just so salty. It was torture, I was too full to drink water, but I was just so thirsty! But you know it's a good place when you Japanese families eating here together. Maybe I'm just being a little tough on Ippudo, but you should come here for a real ramen experience. As for me, I will not come here again. I just want my wallet to be full, so I'll keep heading to Chinatown for my cheap and tasty noodles!

Too many reviews, must keep myself brief. Went during lunch, no wait. Employees shouted in Japanese. Hirata pork buns better than Momofuku pork buns. Akamaru Modern is godly. Beautiful decor and great service. Done. Well that's for my brief version. For more details: I'm not sure if I could end up waiting 1-2 hours for ramen at dinnertime, but getting in during lunch was quite easy. People might assume that I'm used to servers shouting Japanese when entering a restaurant, but my Chinese upbringing had none of this. There were definitely patrons that did not want to "cause" such a commotion when simply trying to get a bite to eat. I knew I had to try the Hirata buns despite being disappointed by the Momofuku brand of bun (blasphemy!). While you're paying quite a bit for each bite ($8 for two buns). I still enjoyed the hint of spiciness and little bit of crisp from the iceberg lettuce. At least try it once. The Akamaru Modern came with haste and I couldn't wait to dig in. You must try the broth first before slurping up the noodles. Hey, I learned from an instructional on ramen eating. Don't judge... Tender pork with a perfect amount of fat. Noodles cooked al dente. The best ramen I've had.

15 Minutes before the doors opened for dinner, there was a line past a few stores next door. I immediately thought this would be a great place, and I wasn't disappointed. When we finally got in the restaurant, we got seated in a sweet corner booth and our server was very helpful. I got to try a variety of ramen because all my friends ordered different things. I got the special; I can't remember what it was, but it was good. One less star for it being a little saltier than I expected/ would have liked (and i LOVE salty foods), and the fact that my soup was not as hot as I wanted it to be. However, the ramen here has prompted me to try other ramen places now that I'm back in my city of SF. The price (~$10-20 per person per bowl) fit the decor (really awesome waiting area where the bar counters were lined w/ ramen, dim lit ambiance), and I would really recommend people try this place.

A visually stunning restaurant, Ippudo is universally known as one of the top ramen places in the country. ÊI'm not going to say that it wasn't good but it wasn't $15 good. ÊThe heralded porkbuns...$4 each? ÊAre you as;dlkfj kidding me? ÊSantouka in Costa Mesa, CA still reigns supreme in my book.

Cool trendy space, not the usual diner esque ramen shop (a bit pricier too). They don't take reservations so the wait can be long, but it's amazing how committed people can be to wait over an hour for these ramen bowls. Very flavorful goodness, Modern seems to be the most popular but all are very good. ÊQuality ramen

I hate to rain on anybody's ramen parade, but I'm not a fan. I actually never heard of Ippudo until a friend took me here last spring and we had to wait 45 minutes for a table of 3; thats when I realized how popular it was. Since I had no expectations of the place, I was pleasantly surprised by the animated staff, the sleek yet welcoming interior, and the chef special appetizer that day (the sweet potato mash and cold marinated tofu were delicious). Unfortunately, I was not pleasantly surprised by the ramen. I love soup noodles of all kinds but I will never understand what the feverish obsession is with these noodles swimming in overly salty pork broth that's more salt than pork. Where were the notes of soy sauce? Pork stock? Kelp? Don't serve me food masked with salt, please. that's just insulting my tastebuds. I'll have to say, they are a step up from Momofuku Noodle Bar but they were on the very last rung in my book so that's not saying much. The noodles themselves are great, they have just the right texture, thickness, and bounce, but the broth needs tweaking. It's expected to pay around $15-$18 for a bowl of this type of ramen in the city but I'd rather use that money to slurp on some good pho, udon, and soba and GOOD BROTH. I'm willing to give Ippudo a second chance, but will stick to appetizers and non-ramen entrees instead.

Do not mess around, this place is solid. ÊThe 30 minute wait on a Sunday for lunch was well worth it. ÊI honestly don't recall which ramen I ordered, but I really liked the noodles - it's completely different then your packaged ramen - that's for sure. ÊI liked that the restaurant didn't throw an excessive amount of bean sprouts and other stuff in there so that you can barely find your noodles. ÊService is relatively fast, prices are on the high side. ÊI'm so glad I finally got to try it.

Best tasting ramen I've ever had. Too bad you have to like the atmosphere as well. There's constant yelling in Japanese. I liked it - it made everything seem more authentic. Not that I have been to Japan before but if I had to imagine how eating in ramen there would be like, it would be Ippudo. Anyways my friend was annoyed by it. So differing opinions. They basically yell when you come in, leave, and when something is served. One person does it and the others follow suit. Anyways it was another yelp find. We had had Minca earlier in the week and were craving ramen once again. I'm glad we came here after because this place is way better. Sorry minca. Got here for an early dinner and was told it would be a half an hour wait. Turned out to be more like 45 min to an hour. There are a lot of large tables so it's community-style where you sit with strangers. I didn't mind, just glad to be in. I think I ordered the classic ramen - whatever was at the top of the menu and looked most popular. However the food was slow to come out. Kinda wished we ordered an appetizer like the pork buns, which looked amazing. Finally it did and we scarfed it down real quick. Broth was flavorful and there were lots of other toppings in there in addition to the succulent noodles. I also tried my friend's ramen - not sure what it was - maybe the modern one but I didn't like the flavor as much. Afterwards they served hot tea to cleanse the palate - very smooth. And dang, expensive ramen at about $13-15 per bowl. Overall, great, great, great. *Update* Tried the pork buns. They also had a chicken version and we tried both. The pork was by far the better one. Very expensive though = $9 for two pork buns. Gah.

In case you haven't deduced this from the 1,400+ reviews, Ippudo has fantastic ramen. ÊSo much that I trekked to one of the original Ippudo's in Ebisu while in Tokyo to get a taste of the real thing (which was definitely the best ramen of my life). ÊIn case you don't feel like flying seven thousand miles, stop by this Manhattan location for what will likely be one of the best ramen experiences of your life (yes, a bold claim, I know). ÊThe trendy ambiance differs quite a bit from the low key, local joints in Japan, and the menu differs a bit as well, but everything is well suited for NYC and it's a great spot to bring visitors. A note about the wait -- I've been at least five times and have consistently been quoted a longer wait time than what it actually ends up being. ÊBased on my experience, it usually takes 2/3 of what they've quoted for a party of four. ÊJust expect to wait and you'll be fine. Foodnalysis: - Ramen - This is why you are here. ÊEverything else is a garnish, focus on the ramen! ÊI'm a huge fan of the Shiromaru Hakata Classic. ÊThe broth is heavenly, the berkshire pork delicious. ÊMany enjoy the Akamaru Modern however I'm not as much of a fan of the flavor relative to the Classic. ÊThe Shoyu ramen is a nice option if you're looking for a lighter flavor. ÊIt's soy based and less rich than the Classic and Modern. ÊIppudo usually offers a special ramen flavor each month as well, usually pretty good. ÊDon't forget to ask for the sesame grinder to add some freshly ground sesame to your ramen! - Kae-Dama - For $2, you can request an additional serving of noodles after finishing the first. ÊThe challenge is to save enough broth with which to enjoy them. - Avocado and Tofu Tartar - ÊA good appetizer option, enjoyed the kuromitsu dressing. - Hirata Steamed Buns - Good but not as good as Momofuku. - Annin Tofu - Creamy Japanese tofu. ÊRefreshing for those who enjoy lighter desserts that aren't too sweet. The Bottom Line: Patience is a virtue, friends. ÊThe ramen is worth the wait.

Even though we'd just had a dinner of four sushi rolls, bf and I had to come here to try the famous ramen since we were in the area and leaving the city in a day. We shared a bowl of the akamaru ramen, which everyone and their mother raves about. And honestly? Not that impressed. Especially after a 45 minute wait at 9:30pm. While the broth was thick (meaning, not just a packet of crap and some boiling water), it was too salty! And I just can't enjoy ramen completely unless the noodles are the thick, curly ones as in packaged ramen (shame on me, I know). The one great thing about the bowl would have to be the pork. Tender, a bit fatty, delicious.

My bf and I went on a Sunday (20min wait- not bad). And what an experience it was. We felt like we had left NYC and were in Japan (we're not Japanese). The place was beautiful, the ambiance was perfect, the service couldn't have been better. We had edamame and a drink at the bar while waiting. Once seated, we had the Hirata Buns (chicken) and they were to die for! They were simply A-MA-ZING. For Ramen he had the Akamaru Modern Êand I had the Shoyu Ramen. We both absolutely loved our Ramen. The Akamura had a richer taste than the Shoyu but if you love soy sauce go with the Shoyu (you won't be disappointed). I'm now in love with Ramen and Ippudo. We can't wait to go back again, in fact we're making up the excuse that we have to take our friends there soon.

This is absolute the best modern-noodle place in NY. ÊI tried last time I was in NY and was absolutely delighted, the wait is a little bit time consuming though, but its worth, I had the classic noodle plate with some house made tsukemono (pickles) first, the staff is super-super friendly, in fact they made me drunk, this waiter offer me to taste some sake before I had it and I was tooootally hooked, at the end I tried the mille feuilles cake (Japanese style) completely different from the western one that we know it was suggested by the waitress (she was Japanese) it was soft instead of crunchy, awesome!! Êthen to complete my drunkenness I had some citrus infused sake, amazing as well, definetely the best noodle shop our west coast Ive been in the States.

I don't know what everyone's hype is about Ippudo. I can tell you straight off the back that the service is great, but the waiting time just to get in is just ridiculous. I've been here probably about 3 times but I always order the karaka ramen, that's preferably the best thing on the menu. I've tried others such as modern and such and such from tasting it from my friends plate. Ê Ê I'd have to say the ramen is here is not great, but not bad, but your probably be getting the same kind of ramen if you were to go to Santoka in Mitsuwa. ÊAlso their appetizers are great such as the tako wasabi probably the best and freshest i had in NY. Their pork buns are good too, but the only thing is that these appetizers are way overpriced. I usually go with 2 people with appetizers, ramen and drinks usually comes up to over 100. That's pretty expensive in my opinion. I thought ramen was suppose to cheap.

The first time i came here with my good male friend and good female friend, we ordered one of the big ramen... and the noodles felt powdery and i didn't appreciate that. their appetizers are definitely overpriced, tho it's good. The second time i came here with my best friend and her another friend, i ordered the chicken ramen, decided to stick to the simplest ramen coz i didn't wanna be disappointed. my best friend ordered miso ramen, i think. her friend ordered miso shoyu, that was actually the best. i would try the miso shoyu ramen if i do decide to go there again...for whatever reason. i personally think Terakawa Ramen is way better tho super casual. very humbly service and their ramen soup is fulfilling. plus it's inexpensive. this place may have a nice decor but i think it's quite overrated. and oh yea another thing that bothered me was that our waiter, tho acquainted to one of us, he didn't smile and that bothered me. A SMILE IS IMPORTANT! If he gave all of us a sweet smile instead of being all japanesy (UPTIGHT), i would've given 3 stars. this really bothered me. a free drink for each of us because he knew one of us was unnecessary if he wasn't gonna treat us special sake. don't ask, JUST BRING next time. i hate young japanese guys because of that... amateurs. BORING. Therefore I felt ramen was VERY expensive for the whole experience.

5 stars for a $14 bowl of ramen. ÊI know that's a high bar but Ippudo is as good as it gets. Ê Yes it's salty, yes it's pricey, and yes there's a huge wait if you go at prime time. ÊBut it's worth it. ÊFortunately I live just a couple blocks away so yesterday I walked by for lunch when there was no line. ÊI didn't have much time and was able to be in and out in 30 minutes.

Ê$17 for the set ($14 for just the noodles) -- I had the spicy ramen (I forget the name), plus it comes with a little salad and a rice bowl with your choice of something (I got the fried chicken, but u can also have roe or pork or eel I think). ÊAfter finishing up, I wanted to chug the remaining ramen broth and eat the leftover rice in my bowl but held back. ÊI had to cleanse that night with a juice-only dinner though. ÊLots of salt, lots of carbs, mega calories. ÊTip - go before 11:30 for lunch or after 2 on weekdays to avoid the lines. ÊI have been here maybe 7 or 8 times, and twice in Tokyo, and I think I enjoy it more every time. ÊBut what's it with the prices that keep going up?

The pork buns are delicious. Overpriced, but very savory. I ordered the Akamaru Modern as a suggestion by my friend. It was tasty, but not nearly as good as Minca's ramen. The pork was too hard/tough and the noodles were too soft. On top of that, it was not a cheap meal. The hostess was snarky as hell but the waiters were pleasant and attentive. In general, it was good but overpriced, I would go to Minca over Ippudo.

I love love ramen. I just moved to the city and have been meaning to find my fav ramen place. First stop: Ippudo. ÊHaving heard horrendous stories about the hour and a half wait at dinner time, I dragged my boyfriend here right before they opened at 5PM to avoid it. Once they opened, we got seats right away. (awesome) We got the Hirata pork buns to start and they were tasty!! Really soft buns with juicy pork and a good sauce. For ramen, I got the Akamaru Modern, which came with the Ippudo sauce and a bunch of other oils you need to mix together. Only complaint is that it doesn't come with an egg (how do you eat ramen with no egg) but I, of course, made sure to order that extra. If you are expecting typical ramen, this is not it - it has a bunch of other flavors and tastes delicious! Fatty pork belly chashu (which i love) and noodles (thinner than ramen im used to) both made me full and happy:). He got the Hakata Classic and really enjoyed it. I tasted the broth and it was good - it had more of the typical ramen broth flavor. Total came to around $50. Felt pricey to me for ramen but guess thats cause i gotta get used to living in the city! Would definitely come back to fulfill my ramen craving!

wasn't bad. pork buns were pretty good. they needed some kind of addition in texture, or some acid. that one piece of iceberg lettuce didn't help cut the fat and salt enough. portion was surprisingly big for the price. i was not impresed by the ramen. it's good....just not as good as the hype would lead you to believe. Êif i had to wait a long time to eat at his place, i don't think i would be a very happy camper. waiting 30min+ and paying $15/bowl kind of misses the point of ramen being...well, ramen! i understand that its' a direct japanese import, but the constant exclamations in japanese being shouted at the customers were kind of off-putting. i felt awkward and annoyed that i was being shouted at in a language i didn't understand.

Eating out by yourself isn't always the best situation to judge a place by. You're usually not going to linger very long, and there is certainly no sharing and going-on about how good or bad your plate is with your dining partners. But, tonight, I thought I'd drop by Ippudo and give it a shot, stag. The one benefit of being by myself meant that I got to jump in front of the slew of people waiting, who actually have friends, for that one lonely seat at the bar... yay for me! It's clear, for anyone who hasn't been yet, that there's a good chance you're going to wait a while on a Friday night, particularly if you have a group. So, don't wait too long before you decide to go. Now, to the food. I was hoping for some cold ramen soup, I'm a big fan of Hiyashi Chuka, but I've come out 0 for 2 for my return to New York cold ramen hunt. So, I settled for an order of the Hinata Pork Buns followed by a steaming bowl of Akamaru Modern. The pork buns are pretty straight-forward, with just a slice of barbecue pork, topped with lettuce and a mayonnaise, sandwiched in a steamed bun taco. The pork was egregiously fatty, and I'm surprised it wasn't too much for me, but I still enjoyed it. The Akamaru came out and the broth was a rich red/brown with plenty of essence speckling its surface. The noodles are not a traditional ramen noodle, but more like a somen noodle, perfectly straight before it's cooked. The noodles maintained a nice consistency throughout, which made savoring them more slowly very doable. The pork was fantastic, the cabbage, flavorful, and the broth had loads of character. All in all, a very good bowl of soup. Now, through it all, I only have a few things to complain about. I know it's New York and all, but I still find it weird to pay $14 for a bowl of ramen... no matter how good it is. I would do it again, but I'll still frown a bit that I did it. Additionally, the staff just goes on and on with the Japanese greetings and exaltations cranked up to "11." I know it's a traditional thing, but it started to take on the feeling of theater, Disney World style. Just tone it back a bit, ok? I'll go back, and I'll be happy to take some friends along to see what the team dining experience is like. Luckily, I think most of them don't know a bowl of Ramen should cost half as much, so I'll just keep that to myself.

Ok, best ramen I've ever had (although that's not saying much since I don't eat ramen often, and I don't see the big deal). But, I really liked the texture of the noodles - nice and firm. I ordered the akamaru modern with bamboo shoots. The broth was super porky, and the meat was so deliciously savory and tender. The pork buns were awesome too.

as the other fifty million people have stated - there is a long line, but yes - those delectable strings of noodles will play the strings of your heart when you're done.. better yet! the strings of your .. stomach.. Êi only took one star off for the wait.. ... if you're starving check out my review for ra ra ken! THE INFAMOUS WAIT: Êbe ready for a wait anywhere from 1-2 hours... reservations? HA! good luck buddy! the only time i didn't have to wait was this one time.. at band camp.. around 11pm... so if you can wait it out til about 11pm.... ... THE ATMOSPHERE: chique-y and poshy - it definitely makes you think that you'll be paying more than 13-15 a noodle bowl! clean lines, with great tables for large groups- the atmosphere definitely makes ramen look good Ê THE FOOD: I haven't tried the other dishes on the menu - but how could i when the noodles are calling? my fave?for starters - those tiny lil' pieces of heaven - the pork buns..then i move onto the shoyu ramen with a tender piece of pork belly and some slivers of cabbage and scallions swimming in a sea of tasty broth.. each bite transcends time and the mere 5 minutes it takes for you to finish the bowl of ramen will be heavenly... then you'll need to head over to the powder room since you will have soup on your face and noodle in your hair and maybe a piece of scallion on your chin. mmm mmm.. THE AMENITIES: bathroom is nice an clean ladies - nothing like a clean bathroom for you to wash up, powder up, and be ready for your night on the town.. no need to worry about the 'one stall problem' around here! after taht satisfying meal.. you are ready for a night of possibilities!!! hopefully, you won't have too much to drink tonight, since no one wants to see the noodles the second time around! HAPPY RAMEN EVERYONE!

Admittedly I was a ramen virgin as I stepped through the doors of this highly styled ramen house near Astor Place, but the experience I had here was one of wonder. When we first arrived around 6pm last Thursday the place already had a bit of a wait, which I used to go to the WC. ÊCleanliness is next to goodliness you know. ÊAnd I couldn't have imagined that the styling made it all the way down the stairs, through the dark corridor with the peeping tom windows into the prep kitchens and ultimately into the toilets! ÊI can only speak for the women's WCs, but holy crapper! ÊEach bathroom had a wall mural, the room on the left had a geisha and the room on the right had cherry blossoms, with changing colored lights. ÊThe dining room, in which we sat at the "bar", was even more impressive with numerous fixtures and artistic touches that kept the eye moving with all its little wonders. ÊAnd the chefs, who are about 2 ft away from you if you sit at the bar, in their festive garb shout out greetings and thank yous in Japanese to all who enter and exit. ÊAll and all it was a very fun atmosphere! ÊKudos on the entertainment value of the place. Now for the food. ÊAs I stated, this was my first "real" ramen experience. ÊI've never eaten at Momofuku or any of the other highly or poorly rated ramen joints in our fair metropolis. ÊHowever, although I was novice, I was expecting to thoroughly enjoy this place based on the rave reviews from multiple resources. ÊI was NOT disappointed. ÊThe ramen I tried was the mildly spicy (as listed) version of their original and, although sparse with the accoutrements and not spicy per se, it was really really tasty. ÊAs were the shrimp croquets we had along with it! ÊOh yes. Now, I have to admit, I don't know if it's worth all the hype. ÊBut for about $25a person, no alc consumed on this day, for 3 big bowls of ramen, yummy shrimp croquets = full bellies = not too shabby! Worth checking out for sure, whether you are novice or experienced ramen eater. ÊWhy not?

Too many reviews already so best to keep it brief.. The design is great especially for the price you pay. The broth is tasty, the noodles are fresh. But, the bowels come only 2/3 full, and only two thin slices of meat. Value-wise places like Minca beat Ippudo but taste wise Ippudo slightly wins because the noodle tasted better.

It's been three days since I was in NY and had my bowl of ramen from Ippudo. I'm going through serious withdrawals and all I can think about is ramen. I am on the brink of booking a ticket to NY just to go to Ippudo. I've researched other ramen places in SF where I could get my ramen fix, but alas, I don't think it could satisfy me as much as Ippudo. I swear they put crack cocaine into this because I don't know how else I could be having such serious withdrawal symptoms!

solid 5 stars -- the reviews definitely don't lie. Êmy experience with ippudo was great! Êrecommended to me by my foodie friend who warned me that my wait time for a party of 2 would be anywhere from an hour to an hour and a half. Êridiculous for ramen, but if it's worth it, i'll wait for an hour. Êanyway, we managed to sneak in and get seated in 20 minutes (i guess there were more larger parties that night) and we sat in front of their sushi station. Ê great ambience and it's pretty fun to sit at the counter and watch the chefs prepare everything in front of your eyes. Êanyway, on to the food! started with seared scallops. Êthey were pretty darn good..very fresh and spicy with a ponzu sauce around it. Ênothing amazing, but definitely good. then came the tori karaage (fried chicken). OH MY GOD. the most amazing fried chicken i've ever eaten, with the best sauces. Êthe chicken was perfectly fried so it was still juicy but crunchy. Êboth sauces were great...one was a japanese mayo/chili remoulade type sauce and the other one was mainly chili based and spicier :) then the ramen. Êdefinitely worth the $12-14. Êit's so good..the thin straight noodles, the broth was perfectly cooked and flavorful, without being super fatty, and a great soft boiled egg. amazing. and as if we didn't eat enough, we got the green tea creme brulee and green tea ice cream. Êim normally not a huge fan of green tea creme brulees, but this one was the best. strong flavor while still creamy, topped with a really rich green tea ice cream scoop. yummo! i would definitely say go with a small party, wait the wait, get the fried chicken adn the ramen. it will blow your mind!

Slightly overrated! ÊThe noodle is much to thin and in small portion (you have to add $2 to get what is a regular portion at other noodle house) Êand the soup, even though it is tasty, I think its too thick...

I've been dying to come and check out this place for months now and I finally got the chance with my parents this past weekend. I must say that I was initially impressed with the overall atmosphere of the place. On the smallish side, Ippudo isn't much to marvel at, and yet in its simplicity it exudes an appeal of its own. Onto the menu though. Like most other yelpers, I came here for the noodles and the noodles only, however we did get the chance to sample some of the appetizers. One that stood out in my mind was a simple dish of fried peppers. While they weren't by any means amazing, there was something about them was just so flavorful and the texture was quite unique. The only thing I wish was that they offered a selection of both spicy and non-spicy peppers to cater to those who prefer to have their insides lit on fire. Moving on though, my father and I both ordered the daily special bowl of noodles, which came in a deep bowl that was filled up to the edges in a delicious broth. My mother opted for a similar dish but with extra spices. The noodles here were quite thick and almost of an eggy consistency. In short, they were a little different than what I expected but ended up being quite tasty all the same. ÊAll in all though, the ramen was wonderful and for less than $15 each we enjoyed a great meal at Ippudo. I'm not sure if its the best ramen I've had but I must say it certainly hit the spot on a freezing winter day in NYC.

my conclusion is: the secret behind Ippudo's most highly acclaimed ramen broth is in the everlonger wait you have to endure. the more you wait the hungrier you get, and finally your stomach is exposed at its most vulnerable, to something so intensely flavorful as triple distilled piggy juice: 1st gulp. down the anger (at the wait as well as the cutely incapable hostesses) 2nd gulp. down the buckling knees 3rd gulp. down the envy for japan's national culinary treasure (versus america's: big mac?) ramen didn't get boring when there was plenty else to keep you entertained: tofu 3 ways (w/ sea urchin, shitake and wasabi, was on the special menu. didn't impress me but was interesting), decent sashimi dishes overall. definitely a fun place, with lots of good thoughts in the interior design (one too many for me actually--seemed a little trying. but good surprises never hurt). i didn't like the fact that the bathrooms were next door to where the noodle was being freshly made (showcased through a window), despite the educational and time-killing aspects of it.

I'm not into very rich foods, and I'm also one of those ppl who think of ramen as something I can make pretty deliciously for $1 at home (yea Shin ramen!), so I was worried that I wouldn't enjoy Ippudo that much. I was pleasantly surprised. I had the Akamaru Modern. The broth was thick but not so rich that I felt gross afterward. Slightly spicy. The pork buns were good, especially the fluffy bread. Not a must-order for me tho... the sight of the big stripes of fat slathered in mayo kinda turned me off.

i would come back here. Êthis place has such high energy and the staffs' attitudes complemented the bold flavors that came with the food. Êi had the duck ramen and it was probably the most delicious ramen i've had in a long while. Êi'd recommend the philly cheese steak spring roll appetizer, too. Êeverything was a bit pricey for the food that it was and the portions that they give though. if you sit at the bar it's probably not great for conversation as it gets extremely loud what with all the chefs and waiters shouting constantly. Êthe only other downer is the long wait (arrived at 7:15 on a tuesday night with a party of 2 for an hour wait), but maybe it's a good opportunity to walk around the neighborhood and work up an appetite...

i think once you've had a bowl of ramen from anywhere in japan (and for half the price no doubt) it's hard to find something comparable anywhere else in the world. and though ippudo does serve a mean bowl of ramen, i would have to say, "meh, i've had better." i do have to give props to their akamaru modern though... that ball of red paste was tasty! and the pork buns were okay too. but yeah... for the price you pay, i think you can find better ramen elsewhere.

oh new york, why are you so amazing but your asian food lacks in comparison to california's asian food? Ê the ramen is no exception. Êafter hearing many good reviews and recommendations for this place, i was excited to try a ramen that was slated to beat daikokuya, shinsengumi or santouka. Êmuch to my disappointment, ippudo did not even come close. Ê for $14 for a tiny bowl and having to share a table (asian style) in such a nicely decorated place, i expected the flavors to blow me away. Êi ordered the akamaru ramen and the pork buns. Ê the pork buns were really good actually, but a little fatty (but u expect that from pork belly). Ê the soup base was good and very different from your normal tonkatsu, miso, shoyu, etc. soup bases but the base was a little bit too strong for me, almost borderline salty and not just flavorful. Êthe ramen noodles and the toppings were forgettable as i have already forgotten what they tasted like and what toppings were inside the ramen bowl. Êoverall, it was just a-ok... warning, we went at 11pm on a saturday and there was still a 45 minute wait....

I've been to Ippudo 3 times over the last two years, and I was blown away zero times. ÊThat's how "good" I thought this place was. Ê Each time, the wait was just over one hour even though my party size varies from 3-8 people and varies from lunch to dinner. ÊWhen we're finally seated, we saw that there are plenty of empty tables in the restaurant. ÊI conclude that either these tables are always left empty because they have no waiters serving those particular tables, or the wait time is a gimmick to give the illusion that this place is really worth the waiting for. Ê In any case, I've given this place 3 tries, all of which with different people, because they all heard about the awesome ramen broth that Ippudo serves. ÊOne of my lunch buddies also highly recommended this place to me and said it was FANTASTIC and that you can pay $2 extra to get extra noodle after you've finished your meal. Ê The third time I came here is my final visit to Ippudo. ÊI came with two others, and were seated in a round table that seated 8 people while there were other empty tables open. ÊOkay, I've experienced this in Chinatown restaurants where they crowd people together in one table, but then, their meal only cost me $5. ÊIf I'm paying $20 (tips and tax) for a bowl of ramen, I do NOT want to be seated with strangers staring at me slurping up my ramen.

I know ramen bars are suppose to be street food, but can't I just enjoy my delicious opague tonkatsu ramen and pork bun with a little style if I want to? Ippudo is absolutely no reservations taken, but add a pork bun and some sake at the bar with friends...and the hour or so isn't so bad. Going on Sunday at 5pm will probably help too. In honor of recession specials aplenty nowadays, I decided to ramen bar for my birthday (i know $13 isn't cheap, but not so bad for a birthday dinner...). Dozens of giant soup spoons and giant noodle bowls later, I had a Japanese entourage burst into song and ceremoniously bring in an even more giant red velvet cake from sweetshop. They may have also handed me a mini cleaver to cut my cake. Ha. Oh and don't forget to wear layers. Gets super warm when you're constantly surrounded by piping hot bowls.

The noodles here are good but I don't think it's that great to warrant the forever growing waitlist of people wanting to dine here. ÊThe times I've been here, the wait has always been over 1 hr. ÊTo my taste buds, the noodles are just as good if you were to head further east to Minca, where the wait is more bearable and the price is about 30% less. ÊIf you have never been to Ippudo, however, definitely do give it a try, but go early or on a Mon/Tues weeknight where the crowd is lighter. ÊWhen there, have a taste of their pork belly appetizer...it is melt in your mouth yummy. ÊAny of the noodles they have are good so you won't be disappointed no matter what you order.

Ippudo is my favorite place to go for ramen. ÊApparently it is also the favorite for many others so be prepared for a half hour wait (at the very least) if you come for dinner. ÊThey do offer a nice buy one get one free happy hour deal for their beers on tap to help you pass the time (comes out to $6). Once you walk in, their dcor is very nice and modern. ÊThey have nice white booths for slightly larger parties, regular tables for smaller parties and a communal dining table surrounding a faux fireplace. ÊI've had the Shiromaru Hakata Classic (the original tonkutsu soup noodles), the Akamaru Modern (the original tonkutsu soup noodles with fragrant garlic oil and miso paste), as well as their spicy tonkatsu soup noodles. ÊMy favorite is the Akamaru. ÊRegardless of which flavor you choose the broth is very flavorful, and not as oily as many other places. ÊThe ramen portions are a good size however if you have a large appetite you may want to order an appetizer or two. ÊThe meal concludes with a complimentary cup of tea. Ê If you're looking for a great bowl of ramen, Ippudo is worth the wait and the few extra bucks.

I've tried plenty of ramen places in the area and Ippudo continues to be my favorite. I've gone for dinner before and I went for lunch for the first time the other day. The lunch set is really great. You get a salad, rice bowl with a choice of 1 of 3 different toppings, and a regular sized bowl of ramen for about $15. Boyfriend and I really REALLY enjoyed the rice with pork as weird as that may sound. It was just such a satisfying bowl of rice (and nice and warm!). The ramen is just the best because it has the best broth and noodles around. Also, I couldn't help but notice the Japanese regulars that came for lunch, the Japanese staff and the Japanese cooks. That just proves how wonderfully authentic Ippudo is.

I really liked the interior of this place, it was hip and nicely decorated. It was quite busy on a saturday night, we had a party of 3 and waited for about an hour.

I would actually like to give them a higher rating after going back for a couple times. ÊI just felt that their ramen is the best I had tried in the city and the quality of their food is always consistent. ÊTruly enjoyed their food every time I go back there. ÊMy favorite ramen is the Akamaru Modern. ÊThe broth is rich and savory. Other items worth trying is their salad and Fried Peppers. ÊTheir salad has this wasabi kick to it which is amazing.

I'm a newbie as far as ramen is concerned but I've had it in Tokyo (Jangara in Ometosando), Maru Ichi in Cali, Momofuku in NYC and I would say that Ippudo, while not bad is not the BEST I've ever had but tasty nonetheless. It's all about the broth and the noodles. ÊThe broth was not as meaty in flavor for what I prefer. The noodles were al dente and thinner than what I'm used to. ÊOverall this place had tasty braised berkshire pork. The bonus was that we could order extra pork on the side which added to the overall ramen experience.

worth the hour wait? maybe, if you're with likeable company you can wait it out with conversation. the decor is def very nice, for a ramen place, its spacious inside but the bar/waiting area is cramped. expensive for RAMEN, but it is quality food. i got the special of the day, the wasabi ramen with a side of braised pork belly - it was suprisingly filling (ramen doesn't fill me up often), had a nice strong wasabi flavor, but was a bit too salty for me. the braised pork belly was very good, i highly recommmend that, i am a huge fan. we spent $20 per person.

If you grew up on Top Ramen, you'd wonder why you should pay anything over 35 cents for any sort of Ramen. Well the long lines and hour waits will tell you otherwise - this is well worth the $13 bowls...it's amazing broth, freshly made noodles and yummy pork. You'll never want to go back to Top Ramen, ever. This is Ramen, classy, homemade, delicious, grown-up style.

One of the better ramen restaurant in NYC. It's rated #1 by ramen enthusiast but probably for it's decor and touristy atmosphere. You will see modern presentation of japanese food and ramen in all sort of ways. Nifty, if you prefer creativity. And by no means that their ramen suffers from this, it's still good! But I like to enjoy my ramen with less hype and fanfare.

So..came here on a weekday a few weeks ago and there was a bit of a wait. Pork buns for the appetizer was tasty.Thought the ramen was good, pork tender, well seasoned broth. Overall, food was satisfying but i feel a bit overpriced. I guess everything in NY is, but i think ill stick to Daikokuya in LA for my ramen and their delicious pork rice bowl!

delicious, amazing, totally worth the hassle. perfect in all ways every time. except for that horrible hour to hour-and-a-half wait. i loved it so much i had my last birthday there. nothing like eating the most delicious wings and ramen on the face of the earth, in a huge booth, surrounded by friends, to make you love life. xxoo ippudo. i love you so much!!!!

I think Ippudo is a little too hyped up, but it's still a solid 4-star place. ÊWe waited an hour and fifteen on a Sunday evening. ÊPork buns were delicious, more like Peking duck buns rather than your typical BBQ pork buns. ÊI had the spicy ramen special with extra noodles -- great stuff, nothing spectacular or that unique. ÊTried some of the akamaru modern ramen too, which was also solid. ÊIt bothered me that the pieces of pork were 70% fat and 30% meat, but if that's what makes the broth good, then I ain't complaining. ÊI thought everything was pretty expensive (the two little pork buns were $8), the service was excellent and the place looks nice. ÊIppudo is pretty good but don't expect anything crazy.

YES this place is as amazing as everyone raves. I'm a huge fan of ramen and I thought I had found the best ramen in place before I came here. Their stewed pork is done to perfection! I'm not a fan of thin noodles which is what they have here but it wasn't a big deal. Their soup and everything else is really good. This is also the most expensive bowl of ramen I've ever had - $15/bowl... ??? without the stewed pork... it's ramen. This place is also the trendiest ramen place, definitely gets a plus for decor.

nothing beats ramen in japan. ippudo was my second favorite only to ichiran in FUKUOKA...so its no surprise that the akamaru ramen in NYC is good...but nowhere near as good as the original compared to the first bowl i had in tenjin. that said the akamaru ramen...that fatty broth that makes it a classic lacked the spicy bite which was disappointing. the base flavor...i could taste ippudo but still...something felt like it was missing. noodles were cooked al dente. egg had that great texture where the yolk wasn't boiled through. most the components were mostly there...but somehow, the taste just didn't "wow" me like i was expecting it to. disappointing? yes. BUT this is probably one of the better ramen places i've been to. and maybe my expectations were too high. maybe i'll try going back there again...but at $14/ bowl...its a little steep for the quality i was expecting

ÊDropping $8 for two miniscule pork buns when Chinatown's a mere 15 minute walk away??!?

Japanese cuisine is among the most intimidating types of food to an inexperienced vegetarian. Ramen, especially, ranks high among those items that look enticing and comforting and yet, can be quite deceptive to one who does not consider seafood as part of his or her diet. In fact, the wave of authentic ramen restaurants that has overtaken NYC almost caused me to lose hope over one day being able to enjoy a bowl full of steaming noodles with my carnivore friends (until now, Souen noodle has been my refuge). ÊBut when Julie of Peek & Eat asked me to meet her at Ippudo, I took it as an opportunity to give ramen another shot. As it turns out, both Julie and I were pleasantly surprised by our experience. As is typical, the wait was long - though relative to usual, an hour-long wait can be considered brief. We decided to side step the crowded bar at the front of the restaurant and instead, enjoy a cocktail from one of my favorite spots: Angel's Share. ÊOne round later, we were back at Ippudo. As we were seated at the counter, shouts of greeting in Japanese gave us the feeling that we were being welcomed to a party. A friendly waitress approached us promptly. Over continued calls of greeting from the staff, the waitress informed me that the menu was actually pretty friendly towards vegetarians. Not only did they have an off-menu vegetarian ramen (they only started serving this three or four months back), they had several appetizer options like avocado and tofu tartar and noodle salad. Julie forewent her usual choice of a seafood appetizer and instead shared the most highly recommended vegetarian appetizers with me. According to the waitress, "everyone loves" the yamitsuki goma kyuri (cucumber in sesame oil dressing topped with yuzu salt and chili flakes) and the shishito (deep-fried Japanese peppers served with lemon and yuzu salt). We were not disappointed; both were delicious and unlike anything I've ever tried before. The cucumber was crisp, refreshing and yet had a slight red-pepper flavor without being spicy. The peppers were also surprising in that they were not at all spicy but still maintained their earthy, peppery flavor. The yuzu salt cut through the coating of light oil and the lemon added a breath of brightness. I can see why the waitress recommended these dishes. http://veggiewala.com/deÉ

3.5 stars... great service. My friend and I love ramen. I'm asian, he's not, but we both agree although this is a great ramen place, it's not worth returning. First, the ridiculous line. We were there around 5:30pm and a long line was already formed. We were told to wait 30mins which wasn't too bad. The interior is nice, but somewhat small. If you're not with a big group, you will be sitting either across or next to strangers. We ordered the Samurai Rib for appetizer, I had the Shiromaru Hakata Classic while my friend ordered the Akamaru Modern. The Samurai Rib was good, but my friend said I've made something pretty similar to that. We expected a rich, fatty tendon with tender pork. It was basically lean pork rib which is great for the avg skinny new yorker, but my friend loves FAT. My classic ramen was good, the broth was flavorful, but a bit too delicate for me. I wanted more richness, the noodles were just okay. I had a bite of the pork loin then gave it to my friend. It was a lil dry. The soft boiled egg looked really nice but I gave that to my friend as well since the Akamura Modern doesn't come with one. He loves boiled eggs, especially with noodles. My friend said my classic ramen was more flavorful compared to his Modern ramen. After tasting mine, the modern tasted somewhat bland and simple. My friend really liked his pork belly chashu. Fat = flavor... I assume that's why he preferred the Modern ramen. I'm glad I tried Ippudo. It was a good bowl of ramen, but it wasn't great. It certainly didn't wow me. Price isn't a factor, I still won't go back. East Village has so many options with great food and no lines.

I decided to try this place since it got so many good reviews and everyone talks about it whenever ramen is mentioned. i had high expectations for this place and sadly, they were not met. i got the Akamaru Modern and shared an order of the pork buns with my friend. The pork buns were definitely very tasty, no doubt about it but it was simply way overpriced. The ramen was also decent but not amazing. The soup base was good but could have used a little more flavor. Overall decent food but it wasn't as amazing as other people say it is. I prefer Sapporo's ramen over Ippudo's. I would only come back for the pork buns.

The best ramen in New York. It took so long before I finally checked out Ippudo a few years ago. Now, I try to go whenever I'm in the area (unless I'm eating at Robataya). Went again last night (April 17, '11). The ramen kicks a** - I've had both the miso and karake miso, as well as the Hakata classic - but also try their Hirata buns, chicken wings, Philly cheese steak spring roll, agedashi tofu, tori karaage, samurai ribs, and sizzling grilled chicken. Seriously, there are so many other outstanding dishes on the menu, I'm often tempted to forgo the ramen and dig into the appetizers exclusively; one of these days. The atmosphere is really nice, the staff is friendly and helpful, and you can even get seconds on the ramen for only $2 (don't finish up all the soup base, though). Of course, the biggest complaint is the wait, even when you get there before it opens. Unless you're starving, it's best to wait. You won't regret it. Over an hour last night, but in the end, it was entirely worth it.

When the tapeworm inside of me is hungry in winter, there is no better food to feed it with than a steaming hot bowl of ramen. ÊHaving tried most of the major ramen joints in NYC (from Minca to Momofuku and Setagaya), I have concluded that Ippudo reigns supreme. ÊThe noodles are chewy and the broth is not overly salty. ÊThey must sprinkle some crack in the broth because ever since my first visit, all I do is crave their ramen. ÊThe only downside is that because it's sort of a "scene," you have to wait at least an hour to get a table. ÊBut hey, that's what the bar in the front is for! RECOMMENDED Akamaru Modern ramen, Shiromaru Classic ramen, Kogashi Miso ramen, oshinko (pickles), fried peppers, pork buns. NOT RECOMMENDED Pork & tofu bakuretu.

Overrated and overpriced. I'll leave this one to the granny-glasses hipsters who want to wait two hours to pay $13 for a bowl of ramen. Give me a break. One positive: I had the Akamaru Modern ramen, and the broth was quite good, and the two pieces of pork were tasty and tender. The noodles were mediocre, however, and the overall experience really forgettable. If you want a satisfying bowl of noodle soup, get it in Chinatown or Flushing for $5. ÊAdd a big steaming pork bun for $1. ÊAnd as a side bonus, you won't feel like a douche.

Holy crap I never knew ramen could be so good!! Started with the pork-buns, which basically blew my mind, and then I had the...um...the one that starts with an "A" (yeah, yeah, I forgot the name). So anyway, I took my sweet time eating that stuff up b/c I did not want that bowl to be empty. It was seriously the best frigging broth I think I've ever had. It was like the kind of broth that takes simmering multiple chicken carcasses for several days to make. For reals, if I could make a chicken broth this good I would eat soup for the rest of my life. I don't even know what else was in there b/c the flavors were so complex. Damn.

Likes: - Pork buns- Less fatty than Momofuku and has a special mayo and hoisin sauce, but wish they had a better Pork-to-bun ratio. Too much bun! - Kakuni- Braised pork belly w poached egg. I would choose this app over the pork buns any day. Extra juicy pieces of pork w/ wasabi paste on the side and a poached egg in a cup to be used as a dipping sauce. - Samurai pork spare ribs- Delicious, fall-off-the-bone meat! - Spicy paste to add into your Ramen noodle broth - Make sure you use this sparingly. Can get really salty if you add too much. 1 order of Spicy Paste is perfect to share between 2 or 3 people. -1980s Special Ramen. If this ramen is on the special ramen list, you must try it! They use the crinkly noodles and the broth is delish! -Matcha Green Tea Creme Brle! If you're a green tea ice cream fan, you will love this dish. Tastes like Creme brle mixed w/ matcha green tea powder and the dish is very shallow, so you get a great creme brulee-to-burnt sugar crust ratio. Meh: - Akaru modern. Very good but a little oily for my taste. Sticking w/ the classic. - Ippudo NY Creamy Chicken Special ramen was ok, but the broth tasted a little thick. Dislikes: - Long wait - Doesn't take reservations - The thin straight ramen noodles. I think they're very good and cooked al dente, but wish they used the crinkly ramen noodles as a regular menu item! Sometimes they'll use these noodles for the Ramen Special.

ippudo was our first destination straight from jfk (luggage still in hand). there was only about a ten minute wait or so on a tuesday night, which was perfect, because we weren't fed on the plane and it was just starting to sprinkle; perfect ramen weather. we started with a pork bun each and a fried chicken appetizer to share. i did my yelp research beforehand and knew what to expect regarding the wonderfulness of the pork buns. but my goodness! a giant, fatty piece of pork belly, with a little bit of spice and a smooth, creamy sauce. delicious. the fried chicken, on the other hand, was nothing too special. it was good, but it had nothing on the fried chicken at hurry curry in west la. our bodies were still thawing from the cold nyc air when our ramen arrived. i went with the akamaru modern ramen just cause it sounded intriguing. the broth was pretty good, it was rich and delicious, but nothing unlike i've had at several places around la. the pork belly in the soup was thick and tender, but there was only one piece. i was a little disappointed in the portion size of the noodles given the price. i don't know how much food goes for in nyc, but in downtown la, you can get a lot more ramen that tastes just as good. all in all, the ramen wasn't, by any measure, the best i've ever had, but it was delicious and it definitely did the trick in warming us up and satisfying our craving for something comforting. but those pork buns! damn! seeing as how we weren't sure when we would be back, we ordered another round for dessert. thus, the fourth star. if i lived in nyc, i could see myself visiting ippudo pretty often.

Ippudo and its waiters try to simulate the feel of a Japanese Ramen Noodle shop down to the fine soups and sleek atmosphere. First-timers must try the Pork Belly buns and the "Shiromaru Hakata Classic" Ramen - complete with their delicious ramen broth, pork loin, memma, red pickled ginger, and lots of other goodies!

I used to think, ramen noodles - I'm not paying money for something I could get in a package for less than $1!!! ÊMy mind changed once I had a bowl of Ippudo's ramen noodles. I took my cousin from out of town to this place and we ate until we exploded!! ÊWe had the following: Salad Chicken Wings Pork Buns We also had a bowl each of ramen. ÊI don't remember which ones we ordered but it was so delicious. ÊThe pork buns melted in your mouth. We got there shortly after they opened for dinner so the wait wasn't bad. ÊIt was when we left when it was crazy packed!!!!

Wowza! Wait is a little long but worth it. This place has the best ramen I've ever eaten in the North American Continent. The price is a little bit more but you get your money's worth. At first, the place is small but as you move in to the dinning area, the servers yell out Japanese greetings. I love the dynamic of everyone just hanging out and the servers calling out the orders as they get out of the kitchen. Let's talk about the noodles. We had the Karaka Miso Ramen Êwhich Êis with the Soybean paste and pork noodle soup with Ippudo's special blend of hot spices, topped with pork chashu, cabbage, kaiware radish, menma, fresh grated ginger, and scallions. It was wonderful. You have to mix the grated ginger. It's not really that spicy at all. It was a treat. Add a pork belly into the order to get some more meat. It was amazing and I'm glad. I will be coming back for this when I visit New York again. I think Ippudo is underrated. We should have gone back for dinner instead of going somewhere pricey. You have to go here.

best ramen in NY hands down. Êthe ramen is made onsite and broth is divine. ÊI wish the Êsoft boiled eggs were slightly more running and you had the selection of toppings as you do at the Ippudo in Tokyo but nevertheless this is probably the only restaurant i go back to more than once in NY (why go to somewhere more than once where are so many i'm yet to try??) love it!

Everything at Ippudo is great... two of my favorites are the pork buns and the green tea creme brulee. The huge wait time is worth it the first few times you go, but less so after you have been a few times.

Why 4 stars? First, the pork hirata buns were pretty damn yummy. But they're more of an open-faced pork sandwich...bun..taco thingy? Anyways, most of the pork buns I have ever had in my life weren't exactly top notch. So I can safely say this one blew the others out of the water. The actual bun is soft and fluffy. The pork is juicy, a bit fatty (just the way I like it), and flavorful. The ratio between bun and pork was spot on for me. Usually, other pork buns have too much freaking dough and a dry ass filling. So thumbs up! All of these reviews rave about the Akamaru Modern with Kakuni. My friend ordered it and I tried it. I admit, it was good. But I liked my dish WAYYYYYYY more. I had Shiromaru Hakata Classic with Kakuni. The broth was sooooo yummy. I don't really know how to explain it well... but it had a somewhat sweet aftertaste. Both the pork loin and pork belly were so tender. It basically melted in my mouth. Price wise... I think these bowls of ramen are definitely worth it. I mean they're HUGE. I'm so sad that I didn't get the chance to finish mine. But I was just so freaking full. As for the pork buns, they're kind of on the small side. Even though they're good, I don't think I would buy them again for another $4. As for the service, I did not like some of the hostesses. Two of the three were very rude. The one that led us to our table was nice though. As for the chefs and waiters. THUMBS UP. They were great and attentive. Really warm and welcoming. One of the waiters was trying to be playful too. He saw that I couldn't finish my ramen, so he told me "You aren't finishing your ramen? I worked so hard to make those noodles downstairs. I slaved away making them" Hehe Anyways, 4 stars and worth it if you've got good company for some good conversation while you wait at the bar.

Great Ramen, amazing pork buns. I was at a crossroads when I had a pork bun and chicken bun, and was trying to figure out which was better.....then the soup came. At this point everything was so good I gave up and now I figure they deserve 5 stars for keeping me in a state of complete satisfaction. Thank you. Love the booths and design of restaurant too, even the trip to the bathroom included a peek into the kitchen for an inside scoop on how they make the buns.

Went there last nite, waited about 30 minutes for a table which is expected, so many ppl still waiting. There's happy hour from 5pm-8pm you get 2 for 1 Kirrin or Sapporo for $6.

After reading so many positive yelp reviews, I decided to finally try the place myself. I went at 6pm on a tuesday, so the wait wasn't too bad, but they don't seat you until the whole party is there. It's communal seating, and all the servers and cooks yell something indistinguishable each time someone is seated, or when a plate is brought out, which can get annoying. We had the pork buns, and it was amazing. There was mayo and lettuce in there, which was unexpected, but still good. ÊIt's basically a slab of pork fat, which would normally freak me out, but it was delicious nonetheless. We also tried the philly cheesesteak spring roll, which was a long spring roll with chedder cheese and beef in it. ÊAlso completely unexpected, since it was a ramen place, but it was the bomb diggity. Lastly, the ramen....I got the classic bowl and it came with two big slabs of pork (which beared a striking resemblance to turkey) half of a soft boiled egg, and some random veggies. ÊRamen was cooked perfectly, and the broth was really tasty. However, after a couple bites, it all became really salty, to the point where it was just not edible anymore. ÊThis place is really overrated, with the wait time and the prices ($14 bowl of ramen??), so if I ever went back, which is unlikely, I'd fill up on pork buns and appetizers and skip the ramen completely. ÊIt's just not worth it for mediocre ramen, and I would know, since I'm asian

I always have an amazing time when I go to Ippudo. The food is consistently good. A touch salty but that is expected from Ramen. My suggestion is if you go on a weekend's sure you have ample time to hang. Get a beer and some peppers at the bar. Maybe a pork bun..okay definitely get the pork bun maybe two, and just enjoy the people watching till your table is called. Remember that with any Ramen order opt to get the egg on top. It makes all the difference in the world.

If everything I've eaten on the menu was completely satisfying to me, it would've gotten 5 stars. First off, obviously their ramen isn't instant noodle so don't think that it is. Totally nothing like the 50 cent packages that you buy at the super market. Noodles are handmade and the broth is quite good. The only downside to these noodle dishes is that I wish they came with more meat! You can buy a side of pork belly which is absolutely decadent by the way. While it is obviously more expensive than other establishments, you're paying for the ambient dining experience as it is a lovely place.

The wait at this place is ridiculous. It's the only place I've ever eaten at where people line up outside before they open. Unbelievable. That said, Ippudo's pretty darn good.

We first went there on a Saturday evening and was told the wait is 1 hour 45 min. It was a cold evening, thus we bailed.

the wait was pretty short at 11:20am on a sunday. best of the best: * pork buns - my pork was mostly fat, but that's what makes it good. Êsucculent, sweet and slight spicy with mayo. good: * Akamaru Modern (extra egg, char su and noodles) - u can see they make their noodles using a machine next to the bathrooms. Êthe noodle taste fresh and bouncy, but i prefer thicker noodles. Êthe extra egg is different from the half egg that comes standard in that it is marinated. Êthe char su is quite thick and with all the appetizers we have ordered, i was too stuffed for the extra char su and noodles. so-so: * fried green peppers - spicy especially if you eat the seeds. Êthe seasoning powder makes it a bit interesting * chicken karage - fried chicken, nothing special miss: * philly cheese eggroll - not that it taste bad, just weird... Êone bite and i wish we hadn't ordered it.

A bit overrated, and quite frankly very overpriced. I didn't have to wait very long since I got there jut as they opened, but I can't say that I was completely blown away by their ramen. The flavor has a bit of a fusion flair to it and really didn't meet the bar that has been set by a few California-based ramen places like Shinsengumi and Daikokuya. Combined with the exuberant prices, somewhat tacky decor that mixes traditional Japanese noodle houses with a mid-scale lounge (a bit reflective of their food), I would only give this place about 2 1/2 stars. I will, however, credit them for their pork buns which was quite delicious and succulent.

What is there to be said that hasn't already been said? I came here on a pork mission, and I left heavily satisfied. I usually get the akamaru modern with extra kakuni.

I braced myself for a long wait since I've heard and read that it's difficult to get into this restaurant. Luck would have it that we were seated 20 minutes after arrival! The service was all around friendly. Our waiter was very attentive and never failed to refill our water glasses. We ordered the Karaka men, Shriomaru Hakata Classic (Tonkotsu) Ramen, and Samurai Ribs. The Karaka men came with a huge scoop of grated ginger that you mix into the broth. Because I happen to love ginger, I liked how it accented the already spicy broth. However, the ginger together with the minced pork rendered the broth very chunky and not as pleasant to sip. I did enjoy the flavors though. The Tonkotsu had a very nice broth, but I found the noodles too thin and did not have enough of a bite to stand up against the robust broth. The Samurai Ribs were excellent. Both the orange dipping sauce and orange chile complemented the ribs very well. We'll definitely be back the next time we're in town. Hopefully, we'll be as lucky with the wait as we were this time round.

Don't eat here. First of all, the wait here is completely insane, so by the time you get to your table, you're over it. Not to mention the complete pea-brained buffoons running the hostess stand. We came in with 6 for our party and they said they weren't accommodating a party of 6 that night. What? Uh okay. So basically they refuse to move the 2 top tables to accommodate 6 people. What about your oversized booths? The service here is mediocre, but the hostesses--all 4 of them were so incompetent, it blew my mind. When we asked for the wait time frame, they quoted 2.5 hours and looked at us, as if to dare us to put our names down. Not worth it. This place is just an overhyped restaurant who got too big for their britches. Oh, and one more thing--the ramen is awful--seriously. In conclusion, if you're into trendy looking places with bad food--go ahead, but don't say I didn't warn you.

Expect a standard 2 hour wait if you go at regular dinner/lunch hours, doesn't matter what day of the week. But its worth it. Go put your name down and go shopping at union square while you wait. Check in with the hostess to make sure she knows you've come back. Or order drinks and appetisers at the bar. It is super loud in there and the waitstaff/chefs are always yelling in quasi-Japanese (hardly any of the staff are actually japanese but it doesn't matter the food is that good). You must order a serve (or two) of the Pork Hirata buns. Hands down amazing. Akamaru Modern Ramen: my favorite because it comes with pork belly instead of pork loin. So tasty. The spicy ramen is also great, although not really very spicy so don't be afraid of it. Pork ribs appetiser is also delicious.

Excellent ramen restaurant with really solid service. We went early (arrived at 6PM) so we could avoid the usual wait--and we were seated immediately. I'd never been there so I went ahead and ordered two things off the appetizer menu in addition to my ramen. ÊBetween the two of us, we had the Modern Ramen, the Karaka Ramen (with onsen--which means they added a soft poached egg), chicken wings, pork buns, and a cold sake. ÊThe wings were fantastic! Sweet and spicy, with a nice crunchy exterior. ÊThe pork buns were presented with the properly soft, fluffy steamed bun wrapped around the slice of perfectly seasoned pork. The entire experience was great! Except...we ordered too much food. I'd have ordered one ramen, and split it between the two of us, and perhaps if we wanted, we could have added an extra bit of noodes to the bowl, called Kaedama. Ê We couldn't take our leftovers home. They don't allow it because they believe that the ramen quality will suffer as leftovers, and they want you to enjoy their food exactly as they serve it. ÊThat's my only negative thing to say--I'd liked to have taken my leftover ramen home.

Ive been to Momofuku on previous trips, i thought was really good but i can get ramen in LA that is just as good if not better. This blows anything in LA out of the water. We went to Ippudo two times on my trip and still wish i could have gone more & to this day i'm still thinking about the meals that we had. I think next time I will get a hotel across the street so i can eat there every night. The pork buns filled with marinated pork belly that melted in my mouth fried peppers that were sweet and delicious, but to top it all the the Miso Ramen was one of the best things i have ever eaten. i savored every last drop they probably didn't have to wash my bowl because when i was done it was perfectly clean. I also had the Akamaru Modern Ramen that was also very good as well and is there most popular dish. There is a bit of a wait but it was worth it and it was allot faster than they said. i cant wait till i go back to NY so i can Visit Ippudo again. By the way Please Please open a Ippudo in LA or OC.

it was pretty good, but I went for lunch. ÊIt seems dinner is the way to go. ÊAmazing?... about what I thought. ÊI would definitely go back to try for dinner. ÊI got the hirata chicken wings, pork buns, akamaru modern with nitamago, and some special seafood sizzling appetizer. Êwings were tasty but a bit salty. Êthe ramen was fresh with firm noodles which I like. Êpork buns were very good... that sizzling seafood dish was not so good. ÊI would give this place a solid 3.75 stars.

If you like authentic homemade Japanese ramen, bingo. Shoyu ramen was amazing, thin noodles that taste homemade, great broth- not too salty. Go early before 6pm or you will wait forever. The agedashi dofu was to die for. Tried the pork buns based on the reviews thinking it was a nikuman so if that's what you are expecting, then don't waste belly space. I was totally satisfied with my experience here. Also had the sesame powdered cucumbers, yum! I'm half Japanese and very picky about my ramen and this hit the spot!

The chefs and employees cheer for you as you walk through the hallway to your seat. AWESOME. I ordered the Akamaru modern which was recommended to me, and I will recommend it to you as well. The broth was very hearty and smooth, the noodles didn't feel heavy and thick like processed noodles do because you know why? Take a quick trip to the restroom downstairs, before the restroom doors you will see a long narrow window and behind that you will see why their noodles are VERY FRESH.This is absolute the best modern-noodle place in NYC.

Ramen is amazing - esp the broth. ÊI did the classic - the pork was slightly overdone which is to be expected since it's so thin. ÊYou can order an extra plate of noodles to go in your broth, which I like. ÊIt was only 2 of us, and it was still a 30 min wait on a late weeknight. ÊThe atmosphere was really nice inside, despite being busy. ÊThe pork buns and chicken buns are the go-to appetizer. ÊExcellent service. ÊI'd definitely come here again, and will tell my friends - but wouldn't wait more than what we did.

So at the start of the NYC Ramen race, Ippudo comes out of the block strong.....sprints for a few meters and SPLAT....falls around the last turn, tumbling and bringing down Menchanko-tei with it. Setagaya crosses the finish line, arms pumping in triumph. Sapporo (the one on 49th and Broadway ) and Momofuku settle for 2nd and 3rd, respectively.... Sorry Ramen lovers, Ippudo earns only 2 stars because of their TERRIBLE wait staff. They don't get orders right and good luck finding them when Êyou need water, condiments or a check. Strangely enough the waiters/waitresses were SOOOO friendly! This very nice waiter, not ever ours, stopped by and explained to us an appetizer we ordered was in the shape of a kanji character meaning "America". When I went to the bathroom, this other dude opens the door for me, looks inside and sees tissues strewn about and proceeds to pick every single one..even after I vehemently told him he didn't have to do that! Then he starts wiping clean the sink area. So nice! But again there's this schizophrenic aspect to the staff I couldn't get! And this is not a fluke because it's the second time I've been here and gotten the same bad service. This place reminds me of one the best Korean places (Kunjip) in Manhattan I will no longer frequent just because of its lousy service. Owners take note....delicious food is only half the battle. The food is very good...which is why it pains me to give it only two stars. The shoyu was very good...the ramen was on point!! The broth was so light and had just the right level of saltiness...good stuff! My buddies ordered the miso ramen...also very good. We ordered some appetizers -- but the names escape me -- one was this very tasty egg omelette (the aforementioned kanji shaped app) and some very light pork slices with radish. Everything we ate was on point! Oh and another issue...yes I know it just opened and there's a lot of hype going on here...but c'mon..a 50 minute wait on a MONDAY night!??!?! Well I guess I can't blame that one on the restaurant..but it just stings a bit to wait that long and get wack service....

First of all, the 2 for 1 happy hour special on beer made the wait much more tolerable. I kind of figured that since this place had opened a while ago, it was a warm day (who wants Ramen on warm days? apparently a lot of people) , and it was a Tuesday there wouldn't be a wait, i was wrong, 30 mins for 2 people. Which really isn't bad at all, so i stuck it out and was very pleased that i did. Started off with some edamame, which was cold and i prefer mine warm, but tasty nonetheless. The real star of the appetizer show was the pork belly, which tastes exactly like a vietnamese dish i dont know how to spell, but was great. As for the ramen, i went with the traditional style (Shiromaru NY?) and thought it was pretty amazing. I also got to try some of the modern style, and have to say i prefered the traditional one by far. It was just much smoother. I went for the kae-dama and got extra noodles for $2, but in the end kind of wish i didnt. I finished it all, but really shouldn't have. Overall, good looking place and nice service too, so yeah, i'm a fan.

Yes, the food is good, but the wait sucks... big time. You will probably wait up to 45 minutes if you go at a prime time such as dinner and there really is no place but the bar to wait... and the bar is packed. To top that off, when you do finally sit down you will be sharing a table with several other groups of people depending on your party size. I can't exactly hate on them for this fact, it makes perfect sense since the wait would probably be that much longer if they left seats empty. Clearly the food was good considering I give it 4 stars. The Ramen was delicious (I went with the classic dish) and the pork buns were good as well but they were overflowing with mayonnaise which kinda sucked. All in all, if you like ramen you can't really go wrong here. I can't really tell the difference between good or bad ramen, so if you don't mind the wait, its worth a go.

so. i was craving for ramen yesterday. shit happens, you know... i email my faithful foodie friends to notify them of my craving. they concur. the question: where? the answer: rai rai ken? naaah, i go there too often. let's try somewhere else. i spend hours of my work time (getting paid, mind you!) yelping (the verb pertaining to this site, not *actually* yelping, as it might cost me my job (and i haven't lost my sanity (yet!))) and i read extensively about ippudo (yes, i read every single review!), since i always hang out in the area and walk by it-and its perpetual queue-fairly often. god, that was a convoluted paragraph. looks awesome. reviews are very enticing. i tell my friends. they say yes. well, one of them at least. i leave work 10 minutes early, hope that it will give me a head start to beat all these damn ramen-craving bastards in line. it actually worked! i am sitting with my friend and we order the famed and highly recommended pork buns. fluffy. tasty. yum yum. wait... what? gone? in 1-2 bites? $4??? arrrgh! can't remember the last time i paid $4 for a bite. my chinese friend says you can get them for a buck in flushing. granted, less tasty and more greasy. but still. for a buck. the soup: tasty; the broth: rich and yummy; the noodles: slightly chewy. i guess this is what freshly-made ramen is all about. so, everything is decent, but somehow it doesn't blow my mind. and it is overpriced. dessert? disaster! Êsomehow, i never noticed the phonetic congruity of these two words until today. their spicy ice cream was a joke. it's basically that crappy creamy green tea ice cream that you find in pots in the supermarket, except that it was topped with ground black pepper on one half, and red chili-like powder on the other. lame. and the matcha brulee is miles away from the matcha, the creme, and the brulee parts. the top was not even remotely burnt or crispy. the cream looked and tasted like someone who's been on an intensive seaweed + green tea diet for a month just threw up or took a mushy dump in the dish. and has the nerve to charge you $7 for it. which is why my friend and i stoically finished it off. plus, people are dying of hunger in the world. we can't waste food. go get good, real green tea ice cream at sharaku's instead. and for cheaper. and if you want that extra kick, go get some wasabi ice cream from soba-ya's. and for cheaper, too. to cut it short, this place is seriously overrated. and the decor pretentious. perhaps the people too. though i can never have enough japanese waiters cutesiness. plus, keep in mind it's a chain, people! chains are inherently evil! and morally wrong! they suck the blood of innocent children and sacrifice cute fluffy rabits! and then use it in their food. support local businesses. go to rai rai ken, where the ramen is soggy and squiggly, the prices lower and the decor grimier, the way i like it.

Proof that soup can be just as delicious and fattening as a Porterhouse. Ippudo is our standard for ramen in New York. Sure it's a trendy place, but it still serves solid food and that's what counts, right? The tonkatsu broth is rich and luscious, the pork belly slices are so so tender, the ramen is fresh. Our favorite appetizer is the steamed pork bun, which is kind of like a chinese steamed pork bun except fancified, and the bun is folded up like a taco. Different, modern, but delicious! The servers are super-friendly and there's a cute little bar up front while you wait for your table.

I still crave this Ramen! Êmmm. Overall great experience. The wait was about 20 minutes. ÊThe decor is very artsy and modern Asian. Ê The ramen was delicious, although I agree with some Êother reviews that it was a tad oily, but probably due to the Pork fat that is in the soup.

Their miso-based ramen have such hearty, flavorful broth. Yum... When I go there, I chug the yummy broth down - all the way.

Might get flamed, but I felt this placed was very overrated and extremely overpriced. I tried this place twice, once for lunch, and once for dinner. ÊThere's no waiting time for lunch, but you better make reservations for dinner. Anyway, when you think of Ramen, you think of instant noodles. ÊBut their ramen doesn't look nor taste like the typical instant noodles. ÊI think their noodles are fresh. ÊAt any rate, both times I went, I ordered 2 different soup noodles. ÊI couldn't get over the soup base; it was creamy and had a special to it that I can't put my taste buds on, but I didn't care for it. ÊAnd especially at $13 to $16 for a bowl of noodles either.

Dined here on a Tuesday night after receiving recommendations from multiple friends. Got there a little before 10 and waited less than half an hour for a table. The interior decor was very nice and had a very "trendy" feel to it. I ordered the special ramen (I forget exactly what it was, but it was spicy). To my surprise and delight, our entire table's food arrived in less than five minutes after ordering. Not the BEST ramen I've ever had in my life, but the noodles are good and the broth was excellent! It's a little over-priced as far as ramen goes ($13+ for a relatively smallish bowl), but I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the neighborhood with a craving for some good ramen.

Rounding up here with 4 stars. First, the wait is terribly long, even with reservations. The ramen is delish, albeit a bit pricey. They serve plum wine which is a nice break from the soju/sake/beer offerings. The servers were really nice (and some of them were really cute!), although they do try to rush you a bit. Would go back if I were in the area but much better ramen can be had in SoCal (I was visiting) for much less. Not too far from the trains either.

Definitely one of a kind ramen tasting place, although I must say price for ramen noodles in Asian market would be far more affordable without losing the taste. I grew up with ramen noodles and it's one of my favorite hobby food. I tasted both soy sauce based and meat based broth, both are delicious.

My night here ended up being kinda pricey, but considering how tasty everything was and how well we were taken care of, I can consider it money well spent. ÊWe split an order of pork buns and a bottle of Shintaro sake and each ordered a variation of the Akamura ramen. The ramen was very tasty, but the broth is the real star of the show. ÊNoodles are noodles, and the toppings were pretty innovative (egg, pork belly), but the I really have never tasted broth that good. ÊAlso, I'm glad we ordered a bottle of sake, it was one of the smoothest sakes I've had. ÊIt's served in a small shot glass in a wooden box. ÊOur waitress told us that you pour the sake til it overflows the glass and goes into the box. ÊThe wood alters the flavor of the sake and people drink from the box afterwards. ÊWe tried it and it definitely seemed to concentrate the flavors. ÊLove when I learn something new while out to eat.

They've done a good job with marketing and decoration, etc. but I feel like this place is over-hyped. ÊFood is decent (as in decent enough) but they make people wait in line outside the restaurant when half the place is empty -- we all agreed that it's their marketing tactic of creating a sense of exclusivity -- and the inside reminds me more of a club / bar than ramen joints that I'm more used to. ÊIf you're going for a particular experience, then Ippudo may be the right place, but if you're simply looking for a good bowl of ramen, there are tons of other places that serve similar or better ramen (taste-wise) with a lot less wait and less money.

we went early at 5:30 pm to make a reservation for 7:30pm. we got our table around 7:45pm. we had the chicken gizzard appetizer the scallop appetizer the special pate/oyster ramen the miso ramen the vegetarian special ramen the food was pretty good. it's pretty awesome that they have an off menu vegetarian option. the scallop had some interesting flavors ponzu, jalapeno, and some kind of herb. the vegetarian ramen had a nice light wasabi flavor. the noodles were very chewy and seemed fresh. overall, it was a pretty good experience but expect a wait and a higher price point.

the soup is great, but i dislike the type of ramen noodles that they have. that being said, their food is probably a 3 or so, but because of the price and wait, a 2 in total. also, when i went, i put my name on the list an hour before the rest of my group was supposed to arrive, but when everyone finally arrived i was placed at the end of the waiting list and had to wait an extra hour. i understand not taking reservations, but thats ridiculous.

went on a wed night with no reservation and thought we would have to wait a while when we arrived. but it was surprisingly short if you stand at the bar and indulge in a buy one get one free $6 happy hour beer!!! (3 bucks for asahi? sure! lets wait!) the staff was well trained and provided great team style service the open kitchen was fun to watch, everyone screams the usual greetings in japanese as you walk in or out which makes it so fun. great vibe, very new york -- if you're down for the atmosphere and the foodie suitable food! :) THE PORK/CK steamed buns are reminiscent of what david chang started at momfuku's -- but better since it's less pretenscious. super yummy. chef's special app came with 4 delightful tastes -- all PERFECTLY cooked. and perfect bites, i'll say no more just try it :) and i had the akamaru ramen -- delish! :) then the best surprise came when i went to the bathroom -- (not that kind), you follow a hallway downstairs (which was lead by a staff member (they are really good at hosting guests!) and there are two more kitchens down there with peep holes, and thru one of them Êyou see that there is a noodle maker machine -- yes i don't knwo the technical term but it was as magical sounding as that.-- and a staff member sitting there hand crafting these noodles that i had just made! INSTANT BONUS POINTS!!! seriously, who makes their noodles from scratch like that anymore. it's such a craft, treated with the upmost respect, and i digggg it :) i left this place utterly satisfied and completely happy.

this might be replacing daikokuya (downtown los angeles) as my all time favorite tonkotsu ramen. the broth and stewed pork get 6-stars. Êthe noodles are a littler slimmer than what i'm used to, but delicious as well. Êeverything--from the food, to decor, to service was perfect. Êi can normally eat a whole bowl of ramen + broth, no problem. Êbut here, the broth was so thick and rich that i couldn't finish! Êthat's a first.

After having been to Rai Rai Ken, Setagaya, and a few other Ramen shops, the noodles here were the best by far. Ê(Though to be fair, I definitely am partial to a pork bone broth, than a miso or soy sauce based broth, but the noodles themselves i found superior.) The noodles held firm the in broth, but were still soft in Êyour mouth. Ê ÊThe pork bone broth was delicious and was perfect for a cold day. Ê The pork belly topping was cooked perfectly, but reminded me of jangjorim. (stewed Korean beef, which is not bad, but perhaps not what i was expecting). The pork buns were very good and almost comparable to the ones at momofuku, but momofuku definitely wins in the pork bun battle. ÊThe service was responsive and competent and I dont really have any specific complaints other than somewhat poor english. ÊOverall, its just great warm, fatty goodness perfect for winter! ÊJust wash it down w/ some beer and you're set. ÊJust a warning, there is often a wait (ranging from 5-25 min), which is something that you might want to consider before going. ÊIf only i didnt have so many jewish friends who dont eat pork, i'd be there way more often.

Ippudo. ÊIn the East Village. ÊYum. Ê They make their own noodles (the proper thin egg kind) and they make their own broth. ÊMmmm garlic! ÊMmmm negi! ÊMmmm mysterious red stuff that you stir into the broth! ÊIt tastes the same as the other Ippudo location I'm familiar with in Ebisu, Tokyo. ÊThe NY location is larger and more trendy than any of the branches I've visited before. It is "pricey", but have you been to Momofuku? ÊThey're a home grown outfit (not from Japan) and a meal there costs about the same. ÊSo maybe it's NOT that pricey. ÊFor New York anyway. Ê I wish they'd open a branch in San Francisco. ÊYou can't get good ramen or noodles in aforementioned ramen to save your life. Ê Worth the flight and definitely belongs on the East Village ramen flight that my New York visits have become.

I just came back from dinner there tonight... it was my first time! ÊWe arrived just before 8pm and it was packed. ÊWe were told the wait time would be 1 hour and 20 minutes, but we were seated at 8:45pm. ÊThe decor is really nice.... its kind of loud, but its a really unique/cute spot. ÊWe were seated in this really cool booth, which faced the open kitchen. ÊBut, it looked like there were other long tables that were shared by multiple parties, so I think that if you wanted a spot with some privacy, request the booth! Ê We ordered the pork buns as an appetizer and they were really good. ÊI've never had pork buns like these- they were assembled sandwich style, had mayo, and good spicy kick! ÊWe each ordered ramen, which was beautifully presented. ÊBut, I think that of the three types of ramen we had, all three soups were a little on the salty side. ÊThis is unfortunate because I would be more inclined to go there more often if I didn't feel like I would get high blood pressure or something... Overall, it was decent place- nice ambiance and decent food, but I'll try other places before I go back.

I thought I would start off my Yelp journey with a high by reviewing Ippudo's. :) (it can only go downhill from here....) oh man is this place gooooood. I went with a group of 5 on a Saturday for lunch, and the wait was only 15 minutes. How did they know that my hunger timer was about to go off?! Service was great- polite, quick, and helpful. The pork bun appetizer was amazingly flavorful and moist. The agedashi tofu was super good as well (not overly fried or overly oily), but I would've preferred a thinner piece of soft tofu. I ordered the special ramen (Tan-Tan Tiger Ramen). Can I dissect the soup base/noodle type/ingredients down so that this review could possibly be helpful? No. All I know is that it was delicious, so does anything else really matter? I loved the hard boiled egg, the texture of the noodles, and the flavor of the broth (it was slightly spicy, not too salty, and just plain tasty). Indeed, ~$14 for noodle soup is kinda pricey...but I can't wait to lose another $14 to Ippudo's. BTW, if you go downstairs to the restroom...you will pass by a narrow window where you can watch them make the ramen noodles. It's almost pee-in-your-pants exciting. Almost. hardeeharhar.

I'm pretty sure this place is heaven. But I don't deserve to give it 5-stars because I've only been here once, and obviously the other reviewers know it way better than I. Yes, I got a refill on my noodles. Yes, I got the pork belly. Silly questions. I have been to a couple other ramen places in the nabe and think that this one is the best in terms of clean broth flavor and clarity, careful cutting and manufacture of noodles, expert timing to cook said noodles into perfect silky yet slightly toothy state. I'm not Japanese, but I'm pretty sure that this is how it's supposed to be. I sat at the bar but enjoyed turning around and looking at all the decor and diners behind me.

I'd heard some great things about Ippudo, so I knew I needed to give it a try. Knowing how crowded ramen shops can get, I decided to try it out for a weekday lunch. I had to agree with everything I'd heard. The ramen was amazing, most definetly the best I've had in New York or anywhere else for that matter (short of Tokyo, of course). My only complaint would be the long waiting times, especially for dinner. After going once, I tried to bring my friends back on a Friday evening, but the 1-2 hour wait was just too much.

Ippudo serves one of the best bone-based ramen in the city employing a thinner type of noodle (almost vermacilli like), which I like.

First time I came to Ippudo, I loved the food. ÊYeah, the wait is definitely long, but it didnt stop me from wanting to go back. Ê It's been 5 months since that visit, and went here last night. ÊThere were only 2 of us, so the wait at 6:30pm turned out to be approx 45 mins. Hostess was friendly, waitress was semi friendly but got the job done. Ordered the hirata buns, and it felt like the portion size shrunk since I last had it. ÊAt $4 each bun, it barely had any pork meat. ÊStill tasty, but not as good as I remembered it being. ÊThe akamaru modern ramen was too rich and salty for my taste. ÊI love broth, but this one felt too heavy and greasy.

If you took ice cream, infused it with pork fat, and melted it down into a hot, steaming puddle, it would not be half as deliciously smooth, rich, and creamy as Ippudo's ramen broth. Forget the noodles - although they're good too - you could make a meal just out of that heavenly broth.

Hmmm its really a 3.5 and not a 3. So we had this for lunch today so going to try to remember everything in detail. The ambience of the restaurant was really cool. It had a really nice modern japanese decor and as you walk in you see a wall of bowls. Seating looked fairly limited however so it is easy to see why a line can easily form for this place. We started off the meal with the cucumbers and the pork hirata buns. The cucumbers were okay but the pork hirata buns were awesome. the sweetness from the sauce, the tenderness of the chashu, and the perfection of the buns were an awesome combination. I ordered the shio ramen with a side of the pork bowl. I am from California so I have to say that Daikakuya's pork bowl surpasses this by far. The soup base for the ramen was pretty good. The noodles were average. But the downer was that the chashu was dryer than a charcoaled piece of steak. I was wondering how the tenderness of the pork in the hirata buns didn't transfer over to the chashu in the ramen. Good ramen, but not in my top 5. From what I have read though, it is probably the best in New York so you got a good spot here. Just that there are better spots elsewhere in the US. If I was visiting NY again and needed a ramen fix, i'd probably be back.

definitely worth the hype, esp the pork buns. not sure if it's worth the 2 hr wait, I don't think ANY food is worth that long of a wait....but try to go there when it's not as busy...like early dinner during the weekdays. yummmmmm

I never liked ramen till Ippudo. I tried it for the first time two years ago and have been trying to find an SF equivalent since. It's a little pricier than your average bowl of ramen, but it's worth it. I was in NY this past weekend and Ippudo was on the top of my food list. The ramen is just delicious and the broth is really flavorful. You also have to get an order of the pork buns. Amazing and melts in your mouth. The pickled veggies are good too. The lines are crazy here so we always try to go at off-peak times.

Overall it has been a good experience. The atmosphere is hip and fun for college students and young couples. If you go during the weekend, expecting around 30 mins wait. It's a little pricey for me ($4 for a small bun, and $14-15 for the noodle soup). Especially for people who have bigger appetite, might need 1 or 2 extra noodles, Kae-Dama ($2-4).

The ridiculously tasty pork buns, good service, nice atmosphere, and kind host gives this place a solid 4. I wouldn't really say this place is worth the 1 1/2 hour wait on a Tuesday night but the experience was pleasant overall. My boyfriend and I both ordered the Akamura Modern and the pork buns. Pork buns are a must at this place! The ramen on the other hand were merely satisfactory to me and not really worth the $14 price tag. The pork buns were delicious but $8 for two is a little much. The noodles itself were quite delicious but I wasn't feeling the broth. Maybe because I'm used to putting tons of oyster sauce in to my Pho but this broth didn't have much flavor to me. It was just okay. Also, there was hardly any meat and the few pieces that I did have, mostly consisted of fat. That was a little disappointing. I recommend it if you're just visiting New York for the experience but I doubt I would ever come back.

Simply not worth the wait. Their pork-buns are great, but their ramen is mediocre at best. It's tough to get good ramen in the city (try minca, rai rai ken) so if you need a ramen fix I suppose Ippudo will do. You always have to wait at least a half hour before you get a table and it's annoying squeezing through all of the people waiting at the closet of a bar.

After reading excellent reviews I was pretty intrigued with the place. Especially I live in the area and every time I was passing by the restaurant seemed to be packed. I made a reservation and went there with my friends. We were all pretty excited to try it out. The service was ok though the hostess was pretty rude on the phone as we were a bit late due to heavy rain and tried to call in to make sure our reservation was still on but she just cut us off. Anyways when we got there the waitress was nice and we placed our orders. We ordered ramen which is pretty raved in all the reviews. The ramen was ok, nothing special. While having my dish it turned out that spinach had Êlots of sand in it! The management reaction was not professional at all. They didn't offer me anything to compensate me for that sad experience, not even a dessert and at the end I had to make sure they would not charge me for my entree that was full of sand. ÊIt was a really bad and disappointing experience!

The first time I came here and tried the pork bun, it was so good and I couldn't wait to come back. ÊThis time around, it was still really good but not as amazing as the first time. ÊStill, I destroyed 3 orders of this with my friends. ÊI ordered the Akumaru ramen this time and it was as good as I remembered it the first time. ÊI also added a hard boiled egg and some extra pork. ÊThe broth was very thick and filling and even though I didn't think I ate that much ramen, I was pretty full. ÊIf you have soup left over, it costs only $2 for extra ramen which is a good deal since everything here is so expensive. ÊI really enjoyed my ramen here but this place is pricey. ÊExpect to pay around $20 for ramen and if you get pork buns or any extras or drinks, you can easily spend over $40. ÊAlso, expect to wait a minimum of 40 minutes which we waited when we got there around 11:30am on a Saturday but when we were done and leaving at 1pm, the wait time was 2 hours long. ÊIf I had to wait 2 hours and I had to spend $40 for my meal, I'm not sure I would say it is worth it.

I find myself pretty lucky to come during a lunch hour and wait only half an hour to be seated. As soon as our starving selves heard the mouth watering news that we were next to be seated, we were berated with a japanese greeting from all the waiters and waitresses. Charming initially, but a repeated offense that loses its charm. I began with some pork buns as an appetizer. The buns themselves were fluffy and well done and the pork was tender and fatty. However, this is a pricey item that could easily be made at home. For my main dish, I ordered the akamaru modern from suggestions by past yelp reviewers and I was not disappointed. The soup itself is very different from any ramen I have ever had. Don't expect a light soup if you are looking for your hangover cure. The noodles were fantastic and the pork was even better. A bit on the pricey side but certainly, great ramen that deserves the vast number of reviews it has received on yelp.

Their ramen really are very very good. The appetizers are mostly delicious as well. The only thing that's preventing us from going there more often is the long wait. I think they only let you make a reservation (or like put down your name) in person. One time we went at around 9:30pm and the wait was 2 hours (ridiculous!!). Another time we went at 6:40ish and got seated at 7:20ish. I don't think I would wait 2 hours for the food unless I'm not yet hungry and don't mind hanging around the bar, which is pretty crowded too since it's a small area.

After living in Japan for several years, I can honestly say that the ramen here is legit. It's not the best ramen in the world, but it is the best ramen I've had in the states, and I've tried quite a few places. I personally recommend the classic as the thick tonkotsu broth and thin noodles match perfectly in the traditional Hakata style. If you're in the mood to make a time of it the pork buns, pickled cucumber, and shishito peppers are all excellent (a bit pricey but worth it if you're only here once in a great while). Add excellent service (although beastly waits), and you have a 5 star restaurant, new York could use a few more like it.

am a big time ramen eater, being half Korean. I was not into this place so much. Upon arriving, there was a 45 min wait so we waited in the lounge. It was jam-packed with all the young asian NYU students, sporting backpacks. Once seated, I ordered the pork buns and the tori ramen. The pork buns had SO much mayo. GROSS. The noodles in my ramen were really fresh and delish. The broth wasn't bad but a little barren on the veggies and meat. The bowl and noodle portion was very small. I could've easily eaten a second one. The space is way too trendy and modern, it was not cozy at all, which I feel a noodle house should be. So, there it is. I finally went and I have to say...disappointed. I guess I'm just the minority on this one.

I really really loved this place! My boyfriend and I didn't know that they close and reopen for dinner at 5pm so we walked down the street to chickalicious to kill some time which ended up killing my boyfriend's appetite. Anyways, we were at the front of the line and got seated as soon as they reopened. They have huge tables that seat more than six with interesting center pieces. There are smaller tables in the back as well as booths for BIG groups. I cannot remember which exact ramen I ordered, but it was GOOOOOOOOD! Ren's Ramen in Bethesda, MD is en epic fail compared to here. Maybe it was cause I was cold and the hot ramen warmed me up, but also I love my food salty and the ramen was definitely salty. I really hate when my noodles aren't cooked fully, but these were good! All in all, best ramen I've had!

service needs A LOT of work, but the food is terrific. You won't find ramen noodles like theirs on St. Marks. Ippudo has made-to-order type noodles that aren't deep fried in MSG and oil, so it's healthier and tastes great. The broth is heavy, so they should maybe add some fresh seasoning or garnish on it. picked onions? gimchi? something to make it more refreshing and balanced. the highlight of my dining experience there were the pork buns. the buns are cooked perfectly and the stickiness of the sauce, the slight heat, and the pork are perfectly balanced. my Per Se chef friend thinks it's better than the ones at Chef Chang's momofuku restaurants. go for their early evening happy hour and get a beer + one for free. Kirin is my choice when it comes to Japanese beers. Other than the usual Sapparo, Kirin, (maybe Asahi? don't remember), they don't have much else in terms of imported beers.... I think they could use a little help at the bar to come up with more thoughtful and creative drinks. service is...polite, the way japanese tend to be. but at the end of the night, i had to ask for the check at least three times. it took them forever. were they busy? no. plenty of empty seats to go around. and the hostesses there are idiots. one of them thought that we'd left after waiting for forty-five minutes..........we had to remind them that we were STILL WAITING 4 times. they should work on a better seating system for their patrons instead of leaving us anxious and waiting, wondering if they'd forgotten us.

Date Visited: November 8th People: Megan My tab: ~$30 Very cool sounding place, had to check it out once people started comparing it to momofuku's ramen. The place is no reservations, and just barely got in without a wit around 5:30. Very clubby, perhaps over the top atmosphere on the inside, may have seemed more appropriate if this wasn't just a late lunch. Excellent Omakase, Sapporo on draft. ÊContrary to momofuku, the prize isthe broth, not the fixin's, which comes with a varety of spice. Noodles are solid, however this isn't a soba joint. As a general rule, I've never really found a japanese dessert I've loved, so I steered clear. All in all, I still prefer momofuku for the complete package and variety. The meal here's still a bargain in the city, especially with the atmosphere, all that steam from the kitchen and bass made me feel like I was in a vegas show. Looking forward to more of the same when I hit Tokyo in March.

For a ramen joint, this place was Fancy! ÊFor what they're charging for noodles in broth, you know you're paying for the ambiance. ÊSuper high ceilings and chanted greetings by all the servers and kitchen staff when you enter, set the ton of formality. ÊWe were lucky to get a corner booth for a group of 4, so that was a change from the usually cramped spaces Japanese restaurants offer.

ÊI got one of their special ramen (the name of which escapes me now), which was good but nothing I couldn't get for 7 bucks at another ramen joint.

My husband and I finally walked to try the so-called "best ramen in town" after months we have heard about it. We ordered the basic shiro ramen and there seasonal special; they were great- multi flavored soups, perfect cooked thin noodles. We also ordered a cabbage salad and a spicy pork tofu; they were simple but really tasty. Yummy!!! The price was a little rip off, if you look at their simple food materials. But the deco and service were way better than Momofuko. The only draw back is the long line of waiting( we had waited for an hour), and the bartender, for some reason, he had to wash glasses at the same time when he mixed drinks up. We were worried that he may accidentally mix the dish cleaner with cocktails...come on, you guys charge $15 for a bowl of noodles, can't you just hire one more person to wash up glasses?

Must try: Hirata buns (pork, please!) ÊThe other appetizers are not as strong, but the Hirata buns are insanely addictive. ÊThe Japanese definitely know their mayo. Ramen is less about the noodles and more about the broth, but the noodles are perfect: springy and toothsome.

Out of the three times I have visited, I have yet to be disappointed. Minus the wait. The first time I had the Kogashi Miso ramen with the extra layer of oil. It is heavy, but surprisingly, despite the extra oil, it does not feel greasy or too overwhelmingly strong. The next visit I had the one with spicy paste + the mentaiko rice bowl. The lunch menu during the weekday had more ramen flavors and the extra $3 bowl delicious [but i love spicy cod roe]. The most recent I had the Shiromaru classic - and the pickled ginger was so clarifying and cleansing. And of course, the pork steamed buns were soo good. except small and a bit overpriced. But with a friendly and welcoming environment, I always enjoy my experience at ippudo. Ê **Ask for fresh garlic! you get a garlic press to put fresh minced garlic in your ramen bowl. Soooo good**

This was only my second time experiencing ramen (the last was over two years ago and obviously did not leave an impression since I have not been back since) and I cannot wait to go back to Ippudo. Separate and apart from the food, I was not necessarily a fan of the restaurant experience itself - we showed up after 9:15pm on a Sunday night and it was extremely crowded. I was a tad turned off by the "closed" sign in the door that left first-timers like us questioning whether they should bother coming in - assume it was a fluke? We were told it could be a 45 min to hour wait and unfortunately the bar area is not necessarily the most comfortable place to wait given the lack of seating. Once we were finally seated, the room was very loud and the staff was constantly rushing by which was a bit of an odd feeling for a Sunday night. I was also not necessarily a fan of sharing my table with 4 other randoms. The food, however, stands on its own and I would go back in a heartbeat. We shared the Chicken Wings and Pork Buns which were both delicious and everything came out very fast (much appreciated after the long wait). I had the Modern with seasoned bamboo shoots on top. We also shared an extra serving of noodles. Perfection in a bowl!

My Japanese friend told me about this place. So one day, when I was around the area, I decided to try their ramen. I was skeptical at first, because I saw that their ramen is similar to Momofuku's.. they both have pork slices, but after tasting their freshly made ramen, it changed my perspective. [I ordered the Akamaru Modern.] Not only was the ramen good, their soup was good too. I didn't have to feel guilty for leaving some of the soup behind. Their pork buns were also delicious. It had some pizazz, they put some spicy sauce that brings out the flavor. For the $13 ramen and $3 for an extra rice ball (lunch special), it was filling. Definitely a place to try.

My favorite ramen place of all time! The line to get in is usually super long. On a "good" day, which is middle of the week, it will take about 30-45 minutes of waiting for a table. On the weekend.... 1.5 hour at least. But then once you get that nice, big bowl of ramen in front of you, you'll know it was all worth it. The broth, the meat, the noodles... are just perfection. Appetizers are good too. =) It's a little bit pricey but really not too bad. It's about $14 for a bowl of ramen but at a less expensive place it will still be about $11 or $12, so not a huge difference.

I had ramen all over Nihon and this places compares. Very delicious ramen, great servers and welcoming atmosphere. Bowl of ramen is between $12 to $16. If solo, they seat you next to someone so that could either work for you or not. Tshirts were $35 so although I wanted one, I passed. Guess I'll just savor the memories.

The ramen is good. The wait then rush are terrible. The line on a Tuesday, early in the evening is telling- this is good stuff. The line on a Tuesday, early in the evening is telling- you'll wait then get handed a bill before your chopsticks leaves your hand. The Tori Tatsuta Age was a little on the bland side -Sakagura's tori age is much better. The ramen is fantastic. The services is as friendly as it can be for a place that is going to rush you out of the restaurant as fast as it can. ÊI had just put down my bowl from drinking the broth and was handed a cup of a tea and a bill. There are places with shorter waits, cheaper prices and less rush. ÊWhich is why I must give this place a 4/5 instead of a 5/5.

Ramen was pretty good, not exceptional that I would want to wait another hour for though. ÊWhen the ramen finally came to our table, there was a 5 minutes silence while we devoured the bowls. ÊWas that because it was delicious or because we were starving? ÊI can't really say. ÊWe also ordered their pork belly in steamed buns appetizer. ÊThat was outstanding!

The noodle was good, the soup was tasty, if you don't mind salty and greasy. Ê2 stars are for the service. I went to Ippudo for a good-bye party of a friend of mine (I actually was the one that recommended Ippudo in the first place). Got there later than everybody else. ÊThe counter lady wouldn't let me in. ÊShe said "I can't seat you." ÊI told her that I am meeting a big group of friends. ÊShe replies, "Doesn't matter. ÊYou can't be seated together with your friends. ÊThis is our policy!" -WTF? What kinda policy is this? ÊAnyway... finally got in contact with friends sitting down and asked for a menu. ÊNow the server told me "sorry we don't provide menu for someone who comes late. ÊIt's our policy" WHAT??? Ok, if my friends have finished their food, and lots of people are waiting, I can understand you need to seat more ppl so I'll have to give up my food. ÊBut hey, they were still eating, and they pretty much just got their food the moment I came in!! ÊWhy the hell shouldn't I be served!??? .... we were outraged and called another server. ÊHe agreed to give me a menu and I finally got my food... I will never come again. Bottom line: if you come with a big group, don't be late!!

As far as the food and experience are concerned, five stars for sure.

People love the ramen here and they're right, it is excellent. ÊBut I think the small plates are the real reason to go. ÊThe sesame cucumber is always refreshing and salty and delicious.

I never liked ramen before I tried the ramen at Ippudo. It is incredible and worth the 40+ minute wait (they don't take reservations). Other dishes that keep me going back: pork buns, the cucumber appetizer in miso sauce, and the lychee martinis (the best thing to make the wait pass...)

So I had to grab a quick lunch somewhere but wanted something substantial. Walking down the street I found Ippudo. While I normally don't take a chance on a noodle house (I have had some bad expereinces in the past) and have had the good stuff in Japan, I decided what the heck! I was greeted with a big hello and a cool atmosphere. I ordered the classic ramen without ginger (don't like it). On a hot day many would steer away from having hot soup but I found myself eating and drinking the broth down to the last drop. To finish up my experience I was givin some hot tea which hit the spot. A place to seek out and destroy the dish in front of you.

As a pork bun aficionado, I was eager to try the famous pork buns said to rival the fatty perfection of a Momofuku Noodle Bar bun. While the pork buns were good, they were by no means amazing. The glob of mayo and piece of lettuce atop the meat made it seem as though I was biting into a club sandwich..Not that there's anything wrong with that..it's just not what I want from my buns. So why 4 stars? It's all about the ramen. I tried the special Szechuan ramen and it was just as good as any bowl of ramen I had in Japan. ÊThe flavors of the broth were PERFECT, the kind of ramen Tampopo pays homage to. Can't wait to slurp up my next bowl.

6:30pm on Friday evening meeting up w 2 girlfriends, after 1.5hr wait w interventions in between to find out status of placement in line, I had to say the hostess was quite unfriendly about our inquiries both times. ÊGood that we did all the catching up chats while we were waiting, when we were finally called and placed in a commuter table w 3 of us in a row, the conversation became difficult to engage in such seatings, but we did most of our catchups and our stomaches were ready for some actions. The whole restaurant in the back's got a very hippie vibe, few long commuter tables along w some huge booth tables. Êwe ordered chicken wings (w my friend Wing's suggestion) and ribs for appetizers and akamaru modern. I have to say the chicken wing is the best i have tasted so far, even better than Blue Ribbon, UFC, and Bochon's chicken! the flavor and glaze blends tremendously well in my mouth that i beg for another piece, too bad none were left cos each order only came w 3 pc. ÊI told myself i'll order one all to myself next visit. ÊThe ribs was really delicious too but abit fatty. ÊThe service was very friendly once we got sat down and also very attentive, almost too attentive that they took away my plates that i wanted to savor more flavors out of it w remaining bites. ÊThough ramen was not bad (the broth was a little too rich to my taste) but honestly, i have to say that appetizers were the highlights of this place. ÊI'll try to go back at a different time when i don't have to wait for so long and try other things on the menu.

I have never tasted a great and authentic ramen since I move away from Southern CA. Ippudo I am a big fan of the classic ramen and karaka men ramen. It can be a little bit pricey, but it is definitely worth it. I went there at around 2:00 PM, and waited for around 30 minutes to get seated. The pork buns were also tender and juicy!

I had the second ramen item on the menu-the pork one...I do not remember offhand the name. I do remember trying to savor each slurp, and trying a little too hard. The broth looks amazing...cloudy and with promises of flavor, but all I really got was just a salty broth. Where is the flavor? A friend of mine got the better noodles...not sure why, but my Ramen noodles resembled a thin, flour-like tasting soba...gray colored. Not sure what's going on there, but when I asked to switch just the noodles for the kind my friend was having, the waiter told me straight up that the chef would charge me for it. I declined the switch, of course and went back to slurping. They also charge 10 bucks for Lady M crepe cake, which you can get from Lady M bakery for 7 bucks a slice instead. :( Also, if you are going with friends you have not seen in awhile, or someone new you've just met, it's not the best choice, as the surroundings feel more like a loud barracks/communal cafeteria. Festive, and full of congenial Japanese slogan shouting...it got more and more frustrating to talk after the first 15 minutes. :(

just when i thought i was gonna have the best ramen in the usa, found out from the locals that the chef had changed, explaining why the ramen here not any better than CA. tried: *Shiromaru Hakata Classic 'the original tonkotsu' soup noodles with slices of simmered berkshire pork loin, kikurage, red pickled ginger, menma, 1/2 hard boiled egg, sesame & scallions --so this ramen was not as good as modern, pork loin pieces used (pork belly so much better), broth ok *Akamaru Modern 'the original tonkotsu' soup noodles with ippudo's special sauce, miso paste and fragrant garlic oil, slices of simmered berkshire pork belly, cabbage, onions, kikurage & scallions --this is similar to Orenchi style, with the creamy style pork bone broth, with the right amount of garlic oil and tasty pork pieces. Ênoodles are the straight type (i prefer wavy). Êi want a more liquidy egg. Êoverall then, LA is better. *the one really good thing here was the hirata pork buns, and compared to Momofuku Ssam, I liked these better. Ênice sauce, right amount of heat. expensive ramen, too bad I'm came all the way here only to find CA is better!

Went to this place during the middle of the weekday so there was no long wait and service was very attentive. I never been to a restaurant dedicated solely to ramen but gave it a chance since noodles are such a comfort food to me. Strolled into this place with my mother who ordered the classical pork version while I ordered the spicy. The classical version had a rich broth with the most tender pork on this side of town. My spicy version was very balanced with pork bits floating on top of the noodles. All in all a very rich and comforting meal. It was the first time for me having Japanese style ramen and the broth had a salty rich taste which I'm usually not accustomed to since I'm so used to Chinese soup noodles. Although the broth was a little saltier than expected, it had a lot of depth and definitely had no msg since my mouth did not feel like a dry sock.

I had a bit of a cold when I went to Ippudo and the soup and noodles were the perfect answers to the prayers of my miserable self. Therefore, I recommend coming here when it's a bit colder out just because the dishes are so hearty and thick, the broth from their ramen will definitely heat you up. Ê We got the Hirata buns with pork, for starters. Ê They are like a higher quality traditional pork bun...with the bun actually folded over, much like a taco is, to it's filling. ÊThe taste of those juicy buns are out of control... they've got it down, that melty in your mouth taste-- the pork cooked and seasoned just right, and with just the right amount of fat on it. ÊI can come back here just for those hot buns! I got the Akumaru Modern extra spicy...and well, it did it....it knocked the cold right out of me. ÊThanks Ippudo, now I can breathe! ÊThe thick and spi-saayy broth and noodles, made well with high quality ingredients...all of that, in that gigantic ceramic bowl, certainly did the trick, it was just what the doctor ordered...The next time I have a cold, forget about getting some Nyquil, I'm going to Ippudo!

I love ramen. I have a favorite place I go to back in Los Angeles that is my barometer to every other ramen restaurant I come across. No more. Ippudo sets the standard. You walk in, and the decor is modern beautifully mixed with old world Japanese elements. Monday through Thursday they have 2 for 1 sapporo's, which is great. ANYWAY - so you walk in, and all the sudden the hostess says something in Japanese, and everyone greets you, including the kitchen, it's awesome. Service - the moment you take a sip out of your water, someone is there to refill it. I've never waited longer than 5 seconds for a server to come and get the bill from me. Food - ACAMURAMODERN and the PORKBUNS. You have to do it. Get fresh garlic and ask for the noodles to be cooked hard. From the moment that broth hits your mouth I swear you'll be in heaven. You might even shed a single tear when you finish your bowl of soup. The pork buns...I can't describe. Just do it. Trust me. This place is great. Like many other places in New York, you need to get there early. They do not take reservations. The restaurant opens up at 5pm and honestly at 5:30, it's usually packed by then with more than an hour wait, so really try to get there early. It's worth it. Ok seriously stop reading this review and go now wtf.

This is by far my favorite ramen place in NYC! I used to be a fan of Menchanko, but the last few times I went it wasn't as good and their prices went up a bit. Now that I've tried Ippudo, I will not be going back to Menchanko. I tried the Tori Ramen which was delicious! This is a salt ramen made from chicken broth. It was light and yummy, and surprisingly not overly salty. We ordered the spicy pork buns and the cream croquettes for appetizers. The spicy pork buns are so good! And I might even go as far to say I like them better than Momofuku Ssam's pork buns - but that might be because I prefer things spicy :) The cream croquettes are also great - highly recommend both of these things. The service is great - friendly and fast. The servers are attentive but not bothersome at all. The wait at Ippudo is long - I first tried to go on a Wednesday night but there was a 1 hr 45 min wait. So I came back on a a Friday night at 6:00 and we were able to get seated pretty quickly. If you want to get seated fast you have to get there early - otherwise be prepared to wait over an hour.

The 20 min wait was pretty on point, we were seated and service was fast and friendly. Ordered the steam porked buns which come in 2 portions and was really good. Reminded me of peking duck, they slap on some pork meat in btwn these buns with some scallions and sauce. Had a nice spicy kick to it too, which I liked despite the fact I don't eat spicy food. I don't remember which ramen I ordered, i know it was the salt-flavored soup based one (third one on the menu). I never tasted this type of ramen noodle before and I loved it!!! Stringy noodles with a nice bite into it, some meat and half of a hard boiled egg. My friend had the first ramen dish on the menu, and while also good and much more flavorful than mine, also seemed heavier. I liked mine a lot, was very light. I finished mine, she didn't finish hers. Ê All in all, a great and relatively cheap meal. Great, casual ambience. I would totally go back, and is definitely worth the wait (but try to go early so you don't have to wait so long!)

FOOD: I thought the food was really good. ÊI tried the Fried Chicken, Samurai Ribs and Ramen Soup. ÊThe chicken was tasty however it could have been a little more tender. ÊThe ribs were awesome! ÊAnd the Ramen was nice, with the exception of the stringy noodles - I prefer them chewy. AMBIANCE: The restaurant is wonderfully decorated. ÊThe seating is intimate (not crowded) and comfortable. ÊThe bar has ramen noodles under the glass and the walls are decorated with noodle bowls. ÊThe lighting is just right and the candles are placed well. Ê SERVICE: I have one complaint regarding the service. ÊMy friend and I were asked several times if we were finished with our appetizers when we were clearly not. ÊI thought being pressured into giving up our plates was an isolated incident until they started asking us if we were done with our soup (main entree's) 20 minutes into the meal. Ê Overall I would go back because the ambience feels good and the food was tasty.

This place is actually pretty good, as long as you're willing to wait an hour or more to get a table. Luckily, the bar up front has happy hour specials until 8pm so you can get yourself boozed up a little, which somehow makes the wait a little more bearable. As far as the restaurant itself, it's quite spacious, and we had a huge booth to ourselves. Lighting is dim and the decor is dark and trendy. As for the food, the pork hirata buns are to die for; and I really enjoyed the akamaru ramen. It's a little pricey, especially considering it's ramen, but I would go back.

The wait is typically pretty long...but if the wait is around 45 min, I'd stick around. Enjoy a beer at the bar or walk around St. Mark's for a few minutes. The ambience is real chill -- lots of interesting decor...but really, it's all about the soup/broth. You might think, "I'll just pop in a Shin ramen in the pot...with an egg and some dumplings..." but seriously, the soup is really what differentiates Ippudo from the rest. Go with a small group of friends...it's almost a sure thing you'll enjoy your experience :)

since this was my first foray into the high end Ramen world, I could not give it a 5 star. ÊNonetheless, the Ramen was fantastic, the pork buns were a delight for starters. Êthe Creamy Rich broth was perfectly described in the menu. ÊI added the braised pork belly meat too, but it would have been just as good without. Ê The meat was great, just too much belly fat for me.

Delicious broth but truly mediocre noodles, in my opinion. ÊI guess it depends on what style you like. ÊMy favorite thing about ramen is the awesome, slightly chewy, toothy noodles. ÊTo get that, they have to be dried at least a somewhat before cooking them. ÊThese are made right there, which is lovely, except that they get tossed right in the broth and within minutes they are too soft. Ê Comfy and chill, but not worth the wait, as far as I'm concerned.

Ok, so I went here with high expectations. ÊI have to say I love Ramen and have had tons of it, in the states and in Japan. ÊWell, this place majorly disappointed. ÊMaybe we(my Japanese bf and I) Êdidnt order right, we had the shoyu soup and it looked like everyone else ordered miso based. ÊBut while the noodles were delicious, I could not get past the nasty broth. ÊIt was strong, way way too strong with a bitter aftertaste. ÊYuck. ÊFor $17 for a bowl of soup, I couldnt even finish it. ÊDIsappointing. ÊNice atmosphere though.

I actually love the food here BUT, I only gave this place 3 stars because they downgraded their pork buns. When Ippudo first opened, they had the best pork buns ever!!! They beat out Momofuku's hands down. It was filled with 2 large pieces of juicy pork belly and was extremely tasty. When you order the pork buns today, they only have 1 piece of pork and all you taste is the bread. Very disappointing!

i read somewhere that excellent ramen feels like its disparate parts come together to make this satisfying, complementary whole, and the ramen here does just that. Êyes, the pork at minca is amazing and the cabbage adds a nice Êtouch, but while not one part of the ramen really stands out at ippudo, collectively its just heaven. Ê hate the wait, but on those cold dreary nights, where i need an extra boost, this is it.

The ramen was good, but I found the broth to be only average. The ambiance inside the restaurant was very nice, but I don't think the one hour wait was worth what we got. Also the price of the ramen is pretty expensive, ramen is supposed to be a common everyday food, not gourmet. We also tried the avacado and tuna tartare, which was beautifully displayed but did not have an original taste. If there wasn't a wait I would consider going back, but probably not because the price is so high for only average quality when there are other ramen joints around.

Though the wait (on weekends *and* weekdays) is really long, this ramen is absolutely worth it. ÊI usually order the Akamaru Modern, and it is savory, delicate, rich and delicious. ÊThe noodles are perfect--they are floury and al dente, and all the sides (the pickles, the beer and mixed drinks, etc.) are a perfect compliment to the soup, which I dream about, especially in cold weather.

Went in yesterday at around 7:30 PM on my way back from work since I've heard things about from friends. They've a bar in front for waiting people to sip drinks (21+ only for alcohol, of course), and there's always people waiting. Did I mention people waiting? ÊI meant large groups waiting. I was alone (my co-worker got drunk and went home in a cab) and i was promptly seated. ÊJust for the heck of it, I pretended to be a Japanese tourist (1/2 Japanese + fluent Japanese w/o accent = EZ acting). ÊWhy did I do this? ÊSimple, some place(s) in New York, NY charge TIP on the bill AFTER TAX. Not here, they treated me all the same, that's a plus there. Rated 4 stars b/c of the price. Ê$13~4 for a bowl of noodles w/o extras? They're good but there ARE other places that have $8 noodles (also Japanese). Plus the pork bun appetizer they had (which i ordered) were CHINESE pork buns. ÊThe same ones can be bought in Flushing for a "little" cheaper. ÊNot a minus but was kind of surprised. All in all, I spent about $30 w/ tip and left happy and at my own pace. ÊNo rush, no pressure. Hopefully they can expand and be able to lower prices, but that's a dream.

Best Ramen in New York City. ÊHorrible waits, but I think overall, it's worth it if you really love ramen. ÊAkamura Modern is the ramen Êto order. ÊHirata Pork buns are a must. ÊI also like their kakuni. ÊBottom Line: great food in a nice atmosphere.

Yes, $14 is expensive for a bowl of ramen and $8 for two pork buns may seem high. But, hey, the day before I bought my son dinner a TGI ÊFriday's near Times Square- $16.50 for Chicken Strips???- with a milk shake and an order of bread sticks (which are great when right out of the oven), tax and tip, the bill was over $30 (for just his meal!). So, I'm not going to complain about prices (except maybe at Friday's). How much would you pay for one of the best things you'll ever eat? I referring to the Pork Buns. The are fantastic and one of those dishes that you must try. The ramen (modern) was very good. But, I had the pork belly add-on and found it added a little too much fat. I'd certainly have it again, but without the pork belly.

Food is really decent. The wait is long but, if you're with friends and near the bar it shouldn't be too bad. The only drawback is that the refuse to let you take your food home. I'm sure ramen purists will defend this by saying that it doesn't travel well, you can't reheat it it, it's not the same, they don't take out ramen in Japan..blah blah blah. Sorry, if i'm paying $18 for noodle soup, I should be allowed to take it home if I want to. They either need to put a sign up that says we don't let you take your food home or explain that its going to be gross if you do and let the diner decide. If I ever go back, I'm bringing my own tupperware.

Ippudo was my first. ÊBefore experiencing the freshly-made, authentic ramen at Ippudo, I had only encountered ramen in styrofoam cups with spice packets. Ê I went to Ippudo on a Friday at Ê2 PM, and after a 1-hour wait, my companion and I were led to the dining area through a chorus of Japanese greetings from the cooks and the waiters. ÊMy companion ordered the Akamaru Modern, and I, the Shoyu Ramen. ÊWhen the orders arrived, there was no more conversation. ÊOnly the slurp of noodles interrupted by guzzling of the glistening, rich broth. ÊMy tongue was in umami heaven. Ê Maybe it was the 1-hr wait that created some anticipation, maybe it was a cold winter day. ÊOr maybe the ramen really was THAT good. Ê The noodles were also cooked to a perfect texture --- just a teeny bit past al dente. ÊThe toppings were cooked perfectly too, such that every component had its time to shine. Ippudo was my first, but after going to a few other ramen houses, it has still been the most delicious. ÊSome people ask if it's worth the wait and the price tag. ÊYes. ÊYes it is.

My friend told me that I must try the ramen here in NYC. I had already had an earlier dinner but I was leaving the next day so I forced myself to try it at night as a late night snack before they close. I came in 30 mins before closing and we were seated right away. My boyfriend and I weren't super hungry so we order any appetizers (which i deeply regret since I heard their pork buns were delish). My bf ordered the akamaru modern which was really good and I ordered the shoyu ramen. My ramen was too salty for my liking so I didn't enjoy my bowl too much. I wish I ordered the same thing my bf did. We ended our night with a slice of cheesecake which was pretty good. The prices here are pretty high for ramen but it's worth a try, especially since we were traveling we were willing to sample around.

came here on a super hot day. i was asking myself what i was doing here when it's 90 degree out? Ramen and hot weather just don't seem to go together! but since a friend highly recommend this place, i though i'd give it a try, though i was skeptical, and was hoping i wouldn't be disappointed since i've had ramen plenty of times in Japan. so i randomly picked one from the menu with pork belly on top. I LOVE IT! the soup was flavorful, and pork belly is my fav! can't wait to be in town and go there again!

Recommended here by my friends, yelp, food network, errwhere possible so I had to try it. The wait was an hour but I walked around with my friend to pass the time. The hostesses weren't at all welcoming and seemed standoffish as if I was bothering them when I asked to put my name on the wait list. Got the Akamuru Modern Ramen, Pork Buns, and Samurai Ribs. The ramen was aiight. Not bad, not that good, but def not worth the price. Daikokuya (in LA) still remains #1 on my ramen list. The pork buns were ok as well. I mean the pork itself was tender and different, which I liked. But the white bread it came with dimmed its exotic flavor and made it just ordinary. I liked it but I would live if I couldn't eat it again. The samurai ribs.. MMMMMMMmmmmmmmMMMMMMM. The outside was crisp. The inside was tender. It fell off the bone. A bit pricy since it only came with 2 ribs the size of my hand. But the sauces it came with were AMAZING. Packed with flavor. I'm salivating thinking about them. If Ippudo offered a to-go option (which I don't think it does) and if I had $$$ to spend, I would order these ribs bi-weekly. But sadly neither options exist so I'll sit here dreaming about them until I meet these ribs again...

omg this place warms my heart so much. Êthere are only 2 places in nyc that i will wait 2+ hrs to eat at and this place is quickly becoming the only one b/c year after year, it stays amazing.

I was supposed to go to Tokyo sometime in May and was very much looking forward to the Ippudo restaurant in Tokyo, but after the disaster that happened I decided to cancel the trip. What perfect timing and opportunity when I was given the chance to attend a meeting in NY. This place is bomb! Even better than Daikokuya (though it is a bit on the expensive side). We came here around 3 o'clock on a Wednesday and there was still a half hour wait, but it was all worth it. I ordered their original ramen, while my husband got their Akamaru Modern ramen combo with the spicy fried chicken rice. Both were delicious. I love how the miso paste added an extra POW to the ramen. The soup tasted like it has been boiling for hours, and their bamboo shoots completely absorbed all the flavors from the soup (not like the ones in Daikokyua, which didn't have much flavor at all). All in all, good flavor and good company. The only downside is that every addition (egg, seaweed, etc.) is an additional cost, but all worth it. I wish there was an Ippudo in LA so I can frequent this place more often.

fear not, fellow ramen fanatics. Êive found more delicious ramen to rate, since discovering santouka in San Jose and santa ramen in san mateo... however.. to reach such elusive and wondrous creations, one must traverse the great deserts of nevada, scale the rocky mountains, and cross the mississippi (or fly) to NY... IPPUDO! the soup alone is worth the dehydrating thirst suffered in the Mojave; the noodles satiate any hunger pangs from backpacking through the rockies; and the toppings, the wonderous toppings/ appetizers, tasty and delightful in themselves, each item a lil savory snack most enjoyed when killing time floating down the miss. river, but when combined with the noodles and broth....SEX FOR YOUR TASETBUDS! - (pardon my french) How i've longed for this kind of satisfaction that NO woman or car or amount of money can provide...unless that woman is the head chef at ippudo, or that car is delivering ippudo straight to me (in bed), or the money is or will be used to buy more ippudo... Prepare for the long-winded judging!! CUE unnecessarily long descriptions! Dominus Ramenus Points +++ homemade noodles. personally, i prefer thick noodles but these thin noodles really capture the essence of ramen, i felt so japanese the way i slurped up these doughy strands of goodness + the broth (i got the original) is phenomenal. Êhot, fatty, savory. Êyou know that feeling you get when you drink ice cold water after a long sweaty workout and the water goes down next to your veins/arteries and cools your innards, invigorating your mind and body? Êthe broth does the exact same, except instead of reviving your spirits, it relaxes and soothes....(almost like a giant glass of hot coco by a fire) + the toppings: chashu, bamboo shoots, mushroom, 1/2 boiled egg. ÊALL were delicious, the chashu is nice and meaty but also very tender and juicy. Êthe bamboo is standard and adds a nice texture along with the mushrooms; both of which were plentiful and nicely separated the noodles adding excitement to each bite. ÊThe egg is fantastically cooked, not too hard, with the yolk nice and soft...sigh i miss it already + the SPOOON!!! the spoon is gigantic with the surface area of a small concave island! it allows for fast cooling of the broth AND also a healthy serving of noodles that lie perfectly coiled up like a snake about to strike. + appetizers: pork bun + chicken wings + ribs...try any of the three and you will be pleasantly surprised + service was exceptionally speedy for the tremendous crowd and staff was nice and genuinely friendly + pretty pretty decor + bench seats were unique and had a back opening where you can place your coats/other valuables i had to struggle to find stuff i didnt like about this place, but since i review ramen based on entire experience, here are the cons - the chair i had was weird, with only 1 large armrest (special design)...thus preventing me from scooting closer to the table and therefore closer to my ramen - parking is difficult, but hey, its NY, get a cab - LONG LINES, however there is a bar in the front where you can order drinks/appetizers OVERALL if you love ramen, why go anywhere else? ÊI came to NY for thanksgiving, but my personal agenda may have involved eating ippudo...twice.

The food was exceptional. We ordered the pork buns, a squid appetizer, the roasted duck over eggplant and the modern ramen. ÊEverything was a great combination of flavor and texture. The soup base for the ramen was very rich and aromatic. I would have liked more toppings in the noodles (you can add extra for an additional charge but we didn't think it would be necessary). A bit noisy (staff would randomly shout out cheers behind your back so make sure you don't have any heart conditions) and most tables are shared (which is actually an authentic and realistic depiction of Japanese ramen shops) so probably not the best place to have serious dinner conversations. The wait was okay--it was rainy and we got there around 7 on Friday--we were told it would be an hour to an hour and 20 minutes but we only sat at the bar for about half an hour before getting seated.

I salivate when I think of this place. I can't help it, the thought the best bowl of steaming hot ramen in NYC makes my senses tingle and the atmosphere/service makes me feel I'm back in Tokyo. The wait here can get out of hand; I usually come at 11am on Saturdays. If you get here after noon, the wait exponentially grows (up to 2.5 hrs!). ÊIf that happens, just hang out at the bar (It's never too early for a drink). It has an interesting decor of dried ramen noodles and bowls. I order Kirin and hirata pork buns or shishito (fried peppers) at the bar, its tasty and curves your appetite. I've ordered the Sho-chu with green tea once and doubt that I'll ever order it again, it comes in a beer glass and is pretty stiff for 11 am on a hungover saturday. I love entering/leaving the dining area, all the employees YELL profanities at you in Japanese. Ok, maybe they're not profanities but since I don't understand Japanese, I'll continue to believe that is true. The service is quite attentive even for a place that is always so busy. I usually sit at the giant communal U shaped table because I like to watch people eat (I'm creepy). ÊI always stick to my Akamaru Modern: al-dente ramen noodles, spicy miso broth with 2 slices of pork, half an egg and some veggies with a side of bamboo shoots and spicy paste. The paste is not too spicy but it numbs your mouth, I like that feeling. If I have extra broth left, you can bet your toosh that I order Kae-dama, an extra serving of noodles. You can also bet that I salivated all over my keyboard as I typed the last few sentences. I agree the food here is expensive but half of what you're paying for is the atmosphere. If this makes you angry then I know a great place in Chinatown where you can buy cheap pork buns and instant ramen for less than an order of bamboo shoots at Ippudo.

big E is obsessed with ramen. he wants it every day; meanwhile i get cravings maybe once a month. this has led to more than one disagreement regarding our lunch/dinner options. lucky for big E, ippudo has changed the frequency of my cravings for ever more. the + marks - - the modern ramen is THE best ramen i've had in my life. the broth is hearty & salty, the meat was tender, the noodles thin & firm. unbelievably good. i slurped up the entire bowl, and woke up with puffy eyes and a puffy face. well worth it. - the hirata buns (pork) were delicious. there were 3 of us, and we got 2 orders. one lonely bun was left. nobody was willing to let a single person eat the whole thing him/her-self, so we each took turns taking bites until it was gone. all gone. - we were drunk. we may have been loud & annoying. but it didn't matter. the place was packed, bumpin', and everyone was happy. no one cared about anything aside from how good the food was. - servers were extremely friendly & polite. - place was big & chairs were comfortable. no, you can't do anything about smelling like steamy salty broth when you leave, but elbow room, plush chairs, AND great food? no argument here. the - marks & notable concerns - - how will i ever eat ramen anywhere else again? - why oh why must the wait be so long? - how long will my craving to go this very moment last? - will i ever be able to try another ramen at ippudo considering how much i loved the modern?

Much better than Ajisen. ÊA little better than Shin Sen Gumi. ÊNot as fatty as Totto Ramen. ÊThe noodles are much fresher and the soup/broth is not as salty as Shin Sen Gumi. ÊHaven't tried Daikokuyo or Santouka. ÊEither way, this place gets 5 stars from me.

I came here with my sister a few weekends ago, and after killing 1.5 hours and downing lychee martinis at Êthe bar (yes! highly recommend!) we were ushered into the dining room where the whole kitchen erupted in cheers and yelling (or was it booing? It was all in Japanese so they could've been calling us names for all we know) for us. ÊThere's not much more to say that hasn't been said already- order the pork buns, and get some sort of ramen and make sure to get an egg on top! It was amazing, delicious, fab-u. We talked about it for days afterwards. One thing that surprised me was that they offer an extra portion of ramen noodle in case you eat yours. Now I know why America is so fat....you''ve gotta be kidding me- that must be like 3 lbs of noodles in your giant bowl. My sister and I wished we had more broth- not noodles! Anyway- do it once to say you did it, you won't be disappointed, but prepare to wait and wait and wait.

It was a very stormy Friday afternoon! We were trying to get some food in the area and decided to come here. And it sure was worth it! After being soaked in the rain, there's nothing better than some hot ramen to warm you up. This was my first time having legit ramen (I've only eaten the cheap, packaged Maruchan brand before) and this place is known as the spot for having good ramen. Upon entry, we were greeted by very friendly staff and felt very welcomed. The decor was quite nice too, and the seating was comfortable. I ordered the Tori ramen set. I highly recommend getting the set because it's only an extra $3 and it comes with a salad and a side dish. I chose the spicy fried chicken over rice as my side and I must say that it was very good and I craved more. The Êramen came out next and despite struggling with chopsticks at first; I got the hang of it and enjoyed my ramen. The taste was definitely there and it was filling. It was a very good first experience and I would like to return in the future; Êespecially during the winter when the hot ramen would be perfect to eat on a cold, winter day!

Let me begin by saying this, I'm not a hardcore ramen fan. I have heard, even read great things people said about Ippudu. So, I decided that it's definitely worth a try. My first visit brought mixed feelings. They seemed very busy, even for a Saturday noon. The hostess told me that I have to wait 25 minutes for 2 people, my girl and I. Alright, name's Steve, I uttered. I waited for almost 40 minutes before I was seated. Seating arrangement at Ippudu could be confusing at times. I swore that she sat people came after me first. I confronted her about it and she apologetically said that "they are having trouble with tricky customers." I ignored her excuses and sat down with my girlfriend. Menu was concise, especially their sake menu. I must say I was impressed with details paid to the making of their menu. We're seated along with 8 other couples around a big long table. There're probably about a few of those in the centre of the dining hall and large booths at end where they can seat 8-10 people each. We had buns with grilled chicken, two bowls of signature ramen with toppings and one black cod entre to share. These are not watered down dishes made for American. Tasty pork belly, maybe salty to most was simply heavenly. Grilled chicken was actually grilled (unlike most places, pan fried then broiled) and sizzling to the bite. Buns were not over sauced, which was a good thing so that we still can enjoy various layers of different tastes. Bowls of ramen were simply awesome. The black cod wasn't much of an attraction in comparison. Service was ample. There's a Japanese girl (head waitress, perhaps?) going around table asking people, "worth the wait, right?" I paused for a few seconds and was thinking to myself, yep. Not to an extent I wanted to say out loud, totally! I kept that to myself. We left after spending 35 minutes savouring our meals. We left contended. After all, what more could we ask for?

It's hard to find good quality food now a days, restaurants seem to be skimping on something. Ippudo's deco is definitely eye catching and the ambiance is laid back. An hour wait for ramen is ridiculous when you have to wait outside since there is no room inside, especially when it's pouring outside with a blizzard coming to blow you away. I got the most popular ramen bowl with the side of rice/chicken. The rice and chicken were way better than the ramen and I wish that was the main attraction. The ramen was missing the hard boiled egg they advertised it with and the traditional braised pork in the soup. The options were pretty limited, they didn't even have the broth with the marrow!!!?! However, my friend got the side of rice with pork belly and that was pretty awesome. The pork belly was tender, flavorful, and juicy. Ippudo is really not a traditional ramen place if that's what you're looking for!

This is as good as it gets when it comes to ramen, hands down. ÊNot only is the food good but the ambiance/crowd at Ippudo is hip and trendy. ÊThe Akamaru Modern is the way to go, the rich pork broth with the special sauce is absolutely delicious. ÊYeah they could serve a larger portion of noodles in their bowls but it's about quality not quantity. ÊEach bite is just pure heaven for your mouth. ÊFinish off your meal with the matcha creme brulee dessert, it's fantastic. ÊThis place is way better than Ramen Setagaya or even Santoka at the Mitsuwa food court, and well worth the usually long lines to get a table. ÊGo take a walk around the neighborhood, you'll build up your appetite by the time you are seated. ÊI have to give kudos to the waitstaff for offering to replace my brother's bowl of ramen with a fresh hot bowl since he didn't have time to eat it until he was done feeding his baby daughter. ÊThey really want you to experience their ramen as it should be.

I love this place and so does everyone else in NYC it seems. Expect to wait at least an hour for a table regardless of what time of day you get there. The front of the restaurant is small and unassuming but once they take you into the back, you see that it's a lot bigger than you first imagined. There are two separate rooms with very modern tables and chairs and cool Japanese inspired art on the walls. The servers are very attentive and efficient. Everything on the menu sounds delicious and it didn't disappoint! I ordered the Karaka Miso Ramen and the soup was some of the most flavorful I've ever tasted! I would have been happy with just a bowl of the soup! The noodles were cooked perfectly (firm but not crunchy) and the pork belly was heavenly! It wasn't too fatty but had just enough to enhance the meat. We also ordered chicken wings (a must!) and the pickled vegetables (also very tasty). The next time I'm in NYC, you'll find me waiting outside Ippudo for another bowl of their addictive ramen!

1 of 1682 reviews so i can't do that much damage or good. Êlol! ÊMy knowledge on ramen is nil so for a first, i hope i didn't go to the best place in town. ÊI loved everything about this place. ÊCame during a late Saturday afternoon around 2:30. ÊI went by myself and waited maybe 10 minutes, if even that, to get sat right at the open kitchen bar top. ÊI was all about sitting up front and getting to see everything that was going on. Êthe first thing that struck me is how vocal all the employees were. ÊCooks, runners, servers alike yelling across the restaurant in Japanese. Êi'm sure there are people that aren't into that aspect of the ambiance but have worked in restaurants for a lil while i loved it. ÊI started out with a Kirin Ichiban ($6) and ordered the Hirata Pork Buns. ÊThey were filled with, i believe it was, pork belly, greens, and they're spicy sauce. Êthe buns were light, airy, fluffy and the perfect vehicle to deliver tender pork slathered in a sweet and savory sauce and topped with the spicy sauce. ÊI could have eaten 15. ÊAs for the ramen I ordered the Akamaru Modern. ÊI also added Nitamago (soft boiled egg) and Kakuni (braised pork belly). ÊI have to say I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. ÊI couldn't to dig in as soon as I saw the pork. ÊIt was absolutely tender and falling apart into the broth and noodles. ÊThe noodles had great texture, they were nice and chewy and far from soft and mushy. ÊBroth had lots of depth in flavor and as soon as I started I couldn't stop. ÊThe miso flavor came through really well which I am a huge fan of. ÊI definitely went for the Kae-dama and got a second serving of noodles to finish off my broth. ÊAfter the beer, Hirata Buns and Akamaru Modern I think the total cam out to 35-37 bucks. ÊProbably not what you want to spend on lunch EVERYDAY but I wanted to do it the right way. ÊI would definitely go back, i have a feeling i'll be back soon to try and get more acquainted with ramen. Êloved it

Seriously everyone, I don't get it. ÊI went to this restaurant for lunch after reading all the glowing reviews on Yelp. ÊSince it was early on a Wed for lunch, there was no wait, one point. ÊI ordered ramen with pork and Ippudo special sauce. ÊWhen the noodle came, the broth was covered in grease and little bits of black specks - minus 2 points. ÊUpon tasting it, I concluded it was the fat rendered when you fry bacon. ÊNormally bacon is always a good thing, but I am not sure about bacon fat in noodle broth.. ÊNoodles here are thin, so not as chewy as the ramen I had at other establishments, minus 0.5 points. ÊI like Japanese ramen for its tasty simplicity, but the bacon fat just killed it. ÊThe Ippudo special sauce was good though and the wait staff friendly - one point each. ÊBut $14 for a bowl of noodle in the east village?? minus 5 points! ÊI probably won't be coming back. ÊThere are just too many good noodle places around here. Update: since lunch, I have had the worst heart burn, must be the bacon grease. ÊHalf a bottle of Tums didn't do a thing.

I have heard great reviews about Ippudo but finally experiences it for myself. I went around 12:05 and just beat the lunch crowd. About 15 people literally walked in right behind me. ÊI was alone so just jumped onto one of the shared tables.(maybe five min wait) ÊIt is a great concept. I was shocked by the warm welcomes of shouts by chefs and waiters. It was alarming but fun. The shouts continued throughout my meal as guests came and went. ÊThe decor is very modern and comfortable. ÊThe service was very prompt - the waitress came over as I sat down. I already knew what I wanted (from recommendations and yelp reviews) and my pork buns came out very quickly. I was also given water immediately and it was continuously filled throughout my meal without me having to ask. The pork buns (served with two) were awesome! ÊThe bun was soft and fresh and the pork was nicely sliced with a great tangy sauce. For my main course I tried the akamaru modern - which is supposed to be spicy. I thought the spice was weak. I probably could have asked for more, but I was so delighted by the taste of the ramen that I just kept eating. ÊAfter my meal i was given hot tea. Great restaurant. Everything around me looked so delicious. I will be back. ÊOf course I walked out to screams again from the staff!

Manhattan is the city of "the best." ÊIt's been said time and time again, Ippudo has the best Ramen in the city- but factoring in minimum hour wait time and the loud "Happy Birthday, let's get wasted" crowd i'm not sure i'll return. ÊWe both ordered the Akamaru Modern and shared the special appetizer of crispy rice to start. ÊThe appetizer was tiny!! ÊMaybe 1/4 of what would be expected with a $12 dollar price tag. ÊThere might have been bits of pork belly in the rice to warrant the money, but i can't even remember so it goes to show how forgettable it was. ÊThe ramen broth was the highlight. ÊWB craved the savory liquid hours after our dinner had finished. ÊI wanted more protein and less noodle, but that was asking too much. ÊRamen Sategura is maybe a 7.5 compared to ippudo's 10, but not having to wait and get a headache from the intermittent yelling makes them even. ÊThere is no good time to go, but i suggest you go there once so that you can say you've had the best.

Ok I am reallly tempted to join the crowd and give this place a 4, but I am leaning more towards a 3.5, but my gut, or rather hand, stopped clicking after the 3rd star just now. THERE'S ALWAYS ALWAYS A WAIT, FYI. We came on a Sat at 1pm and it was 2 of us and there was over an hour wait. They also close after 3 on Saturdays until dinner time (6pm?) We came back at Sunday at noon and it was 30 minutes (doable) for us 2. BIGGER PARTIES BEWARE: You will wait at least 1.5 hours at most times. So put your name down and go walk around the Holiday Market in Union Square. What I liked most about this place was the Atmosphere. It's FUN! They greet you by yelling something in Japanese and they do that again and again and again and again and...everytime someone new walks in to be seated. You also share tables with strangers which I thought was kind of fun. Ok, ok, for the food....it was GOOD. I think I am going to leave it at that, but truth be told I was expecting more. It's $13 for a bowl of Ramen and $6 for a beer, so not too cheap of a lunch. The service was Very attentive, I think my water got refilled 5 times in an hour time span. I'd say give it a try once. You know are curious to see what all the hype is about anyway.

here's the thing: the ramen is VERY delicious, i have to concede that it does give my favorite ramen place shinsengumi in LA a run for the money. the soup isnt overly salty or overdosed on MSG. the pork was thick and they left the fat on it, giving it more flavor. the noodles aren't soggy, in fact they are just a little bit firm, the way i like it. its very posh for a ramen shop, which is sord odd to me, but nice. i knocked off one star for the exorbitant wait time - 1 hr and 30 min for my friends and me. the hostesses were courteous enough, but i didnt appreciate being told that the wait time was 35 min instead of the real 90 min. if they told me the wait was 1 hr, i would have left to come back another time instead of waiting there. aside from that, this place is pretty awesome.

The quality of noodles and soup are so good, I dare utter the word "Ichiran" as a comparison. Sadly I never went to the Ippudo in Tokyo so Ichiran is my best guide. Ippudo NYC is a large trendy restaurant so it doesn't have the cozy hole in the wall ramen feel you get in Tokyo. Ichiran has each person sitting in their own booth as if taking an exam so that you can focus solely on your bowl of noodles. Ambience aside, the shiromaru hakata classic at Ippudo NYC was amazing. They must have stepped up the size of their servings since some of these reviews because I couldn't even finish all my noodles and I tried really hard because it was so tasty. Will definitely go again. $13 is reasonable for the quality. The soup base is thicker/richer and more authentic than at Rockmeisha but the location is much farther from my apt. And Rockmeisha has that small hole in the wall feel I love about Japanese izakayas and ramenyas. Beyond hakata ramen, I still think Menchanko-tei has the best homemade noodles in NYC (and the best deal at $9/bowl).

So based on the reviewsI was reading prior to trying this place out, I was expecting 5 (stars) but to my disappointment, it wasn't as good as it was hyped out to be. So, where to begin. I came here around 3:20 after visiting Japantown and the hostess said that they couldn't serve anyone anymore since lunch ended soon which was understandable. We wanted to make reservations for 5 since that was when they opened for dinner but they told us they don't take reservations until 5:30. I was annoyed at first but I guess I can understand where they are coming from. If everyone made reservations when dinner started then those who didn't wouldn't be able to get a table until hours later. ÊMy boyfriend and I decided to stay for a little bit to look over the menu. After about 20 minutes later, one of the other hostess asked if we've been seated and told her we had made reservations for later. After jokingly asking if they have any availability, to our surprise, a table of 3 never showed up so we were quickly seated. If you want your own table, you have to sit in a both that fits around 8 people but since we were only two, we were placed with some other people at a long table which we didn't mind. The setting and decor are nice and the staff if noisy. You'll hear every so often them shouting orders to each other. The bathrooms are located down in the basement. There are two stalls for women and one for men. Before passing by the men's room, there is a narrow window where you can see them make the ramen which is pretty cool. ÊWe ordered the Karaka Ramen and Shiromaru Hakata Classic. It was good flavoring but the Karaka Ramen was overly salty. I think I added twice the amount of water in there just to dilute it. The ramen was average and a bit on the hard side. The noodles are overpriced and my heart is still set on Orochon Ramen. Another odd thing about this place is that there aren't any takeout containers so I tried to stuff down as much as I could as we were rushed out since we were there past 4pm.

i'm giving 5 stars because the ramen was really good (albeit expensive!), but for me, the pork belly was incredible!! Êi've never had anything like it before and just thinking about it now is making my mouth water (seriously!!) :0 Êbecause the ramen is expensive and the interior feels so fancy, i probably won't be a regular, but it was a very memorable experience (well, it also happened to be my birthday..)

Loved this place! Definitely worth the wait. The pork buns are as good as everyone says, they are DELICIOUS. I got the akamaru modern ramen, which was also amazing.

The food is great here, especially the "modern" ramen which is #2 on the menu. ÊBe sure to take advantage of adding an additional order of noodles to your existing broth for like $2 more. ÊThe service is also top notch here. ÊMy small glass of water was always filled and the staff collectively made sure it was a great dining experience. ÊMy only complaint is the wait to get a table.

Disclaimer: Big Ramen fan - would rate most ramen places as great - but Ippudo is really really exceptional. The Pork Ramen original is sooo good - my mouth is watering just thinking about it. The staff is all Japanese and quiet attentive. If you finish your noodle and still have plenty of broth remaining - no worries - you can ask for more noodles (for a little bit more) - which I always do! Go there now and grab a bowl of the hot steamy stuff.

I don't write many reviews because I usually don't write a good review so I only do so when it's really bad. Here's a bad review. Ippudo was not good. In fact, it's nothing like the companies other restaurants in Japan which I've been to and had great food. From the start, the wait was two hours and half the restaurant was empty? I would of walked off but we had friends to meet and catch up so we decided to wait, when we got a table and ordered, "I ordered the Classic Tonkotsu Ramen" I love Tonkotsu, but what I got wasn't the Tonkotsu I get in Japan or even a authentic Japanese restaurants in the US, it tasted pretty bad. It had a very thick miso base and was not a typical Tonkotsu ramen. It didn't have a whitish looking soup base and wasn't light tasting with it's distinctive subtle taste, it was very overbearing with salt so you couldn't taste the main ingredients which the Japanese seldom ever do in their cooking. There's Êno doubt Êthat this place was real trendy and fun but don't go there to eat ramen if you want good ramen, also when you go to eat ramen don't wait two hours for it. ÊIn Japan and other asian countries it's eaten for a quick lunch or as hang-over food!

this place is crowded at all hours! came for dinner and it was a mad house. heard some people had to wait a minimum of two hours! so be prepared to wait a while. luckily my friend knew one of the waiters so we waited a whole one minute. haha awesome hook up! the staff is real nice, always refilling water and asking if ok. very attractive too btw. its a nice atmosphere, pretty dark and cool. so the food, they have a whole page on ramen which is about 16 bucks. pretty good size bowl and I'm guessing they make their own noodles and broth? it was really good. also have specialties. tried the ribs which were really good. the chef made the sauce wrong so we had to wait a little longer and you know what the waiter did? gave us free edamame! woohoo. didn't even have to wait that long either so very good service. the ribs came off the bone and very good. i think that was about 12 bucks. to me, it was a little on the pricey side for ramen, but the service was excellent and the food was great. $20 a person. i don't know how many times id come here to wait two hours but it was a great dinner.

Decided to go here on almost an impulse after a week long craving for tasty noodles. Came here with a date and we both ordered the Modern. The wait was 1.5 hours and I'd anticipated it would be about that long of a wait so I can't say anything that bad about it. I'd recommend getting there at least 2 hours in advance of the time you plan to sit. However, a party that showed up at around 7 had to wait 3 hours (!!). During the wait you can walk around the area because there are a lot of interesting shops to stop at. Although, at the same time there are also a lot of restaurants and that just made me even hungrier....We had bubble tea nearby at a restaurant that escapes my memory. They serve the food very quickly and it just as good as advertised. Very authentic. I highly recommend the pork buns. Next time I come here, I might just order ONLY pork buns because those were just that good. The ramen was pricey for a typically cheap dish, but I think it was worth it given that the atmosphere was great also. I'd recommend getting the upgrade/add-ons because they don't give you much meat in the ramen. They also have interesting chairs that only have one arm rest so you can push two chairs together and make it a bigger chair. I may have to invest in that for my own decorative purposes. For dinner we shared the Matcha Brulee which is a green tea flavored creme brulee topped with gelato. Delicious as well. 5 star for food! -1 for wait.

wow so much hype leading up to our visit to ippudo. my husband and I visit nyc a few times a year and we've never eaten at a ramen spot so on the reviews and recommendations of friends, we finally decided to try ippudo. the wait wasn't too long for us - about 15 min but we did go on a weekday at 2pm. it was myself, my husband, my mother-in-law, and our 10-month old baby girl. they don't have high chairs but they accommodated us in one of their few booths instead of their communal tables, considering that we had a baby with us. as soon as you walk in, you are greeted in japanese, which was nice but this would be the background noise for the remainder of our lunch. Ênow the food... we shared the pork buns. the bun was delicious and fluffy but where was the pork?? $8 for 2 pieces of bun and 2 slivers of pork. Êmy husband and I ordered the Akamaru Modern Chasu (extra pork belly) - I asked the server how many pieces the Chasu comes with and she said 5 so I wonder how many the regular akamaru comes with. ÊI honestly don't know what the big deal is with this ramen. I've had my share of ramen and I feel like the packaged ones I make at home have more flavor and I can customize it the way I want without paying an arm and leg. Êthe noodles were too chewy - ÊI like my ramen noodles chewy but these were too much. the flavor of the soup was good though (not great). the seasoned egg I added for $2 was horrible. the pork belly was good and tender. ÊI was hoping for a little more kick in spice but it fell flat. Êwe paid about $90 w/ tip for 3 people - one appetizer split and 3 bowls of ramen (2 were lunch specials and 2 had extra egg). overall, this place is okay but I have had much better for half the price. ÊI'm not hating on this place b/c the service was excellent and the flavor of the food is good. but the price is what killed it for me. if you want to sell noodles and soup for $16 a bowl, you better want me to lick the bowl dry! that you did not do ippudo.

Just not sure I understand the hype and mass hysteria. ÊWe have been trying to figure out a good night to come to avoid waits, and after months of failing to find such a time, we sucked it up and stood in line. ÊWe sat at the bar and the appetizers were being prepared quite intricately and looked flavorful, but aside from sampling the pork buns (which were quite delish) we had come for the ramen. ÊIt was savory and good for the first few bites but was definitely salty. ÊThe saltiness was more apparent after we left. ÊOur stomachs were just not right for the rest of the night- not in a food poisoning kind of way, but in an unsettling way, as though the sodium was extracting excess fluid from everywhere else in our bodies. ÊI guess this is an acquired taste in Japan, but it is one I will pass on in the future. ÊI prefer a bowl of noodles from Momofuku.

It's not worth the 45 min wait and $14 price tag. It's not bad, just not good enough. Chicken wings had great sause to it but had distinctive taset/smell often from being frozen for too long. And $7 for 3 wings, 3 pieces actually, not 3 wings was a bit expensive. For noodle, the soup base was pretty good, very thick and flavorful I am sure some ppl like it very much, it was just ok for me. My biggest complain is the noodle, I have had ramen in many places including Japan and other Asian localations, what they have at Ippudo was not top notch stuff. It lacks the cheweness should come with ramen. The place around the corner on St Mark's suits my taste better.

Coming from the Bay area where we do have some good ramen places, I unfortunately wasn't so impressed with the ramen here. The noodle (thinner and finer than most ramen places) was fresh but I prefer the more traditional size and texture. The broth was good but it didnt knock my socks off. I think Dojo/Santa/Maru in the Bay area probably compare better on taste and depth of flavor. That said, I wasn't dying of thirst afterwards (no MSG?) We ordered appetizer of Samurai Rib, Bakuretsu Tofu and Hirata Bun. Of the three, I liked the Samurai Rib the most. Bakuretsu Tofu is cute. Like Korean jigae but a little out of place as it competes with the ramen if you plan to have ramen. The Hirata bun wasn't too special. Momofuku's pork buns are probably better (from what I recall). It gets stars for the vibe, decor, and service. Net net ... I dont think I would wait in line to pay $14 for ramen again.

I gotta say this is probably the best ramen I've ever had. ÊIs it worth the extra dollars charged here? ÊThat's probably for you and your budget to decide. ÊDefinitely come here during lunch since you can get a lunch set for an extra $3. ÊA lunch set will get you salad with some yummy wasabi soy-like dressing and a giant bowl of rice topped with your choice of spicy fried chicken (not spicy at all), spicy cod roe (yummy), or roast pork. ÊThe akamaru modern is probably the most popular dish here with original tonkotsu soup noodle and some very fatty and delicious Berkshire pork slices. ÊI had the karaka men which is very similar to the akamaru modern but with a spicy broth. ÊThe broths are very rich. ÊYou can't ever go wrong with edamame as an appetizer. ÊThe yuzu salt was a nice twist on a dish. ÊCome a bit after the usual lunch crowd and don't be discouraged by the wait.

I've been looking for an authentic Japanese ramen place FOREVER. ÊI finally found it. ÊIppudo is awesome on so many levels. ÊThe food alone would get this place 5 stars. ÊI got the Shiromaru Hakata Classic with both of the suggested toppings. ÊThe Kakuni (Braised pork belly) IS A MUST. ÊThe broth was delicious and the noodles tasted great. ÊI actually prefer egg noodles like the kind you find in Chinese noodle soups, but regardless, I thought these noodles were superb. ÊBesides the food, the restaurant itself was amazing. ÊThe staff were animated, as soon as you walk in EVERYONE greats you with a loud "AAAYYYEEEE!!!". ÊFrom the tables and chairs, to the bowls and chopsticks and big ladle for your soup, to the whole decor of the place, everything was perfect. ÊThe only bad part about this place is the wait. ÊMy girlfriend and I fortunately didn't experience it (THIS TIME), but it was obvious that some people had to wait at least an hour or two to get a table. ÊWe fortunately got there 30 minutes before they opened for dinner at 5:00PM, but even by then, there was a line of about 20 people. ÊSo make sure you get there early, because even though we were one of the first people there, we had to wait about 10 minutes. ÊBut believe me IT'S WORTH THE WAIT.

Still tasty, but in recent months, the ramen has become insanely oily (beyond the expected amount for tonkotsu ramen, which is already a lot!). People I've taken here lately have not been impressed. Also, the wait is WAY too long now, they raised their prices (by just a dollar but still), and some of the hostesses are da*n rude.

This ain't no hole in the wall ramen spot. This is upscale! I went solo but once I walked in the place was PACKED! Great atmosphere and very friendly employees. ÊI was really impressed with how great the place looked and how well the servers were treating everyone, including myself. I was told 15 minute wait so I walked outside because of the crowd inside and not even 2 minutes later someone came out and called my name, guess I got lucky. I had just before that got donuts from the Doughnut Plant and had my bag, the girl said that they dont allow outside food but courteously told me I can bring it in just dont show it off. All the service was very quick and I never had an empty cup. This place is just on par with daikakuya in L.A. but better because for the ambiance and courteous/speedy service. As far as straight ramen is concern it's still no match for Santouka. ÊIt's a bit pricey, because ramen shouldn't ever be more than $10 but hey, its New York right?

ramen was cooked perfectly. Êthe soup was very good as well. Ê the price for the bowl of noodles was like 13 dollars. Ê2 pork buns were 8 dollars.

its good, yes. solid, really. perfect consistency and flavor in the broth. the noodles are firm, not over or undercooked. cool, spacious restaurant w/japanese servers frantically running around, bringing hot, tasty bowls of ramen (and other plates of Japanese bits and bobs) to hungry patrons. but, i cant get over paying $13 for ramen. its almost ludicrous. and the wait - thats def ludicrous. unless its a special occasion like friends in town or something, id rather go to menchanko-tei or menkui-kei for a quick, tasty bowl of ramen w/out all the fuss.

To think I would pay this much ramen, but its spectacularly good. ÊIppudo is an upscale take on the humble, plebeian dining experience that is ramen. ÊRamen, usually a steaming bowl of noodles in a savory broth with a myriad of additions, is toothsome, filling, and meant to be slurped down with gusto. Ippudo's version is one of best I've ever had, in NYC or Japan, great in every aspect. ÊAlso about twice the price of most other places. ÊThat said, service is a notch above and the interior is trendy and funky, with an open kitchen and diverse seating arrangements. ÊSmaller groups may share seating in communal tables. ÊOther than ramen, most of their takes on comfort foods are excellent, some standouts being the pork buns, pork belly, chicken wings, and ribs. ÊDecent selection of sakes, shochu, and other alcohols; they have my fave shochu with fresh grapefruit juice. ÊNo reservations so come early or be prepared for a wait. ÊI won't come here all the time if I'm craving ramen, but its a special treat.

Literally having just arrived in New York a few hours before, we were tired and hungry for anything. ÊAllen's sister suggested that we try Ippudo, since Allen had been craving authentic ramen for weeks. ÊPlus it Êwas a rainy day in New York, so we wanted something that would warm our bellies and start our trip off right. ÊStrolled into Ippudo early on a Thursday afternoon and it was packed. ÊThe 4 of us were seated at a gigantic booth that gave us plenty of space to lie down if we got to full. ÊThe prices were typical of that of New York, but we realized what a great deal buying a lunch set was. ÊThe lunch set came with our choice of ramen, with rice with choice of topping, and a salad. ÊWe ordered the Karaka Men because we love our spicy food. ÊWe opted for the grilled eel which was pretty standard for a Japanese restaurant, but still good. ÊOur favorite part was the broth of the ramen. It packed just enough spice and was quite savory. ÊI give it only three stars because besides the broth I thought the ramen was only okay and service was lacking (I'm not use to New Yorkers)

Best ramen I had in my life. ÊMy friend took me there after building such a hype. ÊNormally these things never live up to the hype. ÊWe got there for lunch service. Ê45mins wait in NY, hmm whatever if this is the best ramen then I will wait, plus my friend is my best friend I trust her. ÊLovely decor of the place with dried ramen in the bar glass area... very cool. ÊThe time came to eat there. ÊI had the Akamaru Modern with the fried chicken and rice. ÊFirst came the salad, I dont know if I was really hungry or not but the dressing was sour and spicy at the same time...not your typical Japanese salad that you would just eat for the sake of eating. ÊThe fried chicken and rice came out. Crispy and juicy was the chicken and each grain of rice was delicious. ÊThen came the ramen. ÊNot soggy and tough. ÊBut each bite of the ramen felt like you could feel the breaking of the delicate protein binding holding the noodle together. ÊThe pork melted in your mouth and the soup was perfectly seasoned.... the world stopped for a moment.... It was that good. ÊGo try it. ÊWarning you will ruin every other ramen experience outside Japan. ÊSo good.

I said i'd be back right? went here last night with justina, hadley and ed and introduced H&E to the wonderful world of ramen. i think ippudo is a good starter. the wait was 1hr 20 mins, but it went by pretty fast. after a cocktail at the bar, we got a good table and started with the cucumber app (sliced cucumber - maybe slightly pickled) sitting in sesame oil, ground sesame seeds, cracked chili flakes, man this was really really good. surprisingly good even. i could eat a ton of this. we also got edamame, which ya know, is edamame. i got the akamaru modern which smelled delicious and really good. what it didn't include, which i wish it did, (and btw, minca includes this) is an egg, a big leaf of seaweed, those black mushrooms, and less fatty pork. nevertheless, the noodles were great and i ate the whole thing. i was really into justina's extra spicy bowl. i liked how tasty it was, although while i like to think i could last thru the whole bowl, i think i probably would have had to drink a lot of water to make it through. is there a spicy grade between regular and extra? i forget, but i think thats where i could fit in. hads got hmm...maybe the classic and ed got the spicy one in mild. i'm pretty sure they liked it. ed said he'd come back but we'll see...

So I have been to a bunch of other not so good Ramen places in my life so my expectations were high for this place....I did my research on yelp and realized that for first timers there is only two ways to go for Ramen Akamaru (if you like the spicey paste) or Shiromaru if you want the classic with no spice I tried the Akamaru and boy was it rich in flavor....so as others point out and their website even points Ramen is the soul of Japan, True but we all know the broth is where its at otherwise every Joe Blo with 19 cents to spare on a package Ramen can pull this off with some work...However when it comes to the broth "folks dont try this at home" ....I can make broth like the best of them when it comes to Pho, Tom Yum and Ramen but i have to say this one is pretty damn good.....I also tried the pork buns that everyone brags about. YES they are as good as advertised get them......My next trip there is going to be great because i cant wait to try their other items....For 2 we were told 1 hour it took 35 minutes at 6 30 pm on a wedensday.....

I'm not a ramen expert, but the ramen here was pretty darn good (also evident by the sheer amount of glowing reviews this place has gotten). The decor is unique and refreshingly different from other restaurants. Based on other reviews, the place was known to have a wait but we came early so we didn't have to wait long for a table. Some tables are shared communal style but they also have booths that are separated by clear glass which I thought was an interesting touch. We were seated at a communal table which consisted of a huge wooden cross section of a tree trunk which was very creative. Also, I guess it's part of the culture at this restaurant but as a waiter comes out of the kitchen with someone's order they will yell out the name of the ramen and then all the other waiters in the vicinity will repeat after them, pretty amusing. Overall the consistency of the ramen (slightly crunchy) and the broth were excellent. My only gripe was that my bowl of ramen w/pork came with about two pieces of pork.

This place was definitely a great find on a cold night in the city. The long wait was well worth it. ÊWe started with the seared ahi while waiting for our ramen. They topped the tuna with small pieces of a grapefruit and avocado; then, placed it on top of their special Ippudo sauce. It was a delight! The tuna was cooked perfectly. As for the ramen, we ordered the Tori Ramen and Akamaru Modern. Each was very different but both were delicious! The broth was seasoned perfectly and everything in each bowl was as good as it gets.

ippudo manages to build upon the success of setagaya and rai rai ken and momofuku noodle bar before it. Êand it's able to do it in a much cooler space that seats more people yet still feels intimate and connected to the kitchen. Êthere are open spaces and communal eating areas along with a L shaped kitchen that is completely open to the dining room to showcase its traditionally dressed chefs as they work on perfecting your ramen. Êthe noodles come out just the right kind of al dente and are skinny enough to slurp down by the mouthful. Êthe broth i had was full and meaty and the pork was quite delicious. Êin some ways the decor and space outdo the ramen because all i really want is good wholesome noodles and that's what ippudo provides. Êthe interesting space is the cherry on top, and is probably the reason for the slightly more expensive prices.

if the ramen here is the best in new york, i pity new yorkers. we ordered the shiro-something ramen and the akumaru ramen. Êthe akumaru ramen is better. Êthe one with the garlic oil in the broth. the noodles itself was disappointing (entirely). Êthe broth and roast pork is as legendary as they say. Êwe were lucky enough to be seated with 2 locals who ordered fresh garlic to be minced into their ramen, which i highly highly recommend. Êthey bring out a garlic mincer and a couple of cloves for you. Êit would have been one of the best ramen i've had if they just had more quality noodles (like the noodles in rai rai ken). Êthe broth is tasty and less greasy than katanya in SF. the hostess who takes your name in line to be seated has a lot of attitude. Êthey really have nothing to be snobbish about - sorry. Êthe hostesses were tasteless, dinky, dumb teenage girls. Êit really does not speak well for the restuarant for first impressions. Êi really liked the lineup of different noodle bowls on the wall behind the bar. Êvery cool deco. the atmosphere once you get into the eating area is pretty cool. Êloved the tables, chairs, deco. Êloved the way everyone seems to stop what they are doing when you walk in a a celebratory hearty greeting, just the chefs. Êi really liked the dinnerware and utensils. Êi really liked the open kitchen so you can see how the chefs cooked. when we walked out, the line was even longer (about 10pm). Êmy first instinct was: i pity the new yorkers. i will go back, minus the snobby attitude and the lines, Êyou are a noodle shop for chrissakes. Êi'll be going back to rai rai ken.

Am I the only one not crazy about this place? Don't get me wrong, I love my hot bowl of ramen and Ippudo delivers a good, solid bowl of it but I don't see what's so orgasmically amazing. It's better than Momofuku noodle bar, I give them that--the noodles are good quailty but the broth is the same, salty liquid that leaves me thirsty at the end of my meal rather than tantalize my taste buds. At least its flavorful but honestly most of the flavor narrows down to saltiness. The decor is nice, staff is great, had the chef daily appetizer (pumpkin mash is good) but I won't remember this place next time I'm in the 'hood.

the wait is long on a busy night, but its worth it!!! Êwhen the say 15-20 min, they really mean 5 minutes! (so have patience...) hands down the best ramen in nyc.....we had the ramen original and special of the day, and 1 (green tea creme brulee), all of which were delicious! Êthe broth is very flavorful and not salty. pork belly appetizer melts in your mouth.... good karaage. super friendly service.... hope it stays consistent.... this ramen spot doesn't just noodle around....there are other dishes on the menu, too...like grilled pork belly (which i MUST try), shrimp tempura and a tofu salad....but the main attraction is the bowl of house-made noodles bathed in the restaurant's famous pork-infused broth, from the classic with pork slices, cabbage and scallions, to miso and soy-enhanced variations.....the menu may be small but the space is vast and sleek, with shimmery warrior art and soup bowls decorating the walls and a plexiglass bar encasing noodles, of course... what makes me want to become a repeat offender is the (my special of the day) extra-rich noodle broth made from long-simmered pork bones (hey, no one claimed that ramen was health food!).... the thin (her original house), chewy noodles are relatively plain, better to soak up flavors from the soup... all just mouthwatering!

5 stars for the ambiance of the place and the service 4.5 stars for the food. i had the classic ramen, my friend ordered the special, and her sister ordered the modern. All 3 soup bases have distinct flavors. I really liked my soup base and the pork, which was so tender it practically melts in your mouth. The ramen was okay. I think I've had better ramen back in the bay area. I like my ramen eggier and chewier. Ippudo's ramen is more like standard noodles. We did manage to catch happy hour, so drinks were 2 for 1.

Maybe it was the overwhelming hype that led me to have high expectations but I was a bit disappointed. ÊThe Akamaru Modern that I ordered was a little too oily and had a strong flavor that I wasn't crazy about. ÊLooking at the menu now, it would have been a better idea to order Shiromaru Hakata Classic that doesn't have the miso paste and garlic oil. ÊMy friends had the shoyu ramen and vegetarian ramen, which was surprisingly good maybe because of its simplicity that I prefer. ÊWe ordered a few appetizers as one bowl of Ippudo ramen is not enough (also because I didn't drink my soup). ÊI was looking forward to the Tako Ponzu but they ran out so we substituted it with some other seafood mix that wasn't bad. ÊThe cucumber appetizer was refreshing and crisp but reminds me of something I could get for free at Chinese restaurants. ÊThe best parts of Ippudo for me was their pork buns (yum - similar to Chinese peking duck buns) and the side order of pork belly. I would probably come here just for these two things and order a side of plain ramen. As for the crazy wait that I expected, my friends and I lucked out, arriving around 6pm on a Tuesday night and were able to be seated fairly quickly. ÊUpon exiting an hour or so later, the place was already jam packed so I would try to get there early to avoid the rush.

Last week when I checked yelp, they had over 1300 reviews. Now over 1400. And four stars!!! I had zero interest in Ramen until eating at Ippido. How good could a bowl of noodles and pork possibly be? Pretty f'n good. The kind of food you think about afterwards and contrive lunchdates to go back to. Believe the numbers, this place is good. The only problem, PROBLEM, I have is how loud they do the Japanese greeting, "irasshaimase".

We called ahead to make sure that there was a vegetarian option for a member of our lunch group (there is, but it's off-menu), and then headed over. Lucky for us there was no wait at lunch, as I've heard there can be quite a wait at dinner. We were greeted by the loudly shouted salutations of the kitchen staff--at first this is charming. When you sit down (we sat in one of the large and generous booths), you realize that the shouted greetings at each group entering can get incredibly irritating on the nerves. They do a lot of shouting at Ippudo. The five of us ordered four different dishes, and mine was the Shiromaru Hakata Classic. None of us ordered the lunch set, because the noodles seemed like enough food. We were all very happy with our food. I am big on noodle soup, and let me tell you that this place is very good. The broth is savory and the noodles have the right texture. I would definitely revisit.

I have been there for an early Sunday brunch with a friend. I was a meeting a friend there with ten minutes late and we got our seats 30 minutes later. Atmosphere is great, sort of modern NYC-Japaneseing decor with a view to the kitchen where we can admire the cooks preparing and cleaning the ramen. The waitress was a great hostess, smiling, advising and making sure you live a great experience. Some other Japanese waitresses were barely speaking English or could not understand what I was saying which led in a wrong order. But, no big deal, it could have happened in Tokyo!!! I started with the buns, one word: yummy! It melted in my mouth with so much flavors in it. Then ordered the house's ramen which was quite flavory and quite filling for this price so it satisfied me pretty much. I am not a good food critic, but usually go by the experience, and this time it was an intriguing travel in a fancy ramen place. I am more used to the hole in the wall type of ramen shops, and ippudo can come really close to the authentic quality. Overall, I would really go again with more friends to enjoy the big tables, for the buns and try the other house specialties.

i almost NEVER bother writing reviews here, and although ippudo hardly needs my vote of confidence, just thinking about eating there several months ago is making my mouth water. the ramen: got the classic akamaru modern, with the suggested extra toppings (hard boiled egg and braised pork belly, extra $6). there's nothing else to say except that it was exceptional. having lived in japan and being pretty familiar with japanese cuisine, i feel comfortable saying this may be the best ramen i've ever had. the pork belly, while delicious, does make the whole bowl taste fattier, and though it should absolutely be tried the first time, i may skip it from now on. hirata pork buns: yes everyone raves about these, but for a reason. it seems unfair to compare them to your standard pork bun, as this is really an entirely different beast, but it also is one of the best i've ever had. ippudo isn't cheap, but for the quality it's also not outrageous, and certainly worth the occasional trip every now and then. GO.

LOVE, love, love this place! I've been to many ramen places but none of them really left a lasting impression as Ippudo has. it is by far, the BEST yet! I'm not one who usually like to drink soups/broths, but the broth they use in their Akamaru Modern here is so good that I will drink it all up by itself! The pork belly is just orgasmic to your tastebuds and melts in your mouth! The best time to go is right when they open up for the dinner rush at about 6pm...anytime after that, then expect a very LONG wait! I've been here once where there was a 3...yes, THREE hour wait for a table! Crazy, i know...and the prices are pretty expensive don't get me wrong (afterall, this is just ramen right? )...ahh, but it is NOT JUST ramen! it's an ADDICTION!!!...and it's well worth it!

LOVE the ramen! Really like the decor and atmosphere once I get back into the restaurant but the wait is always so long and they don't take reservations. Pork buns have a great flavor but I think they're a little empty, could use some more filling. Momofuku's pork buns are still my favorite. Would return during the week or early in the day because 45 minutes in the cold, tiny bar area is a long time, even when the reward is a steaming bowl of delicious broth.

ÊSince this was the first time there, we ordered a classic and modern, when they brought us the bowls, they were calling it by their japanese name which to be honest, I didn't pay much attention to but it turned out to be for the table next to us and the server was a bit rude about it.

If you have to wait more than 30 min to get into the place, I'd suggest you go elsewhere since it's really not worth the wait. The ramen is not bad, but definitely not out of this world and remotely comparable to ramens in Japan. ÊThe broth tends to be a bit more oily than other places such as Menkui Tei and Menchanko Tei. ÊHowever, my friend had the chicken broth ramen once and it did taste quite good and was not as oily. All in all, it's a great place if there's no wait and you need to satisfy your ramen craving.

Just to be clear, I love the Modern ramen at Ippudo. If you like great ramen and don't care about the service then scroll down to the next review. Last night would have been my fourth time there. I was told that there was a 30-minute wait for a table for two when I told the hostess to put my name down. My husband has not arrived yet and had to run over to Kmart pharmacy across the street to get some saline solution for my baby. I made it back 20 minutes later, so did my husband and we checked back in with the hostess. She said maybe 15 minutes more. So we stationed purselves at the bar - it was happy hour - 2 for 1 Kirins! ÊWe stayed put even though I'm not a big fan of crowded bars. After about 20 minutes, the other hostess went around asking for everyone's name so I figure, hey they're doing their best. After 10 more minutes, there was a bigger group that clearly came after us Êthat got called so I approached the hostess. She said exasperatingly - we called your name 20 minutes ago! I go, no we were right at the bar we would have heard. She kept insisting - I called your name 20 minutes ago - we looked for you at the bar, outside, and nobody came! It's gonna be another 15 minutes. No apologies, excuses, nothing. Of course we canceled and left. A big bowl of beautiful ramen is not worth being treated this way. Went to Ramen Setagaya. Maybe they think that being insanely popular makes them think that it gives them a right to be rude.

After a couple of months of pleading, I brought my girlfriend to Ippudo, expecting an overpriced meal that I could have made at home for $1 of your typical Ramen noodles. ÊMy expectations were half on. ÊI found the Ramen a bit overpriced. ÊI ordered the first listed Ramen noodle in the menu, expecting a sizable portion of Ramen and a good size piece of pork. ÊThough the Ramen portion was adequate, the two thinly sliced pieces of pork left a lot to be desired. ÊI realize food prices have increased from last year, but would it kill them to add a few more pork slices? ÊI do have to admit the broth for my Ramen was sensational. ÊThe broth for the second Ramen listing, which my girlfriend ordered, was amazing! ÊThe broth definitely makes the soup. ÊThe Ramen were fresh and wonderful, but the small portion left a lot to be desired. The same could be said about the fried chicken entree (I believe it was $9). ÊThough tasty, this piece of dark meat chicken thigh meat was not worth it's price. ÊThis went way beyond NYC pricing. I cannot recommend this restaurant, not because of the overpriced items, but for the lack of hygiene and sanitary practices of the staff. ÊThere were several staff members wearing open toed sandals (toe jam/lint/dirt clearly visible)...very unsanitary and dangerous. ÊTo top it all off, there was no soap AND toilet paper in the men's restroom. ÊHow do the staff wash their hands after using the restroom? ÊWith just water? ÊI THINK NOT! ÊI told the hostess of the problems in the men's restroom before I sat down for my meal. ÊI went back to the restroom after my meal only to find the restroom STILL out of toilet paper and soap. These hygiene and sanitary problems are not hard to fix. ÊShame on you, Ippudo, for your lack of common sense in remedying these hygiene and sanitary problems. ÊThe NYC Department of Health should truly take a closer look at your restaurant. ÊThese are major DOH violations. ÊI grew up in the restaurant business and ran a restaurant for two years, so I am familiar with the DOH and their strict requirements that they have in place to not only protect the patrons of an establishment but the wokers as well. As tasty as the meal was (albeit pricey), I cannot overlook the hygiene and sanitary problems of this restaurant, so I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone nor can I give this restaurant more than 3 stars.

I came here the other day during lunchtime and had the lunch set with Akamaru Modern ramen and a rice bowl with pork. The ramen was very delicious but a bit salty for my taste. I would say what makes the ramen delicious in comparison to other places is the texture and taste of the noodles- they have a great bite or springiness to them and just taste wonderfully fresh. The rice bowl was also a delicious complement to the ramen consisting of rice, tender pork and mayonnaise on top. The meal also deserves some points in terms of presentation. The lunch set (ramen + rice bowl) fills you up well so definitely try it for a satisfying lunch!

We came on Sunday afternoon at 1:30 and the wait was an estimated hour and a half. ÊWhen we told the hostess that we Êwere going to leave and would try another time, she seemed genuinely apologetic about the long wait and advised us to visit them when they first open in the morning. ÊWe took their advice and arrived at 11:40 (they open at 11:30) on Monday morning and were seated right away. ÊThe cooks in the kitchen all yelled out their greetings which was not unusual but just seemed especially boisterous so early in the morning. ÊWe were seated in the center communal table on small white loveseats that separated in the middle. ÊIt was pretty cool and very modern. ÊWe ordered the pork buns, spicy tonkatsu ramen and the shiromaru classic with extra chashu pork. The pork buns was a revelation, soft pillowy buns in the shape of a clamshell,slices ofsucculent pork tucked in, and with a bit of mayo. ÊI ate one immediately and saved the other one for later which was a mistake. ÊCooled down, the pork bun became more of the familiar pork buns of my culinary past, a little more doughy but still tasty. ÊLesson learned!--eat it while hot! The Shiromaru ramen was fabulous. ÊThe broth was deeply and richly flavoured, a little thicker akin to stew and the noodles were pleasantly chewy. ÊThe spicy ramen had heat but it wasn't the kind that tickles annoyingly in the back of the throat. ÊWe ordered an extra order of noodles and shared it between the two of us. ÊAhhh...it was so satisfying! By the time we left, at 12:30ish, the crowd in the lobby had grown 15-20 strong. ÊEarly birds are smart diners I've learned!

Ramen joints to the Japanese are like burger joints to Americans, and Ippudo is one of the leaders in that market. While other dishes are tasty (I recommend the miso cod), you're here for one thing.

I don't like it when people give this place a bad review because they are hot and cranky...this place is great to me. I love the way the staff greets me in Japanese. ÊMy boyfriend had the Akamaru Modern and I took a taste of that and that was outstanding. I had the Samurai Ribs that was really good with a bowl of rice. I love the Kyoto chili pepper that came with my ribs. I will definitely come back and get the Akamaru next time. Even though the tables were communal which I am not a big fan of, the seating was not too bad here. You did not hear your neighbors. It was a perfect ending to a perfect day!

recommended by visiting friends from ann arbor whose last pick was Momofuku went at 6 pm on a weekday - empty, no wait, very nice service edamame terrific as were the pork buns - at least as good as Momo we had four ramens, mostly the modern, which had the silkiest deepest taste of any ramen i have had - including several visits to Japan dessert was a green tea creme brule - very good overall service and food were spectacular

If you don't like this place there might be something wrong with your taste buds. Yes, there is a wait. Think of it as part of the experience and order one (or two) of their fabulous cocktails. The pork buns were delicious - so good that my friend had trouble deciding whether they were as good as Momofuku's or not...that's always a good sign. The ramen was fabulous - SO rich and yummy. It may not be the BEST in NYC, but it's got to be close. The food was AMAZING.

First impression of this place: wait was kinda long but employees were very welcoming and very enthusiastic. Enjoyed the atmosphere, had a very homey feeling. Lighting was perfect, not too dim nor bright. I was hesitant on spending $13 on ramen but there's a first time for everything and I didn't regret a single penny. Food was awesome, never had ramen like that before. I would definitely come back and try out the other stuff on the menu.

OK, let me start with the good. The pork is good. The pork buns were delicious. And the servers are super nice but that doesnt make up for all the pit falls of this place... RAMEN should never be 10-20 dollars a bowl...NEVER. Hot sauce should NEVER cost an extra 2 dollars...AND if I have paid for my food, I SHOULD ALWAYS be able to take it home with me if I cannot finish it...The ladies at my table were essentially forced to stuff themselves just on principle because they just paid so much for their ramen. Truthfully, it is morally unconscionable as it is a terrible waste of food- I some times give my left overs to homeless people- and Im SURE the restaurant just throws it all away. I dont care what your policy is- and REALLY?, are you really that worried that Im going to take your ramen home to my kitchen chemistry lab to steal your recipe (they actually said that they dont want people stealing their recipe) They also said "well, the noodles will get soggy and it wont be as good." Listen, I understand that's how it works; I understand the nature of leftovers, but the noodles are mine and I can do what I want with them. I can throw in some extra ingredients if I want to Ê(GASP) when Im home in my PJs eating MY NOODLES. If I only eat half, and you dont let me take home the other half, you should only charge me half the price. The food was tasty, sure (though I got a tummy ache after) but it's expensive for what it is, and no matter how friendly the service is or how much they shout stuff at me to make me feel welcomed, the policy of not being able to take food home is absurd and makes it a completely pretentious place. Ramen and pretension do not go together. Actually, I think this policy is against the law...Im never going back and I suggest you diners out there take that into consideration before you go and wait 45 minutes to sit. Im sure you can find noodles that are just as good if not better in Chinatown or Flushing for a fraction of the cost.Im sure you can get it to go and you can eat it naked if you want in the comfort of your living room or not have a single bite and save it for the next day even if the noodles do get bit soggy.

I am giving Ippudo 5 stars because it delivers on everything that it promises. I have been twice, the second time I went we waited over an hour, and I just don't care. Everything is good. The service is good. The pork buns are so good that I'm considering making them the last thing I eat on earth. All of the noodles are great.

good- not GREAT. staff was uber friendly. kind of pricey for instant noodles with some thrown on pork belly. granted their pork belly buns were delish but i couldnt justify the price.. i'd come here again, but i wish they gave larger portions! yummy but not super filling if ur on a $20/perperson budget. the ramen is SUPER salty.. probably msg filled... :( had greater expectations...

Lord, this place rules so hard! ÊEvery person I've ever taken there has raved about it. ÊEverything is so delicious. ÊI could eat their pork buns forever...no really...like for eternity. ÊThe staff are amazing and the vibe is really great. ÊI've never had a bad wait staff experience and I've been there many times. ÊTheir happy hour 2 for 1 is perfect while you wait to be seated. ÊThat's right, folks. ÊSome things are worth waiting for and most nights you will have a wait to get seated. ÊI find if you plan to go there and put your name down at least an hour in advance of when you want to get seated, you can't go wrong. ÊCentral Bar is right near by so you can always pop over there for a pint as well to pass the time. Ê(They have a pretty decent spread of beers at that joint, by the way.) ÊThe seating (long large tables) at Ippudo lends itself to meeting new people and adds to the fun of the experience as well, if you ask me. ÊEven their desserts are fantastic. ÊI'm just gushing at this point but, long story short...Ippudo is just as wonderful as all the hype. ÊGo go go!

This place really doesn't need another review given that the gazillion+ reviews it already has should be enough confirmation to how wonderful this place is. ÊI don't particularly think the service is the best, but it's decent for what I've experienced anywhere else in NYC. I've been living in NYC for two months now and this place is so good I've eaten here at least 6 times already. ÊI fell in love with ramen because of this place. ÊMomofuko and Totto Ramen are good too, but I enjoy the other dishes you can order at Ippudo better. ÊI suggest pairing your ramen dish (I prefer the modern) with the grilled peppers, cucumber slices in sesame oil, and the pork buns! So Yummy! :)

This compares Ippudo to Naruto. I know this is not a fair comparison for the both restaurants. OK for price, Naruto is by far the more affordable in both quantity and quality. On Monday, had ramen noodle lunch for two including tip for $20. The ingredients was simply delicious and cooked in front of you. There was a lot more goodies in the noodle bowl at Naruto then at Ippudo. More ramen, bean sprouts, eggs, scallions, pork, seaweed, fish cake, and various other yummy stuff that I may have forgotten to mention. The setting is vastly different. Ippudo is a restaurant with tables and a capacity for maybe 100+ customers. Naruto is a quarter the size and can handle maybe 12 customers. It is a typical ramen noodle stand setting. Basically a bar like setup with the cook and all the cooking done in front of you. Ippudo takes credit card while Naruto is cash only. The average price for dishes at Ippudo is about $15 while the Naruto is $10. Both restaurants are PACKED as soon as it opens and there is usually a waiting list. The bottom line is that if you want a normal restaurant setting then Ippudo is the choice. Both restaurants offer the most delicious fresh ramen noodle and is similar but IMHO I prefer Naruto for the quality and quantity.

I love Ramen. I'd heard about Ippudo NYC for some time. Finally got a chance when taken for a birthday. Popular? Its JAMMED. Always packed with crowds waiting hours to get in! We got there for early dinner at 5pm, and already the line was 40-50 Êdeep. We were told "20-30 min wait". 20 mins later we were still 10-15 mins away. However people arriving then were being told it would be a 1.5 hr wait. And many people waited. Me, I only would wait that long at DiFara's, and even that is pushing it. When we finally got in, we were seated at the counter but I like that, its traditional ramen-ya (place) style. You can watch all the action as they cook, and pick up some technique. Decor: "Very Upscale Japanese modern style NY restaurant". Personally I prefer "homey" laid-back traditional in a ramen-ya for example Rai-Rai Ken; ÊStaff at Ippudo are funny in that they all scream loudly every minute or so in Japanese. Supposed to be theatrical and show traditional the typical Japanese Team Spirit in staff. Staff is numerous and attentive though that is in part to turn tables as quickly as possible as it is so crowded. We ordered the 2 most famous types of ramen there; Akamaru and Shiromaru. When Ramen arrived, in a big but not huge bowl it looked beatiful. However I was surprised to see one very thick slice of "cha-shiu" pork. Normally its is cut thinly and there are 3 slices. Ippudo's chashiu is very fatty, and in my opinion it shoud have been trimmed much more, but they are into the fat is flavorful, Berkshire Pork, Momofuku thing. B 3/4 inch of fat? Too much and too thick, hard to eat easily. But the Soup in both ramen broths? Fantastic! Rich, deep flavored soup. Wonderful. The ramen noodle were good (could have been more al dente for me). Price: I do think what they charge ($14) for a bowl of ramen is way too pricey. Much more than other places but they are going for the "momofuku upscale" it angle. So finally, very good ramen, but too expensive; worth the wait to get it? 20 mins, yes. An hour, no way.

I tried to eat here a week ago with my friend from Philly it had an hour to an hour and half wait time. ÊI figured it must be good, I asked some other people about Ippudo and found out it was a chain from Japan. ÊI was excited that this Ramen might be my new New York winter love... sadly it was not. ÊI didn't eat there that day but returned for lunch still with 20 minute wait in a small space with suit creative types and aging yuppies filling the hall... all waiting for there table. ÊOnce brought in to the dinning area it was cafeteria style "high-end" setting with little style nor flavor, seamed to be targeting the waiting crowd outside. ÊI looked at the menu and ordered the special ramen and set with a small salad and side of rice with pork. ÊThe waiter quickly disappeared and returned Êwith an amazing side dishes that had great flavor this increased my excitement for the noodles that awaited me... however soon the bowl came and a clearish dark water light broth with less then normal amount of noodles and cardboard pork. My friend ordered the spicy ramen which was alittle thicker but still did not beat the hype this place has been getting never the less a hour and halk wait never the less a twenty minute one. I still think Minca is the place to go for Ramen in New York.... No bad we can't get pho in this city.

I can't believe what happened! We got there at 3PM and was really excited to find the place. However when I approach the hostess and told her that we wanted a table of two, she asked if we had put our name on the list. I told her no and she said that they will not be taking any more customers because the wait list was too long. When I looked around all I can see is about 10-12 people waiting.

Let's see, had: Akamaru Modern, Onsens Tamago+Kakuni appetizer, and I think the Hirata pork buns? Oh, and yogurt sorbet. Food: Was quite good overall. Everything was very tasty. all in all, very good, no serious misses, just nothing mind-blowing. Details: Pork belly well done across the board, soft, tender and rich tasting. Noodles, while not exactly what i thought of when i think of ramen (and no, i do not think instant ramen is ramen), were quite silky. Maybe not chewy enough, i think. broth was very flavorful, complemented noodle without being crazy salty/msg-y. i could actually drink some of the broth. meat in the ramen was spiced well enough that it maintained flavor even while sitting in soup and was little bit of alternate flavor that nibbled on between bites of noodles. the pork bun thing was spicy and tasty. only thing that might have been a let down was the onsen tamago. was supposed to be poured over the kakuni, but once poured, really added nothing. i love onsen tamago normally, but it just didnt do anything here. Êyogurt sorbet was tasty, but didnt really taste like yogurt, has more a cream-cheese/cheesecake-y flavor to it. Ambience: Ok, cool looking I guess. Not too into that stuff, was trying hard to be hip (succeeding, i guess, if you're into that, but i'm not). Case in point: why bother going for a distinctly Japanese tradition/practice of yelling greetings at customers, when most of the staff yelling can't actually say irrashaimase or arigatogozaimashita properly and just mumble-yell something that seems like it might be Japanese? At that point I just laugh at the gimmickyness of wanting to seem really authentic, but not caring enough to do more than fake it Êbecause most of the people won't know the difference and would be taken in by the cool mumble-japanese greetings. Not that ippudo's the only one though, i think EN brasserie and maybe a couple others do it too. Service - Ok, kinda rushed us though. If i cared about ambience and service that much, I'd take off a star...but they weren't atrocious and I care about food much more. Prices? Pricey for ramen, I guess, but food's good and you leave full.

Êi ask the hostess and she says, oh yea, we seat people with kids in the back so you have to wait for that to open up. uh, excuse me? i am calling bullshit in any place that doesnt take reservations, and then makes you wait even longer than they specify because they hate kids.

This is my first review on Yelp, but unfortunately there are NO ACCOLADES for Ippudo. ÊI would award them 0 stars, but Yelp doesn't give me that option. ÊI've been coming here for ramen, since I moved to NY about 2 years ago; While I do admit enjoying Ippudo's ramen (esp. Akamaru Modern), I can't go back out of principle. Êyesterday, I abruptly left the restaurant when management decided to slap me with a surcharge of $4/person for eating a cupcake in their restaurant. ÊNo one gave me a warning, but they just automatically added the ridiculous surcharge to my tab. ÊI went late in the afternoon, and did not have to wait for a table, but for some reason, things were EXTREMELY SLOW in the kitchen. ÊI mean, come on, it should take 5 minutes to bring out a bowl of ramen. ÊI was STARVING and the only thing to stave off my hunger were the cupcakes that I bought from Butter Lane. ÊI asked if, instead, I could order an appetizer or drinks, but they didn't even give me the option. ÊMoreover, I think it's annoying when this "policy" was not listed anywhere on the menu. ÊThe manager on duty said management is allowed to do whatever they please, but shouldn't they, instead, try to please the customers? ÊAfterall, you are paying $15 for a bowl of peasant food. ÊSo fellow YELPERS, beware! Oh and if you want amazing pork buns, head over to Momofuku Milk Bar and get some to go. ÊThey are simply delightful, delectable treats that aren't measly in size compared to Ippudo's.

If I was just rating the service staff and the food I would give five stars, but since I'm rating the whole experience its 1. ÊThe front door people are so ridiculous it blows my mind. ÊI've been ~15x in the past 2 years and the each time the hostesses get worse and worse. ÊThere's always a wait but when someone tells you you're crazy for wiling 2+hours and then is rude when you that's fine it incomprehensible. ÊFor one its really not that hard to estimate the wait when you know how many tables there are, the average time per table, AND they take your number to supposedly call you when it's getting close. ÊInstead they give you a useless expected wait time, then occasionally walk around to see whose still around that is on the list, randomly calling names (yet the took your number to call you though they never call), and then after an hour or so when you check back in they act like your crazy for asking how much longer. ÊIt's GREAT that they have a restaurant with the best ramen in the city and can get away with millions of tourists willing to deal with absurd wait policies, BUT when your core voting constituency has to constantly deal with such nonsense, you are destined for failure. ÊIf the Japanese owners knew what rude and poor service that the hostesses provided I guarantee they'd have a breakdown. ÊMy prediction is Ippudo's will not be profitable in a years time. Everytime I've been there recently the crowds are less and less. ÊEventually people will be over the ramen trend and when they are the core crowd will already be gone. ÊGood luck ass holes. ÊSye a nora!! ÊYou won't see this patron again, just out of principle.

ramen....mmmmm..... another place that is a one block walk from my office. the broth base is kick ass. the ramen is def fresh. one of the better ramen bowls i've had. walking inside, it's like iron chef meets ultra cool nyc lounge. except no dj booth. lots of screaming going on greeting and saying good bye to customers in japanese. it was difficult to have a convo with screaming going on every 30 secs. other than that, good place. anyway, i had the shimaru moto ramen. very well prepared and it just generates a warm feeling going down in you. could it be from the heat of the broth? or is it warming my soul? since the website says "ramen is japan's soul food." i also ordered the kakumi which is pork belly. REALLY GOOD. Fatty. BUT wow, so tender and so flavorful. i can see myself coming here pretty often in the winter months, but i will have to pass during the hot and humid nyc days in the summer months. and this ain't your college ramen noodles made in dorms. bowls are $13-$16 bucks i believe.

not that ippudo NEEDS any more positive reviews, but here i am, since i just like it so much. i am a ramen addict. i could eat it everyday, in spite of my desire to ban carbs (not gonna happen) this place has great pork buns, i think they are better than momofukus, but the star is the ramen. i like the crinkly kinds the best, not sure if the shape changes anything but htey seem springier and chewier to me. i like me noodles al al denteee. the broth is a little salty, but thats ok with me, and all the toppings are fresh. the only thing that annoys me is they charge you for spicy sauce. why!! plus, i would buy more beer if you gave me free spicy sauce. i love you anyway.

Great ramen place - is it as great as the bowl of ramen I had in Cairns, Australia (of all places) that I can't stop dreaming about in my sleep? Probably not - but definitely has some very addictive great broths - we tried 4 different ones among our table and I'd say the spicy miso one (last ramen on menu) and the 2nd one on the menu was uninamously our favorite. Noodles were goood in some but better in others such as the spicy miso. It was a bit scary when they pile this ball of grated ginger in the middle, but I have a feeling it had something else in there as well - I mean that much ginger in any dish would have completely overpowered the dish. Had a duck appetizer which I appreciated that had some of that yummy japanese mustard and some weird peppercorn - not sure which type. Deliicous - the downfall? The wait... it's not worth an extremely long wait, luckily we came on a day when there was rain and it was cold so I think that deterred the wait.

i love ramen. Êthis is probably the best ramen i've had. Êthe modern and the special were amazing. Êthe classic was solid but a bit too creamy. Êsake was terrific. Êgets really crowded fast. Êour group of 8 got there before the place opened in order to avoid the rush.

I thought I would offer the view of a non-expert, since everyone else seems to be such an expert on what good ramen is supposed to taste like... We had tried to go to Ippudo before, without any luck due to a 2-hour wait, etc. This time, at 5pm on a Sunday, the wait was 20 minutes (so we put our name on the list and went to Sunrise for some Japanese food shopping). We had never had real ramen before, but I had read the reviews in several places. I ordered the classic (on top of the ramen menu) and my partner the Tori ramen. I chose pork belly and egg as my toppings. The pork belly and the broth of the classic ramen was delicious. We both likes it better than the Tori ramen broth. The pork loin pieces, mushrooms, ginger all complimented the taste. We were stuffed in the end, but were able to eat all or most of our dishes. So I don't know how good Ippudo ramen in NY compares to the "real thing" but for what it is, these two dishes were delicious. I would certainly go back (on a Sunday at 4-5pm without the line. No food is worth waiting for for more than 30 minutes, and if you feel like it is, then you should learn to make it yourself!)

sorry not worth the 2 hour wait. period. the "famous" pork bun was just regular pork bun with mayo, yea gee, great idea, we all know mayo makes things taste better. ÊThe ramen had very little content, and it tastes just like....any other Japanese ramen.

not going to find a better ramen house in town. they also have many starters on the menu, as well. the menu isn't too much, just about right for a ramen house that offers ramen and a tad bit more. it's all pretty good stuff. it's not 5 stars for a few reasons, but I hate to be overcritical. this place is very good, enough said.

doing some late updates from the labor day weekend. to start off we went early for lunch on a sunday and this place was jam packed!! waited an hour and the host was pretty rude and could not gauge time. in terms of food i've had much better ramen in the west coast for cheaper. it's about $14 for a bowl of ramen and the portion is on the smaller size. ÊHOWEVER one thing i was pretty satisfied with was the pork buns. i would've bumped it up to 3 stars but i'm still pissed at the host. if i could just eat pork buns than i'd give 5 stars. the bun, special sauce and delicious pork belly are amazing but at $9 for two it's a li'l pricey.

Ippudo is my favorite restaurant in NYC. I tried it on a whim when I worked in the neighborhood, having no idea about its reputation as the best ramen outside of Japan or about the insane 2 hour waits. Its best to try this place at lunchtime when you'll still wait, but for not nearly as long. This place opens for dinner at 5 pm and there's already a line by 5 minutes after 5. All I can say is...it's that good. I have waited for an hour and a half before..and quite happily. It is worth the wait. The dining room is open and inviting and the staff are prompt and courteous. But the RAMEN!!! The broth is savory and complex and wonderful. The noodles are handmade everyday in the basement and when you combine the two elements...it is utter magic. During the cooler months this is the best meal you can have. The hirata buns taste like a little salty cloud in your mouth. There are several different kinds of ramens, but most menu items all contain pork both in the broth and in the toppings. I don't eat pork, although the friends I take there RAVE about the broth and the amazing array of meats and toppings. I order the vegetarian ramen which is STELLAR, and I always get a nitamago which is a japanese marinated hard boiled egg. I'm getting hungry just writing this, There is something for everyone here. veggie or not. If you're looking for the best ramen in New York city. Ippudo is it.

don't really understand the high ratings from so many people. Êthe ramen was nothing too special, although the place was very friendly and the service was awesome. Êwe got a seat in front of the chefs in the kitchen and we could see them making all the food. ÊOrdered the miso ramen and it was pretty good. ÊDon't really recommend this place as something to go out of your way for. ÊLine is usually pretty long too.

i was looking forward eating at Ippudo however the experience did not excel my expectation, i was some what disappointed, first of all me and friend pick the wrong season to have ramen, on a hot humid summer day ramen is less enjoyable, we should have went for cold soba, and it is very pricy for lunch, $19 for my lunch set =P, for ramen i think that's is pricy, the soup was thick, very tasty, however this is also one of the few time i cannot finish the ramen soup base

I don't think that I can add anymore to what has already been said. ÊYes, the wait was criminally wrong, and while we're at it, so were the prices. ÊBut this is NYC, and if you read any of the reviews, you'd know what you were walking into. ÊOur wait was 2 hrs. ÊWe missed our name being called after 1.5 hrs and had the hostess reprimand us. ÊI know, I know, but...seriously? ÊAnyways, we all ordered ramen. ÊI had the original, and my companions ordered the...I forget...the second flavor that starts with an A....and a vegetarian option that was not on the menu. ÊMine was the tastiest by far. ÊI think this is the best ramen I've ever had...granted, 80% of it is instant, but this dish was on par with some of the homemade Viet noodles my mother slaved over at home. ÊWe all ordered extra noodles. ÊMy only complaint is that for the price, I felt the portions should have been larger and with more toppings. ÊI certainly shouldn't have to pay for another handful of noodles. ÊBut as far as NYC restaurants go, I should be thankful they didn't charge more than $2. ÊI'd definitely recommend this place to anyone.

ok might be on a 5 star roll.. with Totto fresh on my mind about a month ago i can be sure of my rating here. Êsecond time here and its been confirmed. Êonly downfall is the dang wait each time... Decor & Service - Ok so this place is not your typical ramen store and is big! Êa lot of dining space but they still have an hour and half wait for tables. Êbut the service was top notch especially this time. Êwe had a very gracious young lady who helped us pick out a great sake (gokujo ginjo yoshinokawa). Êshe gave us a little tasting of a few before we chose one. Êstaff was also helpful in explaining the dishes and choices Food & Drink - already mentioned very good sake selection and staff is helpful is selecting..onto the food Hirata Buns -steamed buns, filled with your choice of pork or ground chicken, served with lppudo original spicy buns sauce - this was AWESOME. Êone of my favorite apps of all time. Êbetter version of Cha Siu Baos (chinese roast pork buns) Avocado And Tofu Tartar- avocado and tofu with kelp beads, served with sesame and a kuromitsu (brown sugar syrup) dressing sauce - not much expectation on this one and turned out to be really good. small portion though.. Agedashi Tofu -deep fried tofu in dashi broth, topped with grated daikon radish, ginger and scallions - mainstay for japanese menus and didn't disappoint Samurai Rib -berkshire pork spare ribs, seasoned with soy based 'tare' sauce, served with kyoto seven-spice chili pepper - ok these ribs were ridiculously good. Êcould compete with ribs from any BBQjoint. Êloved this.. i would order this and pork buns every time and maybe split a ramen if your just dining with two people. Ramens - Akamaru Modern'the original tonkotsu' soup noodles with ippudo's special sauce, miso paste and fragrant garlic oil, slices of simmered berkshire pork, cabbage, onions, kikurage & scallions - seems like this is the go to ramen. Êjust can't go wrong on this one. Êfirst timers i recommend this one. Shoyu Ramensoy flavored ramen noodles soup, a combination of chicken and tonkotsu soup, with slice of berkshire pork, cabbage, naruto, & scallions - i had this first time and is good but soup if a bit more rich Kogashi Misotonkotsu based noodle soup, a dark, rich broth made from roasted miso, topped with slices of berkshire pork, fish cake, green bok choice cabbage, and glazed with a layer of oil - had a version of this on the menu but it was called something else. Êi believe Karaga? Êit was spicy but they give you a big ball of ginger and garlic that made it really hard to enjoy the soup. Tori Ramensalt flavored ramen noodles, a combination of ippudo 'chintan clear chicken and tonkotsu soup, topped with slices of berkshire pork, 1/2 hard boiled egg, onion, menma, naruto, shiso & scallions - this is like their plain hamburger version. Êstill really good but prob more for someone who has never had ramen. there are addition items you can add to the ramen and i definitely recommend Nitamago - hard boiled egg and the Kakuni - braised pork belly. too full for any dessert Overall - for now they sit atop as the king of ramen in nyc for me. Êi have to refresh my memory on some other places but fairly confident Ippudo can hold the belt. Êonly other issue i might have is the price. Êpretty expensive for ramen and with other items it can add up..oh and of course the wait.. (if over an hour you could consider going few doors down to amsterdam billards for darts or pool)

OK, $13 IS pricey for a bowl of noodle soup, but this was some seriously good noodle soup. Nice texture on the ramen (although I agree with tahnee a's review that they're a bit on the thin side) and the soup was really delicious. The pork melted in your mouth and I kicked myself for not ordering more. I do wish there was less MSG in the broth...I found myself parched walking out of the place. and some more veg toppings, like the ones at Mitsuwa. And the hard-cooked eggs were overdone with that ugly green ring around the yolk. We also tried the shisito peppers which were deep fried, I expected battered b/c they're fried, but they're not. The peppers came with a little dish of seasoned salt that tasted a little citrusy, maybe yuzu? Tasty, but again, pretty pricey at $7-8 for a small dish. Lastly, the wait staff were not especially friendly. They weren't rude by any means, but for a sit-down meal where I need to tip, I just expected a tiny bit more. Still, I'd go back.

OMG!! I wasn't very happy. I couldn't choose any food and enjoy in here. Uhhh...still eating pork fatty ramen from Japan.... Maybe ramen itself is made of meet broth. As a beef producer and veterinary student from Nebraska, the logic presented by Food, Inc., leaves me scratching my head. How exactly are we part of some grand evil mega-corporate scheme? I would encourage people who are interested in where their food comes from to talk to the people who actually raise the food, not activists that need to scare people to make money... Anyway, now in Japan ramen is improving. I thought traditional Japanese Foods (Not only Sushi) are very healthy. You know everyday you can see " Lose weight without dieting..., Eat healthy...." on TV and some Magazine. People who doesn't care about that are eating whatever they want!!. But people who care about themselves, ecology, their baby... are eating really good food what they choose. Be healthy and beauty! In here in America "Yes we can!" I thought perfect vegetable ramen is only in Japan. Because you know such a traditional Ê healthy way from Japan "Macrobiotic". If you try to find out, it makes sense everything what I try to say. Finally, I found perfect cute ramen noodle shop in New York City. YES! YES! YES! ÊSouen Macrobiotic Restaurant opened new noodle shop in East Village ( on East 6 St Bet 1 & 2 Ave) lately. I'm very very happy about that. Even they have extraordinary sweets ( sugar egg milk diary wheat free !! ) . I can choose to eat ramen.

Well, I haven't exactly had a chance to eat their ramen yet, if only they would stop running out of it, and the wait wasn't ridiculously long. ÊMy husband and his friends went there on Saturday afternoon and were told that they had run out of ramen, and that they were going to reopen at 5pm. ÊFast forward to 9:30pm the same day, there we were, thinking we would definitely be able to try it out, and lo and behold, the wait we were told was going to be 2 and a half hours!! ÊAt 9:30pm, a 2.5 hour wait?! ÊThat's just crazy! ÊWhat kind of business runs out of their main product the first week that they're open?! ÊThere were actually people dozing off on a couple of chairs near the entrance! ÊNot too mention, there was a sign on the window that said they may run out of soup for the ramen, in which case they would be closing early. ÊWith my luck, I'd wait for 2.5 hours to find out they've run out, so we just decided to head back home and try again another day. ÊI'm giving this place one star for now since I had to choose one. I'll be back to update it once I've actually been able to eat something there. Just thought I give a heads up to those of you who are planning to go - you may want to go when they first open to avoid any of this nonsense.

don't get me wrong, the food is good (i usually like the modern or pork buns) - but the hostess (especially the one with the crazy spirally curly hair) are so so rude. Êbig power trip. Êi've been several times and obviously know there will be a wait. Êthis is what happened: she told us our wait would be 30-40 minutes (after putting our name down an hour before). Êin 35 minutes we checked back and my friend and i both heard her say "your table is ready, they are just cleaning it." Êi thought that was great and went to get the rest of our party that was waiting outside to come inside. Ê15 minutes later i go back to her and say, what happened to our table? Êand she says "i SAID they were PAYING. Êthey are still sitting there." Êwhoa whoa whoa. Êwe both heard her say they were cleaning the table. Êcleaning does not sound like paying. Êshe was pretty nasty and her attitude made the wait for the food totally not worth it. Êthey also tried to rush us out and we refused to be rushed. Êhow can we have our dining time be half the time of our waiting time?? Êespecially when we see empty tables around us. Êi think ippudo has a huge power trip and is not worth the wait. Êthey need to straighten up their attitude.
