Great dessert / date place. I've only had their desserts so I can't really comment on their actual food. I imagine it would be fine though. I wasn't actually a fan of the black sesame tofu or any of the other really soft desserts, but I was HUGE fan of the warm sweet potato cake and the warm chocolate mochi cake. The space is very nice and plays pleasant enough music at a good volume. You can definitely still converse with your dining partners and makes for a perfect date environment.

I was actually disappointed by the desserts. They were out of almost everything when I visited. (Ok it was at night but not that late...) I got the black sesame Tofu, it was good but not awesome. My fris got cheesecake(so so) and other things that I don't even remember... :( Unfortunately I ?don't think it's worth the price

TOFU Kyotofu's specialty is tofu, so if you want to rate/judge this place, you must try the Artisanal Tofu appetizer. Everything else is kind of secondary in my opinion (the soba, curry, etc). I am not a tofu expert, but I have eaten in tofu specialty restaurants in Japan and also experienced tofu-only kaiseki. I have to say Kyotofu is right up there in terms of taste and quality. I was very impressed. CUPCAKE You're like, "What? How can a tofu place be named as having the Best Cupcakes by the New York Magazine?" I thought the same thing. I checked in through Yelp and got a free chocolate cupcake. I took it home, heated it up, and ate it the next morning. Now I am a believer. It's more a souffl¨¦ than a cupcake (if there were a souffl¨¦-cupcake continuum). It was moist, rich but not heavy (probably because made from soy), and just...amazing. 10/10 for that cupcake.

I wanted to order everything on the menu!!! But we settled on the black sesame sweet tofu, soymilk soft Ice Cream Sundae, and the tofu cheesecake. ALL were yumz! My fave out of the 3 was the black sesame sweet tofu. Such a unique but genius creation! Tasted so smooth and silky, not too sweet...perfection. The tofu cheesecake was interesting but the cream cheese did not overpower the tofu taste. Would definitely go back for more!! Price was also reasonable. Restaurant is small, so expect a line. I don't really like restaurants that have super dim lighting so I would rather sit by the windows next time. Oh, if you check in on yelp, you get a free mochi chocolate cake to go. Rich. Just like how I like my chocolates.

My little world. When I was a child, I was the quietest and nerdiest kid in my class. Once the bell rang, I ran to the library to read books. I like the peacefulness of the library. To a certain extent, the atmosphere of Kyotofu reminded me of the corner of the library that I used to hide. The soft music, the polite waitress and the cute cookies make Kyotofu very welcoming to people like me who enjoy being a quiet place to enjoy their food. My favorite dish at Kyotofu is the mushroom salad. The mushroom is saut¨¦ed just right and its warmness makes the salad extra appetizing. The dressing is neither too heavy nor too salty, which is rare for salads served in restaurants these days. Although the sesame pudding is a bit too sweet for me, it is so rich that I cannot help to order it again and again. According to my friends, the sesame pudding at Kyotofu is quite authentic and they all recommend Yelpers to try it. I would also suggest having the macha (green tea) latte to balance the sweetness of the pudding. The bitter sweetness of the tea complements well with the richness of the pudding. My friends also enjoy the burgers and the noodles at Kyotofu. However, I would not recommend you getting the soup that appears to be too thick. Despite the fact that the portion of the food at Kyotofu is quite small for its price, the service is superb. The waitress is always attentive and is willing to answer your questions. As much as I want to keep my little world to myself, I highly recommend the restaurants to folks who live in Midtown.

I thought the desserts were ALL-RIGHT. ? Their tofu reminded me of the vietnamese/chinese version with the sweet ginger sugar syrup that is served warm. ? This was very similar except it was in NYC in a fancy looking place and cost probably 10x as much.

Holy hell, what a random find! I came here with a group of friends, and we were clearly the oddballs of the place. You walk in and it looks like a fancy drinks place...then get seated in the back where you feel like you walked into someone's date night. We got a bunch of desserts (mostly...) and no one had any complaints about anything they got. I tasted the pumpkin soup (I did say MOSTLY desserts) and it was buttery and pretty bomb. Tasted the ice cream sundae, which was HUGE and also pretty good. I had the black sesame tofu, and it was really good. I liked that the syrup is in a glass to the side so you can configure it to your own taste. =) Service was good, though the waitresses seemed bored mostly. I went up to break a $20 and they didn't have that much in change....which means a lot of people pay in card?? Not sure.

New updated review as 2.12.13 Pros: - Cute intimate atmosphere. - Place looks rather expensive but the prices are reasonable - FREE Wi-Fi - Gluten-Free options - VEGETARIAN & VEGAN meals for lunch/dinner (they have key codes on the menu symbolizing which items are vegetarian & vegan) - ALL Desserts are VEGETARIAN friendly (updated as of 2.12.13) - Delicious desserts and nicely prepared. - You can see desserts prepared in the kitchen by the bakers. - Menu changes regularly per season. - Check-In on Yelp for occasional offers Cons: - Not ideal for groups. Be sure to CHECK-IN on Yelp while you are dining in there to receive your voucher for a FREE cupcake! (not sure how long that offer will last and the voucher is only for when you dine-in only) My updated review since my last visit back in 2009 has made me modify my initial 4 star review to a 5 star experience. Last time I came I only sat in the bar area as the last resort due to the place being crowded on a weekday. This time I actually had the chance to sit in the dining area for the experience on a Tuesday evening. Came here strictly for the dessert menu and everything that I ordered last time didn't seem to exist on the menu. Looks as though they change their menu based on the seasons since the menu said "Winter Menu" on it. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~?~~~~~~~~ From a scale of 1-5 (5 being EXCELLENT) My friend and I ordered.... - Warm Chocolate Mochi Cake / $12.00 ? --- ?Rate it a 5.0 out of 5.0 OMG! The Chocolate Mochi tastes soooooooooooooo good!!! It contains valrhona chocolate, hazelnut mochi, coffee ice cream and vanilla caramel. It was so soft and practically melted in your mouth with each bite! Don't even think about sharing this with someone because it's so good that the selfish side of you will want to come out and play! haha. - Green Tea Creme Br?l¨¦e / $10.00 ? --- ?Rate it a 4.0 out of 5.0 You must LOVE Green Tea if you plan on getting this because this may not be for everyone. It definitely was good, but nothing to die over. It's very rich in flavor that after 2-3 bites, I felt content. I would share this with someone. - Chocolate Soufl¨¦ Cupcake (To-Go) / $3.50 ? --- ?Rate it a 5.0 out of 5.0 This is when "Checking-In" at the places you go to on Yelp comes in handy. We received a pre-packaged chocolate cupcake as a FREE gift just for "Checking In" on Yelp. It's regularly priced at $3.50 each. It was a simple chocolate cupcake that was rated as "New York's Best Cupcake in New York Magazine". Anything FREE is always an automatic 5.0 to me. I can appreciate the gesture. I ate it the next day after popping in the microwave for about 10 seconds. Taste much better warm! I'm not sure how long that voucher will last but it doesn't hurt to check in and see what goodies you get with your experience. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~?~~~~~~~~ The bathroom is a bit small. It reminded me of a bathroom in an airplane due to its narrow set up, but with nicer fixtures and cleaner. The waitresses were very patient and accommodating. We had 2 waitresses that came time to time and even though we just came for desserts they did not treat our service any less than someone next to us who came for dinner. For our 2 desserts and a matcha latte, the price came out to $28.71 for 2 people. I definitely will come back here again...

Very creative desserts at this japanese bakery. Small spot and a bit cramped at the tables but it's a nice after dinner date spot. Wide variety of soy based desserts as this is not your typical bakery or dessert spot but skews towards asian desserts. They have a nice dessert sampler and i'm a fan of the cold tofu desserts with fruit syrups. Also a fan of the green tea macha or chocolate macha cupcakes that is made out of soy! Tastes so good. Also a fan of the black sesame soft serve ice cream. Dishes are artistically plated. I'll be back.

OMG this place was heaven. I haven't ate sweets in a while so while I was on vacation and stopped by here, my sweet tooth was jumping for joy. Everything on their menu looked so delicious and pretty. We got the mochi choclate cake, green tea sorbet with lychee and red beans, and matcha green tea latter. The mochie choclate cake was the best and SO GOOD. If you are a chocolate lover, definately get this! Comes with a fried banana too which balances the sweetness of the chocolate perfectly! While the presenation for the green tea sorbet was very pretty, the dessert itself was so-so. The sorbet was pretty icy and didn't have much of the green tea flavor, and it didn't really go well with the lychee and red beans. The matcha green tea latte was good, definately taste the green tea in that. I wish they had a place like this in the bay area!

I live in the neighborhood and came here through a friends recommendation. I would categorize it as a dessert bar with small plate options and great cocktails. The space is small but very cute. Sometimes it is difficult to get a table because of the space, but I dont usually mind waiting. The only critique that I have to say is that I think they should work on the Entree Menu. There are not that many option and what we had was just okay. We had the Tofu Burger, Curry Rice, and Pork Katsu. All were pretty underwhelming. I would definitely only come back for the desserts and tea selection. I would recommend every single dessert on the menu. All are plated beautifully and are delicious. I love that this place has vegan and gluten-free options as well.

My friend and I came here for dessert only one night. This place really fell short of our expectations. Overall, these desserts are great ideas on paper but the taste is executed well. Green Tea Creme Brulee with orange shiro an, vanilla bean ice cream, and chocolate tuile: Creme brulee should be slightly gelatinous and wobbly but the texture of this was loose and runny like pudding. Excluding the caramelized top, this was literally just green tea pudding). I really wanted this to taste good but it didn't. Signature Sweet Tofu with kuromitsu black sugar syrup and black sesame tuile: This is basically a solid firm version of soy milk. We broke up the black sesame tuille into small pieces and mixed it into the tofu, which added a nice flavor to it. We tried it with a bit of the syrup but the syrup tasted like medicine so we ate the rest sans syrup. Overall, this tasted just okay, nothing special.

It's a bit expensive - but you take a date here, split a dessert and make oogly eyes at each other. ?The Staff is really awesome and they are extremely helpful but give you the right amount attention. ?Not overbearing and not absent It was good i liked it - it's definitely a date spot.

Let me start off by saying I don't go to restaurants for the sole purpose of eating desserts/sweets. However, for New York, I decided to expand my appetite and make an exception.. Kuro goma sweet tofu: (black sesame tofu) http://www.yelp.com/user¡­ Came with sweet dipping sauce, and a thin layer of what tasted like toffee brittle (?). No need for the sweet dipping sauce! It's already slightly sweet on its own and has a smooth, creamy texture.. The boyfriend and I finished this in a couple bites. SO GOOD. Yuzu citus tofu cheesecake: http://www.yelp.com/user¡­ Oh.. my.. If I lived in New York and had a bad day, I would come here. I would come here and eat my sorrows away, then leave feeling 100x better. Maybe I'm exaggerating a little, but who knew desserts could be this good?! This dish came with blueberries; the perfect tart balance to the creamy cheesecake.. Note: They also have a regular menu for food and a drink menu!

This was one of the places I really want to try because it's purely a dessert place. I wanted to love it, but I can't. I tried coming here 45 minutes before closing, but they say they were not accepting customers anymore and will only do take-out. Note: There were seats available, but the guy was very dismissal. I wanted to eat here, so I came with a girlfriend another day, but at a way earlier. The concept is cool and the interior was nice. I really like the back seating area. The presentation of the food was also pretty. But the desserts did not do it for me at all. It was very underwhelming. Both me and my friend, did not finish our desserts (AND WE LOVE DESSERT, note our constant late night dessert runs) We had the .... Green Tea Creme Brulee: possibly the worst creme brulee I ever had, the texture was very runny and not custardy like it's suppose to be. The ice cream was good though. Kuro Goma Sweet Tofu: blahhhh. did not like this one bit. the syrup tasted like cough medicine. tofu was very refreshing but we dumped the sauce not knowing we would hate it. I would give it a two stars, but I only tried two of their desserts, so 3 stars it is. Very mediocre dessert place with nice presentation and atmosphere.

If you're reading this yelp review and you've already been seated then I would recommend going for the signature sweet tofu. ?I had the tasting menu + I would say that was by far the best of the selection. ?The tasting menu is $28 for 2 and I think just isn't worth it. ?The tasting menu starts off with the signature sweet tofu. ?And then green tea creme brulee - I wasn't impressed. ?Tofu cheesecake, which honestly tasted like it had gone bad because it almost had a nasty salty bitter taste. ?Also, almond bread pudding, which was probably the next best thing after the signature sweet tofu. ?Tasting ends with 2 green tea chocolates along with 2 cookies. ?Not worth it. ?If you check in you get a treat to take home. ?This is my 3rd time at kyotofu and I probably won't be coming back for overpriced dessert.

It was a really pleasant experience here. Not bad at all. We only tried their desserts, so I'm more on the cautious side of my rating. We went there on a Saturday around 1:30pm. I guess this place becomes crowded at a much later time because there was only one other couple there when we were there. I'm ok with that =). I like to get seated right away =) I got the Signature Sweet tofu, with the black sugar syrup on the side. If you like tofu desserts, this is definitely a winner. I'm from the Philippines, where we like our tofu warm and sweet right from the street vendor. This is a much fancier version on it. Not warm at all. But because the black sugar syrup comes on the side, you can make it as sweet as you want. Loved it =) My husband got something else that I didn't really taste so I can't really say much about it. It looked pretty though. We also got a free cupcake thanks to yelp deals =). The chocolate cupcake was delicious and oh so moist. Loved it =) So yeah. Not bad at all. The other couple ordered entrees and they looked good too. I may frequent this place when go visit the big apple =)

In my opinion, New York needs more places like Kyotofu. Sure, the concept of Asian-inspired desserts has been done before (Spot, Chikalicious, etc.), but all things considered, there are only a few of these places; variety, as they say, is the spice of life. While Kyotofu does do a variety of savory options, they are known for their desserts, and it's the desserts you should stick to, especially in the first few visits to this location. On a late Friday evening, there weren't too many other customers in sight, so we were quickly seated and given menus. I'm not sure if there are other rooms available as the one we were in was quite small, but it gave off a very lounge-y, almost glitzy, vibe. It's not exactly the best environment to enjoy desserts in, but I decided to allow the desserts to do most of the talking. While Kyotofu does offer an attractive kaiseki option (three courses for 2 people at $28), we decided to order two plates a la carte. The Signature Sweet Tofu was presented in several parts, and our server instructed us on how best to enjoy it. The kuromitsu black sugar syrup is separate from the sweet tofu, allowing you to add as you go and adjust the sweetness to your own liking. In the end, we simply dumped the entire cup into the tofu, but the interactive experience was certainly well-received. Taste-wise, I was delighted with the consistency and lightness of the tofu, and when our spoons struck the near-empty cup at the end, I couldn't help but feel a tinge of remorse. The Warm Chocolate Mochi Cake is a standout in it's own right; I tentatively ordered this despite knowing my own slight aversion to chocolate, but it was nonetheless a very good choice. An elegant plating that featured the cake, topped with coffee ice cream and a tuile, all surrounded by swirls of vanilla caramel and crushed peanuts. The heaviness of the mochi and chocolate cake was balanced perfectly with the coffee ice cream; it was more of a mousse than an ice cream, in hindsight. Unsurprisingly, the two of us were almost fighting at the end for the last few bites of dessert. I'm more than happy to add Kyotofu to my list of reputable dessert places. It's suitable for a variety of occasions and groups, and the options for dessert seem appealing to almost any palate.

After sharing a nice Ethiopian meal, my friend was in pursuit of chocolate cake. I checked my Yelp app and while I suspected her concept might not meld with an establishment whose mission is to promote artisanal tofu, this place sounded promising enough. Better than promised. The place was tiny but we were seated promptly on a Saturday night around 9pm in the back room -- white padded bench seating are set along the walls with small tables. The Husband ordered the stunning warm chocolate mochi cake ($12) while my friend and I shared the three-course chef's choice ($28). Could I even discern the waiter's mumble and know what I'd be getting? Did it matter? This is not your old-country mother's bean curd, but rich, satisfying, moist, never cloying, and bridging Western and Eastern palates without the caloric density that makes you feel regretfully leaden after you eat it. The sampling included the warm sweet potato cake (which I liked far more than I anticipated), coconut-infused creme brulee, yuzu citrus-flavored cheesecake and items I can't even recall but I photographed because they were of course artistically arrayed. The tea menu is also extensive. I feel bereft that there isn't a place like this in the Bay Area. And yes, I managed to remember in my dessert stupor to check in and got the cupcake to go, which I handed to my friend -- not chocolate cake, but a mighty fine alternative.

Overall: Mixed feelings about this place... could be 3.5 stars? Background: went there for desserts with a friend at around 9pm on a Friday. There are a lot of things I liked about the place: -cute atmosphere -interesting presentation of the dessert and cool concept -no wait -free gluten free cupcake with yelp/foursquare check-in ;) But sadly, I did not really enjoy the desserts we got lol (btw, I normally love desserts)... We had the sesame sweet tofu and green tea creme brulee, which were supposed to be good. It could be a personal taste thing, so definitely think you should at least go and try it out. Perhaps it's for you?

My friend and I split the warm chocolate mochi cake, which was delicious and unique. I also had the matcha latte which was good but nothing too special. The tables here are quite close together, but overall the atmosphere is cute for couples with its low lighting and two person tables. The service was quick, but they failed to give us a drink menu until we asked for it. I also got the free chocolate cupcake with the Yelp check in, which was one of the best cupcakes I've ever had! It was dense, moist, super chocolate-y and just blew me away. I would go here just to get one of those cupcakes again.

Kyotofu features beautiful soy based desserts that never fails to please the palette. ? My wife and I have visited Kyotofu for the last 4 years as our go to dessert place for friends visiting the city and special occasions. ?I came here a few nights ago and ordered the green tea creme brulee with Japanese cream soda, the pairing turned out to be perfect as I was not in the mood for sake. ?The sake menu is extensive and there are suggested pairings for each dessert. I find the the spacing is warm and classy with a japanese minimalism that is unique compared to the interior design of other restaurants. The sampler is a great way to taste the menu however it's strange to have a sampler for 2 and have the second course just be one item of each on a plate, I guess it would be great for dates and you can have the the cosy feel of sharing, friends sharing the order would be awkward. The menu changes between winter and summer for one or two items. ? We usually see other couples on dates and they like to order sliders and sake. ?We tend to eat elsewhere and come here just for desserts just because their meals don't look big enough. Come here for desserts and maybe we'll see you there some day.

Ambiance: 4 [Perfect for couples though, but not very good for friends] Service: 3 [Honestly, they weren't very friendly, nor did they look very happy] Desserts: Mindblown *Sploosh* Price: TT_TT Get the Green Tea Brulee or the Warm Chocolate Mochi Cake. Both are ridiculously good. Overpriced, yes. I know its New York, but $12 for a slice of cake is insane. T~T Just barely worth it.

I think this place is a little overrated. The concept is a good one and there's nothing like it in Hell's Kitchen, however, the food just didn't do it for me. Bento box - tasty but I can cook this at home. you are talking about mainly sausages and rice. Desserts - can't compare to Spot, another Japanese dessert place at East Village, which I thought was worth going to but even that's not superb. Sake - a sake cocktail menu and a long sake list but, honestly who drinks sake at a dessert place?

The desserts are yummy here. I had the green tea creme brulee and the warm mochi chocolate cake! I read several reviews on yelp about how the green tea creme brulee isn't that good, but I wanted to try it anyway and I loved it! I like how the desserts aren't too sweet but just sweet enough to give you a good amount of flavor. It makes me feel less guilty ordering more. Also, the presentation of the desserts are so pretty. The mochi chocolate cake was really good, it came with ice cream which complemented the cake really well! The tables are really close to each other, so yes, you can hear everything the people on the next table is talking about. I sat in between two different couples who were both arguing with each other.

We will definitely come back here again!! The desserts were amazing. I had the chocolate mochi cake, which was mind-blowing! This, coming from someone who has had A LOT of chocolate cakes at some great places! I also tried my friend's green tea creme brulee. I typically don't actually like creme brulee, but this one had a very unique flavor that I loved. We shared some ice cream too, which was tasty and felt lighter than regular ice cream, so didn't leave us feeling overstuffed. Five stars!!

Make reservations or expect to wait for at least an hour before you get seated (during prime dinner hours). This place is too small for their own good. Tables are too close and in order to get to the inside seats they have to pull the table out, so it can get a little weird if you have to go to the bathroom during dinner. That said, I think this place is overrated. Don't get me wrong the food tastes amazing but I find that it is too expensive for what you get. Bonus cookies come with the check.

Very cute little Japanese dessert place. It definitely reminded me of Chikalicious with the presentation and ambiance. Only difference is that Kyotofu serves food. We came here for desserts after dinner and had the prefix. It came with the sweet tofu for the first course; green tea crem brulee, warm sweet potato cake and the warm chocolate mochi cake; and the third course came with a chocholate chip cookie and a white chocolate cube with melted peppermint on top. Size of the desserts were very small also like Chika. I am guessing alot of their desserts are glutten free/made of tofu. Over all it was really good. ?I would like to come back to try some food next time. BTW - I checked in here and got a free cupcake at the end.

Came here a few times before. ?Not too big on the food as it is nothing special but they have very creative desserts. ?Many soy, vegan and gluten free options. They even have soymilk soft serve for the lactose intolerant! Warm Chocolate Mochi Cake - Favorite. ?The ice cream on top (coffee i think) is delicious! Soymilk Soft Ice Cream - nice and creamy like regular soft serve. ?Wish they had a wider variety of flavors. Black Sesame Tofu - ?Tastes just like the chinese sesame paste/soup dessert but much lighter. Sweet Tofu - Very tender tofu dessert but nothing too unique. chocolate souffle cupcake - least favorite. ?Unlike the average cupcake it has no frosting. ?The cake itself I found dry and lacking in rich chocolate flavor. They also have a good selection of drinks: teas, sake, wine, etc. There is a bakery up front where you can buy things for home like cookies and brownies and coffee. Place is small so it isn't very good for groups and the wait can be a while at prime dining time.

Had the Black Sesame Sweet Tofu and Green Tea Creme Brulee, both delicious! I thought that the green tea creme brulee for example would only have a touch of green tea taste like other places and was pleasantly surprised. Both desserts are balanced well and full of taste.

Discovered this place while on the prowl for cute date spots in the city. Considering its prime spot in Hell's Kitchen, we opted to hit up another place for dinner first and then came back here for dessert. Having arrived at six, we were lucky enough not to have to wait (score!), but unlucky enough to be shoved into a tiny little table between to a bunch of fobby Asians, who gave us dirty looks as we squeezed in beside them, and the wall. We ignored them and went ahead to order the Kaiseki prix fixe menu which, at $28 is no small change, so we were counting on Yelp to pull through here. The first course was some kind of black sesame flan. Served in two tiny little goblets, it had an extremely strong flavor that I immediately found off-putting. My boyfriend really liked it, though, and gulped down both our helpings. Next up was a trio of "seasonal desserts": yuzu cheesecake, some sort of chocolate cupcake, and a pumpkin creme brulee. The former is probably best described as "interesting" -- you don't generally expect cheesecake to be citrusy, and it ends up tasting just as weird as it sounds. The chocolate cupcake was pretty much like a brownie bite -- not a hint of tofu flavor at all. The creme brulee, however, saved the night: nice and crispy on top, deliciously smooth below, with just the right amount of pumpkin spice. Yum! The last course was a plain old mini chocolate chip cookie -- hard and dry, like a Famous Amos (it might well have been for all I know) -- and two green tea chocolate triangles, which were pretty dece. Overall, not worth $28, but still a cute and intriguing spot. Didn't really taste any tofu, though... maybe that's the point?

Was working late and was looking for a place to have dinner when we found this cute little place in hell's kitchen. I love eating healthy! We ordered the soba noodles (yummy, super light with a good balance of green tea flavor) and mac and cheese (decent, wasn't too heavy). ?For dessert, we ordered the soymilk soft ice cream sundae which had seasonal flavors of peppermint and eggnog. Nice and creamy, tasted ok. ?Food portions were just right for a light dinner. Overall good experience. Great place to have a birthday or get-together for a small party. It is definitely a place I would come back to.

I've been here many times, and it's one of my favorite restaurants in Manhattan. ?You could close your eyes and point randomly at the menu, and the selection would be delicious--everything is good. ?Desserts are a must, but do also try the savory dishes. ?Homemade tofu is luscious. ?The mac and cheese is not as heavy as at other places, and the chicken and tofu hamburger balances substance and lightness. ?We just had a 3 course meal here and left very satisfied but not overstuffed. I am also very happy with the service. ?For example, the waitress did not put in one of our entree orders, so to correct it, they gave us a free chocolate cake, unsolicited. On Sundays, it's half off sake carafes.

I don't like sweets. I don't like eating healthy. ?I do like kyotofu. Pricing is modest for a sit-own dessert place but it has the feel of something that is much more pretentious. ?But then you realize the menu is kinda specialty in Soy and Vegan audience aimed. ?Makes sense for the neighborhood. ? BUT YOU MUST CHECK IN. ?The free cupcake that comes with a Yelp Check-In was the best I've ever had. ?The actual dessert itself was good but I've had better.

More like 4.5. What was amazing? Being a desert bar is always a one-up on just a plain bakery. If you check-in, they give you a free chocolate cupcake that is incredibly moist. Kyotofu ?is so creative because they make all their own tofu and incorporate it into all their desserts while keeping the treat's integrity and bringing it to a higher level. What could have been better? I was disappointed by the green tea dessert which was lacking in the matcha flavor. Also, the creme brulee isn't has soft as it could be. Perhaps its because of the tofu. A bit expensive as well but definitely worth the treat!

I've been coming here for years and I'm always surprised, I love this place! Their Chocolate Souffl¨¦ Cupcakes were voted as New York's Best Cupcake but forget that! Today lets talk about something... something I never would even think about having an association to regarding Kyotofu, Sake. I ordered a Sake Flight which included 3 different sakes as well as a plate of their homemade sliders. I'm going to post a picture of the Sake tasting. Now I remember James Bond saying back in the day: "I like Sake. Especially when it's served at the correct temperature, 98.4 degrees Fahrenheit, like this is." James Bond is an old a-hole. No! What I was served was cold Sake. That's right, cold. So call me 008 baby because its supposed to be cold. The cheap ass hooch that he drank needed to be warm, the good stuff? Its like a fine wine and will be served chilled. So take that Octopussy! And the sliders?Great tiny brioche buns with both pulled pork and tofu cutlets. Really, really good. What I noticed on here for next time is their Sake braised pork belly as well the Kyotofu mac & cheese. Do you want a nice twist for dinner? Well, now you've been schooled. 008 out

Well now, if you're looking for an amazing dessert place in Hell's Kitchen, let alone Midtown, then look no further. Kyotofu is amazing, and it's here to stay. Now I'm familiar with these Japanese dessert spots with multiple courses with my multiple visits to Chikalicious. Kyotofu is an amazing alternative, and best of all, there's way more seating inside. Before you decide to walk in on a Friday night and have some amazing dessert, please call ahead and make a reservation. I've come here before, only to be turned away because of the wait, so it really helps to play ahead. Kyotofu is tucked away right on 9th Ave, between 48th and 49th. Surrounded by all the bars and Thai restaurants, Kyotofu offers something that nothing else in Hell's Kitchen can offer; an amazing dessert experience. Now, when I came here, I actually had a small dinner, and the dessert. I was actually pleasantly surprised with their actual food entrees, as I didn't expect them to be anything out of the ordinary. For starters, we decided to go with the House Sliders, Sake Braised Pork Belly, Tiger Shrimp Croquette, and the Kyotofu Mac and Cheese. Right off the bat, the ones to get are the Tiger Shrimp Croquette, and the Sake Braised Pork Belly. Both were cooked to perfection, and just had an amazing amount of flavor. Now, onto the dessert. I purchased this Gilt City pre-fixe dessert for two, so I had a little bit of everything. On our menu was the Green Tea Creme Brulee, Yuzu Citris Tofu Cheesecake, Warm Chocolate Mochi Cake, and I believe the Sweet Potato Cake. I might be a little biased, but I loved the cheesecake. With a nice seasonal twist, Kyotofu was able to make me love the cheesecake in a new way. With a nice light fluff to it, compounded with an large amount of flavor, this and the other desserts, and simply amazing. Kyotofu also has a decent selection of sake and a mild selection of beer. This place isn't by any means cheap, so don't look to come here and walk away with a meal under $50 per person, but if you live in Manhattan, then you're totally used to paying a smooth $50+ per meal. Say you want to skip the dinner and go straight for the dessert? Then you have an amazing selection of Thai food, as well as the equally amazing Totto Ramen just a mere two blocks away. Treat yourself, and make a visit to Kyotofu.

Tight seating. Way too tight seating. It's like that episode of Curb Your Enthusiam. You know, the one with the really tight seating. Inspiring menu, but some dishes fall short. Case in point, the pork belly is way too sweet. My watermelon cocktail was way too sweet as well. However, the service is nice, some dishes are quite inspired, and it's a cool looking place.

Kyotofu is famed for its delightful desserts, but its savory food is also worth a try. The cha soba noodles are so good, with a nice, light broth. The mac and cheese is very rich, almost too heavy. The signature sweet tofu w/ sakura sauce is soooo smooth and lovely, it's a must try. The green match creme brulee is also a hit, a nice balance between the creaminess of creme brulee and green tea goodness. The warm chocolate cake is decent, but not as interesting or different as the other desserts. The tofu cheesecake is an interesting idea, but the texture doesn't quite work for me. The sparkling sake came with my dessert tasting menu, it was a really clean, smooth sake and something I would maybe order again on my own. Kyotofu seems like a nice place for a date or a small group, but the limited seating makes it difficult for larger parties.

Food: 2 stars Dessert: 4 Service: 2 Lunch ambiance and service were not welcoming, very loud rock music, sharing a dining room with staff packing cookies with cold service....it wasn't a nice experience! Omakase Bento Box was not worth the price. I will go to Ootyoa for a fantastic lunch for the same. Come only for interestingly delicious desserts. For lunch, stick to the counter sold items and sit by the window. 2 Bento box, 2 dessert and 2 sparkling water for $71

This review is only for dessert. I work nearby; can't believe I forgot about this place! ?Came in with a party of 4, no reservation. ?We thought we'd take our chances seeing that we had finished dinner early, until I realized they serve food as well! ?We lucked out and a table opened up after a few minutes. ?Our waiter was pleasant and patient, and answered all our questions about the menu. ?I can see how it's comparable to Chickalicious, and probably Spot too. We ordered the following: Warm Chocolate Mochi Cake - Good. ?Loved the coffee ice cream, although the consistency is more of a topping. Black Sesame Tofu: Good. Nice and light, but not too sweet. Sweet Tofu: Ok, but nothing too exciting. Soymilk Soft Ice Cream: Interesting, pretty good. ?(I've never had soymilk ice cream before, so I have nothing to compare it to) *The (tofu) syrup and (ice cream) toppings come on the side. ?A plus for making it as sweet as you want. Adding a round of drinks, we were happy people! ?I happened to like the music playing at the time (Smashing Pumpkins, Keane, etc). ?Interested to come back and try the food. Nice plus - Checking in on Foursquare/Yelp, we walked out with a free cupcake!

Been to this place twice and both times I've really enjoyed it. Really like the decor of the place once you walk in to the seating area.

On the pricey side but the desserts are quite unique and delicious. I recommend steering away from the traditional-sounding desserts, such as anything chocolate (if you happen to have a chocolate craving sate it somewhere else beforehand, your wallet will thank you). I urge you to try something a bit more radical. Come here to venture new treats! Be prepared to bask in the glory of delicious tofu desserts, it'll intrigue your tastebuds if you have never tried.

PROs: + Delicious and beautifully presented food. We ordered the black sesame tofu (kuro goma) with hoji-cha syrup and green tea creme brulee. Both were really great, though I'm not really a fan of black sesame to begin with. Both had creamy textures without grittiness. Honestly, I couldn't taste the hoji-cha syrup with the tofu, but it might've been because I had too much of the creme brulee first. Two desserts were good enough to share between four people. + Classy decor. Nice sofas, tables, couches, clientele, lol. + Accessible location in Hell's Kitchen. CONs: - Too dim and crowded. I guess it depends on the ambiance you're going for, but the dimness just made me feel even more crowded in. Tables were so close together... - Took forever to get our bill, though they were good about refilling water. Definitely a great place though and worth checking out; three stars for A-OK.

This is place is very small/cozy with great atmosphere for quite an intimate dinner or after dinner drinks/dessert. That being said, with it's increasing popularity, depending on when you come- seating can be hard to obtain! Have been here on 3 occasions now and each time- there's been something different in store for us as they change their dessert menu on quite a regular basis depending on season. Being a HUGE fan of Japanese desserts- which are more focused on creamy and subtle sweetness. I love to see ingredients such as matcha green tea, black seasame, mochi, soy and of course TOFU!! Their Sake Braised Pork Belly is also a favorite of mine...you simply can't go wrong with pork belly! The dinner/apps menu is more of a staple, but still changes slightly with the varying seasons. This leaves an element of surprise with each visit.

Came here after a very disappointing dinner at Firebird. We came here and tried their Mac and cheese, green tea creme brulee, and Kuro Goma Sweet Tofu. The mac and cheese was pretty good. ?The panko gave it a slight crisp to the top of the mac and cheese. ?Usually the top is kind of burnt. ?But the use of the panko was creative and it didn't burn the top of the cheese. ?It does have a little kick to it from the spice shichimi. ?It's just enough spice. ?If you can't handle spicy food, you can definitely handle this. The green tea creme brulee had a very strong green tea flavor which I liked. ?Most green tea things don't have enough green tea flavor in it, but this was an exception. ?It's a good thing that there was ice cream on the side, it helped to cut the green tea flavor and to balance the dish. ?The granola helped too. ?Definitely worth trying. Last thing we tried was the sweet tofu. ?Good thing I suggested to try this last because it is really sweet. ?If we had tried this first, we wouldn't have tasted anything in the creme brulee. ?The hoji-cha syrup gets a little getting used to. ?It's not just a sweet syrup. ?I would say it's an acquired taste. ?We just poured it over the tofu and scooped it out. ?I wouldn't recommend "destroying" the tofu into little pieces. ?The sesame tuile flavor is quite strong but it adds to the dish. ?Tofu itself is also mildly sweet if you can taste it. ?I would recommend this dish. I would definitely recommend this place. ?It's a nice dessert place. ?They do have some main course dishes that I do plan to try out towards the end of December. ?I will update the review then. ?For now, 4 stars. ?If the food can impress me, they might ?be one of the few dessert places that deserves a 5 star from me. One thing that made my experience that much better was that when we asked for the check, we told them to add the cost of one of the small bakery bags that they sell. ?They had forgotten to add in the price and when we told them about it they said it was on the house. ?That was really generous of them. ?I appreciate the good gesture. ?In return, we gave them the cost of that item and then some in tips =D Service was excellent. ?The staff is very friendly.

It's a nice place to take a friend or two. Pretty tight seating. Kinda loud sometimes with music and people next to you talking a lot. You find a lot of Asian-American women in their 20s and 30s hanging out here and getting dessert. The tofu dessert stuff is all pretty and fancy but the taste leaves a little to be desired.

Sorry to be a little vulgar, but the black sesame tofu is the exact definition of orgasm in your mouth. JUST DIVINE. While waiting for the ridiculous 2-hour line at Totto Ramen, I decided to yelp what was around and found this cute little joint with 4 stars and thought, might as well give it a shot. There was also a line at the door, but the tofu desserts are all pre-made and pre-packaged so you can just grab it to-go. The black sesame tofu comes delicately packaged with sugar syrup on the side for you to add into the tofu. At the first bite, I was mind blown. I really wasn't expecting a passing-time dessert to taste so damn good, but it was more than I've ever expected. The tofu was so creamy and soft, and the black sesame flavor was seeped into every bite, creating a kind of perfection that words cant even describe. Not too heavy and not too sweet, this was the best way to start my night. P.S. When you check in on yelp, you get a coupon for 50% off sake!

sake-braised pork belly - 4.5 stars! A bit on the salty side as some other reviewers pointed out. Otherwise tender, flavorful, delicious! black sesame tofu - 3 stars. I'd been super excited about this dessert but the actual thing didn't really stand out to me? It was good, sure, but there wasn't anything spectacular about it. Maybe I'm just not a tofu-as-dessert sort of person. I kept thinking back to the black sesame creme brulee at Cha-An instead. price - 2 stars. Okay, I knew this coming into the restaurant, but still. Not sure the meal warranted the hefty price tag.

Everything was ok. It was honestly fine. That was the biggest problem. Paul H. and I came for a dessert tasting. I was crazy excited. I honestly couldn't wait to get my dessert on. The soft tofu was great. It was silky and very easy to eat. Paul was champ and drank it like a shot. It was downhill from there. Nothing was mind-blowing. For a place that specializes in tofu, I was hoping for a more tofu-centric menu. This place warrants a 3 star but that dropped to a 2 start when we were hit with a 20% gratuity charge. Seriously. I've seen mandatory gratuity charges when there's a larger party but it was the two of us and the waiter wasn't really present.

One of my favorite dessert spots in New York City! My husband found out about this place as he was busily Yelp-ing for a dessert spot after our dinner at Room Service. He didn't really explain to me about the place but told me that he is pretty sure that I'll love it--and yepp, he was right! Majority of their dessert items are made from tofu (obviously from their name...) so I feel less guilty about indulging all the yummy-ness from Kyotofu. I haven't tried their dinner or brunch items but will one day return to try them. My recommendation: ?Green tea cream brulee (AMAZING! Please get it!). I actually didn't really like their cupcakes and won't get it again. Their ice creams and sorbets are yummy!! Side Notes: Kyotofu have seasonal menus---what you may be see now, you won't see them again until next season. If you have a big appetite for desserts, you should get the prix fixe menu for two which allows you to taste three desserts of chef's choice ($28). OH and yes, there may be a wait as there is limited seating. Price: $$$ (small portion and bit pricey)

My sister was in the city for the night, so I took her out to Kyotofu~ We didn't have a reservation for Thursday night, but we were seated in about five minutes. I ordered the Kuro Goma Sweet Tofu ($9) and it was DIVINE. It's perfect for people who don't like overly sweet desserts. Very nutty in taste and the texture was panna cotta PURRRRRFECTION. My sister got the soymilk ice cream sunday ($9) and she LOVED it. The flavor was pumpkin spice, and it came with three accompaniments (sour cherries - blehhhhh we didn't care for it, brownie bites - looks and tastes kinda like charcoal, and butterscotch caramel - ZOMG I WOULD RIP OFF MY CLOTHES AND LATHER IN IT). We also shared an iced matcha latte ($4) which was standard, but was a nice ending to our dessert fest. The check came with two mini shortbread cookies which my sister said tasted like dog food, but I didn't mind them~

Get a free cupcake when you check in on Yelp! WAHOO, I love free things :) Came here to try the famous desserts, and wow, they are so good. Pricey, but the food really is good. 1. Sake pork belly - So good. Expensive though, so I'd maybe share it with another person. Then again, I just like pork belly...haha 2. Black sesame tofu - What an interesting concept, and wow it tasted so good. 3. Cream puffs - My friend ordered some, and I tried one of the flavors. It was aight. I would try some of their signature desserts though like the tofu and pork belly. I'd recommend coming here with a bunch of friends so you guys can order a variety of things and you can try a bit of everything. After all, your wallet is not going to be super happy. Haha. But your stomach will! The restaurant is really small with not so many seats, so I'd come here on an off-night or during the day if possible. The service is not that great. Oh well!

OVERRATED!! ?Seriously, I was never this disappointed and unsatisfied. ?So bad that I didn't even want to claim my check in offer for a gluten free cupcake!! After reading a few reviews and looking at some pictures I was super duper excited to try this place. ?I was fooled. ?Really... 4 stars? ?NO WAY! I had the mac & cheese, I really liked the top part of it. ?It was light and crunchy. ?But boy it was drenched in oil as you go deeper into the the dish. ?My bf ordered the chicken and tofu burger. ?It was O-K, for some reason the patty tasted like fish to me... ?Seriously, they were just typical food with an OK taste. ? ? O-M-G, what's all the hype about their desserts being the "best", "fantastic", "savory" ?????!!!!!! Please explain! We ordered their so called infamous greentea creme brulee and fall anmitsu. ?Yes I must say their presentations are pretty but the combinations DO NOT go well with each other! ?They should just sell greentea creme brulee on its own, the orange shiro an with the vanilla icecream on top of the chocolate tuile was disgusting. ?The creme brulee was OK, did not top the greentea creme brulee at Qi. ?Omg, the fall anmitsu, WTH is that shit? ?Did the mac and cheese ruin my taste buds? ?Holy cramp, I can't even describe the awful taste in words. ?Red bean and sorbet DO NOT taste good together! ?Ugh and those chewy mochi like things were gross. Two stars are for the portion and presentation. Thank god I had a mollys cupcake before coming here. ?Because I would seriously drag my bf to go to Spot dessert bar to fix my desserts cravings.

Came here on a Tuesday night, but since it was post-hurricane Sandy we had to wait for about 20 minutes for us to be seated. This place is small, so it felt really crammed when we sat at the bar. We got the sesame tofu and the green tea creme brulee. Both were really good, but I am a huge fan of the sesame tofu. The creme brulee was a bit too thick in my opinion. I've also tried the three course tasting menu and was a BIG BIG fan.

My friend and I missed our desired showing of Skyfall so we decided to check this place out after it showed up on a Facebook feed. I had some qualms going here at first, as I wanted a meal instead of dessert plus, but one quick scan of the menu made me wait the 5 minutes for our table. ?Even though it was a Friday night, this place was only half full (albeit it was a pretty cold outside). I ordered the curry with a hard boiled egg which was a bit on the salty side and seemed a little too sparse for $11. ? The highlight of the meal was the trio of cream puffs I felt obligated to order because the place was billed as a dessert cafe. ?I downed the vanilla and chocolate cream puffs perfunctorily. ?Then WHAM the strawberry cream puff was outstanding. ?I've never had a strawberry one before and somehow they got the strawberry flavor just right. ?It seemed like I was eating strawberry puree instead of cream! I hung around a bit at the prep/baking station to see if I could see how they made the strawberry cream puffs, but alas no dice. ?Next time I'll try to use my non-existent Japanese to tease out the recipe.

Finally got my boy in here and he was pleasantly surprised!! Front area is a small little dessert bar and is always crowded. I think this was one of the deterrents from coming in here sooner! I just discovered they have a small little dining room in the back which is much nicer. Although you should be prepared to sit very close to strangers on busy nights. I'm not a big girl by any means, but the pair next to us had to scoot their table for me to squeeze my booty through! lol. Anyways.. I love that they are open til 130am! I came in around 1230a on a Saturday and it was packed! We left a little after one and by then there were only a few other patrons left. Our waitress was super friendly, nice. and had no qualms offering her opinion. ? There menu is great and very clearly marked with certain items being vegan and or gluten free. All the desserts are vegetarian!!! =) Love that! Even the regular food menu looked tasty and I will definitely be making my way back in to try more! Green Tea Creme Br?l¨¦e - I freaking love this!!! I am a green tea dessert fanatic! This is not necessarily like your traditional creme br?l¨¦e. It would be better described as a cold rich green tea pudding topped with a crunchy sugar layer.. Oooo man.. it soooo amazing!! I could eat a huge vat of this green tea pudding!!! The dish also comes w a little vanilla ice cream on the side and a crunchy wafer thing. Black Sesame tofu panna cotta dish - Came in a pretty glass. Served with a tea flavored simple syrup for you to pour on top to sweeten the tofu custard. Texture was somewhere in between a light moose and jello. It has a great but not overpowering black sesame flavor and the syrup adds a ?the perfect little amount of sweetness! Remember to just add a little bit at a time since the custard doesn't absorb it. Different than your typical dessert, but soo good!! Mini cupcakes - Got the sampler, they are actually mini muffins.. I don't think anything qualities as a cupcake if it doesn't have frosting! Either way they were tasty little bites! I preferred the green tea and the almond cookie ones. The chocolate and the other one were a little bland. They have a pretty large selection of teas which look tasty too. I just prefer to make mine at home. Can't Wait to try everything on the menu!!!

Kyotofu is a hidden dessert gem in Hells kitchen. The first time I went there the waiter pleasantly surprised us with a free dessert. No apparent reason why, but just a random act of kindness and deliciousness on a cold fall day. The standout of kyotofu is its green tea Creme br?l¨¦e, although I may be biased because I love anything that's green tea flavored (don't judge me). The second time I went there I took my parents as part of the see-how-cool-new-York-is tour. It was late at night and the tables were pretty packed but for whatever reason the service was a bit slower than usual. As a compensation....MORE FREE DESSERT! My parents and I almost had to struggle to finish the three delicious desserts (which of course now blur Into oblivion). I've been there one time since and alas, no more free dessert. But you do always Get a tasty additional snack with the check. Mini green tea cupcakes with red bean frosting yummm! Kyotofu is the greatest satisfaction for your Asian themed dessert cravings. Be prepared for experimental takes on the the desserts you think you know! Highly recommend for anyone in the area. One star off for the price of desserts and slight inconsistency in service. Standard by NYC prices but my small-town self still cringes every time I drop $10 for a dessert, no matter how delicious.

Do you ever wish you could go to a place with delicious dinner food, creative cocktails, and actually interesting desserts? Do you find yourself looking for places where the server DOESN'T stiffen when everyone shares everything? (I hate that, stop judging us.) Do you secretly wish Yelp has an option for popular places with good ambiance where they won't rush you to leave, so you can actually enjoy the meal? This is THAT place. Perfect for a girls night out or date night, Kyotofu could not have impressed me more. From our croquette appetizers to the light and mildly spicy Mac and cheese to the pomegranate mojito (2-for-1 happy hour until 8) to the chef's choice three course dessert menu (the yuzu tofu cheesecake and signature sweet tofu were highlights, disappointed by the green tea creme br?l¨¦e), our meal was made to perfection. Our lovely server even brought out a separate mochi chocolate cake and pear ginger sorbet (AMAZING!) to sing to the birthday girl! How sweet! With the yelp check-in [NY mag's best (gluten free) cupcakes] + happy hour + birthday desserts, we saved more than 40% off the bill (!!!)... And the entire time, our server was a doll! She was gracious, patient, attentive, and so accommodating! I almost didn't want to leave. Even though we ate so much & I was really full, the food was so light that I felt like I could eat the night away. Dangerous. Anyways, I miss you already, Kyotofu. I'm coming back soon. Like tmrw.

The desserts at Kyotofu are almost universally excellent. As someone who isn't the biggest fan of tofu, I'm surprised I enjoyed them as much as I did. The savory food is quite far from excellent. The deals are shockingly good. $30 for several courses of dessert and sparkling sake for two people is a steal. The service is shockingly bad. Perhaps it is because we sat at the bar lining the front window, but M and I didn't have anyone come to take our orders for almost thirty minutes. Perhaps the staff thought we were just people watching? In any case, it's rather silly that we sat in full view of several waiters and waitresses and were not checked on for that amount of time. Yet in reflection, it's hard to be terribly put off, because the desserts are worth the frustrations. As an alumna of Daniel and Spice Market, Ritsuko Yamaguchi's pedigree could easily speak for itself. However, it has no need to. One need only see the meticulous presentation of her masterwork, the Signature Sweet Tofu. Tofu chilled in a miniature martini glass, coated in a layer of what looks like molasses but isn't, a semi submerged dried apricot cresting like the tip of an iceberg. Sweet tofu lives up to its name, condensed as it is into an astonishingly ethereal solid, ambrosial, not saccharine. The kuromitsu, or 'black honey' is a syrup as complex as molasses but without the same viscosity. Together they are a match made in heaven. Equally good is the Kuro Goma Sweet Tofu. Hoji cha, a tea roasted over coal in a process originating in Kyoto, is an ingenious inclusion beyond the obvious Kyotofu tie-in. The slightly smoky bitterness gained from the roasting process, when streaked through the tofu and combined with the black sesame tuile, provide the perfect foil to the delicate soy based sweetness. Ms. Yamaguchi's skillful contrasts are not limited to within a specific item, but work from dish to dish as well. Warm sweet potato cake is dense, crumbly, and earthy. The sweet potato caramel and creme fraiche ice cream serve to moisten the affair, but the cake is nearly as good without either of them. Then, a nibble of spiced pecan finds its way to your next spoonful, and you understand each element's inclusion. The fall anmitsu reminds you that winter is coming, pairing ingredients at the end of their seasons, like pomegranate and green apple with the surprising kiwi sorbet. The textural differences among them are noticeable, but can be subtle, especially as the sorbet melts, rendering the dish more of a slurry of oddities, though hunting for and discerning each can be amusing. However, not every dessert is as peerless. The yuzu tofu cheesecake lacks the tang of a real cheesecake, and no amount of yuzu will make up for that. The accompanying almond meringue is likewise a bit too delicate to be appreciated as 'almond'. ?The pumpkin creme brulee was in a similar vein, though a slight bit more present in its taste. The warm chocolate mochi cake was positively rife with hazelnut, and the ice cream dotted with chocolate and cocoa nibs it came wedged under was like a frozen glass of milk to wash it down. The petit fours, in our case, cookies and milk macarons and a matcha pastry dusted in powdered sugar, were wonderful as well. To boot, each of these items paired eerily well with our sole glasses of sparkling sake we each received. The parting cupcakes we were given on our departure were not quite as exemplary, especially the day after. That said, I'm glad that mine didn't survive the trip home. Kyotofu should not be considered a proper restaurant. On those grounds, it is merely average. But in the arena of desserts, it is unparalleled. Few out-of-the-way places in New York are truly worth the trek. Kyotofu is one of them.

I had to update my review because of my most recent experiences at Kyotofu. First, they have the most delicious chocolate muffin I have ever eaten in my life. It is incredibly moist and has just the right ratio of chocolate chips to cake. Second, I like the soymilk soft serve more and more every time I eat it. It is so delicious and there are always different flavors to try. Last but not least, the most recent time I went to Kyotofu, I had come down with the most painful migraine of my life just a few minutes before dinner. The server must have noticed how terrible I looked, because he brought over some onigiris for Chinh T. and me, on the house, which he thought would help me feel better as I ate my mushroom salad. He asked if I were feeling sick, and when I admitted I wasn't feeling well, he asked if I wanted to drink some broth instead. I nodded in agreement, expecting just some warm soup, but he brought over an entire soba for me to eat and also said it was on him. I honestly would not even expect a boyfriend to be so attentive and thoughtful. This is by far the best service I have ever received from any establishment in my life and another reason that Kyotofu is one of my favorite places in the city.

Decor: 3/5 -Enough seating for about 40 people -Open kitchen but not in a convenient place where you can sit and watch Service: 0.5/5 -I made a reservation for 9/01/12 on 08/11/12 and got a confirmation email. When I told the hostess I had a reservation, she couldn't find it. -The service was decent but nothing out of the ordinary. -My glass of sake wasn't the cleanest but the server saw me and offered me another. -I had a Google Offers and Kyotofu charged us 20% gratuity for party of 2. I don't mind tipping but a mandatory 20% deserves a star taken away Dessert: 3/5 -Sparkling sake was mild and sweet -Vanilla sweet tofu w/ syrup was my favorite. The tofu was soft and syrup wasn't too sweet -Tofu cheesecake was the best of the next set. Matcha green tea creme bruelee was .. interesting. The miso chocolate cake looked burnt but was moist and soft -Matcha green tea chocolate was just like fudge. -Cupcake was moist and soft but had a weird after-taste that I couldn't associate with another food.

Came after a Broadway show since Milkbar closes at 11pm. ?No wait so a plus. Waited about 15 minutes until finally someone and we asked about the kaiseki (for 2). The waiter literally was screaming while explaining the dishes since the music was super loud. ?And the ?he pushed us to get 2 additional dessert in addition to the kaiseki. He left and we again had to wait another 5 minutes before he finally took out order. Not once they refill our water. ? The pumpkin cremebulle was my favorite. the chocolate Mochi was a little dry and the yuzu cheesecake was good but not mindblowing. ?It's average dessert but presented beautifully. ? Music is loud and they kick you out so not exactly the kind of place you can linger and have great conversations.

GREEN. TEA. CREME. BRULEE. Enough said. I came here solely for this dessert and it was completely worth it. It was bar far the best creme brulee that I've had so far. It came with a sort of brittle and sorbet on the side. The employee explained with the fruits were but I forgot what it was...Everything was really great all together. The green tea inside was perfectly creamy&sweet without it being too much. We also tried the green tea matcha latte and got a chocolate gluten-free muffin. The green tea matcha latte was very green tea-y and not overly sweet like other coffee shops. We got a portion of simple syrup to put in it. The muffin was very moist and chocolate-y, very delicious for my first gluten-free dessert. Service was very friendly and helpful. Apparently there is also another branch in Seoul! My bf suggested to the employee that they should come to the West Coast to SF, and I wish they would! I would love to try their happy hour and tofu cheesecake that I hear is super soft&fluffy.

Went for the desserts here, and was the opposite of blown away. Split the green tea brulee and a cinnamon-froyo sundae. Green tea brulee was a bit too bitter, mixed with a sort of sweet crisp on top. ?S'ok. Froyo sundae was pretty much froyo in a cup with a side of toppings: some weird chocolate sauce, mochi, and burnt brownies. All pretty standard fare, but will put you back $24. ?Save your $$$ and get dessert at Carlo's at Port Authority or another eatery.

Four of us stopped in Saturday night for a late night dessert - three of us vegans. We had two options, a soy ice cream dish which was only fair, and a green tea sherbet which we passed around and no one dared to finish it. The one non-vegan ordered the green tea creme brulee which he couldn't even eat one bite. On top of that, service was poor. Advise vegans not go for dessert. Our experience was bad enough that we won't be returning.

I've only been to Kyotofu twice, but it is my new favorite place to rave about. It's such a gem - artistically-arranged, silky smooth food; trendy, modern (and romantic) d¨¦cor; excellent service - what more can you ask? I'm so in love with this place that I even bring friends that I'm not romantically interested in, which can be awkward, but all is dispelled when they take a bite out of Kyotofu's perfectly-crafted desserts. Amaaaazing. Each spoonful is heavenly - whether it's black sesame tofu, the summer anmitsu, or the chocolate mochi cake with matcha cream. The way that Kyotofu blends the flavors is truly extraordinary, and each mouthful is a delight. Yes, the red bean really is more flavorful and delicious than any red bean I've had; the tofu, in this form and flavor, really does transcend the range of normal tofu. I can't praise Kyotofu enough - do come and try the dessert. I haven't tried the savory food yet, but the menu for it also looks very well thought-out. A happy hour does exist, and my friends got the red rice ale (BOGO) and said that it was very good.

Great dessert place! I would come here only for dessert and have dinner some where else. Dinner food was good but I felt portions were small and over priced. I had the curry rice with kurobuta sausage (tasted like a hot dog) and panko pork. Everything tasted very good but I couldn't help but think I could have had a similar meal at Go-Go Curry for 3x less ($8 at Go-Go Curry). I bought a Gilt coupon for $30 for a dessert sampler for 2. The sampler included: sparkling sake - yum! black sesame sweet tofu - my favorite of all the desserts. So smooth and creamy. tofu cheesecake - I normally don't like cheesecake but I like this. It's very light and not too rich like regular cheese cakes. mango sorbet with red bean and jelly - so refreshing! I love red bean! mini chocolate cake - average, kinda dry, nothing special mini green tea brownie - so good. I could have had a bigger piece creme brulee - very cinnamony, tasted like fall macaroons - It almost tasted like there was an icecream filling. The dessert sampler also included some take home presents - chocolate soufle muffins. I also nabbed a chocolate souffle (gluten free) muffin just for checking in on yelp. I was pleasantly surprised how good these muffins tasted. They look very hard on the outside and I assumed it would be dry. But inside its very moist and each tasted like I was eatting a brownie. I advise coming here with a coupon. Although the desserts were delish, its a bit pricey to pay full price. This place is 10x better than chikalicious.

This was my second time visiting, my first time being years ago and my only memory from that was how I didn't like the tofu cheesecake. Well, let's just say that they've either improved over the years or my palate's changed, or both, since the tofu cheesecake tasted less tofu-y than I remembered. We got the 3-course dessert sampler, of which I only really liked the brownie with miso frosting (which did not taste like miso but was indeed a bit grainy) and the matcha chocolate with gingersnap-tasting cookie. Forgive me for not being able to remember the actual, long names of these things. My friend, on the other hand, liked the tofu panna cotta and the tofu cheesecake. I actually didn't like the black sesame syrup on the panna cotta; it was a tad too savory for me. We also got sparkling sake, which tasted more like cider than sake. Very sparkling indeed. Service was on the disappointing side. I think we waited at least 20 minutes to get our first course, and we arrived before 7pm when the place was still kind of empty. The sake came much, much later. We were forced to stare at other people getting the same things we ordered despite having arrived later. Not a good thing to do when you're hungry. The last items in the sampler were chocolate cupcakes for us to take home, which turned out to be more like muffins in cylindrical shapes. Not what I was expecting but pretty good. For a muffin.

Kytofofu is definitely a popular hangout, especially for people looking for tasty gluten-free deserts! ?It was definitely different for me, especially since... a lot of the time, it's hard for me to take a step back and just enjoy how something tastes, rather than thinking about what it is that went into making it taste the way it does. I love tofu. ?Dont get me wrong.... but the only type of tofu that I seem to like... in a desert way... is doh hua... or some people know it as doh fa -- a silken tofu with simple syrup. ? Warm Mochi Chocolate Cake ($11) -- It was interesting... because I was looking for more balanced flavors between the items that were present in deserts. ?My goal is to always get a little bit of everything on the spoon prior to my first bite... and for the Warm Mochi Chocolate Cake, it took a little while for things to become more cohesive... and for things to work together. ?The first bite was fine. ?The second bite, I got a little more of the white chocolate green tea mousse and... this was fine. ?It was kind of... bitter, and that's fine, but... that was bitter and the chocolate was... a different type of bitter... and well.. at that point, it was almost too much for me! ?Goodness. ?It was super rich and pretty delicious if you have the parts separately. Yuzu Citrus Tofu Cheesecake ($12) -- Pretty darn good. ?This came with three pieces! ?Every bite was delicious. ?In fact, I can confidently recommend this desert after a nice meal at 5 napkin burger a few blocks down. ?Not gonna lie, the flavors were balanced and exactly what I was looking for. ?Reminded me of a normal cheese cake with fresh fruit. ?WAIT a second.... the menu said Macerated Fruit! ?This time around, they weren't macerated. ?Either way... it was still delicious! Oh... The Ice Water -- What was up with this? ?Like... not one glass had an ice cube in it... and it was kind of needed, especially with the bold flavors that came along with the Warm Mochi Chocolate Cake. At the end of the day, I'm glad I was able to experience this desserts at Kyotofu. Would I go back? ?Definitely. ?For the cheesecake... and next time, i'll bring a frozen water bottle... because you need some ice with that drink!

If I had reviewed this the first time I came, I would've given it 5 stars. The first time, I had the green tea creme brulee and that was ...DELICIOUS. It is probably the highlight of all their desserts. I also like the atmosphere, it's very intimate. Definitely a place you should bring a date or just dessert with your girlfriends. Second and third time, I don't even remember what desserts I ordered but they were not notable. They also didn't have the green tea creme brulee at that time (seasonal?). The desserts I ordered the 2nd and 3rd time around were presented well, looked pretty and everything but failed the taste test. I think there was one other dessert I liked and that was the black sesame (?) tofu pudding. I like it here but wouldn't go out of my way for it unless I'm craving creme brulee green tea. I would give it a 3.5 but will round it to a 4

This place has been around for a long time, but I didn't get a chance to go until a recent Saturday afternoon. It turned out that I liked their savory dishes more than the desserts. I ordered the mushroom salad and my husband ordered the steak salad. Both dishes were small, but very delicious. We also shared an order of warm sweet potato cake, but it was not warm at all when it was served. The cake looked and tasted like it was cut from some pre-made loaf cake.

Great recommendation from my friend. The black sesame tofu panna cotta was awesome. Light and subtle with syrup on the side. I'm not a fan of traditional panna cotta but I was all over this. The sweet potato cake was too sweet and a little overwhelming. With caramel and caramelized pecans, it was over the top. I didn't expect the cake to be a sliced mini loaf. It was not as moist or as subtle as I expected. Guess it's more american style rather than japanese style. I was starving so I had the vegetarian curry as well. Nothing special but it hit the spot :-) The free chocalate gluten-free cupcake was delicious and the icing on the cake :-) If I'm ever in NYC again, I'd like to come here again for the panna cotta :-)

I was here almost once a week, and had tried just about everything on their sometimes-evolving menu. However, all of that changed about 5 months ago. While the desserts here are still good, the place just isn't as special in my heart anymore. Service has suffered quite a lot (possibly from the new hires they have made over the years) and prices have risen as well. The staff used to be so friendly, constantly providing take-home goodies as I was considered a "regular"; now however, I feel like they could care less about being warm or even attentive at all. I'm sad to see a place that I used to hold so dear to my heart just slip away... I think that Kyotofu could still be great for a first-timer, but I sincerely hope that they put more thought and effort into reviving the overall experience for their customers. -- For anyone who's interested in visiting, order the green tea creme brulee when they have it, the original or the black sesame goma tofu custard, miso mochi chocolate cake, and definitely the soft serve sundae. The savory foods are pretty mediocre, so don't bother.

I've been receiving Kyotofu gift boxes for awhile so I'm happy I actually got to go to their location in person. ?Btw, their gift boxes are super neat gifts! ?They come in a sturdy kyotofu box and each cupcake, cookie, or whatever you order is individually wrapped. ?Look into it for your foodie besties! For such a quality dessert place, I thought the dining area would be a bit nicer. ?I liked the cushioned white leather wall seats but hmm, just thought it would be more chic. ?I did like the mellow rhcp-esque music. For entrees we had the curry rice with sausage, chicken tofu burger, and pork belly. ? I enjoyed the Japanese style curry especially it's plating. ?Burger came with homemade taro chips! ?Pork belly was alright -- too salty for me. Now for the best part, dessert!! ?Yuzu cheesecake was plated as three pieces decorated with berries. ?Loved it -- ?cheesecake with a unique taste. ?We also had the ginger soft serve which was also really good -- ?never knew ginger could be a successful dessert flavor. ? Kyotofu has made its way on my list as a hang out for unique desserts. ?Also I want to swing by for brunch and try out their unique cocktails. ?Try out their gift boxes -- ?as a receiver of many, it's fun to try out their gluten free assortments!

I am a huge carnivore, but i loved their tofu burger. Their pre-fix dessert menu is just enough for two people. It included - first course: two shots of their signature sweet tofu - second course: a sample size of green tea creme brulee, yuzu citrus tofu cheesecake, and warm mochi chocolate cake - third course: two pieces of green tea chocolate and a chocolate chip cookie (they def half-assed this course) Remember to check in on yelp for a free gluten free cupcake!

This is my first review on Yelp. I went to Kyotofu with a friend. I always passed this restaurant many times but never tried it before so last night I decided to try. We had to wait for about 10-15 mins to get seated, and were not informed when free seats are available. It sucks, but that all changed when the first food comes. The Pork Belly is REALLY good. It has deep mixed of flavors and blends really well with the onigiri rice. The next thing we ordered is the dessert, and I ordered the warm chocolate mochi cake. Again, the presentation was flawless, and the taste fits perfectly in my mouth as food-finale. I would give it 5 stars if they serve the customers better, but the food is something you definitely don't wanna miss if you are around Hell's Kitchen!

Such a cute, cute place! Came here for dessert after dinner. Ordered the black sesame tofu and the tofu cream cheese. I devoured the black sesame tofu; it was so delicious, especially with the bits of the cracker that comes on top. The cheesecake was a bit too cream cheese-y for my taste, but my friend really liked it. All the desserts are super fancy and cute looking. The small almond cookies when they give you your check is yummy too. Service is great and waitresses are friendly. If you ask for water, ask for ice on the side because otherwise it is straight up tap water. Don't forget to check in on yelp! You get a free gluten free cupcake which is also delicious.. :)

Came here solely for desserts. Small space but nice decor. We ordered the Kaiseki prix fixe for two that came with: Signature sweet tofu - the tofu was light and creamy with a brown sweet syrup that contrasted it really well Green tea creme brulee - i love all things green tea, this one is no exception. ? Miso chocolate cake - didn't live up to my expectations. have to say it was a bit dry Yuzu citrus tofu cheesecake - nice and creamy Green tea nama chocolate with chocolate chip cookie - the chocolate was good but overly sweet. It came with complimentary green tea cookies. Dry but a nice touch. Maybe I came here with a too-full stomach so I didn't enjoy everything as much as I would have liked. Would definitely come back again to try more desserts. And if you check-in on facebook, they give you a free blueberry muffin.

Their Black Seseme Tofu is the best. ?That is the only thing I like here. This is what I order everytime I come here... Everything else I have tried..it is very normal. Simply ice cream + some fruits. very comfortable environment..but small though. I have had their pulled pork slider - it was very good. Haven't try much of the non dessert menu.

After reading some of the reviews written by others we have decided to check this place out. It's a cute little desserts place with a food menu taking up less than one page (entries and appetizers). The atmosphere is very chilled out, and the service is great. The food itself would get a 4 out of 5 from me. Mac n cheese while very hot, was cold in some places. The chicken tofu burger was pretty good though. Since its a desserts place, I expected them to out do themselves in that department, boy was a wrong. The deserts came, and both tasted like something you can get at a place in Brooklyn or queens but pay 3-4 dollars and not 10-12. I ordered a beer, but that never came and i didnt bother reminding the waitress about it. Overall, good atmosphere, OK service, but not the best place for food. I'd say it is highly overrated.

We stumbled into this place playing Restaurant Hunt, which is where you go to some neighborhood and just find a place that looks interesting. (Still working on a catchier name for that. Open to suggestions.) We were there for lunch and I'm aware that it's the dessert that kills, but the lunch is nothing to sneeze at either! The omokase bento box included a terrific slider and some nicely done pork belly. The ceviche (they have ceviche! Weird, right?) was also excellent; taro chips were a good idea. (It is, I should mention, yet another "ceviche in a martini glass" thing, and that shit is a little played out. But whatever, there are worse faults.) Looks like a romantic place to catch dessert later at night; if we're ever in the area around then (which we probably won't be) we'll be psyched to try that.

I've been meaning to review this place for awhile now. When my friend told me about this I was super stoked to visit this place. I love desserts! Especially Japanese sweets! This place is known to be an award winning Dessert Bar and Bakery in New York City. For those who have visited this place once, or can't visit this place because of the distance you can always order their baked goods & sweets on their website! Most of their sweets are made with artisanal tofu. The sweets aren't overbearingly sweet, just simply right. *** NOTE: THE MENU ROTATES EVERY SEASON. CHECK THE WEBSITE FOR UPDATED MENUS EACH SEASON. *** ========================== The DECOR: ========================== But, first let's talk about the look of this place. Can you say MODERN? ROMANTIC? INTIMATE? DIM LIGHTS? I love the look of this place! It's very nice at night and it's nice to take a person out on a date. Oooolala!~ We were seated right away so that's a plus! ========================== THE FOOD: ========================== 2 of my very wonderful friends of mine: Catherine and Andy came with me and ordered the following: Catherine - Green Tea Cr¨¨me Br?l¨¦e ($9) : pear ginger sorbet, housemade granola// - This is REALLY GOOD. The green tea is so good. I don't know how else to describe it. It's made perfectly! Maybe I'm being a bit biased because I favor green tea sweets very heavily. Oh yes this is the one! Very creamy like and thick! That's how I like my ?Cr¨¨me Br?l¨¦e Oh yeaaah! Andy - Spring Anmitsu ($10) : strawberry & lychee agar, yude azuki, shiratama, coconut-lime sorbet// - Originally, this is what I wanted to order due to the cool names on the description. When It came out I thought it was frozen yogurt. The verdict: Pure delight, and absolutely good. The taste of Lychee and Strawberry blends so well in this dessert. I really am amazed how it's presented. It was a little sour, but I don't mind it. It should be like that since it's "Spring" and it should have that nice refreshing taste to it. Me - Yuzu Citrus Tofu Cheesecake ($12) : almond-meringue, macerated berries// Not too sweet, but tasted like Cheesecake, but less fattening. I loved the Almond-Meringue on this it was sooo good. Melts in your mouth and it was very nice. Having it lightly burnt made it taste good. It gives the cake the right kick to enjoy this delectable sweet. ========================== CONCLUSION: ========================== This place also serves entrees as well if you don't have a sweet tooth, but son....ARE YOU CRAZY!? THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF BEING HERE. It's as good as it gets! ?Would I come back again? You bet I will! :D ?But, not for a long time sad face. I'm going to miss you Kyotofu! D; ?Next time when I visit New York again someday in the far, far, future or sooner xD

Kyotofu is a delicious dessert spot with a trendy interior! ?My friends and I sampled the following: Green tea creme brulee: A My favorite! I love creme brulee, and I love green tea. This was easily one of the best desserts I've had in awhile. I enjoyed it so much because it tasted light and refreshing. Warm mochi chocolate cake: A- This was just as good in quality as the green tea creme brulee, but is more of a dessert for those who prefer rich, decadent desserts. It resembled a lava cake, with liquid oozing from the middle. I enjoyed a bite of it, but more would have been too rich for my liking. Tip: Check in on Yelp to receive a free gluten-free cupcake. We had four check-ins, and received four cupcakes: a variety of green tea and chocolate souffle cupcakes. I didn't enjoy these as much as the above desserts - they were too dry in my opinion. I liked the white interior and the trendy music that was playing, and will definitely be back for that green tea creme brulee. It's a great place to hang out with friends, chat, and indulge in sweets!

Came here after dinner elsewhere; my yelp foodie bffl introduced me to this place, and as always, I was not disappointed. We shared a green tea creme brulee which had just the right amount of caramelization for the brulee. It's creamy and has the best green tea flavor without being overly sweet. I also enjoyed how it's not bitter at all; some green tea flavored desserts tend to leave a bitter aftertaste, but that's not the case here. It also comes paired with a pear ginger sorbet sitting on top of glazed oats. The sorbet has the perfect texture and has only a hint of ginger flavor. Awesome, because I don't like overpowered ginger flavor. Presentation is also a plus, it has such a nice twill to top everything off! We also shared a iced latte that came with a separate small glass of liquid sugar. (Funny, because I could've sworn that our waiter said it was a glass of "liquor shot" when he brought it out.... died laughing.) I appreciated that the sugar came separate; the latte doesn't really need that much extra sweetening. My friend and I both checked in and we received a free gluten-free chocolate souffle cupcake. I brought it home because you're not allowed to eat it on premises (they give it to you right before you leave to take home). In the words of my brother--"holy jizz." I'm pretty sure that's a good thing. I had a piece of it, and it's so crumbly and moist and yummmyyyy. Ambience at night is perfect for a cozy date. Service is fast and super friendly too.

CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE CUPCAKE -- the biggest reason to stop by here. so moist, rich, and delicious. i was eating the crumbs off the plate. :D Plus, for posting a photo of our dessert on FB, this delectable treat was FREE! Silken tofu salad - good tofu, but overpriced in my opinion. then again, most salads are. the greens that came with this were slightly too bitter for my liking. you can tell they put a lot of effort into presentation though; even the sesame seeds sprinkled on the tofu were in a straight line. Bento box - so cute. a decent amount of food for $16 and well-prepared. no part of the dish had an incredible WOW factor though. Yuzu cheesecake - a light cheesecake with a hint of orange. the toasted almond meringue on top was great, with a smoky flavor that reminded me of perfectly toasted marshmallows. the cheesecake itself was so-so. Other factors: The restaurant is a bit hard to locate since it doesn't have a large sign stating its presence. Look for a plain white store. The service was amazing since we went during lunch and there weren't many customers. Our server was highly attentive.

Such a cute place!!! I wish we had something like this in Chicago... I just love the concept that it's mainly dessert and that it's open late. We came here after a walk all the way from Times Square to Battery Park and back. We stopped at a bunch of places throughout, so we weren't too hungry. Anyway, we had the chicken and tofu sliders and from what I can remember, they were just OK. It's a dessert place, so maybe it's better to stay away from any other type of food; though if I lived in NY, I would def try this place again for lunch or dinner. For dessert, we had a warm chocolate cake with passion fruit mochi and the green tea creme br?l¨¦e. The creme br?l¨¦e was something out of this world and I can honestly say that it was one of the best desserts i have ever had in my life! I love NYC, so I do hope I will be back soon, and when I do, I will def come back to this wonderful spot!

I consumed one of the best desserts of my life here. I exaggerate NOT. A disappointing dinner up the street warranted an epic dessert to make up for it. My friend and I looked to and fro on Yelp on our phones. We both settled on Kyotofu when we found it. It looked interesting enough. It looked different than your average ice cream shop or bakery to squelch our collective sweet teeth. Upon entering, we were seating at a small bar area in the front of the tiny restaurant space, perused the dessert menu, and settled on our options. About 10 minutes later, we took our first bites and spiraled into a food-induced bliss like no other! I had the Green Tea Cr¨¨me Br?l¨¦e with ginger pear sorbet and housemade granola. My friend had the Warm Mochi Chocolate Cake with green tea white chocolate mousse and knaoko tuile. Folks, if you want a truly mind-blowing and unique dessert experience, look no further. I honestly can not find the proper words to describe how awesome this food was. It's something you need to experience for yourself. It's beyond compare. SO GO. NOW.

I've been here after dinner to grab a few desserts and it's pretty darn good. The restaurant itself is really dark with good ambiance. We ordered off the summer dessert menu, but unfortunately I don't remember the names of any of things we ordered. But they were all made with fresh, delicious tofu! The mochi chocolate cake was really good as well. 4 stars for the desserts, but I can't speak for the food itself since I didn't try any.

Dessert Review: My friend and I had the mochi chocolate cake (which I loved) and the black sesame tofu (which she loved). It was a little pricey and the desserts are kinda small but they're worth it. This is def a place everyone has to try once in NY. Got a free chocolate gluten free cupcake and it almost tasted like the mochi chocolate cake except the middle was very moist...so good. I wanna go back and try their other desserts!!! The area in the front is kinda small but we were seated in the back which was really romantic but very cozy. You have to be careful getting on and off your seat cuz you have to pull the table and there's not enough space. You kinda get very intimate with your neighboring table. Lol.

If you are up for a sweet gastronomic adventure, Kyotofu is the place for you. The chefs at Kyotofu incorporate tofu into all of their artisanal desserts. I went to this place on a few occasions and I would recommend you to try Sweet Tofu, Warm Sweet Potato Cake, and Warm Chocolate Mochi Cake. I highly suggest that you only come to this place for their desserts, not for your main courses. However, if you are in a rush for time, you should try their Sake Braised Pork Belly, soft buttery meat that just melts in your mouth. The portions of their main course are meant to be small to give you the space to tummy their delicious desserts. Up for ?something adventurous with your friends? You should order the chef's tasting menu, a degustation menu that ignites your senses. I like to close my eyes, taste the texture of the food, and identify the ingredients within the chunk of tofu. A downside to place is their service staff lack of attentiveness, having two to serve the 30 to 40 people, so expect service to be a little slow when it's crowded. Overall: Two thumbs up and a smiley face! :)

This review is based on the desserts only. My friend and I were in the neighborhood last Friday and craving for something sweet. We got lucky because when we arrived there were two seats next to the window and we got seated immediately - didn't have to wait at all. However, a few minutes later, bunch of other people showed up (big groups, couples), and they couldn't be seated until we got done with our desserts. We tried the kuro goma sweet tofu, which was smooth but creamy. You are supposed to pour the syrup over the sweet tofu and mix them. Don't over-do it, they definitely give you more syrup than you actually need, so no need to use all of it. The dessert was served in a nice glass but it was a bit messy to share this dessert. Our waitress recommended the warm chocolate mochi cake, which was really good as well. Both desserts were not too sweet and the flavors were well-balanced. I left the place with a satisfied feeling.

Love this place! The desserts are fantastic and the staff is friendly and helpful! We got the green tea creme brulee with the pear sorbet and peanut brittle- delicious and a bit more on the savory side We also tried their award winning chocolate souffle cupcake with vanilla and chocolate soy milk ice cream-- the taste for the chocolate souffle was great but it was a bit on the dry side... the ice cream... amazing! The plate presentation is beautiful and it's decently priced. Check it out!

My NYC food reviews continue... LOL ?After getting washed up in the rain, we were a tad hungry, next on the list was Kyotofu-located Hell's kitchen. Kyotofu is well known for their award winning Japanese dessert bar/bakery. Kyotofu endeavors to turn the meal's last course into a dedicated evening outing, accessorized with fruity cocktails and wrapped up in a sleekly designed, date-friendly package. The menu consists of not only desserts but tidbits, which can be ordered separately or in a bento style appetizer plate. For starters: Pigs in a duvet ($10)- Kurobuta sausage wrapped in puff pastry, whole grain mustard-the pastry was so light, made you want to pop two in your mouth at the same time. Silken tofu salad-($12)-Roasted green market veggies, house made tofu, mesclun greens, yuzu miso dressing. Seconds pls Warm japanese mushroom salad ($11)- Glazed honshimeji and maitake mushrooms, mesclun greens, red onion, panteleo cheese.- Smooth and balanced flavor. Curry rice ($10)-gruyere, hard boiled egg, kurobuta sausage. This was my favorite!! I need to learn how to make this. Desserts:green tea cr¨¨me br?l¨¦e ($9)- pear ginger sorbet, house made granola-different but I liked it. Kuro goma sweet tofu-($8)-black sesame sweet tofu panna cotta, hoji-cha syrup, white sesame tuile-sock it to me, this was sooo delightful-A cup of chilled black-sesame-sweet-tofu pudding! yummy. Another ethereal custard dish, paired with tea-flavored syrup. Yuzu citrus tofu cheesecake ($12)-almond-meringue, macerated berries-Very thin and light, no complaints here. Meltingly warm miso chocolate cakes ($15)-the insanely rich scoop of maple-spiked soy mascarpone atop the toasted walnut vanilla parfait. Will I be back? YES!!! check out my pictures =)

Terrible service, below par desserts. What can I say except- Meh, I have experienced better. Sunday evening, there was no wait to be seated and four of us went in for their desserts because we have all read the rave reviews. Unfortunately, it was a strike for me. Service was terrible. Waiter had a cocky attitude with lack of knowledge of the dessert. It was painful to ask about the menu item, because he would be mumbling, saying um, not sure, and okay in monotone without even looking at our table. No idea where he was looking. Also, they first sat us down right under the AC, which had the air directly at the table. We requested to be moved and they weren't too happy even if the place was more than half empty. Now for desserts: 1. Green tea Creme Brulee- Best thing we ordered. However, creme brulee is strong in green tea flavor, so if you don't like green tea, don't order it. The crack you hear when you break through the sugar on top is delicious. It comes with sorbet, which is mild in flavor. There was a fruit on top, pretty sweet, but no idea what that was. Our waiter didn't explain it to us. Also, the dessert is pretty heavy and filling so give your stomach a rest before ordering this dessert. 2. Yuzu Citrus Tofu Cheesecake- Very strong yuzu flavors. it actually overpowers everything. This has texture like cheesecake, but it doesn't exactly copy the cheesecake flavor. I have to say it was just okay for me, maybe because I was so excited for this dessert? Either way, it was just okay, but I would recommend anyone who likes yuzu to try it. 3. Warm Mochi chocolate cake- Disappointed. I thought mochi would be prominent, but instead I got a dry chocolate cake. Boohoo. Where was the chewy deliciousness of mochi? I have no idea. 4. Chocolate Souffle cupcake- First, we were confused on which was warm mochi cake and which was chocolate souffle cupcake because the waiter just laid the desserts and didn't tell us which was what. Either way, this was actually not bad. I think this is the one that came out with sugar/ honey sauce. It wasn't super moist, but not as dry of the warm mochi chocolate cake. Overall, just meh. 5. Kuro Goma Sweet tofu- Ew. I really did not like this. I can see how someone would LOVE this sweet tofu saturated with sesame flavor. Tofu is soft, you eat with the sweet watered down sauce that comes with it. For me, not sweet enough, could still taste weird soy after taste with the sesame flavor over powering EVERYTHING while you are eating it. I think I was disappointed because it was so hyped up and it wasn't as unhealthy as I like my sweets. Also, certain flavors would over power the whole dessert, which turned me off. It didn't help that the waiter was not very pleasant. I don't think I'll go back. Possibly to get their cupcakes to-go for taste, but I probably wouldn't be going back to Kyotofu for their sit down service.

I was really debating between 4 or 5 stars, but I had to go w/ 5 for 2 main reasons - 1) the desserts served here are so unique that you'll probably never be able to get them anywhere else 2) the chocolate souffle cupcake is one of the best cupcakes I've had, and it doesn't even have frosting! ? My favorites are the soymilk soft serve & black sesame tofu. ?All the desserts on the menu are really light, delicate tasting, and not overly sweet. ?The chocolate souffle cupcake is so unbelievably moist and also voted best cupcake by NYC magazine. ?They also have good drink specials a lot of the time...I think 50% off cocktails during happy hour & I also came here late one night & all the sake was half off. ? Great date place w/ nice ambience, friendly wait staff, and dimly lit candles.

This is a nice dessert date night location! I believe there's a free cupcake if you do a yelp check-in, but when my cousin checked in and asked the waitress, she said they ran out of the cupcakes. ? There's not a lot of seating and the tables are positioned very close to each other. The table next to us was leaving and they almost knock over our drinks b/c there was any room to squeeze through the two tables. The Green tea creme brulee was very yummy! I wanted another one after I finished mines!

This place is trying too hard and yet, is not trying hard enough where it counts: --There's no sign outside of the place, so if you walk fast enough, you will go right past it. --The interior is practically two by two feet yet I had to wait almost 5 minutes before someone noticed I was waiting to be seated. --The decor in the back seems nice but my guest & I were told we had to sit in the front since we were using a deal-voucher. --The stools we were seated on were not steady so we had to surf the entire time; on the plus side, my core is in great shape. The positives: --The drinks are strong, so strong I had to tell the waiter to water it down. The waiter with the tinge of orange in his hair was very pleasant (and earned the tip I gave him), the other waiters seemed to want us gone before we even arrived, especially the one who seated us. The sliders were surprisingly good considering that tofu was allegedly one of he ingredients. Me & my guest had to go to TRAFFIC next door to this place just to get a real dinner in our bodies, so that speaks volumes about the rest of the menu up in this place. Aside from the mediocre food, I may have had a better view of this place had the service by the other wait-staff been better; sometimes service makes all the difference.

I loveeeeeee desserts and Kyotofu makes me feel a little less guilty. Who knew tofu could taste this good? This is a cute little after dinner date spot. I went there pretty late one Friday evening and a lot of the things we wanted to try was sold out :( . I wanted the Green Tea Creme Brulee and the Cheesecake. Womp womp. Anyway, we wound up getting: Kuro Goma Sweet Tofu - Mmm.. black sesame. I love anything black sesame. Came with a shot glass of syrup to put in it so you can alter the sweetness to your liking. Really smooth, silky texture. Warm Mochi Chocolate Cake - I was expecting a little more to this.. It wasn't too warm and wasn't really filled with as much mochi as I'd like. I'm surprised this was the most expensive one. It's just like a chocolate cupcake/muffin with a little mochi in the center. Tofu Panna Cotta Neopolitan - My favorite of the 3, it's like getting 3 desserts in one! I love the flavors and texture. A bit thicker than the black sesame, I prefer this one.. The strawberry was really good - reminds me while growing up, eating the strawberry flavored asian goodies.. you know, that artificial (in a good way) but so good taste? I can't explain it. Oh and they gave free black sesame cookies at the end. Score. I loved their presentation too, I uploaded a pic.. They change their menu each season so things may change, go enjoy it now :)

After reading all the good reviews, I finally decided to make a trip to experience Kyotofu with my foodie girl friend, but nothing really impressed us. Food, ambience and service was ok but not great! The soba noodle we ordered to share was over-cooked or too soft, but steak salad (special for the night) served with fresh fruits was not bad... BOGO happy hour special cocktails are quite good though as well as their signature sweet tofu.. I suppose Kyoto is only known for dessert, not for food....

I had the dessert sampler and all the items were good but nothing was exceptional. ?The souffle and green tea creme burlee were the best of the selection. ?Overall, the positive is that everything was presented very nicely and the negative is that the price does not justify the product. ?I love desserts but I would not come back here w/o a coupon. ?I can get equal or even more satisfaction for my sweet cravings at 1/4 the price or less, without having to wait 30 min for a seat. ?It is, however, definitely superior to Chikalicious, this other very hyped up dessert place that I've tried. I would probably rate the food 3.5 stars if I could and since there is no half a star rating, I'm rounding it up half a star for presentation and good service.

Overrated!! Yes the place is beautiful and modern but their desserts are not up to par! The only redeeming dessert is the Green Tea Creme Brulee. Everything else was bleh. I ordered the "KAISEKI prix fixe menu for two / 28 chef's selection three course dessert tasting pair with:" - - ?this was not as good as I thought it was. #1 was the Green Tea Creme Brulee: This one is good and in generally I love anything Green Tea. [4 STAR] #2 warm mochi chocolate cake - this is heavy chocolate and one bite is enough for me. stuff is good but wouldn't want to take more than a bite. [2 STAR] #3 yuzu citrus tofu cheesecake ?- this was bleh - It had an asian dried orange peel taste which I hate. [1 STAR - or NO STARS] CONS: - yuzu citrus tofu cheesecake - bleh - free complimentary desserts: (i) a green tea square (i love green tea - unfortunately i took a huge bite of this and found myself disappointed - it was a weird green tea taste mixed with heavy salt and bitter chocolate] - DISG. (ii) mini chocolate chip cookie - average - at least this one tasted better. - Overpriced !! Group of 4 - ordered 2 Kaiseki only to find it costed us about $75 which was almost equivalent to the Korean meal we had with more food. I must say Lady M is so much better to go for dessert. Don't think I will be ever coming back again. If this is the Chef's best and the top 3 desserts for the Kaiseki prix fixe they are sorely mistaken because it is no where near the best.

The first time I came here, I had a Gilt City coupon for a three course desert meal for two along with some pink sparkling sake. It was quite impressive and probably one of the best things I bought on Gilt City. The green tea fudge and creme brulee were probably my favorites. However, I was not that impressed with the chocolate cupcakes which we brought home with us, even if they were voted best cupcake in NYC. The texture was dry and it didn't provide the sweet, magical satisfaction that usually comes with consuming a cupcake. This place is quite pricey, so be prepared to drop some dough really quickly. It is also quite cramped. The second time I was here, they had to pull out the tables just so that we could get seated. In addition, we were constantly irritated not being able to hear each other just because the person sitting at the table next to us was obnoxiously loud.

I'm kind of surprised that there are so many stellar reviews for Kyotofu. I went with some friends from out of town because they saw it had a lot of high remarks. It was good...but it was nothing special. I got the black sesame tofu, which was the best of the three, but honestly it just tasted like black sesame pudding which you can make yourself and save the $10. We also got the regular tofu dessert and the cheesecake, neither of which were memorable or worth it. Like I said, it's not BAD...I just won't ever go back.

A really nice place to to get quality dessert. Done with an Asian flair, Kyotofu's desserts are executed with a subtle sweetness and a good balance between richness and lightness. Still very filling and enjoyable. Everything is nicely presented, so you definitely feel that special sparkle of going out to eat. The menu changes with the seasons. I ordered the kuro goma sweet tofu and I tried a bite of the spring anmitsu. The spring anmitsu is very refreshing and light. There is a really nice interplay of textures between the agar jelly cubes and the sorbet. The black sesame sweet tofu had a nice silky texture. The syrup was really infused with the roasted rice (hoji) flavor. I was really impressed by how distinct the hoji-cha flavor was in the syrup. To eat the sweet tofu, try a bite of it unadorned. Then, you can play around and figure out how much sweetened syrup you like with each bite of tofu. In addition, when the check comes, a small sweet accompanies the check. During this visit, we each had a cute, little shortbread cookie to finish our Kyotofu experience. This would make a cute place for dessert and a date with friends or a romantic interest. Definitely get a reservation if you want to sit at a table (the back portion of the place has tables). Otherwise, you'll have to clamor for one of the stools in the storefront. They do offer a variety of thing to-go as well.

The desserts are very good, created to taste like authentic Japanese desserts. Albeit pricey, it's worth it for high-quality dessert. Do not go here for their limited dinner menu, which are overpriced and the taste so-so (I got the dinner bento-set; my friends got the hot Soba noodle and the mac&cheese). In addition, it seems like a one-man show with the waiter. Often packed and busy, they need to hire more waiters.

The dine-in desserts are slightly overpriced. Especially considering that the flavors you get from their chocolate-infused desserts can be found in most other places. You're paying, really, for the presentation... and I will agree that that one aspect of their food is fantastic. I don't get the hype.

Time Arrived: 9:30pm Wednesday Time Wait: No Reservations, No wait Party: 4 People Atmosphere: Dim lighting, cozy, super small Food/Drink: Making any dessert taste good with its base as tofu wins already!! This was my 2nd time coming here and I was still thoroughly impressed with its presentation and taste! My top favorites were the Black Sesame Pudding, Green Tea Creme Brulee and the Tofu Panna Cotta Neopolitan. The consistency of all 3 were pretty similar - very smooth and not too sweet. Also tried the cheesecake and warm mochi chocolate cake, which were ok. Service: Amazing service! Loved our waiter and his honesty. Me and a friend were thinking about ordering 2 pots of tea, but our waiter honestly suggested we just stick with 1 and share because in reality, it's not worth it to pay $6+ for tea per person! Overall: Love! Definitely will come back :)

Kyotofu has absolutely phenomenal service. I went here with my girlfriend who was visiting from out of town over the weekend, and had planned on using the Google Offer for a 3-course dessert sampler. We got to the restaurant relatively late into the night, and, seeing it nearly empty, were ecstatic that there wouldn't be a wait. Unfortunately for me, I hadn't realized that I was supposed to cal a day ahead to let them know my intent on using the Google Offer. Somehow it came to pass that I mentioned that my girlfriend was headed back to DC the next day, and he decided to accomodate us anyway. At that point, I knew that Kyotofu would be a great experience. The desserts themselves were incredible (my favorites were the tofu panna cotta and the yuzu cheesecake), and the sake included in the sampler was among the most delicious I've ever had, although my experience with sake is relatively limited. At the end, the offer included two chocolate souffle cupcakes, but since it was close to closing time and the server dude was awesome, he gave us a whole bunch more in a box, which we ate for breakfast the next day. I'll definitely be back.

This. Place. Is. Heaven. The desserts here were so good, I can't even describe it. You just have to come here and trust me. If you are a lover of green tea or just a mild fan, try the green tea creme brulee. It felt like the recreation of Paradise was happening in my mouth and my taste buds were praising the glory of Kyotofu. The priciness of the desserts are absolutely worth it, every cent. My friends had the Soymilk Ice Cream Sundae which was delicious for something that sounds so healthy and the Sweet Tofu was interesting and made my tongue feel ten times more sophisticated.

A friend kept telling me that I HAD to go to Kyotofu whenever I'm in NY. ?After checking out the website, I was convinced to give it a try. Basically this restaurant takes an American dish and adds a Japanese twist to it. For example, instead of beef for a hamburger, they'd substitute tofu. I had strategically planned out my night where I would be in the area and stopping by for dinner would be the perfect plan. ?I arrived around 9pm and was praying that there wouldn't be a wait at the restaurant. Luckily, there wasn't! The restaurant is quite small (normal for NYC, I suppose). ?Once you enter the tiny doorway, you will see the kitchen on right and the counter on the left. As you proceed straight ahead, you will enter the dimly lit dining area. Probably a total of about 8 tables (4 on the left and 4 on the right). It definitely felt like the perfect place to bring a date. ? For my entree, I ordered the cha soba noodles, and my brother ordered the chicken and tofu burger. ?We both didn't know what to expect and were pleasantly surprised that the dishes turned out OK. ? Since this place is known to have the best Japanese desserts, we had to order some. ?My brother picked the cinnamon sugar donut holes but they were out. :( so I picked the green tea creme brulee (should be obvious by now). ?It was....interesting. I like green tea and I like creme brulee, but the two flavors mixed together made it taste a little strange. ?They also gave us some complimentary cookies when we got their bill. ?The cookies tasted OK - a little bland and dry. ? I can see people who prefer Asian desserts to really enjoy this place. ?Their desserts aren't too sweet and include flavors that Asians tend to like (green tea, miso, black sesame, sweet tofu). ?I think whether or not you'll enjoy this place depends on your preference for sweets. ?If I was in the area again, I'd like to give this place another try but perhaps come only for tea and dessert so I can order their 3 course dessert tasting.

Took the bestie here after a delicious meal from totto ramen a few blocks down. Ordered the green tea and sesame soy milk ice cream combo and the green tea creme brulee. The ice cream wasn't bad. I guess we're used to the creamier taste in other ice creams. But it does come with 3 toppings - fresh berries, salted caramel sauce and crumbled chocolate cookie. It does however taste better with the caramel sauce. Green tea creme brulee was AWESOME! It was very light and not too sweet. But i think the biggest hit was the pear ginger sorbet that came with it. We literally couldn't stop eating it. It was very light and citrusy. An awesome combo with the brulee. Sad part is that they only have the green tea creme brulee during the spring/summer...must come back soon!

This place was nice... went here with a group of girls. I had some chicken sliders which were absolutely delish! I also had some tofu vanilla bean dessert which was very good but broke my face out later. I guess I had an allergy to some hidden ingredient. I had two drinks which were very tasty but a bit too pricey for the size. This is a very small place, but the ambiance is very nice for a date or going out with a group of friends. I had to take a couple of stars off because the menu is lacking and the drinks are too small for the price.

Boyfriend and I were in NYC for memorial weekend. We're from SoCal and my cousin who's from NY recommended this place. Guess what? From our short weekend in NY we came here TWICE! We loved it that much. It is quite pricey but since we were on a vacation sort of trip we didn't mind spending the money. Over our two visit we ordered the sweet tofu, black sesame tofu, green tea creme brulee and the citrus cheesecake. I LOVE the green tea creme brulee, it was the best! The sweet tofu was really good too. Black sesame tofu is okay.. and the citrus cheesecake, it wasn't to my liking, it's good.. but for a cheesecake.. it's okay ehs. Very modern and my boyfriend even wanted to start one in LA! I think it'd do well in LA too right right?? Hahaha. It's a lovely experience. =D

Am I the only person in the city that doesn't like this place? I took my mother here for an early mother's day dessert outing. She ordered the warm mochi chocolate cake. Overpriced and nothing special, plus it was ridiculously tiny. You can get the same thing but bigger and half the price at any dessert place in the area. I ordered the tofu panna cotta neopolitan, which was disgustingly sweet and the taste was just completely off. Not only were the desserts mediocre and expensive, but the service was horrendous. No one refilled our water, we had to wait 20 minutes for our waiter to come over and take our order, and another 30 for the desserts to come out. And this was at 3pm on a relatively quiet Friday, so I don't see any excuse for that sort of service. Will sadly not be returning.

My friend knows the owners here, and we got hooked up! The desserts just keep coming out since we were on an ordering spree and more and more friends kept joining us. It was a nice place to catch up with friends. Hmm, I would prob just recommend to come here for desserts, and skip the meals. We ordered: 1) Green tea brulee 2) Cinnamon Donut holes 3) Mocha cake 4) Tofu Panna cotta 5) Sweet tofu 6) Black sesame Hmm, my favorite were the green tea brulee and mocha cake. *Also, we received goodie bags to take home! Thank you Kyotofu for making my trip memorable!

I came here tonight to use my Google Offer. ? We paid $30 for $60 for a dessert sampler & sparkling sake for two. ? ? Based on the reviews below, Kyotofu seems like it gets really busy and it takes a really long time to get a table because of the small number of tables. ?However, tonight was Monday and when I got there, there was only one table with two people seated. ? When you walk in, you see a see through glass area where the pastry chef works. ? That's pretty cool because it gives the people waiting for a table something to do/see. ?Then, on the left is the cash register and some random bar stools. ? Towards the back is the bathroom (had really cold AC btw and felt really good since it was kinda warm tonight) and the tables. ? For our deal, it came with: First course - vanilla sweet tofu panna cotta with kuromitsu syrup. ? This was really good. ? It had a peanut taste to it and was very creamy/melt in your mouth goodness. ?If you ever had the Chinese tofu-fa with the syrup, this tasted just like it. ?Honestly though, I think I'd prefer to eat the Chinese one since it's about $1.50/$2 for a huge thing and you get so much more for your money. ? The glass it came in was really cute, but tiny. ? I don't know if I'd pay full price for this since it is too similar to tofu-fa. Second course - trio of minis: yuzu citrus tofu cheesecake, miso chocolate cake, and matcha green tea cr¨¨me br?l¨¦e. ? ?So apparently a lot of people have been coming to Kyotofu to use the google offer in the past few days. ? This meant no more green tea creme brulee. ?I was soooooooooo disappointed. ?I am a huge huge huge green tea fan, whether it be tea, chocolate, ice cream, candy and I was really looking forward to this dessert. ? I didn't even realize they did the switch until the waitress said pumpkin creme brulee. ? Once I heard pumpkin, I'm like uh, I don't recall reading there was a pumpkin creme brulee option. ?I mean, what if I was severely allergic to pumpkin? ? I think the waitress should have brought it out to our attention that they ran out of green tea creme brulee and asked if that was okay instead of us bringing it to their attention. ? Luckily for us, we didn't mind trying the pumpkin, but I can foresee this being a problem for others. ? So on to the food - the cheesecake was really good. ? The texture of it was kind of heavy, sort of like Juniors Cheesecake and not airy and light like Eileen's Cheesecake. ? It came with a berry sauce and that was really good as well. ? Despite feeling down about not getting to try my green tea creme brulee and having to make due with the pumpkin, I was pleasantly surprised. ? It wasn't as bad as I thought it was taste. ?Note - I am not a fan of anything pumpkin. ? This wasn't anything special though so I wouldn't order this. ?It tasted like a regular caramel creme brulee. ? Lastly, the miso chocolate cake was a total bust. ?I am a huge fan of chocolate so don't get me wrong. ? This tasted like a brownie and was very chocolately. ?I was not blown away and I felt like I was eating just that - ?a brownie. ? I mean it was good, but just not what I was expecting since I was paying so much for teeny tiny sample sizes. Third course - matcha green tea Nama chocolate petit four and a kinako hazelnut chocolate chunk cookie. ?Now this may sound good, heck I thought it sounded good, but it doesn't taste as good as it sounds unfortunately. ? The matcha green tea was basically a really hard piece of green tea chocolate. ? it was good, but if you aren't a chocolate person, i can foresee there being problems. ?As for the cookie, that was a bust as well. ? It wasn't anything special and tasted just like any random chips a'hoy cookie. ? We were given a small shot glass of sparkling sake. ?It wasn't overly sweet and it tasted like champagne. ? We were also given two cupcakes to take home and i have yet to eat that so once I eat it, i will come back and edit my review. ? If you check in on yelp, you also get to a free gluton free cupcake so that was a huge plus! So over all, i paid $30 for supposedly $60 worth of dessert. ?On top of this, they charge you 20% gratuity on the $60 which came out to be about $12. ? So in total, I paid $42, not worth it at all. ? The only thing I would come back here for would be the cheesecake and that's pushing it for me. ? I only came here because of the google offer and plus I've been dying to try it so why not come with a coupon right? ? Wrong. ? I feel like Kyotofu could have made a better effort and not offer run of the mill options for the sampler. ? I felt like my $42 could have gone farther if I went to Lady M's on the UES. ? Don't get me wrong, I don't mind spending money for food as long as it's good and I feel I got my money's worth. ? Sadly, this did not apply to Kyotofu tonight. Needless to say, we were still hungry even though we just spent $42 so we decided to venture over two blocks to wait an hour for Toto Ramen. ? (See my review).

This place gets 5 stars for their Sweet Tofu dessert w/ Kuromitsu syrup. ?It was SOOOOOO good. ?I loved the light, airy, creamy texture of the tofu, contrasted by the dark herbally sweetness of the syrup. ?The tofu didn't have any of the strong acidic slightly bitter taste that normal tofu usually has. ?Amazing. Did we try other items on the menu? ?Yes, both sweet and savory (came back 2 nights in a row cuz of the Sweet Tofu). ?Did we love anything but the Sweet Tofu? ?Not really, everything else was forgettable and not worth mention, but WHO CARES?! ?5 stars for the Sweet Tofu Dessert. ?Period.

Stumbled on this place when we saw their sign on the sidewalk that says "NY's best cupcake!" Looked cute enough inside to warrant a visit, so we decided to stop by for some dessert. The back area with seating was full, so we sat at the front counter area. Had the sweet potato cake and the award-winning chocolate cupcake. I asked the waitress beforehand if it was american or Japanese sweet potato. She had ?no idea and said Japanese, but it was definitely American. My favorite part was the mixed green tea and regular soymilk soft serve that came with the chocolate cupcake. It was delicious! Will definitely come back to try more of the menu when I'm in the area...it's just so far away..

Holy Bat Mobile, this place rocked! After a wonderful Bikram workout, we were famished and wanted something good to eat. We were in the area, and this place was on my radar for awhile. The place is beautiful, white walls, sleek and modern. We were seated in the back dining area immediately (it was almost 9:30pm by this time). Our waiter was drop dead gorgeous, he was hot in pasty, vampire sort of way. Now, my blood is boiling. Oh wait, how I get sidetracked so easily. Sigh. We started off with the crab croquettes and they were delicious. You can't really go wrong with croquettes. My friend ordered the mac n cheese and I ordered the soba noodles. I absolutely love soba noodles, and this dish was really refreshing. It was chocked full of mushrooms and with good soba noodles. My friend said the mac n cheese was really good and from the looks of the plate, I believe her! The desserts here steal the show. Come for their pre fixe dessert special for Valentine's Day! My friend got the mocha green tea frozen yogurt and I opted for the sweet potato cake. No complaints here. In fact, both desserts are absolutely to die for. They also specialize in cookies, cakes, and cupcakes. Definitely bring some home for that special someone. This is a great place hidden in a not so great part of town! If you find yourself in Midtown, definitely find this foodie oasis and hide from the mediocrity of Midtown!

when a vegan friend of mine suggested dinner at a place with "tofu" in its name, my little 10-year old self went "tofu?? eewwwwwww" even when i reluctantly ordered the "artisinal tofu" (because i like artisinal cheeses so i figured anything with "artisinal" must be good*), my little 10-year old self still said "tofu?? ewwwwwwww." to my surprise, my little 10-year old self (and my mid-20-year old self) discovered tofu ain't that bad! it came out as a ball of silky smooth creamy tofu, with 3 different sauces you could pair it with: a spicy soy, a sweet soy, and a tomatoey based sauce that i don't quite remember because all i could think about was HOW DELICIOUS THE SWEET SOY TASTED IN MY MOUTH. dip that tofu in there some more! for my entree, i chose the steak salad. the steak salad is about a medium-sized portion. not too small, but definitely not an "entree" size. nonetheless, i still enjoyed it. it comes with greens, arugula, a nice array of tropical fruits (pineapples, watermelons), and of course - steak. the fruits gave the salad a bit more flavor. i love me some fruits in my salad. and the steak was rare-ish, but not too rare. very chewy and juicy. a great salad for those who don't like salads! the highlight of our meal was, of course, the desserts. i actually had no idea this place was known for their desserts. i thought it was just tofu! (see above re: ewwwww tofu) we split the pumpkin ice cream. it was oh-so-soft and creamy. it came with a cherry mixture and brownie crumbs to top it off. the waitress also brought me my gluten-free chocolate cupcake. i had no idea gluten-free anything could taste so good!!!! i'm pretty sure she just opened up a whole new world for me. on another note, the waitress was awesome. she was attentive without pressuring us. she left us alone to chat while still making sure we were doing okay. she was very knowledgeable about all the food items and gave my friend some recommendations based on which items were vegan or could be made vegan. at the end of the meal, she even gave my friend a vegan cupcake because she didn't want her to feel left out!! i will definitely have to come back again. ---------- Note: I don't actually know the meaning of "artisinal."

The food is soooooo good, it's worth putting up with the bad service. It's a very small restaurant, not a good idea for large groups. I take people here who are visiting from out of town. You almost cant find the restaurant from the outside because there's no sign. If you don't have the patience to wait for a table, you can get take out on some of their baked goods. I usually get a pot of tea and the creme brulee of the season (green tea matcha or ginger). The savory items aren't so good (my friends who've eaten there agree). The ambiance is very nice though and the restaurant (for hell's kitchen) is very clean. One of these days I'll do the chef's tasting menu which my friend swears by.

There's something unique and awesome happening here. Just go here. I promise you'll be glad you did. Kyotofu far surpasses other Japanese dessert bars because of its novel fusions of traditional American deserts and Japanese ingredients. They create desserts like silken tofu chocolate pudding, miso brownie, and green tea cup cakes that show a mastery of confections of both cultures. Bottom line, there's a really talented pastry chef behind this.

I've been a big fan of Kyotofu ever since my college days. Whenever I come back to visit NYC I always make a trip back here. The thing I love most about Kyotofu is their softserve and the flavors that change weekly. ?While I usually get their softserve to go, on my most recent trip we decided to stay and eat at the counter. ?We had the Hou Hou Shu Sparkling Sake which was expertly ordered by my sister who is a connoisseur on all things alcohol. ?I really enjoyed it and would highly recommend it. ?Next we tried the Lemonade Soft Serve. ?The good thing about dinning in is that the soft serve comes much better decorated with fruits, mochis, and syrups. ? Lastly, we ordered the winter anmitsu with the pear ginger sorbet. ?When it arrived, they had given us the kuromitsu (black sugar) ice cream by accident. ?The server was very kind and told us that we keep the kuromitsu sundae and that he'd bring us another pear ginger sorbet sundae. ?Two sundaes??!! Works for me!! ? ? ? ? ? ? The pear ginger sorbet was still the stand out. ?It was more unique and tasted pleasant and refreshing. ?The black sugar flavor was very nondescript. ? ? While Koyotfu is mainly a dessert bar, it has a lot more to offer than just things satisfy your sweet tooth. ?There's the full menu with some pretty good food options like sake braised pork belly, "pigs in a duvet", and kyotofu mac & cheese.

cute place. it's a bit small. the place does have a cozy feel to it, but we were sat in the corner where our table was too close to the people next to us so it was difficult for us to get out. interesting menu, bit on the pricey side but not ridiculous... good vegan options. for someone like me who isnt very picky, is willing to try cool new things/foods, and doesnt have food restrictions... i didnt find this place that amazing... not bad though.. would go again if others wanted.

I am a sugar junkie and probably eat enough dessert every week to send a healthy person into diabetic shock. So this review may be a bit biased. I started with pigs in a blanket to clear my palette and prep for two desserts--the black sesame panna cotta and tofu softserve ice cream. The pigs come with a mustard sauce (more Grey Poupon, less French's) and had a heavy but flakey crust. Tasted good but not exceptional. Next came the tofu softserve ice cream. Rich, creamy, no tofu aftertaste at all. Bits of butter pecan and small chunks of green tea mochi were sprinkled on top. It also came with two shot glasses containing a salty butterscotch icing-like cream and a berry compote. Being a traditional dessert lover I was on cloud 9. After working through this in 5 minutes flat the black sesame panna cotta came next. People who don't really like dessert will love this one. Only moderately sweet (tasted about as sweet as sour cream to me) I had to pour on the accompanying syrup to be able to enjoy this. Doubt if I'll order this again, but for all you high-brow, classy foodies this was made for you. As great a dessert experience as this was I ate so much so fast that I am now ?nauseous. UPDATE: Came back here on 5/6/2012 or ordered the tofu softserve ice cream again. The toppings were less impressive this time--a glass of chopped candied toasted pecans, green tea mochi cubes, and what tasted like a cranberry granola trail mix. The pecans were tasty. Mochi cubes more like stiff jello than soft chewy glutinous rice and the trail mix just tasted boring (I can buy that at Whole Foods). Took down a star for this good but less than spectacular dessert.

Kyotofu is probably the best dessert place to go to!! :) I haven't been to a dessert place like this before.. Went to dinner first and then since this place is famous for dessert.. I decided to come here for dessert only... Before heading into the restaurant.. I took a look at their menu and found out that they have a dessert tasting menu.. So I decided to do it with my friend.. First course.. the sweet tofu.. It reminds me of eating TofuFa.. but is a little sour and way sweeter than tofufa.. served in a small cup.. I love the service size because it's not too huge to enjoy.. sometimes when a dessert portion is huge.. you will feel disgusted.. well at least to me.. 2nd course.. it's a trio.. came with green tea creme br?l¨¦e, cheesecake, and a miso chocolate fudge cake? soy chocolate fudge cake.. kinda forgot.. but you can look at my photos.. My favorite is the chocolate cake, then green tea creme br?l¨¦e, and cheesecake.. the cheesecake has a little berry flavor in it.. nothing special.. I like the chocolate cake because it tasted a little salty, yet it does not cover the taste of the sweetness.. 3rd course: green tea chocolate and a cookie.. I love green tea.. but not green tea products.. the chocolate is way too thick for me.. for people who love green tea latte/green tea frappuccino, I can guarantee that you will love the green tea chocolate... Is good but I still prefer the traditional dark chocolate.. at least I get to try something different.. :) I ordered a pot of green tea.. they have lots of imported green tea.. 5 dollars for a pot is not expensive at all.. What else to ask for.. enjoying dessert and a pot of tea after dinner?? :) A guy that was sitting next to our table said that this place is usually pack.. but we were lucky enough to get a sit.. or maybe the night is still young.. :) They have soft serve ice-cream and many more dessert.. I will return again sometime.. :)

Gimmick? ? The tofu thing is nice and all, but if we are just going off of taste alone this place isn't that great. ?I had the Yuzu Citrus Tofu Cheesecake and I can honestly say I've had better market cheesecake for 1/4 the price. ?The fact that they're using tofu instead of some other ingredients should not be a crutch or excuse. ? I also had tastes of the Kuro Goma Sweet Tofu and Signature Sweet Tofu and it just wasn't my thing.

My dessert loving, lactose intolerant, borderline IBS friend from Cali was out here to visit me and I knew Kyotofu would be the perfect dessert place for her to try. ?It must have been fate because a few days after she told me she would be visiting, a Gilt City offer came up for a dessert sampler! ? We started off with sparkling sake which was crisp, cold and bubbly. ?Somehow it was the perfect compliment to these mini delights. ?Next came the sweet tofu, followed by green tea creme br?l¨¦e, almond rice pudding and a mini cake course, then chocolate chip cookies and mini chocolates on a stick. ?We also received two chocolate souffle cupcakes to-go. ?The sampler portions were the perfect size to get a taste of everything without getting to dessert overload. Everything was delicious, but the sweet tofu stood out amongst them all. ?My friend could not stop raving about it! ?She said it was one of the top three things on her gluttonous trip to NYC! ?Plus point for being soy based, so all of those who are lactose intolerant can enjoy some sinfully good desserts without the awful aftereffects.

Wow what a place for desserts. If you are eating here, the desserts are definitely multiple times better than the savory dishes they have. However, it is okay because you want to save every last amount of space in your stomach for their creative sweets. We used the Gilt City voucher to get their sampler set which included 3 courses: 1. Vanilla Sweet Tofu (x2) 2. Poached Apples w/ Soymilk Okayu, Pistachio Creme Brulee, Chocolate Brownie 3. Green tea chocolates on sticks with a cookie My favorites were easily the vanilla sweet tofu and the creme brulee. The sweet tofu came in a little cup and was served with a syrup. For the creme brulee, the top is a thin layer of candy like crust while on the bottom is a pistachio cream. It kinda tasted more like green tea but still, it tasted great. Not too sweet but just enough.

"Catch me in the kitchen like Kyotofu whippin pastries.." Ok it didn't really flow, but you gotta check this place out. Absolute must go to dessert place in the Theatre district. I'd stop by everyday if i lived closer. Super innovative asian fusion sweet tofu place. Very datey. I came here twice and I got the black sesame sweet tofu and the vanilla sweet tofu. Not only is presentation fabulous with their clean and classy plates and glasses, but the taste itself will knock you out. Being Chinese, I think this is the most innovative use of sweet tofu I've ever seen. The texture is actually very consistent throughout for both dishes, and they both have just the perfect amount of sweetness. Only downside is that the servings are kinda small and you might have to wait a while. I've always had a good time whenever I came here so definitely a good dessert place to try!

Yup, Asians can do dessert too. This place is a great concept. Dessert bar with great Asian flair. I love anything black seasame. Bit pricey but unique. Cupcakes aren't all that. Be adventurous and go with something with flair. Seating is tough and peeps need to stopping lingering over that last bite.

This place is wonderful. The decor is chic and the staff is so helpful and friendly. Came here for the first time last night with my boyfriend and we were both pleased with the service and the desserts we ordered. ? I got the green tea creme brulee and it was absolutely delicious! It had the perfect amount of sugar and it was so creamy. The pear sorbet was refreshing as well. You have to try the green tea creme brulee with a little bit of the sorbet and the oats. Loved the music selection...everything from Kanye West to Passion Pit =) Will definitely be back!

I like, I like! A lot! The desserts are so good, you could pick with your eyes closed and still be impressed. The flavors are so delicate - as is the presentation, and even the room itself. And yes, it is literally a room... The space is tiny but not too noisy, very dimly lit, and you kinda feel like you're in an egg. I haven't tried the food yet, but have high hopes for Kyotofu cuisine. The desserts cannot be passed up! I waited about 45 minutes... not sure why - but had no regrets. Pistachio creme brulee - must try. Vanilla sweet tofu - yes, please. I'd say to maybe stay away from the chocolate selections.. because they remind me of a typical 'lava cake.. warm chocolate sensation wowwies cake galor' that you can get anywhere really. Their chocolate cake will satisfy your need, but I'd say it's a waste of a trip to go for their chocolate cakes. To taste and learn the soft flavors of kyotofu, be adventurous!

3-course dessert sampler at Kyotofu in Hell's Kitchen. I've been meaning to check out Kyotofu out as a friend has mentioned it a number of times. Yay for Gilt City deals! $30 for a 3-course dessert sampler, sparkling sake, and take home cupcakes for two. First course: vanilla sweet tofu panna cotta. Sparkling rose sake with lovely floral flavors. Both were very refreshing. Especially nice after a long walk through Midtown. Second course: the dessert platter. Chocolate cake with sesame and miso something (I think... wasn't really paying full attention when they described it to us). It was okay. It's a chocolate cake. Tasted good, but wasn't anything special. The green tea creme brulee was delish. Comes with a haw berry on top. I'm a fan of Japanese green tea, and when you turn that into creme brulee... perfection. The intense green tea flavor weirded my husband out a little, but that's okay... more for me! The almond rice pudding with poached apples was tasty too. It wasn't too sweet, which made it more enjoyable. Third course: chocolate chip cookie with green tea infused white chocolate on the side. Nothing special about the cookie. The green tea chocolate looked small and delicate, but was really rich and packed with flavor. Everything was well presented. Service was great. It all looks very small, but it filled me up nicely. That nice, pleasant kind of full. Plus, the desserts were not too sweet. I'd like to come back for the brunch someday. I enjoyed the take home chocolate souffle cupcakes much more than the chocolate cake in the dessert platter. Placed it in the microwave for a few seconds to warm up. Melts in your mouth!

Green tea creme brulee and the warm chocolate cake with miso mochi were the two items that lay on the table before us. They were both constructed so...precisely. They both tasted so...pure. They were both exceptional...however, I wish they were a tad bit bigger :-/ I think they both came out to around $25 to $30 (collectively) and I could have gulped them down simultaneously! That didn't stop them from being delicious mind you ;-) The decor is very clean and modern, while the music is pretty...liberal! Just because you hear alternative music one second, doesn't mean you won't hear hip-hop the next. It's pretty awesome...something so simple...but it stands out to me. Too many place skate to one song and one song only. That ish cray!

When I switched my diet and was looking for veg plates to eat around the city I stumbled across Kyotofu. I had been very eager to eat here for a while and finally made it last night for dessert. My favorite part of any meal. I also follow Kyotofu on Twitter and you should too, @kyotofu. I tweeted that I would be coming for dessert and they were kind enough to make me a reservation for 7 PM. The eatery is so chic and clean cut. It looks very small and I wasn't aware there was a back room with more dining space. When you first enter they have barstool setting for those looking for a quick bite or something a little less formal. We were brought to table in the back even though we were just having dessert. As you make your way to the backroom of this eatery, you walk by the tiny kitchen. There is a glass window and you are able to see everything being made. I love this ... sometimes, other times ignorance is bliss. But as we were passing by the chef was plating a dessert and I felt like a kid again who had to stop and look at the puppy in the window. After being seated and looking at the menu, I wanted to order one of each. Self control Lauren, say it with me. I did already pick out one item we were having but I said we should probably get two items. After hearing the run down of the most popular items, I kindly asked Leticia to pick, as she never has before! She decided to go with the soymilk soft ice cream sundae ?and I went with the warm sweet potato cake. Within minutes our goodies were brought to the table. The presentation was beautiful and before it was even placed in front of me I was already eating the food with my eyes. I wasn't sure which one to dig into first, but I went with the ice cream. The sundae was a twist of green tea and vanilla accompanied by winter fruit compote, matcha mochi and vegan caramel. Just having a bite of the green tea and vanilla was enough to win me over. The green tea flavor was so potent, so flavorful, ?so delicious. the mochi reminded me of gummy bears but gone healthy. We topped the sundae off with the caramel which really brought the entire dessert together. The warm sweet potato cake, NOM! My friend was really excited about the cinnamon ice cream and she made sure that when I went in for a bite that I got it with the pecans. Wow. The ice cream was topped with a little wafer cracker that reminded me of eating an ice cream cone. And the cake, I know it says it in the name but yes it was warm and that's what made it award winning. Hints of sweet potato and cinnamon danced around on my palate. The kicker here was a bite with the cake and ice cream together. It was hard to figure out which one was fighting for your attention more, the heat or the bitter cold. But both played nicely together in my mouth! For those of you who are opposed or have never tried soy ice cream, head here. One would never know and its packed full of flavor. The service was great and our waiter was more than helpful with the menu. We were also brought over complimentary tea biscuits at the end, which were dense and buttery. A bite of love. I also can't forget to mention how good it smelled in there. I would love to have dinner here sometime soon because I couldn't stop commenting on how delicious the smell was. I would love an air freshener like that for my apartment!

Food: This place is super hyped up for what it is. I got the Prix fixe dessert menu and they were all just bleh. I don't need to mention any of their dishes because they were pretty bad. Service: Service by that guy with the tattoo was pretty bad. His face expression looked like he was escorting us to hell. It took forever to take our order and they never come to check up on us. Only time they came quick was when we were done with our food. Ambiance: I'll give credit to this... It's nice and small with dim lights. Cost: Very expensive for the good for nothing/tiny serving you receive. ***Really, why is this place 4stars, what is everyone smoking?? Please share. Thanks***

With a modern decor to this itty bitty venue, the very pleasant staff makes up for it for they lack in room. Came here on a GiltCity deal for a 3 course dessert sampling with a glass of sake and a take home cupcake. I was blown away from start to finish and stuffed beyond belief. We began with a very nice floral sparkling sake, tofu in shot glasses, followed by green tea creme brulee, almond rice pudding and mini cake course and last but not least came out the green tea chocolates and chocolate chip cookie... Pace yourselves folks, despite the portions looking small, it's so packed with flavor you'll never want to eat again. And the take home cupcake.... it barely made it home. Can't wait to go back and try their brunch.

This was my first time here and I wasn't sure what to expect. Kyotofu is a really quaint place and it is neat that there is a seating area for sit-down savory food as well as a bar like area if you just wanted desserts. Also, their kitchen/prep area was windowed and it was neat to watch them get items together. We had their pre-fixe menu for two which was definitely worth it. We got to try a little bit of everything and man was it good. Although it was all good, my favorite dish was the first one - the signature sweet tofu. It reminded me of something I grew up with (Tofu-fa Chinese) but with a little tweak. And man, Kyotofu did it good! The tofu was so silky and smooth, I don't know how they do it, but it was sooo yummy. The ratio of sauce sweetness to the amount of tofu was perfect. I'd definitely get this again. Kyotofu was a little pricey for dessert BUT it was SO WORTH IT. Very good. When I'm back in NYC, I'll come here for their sweet tofu as well as to try their warm mochi chocolate cake (sounds really appealing). Their service was really attentive and friendly too! Definitely a plus. TIP: We sat in the front since we only wanted dessert. But as I mentioned there was a very cute sit-down area too. People who walked in had reservations. And it looked like their sit-down was filled quickly, so if you want to eat here be sure to call ahead of time and make a reservation.

The place is tiny but has a very ?warm, cozy ambiance. We ordered a warm mushroom salad which was delicious, a tofu burger with taro chips which was good too and a warm chocolate mochi cake which was absolutely DIVINE! We also tried the sweet potato cake which was a bit too sweet to our taste. Overall rating would be 4* for food and 3* for the service.

Maybe it was because of the great reviews I read on yelp made me have high expectations of the place. When I actually went and tried the food, I felt like it was a little over-rated. I went there for the first time this past week. My experience was average. Maybe it was because I didn't have the right food. Me and my friend had the following... Appetizer: trio of tofu dips Main entree: Sake braised pork belly & cha soba noodles Dessert: kuro goma sweet tofu ?& tofu panna cotta neopolitan The appetizer was light. As for the main entree, the cha soba noodles tasted exceptionally BLAND. There was no taste and my friend was desperately in need of salt/soy sauce. The pork belly was very tasty and perhaps the best of the night. I really liked the desserts, but was somewhat disappointed. The tofu desserts were not new to me. I had tofu desserts ever since I was born? They resembled a lot like the tofu desserts you can get in Chinatown for under $5.

Ended a mini food crawl at this trendy little dessert place near the theater district. ?The black sesame sweet tofu item was very creative and tasty! ?Would not have thought tofu could be used to achieve a panna cotta-like consistency but they did a great job. ?The sesame flavor is similar to a black sesame soup you'd get at a cantonese dessert shop, while the green tea syrup on the side adds more flavored sweetness to taste. ?The little cup of Kome Kome sake pairing tasted like juice, and didn't seem to have much alcohol at all in it though. Gotta come back next time I visit! (This place sort of reminds me of Candy Bar in SF, but smaller, no board games, and equally creative yet tastier desserts.)

I am sensitive to MSG and I know this place uses MSG in their food. When I dined there, I had an appetizer, main course and dessert before I got sick, so I can't say exactly where they are putting it, but I do like their chocoloate souffle and have had that since without getting sick, so if you got problems with MSG, stay away from their food. As for whether the food was delicious or not, I am not even going to bother because it is not worth being sick for three days.

This place is okay, I went here with my friend to try their dessert.. One thing to note, there is not store sign that states this location, so you have to be on the right side of street, otherwise you'll be walking in circles. Getting into the table was also a tight squeeze, you share space with other people in a close space. I spent the evening staring at my friend's soymilk ice cream desert. I also was staring at other customer's food, but then my friend reminded me that staring is rude, though can it be helped? I had wanted to try this place after reading a review from a food blog with a delicious looking anmitsu, and what a strange taste this dish is. I am not a fan of salty to a sweet desert, the mochi was also kinda doughy tasting, though I normally love mochi as a food. I think the best thing was the sorbet. Agar was tasting also pretty funny. Their menu changes with the seasons, so I went with their winter menu. This is a pretty chic trendy place. The price is not cheap though. The lighting is a bit on the dim side, so I was not as impressed., if it wanted to create a romantic atmosphere. Also I was surprise to note that the chef in this spot is not Japanese. So my opinion as of now is this is a trendy fusion spot. One thing to note if I ever make a return trip here again, come here during the daytime, and order other items than the anmitsu, along with an actual drink instead of their filtered yet delicious tap water.

This may be my new favorite dessert place because it is open late, cute and has some tasty food. I was sick again last night when I wanted to meet up with a friend for drinks, major fail, alcohol and antibiotics don't mix well, so we went for creative. Coffee shops in the Hell's Kitchen/Midtown West area ALL CLOSE at approximately 7 PM, except for a few that just aren't very good. Upon deciding that we needed dessert, I stumbled upon Kyotofu. We walked in and it was incredibly crowded, at 10 PM on a Wednesday night (really?). Given, it is a small restaurant we ended up getting seats at the bar. They have an interesting selection of teas that are not too overpriced and very interesting desserts. Ultimately, we ended up with the sweet potato pancake and cinnamon ice cream dessert and another ice cream dish that we got because we wanted to try something new and didn't know what any of the ingredients were in it :) The sweet potato pancake was fantastic and clearly our favorite of the two. I hate dessert for the most part and would go back for that. They had this green, orange, ginger tea which to me read: drink this if you are sick, so I did, but my friends did not have anything to drink. Overall, the waiter said the food was really good, even though we were only ordering dessert so I want to go check that out. It is a cozy environment just out of the way of Times Square in a nondescript building. Go check it out ...at least once. The best part was that it was about the same price if not, cheaper than the drinks we would have gotten instead :)

I love that they deliver and I love their containers. Aside from that, I don't think the desserts are *that* revolutionary, but maybe that's also because I lived in Asia for a while. Their pistachio creme brulee was warm.. but it tasted very nutty. I really liked my sesame tofu (which is basically a flan), and I thought the vanilla sweet tofu was eh. ? We were pretty full from dinner so this was a nice, light way to end the night.

Had: green tea cr¨¨me br?l¨¦e yuzu citrus tofu cheesecake Pink Hou Hou Shu Sparkling Sake Pros: Delicious : very subtle flavors/combos. Texture: I'm in the camp that dessert is 75% texture. Achieved. The cr¨¨me br?l¨¦e was just that and the cheesecake as well. Sake: Gonna replace the new years champagne with this. Crisp. Detail: Sake glasses/ dessert spoons/ presentation were spot on. Servers/Managers: A+ Cons: One bathroom.

I love this place!! ?It's so good, it's so cute, and it has such a good relaxing atmosphere! I actually came here awhile ago and realized that I had not reviewed it right away! ?But I remember my friend and I raving about it and saying we are definately coming back. ?We had a variety plate of desserts. ?All which were so good!!! ?Asian's usually do not like their sweets SWEET! ?so this was enjoyable because my pallete was not overwhelmed with sugar! ? good..because we devoured it quickly!

I've been here several times, usually with a Gilt certificate though I have gotten taken at least a couple times. Last time I went was for drinks and apps, bartender was very friendly and helpful. Drinks were okay, get sake instead, food and desserts are always good though I wish there was more to the menu or it had some new items. The mac and cheese, chicken and tofu sliders and pigs in a blanket are all yummy. Chamame was disappointing. Also enjoy the cupcake they send me home with. A little on the pricey side for small portions so I usually what for a discount.

Excellent, excellent, excellent! Excellent for having dinner, excellent for stopping there to get desert after dinner or have drink (although last time they ran out of Nigori Sake... or we were probably on our 20th bottle but they are tiny bottles but delicious) I love their black sesame ice cream desert... my favorite desert there. The green tea cr¨¨me br?l¨¦e, warm mochi chocolate cake, and tofu panna cotta neopolitan are also some of my favorites... The desert omakase (or KAISEKI) is great although I think I prefer selecting my favorite one on the menu. For dinner, the Mac & Cheese is excellent - not too greasy but creamy

tried the kura goma sweet tofu with black sesame sweet tofu panna cotta, hoji-cha syrup, and white sesame tuile. its really nice to see the use of black sesame in dessert. refreshing dish. anyway, this place is famous for their signature sweet tofu with vanilla & kuromitsu syrup, black sesame & hoji-cha syrup. it should be the first dessert consumed because the flavors are rather subtle. the yuzu citrus tofu cheesecake with almond meringue & macerated berries is very good. the yuzu plays a key role in enhancing the flavors of the almond & berries. finally, the various matcha green tea cookies. they're just interesting, but nothing special. its so fun to be here, but you can't sit here and just share dishes. they require one dish with a minimum of $15 per person. so its not cheap to just sit. you have to order a lot to stay for sure. 3.5

Oooh the yummy buzz I had when I walked out... My friend and I ordered the three-course dessert tasting menu for two, and lapped up every last morsel. ?The green tea cr¨¨me br?l¨¦e was my favorite, and I also loved the warm chocolate cake with miso mochi and the vanilla sweet tofu. ?The last course came with a teeny tiny strawberry macaron and, while I give them points for style, the macaron was not as high quality as the rest of their selections. ?I paired the tasting menu with the suggested champagne, which had bubbly notes of toasted brioche, and was the perfect complement to the sweet barrage. ?It was a little pricey, but in line with what you'd expect from a trendy Japanese dessert spot. ? The service was sweet and attentive, and the atmosphere was a balance of modern lines with soft lighting that gave it a cozy and intriguing feel. ?Perfect for a first date.

Came here with a friend for apitizers, drinks, and desserts. It was a Thursday around 5pm and it wasn't busy at all, we were seated right away. The decor was cute and the restaurant itself was actually pretty small. Our server was a little off, not sure if thats his personality or if he was having a bad day but nonetheless he was attentive. He got my friends order wrong and to make up for it he gave us free cookies which were delicious. The warm sweet potato cake, warm chocolate cake withmiso mochi, and kyotofumac & cheese were all pretty good but I especially enjoyed the chicken & tofu burgers (juicy!), creamy shrimp & tofu croquettes (delicious!), and pistachiocr¨¨me br?l¨¦e (my favorite dessert, creamy & not too sweet). We also had the pomegranate shiso mojito which I didn't really like :-( it was soooo weak it tasted like juice and I'm no alcoholic. I was glad to see we were charged half off for the drink since it was happy hour because $11 for a weak mojito is lame. Overall I had an enjoyable experience and I would return. I'm not big on sweets or desserts but I'll make an exception for Kyotofu :-)

OMG i freakin' LOVE this place. ?Look on my profile under "Things I love..." ?You will find that TOFU is listed as one of the things i LOVE. ?Who knew tofu can be made into delicious desserts that will knock my socks off?! So, i tried the KURO GOMA SWEET TOFU ($8), which translates to: ?black sesame sweet tofu panna cotta, hoji-cha syrup (tastes like simple syrup), white sesame truile. ? OMG this is so good. It's like a black sesame silken soft tofu dessert that isn't too sweet. ?If you're Chinese and you've tried "dofu hua" or "dofu fah," it tastes like a fancy version of that with flavors of black sesame. ? Pretty much everything here was delicious. ?But all my friends agreed that my dessert (the Kuro Goma Sweet Tofu) was the best. ?We also tried: -Winter Anmisu -Pistacio Creme Brulee -Warm Sweet potato cake (least appetizing that I've tried) -Tri of Tofu Dips (includes pecan miso, edamame, and wasabi tofu dips accompanied by house made flatbread) ?LOVED this unique appetizer. ?A good alternative if you're not into sweets. This is a MUST STOP shop if you're in the New York area. I cannot wait to go back. Until then, i'll be dreaming of tofu dessert heaven. :P

Green tea fudge: Melt in your mouth good. Very rich and not something that I could eat a lot of. Unmistakably ?and overwhelmingly green tea. So, if you aren't really into green tea, you may not appreciate it. Almond financiers; Delicious and buttery tasting. Tiny with a crispy rice bottom. Chocolate suffle cupcake: Good, but needs to be eaten with something like a vanilla bean gelato. I wouldn't say it is the best cupcake in New York. Miso brownies: Yum! Very dense and rich. These and the almond financiers were my favorite. Green tea cupcakes: Good, but not amazing. Maybe a little dry. Vanilla cupcakes: Unique vanilla flavor, but not great.

The d¨¦cor is so pretty! Love the all white/headboard looking couches. We had to change our reservations like 4 times but they were super accommodating and we were seated almost instantly when we arrived. I've heard such good things about Kyotofu so I was super excited to try EVERYTHING. 1. Started with the Kirakira (champagne with blackberry puree and a lychee). This is like if a bellini and mimosa had super babies! It was light and fruity plus I loved eating the champagne soaked lychee at the end. It was so good I got two before we even got our entrees. 2. Our third friend was running a little late so we split the Pigs In A Duvet while waiting for her to arrive. I love the name! It is such a NYC spin on pigs in a blanket. The puff pastry is flaky on the outside but doughy on the inside. The mustard is pretty strong though, so I wouldn't suggest covering the piggies like I did my first bite. They also sit on top of little rounds of cucumbers that provide a crispiness and lightness to the dish. 3. My friend and I both got the Sake Braised Pork Belly, while the third got the Kyotofu Mac & Cheese. The portions are huge!! I got like 5/6 slices of pork belly, gave one to my friend who had the mac & cheese and was still really satisfied with the portion size! The carrot pickles that came with the pork belly are really yummy as well, but I am obsessed with pickled things so this could be a bit biased. The mac & cheese is amazingly creamy and cheesy. Loved it...but this is also because I love gruyere and TRUFFLES - best fungus ever! There is an option to get it w/ or w/out pancetta - get it with! Definitely worth the extra $2. 4. We were pretty stuffed when it came to ordering dessert, but Kyotofu is known for their desserts so we obviously had to try it. We asked the waitress if splitting the dessert sampler between the 3 of us was enough and she suggested getting another full dessert. This is definitely unnecessary! We couldn't finish any of the desserts and I have the biggest dessert stomach ever! 5. We ordered the full size order of the Kuro Goma Sweet Tofu. The black sesame flavor is to die for! But the hoji-cha syrup was too sweet for my liking. 6. The sampler came with the Fresh Ginger Cr¨¨me Brulee, Miso chocolate brownie, Kabocha Spice Sweet Tofu and Soymilk ice cream. My favorite was actually the soymilk ice cream! I adore soymilk and this one kinda reminded me of Momofuku Milk Bar's cereal milk ice cream - sweet, creamy and light. My dinner companions both picked the ginger cr¨¨me brulee as their favorite. I'm not a huge fan of ginger flavored things but I actually really enjoyed the cr¨¨me brulee. The flavor wasn't too overpowering, so if you're skeptical of ginger flavored things, fear not and order it! The chocolate brownies were warm and melt in your mouth chocolate-y, I love when you get that warm gooey feeling when you eat chocolate desserts! Delish. A very enjoyable meal! ?I just wished the waitress didn't push for the full size dessert with our sampler because I cried a little (read a lot) on the inside when we had to leave our table of desserts unfinished.

Coming into Kyotofu was one of high expectations. I came with several friends after dinner somewhere else in high hopes of the great myths and stories I have heard about their delicious desserts. ? ATMOSPHERE: The restaurant itself was very intimate and pushed for a fine dining vibe. The lighting was dim and tried to decor with trendy designs and furniture. ?It is definitely a good place to take someone out on a date. ?Coming in through the front, you have to walk through the kitchen and so they are showcasing how their chefs and cooks are making everything fresh, by hand and take pride in their craftsmanship and culinary skills. ? FOOD: Was pretty good! I've heard people say it was "different" Which I can totally see. They are taking a stab at turning some things into their own style which I give props and credit to. The tofu desserts are actually very common in the Asian culture and we have a more dumbed down cheaper ?version we sell on the markets called "Xing Ren Tofu" with ginger and honey. I had ordered one of the two tofu desserts and I believe it was the kuro gama tofu which is the black sesame tofu panna cotta and it was pretty good and had a interesting taste to it. My friend had the chocolate cake but after having the tofu, it just doesn't taste as good lol. SERVICE: Was pretty on the spot and waited on you decently. Pretty good service If I do say so myself. They greeted you and made sure you were comfortable and had everything you need. ? SUMMARY: Great place for a date and good desserts. I haven't tried their dinner menu but by the looks of some of the food it looks like worth a try. Definitely try their tofu as it is in their name and I will definitely come back a few times!

I came here for dessert the other night with a friend and was so happy with our experience. ?The restaurant was fairly quiet when we arrived; accordingly, we were seated promptly and waited on attentively throughout the evening. ?Our server was really friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu items: I asked her which of the desserts were vegan, and she kindly filled me in. ? I ordered the soymilk ice cream sundae, which came with fresh fruit and chocolate cookie crumbles. ?It was out of this world. ?I've eaten a lot of vegan ice cream in the city, and I wouldn't hesitate to say that Kyotofu's vanilla soft serve is THE BEST. ?Topped with bits of mochi, peaches, and blueberries -- I will be dreaming about this dessert for weeks to come. My friend's dessert wasn't vegan, so I chose not to taste it, but it looked spectacular: a blueberry yuzu crumble, bursting with fresh blueberries. ?He said it was delicious. I'd love to come back here some time for dinner and tea, but even for an abbreviated evening, Kyotofu was an amazing place. ?The ambiance is good, the service was great, and the food was incomparable.

Kyotofu is probably one of the main things I'll miss about living in Hells Kitchen. ?I love this place. ?Though I've never actually sat down for a meal, their soy milk yogurt is one of my favs. ?They always have interesting flavors like green tea and black sesame, and they have great mochi topping as well. ?Everyone inside is always so nice, and there always seems to be a good crowd. ?I wish they'd open another location or that soy milk yogurt would catch on at other places around the city.

Oh man..i was totally let down by this place. ?I ordered the bento box. ?My eyes were big with anticipation until I took a bite of thier tofo. ?Yuck. ?The sauce was too strong and the consistancy was off putting (kinda like flan). ?Okay..let me try something else..the tofu chicken slider! ?Yuck..the consistancy of that was offputting too. ?Mush in a bun with a very strong sauce. ? Darnit! ?Okay..next..pigs in a blanket. ?Yum..Guess it's hard to mess up those. ?Next..Pork Belly. ?Although very good...waaaayy too salty. ?The drinks are 50 percent off after 5pm..and I thought it was just okay. ?The best part was the warm mushroom salad. ?I wanted to lick the bowl. ? Okay..I decided to take thier chocolate cupcake home..since there is a sign out front stating that it's NY best cupcake. ?I unwrapped my package when I got home..once again my eyes were big with anticipation. ?Took a big bite. ?Ugh..Heavy dense chocolate that's dry and too sweet. ?yuck. ?Best cupcake my azz. ?

Having never tried anmitsu, I was a happy girl when I saw that they had it on the menu. Winter anmitsu with kuromitsu ice cream, pear and cranberry agar, azuki and matcha shirotama. If I wasn't so stuffed with curry rice from my previous meal, I think I would have gone for a second order of the anmitsu. Just. Wonderful. Oh, oh, definitely try the bakery sampler as well. Matcha nama chocolate is heaven. The only thing is that the place is pretty small. Maybe that's considered big for New York standards but since I'm from Boston, I thought it was really hard to get around. Or hey, maybe I was just too stuffed to drag my winter coat and bag and my gigantic body onto those sofa seats. Oh well.

I was skeptical about this place because its all based on tofu. ?But after dinner in hells kitchen on a thursday night, it was a close location and still open at 10 pm. ? I recently started drinking tea and Kyotofu has an extensive tea list, along with other drinks like sake, wines, etc. ? Desserts were really good. ?We had 6 at our table so ended up getting 6 different things. ?I have to say that the Chocolate Cake and the Creme Brulee were the best. ?They do have a minimum number of orders that must be placed for groups so we were "forced" to order more than needed. ?But the waiter had some good recommendations. They do have this one dish that comes with three different "sauces". ?One of the sauce is a spicy chocolate dip. ?It's strange. ?tastes just like chocolate but after a second it tastes like spicy peppers. ?Not a big fan of it but it was a unique experience. ? The location is good but the venue is pretty small. ?I would say it seats 25 people in total? ?maybe 5 more in the front on bar stools. ?Call ahead to see if they have any available seating.

I love their food and that's why I was thrilled when they were on the "google offer". I bought two of them for $39 (3 dessert course + 2 drinks). I was deeply disappointed because: 1. They were extremely small portions, smaller than their regular dessert pieces. I felt cheated because it was supposedly $60 in real value. 2. Waiter was obviously rushing us and rude to us because we were using the "google offer" while he was nice to other regular customers. We were also charged the tip at the regular price on our check. I don't think his service deserved that. I wish that they would treat their customers better for the price that they charge.

After scrolling through page after page of "Restaurant" near "Hell's Kitchen" (I know, that really slims it down, huh?) on my iPhone Yelp app, I settled on the solid four star Kyotofu for dinner for me and two friends. We got right in after 9 pm on a Saturday night, only a five minute wait in the cozy front bar/lounge area. The restaurant is kind of split into two sides, the front lounge part, with sleek, white tabletops and ambient lighting and a darker, back room with dark, wood tables and smooth, cream leather bench seating. Both sections are on the smaller side, which lends to an intimate feel. I liked it. There was maybe 4-5 seating areas in the front, and another 10 or so in the back. The menu rotates seasonally, so it's hard to say that what I loved will be there for you next time you visit. But what will likely still be around is the quality of preparation and presentation, so you shouldn't be disappointed! They have a decent drink menu and a variety of sake to choose from, as well as sake flights, which we didn't try. We started with an order of tofu-pork sliders. A-MAZING! I'm getting hungry just thinking about them. There was a small side of mini sweet potato chips included. Very cute. We also got a round of drinks, a variation on the lychee martini for one friend and I, and then a sort of coconut cocktail for the other. We all agreed that the lychee martini was superior to the sour tasting coconut drink, although it still wasn't horrible. For the main course, two of us got braised pork belly and the other mac and cheese. I know - mac and cheese at a Japanese restaurant? Huh? But it was good! It was very subtle and light tasting, which a nice spiciness in the finish. I really liked the one bite I tried. It also came with a side salad of greens. Looked good! As for the pork belly, my friend and I were in gluttony heaven (not an oxymoron). That pork was SO delicious. So moist. So tender. So full of juicy, robust flavor. It was divine. It came with a side of rice. The portions here appear small at first, but when you finish eating, you realize just how perfectly full and content you are. Service was excellent - there when you needed them, not when you didn't. The waitress was very cordial and knowledgeable of the menu and willing to make suggestions if needed. I would totally go back to Kyotofu - not just because I liked it so much, but because I didn't get to try any of the deserts - which appeared just as (if not more) enticing as the dinner. A table next to us showed up after 10 pm just for desert - so you know that it must be good. As for pricing, after all was said and done, splitting an appetizer, getting one drink and entree each, with tax and about 20% tip, cost ran about $45 a person. Not bad at all, by NYC standards and well worth it in my opinion. Give them a try! And then go back for desert. PS: They do offer take out, I watched a couple people pick up as we waited for our table.

My husband and I went to Kyotofu for dessert and were pleasantly surprised at how much ambiance this place had---can be a very cute but casual date place. ? I ordered the kuro goma sweet tofu which was delicious, and tasted a lot like the black sesame dessert I often get in those Hong Kong dessert places in SF. ?But of course, here at Kyotofu the presentation is far prettier, price tag far steeper, and mood far sexier. My husband couldn't decide between the anmitsu or the poached apple and asked the waitress for some guidance. ?She said that the poached apple is one of the most popular dishes but the anmitsu is her personal favorite. Upon encouragement from both me and the waitress, my husband chose the anmitsu. ? To this day he still regrets not looking up what anmitsu really was before ordering, because it ended up being a bowl of jellies with ice cream. ?I can see how someone might enjoy the subtle flavors of jellies, but my husband wanted a real dessert, as in something sweet and rich. ? We also ordered an iced barley tea that was so refreshing and tasty and different that we decided to make some ourselves once we go home.

Very pleasant ambiance mid afternoon on a bustling Friday during the holiday season. ?Tiny dessert samplings, served with different full leaf tea, make for a sugar-infused experience, using tofu as a base for some of the cakes and custards. ?Knowledgeable staff, but dessert tasting with sparkling sake for two is pricey and skimpy.

I went Friday night around 1130/midnight to Kyotofu. We sat at the bar. We had to wait a while for menus, then we had to wait a long while for the server to come take our order. We ordered the chocolate miso cake and I mentioned that I wanted to order bakery to go items. When we finished the cake, we had to wait an extremely long time for the server to come over. I tried several times to make eye contact with him, but eventually had to flag him down from behind the register. I ordered the items I wanted (mini cupcakes, cupcake, and genmaicha sakura fananciers). He gave me shortbread cookies instead and argued with me over what I had chosen, even though when I ordered I had pointed to the physical item in the case. He was quick about switching to the correct item, but I just felt miffed. Maybe because I was with my younger sister, and we were the youngest pair in the crowd, he figured we were only ordering one thing and no drinks, so it wasn't worth his time? I live in DC and always come to Kyotofu when I'm in the area. I've been three other times and service was great. This was the first time I took my younger sister there (we were in NYC to celebrate her graduation) and she didn't get the experience I wanted her to. Every other time I've gone, the food has been great and delicious, regardless if it's just stopping in for some soft-serve, brunch, or to-go snacks.

Tip: ?Make reservations. This place is very interesting. ?The desserts are very delicate in flavor and nothing is too sweet or sticky. ?It's very Asian in that regard but very new-wave in that they fuse unconventional flavors to make amazing little confectionaries and delectables. My recommendations are the green tea creme brulee and also the chocolate cake. ?Yum!

So amazing I have to update this review...Chinh T. and Sally C. bought a google offer for $30 for a three course sampler of desserts and sake, which we shared among four people. The sparkling sake was among the best I've had because it was light and slightly sweet. Loved it. We also had the green tea creme brulee, a variety of cakes, a black sesame tofu, and the chocolate chiffon muffin. Out of everything, I'd suggest trying the black sesame tofu and the chocolate chiffon muffin from the front of the store. Also, the soft serve soymilk is SO GOOD! I personally love anything soy and the consistency and flavor of the soft serve is excellent. I am definitely going to miss this place a ton when I move away from NY!

Last time I was here, I was a sophomore in college. The food is just as esquite from what I remember. The meal is entirely light. If you're looking for a hearty meal, this is not the place. I really enjoyed the desert sampler paired with a glass of champagne. My favorite was the vanilla sweet tofu: vanilla sweet tofu panna cotta, kuromitsu syrup and black sesame tuile. An older, yet hip crowd. The music was cool, I believe they played 'Big Pimpin' right before a Kenny G piece.

I recently found out about this and decided to give it a try last night. Nice cozy spot and I liked how the space was divided into a bar area vs a ?table area. We sat at the bar since it was way more quiet. Since it was right after dinner, we only ordered Kuro Goma Sweet tofu ?(black sesame sweet tofu panna cotta) and Chicken/tofu sliders with sweet potato chips. I really liked the sliders despite their teeny tiny sizes. It had many different flavors that worked together so well. I just wished they were a little bigger. haha Sweet tofu was also delicious. I added little bit syrup for each spoonful of tofu and it was yummy~~ The bar area was pretty empty when we got there around 8:30pm on a Thursday night. It's definitely easier to grab seats when you have a smaller group.

Always friendly and attentive staff. ?Their little wooden spoons are adorable. Their dessert menu changes with the seasons. Unfortunately, I found out they no longer have the coveted green tea creme brulee. I've been trying to get a hold of it for about a year *insert big sad face here* Please bring it back!!!!! My very first visit, I have the regular sweet tofu panna cotta. It was different from the traditional sweet tofu I was used to (chinese style with sweet ginger syrup). I enjoyed the tofu but I was not a big fan of the syrup (forgot what it was). It was a bit of a turn off, but I decided to give it another try. The spiced pumpkin sweet tofu panna cotta, sage infused syrup, pistachio tuile was a nice autumn treat. I love anything pumpkin. Yummy. The black sesame sweet tofu panna cotta, hoji-cha syrup, white sesame tuile was my favorite out of the three. It was a perfect balance, and the hoji-cha syrup matched it very well. Lavender tea, meh, I could have done without. Smells great for soap and stuff, not so much tea. Short bread cookies are delicious as well! Comes with different flavors: original, green tea, and black sesame. Loveeee.

COOL AMBIANCE WITH GREAT DESSERT! Japanese-inspired desserts that are finger-lickin good. I ordered the warm chocolate cake with lavendar tea and my friend ordered the poached apples with rice pudding and ginger tangerine green tea. All were DELICIOUS! I liked my chocolate cake the most. It's a great place to go with a date or even with your close girlfriends. But because the place is a bit small, I wouldn't recommend going with a group larger than four.

Lunch bento box is like a little bit of everything on the menu... including soup of the day x 1, pork sausage x 5, pork belly x 2, mini burger x 1, rice roll x 1, homemade chips x many, salad x a few, and some custard-like-not-sweet-at-all dessert x 1. Super nice but too much for me... and too much meat... Taste is okay. Pork belly is good. Ordered black sesame sweet tofu. Taste okay. The tofu texture was good. Coming in 2PM, I'm the only one sitting there. Service is sweet (and yea... it's slow). Bought 1 x pack of mini cupcakes and 2 x pack of mini cakes to-go. The waiter gave me cupcakes for free!

I should have came here for dessert instead of dinner. The dinner menu has very limited offering. I ended up ordering a mac and cheese and my husband asked for curry rice. I can see this as a special place for dating. We had black sesame panna cotta. It was good but it was pricy.

when my friend first told me about the restaurant, i thought it was a very interesting concept. We headed over for dessert and i was expecting ... a lot. maybe that was not such a good idea. The decor was very nice and clean and the service was great. however, I wish the server knew more about each dish instead of going to ask the chef every time we had a question about the food. We got the black sesame tofu dessert and the assorted pastry. the kuro goma tofu was delicious and PLEASE DON"T ADD THE SUGAR SYRUP ON THE SIDE! it's awesome the way it is. the assorted pastry was alright. brownie with miso was an interesting concept but not my favorite. green tea pudding/jello was good but strange at the same time. at the end of the meal, we got some nice little pastry to take home, which was a nice touch but we were too full. i had those for breakfast and they were delicious and good small portion. the only thing i guess is that it's a bit much for my student budget I think. they have a brunch menu too. might try that next time if i save up a bit. the brunch menu comes with choice of bellini, tea/coffee,

What an amazing concept! My wife and I are not drinkers, so after dinner we are always looking for a place we can have cappucino and dessert with a decent atmosphere. There are other bake shops and coffee shops, but many of them close early, or just don't have a great scene. This place was perfect. They do have a bar, so they stay open much later, and they offer other food items besides desert, which we will definitely return to try, but we split their soy milk ice cream sundae which was fantastic, and got our cappucinos in a "sit down" experience which was terrific. We are also health conscious, so the vegan and soy options were much appreciated. They have some tofu desserts that looked awesome. Highly recommend!

I had the kuro goma sweet tofu which is a dessert mimicking a black sesame tofu. The black sesame is very subtly sweet and the pana cotta is rich. To balance out the sweetness there's a syrup with a tinge of hoji-cha green tea, which wasn't very sweet either and the tea taste is incredible. Make sure to use the syrup with the the tofu. They also have a white sesame biscuit, which I didn't care much for, but the rest of the dish is amazing. The waitress is very friendly, helpful and super active (although she doesn't have much of a sweet tooth, so if she says something is sweet, it's probably not). I'm docking it a star because it's quite pricey for a dessert. tl;dr - if you love asian desserts, the kuro goma sweet tofu is perfect and delicious

This is my second 5-star review given! Kyotofu was simply heavenly! The first time I was here with some friends ... the wait was 40 minutes long. We were really lucky today to be greeted by a half-empty Kyotofu! My fellow sweets-loving friend and I wanted so desperately to try out its green tea creme br?l¨¦e but its current winter dessert bar menu does not include this highly raved about item! When we were told that their KAISEKI prix fixe (for two) had the green tea creme br?l¨¦e as one of its three dessert courses, we immediately ordered it! First course: Vanilla Silken Tofu - this was such a slick dessert. Not too sweet. Perfect texture! Second course: Caramelised apple slices with crumble + Rice pudding + Green tea creme br?l¨¦e + chocolate lava cake with sesame raspberry sauce - every single item on this platter was delicious! The green tea creme br?l¨¦e did not disappoint! The chocolate lava cake even had a thin layer of hard caramel around it ... together with the sesame raspberry sauce - splendid without words. Third course: Matcha chocolate bars on stick + Vanilla Macaroon - Being a massive macaroon fan, I screamed when I saw the macaroon. Very pleasant surprise! The matcha chocolate was very delicious - chocolatey enough with a strong matcha flavour (which is a really delicate balance to achieve). The macaroon was really fine, especially so for a place which does not specialise in making macaroons. We paid around $18 per person (incl. tax and tip) for the prix frix. Worth every penny considering the wide variety of dessert items presented! The portions were small enough for you to feel amazed and still get enough of each exquisitely delightful dessert course. Desserts-lovers, you will absolutely fall in love with Kyotofu's Frenchie desserts with a Japanese twist.

I took my mom and sister here and we are all very familiar with Japanese deserts. I was hoping their tofu desert would match what we had in Kyoto. It didn't, but overall we had a good experience. Matcha Green Tea Cr¨¨me Br?l¨¦e with seasonal sorbet, vanilla bean tuile @@@@@ The Matcha creme brulee was sooo good. The matcha flavor was strong, it wasn't faint/watery. The seasonal sorbet, strawberry lychee, was very well done, and the vanilla bean tuile was pretty and the whole presentation was playful and pretty. Raspberry Tofu no Bake Cheesecake @@@ This wasn't as fantastic as I was imagining as I read it on the menu. But it was fluffy and airy. The flavors weren't popping as you put it in your mouth, it was bland, and I would leave this out when I come next time. The Sorbet Trio @@@@@ SO GOOD. They come in these white bowls on a green leave and the portions were BIG. The presentation was pleasing on the eye, It was a passion fruit mango one for the yellow, and I can't remember what the red and green was. But this was really really good. We came back later in the week because we couldn't find sorbets that tasted better. Finally, The Signature Sweet Tofu with black sesame tuile @@ I really didn't like it. I was hoping it was like the tofu deserts in Kyoto but it wasn't. If you've had dou hua, this is a really poor version of dou hua. It doesn't come with sugar water or dou jiang like dou hua, it comes with kuromitsu. Now I'm not saying dou hua doesn't go with kuromitsu, but the dou hua they made didn't go well with it. I think they could've made it better. Downside- Small place, waitress wasn't very friendly, seats are very limited. Service was very slow. Come if you have lots of patients and time.

Stopped by for dessert. Not sure how I would like soy based desserts. Turns out I didn't really enjoy it too much. It could be what I ordered or maybe I'm just not into soy? The presentation of each dessert was nice, but the taste was there for me. Here's what I ordered: -black sesame: started off tasting good, but then the more and more I ate of it...I started disliking the texture and thought the taste was rather bland. -raspberry cheesecake: not bad for being made out of soy Although different and made from soy products, this place isn't my cup of tea. Probably won't head back. Service was standard and the place was pretty popular. Presentation of desserts was impressive...but to me, the taste wasn't.

I am addicted to this place. I went back in October and ever since I've been daydreaming about my return. Unfortunately I live 800 or so miles away so I can't make Kyotofu my weekend middle of the night romantical chill hangout spot. It's adorable. The ambiance, aura, atmosphere whatever you want to call it is cozy thanks to dim lighting and the very small room. the noise level is perfect. It's trendy and inviting. I could sit in this place all night and enjoy the smiling faces and conversation. My friend and I asked the waitress to surprise us with a few desserts only and champagne. She brought out the Chef's three course dessert tasting or ?KAISEKI prix fixe for two. Everything was dainty and light and melt in your mouth delicious. If I had my way I'd be spending my Valentine's evening here for sure!

My boyfriend (not a tofu fan) knows that I LOVE anything tofu. So he decided to bring me here after dinner one day. As soon as we walked in, the hostess was very welcoming. We indicated that this was our first time here and we just wanted desserts. Our server kindly walked us through the dessert menu and suggested that we should try their KAISEKI Prix Fixe. This way we'd be able to sample a bit of everything. Service was excellent. She was def. on top of her game. My (I really don't like tofu but I'll eat it to make you happy) boyfriend REALLY liked all of their desserts! I joked and told him that he was just saying that. But I could clearly see that he was enjoying the tofu deserts as MUCH as I was. Sweet :) Kyotofu does a beautiful job with the presentation of their desserts. Its elegant, clean, and best of all they TASTE GREAT! Their desserts are so LIGHT but flavorful. The portions are small, but its meant to be this way. It satisfies your desert craving without making you feel too heavy and bloated. I'm a big fan of green tea. Love its health benefits, taste and all. So when our server brought us complimentary Matcha Green Tea Fudge, I was thrilled! These bad boys were AMAZING. Yes, all of the health benefits of green tea are now gone....So? Its GREEN TEA FUDGE!!! Ok. I'll calm down now. The prices here are a bit higher than some of the other dessert places in NY, BUT it was worth every penny. Everything here was on point. From the moment our hostess said "welcome" till the very sweet end. I'll definitely be back Kyotofu! {Note} You can choose to buy their bakery items from the counter and sit towards the front of the restaurant OR sit in the back of the restaurant for table service. If you are there for table service and want some of their bakery items, just ask your server and he/she will wrap that up for you.

more like a 3.5 but rounding up cuz i have an insane sweet tooth and the desserts here were really good. for dinner we ordered the sake braised pork belly and the truffle mac and cheese. the pork belly was good but it was SO salty that it literally seared my taste buds and i could barely taste the mac and cheese. and after a few slices it was just too much to handle. but we got the dessert prix fix for 2 and it did not disappoint. black sesame tofu and yuzu cheesecake were my favorites. everything else was pretty good too. their prix fix changes every now and then so i'd probably return just for dessert one day. cute place, definitely a good date spot!

I came here with the google offer for a dessert sampler for two. If I hadn't come here with someone who's been here before, I would have missed it because there isn't a big sign outside or anything. Just a note for first-timers who happen to have trouble finding the place. The place is really tiny so reservations are probably a must for any party larger than two. The tables are really close to each other also. ? I love green tea so everything was pretty amazinggg :) my favorite was the green tea creme brulee. Maybe they could work on the consistency though, because mine was more green-tea tasting (and therefore much better) than my friend's. I also liked this shiso cake thing for its citrus flavor, as well as the green tea chocolate. I wish I had bought some to bring back to Cambridge. Friend really enjoyed this chocolate cake that looked and tasted like a brownie, but it was just too rich for me. The dessert sampler also came with a shooter of sparkling sake which was delicious! ? We noted that the music did not seem to jive well with the ambiance of the restaurant. The restaurant seemed kind of romantic with its dim lighting and all, but the music was hip hop/rap and we thought that was kind of weird..not that it bothered us really. I would return, but prices seem a bit steep (but perhaps I feel this way because I don't live in NYC).

I was not treated well here and thus cannot recommend this place at all. ?This is a place filled with pretentious waiters. ?I don't know if it's quite as bad as LA waiters that think they are actors, but it's along the lines of that. ?The service itself was enough to put me off and never come back. The food itself was alright, to be fair, though in my opinion the prices are high. ?The high prices are there to make you, the customer, feel like you are having something special, but it's really just some desserts. I ordered from their 3 course sampler. I do recommend the sweet tofu panna cotta if you must go. ?It is served in a small cup and tasted a lot like flan. ?The other stuff was alright but not worth the gushing that other reviewers gave. ?The green tea creme brulee was ok if you like green tea flavored stuff; note that it did not have the bitter green tea after taste. ?I did like the fact that the brownie was not too sugary, though that was to be expected from an asian dessert place. Bottom line, the dessert is ok to good, the prices not worth it -- waaaay over priced for what it is, the service and attitude is extremely poor.

As a green tea lover, I am seriously obsessed with all things green tea! So it comes to no surprise that I loved Kyotofu! We came here just for dessert. It's a bit hard to find though since the outside of the restaurant is small and discrete. However, the inside is cute and clean, and the small dining area in the back of the restaurant is quite modern. The green tea creme brulee with lychee ice cream is not too sweet, and the taste of the matcha green tea in the creme brulee is thoroughly pungent, which I like! The green tea cupcake with soy ice cream can be more potent in terms of the matcha to cupcake ratio, but the thought of eating green tea cupcake was sufficient for me, I suppose. The iced green tea was delicious per usual, with sweetener on the side which I did not need to use. I'm sure traditional Japanese green tea connoisseurs would scoff at me if I did. I was amused by the triangular shaped tea bag. I also bought a gift box assortment (with what else, green tea!) but unfortunately, I left it at another restaurant and by the time I realized it, we were already on the subway in another part of town! :-( Sadness. Oh well, at least I got to enjoy Kyotofu whilst I was there!

LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! We came in on a Sunday night so it was not packed. Sat in the back and ordered two desserts. It was so incredibly flavorful and delicious. The textures were amazing, as the ice cream tasted more like mousse than anything. On top of that everything was vegan and not too heavy. I really loved the caramel sauce. It was soo good I wanted to lick the plate! It's not thick and super sweet as other places. It had so much flavor I just wanted to melt! The only down fall was that it was super loud inside and a little on the pricey side. But still, worth it!

Came here with some great friends on my last night in NYC (we at this place after Pam Real Thai Food, and right before visiting the 53rd and 6th Halal Cart, haha). Food (9.0/10) = We tried the following dishes: 1) Matcha Green Tea Creme Brulee: ?My god, I've never had anything like this. ?It was creamy, and you could really taste the matcha green tea. ?The berry sorbet really complimented the green tea flavor. ?A perfect combination. ?This was genius. 2) Black Sesame Sweet Tofu: This was served with "hoji-cha syrup." ?This didn't wow me as much as the concept of green tea creme brulee, but the dessert was still really good. ?The flavor of this dish reminded me of those black sesame cereal/breakfast drinks you find at Asian markets. . Ambiance (9.0/10) = This place has a very relaxing, clean atmosphere. ?A great place to just chill out late at night with some friends. ?It's a beautiful set up. ?Checkout their website for pictures of the interior. Service (8.0/10) = Attentive. ?No complaints here. Overall Opinion = I will come back to this place the next time I visit NYC. ?That is a sure thing. ?I'll also try their sake pairing suggestions. ?If you've never had green tea creme brulee, you must try it out.

I went here awhile ago with some friends, and by awhile I mean back when we were still wearing down coats, but I think the menu hasn't changed since. The place was quite small and very Asian, as in everyone around us was speaking either Korean and Japanese....which was kind of weird since we were also all Asian but spoke only English...lol We came just for dessert because one of my friends is a vegan who found this place that was supposedly vegan friendly. I ordered the green tea creme brulee because I absolutely adore anything green tea. I have to say the first few bites were extremely yummy but after about halfway, it just became a bit too much of the same taste, texture. I remember the little cookie shortbread thing it came with was very good and complemented the green tea flavor quite well. My vegan friend got the amnitsu (sp?) I think? It was like a giant shaved ice/adzuki bean thing, and she quite liked it. I don't remember if it was actually vegan and if she just had a momentary lapse. My other friend got the black sesame tofu which he said was just okay though I think he was just weirded out in general lol. I would definitely go back, and now the question is why I haven't.....

Tiny little restaurant with big ambitions. 5 girls shared: 3 prix-fix samplers, Sake infused Mac-n-Cheese, Curry, 2 dessert samplers and about 3 bottles of sake. Sunday 1/2 Sake! Whooo! Everything came out to about $150 (including tip). SKIP: The eel and the Mac n Cheese. Unless you REALLY love the taste of eel..its veryyy overpowering! The Mac-n-Cheese was nothing special in my book. Also, I could care less for their cupcakes. Not that great. MUST TRY: Meatballs! So yummy! And the piggy in a duvet. It was crunchy and paired REALLY well with the hot mustard. I also loved that green tea stick thing that comes on the dessert sampler. Its not listed anywhere so I don't know what it is. OTHERS: The curry reminded me of box curries I get at Asian markets. It was still yummy though. The famous Silken tofu dessert was delicious but I kept thinking about Korean tofu soup and got thrown off each time. It reminds me a lot of rice pudding..but not as textured. All the food is plated really nicely. The samplers are the perfect amount of food for 1 person. Might be too little to share. This place also has a love affair with arugula...or so I noticed. Your bill automatically includes 20% service charge. However, I thought service here was kind of bad. They were not very friendly nor attentive.

This review is only for the dessert. Both the Kabocha pumpkin custard with sage syrup and the black sesame custard with hojicha (roasted green tea) syrup had big flavor. The syrup was light and not sickly sweet as to overpower the custards.

3 girlfriends and I came here to try their food and desserts. At first, I walked right past it 'cause their signage isn't very clear. ?In fact, I don't even think they have any signage?! ?The only reason I even knew it was Kyotofu was because it was the only "modern" looking place on that street. The space is extremely small... I think it can fit about 20 or so people comfortably. ?As mentioned by other reviewers, service is lacking. ?They forgot what we ordered numerous times and had to come back and double check (using a notepad would've helped.....) and even then, they left items off our order and we had to ask for them after 20 or so minutes of waiting (and other tables getting what we ordered delivered to them). The food is only okay. ?We ordered the special set menu that had a little bit of everything. ?I can honestly say the only thing I liked was the pig in a duvet and that might even be because the name is so cute. The sweets were the highlight of the meal. ?We absolutely loved the signature sweet tofu and the black sesame sweet tofu. ?The table was split 2:2 on which one was the favorite. ?We also got the warm chocolate cake with passion fruit mochi, matcha green tea cr¨¨me br?l¨¦e and something else that I can't seem to find off their menu. I'd definitely recommend this place for dessert/sweets, but not for food.

I love this place! This is the first Asian restaurant I have been to that has an almost entirely fish-less menu. While most of us have come to associate Asian food with all types of seafood dishes, don't let this throw you off. Kyotofu offers an interesting and delicious take on Asian fusion food. Be sure to try the chicken tofu burger with sweet potato chips, the trio of tofu dips. If you are usually turned off by tofu don't fear these dishes are absolutely delicious and don't have the typical tofu taste you may have come to know. I also recommend ?the sake infused mac and cheese, and the sweet potato cake. ? This place is not to be missed!

The space in the front of the restaurant is pretty small, and you can see through a glass that is loaded with some baked goods where you can see some of the kitchen. That's on the right side when entering, but on the left is a small bar & sitting area. It's a good place to bring a small group of people for dessert right after dinner. I only had the set of small mini donuts when I came here and it had 3 different sauces. All the sauces were the right amount of sweet. I would rate the place more stars if I tasted more of the desserts, but that will probably be another time.

Absolutely love this place - light but flavorful food (love their mushroom salad), dessert, and tea. I know, tofu as dessert? ?I was skeptical at first as well, but I've become a fan. I even had my bridal shower here (rain back-up at the last minute, we were going to be in Central park).

At first, I was a little disappointed that Kyotofu's space seemed a lot smaller than I expected. However, I quickly forgot all my worries once I actually tried Kyotofu's dessert. The strawberry anmitsu was fantastic! Upon a vanilla ice-cream base (or a choice of strawberry sorbet), strawberry and coffee agar-agar cubes, green tea dango, and sweet adzuki red beans smothered the ice-cream with love. Each bite made me crave my next. The dessert was the perfect amount of sweetness and the vanilla ice-cream by itself was a true comfort in its pure, vanilla bean taste. I stole a bite of my friends' black sesame tofu and original tofu dessert. Both were also creamy and delicious. Our server was so nice! He explained each dessert with dedicated detail. I really appreciated how he took the time to explain everything. Also, we got a 4-pc muffin sample on the house. I'll never know why but we are grateful! I noticed they sold green tea Nama chocolates in their gift-shop so I bought a box as a present. Nama chocolates are the best, melt-in-your-mouth fudge-like confections if you can get the Royce brand from Japan. The ones from Kyotofu weren't the same consistency and had an extremely strong green tea taste but maybe I'm too used to the Royce brand. One more note is that Kyotofu isn't meant to be an authentic Japanese dessert place but its ingredients and inspiration are derived from Japan. Thanks for everything, Kyotofu!

Wow. love it. I'm not from NYC but was visiting from California, heard Kyotofu had some great desserts, had to check it out. The decor is trendy and slightly intimate feel but not overwhelming. I only had desserts, so review will only stem from that - Matcha Green Tea Creme Brulee and Signature Sweet Tofu. ?The Green Tea creme brulee had a strong matcha taste with the creme brulee texture but that was definitely what you'd expect from the description. It was baked to perfection. Highly recommend it..if you like green tea. The Signature Sweet Tofu, again, exactly what you'd expect, however, it came with kuromitsu syrup, which apparently I'm not a big fan of but having the tofu plain was just as divine.

Fun place for dessert. ?We tried the dessert sampler for $17 and it was plenty for the three of us to sample some of the dessert offerings. ?The favorites were the raspberry tofu no bake cheesecake and the signature sweet tofu. The matcha green tea cr¨¨me br?l¨¦e was a little too runny under the sugar crust and the warm chocolate cake with passion fruit mochi was quite dry (and the flavor wasn't very appealing). ?The dessert sampler also came with a green tea chocolate on toothpicks which was okay. Overall, presentation was excellent and we had a fun time.

Let me preface this review by saying this: I Love Meat - A LOT Now that being said we can continue- Here's some other things I love: -Things that taste like meat -Andre -Small Restaurants -Spontaneous Late Night Adventures -NYC -Yelp Bookmarks -Andre -Yelp What's Hot Section -Andre -Tapas -Spontaneous Late Night Adventures with my Boyfriend Andre involving a Small Restaurant we both Bookmarked from Yelps NYC "Whats Hot" Section that Creates Tapas sized dishes with tofu that Taste Like Meat!!! So at 11:30 at night when Andre woke me up to take a trip to Kyotofu I was all about it. What I first observed is it's a very modern intimate space (two walls facing opposite of each other- thats all), so if you think of bringing more then 4 people I would call very early in the day to accommodate your party. Even late in the evening (12:30am) our waiter Joseph provided us with exemplary service and allowed us to take our time enjoying the dishes. Honestly if it wasn't tofu I'm not sure I would have ate as much as I did, I Mean Seriously : Mac and Cheese? Chicken Sliders??? BBQ UNAGI after midnight?? NO Way! Plus I still had room for a sweet potato cheese cake........Have your cake and eat it too is literally the theme here. We loved it so much here we practically kidnapped our friends Kev and Natasha the next day and brought them to experience it. Sunday is "Sake Sunday" (1/2 off bottles) and brunch comes with free Mimosa's/Bellini's so you can imagine the awesome time we had. In my opinion I've always left thinking the bill was reasonable for the amount of food + drinks we had. (2ppl $71 / 4 ppl $100) After experiencing Kyotofu my bf and I have definitely considered incorporating more protein packed tofu into our diets. I'm sure this place will be a regular feel-good ?spot of ours for awhile.

I love fluffy, creamy desserts. I'm loud, I'm proud, I'm lactose-challenged and un-cowed. So imagine my giddiness upon discovering Kyotofu's offering of soy milk soft-serve. With chocolate covered puffed barley bits! Though the texture of the dessert was spot-on, as pillowy as I dream of soft-serve forever being, the flavor was distinctly beany. Beany in a huh? way. In a I-really-wish-I-craved-this-but-I-think-I'll-just-?let-it-melt way. I'm no stranger to beans in dessert. But unlike the deliciousness of che ba mau, banh cam, 8 treasures sticky rice -- desserts that keep the integrity of the bean intact, here, the bean is disguised as something texturally sublime but whose flavor is wholly unsupported by its accompanying ingredients. I appreciate that Kyotofu's desserts are only mildly sweet. But it is my sneaking suspicion that Kyotofu's chocolate desserts, like many Chinatown/Asian-ish chocolate desserts, don't work because they fail to apprehend the rich and lasting mouthfeel of what makes great chocolate ... chocolate.

Ya know, I was REALLY hoping to snag a first to review with this one, but clearly I'm not even on the ball enough for my own neighborhood. Kyotofu is a brand-spanking new japanese desert bar on 9th ave. ?Wasn't really sure what to expect from this place, but I was pleasantly surprised. ?Everything is crafted beautifully and with flair, and tastes good, but healthy. ?We had the peanut-butter pancakes and the cookie box. ?The cookies seemed to be more of a hit among the group than the pancakes, but I disagreed. ?That may be because you could smear peanut-butter on a jockstrap and I'd still think it was delicious, but whatever, we all have our vices. ?Also, everything tastes fresh and healthy, which is nice for a desert place. ?While I won't deny I am a fan of anything rich and chocolate, it was nice not to feel like was going to explode after stopping for desert. The winner here, though, is the setting. ?Cute, cozy and chic, it's the perfect end to a date without feeling too fancy or a great place to stop in for tea, sake or a snack in the afternoon. ?Great Sake selection as well - I will most certainly be back.

TASTY TOFU!!! ?Is what I think about when remembering my experience at Kyotofu, I came here with three fellow yelpers Gia, Andre and Natasha after the NY Wine Expo, Gia and Andre would not stop raving about the place and how great it was and they were sure right! ?As soon as we walked in buzzing off the NY Expo Wine, I felt relaxed when I saw the white walls, contemporary wall layouts and ambient lighting. ?We were seated by a friendly attentive young woman who informed us of complimentary Mimosa's and Bellini's on Sunday's (during brunch hours) and a half off special on bottles of Sake. While the faint underground electronic music was bumping, we agreed to share our orders, so we ordered the smoked salmon donburi, french toast with a Kahlua dipping sauce, the quiche, chicken tofu burger, and the famous mac and cheese. ?They were all AMAZING!!! ?We were more than satisfied, the 2 bottles of Sake had us feeling great, and nothing could have topped it better than sweet tooth Gia ordering the signature Omakase dessert which consists of 3 different dessert courses!! Who knew so many great tasting things could be made out of Tofu! ?Im definitely a fan!

Green Tea Creme Brulee: recommended for all the matchaholics like me. It's very sweet and creamy, but not overly so. Miso Brownies: an absolute must for everyone! This is the best brownies I ever had and the best dessert at Kyotofu! Black Sesame Sweet Tofu: not memorable. I like the texture, but I wish the black sesame flavor stood out more. Matcha Chocolates (Matcha, Genmai): very interesting flavor. The matcha/genmai flavor overpowers the chocolate a little bit, but they are still yum. This is definitely my favorite Japanese dessert place, along with Chaan in East Village. The decor is very trendy and cozy, so it's a great date spot as well. Stay away from the actual food though: they are mediocre and small in portion but quite pricey.

The novelty is worth trying, but as for dessert quality... it's okay. My boyfriend and I went here after dinner on a Friday night. We went a bit later (around 10 PM), so it wasn't as crowded. It's an intimate setting with counter seats in the front and actual booths and tables in the back area. It's a great place to take a date, but also a great place to have a girls' night out. We got the prix fixe menu for 2 for ~$30. It came with 3 desserts, as well as some petit fours and cookies. We started off with their (1) SWEET TOFU, which was my favorite. Simple and sweet. It wasn't trying to mask the use and flavor of tofu because it was just sweet tofu. Texture was soft and silky, and the flavor was subtle but good. After that, it went downhill for me. The next dessert was (2) GREEN TEA CREME BRULEE. Interesting, but texture was off for me. I guess I'm used to my creme brulees being very creamy, but this was a little chunky, most likely due to the use of tofu. I'm sure it's healthier than the traditional creme brulee but I'd rather indulge and have a delicious creme brulee that's bad for me than compromise on texture for a slightly healthier one. The third dessert was the (3) CHOCOLATE CAKE which was dry. Again it was an issue of texture for me. I'm not sure if we were getting their last desserts of the night, but the cake was dry and crumbly... definitely not worth getting again. The final desert was the (4) Yuzu Cheesecake, which was okay. Nothing impressive although I love yuzu to death. Finally, they gave us some cookies that my boyfriend spit out because the texture was so crumbly and dry. I'm not sure if they made those with tofu either, but I was very disappointed. However, my boyfriend loved the green tea chocolate petit four that they gave us at the end. The texture was like white chocolate, and it was slightly chilled. It was very sweet but delicious and interesting. Service and atmosphere was great, but the desserts aren't worth an hour long wait or a return visit. It's one of the most talked about places for dessert because their desserts are tofu-based, but I didn't think it was a solid place for great dessert.

I'll preface by saying that the your mileage may very. My party waited 45 minutes for its table, and while we waited in line other parties got restless and left. I'm sure their review would be less than stellar. Kyotofu is a gem. It has great ambiance. It's an intimate setting. The menu is diverse. We had the signature sweet tofu, anmitsu, and green tea creme br?l¨¦e. All items were very good and a unique blend of tastes and textures. Each was clearly hand crafted with pride. I wouldn't say there food blew me away though. Good for 4 stars though. The service earns the last star. While waiting in line during one of the hottest nights, we were offered complimentary soft serve. Sorry couple behind us. There may have been some miscommunication, and we might have gotten your free soft serve too! ?Anyway, service was very friendly and playful. We'd definitely come back again when we're in town.

In the past, I haven't been a fan of Japanese desserts because I always found them to be bland. What I'm realizing lately is that the blandness is actually subtlety, and subtlety is a good thing. Kyotofu offers up small, light and delectable desserts and appetizers. The ambience is very modern and the presentation of each dish was beautiful. We started with the tofu and chicken tsukune meatballs. The combo of tofu and chicken sounds a bit odd, but the tofu made the meatballs soft and smooth, and they were delicious. Next came the otsumami, which was the chef's selection of appetizers. Tonight's selection was steamed tofu, steamed veggies, a tofu quiche, and namasu, a daikon/carrot salad macerated in vinegar. The standouts here were the tofu quiche and the namasu. I seriously could've eaten a bowl of the namasu. Next up was the four-course kyotofu dessert KAISEKI tasting menu. It featured their signature sweet tofu topped with Japanese black sugar syrup and a piece of dried apricot, which was creamy like panna cotta (excellent); ginger-infused japanese rice okayu, a rice pudding with sour cherries, kuromitsu whipped cream and ginger candy (excellent), a creamy toasted walnut tahitian vanilla parfait (good), and a tofu-based warm chocolate cake that was rich and light and so good my wife ate most of it. There was also a serving of kinako cream, which was like peanut butter smeared on the plate (very good). Next came my wife's order, the ichigo strawberry anmitsu, which was a lot like Japanese halo-halo. It had gelatin, strawberry mochi bits, strawberries and azuki (red bean) sauce and a quarter-sized dorayaki pancake. This was so refreshing, especially after all of our other food. But wait there's more... :-) Next up were two miniature cookies...kuro goma (black sesame) and an okara cookie dipped in green tea frosting. I think overall, food with black sesame looks cool, but the flavor is just okay, and that's how I feel about the kuro goma cookie. Okara is a high-fiber byproduct of tofu or soymilk and is used as the base for the cookie. I didn't think you could really taste it, but the green tea "frosting" was really nice. As a palate cleanser, they brought us lychee jelly cubes to end our meal. Now this might sound like a lot of food, but the portions are really, really small. Considering all the eating we had done throughout the day, it was actually a perfect place to end day one of our NY vacation/eating excursion.

Kyotofu is such a cute little after-dinner spot! Just like stepping into Tokyo for a hot minute, with modern, clean decor and adorable picture-worthy desserts. The warm miso chocolate cake with chocolate-black soybean ganache was a dream, with a rich, molten layer in the middle that burst when you touched it with your spoon. The ice creams with berry compote were refreshing and the apricot caramel dessert was heavenly. Our server Albert was amazing! Not only did he recommend two excellent sakes that paired well with the desserts, he treated us to a little box of chocolate "cupcakes" since to celebrate Denise's bachelorette weekend. I'm starting to think New Yorkers get a bad rap.

This place tries to be cute. ?I like cute. ?But only on girls. ?I mean, girl. ? Actual contents are skimped in favor of aesthetics. ?I understand that I'm reviewing a foodie establishment, but since when did people deem it okay to pay more for looks than for substance? I mean, everything actually tastes really clean and subtle sweet but I don't want clean and I disagree with subtle! ?I want rich and saturated. ?Dark chocolate and creamy vanilla. ?The sweetest of sorbets and pastries. ?I want to get a paper cut from a Golden Ticket and get smacked upside the head with Willy Wonka's pimp cane. ?But I came here and all I got was an Oompa Loompa. I'm complaining. ?I know. ?I wanted to two-star this place but I gave it a third just because the mix of flavors they present is actually interesting. ?We had the kyotofu dessert KAISEKE prix-fixe ($17) which is pretty much a dessert flight. ?You get a smaller (don't know how they pulled this off) sampling of signature sweet tofu followed by a rhubarb strawberry cobbler, passion fruit tofu cheesecake, and a warm miso chocolate cake. ?To end the journey, our arrival brought us their homemade sorbets of chocolate and ginger vanilla (flavors change daily). ? My girl liked it, I liked it ok, and the ambiance was pretty sweet except it can get cramped and next thing you know you're pretty much conversing with strangers because you're so damn close to each other. ?I'd come again but only to bring friends from out of town who might enjoy such a minimalist experience. ?However, I'm McFatty McFat Snacks so I don't think I'd come of my own accord again.

Boooy, you lookin good! Have you been going to Anestasia's brow studio? A night of silliness-a hot, humid, and utterly loathsome day followed by Office Hours hosted by Mr. Sam P, the Mayor incarnate.

Oops! If you are in the mood for something new and exciting, something dimly lit with limited seating (seriously, the pic makes this place look big enough to do at least 5 side-by-side naked cartwheels in-it's not. Maybe seating for 30ish in the main room?), something with tofu inspired shenanigans, then this is the place for you. If not, come for the booze, entertain and schmooze, and hit up tasti d-lite down the street and call it a night! Huzzah, that's my rap, yo!

I think it is about time I wrote a review for Kytotofu - after all, I know their veggie menu like the back of my hand. I've done everything here from lazy brunches to hurried cupcake gobbling past midnight. I think the menu is kind of a mixed bag, and if you pick the right things you'll be wowed. -My favourite things on the menu are the warm chocolate cake. I like how they change the accompiments - It used to be miso, now it's mochi, and they both give an interesting Japanese twist to the classic taste of warm, brown, molten, MmmmM. -Among all their tofus, I loved the jasmine one the best - It's smooth, silky, fragrant and light as a feather. But hey, they took it off the menu. What! Bring it back, please. -The cupcakes, which apparently won some high brow awards are merely average in my opinion. They're lighter and less sweet than most cupcakes but they leave a strange taste in my mouth. -From the brunch menu, I like the Brioche french toast a lot - the shochu coffee syrup is a wonderful touch to the dish. The chef once made the Omakase platter vegetarian for me and it left me deeply unsatisfied - it was 10 parts rice and 1 part pickle. No can do. -If you come here for dessert, definitely try the wine pairings -The wines are pretty delicious and delicate, just like everything else at Kyotofu.

I told my roommate I was going to "wander" the streets, but my real intention was to make a stop at Kyotofu for their macarons. I asked the girl working at the front what kind of macarons they had. She informed me it was green tea with ginger filling, black sesame, and chocolate for the day. After a lengthy miscommunication, (something to do with my stuttering and forgetting what flavors she just said), I ordered a green tea and chocolate to go, $1.35 each before tax. After I let them warm up to room temperature at home, I bit into the green tea one, which had a nice texture - pleasantly chewy. On the other hand, the ginger syrup-y filling was way too sweet for me. Next! Chocolate one was tougher than the first; there was resistance when I tried to take a bite. I noticed there was a slight bitter taste, which could've been from the chocolate ganache filling, but more like the meringue had been burnt, leaving a bitter aftertaste. The macarons aren't comparable to other places in the city, which is kind of expected since Kyotofu's known for it's Japanese influenced food and miso cake rather than macarons. I tried the mini pack of 4 cupcake things too, total meh and not worth the $4. For macarons, I'll stick to le Francais.

Kyotofu was forgettable the first time. I went back with an open mind and l am still boggled to all the hype that surrounds it. My first meal was during lunch. It was some type of sandwich served with salad and lotus root chips. Take home dessert was a green tea cupcake. The cupcake was light, fluffy, and bland. My second experience was dinner for Fashion Week. Kyotofu is offering three prix fixe menus (all in the $20 range) with each level offering an extra dish: five basics, add ceviche and then add ceviche and unagi. I chose the Harujuku menu which consisted of spicy meatball tsukune, curried arancini, a chicken & tofu slider, bean salad, pigs in a duvet, and dessert of choice. I felt that the food design was too prim and proper to be called Harujuku. Taste alone didn't even have edge. I got my plate and it was beautiful. Was this how models ate? I stared at my food and stared well. If you blinked, you might have missed it. It's not just the French who serve tiny food. I think Kyotofu takes it to a whole new level. The meatballs were the size of my pinky fingernail. They were tasty but small. I got one arancini and one slider. The pigs in a duvet were lil smokies wrapped in puff pastry served with spicy mustard. I hate mustard but I loved this pairing. I did enjoy everything on my plate and I actually got quite full. The arancini was my favorite and I used the bean salad as palate cleanser between each dish. After a few bites, I was ready to move on with the show. Dessert please! I chose the black sesame tofu and it instantly reminded me of the weird space I was in. The thing was from another planet. I had to smell it and study it. I probed it and it didn't jiggle. It barely moved. The thing was solid and a bit strange. I was never a fan of dessert tofu and the tofu at Kyotofu is definitely an aquired taste IMO. The tofu needed to be drowned in the green tea syrup. I thought the green tea syrup was thinned out honey. I am so un-gourmet. I just don't understand Kyotofu. I don't understand their food concept and I don't understand the awesomeness of their dessert. There must have been a spell in their tofu because I left with their "award winning" chocolate souffle cupcake and two macarons. Aside from the food, I must add that the service is cold. I was told sternly that I had to choose a dessert after I expressed confusion because I was given two dessert menus. Service is also slow considering there are not many tables full of people. In fact, the place only sits about 12 on each side. I just don't get it. I find nothing award winning about their souffle cupcake and the macarons are pretty sweet in a non cute and delicious way. I just don't get it. Three stars for staging delights and bite size classics. Two stars for everything else. You're not missing anything if you don't go here. My advice: make the best out of a mediocre situation.

I love tofu in almost all of its forms that I've sampled - ma po tofu, tofurkey, steamed tofu, deep fried tofu, mock duck (made of tofu), etc., so when I heard about a place that was raved about as a dessert bar that specialized in tofu, I know that I had to give it a shot. We called ahead as we were paying for our dinner up the street and made a last minute reservation. Surprisingly, it wasn't a problem for them to accommodate 6 people at 9pm on a Saturday night. We must have just slipped in at exactly the right moment. From my previous review stalking, I already knew what I wanted to sample - the black sesame sweet tofu. When it came out, it was beautifully presented. You slowly pour the syrup (it tasted like simple syrup to me) into the tofu glass, where it settles atop of the sweet tofu. If you pour it just so, it wont have splattered either. While some people didn't seem to care for the tofu, I loved it. I love love love the sweet silkiness of it as I roll it around my mouth with my tongue. It was super light and refreshing, so it didn't end up settling in my tummy after our semi-heavy meal. If anything, the whole tofu aspect of it makes it a relatively healthy dessert in my mind. It seems like it would be a cute date place. The clientele seems to skew to those of Asian decent. They also offer other desserts, which most of my dining companions seemed to enjoy for the most part. There's also a dinner menu, but nothing looked overly fantastic off of it. I'll be back for the dessert the next time I can drag a reluctant date here since it doesn't seem like a place that many people go to alone. Guess I better start looking for a date.... /wink

Packed on a Saturday night, the wait was 40 minutes. We decided to get takeout instead, which was a lot cheaper since there's no plating or ice cream involved. 1. Signature Sweet Tofu - sweet, smooth, silky, and delicious. This reminds me of Tofu Fa with sweeter syrup. 2. Chocolate Cupcake - Light and fluffy, tastes great with ice cream. 3. Yuzu Tofu Cheesecake - If you like cheesecake, this can't compare. If you don't like cheesecake, you won't like this. If you're impartial and stop comparing, this tastes delicately awesome. Tart raspberry sauce. 4. Matcha Green Tea Creme Brulee - Creme Brulee goodness for the lactose intolerant. Perfect blend of green tea. It would be nicer if the place wasn't so packed. The lady at the counter charged my credit and forgot to give me my food and went away for a while. Yep, they were busy.

This is my most favorite place to get dessert in NYC. The proportions are small-ish, but the entire experience of flavor and presentation are always worth it. The food is always beautifully displayed, with a bounty of flavors on every dish, even if it's a small swish of sauce and a piece of fruit and a cookie crisp. Everything is done impeccably, in true Japanese style. Share a pot of tea with your friend or spouse and admire the lovely teapot, too. PS. Small gatherings only. When we were here there was a bachelorette party - talk about ridiculously awkward. The back room is dark and ambient, and here were these girls with blinking glow stick jewelry and dumb tiaras.

Recommended for: ?Tofu, dessert lovers. Food 4, Service 3.5, Ambiance 3.5. Are you a fan of Tofu? ?Do you like Desserts? ?Do you like Retro-modern decor? ?If you answered yes to at least one if not all three of the above questions, then you will surely enjoy yourself at Kyotofu. While I have not dined here exclusively for their food (rather came for an event) I cannot comment entirely on their menu, only what we ate. ?Service is good, but not entirely fantastic considering it is such a small place - but I won't really judge until I go there sit and stuff myself with good friends later. ?Decor wise however, it is modern, funky and has a great feel to it. ?The music definitely lends itself to the ambiance and puts you in the mood to explore your taste buds. And exploration is really where its at when you dine at Kyotofu. ?They really explore the versatility of Tofu. ?Not only are these tiny tasty morsels good, they are expertly crafted into various shapes and designs. ?While they are good to look at, they are even better to eat. ?Portion wise, it does run on the smaller side, but you really shouldn't come here to stuff yourself. ?You should come to enjoy some finely crafted desserts in a fun atmosphere. ? Oh and they have a variety of delicious cocktails to chose from... and if you're asking, then the answer is yes, alcohol does go well with Tofu. Sean Approved: ?Definitely Yes!

UPDATE: 10/30/08: Kyotufu's flavors of the day: Pistachio, Tahitian Vanilla, Twist I tried the Choco Souffle cupcake and it was dark, rich, and moist. WOW!

What a cool place! I felt like I was back in Japan-town in San Francisco (sorry, never actually been to the real mccoy). I could totally see a scene of the next Bond film in this place - can you just imagine Daniel Craig spoon-feeding some vixen (lets say Eva Green for practical purposes) some gloriously sensuous creation...? I could. I went with an equally hunky guy, but unfortunately I can't say that I could hold a candle to Eva Green's beauty. But I digress. While I may never crave the food or drink from Kyotofu, there is something to be said about the way everything here is presented. Everything on your plate and table is intentional - not a single item is superfluous, nothing wasted. Beyond (far beyond) the functionality is the form - their desserts are a true aesthetic pleasure. 4 stars for coolness. I wouldn't make this a regular place, but I would like to go back to try their drinks and sample the rest of their desserts.

New York City's best cupcake? ? That is quite a BOLD statement to come out of a tofu-based dessert shop in the middle of Hell's Kitchen. I dared them to test my taste buds and prove that it was the best cupcake in Manhattan. ? The damn cupcake wasn't even a cupcake, but a warm chocolate souffl¨¦ in the shape of a cupcake. Either way, the cupcake/souffl¨¦ was light on the tongue, but rich in its chocolate flavor. It came with a side of pumpkin & chocolate swirl frozen yogurt (ya know I was all up on that) and a tiny dish of sliced strawberries. Sorry my friends, it was not the best cupcake I've ever had, but it satisfied my chocolate cravings in a heartbeat. Japanese soft ballad covers of Guns N Roses and Bob Marley lingered in the background. Slightly confusing, but then again, it felt like being in a sci-fi movie inside. The ambiance was also calm and relaxing, making it a great escape from all the hustle & bustle. The clean modern d¨¦cor lent a cool feel to this dessert haven. I will be back to try the other tofu-based desserts.

Came here for a second visit after about two years. ?I found a deal on google and wanted to bring my husband to the place where he took me on a date because we had a great time there. I barely go out to the city so I was excited to have desert course from the offer. The hostess asked if we wanted to have dinner first. We didn't order food because we planned to elsewhere and from then on she was pretty rude. I don't know if its because she was having a bad day but she was so rude serving us. Maybe it's because we didn't want to order food. They added 20% gratuity to the bill but I guess it wasn't enough. Will not go there ever again.

Cool, space age-like minimalist ivory decor. ?This Japanese dessert bar has the most beautifully plated dishes in all of Hell's Kitchen. ?Every sweet thing looks like a work of art. ?They are new, so the service is still uneven, but if/whenever your server if you have any questions, say YES. ?Don't be polite, ask exactly what to expect out of each element of your dessert so you won't be disappointed or surprised. Some dishes are semi-self explanatory, like the warm Chestnut mochi chocolate cake (warm cake with a gooey chesnut dumpling type thing inside) with green tea-anko ice cream, (more like a foam), which was delicious. ? However, my partner ordered Crystal Plum Sake Anmitsu with not a lot of questions, and it turned out to be a glass of clear, almost flavorless jelly cubes in a subtle sake sauce, mini mochi balls, which was not what he expected or really wanted after looking at my chocolate cake. ?Don't let that discourage you though, he just didn't know what he was getting into, it was fine if you wanted a jelly-like, minimal sweetness, very light soupy thing. Everything else that came out looked gorgeous and really tasty. ?The ingredients might be new to you, and if you are someone who feels guilt at indulging in sweets, (sorry can't relate) the ingredients are highly nutritious, healthy, vegan for the most part, so indulge away. Closed Mondays though, so plan ahead.

Such a cute place! ?Stopped by here this afternoon after our attempts to see the Chanel exhibit in CP, so it was a nice bus ride down towards the west side for some delicious snacks. The sweet tofu is so delicious, very delicate taste. ?My favorite was the ice cream (get the twist, vanilla/greentea) and loaded with mochi. ?We only ordered dessert and no food so I cannot comment. I like it that Kyotofu is located outside of the "main streets". ?It's a small space so if this place was found in the middle of St. Marks, it would have blown up and lines would be around the block. ?It's just far enough from the mainstream but close enough that I won't be lazy in going there. ? Will definitely return and try their brunch selections.

Ok. ?I finally made it here. ?There's not much of a reason for me to be in the general vicinity of Kyofutu but I've been telling myself to go for a long time so I made a trip there specifically one late Saturday night, about half an hour before they closed for the night. ?I went by myself so I just sat at the bar. ?The decor was great and the service was very friendly. ?I can tell that it's a great place to bring a small group of friends, and I'd probably do that in the future. I loved that they have an extensive sake menu, even though I am not exactly a connoisseur of sake and probably can't tell the difference between good sake and bad sake. ?So I asked the waitress to recommend me a kind of sake based on the food that I ordered. ?Being the glutton that I am, I ordered their only pork dish (if I remember correctly) the Pigs in A Duvet, and for dessert, I ordered the Signature Sweet Tofu. ?For sake I was recommended the Jokigen. The Pigs in a Duvet was pretty much what the menu described, "berkshire pork sausage wrapped in puff pastry with spicy mustard", minus the spicy. ?However, it was also the type of stuff I could get at a dimsum place when it tries to invent new dimsum dishes to offer something different and non-traditional. ?It was pretty good but I was kind of ambivalent about it because I've tasted similar things in the past and Kyotofu's version does not rise about the rest. ?The Signature Sweet Tofu was tasty, and it reminded me of a traditional Chinese dessert, Douhua, especially the Hong Kong variation which is made with syrup, except the consistency of Kyotofu's tofu was thicker and the syrup had a... darker taste to it. ?The menu said that the syrup is "kuromitsu black sugar syrup", and I guess that's what I tasted. I would come back if friends and I happen to be looking for a place to sit down for a while; the decor and the mood there really are excellent. ?But honestly, the food does not taste like anything I haven't tried before especially since I live in Flushing, and for much better prices. ?Maybe I need to try their cupcakes?

If it's your first time to Kyotofu, as it was mine, for a taste of a little bit of everything, the Kaiseki prix fixe dessert may be your best bet. But after you've established what it is you love/like (and don't particularly like/care for), and if you decide that Kyotofu is worth visiting again, I would skip the Kaiseki. To start, we had the signature sweet tofu, a flan like concoction that was semi-dense, creamy, and chilled with a texture that reminded me of a softer version of Chinese almond tofu. Atop the tofu was brown sugar syrup that went very well with the tofu. 4 stars! http://www.yelp.com/biz_¡­ The main dish came with the matcha green tea creme brulee, a (miso) chocolate cake, and the sweet potato cake. http://www.yelp.com/biz_¡­ The matcha green tea creme brulee was thoroughly infused with the essence of matcha, the smell and taste heavily imprinted in your mouth and nose with each bite. Another win for Kyotofu - 4 stars. http://www.yelp.com/biz_¡­ The (miso) chocolate cake, upon the first bite, was thick and decadent, but after the last taste of chocolate leaves your mouth, you have second doubts about what you just experienced. Where was the miso? How is this cake more special than others? Bite after bite I just couldn't tell. 3 stars. http://www.yelp.com/biz_¡­ And lastly, the sweet potato cake resembled a mini scone. There was no hint of my starchy friend at all - its taste, smell, texture - all lost in translation. The cake-like-scone was on the dry side as well. I was underwhelmed. 2 stars. http://www.yelp.com/biz_¡­ We ended the Kaiseki with matcha chocolate. I appreciated the matcha flavor, but I couldn't taste any chocolate. It was a canvas of matcha and sugar, which I didn't particularly love. 2 stars. http://www.yelp.com/biz_¡­ Ambiance is forgettable (at least outside in the bar area) and service is standard.

Yay! 200! Kyotofu was the first restaurant I ever bookmarked on Yelp... it took me almost four months to finally give it a try. Arnab and I went there tonight for dessert, and I really enjoyed it. First I was surprised to see how small the place is in reality (unlike what the photo on Yelp suggests): no more than 10 small tables, along the two white leather couches on each side of the room. The lighting is dim and cozy, and the place would be perfect for a date. I had the black sesame sweet tofu (I'm one of those people that love sweet tofu... go figure): it was quite good and almost had the consistency of a custard. You could also definitely taste the sesame. I also had a bite of Arnab's raspberry chocolate cake: very rich and very yummy... Don't be put off by the portion sizes: everything is tiny indeed, but very satisfying. The drink selection is even more impressive than the dessert menu: very wide selection of sakes, but they also have a few cocktails and teas. I had the special cocktail tonight: "waku waku cocktail", or fresh watermelon juice with soju and cherry puree... very good. Service was on a par with the food, and the girl who helped us was great. The prices are a little stiff, though, hence the missing star.

After having Totto Ramen, we decided to come to Kyotofu to finish our day of Japanese food adventure in the NYC! Nice and Dim lighting set up the mood for a great date restaurant.. Unfortunately, we are not here on a date... and good food is our priority!! Since we don't really have Japanese/Western fusion dessert up in Toronto, and I am really excited about it until.... Kaiseki Prix Fixe($17.00) - Chef's 3-course Dessert Tasting - good if you cannot make up your mind and you want to try everything! - everything tasted OK, but nothing really wow me and gave me that oh I am in dessert heaven and that smile... The table we were sitting was a little whopping and so is my friend's chair... she almost flipped over... or maybe it was all the soy milk ice cream she was eating??

This review is for the Valentine's Day prie fixe experience. ? Went here last year for Valentines Day. ?Despite having a reservation, we had to wait 10 minutes, as did lots of other couples. ?We were seated in the back room of Kyotofu. ?The tables were packed together so tightly that the host had to pull the table out completely for my date to get in. Tables were only inches apart and it was like the couples next to you were sitting at your table and you were sitting at theirs. ? I wasn't really interested spending Valentines Day with the random guy seated next to me, so I said to the host, "Seating is like a cattle car, if I had known it was going to be like this, I wouldn't have booked." ?His response: "This is our normal seating arrangement." ?Judging from photos, this doesn't appear to be true. ?I asked to be reseated in the front area, where there were a few bar seats. ?He said he'd let us know if anything opened up. ?They ended up putting us in at two seats they'd made (probably to get $70 more business that night) in this walkway at the bar: http://www.rwmanager.com¡­. ?It was more private but servers kept bumping into us. What was billed as a "dessert and sake pairing" (was thinking real sake paired with each course) turned out to be a 3 course dessert offering with one small, sad glass of bad sparkling sake. ? Our only consolation was the dessert. ?The back sesame sweet tofu was good. ?The rest were forgettable. ?We both agreed that we could find better in Chinatown. All in all, it really felt like they were trying to capitalize on Valentines Day by overbooking, cramming people in, and making so-so desserts. ?A business is a business, but don't compromise the experience for the sake of making a Valentines day buck.

Come here for the dessert, stay to be awed by what can be done with the humble soy bean. I came here for an-impromptu middle-of-the-week dinner, which we started off with the sampler. Although tasty and interesting to look at, I was a tad disappointed with what constituted dinner at Kyotofu. Fortunately, we had the foresight of getting the 3 course dessert, of which, each course has 3 separate desserts. So effectively by ordering this one item, you get 9 of Kyotofu's desserts. Do it. Haha, anyway, the decor was fresh and hip, servers were friendly and speedy. No complaints here, Kyotofu is one of the few stand-out NYC dessert purveyors for me at the moment.

I have to say that I'm a HUGE carnivore. ?Although tofu is a great source of protein, I'd rather eat a nice juicy steak any day, but after this last visit to Kyotofu, I'll gladly include more tofu into my diet! Okay so this time around, I really did try a few more dishes and what can I say, they were pretty damn good! I came here after the NY Wine Expo with Kevin F., Gia V. and Andre L. and yes, we were all quite loaded at this point and HUNGRAY. ?Gia and Andre could not stop raving about this place and since my experience there last summer, I was kind of skeptical, but I said why not? ?We proceeded to order a few dishes and share them all. I honestly can't remember all the things we got, but the I do remember tasting one of the sliders and I really enjoyed it! ?Also, Sundays they do free mimosas and belinis!

Too cute to eat? Almost. My date never eats dessert but likes to watch me---- I'm so down with that. I unselfconsciously got messy with my yuzu and blackberry anmitsu. It was refreshing and delicious, not too sweet. We even ordered savory dishes here, which I like more than the desserts. The smoked salmon rice roll is so yummy. The rice is so well cooked--- it's probably the most perfectly seasoned and prepared example of the grain (Japanese style) in Manhattan. ? Their little homemade tofu is just a slice of paradise. I've never had something so fresh and delicious since my grandma's tofu. Whenever I'm in this neighborhood I always gravitate towards Kyotofu.

You know it's a trendy spot when there's no sign labeling the establishment. Kyotofu is a tofu & sake dessert bar. My b/f and I didn't feel like tofu or sake. Crazy, I know! So we shared the two desserts (warm chestnut mochi chocolate cake & crystal plum sake anmitsu). The wait time took so long that I wondered if they had to go to some midwest state, find the cow, feed it, milk it, then bring back the milk to make the chocolate cake. When the desserts finally arrived, they were amazing! I loved every bite! Go here if you're not in a rush to be anywhere and got spending dough!

I only had Kyotofu as dessert after dinner at a different restaurant but I really enjoyed the food here. I was a little aporehensive but I have changed my opinion of soy based desserts! We had the kaiseki (3 course "sampler" style). My favorite was the house made silken tofu. It was very light but sweet which was perfect after a rich meal. I think it had a black sesame sauce on top that was really memorable. Seriously, ?I could have eaten a whole bowlful of this. I also enjoyed the green tea creme br?l¨¦e. The browned sugar on top of the green tea color looked kind of...bad but it tasted delicious. Maybe I just like green tea cause the matcha green tea white chocolates were so good, I took some home! I can't speak for the "real food" menu but the desserts were excellent. The restaurant itself is also nice, kinda small but very comfortable.

Wow, I really had no idea that this entire category of the Japanese dessert bar even existed at all, until I met Michael and the devilly delicious and delectable delights that he delivered (5 points!) to our spa event last week at Exhale. Predictably, the award winning chocolate souffle cupcakes were unspeakably decadent and good. ?What blew me away, though, were the savory selections including a standout cornmeal based muffin with blue-cheese topping and some sort of soy bean extract (to make you feel marginally smug about getting some protein benefits). I feel like I have a ton more to learn about the endless repertoire of exotic yet eminently accessable treats on the Kyotofu roster (which changes up seasonally, I'm told), so the best thing that could happen is that Michael humors his 5th generation San Franciscan heritage and expands to the Bay Area.

Boys, Men - Take notes! If you want to impress a date then go here, what girl doesn't like sweets. Ambience - this place is dark and has nooks and crannies like you wouldn't believe. ?So.... Why wouldn't you want to take your date here? Dessert - You can go crazy and go for 3 items for $11 or 5 items for $17 or just order single items off the menu. ?My friends and I tried the following: Black Sesame Sweet Tofu - AMAZING! ?You have the soft/runny consistency of tofu with the sweetness of the sugar and apricot complemented by the rich savory flavor of the sesame. Yuzu and Blackberry Anmitsu - yummy tofu mochi with blackberries and citrus. ?Perfect combination of sweet and citrus flavors against the tofu. Strawberry Shortcake - YUM. ?If you love strawberries, this is your pick right here. ? Chocolate Souffle Cupcake - Who doesn't love cupcakes? ?Everyone is crazy about them. ?This spin on cupcakes is pretty distinct in the berry compote and the vanilla flavor that is worked into the chocolate airiness. ?I love Love LOVE japanese food in general because of the light and airy quality. ?You may eat a lot, but you don't feel nauseated like eating italian or even chinese food which is heavy on the oils. ? All in all, whether going with a group of friends or with a date, this spot is a surefire hit. ?You get good dessert, good conversation and a great selection of beverages. ?This place reminds me a lot of chickalicious in the east village which is also amazing, but the portions here are a lot bigger and the wait not so bad since the actual space is much bigger. ?Don't try to kick my butt here, I still love chickalicious, but this is the uptown sister to the downtown goodness - that's all I'm trying to say here.

A Japanese chain dessert bar. ?First location in the U.S. Interior is gorgeous. Japanese desserts w/ 'healthy' ingredients --soy, tofu, sesame, ?along with traditional stuff like yuzu (citrus), anko (the reddish burgundy stuff that is sometimes piled on green tea ice cream) They had shiro-an desserts!! (a transparent, smooth, more delicate sweet bean confectionery. Not as sweet or bean-ey like the red version. RARE in the U.S.) Do not get scared off by the names or descriptions! Most desserts taste A LOT better than they sound. I don't like soy milk and liked their desserts. But I will recommended this to adventurous eaters, fans of Pan/Asian cuisine, and serious Japanese food lovers. ps. Wait a few more weeks until the staff gets their stuff together. Hence minus one star

I recently tried the $18 prix fixe dinner, which came with: -Warm mushroom arugula salad with a great topping of Parmesan cheese -Chicken meatballs (perfectly portioned, I know if they gave me a lot I wouldn't have liked it very much since it is pretty savory) -Arancini which is like a risotto croquette (again, it was perfectly portioned, since it was fairly dense) -Pigs in a duvet (dough was too dry for my liking) ***Chicken & tofu sliders (my all time favorite dish on the menu, and you should try the chicken & tofu burger as the powered up version as well) Other times I have tried ***Trio of tofu dips (love the edamame dip the best) $9 -Housemade tofu salad ?(the tofu is sooo soft and light!) $10 -Sake-infused mac & cheese (you can't really go wrong with mac & cheese especially when there's alcohol involved) $10 -Curry rice (this is the only thing I'm not that impressed with, it's still good) $10 -Brioche french toast (only for brunch, but the coffee syrup makes it so worth waking up for) $11 Desserts I've had: -matcha green tea cr¨¨me br?l¨¦e (they definitely do not skimp out on the matcha flavor) $9 ***warm miso chocolate cake (so decadently chocolate!) $10 signature sweet tofu $7 -black sesame sweet tofu (only wish there was a bigger portion, but love the syrup on top!) $8 -white sesame cake (this is okay, it's a bit dry though) $10 -soymilk soft ice cream sundae (I do like the matcha mochi bits they scatter around the ice cream!) $7 ***KAISEKI prix fixe (changes every month I think, and you get a good variety of their desserts) $17 Be sure to come here for happy hour, drinks are half off before 7:30! I'm not going to lie, I love my alcohol, and I've tried every drink on this menu. ?My favorites: Tokyo Bloody Mary (spicy wasabi aftertaste is definitely unique) Nigori Colada (Pina Colada with a twist) Pomegranate shiso mojito (none of this artificial pomegranate BS either) Harajuku martini (apple puree and lychee, unbeatable combo) So thank you Kyotofu, because of you, I have lost a year's worth of 401K contributions.

Dessert for dinner?! ?I have such brilliant friends. Alright, so before indulging in sweets (which you must walk past in order to get to the dining room, located in the back of the restaurant), we each ordered a Kyotofu sampler. ?The sampler includes a warm mushroom salad, which was prepared with arugula and shaved parmesan. ?It was simple, yet delicious. ?The main course of the sampler is a bento box, which includes chicken meatballs, pigs in a blanket, BBQ unagi, and a chicken and tofu slider. ?My favorite was the unagi, which came wrapped in a savory flaky type pastry. The portion size was perfect because we all still had room for dessert. And it was more tastes for dessert! ?We ordered the dessert tasting menu, which included 5 different "courses" of desserts. ?The tastings were essentially miniature versions of the desserts available on the regular menu, along with some spicy chili truffles. ?The desserts were extremely unique and included items such as green tea cr¨¨me brulee, chocolate tofu pudding (so good!), and my favorite, the decadent miso chocolate cake. ?The cake is served in a pool of caramel sauce, but the caramel is more savory and more viscous (believe it or not) than your standard caramel. I love the ambiance. ?The front of the shop is very much a bakery, but the restaurant in back is cozy and inviting. ?The great music (Postal Service, LCD Soundsystem, The Knife) was also a plus. ? It was surprising to see that a restaurant that specializes in dessert also prepares delicious dinner fare. ?This will be my go-to spot in the area for a unique night out.

Something about the desserts they make at this place just says "made with love" to me. The folks running this place is also quite friendly and inviting, and never really rush you out of the place. The place is quite different, somewhat modern and clean, but the attitude of the place is more casual and laid-back. Tried the chef tasting trio previously and thought they were all quite good. Most recently had the green tea creme brulee and warm chocolate mochi cake. I can't say i like that version of the creme brulee better, but it was definitely different and love green tea ice cream by itself. The chocolate mochi was similiar to a molten chocolate cake, somewhat familiar but still delicious nevertheless. They also serve sake, which is a plus for those guys who are forced to sweet places like this by gfs so at least they will have something. Looking forward to trying their dinner actually, even though it's a dessert bar. I definitely think this place is better than some of the other dessert bars in the city, such as chikalicious or spot.

Quite possibly my favorite dessert place ever. ?Maybe. ?And believe you me, I have tried a lot of desserts in my 2.5 decades on earth. ?The decor in the main dining area is so trendy and clean--I love it. ?It's really small though, so I recommend going after 10pm, when seats free up. I haven't tried their entrees (nothing is made to order, it's all kind of assembly line put together from pre cooked things taken out of tupperware stored in their teeny tiny "kitchen" that has a hot plate and a warming oven but no stove--a little weird), but their desserts are seriously heaven. ?HEAVEN. ?I could not believe that all this was made with tofu! ? We got their signature sweet tofu, mango soy milk froyo, matcha green tea creme brulee, and the strawberry lychee sorbet. One of my friends asked us all to rate them, and all of us had a hard time--it was like choosing between your children (even though I don't have any children)! ?SO GOOD. ?Everything was delicate and light, but creamy and not too sweet. ?Their sweet tofu, like many have said, is more like custard or panna cotta, the creme brulee is so smooth with just the right amount of green tea flavor, and the froyo and sorbet were both deliciously refreshing. I can't rave enough about this place. ?Seriously delicious. ?If you have friends who won't go near tofu, blindfold them, kidnap them, and shove them on the mta to come here. ?It'll be a night they won't forget--for all the right reasons. And I didn't even mention the fact that they give you GREEN TEA FUDGE as a sweet surprise with your bill. ?Give me a napkin, I'm drooling all over my keyboard.

Know its strengths. (I actually give it a 4.5 but am rounding up) Kyotofu - as the name implies, this is a tofu place. I dare say they specialize in desserts. This isn't the place for a meal. Yes, their teas are a bit pricey but you are paying for quality. You get what you pay for at Kyotofu. Their workmanship is exquisite and their staff are helpful and patient. The decor is sleek and comfortable. They are located near Theatre District so great for pre or post theatre. They are definitely my go-to place when I'm trying to show non-NYers around. Now to get them to open on Mondays...

After reading all the great reviews, we had to give this place a try. ?The Black Sesame Sweet Tofu Panna Cotta with green tea syrup was incredibly good, as was the Sweet Potato dessert, and the Green Tea Creme Brulee. ?I think the sake menu might be larger than the restaurant space. Very trendy, progressive music, all white modern decor with mostly Asian crowd. I'm looking forward to the next visit.

I was so excited when Kyotofu first opened that I immediately organized a dessert night out with five of my girlfriends. I had high expectations for the dessert bar, but ended up feeling as though the drinks tasted better than the actual desserts. I was a little taken aback when I saw that Robin Raisfeld rated Kyotofu as the Best New Restaurant in New York Magazine 2007. While I thought it was a novel idea to base all the desserts on tofu, we tried pretty much everything on the menu and I don't think any one dish really stood out. However, I'm hoping they've tweaked the menu a bit since they first opened, and am definitely willing to give the place another try one of these days! NOTEWORTHY: The design of the space looks great (from the same designer as ChikaLicous). Definately order from the drink list, I loved my drink, and my friends' drinks as well! If you're on the lookout for other lovely dessert bars in the city I'd also recommend ChikaLicous, Cha An, or Room4Dessert.

I went for brunch this time and their honey pancakes were so yummy which came with sides of strawberries, currants, whipped cream, and red bean. ?We also got dessert...of course the signature sweet tofu was delicioso and their soft serve ice cream with mochi was huge! ?I also liked the little green tea cookies they gave us at the end.

Kyotofu blew me away this weekend! Round 1 Gia and I tried it for the first time on Saturday and we were overwhelmed at how good the food is. The chicken tofu sliders, barbecued unagi, and mac and cheese were out of this world. We both tried their cocktails and thought that they were weak but trust me the blood orange caipirinhas started to catch up. We finished with the sweet potato cheesecake and we couldn't stop talking about it. We literally were there until they closed at 1:30 AM. Round 2 After spending all Sunday afternoon at the wine expo with fellow yelpers Kevin and Natasha, we convinced them to give tofu a shot. Once again, kyotofu knocked it out the park. They gave us complimentary mimosa's and Bellini's with our meals but the real treat was the sake Sunday special where bottles are half price. We had the smoked salmon donburi, french toast with a Kahlua dipping sauce, the quiche, chicken tofu burger, and of course the mac and cheese. ? After two bottles of sake, Gia decided to get the chefs desert omakase and it ?really took it to the next level! Round 3 Cant wait to go tonight!

Kyotofu fills a niche that the bay area is in dire need of-Japanese dessert bar that serves modern Japanese desserts along with savory bites. This place is definitely up my alley! The quality of the food lives up to its appearance. Beautiful but cute, neat and conservative with careful attention to detail, Kyotofu is quite representative of the Japanese culture. The dessert omakase was my pick and came with the signature sweet tofu, matcha green tea creme brulee, and valrhona chocolate cake. Each dessert was exquisite and very well prepared. The taste and presentation exceeded its cost of $11 by far. I didn't think I could be any more impressed, but my boyfriend's dessert had me walking on Cloud 9. His black sesame tofu was reminiscent of the Asian tofu dessert I had on a trip to Saigon, Vietnam but so much more-it was exceptional! The texture reminded me of my favorite dessert panna cotta, but a lot lighter and silkier. It was hard to believe that I was eating tofu. The hoji-cha syrup that accompanied it brought the dessert to a whole new level of ooooh and ahhhh. Kyotofu needs to come to the bay area but of course, it's already at a good place in one of the greatest culinary cities in the world.

Ehhhhh is the only sound I can formulate when asked about Kyotofu. My friend and I decided that we'd pop in for dessert, and were seated on stools at the window overlooking 9th Avenue. It took awhile to be approached by our overall nice but occasionally dumb waiter, and we ordered the animitsu and the blood orange blueberry tofu cheesecake. My friend also ordered what I thought was the tiniest glass I've ever seen filled with sparkling sake; though tasty it was overpriced at $10, I thought. When the desserts finally came out to us, which is odd considering that virtually nothing is necessarily baked or at a hot temperature, we had managed to score seats in the more romantic but hopelessly dim back, an enemy for picture taking. The cheesecake was very tasty, definitely, and I loved the white bean cream shaped into a little oval. The fresh blood orange segments and blueberries, along with what I believe was a goji berry, were refreshing touches, but I was disappointed by the black sesame streusel, which sounded like it would be delicious. Paired with the cheesecake, I guess it added texture, but other than that it had no discernable taste, and reminded me of crunchy lint. The animitsu was much more refreshing and overall the better dish. Fresh blackberries topped a blackberry sorbet along with tofu mochi and other gelatinous tidbits. It came with two of their signature yellow/green cookies, though unfortunately all I could think of was "sugar" when eating them; they were soft and chewy too, however, which I liked. When our bill came out, we were presented with two little passionfruit marshmallows, which I think would go great with chocolate in a 'smores sandwich. Overall, I don't know, ?I just wasn't very wowed by what I was eating. Everything being so minute, I was also disappointed in that respect, and even more so when water hadn't been given to rinse the sugar from my throat. I think it may have been their off night.

"You're in New York.

So that was two days ago. But after I sent a cordial but stern message through Kyotofu's website the day I visited the restaurant I was quickly contacted via email by the co-owner of the restaurant the very same night. ?The owner was eager to identify what went wrong, what time I was at the restaurant, who served me, and how they can make it up to me (us). ?In the end, the restaurant was attentive only after the fact and for that I'll upgrade my rating to a 3 star. ?When rating restaurants, I think it's always fair to let the establishment know what went wrong and give them one chance to improve their shortcomings. ?If they do then they deserve a break; if not--wrath. ?

A lovely little Japanese dessert bar... at least when my friends and I aren't there. First off, apologies to everyone at Kyotofu the other night. This otherwise cute could-be romantic (we definitely ruined a few dates) dessert bar was turned upside down when we came here celebrating/commiserating one friend's last week in NYC before his bank ships him off to Hong Kong for two years. They were surprisingly accomodating, providing us with all the necessary materials to do sake bombs, wasting 2 perfectly good $90 bottles of sake in the process. Of course this led to someone being obnoxiously loud, which in turn attracted a Japanese TV crew, and I guess we're famous in Japan now. If not, we'll just have to live vicariously through the actress we met there. Oh right and the food and stuff was good too. I was really surprised at how much I liked the sansho-pepper tofu cheese cake. Very creamy consistency, not what I expected at all (in a good way). The warm chestnut mochi chocolate cake was a little drier than I'd have liked but also a winner. My expectations were low coming in, but it may prove to be competition for Chikalicious downtown. Or maybe that's just the sake talking. Do yourself a favor and check this place out!

I definitely feel like I was in Japan with their small portions. The dinner menu was okay (we got the otsumami sampler with 6 of the 8 entrees). Some of the dishes were very creative, like the bbq unagi in phyllo dough and chicken and tofu sliders. But others not so original like the pigs in duvet and the smoked samon onigiri was a big disappointment. HOWEVER, the 4 stars come in for the desserts. We got the warm miso chocolate cake and the black sesame sweet tofu. The chocolate cake had a nice miso aftertaste that distinguished itself from a normal chocolate cake. The green tea on the side was also delicious and a wonderful compliment to the cake itself. The black sesame sweet tofu is a winner. It was all I imagined and more. There was no ingredient that overpowered the other and the experience was wonderful from the first skeptical spoonful to the last scrape. I wish I could have this for dessert every night. I will definitely be back for the dessert.

What a cute, fun place! ?The decor makes this Japanese dessert spot intimate and date-ish with a contemporary vibe. ?Even the not-as-cool bar stool seating in the front lets you watch the chefs make their masterpieces. ?We didn't have to wait at all at 8:30 on a Friday night, but I hear the lines can get ridiculous, so plan accordingly. The menu is limited to desserts and alcohol (I spotted sake, shochu, wine, and teas). ?We ordered the black sesame sweet tofu (kind of a spin on dou hua, a silken Chinese tofu snack) and the strawberry anmitsu. ?I loved them both! ?The tofu was more like custard than the dou hua I'm used to, but the sesame flavor was subtle without being overpoweringly sweet. ?The anmitsu was unlike anything I had ever tried: a mixture of fresh fruit, mochi, berry-flavored agar cubes, and a strange gritty paste of unknown origins. ?It was refreshing and tasty! ?Smacktabulous. I wish we could have ordered more but we were full from dinner. ?I could see the bill adding up quickly if you're hungry and/or order from the drink menu, but our bill was 20$ for the two desserts. ?I recommend Kyotofu as a sweet ending to a dinner in the area, or maybe as a start to a later night :)

On my quest to find a froyo place to cap off my day, I was delighted to discover that there was a Japanese dessert place in the general hell's kitchen vicinity. So, I decided to stroll over. The place had a great upscale bar-like atmosphere and the woman working there was very nice and helpful. I ordered the sweet tofu dessert, which also came with a little cup of sugar syrup to pour on top. Overall, I wasn't super entirely impressed. I've had this tofu type dish in other Asian dessert places, and this one just seemed too simple and upscale for what it was really worth. Really, nothing fantastic, so slightly disappointed. Great atmosphere though, and I'll come back if I get the chance.

I must have ordered the wrong stuff. So my reviews are going to be biased. I saw the chef making perfectly shaped and displayed dessert dishes for sit-down clients. I did not have time for that. I opted to try out their mini-cupcakes and cookies. The flavor was great; I got the black sesame, green tea and chocolate. But honestly I was disappointed in the cupcakes. They taste more like muffins. The cookies are fine but again, nothing special about them. I think next time I have to try to REAL cupcakes and the sit-down menus to understand what other people are raving about. But so far, Chikalicious in the East Village, is a clear winner for me.

I was impressed. My friend and I contemplated to eat dessert elsewhere, but since we were already in the area, we decided to check this place out. The venue is a bit cramped, considering the place is equivalent to the size of my bedroom and there were like 10 other people waiting to be seated...However, it wasn't that bad. Their tables were lit with Christmas lights and the dark interior with modern, white decor, all somehow gave the place character. ? We ended up ordering the green tea creme brulee and mochi fudge brownie, and the most interesting tastes occurred in my mouth. It was totally unexpected, but the brownie was salty and sweet at the same time. And the more we ate, we discovered that the caramel was the salty culprit. Weird. Salty caramel -- you just have to try it. As for the green tea creme brulee, which was my favorite of the two, had this amazing texture with the most subtle green tea taste. They also give you these teeny tiny wooden spoons to eat your dessert with. Everything about this place was super cute.

SHI-BU-YEAAAH! ?or, Shibuya. it's an exclaimation AND a delectably refreshing cocktail here at the mochi-licious (and lactose-intolerant-friendly) desset lounge in hell's kitchen. the sleekly designed, minimalistic space is a bit daunting/confounding for the passerby-- the 'main' dining area is tucked into a square room in the back. the front has a small bar area and the kitchen, where customers can oooh and ahhh in all their voyeuristic glory at the chefs making kyotofu's glorious desserts. and what desserts! the menu consists of 'exotic' desserts where tofu and mochi (a chewy, glutinous dough frequently found in asian cooking) are often feature ingredients. ?i had the the sansho-pepper tofu cheesecake-- which tastes richer and creamier than you can ever imagine. ?and, it is beautifully plated-- dotted with candied ginger and a thin wisp of a wafer-like cookie. ?my friend's warm chestnut mochi chocolate cake was seductively gooey on the inside. ? kyotofu also serves a limited menu of savory dishes (tofu, edamame, etc.) but desserts are the centerpiece. ?and the extensive cocktail menu-- including a diverse sake selection-- are also highlights. including my shibuya martini, which was apparently dreamed up exclusively for me since includes two of my favorite flavors: muddled ginger, guava, and shochu (a japanese liqueur).

Perhaps yelp hyped this place up too much for me, but I found their food merely okay. I would have probably given them a 2 for tastiness, but they get an extra star for being very creative. I came here and ordered the smoked salmon donburi bowl (smoked salmon and cream cheese artfully laid out on a bed of rice mixed with some odd sort of capers) as well as the sesame tofu while my friend ordered the chicken tsukune burger and the miso chokos with green tea and red tea chocolates. My donburi bowl tasted oddly like a Philadephia sushi roll, which would have been great but the weird capers really put a damper on things. They had an odd flavor that I didn't like, so I spent a lot of time picking them out of what would have been an enjoyable dish. It came with a choice of cold soba or salad (I chose soba) and it was fresh tasting and quite good. And then came the much raved about sesame tofu. It was tasty, but I was still a little disappointed. I expected more sesame flavor, and after a while I just didn't feel like eating it anymore (the cup is quite large), which is rare with desserts. After a few bites it just sort of tasted bland to me. The miso chokos were interesting and very creative, but I don't know if I would want to eat them again, the same with the red tea and green tea chocolates. All in all, a slightly disappointing experience. I'm very used to Asian and Japanese flavors, but I just don't think I'm a fan of mixing them in this way. I most likely won't return as it wasn't very cheap, and there are better meals to be had out there. As for the sesame tofu, it was good, but I think I like black sesame flavored desserts better as ice cream because the texture provides a bit more interest in the mouth. This place was also way smaller than I'd expected, it probably only seats maybe 23 or so people comfortably.

I've been to Kyotofu twice so far. The first time I had the Warm Miso Chocolate Cake (Chocolate-Black Soybean Ganache, Saikyo Miso, Green Tea Anko Cream) with the Ginger Tangerine Tea. I thought the chocolate cake is decent, it is rich but I couldn't taste much of the Miso though. I wish they'd put more of the Saikyo Miso on the side, because I believe it goes very well with the chocolate flavour (who'd have thought?). The tea itself isn't bad, there's definitely undertones of tangerine and it's a delicious tea. The second time I ordered the Black Sesame Sweet Tofu (Hoji-Cha Roasted Green Tea Syrup, White Sesame Tuile, Goji Berry) with Lavender Tea. I love the sweet tofu very much, it's gelatinous and the sweetness is so delicate, definitely goes really well with the syrup. I didn't think I needed the syrup at first, but the more I ate the tofu, the more I found that the syrup complemented the black sesame flavour. I'm rather amused to find out that Goji Berry is the red thingie that I normally throw into my chinese ginseng chicken soup at home; it's interesting to see it turn up in a dessert item. The lavender tea is enjoyable too, very herbal and fragrant, truly hits the spot on a cold windy rainy night. I like the presentation of everything served here, including the porcelain teapots and cool teacups with the slight off-centered curve (sleek and sexy!). The experience I've had here appealed to all my senses. I also appreciate the portions served here (compared to say, Chikalicious, of which I'm also a big fan). Looking forward to going back a few more times to sample other items on the menu! Oh, I forgot to add that one time with the check, they offered a complimentary pair of Blueberry Marshmallows that not only looked as cute as a button, the texture and flavours were absolutely AMAZING!!!!! Seriously these had to be the best marshmallows I've ever tasted. Really.

When Kyotofu first opened, I became excited knowing that Hell's Kitchen would finally have a place dedicated to desserts. ?After letting the hype clear, I was able to sample some of it myself and two things came to mind: ?expensive and overrated. ? The place has some beautiful desserts with some extremely artistic presentation. ?Like the desserts, the interior is very trendy and the contemporary decor is dimly lit for the perfect quiet, sensual evening. ?My chocolate brownie was easily devoured in two "spoonfuls" and appeared to be no larger than a mini-hockey puck or a mini-ice cream sandwich. ? Kyotofu tries almost too hard to be an upscale dessert joint with little regard to portions and price. ?At least the service is fantastic and that would be the only reason I'd continue to come back here.

I see that this place got some pretty awful Valentine's Day reviews, which is understandable, A co worker of mine also went there that day, and complained about the service, but the food was rated top notch. I however, did not go back that day but a few days afterward when i experienced the joy that is strawberry shortcake. The nigori sorbet was in-credi-ble and the the cake went down like butter. I also had the suggested sake, Sakura Emaki and it was indeed complimentary and so good. I cannot say enough fabulous things about this place, so I'll say no more.

Once we stepped inside and noticed a young Gentleman in Girl schmoozing formation bar-stool slouching position facing street-front, it was instantly recognizable this establishment was for impressing the Ladies of a certain caliber. ?The Menu, Hardware(Interior Design, Tableware), even the Software(Pink!

The fusion Japanese/Western mix of these Desserts gives me slight reminders of my Asakusa adventures, especially from the Soymilk Soft Ice Cream Sundae and the flavours offered this night. ?Memories aside, none of the Desserts really spoke to me. ?I know for a fact as I lost track of which Dessert was which within the Kaiseki and was just spooning every part looking for that special one that clicked. ?Oh well.

I love Japanese desserts. ?Not too sweet and super cute presentation. ?And this is what Kyotofu is all about. ?If you're looking for super sugary, rich desserts, this place is not for you! ?I stopped by for a mid-afternoon snack and couldn't resist ordering the omakase 5-course kaiseki dessert. ?I might as well try what the chef recommends right? ?And a good choice that was! signature sweet tofu w/kuromitsu black sugar syrup - yum yum yum! ?i'm not even a fan of kuromitsu usually but this was very delicious. ?the soft sweet tofu was excellent. warm miso chocolate cake - probably the least interesting. ?simple, good chocolate cake with green tea cream on top rhubarb-strawberry cobbler - rhubarb must be in season and i'm loving it! ?the warm cobbler mixed with the tart and sweetness of the strawberry and rhubarb. ?excellent combination! sweet potato tofu cheesecake - i love cheesecake, and this was definitely a top contender black sesame macarons - oh i wish i could eat macarons all day. ?a little dryer than I prefer, but still very good. We also had a pot of tangerine green tea, which I highly recommend! ?Very delicate flavors and a great compliment to the dessert. ?The staff was super nice and friendly and it was a great way to spend the afternoon. ?The place is pretty small though, so don't expect to walk in with a big crowd. ?Next time I'll have to try all their cookies and other take-home baked goods!

Meh. I was really excited about this place and really REALLY wanted to love it, but no dice. The biggest problem here for me was the inconsistency, certain dishes are orgasmically delicious while others are so middle of the road it hurts. I absolutely blissed out on their tofu and coffee syrup dish only to be disappointed by their totally over-hyped cookies. Nice interior design, very "i-Poddy" 'ala Chikalicious or the Chanel store. I like how the entrance to their bathroom is an obelisk of darkness at the back of the restaurant.

Bottom line: many creative, delicious, overpriced options Desserts with 5+ primary ingredients (You know the ones that go, "cashew sorbet WITH mochi wafers AND yuzu berry compote AND drunken rice balls AND toasted cucumber slices AND mountain goat berry plant leaves AND....). Good selection of teas. It's small but I've never felt unwelcome when I just wanted to sit and chat for a while with a friend. So, yeah, I like it a lot and it makes me happy every time I go. But it does leave a rather large hole in the pocket for what is essentially a cup of tea and something sweet. Definitely get your own dessert instead of sharing. They're not that big, and, trust me, you'll want the whole thing.

I thought this place was different....good different! ?The fact that everything is tofu was pretty cool. I had the black sesame tofu with hoji-cha sweet sauce. ?My dining mate had the warm molten tofu cake. ?She thought it had an interesting consistency but thought it was very tasty. ?The cake was a little bit thicker than regular cake but wonderfully chocolately. ?My black sesame tofu was light and it had a good taste. The reason I wanted to go here originally was for the cupcakes. ?I didn't see them on the menu so I was a little sad, but I asked after we ordered our desserts and was able to get them. ?I ordered one of each type: chocolate, yuzu, and coconut (I think). ?The cupcakes traveled a long way from NY to VA since I was bringing them home for my brother. The chocolate and yuzu cupcakes were delicious....the chocolate one was nice and dense with a great fudgey flavor. ?The yuzu one had a really nice strong yuzu flavor. ?The coconut one was only eh...okay. ?The first two cupcakes were delicious and I would definitely go back for more!

Sweet ending to a romantic dinner - Valentines or not. My husband and I discovered this tiny gem (and I mean tiny). The last time my hubby and I went, we sat on bar stools in between the kitchen and what seems to be the coffee/beverage station. We watched how each plate was treated like a canvas and the items were crafted to create art. Really, the presentation of the food in itself is well worth the visit here. The staff seemed rushed but not rude. They were still pleasant. The manager checked in on us to make sure everything is in order. If you have an adventurous palate, this is one place you wouldn't want to miss.

Not a place for dinner. My sister's noodles were mediocre and my tofu salad dish didn't really satisfy or wow me at all. I have had better more tasteful tofu salads. The desserts were all wonderful though. We were a party of 5 and all the desserts were great. I recommend for dessert but find elsewhere for dinner-- the dinner menu is limiting and not impressive.

always have loved this place cuz i can't taste the tofu. ?But now I know why. ?This place isn't strictly restricted to tofu ingredients. ?They are not a vegan restaurant and do use some products to enhance the taste. ?Regardless, I love their presentation. ?Desserts are not too sweet and feel light and airy! ?very easy to get a table during the weeknights! ?hype must not be as high anymore =( This time around, got the following: - strawberry cheesecake - cheesecake was dense tasted very tofuey... love the fruity sorbet. ? - shortcake cookies made of tofu as well, crunchy - tofu sundae - more chocolatey and tasted like frozen yogurt although milk made outta soy milk staff is very knowledgeable and almost poetic when explaining the menu even giving recommendations for sake that is more appropriate with the dishes rather than what is on the actual menu!

Hey, went here for dessert, pre- broadway show. (I would not have wanted to try their dinner). This place reminds me of Chickalicious's Dessert Club. But you're not so much on display eating their food because there's [albeit limited] seating n the back. We got the Kaiseki prix fixe ($17). The first course was their signature sweet tofu, which was my favorite. It was like flan, only sweeter. Second came the chocolate brownie (this was really rich), matcha green tea tofu cheesecake, and a strawberry agar dish. Thirdly, was soymilk soft ice cream in vanilla and chocolate. We also got the [$8] black sesame sweet tofu (the syrup comes on the side in a shotglass-like cup). This was like mousse, smooth and good. Thinking we may have not ordered enough, by the end of the dessert meal, we were both pleasantly surprised. Not a good place for groups larger than 4, it seems like a nice place for a casual date. Taste-wise, I would still prefer Chickalicious for their more inventive fruity combos. But Kyotofu gives more for the money.

Dessert, dessert, dessert, oh how I love thee? Even after a very filling dinner, I insisted on coming here for dessert. We were seated promptly on a Friday night and perused the dessert menu with glee. ( Well I did, but my friend mostly seemed queasy at the thought of ordering more food.) Don't worry those food readers, I still made him order something so I could try it too! Green Tea Creme Brulee: The star of it all - from the first crack of the crust with the spoon to the last spoonful it was all delicate, green tea-flavored and delicious. YUM. It is pretty well proportioned too, with a small cracker and some tart tasting icing (?) on the side. Signature Sweet Tofu: Upon first bite it was smooth, delicate and creamy. Upon more bites? Well, it started tasting more and more like that dafu faa you can get in Chinatown. Still, it was quite good and presentation was spectacular. Chocolate Cupcake: I insisted on getting one because I read reviews about it. Who knew that it also came with a side of ice cream and berries? Oh right, the waitress who told me when I specifically ordered it. Given that we already ordered the Creme Brulee and Sweet Tofu, we managed to finish this. ( At least I did because I had the courage and strength to muster through the delicious desserts. That's right, I'm a trooper.) ?The cupcake was crispy on the top ( which is something I always love) and oozy chocoaltey in the middle. Worth the hype. Add the ice cream on the side and BAM - you make me a very happy girl. Ice Matcha Latte: We were pleasantly surprised that this drink wasn't overly sweet. You can really taste the green tea / matcha in this. I'm sold on this drink. I left feeling quite happy and dessert-satisfied.

Bookmarked Kyotofu a while ago and finally went there for some late night desserts. The dessert selection was limited albeit all looked interesting and tempting! I had a soymilk ice cream, and a green tea latte Both were delicious! The decor is trendy and intimate, perfect for date nights. Highly recommended! One downside: not enough space between tables. We had to adjust our table several times for someone to get in and out!

The desserts are absolutely great but very limited selection for real food. i went there for brunch and saw only 5 main course option and you can a free cocktail along with your main course. I tried their bellini, it was good, and i ordered the chicken burger which was pretty good as the chicken patti are mixed with tofu, and the size was pretty decent for me, not too overwhelming, too bad they dont served with fries (tofu fries would have been nice), instead it came with sweet potato chips (cold). For desserts, we tried the sampler, the black sesame tofu, the cupcakes.. i definitely love the desserts more than the main.

It was little after 9PM, my friend and I are here for their dessert. ?At first the place looked dead, empty, desolate. ?Wow! ?Ehhh! ?Wrong, the crowd was in the back of the restaurant. ?It was actually packed. We decided to share the dessert Kaiseke which was a 3 course tasting for $17. Additionally I ordered the Brown rice iced tea and my friend ordered the green tea iced tea. ?The brown rice iced tea was interesting, taste of brown rice with with hints of coffee. - Miso chocolate molten cake with house special tofu and black sugar - Jelly and black sesame cheesecake - House Sundae: Two flavors of japanese ice cream with mixed berry compote Although the desserts were good tasting and healthier for you, it was okay, nothing memorable. ?I might have to come back and do an a la carte deal next time.

After many visits and accumulating probably many hours of waiting at Chikalicious, I've always wondered when and where more similar dessert bars would open up in NYC. ?Well, Kyotofu is a good competitor and is definitely enjoying some good buzz and its share of a crowd lately. ?I've been here a few times now and here's what I love about it: - unique selection of yummy light desserts, most of which are beautifully presented and served with some complementary side of ice cream, sauce, and/or syrup (faves are black sesame tofu and the warm chestnut mochi chocolate cake) - good selection & descriptions of sake, shochu, and cocktails (loved the kome kome sake and the top sparkling wine on their menu) - a nice ambiance... cool, modern interior What I didn't love about the place: - the "savory" selections on the menu... don't bother... they don't call this a dessert bar for nothing - the crystal plum sake anmitsu dessert... not much taste and not enough mochi! ? - the dry, dense pancake dessert with a weak peanut butter flavoring Overall, Kyotofu is cute, delicious, and a great bar / restaurant alternative. ?Definitely worth a visit and the wait. ?In my opinion, not as great as Chikalicious but still a good addition to the dessert scene.

Think of this restaurant as a huge, soft teddy bear that you just want to hug and hug and hug. That's how cute this restaurant is. A friend told me about this tiny, gem of a place and lo and behold, it's in my neighborhood. We had dessert here but their food looked pretty good too! Everything is in compliance with all things authentically Japanese. Light, delicate, and too adorable for words. My friend got the ice cream sundae and it was everything Haagen Daaz is not. Talk about ice cream that tastes delicious but doesn't make you feel like you just expanded two pant sizes. I got the sweet tofu (what they are known for) and it was PERFECT! Creamy, smooth, and just sweet enough. It's a little pricey for dessert but definitely worth it if you are a tofu fanatic like myself. It looks like a great place to sake and dessert so gentlemen, if you're hoping to hold your date's hand (there was a lot of that going on around me)----this may be a great pit stop before you attempt that awkward first date kiss on the apartment stoop.

I love tofu fa. A Chinese dessert made with silken tofu topped with ginger syrup. The version they make here brings the dish to a whole new level. It's so rich and creamy, taste almost like a tofu custard. I have never had tofu so smooth and velvety. Instead of breaking up in your mouth like tofu normally do, the tofu melts away like butter on your tongue. It's ridiculously good. The tasting menu was OK but nothing outstanding. It's hard to top the signature sweet tofu and that's what makes Kyotofu a dessert destination.

Love this place! So cute! I've actually been wanting to go since it's opened but never got a chance. I finally got to go with my girlfriend for Labor Day weekend. Interior's nice modern clean white cushion seats and some counter seats in the entrance. We got the Curry, Chicken Tofu Sliders for dinner. The sliders definitely was delicious! It had a good mayo based sauce and shiso added a good Japanese twist. Portions are definitely on the smaller side. For dessert we had the Ice Cream Sundae and Chocolate cake with Passion fruit. Ice cream sundae came with vanilla bean and white sesame swirl. I thought it was really good! The brownie crumble and strawberries, and pockey added a good variations of tastes for me. Although the green tea mochi wasn't really a mochi... The texture was a bit weird it was like a yokan or kanten consistency not mochi. Oh well maybe it was supposed to be that. The chocolate cake and passion fruit was good but I liked the sundae better. Next time I'll have to try the black sesame tofu with hojicha syrup! The customers were mostly Asian and mostly girls when we went. Food's delicious so I'd recommend food lovers checking this place out.

I was taken to this little japanese dessert house a few years ago on a date. And let me tell you, it was one helluva of a date....not so much the company, but very much the sweets. Since I couldn't decide on a single dessert being my first time there, I decided to give in to my inner greed and ordered the $17 '3 course pre-fixe' dessert sampler (yes, I eat on my dates). I can't remember all three courses, but I do specifically remember the black sesame sweet tofu being outstanding (I think I could've gone for seconds). It was light in texture but strong in sesame flavor and the side of 'hoji-cha' syrup' was a nice addition to the tofu. I've taken friends and dates back to this place over the years and have never been disappointed. I've tried most of their dessert selection, which includes the green tea matcha cheesecake, strawberry shortcake, soymilk soft serve ice cream, and warm mochi chocolate cake....but what I really go back for is the black sesame sweet tofu and the signature sweet tofu which I've never been able to find a replica of anywhere in the city. WARNING: this is a NOT a place to go for family size portions....save that for serendipity's or friendly's! The portions are small and delicate....so be warned!

This was SUCH a great find! We started with the trio tofu dips (substituted the parsnip chips instead of flatbread, since we were both gluten free). All three were DELICIOUS, and very beautifully prepared. We split the silken tofu salad, which was also wonderful. The tofu center was creamy and soft, very pleasant with the savory salad and bits of broiled onion. A definite highlight! We finished with a (free) salted caramel gluten free cupcake, and the green tea creme br?l¨¦e. What a TREAT. The creme br?l¨¦e came with apricot ginger sorbet, which paired with the aforementioned beautifully. On top of the fantastic food, our server was friendly and attentive, and the place is cute to boot! Definitely check this place out!

Never disappointed with the Black Sesame Sweet Tofu! Unfortunately, that's the only dish sweet or savory that is consistently good and well rounded. But each time I step in for my black sesame fix, I always try the latest creation which, though may not be entirely perfect, at least they're creative.

Vistiting NYC, kyotofu is a hidden hip chic place along the street tucked away with no sign (of course). We felt it was probably a more local hang-out than a tourist place due to the no-sign, mostly Asians filled the room, and they seemed rather comfortable and familiar w/the place. The only thing close to the tourist-y feel was the prices (pretty expensive - especially the drinks but what can ya expect?) We were seated after a few mins of waiting - which was surprising b/c the place is pretty tiny. It had a mini small bar in the front and the back was a medium sized room with booths lining the walls, tables, and across was chairs. It could have easily been someone's large-sized studio. Nobody seemed to mind being cramped. It was pretty loud with modern music and very dim with low sexy lighting. Boyfriend ordered a few Japanese beers while I ordered a Kyoto Bellini - white peach, rice shochu, champagne. Delish. We also ordered a bottle of sparkling sake - Hana Hou Hou Shu (rose), Okayama which is the rose of sparkling sakes, with hibiscus petals and rose hip. We didn't know too much about sake so this was what our server recommended. It was sparkling - like champagne and definitely a LOT better tasting than regular sake which can be strong and bitter for me. We downed the whole bottle in 4-5 shot sized cups. We ordered the otsumami sampler - 4 plates at $4 each. You can choose 4,6, or 8. We chose Japanese curry puffs / housemade curry wrapped in a savory crust ,chicken & tofu sliders / teriyaki grilled with shiso in a brioche bun, side of lotus root chips, pigs in a duvet / berkshire pork sausage wrapped in puff pastry with spicy mustard, barbequed unagi / japanese sea eel wrapped in phyllo dough with sansho pepper Each dish is tiny - i'm saying 1.5 bites and those are "my petite" bites and not my boyfriend's bite. The curry puffs were very fluffy, crispy, and flavorful. The crush was very buttery and savory. The chicken and tofu sliders were surprisingly yummy with their lotus root chips (very similar to terra chips) but nothing special. The pigs in a duvet were also tasty and not too spicy with the mustard but definitely had a slight kick. The barbecued unagi was veryyy interesting. The phyllo dough wrapped around it gave it a nice crunch crisp which went well with the eel and the pepper was surprising since I'm so used to eel over rice (donburi) or regular sushi. Overall, good choices. For dessert, we went with the Chef's pre-fixed tasting menu of 3 courses for $17 (this was a great deal!!) For the first course, we got signature sweet tofu / white sesame tuile, kuromitsu black sugar syrup, dried apricot. OMG - I loved this dessert. I love tofu but usually wouldn't see it as a "dessert." The white tofu was very simple, fresh, and just enough firmness ?to be considered tofu and not flan but not too custard-y. The black sugar syrup with it was perfect - not too sweet and but enough that kept you going at the dish again to grab another bite. I vaguely remember the dried apricot but it was also very dark so maybe it was bits of it in there? Second course which was 3 courses in itself!: ?The dessert on the left: rhubarb-strawberry cobbler / tofu biscuit, shiso mint ice cream. Boyfriend loved the rhubarb cobbler along with the tofu biscuit. I love the crumbled tofu biscuit that made everything more chewy and crumbly but not crunchy. It was not too sweet and fresh but I can't remember much else.... I remember loving the shiso mint ice cream - subtle and not too strong. This was the most filling of the desserts probably. The one in the middle: warm miso chocolate cake / valrhona chocolate soybean ganache, green tea cream. Very warm, chocolate oozed goodness. Again, not too strong on the flavors here and not too sweet. The green tea ice cream was fantastic - enough green tea so it was not bitter but enough so I could *tell* it was green tea. Matched flavors very well with the chocolate. I'm not the biggest fan of chocolate but it was a small enough portion that I could throughly enjoy it all. The last one: passion fruit tofu cheesecake / coconut sorbet, yamamomo peach. Again, loved this one! I love anything passion fruit and this was paired with tofu and cheesecake!? The cheesecake was not the regular gross kind that you can get at the super market but less dense and less...cheesy? Very light. The passion fruit was like a jello but a little more firm and was very smooth. Definitely the most "light and fresh fruity" dessert of the night. Third course: Pairing of ice creams - The chocolate and ginger ice cream. Great subtle flavors - if it had too much ginger, it would have been very rich. Overall , good presentation. It was pretty much about the presentation - quite beautiful & modern. It's a tease in flavors - subtle and gentle. You will not get rich dark chocolates that one bite is enough to ?enough to have you reeling but you want MORE bites. Service was great - very attentive & didn't rush or upsell.

The food here was very hit or miss, leaning towards miss. My party of four tried both prix fixes and a few other dishes to complement them. The soba noodles were good although there was no green tea flavor to them, as was the eel and curry rice arancini. ?The rice in the red snapper nigiri was gummy and extremely unappetizing, and my friend commented that he could get higher quality hot dogs in chinatown than what was served in the pigs in a blanket. I understand that this is a dessert place, but the desserts weren't even that great. I don't understand the fuss over the sesame based tofus, they were pretty bland and came with syrups that were too sweet. If you're going for a black sesame flavored dessert you can go to any high quality chinese restaurant and get gee ma wu, which is a black sesame based dessert with the same basic consistency of the black sesame tofu but with much more flavor. The green tea chocolate souffle was one of the better things I had that night. I was going to give it three stars only because the drinks were good, and I happened to catch the happy hour, but then the waiter spilled a drink on me. Nice.

My girlfriend and I came here to catch up during a lazy Sunday afernoon. Kyotofu was a great place to do that - spacious, modern decor, and air conditioned. New York Magazine gave them the title of "Best Cupcake," so naturally I had to try it. Though it was very chocolate-y and moist, it tasted more like a cake than a traditional cupcake. My friend ordered the sorbet trio (some sort of mixture of passionfruit, raspberry, sake and yuka fruit). It was good, but not $9 worth good.

To be honest, I wasn't enthused about going here. I thought there would be better places in NYC to try. But when your lady is excited and wants to try a place she researched on Yelp, you go along. So that's how we came to Kyotofu. She wanted to try their desserts and selected their dessert tapas while I half-heartedly chose the Chocolate Souffle Cupcake. Seemed like it would be palate-pleasing and wouldn't disappoint. Several minutes later though, I overheard a woman two tables down order the Black Sesame Sweet Tofu ($8). Hearing my lady mention that it was one of their most popular desserts and seeing the woman order it made me change my mind. I immediately beckoned our kind waitress to see if I could change my order. She checked with the kitchen and said it would be OK. A tray was presented to me in which a large glass cup half filled with the black sesame tofu and a single dried red berry atop of it. A golden white sesame tuile was draped over the top of the cup. To the left was a shot glass filled with the hoji-cha syrup. I was skeptical that this would be good, but I was totally wrong. You could taste the subtle toastiness of the black sesame and the syrup added a sweetness that was not overbearing. The texture was something out of this world. It was like panna cotta, only much smoother and silkier. That dish changed my whole perspective on sweet tofu dishes. I became a believer and only wish I had the opportunity to eat that dish again whenever I could.

I tried the tofu salad and the barbequed unagi. ?While I loved the silky tofu in the salad and the dressing on the side that involved yuzu (had to look up what it was -- looks kind of like a longan) citrus vinigrette, it was a little heavy on the arugula, I would have liked more beets. ?It felt like I was eating a disproportionately large amount of arugula with each bite. ?So they could work on the ratio, but the silkty tofu really works well in it. ? The barbequed unagi is delicious - love the flakey pastry the eel is wrapped in, very light yet satisfying. ?The Sampler is just okay -- not a big fan of the pigs in a duvet and the chicken and tofu slider is alright. ? I got to explore more dessert options, and am delighted to report that desserts continue to be the real win here. ?Soy Soft Serve Sundae is really refreshing, as is their Signature Sweet Tofu. ?The sweet tofu, which I avoided in the past because I feared it would be too similar to dowfufa, is just the right amount of sweetness. ?It comes with a dark syrup that reminds me of molasses, and reminded my friends of a chinese cough syrup they had as children. ?Oddly enough, this is not a bad thing. ?Somehow it works, and you can add as much or as little of the syrup as you like. ?I may even like the signature sweet tofu more than the black sesame, and I'm a huge fan of the sesame. ?It just leaves you feel lighter at the end. ? Service is also very good here -- I once came here with two friends, only to have one of them reveal a "mild" soy allergy after we were seated. ?Lovely. ?We asked the waiter (who is always there, is rather cute, and has veiny arms) to point out the desserts that did not have soy, and he suggested the Anmitsu and the Matcha Green Tea Creme Brulee. ?Later, my friend reported a slight tingling in her lips after eating the Anmitsu, and let the waiter know, just as a courtesy, that she thought there may have been traces of soy in the dessert. ?Not surprising, given that we were at a soy-based dessert spot... in any case, we weren't expecting anything out of it, just wanted to let him know. ?But he was extra kind and gave us free mini-cupcakes and extra free financiers! ?We were ready to be rolled out of there by the end. ? ? Items I will definitely be re-ordering in the future: ?Barbequed unagi, Green Tea Creme Brulee, Signature Sweet Tofu, Black Sesame Tofu, Soy Sundae. ?I remember a delectable Rhubarb crisp from the summer menu, would love to see that back on the menu for this year. ?As long as they continue to serve quality, creative desserts, this will continue to be a must-go.

Finger Lickin' good? Well apparently the chef thought so!! My friends and I came here on a Saturday night and there was a bit of a wait - about half hour. So we waited by the door which looked into their kitchen. During this half hour, we observed a lot of unsanitary "habits". -The tofu puddings are pre-made and when she was taking them out of the fridge, she puts her finger inside of the cup to grab multiple cups. She did not touch the tofu pudding. But that's not cool. -She took off excess liquid off a plate while plating and then licked her finger!! She did not wash her hands during the half hour we were there and she does everything by hand with no gloves. She transferred these fresh baked cupcakes with those same hands and not a tong. She touches the ice cream to get it out of the scoop. ICKKK! So after all this, we still ate there because we waited so long already. I have to say we all enjoyed our desserts. We tried the green tea creme brulee, black sesame tofu pudding and a green tea/chocolate soft serve sundae with mochi. Everything was really good and not too sweet or heavy. My friend and I got a green tea latte and it was room temperature when they brought it over so we sent it back. When we were leaving, we went outside to check out their sanitary grade (which all restaurants are require to post in NY). The paper was stuck to the bottom left corner and it said "Grade Pending" Oops - guess we should have checked before going in!

Free desserts? Well, yes I'm there. Kyotofu was giving out free sampler dessert bags, as I discovered on a few blogs I follow. [dork] Having nothing better to do, I trekked up to 9th ave that day, and was smitten by this small, modern spot. As I was waiting to get my sampler (you didn't have to buy anything to try it), all the little desserts on displace were so cutesy. The lady in front of me and I started talking, and she swore the soy pumpkin soft serve was so good. Well, so I had to ask for a sample, and the sweet lady running the place obliged. Woo! Wow, for a non-dairy soft serve, it was so creamy and delicious. So, I had to get a bowl. $3.85 for a small + 1 topping... Matcha isn't a flavor I had tried before, but the matcha mochi was intriguing, so I went with it. (They also had fruit, granola, a few other options. More limited than your run of the mill Red Mango.) The matcha mochi was a bit herby on it's own, but with the pumpkin soft serve, it oddly worked. And the ice cream was delicious. The sampler was good too. Ooooh man the chocolately baby cupcake things? Yum! The pumpkin and chestnut cupcakes were yummy, and the little baby green tea cake/cookie was pretty good too. I'm not in that neighborhood often, but when I am, I'm sure I'll find my way back to Kyotofu.

Please do keep in mind that the 4 star is just for the dessert. For the food, it is about 2.5. The portions are way too small and I feel like they are trying to be too cute with food. But for desserts? Their dessert is certainly different from your normal fare but delicious just the same. I really like their desserts, especially the black sesame tofu and sweet potato cake. They also have a good selection of sake, for those who are alcoholly inclined. They offer the basic selection of coffees and teas as well as several Japanese drinks. The place looks really small if you look at the place from the outside (just a few bar stools and bar) but if you go in, there is another room that can sit a good number of people. I think I remember seeing about 5-6 tables on each side. Modern interior with bright lights.

I've been wanting to come here for the longest time but never got the chance to until most recently. C wanted to come here so we decided to trek up to the Hells Kitchen for some Japanese Brunch! C ordered the Egg Souffle with Bloody Mary and I got the Japanese French Toast with Bellini. The French Toast came out in the shape of a corn bread but it didn't taste anything as such. ?It was so moist and delicious. ?I decided to dip it in this coffee like substance and skipped on the maple syrup. C's Egg Souffle was good too and it came with a long flaky bread that was wrapped around a sausage. I like the decor of this place but this place is way too small to have a party larger than 10 people or more. P.S ?They give everyone a cherry blossom shaped cookie along with your bill.

If you have tried Chickalicious, skip this place. 2 of us had Kaiseki prix fix, sweet potato cake and the famous chocolate cupcake. Sweet tofu was very sweet, swimming in a pool of black candy (Japanese "Kuro Sato") syrup. The tofu though was of very high quality, but again you can buy it in any high end Japanese super market. chocolate brownie - good brownie, not as good as Fat Witch. Matcha green tea tofu cheesecake - other than the texture, I could not taste any cheesecake flavor... ?but I did enjoy the sesame mousse on top of the cake. soft ice cream - ?very sweet, nothing special, lack of flavor complexity. sweet potato cake - liked the icecream, cake was only a-ok, still a little too sweet for me, and definitely can use some more spices. Souffle Cupcake - Cupcake lovers be aware: it was baked in a paper cup, but it is not a CUPCAKE. ?It is a chocolate cake, texture similar to their brownie, just a bigger version with a crunchie top. No, still no frosting (which I was prepared for thanks to all you Yelpers! = ) ) ? A pot of black tea. Cost = approx $45.

Pretty Desserts, but I was Unimpressed. I've only been to Kyotofu for dessert, but didn't find it to-die for like many other Yelpers do. ?It's pricey, but not that great. I went with the Squab back in 2007 and had the black sesame sweet tofu and the strawberry anmitsu.

My friend and I each ordered the dessert sampler (Kaiseki prix fixe), which is not cheap but you do get a lot of food. It started with the signature sweet tofu. The syrup was delicious and not too sweet. This reminded me a bit of flan, except the taste was lighter because of the tofu. For the main taster we got matcha green tea creme brulee, miso chocolate cake, and dorayaki. The dorayaki was unimpressive, especially since you could buy that from some Japanese markets. Each of the dessert came with some creams on top, and the one with the dorayaki was nice, but I still would have preferred to sample something else. The miso chocolate cake I have had before, and true to its name it's a combination of the miso salty taste and sweet chocolate cake. It is weird to me still, but I do enjoy it. However, in the sampler it also had caremel and a piece of chewy cracker, and everything together was a bit too much. There were too many tastes and thus countered each other as opposed to coming together nicely. The matcha creme brulee was my favorite, simpler and well-done. After the main sampler we got these green tea fudge pieces, and we each had three. I liked them, although I could've just had one or two; three was a bit heavy. I had also ordered the iced matcha latte, which was flavorful and refreshing. Overall I enjoyed the desserts here.

This is one of the best dessert places in Hell's Kitchen. Whether you're in ?the mood for something sweet or a bottle of sake, you can find both here. Great date spot! Per the restaurant's namesake, the tofu desserts here are fantastic! The presentation is flawless and makes the desserts more appetizing. You can never underestimate the positive effects of great presentation. Besides the tofu desserts, ice cream, and mini cupcakes, Kyotofu also serves up some salty appetizers. My favorite is the pigs in a blanket. They're so juicy and delicious. The bun is soft, moist and savory. You cannot go wrong with this order!

I had heard of this place. I just didn't know where it was. I've walked past it many times but there is no sign! Maybe there is, but I have not seen it. Luckily one of my friends knew where it was and took us there for desert. We bought the cookies that come in 3 flavors: 1. matcha (green tea) 2. genmaicha (brown rice tea) 3. black sesame The cookies were delicious, not too sweet, its not like eating sugar. I would really lik to sit down there and eat one day so I'll be back!

Kyotofu was really really good. Came after watching the Book of Mormon with my boyfriend around 11 pm with no reservation and they were able to get us a table in the back after waiting for about 15 min. It's not worth going if u sit at the bar in the front because u get a cold draft that comes in every time the door opens and you get neglected by the servers. But yay! The back is really nice and cozy with comfy seats and nice lighting. We got the sake infused Mac and cheese (so great and not too cheesy with a crispy crust) and it comes with a great arugula salad with a delicious sesame dressing. We also got the trio of tofu dips which was good as well and not too salty. Onto dessert...they all sounded too delicious so we decided to go with the sampler which in the menu says is 3 treats, but in reality it was like 4 plus two on the house. ?Also, get a pot of the rooibos tea they have; it was a great accompaniment to the sweet, savory desserts. ?The sampler came with the signature sweet tofu, matcha green tea creme brulee, warm miso chocolate cake, and warm sweet potato cake. ?The best ones were the green tea creme And at the end they even gave us green tea chocolate and these great little chewy flower-shaped cookies that tasted like Korean rice balls! Delicious, pretty inventive food, great service, great ambience! Small space so come with a friend or a date!

My review is purely about the desserts. And with that said... I love coming here for dessert! Desserts made from tofu? Genius! I can imagine how some people might be turned off by it because tofu is mainly known for being in savory dishes, but sweet tofu is delightfully delicious. I also love the simple, modern decor of the restaurant, though it is a bit small. Some may view it as tiny, but I call it cozy. It's a wonderful place for a date. Or a mid-afternoon dessert stop. Or pretty much good for any thing anytime. It's a great place to stop by after a hearty meal and indulge in dessert without feeling like you're indulging. It's not overly sweet; it is just the right amount of sweetness to make you happy and smile. The tofu is smooth and wonderful and I swear, it gets progressively better as you continue to eat it. Maybe I'm exaggerating a bit, but I love the tofu desserts here. And I ain't afraid to declare my love!

Really charming place, and a great place to stop by after dinner! Kyotofu is small but if you have the option (and want to get close and personal with that special someone), shoot for a table in the back where it's far more intimate and cozy. We had two Calpico and sochu cocktails and also split their specialty, the black sesame tofu. The tofu had the perfect consistency and level of sweetness that I think makes it universally appealing to all palettes. For those who are wary of tofu, let alone tofu desserts, Kyotofu will be the place to change your mind. Lovely destination for dessert but maybe not so much for the $12 or so dollar cocktails. Fantastic plating, clean decor, sweet staff, and delicious desserts are a win in my book. As expected, it makes for a lovely date spot. I have tried their cupcakes, which some hail as the city's best, but are far too spongey for my taste. The flavor combinations are definitely unique, but I think Kyotofu is best when they stick to their tofu guns.

Very nice place in the ?midtown west. The decor is simplistic, modern, and white. The off-white couches in the back make the room very chic. My friend had a birthday party here and because the restaurant is rather small - they only seat 30, we took up half of the restaurant. They can customize the menu for you if you have large parties. However, if you opt for this, you will be held to your party number and even if someone drops, you will have to pay for the empty seat. Here we go: Appetizer: Kabocha pumpkin soup: standard pumpkin soup topped with seeds. Not too hot, so I was able to eat it right away. However, there was nothing spectacular about the soup. Second Course: Pig in Duvet - This was by far my favorite. They serve you four pigs in a blanket with mustard. The sausage is salty and perfectly seasoned. The duvet is flaky and crunchy with a hint of butter. The mustard is a house-made mustard with peppercorn and a little spice. Excellent. Third Course - (We were given a selection, where you have to select your option before hand). Chicken & Tofu Sliders - The meat was very light and paired with mint and one cucumber. The slider itself is very small, but don't worry, I was very very full by the end of dinner. You get three of these on a plate with a side of sweet potato chips. I was not blown away by this dish, but they get points for a healthy yet tasty entree. Desserts: Kyotofu Signature Sweet Tofu - I loved this! It was very light, not creamy at all, and was a perfect mixture of sweets. This is a great dessert for someone with a sweet tooth but who is also full! Warm Chocolate Cake - Very standard cupcake, I don't really like chocolate cake, so I can't comment on this. Green tea nama chocolate - I thought this was very original and it tastes exactly how it sounds. The cost: $45 per person * Any additional orders of food and drinks will be added to the bill. NY Sales tax 8.875% and Gratuity 20% for a large reservation will be added to the final bill. Expensive, but a good value.

Went with a friend in the evening hours...had the sampling desert which was a 3 course tasting for $17- reasonable not too pricey... 1. Miso chocolate molten cake with house special tofu and black sugar: ?The chocolate cake was pretty good, very moist and had a good chocolate tase (but nothing spectacular) the miso paste was ok too...the tofu was similar to chinese sweet tofu you can buy for $2 for a Quart in c-town! 2. Izuzu jelly and black sesame cheesecake : It sounded uber yummy but when we tried it, it wasn't sooo yummy!! in fact this was my least favorite item on my tasting! 3. House Sundae: 2 flavors of japanese icecream with mixed berry compote, this was prob my fav cuz the bland icecream allowed for the berries taste to really shine! All in all, It was not a bad experience and reasonable price but would I ask a friend to take me there again, probably not.....Sorry not a super fan of this place...it was just A- OK....

What the hell? ?Why is this place creating such buzz? ?Granted it's a cute tiny pace, but the food is just not that great. ?We've ordered the brown edamame, the appetizer sampler, the mini burger thing, the tofu salad, the sweet tofu, the strawberry dessert, and some drinks. The brown edamame is just regular edamame and nothing special about it. ?THe appetizer came with pickled veggies and chicken meatballs and tofu. ?The meatballs were tasty and the pickled veggies tasted like kimchi. ?The sweet tofu tastes like the tofu you get at the street carts in Chinatown. ?The strawberry dessert was a parfait of jellies, strawberry, liquor, and a sesame pancake that did not taste very good. ?The mini burger was really good and soo freakin cute. ?The rest ?I give an "Eh" Plus, I got a really bad stomache after eating there.

pics- http://www.yummycrave.co¡­ Two things: matcha green tea creme brulee and sweet tofu!!! I have to admit, I'm not a huge fan of tofu. I mean look at that miserable thing: soggy, pale, and tasteless, just blah. But when I heard there's a Japanese dessert bar in NY that infuse soybeans to your sweet treats, anything for my sweet tooth fix. We decided to get the prix fixe menu so we can get taste little bit of everything on the list. 1.signature sweet tofu. white sesame tuile, kuromitsu black sugar syrup, dried apricot. Officially my favorite tofu dish. the syrup aroma and taste were wonderfully rich and divine. the creamy gelatinous tofu was equally amazing. 2. matcha green tea creme brulee. lychee sorbet, vanilla bean tuile. a little cup of heaven. amazing texture and strong green tea flavor. too bad it's only sampler size :( 3. warm chocolate cake. good, nothing special. 4. warm sweet potato cake. hmm... my least favorite.

Kyotofu is more about the experience than the food. When you walk into the place, it looks more like a to-go sort of venue, but there are seats in the back. It's one room that has a row of cushioned benches (my sister said the cushioned backs looked like marshmallows), chairs and tables. We went for dessert and ordered a soy ice cream (green tea and chocolate) topped with squares of soft mochi. It came with a fruit compote (a tiny dish of tangy berries) and another tiny dish of what tasted/felt like whipped cream with a hint of chocolate. That cost $7, and was a good size for us to split.I'm not a big fan of green tea-flavored stuff, but if you are, you'd probably enjoy this. I'm much more of a tart-fruity-chocolatey type of person. Would I go again? Most likely not, but it's a cute place to check out, esp. if you want some different types of desserts.

Everything about this place is beautiful. ?This place may be for food and dessert, but it feels more like it is meant to be a night club/lounge. ?The big sofa like seats against the wall, wonderfully warm lighting and fun music selections were very fun to enjoy a new dessert in. ?The fact that at 11pm on a Friday we had to wait twenty minutes for our table is a testament to the popularity of this place. When I saw black sesame on the menu, I knew I had to have it. ?I had the black sesame sweet tofu and it was *beautifully* presented and tasted fantastic. ?It had a rich aroma and the sweetness was just right. ?The bottom of the black sesame had goji-berries which provided a pleasant surprise and pop to the dessert. My girlfriend had the sampler, which started with the signature sweet tofu that had a wonderful flan-like texture with a light sweetness. ?The follow up sampler had a sweet potato cheesecake that was fluffy and creamy all at the same time. ?The miso sweet chocolate cake tasted much like a delicious brownie, but the miso added an deep element that really makes your taste buds pause in a good way. ?The last sampler was the soy milk soft ice cream twist which was a refreshing way to end the meal. To wash the dessert down and cleanse my palette between dishes I drank the ginger tangerine sencha green tea, which was wonderfully fragrant and gentle on the taste buds. The service was excellent and friendly. ?The crowd inside was a young and friendly one that didn't mind the rather loud conversation that wound up coming from my table after I was sugared up!

This cafe/restaurant is very unique. The Japanese inspired desserts are all very beautiful and interesting. If you come in a group, be sure to get different types to try them all! I really enjoyed the Soymilk Soft Ice Cream Sundae (mixed berry compote, matcha mochi, japanese candies), Soymilk Ginger Okayu (pear ginger sorbet, spice tuile, cashew brittle), and Matcha Green Tea Tofu Cheesecake (black sesame shiro-an, yuzu caramel, pistachio tuile). Each dessert comes with an optional sake pairing, which I was not daring enough to try but was a very original concept for me. The desserts are seasonal, so be sure to come back! The biggest downside to Kyotofu is definitely the price. It's definitely an indulgence. I recommend coming for a nice occasion.

FOUR POINT FIVE We only came here for dessert, no meals. Sake and dessert-- delicious and a great plan. We ordered this sweet sake (we already had a sake bottle during dinner, so we've had a super sake night) Sake: Sweet, half off the price on SUNDAYS! Perfect because we were there on sunday! it was smooth and delicious. Sadly, I don't know the name of the place because I'm super girly and I let my man choose the bottles. Dessert: We had the Matcha Creme Brulee and the Signature Sweet Tofu Dessert. On the Matcha: i think its really creative and quite delicious. I'd say if you don't eat it right away and taste the mixing of the hot heated sugar crust and the cool matcha creme., then don't order! If you wait too long enjoying your conversation, date and sake, then the poor little dessert just turns into a yummy sugar meld. On the Signature Tofu: It tastes a lot like this dessert called doufuhua (tofu flower). its a small block of tofu that has been treated and yummified to become this soft sort of pudding/creme block. you add a sweet syrup and ta-da! But this dessert at kyotofu has a GREAT sesame flat cookie and a their own delicious syrup. I choose this dessert over the matcha one. the place is quite small, so i wouldnt bring a big group. Perhaps making a reservation ahead of time would be good too. We just showed up and had to wait a bit of time for a table-- say 25 minutes? Oh, and its so small-- not REALLY wheel chair accessible the meal was finished off with a macaroon for both me and the date. The macaroons were sweet, soft and yummy. Perhaps Hank C. just had a bad batch of macaroons? But mine rocked! good for me! I'd say go, but don't go too often. Watch that waist line!

4.5 stars After seeing the Lion King, we came here on a Thursday night for an after show treat. ? We ordered the appetizer sampler with: -pigs in a duvet: served with mustard. ?Yummy, like an upscale hot dog. - chicken tofu sliders: ?Tasty, wanted more. - smoked salmon onigiri: pretty standard, nothing too unusual - unagi phyllo: yummy, slightly greasy We also ordered the dessert kaiseki.. ?Even though it says 3 items on the menu, it came with 5 items! -Sweet tofu: This was a 5 star for me--it came with the most delicious brown rice syrup on top which totally made the dish for me. Still dreaming about this dessert... -chocolate miso cake: pretty good -coconut tapioca: interesting. I liked the toppings on top -sweet potato cheesecake: very good! light and tasted like cheesecake. ?I wasn't a fan of the hazelnut ice cream on top, as I felt that it overwhelmed the taste of the cheesecake -soy chocolate soft served yogurt: pass. tasted like TCBY yogurt. ?We didn't even finish it To finish, they gave us complimentary mini cupcakes! I also tried one of their mini matcha cupcakes that they sell by the cash register. Boy was it matcha-y. ?It was quite unusual, and I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think I'll be getting it again. ? *see pics*

One of the most posh place for Japanese desserts in the city! The entrance opens to the front of the bakery with counter/chairs facing the window. To the right is the kitchen where the chefs are preparing all the desserts/courses. And the lovely seating takes place in a gorgeous room. I declare Kyotofu to be my all time fave for their artisan desserts. My husband & I made a reservation for the Dessert Sampler for Two. We even took ?the staff's recommendation on the prix-fix dinner sampler. For the dinner sampler, we had the warm japanese mushrooom salad over baby arugula, red onions, and panteleo cheese. Very light and refreshing intro to the dinner. Next came the Bento box featuring-tskune chicken meatballs, pigs in a duvet in a puffy flaky pastry with kurobuta sausage & spicy mustard, ?BBQ unagi, eel tucked between layers of phyllo dough with sansho pepper & teriyaki sauce, and chicken and tofu slider with sweet potato chips. It was fantastic except the BBQ unagi requires a strong palette if you're not too keen on the odor. The Dessert Sampler for Two was presented with a shot glass of Hou Hou Shu, Okayama sweet, sparkling sake. It included the signature sweet tofu drenched in kuromitsu syrup and black sesame tuile. The tofu was served cold with the right amount of kuromitsu syrup and black sesame tuile in a shot glass. The dessert trio was raspberry tofu no bake cheesecake glazed in a raspberry sauce with cr¨¨me fra?che sorbet and almond florentine, matcha green tea cr¨¨me br?l¨¦e in seasonal sorbet and vanilla bean tuile, and warm Chocolate cake with passion fruit mochi. These are what real desserts are made of with delicious signature touches. Last but not least was the Nama chocolates or Matcha Green Tea Japanese Fudge served in origami inspired toothpicks. I think this was heavenly, not too much, not too light..it was just perfect! ? ? Our visit was concluded with Ginger Spice Almond Financiers to thank us for trying their dessert sampler. And more surprises, two freshly baked Chocolate ?Souffl¨¦ Cupcakes from the oven. Are they wonderful or what?? I have to credit Karina for setting up such a wonderful evening and reservation for us. ?Domo arigato Kyotofu!

So good! Normally, I hate tofu but my boyfriend convinced me to go for dessert here one night and it was amazing! We ordered the dessert sampler (three courses that included a chocolate cake, cheesecake, parfait and cookies) for $15 and I couldn't believe that it was all made of tofu. Bonus was a saw I celebrity there, but the fact that I ate tofu and wanted more was unbelievable. I can't wait to go back and buy the peanut butter and green tea cookies to go!

Wonderful variety of flavors and textures, all presented in an appealing way. Yes, the food portions are dainty, but if you order the prefix menu and a dessert, you will undoubtedly be full. Service is friendly, and not stiff or stuck up. They have a happy hour with half price cocktails!! Need I say more? I had the sakura prefix menu with the chicken/tofu slider, arancini, red snapper, and some other little goodies that I am forgetting. Each little bite had a unique flavor, all standing out bright and clear in my mouth. I finished with the dark chocolate miso souffle. It was absolutely amazing. I almost cried. Whoever thought to pair miso with dark chocolate is a genius. The nutty flavor paired with the sweet was perfect, and the rich texture was almost painfully good. An espresso was a perfect end to the meal, and came in a cute cup with two pieces of rock sugar with a nice, silky crema. The waitress brought us two little complimentary cakes with the check. They were made of dark chocolate, and were topped with cherry blossoms. The extreme saltiness and earthiness of the cherry blossoms paired with the dark chocolate created an interesting and delicious taste.

Dinner: 2 stars Dessert: 3 stars In theory, I have no reason to dislike Kyotofu. I love tofu. I love asian food, especially Japanese. And I would sell my first born for a perfect dessert. (Okay, slight exaggeration... maybe). However, Kyotofu just didn't make the cut for me. We started with the tofu dip, which was creative and fun. I like the wasabi and walnut dips. The warm mushroom and arugula salad had really excellent mushrooms, but I'm not a fan of the excessive parmesan. I had the green tea soba noodles and the boyfriend had the eel in phyllo. The soba was unimpressive with the exception of the "mushroom bacon." The unagi is a very dry and bony fish to begin with - adding a crust of crispy phyllo dough just makes it even drier. And since the only thing you get on that plate is unagi, it quickly becomes unappetizing. I was really looking forward to dessert - I've had financiers and fruity macarons that were fantastic here. The signature sweet tofu is a bit thicker than a traditional dou fu fa, with a creamy consistency like panna cotta. It was just a bit sweet and light and great on its own, but I found the syrup overwhelming. The soymilk soft ice cream sundae looked great, but had an odd aftertaste - I think the ice cream flavors were green tea and sesame, and they didn't mix well. I liked the mochi as a topping though. The meal finished with complementary green tea chocolate, which was creative, but too rich. Even the lavender tea I ordered couldn't wash it down. I left full, but definitely let down by the constant hype of the place. I'll stop in to pick up an ad hoc dessert, but for the most part, I probably wouldn't care enough to be back. DISCLAIMER: my friends organized a large party at Kyotofu and they asked us to set the menu several days ahead of time to accomodate us. It was super nice of them to do so and they were great about serving us, but you have to expect kinks when you have to serve large parties.

fits in the more of a "trendy place" category. ?the food is secondary. ?only thing I liked was the black sesame tofu (kuro goma sweet tofu with black sesame sweet tofu panna cotta, hoji-cha syrup, white sesame tuile). ?however it is best eaten plain since the hoji cha syrup doesn't add to it. tried the sampler to get an idea of the regular food and was disappointed. starter: warm japanese mushroom salad = ok, mushrooms sauteed nicely bento box: house made tofu, creamy croquette, pork belly, chicken & tofu slider slider not tasty, pork belly and tofu sauce too salty. ?sweet potato chips too salty also. tried one other dessert soymilk soft ice cream sundae with winter fruit compote, matcha mochi, and caramel, and the added sauce really tasted artificial and killed the dish. ?compote too syrupy. ?for me, this is a case of trying too hard.

My friend loves this place, so she brought me here --and I had a great time and definitely a great experience eating all these delicious desserts. ?Since they were on the pricier side, we had ordered 3 -- we had the matcha green tea creme brulee, signature sweet tofu, and warm miso chocolate cake which were all really delicious! ?My only complaint about the items were that they were small. ?But hey--it's New York! ?Portions are small, so it is to be expected. ?After finishing each dessert, we were left wanting to have more since the dishes were absolutely delicious. ?I really love creme brulee, and having green tea flavored creme brulee was an ingenious idea. ? There's often a wait, even late at night--so be prepared to wait. ?But, the worth is well worth it!

It truly pains me to give this place for stars because we had to wait so damn long for what was understaffed, either numerically or mentally, group of people to get my order taken, figure out their seating, and get me my bill. Seriously folks, you're clearly popular so hire a manager that can deal with the volume and get you folks churning out orders at a reasonable pace. That said my black sesame pudding thing was fantastic. I'm really big on black sesame. It's in a lot of chinese deserts and has this sort of grainy texture which sounds weird but I'm really in to. They manage to retain that yet make it creamy enough to resemble pudding. My friend's green tea creme brule was quite good as well but for something so green the flavor was decidedly muted. It's not cheap though, my dessert was 7 bucks and the tea was 4 bucks. 11 is sort of a lot to ask for after a dinner.

what's one more review to you, Kyotofu? Anyway, yes the dessert is amazing, but more importantly, the unpopulated, very tasty brunch. I came two days in a row for the black truffle egg toast and the complimentary bellini/mimosa/bloody mary. The toast is brioche, so great, flaky and drenched in yolk from the poached eggs. I only wish there were more truffles, or truffle oil. But we loved this because unfortunately, the truffled egg toast at Inoteca in LES let us down...and we were craving it!! Dessert, I loved the black sesame tofu pudding. YES!

I've enjoyed Kyotofu for brunch, lunch, and tea (and by lunch I mean tea and dessert), mainly with ladyfriends. ?While I'd be happy to go here for anything with anyone, this little shop definitely has some more appeal for the ladies than the gents. ?It is cuteness overload. ?The food even TASTES cute. Everything I've had here has been really good, although I'm going to have to endorse the miso chocolate cake in both its normal and baby forms over the advertised chocolate souffle cupcake that won city's best during the height of the new york cupcake craze. ?The miso chocolate cake might be one of the best chocolate-cakey-brownie-things I've ever had, especially with that green creamy stuff it gets served with. ?Rich, chocolatey, just sweet enough without being sugar overkill. I also love to get the "chocolate lovers assortment" (you get 4 different types of treats in a mixture of chocolate, green tea, and red been flavors, and at only $6 its enough to share with a friend, making it a really great deal). The savories are good, but it is true that they come in little portions looking small and adorable like everything else. ?However, I've found that despite the small appearance of the food, the content usually has enough solidity to make it just the right portion. I highly recommend Kyotofu if you've got a sweet tooth and have always longed to find a real dessert that would go well at the end of a sushi dinner.

Julie Woooohooooo... love it love it love it... ? I originally thought this place was like a pinkberry where i walk in to get some tofu based desserts. ?But heck.. it's a real restaurant and I finally got my ass to get there this weekend... ?There's a back room with tables but heck if it's ?meal for 2 or 3... sit up front and stare out the window for some people watch'in on 9th avenue.... Went for brunch and made it easy for myself. ?I had the Omakase brunch and the Omakase 5 pc dessert... no decisions, just let the chef do all the work. Brunch was $15 and came with a bellini or mimosa or bloody mary. ?Pretty decent deal... ?Here's what i can remember.. Long plate with numerous small plates. ? 1) Brown rice... stars not applicable... it's rice... nothing to note.. 2) Bunch of pickled radishes.. ?stars not applicable again... 3) Sausage that taste like a vienna sausage or almost like a hot dog... ?2 Stars.. wasn't crazy about it.. 4) Tofu with ???topping.. 3 Stars.. plain tasting but I liked it cause I do really enjoy tofu. 5) 4 meatballs with a peanut tasting sauce... not sure if this is meat or soy based but enjoyed it and give it 3 1/2 Stars... 6) ?3 eel wrapped in a flaky pastry almost like a spring roll... ? 5 Starssssss... ?delicious and highlight of the brunch. ? I have to say that I must've really enjoyed it all as all 6 plates were cleaned up... and still plenty of room for dessert omakase.. $17 bucks gets you 5 different items of the chefs choosing. ?I will try best to remember.. 1) ?Green tea creme brulee.. ?4 1/2 Stars... magnifico.. ?light and tasty 2) ?brownie or rich mini chocolate cupcake.. ?3 1/2 Stars. ?like a flourless chocolate cake with a nice rich taste... 3) ?2 pieces of green tea chocolate... i think that's what they were??? ?4 Stars... ?really really good.. A lil bitter taste like that of dark chocolate and how I really like chocolate to taste... 4) ?tofu dish with caramelized sauce... ?5 Stars... ?"wait for it"... Legendaryyyy ? Best part of the omakase... ?taste like flan and just as good as any of the best flan that i've ever had.... 5) ?2 mini pieces of macaroons... with a choco/rasberry like filing. ?For some reason the first piece was delish but the second piece, although the same.. wasn't as good anymore... ?maybe cause i had the tofu and creme brulee in between and they were sooo good. ?3 Stars. There was soooo much more I wanted to try like the flavor of day tofu ice cream or the black sesame tofu.... ? I will just have to come back... I will order a light meal and make sure I save room for dessert...

I love you. I miss you. I can't live without you. Summers in NY are so hot and humid, that all I can think about is eating desserts. Who doesn't like an ice cold sorbet or something for dinner after spending the day sweating like a pig? :D Kyotofu is perfect because it's light, tasty, and the flavors weren't overpowering. I just love that. On top of that, the presentation is nice. The prices were a bit high and portions were small, but this is NY after all. I say give it a try. My only complaint is that there wasn't enough tasty goodness as I wanted. Oh tofu.... love.

We brought 2 friends there tonight after dinner and ordered a shared dessert for 2 and a warm chocolate cake. ?They were phenomenal! The techno music was VERY LOUD; we could hardly hear each other nor have a conversation. ?We had to ask our (cute) Anime-like waiter to turn it down, and he happily obliged. ?Word of advice -- please don't make this part of your ambiance. ?I'm not sure if I could take much of it. ?You may lose one loyal customer.

Tiny place and hardly a visible sign outside. Sure glad my friends knew about this place. It's pretty pricey for dessert or I just don't eat out at dessert joints enough. Or maybe it was the bottle of Sake we ordered. Haha.. - Soymilk Ice Cream: You can get a mixture of Mochi and Chocolate ice cream. Comes with a side dish of raspberries and I think it's some sort of whip cream. The mochi alone tastes good. After a while, the chocolate just started to taste like an ice cream sandwich to me! - Sorbet: Came with 4 different flavors. Only one I really tried was the coconut which was delicious. A lot of flavor and you can taste the coconut shavings. NOTE: On the menu, it says 1 plate minimum per person but you don't really have to follow it. Just talk to your waitress. We shared a few plates. Good to check out but I'm not type that would go out of my way for dessert. I'd rather just grab dessert at a restaurant after dinner. Overall, pleasant experience.

Kyotofu, similar to Chikalicious, also has a blank white banner with no name no nothing on it. The inside decor is also pretty simple, though dark and lit with a candle like most restaurants. They have actual food but it is small portions and I have not actually tried it. I only tried their desserts. I ordered the trio sorbet and my friend got the black sesame sundae and it was FREAKING DELICIOUS. It's a little pricey but I would definitely go back again and I would love to try their actual food. Although, it's not big portions, I'm guessing from observing the other customer's tables. :)) TRY IT! I recommend.

I take it all back. Kyotofu, you rock! Perhaps I'm just a little high off that black sesame ice cream I just had! ?Topped with a Japanese black sugar whipped cream AND weird little matcha jelly things, it was definitely peculiar, but also addictive. I want another It's a lot tastier than it sounds, I promise. ?Go try it while the weather is still at prime ice-cream-consuming temperatures! ?That means right now! PS For the lactose-intolerant and soy aficionados among you, this ice cream is soy-based. ?For the soy-averse and indifferent among you, it won't taste funky at all, it's just really really good. ?The ice cream comes in chocolate flavor too, but it's more standard-tasting, not distinctive like the black sesame.

I'm a lucky guy to live above one of the greatest additions to Hell's Kitchen since I've lived here. ?First off, you can't miss the place with its striking white facade and podlike shape. ?The desserts (the menu changes seasonally) are to die for, yet don't leave you feeling bloated. ?My recommendations: anmitsu (the texture combination will leave your mouth confused, but happy), the tsukune sliders (little chicken/tofu patties on mini buns), and if you haven't had a cupcake from there, then you haven't had a cupcake. ? Now I am a bit bias, because it has turned into my expensive, cleaner version of Cheers, where everybody knows my name. ?Plus, I did create a drink which made it to the permanent menu (try the Kira Kira cocktail), but as a foody, I give you my word, you'll have an enjoyable experience. ?Unless you hate dessert. ?Then maybe its not for you. ?But the greatest thing is that they introduced me to the world of sake, and let me tell you - there's no turning back.

We ordered off the brunch menu, curry rice topped with egg and tofu and chicken burger. ?The food was quite tasty. ?It was very aesthetically pleasing and the portions weren't overwhelming. ?The tofu and chicken burger was the better of the two. ?It was very flavorful and moist. ?It had a Japanese flavored profile with the shiso leave and pickled cabbage. ?Also, you get a free cocktail when you order off the brunch menu, who can say no to that!!! Now the dessert....we ordered the chef's selection-3 samplers and WOW. The chef picked their signature tofu dessert, matcha creme brulee, and the chocolate cake. ?The tofu dessert was AMAZING! I've never had such creamy tofu dessert before, it could have been pass off as a dessert made with fatty cream!!

I just stopped by this place last night with a friend after a dinner at yet another japanese restaurant around the area. I've been on sort of a weird health food craze lately, so the whole concept of tofu-centric dessert place really appealed to me. I was pleasantly surprised by the chic yet comfortable atmosphere of the place (sort of a minimalism decorating theme yet lit softly which gave it a more homey feel) and set out for my favorite part of a meal, dessert. After much debate, we settled on the miso chocolate cake and the strawberry sweet tofu (we were informed they had just introduced this a week ago as a variation of their famous sweet tofu). first the miso chocolate cake - it was amazing. SO rich and chocolatey, and gooey and warm - just like a fancy, tiny version of a lava cake! and there was something gooey inside - we decided that was where the mochi was hidden. this was just fantastic, no other way to describe it. the sweet strawberry tofu came with some kind fo a strawberry sauce and 2 shortbread cookies. i was a bit thrown off by it - to me the sweet tofu sorta just tasted like a very bland flan, maybe it was the consistency of it. the shortbread cookies had an herbal infusion of some sort and i could not put my finger on it and honestly it really wasnt my cup of tea. it's a pretty pricey place for dessert (the chocolate cake was the size of a mini muffin, and cost $10) but i think you pay for the experience more than the food itself. tiny portions but beautifully presented with a very unique taste - i think i'll go back and try more stuff out from the menu. specifically the regular sweet tofu, and i'm dying to try the banana cake!

OMG OMG OMG - I AM IN LOVE! I figured I could run an extra mile at the gym the following morning, and decided to treat myself to dessert. BEST IDEA EVER! With an open mind, we ordered the kaiseki dessert tasting. The first course was a wonderfully surprising sweet tofu cup (my third favorite). The texture was light and velvety and fluffy with just the right degree of sweetness. The second course consisted of three delicious treats: a green tea/ginger/honey macaroon, chocolate cake with green tea cream (a close fourth), and another tangy berry tofu bite (second fav). The green tea macaroon just might be the BEST DESSERT I"VE EVER HAD (obv. the winner of the night). The explosion of flavor in that little cookie was unreal. I promise to be back to try the other two macaroon varieties... The final course was a chocolate and mint swirl soft serve. A refreshing cap to a wonderful experience. In addition to all the sweets, we ordered the modern sake flight. My fav of the three was the sparkling sake - though I admit I am a bit biased as I love bubbly. Plating like the decor was crisp and clean. I plan on hitting the gym hard this week so I can induge again soon!!

I had wanted to try Kyotofu for a long time. ?I find the concept of an Asian dessert and cocktail bar so unusual. ?I was not disappointed. ?The restaurant has a strange layout. ?You first walk into a tight space with a window-side counter and small corner table. ?Then you walk down a tight aisle between a small bar on your left and a small open kitchen on your right. ?You arrive in a round, futuristic white pod of a room with tables along the edges and an open center section. ?The service is friendly and the menu is innovative. ?Offerings include various Asian cocktails, mainly containing sake, a few wines, and unusual desserts. ? I was not in the drink mood (for once), so I will have to go back and try those another time. ?I did, however, try two of the desserts. ?First, the Black Sesame Tofu Pudding, which was a large cup of thick custard. ?It was purple with black flakes of sesame. ? It tasted very natural, kind of like sweet soy beans. ?I also tried the Hazelnut and Fig Warm Chocolate Cake. ?A large white square plate contained this extremely small piece of moist chocolate cake. ?The gooey chocolate center was amazing. ?The cake around it was perfect and not too dry, which often happens with this kind of cake. ?An oval of hazelnut, fig mousse added a unique flavor to the top of the cake mound. ?The plate was drizzled with raspberry and chocolate sauce to be wiped up by the rich cake. ?The dessert was amazing, but the fig taste in the mousse was a bit overpowering. ?More hazelnut would have helped. The dessert prices range from around $7-10, which is steep, but worth the occasional splurge.

After a great meal at Shimizu we walked a few blocks over to Kyotofu. ?Luckily, we were able to squeeze our group into a couple middle tables in the back room. ?We ordered several items to share: ?the black sesame sweet ?tofu, sweet potato tofu cheesecake, strawberry shortcake, rhubarb-strawberry cobbler, and warm miso chocolate cake. ?All were excellent! ?This the kind of place where you simply must try everything on the menu at least once. ?The group also sampled several cocktails and rounds of shochu (distilled spirits, not sake, which pretty much put the boys on their butts as the party night continued). Although we did not partake of the cupcakes and other baked goods, you can order these online at http://www.shopkyotofu.c¡­. ?If I can't get out to Manhattan again soon, I just might have to put in my order. ?The desserts won't come with the serene and elegant atmosphere of the back room, but I can imagine I'm there. ?Oh, and the servers were really nice, so if you can go there in person, you will enjoy it all the more.

Good, but not great. ?Very cute interior, beautifully presented desserts, but nothing hit it out of the park for me. I debated getting their signature sweet tofu dessert, but then realized it was very similar to the Chinese tofu dessert you can get at dim sum in Chinatown. ?We had the warm mochi chocolate cake with ice cream. ?Though nice, rich, and warm, it was essentially just a flourless chocolate cake with a tiny football-shaped scoop of ice cream on top. ?My passion fruit tofu cheesecake was more interesting - very light, slightly tart, and served with nice crunchy coconut crumbles and some tart sorbet. We ordered 3 of their signature chocolate souffle cupcakes to take home. ?They were cupcakes only in the sense that they were the same size. ?No icing, just chocolate cake. ?To be fair, it was pretty good chocolate cake, but I think calling it a cupcake is slightly misleading. ?You don't microwave a cupcake for 20 seconds before eating it, the same way you do Kyotofu's.

Green tea creme brulee. I love how they explain everything on my plate before I could take a bite out of it. I love that everything is intricately and purposefully placed where it's supposed to. I love the little mini brownies they give you with your check. Eat before you come here. You won't get full on this, and you're not supposed to. It's dessert!

I really don't see understand the hype over Kyotofu. I've given this place at least five chances over the past two years, and every time I've been less than dazzled. Let me start by saying I lived in Japan for three years, lived five blocks from the MOST AMAZING tofu dessert place on the planet. So maybe that's messed with my standards a bit, but personally I find Kyotofu's froyo to be way too milky and soft, with hardly any taste of tofu (yes, this is a negative in my book!), the toppings for the froyo are mediocre (canned fruit, anyone?), and while the famous chocolate cupcake is probably the best thing on the menu, I'd rather go to Sugar Sweet Sunshine and get two for the price of one. Cafe Zaiya's black sesame froyo is better. However, I do appreciate Kyotofu's autumn efforts to have pumpkin froyo and sweet potato pound cakes. If only they'd make those sweet potato apple pies...then I'd add a star.

sweet but not overly indulging on the sweetness! i love the sesame tofu... DELISH! it's usually my regular. the soymilk soft ice cream sundae is soooooooo good no matter how you top it - with brownie crumble, fruit compote or matcha jelly. perfect ending to a warm day! their matcha green tea financiers are amazing as well. take some to go ;) the flavors of their desserts are subtle & light but don't let that fool ya - every bite is like an explosion of deliciousness in your mouth. the staff is very friendly. it's a great place to go to after dinner or for a date. the wait can be a while, especially on a friday/weekend. there's not a lot of seating. but is it worth the wait? HELL YES.

Excuse my flamboyancy, but this place is SUPER CUTE. You should come here for if you're searching for a good dessert spot with a Japanese theme - I know, a niche. The sweet treats are to die and presented in minimalist Japanese fashion. The whole place has a quaint homely feel to it with moderate noise level and dim lighting, ideal for a date. I got the Strawberry Rhubarb Cobbler with some ice cream on top. The warm cobbler melted in my mouth. and was a perfect mixture with the breading and strawberry rhubarb. I've actually never had rhubarb before, but anything infused with strawberry is OK in my book. My friend got the soymilk soft ice cream sundae with green tea and matcha mochi and garnished with pocky - cant get more Asian than this. Both dishes were delicious and a good reprieve from a heavy dinner - although portions were nothing to scoff at. Net net, I would come here again and maybe even try pairing sake with the dessert dishes. The only problem I had was the cramped space. We literally had to move the table for people to come out of the booths because the tables were so cramped together.

Sake bar?! I'm there :) Fantastic feel created in quite a "cosy" dining space, though it works well when quizing the people on the table next to you about what they ordered... Really amazing when you consider that most of the deserts consist of tofu. Had the cheesecake which I found to be a little too rich (yet I somehow managed to eat it all...). Recommend the Prixe Fixe with sake to compliment. This desert sampler is probably the best and easiest way to navagate the menu on your 1st visit.

If you love tofu desserts, go here! You must try the 3 course prixe fixed dessert. They are mini tastings but you'd be surprised how full you can get. It's $15 pp. My prixe fixed came with the following: *I had the signature tofu with caramel sauce. - So smooth and creamy. Similar to panna cotta. Trio Plate *Raspberry tofu cheesecake *Vegan chocolate cake with tuile - A little too dense for me. * Matcha green tea brulee with bosenberry *3 Green tea chocolate on a stick *Madeline

Tiny white and cushiony box of a dessert bar. Maybe seven or eight tables all together, with bar seating up front. Nice selection of exotic and fancy sounding cocktails, sake, tea. ?My lovely jasmine pearl tea was served up in this super mod white ceramic pot and asymmetrical cup and saucer. Had the warm chestnut mochi chocolate cake, which was pretty good, but essentially chocolate cake. ?My friend had some japanese-style rice pudding, which was not bad, but essentially rice pudding (and a little milky/watery at that). ?Other friend got a dessert sampler which included sweet tofu, chocolate cake, sansho pepper cheesecake, and some cookies. Overall, everything in this place looks lovely, and the server was extra nice and helpful. Worth checking out if you don't have a huge wait. ?However, though there are some interesting and unconventional flavors, the food itself probably won't blow you away.

Kuotofu is an excellent addition to the designer desert bars for New York. ? A clean white contemporary bar which reminded me of Chickalicious until I found out later that the same interior designer did the work on both. I went with a group of four, which I recommend be the max for your party at this destination given the small size. ? It's a great after dinner destination for a dinner date that is continuing somewhere other than the bar/home, or I find a great option to go to after a cheap meal at home - but I still want to get out and enjoy the warming weather (we hope right) I personally love deserts and welcome the petite portions as long as they all are distinct and flavorful - which they were on both accounts. We had the Black Sesame Sweet Tofu, the Toasted Walnut Tahitian Vanilla Parfait, the Crystal Plum Sake Anmitsu (my personal selection), and the Warm Chestnut Mochi Chocolate Cake. ?All were excellent and I would say I preferred the Anmitsu the best, only because I had stuffed myself earlier at dinner and this was exactly the light post-gorging snack I wanted. The tea and sake selection was complementary and we all would recommend this to anyone to end or start their evenings... Last note: ?This is an adventurous place for those that might be looking for that after meal cakes and sweets spots. ?Go to try something new, or if you're craving a western spin on traditional Japaneses ingredients made for deserts. ?They did win best cupcake and although it's good, I still prefer a frosted cake anyday...

This place is GREAT! My sis and I were in NY for a couple days and I was looking for a neat place to eat on Yelp and I'm glad I picked this place. They had a Fashion Week menu, which had a few of their items as a course and also dessert. ?Everything I had was delicious and the presentation was also beautiful. ?The servers were also very nice! We told them we had to be leave by 7:30 and they obliged; at 7:25 our bellies were content and our check ?was on the table. The half price sake sunday was fantastic too ?:) For dessert I had the signature sweet tofu and my sis the black sesame sweet tofu, they were both great, but be warned: the black sesame one had a very strange consistency. ?We weren't bothered by it though, just amused. ?They were both delish. If I ever go back to NYC, I'll definately stop by here.

This place definitely scores high on the different-o-meter. I eat a lot of tofu, and I can't say I've ever tried anything like the desserts they have here. The decor is fun and the wait staff were super-friendly. There isn't much space in the front to hang out at while you're waiting for your table, but the people in charge were good about getting us drinks while we waited. P.S.

This place is a lot of fun! For a lot of money! (sorry I've forgotten the prices now) I tried a sake flight, which means they give you three different types of sake and it comes with an interesting description of each variety. GREAT if you love sake, and I definitely do. I tried their award-winning choc. souffle cupcake, which was yummy (though nothing to write home about really). It came with some little cookies that tasted to me like seaweed. The cupcake wasn't on the menu as a proper option, so I have no idea what these cookies actually were, but I almost spit out the bite I took. All in all a really fun place if you're up for something expensive, chic and experimental. Also fun if you're a sake enthusiast. The decor is futuristic but at the same time warm and welcoming. I look forward to trying something new next time!

I've been wanting to go here for ages and finally had my chance tonight. ?Bar seating is tight in the front but the back room provides some relief with a modest wait time around 10pm (groups of 4 had 15-20min). I've heard the food isn't that great so I bypassed and got straight to business with the desserts. ?Opening the drink guide and keeping it nearby to pick a proper pairing. ?The only problem is they have my favorite sake 'Kome Kome' which rendered the book useless to me. ($8/glass $40/bottle - but sakes are half price on sunday) We decided to try two of their signature cupcakes. ?The vanilla and chocolate. ?Simple by definition but elegant in construction (or deconstruction for that matter). ?Cupcakes ($8) are served with a light tofu cream and some homemade jam. ?I noticed in some other pictures that the cream may come on top or on the side. ?YMMV. ? Bottom line - Phenomenal - not really a fair comparison to other cupcakes as these are more like delicious souffles served in a cupcake wrapper. ?This is a great date place as well. ?The ambience is fantastic, open kitchen so you can watch things being constructed. ?And the presentation alone is a great topic of discussion. The only downside - I now want to move to hells kitchen because apparently they have free delivery. ?I'm excited about going back to try their brunch (which includes a free cocktail).

We wanted to get dessert after dinner, and Hot on Yelp led us to Kyotofu. ?It was OK. ?We were glad we tried it, but it's doubtful we'd go back. We decided to get the black sesame sweet tofu as well as the raspberry lychee anmitsu. ?The black sesame sweet tofu made the trip worth it for me, as I really liked it. ?I love black sesame Chinese desserts, so having this flavor in sweet tofu was awesome. ?It was more pudding-like in texture, as opposed to solid blocks, which is what we were expecting. ?Nonetheless, it was still good. ?Also, the consistency was a bit inconsistent (if that makes sense . . . some parts were runnier than others). The raspberry lychee anmitsu was kind of strange. ?It was agar jello squares and small mochi balls, and neither the raspberry nor lychee flavoring was particularly strong in the agar. ?Not that enjoyable. ?We'd actually wanted the strawberry rhubarb cobbler, but alas, they were out by the time we arrived. The check came with two small complimentary cupcakes, which were not very good. ?Much too dry. ? Our server also was new, because he didn't know too much about the desserts and another server had to explain to us what the anmitsu was. The decor inside is cute and intimate, though the space is really small. ?There's also a less formal cafe seating area in front. ?Some people were getting dinner food next to us, and I was curious about that food.

*sigh* New York why are you so expensive. ?In reality this would probably be 3.5 stars due to the prices, but I will let it slide. The douhua (tofu pudding) is good here, but what really makes it stand out is the kuromitsu syrup. ?It has a deeper flavor than your typical honey usually provided with douhua. ?It almost has a slight black sesame taste to it, but perhaps that was due to the thin black sesame cracker that was included. ?The strawberry anmitsu was so pretty looking when it came out. ?It was a nice semi-light dessert with the vanilla ice cream. ?Perhaps the vegan strawberry lychee sorbet would have been a better option, but there were already so many different ingredients in the dish, I wasn't sure about venturing out too much. ?The red bean and matcha shiratama (green tea mochi-like dough) made for an interesting but good combination. This place is open late, and doesn't get too packed. ?The ambiance is simple, modern, and dimly lit. ?Great for a late night dessert after a date.

This place has no sign. ?Now, unless it is a trendy little club or lounge, get a sign. ?I mean, i am no business major but i am pretty sure that will help for business. ?Just saying. The decor is kind of like a lounge. ?Once you enter, you can see through glass paneling actual little minions (chefs/pastry chefs) making some of the desserts. ? Opposite that, there is a bar area and in the back is where the rest of the seating can be found. ? We only got desserts and teas so my review may not be complete. ?I got the sweet tofu and my friends got the sesame tofu. ?Both which were pretty good. ?Reminiscent of dim sum sweet tofu (if you do not know what i am talking about...find someone who does and make them take you to eat it) but a little more firm. ?I liked my dessert more...there was a brown sugar sauce and a cookie like thing that went with it that complimented the tofu quite nicely. ?The sesame tofu had this really bitter and weird goji berry sauce...-_-. ?However, the plating of all the dishes was really nice and modern (which is what i think this place is going for...) My friend also got this green tea thing that was insanely bitter and not good but the cup was cute....granted, i am not a tea person so i could be totally off. The price was okay...8 bucks for tofu is not normal but the plating and seating, i guess, made up for it. ?Maybe our waiter, who had his shirt unbuttoned halfway with a silky tie and tight black pants, could use this money to buy a new outfit. ?just a tip.

List: ?Sweeties http://www.yelp.com/list¡­ Does the scene look familiar to anyone? The contemporary look of this Japanese dessert spot is from none other than Hiro Tsuruta, the very same interior designer for the ever so popular dessert bar, ChikaLicious. White walls, large, glass windows, and a very clean feel. Fusing Eastern and Western flavors, Chef Ritsuko Yamaguchi presents a delicate touch of artistic dessert excellence. Offering food for $10 and below and dessert items for as much as $17, this boutique cafe brings you the elegant feel of relaxation. Oh, and in case you didn't quite catch it, this place specializes in turning your dinner tofu into a sweet mix of flavors. The dessert chef prepares an array of artisan dessert as well as some more conventional items such as soft serves. A great spectrum of food items from burgers to classy dessert.

Decided to swing by and have dessert before going to the movies (since it was jan 1st and i didn't want to drink anymore). We were seated in the front counter space that over looks 9th ave and it was great to people watch and enjoy a good time. We all ordered different desserts. I ordered the soy cheesecake since it quickly caught my attention, a friend ordered the sweet potato loaf with the soy ice cream, and the 3rd was a combo of soy ice creams. ?When I first got the cheesecake it looked very unusual as it was green and square. Not what you would expect a cheesecake to look like. ?I was sold on the first bite, it was different yet familiar. It had the same consistency as a cheesecake but the taste was lighter. This was truly one of the most original desserts I have ever had. Next time I drop by I want to try the 3 course dessert prix fixe but I have to make sure to hit the gym hard that week.

Never let me down! Okay, the place was really tiny, but it was worth waiting. I love tofu and I think Kyotofu upgraded my taste for tofu. My advice is trying everything in tofu at Kyotofu! you won't be disappointed. Signature Sweet Tofu and Sesame Tofu were definitely the best. They were so silky and literally slided through my throat. You know sometimes you go back to a nice place to try something new but you can't forget the things you ate for the first time and turns out you order the same thing over and over again just because you figure that after you eat that dish, you will no longer crave for anything else?

hmm...japanese deserts. ?So tasty. ?If you like doufuhua (that sweet tofu dish you get during dim sum), then you'll like most of the desserts here. ?They are slightly less sweet than what you would normally get at most up-scale restaurants. We got the chef desert tasting menu, so it came with about 5 mini-sized desserts. ?The first one was a tofu dish, that came with a sweet sugary sauce. ?This was good, but alittle too sweet for my liking. The "main" course had 3 desserts: these little pancake things with raspberries and black berries, a chocolate souffle with a crunchy sesame crisp, and a green-tea creme brulee. ?The green-tea creme brulee was the winner. ?The custard wasn't ultra sweet, but came out with a strong green tea flavor. ?Very good. ?The burned sugar on top was very thin, so it just melted in your mouth when you ate it. There need to open up a branch of these restaurants in Ann Arbor, so I can enjoy this in business school...

Desserts are of course amazing; my group got the signature tofu, the chocolate cake and the donut holes. I didn't love the donut holes, but group thought they were fine. Only thing to say is I ordered DINNER here - which expectedly was a poor choice. I do **not** recommend the place for dinner - overpriced, small meals. I will say that the chicken tofu burger was delicious though - but just get the appetizer sliders! Pro: Almost no wait. My group of 4 arrived around 9:30 on Saturday and got seated within 10 minutes. Great for dates, nice dim lighting. Hilariously they played a really hip hop soundtrack - kanye, childish gambino, wiz khalifa - it was a touch loud for a date place, but everything else would be perfect for dates.

As a soymilk fans, I think this place is only okay.......not really special in deed. I got the tasting menu of dessert. For some items, I can't tell if they have used soymilk, such as the chocolate cookies. It is very small and pricey. I like chikalious better. It is a very pretty place. But the tables are just a little bit too close. Coz I went with my mom, and there was a couple sit right next to us. and our tables were so close.....it's just tooo awkward. I think it is quite decent to use soy milk as their theme for dessert... but i don't think they have come out a lot of variety out of the soymilk. As an asian, i am totally not surprised by their items at all. Furthermore, I wonder if they use Japanese Soy milk verses American Soy Milk. There is a very big difference. Soy milk in America in more thick, the taste of soy beans are very different from Japanese. Japanese is more light and refreshing, yet you can still taste the soy beans favor. i think this is a pretty good place for hot dates, like for after dinner or something. but you have to consider the fact that the people sat right next to you will over hear your conversation. seeing both chiefs making the dessert in front of you. i love ChikaLicious more personally. i just feel they put more effort in making the dessert. =D

Tofu and chicken burger is really good! ?I actually thought it would be a slice of tofu and a slice of chicken, but it turned out to be mixed together and formed into one moist patty. ?Cha soba noodles featured a very flavorful broth - only issue is that the noodles were overdone. ?Kuro goma sweet tofu with black sesame was also delicious. ?A bit expensive for the portion size, but worth trying.

I've had Kyotofu delivery several times, along with their tasty desserts and tea, but today was the first time I've finally made time to sit down and have a proper meal in the restaurant. It was dead empty 5 minutes after it opened, so my girlfriend and I got a seat in the back seating area quickly (there aren't too many tables, so I could imagine this being crowded on a weekend night). The lady serving us was polite, and the food came out pretty quickly (as one would expect in an empty shop). The menu is definitely one of Asian fusion, but not all of the dishes are patently a mixture. I got the almond brioche, which is not anything like French toast (so don't expect it to be, which is what I thought it was like). It's literally 2 thick slices of toasted brioche bread loaded with almonds, served with a fruit topping and sweet syrup/cream on the side. It's really good, although I think I'd like it a little more if the brioche wasn't as crunchy as a result of being toasted. It's still very good, though, and the applewood bacon is very well flavored - just slightly on the crunchy side, but very good texture overall. My girlfriend had the curry, which is just freakin' solid. It's a little spicy, which adds a nice little kick to the dish. If you do wish, the sausage addition for $1 is very tasty and adds additional savory goodness to the dish. We got the house version of pigs in a blanket for the appetizer, which was delicious, particularly when paired with the mustard sauce on the side that gave it a spicy twist. We didn't have dessert or tea this time, but if you're only dropping by, make sure to try out the miso brownies (these are freakin' addictive) or any of the other sweets as well. Their tea is also delicious; I've had the buckwheat tea, which has a very deep, wholesome flavor that you're not going to find many other places. It's a real treat of a place in Hell's Kitchen that won't break your wallet but has some of the tastiest stuff around.

I've heard good things. So I stopped in late on a Sunday night at 11p. Turns out that they're open until 12:30a or 1a+ during busy days! 50% off sake late-nights on Sunday, apparently. They have macaroons now. Apparently they didn't earlier last year. A little dry. Signature sweet tofu dessert -- much like a sweeter version of dofufa that you can get in Chinatown. Comes with a brown sugar caramel. The amitofu (raspberry & lychee agar w/ small mochi balls) was more delicious. Great textures (small squares of agar with chewy balls), and not quite as cool as I'd expect. They topped off with four small green tea muffins. Dry, though... Will have to try more later when I don't drive.

A chic little place, with a huge TOFULICIOUS experience. Great for chicks! very girly and purty desserts. If you've never had or thought about Tofu as dessert, give it a try, everything is so yummy and delicately put, you won't even know it's tofu. Grab some girlfriends, grab a light bite, get some girly drinks and sweeten the chit chat with delicious tofu desserts! For more reviews visit my blog.

I've been to this place twice for dessert and each time I found their creme brulee and milk tofu pretty decent but not as good as Cha An near St. Marks'. ?Their frozen yogurt is also just okay. ?It has an interesting aftertaste. ?However, my friend loves their brownies (moist and rich) and they always give you a small dessert with the check! ?This place is worth going to for dessert take out such as getting a small gift box of chocolates. ? I've had their dinner items as well--their mac and cheese is nothing amazing. ?It's just mac and cheese with some stuff sprinkled in there. ?Bacon (i think) is an additional cost :( ? The ultimate downfall is their brunch. ?Do nooot go here for brunch. ?They serve pigs in a blanket for one of their brunch items...literally looks like canned dogs in a pastry. ?The dish only comes with 5 small ones! ?I ordered brioche french toast and man oh man...it tastes like old stale bread. ?I was so disappointed and hungry after my meal that I went to Sullivan Street Bakery and got two slices of pizza! Sigh.

I am in LOVE with this place. My first experience was pretty good, but my second has sealed the deal. I had the dessert sampler and it was great. Our first course was a sparkling sake that was so sweet it tasted like candy...needless to say, I was already in love. Next up was the tofu with a black sesame sauce which soft with the right amount of sweetness. Next came a trio of small cakes: a chocolate souffle cupcake, green tea creme brulee and another cake that I'm not sure what it was. They were all oustanding, but I loved the creme brulee the best. I'm a huge green tea fan and they got the flavor here right. Everything is bursting with green tea flavor. Last came matcha chocolate. It was so flavorful but very sweet. They gave three pieces, but two would have been just fine. If they tone down the sweetness, then three would be good. The do not rush you out at all and only bring the bill when you ask for it. The presentation of all the desserts was outstanding, just like the taste of each and every dish. Upon receiving our bill, we got chestnut macaroons which were delicious and we got two chocolate souffle cupcakes to go. It was a great experience and I can't wait to come again. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a date place. However, since the place is so tiny, you might want to make reservations.

Went for a girlfriend's birthday gathering.. Cute place with a modern interior-- and i love how it smells like chocolate when they're not cooking food. They get an A+ for presentation. Everything came out looking really appetizing and super cute. ?My friend and I ordered the 5 pc chef sampler to share and was sorely disappointed with the size (we expected more since it was the most expensive thing on the dessert menu)... but this was my fault for not asking. B for food. The mac and cheese looked wonderful but the curry was like the one I made for church friends the night before from a package. (My curry was darn good-- my friends will vouch for me!) A- for the drink I had-- a Harajuku martini? Very dry, not sweet at all (I expected it to be sweet since it was a cocktail but that was my fault for not asking). Should have ordered the orange drink instead... that looked super yummy. I also give an asterisk to the mimosa/bellini that comes with brunch. Conclusion? I think I would be willing to give them another chance now that I am better informed.

I let my friend know that this restaurant uses soy in just about everything and she told me she HATED soy ..... well, at the end of the meal, her opinion of soy totally changed, so that's saying something! :] soy is virtually tasteless but when used in desserts, it makes the final product very light. So you won't have a giant food coma after you indulge at Kyotofu ;] We shared the sake infused mac n cheese and opted to add pancetta for $2. They did not skimp on the pancetta! There was enough pancetta for every bite of the dish. The top of the mac and cheese had a great crunch and the cheese was not heavy. It was accompanied by a side salad with a yummy seaweed dressing. For dessert, we had the omakase and the sorbet trio. The omakase included the green tea creme brulee, signature soft tofu and warm miso chocolate cake. Everything was excellent; delicate and light yet you could still appreciate the green tea flavor, the chocolate flavor, and the fruitiness of the sorbets. Do order the dessert omakase bc it's a much better deal than ordering a la carte! Only downside to this place is that it's small (probably seats no more than 20-30) so if you come for Friday night or Saturday dinner, be prepared to wait.

Okay, so based on their website, I thought this place would be a Japanese Dunkin Donuts. ?Maybe I'm on crack but if you go on their site you see a pink donut box and I don't know about you but a box of munchkins always gets me to drink the kool-aid. Nevertheless I stumbled in one night expecting to be bombarded by mochi donuts and instead found myself fancily seated in a fancily white clad eatery. I was a bit disappointed with the small offerings of the dessert menu but we ordered: black sesame sweet tofu, signature sweet tofu, and soy-milk ice cream. Signature sweet tofu ?= dainty and creamy Black Sesame sweet tofu = overpowering sesame taste, not as creamy Overall, I guess this place is okay, though I'm disappointed to see it in Hell's Kitchen...I feel this place belongs in Nolita. D'oh.

The decor - unpretentious and inviting. ?The food - surprising and fun. ?The service... ?hm... ?Well I'll just say this, when ordering food you might ask the waitress to recommend a sake. ?She will recommend a bottle and bring it over the the table. The sake tastes delicious, slightly fruity but very clean. ?Then at the end of your meal you might get a bill where you'll see that the recommended bottle of sake is $84. ?Ouch. ? I realize its my own mistake for not checking the price before ordering, but a little warning might have been helpful. I think I will still go back to Kyotofu since the food was so original and impressive. ?But I will be much more careful when placing my order.

Heard about this place from some of our friends and decided we just had to check it out. ?There were too many delicious-sounding desserts on the menu to choose from so my boyfriend and I ended up sharing the 3 course, 5 dessert prix fixe for $17. ?Awesome choice! 1st course - black sesame sweet tofu. ?I am TOTALLY IN LOVE with this dish! ?I've had sweet tofu before but somehow Kyotofu makes it so unbelievably good. ?It's almost like a japanese flan or custard with a sweet sauce (for those of you who are balking at the thought of sweet tofu). 2nd course - green tea creme brulee, chestnut cake and chocolate cake. ?LOVED the green tea creme brulee and chestnut cake. ?Chocolate cake was ehhh....nothing special and I've had better at other places. 3rd course - green tea chocolate squares. ?Unusual combination of flavors. ?I can't tell whether or not I liked it. ?When I didn't know what it was I thought it was weird and didn't care for it. ?But once I was able to identify the flavors it was pretty good. All in all, I thought the experience at Kyotofu was an excellent one. ?Great ambiance, open late night, good variety of desserts. ?A little pricey but decent enough to give it a try at least once. ?Next time, I am going to order only the black sesame sweet tofu all for myself!

Eating the savory food here was a mistake. It had all the ingredients for good food: Fresh produce, good execution, decent imagination - but where was all the flavor? The biggest culprit of the night was the "house cured market fish nigiri / espelette pepper oil, citrus-dill rice". It tasted like fish on brown rice, regardless of the reddish oil that it sat on. Citrus-dill rice? What? No-taste rice, I say. And lima beans? Just there for color, it seemed. It seems dumb to serve food at a place that specializes in desserts - or was I dumb to eat food at a place that specializes in desserts? Summary: Avoid the food here. The desserts are pretty good, but nothing mind-blowing or worthy of 5 stars. I recently had the black sesame chocolate frozen mousse from Zenkichi and sake-infused panna cotta at Bohemian and those were much more memorable than this place.

Kyotofu is definitely more about the ambience/atmosphere/experience than the actual desserts. Some of the combinations of flavors are interesting - hit or miss, really. The portions are small, the seating area looks cool but is kind of trendy, and it's pretty $$ for things like ice cream and tofu. It's a fun place to take people, but it's not somewhere I'd ever get a craving for.

Meal: brunch and dessert Food quality: hit or miss - I finished my plate but we spent most of the meal hesitantly diagnosing the ingredients of my friend's dessert Decor: minimalist Service: BAD The truth is - with so many great places in NYC - I cannot help but be a stickler for service. In a virtually empty restaurant, some mistakes are unforgivable: 1) waited for 30 minutes for the waitress to even take our order 2) the all important hang over cure water was not refilled 3) food arrived at different times (5 minutes apart) 4) waited for 20 minutes to get the waitress' attention to ask for the bill Do not venture into Hells Kitchen just for soy, sake, and chocolate cake. I have a few east village places I could recommend.

I'll first state the drawback - the prices are steep for the "portion size" if you are a budget eater... But, the atmosphere is fun and chic. High ceilings, shiny seats, sexy decor, and electronic beats. Desserts and cocktails are more unique than the food, but I liked my chicken sliders. Desserts of choice: Black Sesame Cheesecake Signature

I really don't want to hate on this place, but i must. I will probably give it a second try but i am not sure. I live just next door and have stared at this place for the last two years and somehow just managed to make it in. My friend was looking for a frozen yogurt place but i suggested we try Kyotofu as they're known for their desserts. She picked a soy milk sorbet and i led with the suggestion of the server for the green tea creme brulee. Neither of us liked our picks. Hers was overly salty in taste and mine overly buttery. I don't recall even getting a hiff of the green tea. I also ordered a drink considering the happy hour special. After about 15 minutes i had figured they had forgotten about the drink. However, he did manage to bring it over and i just had him send it back. It was only us in the restaurant and an empty back area..maybe one table sat. I will be nice and say two. In any regards they looked to be fully staffed and no excuse why it should take 15 minutes or more for a cocktail. Maybe the ingredients were made and mixed fresh..not sure... The place is however very cute and fits into the neighborhood very well. Also, everyone i encountered were very friendly as well.

Wow awesome! Friend had the black sesame tofu dessert which wasn't too sweet, but incase you wanted it sweeter you could drizzle agave nectar over it. Then I ordered the green tea creme brulee as recommended by other yelpers and it was great! The sorbet that it came with was refreshing and great! What I love even more is that you get another treat when you receive your receipt. A tiny muffin with 1 lemon zest in it and it tasted great. ? This place is great but tiny. I feel like the later it gets the busier it gets so if you're heading over there for dessert you might want to have an earlier dinner

"C'mon. Let's go for dessert @Kyotofu. It's healthy and good." "You had me at dessert. But healthy dessert?! Wah?? Let's go!" Walking into Kyotofu makes you think it's a tiny, tiny joint. but upon being seated you then realize that there's a decent amount of seats and lots of people enjoying their desserts around 10pm. Surely that's about a good of a sign one, somewhat skeptical diner could ask for. Not particularly sure what to expect when one says "tofu for dessert" I was thinking almond jelly which probably wasn't too far off as far as consistency and taste goes. But, they offer much more than just that with various varieties of flavored tofu and sauces to top it off. I went w/the original, signature while my friend went w/the black sesame tofu. The presentation was pretty nice and original to me. I like how things were separated to let us pour the sakura sauce and crispy sugar (I think?), which gave a nice crunch to the super smooth tofu, at our own pace. off-hand tip: I saw a Kyotofu box at Dean & Deluca. Possible yummies w/o having to go here?

Oh Kyotofu, why do you try so hard not to stand out? This restaurant (dessert bar) would be easily missed if you ever pass by unless you know that you are going there. One reason could be due to the lackluster outer appearance. It doesn't exactly stand out and scream come in. But, do not judge a book by its cover because believe me, the desserts served here are simply delightful. Overall the prices are definitely towards the pricey side, however I don't mind because desserts are my weakness. I tried the Matcha Green Tea Cr¨¨me Br?l¨¦e ($9) which is served with seasonal sorbet (strawberry sorbet for me!) and vanilla bean tuile. It was amazing. I love, love, love Cr¨¨me Br?l¨¦e so incorporating matcha with it is definitely a win for me. The top was crispy, crunchy,and sweet. Underneath this layer, it is soft, smooth, and oh so creamy. My friends and I tried the Signature Sweet Tofu (served with sakura syrup and black sesame tuile). The tofu was so smooth and it tasted good with the syrup. My friend ordered the Sake-Infused Mac & Cheese. It also came with a side salad. It was deeeeelicious. We also ordered the Trio of Sorbets (made in-house daily with fresh fruit and seasonal ingredients). The sorbets consist of mango, raspberry with black pepper, and green apple. My favorite out of the 3 was mango. The raspberry with black pepper was definitely whimiscal and out of the ordinary. I actually liked it, my friends not so much on the same boat. The green apple tastes just like a green apple jolly rancher. At the end the meal, we were given matcha financiers which were so gooooddd.

So I planned my 28th birthday celebration here. I was given a prix fixe dessert menu and champagne/sparkling sake for a pretty reasonable price. I initially made the reservation for 10 people, only 6 showed up. I let the restaurant use the additional tables for guests, but they still charged me for the 4 additional people. They were very rude about it and pretty much RUINED my birthday. I will never RETURN. I hate bad customer service. I don't know if if had anything to do with the fact that me and my guests were black! But it was the worst!!

Try the black sesame tofu and you won't regret. Anything green tea taste soooo authentic, you can feel that they use a real green tea, not just using a flavor. However, the chocolate mochi cake was not like what I expected. I adore the pretty lil decor with the invisible kitchen up front where you can see the chef works effectively - fast but still maintain the quality (or I can say : the cuteness!)

yummm. : ) I ordered the soymilk soft ice cream sundae ($7) which came with a mixed berry compote (which I didn't touch, but that's because I'm not a berry person), pocky sticks, and topped with matcha mochi... so like a green tea type mochi. I have to admit I'm not a mochi person either... like I think it's ok but I don't particularly love it. HOWEVER, the matcha mochi + the soymilk soft ice cream ... LOVE IT. It was so light and delicious! I can definitely go for some right now. My friend ordered the Chocolate Souffl¨¦ Cupcake which came with berry compote and a tiny cup of the soymilk soft ice cream (I THINK). I took a bite of the cupcake and the top was crunchy and the inside was so soft. I was glad that I saw the pictures here because the store front did not have their name on it. Once you step in you see their open kitchen and when you walk further down there are tables all long the side that I actually imagined to bigger. I got seated towards the back near the bathroom and... if you come here, don't sit in that area because if someone was in the bathroom you might smell... them. I almost forgot to mention... at the end of the night they gave us a plate of complimentary mini cupcakes... which was not so great. I did not enjoy those. I've heard great things about their cupcakes so I was very excited to try these but was disappointed after taking a bite. ?ASIDE from the bathroom smell and the mini cupcakes, I really enjoyed my soymilk soft ice cream with matcha mochi!

The most unusual and delicious desserts I have ever tried. They were also the prettiest desserts I have ever had. I felt like I was at a five star restaurant, paying twenty dollars for dessert. But I wasn't! It doesn't mean that the desserts here were cheap either. I believe the most expensive was 10 dollars, unless you want the combo which is 17 dollars. Me and my friends got 4 different desserts and we ended up paying 13-14 each after tax and tip. I think it was worth it. I tried four different things and there was good to absolutely delicious. The place is out of the ordinary. Kind of close to Time Square, but not really. All the way on 9th avenue it's a pain to walk there especially at night. The streets are deserted and it's a bit sketchy. And when you finally reach the place you don't even know it's Kyotofu until you walk up to the blank store and see the tiny menu by the entrance. It was odd, but it was worth the walk and hunt. When I got inside, it was tiny! I thought it was a full on restaurant, but it's not. They do serve dinner and lunch, but I wonder how because it's so small. They have a tiny back room where the tables are. Not hard at all to find friends that already grabbed a table. They do have wait service and a togo counter. The guy was pretty cute as well. The menu was fairly large and the desserts were paired with many different types of sake. Let's just say their beverage menu was a lot larger than the dessert menu. My friends got a pomegranate mojito and a bellini. The mojito was delicious and I usually don't like mojitos because I hate mint. The bellini was okay. 11 dollars and 10 dollars for the cocktails. Then we went on to order the desserts. Yum! Miso chocolate cake, sweet potato cake, soft serve and machi green tea creme brulee. They all ranged from 7-10 dollars each. They came out all on separate plates and they were beautifully crafted. They tasted as good as they looked. Well most of them anyway. I wouldn't order the soft serve. It tasted odd, I couldn't tell what flavor it was. Kind of coffee-ish, mocha-ish, chocolate-sih. I don't know... The creme brulee was okay as well. Maybe I just don't like creme brulee. Ha. My favorites were the sweet potato cake and miso chocolate cake. The miso chocolate cake was SO GOOD. There was a hint of miso flavor and the cake was gooey and dense. I loved it. It had a dab of this odd red bean paste. I didn't like that. The sweet potato cake was my second favorite. It can with a small scoop of ice cream that went very well with the cake. The sweet potato cake looked like a donut. It had the hint of sweet potato as well as a pumpkin flavor, maybe that was just what I tasted. Ha. It was a success! I was happy that I was able to try four different kinds of dessert. I would definitely go back to order that miso chocolate cake. It was so good! The portions are fairly small, but good enough as individual portions. If you're in a group, it's always fun just to share and try them all. I have never tried the food. Just came here for the dessert, that is what they are known for. They are open pretty late. Me and friends went around 12am and the wait was minimal. I'm thinking that it could get pretty crowded especially because it's a bar as well. Highly recommended if you're taking at touristy trip to Time Square. It's worth the walk over to 9th avenue. It's basically more for the experience at dining at such a cute place. I would say that the dessert it well worth the money, but to some they might think it's overpriced. It's New York! What do you expect! It's not a must try, but it is recommend. I like this place a lot.

The store looked cute and came high recommended. However, considering we came here specifically for dessert and only stayed for a short time, the experience was very flawed: - it was a warm night and the small restaurant, like many places in NYC, does not have good circulation of air. The air conditioner was on, but seemed to be only blowing air at room temperature. - the waitress sat us down and forgot about us. Two separate tables that seated after us got service before we did. Eventually, we had to flag her down for water and utensils. - we had the matcha green tea cr¨¨me br?l¨¦e. The presentation was delicate and the flavor was unique. My favorite part of eating creme brulee is breaking its hardened outer shell and feeling the textural contrast of the shell and the inner filling. However, this creme brulee was undercooked, there wasn't much to break, there wasn't much to contrast.

Unless you are starving and craving for a meal of epic proportions, you can't go wrong with this place. ?The plates are small but the food is exquisite. ?The desserts can be meals on their own. ?My favorites are the chicken meatballs and chicken and tofu burger/sliders, which are tender and flavorful. ?My friends have really liked the mac&cheese (truffles!) and "pigs in a duvet". ?For dessert, I would recommend the black sesame black tofu rather than the signature sweet tofu, so long as you are not allergic to sesame. ?The matcha green tea ice cream sundae is also very good. ?The brownies are divine - some of the best out there. ?For those just passing by, Kyotofu has soymilk ice cream available for takeout. On the downside, the place is small, so without a reservation, the wait can be frustrating. ?Also, the sign is quite inconspicuous, so be on the look out - I still overshoot sometimes when I go.

Kyotofu's Black Sesame Sweet Tofu Panna Cotta has turned me into a Japanese dessert sociopath. While I've always been able to share dessert with dining companions, this is one dessert where I must stake my territory. Any threat of invasion of someone else's fork, and I'll retreat with my tofu, reexamine my surroundings, and discharge to another table.

This is my other dessert bar addiction.. Last year, perhaps because I was with my then-bf, or perhaps simply due to circumstantial events that had me going to Hell's kitchen a lot, I must have gone to Kyotofu half a dozen times in the summer alone. The soy ice cream soft serve alone made me go back a few times! And the varying sweet creations are all delicious. But you have to experience the dessert kaiseki. Like Spot this place puts desserts at center stage and with the kaiseki you can try 4-5 different things at once. The sweet tofu is reminiscent of this Filipino treat I love, the cakes are light and tasty, and the matcha and chocolate confections are delectable. They also have a great sake selection and it's half-price sake on Sundays. Ask them for recommendations or if you're like me, you'll be very happy with their lychee saketini. They actually do serve food other than sweets but I've only come here for dessert and drinks. Even so, the savory dishes I've seen come out of their kitchen all look appetizing. This place is great for a date or even for girls night catch up.

If I had my way (and an unlimited quantity of money), I would spend every evening at Kyotofu. ?Really tasty (and unexpected) desserts, like the Tofu Pepper Cheesecake, and a fun selection of sake by the glass. ?Kyotofu is the first place I tasted sparkling sake, which is just a great idea. ?The space is small and fills up quickly, but it's a great cozy place to go early on a weeknight. ? Bonus: ?Kyotofu makes great dense chocolatey cupcakes (that somehow have soy in them, so they must be good for you), which they also sell at cafes around the city (like Cafe Grumpy in Chelsea). ?But sometimes you can see the Kyotofu folks baking the cupcakes in the evening and can convince them to give you one fresh from the oven. ?They taste like winning.

My husband and I ate a sublime meal tonight at Kyotofu. We sampled three small plates - chamame, inari tofu (absolute favorite), and warm simmered tofu. I agree the menu can feel a bit pricey, but the emphasis is on craft and ingredients are really high quality; the taste, clean and pure; and the tofu texture, smooth and creamy. My husband also said the shoshu drinks were very good. For dessert, the black sesame tofu has been recommended by some reviewers, so I tried that--it was good, but not as phenomenal as the tofu cheesecake or the chocolate souffle cupcake. Of course, we had to take a sampler of different cookies to-go, which are light and delicate. Oh, Kyotofu is just wonderful. P.S. Be careful if you are vegetarian. Just because the dish has tofu in the name doesn't mean that it doesn't come with a meat side dish or have meat products mixed in. Do ask the server.

The pictures of their desserts looked so pretty and yummy that I had to come here. I was so disappointed that I could not try the green tea creme brulee. It was what I came here for, but I guess the ONLY way to get it was you had to order the fixed three course dessert tasting. I did not have the the time or the money at the moment to get it. I got the black sesame tofu panna cotta. My friend thought it was disgusting, but I thought it was pretty tasty. Very light and not overly sweet. It had a deep sweet sesame tasted which I can tell is difficult to make. It's not for everyone I guess, but I thought it was something different and special. I must come back one day and try that three course dessert tasting. I will get that creme brulee... I must!!!

Was craving for dessert after dinner & decided to yelp what was around. Kyotofu came up and it one of the favorites was black sesame tofu. Interesting. So went over and the place had a nice environment but was confused whether or not we needed to write our names down or someone would ask us. All the waiters were busy until after 5 minutes I walked up to one and asked how long the wait would be. There were 4 groups of 2 ahead of us. We waited for 30 minutes not too bad for the size of the place. I like how the kitchen was open so when you walk in the chef was in front of you preparing the dessert. I gotta say, lots of chocolate cake + lots of black sesame tofu lovers. Its a nice environment. Im starting to fall in love with dessert lounge. Enough of the chinese dessert places, finally some high end kind of dessert without having to try it at a restaurant. They even have a bakery to go. Very tempting to buy after a great meal. I ended up getting the chocolate cake w/ miso sauce. The cake was a soft texture but in my opinion not warm enough. The miso sauce was a bit of a weird combination with the cake. It was a little too sweet for me but for some reason I kept eating it with the cake maybe because without the sauce the cake would be too dry. I also got to try the black sesame tofu. Very good portion. When I saw it, didn't think it was much since its less then half full inside a cup but after digging into it, there was actually enough. Very strong black sesame smell & taste which is how i like it. I also wanted to try the green tea creme brulee which seemed like many surround-ers enjoyed. Next time.

3 STARS for the google offer deal dessert menu, you aren't able to choose anything and they apparently ran out of a lot of items 1st course: glass of sparkling sake 2nd course: brownie, green tea cremebrulee and a yuzu cheesecake (not a fan of yuzu) 3rd course: 1 chocolate chip cookie with the brownie again! they said the 1st was miso and 2nd brownie was cherry blossom but they both had a flower petal so pretty sure it was the same, if not they tasted the same but 4.5 STARS for dinner!! I was impressed withtheir pork belly and the mac & cheese with panchetta (extra $2) The room in back is much nicer to dine, with white seats and dim lighting. Perfect for a date, the front is more of a stop & go.

My boyfriend bought a gilt city deal at Kyotofu. It was a dessert deal for a party of 2. First of all, it was hard to get reservations at a decent time. The only time we managed to get on a Friday night was 11pm. When we went in, it was very packed so definitely make reservations. They don't give you big portions but just enough to have a few bites of each! The deal came with: - Sparkling sake - Amazing. Not too much bubbles and lightly sweet. My boyfriend who mostly drinks beer was a fan as well. ?apparently they sell it too if you want to buy it and take it home. - First course: Signature sweet tofu - This was our favorite. It came topped with cherry blossom (sakura) syrup. Light and slightly sweet. - Second course: 1. Match green tea creme brulee - light and slightly sweet. You can taste the powdery green tea which is one reason why I like it. 2. raspberry tofu no bake cheesecake - too tart. and did not taste lie cheescake. 3. warm chocolate cake with passion fruit mochi - typical chocolate cake . - Third course: Green tea flavored chocolate lollipops - loved it. It seemed like it was more white chocolate with green tea powder in it. They don't give you much but what they give you is heavy and very rich. We took home chocolate souffle cupcakes which were a little sour but still moist and rich.

I thought this place was super-cute. ?It was a little easy to miss if I didn't know exactly where I should be looking (I had to help my friend who was meeting me via en route cellphone voice guidance). ? I had the vegan chocolate cake and the sherry as suggested on the menu. ?The chocolate cake was awesome. ?It had a fantastic texture, almost a mix between cake and brownie-- ?The coconut sorbet on top was very nice and went perfectly with the cake, the strawberry agar was interesting -- sort of reminded me of a little gummy candy but not too sweet or anything, and the peanut brittle? So. Good. ?A word on the sherry -- ?I've never had sherry before so my take might be off -- ?but EWWW. ?Yuck. ?Just, yuck. ?Never again. ?It was thick and sweet and smelled terrible -- it almost reminded me of cough syrup or something. ?Blech. Our server, I think his name was Trey, was really nice and cute, too! ?I'd probably go back just to see him.

like their lattes, i like their soft serve, their miso brownie cake is very good. the 'cupcake' they have was dry and not that flavorful. i've never tried any of their actual food so i can't really comment on that. the place is small and in a location i dont really prefer to visit (midtown west on restaurant row). i would never go out of my way to visit the place and maybe it's the prices that steer me clear of here. the staff is super friendly... i just can't get myself to love the place...

Sweet little Japanese dessert place, serving soy based treats. Try the miso chocolate cake. The miso is subtle but adds an interesting complexity to the flavors. The sorbets are fruity and fresh, we got like 5 different flavors to try from. Prices are pretty reasonable. On the menu in fine print they mentioned that each person at the table must at least order 1 menu item. I found that a little presumptuous so we ignored the warning and ordered 2 desserts for the 3 of us and it worked out well. The waitress didn't mention anything and it was more than enough dessert for us!

I came to this place as a result of a Google Offer. Great experience so far! Excellent service and heavenly desserts. My favorites gotta be the Matcha Green Tea Creme Brulee and Tofu Panna Cotta! The sparkling sake that came with the voucher was the perfect drink to complement the equally perfect desserts. Love the dim and cozy atmosphere as well. But this place can get crowded. I went on a Monday evening, near closing and the place was packed. I mean it gets kinda awkward when the place is so tiny and you're seated 5" away from guests in another table. I don't fancy eavesdropping on others' conversations but I couldn't help it when we were so close together!

40 min wait on a friday night @ 8:30 for 3 I don't think I've ever had tofu-fa where the sesame paste is mixed in with tofu because I've usually had it poured over it. ?It turned out delicious though. ?The mixture was just the right consistency. ? The green tea creme brulee was also great. ?Nice soft melt-in-your-mouth taste with a green tea finish. It came with a side of peach sorbet with candied violet. ?Peach sorbet was so good....it had the crunch of the peach with the tart taste. ?Yummy.

The place is tiny, so it's almost like a war zone! Though the staff is very friendly, and the 'healthy' dessert are delicious, I really do think the price is...well...they just shouldn't expect us to poop money! Normally I don't like to complaint about price, it's just the portion of the food, I feel I'm eating white gold! Over all, it's nice, and sometimes they play really nice Electronica music.

I am very impressed with my experience here, will definitely drop by again if I am in the area next time... -- ambiance: ?excellent, clean, chic, small and intimate, dark and cool music playing.. -- service: waiter is attentive and gave excellent explanations to the assortment of dessert we ordered. -- pricing: a bit on the high side, but that's cuz I am not yet used to the NYC pricing structure, but reasonable within that catagory. -- I ordered the dessert assortment "3 course prex fixe" $17 and it came with: - classic sweet tofu dish (tasted more like Panne Cotta than tofu, pretty good, will order the full size next time) - Okayu (warm rice pudding) ?(EXCELLENT, will order full size on this next time) - green tea mousse cake (below avg) - warm chocolate cake ?(below avg) - macaroon ?

Came here last weekend to meet my friend and her bf. We were running a bit late so I think our table was already taken. We sat down in the front and ordered drinks. My drink was delicious! We sat and talked for over an hour, and were still waiting for a table. We weren't really in the mood for dessert anymore so we decided to leave. The waiter gave us some treats to try for free. The mini cupcake was adorable and tasty. :) I'll be coming back here to actually sit down and try something soon! Super cute place.

I ordered the three mini-cupcake sampler. The chocolate souffle cupcake has a strong flavor with a middle of the road sweetness and no icing. The green tea also has no icing and wasn't at all sweet, I love green tea but this just didn't do it for me. The pumpkin was by far my favorite, it had an extremely light, refreshing flavor and texture, and the cake had a deeper pumpkin taste. I was also given an even smaller mini cupcake with my check that was sooo bitter, I couldn't even finish it, it's beyond dark chocolate. The presentation was really impressive too. The only downside was that it took 20 minutes for them to come out, though I guess it's good that they're so fresh (and they were the freshest cupcakes I've ever bought).

Came here for dessert w/ my fellow dessert partner-in-crime. I admit to being somewhat particular when it comes to the sweets. We both had the KAISEKI prix fixe. Signature sweet tofu, matcha cr¨¨me br?l¨¦e, warm miso chocolate cake, soy ice cream with red beans & jeweled fruits, green tea chocolates, buttery coconut mini cakes. Seems like alot, but the portions were quite perfect. However, it was kind of a let-down. Presentation was great and each dish was nicely composed. Flavorwise, nothing really stood out. My fave was the signature sweet tofu--the simplest dish we had. The others looked better than they tasted. So overall wasn't totally impressed, noting all the good reviews and hype surrounding Kyotofu, I did have expectations. However, this place is cute, sleek and modernly designed so they do get points for that. Maybe if we ordered some shochu or did a sake flight, our Kyotofu experience would've been better. We can only wonder...

I'm not one for really cutesy-looking places, but something compelled me to walk in this weekend. Was it the sign that said sake-infused mac and cheese? Absolutely. The boy and I take the window table so we could people watch as we eat. All I got was a view of all the desserts and cupcakes, which tempted me to buy everything that was in stock (don't worry, I held back...mostly). The food itself was ridiculously good. The mac and cheese didn't disappoint, and the side sesame salad complimented the heaviness of the cheese bomb. The complimentary mimosa was a great boozy palette cleanser. For dessert, we split the sweet potato cake, which tasted like fall in my mouth. One of these days I need to crash their Sake Sunday bash. Half-price all night for sake? Get me buzzed, Kyotofu!

Amazing Japanese inspired desserts. Their signature sweet tofu dessert is silky smooth tofu with sakura sauce. I'm sure these desserts will convert any tofu-phobics out there. Undeniably amazing green matcha creme brulee. Earthy green tea custard topped with caramelized sugar makes it one of the best items to get here. The raspberry tofu no bake cheesecake is denser than would have liked, but it is good. The sparkling sake is excellent with a smooth palate and pleasant with a very clean aroma. It comes with the dessert tasting menu. The atatakai cha soba noodles are served warm and in the broth unlike traditional soba. Sumptuously flavored broth with perfectly cooked soba noodles. The shitake "bacon" were not as I expected. I was hoping for crispy, but they were like little strips of dehydrated mushrooms. Some brunch items come with complimentary Bellini, Mimosa or Bloody Mary. That makes the brunch specials a definitely good deal for about $12.

I went here for dessert with a few friends after reading about it in some magazine. The wait was about twenty minutes, and the front end was extremely cramped. The staff was very pleasant and attentive, and the woman who served us recommended many dishes after asking each of us what we preferred in a sweet dish. We ended up getting the dish which had a sample of about ?four of their desserts (fifteen dollars? We drank water), including the zensai (gelatin?) and petits fours, and though we disliked a few of them, we loved the mochi chocolate cake, and the overall atmosphere. The desserts themselves cleansed the palate, and were never obvious or overpoweringly sweet. All were gorgeously plated, and the miniature wooden spoons they gave us were freaking cute. I almost stole one. But I didn't. The portions are extremely small, but actually perfect for sharing if you're only looking for a taste of everything. Don't go here with more than one person, as the tables are really meant to accommodate a couple. It's fairly romantic with low light, and a good choice for an after-dinner dessert when you want to ditch the former restaurant. Prices are a bit expensive, but it's worth trying once. Any fans of Japanese desserts will likely love it, and most of the diners spoke Japanese when I went. It's also a bit hard to spot from the street, and I don't think they even had a name on the window or an awning. I don't drink, so I can't say much, but it looked like they had a rather expansive bar and a lot of sake varieties.

This place is pretty cool, esp to take out-of-towners. The interior is beautiful, like a lounge with high white booths and a long cocktail menu. The menu is creative and unique, and everything is presented with care. We ordered the dessert and lunch omakase, which is a good way to sample everything and makes it a lot cheaper at $11, per omakase. I am deducting some points cause the service only ok and she forgot our lunch omakase and we decided we didn't want to wait any more since we weren't that hungry. The chocolate cake was the best-really rich and creamy, the cookies were good but nothing special, the mango jelly was good, and the tofu cheesecake was..interesting. It had a slight medicinal taste to it. I didn't order a drink but everyone else liked theirs..my water had what looked like algae floating in it so i got a bit turned off to the drinks.

Just an amazing, hip, and really comforting place to have dessert. Not only is this place safe for those of us lactose-intolerant asian kids, but it offers a refreshing, healthy spin on asian fusion desserts! Four of us rolled over to Kyotofu at the end of our journey on Black Friday (including a great dinner at Sapporo), and were seated in five minutes at a quietly lit table. We immediately ordered up some expressos, the cheesecake, the special sweet tofu, and the sesame tofu. ALL DIVINE. That's right, I said divine. In the absence of a better word, the light, fluffy, sweet taste of the tofu, the similarly savoriness of the sesame version, the perfect sauces....made the two tofu dishes. Then to finish it off, the cheesecake with a beautiful peanut butter crust, topped with lychee and a little bit of creme fraiche was perfectly light and fluffy. I don't know how I'll ever eat any other cheesecake but soy based cheesecake from kyotofu. All the taste and elation - none of the guilt. Go here now. LEGIT.

So I was here for Valentine's day, and I just feel ripped off even though I didn't foot the bill. First course, 3 strawberries dipped in chocolate and 2 strawberry agar lollipops, with 2 glasses of mediocore champagne. ?Second course, two shots of sake paired with raspberry mochi covered chocolate cake. ?Third course was a small plate with 2 cookies, 1 macroon, and 1 small chocolate thing. ?The bill? ?$70 for overly sweet mediocore desserts. ?Even in tiny portions, we left plenty on the plate. ?The service was unattentive at best. So besides the novelty of this place, I just keep on scratching my head wondering why people come here. The good? ?Atmosphere, good vibe, carbonated sake. The bad? ?Way too sweet dessert, overpriced Valentine's package, crammed in like sardines, service At least my date was cool which made up for the experience, an extra star for that

To top things off, this will be my 100th review and I've chose Kyotofu to be my number 100 because... I came here a couple of times and I still love coming here. When I was coming here I almost missed it because the shop front looks so ordinary, but when you walk to the back it's like "wow this is really cutesy". I find this spot to be a cute little place for a date after dinner. The passion fruit tofu cheesecake was really good, but it is a little tarty (yep that's passion fruit for you). The housemade sorbets were a delicious! I have a thing for black sesame in general and I love sweet tofu, but when black sesame meets sweet tofu, it is like the best thing ever! From the bakery the mini choko brownies are really moist from the bite and when you open your mouth all the chocolate is stuck to the roof of your mouth. However every time I come here I love getting the raspberry lychee anmitsu! Something about the agar that I really like. Too bad this one is only on the summer menu. It would be awesome if this wasn't on the summer menu only.

I was in the mood for dessert after dinner so of course, I found this place on Yelp and decided to stop by. ?It was close to our hotel in Times Square...only about 3 blocks down and I liked that it was open late...past midnight. ? It was a tiny little place and so it was a little hard to find since the shop sign nor the street # was in existence. ?Once we walked in, we saw the mini kitchen area. ?We got seated in the back area, where it was dim. ?Seemed more like a lounge than a dessert place, but it was relaxing to be there. Their menu also consisted of sakes, wines, and appetizers as well. We tried the green tea soymilk soft serve ice cream and warm mochi chocolate cake. ?The ice cream was really light and not very sweet. ?I liked how it had just a hint of green tea flavor. ?The chocolate cake was a lava cake with warm mochi in the middle. ?It was not too sweet, but very rich that I couldn't really finish it. ?The plating and the actual plates were unique. ?Even the coffee was tasty and it came in a nice cup design. ?Reminded me of a cafe in Japan.

The food here is better than the desserts. Do get the burger and pigs in a blanket. Don't get the truffled egg and brioche - that is unless you'd be impressed by the simplicity of hard-boiled egg served alongside toast. I swear that's what it tasted like. The desserts here - their bread and butter - are only okay. They're really good looking, but they look better than they taste. And their award-winning chocolate cupcake? Meh. Cupcakes are carriers for frosting, and their frosting left me wanting so much more...

I went there for a light dinner and desert. Tried the sampler ( 4 dishes for $16). The portion was really really really tiny... not impressed either. The black sesame sweet tofu was very good indeed. And we also ordered warm chocolate cake. The mochi filling is very interesting, but the cake was not soft enough for my taste. In general, it's a good place for deserts, and chatting with friends. If I ever go, it will be just for the sweet tofu....maybe the cute waiter too...

Saw an article online about kyotofu and wanted to try it out. ?On our first visit we ordered some chocolate souffl¨¦s to go and had the ginger soft serve. ?That was DELICIOUS!!! ?The soft serve flavors are ever changing so the other times we've gone it's been different. ?But if you see ginger, go for it!!! The chocolate souffl¨¦s are really good, best to eat them fresh out of the oven (smells like chocolate heaven when they come out) or if you're taking some home, pop them in the microwave for 30 seconds so it's nice and warm. At night it's an upbeat atmosphere b/c of the music and it gets crowded. ?Great people watching spot is the front counter since you're facing the street. ?The place doesn't have the name emblazoned on the front and has a HUGE door so passerbys are always curious as to what the place is and what you're eating that you have such a huge smile on your face. We haven't had any other dishes besides dessert but i've seen some and they look delish. ?We'll definitely go back to try some of the tapas.

The anti-Superbowl night was a delicious deal! $18 for the pigs in a duvet, tofu dips, curried arancini, sliders and the salad. Add a mac and cheese, a bottle of sake 50% discounted and a dessert kaiseki and you make bf/gf very happy. Dessert are definitely the highlight but the finger food is equally delicious. Have to say that we couldn't taste or smell the truffle in the mac and cheese at all, and hey....$12....maybe it should have been more than 0.1% of the dish, no? Loved the kuromitsu sweet tofu, a piece of art....better than some panna cottas out there...and so silky. We also walked out with free mini cupcakes, I mean, can you make me more happy? And the chef was a pleasure to watch, slowly but steadily moving, I loved her zen.

I love this place. The best dessert place I've been to so far. I started with a Soymilk Soft Ice Cream Sundae ($7) that came with a mixed berry compote, matcha mochi, and fresh strawberry pieces. It was more like a frozen yogurt taste and consistency, but it was amazing. The flavors were not as in your face as other vegan ice creams I have had, but that was okay because the compote brought much stronger flavor. It was a really great dessert. I also appreciated the mochi on top. I really loved the textures going on in this sundae. I was so amazed by the quality of my first dessert that I decided to get a second one. I shared a Trio of Sorbets ($9) with my girlfriend. The trio is made in-house daily with a selection of seasonal ingredients. On the day we went, the three scoops were of passion fruit, strawberry, and blueberry. I think the strawberry one also had yuzu in it but i'm not sure and the blueberry might have had rhubarb. Either way it was completely amazing and came with a side of fresh blackberries and raspberries. Perfect consistency and flavor. A lot of sorbet just tastes like sugar and fake fruit. With this sorbet, you could really taste the ingredients. The people here are really friendly too. I'm coming back here soon.

Kyotofu is one of my favorite places in the city! I regret not coming here more often when I lived 3 blocks away! The dessert is to DIE for! I'm very biased towards tofu, but really, even a tofu hater can like the dessert here! The presentation is beautiful and the flavors are subtle yet iconic. My favorite is the black sesame tofu with the hojicha syrup. Such a strong black sesame flavor - love it! Their brunch is a pretty good deal. Delicious food (like, really delicious!) with a free drink for $15 or less. Definitely try the sake infused mac n cheese. The truffled egg and toast. Fluffy bread with 2 poached eggs on top and ohhhh the truffles! Yum!! And if you're feeling adventurous, get the chef's omakase, which is like 3-5 small dishes. Great for variety!

This place opens at 12 pm so it was a little annoyed that it was 11 am and I was super hungry and I had to kill time at The Coffee Pot across the street. I know this sounds weird but the restroom was so warm, I didn't want to leave because inside the restaurant it was freezing cold and it was super cold outside!! I ordered the lunch omakase which is the Chef's selection. It came with unagi, pork sausage, chicken meatballs, homemade tofu, rice, Japanese pickles and the roasted kabocha soup. Everything was good, the soup was really good but it was cold. My friend ordered the yellow tail nigiri--def. not your typical sushi roll but was good. For dessert we got the dessert omakase... creme brulee, brownie, and tofu with brown sugar. the creme brulee was good, tasted like green tea brownie was good too however the tofu one was okay, the brown sugar was too sweet The service is a little slow here. But other than that, the food was good.

Disappointed ... had high expectations given the reviews .. The place is tiny so it fills up fast ... waited 20 minutes on a Sunday night .. The only highlight was the truffle mac and cheese with pancetta ($12) .. we came primarily for dessert but I'm glad I also ordered this .. otherwise I would've regretted coming at all .. The soft serve ice cream was good and creamy but the trimmings fell short .. the "brownie" crumble was stale! The signature sweet tofu was not sweet at all .. the tofu itself had a very light and silky consistency but the flavor was simply tofu .. not sweetened, no added vanilla or hint of anything else .. the syrup added some sweetness but the entire dish was just not to my taste ... I didn't love the taste of the syrup, and the tofu was so bland and boring .. Overall these desserts don't compare to what I've had in SF (which do live up to their hype) ... If I had no expectations at all I would've found the dessert decent but they definitely don't taste as high end as they are presented. The place is redeemed by the mac and cheese and the delicious sake (which are half off on Sundays)!

I was in Hell's Kitchen and really wanted dessert after eating at Totto Ramen, so I decided to give this place a try. ?I'm so glad that I did because this is a super cute, chill spot. ?We decided to get their dessert sampler because we couldn't make up our minds. ?So glad we did because it was delicious. ?We got to try the signature sweet tofu, warm sweet potato cake, chocolate brownie and matcha green tea creme brulee, nama chocolate (which looked like green tea sticks). ?My favorites were the sweet tofu and sweet potato cake. ?Yum...I can't wait to return and try other desserts. Note: it may look closed or dead from the outside, but their is seating in back. ?The decor is very sophisticate and modern. ?Great ambiance and alcohol menu as well.

This little place on ninth avenue is awesome for a small group Japanese ?brunch. The space is very small. The service is above average. The tofu salad, is a must have. It is a large mound of one of the best tasting, softest tofus I have ever had. The sake infused Mac and cheese is great. The desert selection is quite extensive. The mini Cupcakes and cookies are awesome. Pricing is very reasonable.

I have only ever come here for dessert and probably will only come here for dessert. Seating is always the difficult issue here as both times I came with parties of 5/6 and we were scrunched at the tall bar seating at the front of the restaurant. Nevertheless, dessert is very good here and we usually end up ordering 3-4 desserts and splitting it family style. I recommend the black sesame pudding and the creme brulee. I love that they have a seasonal menu.

After Lincoln Center, we went here on our way downtown. The Dessert Club is better. We had the black sesame and the green tea creme brullee. A bit pricey for the ambiance and just dessert. Not bad, but i'm glad we didn't make a special trip just for this! I glanced over at the table next to me and they half-finished their tasting. The portions are a bit too big... I think they should reduce the portion size.

Awesome date place!!!... ?Too bad I wasn't on one when I visited. ?Thus, my experience was somewhat diminished. I must say though, it's quite clever to open an Asian dessert bar. ?In this economic downturn, you can't splurge but you also don't want to appear cheap to your date. ?In comes the dessert bar. ?You can lounge over tea and/or coffee, with a dessert each. ?Soft, sweet, silken tofu that melts in your mouth (quite sensual, methinks). ?You can savor hours of endless conversations to get to know each other better, and in the end your bill may come to less than that of the price of dinner and a movie. ?Your wallet wins, and your date is happy because she thinks you're a great listener! ?Yay!... ? So..., someone just needs to open one in San Francisco. ?And I'm not talking about Hong Kong dessert bar or Quickly. ?It needs to be classy, swanky, but not expensive. ?Any investors?

yay i was excited for another college year to start, which means another chance to go to kyotofu! i had never had a meal here, so my friend and i decided to order 'toad in a hole' and 'atatakai cha soba noodles.' toad in a hole was a poached egg over toast with salad and atatakai cha soba noodles were green tea buckwheat noodles in mushroom broth, served with a complimentary drink of your choice, and my friend ordered the tokyo bloody mary. toad in a hole was delicious, but the side salad had a very sour dressing that made me not touch it after my first bite. my friend's soba noodles were delicious too with a very clean taste, but the complimentary drink was undrinkable...it was made with wasabi and 10 kinds of peppers, a taste that was very unfamiliar. to ease our disappointments, we ordered a dessert omakase of 3, which had matcha green tea creme brulee, miso chocolate brownie, and green tea sweet tofu! the dessert confirmed our belief that kyotofu does dessert the best, and we decided to come here ONLY for divine desserts ! :)

Great dessert spot, particularly for the area. I've been here 3 or 4 times, most recently with JT H. and two other friends. Please see his review for comments on our selections as I agree with pretty much everything he wrote :) Just a warning that service here can be spotty, particularly if you're seated in the front, sometimes-forgettable section.

Who knew tofu could taste like heaven? ?Desserts prepared with the most amazing mix of flavors - everything here is nothing short of amazing. ?The place is tiny, so I am writing this rather reluctantly as I don't want to see it become more popular than what it already is. ?I highly recommend the 3-course dessert tasting. ?It may be too much for one person (unless you are really hungry and love dessert), but just perfect for two. They also have a nice set of gift boxes. ?I got one for my friend who introduced me to this place. ?I recommend their green tea chocolates, warm chocolate miso cake, and signature black tofu dessert.

I've been fortunate to have tried mostly everything on the menu. I'm usually very pleased with what I order, but some items are much better than others, so below is my assessment of their food. MUST EAT (5 stars): - Kuro Goma Sweet Tofu: If you like black sesame desserts, then this is a definite must. If it's your first time having a black sesame dessert, you may not love it as I think it's an acquired taste. Their sweet tofu desserts are made like panna cotta, with cream and soymilk. They're not actually tofu, fyi. The actual "tofu" part isn't too sweet, and it's complemented very well by the sweet hoji-cha syrup that accompanies it. My favorite dessert in all of NYC. - Regular Sweet Tofu: My second fav dessert in all of NYC. If you like panna cotta or annin tofu, you'll love this. - Mac & Cheese (with truffle pate, pancetta): deeeelicious. Just order it. - Summer/Winter Anmitsu: ice cream with red bean, mochi, and Japanese gelatin sweets. - Genmai Financiers: They give you little financiers at the end with your check. You can also buy them up front. Their other sweets-- matcha financier, muffins, etc, are okay, but not worth buying. LIKED (3-4 stars): - ?Croquettes: Regularly good. - Pistachio Creme Brulee: Sort of tastes like pistachio butter. I'm a huge fan of regular creme brulee, so I prefer the classic taste, but this is very interestingly done. Worth a try, but won't order again. If they come back with green tea creme brulee, that one is better. - Chamame: Well-seasoned edamame COULD DO WITHOUT (1-2 stars): - Rice Pudding (Poached pear okayu): Strange flavor - Pigs in a blanket: Nothing special - Trio of tofu dips: they will recommend this as something that is easy to share. While that is true, it's not that good. It tastes like bland hummus. - Mushroom salad: Decent, but not worth the price. I'd rather eat their famous desserts and make this salad at home.

How does a place so popular still have a stand at a street fair?? You would think it wouldn't need to declare their presence, they're already so popular and highly rated (not just on Yelp, but apparently in NY magazines/newspapers as well!). I went to the July 4th street fair near Battery Park this past weekend, and there was a small little booth in the middle with a no nonsense display of cupcakes, both regular sized, and tiny ones in a sampler pack. Tiny brownies too! What caught my attention were the signs saying this place was highly rated. So, I grabbed a sampler bag and chomped in. The sampler pack came with a chocolate green tea cupcake, chocolate souffle, vanilla citrus, and coconut. I was not a fan of the coconut (I don't like coconut in general, so no fault of the cupcake) and the vanilla citrus (very strange taste, didn't taste like citrus to me). I loved the chocolate green tea and the chocolate souffle though - they were light, chocolately, airy, and had just the right amount of flavor and sweetness to not be overwhelming. On top of that, these cupcakes don't need frosting!

Oh if it weren't for my allergies to soy I would eat this forever. Met up with my very awesome friend, and fellow yelper Ben Y. and his girlfriend at this very popular spot. Kyotofu is cute and cozy, located right on the street, and kind of easy to miss if you don't carefully look where you are going. We waited for about 20 minutes, but it was worth it. I got the suggestion of ordering black sesame tofu, which was simply amazing....until I felt my throat start to have that fun burning sensation. Me, being stupid tried eating all of it because it was so refreshing and light. The consistency reminds me of almond jello, and as I mentioned, very easy to eat a lot in one sitting. Needless to say I would go back again next time I'm in the city - but will probably try to limit my intake on the tofu. :(

We popped in here for late night desserts, after a night out at the theatre and really loved it. Kyotofu is a chic bar / restaurant with a variety of unusual desserts (they also have a general food menu). We had the kaisake tasting menu which has a number of courses, featuring miniatures of their desserts. Most memorable for me was tofu creme br?l¨¦e - who knew you could make creme br?l¨¦e from tofu?! I didn't, but I recommend trying it! All of the desserts were delicious and served with a certain flair that made sure you knew that they were the stars of the show. I will be bringing all of my friends when we need to satisfy our collective sweet tooth.

I've heard raving reviews on Kyotofu and am more than delighted to find it 3 blocks away from where I live. I just love, love, love desserts. However, Kyotofu didn't exactly deliver. The souffle chocolate cake tasted decadent, until I tried mixing it with the miso. Together, they just tasted forced. Green tea brule was very good and the highlight of the 3 desserts that we ordered. The tofu pudding was good, but it lacked any special touch. But I'm not giving up, I'm planning to go back to taste more.

I came here for my birthday and basically ate everything on the menu. Okay, not everything, but a lot. Black sesame tofu was wonderful; strawberry-rhubarb cobbler with mint ice cream was amazing (who'd have thunk it?); mochi chocolate cake was moist and delicious but so small (good for my arteries... bad for my greedy face). In terms of quantity of food per dollar, the strawberry rhubarb stuff was definitely the best value. We also got a lot of the tapas-style food, and it was great, too - we were fighting over the eel wrapped in phyllo dough. Roasted edamame was so hot and salty and buttery that it tasted like movie popcorn. And we had no problems whatsoever with the service; our waiter was sweet and charming and my dining companions were both contemplating trying to seduce him. Delicious food, intimate space (VERY intimate - make reservations), no complaints whatsoever. ?A great birthday meal.

i came here for dessert ONLY (we ate at a different place), and it is on that I judge kyotofu. ?Obviously, I think you should EAT HERE FOR DESSERT!! ?i want to especially point out how this place plays hip music, but not at eardrum destroying levels. ?it's so rare to find such a hip place where you can chat with the people you care about without screaming at each other. green tea ice cream sunday- ?i love green tea and green tea flavored things, so if you aren't into that sort of taste, don't expect my review to suddenly convert you. ?but if you are into green tea, then this is a top notch green tea delight. ?the presentation was very artsy fartsy, and the serving size was very big. ?it comes with an assortment of condiments- fruit, green tea mochi, and chocolate crumbles (my personal favorite). ?it also comes with pocky sticks...i guess you dip them into the ice cream when you get bored of the spoon. sesame seed sweet tofu- ?this is a very light taste, and very sweet, just like the name implies. ?i don't particularly like the sesame seed aspect of the dessert, but that's because i don't like sesame seeds in general. ?don't ask me why i asked for sesame seeds- sometimes i just don't think. ?but i figure if you like sesame seed, you'll like this dessert. ?and if you like dessert in general, why aren't you eating here?!?

Love it! Went for brunch on a saturday morning and it was great. Made reservations and was seated promptly. The service was friendly and attentive. The brunch was yummy... the portions were a little on the small side... but hey, saved a lot of room for desert!!! And lets be honest... this IS a desert destination. So keep that in mind! But the food was good! Tried the french toast and their mac and cheese (oh sooo goood)... Brunch comes with a complimentary brunch drink... mimosa, bellini, or bloody mary. And the desert was AMAZING!!! Tried their signature sweet tofu and it was really fantastic!! Also their cheesecake was pretty good too! This is definitely a great place to try! Good for couples and small groups.. not exactly the kind of place to take a large bunch of friends to... but perfect for an intimate brunch of 2-4 people. So if your sweet tooth is calling... you wont be disappointed!

For my lucky 77th review on yelp, I will have to pick Kyotofu. ?I am from Kyoto myself, so anything/place with the name "Kyoto" on it will gain extra attention from me. ?Moreover, Kyoto is famous for having the best tofu in Japan. ?I just had to check this place out if Kyotofu didn't disgrace Kyoto's name with their name.

I loved the menu. Servers offered a variety of drinks and savory and sweet appetizers. ? The drinks ranged from bellinis to sake. ?The standout dishes were mushroom pastry, miso cod, and salmon rolls. ?The food was substantial enough to be dinner and the desserts were great.

If you are from out of state, direction challenged and need a big ass sign for anything in other words if you are like me then don't waste time reading this cause you are not gonna find this place. It is11 PM, my gf and I just got out of Lion King and wanted to check this place out. I had all the foody places that I wanted try marked with green post it pointers so my map was so full of green pointers. It is 11:30PM and by now we had gone up and down on 9th (between 48th and 49th) couple of times and couldn't find a Kyotofu sign. Now I am beginning to doubt the green post-it pointers, but they haven't failed me so far, may be the Kyotofu post-it moved ?in my constant opening and folding of the map or may be my gf moved the post-it since she doesn't like tofu, but I thought she liked... with all these crazy things going on in my head I was ready to call off this mission finding Kyotofu. But suddenly I hear my gf yelling, "look I think that could be it" and she was pointing across the street and from where we were I could see two bar stools and got a glimmer of hope. We cross the street and it is KYOTOFU! At that time on a Wednesday night we were the only ones and place was how I expected it to be a trendy Japanese dessert bar. We had the black sesame sweet tofu and vanilla parfait. It did take a while for the desserts to arrive but they were strikingly beatiful. Sweet tofu comes with a tea syrup on the side, without the syrup sweet tofu is not that sweet and it has a lovely sesame flavour. I've never had anything like this before. Vanilla partfait was really good too. Overall you are in for some serious tosserts (tofu desserts) once you locate Kyotofu!

Perhaps you have to order the normal sized desserts to really enjoy something spectacular, but I ordered the mini versions of the chocolate souffle cupcake, green tea cupcake, and the macaroons and was disappointed with each one. Both of the mini cupcakes tasted dry and stale. The green tea was slightly better than the chocolate souffle, but... the chocolate souffle was supposedly voted the best in the city??? That has GOT to be a fluke. They were all out of the chocolate macarons, so I had the black sesame (which really had potential to be a very fantastic flavor), and the coconut (which had a tangy and gross filling). Each macaron was served cold, which made me feel as if they had been kept in the fridge, and were hard as rocks. As I sat by the window trying not to look completely crushed and disappointed at making a wasted out of the way trip to Hell's Kitchen, the guy behind the counter brought me a chocolate macaron, which he said they had just made more of. You'd think that there's no way a fresh macaron could be screwed up... but you'd be wrong. It tasted just as cold and hard as the others. The guy who works there was super nice, and the barley matcha tea I had ordered was probably the best tea I've ever had, but the desserts were a disappointment.

This is a really cute little place! I liked it way more than the BF when we came to NY. ?I was yelping around and BF loves dessert so wanted to take him somewhere nice. Per reviews, decided to try out Kyotofu. ?This is a small place with some seating in the front bar area (if you find a seat, take it) or a few tables in the back (wait your turn). ?It was a packed Saturday night when we went but we luckily were able to grab 2 seats in the bar area without too long of a wait. The place has 2 servers, which you would think is enough for such a small place, but they were scrambling all over.. they should have someone just to man the cash register as there are quite a bit of people just ordering desserts to go, who have to wait a long time to get taken care of. They have food other than dessert but its dessert you should get and thats what we came for. ?We tried the prix fixe 3 course dessert, which was less than $20, so was actually a great deal. ?We got to try 5 of their desserts: started out with their sweet tofu, then had the strawberry shortcake, chocolate cake and cheesecake, which were all good. ?I can't remember the last thing that came out, might have been a sorbet. but i was too stuffed at that point to remember. ?But I thought it was a great deal and definitely the perfect size to split with someone (don't try to eat it all yourself). ?When we got the check, they gave us 2 mini chocolate cupcakes, which is their signature item, but since i'm not a big cupcake fan, i thought it was just alright. nothing special. ?I really enjoyed this place and am happy that its doing well!

You know how some people/men/women/gf/bf help you on your path to self discovery, and you (hopefully) become a better person thanks to that person? Well, thanks to kyotofu, I have discovered my love for sesame. I mean, I've always had the stuff...little black/white grains that were suppose to help my intelligence..the syrup-y goo like filling in my chinese tong yuans.....but kyotofu took it to another level. The greentea cheese cake was flavorful and not at all heavy, but really, it doesn't warrant a 4 star review without the intense sesame flavor from the ice cream. Oh sesame. My friend had the chocolate cake with mochi, and I thought it tasted wonderful, especially with the mochi in the cake adding a very unique texture to the cake. The path to self discovery continues, and I shall become a better person after I return and try the sesame tofu dessert.

White walls and banquettes make up the small dining room located in the back of the space. ?Came in just for dessert and they had some interesting japanese style tapas. ?They also serve beer, wine and have a pretty extensive sake list. Went with the three course chef tasting for $17 which was a very good price. ?Started off with what I believe was a tofu flan. ?It was a light and refreshing. ?Next course was a sweet potato cake which was my favorite of the night not too sweet and topped with ice cream. ?I'm not the biggest chocolate guy but I really didn't like any of the chocolate desserts they brought out. ?A souffle then a couple small brownies and little green truffles. ?I did surprisingly enjoy the Green tea bruelle. ?Altogether an intresting place worth checking out.

I came here with certain expectations upon reading the reviews and I wasn't disappointed yet at the same time, it just didn't have the "wow" factor. I only came here for desserts with my food partner. She got the mini cupcakes and I opted for the regular ones. Cupcakes were small, similiar to size at Magnolia's but no frosting on top like we're used to. The chocolate souflee was lacking in it's taste. Honestly, it tasted more like a home made brownie mix I could have gotten from a supermarket. The Apple Cinnamon was lighter and sweet but had too much of a muffin texture to it. I will come back however b/c the entree menu looked great. Sake infused Mac N' Cheese!!! Presentation is definitely great and so is service. I would give that 4 stars alone. The cupcakes.... solid 3.

Woot ordered the entire menu thanks to a generous corporate Seamless account. So pricing aside, Kyotofu offers up some really creative and tasty treats! Top picks: both types of sweet tofu, matcha green tea creme brulee ~super smooth/creamy and great balance of flavors (not too sweet) Not impressed: miso chocolate cake, sorbets ~odd textures, cake was a bit dry and sorbet flavors were average Would I return on my own dime? Sure, but I'd stick with the front runners and also try something from their japanese tea selection.

Their desserts have a really delicate flavor. Not too sweet. Loved that. I had the Soymilk Ice Cream Sundae and the Black Sesame Tofu Something or other. The Sundae had an "anmitsu whipped cream" which was mindblowing. I really loved the mix of Eastern and Western flavors. The black sesame tofu thing was so bouncy and delicate. I really liked it. The desserts were pretty damn good, there's just something about the place that didn't do it for me. Maybe it was the awkward service or something, but... Then again, I'm not THAT much of a dessert person, and maybe I'm just going to be like that forever... I think I didn't like their baked things. Their cold thingies looked better. Also, I could see a lot of people in their kitchen (it's in the middle of the place, with a huge glass wall, making it look like a laboratory), and they were standing around, kind of staring at us. It was weird.

I have been to Kyotofu quite a few times, both for just dessert and also for their brunch. This place is just adorable. I had sat at some of the tall tables in the front and also in the dining room in the back, both are delightful. I love their signature sweet tofu... in fact, I would go back just that have that one dish. Their black sesame sweet tofu is wonderful as well. The prix-fixe dessert can be tricky, so I generally just order my own. Well, true to the name, I think everything here that relates to tofu is delicious. I probably would come back here for their desserts, but not so much for their food. But that doesn't mean the food is not good. The pancakes weren't that different from... well... pancakes, but of course the presentation is beautiful. Their simmered lotus root is delicious and refreshing, but I'm not as big a fan of the lotus root chips. Portions tend to be on the smaller side so be aware of that. The sweet potato cheesecake was very good, but for some reason I didn't taste much of the sweet potato. This is a super cute place to take your friends... just make sure they don't have enormous appetites (and just want huge bites of everything) or have a sweet tooth.

We took a day trip to NYC and happened to run into Kyotofu. Although they server food as well, we were only interested in desserts and coffee that night. This restaurant reminded me of Iron Chef where the chefs compete by making several dishes using the "selected" ingredient of the day. Kyotofu uses Tofu as their ingredient in all their desserts. We went with a few people so were able to try everything on their dessert menu :-) and were not disappointed with any of them. The place is trendy looking and also serves great coffee and tea.

I loved the food here, I really did, but I'm having a really hard time giving this restaurant a better review because of the absurd price tag and the puny portions. I came here for the special prefix menu on their third anniversary, and despite the $25 price tag, I was hungry enough at the end to eat a second dinner. The sake was also expensive by expensive sake bar standards. On average the food was pretty good. The unagi, the croquet, the red snapper sushi, and the scallops in the prefix meal were all fantastic, but the slider felt really out of place (although, I would say it was an above average slider) and I really didn't care for the cold green beans at all. Now as for the dessert... Wow, the dessert was phenomenal. Not only was my dessert phenomenal but it seemed like every dessert everyone in my party got was phenomenal. I personally had the sweet tofu and although I've had sweet tofu many times in my life as part of Chinese dim sum, I've never had it like this. There was some subtle difference that just made it so delicious. If you've never had sweet tofu or if you hate sweet tofu or even if you hate tofu in general, something tells me that you will still love this dessert. Given how expensive this place is and how tiny the dinner portions are, I cannot recommend this place as a good dinner sport, but I can *definitely* vouch for this restaurant as a fantastic dessert spot.

An extremely cute place for desserts and a light snack. The people here are helpful and rather attentive to your needs. The place is very small which I commend because so is the kitchen. There aren't many patisseries in this kitchen (about two or three) and they really focus on each of the desserts. Baking isn't in batch except for light snacks and food, but not for the desserts. They work on three to five of them at one go and they really ensure that each of them tastes the best. It's the modern japanese take on desserts and there's barely any hit of japan left in it, which may be good for those who aren't into asian desserts. However, the taste still works and it's one of the best go-to places for valentines and first/second dates.

I tried the vegan chocolate cupcake (their signature) and my first bite into it I was swooning. It was probably the creamiest and most decadent vegan dessert I've ever had. I still cannot believe that it was made without dairy. It was small but packed a perfect chocolatey punch. Definitely recommend!!! Their soft serve ice cream is also very very good. I don't eat ice cream very often but I would definitely come back for seconds.

For soy based desserts (not all ice cream either) this is probably the best spot to go. ?Believe the hype about the green tea creme brulee, it's a must try! The last time I went to Kyotofu was more than a year ?or two ago and I remember loving the 3 course tasting menu. ?Went back yesterday and ordered the tasting again and it has definintely changed but for the better! Remember loving both the sweet tofu, the regular one and the sesame one and loooved their soft serve so when I inquired about the 3 courses for the tasting, one of them was the regular sweet tofu but they didn't offer the soft serve anymore so we got a small soft serve on the side. ?It was smooth cold refereshing creamy soy goodness. The first course was the sweet tofu was some kind of syrup, it tasted like something you'd put on flan, the name escapes me now but the tofu was sooooooo creamy. ?I always say creamy because they perfect the texture. ?It really was awesome. ?Tasted like soy milk and soft tofu but with a really pleasant sweet/creamy after taste. Second course was a Japanese pancake with mint ice cream in the middle, a warm miso chocolate cake and the green tea creme brulee. ?MmMmm. ?I love creme brulee and fell in love with the delicate green tea flavor and perfect caramelized top. ?The pancake and warm chocolate cake was delicious was well but I really LOVED the green tea creme brulee. To finish off the tasting was Japanese matcha fudge. ?Thick gooey pieces of matcha/green tea flavored fudge. ?A perfect end to the perfect soy experience :)

Holy moly, the matcha green tea cr¨¨me br?l¨¦e is REALLY good. ?Its air-whipped texture and lovely green tea flavor is subtly caramelized without the burnt taste or glue-to-your-teeth stickness so commonly found in cr¨¨me br?l¨¦es. It's complimented by lychee sorbet, a vanilla bean tuile (lightweight crispy cookie), and a sprinkling of candied violet. Fo real, this is what heaven must taste like. A delicate concoction of clouds, air, light, and matcha. Their small plates and comfort mains are equally delicious. The mac-and-cheese is a melted sensation of gruyere, truffle, and pancetta bits. It's topped with a winning layer of baked panko breadcrumbs (Are you drooling yet?). A thoughtful, fancier spin on your usual mac-and-cheese and incomparable to that packaged Kraft nastiness. The chicken-and-tofu sliders are quite good as well. They come in a trio with sweet potato chips, which has the thickness and crunch of taro chips. I appreciate that I can't detect the presence of tofu in the patty... None of that weird-tasting soy patty stuff for me, thank you! I can't wait to come back to try Kyotofu's other dishes and desserts. The portions are small-ish, but an entr¨¦e, dessert, and cocktail was enough to fill me without stuffing my brains out.

I've been here so many times in the past two month it's almost embarrassing! Let's cut to the chase. Their desserts are perfect. Perfect textural contrasts, perfect flavor pairings, perfectly generous portions. I love the delicate, soft black sesame sweet tofu (paired with an exquisite hojicha syrup), the creamy green tea creme brulee (off set by a tart sorbet), and the sweet yet subtly salty warm miso chocolate cake. And for the lactose intolerant (e.g. me), their soy softserve is a godsend.

We waited about an hour before finally being seated. I appreciated their effort to create a romantic ambiance by having their lighting dim, but I personally found it way too dark. It was difficult to take a picture even using my DSLR with 1.8/f aperture lens. Ridiculoso! I ordered coffee, sesame tofu-fa, and green tea creme brulee. The tofu-fa was amazingly good. I've never had it before and was a delight to my taste buds. The creme brulee tasted good on the merits of being creme brulee, but the subtle green tea flavor didn't really add anything to it. The coffee was pretty average - better than the BK Joe but not as good as Seattle's Best. It's also a bit too noisy to have any kind of meaningful conversation, so I'd avoid this place for a date. Then again, this is New York City. Maybe that's why New York City is a terrible place for singles. Go NJ!

I am usually cheap with the 5s...but this place is freaking amazing! Was suppose to meet up with my girlfriend at around 6PM but she was running late....so i didnt want to stand outside like a idiot...so i went in and asked if i can sit at a table and order something to drink before she gets there.... The "Sake Master" lady told me if its ok to sit at the front where the tall stools were located....and i said yes. She brought over the sake menu and the dinner menu...at first i really wanted to try the Imo (Sweet Potato) Sake...but she told me its actually really strong and i should maybe try something else first....so after taking her advice on the selections of drinks...i went with Kamoizumi Kome Kome = Happy Bride! OMG it was sooo good...ahahahaha...it wasnt strong like the usual sake...but definitely a good start before dinner...and after NYE! lol... After waiting about 30min, my girlfriend finally arrived...i asked the waiter if there is a table available in the back..and he said someone is actually leaving in 5mins...and if i dont mind waiting....HELLO, i waited 30mins for my girlfriend to show up...another 5min isnt going to kill me! LOL~ So of course i said NO! LOL~ We got seated quickly, my girlfriend ordered the Ginger Margarita and since it was Happy Hour...it was half off...woohooo....lol....As for dinner...I had the Sakura prefix dinner Obento....while my girlfriend had the other one...which i cant remember the name right now...FAILED lol.... The food was soooo good..and it was the right proportion too...after finishing the Sakura obento...we decided to order some desserts...i mean its Kyotofu afterall....I had the Yuzu Tofu Cheesecake, and my girlfriend had Soymilk Soft Ice Cream Sundae and we shared a Matcha Green Tea Creme Brulee...I cant believe we ate all that in one sitting....CRAZY!!!!! But, OMG! They were SO GOOD!!!! Service throughout was really good....i liked the guy waiter alot...good sense of humor and he was attentive.... Note: Their menu changes throughout the 4 seasons....we tried their Winter Menu this time....cant wait till Spring comes so i can try new yummy food....=)

I've been here several times because it's a cute and laid back atmosphere. Usually a great place to grab dessert with friends. However, the last time I was here the girl working at the front was incredibly rude, and I'm debating on going back. However, if you chose to come here, I would recommend the following items: * Black sesame sweet tofu * Anmitsu * Vegan valrhona chocolate cake - I was craving some chocolate so this hit the spot. ? * Soymilk soft ice cream sundae - safe choice, I've never been disappointed by this. * Trio of sorbets - if you want something light, this is a good choice. My friend was super hungry so he ordered the Curry Rice with a hard boiled egg and kurobuta sausage. He said it was just okay, nothing special.

If you love flan and creme brulee, this is your place. Their signature sweet tofu is similar to creme brulee, but lighter and much better! The asian version of these popular western desserts. Love it. They've also developed a black sesame tofu dish, which is equally delicious. And maybe cause I'm so partial to creme brulee, the green tea creme brulee deserves some mention. To pair the desserts, a long list of tea, sake and shochu is available. I've tried a sparkling rose sake here. Very interesting! Sake flights are on the menu too. Something I haven't quite seen elsewhere. Trying more sake is on my agenda since my trip to Tokyo. Sake as a drink to be savored is under-rated. I've been here a few times and tried their savory dishes, but have to admit that I'm not enthralled. I would say to stick to their strengths: desserts! The ambience is a cute hole-in-the-wall type of place. I personally like the minimalist look and the warm, yellowy tone it takes on in the evening. Good for after-dinner desserts and some asian drinks.

I actually didn't go to the restaurant but I got their Valentine's gift box. The box contains 3 of their desserts: Miso Chocolate brownies, Strawberry Almond Financier and Yuzu Shortbread Cookies. ?I haven't tried the Strawberry Almond ones yet, but the other two is unique! The Yuzu shortbread has a really chewy texture which I never had in shortbread before. ?But what I actually like the best is the brownies! ?It is soooo moist and derricous!!! The brownie is SERIOUSLY so rich! ?If you had to pick out of the three desserts, choose the brownie and grab yourself a cold glass of milk because you'll need it! : )

At first I did not realize this is a Japanese dessert restaurant at all.Once I read the menu, and I saw some Japanese characters, I suddenly find that this restaurant has a cool name - Kyotofu. Kyotofu is a famous traveling destination in Japan. At the same time, it is known for its culture and history. As to me, I think that it is really a peaceful and quiet place to relax. ?The environment of this restaurant is not that traditional Japanese style, but definitely very peaceful. Plus the dessert here is not heavy and sweet at all. I have to admit that I am not a big fan for dessert, but this place is highly recommended.

I almost feel bad for giving this place 1 star because I've heard so much good things about this place as well as the raves here on Yelp. I've always wanted to try this place but it's out of the way for me so I always forget about this place until I saw a Google offer, I had to get it. It just started pouring as we got into the tiny restaurant. There were no seats for my party of 2 but there was an empty table for 4 inside. They did not sit us there. My husband & I waited a good 10 minutes and another table of 4 left. We thought we should be seated now that no one was coming. There were now 8 empty seats inside and one of the waitresses told me that they were "reserved". Just after she said that, a party of 3 came in and one of them said "It's better than waiting outside, let's just eat here". They were seated immediately. My husband & I were getting frustrated and tired. We've been very patient! I felt like our party of 2 was and "odd" number. We wanted to leave if it weren't for the Google offer we wanted to use before the expiration date. They would rather the customers wait in the small hallway outside the kitchen than to sit them at a table with extra chairs, god-forbid a party of 4 comes in. Our first course of the "Dessert sampler" was a very tiny panna cotta, about the size of a shot glass. Instead of having the sparkling sake that was offered, we chose a hot tea and an iced tea instead, which was allowed. For the 2nd course, we had a long dish with 3 different samples of desserts -which I thought was just ok, not something unique to me. The 3rd course was just unacceptable to me -- It was a chocolate chip cookie the size of a quarter and a green tea chocolate the size of a Starburst candy cut in half diagonally. The green tea chocolate was very rich and sweet and that deserves some credit but the mere size of the portion should not be called a "course"! This was very deceiving. When we finally got the check, we were charged for the teas ($9). The value of our miniature desserts was $60. Total was $69 which was all deducted due to the google offer BUT they charged us 20% gratuity on the $69! I reread my copy of the Google offer and NO WHERE does it say there was a mandatory gratuity charge of any percent. After they made us wait for 40mins before being seated while there were empty tables, they did not deserve a $14 tip. We also did not get the "take home" cakes as part of the offer, we got 2 chocolate chip cookies which were not earth shattering to me. I feel that I was still generous to leave a $10 tip for a meal that was worth maybe $30 for the both of us. And the entire time we were there, the "reserved" table for 4 was empty. I will not return to Kyotofu & the desserts are indeed overrated. I recommend Spot Dessert bar in St Marks where the desserts are fresh and the customer service is more friendly.

Came here on a Wednesday night to use my dessert tasting deal from Gilt City. I called an hour before to make a reservation as I didn't realize this was required when using the coupon. It's a tiny space of about 8-10 tables so I would definitely recommend doing so. (Side note, Kyotofu has happy hour until 7 on some great sounding cocktails!). The dessert tasting consisted of the following: 1) Sparkling Sake: This was my first time trying this and it was delicious, tasted like sparkling apple cider just a bit less sweet. 2 ) Chocolate cupcake: one of the best cupcakes I've had in nyc! Reminds of those small molten chocolate cakes, but instead of a liquidy center it tastes like it is almost spread throughout the cupcake just a bit thicker. ? 3) Green tea cr¨¨me brulee: this was good to try but not really something I would eat a whole serving of on my own. 4) Chocolate on a stick: We got three of these each! One would have definitely been enough. Again, something worth trying but not really something I would order again a la carte. 5) Sweet potato dessert: this was my favorite of the bunch, between a doughnut and a cake and it came with a delicious small scoop of ice cream. There was also one additional dessert but couldn't quite catch the name of it. It had a fig/red bean flavor. Also received two of the cupcakes to go with the sampler and some small cookies/madeleines with the bill!

The sake bar of my legends, Kyotofu, you rock. Not much more needs to be said, except i was determined to come back here for a second-go a year later (I'm from California), and, when I found out they had seating in the back, I nearly flipped out.

Surprisingly, I enjoyed this type of Japanese desserts more than the ones at Cha-An. ?Kyotofu desserts are more gelatinous. ? We got the black sesame dessert with the passionfruit greentea cheesecake. ? I enjoyed walking past the kitchen before going into the seating area. At the end of our dessert excursion, we were given three tiny bites of green tea sponge cake type of dessert with our bill. Would love to see my creative variety in the future. I asked the hostess and it looks like they might venture to San Francisco.

They get three stars simply for having vegan ice cream in midtown. I've only gone for vegan dessert. ?A to-go order of their rotating flavors of soft-serve is a great deal. ?When you eat in, it comes all fancy like and costs a few dollars more. ?I've also had their signature sweet tofu (ask which desserts are vegan), and found it to be unexpectedly yummy, if not more than a bit unusual. ?Presentation is exceptional. Other than that, it's kind of an odd place. ?They are a "Dessert Bar & Bakery", but they have a full dinner and drink menu and an almost hidden dining room. ? Tip: go for their signature drink, "The Kyotofu".

We came here on a Wednesday night for dinner and ordered the Sakura Prix Fixe Dinner Special. ?It starts off with the warm Japanese mushroom salad. ?The "entree's" were the barbequed unagi, arancini, red snapper nigiri, and one(!) chicken & tofu slider. ?You had your choice of dessert. ?I forget what the choices are but we went with the chocolate souffle cupcake. ?All of this was for $28. The salad was good (but it's just a salad so how good can it be? ?I guess that's another topic altogether.) ?The only thing I really enjoyed out of the four entree's was the barbequed unagi. ?I really like unagi and phyllo dough is great so put them together, how can you go wrong? ?Everything else was prepared nicely but the taste just didn't blow me away. ?The dessert was very disappointing so we decided to order the strawberry sweet tofu which was good. The place is small and I guess it's more like a tapas restaurant (at least for dinner). ?I wouldn't come back here for dinner again or look to satisfy any kind of huge hunger but I would come back to try their desserts....

Love ... Love love the desert here. Refreshing taste of a desert without the heavy sweetness of some western deserts. We were here for only desert but the slider look very appealing. Definitely will check out the other dishes next time. With a party of 3, we ordered the strawberry shortcake and the signature sweet tofu. Both are tofu desert. ? The signature was the better of the two as the strawberry sweetness seems to clash with the light tofu flavor. Great desert place to end dining out ~~! This place can count on seeing me every time I"m in the Big Apple.

I found out about this place at the 9th Ave International Food Festival last year. I saw the sign saying that their Chocolate Souffl¨¦ Cupcakes were voted as New York's Best Cupcake. ?After biting into that soft goodness, I became a believer!! I tried all their other cupcakes, and to be honest, I wasn't impressed. However, whenever I'm in the neighborhood, I always have to get a Chocolate Souffl¨¦ Cupcake - DELICIOUS!! Ever since then, I've always wanted to eat there, but the prices kept me from doing so. ?However, last year, I wanted to go somewhere special for my birthday, so finally I went. The food was small, delicate and delicious. ?I remember we ordered the sampler meal, and the item that I enjoyed was the chicken/tofu sliders. However, my absolute favorites (and the most memorable) were the black sesame tofu (WOW!!!) and the Hou Hou Shu Okayama champagne-like saki (OMG!!!!!!!). Our server was really polite, and she took the time answer any questions we had. ?Our bill went well over $100, but for my birthday, it really made the occasion memorable. ?I plan to come back to try the other desserts and most of all, that champagne-like saki!!

I would have loved to sit down and explore the interesting creations from their menu. However, we didn't have much time and had to order take-out. ?In addition, it was hard to find this place on a dark night when their restaurant name is not visible from the street until you walk up to their door. Anyways, I rushed in and ordered whatever I had remembered reading about ?- their signature tofus. Both of their tofus, the black sesame sweet tofu with hoji-cha roasted green tea syrup and the signature sweet tofu with kuromitsu black sugar syrup were delicious and unique in their own way. I can't describe it's delicate taste. You must go try it yourself!

What a perfect place for dessert. ?We had the chef's three course dessert tasting, which was $17. ?It included: - signature sweet tofu - THE BEST ON THE MENU; I bought an extra order to bring home - warm miso chocolate cake - matcha green tea creme brulee - matcha green tea chocolate - some sort of azuki red bean cake with raspberries and blackberries Everything was absolutely delicious and so, so light. ?I didn't feel guilty at all walking out of this place and can't wait to go again, especially to try their dinner menu.

Good dessert, decent price, good presentation. Service is above average and you are well-tended. Everything just goes together well in the restaurant. The well-presented desserts, soft-mattress pad-like seats, dim candle-lit room. Good place to go with friends and to take a date (be warned that you will probably wait a bit to be seated on a weekend). Their cherry blossom (I may be saying this wrong) sake was very good. Smooth, floral taste. Mac n Cheese was the only thing that didn't make my taste buds dance. Didn't have a lot of flavor to it. Otherwise, the mini-chicken balls were amazing. We let the waitress know that it was our friends' birthday and they came out with a nice small cake and candle. + points there. Happy place.

Five stars for the desserts. The cooked food is good not on the same level as the desserts. ?The sakes are a step up in quality(and price) from your ordinary sushi house or izakaya but is worth it. ?Definitely would recommend the sake pairings with the desserts! The place is trendy looking and is not a place I would walk in to from the looks of it but I'm glad I did. ?A perfect place for a drink and dessert after a show late at night.

Kyotofu is an original and delicious brunch option. Come for the shiitake quiche or toad-in-a-hole, and take some green tea cookies to go. All the dishes were well prepared, tasty, and highly original for a small brunch joint. I especially enjoyed a mac-and-cheese as a main course and the black sesame tofu for dessert. The speed of service would befit more a fine restaurant, though to be fair it is a small kitchen serving complex food. Nonetheless, the belly expects brunch to be up in 10 minutes tops. I also had at Kyotofu the rare experience of leaving hungry, as the portions appeared sized for the demure Japanese waitresses serving us and not bear-like midwesterners. Neither of these small complaints should deter the curious foodie from this unique Hell's Kitchen outpost. I would come back to Kyotofu, especially if I lived in the same time zone....

It's not bad at all, but considering the surrounding area and the all-star lineup of restaurants on this stretch of 9th Avenue, I'd say it can't get more than 3.5 stars. The food tastes all right although the portions won't always fill you up. I believe that if the portions are going to be small the food needs to be absolutely exquisite. It wasn't quite that good. However, they have this black sesame pudding thing for dessert that I thoroughly enjoy. It's not going to be your daily choice for dinner, but a visit every couple of months will keep you happy with this place.

A friend and I came here after we read about the intriguing restaurant concept. They had a great selection of dinner entrees, but of course, it is the desserts that this place seems to be known for. I love the creative artistry that went into making these dishes. For dinner, I got the barbecued unagi, which comes with teriyaki sauce and is wrapped in crispy baked phyllo dough. It was beautiful and it was delicious. My friend's sake macaroni and cheese looked divine as well. Then came time for dessert, and they looked like beautiful works of art as well as being absolutely heavenly. I got the white sesame cake with banana sorbet and my friend got the warm miso chocolate cake. We tried a little of each other's desserts, and both were absolute bliss. The cakes were moist and had the perfect level of sweetness (sweet without being too sweet). Well worth the wait and the price. (See my photos)

This place was hard to find, but i believe it was worth the adventure. We did take-out because the wait was two hours long. The desserts here were just perfect. not too sweet and not too bland either. I loved the chestnut cupcake and the matcha cupcake and the sweet popo cake too. the sweet tofu was silky and loved the sweetness. I personally just like the original flavor but my brother and his girlfriend love the black sesame tofu.I think it has a more adult like taste. nevertheless, kyotofu is my favorite dessert place in nyc

Delicious tofu-based desserts! I went for weekend brunch and was pleasantly surprised by their selection. I got the chef's selection which came with a variety of mini everythings! The chicken tofu slider was perfectly seasoned and the texture never gave away that it was part tofu. Paired with a pickled cucumber the two bites were heavenly! The pork belly was tender and just the right amount of salty. I was a little less impressed with the firm tofu that came with a well-seasoned pat of rice. My friend got the toad in a hole, a truffle oil poached egg in thick toast, and it was pretty yummy as well. Bread was crisp and still warm, perfect for dipping into the funny yolk! Each entree comes with your choice of bellini mimosa or bloody Mary. Nothing too remarkable about those! Onto desserts! DELICIOUS tofu based black sesame sundae served with cookie crumbs fruit and green tea mochi. Delicious! And the ginger creme brulee! Just the right amount of sweet with a perfect gjnger kick at the end. It's a seasonal special so stop by! Reasonable prices for nyc.

Moving from the good to not so good another stop on my trip would be Kyotofu - a visit prompted by their previously being named "New York's Best Cupcake" by New York Magazine - a distinction I found hard to believe considering they ship these cupcakes all over the country as well as to Dean & Deluca, and a distinction I guess I'll never be able to judge considering that when I got there they were completely sold of their cupcakes and no longer making more (despite it being only 5pm) due to "a large order for a private function" thus relegating me to two muffins - one a dry and grassy "Matcha Blueberry" and the other a slightly better but rather dull and chewy "Apple Cinnamon" - both of which I can only assume had been baked that morning because to assume otherwise and think they were fresh is...well...unthinkable.

I am ADDICTED to this place. Its a really cute candle lit hip hole in the wall when phenomenal desserts which are not pricey. Its a nice "date" place to grab a dessert dish at which are very creative and excellent quality. I have been here in groups and it is still comfortable. I eat their black sesame tofu at least 3 times a week (its getting to be problem, I get withdrawals). The actual lunch and dinner options are not extensive but tasty. Again not pricey but not really memorable. It is really the desserts you come here for. I highly recommend!!

We never went for dinner, always just for dessert but it's sooo good!!!! ?so far my favorite is still the green tea creme brulee, we also had the miso chocolate cake, the sorbet ( which the raspberry was so sour we were making crazy faces all night ) the soy ice cream, and something which i forgot what it's call.. but it had a lot of red beans in it.. anit.... something ( sorry) . the wait is always long, but so worth it.

Yummm this may be my new favorite dessert spot in the city! ?The place is small and cozy, and the desserts are cute, delicious, and unique. ? I skipped dinner anticipating the dessert here, and it was worth it. ?My sisters and I each ordered one to share - the chocolate mochi cake, sweet potato cheesecake, and the black sesame tofu. ? -The sweet potato cheesecake doesn't taste like cheesecake but has that thick consistency. ?It's really great b/c it's not too sweet! -The black sesame tofu was both my sisters' favorite. ?It's not too sweet and the tofu is silky and rich. ?I'm a big fan of any black sesame desserts (mm like the black sesame ice cream at Sobaya..) but this one is a unique little treat! ?If you're a fan of the taiwanese dessert "douhua" you will definitely love this one. ? -The mochi chocolate cake is like a regular chocolate souffle - get it if you're a chocolate lover! ?It was a bit too sweet for my taste, and also the least unique out of the other desserts we ordered. Also, sake sunday is great!! ?We got a bottle of the dessert sake (the riesling of the sakes, originally $40) which I drank most of since both my sisters don't drink much. ?I like it a lot more than a regular moscato with my desserts.

Having lived in Hell's Kitchen for 4 years, I was always on the lookout for new restaurants. Witnessing the "culinary renaissance" from 2003-2007 on 9th avenue was quite an experience. It seemed as though everyday there would be a new restaurant or bar popping up around the corner. Some would last only a couple of months, others seemed destined to stay. Kyotofu thankfully seems to be falling into the latter category. After opening in 2006- 3 years later they are still going strong. Opened by an ex-JP Morgan investment banker, Kyotofu looks very similar to Chikalicious downtown. That's not a coincidence. The owner hired the same architects as the famed east village dessert bar to create a similar ambiance - simple, elegant...and most of all a feeling of "fresh and so clean." White space abounds the tiny space - and it is tiny. On a Friday night, plan on waits exceeding 30-40 minutes if you want a spot inside, or better yet just grab a seat at the window counter for some awesome people watching. That's more my style. I started off my meal with a "Japanese soda" - you know, the sodas with the marble inside? Somewhat of a throwback to childhood days... Desserts are a mix between fanciful and simple. Signature desserts include their sweet tofu and the black sesame tofu. While they may appear exotic to the western taste buds - these are traditional desserts easily found down in Chinatown for a fraction of the price. No matter, they are served exquisitely in "riedel" type glasses - and afterall, aren't we paying a premium to have it here and not in Chinatown? I'm okay with that. The soymilk soft ice cream sundae was a delight - chocolate and vanilla swirl with a kuromitsu whipped cream, mixed berry compote and matcha mochi. Kyotofu also serves a light appetizer menu including a japanese panko crusted mac'n'cheese and "pigs in a duvet" - berkshire pork sausage wrapped in a puff pastry. Kyotofu also has a bakery serving up award-winning cupcakes- specialty being a chocolate souffle cupcake, homemade cookies, brownies and macaroons. Kyotofu is reasonably priced, but they get you on the alcohol - doesn't everyone? A bountiful list of sakes and cocktails can easily push the check for two to north of $80.

Japanese Tapas. Fun dishes, great for sharing. Consider getting the 8 dish sampler, so that you can taste a little of everything. The tofu dip (one pecan, one edamame, one wasabe) brings tofu to life with flavor - also great for sharing. Cozy cute atmosphere, with excellent dessert selection. The green tea cheesecake may be small, but is packed with flavor and comes perfectly combined with a citrus-flavored honey drizzle. Their ice cream is very tasty too. You wouldn't even know it's soy based.

Yes, it's good but it's fuggin loud if you're seated toward the back. You can overhear everyone's conversations cause it's small. ?I could barely hear my date who sat across from me. And I could overhear the couple on a blind date right next to us and a group reunion on the other side of us. ? Otherwise, I did like the dessert. I would really suggest the Green Tea creme brulee if you like green tea; the green tea fudge, not so much. The okara cookies were surprisingly very good; it was soft and the icing was nice. The chocolate souffle cupcake, if you can call it a cupcake since it comes with no frosting, was really rich and nice....but my favorite cupcakes are still from Georgetown Cupcakes and Big Man Bakes in LA. Macaroons were good but I'd still go for the Okara cookies on my next visit.

I've taken many trips to New York since I am a student nearby. ?But this time I had 5 days. So basically me and my friend went on a 5-day food run. Out of all the dessert and food places that I went to, this place was the most unique, classy, and not to mention completely gratifying dessert run at 11pm. I mention unique because it combines traditional french and other cuisines with a japanese touch to it. We decided to get the prix frixe dessert so we could sample a variety of their desserts. They gave us desserts in succession to ready our palate from light to creamy. 1. sweet tofu I gave this one a lot of time on my tongue. It had a very silky texture and a light after taste. It was topped with their kuromitsu syrup. 2. matcha green tea cr¨¨me br?l¨¦e, warm miso chocolate cake, rhubarb strawberry cobbler cake We started with the cr¨¨me br?l¨¦e. I don't know if it has the same texture of the french version because I've tried many cr¨¨me br?l¨¦e's, and they've all tasted and felt different. However, it had a good hard caramel that blended well with the matcha green tea flavor. It was my favorite of the 3. The miso chocolate cake was the most ingenious out of the 3 though. Their saikyo miso caramel was a great complement to the rich and thick texture of the cake. They paired it with mochi and some kind of thin seasoned cracker which all worked well together. I'm not a fan of rhubarb but the cake part is always good :) 3. Green Tea Nama Chocolate Wow.. I didn't even know what this was because it felt and screamed ice cream but it had a thicker and creamier consistency that ice cream doesn't have. I found out later it was fudge. Oh my. good.ness. I'm glad I took my time eating the tiny piece because it had so much she-bang in each nibble I took. I would definitely come here again for the desserts but the dinner menu looked equally delectable.

Kyotofu has a great selection of vegan AND gluten-free desserts. There is a delicious dessert comprised of sweet silken tofu that is very much like a custard or flan (sans egg, of course). I had a gluten-free almond cupcake (no frosting) which was good and not too sweet. They have vegan soft serve as well! I'd really like to try their food menu but the restaurant is so small and packed that I'm not sure how you'd ever get in without a reservation.

Get the warm miso chocolate thing for app. There's this warm choclate cake, with this green tea mush on the side, and two dollops of white miso on the side. Eat all of these together in one bite and you in for an amazing trip of sweet, salty, and umami. It was great! ?Everything else I got, was OK / nothing special, but might have been because I was with a ?group and didn't look at the menu. The silk tofu salad was ok, as was the Berkshire sausage wrapped wiener thing. The other dessert items was this sweet tofu dish, that was good. Judging from how good the warm miso chocolate thing was, I'd say they have other good dishes. Deff a great spot to go to after dinner/drinks for some dessert. Ya know, on those nights when you kinda don't know what else to do, but must do something. The warm miso chocolate thingy ios certainly 5 stars worthy, however the tofo/salad is about 2 stars ?(the greens were pointless to me) and the wrapped sausage was 3 stars. Sweet tofu dish... 4 stars. ?So that averages out to 3.5, and I will round down because the tofu salad and sausage were let downs to me. ?I do want to go back however, and try more food, because I think this place could be worthy of 4-5 stars.

Five stars because their matcha green tea cupcake is hands down my favorite cupcake in all of New York. ?The place just smells delicious too. My favorite is the sake mac 'n cheese, but I haven't been disappointed with the other apps and entrees. Beware: Even though this place doubles as a restaurant, it is technically a bakery, meaning they're closed on Mondays. ?I found this out the sad way :(

Love the soymilk soft ice-cream in Kyotofu! Every time we are around the area we would stop by this place for the ice-cream. Kyotofu offers two daily flavors, and so far our favorites are roasted green tea and mint; as for the toppings we like kitromisu (whipped cream made with brown sugar) and mixed berry compote. We also love tofu cheesecake and sweet tofu besides the ice-cream. However, savory dishes are just so-so. We tried once, and found the dinner was not as impressive as desserts. Side note: One of our friends does not like desserts at all because he thinks desserts are too sweet. We brought him there, and he actually liked Kyotofu.

I've been here twice. Fair warning, I haven't tried their bakery goods or dinner, so rating on the following: Sake: Lengthy list, and I'm no pro. Three of us shared a bottle recommended by our waitress (sorry, can't remember the name! Not sure if I could even spell it correctly if I did). The guys I went with, who had spent a summer in Japan, said it was pretty legit. I thought it was really good, meaning it didn't like FEET like sake usually does. Dessert: Well this is just cool. Who knew tofu could turn into THAT? Strawberry shortcake and raspberry lychee were just ok. But the sorbet and signature tofu-custard thing are amazing. I think they removed the Jasmine one from the menu, so Black sesame for the win! +1 star for ambiance. It feels like you're in a modern, dimly lit beehive. Wasn't crowded, waited less than 5 min for a table (10pm on a Saturday). Each dessert dish is about $9 pre-tip/tax, but you can definitely share (3 for 4 people was perfect).

Visiting New York, my friends and I decided to try out Kyotofu at the suggestion of a local. They had a nice color chalkboard sign outside showing the specials of the day. The ambiance was quiet - with the simple and classic styling. I liked the darkwood furnishing contrasting the cream colored upholstering. While not brightly lit, I wouldn't describe it as dim. The food was unique, with bold flavors and intriguing textures. The tofu with black sesame was warm and delicious on the cold day. I enjoyed the green tea cake - velvety smooth with a nice balance of sweetness against the matcha. The chocolate brownie was a bit small - nice, dense, moist. Delicious! Their chocolate souffle was my favorite (of what I ordered). Chocolate lovers don't be shy!

I really didn't want to write a nasty review but I've never experienced such horrible service in my life before. I went in and no one approached me at all. Both workers looked at me and turned away. ?I was standing there for about 10 minutes before one of them asked me what I needed. ?There was no line either. ?Despite their bad service, the dessert I have to admit is pretty good. ?The green tea creme brulee is pretty bomb. ?However, the service definitely bothered me the entire night. In addition to the poor service from the workers, they allowed a homeless man to come into the place and ask for money. ?How could they even let someone come all the way to the back of the restaurant without stopping them? ?I could not believe it. ?The man came up to me and begged for money. ?The worker was laughing and just pulled him away. ?I'm sorry I cannot give this place more than two stars. ?If the service was better, it would have gotten 5 stars for their dessert. ?Just a heads up guys.. your taste buds will be satisfied but don't expect to be treated well here.

Kyotofu is a walk from the subway, but the calorie-burning jaunt back to the R train will allay the guilt some people may feel from the indulgent desserts offered at this yummy little establishment. My friends and I shared three desserts (the menu apparently changes seasonally): the sweet potato cake, warm miso chocolate cake, and the soy milk soft ice cream sundae. ?Don't let the "miso" or "soy milk" fool you; [for that matter, don't be deceived by the name "Kyotofu," either]; There is nothing healthy-tasting about the desserts here (Kyotofu doesn't provide nutritional info, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say that the treats here aren't all that healthful.) ? The sweet potato cake might have been my favorite of the desserts; the texture of the cake is a little like fluffed sweet potato, with a hint of ginger and other spices. ?Served on the side is a helping of "sweet potato caramel," which was buttery with the consistency of pureed veggie. ?The whole dish is not overly sweet, so it's good if you want dessert but don't have a big sweet tooth. My friends really enjoyed the sundae. ?The ice cream itself rich without being overly so. ?It's served with brownies to be sprinkled over the top; the brownies add a nice crumbly texture along with the chocolatey goodness. ?It also comes with a fruit compote; ours was raspberry (full of raspberry jam, sweet-tart flavor, but with a thinner consistency.) Like just about all of these Manhattan dessert places, seating is LIMITED, so be prepared for a little wait, esp if you go during peak dessert time. ?The ambiance is trendy (low lighting, very clean lines). ? ? OH! And I almost forgot. ?I also had the silky tofu salad. ?I didn't taste the yuzu in the yuzu-miso dressing,but the tofu was so soft and delicate that I didn't mind. ?It almost melts on your tongue. ?There are also beets in the salad, I have to say of the three beet salads I've had this week (including one at Perilla), these beets were best: sweet, mildly juicy, with a bold, earthy flavor. Come here if you have a chance!

Amazing food - highly recommended! ?A tiny cozy place with small cheap dishes (you usually order 2-3 at once to share) and ungodly delicious desserts. ?Great place for dates! The grilled eel pockets and green tea creme brulee are a must! ?I've had green tea creme brulee at over 5 places and this is, by far, the best one. Seating can be tough if you do not have reservations and this place could use another waiter during dinner time. ?Otherwise, I would give this place a 5 star rating =)

Hubby and I were looking for dessert after we saw the Lion King on Broadway and this 4 star place showed up on my Yelp. We were seated at the bar around 10 pm and ordered prix fixe dessert for 2 people for $28 *House sweet tofu: silky texture, ?not too sweet, gingery sauce, yummy *Trio of rice pudding, green tea creme brulee, chocolate cake ~Rice pudding: the rice has sticky texture, pear sauce was fruity and not too sweet, overall pretty good ~Green tea creme brulee was mind blowingly good! Strong matcha flavor creamy smooth texture not too sweet, it's my absolute favorite among the trio! Highly recommended! ~Chocolate cake with miso sauce: strong chocolate flavor, texture wise not too dense, sweetness of the cake combined with savory (salty) miso sauce makes an interesting pair, delightful experience for my taste buds. Second best after matcha creme brulee, just because I am not into chocolate as much as I love green tea :) *Almond macaroon with green tea chocolate ~Almond macaron was chewy, hubby liked it but I didn't. I had better macaron before ~Green tea chocolate was yummy, strong green tea flavor with the right sweetness level They gave us 2 green tea financiers at the end, which were chewy so I didn't quite like it. Hubby liked the chewy texture though. 1 star down for service, since I think it could be better. We have to flag down the waiter to refill our water glasses, instead of having them refilled before we even asked for it! We will be back for dessert!

My friend was uber excited to come here and try everything. He was practically drooling when we came in and saw some of their baked goods in their display case. We came mid-afternoon so it wasn't busy. But the place looked really small too. Our waiter was cool, answering any questions and explaining stuff when he brought it out. He seemed like a struggling actor type. Haha. I followed other yelpers and got the green tea cr¨¨me brulee. My other friends got the dessert sampler and the chef's selection with 5 items. I really liked my cr¨¨me brulee. The green tea flavor is subtle and it's different than other cr¨¨me brulee's I've had. Also it's not overly sweet so I had no problem eating the whole thing. I got to try some of friend's snacks. The green tea chocolate/fudge is super strong with green tea flavor. The cookie ?supposedly had green tea but tasted like a regular chocolate chip cookie and it was kinda hard almost bordering on stale. I think my homemade ones are better. The shortbread cookies had unique flavors - ginger and sesame but nothing too spectacular about it. I did kinda like the miso chocolate cake but the miso wasn't very prevalent in flavor and it kinda tasted like the brownie bites you could get at Costco. This place is pricey overall too. My cr¨¨me brulee was $9. I think with all these reviews I saw expecting a fabulous dessert place but it was just ok. I did enjoy my cr¨¨me brulee though.

my friend and i came over for dinner. the wait for food was miserable, we waited like 40+ minutes for our food (after seated and ordered). we tried the pre fixe dinner. lots of variety, ridiculously small portion, grossly over priced. the sweet tofu dessert was good. one extra star for that. the sweet potato cake was ok, but nothing more special than grocery store zucchini/carrot cakes. the service was terrible. the waitress ignored us the whole time, we had to wave 6 or 7 times for someone to answer. and they weren't even busy. and it's not like the waitress didn't see us. it was out right neglect. frankly she deserved zero tip, but it was friday night and i didn't feel like being a bitch, unlike certain someone. honestly the place deserves maybe 3.5 stars if not for the bad service, and maybe 4 stars if service was good. i am no stranger to fine dining and i'm used to paying elevated price for a good dining experience. but seriously, aren't pricier place supposed to come with better service?! this kind of service is an insult. i am only giving it a 2 star cuz i really liked the sweet tofu. might come back for the dessert in the future, if i can get over the unpleasant dining experience from this time.

While the desserts arrived on pretty plates, they tasted like dogfood. In the back room, with a mere few tables it took 20 minutes to take an order, 30 minutes to deliver the nicely arranged gruel and 20 minutes to deliver the check after request. During that time, we were subjected to a treble heavy stereo system playing unrecognizable music at increasingly high volumes, howling tables trying earnestly to be heard over the noise and the residual effect of these competing high-pitched repeatedly bouncing off the walls of the oddly shaped and un-sound-damped room. Screaming at full volume from across a tiny table, I was unable to hear or be heard by my wife. The sweetest part of the meal was leaving. I felt mercilessly violated in my ears and my mouth in a horrible way. I left with a headache and a head full of bad memories. Dick Cheney should have visited kyotofu before designing his own torture chambers. An awful, awful experience. Possibly the worst dining out experience I have had in a decade. I guess Kytofu could be well liked by vegans or the severely lactose intolerant given their limited choices. However, if I were merely lactose intolerant I would consider other options and a roll of Charmin.

A great little trendy Japanese dessert place to take your dates to in Manhattan. The atmosphere and ambiance was lightly dimmed and secluded. Not many seats, so may be a problem to get a table. What was ordered: 3 dessert tasting menu During that night received the sweet tofu, strawberry rubar, green tea creme brulee, a fudge dessert and green tea chocolate. Overall, all the desserts were very good some better than others. My favorite was the green tea creme brulee and the strawberry rubar. ? Service was a bit slow probably due to the place being packed. If you are a fan of japanese style desserts, a place to definitely try while in NYC.

The tiny restaurant located in the middle of Manhattan has a very appreciable modern architecture. ?The interior is sectioned off into two sides by a large white wall. ?Actually, all the walls are white. ?This would seem kind of bland when I describe it, but this design fares well with the candle lighting! ?There is not much seating in this restaurant. ?They have these huge cushioned seating for its customers, which give the place a nice comfy homey feeling. ? Their deserts are so different! ?They have this sesame ice cream... which literally makes you swoon as soon as it touches your tongue. ?Their chocolate lava cake is very creamy, milky and dark... the best part is that they top with off with this melted green tea mochi that is surprisingly the best addition to chocolate cake I think has ever been invented. ?I'm serious... go there for the mochi. ?I know they are famous for their cupcakes, which I agree are quite good, but seriously... the melted mochi is something you can't find elsewhere =) ? Come here for desserts with friends after dinner! ?I promise you, it'll be a real treat =D

Came here one day sometime last year with friends. ?The design of the website and the photos of description of food intrigued us, as well as "NYC's best cupcake". ? There were a lot of mixed feelings among our group about the food. First off...when you choose between soup or salad, ABSOLUTELY AVOID THE SALAD. ?According to my three friends (there were six of us) who chose the salad, it was very bitter and tasteless, and the dressing was not enough to make it even barely tolerable. The Kabocha soup, which one of my other friends and I chose, was very delicious. Now for the main courses, again mixed feelings. ?Two of my friends who chose the salad from hell got the chicken tofu burgers. ?They didn't like it very much and felt it was too saucy and had too much sake. ?I had some of their burgers (cause I was too poor so had the cheapest and not filling entree) and I felt the opposite. ?I thought the burgers were delicious and juicy. ?My other friend who chose the salad got the curry rice and said it was delicious. ?As for me and the other who chose the soup...well I was poor so I had the cocktail wieners, so nothing special, though the mustard was pretty good and had a nice kick to it. My friend had the sake infused mac and cheese, which was a pretty good mac and cheese, and well what do you know? ?That entree came with its own salad...which was a different salad from the one you could get instead of the soup and according to her, it was tasty. ? Now my other friend (remember there were six of us) just got dessert, and decided to try the cupcake that the place is apparently known for. ?So after he ate it, I asked for his opinion on it, which got me disappointed. ?He said it was ok, but I wasn't sure how to take that, so I asked him to compare that cupcake and a Betty Crocker/Pillsbury cupcake from a cake mix box on a scale of 1-10. ?He put the cakemix cupcake on a 5, and Kyotofu's cupcake on a 6. ?Talk about disappointment (And trust me, we do enjoy cakemix cupcakes. ?The fact he would rate it so low means he has tasted really better cupcakes elsewhere). We were supposed to have dessert here too but, my two friends who had an unsatisfying experience altogether from the salad and entrees didn't want to try anymore. ?I was already disappointed from my friend's cupcake review, so we left. ? Still, I will come back here, with the friends who did enjoy it and loved it here. ?I won't try the cupcake after that review, but I will try their other desserts. ?So, once I do, I shall update. --------------------------------------------------?------------------ My delicious blog!!

Had take out deserts from Kyotofu on valentines day and was very impressed. I tried a chocolate chip cookie, a dark chocolate brownie, a chocolate cupcake made from tofu, and a very interesting green tea cupcake. All of the desserts were delicious but the most unique and stand-out were the warm brownies and the green tea cupcakes. I was so impressed with how moist the treats were- nothing tasted dry and everything was very flavorful!

Alice in Dessertland - The Mad Cocktail Party (....that wasn't!) There were tables around the edges of the room as Alice entered it. The March Hare and the Hatter were having cocktails, a Dormouse was sitting between them, almost asleep. The March Hare looks at Alice: "I hope you aren't fussy! Here, have some wine." ? Alice, looking all around the table: "I am NOT fussy! But, I don't see any wine." ? The March Hare sneers: "Ha! Sarcasm is my superpower". ? The Dormouse opened his eyes wide on hearing this; "Why is yelp not a dating site?" I'm glad they've begun asking riddles, thought Alice. "I believe I can guess that". "Then you should say what you mean," the March Hare went on. "I do," Alice hastily replied; "at least I mean what I say--that's the same thing, you know" "Not the same thing a bit!" said the March Hare, "You might just as well say that Jelly is a Yokan, is the same thing as Yokan is a jelly" "You might as well say," added the Hatter, "A rich brownie is like Warm Chocolate Mochi Cake" is the same as "Warm Chocolate Mochi Cake is like a rich brownie!" "Ok. Ok. She gets it!" said the March Hare, and the conversation dropped. The party sat silent, while Alice tried to remember about yelp and dating sites, which wasn't much. The Hatter broke the silence. "Why do we eat chocolate based desserts at Kyotofu?" he said, turning to Alice. She considered a little, and said "Because they have chocolate." "Always optimistic!" sighed the Hatter. "I told you we should have passed on the Chocolate Souffle Cupcake!" he added, looking angrily at the March Hare. "It was the rated as The BEST Cupcake by NY Mag" the March Hare replied. "They must have chosen innovation over consistency", countered the Hatter. "What would you have ordered?" asked Alice. The Hatter licked his lips dreamily: "Toasted Walnut Tahitian Vanilla Parfait (semi-freddo topped with maple soy and mascarpone mousse), or the Tofu cheesecake (hint of Sansho Pepper with cream cheese on a black sesame cake crust and vanilla bean paste). "Not the Rice pudding?" asked the March Hare The Hatter: "I can't make up my mind on that! While the concept is great, the result often lacks a stronger flavor or a creamier texture". "The Dormouse is asleep again," said the March Hare, pouring Kyotofu upon its nose. The Dormouse says without opening its eyes, "Of course! Just, what I was going to say." "Have you guessed the riddle yet?" the March Hare said, turning to Alice again. "No, I give up," Alice replied: "what's the answer?" "I haven't the slightest idea," said the March Hare. ? Alice sighed wearily. "I think you might do something better with the time," she said, "than, waste it in asking riddles that have no answers." Hatter: "Suppose we change the subject, I vote the Dormouse tells us a story." "Once upon a time there were three sisters," the Dormouse began in a great hurry; "and their names were July, Joonie, and Mariatius; and they lived in a well..." "What did they live on?" said Alice, who always asked about eating and drinking. "They lived on Soju," said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or two. "They couldn't have done that, you know," Alice gently remarked; "they'd have been ill." "They would have been," said the Dormouse, "but they would leave the well just before 'Stupid Girls' made them ill." This puzzled Alice much, "But, what were the 'Stupid Girls' doing there?" The Dormouse thought about it, and said, "It was a Soju well.....with great acoustics" "There's no such thing!" Alice began very angrily, but the Dormouse sulkily remarked, "If you don't believe me, I will disappear and you'd have to finish the story yourself." "No, please go on!" Alice said humbly; "I won't interrupt again." The Dormouse continued, "And so these sisters--once they were out of the well they would draw." "What would they draw from the well?" said Alice. 'Soju?' "They were learning to draw," the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; "and they drew all manner of things--mostly things that begin with an H--"Hearts, Halloween costumes, Happy faces....." ? Alice could no longer bear the confusion: "This cocktail party makes NO sense! Your story confuses me, I can't decide between the HUGE cocktail menu, and the texture and flavors of many of the desserts perplex me!" ?She gets up and leaves the room. The Dormouse closes his eyes and thinks: Maybe, next time I should use a different format: hmmm, should I draw or do karaoke? The March Hare keeps drinking the Shibuya Martini, while The Hatter debates about eating the Black Sesame Sweet Tofu...

This place is a total clusterf*ck. I don't care that it was Valentine's Day. I don't care that there were 6 of us. I do care that I made a reservation for 6 and they said it was no problem accommodating our party in the back room and it turned into an utter clusterf*ck. If I had any reason to believe when I was making the reservation that they couldn't accommodate us, we would have happily taken our recessionary discretionary dollars elsewhere. This was the last stop of a 6-stop food fest on this day and it was the place that most of us were most looking forward to. We finished dinner early so we got there around 9:30, 30 minutes before our reservation time. I checked in with the host that we were there early and if we could be seated earlier that would be great and if not, that was fine, we knew we were early. He smiled and said there was a chance we could get seated earlier. The waiting area is also the cramped bar area. A few of us lucky ones were able to watch the kitchen through the glass and watch the pastry chef make the treats. 30 minutes passed by and I checked in again since it was our reservation time. They were working on the table and it would be a few more minutes. At 10:20 they said they couldn't get us in the back room yet they continued to seat parties of 2 who walked in without reservations. Our group was split up between the two bar counters opposite of each other. I was livid, Karman L. was a level of b*tch that I had never witnessed before. And it was awesome. Once seated, it took about 15 minutes for the waitress with a 'tude to even acknowledge that we were sitting there. And the stools at the bar are ridiculously uncomfortable and tiny. It could fit about one butt cheek of an Asian female's badonk - I don't know how the ample of derriere are going to do it. It took a great deal of balance and clenching to not fall off. We asked for waters that never came until we reminded the useless waitress. It was then realized at that point that Karman L. could give good stink eye. I did really enjoy my Strawberry Shortcake. It's served in a large glass - the shortcake is cubed, topped with tofu cream, a pureed strawberry sake sorbet and fresh strawberries. It was served with a tiny side of mango sorbet. A 4-star delight for sure. Many of the others' desserts had mixed reviews. Karman L. hated everything she got in the prix fixe menu but I'll let her detail her experience. I think the host was sincere and felt terrible about the situation. He comped us a soy milk soft serve sundae which was pretty good - the strawberry flavor was a hit with the group, while the chocolate flavor was underwhelming. The check came before Karman L.'s final course came and she was ready to unleash the fury. They were very apologetic but it was too little too late. The check comes with these wrapped mini-muffin treats and I guess the host saw or overheard our angry rumblings so he came by with several miso chocolate brownies to take home. (They were soft and fudgy when I had them the next day at home). It is highly unlikely that I will ever return to Kyotofu after this experience.

My first one-star review for 2009 is awarded to Kyotofu. ?I waited two weeks to write this review to see if I am still mad. ?Yes. I am still mad, therefore, I am still going to give it a one-star. How did that manage to get this one-star award? 1) Lack of customer service skills (including the host and the waitress) 2) Crappy seating at the bar 3) Not that spectacular dessert ------------------------- Date/Time: 2/14/2009 9:30pm-12am Party Size: 6 Objective: Enjoy some yummy dessert after a day of eating in NYC and the rave review of this place. ? -------------------------- 9:30 pm - Arrived early for our 10pm reservation. ?Checked in with host. ?He said he will check the back to see if he can sit us early. ?WONDERFUL! 9:50pm - We all just hung out around the door, checking out the food prep area through the open kitchen. ?Host said he's still working on the seating in the back. GREAT! 10:10pm - Host informed us that he can't sit us in the back (he tried his best.) ?He asked if we minded sitting at the bar. ?FINE! He then told us he had to split all of us up. ?Two at this corner first, two at that corner when those people leave, and two at that other corner when those people leave! ARE YOU SERIOUS!?!?!? ?I asked since we are all split up, can he sit two of friends (couple) in the back (I assume is more cozy and romantic!) ?Host said no, there's nothing in the back. FINE! 10:15pm - Overheard that the host brought two people to the back (they had a reservation at 10:30pm!) LIAR - No seat in the back!!! 10:20pm - We all finally sat down in the tiny seats at the bar, we asked for menu and water. ? (Menu and water came after 10-15 minutes). .....Everything after this point is a blurred....Don't remember the exact timing anymore... 10:50pm - Still no food for me yet...I ordered the prix-fixe 3-course desserts 11ish - Waitress brought me my "first course" - It should be the Sweet Tofu dessert (what they are famous for-what I came here for). ?Waitress said that they ran out of the Sweet Tofu dessert, so they decided to just randomly picked something out for me (miso choc something and a sesame something), w/out asking if it's okay to sub the sweet tofu dessert with w/ something else. ?I sent it back, cuz I can't have sesame. 11:30ish - Host comp us with a bowl of frozen yogurt for the wait. TOO LATE! ?My second course came at some point...Don't remember what it was...But it sure wasn't that good or memorable. 11:45ish - Went to check on my friends that were sitting at the other side of the bar! ?Came back to my seat and saw the check. ?WHERE IS MY 3RD COURSE?!? 12ish - Host said they forgot my 3rd course and he went and got it for me (that stupid frozen yogurt again!)!!! SERIOUSLY?? -------------------------------------------------- And this point...there still a line of people waiting....my friend was nice enough and got up to free up two seats. ?I was taking my sweet ass time to finish the stupid frozen yogurt that I don't even like. ------------------------------------------------- In summary: 1) Lack of customer service skills ? ?- Host - Don't take a reservation of 6 if you can't fit them on a busy day... ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?- Should have told us when we arrive that we have to all split up...pretty sure we could have sat down earlier. ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?- Don't rush me out of the door when it was your fault not able to manage your restaurant ? ? - Waitress - Bring menu and water in a timely manner when customer asked for them. ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?- Don't bring me random substitute food when what I ordered was not available. ?Please ask first. ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?- Bring all my courses out before giving me a bill. 2) Crappy seating at the bar ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? - Don't put extra seats at the bar in the walking path...extremely uncomfortable to sit.... ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? - Seats are too close together. ?Can't take jacket off, no where to put anything. ? 3) Not that spectacular dessert ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? - I don't consider putting pre-made dessert on a plate and pretty it up as good dessert.... --------------------------------------------------?---- Thanks for allowing me to experience your restaurant service. ?I will not return again and will inform others about my experience. ?Cheers.

I came home and saw the picture for this place, and it took me a minute to realize it really was the same place, because photograph makes it look like a space age room, a large one that too. It is a really elegant and classy restaurant, and it has the BEST bathroom ever. I would totally design my bathroom in the same way, though I'd certainly consider having a shower in mine as well, obvi. The place is rather intimate, we were lucky there wasn't a wait, as I've seen this place crowded in the past, in passing. Oh, if you are lucky, you'll be blessed with the opportunity to eavesdrop on two middle-aged women gossip about men and inappropriate coworkers. Unwanted babble can be fun on occasion, I think. Anywho, to the dessertness. So, I had a craving to indulge in something scrumptiously and delightfully rich, creamy, and fattening tonight. So I suggested Serendipity, which had a 2 hour wait (I bloody hell ain't doing that!), so Kyotofu was David's back up plan, and what a great one it was. As David mentioned, the portions are small, but worth it. My raspberry chocolate tofu cake or whatever it was called was absolutely yummy. The best part was that it was filling despite its size but not nauseatingly heavy. And honestly, anything with tofu makes me think it's healthy, so I'm sure could have had it for dinner and been okay with that. David's black sesame sweet white tofu concoction was not black in color as I had expected it to be, which was a slight disappointment, but then I realized that it was black sesame and not black tofu, so as per my second expectation, the sesame was black in color indeed, silly me. I liked that too. Drinks. I had one of their nigori sakes, and it was served cold, which was a first for me. I learned from David that high end sakes are served cold, which made me feel special and important, since was apparently drinking a high end sake. I am no sake aficionado but I'm sure they'd agree that this was really good, and STRONG as hell! The waku waku cocktail was totally rockin' too. Excellent service, a varied menu and a chic bathroom = pricey desserts. Oh well, but it did come highly recommended and one does have to pay for tiny portions and swanky bathrooms. But it really is totally worth it.

This place was a bit harder to find since the store name isn't written in the front, so remember the address. As I walked in, it didn't seem like there was any tables or chairs for people to sit. However later on, the waiter bought my friend and I inside and there were approximately 8 tables with chairs and 2 white cushion seats along the wall which gave it a nice clean modern design to it. As for the food, the french toast came with berries and sausage and a bit of powdered sugar on top. It was really yummy and the french toast is only available during the weekends!! The syrup was in a cute shot glass. The cha soba noodles was pretty good too- green tea soba!! =) You may kind of see that the soup has been out for awhile or has been in the refrigerator since of the particles in the soup. This may had decrease my rating for this place, but it is cold soba and the desserts were fantastic. The matcha green tea cr¨¨me br?l¨¦e was delicious and it had a rich moist green tea flavor in it. It came with raspberry sorbet and vanilla bean tuile & candied violets. Really yummy!! The raspberry tofu no bake cheesecake was alright. It came with raspberry sauce, cr¨¨me fra?che sorbet and almond florentine. It doesn't have a rich cheesecake flavor at all, instead you mostly just taste the raspberry flavor. The soymilk soft ice cream sundae was good too! Since it's made with soymilk, there wasn't really a vanilla taste to it. As for this, it came with summer berry compote, matcha mochi, brownie topping, chocolate pocky. The fruits weren't fresh, but the matcha mochi and brownie topping with the soymilk soft ice cream was delicious!! I would definitely recommend this place to my friends, but be prepare to waste some money if you want to try more desserts. =)

Got a silk tofu salad with yuzu dressing (forgot the exact name), and it was DELICIOUS! Also got a chef's assorted dessert (5), and the sweet potato cake. They were all delicious, but the desserts could get a bit pricey. Overall, a cute place with fairly light, tasty desserts.

Yay, hooray to knowing ppl who know the owner^_^ I noticed a clean and careful design and it was very comfortable to be sitting with friends here no matter if you are at the brighter front area or the darker back room. The displays of cookies, macaroons and puddings on the counter were quite appealing too! I had dinner here and shared the smoked salmon onigiri, the eel wrapped with philo and the pigs in a duvet (loved the name!) All were not bad indeed!...but ultimately we were here for dessert @_@. We ordered the kaiseki tasting dessert on the menu and it was soo yummy, also to think that they were made with TTTOFU was a little MINDBLOWING! The tofu pudding tasted like a real panna cotta, the sweet potato cheesecake was amazing, I really like the green tea brownie thingy, and I almost ceased to breathe after eating the rice pudding..mmmmm! Then as I thought how this could get better....well they brought out a soft hazelnut ice cream....OMG!!! That was sexy in every way!...all of which was on the house later. *_* We even got homemade macaroons for the road^_^ PERFECT! b/c I was going to a bday party later and had no idea what to bring my friend! I had the macaroons later, although they weren't top notch, there's nothing better than free ones! ?MUAH to the Mr. who owns this place! They sell their stuff online too! Check it out!

Kyotofu, Not sure if I like you. Don't be fooled by the vegan-sounding name since they do serve meats. They have an exotic selection of cocktails, desserts, & light Japanese treats. The front area is the dessert bar and bakery with the kitchen in full view, It is brightly lit with white wash walls and yellow hues. The steel stools facing the window do look uncomfortable and high, But it's a nice spot to sip cocktails and watch pedestrians go by. The back dining room has a more stylish and futuristic design. In spite of the soft music, it's not a romantic setting for couples to dine. The white benches are well padded and very comfortable, Service was somewhat slow but still hospitable. It's amazing how many tasty dishes they can create with tofu, Even though the portions from our Otsumami sampler were tiny and few. The Japanese-style Curry Risotto (Arancini) was a tasty wonder, But I'm disappointed by the measly 2-scoop blunder. The teriyaki grilled Chicken & Tofu Sliders were the size of 2 golf balls. After downing the both of them, he griped "Is that all!?" The trick (a.k.a. culinary conspiracy) that occasionally works, Is keeping us diners hungry enough to order their signature desserts. All are made with exotic Japanese ingredients that are seasonal. For such small portion sizes, the prices are ridiculously high & unreasonable. We loved the taste and texture of the Black Sesame Tofu. It was soft, sweet, and thick as goo. Another favorite of ours was the Warm Chocolate Mochi Cake. It was dark, runny, velvety, and lightly baked. Not sure if I liked the Matcha Green Tea Tofu Cheesecake, It was mousse-like in texture than typical cheesecake. After consuming everything, our stomachs were less than half full. I would have given them 4 stars if they'd put more food in the bowl.

Wow! ?My two friends and I almost decided to have dessert at the restaurant where we had dinner. ?That would have been a mistake. ?Instead, we went to Kyotofu. ?Three of us split two tasting menus. ?...and by that, I mean that I ate about a tasting menu and a half while two spectators tried desperately to get their forks in to get a bite. ?From start to finish, everything was excellent, but my personal favorite was the warm miso chocolate cake, which was absolutely decadent. ?Another highlight was the green tea creme brulee. ?I love creme brulee, but this was the first one that I can remember in which the custard was actually worthy of being paired with the caramelized top. ?The green tea chocolate was pretty awesome, too.

I came her for the soy soft-serve ice cream which I read about in mutliple publications. Being severely allergic to dairy, I have not had soft ice cream for a very long time and was excited to try this! They assured me it was vegan and totally dairy-free, but after one bite I ended up in the ER with an allergix reaction. I called Kyotofu and the owner said he would look into this, but I just want to warn others out there so no one else ends up getting sick.

Slightly pricey, and I don't like all its offerings equally, hence 4 stars. However, I do LOVE the black sesame tofu!!! It's a must-have. And if you're like me and don't like desserts that are too sweet, try it without the syrup -- the sweetness is JUST PERFECT and gives you a richer taste of the sesame. Absolutely fantastic.

Totally inconsistent, whether it be the quality of the menu, staff, atmosphere, etc. Having been there about 5 times after moving to the neighborhood, I thought that tis might be one of my regular places, being a vegan, and having heard some good things about the place before. apparently it used to be awesome from what my friends told me, but it has really gone downhill. I hate that my first choice in Hell's Kitchen was a bad one. Any other places around that are worth the trip? I'm having a hard time with this.

came here as recommended by a friend. ?we are bonded by our love for dessert and all things Japanese. was already stuffed, as tempted as i was by their small plates ... we restricted ourselves to dessert only. ?they have a pretty good pri-fixe menu if you're in the mood for both savory & sweet. kyotofu is extremely tiny. A few seats by the window where you can people watch. ?Or if you rather not, the rest of the seats ?are hidden and tucked past the kitchen, where by the way it's a bit more spacious, but not by much. first dessert was black sesame tofu with a side of overly sweet hoji-cha syrup. ?As you can imagine, tofu doesn't really have much taste unless you dress it up. ?However, the texture is creamy, velvety with a tint of tiny fine grains of black sesame. ?Black sesame is a very robust flavor, coupled with the tofu, made for a magnificent combo. ?To add a touch of sweetness, I poured a thin layer of the opaque hoji-cha syrup. ?By itself is very sweet and that's why it was an "aside". ?You get to decide the level of sweetness to the main dessert, which i thought was very clever. ? Of course, we didn't end up using the entire contents, it would have been too sweet for my own liking. ?this dish was good, but nothing that blew my mind. ?perhaps it was a bit too simple and boring for me, but it is something i'd definitely would want to eat in the future, but not necessarily crave. Onto the next course... the second dessert was my personal favorite. ? wherever pumpkin and bread pudding is involved.. i'm totally there. ?the roasted pecans were sticky sweet and carmelized nicely, the pumkin bread was moist with a firm bite and the ice cream paired it off nicely. ?Sweet, smooth, creamy, nutty, fluffy. ?the only problem i i had with this dish was that it was not enough. aside from the woman who kept eying my dessert, i really do like this place and will be back to try their savory small plates.

Kyotofu was great for desert something different than usual then the other desert place. A lot of their desert is made from tofu and soybean which is very healthy. The service is nice both the Japanese lady and American male. Their hot green tea was good. Smell good. Not like your usual green tea from starbuck or other Asian places. In the front of the place there is open space good for chatting...but in the back is bit tight but romantic with candle lights.....I love the green tea ice cream wow especially they have pairing with sparkling sake which made the desert more tasteful. This is one of a kind you can never find it else where. The decoration of plates and food is unique ....cute......and upscale......if you go there bring a hot date...both of you will enjoy with a smile afterwards. .....:)

I've heard raving reviews about this place and man, were they right! So i've never actually had a meal here, but rather came here for dessert after a meal, but since they are better known for their desserts, why not. well first, the location... it took some looking to locate it. It's located in an extremely small nondescript area of hell's kitchen squeezed between two much larger and flashier looking restaurants. If you weren't looking, you would walk right by it without noticing. Second, the line was crazy and the waiting space was tiny. So I squeezed in the space with my party waiting for a table. Luckily, they had a table for 4 ready just then and since we were the only table of 4 we started eating fairly quickly. Next, the food... Seriously amazing. I had the black sesame sweet tofu and it's one of the best black sesame-based deserts I've tasted all around, and that's including those in Japan. It's very light and there's a very faint sweetness to it. Loved it! Also, the soy--based ice-cream was pretty good as well. Very unique and it had a different flavor to it than what regular milk-based ice-cream tasted like, but I enjoyed it very much. Totally coming back here when I visit NYC again

Confessions of a "Kyotofu-holic" This is going to sound disturbing, but I've been dreaming about Kyotofu A LOT lately. ?What used to haunt me at night has now crept its way into my daytime activities. ?I find myself salivating at the thought of their savory mini-tofu sliders w/ wasabi sauce as I hack away at financials--even a basic dish like mac & cheese has got my mind wandering. ?Each visit is like falling in love (slowly), not blow-your-mind love at first sight, but rather each comforting bite sneaks up on you; then you find yourself where I'm at -- smitten. This is either a really serious crush or just a passing curiosity, but I find my visits becoming more and more frequent. Gone are the neighborhood Thai restaurants, bakeries, and wine bars I frequent at HK. ?Even when I tell myself "Okay, I will ONLY come here later for dessert", I find myself two swift blocks later, at a cozy corner table of Kyotofu nibbling at their dinner treats. There's something about nibbling at miniature versions of would-be favorite entrees that screams "tease" and makes you abandon the grown-up size versions of the same dishes from nearby Eatery. You tell yourself it's better because tofu/soy is incorporated the menu. Then there are the desserts--they have a "tasting menu" so aptly named to get you hooked and wanting more. ?But alas, you only come here for fork-wrestling and "conversation" with friends or a special someone, while your greedy inner-4 year old is really screaming "No, I don't want to share!" in your head. ?Cruel, very cruel indeed. Recommended: Food: ?chicken & tofu sliders, mac & cheese, japanese curry puffs (it was just ok), & smoked salmon onigiri Dessert: ?If you can only get one dessert, get the soymilk soft ice cream w/mochi and mixed berries (omg); otherwise, I suggest getting the Kaiseiki 3-course sampler ($17). ?The warm miso chocolate cake, the signature sweet tofu, pumpkin tofu cheesecake, and the strawberry shortcake are all good. Drinks: ?Thoroughly enjoyed the Kira Kira (sparkling sake & blackberry puree) and the spiked hot apple cider (surprisingly good). ?My friends loved their chocolatinis. They also have good port & sake to pair with desserts :) GREAT-- I find myself utterly in the same predicament as at the beginning of this review. ?It is 3pm, I'm staring at financials, frustrated and Kyotofu-less.....SIGH.

This is a cute dessert bar with a small bakery counter in the front where you can purchase their famous chocolate souffle cupcakes (without the toppings that come on the plate when dining in), softserves and other treats. ?Delicious cocktails (such as the Nigori Colada) and sakes can be ordered at half price during their Sunday night happy hour. ?I must admit that I am tempted to take a star off because the word on the street is that the softserve cups for to-go orders have recently significantly decreased in size, while still being sold at the original price point.

i was really disappointed in this restaurant. my sister and i went there on sunday night for some dessert. we've order: - cup of coffee - signature sweet tofu - matcha green tea tofu cheese cake - ginger rice pudding - warm mochi choco cake - soymilk soft ice cream sundae - chocolate mochi cupcake - vanila mochi cupcake first of all, their presentation was very cute and appealing. but i was there to taste not to just look at it :p their signature cupcakes were so dry that when i was chewing them down, my throat was itching. i had to grab some water to make it go down! also, i wanted to comment on their warm mochi chocoo cake... it tasted so bad that i wanted to send it back but our waiter was so nice. it had some sweet filling inside they called it on the menu "candied violet". it tasted like water down strawberry jam w/ dried cake. after one bite, i did not wanted to touch it again. i couldn't believe this was popular. only thing i liked from my order was a cup of coffee and signature sweet tofu. it tasted something like japanese pudding but after taste was clean and crisp w/ right amt of sweetness. my total spending was $36.95 and i won't go there again!

Great on a weekday night since there were not many people. Ordered the prix fixe three course dessert sampling. First came the sweet tofu with raspberry(?) sauce. First instinct was a little strong on the berry sauce, a mixture of sour berry over sweet aftertaste. The tofu was very... soy-y, which is what this place is known for anyway. Silky, soft, a great starter but i didn't find it too amazing. Then came the dessert platter with matcha creme brulee, chocolate brownie and raspberry cake. Their raspberry cake was new and the waitress asked us how we thought about it. I though the texture was was a little too soft, and the crust wasn't thick enough. Matcha creme brulee was da bomb. Delicious, right amount of sweetness. Chocolate brownie tasted like vegan brownie, bleeeeh not my type. Finally came the matcha candy stick thingies. omg these are so good. I SWEAR i would buy them if they sell it at the front of the store, these stuff were like matcha organism on a stick. They're made out of white chocolate, matcha powder and cream (a guilty pleasure since they were super fatty), but man, i would save my day's worth of calories just to eat those. When i got my check, they gave us each a complimentary green tea cookie. They were chewy and tasted... kind of stale, meh. I wish they would just give me more of those matcha goodies! Overall, cute hang out place, yummyyyy and cute desserts, 4 stars it is!!

OMG... sooo delicious. ?From their appetizers... main course... all the way to their amazing desserts. ?Their tofu is so velvety, creamy and delicate. ?Wished they would open in D.C. ! ?Please! Oh and btw, their service was prompt, attentive and friendly.

I was really looking foward to trying this place out. ?The decor is parallel to the Japanese minimalistic feel. Pleasant and you can have a nice chit chat w/your other. ?However, I was a bit disappointed with the desserts. ?I had the Chestnut Mochi Chocolate Cake and MT had the Toasted Walnut Tahitian Parfait. ?Tiny, tiny, desserts! ?She liked mine more than hers. She had the ginger tangerine sencha - thumbs down, and I had a typical green tea. ?This place might be over-hyped. ?I've also been to Room 4 Dessert. ?These places you're probably paying for food presentation. ?You can find much tastier desserts in other areas. ?In my opinion, it's not really worth coming here again. ? Now, if they offered matcha bubble tea, I might reconsider.

The combination of Japanese mod decor and a tasty selection of unusual flavors creates a soothing atmosphere - Kyotofu is definitely a place to try at least once. ?Get the sampler to maximize your visit - or order several items to share with friends.

If you're looking for atmosphere and fancy Japanese plates and dessert, this is a cool place to go. Very pretty dishes. If you're looking for sweets that will knock your socks off, look elsewhere. It's a little on the bland side. But that's just me. But based the number of folks that fill this place the day we went as well as the more positive reviews on Yelp, I'm thinking we missed something. Might be back...

An excellent place to pick up interesting deserts. ?I recommend the sorbets or the signature tofu. ?The atmosphere is pleasant, intimate, and candlelit, but it still a place you can go with friends as opposed to a date. ?The service with a little indifferent, but it was near closing so maybe just a long day. ?Overall pretty good.

I finally ventured all the way out to Hell's Kitchen to check this place out and though the dinner was ehh, dessert more than made up for it! For dinner we ordered: Chicken & tofu sliders - not sure where the tofu was in this dish but was quite tasty - albeit a bit on the dry side Smoked salmon onigiri - I liked this dish b/c I liked smoked salmon. It was something like a smoked salmon sushi roll Housemade edamame tofu - This dish was beautifully presented, but both L and I did not like it. I'm Asian so I'm not new to tofu. I thought this dish was going to be a special and unique twist on regular tofu, however, what came out was just a slab of tofu with truffle oil on top. It was as if I just bought tofu from the supermarket and put it on the plate. There wasn't much flavor and we didn't finish the dish. Now, onto the main course - dessert! I ordered the signature sweet tofu and oh. my. god. This is probably my favorite dessert of the moment. The black sugar syrup that comes with it ?has just the right amount of sweetness as to not overpower the sweet tofu. The regular order of this dish is a pretty generous portion and I pretty much devoured it in 5 secs. Yes, it was that good! And by the way, when the check came, our waiter did not include the housemade tofu dish since we had mentioned to him that we didn't really like it. Bonus points for great service!!

Mainly a dessert joint that features home made tofu, this place surprisingly has some pretty delectable foods. ?Came here during their "brunch" hours and had their sake infused mac and cheese with pancetta which was AWESOME. ?Also had the pigs in a duvet and the mushroom quiche. ?They also have various sake flights where you get to choose 3 unique sakes of various flavors. ?The pigs in a duvet is just hot dog meat wrapped around puff pastry. ?Their home made tofu, black sesame and signature sweet are both very very good. ?I prefer the black sesame tofu for its flavor. ?My wife prefers the signature sweet tofu for its light flavors. ?Nonetheless both were pretty darn good. ?This place can get pretty packed during the night time, so try going for lunch.

i have been curious about this dessert place since i heard about them. considering that i have this love for dao fu fah (the soft tofu with syrup that you can find at dimsum, or at some obscure corners in chinatown for 2 bucks a quart). then it gets better with all the rave reviews, some even comparing it to chikalicious dessert bar. Im no purist, but if you compare it to chika's desserts, im down and im curious. so i set out to come here with my husband, since we had dinner a couple of blocks away. first off, the decor was nice, sadly the lighting wasnt. this place is in desperate need of a lighting designer. definitely spacious for NYC restaurant standards, and the open kitchen with the bakery counter and the barstools that hide the secret dining room inside. it is a nice place, as i said, but something is definitely lacking with the lighting. the the menu was a bit confusing - because i originally thought that this place was solely a dessert place, but i got over that fast. i didnt bother looking at the sandwiches, nor the sake offerings. the dessert part of the menu, was confusing too - but i expected that from a "modern japanese desserts" which is pretty weird since i had never been confused in minamoto kitchoan which sells traditional dessert/snacks. in any case, my hubby had the sesame cake, and i had the vegan varlrhona chocolate cake. sesame cake with banana ice cream + chocolate cake = sneaky way of getting my favorite flavor combo, chocolate banana. but they failed! they FAILED MEEEEEE!!!! the banana ice cream was great, but the sesame cake had a texture that i didnt like, so did the vegan varlhona cake. i gotta admit, anything you put varlhona on, i will eat it. its almost a guarantee that it will be good. cake was dry, (but thats because there's no butter, no eggs), but it was a good flavor. anything cake should have good texture and good flavor to me. the coconut sorbet? another failure. the coconut flavor was too strong for me that it was more savory for me than sweet. so will i come back? just like rachel a., i will have an open mind the next time. but maybe ill just come back for the signature tofu.

Upon entering, the place smelled like pure milky sweet dessert heaven! They serve meals, but I would suggest for you to just come here and go all out on desserts. We got four desserts--green tea creme brulee (of which I didn't even know something like it even existed O.O), warm miso chocolate cake, black sesame sweet tofu, and soymilk icecream with matcha mochi. All were very pretty and very yummy. By the end of the night, I experienced a sweets overkill but who cares:D A very romantic, sleek setting with visually appealing food. This place is a matcha green tea lover's (like me :)) sanctuary. Cute complementary cookies at the end too, cute receipt holders too. Actually, cute everything! LOVES IT!

Appreciation is a word that is lacking from both sides of the table at this establishment. The desserts were creative and enjoyable. The atmosphere is enjoyable until the service begins. Tourist trap trickery and dishonesty ruin the entire experience. Confrontational and inept staff made one late night option an unfortunate experience that was too late to correct. Methinks not would be an understatement.

We got the dessert sampler for 2 that came with sparkling sake and chocolate cupcake souffles to take home. My favorite part was the sake and I don't typically like the stuff! That being said, other highlights were the green tea creme brulee and the signature sweet tofu. While I didn't care for the raspberry cheesecake nor the green tea flavored chocolate lollipops, the service was engaged when they came by the table. Otherwise, they seemed a bit harried and it was hard to get their attention when needed/wanted which should not be the case considering the automatically added 20% gratuity. Lastly, the gnats that swarmed around our heads and our food were what bumped it down from a 4- to 3-star experience. The last time I was here (1.5 years ago), the white seating was actually white and it now looks grimy. These last two aspects impinged upon the visit quite a bit.

a whole place based on soy products? ?i know, it sounded suspicious to me as well, but they managed to pull it off. ? i'd say that the taste here is more delicate. ?if you're the kind of person who needs 5 cups of sugar in your dessert, this is not the place for you. ?their desserts are beautifully plated and presented but not bursting with flavor. ? i had the black sesame sweet tofu, which was amazingly fluffy and smooth with a just hint of black sesame. ?all of my friends' desserts were the same. ?beautiful, tasty but not over the top. ? the other things you should know about this place is that there's a minimum of one order per person so you can't share a dessert and bounce. ?also, there are different menus for different seasons. ?i had summer, but i wonder what kinds of tasty treats fall (ESPECIALLY FALL), winter, and spring will bring.

I went in with relatively high expectations and pretty much had them all met. ?Everything we ordered was both delicious and artfully presented. ?I got the warm miso chocolate cake, which was full of melty chocolately goodness, and my friend got the black sesame sweet tofu, which, despite my rather lackluster interest in anything with sesame, enjoyed very much. ?Flavors were subtle and not overwhelming, just the way I like my desserts. ?Some people might like things sweeter, I dunno. ?I also got some sort of alcoholic hot chocolate drink, which for some reason I can't find on the menu now, but was pretty tasty and actually had a decent amount of alcohol in it. ? Our server was very polite and service was excellent. ?Decor is cute and would definitely make a great date place. ?And its location in Hell's Kitchen (one of the places I find the hardest to find restaurants that are not crazy expensive and are worth going to), makes it even more appealing. ?

Wonderful small gem of a restaurant with an eclectic menu and a wonderful sake list that includes tasting flights. ?You'll find more than just tofu on the menu but the tofu should not be skipped. ?Barbecue eel rolls and chicken sliders on brioche buns share the menu with artisanal tofu with edamame paste. The desserts vary from simple but well balanced cheese plates to delicate pleasures such as sweet corn tofu cheesecake that can be worth a trip for themselves. ?While the dishes are flavorful and well prepared, you should not expect great cuisine. ?This is fun food and, if you accept that, then fun is what you will have. The seating in the back makes for an attractive dining room. ?However, it is not very good for larger groups.

Creative, delicious, and fun - Kyotofu is more dessert restaurant than dessert bar (since most of the space is table seating) but the desserts are still delicious. My friends and I had a tasting of practically every dessert and each one was better than the next - all creative with japanese influences.

Yeah, it is a cute place with fun cocktails but definitely not my kind of place. Having Hitachino Nest beer was nice, since it's a something that not every Japanese restaurant has. Other than that, the cocktails weren't so grand (even with their creative ingredients) and the desserts didn't blow me away. I wouldn't go here for world-class food and desserts but the ambiance is pretty good. It's very small and modern and a table for 5 of your friends is great (with the small room, it would make a birthday even more special than it is).

Kyotofu is relatively new, being only 5 months old now. I came here with an open and excited mind because a number of my friends have gone and they've liked it. I've been itching to try it for quite some time and finally I had my chance! I came here one day after i went to chikalicious. it just happened to be that my friend from HK was visiting and it was his birthday, so we popped into kyotofu. my roomie and i started with two cocktails while we waited for the birthday boy to arrive - me , a fresh strawberry and banana shochu cocktail (SO incredibly good!!! i told them to add this to their main menu) and a blood peach bellini. yumminess. the people at kyotofu are so incredibly sweet and thoughtful and truly care about your feedback (they even put a candle in his dessert and wrote happy birthday on the plate..and came and sang with us!). for desserts i got the shiso pepper tofu cheesecake; my roomie got the chocolate mochi cake and the birthday boy got the sesame black tofu. ALL three were amazing! the shiso pepper tofu cheesecake is weird at first but it grows on you. all extremely light, tasty, and mind bogglingly yummy. we also supplemented the desserts with more drinks - loved the harajuku martini (fresh apple shochu martini!) and the kyotofu drink (fresh raspberry mint shochu) as well. What's wonderful about all of their drinks is that they use FRESH fruits. I love refreshing drinks, so naturally I fell in love! The decor is that of minimalist. I love it, love it, love it. Great for a date, great to catch up with a few good friends over drinks and dessert. You can't ask for anything more. And they have great taste in music too! I actually think it rivals Chikalicious, but in a different way. The vibe is different and the fact that they have a bar stocked with great and inventive drink combinations. I loved it. So. Much. I've been raving about it all day to anyone who'll listen. Just the right combination of everything in my opinion. ?I'm going to be back. I already informed Nicole and Susan that I'm going to be a regular. Hehehe =)

I only recommend this place for the dessert. I eat out for food that I cannot make at home. Had the curry dish and it tasted like the curry I make out of a box. Anyway- the tofu pudding here is amazing. Not sure what kind of soybean they use but the flavor is very intense compared to the tofu pudding you can get in C-town. It is a bit firmer but very smooth.

Perhaps Tofu desserts are an acquired taste. ?I was visiting NYC and met up with my friend here because she's been wanting to go. ?I'm not a big tofu fan in general, I only love the chinese stinky tofu. ?Anyways, this is really a cute little place, very trendy and modern. ? There are bar style seating against the front store window and when ?you head towards the back it opens up to a single dim lit room. ?Everything that came was adorable and looked really good. ?We ordered the 3 course dessert sampler which included the sake liquor tofu cheesecake, some other tofu thing and the warm chestnut chocolate cake. ?I think the worst of the three was the sake cheesecake. ?It was so strong that after taking a bite I thought I was drunk. ?We also ordered the ?signature sweet tofu and the Japanese gelatin. ?Again, let me reiterate that tofu and dessert are not the best of friends in my book. ? Also I was looking at their website and it raved about thyeir chocolate souffle cupcake. ?We ordered that to go and ended up eating it in the cab (since we left mostly everything else on its plate). ?It souffle it was not, not even a cupcake. ?It was really dense and chocolatey, like a brownie in a little cupcake foil. ?

total girly girl place, every other table was basically a group of girl night outs. desserts are definitely the way to go, but dinner - go elsewhere. we each had the prix fix $18 bento box of chicken meatballs (size of malt balls), chicken tofu slider, pigs in a blanket and unagi phyllo wraps, the best thing in this box was probably the slider. it also came with a bowl of warm mushroom salad which was mostly leaves dressed in oil. Sake infused mac n cheese - just very peppery, nothing special, not that creamy and sake doesn't play any role in the dish at all. Desserts were fun and different, strawberry annitsu was probably our favorite. green tea creme brulee tasted more like cold green tea pudding. Pomegranate mojitos were not strong at all, if you decide to do savory dinner, stick with the beers to wash down all the grease. service was subpar. overall, if you're in the neighborhood seeking something sweet - kyotofu would be a nice spot, but not worth a detour.

Multiple dessert-gasms in one evening. I came here with a friend with a Gilt "dessert" tasting and it was just incredible. We both ordered dinner as well, which I didn't have super high expectations but they blew me away. My sake-infused mac n cheese was SPECTACULAR with a kick. His tofu and chicken burger was just so delicious and flavorful. The chicken was perfectly cooked and so juicy. Our dessert sampler included sparkling sake (basically the better, Asian version of a prosecco...goodbye Asti!), sweet tofu (lightly sweet, pretty good), green tea creme brulee (just as incredible as the last time I had it), flourless chocolate cake (I don't think he got a bite, so that is a pretty good indication I liked it), raspberry cheesecake (really nicely tart!), and these green tea fudge candies. Ok. I would like to start a new sentence for these candies. They are CRACK. They melt in your mouth, apparently are made without a drop of butter, and are so chewy and dense and perfectly sweetened. Seriously I forgot I was trying to be better eater...these are just too good to resist. We also ordered the soft serve (dairy-free) and it was SO GOOD. So much better than McD's (and I really like that stuff...shame I know). The toppings were only ok...I didn't care for the caramel or the brownies but the soft serve by itself was great. On top of all this we got 2 chocolate souffle cupcakes to go which was the best frigging chocolate cupcake I've ever eaten in my life. Not even funny how much I like this place. Perfect date spot. Lovely service as well.

Cute little place for dessert and small bites. Their chocolate cupcake and no bake raspberry tofu cheesecake are my favorites. The tofu salad is so tasty, the vinaigrette dressing that it is tossed in is out of this world! So good that my bf forgot about me and almost gobbled up the whole bowl himself. I also love the music they play, a mix of asian pop, alternative, top 40 artists, but they play songs that are not typical radio singles.

Bottom line, my super-picky husband and I both loved it, and we're dessert snobs. We had blackberry-yuzu anmitsu and warm miso chocolate cake. Hubby was amazed by the anmitsu. I loved both but was partial to chocolate cake. The waitress also gave us a small sample of soymilk soft serve, which was completely yummy! We're definitely coming back to try more items on the menu. Of course the cute atmosphere doesn't hurt and the service was great, no complaints there. I look forward to going back.

3.75 stars Ordered the "pigs in a duvet" for my entree and shared the chocolate souffle cupcake, sweet tofu dessert, and 5-course dessert tasting (came with green tea creme brulee, strawberry shortcake, miso brownie, matcha, and a small sample of the sweet tofu). The "pigs in a duvet" were described as Japanese berkshire pork in a puffy pastry, but really came as pigs in a blanket. I should've known better. ?They were tasty, the pastry light and delicate and...well...puffy, accompanied with a mustard dipping sauce, but, really, I should've known better than to order pigs in a blanket for my lunch here! The sweet tofu came in a glass cup/bowl and served with a side of black sesame sauce. ?It was pretty good. ?Definitely a delicate flavor that should be tasted first without pouring in the sesame sauce. ?The chocolate souffle brownie was yummy, but overcooked on the outside. ?All the other desserts were pretty good.

Kyotofu is one of my favorite dessert places in Hell's Kitchen. The first time I went, I ordered there signature tofu dessert; it was just right -- not too sweet but deliciously delicate and beautifully presented (~7-8 dollars). I've also been there for drinks. They have an impressive selection of sakes and other Japanese drinks. The upside is that they are delicious. The downsides are that they tend to be smaller and that they're pricey (at least $12 - 17 a drink). However, the service is always great, as is the food -- a great place to go and grab dessert once in a while.

We discovered this gem on the last day of my trip to NY. Our mission was to try at least 1 dessert place a day. Initially when we got there it looked like a full house and the bartender/greeter took down our names and said it would be a 15/20 minute wait. We stood at the entrance watching the chef meticulously preparing the desserts through the clear view window. There was a trio in front of us who sat at the bar for awhile waiting for a table. The bartender didn't seem to give a hoot about them and he projected a similar attitude to us. Despite that our server Brian made up for it with an attentive and pleasant demeanor. We ordered the chicken and tofu sliders, Original tofu served cold with a sesame tuile and a kuromitsu black sugar syrup (not overly sweet and tofu was silky), soymilk soft ice cream sundae with a side of strawberries (consistency of a soft serve ice cream and no awkward taste of the soy); and green tea cr¨¨me brulee (shell was crunchy and green tea flavor was apparent) paired with a pink sparkling sake (refreshing). We were very pleased with our selections. I was expecting the Original tofu to be similar to the Chinese style Silken Tofu Dessert which is served luke warm/warm with a ginger flavored syrup. At the end we had the sliders with a side of chips and the savory balanced the sweet. Kudos to the chef for presentation with the desserts neatly plated creating clean lines. ?The combinations of ingredients are exotic and inventive. The price is slightly higher than other dessert places but you're paying the ambience and location (Hell's Kitchen). From the bakery, I had a miniature matcha green tea cupcake (surprisingly moist with no frosting). I bought macaroons which didn't survive the plane ride home but used the smashed pieces and mixed in with a plain rice pudding. The flavors are interesting: Chocolate-Passion, Black Sesame-Red Bean, and Strawberry-Yuzu.

I've been here before for dessert only but I've always been curious about their dinner selection. ?Yesterday, I decided I was going to Eat - yes, with a capital E. I decided to for the sampler since I couldn't make up my mind. ?The warm Japanese mushroom salad was great, the warm mushrooms perfectly paired with cheese and red onions. ?But the bento was even more amazing. ?That evening my selection consisted of the creamy croquette, sake braised pork belly, tofu and chicken slider, and the homemade tofu. ?I love tofu so the homemade tofu was very much appreciated, but what simply blew me away was the pork belly. ?It was melt in your mouth sort of delicious, the kind that had me grinning like a loon at all the people who was walking past (I was seated at the front, with the glass window that's facing the sidewalk). ?Total and absolute winner, that pork belly. The waiter kindly told me that the dessert sampler was made for 2, but I wanted it all for myself. ?First course was a pumpkin tofu panna cotta - I've had a version of this before when I visited in the past, but a different flavor. ?Just like I was then, I was completely taken by surprise at "bright" the flavor of pumpkin was. ?It was like eating pumpkin pie, but without the heaviness. ?Second course was a trio of minis: ginger creme brulee, chocolate cake with ice cream and caramel, and the autumn anmitsu. ?I loved the ginger creme brulee but I have a very big soft spot for anmitsu, so that was my favorite of the three. ?The last course was green tea chocolate and a hazelnut cookie. ?That chocolate, I would eat in freaking pounds, seriously. ?Great way to end the whole meal. ? All in all, Kyotofu is a great dining experience if you wanna try something Japanese but inventive. ?I know some people are disappointed with the dinner menu, but I think of it more as a tapas place. ?The focus, though, is on the desserts - and that, my friends, are the best things ever.

I had heard some things about the restaurant that were not so good, but I have to say, I didn't find any of the negatives to really be true. ?The ONLY thing I would say is that YES they have a VERY limited menu. ?But I am vegetarian and my friend was not and we both ate something that was delicious. ?They are not big dishes, so don't go there if you are starving. ?But if you are going before a night out drinking it's perfect.... or if you just don't eat big meals. The service was great and the presentation of the food was really wonderful. Now of course to the 2 best parts: They have a full cocktail and saki menu. ?I tried a couple types of saki that I had never tried before and they were both really good. Additionally, the dessert is soooo good. ?Interesting combinations and of course displayed ?like a 5 star restaurant. PLUS our bill was under $50 with 2 drinks!!!! Can't beat that.

Great chocolate souffle and green tea souffle cupcakes. ? Not the best cupcake in NYC as New York Magazine claims, but still a nice cupcake. ?Unlike other cupcakes, there is no icing, which can be good if you don't dig super sweet icing on your cupcakes. ? It was $7 for 2 cupcakes, so 'spensive. ? I bought these at the store on 9th avenue, but I noticed Dean and Deluca carries them as well, so if you aren't in midtown, check out the D&D near you if you wish to try their desserts. Same price. The store is very small. ?The staff was very friendly. ? The cake was very moist and the flavor was very nice. ?I can see why it would be in the top 10 best NYC cupcakes, but BEST is stretching it a little.

I came here to have dessert with a total party of 6. ?We settled on ordering some drinks and 4 desserts, and were told that we had to order at least 6 desserts because out party was larger than 5. ?Apparently, there is a 1 plate per person policy on parties larger than 5. ?Am I the only one who thinks a policy such as this is completely ridiculous at a place that is touted mostly for dessert? ?People can't share dessert? ?Is my 50 some odd dollars not good enough on a Sunday at 9PM? ?I'll never come back.

I go to Kyotofu every time I'm in NYC. I love their desserts and I use to love the restaurant in its entirety, but I don't anymore. The desserts are great, but the customer service USE to BE friendly and nice. I recently went back and was very disappointed that the staff killed my Happy Buzz about eating there. My recent Oct. experience: I called first to see if I could move my reservations because Kyotofu gets pretty crowded on a weekend evening. The person on the phone said "we don't have your reservation" (I made the reservation like 2-3 days before) He just said - you don't need one. Just the sound of his voice was very sullen. I don't know what happened to the cheerfulness and the easy-going, down-to-earth, friendly staff. Compared to the 2 other times I went before, it was Great! Talking to staff and getting to know them, but this time - Not even a smile. I started commenting to my friend about their attitude with the atmosphere. *The staff people don't have to be as dim as their restaurant lighting.* I don't know what their tactic was on lighting, but it's quite dim inside. Love the food, but not happy with the staff. I was looking forward to an all around great Kyotofu experience like my previous ones, but was disappointed that the staff didn't reach my expectations of customer service. I want to feel welcomed and have the staff keep in mind that they matter, too, in the food business. They are serving the food and if they are unhappy serving, then they shouldn't be there. Quality food brings back customers, but so does quality customer service. 3.5 Stars

I visited Kyotofu after reading about them in a magazine which stated they made some of the best cupcakes in the city. I have a weakness for cupcakes, so I bought two. The coconut shiso and the chocolate souffle. Both were just overly sweet, sticky and frosting-less. Boo to them. I want my $6 back.

YUMMY! But how did we end up spending 90 bucks for 2 people?! LOL After reading the reviews online for Kyotofu, I was determined to try MANY dishes there! But the stomach can only hold so much, so we took all the desserts in doggie bags. For drinks, we had 2 different types of bellinis, one was with white peach, the other with blackberry puree, for main courses, we had the Chicken and Tofu Sliders (BEST little burgers I've EVER had!), red snapper nigiri, (a bit on the blend side but beautiful presentation), sake infused mac and cheese with panceta( BEST mac and cheese ever!!!! The panceta and sake did the job) and pigs in a duvet (boyfriend said it was filling, but can't go wrong with the combo of meat and pastries). For dessert, we had the metcha green tea cupcake (VERY MOIST, but could've been a bit more light), the black sesame sweet tofu (Good, but a few bite would do), and finally, warm mochi chocolate (I'm not a big chocolate fan, but boyfriend said it was amazing). To sum up, great little joint, cheap if you want to indulge your taste buds in a few dishes that come in little portion sizes. but the dollars adds up as you get a lot of these little plates. ^__^

This is one of those places where it seems pretty cool when you look at the website and then you go..and it isn't so cool after all. Not to say it sucks, just not for me.

I first tried Kyotofu during the 2010 9th Ave Food Fair and their soymilk soft serve blew my mind! ?I wanted to try their entrees and finally had the chance to on Tuesday night. ?A friend & I had an amazing dinner there. ?We managed to make it just in time for the happy-hour drinks special and the waitress was super nice and said she would honor the deal for as long as we were there that night. ?We split the edamame appetizer, which tasted like it'd be steamed over tea, and the lime was a nice touch. We both have the bento sampler box and were amazed at how much food it came with since we both thought the salad would be one of the boxes rather than a whole separate dish. Of course being us, we just had to get the soymilk sundae for dessert. ?As a bonus surprise, we were comp'd a squash cake dessert as well! ?Both were amazing and devoured on sight. ?The atmosphere is wonderful and the service was fantastic. ?Also I really want their teapot/teacup set! Definitely looking forward to my next meal there.

Kyotofu- how I adore you. Miniature soy based desserts that are not too hot, not too cold and not too sweet. This is my go to dessert bar for the last three years. I've had many many double dates here, meet and greets and girls dessert nights. Their chocolate souffle cupcake, which has won best New York cupcake (NY Mag), is warm with a gooey chocolate center. One of my friends unfailingly orders this cupcake each time we meet up here. From their summer menu- I enjoy sharing their soy based ice cream with fruit compote and minty chewy candies. Its refreshing cool, and makes my breath smell like frosted mint. The summer prix fixe ends with trio of mini cookies- green tea, black sesame and white sesame. From their winter Kaiseki prix fixe - I enjoyed the toasted walnuts from warm sweet potato cake, and the unique taste of slightly bitter tang of green tea with the caramelized crust of the creme brulee. However, the most texturally appealing dish and the most pleasing to my palate was their warm miso chocolate cake. I would take their chocolate cake over any of the chocolate goodies in Max Brenner or City Bakery, any day. I also love how they end the meal with tiny take home treats, sealed with a Kyotofu logo. Here's to you, Kyotofu.To me and you and many more dessert fun filled nights.

I haven't been for dinner, but I'm there for dessert probably weekly. How this place doesn't have 5 solid stars is beyond me. Fresh tofu made daily on-site is artfully remastered into the most delicious desserts this city has to offer. Need sweet? The signature Sweet Tofu drenched in syrup and topped with a crystalized dried apricot has a flan like consistency while tasting millions of times better than flan. Need tart? Then order the Rhubarb-Strawberry Cobbler with a tofu biscuit and shiso mint ice cream. If you're like me, and eat crumb cake not for the cake but for the crumble topping, this one is the unquestionable star of the menu. Need ice cream? The soymilk soft serve twisted with chocolate has hints of peanut butter which smack of reese's in soy form. Need bizarre? The Sweet Potato Tofu Cheesecake is an absolute favorite, delicious and frankly indescribable. If you're like me and can't decide, order the prix fixe - 3 courses, 5 desserts, total bliss. A pot of one of their many japanese teas, or a bottle from the almost overwhelming sake list, caps off the evening.

After hearing about Kyotofu from many people I walked over to try it and to see why so much chatter. And WOW I was very impressed. The place is small, maybe it holds 30 people. Dimly lit it has a boutique ?trendy romantic feel about the place. If ?you like authentic Japanese food you will absolutely love it!!! The food was flavorful and beautifully presented and the staff was friendly and efficient. But as good as the food is the desert is out of this world. When I was presented with the sunday I ordered I made a deal with myself to just eat half but it was sooo good that I ate the whole thing. (sorry hips) ?I must say I went into Kyotofu with no real expectations but walked out a huge fan and plan to go back often.

Clearly, these guys are rating themselves. The food was decent but the attitude and service was typical New York baloney. First off, there were eight of us who sat down to eat dessert and drink. No one said one word to us about there being a mandatory order. As soon as one of the waiter heard me talking about "splitting a dessert" with someone he said "Didn't the host tell you?" everyone must order something. I find these sort of guerrilla tactics disgusting especially considering we ordered a few bottles of sake. The desserts themselves were delicious and exotic but frankly I felt like I was getting charged extra to deal with the attitude. The chocolate cake with lavender tea was moist an delicious. I also liked the mochi (Japanese marshmallows) that came with dessert. The sake was brisk. But at $106 dollars leave your attitude at the door. My friend thought they had taxed on the included gratuity (which they didn't deserve) and told them so and they said not to worry about it. We were outside when they came running after us asking if something was wrong with the service we barely left enough to cover the 20 percent included gratuity. My much calmer friend than me had to restrain me from responded with a list of all the things wrong with the service. I continue to be baffled by service inNew York (not brusque busy service but rude). It is too bad because a lot of their desserts are made with tofu and appropriate for my many vegetarian friends. But, I know plenty of other places in Times Square I can get ripped off with just as good of food without the attitude.

Yum! I had a cold matcha latte and the blueberry yuzu cobbler...delicious! I love yuzu so the yuzu ice cream and the yuzu infused blueberries (not to mention the crunchy cobbler crust) were perfect...especially for a hot summer evening! The servers were really nice, it wasn't too busy on a Friday night, and overall I just had a really good experience. Yes, it's like $10 for a small dessert. Given the experience as a whole, I think it was worth it!

Nice deserts, not overly sweet and interestingly designed. ?The place is as slow as snails and pretty cramped so you end up overhearing every obnoxious conversation around you (drunk chicks suck). ?The sparkling sake and the mixed drinks were very much acceptable.

I was there 2 weeks ago. It was probably my 10th time there. We ordered a lot of appetizers and entrees. The foods were decent. the desserts were still very good but I noticed the service is getting worse. I actually noticed this problem for my past few time visits. One of the waitresses is Korean I believe. She served my table few times before. She doesn't smile that much. She took away our unfinished salad without asking. Service was kinda rush and the music was too loud. Will go back for desserts but probably not entrees

SO good! I went with a friend last night prior to a play, and the dinner was definitely the better part of the evening. We each had a savory option, and though my green tea soba noodles weren't anything extraordinary, they were really good. And then we did the dessert sampling, which is three courses of small portions of their desserts. Though the miso chocolate cake tasted a lot like, well, any other molten chocolate cake, so good but not mind-blowing, the ginger rice pudding and the sweet potato cheesecake were absolutely delectable. Because of the tofu base, they don't leave that sickly sweet or heavy flavor behind, and I left after one of the more stressful days I've had feeling relaxed, satisfied, but not overwhelmed. The barley iced tea was also exactly what I needed. The atmosphere is intimate and warm, and I can see how there would be quite a wait if you got there much later than we did. However, they also offer desserts to go. And let me say this to conclude: if it wasn't on 9th Avenue, and I wasn't an east-side girl, I'd be there a lot more. Another strong point in Kyotofu's favor- even though it was getting busy as we were leaving, there was absolutely no rush to leave. We were allowed to linger over our extra mini-cupcake that came with our check. Kyotofu, you may be out of my way, but I'll totally be back for more.

Got the prix fixe kaiseki dessert courses for $17. I got it to go, and it was quite well packaged, however there was some confusion as to what sauce went with what. ?Oh well. Strawberry shortcake - tasty, but nothing surprising since I love strawberry shortcake in general. Miso brownie - this was awesome. ?Dense and moist, possibly the best brownie I've ever had. Signature sweet tofu with black sugar sauce? - amazing. ?I've never had tofu like this. ?Do they add something to it? ?It was soft, delicious, and light. ?The sauce complimented it well. ?My friend who does not like tofu and was very skeptical about this place even liked it. ?It had just enough sweetness. Macaron - I think it was the chocolate green tea one, although I didn't know it had any green tea in it when I was eating it. ?It was still very tasty and fresh, much better than the ones we had at Macaron cafe. Raspberry? tofu cheesecake (tart one) - was pretty good, although nothing really spectacular. ?Get the sweet tofu instead if you need to pick. The interior is very small and there is no huge sign outside, but the people were nice and it was very stylish and clean.

This is probably the best Lava-cake like dessert I've ever had. I decided to go after reading about it on the New yorks best cupcake by NY mag and was not disappointed at all!. Best out all the high end restaurants and their desserts when it comes to the warm chocolate richness. Though the dessert is small..it is enough. Its an amazing 3-4 bites and reminds me of a rich, light, and souffle-like. I haven't had the food there yet but will definitely go at some point and grab another cupcake.

This place would've merited 4 stars alone for the dessert, but the slow service knocked it down a star. We were looking for a dessert place near Times Square-ish to hang out at night, and my friend found this place. There's a small dining room in the back, but no available tables big enough to fit the four of us, so we sat at the bar facing the street for some people-watching. My friend and I split the green tea creme brulee (our other friends got the sweet tofu), and I think it took over 20 minutes for the desserts to come to our table. I was seriously wondering if they were making it from scratch. The green tea creme brulee was good--very lightly flavored, yet not as firm or cold as I normally like it. However, it's something kinda unique that you wouldn't find just anywhere. I also got their chocolate cupcake (toted as the "best cupcake in NYC"--high expectations right there) to-go. Very moist and crumbly... I'm not sure if there's tofu in this, but it was good regardless. There was no frosting on top, but it was sweet and flavorful as it was. Overall, good dessert place. The slow service & high prices were bummers though.

matcha green tea creme brulee: SO SMOOTH, perfect paring w/ lychee sorbet white sesame cake: a bit heavier than I expected, but absolutely lovely too! you can really taste the banana vegan valrhona chocolate cake: oh my goodness, best chocolate, ever had some nice jasmine tea, too! wonderfully attentive service, looking forward to going back!

came back here again and this time i got to try their bakery goods. 1) chocolate souffle cupcakes - i saw on the menu that this is one of their famous/best cupcakes. well, im not a big chocolate person and i thought it was so-so. the cupcake tasted more like a brownie. it was quite rich and chocolaty. 2) passion fruit macaroon - oh god, this was amazing. the passion fruit offered this unexpected flavor. the filling was dark chocolate instead of the usual cream. overall, the combination was really nice. i also got to try their miso soy frozen yogurt. it was very different because the frozen yogurt was slightly salty. at the same time, it was quite rich and sweet. makes you want to go for more!

It's a cute dessert place in Hell's Kitchen. The desserts are different but pretty yummy. If you couldn't figure it out from the name but tofu is number one ingredient in all the desserts. We ordered the creme brulee and the black sesame sweet tofu. ?I wouldn't say they made my toes curl but they were good. It's a different take on dessert. The ginger sorbet that came with the creme brulee definitely was a nice complement to the creme brulee. It was light and refreshing. I would go back because it's a fun place to try something different with friends.

Strangely sweet tofu concoctions. I tried the cheesecake and wasn't impressed. Really if you want to go out on a limb try their sweet tofu dishes which are a cup of soft tofu flavored with things like black sesame and offered with a simple syrup which you pour on top before you slurp away. I haven't decided if I like it or not but the uniqueness of the experience is enjoyable in itself.

The matcha green tea cr¨¨me br?l¨¦e and cupcakes are incredible! And even though they are well known for their desserts, the savory dishes are just as good. I highly recommend the sake-braised pork - it is so soft that it just melted in my mouth....Definitely one of my favorites!

Although the Japanese-ness of Kyotofu is highly dubious (except for their small portion which rings some "authenticity" :D ), desserts are fine and sake selection fair. Been here twice so far, wouldn't mind returning for Sunday sake specials and occasional desserts. Desserts (3.5/5) Signature tofu is the star, creamy and silky, though could have been served more chilled with reduced amount of kuromitsu and spoons one size smaller. Genmai financier retains the aroma of genmaicha, yet the amount of sugar input has unfortunately increased since last tasting. Matcha chocolate is cute, yet Meiji winter-special matcha chocolate which you can pick up from any Japanese market is even better. Matcha cr¨¨me br?l¨¦e and raspberry tofu cheesecake are good, nothing jaw-dropping compared with desserts at standard restaurants. chocolate cake is, well, okay. They do have Ichinokura Himezen, which isn't always available in most Japanese restaurants, hence one thumb up. Ambience (3/5) soft seats comfy, music vibrant, air stifling - no AC at 90 degrees! Service (3/5) Severs are efficient but not exactly the friendliest

Came here late on a Sat night, around 11pm. The back dining room was full but had no wait for a table for 2. Surprisingly, there was a diverse crowd - not just Asians and vegans. Ordered the matcha green tea creme brulee and the strawberry anmitsu. Creme brulee was not too sweet and really quite good, as well as the anmitsu, but was disappointed to find the latter being just a bunch of agar pieces with beans and random sweets thrown in... really reminded me of Filipino halo-halo. The plating is delicate and beautiful, but the portions are small. Somehow I can't get over the fact that they charge $9 for sweet tofu (which is basically dou-hua). Overall, nice date place, but I prefer something more casual.

Oh so delicious... We came here after Becco; intentionally skipping Becco's quite good coconut pudding desserts to try something new. As I mentioned in my previous review, I was here on Monday only to find out that they are closed on Mondays. This time, we got a chance to check out the yummy desserts this place offer. I ordered the Black Sesame Sweet tofu, which tasted great. The tofu had a perfect sesame taste, and also had a hint of almond (either really there, or just an aftertaste from the sesame). The tofu is so smooth and delicious, and there's absolutely no guilty feeling from eating this cuz its really healthy. The only drawback is you also feel the black sesame texture on your tongue as the tofu melts in your mouth. I also tried my friend's desserts. They ordered the Signature Sweet Tofu, the Fresh Blueberry & Blood Orange Tofu Cheesecake, and a Yuzu & Blackberry Anmitsu. The Signature Sweet Tofu is the best if you like sweets. It is a lightly sweeten tofu that you can add more black maple syrup for a even sweeter flavor. It is just as smooth as my Black Sesame Tofu but w/o the roughness of the black sesame. The Fresh Blueberry & Blood Orange Tofu Cheesecake is really good too, but the vanilla bean tofu ice cream is the best part of it. Presentation wise, that's the best looking dish. A bit on the tart side compare to the Black Sesame and the Signature tofu. As for the Yuzu & Blackberry Anmitsu, it was super sour. I don't know what ingredient they use, but unless you like Sour Patch Kids sour crystals in your desserts, I recommend you skip that. I literally had to choke down my spoonful to get that taste out of my mouth as fast as possible. Overall, a good place to go for dessert, especially since they open late.

Ran into this place with my buddy on the night I came into town. ?What I like about this place is that the kitchen closes late. Such places never fail to impress me. It was also cute. A modern decor, quirky Japanese look. We grabbed some snacks, since I hadn't eaten since 10 AM PST. I got the macaroni and cheese, which was tasty and a bit spicy (not that I'm complaining, but the menu could have warned me first). My buddy got the soba, which was kind of blandish to me. My blood orange/soju/capariniha was also just so-so. The server was super nice too, but he was totally oblivious when we were trying to get the check. I think for the price; I could go without. Still, it does seem like the perfect place for a date.

I tried the sake infused mac and cheese, warm miso chocolate cake, signature sweet tofu, and matcha creme brule. All of the stuff was edible and quite tasty. But it just didn't have that wow factor. Everything was quite nice in a way, but i'm not crazy about the place either. I personally don't like the miso chocolate cake, i think chocolate and miso doesn't go well together.

Kyotofu is a nice spot to take friends and just hang out with some fantastic desserts. Although im not a big fan of anything yuzu, the other desserts are really good. The strawberry shortcake is amazing. I had the assorted sorbets, also very good, except for the yuzu...haha. The cookies that go with the sorbet are PHENOMENAL! They have great service with super nice waiters and waitresses, its a real chill spot.

came here 2-3 times, the latest was last month. the open kitchen concept reminds me of chikalicious. very cool because you can see what's going on. some desserts displayed at the counter was meant for take-out and looked really good. i didn't really like their pudding, just because i wasn't a pudding-girl to start off with. staff were lovely. place wasn't extremely small but seatings weren't abundant, unless you came on a freezing winter night, or some random weeknight. bought their Cherry Blossom Assortment, basically a box full of "modern japanese desserts" "award-winning sakura sweets" as written on the simply printed yet beautiful looking LV-like box. Cookies and brownies "made with real edible cherry blossom from japan" and wholesome ingredients seemed justifyable for the $25 they charged. they're not your ordinary cookies.

My friend and I looooooove tofu, so naturally we gravitated towards Kyotofu. Unfortuantely this is NOT the place you want to go for dinner. ?We got the omakase menu for both food and dessert -- to have that choice itself was a great aspect to the menu, but the content (food + desserts) didnt really live up to how pretty they looked. The staff was really friendly, but since we didnt get any explanation when being served the food, I didnt get what part of the whole place had to do with tofu... but we assumed that all the desserts just had tofu blended in...? Sadly the dinner menu choices werent that great to begin with -- they were more finger foods than anything satisfying. The tastes themselves werent that impressive, but the presentation was very nice. Lesson of the day: Never order food from a dessert place! ?I'm glad I had the chance to check this place out, but unfortunately i dont think i'll be craving kyotofu anytime soon. ?=P

The service was good. My signature tofu was decent, but it had ice crystals in it...which i truly believe that it shouldn't be that way. (Oh, and they also ran out of the blk sesame one :(...). The green tea cupcake was a bit too sweet. The passion tofu cheesecake was on the tart side, but not bad. The green tea brownie tasted just like brownie. Overall, it's not bad. I would go back to try to blk sesame tofu.

Dropped by for dessert the only night--I got three mini chestnut cupcakes and the Boy got a sampler of macarons (I believe he got six different flavors). The chestnut cupcakes were really tasty, but the woman behind the counter accidentally gave me two chestnut cupcakes and one pumpkin. Well, with the recent spate of pumpkin-flavored food items, I've been feeling all pumpkined out and wasn't too pleased to find that I only had two little chestnut bites to enjoy. The Boy's macarons were far too sweet and all tasted the same, other than the black sesame. All in all, we were underwhelmed and are not planning to return.

Kyotofu is an amazing Japanese sugar fantasyland with a delicious array of pastries, sweet tofu, and ice cream. They also have a large tea menu and a more limited savory selection. The ambience is upscale, the staff very helpful, and the prices moderate. You must try the sweet tofu, green tea creme brulee, and the chocolate cupcake (all three are usually included in miniature in the prix fixe sampler). For tea, I recommend the soba-cha. The inner room is beautiful but I prefer to sit at the window-facing barstool counter casually looking at Hell's Kitchen saunter by.

Kyotofu is slightly overrated. Ordered the sampler and tried most of the tapas that they offer, and none of them truly stood out. For dessert I got the Mochi Chocolate cake, which was very gooey and chocolately but no different from any other molten chocolate cake. Not sure where the mochi was either, but the plate was decorated with a smear of green tea pudding. The shortcake of the strawberry shortcake dessert was crumby but not moist (which is what I prefer). I wasn't a big fan of the black sesame tofu nor the ice cream, but that may just not be my sort of thing. I definitely think it was a bit pricey for the less than superb food and small portions. The wait was also very long. The presentation was nice though.

Love. Let me preface this by saying that I am not a dessert person. ?And if I ever do eat dessert, it is usually an egg-based one such as flan, creme brulee, etc. ?Enter tofu. ?The tofu desserts at Kyotofu offer a soft, silky consistency with a not-too-sweet touch of sesame flavoring. ?Absolute perfection. ?And then add in the sweet sake pairing, and I am in heaven. ?One tofu dessert can easily be split between two. I personally wouldn't recommend the dessert sampler as some of the dishes can be misses, especially the green tea chocolates and the green tea creme brulee. ?But if you're feeling adventurous, I'd say go for it. ?My opinion on desserts doesn't usually reside in the majority. ?If you're looking for more savory, I'd definitely recommend the sake-infused mac and cheese. The venue is fairly small so try to keep your party to four max, two preferred. ? One other thing I love about this place.. their small wooden dessert spoons. ?I am obsessed with tiny utensils.

This review is long overdue. Went to NYC to visit family and friends a few weeks ago and went to Kyotofu with a friend who had never been to NYC before. We ordered the desert sampler, which was about $17 for 5 deserts. The deserts were amazing! Such interesting tastes, nothing like I've ever had before. I think my favourite was the sweet potato cake. It was so light and fluffy! I would definitely recommend this place. It really was not too pricey, especially for a restaurant in the city.

A nice cute and cozy place with mouth-watering desserts. Standing between you and the chefs is a glass window so you can actually observe what and how they're making the dishes. Haven't tried any meals here but desserts are quite good even though they're quite pricey. Try vegan valrhona chocolate cake or warm miso chocolate cake if you're there.

We came here for brunch on a Saturday after decidedly not wanting to wait for an hour for the other brunch places we had in mind. ?We entered a small but modern place with a few tables. ?The place was about 75% full. ?We ordered omakase and braised pork belly. ?The omakase had a chicken and tofu slider, silken tofu, pork belly, pickled veggies, sweet potato chips, and something else that I can't remember. ?Sounds like a lot of food right? ?NOT! ?It came all pretty presented in a bento box, and it all tasted great. ?Also it came with bellini/mimosa and both were fine. ?Since this place is known for the desserts, we also ordered the bakery sampler. ?Again, everything was so pretty and dainty and tasted excellent, but seriously after walking for awhile in search of a brunch place, my stomach was still left unfilled. ?Walked a couple of blocks to Briyani cart and left satisfied to go shopping.

I came here on a double date late early Saturday evening and we were seated immediately in the backroom. LOVE the venue. I think it's very trendy but intimate. Between the four of us we shared the black sesame tofu (EXCELLENT), strawberry shortcake (weird with the jelly pieces), chocolate soufle cupcake (tastes like chocolate cake) and the sweet potato cheesecake (good but not spectacular). Go for the black sesame tofu. They don't call it their signature dish for nothing!

Admittedly, I haven't experienced much of menu. ?But I do think it's worth it to plug Kyotofu's "signature" sweet tofu. ?It may not be the most appealing concept, tofu slathered in syrup was gooey and sickly sweet, but it's definitely worth a try when you need a sugar fix.

I love tofu, so when my friend recommended this restaurant I had to include it into our itinerary. This was a fun little stop during our trip to NY, the spaces is cute and trendy and all their tofu is made fresh and on premises :) There is a wide range of choices on the menu, from appetizers to dinner to dinner so there is something for everyone. I remember trying a dish with fresh homemade tofu with a edamame puree and thinking it was delicious. ?Well balanced, not too salty, and the textures and flavors really went well together. A fun spot to make a stop by for a small bite, if not a full meal.

This is a review of the desserts. I had the yuzu cupcake, the chocolate cupcake, and tasted the rose tofu softserve, which was delicate and ethereal. Just lovely. I really enjoyed the cupcakes which were slightly more like muffins than cupcakes but delicious nonetheless with subtle flavoring that made me marvel.

This sheek little restaurant in the Hell's Kitchen district serves up some amazing, but expensive desserts. Although our service was lacking, the food made up for it. We wanted a light dessert to make up for the amount of food we ate during the week. I ordered the black sesame sweet tofu with a sesame sauce. This reminds me of the chinese tofu dessert with a twist. The sesame flavor was subtle and made this tofu dessert really yummy. Although it was good, the prices were pretty steep, so be prepared to shell out some dough for a healthy, light dessert.

Firstly, it is not a place for large number of people, because I came here with 5 other friends and we had to split tables because they only have a few tables there. The ambiance was really nice and calm. However, the dessert was not as good as I expected. Also, the price is quite expensive for a tiny portion of dessert. The tofu dessert was really nice though, well I thought it was a little bit too sweet.

I was excited to hear about this place, as it's right in midtown, and it's a dessert place which means prime date location. ?But the dessert was weird and the exoticness to it didn't really overcome the lack of basic deliciousness. ? They had cocktails available which seemed promising, but the alcohol flavor came out a little too much which is a bit of a dealbreaker. ? The staff was great though when I asked for a second drink and told them I wanted something sweet (but I didn't want to spend too much time on a date looking at the menu). ?The bartender mixed up a lot of fruity goodness in a drink where I couldn't taste the alcohol, but ended up quite tipsy. ?Very nice. ? I would have liked to see more from the desserts, but I'll still probably come back here on a future date for the novelty of it.

4 stars for the dessert, 3 stars for the main course dessert prix fixe was a great deal. for $14 or $16 i was served 3 courses of dessert.on the second course, we had 3 different desserts. they tasted really good and i was amazed that tofu was the main ingredient. the sweet tofu was just like flan, the ice cream was creamy and didn't melt, and the cheesecake yummy. definitely recommend the dessert course. the main course was a selection of 4 different dishes, and though they all tasted good (especially the lotus root, surprisingly tasted like peanut butter), portion sizes were too small. i guess that's what you get if you only pay $16, but the main course was not satisfying enough.

We went here just for dessert before a show. Little candlelit room in back is nice and cozy. We got two coffees, the sweet potato cake, and the warm chocolate cake and it was like 28 bucks with tax...but both were REALLLLLY really good. There is a front dessert bar, too, if you want something quicker. The waitstaff is super super nice. I left my phone on the table, and the waitress came running after me down the street to give it back.

I have wanted to try this place for a while and I've seen it several times on yelp! I have since been twice and it was enjoyable on both occasions. My main interest in this restaurant was for the dessert aspect so I haven't tried any food or anything of that nature. The outside is unmarked except for a small sandwich board so look very carefully for this place. The restaurant is shaped somewhat like a lop-sided I. In the front there is a row of stools along a bar facing the window out to the street which closes off into a narrow hallway flanked on either side by the bar and a small kitchen and opens up again into the dining area. The lighting is low. Seating is along the sides of the dining area with built in rows of seats along the walls, small square tables and then pull out chairs on the other side. The ambiance is pleasant with some forgettable music in the background but the color scheme is very monochromatic (all white) and bare for my liking. They could use a nice centerpiece in the ceiling or some wall decor.... The desserts themselves are different and interesting. I've had the signature sweet tofu, the warm sweet potato cake, and a few others. Everything was very light and textured. Just hints of sweetness. The presentations are clean and neat. If you aren't into soy and other asian flavors/textures, steer clear. ?The price is a little steep considering it's only dessert but it's a nice place to wind down the night if ?you've had an indulgent/heavy meal. The wait staff is average but knowledgeable. On a busy night, you are literally crammed into the narrow space in front waiting for a table - not unlike into a crowded elevator. Overall, a great place - definitely worth a try if you want something different for dessert.

we came here looking for something sweet after dinner. ?After checking out them menu, we split the dessert sampler (it had a japanese name, but I can't remember it) and get the recommended glass of wine. ?It's a very small place, but it has the look and feel of being in Tokyo (my husband can vouch for that, not me). ?Service was kind of slow, but just when we thought we were forgotten, another dessert came out. ?All in all, five desserts in three courses- not too bad for $17! ?I liked the sweet tofu withe black sesame sauce, and Jason liked the green tea tofu cheesecake. ?The wine/beer/sake menu was quite nice as well- lots of options and descriptions for someone like me who doesn't know all that much about sake ( I just know I like it....perhaps too much on occassion).

Stumbled in for brunch today. ?Place was pretty packed but luckily they were able to make space for us at the bar and we were seated quickly. ?The brunch plates are in the fair/good range. ?Tried the french toast with shochu coffee syrup and the quiche. ?Again, both good but really just minor opening acts for the sweet headliner to follow. ?Tried the green tea creme brulee and black sesame tofu for dessert. ?The creme brulee was perfect - not overly sweet - with that perfect balance of matcha taste that most green tea desserts lack. ?The black sesame tofu is beyond description at this point (it might just be that it's late and my internal thesaurus has powered off) ?- suffices to say its very good. ?Only wish that the bloody mary that accompanied my meal (which is free with purchase of brunch menu item) was as good as the rest of it.

Each dessert is quite distinctive, so you should go with whatever sounds good to you. ?But I was a big fan of the signature sweet tofu and the matcha green tea creme brulee. ? ?The valrohna chocolate cake was fine, but didn't stand out among chocolate desserts that I've had at other places.

I said I'd yelp... And here it goes... We came here for a private party. And 5mins in, I was extremely disappointed... ?We were told by the waitress there would be a $100 fee on top of the private party fee because we brought our own cake. But it was never mentioned throughout the MONTHS of email convos with the owner... They called the owner and we spoke to the owner about how disappointed we were... NOT only did SHE NOT try to solve it with us, she told us that if we knew ANYTHING about the NY regulations, we'd know that there would be a fee to bring outside food... We're paying you the private party fee, you could've gone half half with us... 10mins into the convo, the owner says it's actually a $30 fee.. SO... where the hell did the waitress come up with $100???? We'd happily pay the fee IF she didn't throw that NY regulation crap at us... I mean, you can't possibly make $515 out of those friggin desserts in 3hrs, so they are actually making money from us but they have to be so hard headed... So if you EVER decided to throw a party here, I'd advise you to get EVERYTHING in writing and ASK every little question!!!!!!! So watch them find 10-20 of their own friends to write some good reviews just to top mines.... I would NEVER EVER recommend ANYBODY to come here....

The desserts are divine. The other food is really good too. Definately get the dessert 3 course sampler. If you get one thing for sure try their sweet tofu with black sugar syrup, its custardy in constancy and suprising in so many ways, me being a custard freak i absolutely loved this :) ?But seriously this place is the real deal. Its extremely refined in that all these french techniques in making desserts are expertly fused with japanese flavors, but still maintaining a small cozy non-pretentious cute atmosphere! they have a bakery in the front also if you want to just get some things to go, i've been really wanting to try there macrons. ;)

This wasn't as good as I wanted it to be, I love tofu desserts. ?I had a dessert sampler and a quiche. ?they make the best tofu cheese cake I have ever had. ?All the other desserts; fruit agar gel, miso chocolate cake and cookies were all just okay. ?I actully think that the cookies aren't really that good, and I have made my own okara cookies many times, they can be much moister and yummier than what I had here. ?The quiche is a bummer because it could be really good, but it is just so small and mostly crust. ?I don't eat quiche for the crust, they could really make it better by making the tofu part of the quiche more substantial and then you could actually taste it. ?To summarize: go for the tofu cheese cake and the atmosphere, it's real classy.

Kyotofu might be the perfect place for afternoon tea with some girl friends, but i would not recommend it for dinner. ?Their selection of healthy desserts is great. ? I had the Prix Fix dessert course, and my favourite might be the soy base coconut/chocolate ice cream. ?Besides that, the Miso Chocolate cake was awesome as well. ?A drink that caught my attention on the menu was the Chocotini, which is served warm in a martini glass. ?It has hot chocolate w/ Japanese vodka. ?As sweet and yummy as it was, if you are not careful with those, you might just have one too many... ? My friend and I made the mistake of starving ourselves all day to go Kyotofu for dinner. ?We had the 8-Otsumami Sampler, which had bite size portions of each of the Japanese that were on the menu. ?Quantity wise, it was perfect, maybe even a bit too much food for the 2 of us. ?Frankly, it not the most tasty Japanese tapas i have had. ?Tho the presentation and the ingredients were definitely very innovative, with the whole healthy theme going. Since i have always wanted to try out this joint, it was a good experience, but now i know to have dinner elsewhere before coming here for dessert. ?Oh, one more thing, the service was great and the wait staff were very friendly and cute! ?;)

Went here for brunch last Saturday and it was pretty darn good. Definitely not five stars (or four for that matter) and I don't know if I'd rush back, but I liked it. I had the warm mushroom salad and my friend had the truffled toast with eggs. Both good. Really, we went for the desserts. We ordered the "best cupcake in NY" according to NY Mag and the strawberry shortcake. Unfortunately, the best cupcake in NY was not the best cupcake in NY. I mean, honestly, how can a cupcake be the best cupcake without frosting? Honestly. The strawberry shortcake was a winner though--by far the highlight of the meal. It also came with a delicious strawberry sake sorbet. We licked that bowl clean (literally). Pretty darn good, but not mind-blowing (which I have come to expect from NY brunch/dessert).

This place is awesome for desserts and tea. It is definitely good for a date. There is a cute sit down area in the back, a little tight - I listened to my vapid neighbors discuss the merits of snorting cocaine, BUT upside is - if you get seated next to someone intelligent you might find yourself striking up a delightful conversation. As for the food, I tried the lavender tea which was good!!! I tried the green tea creme brulee which was delicious - a little sweet, but still good. I also sampled my friend's sign black sesame sweet tofu - I actually preferred it over my own because it was less sweet - to each his own, right? I would definitely come back here again because they have sake, tea, food and dessert all in one sitting. Would recommend for dates or catch-ups. Might want to make reservations, seems it gets a little busy in here.

The perfect end to a birthday evening! Friday night means a bit of a wait but the four of us managed to snag a seat at the bar. We were still very well attended by the staff and had our waters refilled as needed. It was my friends birthday and I managed to pull aside the waitress and ask if they did candles in cakes to celebrate and was assured they did and asked for my friend's name. The desserts came out BEAUTIFUL and they even brought out a second plate with a mini cake and happy birthday written on the plate. She even got my friends complicated name spelled right! We all shared bites and could not decide who had the best! My order was the matcha green tea creme brulee and it was incredible. The nice thing about it too was it wasn't overly heavy the way creme brulee can sometimes be so I could eat it alllll without any guilt! (or at least less guilt!) ?I really can't wait to go back and enjoy more desserts!

Went here on a Saturday night for snacks, this is a place that knows great customer service. ?When we arrived there was a bit of a wait, which was fine, the restaurant was tiny. ?However, after waiting a while, we inquired as to how much longer our table was going to be. ?The waitress the told us that they had already called our name, and then lectured us on how it was our fault that we hadn't heard us and now we would have to wait longer for a new table. ?Except wait, we haven't left the counter, and are the only ones waiting? ? I sat down feeling pretty annoyed, but amazingly I left feeling really impressed. ?Not only did the waitress come over and apologize for the mix up as soon as we were seated, they gave us a little pack of mini cupcakes on the house as well. ?It's such a small, easy gesture, but goes a long way to making your customers happy! ?And of course, the food was great, coffee was excellent, and the soundtrack rocks. ?I'd definitely consider going back.

I ate here last Friday and had a GREAT time. I arrived at 6pm which was perfect, since people started spilling in around 7pm. The photos make the space look larger than it is. Seating was a little tight. This is a cute date night or great for dessert with friends. I had the tsukune (chicken meatballs) and they were delicious. Then, the anmitsu with ice cream (you can choose your flavors), coffee dango cubes and other delicacies hidden inside. It was a nice surprise to have desserts that are not too sweet and just enough without making you regret what you just did. I didn't get a lot of food (focus is more on presentation) but it was all delicious! The service was very good and you have a view of the kitchen. It took a while for the items to come out though, but I'm glad since the chef took his time to create an edible piece of art. I will definitely be going back!

This is a great place for dessert with a girlfriend or a place to come with a date. The ambiance is great. The soymilk ice cream was nice and fluffy. Very light. When I took the first bite, it tasted as if it was not sweet enough to be a dessert but after a few bites, you start to appreciate it not being too sweet. I enjoyed it very much and it had a yummy whipped cream and plum sauce on the side that compliment it very well. The pomegranate shiso mojito was very good too but I don't recommend ?having it after the dessert as it will taste very bitter. To top it off, the bill came with a green tea cupcake that was delectable.

Came to this place with my boyfriend, and thought it was ehh okayy. We selected the 5 item dessert omakase (chef's dessert selection in mini form-$17). It came with green tea creme brule, green tea fudge bars, vanilla sweet tofu, poached apples with soymilk rice pudding, and warm chocolate cake with miso mochi. Now, the dessert was beautifully prepared and tasted great, but this is not a place I would come running back to. I don't know if it was because of the miniature portions or what-not, but I did not leave feeling satisfied with the desserts. I kinda wish I listened to other Yelpers and tried the Black Sesame Tofu and the Pistachio Creme Brule. Ironically, I sat across a woman with the Black Sesame Tofu, and she definitely looked like a regular as she sat alone pleasantly reading a book. Maybe I'll come back to try it. As for the sampler, it was mehh. It was delicious, but not amazing. Regardless, it's a really cute place and prices are decent.

kyotofu specializes in soy-based desserts... i tried a little bite of every ones plates.. it was pretty good, although i do agree some of the flavors dont really mesh well..not to say they were disgusting... my 4 star reasoning is because of the sake flights and beer selection!!! the sake flights were awesome!!! price ranges from 23-30$, but well worth the experience!!! another note is they serve my fav beer, hitachino, from japan!!! i love the white ale and red rice, but they offered one i had never seen... ginger beer...not my fav but very interesting... i give props just for having it on the menu!!! the atmosphere is cozy and it is a great place to stop after you have had a wonderful dinner....

Ok, so I cheated on my short-lived healthy diet only after 4 days. BUT, don't judge me yet because the good thing is, I cheated in style and opted for something healthier instead of my usual high-caloric desserts. Besides, it's not like I totally gave up on my diet yet! I just needed a little break, you know what I mean?? ?In order to satisfy my sweet craving without completely ruining my healthy diet, ?I decided to go to Kyotofu, a restaurant known for its tofu-based desserts. If it weren't for my diet, I probably wouldn't have picked this place. However, having deprived myself from decent sweets for 4 days, I have regained a new appreciation for these wonderful tofu-based desserts. I didn't realize how tasty tofu can be. And it's almost guilt-free!! That's fantastic, isn't it?? ?For the first time I tried their signature sweet tofu which was so silky smooth, refined, and delicious and the sweet syrup elegantly complimented it! If all tofu were prepared like this all the time, I can eat this everyday!! Mmmmm!!! Their macarons were "meh", but their green tea tofu cheesecake had a nice complex flavor which was interesting in a good way. The accompanying black sesame ice cream on top of the cheesecake definitely enhanced the tasting experience! It wasn't rich and heavy like a normal cheesecake but gave me enough satisfaction to enjoy the healthier alternative. That's 5 star worthy for people like me suffering from serious weight gain and high cholesterol!! Now I feel sooo much better and happier. Thank you Kyotofu! Arigato!!

Cocktails and desserts are the way to go here, no matter what time of day. Its fine to have cake in the morning if it comes with green tea and is made out of tofu. The savory food I have experienced have not totally been worth it, either too tiny or not so pleasant tasting. But moving on, the cocktail menu is creative. I love the signature Kyotofu with raspberry, mint, and white sesame shochu and I am sure it tastes even better when its half-off during the happy hour. The famous miso chocolate cake is perfectly complemented by the bitter green tea cream, it shocks your palette. The dessert sampler is a really great and adorable thing to share with your boo. We had the 5 item dessert brunch selection with rich chocolate souffle cupcake, a unique cheesecake, the soothing sweet tofu, the odd anmistsu which is most likely ?a dessert they eat on mars, and the perfect choc and vanilla soft serve with mochi. It was a great combination of flavors. ?The place can be a little expensive but many items are worth it. although we were advised otherwise, the teas could easily be shared if you are only interested in a cup or two. The space is pretty and they have a clean looking open kitchen. If I were a guy, I would take my dates here.

i love this place! the desserts are yummy. the decor is very simple. minimalist even. i came here tuesday night for drinks and dessert after work with a friend. the desserts were yummy! as were the drinks! i'm a lightweight so i only had one...the tropical rokku. it was a cocktail of mango, something, something, and something sochu. very tasty. they have a nice selection of sake if cocktails and wines just don't do it for you. and for a small appetizer, we shared the otsumami sampling plate...tasty as well. and very well presented. the dessert, obviously, was the highlight of the evening. i had the chestnut mochi chocolate cake with green tea cream and fig something. all very tasty. and the best part of it was that, i didn't feel like such a large farm animal afterwards! no guilt! ta-da! and i love all the smells in this place. definitely very heart-warming, despite the decor. i definitely will venture back...now only if it were closer to where i lived...

it was an eye-opening place, simple decorations with fantastic desserts. the appetizers are on the so-so side but the desserts are over the top. i was a bit sick when i went there with my friends but the desserts made me forget abt everything, it just melts in your mouth. with that first taste, boy do i feel like the luckiest person on earth. i had the chocolate souffle cupcake paired with the sweet tofu, its a great compliment and the tofu was only $3 more, totally worth it!

After 3 or 4 years of being open, this is still my favorite dessert spot in the city. ?Maybe b/c I'm a proud tofu lover. ?I have been here with the boy, been here with the girl friends, been here with family, been here with everyone... and never am I disappointed! ?Most recently, I went with a friend who was visiting from out of town. ?He was a half hour late (2 years out of the city makes you forget how long subway rides can take), but the hostess graciously let me sit in the counter area of the restaurant to wait. ?So I ordered myself a pot of lilac tea and did some people watching through the big floor to ceiling window in the front... makes for a pleasant afternoon, actually. ?When he arrived, we were brought to our table in the main dining area and although packed, the noise level wasn't obnoxiously loud. ?We ordered the chef's tasting plate. ?Some people may complain that the desserts are a bit overpriced for their portion size, but I think it is comparable, or even larger, than other dessert bars in the city. ?Also, if you love tofu as much as I do, you wil be dazzled by the creativity of some of the dishes. ?Some of my favorites include the black sesame sweet tofu and the green tea matcha cheesecake. ?Plating is always beautiful... you're going to deconstruct what is what when you get it, because there are so many ingredients or parts that go into one of the dishes. ?I've noticed they keep expanding their menu and now serve regular, non-dessert food. ?Have yet to try it, but the sake-infused macaroni and cheese sounds interesting. ?Next time!

The quality of the desserts at Kyotofu is very good. I shared a black sesame dessert with my wife and it had a very simple, clean taste. They have a neat little kitchen in the front where you can actually see the kitchen staff assembling the dishes. The decor is also very nice and modern, with dim romantic lighting. My wife's friend went to high school with one of the owners, which was also pretty cool. The main downside to Kyotofu is its capacity (or lack thereof). There's very little seating, which translates into a long wait time during busy periods. This problem is compounded by the fact that there is also very little room to stand while waiting for your seat. Both the wait staff and the patrons have to walk through a fairly narrow passage to get into the main dining area, which can cause a bit of a bottleneck. Hopefully Kyotofu will do well enough that it can eventually move to a bigger location.

We got here around 6pm on a Thursday and there were only seats at the bar in the front which was fine. ?We ordered a hummus which was good and bento boxes which were not. ?The mushroom salad that was the first thing to come out after the hummus was probably the best thing we had. ?It took about an hour before we received that salad. ?An hour or so after that, we got our bento boxes. ?They had some interesting items in there but nothing that I would order again. ?They had unagi wrapped in phyllo dough, sausage wrapped in something, a chicken tofu slider, and meatballs. ?There were a lot of strange meats in there. ?Why, in a restaurant called Kyotofu, do they not include some tofu in their bento box? ?Since it took so long to get the rest of the food, we were hesitant to get dessert, but I heard dessert was the best part so we ordered the creme brulee. ?We mentioned we were in a hurry and they said it shouldn't take long. ?Who knows how long later, the creme brulee came out. ?I have no idea why it would take so long since it is a cold dish and they only had to brulee the top. ?All in all, the food was ok. ?If you go, stick to the dessert and know that the service is unbelievably slow.

after my sister and i had dinner at totto ramen the other day, we passed by kyotofu, which was only a few blocks away. we were already really full from dinner, but we decided to have dessert there since we were already there. best decision ever!! we were way too stuffed for our own good by the end of the night, but it was totally worth it. we ordered two desserts to share, thinking that it would be just enough since fancy dessert places usually have small portions. but kyotofu, despite its upscale ambience, does not fall into that stereotype. we ordered the white sesame-chocolate swirl sundae, which came in a pretty large bowl (comparable to a large pinkberry/red mango cup!). it also came with matcha mochi, pocky, brownie crumbs, and strawberries, which sound like really strange toppings, but actually went really well with the soft-serve ice cream. the white sesame was really yummy, and had a distinct flavor. the second thing we ordered was the green tea creme brulee, which came with a small scoop of sorbet (i couldn't tell what the flavor was...it was good, but really tart). it came in a ramekin that was a little larger than usual. the creme brulee was creamy and pudding/mousse-like, with a crunchy crystallized sugar layer on top. not your typical creme brulee texture, but still good! it's rich though, so i wouldn't be able to eat the entire thing myself. so overall, kyotofu may be a bit pricier than other dessert places, but it's it's worth it for the quality and uniqueness of their menu. it's also a nice place to sit (although the seating area is very small, so you may have to wait in line if you go late), and the portions are decent. i'd like to try their savory lunch/dinner menu sometime!

Beautiful and small interior best for 2 people parties. ?The one page menu has a number of interesting but relatively pricy desserts (~$10). ?The tofu cheesecake was surprisingly good with a thick crust and others loved the black sesame sweet tofu. ?The not so impressive were some of the sides such as the yokans and the green tea anko cream both of which were very weakly flavored (approaching nothingness). ? Although everything was good (except for the grainy wafer underneath the ice cream), nothing was like "wow!". ?At this price point, we should be seated comfortably and not have all 5 of us crammed into 2 small tables without an extra chair. ?Although our hostess was polite and friendly, our server was a young Japanese female wearing a headband and a you-should-be-honored-to-be-served-by-me attitude. ?So unfortunately ?I definitely would not recommend this place for your out-of-town guests and probably you yourself will suffer from boredom on a second visit. (3 - 1 (service) = 2 stars)

A cute place for cute little Japanese cute-sized cute things. Like matcha cupcakes and chocolates, mini sliders, miso-flavored what-nots, and such. They refer to this as a Japanese dessert bar, and you clearly should, too, if you're trying to impress an after-theater date (why else are you in Hell's Kitchen?), because "Japanese dessert bar" sounds cool. You can also show off how much money you have, because the prices here are quite outrageous, however much deliciousness they pack into their little literally bite-sized nuggets of Kyoto nouveau flavor. There's a nice selection of sakes, and you can takeaway most items from the little bakery counter up front. Seating in the back is limited, so you may end up at the front window, which is less cool if you're doing the whole richy-rich "I know a Japanese dessert bar" shtick. Certainly a unique business for New York and worth making a slight detour to visit, especially for Japan nostalgics and matcha lovers.

wow, kyotofu has changed so much since it first opened! there are dinner options, desserts to take away, even fro yo -- it's become more of a destination place. ?the nice desserts are affordable, under $10 and specially plated and thoughtfully made. the black sesame tofu was exquisite and the soft serve pumpkin & green tea sundae with mochi, chocolate cake, fruit compote and POCKY was wonderfully presented, tasty, and way too much food. i loved it. ?at the end of dessert we also received complimentary cookies. ?it makes sense why kyotofu has survived since its opening.

Kyotofu is a gem! ?I was in NYC this past weekend and visited twice. ?My first visit was late on Thursday night. ?We ordered the chicken and tofu sliders, kurobuta sausage and the housemade tofu off the savory menu. ?The presentation was lovely with fresh plam leaves and wood dishes and minimalistic plates that fit the decor of the restaurant. ?After we tried the chocolate souffle cupcake with a frosting that was absolute magic, the strawberry shortcake and the frozen maple soy parfait. ?Everything we tasted was light, flavorful and delicious. ?The desserts were pieces of art! I loved it all so much I went back on Sunday for their brunch. ?I had the french toast and my boyfriend had the souffle. ?The coffee shochu sauce was incredible! They should bottle that stuff up!

The richest, creamiest, yummiest frozen yogurt in Hells Kitchen...and maybe the entire city! It's made from soy and tastes like nothing else I have ever had before.

Went there today (May 16, 2009) in the evening and was very excited to experience the food there. However, the waiter there was soooooooo slow. Please acknowledge the pain I went through. The service was horrendous, and there was literally one server there who was taking orders for take out, and also taking orders for those that were dining in. I mean if you are charging the food so expensively, why can't you use that money to hire more staff? The food was good (but was not the best I have eaten). The desserts were good. I highly recommend the chocolate souffle cupcake (very velvety texture). However, if you want great desserts I rather spend the money on CHIKALICIOUS (and the service there is top notch). In addition, the worst part was that there was a gigantic cockroach crawling on the floor and the staff does not do anything about it. Last but not least, I literally had to get up and ask them for my check after I asked them politely for one 20 minutes ago!

well - if pricy minimal desserts are your thing - then by all means go for it. this is the kind of place you go when you want to look pretentious to an out of town guest. the food is minimal and presentationally beautiful - the sake selection is great and the teas are to die for - but the price - omg - nearly $50 for 2 people to have simple desserts tea and a thimble of sake. wow - go to splurge - it's worth the trip - but it'll break the bank if you make a habit out of it.

It is true that the place is hard to find since it has no obvious signs, I passed by it twice and still missed it. The place was really cute but mabbie a little small if you have a huge group of people. The cupcakes are so chocolaty. (Good for me cause I love all kinds of chocolate) The people there was really nice. There was some group event going on but they still gave us a table anyway. I ordered a sesame pudding and they gave me a miniature cupcake with a birthday candle on it. (It was very sweet of them)

this place made me feel like i was in a little space pod in the future-very cool interior, all white and minimal. their drink menu was long and i stuck with the judy tini which was tasty but didn't pack too much of an alcoholic wallop, or maybe just not enough for my boozing ass. we tried a couple of the desserts-like the black sesame pudding (brulee?) that had a very intriguing flavor, but i simply could not get beyond the too-liquidy consistency. the little mini chocolate casserole/cupcakey things are absolutely glorious, however, and their green tea counterparts are pretty yummy as well. i also had a tofu/chicken slider that at first had an interesting flavor but left behind a strange, oceanic aftertaste. the little caribou pigs-in-sesame-blanket doo-dads fared much better and proved to be the big winner of the night. this is a cute place to hop into if you happen to be in hells kitchen, for sure.

cute and trendy restaurant. ordered the mac&cheese--came with a salad which was pretty good, but sesame oil with anything is pretty good. the mac&cheese was decent. i couldnt find anything else to order on the menu that caught my eye...which was weird because im not a big fan of mac&cheese anyway. nonetheless, dessert was more important to us and so we ordered a chocolate cupcake (based on the waitress' esteemed recommendation--i wanted to try the sesame cupcake because it sounded unique but she STRONGLY suggested chocolate), white sesame cake, and green tea creme brulee. the white sesame cake was not good, IMO it had ths cornbread kind of texture. the chocolate cupcake came with some ice cream and berry preserve, but not the best cupcake ive ever had. considering they were rated "best cupcake of 2007" by zagat, i was not even slightly impressed. HOWEVER, i must give this restaurant five stars because i was simply blown away (and thats an understatement) by the green tea brulee. it wasnt too pudding-like, nor too watery...it had this sugary layer of crunch on top, i could have ate a gallon of it this brulee. i would say, it had a party in my mouth. amazeballs. do try the creme brulee.

we had the rooibos tea and tangerine/ginger sencha. ?both were great. ?i preferred the rooibos. ?we got the prix fix dessert - 3 courses and 5 samplers for $17. ?miso chocolate cake was a bit spicy and we loved that, especially with a splash of raspberry. ?the cheesecake, i can highly highly highly recommend. the choc/hazelnut tofu sorbet was fabulous with the tofu mochi on top (i really liked the mochi). ?the todu custard with molasses on top was great as well. ?the gelatin stuff with a plum and pistachios (grinded and bottom of a cup) was really weird and the party didn't like that at all. ?everything was amazing (tofu, protein so no sugar crashes after) for a dessert! ? nothing was too sweet, just right. ?they had a great selection of sake as well. ?and they do do sake flights. ?they are having a $95 new years special. ? we saw quite a few flies in the back dining area (especially evident with the white couches and light colored walls), the service was very prompt and great. ?it was quiet, great music and overall a perfect experience if there were no flies. ?perfect for two. ?there was seating for (in groups of 4) 32 in the back room. ?and would be tight if there were all couples because the tables were aligned in pairs (for 4 people). would definitely go back again!

This place is delicious while the staff was attentive and accommodating. I went last night at 11:30 pm with 9 other friends. We called ahead to make sure they could take us, and they were welcoming. We had the pear streusel, the molten chocolate cake and then strawberry shortcake. They were all delicious. The pear streusel was flavorful and rich without being too sweet. The pears were cooked perfectly and were not mushy. The chocolate cake was rich and decadent, but stayed true to the cacao flavor, instead of stomping it out with an overabundance of butter and sugar. The strawberry shortcake was delicious as well, light and airy, as would be expected. I tasted a friends sweet tofu, and it is just that, sweeten tofu. I wouldn't suggest that given the other amazing dishes on the menu. They also have alcoholic drinks that are tasty. I hear that brunch here is good to. I'm already planning my return.
