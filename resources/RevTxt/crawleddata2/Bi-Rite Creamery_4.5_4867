I've been wanting to check out Bi-Rite Creamery for ages. I'm glad I finally got a chance to come here. Don't think, just make sure you get the salted caramel! It was my favorite flavor by far. It's just such a unique flavor. I also had the mint chip and tried a bite of my husband's coffee. Both were also excellent. If you get a single, they let you pick two flavors. If you get a double you can pick 3. This place is pretty small with crappy parking and a line out the door. But it was worth the half an hour wait. I would say this is the best ice cream place in SF!

Our first time here, but I've heard so many good things about this place (by my fam and friends, and from food TV), I didn't even mind waiting in that long ass line! It took about 30 minutes, but the weather was perfect and there was lots of people watching to be had, so it was all good. The place was claustrophobic small, but everyone behind the counter were super friendly. Huge crowds of people are of course nothing new to them. I picked up a bag of oatmeal apricot coconut cookies before I stepped up to order my ice cream. I tasted the ricanelas (very good), but I already knew I was getting a double scoop of salted caramel, toasted coconut, and roasted banana on a cake cone. OMG. Pure wonderfulness. We parked a ways away (parking is a biatch), and my cone was devoured by the time we got back to the car. They sell their flavors by the pint or quart, and if that's all you're getting, you don't have to wait in line for those. Score! Shoulda brought an ice chest...next time I'll be ready!

I think this creamery is a little overrated. Whenever I come to Bi-Rite, the line is so long. Once, I was in a rush so I went to the little shop next to Bi-Rite and got the Bi-Rite soft serve instead, which was really smooth. The flavors were chocolate and vanilla, and that cup they gave me quickly became empty! The only thing I didn't like was that they gave me a flat wooden spoon. I don't know, I just don't like wooden spoons for some reason. Ê I've tried the salted caramel, honey lavender, and coconut here. The salted caramel was not for me. It is a chemical reaction in your mouth. It starts out tasting normal, and then BAM it's salty. Then you have this burnt wood taste in your mouth that lingers until you try a new flavor or drink some water. Honey lavender is good though. I actually have not tried the coconut, but my sister and mom LOVE it. They finished a pint of it in a day!

Hit the spot after eating Indian. ÊHardly a line around 7:15pm. Kudos to the staff. I've been holding on to a gift card. ÊThey switched to a new computer system which meant my gift card was no longer in sync. They converted it to the latest one and COMP our cones tonight for our inconvenience. ÊNow that is customer service. And I especially enjoyed my ice cream tonight. ÊHoney lavender and balsamic strawberry on a sugar cone. ÊHubby had the brown sugar.

Holy Bleep Batman!!! This place is so good. I am somewhat lactose intolerant (Ice cream usually leads to my butt screaming), but I would torture myself for this stuff. My travel buddies and I knew that this place had made it to yahoo's top ice cream places in the U.S. and with my husband and sister (two of the top ice cream aficionados in our family), we went there approximately 3 hours after we had gotten into town. I usually feel like I order the perfect thing on the menu, but I was wrong on this day. I thought, let me do vegan ice cream as to not upset the beast that lives in my stomach, and although it was decent (FYI Austin's Lick makes the best vegan ice cream I have ever tasted in case your in this area) I was green with envy when I tasted my husband's and sister's incredible choice. My sister's was a lavender ice cream while my husband's was a vanilla and both were topped with an orange olive oil and sea salt. My hubby's was this sophisticated orange creamsicle which haunted me. ÊIt made my vegan coconut chocolate choice seem like a tragic ice cream scoop falling to the floor. I should have thrown it to the floor and walked back into the ice cream store and ordered what they had. But I didn't. Instead, I hoped that we would go back, but we didn't. Every where I went, every store on our road trip (from San Fran to Seattle) I looked for this elusive orange olive oil in hopes to replicate this dream. I did find the book that has some of their recipes, but not the oil. I did however find a place that sells something similar. See my reviews for more info. But if you live there and don't go, I believe that you never really lived life.

After dinner, some friends and I sought out some ice cream. Humphry's was closed so we made our way over to Bi-Rite which wasn't too far away by car. It was about 10 minutes to closing and the line for Bi-Rite ice cream was way too long. We worried about not being able to get a scoop so we walked over to the little stand next to it that serves little desserts and soft-serve. I've had their soft serve only once before because I generally prefer getting a new flavor from the variety they have in the creamery. They only have two flavors available for soft-serve. Today was vanilla and salted caramel which is what I had last time. I wasn't complaining. I got a cone of a salted caramel and vanilla swirl for $3.50 and a cookie for .75 cents. I forgot what kind I got but it was chocolate with some chewy bits. The swirl they gave me was huge so it was totally worth the $3.50. My roommate got a kids size for $2.50 and it was impressive in size as well. The cookies are pretty cheap considering the flavor options they have available. The quality is pretty good too. I say grab one while you're up. I want to try their other little desserts too (cupcakes, etc). Maybe on a day when they're serving soft serve flavors I haven't had before.

Lady Luck smiled down on me one Saturday afternoon when I spontaneously decided to try Bi-Rite Creamery for the first time. OK, I was actually going to Dolores Park anyway to meet a friend, but whatever. I have a weakness for frozen desserts and hadn't had a scoop of rich, creamy, homemade ice-cream in weeks. My reluctant boyfriend warned me repeatedly that there would be a line and that I should prepare to wait at least 30-40 min. Ha! Nuts to him! :P There wasn't a single soul in the store. I literally skipped and danced my way up to the counter (I get a little loopy when I'm sugar-deprived), much to the amusement of the manager. With no other customers breathing down my neck, I was able to sample every flavor that intrigued me, and Bi-Rite, being one of those NON-soulless corporate ice-cream chains, had the kinds of unique flavors I love: subtle, mildly sweet and naturally derived from either flowers, spices or herbs. (To give you an idea of what I mean, my three favorite ice-cream flavors are saffron, olive oil and lavender. I know--I sound like a pretentious hippie.) The honey lavender was sweet but lacking in substantial lavender flavor. The basil was incredibly fragrant and delicious, as well as a gorgeous light green color. My boyfriend, who is always skeptical of my "hippie" flavors (despite the many times he's tried them and admitted they were good), raised an eyebrow when I told him he had to try the basil. "How can an herb taste good as ice-cream?" he protested. Because Bi-Rite says so, that's how. Two seconds later, he was not only eating the basil, he was eating his words. The olive oil has the right amount of EVOO flavor but is not quite sweet enough, in my opinion. The balsamic strawberry is tasty but probably not something I'd ever buy. And finally, the white chocolate raspberry (boyfriend's pick) is very rich and very sweet, perfect for people who don't do "hippie" flavors. The place was absolutely packed by the time I was done sampling and by the time I had paid, there wasn't room to stand let alone sit. If you ever find yourself in this predicament, have no fear. Dolores Park is just a couple of blocks down and there are lots of benches there.

I FINALLY got to try Bi-Rite after reading about it all of these years. ÊI have also gone to Humphrey Slocombe that's nearby. ÊI like Humphrey Slocombe's better for the inventiveness of the flavors which are constantly changing. That said, we got there at 615pm on cloudy/drizzly August Saturday. ÊDespite it being dinner time, the line was around the corner and took about 45 mins to an hour. ÊREALLY, FOR ICE CREAM??? Ê Between the 4 of us, we tried the Ricanelas (cinnamon ice cream w crushed Snickerdoodle), Coffee Toffee, Salted Caramel, Roasted Banana, Toasted Caramel, Malty Vanilla and the Ginger Caramel one (forgetting the name). Ê All were really good, but the banana took over the flavors of other things in the cup (coconut and the ginger caramel), so while it was a nice flavor, only get this if you really like banana or you also have other really strong flavors in your cup. ÊOtherwise, just get a taste and skip the actual scoop. Tasting: the 2 servers at the counter were really cute and friendly. They probably would have let us try every single thing if we wanted to and didnt rush any one. ÊThis is probably why the line took so long, Ê A single (1-2 flavors) was $2.50. ÊThe double (2 or 3 flavors) was $3.50. ÊYou can get cones or cups or sundaes. My daughter dropped her cone on the ground so we also tried the Bi Rite soft serve next door. ÊThere was no line and only offered plain boring chocolate or vanilla. ÊEh. there's a reason why there's no line for this... Parking is a pain and on the street. ÊGood luck w that. Ê=)

Omg. GET RICANELAS, it's the best you won't regret it. cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodle cookie chunks? You better believe it!!! I tried some of their other weird flavors but they weren't nearly as noteworthy as the ricanelas. ÊI wish I could buy a whole gallon of ricanelas back home, but I think it would melt by the time I reached san jose :( Yadda yadda, parking sucks, so does the line. This is SF, you better get used to it. I walked from the top of dolores park down to try this ice cream and it was worth every step. I was lucky when I went cause there were only a couple people in front of me but when I exited, the line was out the door and almost around the corner! craziness. I like the portion size they give also, just one scoop for $2.50. Perfection in a cup or cone :)

Worth the wait! While in line for 20 mins, I kept reminding myself Ê"Nearly 5,000 reviews with a 4.5 star rating, this place has to be special!" Oh boy, was it! When you finally come into the shop itself you get a cozy feeling. The hipsters working behind the counter are a friendly bunch and don't hesitate in asking you if you want to take a taste sample. You can taste all the flavors that are on display. They will hand you a metal spoon and you simply discard them on the counter top one at a time as you go through the flavors. I got the single which is either one big scoop of the one ice cream or two smaller scoops of different ice creams. I went with the two different scoops, 'to widened my horizons' and ordered the honey lavender and toasted coconut. Toasted coconut was pretty good. Although the star of the show was the Honey Lavender is creamy in texture and aromatic in scent, that it dances in your mouth. I savored every millisecond of it. Hey they accept card too, that's a plus. After getting my ice cream we decided to walk over to Dolores Park and I wondered if if my ice cream would even make it across the street because I was just mowing through. I barely crossed the corner and I was already looking for a trash can to throw away my empty cup. Crazy enough, I thought about crossing the street and jumping back in line to get more ice cream. I'll be back Bi-Rite! Would I be back? This place is now in my to do list whenever I am back in The City.

My boyfriend surprised me by taking me here for some ice cream. We got there at a good time, because soon after the line doubled behind me. The ice cream was definitely worth it. Best salted caramel that I've ever had. I had the home made almond toffee on top and it was the perfect combination. My boyfriend ordered cookies and cream with hot fudge sauce. His was good, but mine was better. After he finished his scoop, he stared at my bowl with sad eyes until I finally felt bad and let him have the last few bites. The only thing I regret is not getting a bigger size. Kids size scoop is not enough.Oh, and If you are looking for a place to eat your ice cream, there is a beautiful park right next to the store!

I would say Bi-Rite is probably my favorite ice cream joint in the city, followed by Humphry's and Mitchell's, why? Bi-Rite has the winning combo, toasted coconut + banana on a cone, makes the worst day the best day! Price wise, Bi-Rite is higher than most ice cream joints. Parking around the area is very tough and the line is usually around the block on warmer days. My suggestion is to come here early or on a colder day, otherwise you'll end up circling around the block for parking, followed by a 30-minutes wait in line.

Came here after getting a sandwich from Ike's Place. There was such a long line (like three separate ones) and it moved pretty slowly, but since every single review has been awesome, I was willing to wait. I got the Cookies n Cream and honestly I wasnt impressed. There was such a weird flavor to it and the ice cream wasn't creamy and rich. It really was nothing special at all. I also tried their famous Salted Caramel, and didn't like it. I like everything caramel but this just didn't taste good at all. The brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl was probably my favorite. I'm only giving them 3 stars because my friends enjoyed their ice cream but I dont think it lived up to the hype at all.

Typical pricing, kinda small portions, friendly service. SUPER LONG line, but very organized about it. They were still taking customers past their closing time. BROWN SUGAR ginger caramel swirl - so delicious, just a deep sweet (but not overly so) that you know comes only from brown sugar. The best brown sugar ice cream I've had so far (some are kind of gritty and taste like actual sugar, but this one is nice and smooth) COFFEE TOFFEE - potent coffee flavor that is well balanced with the sweet toffee chunks. Both flavors go well together also! Tasted my friend's picks - TOASTED COCONUT - is not so much refreshing as just toasted earthy, so it's not a fruity pick if you're expecting that. MALTED VANILLA peanut brittle and milk chocolate - is interesting, peanut flavor permeates even if you don't get a piece of the brittle, didn't taste any of the chocolate.

SOOOOOO GOOD! I don't eat ice cream that often but I've heard about Bi-Rite for so long that I had to try it. My friends and I stopped in after The Color Run SF on a Saturday morning and there was no wait. :) We got a small cup with salted caramel and the fruit sorbet. The fruit sorbet is usually a seasonal so I think we got the watermelon? Sounds like a weird mixture (and it was!) but my boyfriend is lactose intolerant so he tries to limit his ice cream consumption so it worked out fairly well. I really liked both of them! The salted caramel wasn't too sweet and the sorbet tasted really fresh. The small cup ($3.50) was perfect for the two of us who aren't huge ice cream eaters. Can't wait to go back to Bi-Rite to try the other flavors! I also really liked the people that worked there. The girl that helped us was patient and friendly while we tried the different flavors.

After waiting in a loooonnnggg line and watching several people cut in front of me (wasn't in a very confrontational mood this particular afternoon) I was finally at the front, salivating over every single flavor there. I was pretty stressed out considering the extremely difficult decision at hand (single scoop or double scoop? coffee toffee, salted caramel, balsamic strawberry, or brown sugar? three flavors or two??) The combinations were endless, and I was starting to feel overwhelmed. Thankfully the worker behind the counter was understanding and kept on handing me spoon after spoon of different flavors to try (none of that '2 tastes only' bullshit other creameries have). After much deliberation, I decided on the single size on a cone with brown sugar and coffee toffee. Delicious. We decided to enjoy our ice cream cones at Dolores. However, by the time we reached our blankets I had already inhaled my cone of ice cream. Oops. If you're impatient, you can bypass the line and pick up a cake/ sandwich/ pint from the freezer next to the cashier. Will be back!

And this is the story of my first $8 pint of ice cream. I'm eating it as I write this review. Even before I arrived at the creamery I knew what I was going to get: the salted caramel. All these Yelpers love it, so how can I lose? I look at the prices; the price of two cones was almost that of a pint, so why not get the pint of the most popular flavor instead and share it with my friends? That way I get WAY more ice cream! Yay! At the counter I had a few samples of other flavors and was overall pleased with their Êoptions. I then purchased the pint of salted caramel and started on it outside the creamery. Here it comes: the first bite. ACK! I felt like I just got slapped with a bag of sugar. It was way too sweet for my palate, and much sweeter than the other flavors. These Yelpers sure love their sweets. After this experience I pledged to try the flavors before buying them, and I recommend you do the same. The basalmic strawberry and ricanelas are excellent options, and they bring you a more balanced taste experience compared to the salted caramel. tl;dr SALTED CARAMEL MIGHT BE TOO SWEET FOR YOU.

I try to make an effort to stop by Bi-Rite when I'm in the Mission. It's wonderfully located, right by Dolores Park. There's usually always a line, especially on nice days, but it doesn't move too slowly. The ice cream here is delicious - very creamy and rich. There's a few tables inside to sit at, if you wish to sit inside. The flavors here tend to be fairly generic, and nothing too unique (or maybe Humphrey's has just spoiled me). My favorite flavors would be sea salt caramel and the ricanelas. Not much else to say since it seems to have all been said already.

ÊLight and refreshing on a hot day. Strawberry with Balsamic was delicious. A taste combo that some would balk at, but really shouldn't. Ricanelas with snickerdoodle was the oldest kid's favorite.

If you go and see that the line for ice cream is too long (it usually is) go for the frozen yogurt on the side. ÊIt's not quite as good, but it'll still usually satisfy my sweet tooth. ÊThey've got 2 flavors each day as well as a sundae-like mix. ÊThey also have cupcakes and other treats.The ice cream's really what this place is known for though, and I really love it, I just can't stand the huge line you need to wait in to get it usually. Also, this place is literally across from Dolores Park, so it's a pretty nice place to get some ice cream from before taking a walk around the park and enjoying SF. Delicious ice cream, but huge lines, so maybe try the frozen yogurt's shorter line.

I really love this, but one of the things I really liked most about it was that when I used to come before, they would always have a new interesting flavor to try. I liked their ginger and basil flavor, but I don't see it around anymore. They used to at least have a sign to ask for the ginger flavor, but they don't anymore. I don't know if I'm just suppose to ask for it, but next time I'll be sure to try. They also have a bakery a few steps down that also sells soft serve and they used to sell the yummiest ice cream shaped cookies. They had them in different flavors like salted caramel, balsamic strawberry, and I think one other flavor. ÊI don't know why they don't make them anymore, but they should bring them back cuz I miss them! Other than that, the salted caramel soft serve is definitely worth the try. Flavors i would recommend are the salted caramel, brown sugar, ricanelas, earl grey (if they still have it), roasted banana...actually they're all really good haha but these are just a few of my favorites.

After grabbing a sandwich from Ike's a couple blocks away, Bi-Rite was the happy ending for my lunch. As expected, there was a line out the door and onto the sidewalk. I was with a bunch of friends, so the wait didn't seem too long, maybe 20 min max. I was reading some reviews in line, and I had a hard time deciding which flavors to choose since they all sounded so good. The staff is friendly and they'll let you sample anything you want! I tried a few flavors and settled on salted caramel and brown butter pecan. The salted caramel tasted incredible! Strong flavors and the texture was so creamy and satisfying. I would definitely keep getting this flavor every time. I had high expectations for Bi-Rite ice cream, and they definitely lived up to it. I was so amazed by it that as I was walking and eating, I stepped in dog poop. But I didn't care. I was happy. That's how good it was.

I'm actually not that big of a fan of ice cream, so me giving Bi-Rite 5 stars means something! Both my boyfriend and I have heard about this creamery before, so we decided to stop by a few hours before going to dinner. Thankfully there were only a couple people ahead of us in line. I had the white chocolate raspberry swirl and the salted caramel, and my bf had the ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodle bits) and the creme fraiche. Here's how I would rank the four flavors: 1. Ricanelas: DELICIOUS! Probably their best flavor. 2. White chocolate raspberry swirl: It was reaaally good. I would get it again. 3. Salted caramel: Eh, it was alright. 4. Creme fraiche: My boyfriend let me have a taste but considering that I don't even remember what it tastes like, it ranks #4. By the way, a single (2 scoops) is $3.50 and a double (3 scoops) is $5.00. I kind of wanted a double but I didn't want to spoil my appetite for dinner. I should have gotten it anyway, considering how dinner went... but that's a different review. HAPPY BI-RITING!

I've only been here twice. The first time, I was quite intoxicated and don't really remember what flavors I got but what I DO remember is that it was delicious. The second time I went (yesterday), I was completely sober and the experience again, was DELICIOUS. Very short line when we arrived. I sampled the banana mango sorbet and immediately knew that I needed more of it in my mouth. Got a single of the balsamic strawberry (creamy and fresh) and of course the banana mango sorbet (both fruits shone through quite well and both complemented each other to the fullest) I want Bi-Rite now.

This place was good the first 10+ times I went, but it's starting to get boring. They need to bring back the better flavors like Basil or Olive Oil, but what they have is still good though. Everytime I'm here, the line extends around the corner, but I always wait even if it's 40 degrees outside and I shouldn't be eating ice cream. I already spent 20 minutes looking for parking, what's another 20 minutes in line?... Favorite flavors here are the Salted Caramel (it tastes alot like their Coffee Toffee one...so if you feel like going real crazy, switch it up once in a while lol), Basil (it sounds weird, but it's the BEST), Olive Oil (it's like a lighter version of Basil), and Honey Lavender. Brown Sugar and Ricanelas are good too, but Balsamic Strawberry is boring.

When a place has a 4.5 average with close to 5,000 reviews, all I have to say is "respect." The line looks long, but at it's worst it's probably 15 - 20 minutes. The flavors are unique and the prices are reasonable. The strawberry balsamic, honey lavender, toasted coconut, roasted banana, sea salt caramel, etc were all very good. I was also impressed that next door, the sea salt caramel soft serve was just as good and the sour cream chocolate cake was tasty too. It ranks as one of the best ice cream places I've been to and when I'm in the area again I'll be back.

In my continuing quest for the best vanilla ice cream on the west coast, Sweet Rose's Creamery in Brentwood/Santa Monica still wins out. Bi-Rite was good, creamy, dense, ice cream, with some interesting flavors, but overall, I wasn't blown away as I had hoped to be. ÊThey do get major points for having cinnamon ice cream, one of my favorite flavors of all time. It was 10:30 in the morning, so there was no line, but I was glad that I didn't get there later--there's ropes already set up for the lines!

This place is my all time favorite ice cream place. Every time I'm in sf I make a stop here. It's worth the drive, it's worth the line, it's worth it!!! Salted Caramel: a MUST try. It's freaking unbelievable. Brown Sugar w. Ginger Swirl: SO good. i had a double scoop along with the salted caramel & it matched really well together. Honey Lavender: perfectly sweet & floral, so refreshing. I love it! This is a MUST go whenever you're in SF.

I used to buy pints from the Bi-Rite store across the street to avoid the long lines here, but now I realize it is better to get individual scoops here. When I buy a pint, I end up eating the carton in like a day, but getting small scoops here is much better for portion control! All the flavors are delicious. I just had a scoop of their basil ice cream today, and it was diviiiiiiine!

With almost 5000 reviews, i'm sure this place does not need another one but I am in LOVE with this place. this place has by far the best ice-cream I have ever had. On the weekends it is usually packed, so be prepared to wait in line for at-least 30 minutes, but believe me its worth the wait. The best thing to do around here - get a scoop or two, and go soak in the sun at Delores Park! (on the days that it is actually sunny here in San Francisco!)

I thought this place was too hyped up when I first came here... but after multiple visits, I really really like this place! The great quality ice cream here spoiled my taste buds... so now I'm picky about my ice cream. My opinion on some flavors: Salted caramel = too sweet for my taste Roasted banana = pretty good! but nothing super special Balsamic strawberry = not as good as everyone says it is... I prefer regular strawberry ice cream anywhere else Ricanelas = it is cinnamon ice cream with snicker-doodle chunks. THIS IS THE BEST FLAVOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GET THIS ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?!!! Cookies and cream = pretty good! but you can get cookies and cream anywhere else... so that's why you have to get ricanelas!! Honey lavender = I don't know why people like this flavor in general. I don't really like it... Expect a line!! And eat your ice cream at the very top of Dolores Park (if you can resist finishing your ice cream before getting to the top)!!!

I don't get the hype about this place... came here on a SF foodie adventure and stopped by Bi-Rite and Humphrey Slocombe for ice cream. After looking up yelp reviews, I went with the roasted banana and balsamic strawberry ice cream. And to be honest, the flavors aren't anything spectacular. I tasted no balsamic in the strawberry and think it's all placebo. Yes, the roasted banana tastes like banana, but it's only "unique" because no one ever flavors ice cream like banana! So... taste wasn't anything spectacular. What about texture / creaminess? It was again nothing out of the ordinary. In fact, I think the creamy / melty ratio that I personally like is much better achieved by store-bought ice cream like Dreyer's. For gourmet ice cream, I much rather prefer Ici (in Berkeley) for both flavor and texture, and Humphrey Slocombe for it's eclectic flavors. A note on the service though, they are phenomenal! We came in a party of 7 and they let us try all different kinds of flavors and were very patient with us. It just so happened that the store was completely empty at that time, then like 20 people came in all of a sudden. So take the above with a grain of salt because it wasn't busy at the time.

Much props to them and their workers. The line can be quite long (it's worth the wait) yet they can maintain excellent customer service without rushing customers or dropping their energy level. Balsamic Strawberry & Roasted Bananas -The strawberries tasted and felt fresh and the bananas tasted organic. The fusion itself went well. Usually bananas can be a dominant taste but there was great balance between the two. Sustainability efforts-Every time I go to an ice cream shop usually I do have the privilege to sample and when I do I use about 3 small PLASTIC spoons. Here, you use metal spoons. Overall: 5 stars for its overall efforts. Community building, efforts towards sustainability, charming customer service, unique and amazing ice cream: Win. It doesn't get any better. Thank you Bi-Rite for all that you do.

The food: There are ice cream shops galore in the bay area, but Bi rite stands out amongst them. Go to Ici for the gourmet, Humphrey Slocombe for the weird, but Bi rite for just good, down home, unique and tasty treats. My personal favorites are the strawberry balsamic, burnt caramel, or chocolate but they do a decent honey lavender and other tastes as well. Foodtv has featured their Sam's sundae, which is something to try for the daring. The good: Bi rite is reliable for pretty excellent ice cream. It has more of a homemade feel with the hearty flavors, but it's still gourmand enough to be truly worth each scoop. The bad: Where Bi rite excels in its tasty homemade-ness is also it's downfall; if you're looking for a gourmet experience, head to Ici's on the east bay. But that's not to hate- I still love it here! Ambiance: friendly servers who generously offer samples, but only a few crammed in booths; you'll end up eating your ice cream on the go or on the street- or maybe head across to the park to enjoy! Very neighborhood ice cream shop. What to know: sample before you buy! Don't be afraid to try things that are different, like the olive oil drizzled Sam's sundae or basalmic strawberry. Good for: comfort food moments, friends and family In short: Bi rite is the neighborhood ice cream shop elevated a few notches to excellence.

A line wrapped around the block is typical... all day, everyday. Bi-Rite is a staple of San Francisco. Check it out so you can have your own opinion, too! I really only get strawberry (anywhere, even yogurt spots) but I felt extra daring this past weekend... so I got some roasted banana, too! You can get TWO flavors for the price of "one scoop" --- they really just give you two small scoops of each flavor. Cost - $3.50. Pretty fair, I suppose, provided you also get a waffle cone! Head to Dolores Park with your yummy ice cream to be extra hipster and trendy.

First Impressions: 2.5/5. CHRIST, this place is hard to park for and having Dolores Park nearby doesn't help. (Another friend of mine says his default approach when visiting is taking the Muni over instead) The crazy line broken up into 4 long sections to allow better pedestrian flow was the biggest in-your-face sign that screamed this. Luckily, I came with a few determined locals, so they weren't deterred at all. I, on the other hand, almost got carsick from all the aggressive parking space hunting. Ice cream places never really look impressive either (I do like Ici though :X), so I was aware to be on standby till I actually got my ice cream. Ice Cream Flavors Honey Lavender: 2/5. I adore Ici's formula, so I was excited to try BiRite's, but all of my local SF friends were right. Bi-Rite's isn't as tasty. Good to know though. They did mention that they use organic dried lavender and honey from Sonoma, but maybe the flavor extraction isn't at its best... just my humble opinion. Balsamic Strawberry: 3.5/5. I'm almost more in love with the idea of mixing the two flavors and name vs the actual taste of it, but not bad! I'd order it again as my go-to fruity flavor. RICANELES: 4.5/5. My month-long craving for snicker-doodle cookies probably bumped up the rating half a point more, but wow... I also agree w/ other Yelpers that this may be the best flavor they serve. It's the main reason I give this place a 4/5 stars. Random: Another reason I approve of this place is that they use metal tasting spoons to reduce waste, biodegradable cups & spoons when serving, and even make their sugar cones from organic ingredients. Who doesn't appreciate an environmentally conscious business? I certainly do. And how cool is it that their Coffee Toffee ice cream is made from Ritual's coffee? Brilliant. Overall: 3/5 for everything else, but 4/5 just for practically perfecting the Ricaneles experience. I almost gave up visiting because of our bad luck w/ parking, but as an encouragement to other newcomers- hang in there.

It was my second time here overall (totally forgot what I ordered the first time since it was so long ago). For this visit, I purchased a double size (2 large scoops or 3 mini scoops). I choose 3 mini scoops. 1 scoop of the following flavors: SALTED CARAMEL, CREME FRAICHE, and HONEY LAVENDER. I chose SALTED CARAMEL since so many on the Yelp reviews have raved about it. In the end, I blamed myself for not trying a spoon sample first. I'm not sure if it was just that batch for that particular day or if it was really suppose to taste like that, but the flavor I tasted out of the SALTED CARAMEL scoop was burnt caramel. It just tasted like burnt ice-cream (oxymoron, I know) like how if you're trying to boil honey or sugar and you leave it on the stove too long and it gets burnt. To confirm my tastebuds, I had my cousin try it as well and she agreed, it tasted like the caramel portion was burned when they were making the ice-cream. Probably won't get this flavor again. The CREME FRAICHE was a nice touch. It definitely tasted like CREME FRAICHE. I probably won't try it again, but it was nice to try at least once (it was one of the limited flavors of the day). Finally, the scoop I loved the most out of my batch was HONEY LAVENDER. In my opinion, this was the scoop that most lived up to its name. Every bite tasted like lavender petals in my mouth, sweet lavender petals. It was a very light, relaxing flavor. There would be pockets of honey flavor every now and then which was pretty neat. I wouldn't getting the HONEY LAVENDER again. All in all, I've tasted better ice-cream for sure, but BiRite does offer some unique flavors you can't find elsewhere. Note: At specific parts of the day, there are long, long lines. The lines do move quickly though, so be patient. Also, the seating area inside is very limited and small.

Bi-Rite Creamery is the number 1 place you have to go to if you're anywhere near the mission at night. Fresh and daily made ice cream, the flavors know no bounds. From Êyour basic vanilla and chocolate, to their unconventionally delicious Earl Grey and Salted Caramel your tastebuds will indebted to you until your next visit. Even on rainy nights, the line before closing is still around the block-if that isn't a sign that they're doing something right, I don't know what is. Parking can be tough in the area, but because their service is quick and easy spots always open up. If you're in a rush, you can "skip" the line outside the door and jump inside and grab a premade pint and purchase it right at the front of the line. Summer in the city may still consist of fog and some cold, but Bi-Rite Creamery will always be a good idea anytime!

My first experience with probably will make me biased to like it, but I think it still says something about the place! I was having a really bad day and after looking at 10 different places for a short snack (not having craved any of it), I finally decided to stop here. I picked out a kid's cone of Cheesecake ice cream and the guy asked me how my day was. After honestly answering that it was pretty bad, he said that my ice cream was on the house. Totally made my day much better. =] Regardless of that experience, I've seen lines out the door even on cold winter evenings, and I understand why. There isn't much seating on the inside, though understandable for an ice cream place. The place is conveniently near some good restaurants and has good ice cream that they make themselves. The flavors aren't the type you could buy by the carton (recommend honey lavender yum!). Of course, the people working are pretty nice too. The only thing is that I wish it was a little cheaper, but that's true about most things I get.

This review is based on Bi-rite's Salted Caramel ice cream because that's all that matters. THE best salted caramel ice cream I've had was in Oregon two years back from an ice cream cart; name I can't remember. I've been lusting...no FIENDING for Salted Caramel ice cream since then. I've tried countless grocery store renditions to no avail. I heard that Bi-rite served their own concoction of this frozen crack so I definitely had to try it. It's fucking good. And just as good as the one I had in Oregon. Oh yea, the lines are ridiculously long. Stood in line for a good half hour in the brisk night air for this stuff. If you ain't want scoops and just want a pint to go, then just cut up front and grab the Salted Caramel (don't even think about getting anything else) from the freezer and get the fuck outta there to enjoy your new creamy narcotic.

Quick tip - Come here on cold days to avoid line lines. Been here plenty of times and the salted caramel is by far the best flavor they have. What is double bladed sword is they have unique flavors only. If you are craving traditional flavors i recommend Mitchels down the street. Bi-Rite is great for ice cream if you looking for something out of the ordinary. I rarely crave flavors like lavender or olive oil. I do feel that the first time i tasted these flavors they have similar taste just different after taste. Just a thought.

I discovered recently that a few acquaintances of mine had somehow resided in San Francisco without ever trying Bi-Rite. "The line is too long", they said. "You can get ice cream like, anywhere", they said. To which I respond, I pity you. I'm not religious per se, but I do try to do good works and help other people in the hopes that when I die, I will go to heaven, and heaven will have Bi-Rite. My personal favorites are roasted banana, salted caramel, brown sugar, and honey lavandar, often in some combination. However, I have never tasted an ice cream there that I didn't like (except peanut butter, but I'm allergic to peanuts so that's not their fault). So yes, okay, there tends to be a line to the end of the block, but isn't that usually an indication of deliciousness? Call me a sheep, but if 30+ people are standing in line to eat something, I want to eat it too. Besides, the line moves fast and is an excellent time to contemplate what wonderful flavor you want to treat yourself to today. Also, let's discuss location. Bi-Rite Creamery is conveniently situated at the corner of Dolores Park which, if it happens to be a nice day out, is an ideal place to enjoy your ice cream. Plus, Bi-Rite has a (clean!) bathroom which they're super-nice about customers using. So on a nice day when I'm hanging out with friends in Dolores Park, I'll use their bathroom AND get ice cream - double whammy! I just realized that a) this is a super-long review and b) the time I just spent writing this review could have been used to get Bi-Rite. Peace.

DEFINITELY worth 5 stars simply for it's honey lavender ice cream!!! I waited for nearly AN HOUR in that ridiculous line.. so when I got to the front my mind-set was "THIS BETTER BE THE BEST DARN ICE CREAM IN THE WORLD!" and it seriously was. The honey lavender is by far the best I've ever had. Even compared to the honey lavender at Gelato Classico, Bi-Rite owns them all. The flavor was so rich, it exploded in my mouth and I was shocked that it was so flavorful. I only wish I got a larger scoop now! My advice? Get the pint in the freezer haha because you're gonna need it!! Oh and also, you can skip the wait in the line if you pick up something already packaged.. good tip for the future!

I'm not about to crown Bi-Rite Creamery as the best ice cream I've ever had, but it's definitely way, way up there. The ice cream is fresh and made daily and the flavors are definitely unique. I've tried the following flavors: 1. Salted Caramel: Awesome! I'm not usually a fan of caramel, so I really liked that the flavor was had that caramel flavor but was not overbearing. It's by far the most popular flavor here. 2. Roasted Banana: Extremely fragrant...and tastes like, well, a banana. It even has real banana pieces in it. This flavor really stands out. I paired it with the salted caramel on the single cone and boy, did my tastebuds ever thank you. 3. Strawberry Balsamic: It's more strawberry than balsamic, but it's still an interesting combination. You really have to take it slow and savor the flavor to get that subtle balsamic flavor. In essence, I think it was meant to kick the strawberry flavor up a notch. It does the job, but I think I expected something more unique. 4. Honey Lavender: You can definitely taste the lavender in this combo. It's good, but I'm not sure that I would buy a pint of this...but maybe I'm just not a fan of lavender. I would however recommend this flavor to someone who's looking for something on the lighter side though. 5. Creme Fraiche: Think of this flavor as your basic vanilla. It would go great paired with one of Bi-Rite's stronger flavors. 6. Brown Butter Pecan: It's nutty and creamy at the same time. It's another that would go great with a stronger flavor. My mom enjoyed it when paired with the balsamic strawberry. 7. Ricanelas: The cinnamon definitely adds a kick to this flavor. My brother said that it reminded him of a cinnamon roll, but in ice cream form. 8. Coffee Toffee: For all you coffee fiends out there, this is a good coffee ice cream. It's light, but still has that good coffee flavor. The toffee isn't overbearing either. All in all, Bi-Rite is great because it's not very expensive and it's fun to grab a cone and walk over to Dolores Park to just relax, enjoy San Francisco, and eat your ice cream. And if you don't want to wait in line, you can bypass it by walking in and just buying a prepacked pint of your favorite flavor!

If there was any a store that I wish I lived on the same street, it would be this one: Bi-Rite Creamery. ÊIt always has lines out the door, with people waiting with excitement and anticipation, wondering what flavors they are going to get, knowing that they will pick the ones they always have come in for... Located in Mission Dolores, it's adjacent to Dolores Park, which makes it the perfect stop after a hot day laying out on the grass (I also love going to Bi-Rite Market across the street and getting a sandwich and some side salads for a Picnic in the park!) The whole street that it's located on is a veritable food fest, you have Delfina and Pizzeria Delfina where you can get some of the best Italian food in the city, Tartine Bakery and the Dolores Park Cafe-all good food.. The Bi-Rite Creamery also has baked goods which is another storefront next door, I wish we had known earlier, cuz then we would have bought some muffins and pastries for the hotel! The thing that I LOVE about Bi-Rite is that they are local and they make small batches of ice cream that have an intense amount of unique flavors that elevate the definition of Ice Cream. All natural, no more than five ingredients in each batch, who wouldn't love this place!!! My ALL TIME FAVORITE: Salted Caramel, with Ricanella (Spanish Cinnamon) at a close second-which is usually where I stop...But on this occasion ÊI decided to add one more flavor: the Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl- this was a heavenly combination! ÊI also enjoy the Honey Lavender, but it's hard to mix it with the others that I like, so it kinda gets left out a lot.... So when in SF, do NOT miss the opportunity to go to Bi-Rite Creamery and get yourself some Ice Cream, you're an idiot if you don't like it....(just kidding....well....not really) Ratings (Out of Five Stars) Food: Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê5 Ambience: Ê3.5 Service: Ê Ê Ê4

I'm sorry, but I just don't see what all the fuss is about. They certainly offer a nice variety of gourmet ice cream, but not better than any other gourmet ice cream in the city. I can't figure out why people line up around the block for it. The only thing I can figure is that the convenient location next to Dolores Park, and all the weekend revelers enjoying magic brownies need a munchie fix. If this place was in any other location, I don't think anyone would care about it.

While the hubby is a pho-snob, I consider my area of expertise to be desserts - in particular ice cream. ÊSo when I heard about this place, I begged and begged and BEGGED to go. ÊBut having two little kiddos and working (nowhere near the city) doesn't make it easy to make a trip out just to eat some ice cream. ÊSo when we got some vacation time, I decided FOOD TOUR! ÊAnd finally made our way here! ÊAnd I must say, it was worth the wait! For starters, upon entering the shop you feel like you stepped into a mom-and-pop creamery in Lake Tahoe. ÊThe little display at the front and the rustic mini-tables add to the charm (though I'm sure people waiting in line forever wish there was more seating). Ê Next, you are confronted with a dairy case with dry-erase markered flavors written on it. ÊAnd oh, the choices! ÊAfter perusing the selection and doubting, second guessing, and negotiating with my kids to get them to select flavors I wanted to try (evil, I know), we finally settled on: Salted Caramel Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle Strawberry with Balsamic White Chocolate Raspberry Swirl My favorite of the four was the Salted Caramel. ÊAmazing flavor, not too sweet and such creamy texture. ÊThe malted vanilla was also awesome. ÊIn the strawberry, the addition of the balsamic really cuts the sweetness and gives it a pleasant tang. ÊThe white chocolate rasp was the most "ho hum" of the flavors (my kid is not very food-adventurous) but also delicious. Definitely worth the drive if you don't live in the area!

HALLELUJAH ! I finally found a super duper good ice cream place ! I love how they have unique flavors compared to other ice cream places. Although they are a bit pricey for a small amount , but it's all worth it. My favorites are the earl grey (limited time), lemon, and many others ! The texture of the ice cream is really different than a lot of other places and you can really taste the quality in it. Too bad sometimes it's hard to find parking around this area , but the ice cream here are worthy of praise !

Bi-Rite is probably my Favorite ice cream shop in the city. I crave for it ALL the time, but it's popularity in the recent years has bummed me out. But of course, that is excellent for business. While driving by it in the last couple years, we've always seen lines hitting around the corner to Delores St. Wow! That alone tells you how great their products are. Bf first introduced Bi-Rite to me in 2007 and OMG I was in ice cream heaven. While he's into craft beer, I'm into "craft" ice cream! I have had their brownie sundae, Sam's sundae, roasted banana, salted caramel, balsamic strawberry, Afternoon snack, etc. in the past. I think I've sampled quite a few too. I've even had their sundaes to substitute for meals in the past! Their distinguished flavors and signature "creations" are what sets them apart from every other ice cream parlor I've been to. In addition to their ice cream, they also have freshly made cookies, packaged cookies, pints of ice cream, soft serve, soda pop, popsicles, etc. They have plenty of sweets to fulfill that rush! What I also admire about Bi-Rite is their story. People who are not from SF may not know that Bi-Rite was and still is a market/local store. It's just across the street from the creamery. I've been to the market before the creamery was even acquired. Further, I appreciate that they are a local business that is SO successful in the city's Mission District.

Holy crap. So after what seems like years of people recommending this place to me as one of the best places in the city to get ice cream, I finally got the chance to come by and give it a shot! And boy, people are definitely not wrong about this place. It's actually not a far walk from the BART station at 18th... Which I highly recommend you use instead of trying to drive there because it is definitely a car nightmare in that area. It is amazing! Ok well the line is not amazing... Cause there apparently seems to be 30 people lining up on any given day/time (it was like 9 pm when my boyfriend and I got there and it was cold and people were still lining up for ice cream...). We were in line for about 20 or 30 minutes? But it was definitely worth it. There are a ton of interesting options. And they all look incredibly tasty. We settled on getting the single (which are two large scoops or three smaller scoops) and got four different flavors. You can try the different flavors if you ask too. My boyfriend got Ricanelas and cookies and cream while I got balsamic strawberry and honey lavender. I was actually really looking forward to trying their earl grey tea flavor, but I guess that was a seasonal flavor :( The counter was crazy busy, and the girls seemed to mess up a couple of the orders (for other people) but they worked quickly and replaced the orders they messed up. The girl who gave me mine made sure I had two very large scoops too, which was super cool. The ice cream is pretty expensive, but considering the fact that the ice cream is made daily (they have a full kitchen in the back), it's totally worth it! The ice cream is rich and creamy, with the right amount of fluff mixed in. The balsamic strawberry had a very interesting sour cream taste to it; it was nothing like any strawberry ice cream I've ever had. The honey lavender grows on you a lot (it's not something I'd usually think of getting, but I loved the subtle taste. The cookies and cream ice cream is hands down probably the best cookies and cream I've ever had with a perfect texture and taste (I love the cookie bits!). The Ricanelas was probably my favorite of the bunch with the cinnamon and the cakes bits... It tasted exactly like the cereal cinnamon toast crunch! Also reminiscent of the Frozen Kuhsterd I had a while back at the Yelp event, which is also good but didn't have the depth in texture like this ice cream. The ice cream was so amazing that my boyfriend and I bought a pint home. Which almost ended in disaster because we were BARTing home and driving all the way back Mountain View. Lesson learned though: make sure you have an ice cream evacuation plan before buying! Yay Ricanelas!

Let's play the "Only in SF would you.." game: Only in SF would you find a line of 15 people outside of an ice-cream shop after the sun has gone down and the temperature dropped to about 52 degrees. Salted caramel is the BEST combination of flavors anyone has come up with in a dessert, and I'm thankful that Bi-Rite has served them well. Their staff, although clearly busy all night (and probably all day) was incredibly friendly and put up with my internal debate over just getting a whole-lotta salted caramel or to take advantage of the two half-scoop deal and try another. Thank you for being you, Bi-Rite.

I was totally excited to go try the salted caramel after hearing about it. Got to say, I was a disappointed. It tasted kind of like burnt caramel and the taste kind of stuck to the back of my throat. Wasn't that impressed with this flavor. And it melted too fast, so by the time I got to it, it was all melted. However, the balsamic strawberry was amazing! I loved it! It was really creamy and I could taste the strawberries more than the balsamic.

Yay to best ice cream sf! Homemade so good! Near Dolores park and 24 and mission Bart station. "For a cool, creamy batch crafted from scratch, look no further than Bi-Rite Creamery & Bakeshop, a San Francisco landmark set in the heart of the Mission District. Aside from its signature creamy scoops, Bi-Rite boasts a versatile selection of delicacies, ranging from ice cream sandwiches to popsicles to fully loaded sundaes. To top it off, owners Anne Walker and Kris Hoogerhyde pride themselves on making all the toppings -- including marshmallows, peanut brittle, and hot fudge -- at their adjoining bakery. For intense flavor, try their "dainty gentleman" signature sundae (honey-lavender ice cream lathered in hot fudge, sea salt, and blood orange olive oil)."

I'm not a fan of their famous salted caramel. My favorite is the earl grey, its a good place for dessert if you are in the area but for more flavorful fruit assortments I would go to mitchells. +side is their ice cream isn't too sweet! Watch out on weekends there may be a line outside.

Living in Berkeley, I'd always hear people comparing Ici to Bi-Rite. I'm still not sure which one I like more. Bi-Rite is still definitely up there in excellent ice cream regardless of any comparisons. Last time I went there, I had the salted caramel and roasted banana, both of which were fantastic. People talk a lot about the salted caramel, but the banana, for me, was the standout. Something about it just brought out the voice in the back of my mind shouting, "I want more!" Doesn't hurt that location-wise, it's right across the street from Dolores Park, so you can enjoy your ice cream on a "good" day. How long the line is depends on how lucky you are when you go. The first time I passed it, I did not even bother waiting in the long line. But during my most recent visit, there were literally two people in line and that was in the middle of a really sunny day surprisingly.

Waited in line for 25 minutes - they have an organized queue stretching across the block for the typical long lines they get. While in line, I was beginning to wonder if the wait was worth it, or if all the hype was justified... ...until I tried their ice cream. I got a regular (two scoops, reasonably priced at $3.50); one scoop was the ricanelas (cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodles!) and the other was cookies and cream. The ricanelas was unworldly - it was perfect bliss, with the pieces of snickerdoodles highlighting the tastefulness of the cinnamon. The cookies and cream, likewise, was delicious. My friends tried the lavender, salted caramel, strawberry, and more, and all reported similar levels of deliciousness. So yes, worth the wait - the line moves fast, and you'll get some fantastic ice cream at the end!

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory? NOOOO.... It's..... CHENA AND THE ICE CREAM FACTORY! It was every kid's dream to enter the one and only Bi-Rite Creamery. Bi-Rite: A place where magical ice cream exists. You definitely can't try the flavors they have here anywhere else. Hence, the magic of it. Of course, being the big eater I am, I got the triple scoop in a cup. Salted Caramel: 2 stars. I am not going to say this is WAY over hyped because analogous to one's taste in guys, everyone has their own taste in ice cream. I definitely did not like this flavor because it was awfully bitter and tasted like overly burnt butterscotch. BUT that's just me. I like sweet ice cream. However, many people do like this flavor so you should taste it first and see if you like it! White Chocolate Raspberry: 4.5 stars. Just the right kinda guy-- i mean ice cream for me. It's what it sounds like, Raspberry and White chocolate. absolutely delicious. Brown Sugar: 4 stars. What more can I say? Tastes like brown sugar! It can be compared to Haagen Dazs' Dulce De Leche if you have tried that before. Pretty good, and sweet like I like it! Ricanelas: 3 stars. I personally don't like cinnamon, so it was not the flavor for me! However, my friend LOVED it because she likes cinnamon, so if you are one of them cinnamon lovers, TRY IT! My total came out to $6.25 I have yet to try the cookies and cream, mint chocolate chip, and coffee toffee, but my friends had it and they LOVED it. So I think you cant go wrong here. Just pick what you like and it will be delicious. They let you sample, so just choose whatever your heart desires! I heard about this place's long lines, so I did what I did best: come at awkward times! I came on Tuesday around 2:45pm. It was a 10 minutes wait, but much better than the "hourly" wait! Parking is quite difficult! It's mostly street parking, so if you are lucky, you will find a spot. If not, circle around. TRY THIS IF YOU EVER CAN TO EXPERIENCE THE MYSTICAL BI-RITE CREAMERY.

What a cute little place (no really, the seats were tiny) full of unique flavors! ÊWe walked from the BART, desperately hoping there was no line so we wouldn't miss a reservation later. ÊLuckily, there was nobody in line! ÊI had the balsamic strawberry and malted vanilla. ÊI really really liked the balsamic strawberry. ÊThe ice cream was really creamy, and the strawberry flavor was really different from other strawberry flavors I had. ÊIt wasn't just sweet, it had a bit of tangy-ness that I can't quite describe. ÊThe malted vanilla wasn't what I expected, it was too sweet, and didn't taste like malt at all. ÊI guess what I like about malt vanilla is how plain the taste is, and that wasn't quite what it was. I also love the ricanela! ÊI got that from a pint (not as fresh, but no line when there's a crowd!) and really enjoyed it. ÊTastes just like a snicker doodle. ÊSome other flavors were just too sweet. ÊI guess it's a hit or miss with what you personally like. ÊFortunately, ice cream places often let you try out flavors before you actually get a scoop, so try away! ÊOverall very satisfied with certain flavors and the creaminess of the ice cream.

Yummy in my tummy! 6 years later I make my 2nd visit to Bi-Rite and have their infamous salted caramel. It was delicious. It's so rich and dense and solid. The way ice cream was meant to be made and eaten. The line is longer and more intricately segmented than the hottest club in SF, but it moves quickly and service is efficient and friendly. Just please don't hold up the line by trying every flavor! We all want to get our ice cream on ;)

When you see a line outside the door, you know it is a great place. Extremely fast line. Ordered the trifecta but swapped malted vanilla for the roasted banana. The roasted banana was delicious my favorite of the three flavors. Great taste of banana and nice creaminess. Brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl was my next favorite. Not so sweet but just right, the ginger caramel swirl adds a nice unique flavor to the brown sugar. My least favorite was the salted caramel. It was so STRONG. The flavor was too pungent for my pallet and it was really hard to finish the salted caramel. Well, I haven't had anything like that before; it definitely was different. It almost tasted like burnt sugar. Bi-rite has unique flavors and I'm loving the ones I tried except for the salted caramel. I wanted to try the honey lavender but I was sugared out. -The stars tell you..its a must visit. p.s.: service is great. Really friendly.

Some of the best ice cream I've ever had. I tried the Salted Caramel and the Malted Vanilla with Toffee Bits and both were amazing. Incredibly creamy ice cream and also extremely flavorful. I think this and Mitchell's are neck and neck for best ice cream in the city. I was lucky enough to be on vacation and able to go at a random time in the middle of the week so there were no lines, which made the experience even more delightful. This place is at a perfect location too, for a nice stroll with your ice cream through Dolores park. I wish I didn't just eat a massive sandwich from nearby Ike's Place before coming - otherwise, I would've definitely gotten Sam's Sundae too.

The first time I tried Bi-Rite Creamery... a friend from out of town, was told by his attending that THIS was the place to go to for ice cream or for a birthday cake.... so when I showed up to a dinner party we tried the: Chocolate salted caramel cake! Omg... Heaven! I think everyone fought over who would get or share the last bits of it. the 20 of us destroyed this cake. lol. the second time, we had a gf in town and we were walking about the mission district and decided to wait in the loooooong line to try some of this ice cream goodness in person. Salted caramel cone. yummy! i think this is my new fave flavor! Tried the balsamic strawberry ice cream... interesting. good... but a bit weird. and there's a trick to the line! if you want a pint of ice cream and not a scoop... go to the front! you don't have to wait! But if you're gonna try and be sneaky and get a scoop in.. go wait in line. don't be THAT guy. I got a pint of Earl grey ice cream... one of my gf loves this one.. i tried it, at first i liked it. i figured my bf would like it but that was a negative. after a few tries, I had to throw it out. too weird. but definitely an awesome place to go to on a bright sunny summer day!

Here's what makes a good ice cream: 1) Using FULL cream / Milk (none of that non-fat /low fat stuff - really if you take the fat out, you have to enhance the flavour other ways - which companies usually do by adding extra sugar - or maybe corn syrup since in the US that is added to everything that you buy pre packaged) 2) Using FULL cream / milk as your FIRST ingredient (not sugar, then cream) Hands down one of the best ice creameries in San Francisco. ÊSmooth, Creamy, Without being too sugary. Just perfect! I come from New Zealand which is the dairy capital in the world. We have good dairy. And this is good ice cream. I brought some visitors from New Zealand for this awesome place and they literally thought they had the best ice cream in their lives. My favourite flavours (I haven't tried all the flavours) - Balsamic Strawberry - I LOVE LOVE it - Salted Caramel - Sweet & Salty - how could you not enjoy it? - Butter Cream Pecan - Oh so smooth~ I tried a taste of malted vanilla (this was really good, but on the sweet side), honey lavender (which a lot of reviewers enjoyed, but I personally thought was a little too flowerly / artificial / strange tasting). Just stick to the above 3, and you are good. Will I come back? Yes even my lactose intolerance will not stop me from eating bi-rite!

This is good ice cream to me but the part I liked the most was the fluid service. Even though they were really busy they weren't disorganized with a bouncer at the door like Fentons. With a line out the door, we were still able to try flavors without feeling rushed. 4/5 because the salted caramel didn't manage to maintain some unmelted chunks of salt like some gelato places can do so it just tasted like a really good Creme brle ice cream. There's a haagan Dazs Êsalted caramel at Lucky's I'm gonna try and compare. The malted van with peanut brittle was a good texture but no crunch of peanut brittle or even a chunk of chocolate! Very disappointing bc I really wanted that crunch. In the end though, I could see what all the fuss was all about, it melts well and it's good I've cream.

There were only 2 people in line when I drove past this place looking for parking but after 2 times around the block, the line grew to over 20 people. Ridiculous. If it's one thing I've learned about going to these kinds of great ice cream establishments... never get the plain flavors such as "vanilla". It's a waste of an experience (and gas since parking is crazy). We ordered the salted caramel and coffee toffee ice cream and they were delicious. The texture was soft and melts as soon as it hits your tongue, not a moment too soon or too late. These flavors are what make authentic creameries awesome. I just wish there were more places to sit, more places to park, and that waiting in line in the cold (for ice cream ironically) wouldn't be so unbearable.

I also added Marcona Almond Toffee to it and I was in my own little world.

But hey that never stopped me and apparently it didn't stop the other 4000+ yelpers who tried and loved this place. There was a short line since I went mid afternoon on a weekday, but still a line nonetheless and parking well... sf aint' known for parking. :P i tried the salted caramel since everyone raves about it and it was DELICIOUS and the Honey Lavender was great too. My friends recommended the earl grey, so i'll have to get that next time. BOTTOM LINE: Tourists go to Ghiradelli, but locals go to Bi-Rite Creamery!

Wow this place is one the best ice cream I've ever eaten!!! I've heard of this place from many friends and saw that it was top 3 in america online so I just had to come by and try it. Luckily for me it was seasonal time so I got to try their balsamic strawberry. Who would have though to put those flavors together?! It's definitely very unique. Not a fan of balsamic but this one was extremely tasty. Also had the chance to try the brown butter pecan which was amazinggggggg!!! The pecan flavor has a really nice scent to it which smells like they were freshly made. I would definitely come back here many more times but parking is a pain to find too. Next time I'll try their sundaes and maybe get a birthday cake or pie for someone

I had the trifecta which includes a scoop of their salted caramel, brown sugar with ginger and caramel swirl, and malted vanilla with peanut brittle and chocolate. O.M.G. Delicious. I couldn't even choose any one flavor that I preferred over the other. The line looked long, but moved quick. I believe it's $2.50 a scoop. They sell cookies, prepackaged containers of ice cream, cupcakes, and other goodies. I downed my bowl of ice cream so fast that I needed to cough, but held it back by shoving more ice cream down my throat because it was the... BEST. ICE. CREAM. I. HAVE. EVER. HAD. No joke. If you're in the bay, Bi-Rite Creamery is a MUST.

In my opinion, kindddddd of overrated and not worth the wait. I mean, don't get me wrong, the ice cream here is pretty good and they have some bomb flavors. But would I wait 30 minutes + for ice cream again? Probably not. My bf and I came here on a Saturday afternoon and the line was out the door, monitored by dividers, around the corner, and down the street. We pretty much had to wait...for the longest time I've waited for ice cream. When we got to the front, they were super cool and let us try all the flavors we wanted. One unique thing was that they used metal spoons instead of plastic ones to let us try flavors, yay for the environment! I ended up getting the salted caramel and brown sugar with ginger. It's cool cuz you can choose your size based on if you one big scoop or two small scoops of two flavors for the same price! The salted caramel we pretty good and the brown sugar with ginger was slightly odd but I liked it! You can definitely taste the ginger. I tried their honey lavender as well and it definitely has a unique floral taste to it. This ice cream shop also sells other baked goods and their own packaged ice cream as well. You can either sit in the small tables inside the store (really cramped) or outside. Since this place is really close to Dolores Park (literally down the street), my bf and I opted to avoid feeling claustrophobic in the store and sit at Dolores to eat our ice cream. Overall, not worth the wait. Worth a try if there isn't a line, but whether or not you want to wait 30 min+ for ice cream on a more busy day depends on how desperate your body is craving those sweet carbs! Oh, and best part? Definitely one of the most AFFORDABLE ice cream shops in SF!

Wow, I think San Francisco likes standing on lines. We waited in line on a Sunday evening for about 15mins before getting into the store. The ice cream was really yummy but 15 minute wait for ice cream? I'm sure there are times its even longer since there was another set of stanchions behind us that was ready for the next wave of patrons. Anyway, back to the ice cream. I got the Coffee Toffee, Salted Carmel and Vanilla on a waffle cone which came out to $5.00. The scoops were generous and they don't seem to mind letting you try flavors. There is also another window for ordering soft serve and other desserts and drinks-- no line for that. I was impressed with all their interesting flavor so I'm sure the next time I'm in SF I'll be back on that line again.

BEST. ICE CREAM. EVER. omg I can't even rave more about this place! I am definitely team Froyo but Bi-Rite is my exception. Whenever I go, I want to sample EVERY flavor. I always try one or two that I was on the fence with, but always end up getting persuaded to get it. For example, I didn't think I would like the roasted banana, but it was so good I had to get a cup of it. Usually I keep it simple and go for dark chocolate and something else, but their unique flavors HAVE to be tried. It's so creamy and smooth. I have had many of their flavors, such as salted caramel, chocolate, mint chip, roasted banana, honey lavender, and cookies and cream. One of my favorites had to be the ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles). I tried this one unexpectedly and fell in love. I never really thought there was a different with brands of ice cream; I thought they were all the same, until I ate here. My friend and I tried the two other big-name ice cream places in SF, but they didn't do the trick. I will only eat ice cream if it's from bi-rite. No more Safeway brand cartons for birthdays, either. It is worth the price and the wait. $3.50 for a single scoop (which is really two scoops) is the perfect amount for a craving.

I am such a sucker for unique ice cream flavors. Bi-Rite is just the place for me. I am not much of a sweets person but I could gorge myself everyday on their salted caramel. You can really taste the salt in it whereas other salted caramels I've had before are shy with that. The balsamic strawberry is a second favorite of mine and those two are my go-tos. I've had friends rave about the honey lavender, although I'm not a huge lavender fan. Any time I'm in the neighborhood I make sure to stop by here. Hell, even when I'm not I try to make the trip out. Be prepared for a wait unless you're going at some random weekday at a weird time. This place is seriously popular. Great, now I'm craving some salted caramel...

Bf and I walked right in on a Wednesday afternoon. I tried the Roasted Banana just because I was curious. I already knew what I wanted: SALTED CARAMEL!! It made my dreams come true. So creamy and delicious. One scoop in a cone is all you need. Unless you are bf. In that case, you need the scoop of Salted Caramel in a cone. Then you finish that, get back in line, and get one scoop of Chocolate in a cone. Recommended it to the rest of our family in town, and we would definitely be in trouble if we lived near this place.

Bi Rite is the matrimony of cheap and satisfying that inspires a mass of followers as shown through their carefully roped line extending around the block. For new Bi Rite followers, fear not, the line does move quickly, and soon enough, you'll be paying for your "out of this world" ice cream. (However, please take a look at the menu and narrow down your choices beforehand, as the staff is a bit impatient and would like to limit your tastings (sucks I know). I am not an ice-creamaholic but this place has me addicted. The honey lavender has just the right amount of thickness/ creaminess, and tasted very fresh like it was made with real lavender. Please don't report me when I say this, but their ice cream is orgasmic. I would show you a picture of it, but Yelp is PG13. Don't believe me? Come try the best meal/dessert I had while visiting SF for yourself, lucky bast*rd,

There is nothing as comforting as the produce aisle of a gourmet supermarket. Unless it is a pint of their own churned small-batch production of Salted Caramel ice cream across the way. also, Their original vanilla goes great either affogato style with a morning espresso, or as an after dinner treat with a decadent drizzle of Chambord. Skip the dreaded line.. Get a pint.

Bi RIte oh Bi Rite.... For someone who isn't really THAT fond of ice cream, you blow me away with your creative flavors, soft churned ice cream. Ê:) I went there on a saturday evening...the line was so long it wrapped around the block. ÊI was there with the BF..and although we wanted to try all the flavors...I don't think our stomachs would have agreed to that. The flavors we tried: Infamous Salted caramel (the most creamiest out of all i tried) malted vanilla w/peanut brittle & milk chocolate pieces ( I couldn't decide if i like this one or Salted caramel better :) Coffee toffee (super good too!) Balsamic Strawberry (This was not bad, but the last flavor to stay in the bowl) Honey Lavender ( I asked for a sample of this and passed it up, it was only ok to me) I can't wait to come back. ÊNext time though, i would buy a pint of the salted caramel as its only $8. Ê Pricing: I can't remember exactly but it ranges somewhere around: one scoop: Ê$4.00 two scoop : Ê$5.00 three scoop:$6.50 Its definitely worth a visit if you guys like ice cream, in the area. ÊFor sac folks, its way better than Leatherby's and even Gunthers. Ê:)

After yelping some sweet spots in SF and already stumbling upon Scream Sorbet I really wanted to try some ice cream. I arrived at Bi-Rite and the couple in front of me was literally sampling EVERY flavor, and there were a lot! I could have done this myself, and maybe I should have. But I didn't. I immediately saw salted caramel and knew I would try that, how can you go wrong with salted caramel? It reminded me of burnt marshmallows. I hope that doesn't turn anyone off to trying it, because I really liked it. I also had the malted vanilla, which doesn't stand out so distinctly in my memory....but I know I wasn't disappointed with either flavor.

*** I'm a week behind on my reviews so I'm dropping the Bay area reviews first before the Yelp Vegas Spring Break ones. *** This review is for the soft-serve as I didn't want my company to wait in the ridiculously long line with me. Personally, I would have done it since I was already in the area. We got on the soft serve line instead. Pretty pricey compared to regular soft serve but the taste and texture makes up for the price different. This is definitely not your average ice cream in a cone. I'm gonna have to keep this in my bookmark and try it the next time I'm around here.

Really enjoyable ice cream experience despite the lines outside while we were there. The ice cream sandwich we had was the chocolate cookie with mint ice cream that was really refreshing. The cookies were good and the ice cream had solid real mint flavor. We also split a coffee/salted caramel dish and both flavors were right on point. Loved the take out window for quicker service especially with how many people were in line. Absolutely no issues with Bi-Rite and I would definitely go back.

SALTED CARAMEL ICE CREAM!!! Since I first tried this flavor 2 years ago, I have yet to find another place that makes a salted caramel ice cream that's even comparable to theirs. It is so worth standing in the insanely long lines for. Hands down best ice cream I've ever eaten. Dear Bi-Rite, please don't ever leave.

Ever since my brother told me about Molly Moon's in Seattle, my SO and I have been more keen on trying out local ice cream places. So, while in San Francisco, we decided to try out Bi-Rite Creamery. I was already a fan of the market since the last time we were in the city I got this awesome curry toffee. Anyway, that's another review. We arrived at the Creamery on a sunny, but cool Saturday afternoon. Seems like we weren't the only ones who thought ice cream sounded like a good idea. The line had three distinct waiting areas that wrapped around the corner. Should we wait? we thought. Yeah, if everyone else is waiting too, it must be worthwhile. So, we waited. We took turns using the restroom (which had its own line), and we eventually got to the front of the line. A fair line made it less stressful - not sure this would work in Miami (where I'm from). My SO made the right move and got the flavor combination listed as a "staff favorite" - malted vanilla, salted caramel, and brown sugar. I got brown sugar, creme fraiche, and ginger. My favorite was her malted vanilla. She was nice enough to share;) I tried a few flavors before ordering, but I didn't want to hold up the line, so I didn't try them all. I tried the balsamic strawberry and the salted caramel. Neither was a hit for me, but some people swear by the salted caramel. I prefer flavors with "stuff" in it, which is why I really liked the malted vanilla. In any case, no matter what flavors you get, this is a fun experience.

My favorite two flavors are the Earl Grey and the Honey Lavender. Both are delicate flavors that I truly enjoyed. Though, I'm a Ici (a Berkeley creamery) girl at heart...especially since Ici has handmade wafer cones; Bi-Rite lacks in this domain. But hey I need to cover my go-to ice cream bases from both sides of the bridge, right? ;) Oh and Salted Caramel ice cream was overrated. Stop overhyping it!

ÊEvery time I'm at the gym, that's what I think about and it's such a shame that I live in SJ that it's not very easy to get to! ÊIf anyone knows of a place that sells their ice cream pints in SJ area, LET ME KNOW PLEASE!

Echoing all the reviews here. Seriously thick, creamy, and dense ice cream loaded with flavor. I've tried the trifecta (salted caramel, brown ginger with caramel swirl, malted vanilla with peanut brittle and chocolate) and the only bad part was finishing it. The malted vanilla was like swimming in a sea of creaminess, with the peanut brittle and chocolate serving as edible flotation devices. The salted caramel was the true highlight. Almost like having a caramel margarita or a caramel martini (which, coincidentally enough, I had soon after at Yoshi's). A real fiesta for the taste buds. I've also tried the ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles) and cookies and cream combo, which was a subtler, but still rich and creamy treat. Yes, the super, super long lines are a drawback - they've even marked the entire street corner with stanchions and belts to keep the crowds in check - so if you live in the area, it's a much better idea to grab a pint to take home at the separate dedicated window where there's no line. Or just keep on walking and burn those calories, but what's the fun in that? ;) Probably the best ice cream I've had anywhere, besides Toscanini's in Cambridge.

Quite possibly one of the best ice creams I have ever tasted. I can't believe I did not come here the last time I was in SF. Grab some ice cream and head over across the street to Dolores Park! The park has a new and awesome playground for kids. And for the older kids, plenty of space for your picnic blanket (and maybe a mini grill). Salted caramel, honey lavender, brown sugar, balsamic strawberry...drooooool. I doubt that the other flavors are disappointing. The cookies are chewy and tasty as well. The line is long but moves fast. I love how they partition it to leave the sidewalk open (NYC! You should learn.).

What to say, this place always has a line of people! I had a gift card for the longest time (over a year) and decided to use it. I came here and tasted/ ordered the following: Balsamic Strawberry: WEIRD! Tasted weird just think of strawberry ice cream with a balsamic vinegar... tastes exactly like that. Honey Lavender: Very flowery. If you like the taste of flowers and fragrant types of taste this one is for you. Toasted Coconut: MmmMMm YUMMY!! Loved the toasted coconut! Not that rich, but rich enough to enjoy the scoop I got! It was very very creamy and it was just soo good. Roasted Almond: If you are Asian or love Asian food, this one reminds me of the almond jello dessert my mom used to make when I was a kid. It has chunks of almond in it that made it even better! $3.75 for two small scoops of ice cream. I ended up getting Toasted coconut and Roasted almond. Ice creams here are very thick and creamy, not like other ice creams you get at the local market. It is more rich and creamier. Service was really good and the place is busy, but the line goes by really fast. If you can't wait, just get the pint they have in the freezer, no need to wait in line! I still have $$ left on my gift card, so I definitely will be back!

My bf and I came here last night after we had some Soul Food for dinner. We had to wait in line for a few minutes (15 minutes) but the wait went by fast :) I had no idea that this tiny ice-cream parlor was so popular!! So we finally got inside the place. There was a huge menu displaying all of the ice cream flavors, different kinds of sundaes, etc. All of their sundaes sounded delicious! I settled on a single-serve ice cream cone with two flavors: salted caramel and roasted banana. The salted caramel was divine. I've never tried salted caramel ice cream before and I'm glad I got to try Bi-Rite's! It was light and there was a slight flavor of sea salt, yum. The roasted banana was bananas! SO good! I'm so glad I got that flavor. The flavor wasn't overwhelming and just had the right amount of banana flavor. And there was actual bananas in the ice cream! These two flavors complemented each other VERY nicely and my mouth was in ice-cream heaven. My bf got Brown Sugar and Roasted Banana. He thoroughly enjoyed his ice-cream as well :) We then sat down at one of the tables with some other customers. They weren't that comfortable. Lol :P I noticed that Bi-Rite closes at 10:00 and there was STILL people waiting outside the door! Crazy San Franciscans! The service here is average. Our guy who got our ice cream was wearing a hoodie and had his hood over his head. It was a little unprofessional in my opinion. It's like, I know you're a hipster and all but you're dealing with food products... Be a little more considerate. The other employees seemed to be having fun while working, which is good. The music that was played was a mix of Lady GaGa and other trendy music. This place is small so be prepared to have your order ready so that you won't hold up the line! I can't wait to come back and try their sundaes! Damn, I really wish there was a Bi-Rite Creamery in San Jose... :(

This place is great! This was my first time here. I got the salted carmel and the butter pecan. It was so GOOD! Luckily when we got there there was no line. Afterwards we walked down the street to a cafe, and when we walked past Bi-Rite the line was out the door! Workers are friendly, you can sample any ice cream they have that day. Some may think it's an expensive place for ice cream, but if it's good..then who cares?!!

Balsamic strawberry+ salted caramel = heavenly. The line is seriously out the door and around the corner on weekends, pretty much no matter what time of day. Weekday afternoons are good times to go if you're impatiently craving some amazing ice cream. My music teacher was holding a song creation challenge and announced that the prize was a $15 Bi-Rite gift card. Well, let's just say I immediately had the greatest creation spark in my musical career thinking about ice cream. I won the challenge, thanks to my incredible motivation, and spent about $5 on my first visit. Which means I can go 2 more times to get my favorite flavors for free!! (although I will continue to support Bi-Rite with my own $$) :D ++ The workers here are super friendly and I love that they have vegan options! - Everything is recyclable or compostable. The location is also another plus, right next to Dolores Park!

I have a hard time saying no when I get invited to Bi-Rite, but it's always a schlep because of the hard time you'll have parking and the line. HOWEVER, I must say that sometimes being in a line can do you some good. It gives you time to sit and stew about the offerings of the daily menu at Bi-Rite, and let's you settle into a few select flavor combinations that you will no doubt be mashing together in a cone or cup in just minutes. One of my classic fav's is the Lavender ice cream. It's uncommon, slightly unusual, but refreshing nonetheless. I also got got the Another plus side to rolling deep with your crew to Bi-Rite is the continued sampling that happens once you park it with your scoops and bravely dip into your friends' selections. Sharing is caring, especially when it comes to ice cream.

During our grandmother's 90th birthday extravaganza, this spot was our go-to for dessert... practically all of my family members are avid ice cream lovers, the bay area cousins, directed us here... From what the cousins were telling me, I knew this was a popular spot, and as we pulled up, we all saw just how popular! The line wrapped around the store, AND around the corner, at least half a block down... due to some quick thinking from one of my genius family members, we opted to ditch the lines, and buy a scooper for 5 bucks, and 8 or so different pints/quarts of flavors to feed the 40 peeps waiting for us on our party bus! Thus cutting the wait time by 90%: we were in and out of the store within 15 mins! on the menu: salted caramel toffee coffee chocolate roasted banana vanilla ricanellas Everything we had was excellent... and pleased all the 40 or so palettes that we were pressured to please.... would definitely return and add to my must visit again list, next time we are in SF!!! So glad to hear that they are opening up a second location!

I really LOVE the ice cream here ! I tried the salted caramel and honey lavender flavors & it was amazingggg ! The line seemed super long at first since it circled around the corner of the building. Surprisingly, it only took 20-25 minutes to reach the front of the line! It was national ice cream day yesterday so there was a worker asking customers questions about ice cream for card punches (buy 10 get 1 free) or if you answered all five questions correctly then you receive an ice cream book. The ice cream is definitely worth the wait ! =)

I've heard SO many good things about this place! The flavors are different and the line is LOOOOOOOOOOONG. Get ready to wait, rain or shine - for us, it was misty rain. The honey lavender is my favorite so far. Some think it's too floral. The salted caramel is too sweet and overhyped in my opinion. Definitely will come back for more!

I have been here many times and never wrote a review because there are already a million reviews that kind of say the same thing. ÊThen I had a hankering for BiRite the other night, bought a pint, and now writing a review while pigging away on this pint. My favorites: Earl Grey - tastes like milk tea Balsamic Strawberry - it's like strawberry ice cream with a twist Okay, I would actually eat most, if not all the flavors they have to offer. I think I have gotten smarter bypassing the line by buying pints and/or quarts of ice cream, but realistically, I have only gotten rounder. :P

You know what's nice? When you go to a place that has a large variety of flavors, and you can count on the person behind the counter to suggest something to you. I went into Bi-Rite on my tip to SF because well, I had it recommended to me 3 times. You can't ignore suggestion like that. So I go in with my friend/tour guide, and I already knew that my first flavor was going to be earl grey. Earl grey ice cream is always good, how could I go wrong? But then the cashier said "you can get two flavors" and I didn't know what to do, so I asked "what would you pair it with?" and she suggested the honey lavender flavor. Great choice! First of all, the ice cream is just about the smoothest I've ever had. The earl grey had a strong flavor, and the honey lavender was milder, by comparison, but both were unique and delicious. I'm glad the suggestions weren't wrong. Bi-Rite is really something, and I wish I had gone more than once.

This place gets so packed. Even on chilly, foggy Bay Area weather when it's past good little children's bedtimes there always seems to be a line extending around the corner! It's not surprising considering how good their ice cream is and how nice the employees are. They have such interesting flavors, like: basil, roasted banana, balsamic strawberry, that at first you cringe at the implications of such an invention. But then you summon up the courage to try them and you realize that whoever decided salted caramel would taste good as a frozen, milky treat was a genius! Personally, I always get the honey lavender and ricanelas combination. The flavors compliment each other well, and if not for that fact that ice cream makes me fat I would've bought the bring-home tubs they sell in their freezer. Bi-Rite is the prefect end to a hearty sandwich from Ike's Place. It just completes the whole meal.

I come here quite often now and still like coming here. The flavors do seem inconsistent though but I don't mind that much. I like their wide array of flavors and different combinations. Salted Caramel (Their most famous flavor) is 3.5 Early Grey - 4.5 Honey Lavender - 4.0 Roasted Banana - 3.0 The place is pretty small but it's an ice cream shop so it's reasonable. There is a long line almost every time I've been there so expect a wait and make sure you get enough to fill you so you don't have to get back in line!

The most popular flavor was salted caramel. ÊI tasted that and honestly it's not that good... I ended up getting cookies and cream (typical flavor that i could get at the market).

A local icon, virtually everyone from out of town requests to be taken here for a scoop or a pint of their fine ice cream. They have all sorts of unusual flavors, e.g. instead of boring strawberry ice cream, theirs is strawberry balsamic. Instead of standard caramel, theirs is salted caramel. Today I had a scoop of malted vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate pieces and it was honestly some of the best ice cream I've ever had. Do yourself a favor, stop by for a scoop or two. The line moves quickly, but if you're impatient skip the line and buy a pint.

Oh yes. Bi-Rite does ice cream....right! I'm lucky that I have a really amazing ice cream place pretty similar to Bi-Rite here in the Detroit burbs (Treat Dreams, whuuuttt) and (no tea no shade) I don't have to wait over 30 minutes to get a scoop there. So when I showed up I was pretty surprised to see such a line around the block. But we were there so we decided to wait. The line moved pretty quickly, I'll give them that. I decided to go with the salted caramel and roasted banana--both of which were fantastic. HUGE fan. Great variety of flavors too. I could have easily gone with anything from that list and likely been happy. Nice servers, quick service, and a great selection of toppings (although I went naked this time around to enjoy the ice cream as is). So yeah, while the ice cream is a 5 star taste experience I can't help but dock a star for the wait. Not their fault, of course, but it's hard to really psyche yourself up for that long of a wait when you know you've got something just as delish and unique at home. But if you don't have something like this around you it's definitely a must visit and a must wait!

I heard a lot of things about Bi Rite Creamery and so I decided to try it. I came with a friend Êand got a scoop of vanilla and balsamic strawberry. The ice cream tasted good but I was a little disappointed with the price to portion ratio. My friend also got two scoops, watermelon ad Ginger and the total got both was $7. I know it doesn't sound all that expensive but imagine hospital ice cream cups and two scoops of ice cream fitting into the cup.

Alright. I heard about this place for a while now. I dropped by Tartine Bakery and decided to pick a pint of salted caramel. Skipped the morning line. Walked to the freezer section on the right and browsed the ice cream cake choices. And decided to pick up a pint of their famous salted caramel for $7.99. Ok. I tasted it. And yes, it was amazing!!! I loved it. It is now my favorite ice cream place and I love salted caramel. Light and rich. The flavors are perfectly fused into the ice cream. I can't believe someone made such a great dessert.

Bi-Rite Creamery is a Must when you're in SF. They've got so many reviews, they really don't need mine, but I'll put in my 2 cents anyways. Some of the flavors sound funky as hell ("Honey Lavender? Why would I want to eat a flower? Balsamic Strawberry? I want ice cream, not a salad."), but in actuality, the funkier the name, the more flavorful and delicious the ice cream. So go ahead, be ballsy, and pick an unexpected one. They're all amazing in their own right. You can't go wrong! While I have yet to try them all (I'm workin on it), some of my favs (besides the aforementioned HL and BS) are: Salted Caramel, Toasted Coconut, Ginger, and Coffee Toffee.

Holy moly, the line is super long!!! I don't think that it helped that my friends and I were here on a day where there was an event at the park nearby. There's a far shorter line for soft serve versus the fancy churned ice cream, though we didn't have the advantage to choose from a variety of flavors. And it was still $3.50 for a cup. My selection: vanilla, chocolate, or swirl. The soft serve was actually really good. There was a noticeable difference between this soft serve and any other brand of soft serve ice cream. Definitely a difference in the milk, not the sugar. We took the ice cream to the park nearby and just chilled on the grass while eating the soft serve. Very nice for a sunny day. Was overall very good. Wouldn't come here to wait in line nor to eat the soft serve again, but I wasn't an ice cream person to begin with.

Staple of the Mission community! So many reviews have been posted already so I'll keep it brief. Parking Sucks Ambiance/Seating: Nice shop with many interesting things for sale. They have both indoor and outdoor seating, but it can get crowded at times. It's ok though because you can sit at the park outside. Ice-Cream: AWESOME! I got the coffee with almond toffee bits and the brown sugar with ginger caramel. I would recommend both! The coffee had strong flavor which perfectly contrasted with the sweet/salty toffee bits. I wished the brown sugar ice-cream had stronger ginger flavor, but it was also very tasty and a cleaner contrast from the coffee. Overall: Great Place that I would totally recommend you check out if you're in the area. They have a wide range of flavors and also sell pre-packed pints and banana splits. Tasty Tasty Tasty!

Dear Bi-Rite, I've wanted to visit you since I've seen you on Food Network. Which ice cream shop is it? The one with line snaking down the block (even at 11pm at night). Who lets you taste ice cream with metal spoons? Only you, environmentally friendly shops on the West Coast. Who is ridiculous enough to put fruity olive oil with maldon salt and chocolate? You are! Who is silly enough to think that sounds delectable? I am! Which ice cream shop has smooth pine tables on the side, and bench style seating, whose staff lets you shout as loud as you want, chat for hours and to let you slobber ice cream on yourself and get it all over your friends? Bi-Rite! Yes- Sam's sundae was delightful, the salt amplifying the richness of the chocolate homemade ice cream. The salted caramel was also delicious and the earl grey rivaled the superior quality of Shake Shake's. I will be sure to visit you when I come back!

The best Ice Cream ever? I think so. This small ice cream shop has insane flavors that I have never tasted before. I got the malted vanilla(Amazing) and something with snicker doodles in it. For 3. 50, you can get 2 scoops that melt very very fast. If you plan on eating your ice cream slow, get it in a cup, otherwise you will be slurping your ice cream nonstop.

Really didn't find the ice cream all that spectacular, but still it was a good ice cream. ÊFlavors change on a daily basis, so the menu is constantly different which is good. ÊReasonably priced, good to go if your in the neighborhood. ÊI don't think I would make a special trip for it, but its a nice place for dessert if you just ate an awesome sandwich up the street at Ike's Place. ÊOr if you just want some ice cream to eat while you lounge in Delores Park.

Ice cream always makes me happy. It is my all time favorite dessert. With that said, I've NEVER had such amazing ice cream. My bestie brought me here on a Wednesday, I came back on Thursday, Friday and Sunday. I'm beyond obsessed, its quite sad. I'm just thrilled that this place is two blocks from where I work, super accessible:D If I continue coming here four times a week I really should invest in stretchy pants.

3 days and I've already eaten at Bi-Rite Creamery twice! A fan perhaps? I think so! Luckily, my wait for this place was less than 15 minutes. The first time, I got a single cup with two flavors: salted caramel and roasted banana. I wasn't a fan of the salted caramel but wanted to get it since it was the signature flavor. It was a bit too sweet for me. ÊThe roasted banana was delicious and definitely had a unique taste to the palette. It had a roasted taste for sure and i love when a dessert has a strong banana flavor to it. Ê The second time I came I bought a scoop of ricanela (snicker doodle) on a cone. The pieces of snicker doodle cookies made the bite more adventurous and the portion was just enough to fill me and leave me satisfied. ÊNext time I would love to try the earl grey, which I heard was excellent! When you come, be prepared to wait a bit! Then head on over to Dolores Park and take some nice pics at the top of the hill :)

The line was long but it went by really fast and we didn't have to wait too long. The salted caramel was everything that I hoped and wished for. It was the BEST ice cream that I've ever tasted. I will wait in line a lot longer for that! Anyone going there has to try this. The balsamic strawberry was good but didn't have much of the balsamic taste. I would've prefer more. The roast banana was like eating a roasted banana. Good but not great though. A bit too sweet for my taste. The toasted coconut was really good. That I will wait for too. The toffee coffee was yummy with the bits of toffee. Kinda wished it came w/ bits of coffee beans too. Didn't have any toppings on my ice cream. Wanted the original tastes. But they do offer quite a few choices. I will definitely be waiting in line again.

I came here while on vacation in San Francisco on a recommendation from a friend. They have a wide variety of flavors and an interesting selection of Sundays. I chose to try the roasted banana ice cream. Boy was I not disappointed. The ice cream was thick, amazingly rich and creamy. ÊThe only downside is the long line that forms outside the small store. If your willing to wait the ice cream is definitely worth it.

I sampled the salted caramel AND had a scoop of it with the almond fudge swirl. The entire experience wasn't as transcending as I had hoped (I was in desperate need of some gastronomical inspiration that day - hence I sought out bi-rite in the first place). The salted caramel had a robust flavor that was enjoyable, but somehow the saltiness and sweetness of the ice cream didn't come together harmoniously. The ice cream was thick in texture, but not necessarily creamy. I sound very critical if only because of the reputation that bi-rite has established. The almond fudge swirl was not distinctly "almondy" per say after the first bite, but give the ice cream some time to melt on your tongue and you can smell the almonds. It was like eating vanilla ice cream with an almond after-smell. Thank you to the man who took our order at the counter! His warm greeting made the entire experience worth while. I'd come back for more bi-rite, but I'd opt for other flavors. It seems like there're other note worthy flavors to try!

My first taste of the Bi-Rite Creamery consisted of a scoop of honey lavender, ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles), brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl, and creme fraiche. ÊThese 4 scoops cost $6.25, which was served in a paper bowl. Although there was nothing fancy about these unusual flavors, they were quite distinct and original. ÊIt wasn't like eating a Ben & Jerry's ice cream, where a bunch of incompatible things were combined; nor was it like any generic grocery store brand ice cream, where the taste tends to be more sugary than flavorful. ÊBi-Rite had flavor. ÊOf the 4 flavors that I tried, I think ricanelas was the best. ÊOn the other hand, honey lavender tasted more exotic. Although their ice cream selection tastes good, the serving size and price were more or less fair. ÊFor this reason, I docked 1 star.

I love ice cream and Bi-Rite deserves its high remarks. The typical 20-30 minute wait is worth it! Trust me, the smell of the cones, cookies, and ice cream will get you hooked. As for the flavors, here it goes: Salted caramel, the most famous: 3/5 - it's good, but I expected a lot more. Ricanelas: 6/5 - OMG, snickerdoodle in my mouth. Coffee toffee: 5/5 - I love coffee so anything coffee flavored is a win in my book. Cookies and cream: 4/5 - It's good, but why come to Bi-Rite for a common flavor? Tip: If you order in a cup, you can ask for the cone on top for no extra charge. :)

Bi-rite, you are more infamous in SF than that viral video of KONY. Dare I say you are CONE-Y? Your ever so popular salted caramel is pretty good, and I hear a lot of good things about your Ricanelas, but my personal fave is the malted vanilla. I'm all about a simple ice cream flavor with nice textures and toppings mixed into the ice cream. so peanut brittle and chocolate pieces inside? nice. Your long lines? cruelty to those who flock to you for protection from the heat. However, you do a good job at moving it as fast as you can. It gives us time to catch up with friends or family. Have real face time and not the apple vesion. Your staff is very helpful and courteous and you have lots of options and varieties as far as how we want our ice cream. You are really good, I like other places better, Ê(HS and M&MM, I'll leave those abbreviated since the review isn't about them) mainly because it's equal quality for a shorter or no line, and MUCH EASIER to find parking around. It's not because of your quality, so you just keep doing you!

I usually try to hit this spot whenever im home in the city or have guests visiting from out of town. ÊIts one of those spots you need to hit once, twice, three times, and so on. the strawberry balsamic should be on their regular menu its so freakin delicious.... the line is guaranteed to be long (like to the corner) Êwhen theres any semblance of sun during the day, i guess it really depends how many samples people choose to take haha Def a place to check out while in SF, i can convert the non ice cream person into an ice cream lover (as I learned from one of my recent trips)

You're always guaranteed a line but never a seat. :) But even so, the ice cream here makes it ALL worth it. Since it was my first time, I took a plethora of samples. Which naturally, makes it even harder to make a decision when it's all delicious. Favorites that were really well done were the Earl Grey, Salted Caramel, Roasted Banana, and Toasted Coconut. It's not a huge selection, say like Baskin Robbins, but every flavor is true to it's name. It's also comforting to see that the ice cream were natural colors rather than being incredibly bright and fake. Ever since I left SF, I have been hankering for the Earl Grey and I've been kicking myself for not trying the ice cream with olive oil. So make sure you try both for me! :) There's even a really cute park across the street that has plenty of seating if the store becomes too crowded.

I've been here about 5 times and I don't know why I've never bothered to write a review. So far I have tried the coffee toffee sundae, salted caramel, honey lavender, roasted banana, earl grey, plum popsicle and chocolate ice cream with salt and olive oil. Out of everything I've tried I would only get the early grey again. I'm not sure why but everyone loves this place and I just can't figure out why. The place isn't bad but its not worth the wait. I won't mind coming again but only if someone else wants to go or I'm just in the neighborhood and there is no line.

Bi-Rite always has a huge line. We went when they were about to close and the line was still so long! We tried the salted caramel. It was very salty and rich, but it wasn't my favorite. We also had a sam's sundae with the olive oil. That was very interesting, but I wouldn't be able to eat it all the time. I think ice cream with olive oil is an acquired taste. It was a good experience, but it's not my favorite ice cream in the city.

Two great friends of ours took us to Bi-Rite after dinner at Butterfly. It was raining heavily so fortunately there was no line - pheww!!! However, we did not have so much luck on the parking part. The staff was extremely nice. They insisted on asking us to sample every individual flavors, which I've never seen before. I appreciate their effort because I believe that is how customers should be treated. The price is not too expensive and you get the quality you pay for. The ice cream texture is thick and creamy and the flavor is rich. Earl grey is my favorite among them! Single (1 flavor) Double (1-2 flavors) Triple (3-4 flavors)

I've been wanting to try this place for a while and finally this weekend, I had my wish fulfilled! I got to try their honey lavender and earl grey flavored ice-cream on a cake cone and it was AMAZING! It wasn't too sweet or overly creamy. It was just the right amount of creaminess and so refreshing! I could eat the Earl Grey one forever! At first, I wasn't too sure about the honey lavender since it basically tasted like an aromatherapy lotion.. but eventually I got used to it! The line for this place was also pretty long but I didn't mind the wait after getting a taste of their ice-cream!

It was raining today and I still went to Bi- Rite. This was a must visit for me. I've been told to go here many times from all my friends. They have a lot of flavors you won't find anywhere else. The place always has a line. This place has the most reviews on YELP. It's a small ice cream spot with great service. You can sample all the flavors before deciding. I knew what I wanted and went for the salted caramel and mint chip ice cream. The mint chip you can never go wrong with. The salted caramel is the popular one here. It's screaming sweetness! The bold caramel taste was wonderful. I've never had anything taste like this before. The creaminess in the ice cream is nice and smooth. The handmade ice cream here is worth it. I bet the summer lines here are insane. If you haven't been to Bi-rite, you're definitely missing out. Recommendation: Salted caramel

Came here for the first time yesterday after hearing about them for a long time, and decided I needed to try the salted caramel ice cream that everyone was raving about (and also to check off another 2012 Big Eat). Since it was a Monday afternoon, there was absolutely no line and we were taken care of right away. I decided to get two scoops of the salted caramel, and omg I was in heaven. I also tried their Earl Gray, and I almost regret not getting a scoop of that along with my salted caramel. Just a little warning, you may want to get your ice cream in a cup if you don't plan to inhale it, because this stuff melts FAST. Not even halfway through the first scoop, and the ice cream was dripping down our hands; we had to go back in to ask for a cup to put the ice cream in to further avoid a sticky disaster. Other than the super quick melting of the ice cream, totally worth it!

Bi-Rite Creamery came out as highly recommended by one of my friends who lives in San Francisco. Since then, I have been wanting to go here. On a Saturday night, when we were up in the city, I didn't want to miss the opportunity. Parking is on the street and it is a pain before one find a parking space. As we drove close to the Bi-Rite Creamery, we were alarmed to see a long line around the corner. We waited in the line for 20-30min before it was our turn to order the ice-cream. The good thing is, the line moves really quick because the service is zippy. I ordered an Afternoon Snack Sundae, that came with roasted banana ice-cream, caramel, whipped cream. It was delectable; absolutely mouth watering. My husband ordered a scoop of Salted Caramel and it was delicious too. So much worth the wait. The ice-cream parlor is really small, with 3 or 4 small seats inside. Most of them brought the ice-cream outside and ate by the streets. The flavors are exceptionally good; certainly a must-try. You will never be disappointed here!

ICE CREAM. GOT TO TASTE IT IF YOU'RE IN SF. IT'S A MUST! I've tried the cinnamon one, strawberry and vanilla, My friend had the salted caramel. We both don't like salted caramel, but it tasted orgasmic! That was how godly good it was!!! Their ice cream had the right amount of cream, so it wasn't too much or too less, AND the temperature being served was perfect!! I definitely would come back here again!!! Also, 2.25 for a kids size ( 1 scoop) was definitely enough for one person as a dessert.

Absolutely the best ice cream ever. Hands down. Bi-rite's ice cream is creamy and smooth, encompassing flavors for both an adult and child's palette; and, I guess, any adult that wants to be a kid again. I go to school in Pittsburgh, and there is a pretty decent ice cream place there. All of my friends rave about that ice cream, and I guess I pay lip service to that. But I will take Bi-rite's ice cream to my grave.

My FAVORITE ice cream place! Boy, if this was in my neighborhood, I'd be here everyday...hot summer day or not! Typically, I am not a big ice cream fan. I like baked goods much more...cookies, brownies, pastries etc. but this place rooooooccccckkkksss! The best thing about Bi-Rite is their ice cream is fresh and oh so simple. To break it down: Salted Caramel- a must try. It has not only a nutty caramel flavor, but also a little bit of coffee (?)...something tastes a little strong (but a good strong). Mexican Chocolate- Not sure if this is one of their special flavors and only available certain days, but it is freakin' awesome. It's a wholesome chocolate flavor with a kick of cinnamon and spice :) Totally my kinda thing. Roasted Banana: AMAZING for banana lovers. Just like you're actually having the fruit except in creamy, cold form. Bi-Rite, can you please open one of your delicious stores in the South Bay? pretty puhleeeze.

I love that they use real spoons for tasting so there's less waste, and I love that the staff was dancing and singing to the music despite the long lines. My only advice: get the single. It doesn't mean single scoop. If fact, you get two generous scoops! I got the Mint Chip and the hubby got the salted caramel. Both were delicious and with mine being a single and his a double we still paid only ~$8. What a great deal. We will be back!

It wasn't surprising how long the line was on a Saturday night, out the door and onto the street.. Surprisingly, it went by fast. The employees are very helpful and knowledgeable in terms of recommending flavor combinations. Very fun and interesting flavors you wouldn't find in a typical ice cream shop.

Great place to cool off on a rare hot San Francisco day! I didn't care too much for the long wait, but if you can get here early do avoid the long line. Located in a high foot/car traffic area, skip the car ride (because parking will be difficult) and take public transportation and go for a walk. Finally got up front and got a scoop of Coffee Toffee and Earl Grey. Yum! The coffee toffee was delightful and full of toffee crunch! Earl Grey was a little sweet for my liking but still good nonetheless. Ê I'll come back again on another abnormal San Francisco mini heat wave day. I can't wait!

80 degrees on a scorching ass day in the city and craving some ice cream to cool us down. Bi-rite is the first place that comes to mind plus the wifey's been craving it. Finally found parking and that can be seriously challenging, especially when what appears to be rave/BBQ across the street at Dolores Park. The line was wrapped around the corner as it sometimes gets but it does move quickly. I always say I'll try something different but when it comes to ordering SALTED CARAMEL comes out of my mouth. Got two scoops and killed it wishing I get a brain freeze! TIP: You can bypass the line if you want some of the pre-packed ice cream and they have a second window if you want soft serve.

We suggested going somewhere else to her but we could tell in her tone of voice that she was really set on Bi-Rite...I was thinking....no ice cream is worth a 30 minute wait in the cold!

After hearing so much hype about this place, and numerous Facebook pictures friends posted holding their ice cream bowls in front of this ice cream shop, I just knew I had to try it soon...so here I was! Was hoping to wait in line with hubby, and eat ice cream together inside, but it was impossible to find street parking tonight. So after circling around the block a few times, I hopped out of the car holding a $5 bill to grab my ice cream to go. For $5 it gets you 2-3 scoops of ice cream, and I chose Earl Grey, Salted Caramel and Honey Lavender. Earl Grey was refreshing and tasted like a cup of super sweet tea. This is a flavor I have never tried before in an ice cream and was definitely very interesting for me. A big thumbs up! Salted Caramel -- anything caramel wins my vote, and this was no exception. However I do feel that it is a tad sweet and overpowered the salted part of the caramel. Honey Lavender is another interesting choice for ice cream for me. As far as aromatherapy bath and body products go, I am not a huge fan of lavender scent. But I decided to be adv.enturous today, and I am glad I did. It wasn't bad at all, at least not with the one scoop of it that I had today...I can't imagine myself eating too much of this in one setting though, even at the end of my scoop I started to feel like I was licking my body lotion. Would I come here again? yes...I would love to try more flavors, and come hang out with my friends here. But I am not driving to this place again

SALTED CARAMEL! I'm a plain type of girl. I usually like chocolate ice cream, but at Bi-Rite, my hands down favorite is salted caramel. It's the perfect blend of yumminess. On a nice day, especially since Dolores park is right across the street, expect to wait in a long line. The line looks long and scary, but it goes by quickly. Everytime I come here, I always sample at least 2 other flavors just to see can I find a new favorite, but I haven't yet.

This joint is a million miles better than Mitchell's. Lots of unique flavors. Their Salted Caramel blew me away to dreamland! Creme Friache, a seasonal flavor, is, oof, soo delish!!!!

Bi-rite Creamery doesn't need me. Doesn't need my business, or my review (4500 and counting). But I'll give em both anyway. They are a bona fide institution and even if they got a 1000 one stars, would still be head and shoulders above almost anything else I've tried. Basically this is a narcissistic review, an excuse for me to pontificate to no one in particular about my experience. So we almost gave up after our first attempt. Parking is cutthroat, no jokes about it. Take a cab, a bus, a horse-and-carriage. Lash a leash to your dog and roller-skate if you must, but don't expect any space within walking distance without a fight. We drove off in defeat. But we came back the next day a bit earlier just to be sure. Glad we did. Parking was only two blocks away, and when we arrived, no line to be seen. It was now or never. We tried a handful of flavors to get a good grip of what they offer. And like the rest of the world, found their Salted Caramel to be super awesome. It reminded me of the See's Candies lollipop caramel flavor; robust and a little bittersweet, almost brulee-ish. Totally different than other caramel flavors I've tried, salted or otherwise. The Orange Cardamom was a close second for me. It popped with citrus and a familiar yet elusive holiday spiciness. Honey Lavender, Earl Grey, and Roasted Banana rounded out the rest. Not a bad one in the bunch. While their flavors aren't Frankenstein-crazy like Humphry-Slocombe (they are maybe a step below Coolhaus creatively) but they nail them to a T. Whatever the flavor is called, it's exponentially realized in ice cream form. Basically the Snozberries taste like Snozberries. Perfectly pure concentrated Snozberries. It's all good, Baby baby. And if you don't know, now you know.

If I lived next to Bi-Rite Creamery, I'm almost certain I'd be on my way to diabetic concerns. Luckily I'm a bit further away than "just down the street" from this sweet sensation. If you're a fro yo fan, and you like salted caramel, go to Bi-Rite on a Sunday or Monday, in which their fro yo lines offer the ever-popular flavor, in yogurt form. If you're in the mood for a little something extra, go for the "Lazy Sundae" on Sundays - salted caramel fro yos with chocolate sauce and graham cracker bits. It's definitely enough for two, and a good bang for your buck at $5. Willing to hold out and bear the over-thirty-minute wait? Go the ice cream route. Or navigate the system and check out the fro yo line, or buy a pint of the good stuff - honey lavender, earl gray, or salted caramel - whatever flavor you choose to savor.

Decided to finally see what all the hype was about at bi-rite. I felt like I was the only sf bred kid that had yet to try the awesome-ness of bi-rite. So off i went, dragging boyfriend to wait in the drenches with me. The line went pretty fast, while we waited menus were passed down the line. I decided to try a trio sample of lavender honey, earl grey and the infamous salted caramel. Boyfriend decided to be creative, and order a coke float with a scoop of pomegranate sorbet and brown sugar ice cream. Lavender honey is very subtle, as is earl grey. My favorite is the salted caramel, has a powerful kick to it. Hard to describe this distinct flavor but something that i'll remember. (Which means you should try it!) Boyfriend's concoction, was surprisingly yummy combo. The fruit pom mixed well with the brown sugar, tasting like a creamy orange pop! Conclusion: Definitely coming back to try other flavor combos!

I'm updating my review to 4 stars!! It took me some time to get used to the flavors here. I can admit, I may have not gotten the best flavors when I first came here. I learned to sample the ice cream & to choose the ones closest to "normal." I really really like this place! Mitchell's is still my #1 & the Joe's in Richmond District, but BiRite is also up there. I like how they have places to sit outside. It's always nice to people watch & eat your ice cream. I think I'll stop by tomorrow to get my fix. =)

"dainty gent, dainty gent, dainty gent!!!!" My friend made this comment on my fb and was also the first to appear after checking in. ÊShe and my gf had been raving about this flavor ever since they had it, saying it was the best they'd ever had. ÊI on the other hand wrote it off since the combination of flavors freaked me out a little (honey lavender, blood orange olive oil, fudge and sea salt). ÊThey told me "don't knock it till you've tried it!" ÊWell I finally got a chance to visit this place with my lovely gf and were ready to get the dainty gent, Êbut unfortunately we didn't since it was $7 instead of the $4-5 they had remembered it to be. :( But that aside, we still gleefully scooped mounds of delicious ice cream into our mouths. ÊWe got a "Double" size, which is 3 scoops of your choice of flavors for $5. ÊWe got the Honey Lavender (yummm), Earl Grey (yummmm), and the Blood Orange sorbet (yummmmm). Ê(Note: Yums are in no particular order and the number of m's does not mean i liked one more than the other). The honey lavender did not have the kick I was expecting from lavender (I forgot what food/drink i had that contained lavender in it before, I only remember it had some kind of pungent kick to it, though not peppery). ÊIn fact this went down very smooth with a hint of flora and had a subtle sweetness to it and was quite delicious. The earl grey was very good as well. ÊIt reminded me of milk tea, which probably makes sense since it has a mild earl grey flavor mixed in with cream/dairy. ÊI don't really like drinking earl grey by itself cuz of the bergamot flavoring, but there was only a hint of it here. ÊI guess this is how the English do. ÊI love boba/milk tea. ÊI guess it makes sense that I liked this too. The blood orange sorbet was delightfully tart and refreshing and was a nice complement to the other two flavors when the creaminess got a bit heavy. Before we got our ice cream, there was a bit of a line that went around the corner. ÊIt ended up only being about a 10-15 minute wait, but while we were in line, somebody form the shop walked down and handed out samples of a salted caramel/chocolate swirl soft serve. ÊCrapnuts that was good too. ÊI didn't taste the salted caramel as much as i did the chocolate, but it was not salt and not overly sweet. ÊI was going to enjoy it slowly so that it would last me the line, but I pretty much ended up sucking face with the little paper container (like those ketchup holder cups from fast food burger joints) to get all the ice cream out. ÊIt only lasted me about 3 steps. Overall the flavors were very good. ÊOnly giving it 4 stars cuz of the supposed price hike for the dainty gent/sundae. ÊI'll probably get another chance to head back someday and splurge on it just to see what all the fuss is about. ÊI will definitely be returning.

Despite a very long line that sidewined around the building, Bi-Rite deliciously delivered to those who wait. I ordered the double scoop with three flavors of balsamic strawberry, toasted coconut, and salted caramel. All were magnificent and memorable in their own way. They were not overly sweet and lived up to their name. Chunks of toasted coconut were actually in there. The salted caramel didn't taste like corn syrup. But my personal favorite is the refreshing balsamic strawberry. I would wait in line just for that. If they had peanut butter ice cream, I could have made a pb&j combo.Service was nice and they offer samples to try. And my afternoon delight was a mere $5. So if you're in SF, stop by, bring your bffs and check out the hot gays in Castro.

I don't know any other ice cream place that deserves over 4000 reviews and still have a rating of over 4 stars, or a line that literally goes out of the doors, onto the sidewalk, and around the corner. I was a little bit skeptical of waiting in line for something as trivial as ice cream, but my cousin recommended me to and so I did, I waited. But come on, seriously? I mean... It's just ice cream, right? No. Not right. This ice cream is more than trivial. It's more than good. It's so ridiculously amazingly delicious I can't even find the right words to describe it. This ice cream has put the word "dessert" on a whole new level. It's so flavorful, yet not too overpowering, yet not too sweet, yet so good, yet so cheap. I just, I can't even. Oh my God, why can't there be more Bi-Rite Creameries in the world?!?! :(

ohhh naked gay men... it was so good to see you as i parked to stand in line. you made my adventure in san francisco so so fun :) haha no, really. that was the most surprising event of my entire trip. this place has a line out the door with directions on where to stand so that you don't block traffic. luckily, the line goes REALLY fast, so we were there in no time :) for one adult scoop, you get two flavors. so i went with the most recommended: salty caramel, and also got the ginger because i freaking LOVE ginger. i want to LOVE the salty caramel. it was seriously so creamy and didn't melt the instant your hand heat touched the cup. it was nice and cold and had a really nice sticky consistency. BUT... it was just TOO sweet for me. you know when you have a whole chunk of honey or something and you swallow it and your throat feels crazy afterwards from the over-sweet taste? that's how i felt. but it was still yummy :) the ginger was PERFECT. just enough ginger taste without giving too much heat so that you could ENJOY it. in addition.. everyone working there seemed really nice... except for our lady. i think she was just tired or something. it was really short and unsmiling service, but whatever. it's icecream. get it, and move on. next... on to the market ;)

Wanted ice cream and we found this place. Saw a phat line but went into the shorter line, i guess just for simple cones. I had a chocolate, vanilla swirl which was very awesome and tasty. As i got more towards the middle i found a hole in the middle of it. The way the cone was swirled on, it left an air hole in the middle of it. I felt a little ripped off lol. My girls ice cream cone was the same way. Is that a signature way of building a soft serve cone? haha. Would I go here again? Maybe if there wasn't anything else around. The lines are ridiculous here anyways. I'd rather have an It's Its lol.

This was a a great treat to have after wandering the city on a warm sunny day. Had a scoop each of the orange cardamom and earl grey ice creams. A little tea-like theme, but it was really good. I did try the salted caramel, but that stuff was intense and sweeter than I was hoping (I wanted more salt). Had a bite of my friend's tangerine sorbet which was fresh and light, reminding me a little of my favorite sorbet place in DC - Pitango. The line was long and around the corner, but with all the people watching you're doing, the wait is bearable.

Everyone raves about the Salted Caramel but i got me cookies and cream and honey lavender. I also tasted the Brown Sugar with ginger and something else, and that one was really good cuz you get the brown sugar but not overwhelmingly and i did not taste the ginger AT ALL, which i like =) The honey lavender was a little overpowering on the lavender part....kinda to the point of not liking it, so no honey lavender for me next time...but i love cookies and cream and this one was just right.!

I moved here in October of last year, and for months, whenever good dessert places come up in conversation, so does BiRite Creamery. Whenever I'd be in Dolores Park, I'd see a line outside of the store. And now, finally, I know why. The ice cream is crazy good, that's why. But not just that, the staff is nice. Like, they're really excited about ice cream. Super nice folk. When my friends and I got to the front of the line (which didn't take too long, all things considered), we asked to try a few flavors. I tried the banana--yum!--and the honey lavender--YUM. I went with a small portion of honey lavender, and I may never be able to eat another flavor of ice cream ever again. There is limited indoor seating and a few benches outside, and, well, Dolores Park to sit in right across the street. This is a great spot for a refreshing, sweet treat!

The crazy ice-cream line says it all. Flavors to die for. Stop thinking, just get in line, you won't regret it. Is it a hipster thing? Not at all, just don't listen to them. Once you're in line, get your instinct working. What flavors do you want? What's good? Here's the hint: ALL THE FLAVORS ARE AMAZING! It just depends on what mood you're in and what are you craving most! With me, I'll go with the medium triple flavors of : Salted Caramel, Roasted Banana and Honey Lavender. Sometimes even Salted Caramel x 3, because often times I felt like I needed just a little more of the salted caramel. I'll continue this soon. Ima get myself some ice cream.

+Salted Caramel +Honey Lavender ($4.25: 2 scoops) The combination of both was like a DREAM; it had the RIGHT amount of saltiness and sweetness without one over powering the other. ÊI have never been more confident in a mixture of two flavors in my Ice Cream-tasting career. ÊIt's nestled near the corner of the street (perfect for the infamous wrap around line underneath some trees) and is across from Dolores Park! I went on one of the hottest weeks in February.

Tip #1: My friend and I learned this lesson. If you are going to get a pint, you do not need to wait in line. Walk straight into the store and go to the register. My friend and I waited 15-20 minutes in line. When we got inside, we decided it'd be more worth it to just get a pint. That was when we saw the sign about waiting. We got the Malt, Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate flavor. I could taste each single element in the ice cream at different times but it didn't really come together as a single flavor to me. It just felt like I was eating those three different things and if that was the case, I'd really rather have a box of peanut brittle in my hand than tiny pieces of it in ice cream. The ice cream however was really creamy. You could tell that the quality was good. And even as someone who doesn't like ice cream, the creaminess was pretty addicting. I found myself eating more than I normally would, which is only about a taste or two.

Bi-Rite's got a great mix of value ($2.50 for two scoops) and flavor (the salted caramel is a San Francisco institution, but you'll find kid-friendly staples mixed in with crazier flavors). The lines are insane, if you're in SF on a rare hot day you can count on at least twenty people queued up. My two pro-tips: 1) Eat ice cream before your meal. Come just at noon, or even earlier. 2) Order pints or ice cream cakes over the phone. That way, you can skip the line and go right to the counter. You miss the magic part of tasting the different flavors and watching them scoop out your one or two favorites, but you get that much more time back to spend in Dolores Park.

This place reminded me so much of Pitango in Baltimore. The infinite flavors and creativity of all the flavors. It was so hard to narrow down the choices, but I usually go for the unusual or the funky stuff. Ricanelas and brown sugar got my votes and that's what I went for! The snicker doodles were my favorite part of Ricanelas, the brown sugar had hints of ginger which was delicious as well! With the price in mind, creativity and the fact that it's organic ice cream, you are getting a steal here! Ben & Jerry's charges a lot more whereas Bi - Rite is independent, organic and original with their flavors.

The perfect Sunday: get ice-cream from Bi-Rite and go to Dolores Park to people watch & soak up some sun. What separates Bi-Rite from most other creameries is the unique flavor choices. Ê Yes, the ice-cream is creamy, rich & delicious... but when I first came here, I was completely taken back by the choices. ÊRoasted coconut, salted caramel, coffee toffee, earl grey... the flavor selection can be tricky because the majority of it is unconventional.

So I was here last week during my San Fran vacation. Back when I was still in L.A. I looked up top rated places and with OVER 4,000 REVIEWS... I had to check this place out. Never seen anything with over 2500 reviews. So it's called "Bi-Rite", a play on the word bi, as in bi-sexual I guess since its in the Castro/gay district of San Francisco. The line outside when we got there at 6pm was surprisingly long... (about a 10min wait) ...which wasn't too bad. --------------------------------------------- I got "the triple", which was my choice of 3 large scoops of ice cream or 4 normal sized scoops. I went the variety route and choose 4 scoops. I tried the SALTED CARAMEL flavor first which was the most popular flavor here on Yelp. I was originally hesitant (salted ice cream) but IT BLEW MY MIND!!! It was so frickin' good. I asked the scooper what the most popular flavors were cause 2 of the ones I wanted were out of season/stock. She recommended "Earl Grey", which was nasty (think Earl Grey tea). I also tried Almond Fudge Swirl, which was okay and Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and it was "meh." ----------------------------------------------- All-in-all the SALTED CARAMEL was absolutely amazing... the other flavors, not so much. Would love to try 2-3 flavors that I thought sounded good but were out of season. It's decent not worth the 4500+ reviews.....

It's good ice cream but I don't have dreams about Bi-Rite. ÊBut definitely must stop by if you are in SF. All flavors are very bold and taste exactly like they sound. -Salted Carmel: Yum! Not salty so don't be scared to try it! -Roasted Banana: Mmm very banana! One of the fans from here. -Coffee Toffee: I was very disappointed. Coffee is my favorite ice cream flavor, but I did not like the flavor. ÊIt was more like straight coffee bean. -Brown Sugar: Taste good with Roasted Banana! Tip: Come on a rainy day and there will be no line!

Decided to stop by here spontaneously while in the city because one of my friends could not stop thinking about the ice cream here. It was my first time here and we were really lucky to beat the rush aka a stampede of little kids all ready to get their bi-rite on. I got the salted caramel and toffee coffee(?). The salted caramel was pretty good, but I think it's overhyped. On the other hand, the toffee coffee BLEW MY MIND! If you love coffee ice cream, then I guarantee that you'll love toffee coffee or coffee toffee.. whatever the hell the name is. I also tried my bf's honey lavender, but that wasn't for me. It tasted too much like flowers. If you're a fan of rose milk tea I'm sure you'd love this though! I ended up getting a single in a cone which came out to be $3.50 for both flavors. I secretly wanted a double but I didn't want to look like a fata$$ since all of my friends were getting singles too... Sigh :'( I also like that they let you sample any flavor(s) you want and there's no rush to choose. The staff was extremely friendly, the prices are reasonable, and the ice cream is super unique and super delicious. 5 stars for this joint! In the words of Arnold Schwarzenegger, "I'LL BE BACK!"

Had the Salted Caramel and Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl. You know the food is awesome when it reminds you of other things you've eaten before!!! The nutty, dark caramel flavor reminded me of carmel popcorn when I was a kid. Hands down best ice cream I ever had. The Brown Sugar and Ginger Caramel was awesome too. Could definitely taste the strands of ginger caramel and it tastes exactly as you think it would. Do yourself a favor and stop by Bi-Rite Creamery when you're in SF!

Birite is a small local creamery located in the mission. It's staple is the salted caramel which is a hit with everyone. I sampled a few of their ice creams and all were pretty delicious. I ended up ordering the malted vanilla w/peanut brittle and almonds. Really good. The prices were very reasonable. I would say this spot can get very busy as I was there on a Wednesday at 230pm and there was a line about 5-10min long. If you are in the mission looking for dessert don't hesitate to stop here

The perfect pairing to a beautiful day at Dolores Park: delicious ice cream. I have only been here once, but I can't wait to be back. I had the roasted banana and balsamic strawberry ice cream. Banana ice-cream can be tricky; I have tried some that tasted too artificial and others that were too thick and overwhelming. Bi-Rite; however, does it right. The banana is indeed the star, but the taste and aroma of the ripe bananas are not overwhelming. I also really liked the balsamic strawberry. Unlike other strawberry ice-cream, this one wasn't very sweet. There is a subtle bite to it (perhaps the balsamic vinegar?). At any rate, this one has has a unique taste. I also tried the minneola popsicle. I really liked this too because the popsicle is made with the fresh fruit and more or less tastes just like a fresh minneola. All in all, a superb first experience.

I waited in line for 30 minutes, and I was not left disappointed. I got the Dainty Gentleman, which was perfection - honey lavender ice cream drizzled with blood orange olive oil, sea salt, and hot fudge. I would've never thought to combine these ingredients together, but it was truly amazing, the best ice cream I've had to date. We also picked up a quart of the salted caramel, just because it was so highly rated on yelp. It was a sinfully delicious treat to have at home, and made me wish we had some of their hot fudge to drizzle on top ourselves. The lines suck, but the end result is so worth it!

What I ordered: Trifecta = salted caramel, brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl, and malted vanilla with peanut brittle and chocolate (A-) I am beyond over the ice cream fad. I know i'm going to lose a foot to type 2 diabetes anytime I try anything adventurous at Cold Stone's and no amount of celebrity inspired junk is going to make me shell out dough for Ben & Jerry's. Sorry Berkeley favorite Ici, I do not want your Rose Petal flavored ice cream, I've eaten one in real life, not good. In Ice Cream form? Not appealing to me in the slightest. And after hearing endless rants about the amazingness that is Bi-Rite, I was pretty sure that I was immune to this one too... I was wrong. The long lines are worth every second, do yourself a favor, ignore the impatient people behind you when you get to the front and take your time to sample anything you desire (which is precisely why the line is so long to begin with but well worth it). I'm sure you've read earl grey and honey lavender are staples but I went classic and got a trifecta, not too sweet and completely refreshing. To get the full effect get it in a cup so you can get a spoonful of all three at the same time, you'll go blind for a couple of seconds and meet God.

- Locale Destination - It's on 18th St and Doloress St in San Francisco. The location - right across street from Dolores Park - and the ice cream quality make a ridiculously long line. Go there on a weekday, when raining, or when cold so that you can avoid the line. If you want to get bigger sizes like a pint size, those are ready to go at the fridge nearby the counter. They take a credit card!! Decor is pretty simple and casual. Cozy atmosphere. They got a few tables inside and outside seating. You need to get a key for bathroom - it's on the counter. The staff are very friendly. Ask for tasting and try them before buying it. Don't do that so much if the line were long... ;p I think the price is very reasonable for the gourmet ice cream. Less quality ice cream/gelato places in OC/LA charge a lot more than this. Ê - Gluttony Expedition - They got ice cream, soft serve, cupcakes etc.... Earl gray: Awww.. My favorite. Love it. Honey lavender: Lavender flavor was strong yet delicate. I like it ;) Brown sugar: Ice cream itself was just so so but the caramel sauce was a bit bitter and very very very good. It enhanced the ice cream. Good. Roasted banana: Great roasted banana flavor. Love it. Salted caramel: Too rich for me. One bite is enough for me. Over-hyped. Meh. Ginger: Very ginger - strong flavor. Not for me. Balsamic strawberry: Seasonal, not now ;( Ugh.. I was soooo looking forward to it ;( - Conqueror's Deduction - Many of my yelp friends told me about this place, so I was so excited to try their ice cream. Very tasty ice cream. It's light yet sophisticated creamy texture. Nothing is overly sweetened. Great flavors and interesting flavor varieties. High quality ice cream. The hype was very true!! I think "Bi-Rite" is slightly better than other competitors overall. I also liked the choices of scoop size - the small size allowed me to enjoy several flavors without being too full. Also you can go big! I tried several super popular places as well - "Mitchell's" and "Humphry Slocombe Ice Cream". These are my overall opinions: - "Humphry" is very similar to "Bi-Rite" (quality wise) but slightly lighter than "Bi-Rite". "Bi-Rite" is a bit better. "Humphry" got more peculiar/exotic flavors (Breakfast, saffron etc.) and less varieties than "Bi-Rite". You need to be more adventurous at "Humphry" than "Bi-Rite". "Humphry" got a less line than "Bi-Rite", which is great. - "Mitchell's" is a lot creamier, less sophisticated, bolder flavors and got more Asian flavors than "Bi-Rite". "Bi-Rite" is like a "Fine Dining" ice cream, and "Mitchell's" is like a "Pop&Mom" ice cream.

On a hot, sunny day, I decided to follow the masses, and try out this place. I love ice cream, and others seem to love bi-rite so... why not. The line was long, but hey...it's always that way. The soft-serve line was very short but it's soft serve. The menu of selections was quite large and they give you a menu to peruse while standing somewhere near the corner of the block. I got the salted caramel and the toasted almond. I will say...I liked it. ÊI didn't love it as I had hoped to. It was okay. I also wish they knew more about which were not gluten-free as the girl that helped me didn't know so i went with the safe bets. All-in-all...if there is not a line here in the future...sure. I'll come back. However, it wasn't worth the wait on an average day.

Maybe my high expectations as being one of the 7x7 big eats made me think I was going to be mind blown when I had their ice cream. Hmm... not so much. I tried many flavors including the salted caramel but nothing that's making me salivate right now thinking about it. I got malted vanilla which had chunks of peanut brittle and milk chocolate pieces. I like how the pieces were cut finely so it didnt affect the smoothness of the ice cream. The roasted banana was pretty good too but my boyfriend ended up going with earl gray (he's not much of a sweets person). Earl gray was a nice compliment to my malted vanilla because it wasn't as sweet. They DO take card here so that's a plus! There is a nice park across the street that we walked around while we ate our ice cream. The line can look daunting but it moves pretty fast. I would come back though if I was in the area to try one of their sundaes or even their ice cream cakes. I cant help but compare it to ICIs in Berkeley and ICIs has to win because of their chocolate covered cone in the inside. Noms. P.S. Parking can be difficult!

This place was calling my name after I tried Coffee Toffee from a pint my sister brought home. As we rolled up past the Bi-Rite sign, there wasn't a single person in line and I seriously thought it was my lucky night... then I looked up the street and realized I had only seen the market; the actual creamery was up further. The line stretched around the block! Luckily, the line actually moves quickly. If you just want to buy a take-home pint, go right up to the counter. They have some weird cococtions and while I can't say I absolutely love each one, the best thing about their ice cream is that all the flavors just come together well regardless of how odd the ingredients sound. Coffee Toffee is by far the best with a strong coffee element (what else?) and bits of sweet toffee to balance it out. I also enjoyed the burnt, smoky flavor of Salted Caramel. These are a popular must-try! Orange Cardamom had me curious... found out it was a spice that makes the ice cream taste like ginger. It wasn't bad but wasn't for me. Honey Lavender was interesting in that it made me feel like I was eating a spa. Or eating lavender oil used in a spa. Could be gross or delicious depending on how you look at it. Again, the flavors came together well, just didn't tickle my taste buds the way Coffee Toffee and Salted Caramel did. Will be back to try their other popular must-try, Earl Grey.

This place is absolutely amazing, I've only walked by here a few times and even looked in to see the flavors they offered (which tend to be unique and sometimes exotic). There is almost always a line and I always looked over this place cause it's usually when I'm on the way to Tartine or Benny Gold. It wasn't until this place was mentioned on Top 10 places in US on Yelp that I decided it was finally time to try it out. It was a cold Monday so there wasn't a line but there were still people in and out buying ice cream. My friend and I shared a single scoop of honey lavender and orange cardamon. The ice cream is amazingly smooth and the flavors are absolutely delicious. There's no point in even trying to explain how it tastes besides that it must be a sin to have tasted something so good. We even sampled the earl grey which tasted exactly like we expected, not some artificial flavor you sometimes get from other shops. Even though we shared the single scoop, we were both extremely satisfied and felt we had enough. Though we wouldn't mind to get some more. This place definitely lives up to its hype and for a single scoop (which is basically two scoops because the kids is only a single scoop) for 3.50, I think I can say this is the best place for ice cream. I've had Ici's, Mitchell's, Fentons, and Smitten. Bi-Rite beats them all overall for taste, price, value and selection (that doesn't mean those place are bad either!). Put this on your must try list, you won't regret it. 4000+ reviews at 4.5 stars says it all. Note: I also had Cool Haus in Los Angeles but I felt it wasn't fair to compare them due to location difference as well as Cool Haus making their selling point in ice cream sandwiches out of a truck.

I honestly don't get the hype of this place. Went here for dessert the other day. It was raining so the store was completely dead. The workers were super friendly and willing to let us sample whatever flavors we wanted. Sampled the Salted Caramel and wasn't too impressed. Had a hint of a smokey flavor which I liked, other than that it was just "meh" could have used a tad more salt and more predominant caramel flavor. ÊI felt like Humphry Slocombe had a better Salted Caramel than this place. I ended up getting the Malted Vanilla (which came with peanut brittle) and the Roasted Banana. The Roasted Banana was my favorite out of all the flavors I tried, however like all the other Ice Creams I tried the flavor didn't really POP. Definitely could have used more bananas. Don't get me wrong it was pretty good, but nothing I'd go out of the way for (so far my favorite Ice Cream place seems to be ICI). Would be interested in trying the Sams Sundae if in the area though (= (Ps. The Hot Fudge is not Hot, but still good =p )

Holy sh!t the line is long! But so damn worth the wait. It's usually wrapped around the corner so if you're standing right there, the wait is about 20 minutes.

The ice cream here is of very good quality, and the staff is pretty nice about giving you samples (they should really switch to plastic spoons..when I went they were using metal ones. it slows the line down). Overall, I'm impressed with their unique selection of flavors - although they are on the girly side. I got the ricanelas, which is a snickerdoodle flavored Ice Cream. Delicious! Good thing there was no wait when I went, because I think I'd be let down if I waited more than 20mins. Maybe I'm saying this because I had this right after I had Ike's... Anyway, would I come again? I'd check it out if i were in the area, because no doubt the ice cream is top notch, but would only go in if there was a small line...i would recommend the same if you're not an ice cream fanatic.

Every time we've passed Bi-Rite, my boyfriend always tried to tell me the history and how great it was, pointing out the line that is forever present outside even in the winter. I never paid much attention, because I mean, how different could Bi-Rite possibly be from any other ice cream place I've ever been to? I was wrong. Best ice cream EVER. I need to try all the flavors, because just when I think I've had the best, the next one tops it. They have seasonal flavors, vegan options, ice cream sandwiches, cakes, pies, popsicles, sundaes, and the shelves are lined with gourmet fudge, caramel, cookies and cocoa that would make great gifts! I can't wait to come her win the summer. It will be the perfect cold treat on a hot day (or any day, really.)

I now know for certain that there's an ice-cream heaven - the only kind of heaven, as far as I'm concerned - because I've been there. And it's called Bi-Rite Creamery. Sure, I've walked past on sunny days and seen the line winding around the corner. But I always dismissed it, chalking it up to the fact that warm weather makes people crave ice cream. Unless you're me, in which case you crave ice cream in all weather all the time. Point is, I truly didn't realize how amazing their product was until I finally put it in my mouth (that's what she said, I know, I know). Bi-Rite offers an incredible array of homemade flavors, such as - and yes, I tried ALL of these: salted caramel, vegan chocolate coconut, honey lavender, malted vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate pieces and brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl. The woman scooping behind the counter saw the look on my face and just kept giving me samples. It was amaaaazing. The toppings are equally as awe-inspiring, and I felt like my order simply wouldn't be complete without almond toffee or peanut brittle. I was right. There is a small corner with benches, and if you're lucky enough to snag a table, it's amazing just to sit and smell the aromas of the creamery. The waffle cones are wafting, cookies are baking, the place might as well burst into song. As we walked out of Bi-Rite at 9:30pm on this particularly cool evening, a guy walking past us turned to his friends and said, "Who would get ice cream in THIS temperature?" I grinned and yelled, "MEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!"

Can I please give this place at least an extra star or two? I haven't been in a while, but Bi-Rite Creamery is absolutely, hands-down my FAVORITE place in the entire universe. The long lines that you see stretching down the block should give you a hint as to how amazing this place is. The honey lavender and salted caramel flavors make my heart sing. Even just the thought of them makes me choke up and do a quick Orbitz search for one of those mistake fares you hear about sometimes. It's not cheap, but for what you get, it is the best value anywhere. No trip, I repeat, NO TRIP to San Francisco is complete without parking your fanny in line and getting some ice cream from Bi-Rite.

My husb chose to introduce me to Bi-Rite since he was convinced, after 3 of 3 fantastic experiences, that I would love it. He chose a day that we were in the Mission, a cold and blustery day where most people were probably slurping ramen somewhere in Japantown. That means: a short line at Bi-Rite. He wanted Bi Rite to start off on a good note with me, since I. Hate. Waiting. In. Lines. Unfortunately for him, I found the ice cream underwhelming. Now: there's good flavor selection and plenty of pros to this cute ice cream shop: - clear signs of what is gluten free, vegan (there's a coconut based vegan ice cream - our day was chocolate coconut - as well as a sorbet option) - lots of gourmet flavors (salted caramel: can't go wrong; and of course, something with lavender and/ or cardamom) - free tastes before commitment - lots of sizes available: kiddy, single, double, and $7 sundaes if you're like me and enjoy your ice cream complicated - a relatively fast-moving line - small area to eat indoors, with a big water fountain and a restroom So why I won't be returning - I found the ice cream... not special. It wasn't creamy or memorable. The flavors were good but didn't stand out. Texture was mediocre. Maybe I got wind of a bad ice cream batch. I dunno. Plus, the baked goods were far better to look at than to eat. I had a sweet & salty peanut cookie that was crispy and bland. Neither sweet nor salty. More like a biscuit. At least it was cheap (75 cents). Well, it was worth a shot. And it's still cheaper than Ici, 'though not by much.

I would drink tea every day for the rest of my life if it was actually Bi-Rite's Earl Grey ice cream. Then again, I would eat anything from Bi-Rite every day, for the rest of my life. Actually, after standing in line for 20 minutes and scarfing down our ice creams on a bench outside the shop, everyone I was with seriously considered getting back in line and doing it all over again. It was that awesome. All of it. It doesn't really matter what you order, it only matters that you order. You will not regret it.

Salted caramel... the standard that all other ice cream should be judged against. The long line is part of the experience and makes that first bite a reward for all your zen like patience.

Absolutely delicious ice cream! ÊWe got lucky and only had to wait 10 minutes on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. ÊI had the salted caramel with coffee toffee. ÊWowza! ÊThe salted caramel is a delicious burnt sugar treat with just a hit of salt to scintillate your taste buds. ÊThe coffee toffee has a great, strong coffee flavor with actual granules of coffee and perfectly sized toffee chunks. ÊMy companion had the Brown Sugar with a Ginger Swirl and Balsamic Strawberry. ÊThe strawberry was okay - good flavor, but I would have liked chunks of berries, which I did not see. ÊThe brown sugar with ginger swirl was the second best ice cream that I have every had - a great lighltly molasses flavored ice cream with a spicy-sweet ginger swirl. ÊLoved it!

The salted caramel is the BEST here. ÊNot too salty. ÊNot too sweet. Ê I wasn't as impressed with their other flavors. ÊI sampled the honey lavender, coffee, and ginger. ÊAll three were just a-okay. Ê Parking is hard to find here, so come on a weekday.

I'm not an ice cream fanatic, but I can say with confidence that Humphry Slocombe has got my vote for best ice cream in San Francisco. ÊI'm sure thousands will disagree, but I'm also sure that just as many will agree. I tried 4 flavors at Bi-Rite: Cookies 'n Cream Almond Fudge Swirl Coffee Toffee Salted Caramel Cookies 'n Cream - I've had better at Carvel. ÊAt Carvel the actually crumble the entire cookie (w/ filling) into the ice cream. ÊI was expecting the same at Bi-Rite. Almond Fudge Swirl - A new flavor that didn't explode nearly as much as I had hoped. Coffee Toffee - decent, but I prefer the Vietnamese Coffee at Humphry's. Salted Caramel - very good, but I'm going to say that Sweet Rose Creamery (LA) is better. Are the long lines justified? Ê-probably for the other flavors... I didn't try all the flavors, but I wasn't overly impressed with the flavors I did try. ÊAnd because the lines were so long, I didn't want to be a punk and hold it up any further by asking for a taste of everything. Prior to visiting Bi-Rite, I had sampled the "Complete Breakfast" as Humphry's and also had the most amazing gelato pairing at the Ferry Bldg. ÊSo it's not like I was overly hyped. ÊI was still on cloud 9 from my previous experiences. ÊUnfortunately, Bi-Rite brought me back down to earth. I'm sorry Yelp friends...

I think this place is a bit overhyped. I was lucky to find parking right in front of the store on one of my trips here (of course after having to circle the block about 10 times) AND the line was short - about a 5 minute wait. ÊBut on most occasions, there's a line wrapped around the building unless you get lucky like me! I got the salted caramel on a cone which tasted eh, funky. But don't get me wrong - it's not that bad! They're cool with giving out samples which is always a plus! Their scoop is literally half the size of a typical ice cream scoop. This place is super tiny with very limited seating. ÊThey have outdoor seating as well and a park directly across the street which is nice to hang out at on a sunny day. The staff is very friendly and patient with indecisive customers like myself. I would definitely make a trip back here if I'm ever venturing in the area!

I LOVE BI-RITE! ITS SO GOOD!!! The ice cream is creamy and full of flavor. The flavors I like are the honey lavender and the salter caramel, even better if you put them together. I mean... GENIUS! They have the new earl grey flavor, ugh its great too. it kinda puts me in a weird bind, so when u get into the front of the line and you have to try both, when u secretly know how both of them taste, but you have to try because you just can't decide (i really need to stop doing this)... solution: switch, one day earl grey, one day. Let's save some time here people... the line is long. When u really wanna treat yoself throw the salted caramel in there! I always get one kid scoop, cheaper, less calories, not too indulgent on a regular cone. winner! Customer service is excellent, willing to to cater to your taste bud needs even when it means 10 tastings. They also offer great suggestions! Tip: go to Delores Park across the street and enjoy your sweet there.

There's nothing like ice cream on a cold, San Francisco day. If you're from LA, Bi-Rite is equivalent to Scoops, but just a little better (as proven by the ridiculous hour long lines outside Bi-Rite). -Honey Lavender-- creamy, with a hint of lavendar. Not too overwhelming, not too bland,... my Goldilocks senses approve. This was pretty good, but not as good as the... -Ginger!-- Right? Ginger ice cream is weird! Again, being an LA native, I would say it's equivalent to the Stinking Rose's garlic ice cream = weird, but so, so good!! Ginger tasted great with honey lavender so these two are a great combination :) -Salted caramel-- self explanatory. Again, Goldilocks senses triggered: not too salty, not too sweet, just rite. -Roasted banana-- AMAZING. Have you ever had those toasted banana chips from Trader Joe's? This tastes like that, but in creamy ice cream form. Yes, it's a weird purple color, and no, bananas are not purple... but two wrongs definitely make a rite here. I loved Bi-Rite despite the line, the weather, and the shadiness going on around the bend in Dolores Park. But here's a **TIP-- line up a couple of hours before the sun sets so you can enjoy your ice cream while the sun is still out. No sun + ice cream = no bueno (speaking from the perspective of a brisk February day).

Do I need to bother with a review when everyone else has raved about this place? ÊYES! ÊIt's for me. ÊThank you to the management for opening such a special no-frills shop. ÊSince having their salted caramel (and ginger) ice cream, nothing from other places even tempts me. ÊThe smooth, tasty, intense flavor lingers in my memory like no other (of course in a good way). ÊJust wished we live closer so I could try all the flavors. ÊMy daughter had the brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl & coffee toffee. ÊEqually delicious! ÊIt helps also that they have seats inside (though not many), so if you are there on a cool day, you can still enjoy your ice cream without freezing.

So I was touring San Francisco with two "natives" of the area, and both suggested at separate times that I try the Bi-Rite Creamery, so it came highly recommended. The place is pretty small and the furniture felt almost kid-sized. Luckily (?) it was a cold and windy day, so there were not many customers and the line didn't stretch out the door like I was told it might. I tasted the salted caramel, which I was told was a big deal, and didn't particularly like it. So, I went with a brownie sundae, which was a mix of hot fudge, brownie, vanilla ice cream, spiced pecans, and probably some other things. The brownie part was great, but between the brownie, the fudge, and the nuts, there literally was not enough ice cream to balance out all the sweet flavors. It was definitely something that had to be eaten with some water on the side. I probably need to come back and try multiple items to get a better feel for the place, but just from the tasting and the sundae I had, I thought Bi-Rite was good, but not particularly memorable.

ÊIt makes sense that it's the most reviewed establishment on Yelp. ÊWhat Yelper wouldn't want to go to the Mecca of local business? Ê Taking the advice of the more than 4,400 reviews, I went with Salted Caramel. ÊI'm not sure if this is their goal, but it tastes like a Werther's Original in ice cream form. ÊAbsolutely. ÊAmazing. I also had a blueberry soda, because I was thirsty. ÊI commend Bi Rite for having a selection of off-beat sodas for me to choose from. ÊI was thirsty, and one can only drink so much Coke. I did not wait in line more than ten minutes. ÊI'm not sure how long the lines can get, but there is no wait too long for Bi Rite.

Bi-Rite serves delicious ice cream, and fortunately I love ice cream too much. If you come during a down-time, they're generous with their samples. ÊI can understand why people will feel rushed during a busier hour, though. Both times, I've had Salted Caramel and Ricanelas. ÊNothing against the other flavors, I just enjoy these two a lot. ÊRicanelas in particular, because they remind of CHURROS. ÊCinnamon and sugar is a delicious combination. ÊHowever, whatever kind you choose will sure to be bursting with flavor. Ê A double scoop runs around $5 dollars, and you can choose up to three flavors. The place is situated near a park and a high school, and there tends to be parking just a block down. Bi-Rite is delicious! ÊThere's a lot of delicious ice cream/dessert places to get in SF, however, so take your pick!

This place is by far my favorite ice cream place so far. My trip would not be complete if I hadn't stop by Bi-Rite for their ice cream. Every time I'm here though, I'm torn between what flavors to get because they're all super yummy!!! Honey Lavender is always a must for me and other flavors like Salted Caramel, Earl Grey, and Roasted Banana are tasty as well. Can't wait to come back for some more ice cream! Oh and they have stamp cards for buy 10 get 1 scoop for free. The workers there don't point these out but there should be a stamp card at the register.

I've lived in SF my whole life, but have never gone here until the other day. I wish I found this place earlier! I got their salted caramel and early grey ice cream. Everyone raves about their salted caramel, but I feel like it's nothing extraordinary. But don't get me wrong, it was good. I also took a pint of salted caramel home for my family, and they all loved it. I personally liked the earl grey a lot better! It wasn't too strong, but you could taste the early grey. I wish I bought a pint of this one too! Do get ready to wait in a line no matter what day you go. I went on a random weekday and there was a long line to wait in. Although I did beat the crowd by just a few minute. Parking is also not the best in that area. Might take some time to find parking. =/

I went here with some friends and the serving size was incredibly small, so after the first serving we went back to get more. Well the staff is just incredibly delusional! My two friends and I all tried this ice cream that they called "salted caramel" which it clearly wasn't. Each of us ordered the salted caramel on our first time in the store so we knew they'd gotten either all our orders wrong the first time or this time. This flavor was so disgusting I literally threw up in the park across the street. We went back to tell them their mistake, oh and after I'd given them a $5 tip the first time, and the lady at the counter was like "oh no I know all the flavors and what they look like and that is salted caramel. You're wrong." After her trying to convince me that I'm wrong for 5 minutes I simply turn my back to her and walk out. I figured the best I could do was give this place an awful review to the best of my abilities and give the FDA a call to about their clearly disastrous organizational abilities. I'm allergic to chocolate and easily I could have had a horrible reaction if they'd screwed up my order any worse. Well the FDA hasn't gotten back to me about what their exact results were, but they did notice something awfully screwy that they've decided to investigate further.

I've developed a mad taste for Bi-Rite's Candy Cane flavor, which is available only in Decemberish. I don't really know what I'm going to do next Decemberish, because I've given up dairy products, but I will say this: I officially became vegan in mid-January. Coincidence? I think not. While I contemplate all of the circuitous routes I'll be inventing to avoid Bi-Rite later this year, I am thoroughly enjoying their chocolate coconut vegan flavor. I also grudgingly appreciate the fact that, when you order vegan ice cream, they warn you of the milk products in the hot fudge sauce if you try to sneak that in. Bastards. I mean, thanks guys, you totally have my back. Yeah, I'm new to this. ÊBut in all seriousness, Bi-Rite does actually have your back if you are trying to avoid dairy. The ice cream is also phenomenal, but you already knew that. There are 4430 reviews now, and the overall rating is still 4.5 stars.

DOWNFALL: selection of ice creams is VERY LIMITED!! they have the same 5 flavors over and over and I just wish they had more of a selection or variety depending on the season...

After stopping for lunch at Ike's Place and coffee at Philz Coffee, my friends and I were super stuffed. But! I still wanted to check out Bi-Rite - famous for their gourmet ice cream flavors and featured on Best Thing I Ever Ate. (They say girls have a second stomach for dessert and I am one of those girls!) HONEY LAVENDER: I sampled the Honey Lavender and found it too floral for me. SALTED CARAMEL: Instead, I opted for a scoop of Salted Caramel. I had heard that it was one of their most popular flavors. It was really rich and creamy, but I actually did not like the burnt caramel flavor. Although I didn't particularly like the flavors I tried this time, I'd still go back to sample some of their other flavors. Hopefully, next time I won't be so stuffed so I can try more flavors!

I just had to see for myself what the hype was all about. Best ice cream in the world? So many people have claimed this title, but who actually deserves it?! My friend and I got there at 5:30 pm on a Friday. It was our lucky day because we found parking right in front of Bi-Rite- 2 free hours after 5PM! On top of that, there was no line! I've heard so many raves about their "salted caramel" ice cream. I was hesitant because I never was fond of it when I tried it. I ordered the small size (two mini but good size scoops total) of Earl Grey Tea and the Salted Caramel for $3.50. Boy oh boy, I am wrong. The salted caramel ice cream is to die for! It is not to caramel-saucy and not too sweet. I don't understand but it is just so good! The Earl Grey Tea was good, but I had the Salted Caramel first so the taste overpowered the early grey. They have such unique flavors that I can't wait to come back!

Salted caramel tasted like burnt marshmellows (in a good and bad way, just like a burnt marshmellow does!) ÊBalsamic strawberry was okay--you expect it to be way insane with such a non-traditional pairing of flavors, but it's just a different style of strawberry ice cream. ÊThe true standout was the amazingly buttery brown sugar with the sweet ginger caramel--that alone was worth the wait. ÊCan't say the price is, though.

Love the ice cream here! Yes, you have to wait in line most of the days but the line moves fast. They let you taste as many flavors and there are some amazing flavors here, so it is hard to decide. They also have great sundaes but it's the ice cream that makes me come here whenever I am in San Francisco. My favorite flavors are the salted caramel, coffee toffee, cinnamon and ginger....the ginger one made me cry out in delight, the flavor is so subtle and so good...it's amazing. My husband had the brownie sundae (housemade decadent brownies with vanilla ice cream, chocolate and burnt caramel sauces, whipped cream, and candied pecans)...it was delicious! Unfortunately, my husband liked it too much to share, so all I could get was a bite but it was heavenly! Another thing had won me over was their bio-degradable spoons and containers...awesome! Overall, delicious and freshly made ice-cream....you can't go wrong by coming here. I only wish I was in SF longer so I could try more flavors.

Wow, does anywhere have as many reviews as this place?! I've been here 3 times now and am thankful that it's not around the corner from my apartment or I would be here all the time! BiRite has fabulously unique flavors; it's a truly an artisanal ice cream spot. I've tried the salted carmel, balsamic strawberry, brown butter pecan, brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl, and some kind of s'mores sundae if I remember correctly. Everything was intensely flavored and scrumptious! Depending on when you go, you should expect to wait in line. They churn people in and out quickly, though, so even if the line is to the corner, it doesn't take too long to get up to the counter

Right after trying Ike's place just not too far from here, my friend took me to here right after. I was so surprised that this place was ranked as one of the best places to get ice-cream; however, I was not disappointed. I got the cookie monster, which is basically a combination of cookies and cream plus their own custom ice-cream (I don't recall what it was called, but it was like a cinnamon graham cracker flavored) and it was absolutely delicious. I was so thankful that the worker had recommended it to me. To my surprise, this was all home made and not some factory ice-cream pumped by the pint. In addition, I could see them working in the back making the delicious looking ice-cream cakes. I absolutely recommend any one in the area to come here since I am actually not from this area.

the last time we were in SF, we attempted to go to bi rite but were discouraged by the long line wrapped around the block. this time we were determined to go early. on our mission to hit as many spots before our flight home, we went to bi rite right when it opened. there was no one there and the only thing that took long was deciding what we wanted to get! the salted caramel was good. you could taste the saltiness and it wasnt too overpoweringly sweet. the coffee toffee was also pretty good. it tasted like a good coffee ice cream with chunks of crunchy toffee in it. the early grey was also pretty good and tasted just like a cup of earl grey tea! you can get it in a cup or cone and one or two flavors. you can also get their pints which are also sold across the street at the bi rite market. service is friendly and efficient. i was definitely happy after finally going to bi rite. its a definite must-go-to place while in SF.

A creamery that has a line out the door as long as a night club line????!!!! Either something is seriously wrong or seriously right! Lucky for me, something was seriously right. The line was looooong (about 30 ppl in front of me) but it went by quickly. A menu was passed up and down the line and there were a variety of options to choose from. I got a "single scoop" which is actually 2 small scoops of ice cream of different flavors if you want. I listened to fellow Yelper Evonne L.'s Êrecommendations and went for two of her top flavors: ginger and earl grey. It was DELICIOUS. I was torn because she also said salted caramel and roasted banana were amazing as well but I couldn't stuff down any more food than I had that night. The GINGER was such a pleasant surprise. It was perfectly creamy, slightly sweet, and had a flavorful kick to it. I loved it! Ê Would definitely wait in line again to try more!

It's great! I've only been there a couple times and have had the required Salted Caramel Ice Cream. Ê I'd recommend it. If it's a nice sunny day, then it's a definite. ÊGo there, walk around the Mission, go to Dolores Park or just sit at the bench outside. If you are on vacation, it's worth the trip and you'll probably also discover something new and exciting outside of Union Square and the Golden Gate Bridge! Also, I think they have to charge extra if you say you are going to eat in. ÊSo...don't forget to say, "to-go!"

This place definitely lives up to the hype and the long line out the door, down the street, and around the corner is justified. ÊDon't be intimidated by the line; it moves rather quickly. Salted Caramel seems to be one of the most popular and rightfully so and it is DELISH! ÊI was also able to try out the Roasted Banana, Ginger, and the Brown Sugar to which all are yum. I also like that this place gives you real spoons to sample. Closes at 11pm Fri and Sat night so make sure you stop by for some dessert after dinner.

Some say I am too easy with my ratings, but this 4 star is well deserved! A simple ice cream shop may not seem like much, but trust me... this is a great stop! I am a huge fan of anywhere with great service and this place tops my list and one of the best! The workers are very friendly and very patient! There was a bit of a line, yet the workers tried to be very patient and hurried at the same time! The worker to helped me out answered all my questions and even suggested different combinations, depending on the types of flavors I liked. I asked to taste their Salted Caramel, Coffee Toffee, and Mint Chip. All three were quite amazing! I would have ordered a pint, but because I was on a trip, I had no place to store it. I ordered a single size of Salted Caramel and Coffee Toffee, which is a GREAT combination for anybody who loves their ice cream sweet! I started with the Coffee Toffee, which is a simple Jamaican coffee ice cream with nuts and caramel chunks inside. It was a great tasting ice cream, and the crunch that came with the nuts and caramel was a great add-on! Next, everyone's favorite; the Salted Caramel. I've tried other Salted Caramel and I'd put this on about 3rd on my list! Their concentration of flavor explodes into one's mouth, but not enough! It's hard to describe unless you try it yourself. The ice cream's initial taste is very good, but fades a bit too fast. Other cie cream kind of lingers in your mouth to allow you to enjoy the taste til the next bite, but at Birite's, their ice cream forces you to shove bite after bite! Word of advice, unless you're a VERY good parallel parker, let someone's who is drive! It's all street parking and the people here are very stingy with their parking. As I was eating my ice cream, I saw one woman love tap both cars in front and in back SEVERAL times before actually parking her car. So please.... if you can't parallel park, let the better drivers drive.

Now - I'm no ice cream aficionado and the ice cream I had here was very nice, but just because there seems to always be a long line (at most weekends stretching around onto Dolores St) does not mean their product is superior. Correction, the ice cream, salted caramel and a choc chip combo (in a very dry sugar cone) was better than nice, I give Bi-Rite Creamery that. I'd even go far as saying it was quite delicious, however so has most of the ice cream I've had across the Mission, nr Filmore St even in Westfield Mall. My reasons for why the line is so long, is that 1) there is no competition in the immediate vicinity and it's by a park (a cheap mobile ice cream van would be equally busy in such a location) and 2) the serving space is the size of a shoe box. I've seen bigger trunks than the tiny little fridge the ice cream is served out of, coupled with the minuscule entrance doesn't make for a very efficient nor practical place to deal with such a high volume of people. It's impossible to see what's on offer until you get right up to the fridge and we all know that we like to sample a few flavours before deciding what to actually choose. No wonder the line is so big. If you have the luxury of going mid week outside peak hours, worth a try otherwise hop round the corner, pick out a magnum ice cream from the convenience store and quench that thirst for ice cream in a fraction of the time...just sayin'

Where else is spending $84 on ice cream (in one visit ) justified? The ice cream is simply delicious, but my one true love is the chocolate chip / vanilla ice cream sandwich. Not only is the vanilla ice cream buttery perfection, but the cookies are fresh, crispy and filled with chocolatey goodness. I can eat 3 in one sitting, followed by a soft serve cone of balsamic strawberry. While I'm not crazy about every flavor (Salted Caramel and Honey Lavender to name a few), there's definitely more than enough appetizing favors to choose from. Usually I just stockpile the pints and sandwiches from the soft serve window to avoid the line.

Absolutely amazing. Bi-Rite definitely lived up to its hype and I am so glad I finally was able to make it here. One of the yummiest places on earth! My friends and I were spending the day in San Francisco, and of course we had to take advantage of the gorgeous weather and grab a scoop of ice cream. We had lunch at Pizzeria Delphina earlier, and walked two blocks in order to get here. Luckily, my friends and I were able to get our ice cream just before the line got long, so we were able to get in and out within 10 minutes or so. I could not decide which flavor I wanted to get: honey lavender, chocolate almond swirl, the flavors all seemed so delicious, so much to the point that I was salivating (which may sound a little odd). I ended up choosing a single scoop of chocolate almond swirl and salted caramel (side note: for single scoops you can combine two flavors if you would like and for double scoops you can combine up to three). The two flavors complemented each other extremely well; the salted caramel was definitely something new for my taste palette, and I really liked it. The ice cream was absolutely amazing; every single bite had the perfect balance of salt and sweet, nothing was too overbearing, etc. It was so good that no words could describe it except that you have to go there! There is not that much seating around the shop, so my friends and I decided to walk around Dolores Park before heading back to Union Square. This ice cream shop is, like I said for the hundredth time, absolutely delicious. I would definitely come here every week if I lived closer; this place should definitely be on your food bucket list!

Like everybody else, we came here because of the hype. ÊAnd like everybody else, we waited in a long line to get our ice cream. ÊBut unlike everybody else, we don't think this is the BEST ICE CREAM EVER! Ê We tried a variety of flavors; salted caramel, mint chip, roasted banana, and malted vanilla, ÊAll of the flavors were good, and the quality was obviously very high - all of the flavors were very creamy and rich. ÊBut, this place may not be for you if you prefer classic flavors over these trendy new flavors, Like I said, it's not the best ice cream ever, but It's still good and worth trying. ÊPersonally, I like classic flavors more, so you're more likely to find me at Mitchell's!

I had the biggest and longest craving for ice cream. Told my girlfriend to take me to an ice cream place after dinner... and HOORAY, I LOVE THIS PLACE!! They let you try as many flavors as you'd like. Be considerate for the long line behind you! I love how they give you metal spoons to try different flavors! I ended up getting the salted caramel and orange cardamom. 2 scoops for $3.50! My flavors kind of clashed, but I still enjoyed both while sitting on an old school desk looking table/chair. Used their restroom and got a hold of the whisk key! Also, got to spy on the girl making ice cream in the back! Eek, maybe I shouldn't have spied on her because I saw how much heavy cream was put in that pot! WHO CARES! This place is no place to frown upon the ingredients put into their ice cream! I like how they make all their goodies in the back. My gf knows I'll probably come more often than her, so I got to keep the frequent stamp card :)

Waited in line for about 45 minutes to get the salted caramel ice cream. It was definitely worth the wait on a hot day. I am not a big ice cream guy but I do admit the ice cream was very good. It was way better than a Baskin Robbins. Slightly better than Cold Stone ( which is pretty good as well) They let you sample the flavors, so you can taste it before actually buying it. The lines can get long I am assuming. It's really nice because there is a park nearby and you can grab ice cream and just chill. If I lived in the city I would probably go occasionally when the weather is nice.

It was a cold night, but there was still a line out the door. There was a bouncer, as another patron puts it, who directed the line. I already knew what I wanted, Salted Caramel, their most popular flavor. After inching toward the front of the line, I sampled the Orange Cardamom (recommended by the bouncer) and Earl Grey. The Orange Cardamon had a strong flavor, so it masked the Earl Grey. I tried some more of the Earl Grey and I loved it! As for my Salted Caramel, I also loved it! Creamy deliciousness! I'm glad I was not disappointed by this popular establishment!

Why did I not write a review? OH GOD WHY DID YOU CREATE CALORIES AND FAT AND WHY AM I SO VAIN. Normally I can't finish a single serving because ice creams tend to be too sweet and rich. I don't seem to have that problem here. Huh. This place was the place that got me into earl gray ice cream. I swung by it today by chance because I was in the Castro, and to my joy, they had it! AWESOME! Best earl gray ice cream EVER. I also tried their salted caramel (yums, tasted a little like slightly burnt caramel and that was cool), the snicker doodle thingey ( don't remember the name, but it was super sweet) and I love their sundae with the caramelized banana and the berry compote. Every time I come here, there is a line. Today was an especially unseasonably warm day, so I'm not sure if I was supposed to be surprised. Come on, I was able to walk around at night without a jacket... that is almost unheard of. Servers are super cool and friendly.

I can say going to get an Ice-cream from BiRite is a complete excuse in itself, to travel to San Francisco from the east bay.

You know it's good when it's cold and there's a line for ice cream. I almost skipped trying it because of the bitter wind chilling us as we waited. The guy behind us told his friends you could get some fudge on your scoop instead of a whole sundae, so I got roasted banana and malted vanilla with hot fudge. Amazing! Perfect dessert after pizza at Delfina. My boyfriend got brown sugar with ginger swirl which tastes like a creamy Ginger cookie. Mmm. Worth the chill!

Lord have mercy that was some damn good ice cream! I wasn't sure what to expect but upon walking toward the place seeing the velvet rope outside I knew I was in for a treat. An ice cream place that gets a line like a club? Must be good right? Hell yes! I had the Salted Caramel and the Brown Sugar with burned Caramel swirls. I was in Caramel heaven. Seriously delicious ice cream and great service too. Although I didn't try any samples you can pretty much get samples of anything you want.

What's new to say about a business that holds one of the, if not THE, largest number of reviews on Yelp? - The last time I got ice cream I regretted getting two scoops because it was too much. So this time I got the kids-size scoop of salted caramel and regretted it about halfway through because it was just not enough. It was too awesome. - Salted caramel is closer to "Caramel with a burnt kick that tastes a lot like a Werther's Original". - Did I mention how good that salted caramel was? Because it was so, so very ditch-your-commitments-to-grab-some good. Yes. Yes, please. YES PLZ even. Stop by.

Hmmm...just about 4300 reviews with an average of 4.5 stars, you know this place gotta be good. It's really hard for me to describe just how good this place is.... It's so good that even though I'm painfully lactose intolerant and was without any lactaid, I still had 4 scoops of ice cream. It's so good that standing in line for what seemed like an hour didn't bother me at all. It's so good that my boy is now working in a sweat shop in Shenzhen making kicks for Nike. (Just kidding son, Dad would never sell you into slavery for ice cream.) It's sad but Hawaii has nothing even close to ice cream like this. ÊIt's so creamy and the flavor combinations are so unique. ÊTrue, the line was damn long. It went out the door and stretched WAY around the corner, but it was definitely worth it. Others have told me if you go early on a weekday, then the line is barely anything. ÊOn the weekends though, forget it, be prepared to wait. Ê The thing I like about Bi-Rite is they don't make things overly sweet so the flavors take the forefront. The flavors we had: *Salted Caramel...OMG, indescribably good. Super rich caramel flavor balanced out perfectly with sea salt. ÊMy favorite here and it's always on the menu. *Roasted Banana...Intense banana flavor with a nice hint of roasted goodness. *Strawberry and Balsamic...Might sound odd but it just works. *Honey Lavender...I had them drizzle blood-orange olive oil on it, amazing *MInt Chip...Good minty flavor. *Toasted Coconut...Intense flavor here too. The flavors here are rotated regularly so check out their website for what flavors they're serving that day. ÊThe seasonal flavors are also a must to try.

There's so much hype for this place that I had to try it out! And of course I decided to try it out on one of the hottest day in April. The line was pretty long, and after waiting moving up the line a few inches after 20 mins, I decided to go to dinner first then come back when the line was shorter. After dinner and drinks, we came back to Bi-Rite and line was still long! However, it moved a lot quicker than before and was able to order around 20-30 minutes. So much goodness to choose from! I ended up ordering salted caramel and earl grey ice cream. I wasn't a fan of salted caramel, but earl grey was so good! I tried the cookies n cream and that was pretty good too.

Great, creamy ice cream! I don't know how/why it took me so many years to discover it, but finally, I can say, I've tried it! ÊFortunately, for going on a Monday afternoon around 5pm, I didn't have to wait in line for more than 20 minutes. Although I know their Salted Caramel flavor is what their known for, I decided to try their Toasted Coconut and Meyer Lemon. ÊBoth were great flavors, and who would have thought that the two would make a good combination together. Since I didn't have the Salted Caramel in the store, I did take a pint home. ÊFor the future, I would recommend bringing a cooler if you're going to have a long drive home. ÊSalted Caramel, in general, is a softer ice cream and doesn't freeze solid, so by the time I got home, an hour later, it was quite soft. ÊIt re-froze well, but we weren't able to enjoy it at it's peak consistency that night. I can't wait to try all of their other flavors!

4.5 stars! Venture outside-the-box or be more daring and go for the vegan chocolate coconut ice cream and/or the orange cardamom! Both flavors go well together. The orange cardamom had a wonderful exotic aroma to it. ÊIt reminds me of an Indian dessert. ÊThe ingredients that they use in their ice cream really shine through, such that your palate and senses can actually distinguish them. ÊThey are also not overpowered by the rich, sweet taste of sugar and milk that typically forms the base of regular ice cream. Ê I was disappointed they didn't have the olive oil drizzled over sea salt dark chocolate ice cream that I had seen once featured on the FoodNetwork. ÊHowever, all their other flavors are just as unique and good. The next time I visit, I hope to also try the balsamic strawberry, if available.

One year and two visits later, I figured it was time to finally write this - never mind that I only took a bite the second time around though! I'll keep this (relatively) short though, given how many people have written about Bi-Rite already. Their flavors, while fairly traditional (with the likes of chocolate, vanilla, butter pecan, salted caramel), are very good: strong, but not overly so, and quite tasty. Rich and very creamy, their ice cream is somewhat reminiscent of frozen custard. Not inherently a bad thing, but one must be in the mood for something like this. Lines at night tend can be intimidating, but, as long as people aren't taste-testing every flavor, it actually moves fairly quickly. Alternatively, show up earlier in the day when there's almost no line - nothing wrong with a bit (or a lot) of ice cream in the middle of the day! The venue itself is accessible, but requires a bit of finagling to get in and out of, due to the single queue pole that essentially cuts the width of the entrance door in half. $3.20 or so will land you a single, with two scoops (of different flavors, if you so choose). Personally, I'm more likely to go to Humphry than Bi-Rite, but this is mostly due to the fact that they have more unique flavors than Bi-Rite does, and is also a bit lighter (so one can eat more!)

I'm not a big fan of flower-favored ice cream because it makes me feel like I'm eating potpourri, but Bi-Rite makes a wicked honey lavender ice cream that balances both! The initial taste gives you the sweet lavender, and then the light honey aspect hits you near the end of your first bite! The salted caramel is too rich for me. Their cookies n cream flavor was a bit disappointing -- I'm a HUGE cookies and cream fanatic, so I would've preferred more oreos/crunch to it, and less cream. I also liked their malted vanilla though -- it has a nice crunch with the brittle! Tip: The junior/kid size is ONE scoop= one flavor, their normal size is TWO scoops!

Believe the hype!!! The toasted coconut was my favorite. I also tried salted caramel, coffee, and malted vanilla. ALL GOOD! The line might look scary, but it moves quickly.

Finally got around to trying this ice cream everyone talks about! In my book, it's really a 4 star, but it saved my SF trip from being a disaster after a super disappointing meal, so I bumped it up to 5. Came here on Sunday to try to get it, but the line was ridiculously long so I opted to make the experience more dramatic by prolonging the wait. Came here again at 6pm on a Thursday night, and yay not a single person in line! Weekdays are magical for these popular places. Sampled the salted caramel I keep reading about, but the taste was a bit too intense for me. Shared a single scoop with the Earl Grey and the Honey Lavender with the bf for $3.50. A bit pricey considering the dinky size of the scoops, but I guess for unique flavors and the ultra smooth texture, it's worth it? The Earl Grey was delicious! At first I couldn't taste it, but then I realized that they had JUST the right amount of tea flavor. The flavor is ridiculously light, but it's strong enough for you to taste. I wish boba places could make their Earl Grey Milk Tea's as smooth as Bi Rite makes their ice cream. Sigh. A girl can hope. The Honey Lavender was pretty good. I probably wouldn't get it next time, but I just wanted to try different flavors since it was my first visit, and probably only for a while. I guess I'm not much of a fan of lavender, because I know I had Lavender Milk Tea once and wasn't too impressed. (Sorry for comparing everything to boba, but that's the only thing I have to go on.) Walked across the street to Dolores Park afterwards to eat our dessert. I like the ice cream+park combo. You get to walk off some of the calories you're ingesting. Pints are $7, which if you think about it is an extremely great deal since that only gets you 2 single scoops. The shop is extra small, but the servers are extra nice. I'll definitely come back whenever I'm craving some Earl Grey!

Who doesn't like ice cream? But...have you ever had gourmet ice cream? The flavors here are unique, hand crafted and organic where possible. Many of their ingredients are also sourced from local farms and businesses, so you can feel good about eating lots of this stuff. The service was super friendly and patient allowing you to sample anything. I tried a few of the flavors, but at the recommendation of many decided to go with a scoop of the salted caramel. It had a bitter, salty, and sweet taste all at once. Delicious! I also had a scoop of the brown butter pecan which was a little creamier, sweeter but just as you'd expect butter and pecans to taste - incredible! There's usually one hell of a line around the block but at 8pm on a Monday night in the middle of winter, there were only 5 people ahead of me. You can only pray for parking around here so good luck! So worth the drive and the wait at anytime!

So it's my fav time of year.....PUMPKIN TIME! ÊAnd it was time to try Bi-Rite's pumpkin At their suggestion, I paired it w/ a scoop of the Brown Sugar & man-oh-man was this just sinfully delish! Thick swirls of brown sugar caramel-toffee-like-thingy & ginger bits to all pair up w/ the creamy light flavored pumpkin. Have to say I think the pumpkin at Mitchells is still my all time fav but this Brown Sugar-Pumpkin combo has me still craving it even weeks later The BF got the Banana & Salted Caramel & he was in heaven. ÊIt was all I could do to part w/ even 1 taste of my combo but I did eventually relinquish & I think he liked mine better - although he wouldn't admit it. Ê But I could see the look in his wanting eyes.....wanting that Pumpkin & Brown Sugar! ÊWe'll just see what he orders at our next visit.....

Wow this place is popular! Loooong line out the door. ÊRight next door is where Bi-Rite sells their frozen yogurt and other baked goods. ÊAlso quite a line. Ê Tried the salted caramel and honey lavender. ÊThe salted caramel had a very strong taste. ÊIt was personally a little too sweet and overindulgent for me, but I can see why it's so popular. ÊThe honey lavender tasted slightly weird at first, but the taste grows on you after awhile. ÊI love how they sell their various ice cream flavors in pints & quarts to take home. ÊThe shop itself is also cute and the servers are patient in helping you figure out what flavor you'd like. ÊI'd go back to try other flavors and the fro-yo next door.

I am stuck between whether I like Bi-Rite better or Mitchell's. They both of pretty unconventional flavors added onto the regular ones. I tried a few of them but I felt bad making the others in line wait for me to try soooo I went ahead with Earl Grey and Mint Chip! I usually never get a cone but I guess I was just in the mood for it! Anywho, the staff/employees are reaallly nice and they let you try all the flavors you want. If you have a subconscious, then you'll just try a few. Haha. It's a tight place with not much room but you will definitely not miss it because they have a line that goes down and around the block! Yum. It was conveniently a very sunny day too. Too bad their ice cream melted so quickly...

Life will never be the same... I am not a sweet nor a dessrtaholic. But, i had to try it for myself. The staff is so friendly, full of energy and VERY patient. ÊWe could not make up our minds for the life of us... We made our own sundae http://www.yelp.com/biz_É which consisted of a scoop of toasted coconut. mint Êchocolate chip and chocolate coconut . Topped with hot fudge, whipped cream and macadamia nuts. I must say this was THE best sundae I ever had! The depth of each of the flavors were just perfection!

Yum! got the honey lavender and the almond fudge swirl.

I liked the texture of the ice cream too...smooth and creamy. Honey Lavender- smelled like lavender, tasted like lavender. Êthe texture was good, but nothing especially stood out from other honey lavenders I've had. Almond Fudge Swirl- like what its called, its vanilla ice cream with chocolate swirls and almonds mixed in. Next time I'll be in SF, I want to try more flavors!

I have recently revisited Bi-Rite, Humphrey Slocombe, and Mitchell's and I feel I must update my previous 4-star review of Bi-Rite ice cream to 5 stars. ÊBi-Rite's scoops are slightly larger than Humphrey Slocombe's, and they allow you to get two flavors in a Single, unlike Mitchell's. ÊNot to mention that Bi-Rite's sea salt caramel is hands down my favorite ice cream in SF. Ê They also have excellent customer service. ÊI brought an out of town guest there and the girl behind the counter waited patiently while she sampled one flavor. ÊI said my favorite flavor was the sea salt caramel and without asking, the girl offered her a sample of that too. ÊWhen she still couldn't make up her mind, the girl said you're welcome to try more! ÊFinally, after 3 samples, a decision was made.

Bi-Rite Creamery is amazing! Lots of different flavors of ice cream that you can play around with, or a menu full of colorful creations already created by the staff.

Some of the best ice cream I've had! I got the ginger snap sundae (or something) and was offered either the regular size or the small size by the employee, which was greatly appreciated because the small was still plenty! The ice cream was superb, the berry compote was good, and the whipped cream was delicious. I went sometime at night, so there was barely any line. It was also cold out, which probably had something to do with that. I'll definitely be back when I visit again! I think I'll have to try the salted caramel next time judging by the other reviews.

Let me preface this review by saying that I like Bi-Rite's ice cream a lot, and that I've been a regular customer for more than 7 years now. But this past weekend, I was terribly disappointed. Some friends were visiting from Boston, and when I was considering what San Francisco must-see's to share with them, one of the first places that came to mind was Bi-Rite. It's such a special place in my mind that I wanted to make sure that my friends experience what I have been able to enjoy so often for so long. But when we arrived at the door, we were turned away rudely by one of the service staff (he appeared to be one of the clean-up staff). Yes, we arrived at 10:05, five minutes after closing time. But the doors were open, and there was still a line 4 or 5 patrons deep. I pleaded with the man, trying to explain how special an opportunity this was for my friends, but he refused to budge, and went as far as to say, "I don't care - I want to go home." The folks behind the counter were clearly still helping out a line of patrons, and there was no one waiting behind us. We ended up walking away, with a poor taste in our mouths. I understand that I am describing a story where I was asking someone to go beyond the normal expectations of their job to help a stranger. Perhaps I was asking too much, and perhaps I am unfair to generalize my reaction from one interaction to the whole store. But this was a very disappointing experience, and it very much tarnished my feelings about this store. I hope the Bi-Rite will have the opportunity to read this review and assess the service levels of its staff.

Bi-Rite's ice cream is by far the best in the city. Their salted caramel flavor is an ice cream miracle. The line may look daunting, but it moves fast. Come here on a sunny day and take your treats to Dolores Park. Their S'mores Pie is also a go-to in my house for birthdays and other festivities - graham cracker crust, gooey caramel, chocolate ice cream and perfectly toasted meringue = heaven! -1 star because their soft serve really doesn't live up to the incredible amazingness that is their regular ice cream. I guess they've raised the bar so high, I expected them to keep it there.

Delicious icecream and odd flavors. ÊNo afternoon on a sunny day in Delores is complete without a few scoops. ÊI tried three! (dark chocolate, coffee toffee, and salted caramel). while all three were stellar, the shining star goes to the salted caramel. YUMmmmmmMms Price: (kinda high) $5.00. If you buy a pint for like $7, it is more cost effective. ÊIf you share it with a friend, you will only have to pay like 3.50 each for half a pint. PLUS no waiting in the super long line if you're just buying pints.

I love Birite! Parking will always be difficult and there will always be a line, but everything is totally worth it once you take that first lick! The line goes by pretty quickly because the workers are very efficient and friendly. They have all sorts of flavors: Honey Lavender, Salted Caramel, Roasted Coconut etc. They also have basic flavors for ridiculous people like myself. :) They allow you to pick two flavors for the smallest cup. I've tried the Salted Caramel, Honey Lavender, Mint Chip, Vanilla, Cookies and Cream, Toasted Coconut, Roasted Banana, and my absolute favorite.. Ricanelas! There's enough flavoring in each scoop and the consistency of the ice cream is thick and creamy. My least favorite would have to be the Salted Caramel, though. For some reason, it had more of the salty than the sweet. As previously stated, Ricanelas would have to be my absolute favorite! The ice cream was not too sweet and had enough snickerdoodle cookies mixed in. Staff is pretty friendly as well and prices are reasonable for two flavors. I'll definitely be back!

I think the 4000+ reviews speak for themselves. ÊI'm just adding to the noise. Bi-Rite has wonderfully unique flavors, most of which taste as delicious (or even more so) than they sound. My favorite was definitely the Ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles). ÊI'm a big fan of cinnamon, so go figure. Brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl was also very tasty. ÊThe caramel added a nice texture to it. Pumpkin was only ok. ÊI've had better pumpkin-flavored ice cream. Salted caramel was good, but tasted a little burnt to me. ÊI think that's what they're going for, and it didn't bother me much. ÊI wouldn't have minded eating a whole scoop of it, for sure. I wasn't a fan of honey lavendar, though. ÊTasted kind of like soap. ÊMaybe my ice cream taste buds just aren't sophisticated enough. Overall, excellent ice cream - definitely worth a visit (or more).

I'm lactose intolerant and I forgot my lactase enzyme pills the day I came here. Oh well, any pain is worth it for me when it comes to ice cream, and this was no exception. I told my friend, "This place better be the sh*t and worth the 15 minute walk!", and I can safely say that it was worth it. ÊWe waited in line for about five minutes and I opted for a small brown sugar with ginger and a scoop of toasted coconut, which was reasonably priced for under $4. I enjoyed them. A lot on the sweet side, and I could definitely taste the full-fatness of the cream, so it was purely decadent. Worth the extra 4 mile run I have to do to burn it off.

Bi-Rite Creamery is one of the best ice cream places in the bay - hands down, everything lived up to the hype for me. ÊIce cream texture and flavors are as good as Ici in Berkeley. ÊAlthough Ici has better cones, Bi-Rite is cheaper, offering two flavors for the price of one serving. We didn't wait in line for very long and almost all of the flavors were still in stock (take that, Humphry Slocombe!). ÊI ordered a scoop of honey lavender and ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles). ÊMy sister ordered salted caramel and toasted coconut. ÊEverything was amaaaaaaaaze. ÊThe ice cream texture is rich, creamy, and reminds you exactly why ice cream is infinitely better than frozen yogurt. ÊThe flavors are beautifully subtle - the honey lavender was one of the best variations of a floral flavor that I've ever had. I am only sad that I didn't try Bi-Rite sooner. ÊI can't wait to return to try their sundaes.

Bi-Rite Creamery is definitely the spot to check out if one is seeking a bold and intense ice cream flavors. Came here with a friend and we both tried the salted caramel and strawberry vinegarette. Let's just say we both truly enjoyed it. It was definitely different from the other ice creams because of its richness in flavors. Trust me when I say the wait is worth it because after Bi-Rite other ice creams just taste alright. Definitely looking forward to coming back and trying out other flavors.

Luckily my friends had to push back our brunch by 30 minutes which gave me time for a pit stop at Bi Rite! Ice cream followed by bottomless mimosas... I couldn't have planned a better day!! Anyway I judge every ice cream shop by 1 flavor which is mint chocolate chip. This is my favorite flavor and a basic which is why I feel it is an excellent flavor to judge a shop on. Bi Rite did not disappoint with their mint chip! ÊIt was slightly better than the mint chip I had at Joe's in the Inner Richmond. It was just a tad bit better but I didn't have to wait 20 minutes at Joe's! Once inside the store service was quick and friendly. They even asked if I wanted a sample! I didn't expect that considering the long line but I took advantage of the offer! I sampled the almond fudge which was delicious. Ê To sum up: Long lines but well worth it! Also if it hasn't already been mentioned they are opening up another shop on Divisadero. I'm still deciding which neighborhood to move to in SF but when I heard this NoPa made it to the top of my list :) I'm only half kidding, I really love my ice cream!

Bi-Rite Creamery, where have you been all of my life? It's rare to find a cuisine void in Chicago, but two recent vacations shined a light on the fact that Chicago is seriously lacking in the artisan ice cream market. Sure, we have a few homemade ice cream places and the gelato trend is booming, but we lack the small-batch inventive ice cream flavors I've encountered elsewhere. I didn't need to read any Yelp reviews to know Bi-Rite Creamery was special; on my first attempt at ice cream, the lines for regular and soft serve were bananas; stretching down the street and around the corner! Not having the time or patience to brave the line, we decided to return on a weekday (pro move - almost no waiting). The sizing is a little unusual, but promotes maximum flavor tasting. A single gets you 1-2 flavors, a double 2-3, and a triple 3-4 flavors. Despite this, it's still really hard to narrow down your choices - everything sounds good and they provide a few staff combos to really throw your brain into a tizzy. On my first visit, I ordered a double - brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl and malted vanilla with peanut brittle and chocolate. It was fabulous, I gobbled it up like it was the last supper. The flavors complimented each other nicely, but my clear favorite was the brown sugar - sweet, but not overly so and so creamy! My friend got a double with coffee toffee and the famed salted caramel. While delicious, decadent and reminiscent of caramel corn, I'm not sure I could handle a whole scoop of salted caramel. Once I was bitten by the Bi-Rite bug, I plotted my return before heading home, I was haunted by all of those untasted flavors. A little obsessed, I actually jogged from my hotel to Bi-Rite and back. Since I was working on my fitness, I didn't feel guilty going with a triple - honey lavender, ginger, and maple walnut. Again, the ice cream didn't disappoint; rich and dreamy, I devoured it. This time, my favorite was the ginger, closely followed by the maple walnut. If you're visiting SF, plan a visit to Bi-Rite Creamery - you won't be disappointed. If you're a local and haven't tried it yet, go...now!

When I lived in Berkeley, my roommate and I would make trips to SF just to get some of this ice cream. Yes, it's that good. Ricanelas is my favorite. Smooth ice cream with snickerdoodle cookie bits mixed in? Heck yes. I like that you can get two different flavors with the small size.

Bi-Rite still has some of the best ice cream you can find in SF and the entire Bay Area. ÊJust yesterday went for a holiday outing here and had to give their seasonal candy cane ice cream a try as it was a first for me. ÊDefinitely a novel idea and it has a lot of potential but just not something that you want to eat a lot of past the first few spoon fulls. ÊIt would have been fun if they had some candy cane bits in there. Ê What blew me away was their toasted coconut flavor. ÊI'm a huge coconut ice cream fan and it's hard for me to not be pleased with any kind of coconut ice cream, but toasted coconut opened up an entire new world to coconut enthusiasts. ÊEven my girlfriend who HATES coconut has to succumb to the awesomeness. Ê ÊThe toasted coconut flakes really did make this an exceptional Bi-Rite staple ice cream along with the salted caramel which everyone knows how amazing that is already. On a recent outing, a buddy of mine wanted to bring some pints to a potluck so without knowing how much the pints cost, he said to the cashier "just give me 7 pints." ÊThe cashier girl said "what flavors?" ÊHe responded, "whatever's good." ÊWe got a nice 7 pack variety of Bi-Rite and it was a classic moment for everyone, especially my friend who realized how expensive the total came out to after all was said and done. ÊAt least he came to the potluck looking like a Bi-Rite baller.

Walking the neighboring streets while savoring my ice cream with my local pal Rosie, I had a momentary flash of brilliance in the form of a fierce desire to become an ice cream maker...because... "ice cream makes people happy" i cried to my friend "and I want to make people happy"... This is some of the most amazing ice cream that I have had outside of Italy. Can you say "honey lavender"? Or "roasted banana"? OR even "salted caramel"? ÊI tasted the flavors and since I didn't know when I'd be back to San Fran....I went for it and got all 3 scoops! This is seriously the most creamy ice cream that I have ever had and the flavors are both familiar and unusual. The salted caramel is not like any of the "pseudo caramel" flavors of the moment. It was rich and salty and luscious with that sort of smokey bite to it that carmelization brings. The roasted banana and salted carmel together was like the perfect bananas foster. The honey lavender was the most unusual. It starts out tasting a bit floral on the tongue but then changes into something sumptuous and undescribable. Best get yourself to Bi-Rite and try it yourself!

Hours after running a half marathon and burning 1400 calories, I decided to reward myself with ice cream at Bi-Rite Creamery. ÊMy cousin wasn't as enthusiastic but was game after she found out they had a vegan flavor called chocolate coconut. ÊSo we hopped on the bus from Union Square and headed down to the Mission district in search of this famous ice cream place. ÊYou see, Bi-Rite has the distinction of being the most reviewed business on Yelp. ÊIt was also featured on Food Network's The Best Thing I Ever Ate. ÊI'm sure there are countless articles and news clippings I can dredge up but the point is, they serve up some delicious ice cream and are always busy. Ê We walk by and there's a huge line. ÊWe decided to get a drink at the nearby bar and have dinner before rounding back to get dessert. ÊBy the time we head back, the line was just as long as it was when we had walked by earlier. ÊThere's a slew of flavors. ÊMost of the flavors are gourmet like balsamic strawberry, salted caramel, pumpkin, or honey lavender. ÊThere are the lactose free flavors like chocolate coconut and melon sorbet. ÊBut then there are the sundaes. ÊSam's sundae was particularly interesting to me because it was the sundae that was featured on the Food Network. ÊIt features chocolate ice cream, bergamot olive oil, Maldon sea salt & whipped cream. ÊBut I decided to taste a few flavors before making up my mind. ÊThe cool thing is they give you metal spoons for tasting and wash them for reuse. ÊWay to go! Ê I tried the balsamic strawberry, pumpkin and honey lavender flavors. ÊI was sold on honey lavender and ordered the Dainty Gentleman sundae: 2 scoops honey lavender ice cream, blood orange olive oil, Maldon sea salt, and hot fudge. ÊThe spoons and containers are eco-friendly! ÊLet me just tell you, this sundae will change your life! ÊIt was a flavor explosion and was so delicious I didn't mind eating the ENTIRE thing. ÊThe combination of chocolate & sea salt with the citrusy olive oil along with the honey lavender ice cream was AMAZING. ÊYou will just have to go try it or create your own. ÊBi-Rite is simply delicious ice cream and I'm so happy I was able to try it.

ÊKnowing the purity of sugar, milk, and special flavors are about to dance on my tongue and sing to my stomach and taste buds. Ê This place is a double bonus because I have always found parking quickly, the neighborhood is nice to stroll while devouring my special treat. ÊI love the market!

4209 reviews.....not much more to add!! Their ice cream is awesome. People are friendly and they let you sample the flavors with a smile! Ice cream is very flavorful. Loved the Roasted Banana, Malted Vanilla with Brown Sugar. Not a big fan of the most popular Salted Carmel... it was too rich for me. But all the other flavors I tried were awesome!! The place smelled so good from all the some they were baking. And the price was very reasonable... $3.25 for a single which is two flavor scoops. Just go!

It's a cold night in San Francisco (when is it not a cold night in SF?) and I had heard so much about Bi-Rite that I was determined to try it, regardless of the fact that I had the shivers already. Ê There was a line outside when we arrived and I was told that the line was particularly short for Bi-Rite. ÊI had a hard time choosing flavors. So many were unique: lavendar honey, cinnamon with cookies, creme fraiche, etc. ÊI felt a little rushed ordering because of the herd of people behind me, but I ended up trying the creme fraiche and cinnamon with snickerdoodles. It is definitely some solid ice cream. ÊThey had toppings and sundaes and I didn't realize that until after I had ordered, but next time I'll definitely try one!

Do not be turned away by the long line. Be like me and complain the whole time, but there is wonderful, ice creamy gold at the end of the rainbow. I've been wanting to try this place out for quite a while now, and finally got around to it a couple weeks ago with Xandra. I got the salted caramel and the Ricanelas. With the perfect balance of sweet and salty, you really can't go wrong with the salted caramel. And the Ricanelas... Think of snickerdoodles. While I wouldn't go out of my way to go here, I know that whenever I'm near Dolores Park, I will probably pay a visit.

Don't know if anything too new can be written about Bi-Rite with 4,000+ reviews on Yelp, but it is simply delicious. Whenever it is a nice day out in SF and I'm in the City or if I have visitors who have some sweet tooth, I make sure to come by. The line is indeed always pretty long on the weekends whenever I'm here, but if you are here with friends and people are walking by, you have plenty of people-watching to do and topics to discuss. My go-to combination is salted caramel and roasted banana. NOM!

I usually come here around the night time after dinner for a little desert, so I'm used to the norm of seeing a great deal of people waiting in line for Ice cream, which is the only terrible part about this place, but despite all that, it's a must see! I always come in for the Salted Caramel and Roasted Banana, and they are simply amazing together.

Been here twice. ÊHad a good experience twice. ÊI first came with some friends after dinner and the line was seriously around the corner! ÊTo top that, it was freezing cold!! ÊWhat were we thinking to have ice cream on a winter night?? ÊIt was worth it, though. I took my friend's advise and ordered the Honey Lavender. ÊI'd say it's more of a girly choice. ÊEvery time I think of lavender, I think of how my mom would light up her lavender scent candles for bed. ÊI had some samples, which was so nice of the staff to let me do that, and decided on that flavor. Ê I usually get some sort of coffee/mocha flavors, but I wanted to try a flavor I couldn't get elsewhere. ÊIt was good, but I wouldn't say it's the best. The second time I came was also after another dinner date, but this time, I was a bit more greedy - I got two flavors. ÊI decided to try the Salted Caramel along with the Lavender.

There are currently (as of this post) over 4400 reviews, so what more can I really say? This ice cream really is worth waiting in line for. ÊTheir gourmet and unexpected creations and combinations really make the calories worth it. ÊHoney lavender? ÊBrown butter pecan?

You know how most ice cream places will tout a certain flavor (i.e., "key lime pie," "vanilla custard," "mixed berry") and then give you something that only tastes vaguely like the real thing, all synthetic and pumped full of Red #40 coloring? Bi-Rite is one of the very few creameries I've been to where the flavors taste exactly like what you get, and that's what makes their ice cream extraordinary. I had the salted caramel, which tastes like the caramelized crust of a creme brulee, and the brown sugar with ginger swirl, which had warm, round flavors. They charge $3.50 for a single which contains "2 little scoops" - but don't be deceived by the word "little," these are little scoops with magnificent flavor! I also love the old school wooden spoons they give you - how else can you better enjoy natural flavors with a natural, compostable spoon? :) Friendly service and phenomenal ice cream. Writing this review makes my stomach ache for more!!

I came here and ordered the salted caramel, coffee toffee, toasted coconut, and ricanelas (cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodles). The ricanelas was to die for but everything else was just okay to me. I'm a huge coconut fan and I've had much better. The salted caramel, in my opinion, was a little overrated. The coffee toffee was pretty good too. I think I'll stay true to Mitchell's for my ice cream cravings, but I'll definitely come back for the ricanelas.

This probably my favorite ice cream place in San Francisco. It would be pretty hard top this place. Birite has unique flavors that you just don't find anywhere else. Salted carmel, balsamic strawberry, brown sugar with a ginger sugar swirl, roasted banana. They change their flavors from time to time which makes me want to come back even more. Their sundaes are really delicious as well, but it is huge and rich. So, I suggest sharing it with other people. Parking around here can be tricky, but if you go to the side streets in the area, you should be able to find parking. Lastly, don't be discouraged when you see the line. There will always be a line there no matter what time or what day it is. Honestly, the ice cream is totally worth the wait!

I love Bi-rite Creamery. That is definitely an understatement. Sometimes you read their flavors and you go "WTF?" but when you give it a try, it's actually quite delicious! Last time I tried a pomegranate sorbet and the famous salted caramel. I loved both of them. The sorbet was refreshing and tarty, while the salted caramel was creamy and rich. I brought my friend there today because she's never been... she is now a fan! :) Today, I tried the orange sorbet and the cookies and cream. The orange sorbet was definitely not like any other orange sorbet I have tried. The orange sorbet had a combination of the bitterness you would get from the skin of an orange while retaining the sweet and tangy flavor you would get from biting into a juicy orange. It was weird. I wish I could say that I loved it, but it was a little too bitter for my liking. On the other hand, the cookies and cream ice cream was delicious. I am a sucker for cookies and cream and this is definitely one of the yummiest ones I've tried. It was full of crunchy cookies and rich in the milk/cream flavor. Definitely a must have again! My friend tried the orange something and the earl gray ice cream. Mmmm, who would've thought of using earl gray tea in their ice cream? It is absolutely delicious. The flavor was light, yet it was just the right amount. I would definitely get a serving of earl gray for myself next time. The staff is amazingly friendly. They are more than welcome to spoon you a sample of your choice(s)! If you go during the day (especially if it's a sunny day and/or the weekend) expect to wait in a line. The line may look intimidating, but it moves rather quickly.

First you must know, ice cream is one of my favorite treats on this planet. ÊI think I might add another piece of "should I date this man" criteria to the list: ÊDo you love ice cream? ÊIf not, we have a problem. ÊBi-Rite is a San Franciscan company located in the heart of the mission district. ÊIt doesn't matter if you just ate the biggest dinner of your life and are stuffed to the gills already, or if you hadn't yet eaten dinner and are afraid to spoil your appetite! ÊWho cares? ÊBi-Rite needs to be had, and now. ÊThe ice cream flavors are unique with flavors like ginger (a much coveted flavor by locals come to find out, as it usually sells out mid to late day), salted caramel, and lavender. ÊThey also carry homemade cookies - I picked up some toffee chocolate chip to bring back to Chicago with me. Ê I skipped all the way back to my pals apartment with my Bi-Rite ice cream in tote, then savored it to the max on my blow up mattress the last night of vacation. Happy birthday to me.

I came here two days in a row. What more do I have to say?!?!?!?! Just joking. My friend Abe told me to check out Bi-Rite about a month ago when I bragged about tasting one of the best ice cream in the whole wide world at a place in LA. Being the huge yelper that I am, I looked up Bi-Rite and decided it was worthy of begging my bestie to take me there. We went there on a Saturday afternoon and there was a small line as we drove past it. Don't let this sight get the best of you. It moves at a decent pace so take a breather and enjoy the crisp San Francisco air as you wait in line. On the first day, I ordered a scoop of the salted caramel and brown butter pecan. I didn't enjoyed the salted caramel too much. The flavors weren't really there for me. It reminded me of toffee instead. The brown butter pecan was AMAZING. I wished the bottom scoop was the brown butter pecan so I could have the best flavor last. Whomp whomp whomp. Total sad face. The next day I made my bestie take me to Defina for dinner because I knew Bi-Rite was across the street. After having a delicious dinner, I dragged his sorry butt to get some sweets with me. I ordered the honey lavender and malt vanilla. Both flavors were soooooooo delicious!!! I had to eat them simultaneously to keep my taste buds happy. Bi-Rite, you make me so happy, yet I am so glad I live in SoCal and Hawaii because I can't get you all the time and thus, won't be a walking fatso. (Yes, this is how I think so I don't have to feel bad about not getting to eat some of the best things the BEST COAST (aka the West Coast) has to offer me.)

Made my own sundae and it was underwhelming, almost bad. The pumpkin ice cream didn't taste like pumpkin. The caramel sauce didn't taste like caramel. The ginger cookies were very gingery though. The egg nog and brandy Êice cream was pretty good. People who sit inside Bi-Rite need to LEAVE shortly after they've finished eating. Our table folks were nice to do so! We did the same.

Bi-Rite is known for their salted caramel, but I found it a little too overwhelming after a couple bites. I tend to enjoy the more subtle flavors in earl gray, strawberry balsamic, and honey lavender. My friends have also enjoyed the roasted banana so I'll have to get that next time. Compared to the other ice creameries, Bi-Rite is creamier but it also melted faster. Tip: Parking can be hard to find and depending on the time, there will be long lines. Wear a jacket in SF!

After a delicious dinner at Pizzeria Delfina, my friend and I had some time to kill before heading downtown for a concert, so we wandered the Mission and not-so-coincidentally wandered over to Bi-Rite Creamery for dessert. We managed to get here right before the after-dinner rush--there were only a couple of people in line ahead of us. As the night wore on, the hungry hipsters started lining up for their ice cream fix. As so often happens to me in the gourmet ice cream shops that are popping up all over the city, I was overwhelmed with the number of choices. Tasting a couple, each and every one would have made a delicious scoop. Which one do you choose when you want them all? Our server was so patient as we made our way sampling about a half dozen flavors--yes, we were one of those customers--before making our final selections. I finally settled on a double scoop with brown sugar and salted caramel. (How can you not order the salted caramel? It's practically a national treasure!) The ice cream was so smooth and creamy. The salted caramel had that rich taste of buttery caramel, with a hint of salt to excite the palate. The brown sugar was sweet, but not overwhelmingly so, with a hint of dark molasses. Yes, it was a definite sugar rush, but just what I needed as an early evening pick-me-up.

I finally got to experience Bi-Rite ice cream for the first time last week. I went with a few friends on a Monday afternoon and of course there was a line. I ordered salted caramel (of course) and coffee and they were both delicious. The creaminess and sweetness of their ice cream is perfect. My boyfriend got three flavors: coconut, banana & salted caramel and he liked all of them. I took away one star because after reading the yelp reviews, I REALLY wanted to try the balsamic strawberry but it wasn't on the menu.

I happened to be at my cousin's place and was taking the dog for walk when I stumbled upon Bi-Rite. I was way too excited! I've been meaning to try this place for a long time, but parking has always deterred me from coming into this area. The shop was pretty empty when I went and there was no line so I got pretty lucky. I was told that the line wraps around the block sometimes. Love the samples- they give you a lot on the spoon! The flavors are really unique- not just your average vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry. Brown sugar, candy cane, coconut, ginger.. most flavors reflected Christmas! Love it. Tried the salted caramel, honey lavender, and malted vanilla. I wish I got to sample more. Stuck with a a scoop of salted caramel and honey lavender (which surprisingly, does NOT taste like soap). Salted caramel is REAL good and I wish I got double scoops of it. Didn't disappoint! I'll be back to try everything else :)

Bi-Rite has always been on my radar but recently a friend insisted that try it on a recent trip to the Bay Area so I did. Boy oh boy am I glad! I don't think there's anything I can add to the existing 4201 reviews (I'm 4202, yay!) on here except AMEN to all the other 5 star reviews. PEOPLE, IT'S TRUE! READ NO FURTHER.

Very conveniently located, being next to Dolores Park. The ice cream is pretty rich and the flavor is complex. The price isn't too high, and the sugar content isn't too. This is a nice place to have dessert after a big meal in the Mission.

I was born with somewhat of an aversion to sweet flavors; consequently, I always cringe whenever I eat cake, ice cream, pies, etc. The Earl Grey flavor here, however, was just the right amount of sweet and decadence for my sweet-sensitive tongue to handle; the salted caramel did sound and taste intriguing at first, but made my eyes turn super Asian instead. Will come back to steal all available tubs of Earl Grey in the near future.

i went to this place when it first opened and it was not as popular as it is now, and i have continued to go because my friends like this place. (i'm not the biggest ice cream fan.) the balsamic strawberry tasted different than a year ago. the flavors were bolder and the balsamic really enhanced the natural flavor of the strawberry. today, the strawberry took a back seat to the balsamic and overall, it lacked strawberry flavor. the salted caramel on the other had tasted better than 3 years ago. it was kind of salty and sweet without a strong caramel flavor so i had no idea why my friends liked it. today, i tasted brulee much to my surprise. the texture was denser and had a similar consistency to peanut butter but less sticky. Ê their seasonal pumpkin had a nice blend of spices and a bold pumpkin flavor. it was better than mitchell's.

By now I'm sure everyone has read about Bi-Rite's famous salted caramel ice cream. Well believe everything you've heard because it is phenomenal. It's unlike any other caramel flavored ice cream I've ever tasted and it's worth the hype as well as the wait in line. I also enjoyed the vanilla malt with peanut brittle. Along with Mitchell's, Bi-Rite Creamery is one of the best ice cream shops in San Francisco.

so my pregnant wife, who's on an ice cream craving binge, were about to head to mitchell's when i get a call from a buddy while shopping. thanks to my friend Antonio (http://Motormavens.com) Êfor giving me and the wife a heads up about this place. we were warned the line was going to be nuts, which it was bc of the park, waves of hipsters, and it being a sunday afternoon. after driving in circles for a million years we found a close spot and parked. me = malted vanilla (kinda plain) and roasted banana (pretty good but the magnolia turon ice cream from seafood city is comparable IMHO) pregnant lady = salted caramel (really damn good) brown sugar (too rich) overall awesome spot other than the shitful parking.

I really like that Bi-Rite Creamery makes their own ice cream by hand. They have really interesting flavors that tastes very rich. ÊIt's located right next to Delores park, so you can walk over and enjoy your ice cream in a nice area. My roommate and I tried a few of their flavors: Salted Caramel, Dark Chocolate, Malted Vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate pieces, and Coffee Toffee. Our favorites were the Dark Chocolate and Malted Vanilla. The coffee toffee was interesting, it tasted like I was drinking a cup of iced coffee! Salted Caramel was good but definitely a bit too sweet for my tastes, though others really LOVED it. ÊA random couple sitting next to use insisted that I try their Salted Caramel with extra caramel sauce on it... can we say sugar rush? Definitely will come back to try their other flavors.

After having an Ike's sandwich with my friend, we decided to get some dessert. So we walked to Bi-Rite. This was my first time going here so I didn't know what to expect. My friend wanted to share so we got 3 favors, Malted Vanilla, Salted Caramel, and Roasted Banana. Wow...They were amazing. The Salted Caramel was something I've never tasted in an ice cream. It was salty but since I'm filipino, I loved it! But I preferred the Roasted Banana. It was so good. I will most def come back again.

BiRite- I love you like a fat kid loves cake. and ice cream, and sundaes and cheetos and more cake! Seriously, salt should be on everything sweet because that combination is genius. Bi-Rite creamery is very well known in the City as one of the best ice cream shops and it's a legit claim. They offer a variety of unique ice cream flavors that are made with really good ingredients. Where else can you find salted caramel and ricanelas? They also make them in ice cream sandwiches or in sundaes, as well as cakes!! Just next door they have the a tiny window where you can pick up soft serve, cookies and baked good if you don't want to brave the line, usually around the corner but so worth it. You can also just skip ahead of the line and buy a pint of their ice creams to enjoy at home. ÊMidnight munchies worthy!

I finally went to this place and luckily there wasn't a line..but then again, it is winter time...so I am sure the lines aren't long these days. It doesn't mean that it wasn't crowded inside though. I wanted to try a couple of flavors--one that that was familiar and something different. With the familiar, I tried the Roasted Banana. It was good and a little more rich in flavor than a normal banana flavor. As for the different, I tried the Honey Lavender. I can't say that it was good but it wasn't bad either. It was definitely different. Just as I hoped for. I suppose to really give it another star, I would love to try more flavors. The quality of the ice cream is good but to me it's all the same...Mitchell's, Swenson's, etc. (Of course, that's just my opinion) Great location and friendly staff. Will be back to try more! Love.

One of my favorite places to get ice cream and I always have to come here every time I go to SF. This place has all sorts of weird flavors but its "signature" is the salted caramel. Correct me if I'm wrong but I think this was one of the first places that started this flavor and now you can basically get this flavor anywhere. I love how this place is also very environmentally friendly and this place serves your ice cream in com-posable utensil and cups. F.Y.I. This place can get very crowded at night pass 8pm and on weekends.

There's 4000 other reviews for Bi-Rite and I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that they're all saying the same thing: Bi-Rite is one of the best ice-cream places out there, if not the best in the City. Pure bliss. Utter delight. Buttery softness. Am I waxing enough poetry for you?? Grab a cone and walk over to the always vibrant Dolores Park and you have the ingredients to the making of that perfect stroll through the park. 5 stars - one star for each of the drool puddles that has formed since the writing of this review.

My cousin was raving about this place, so we went and stood in a hefty line for ice creaaaamy on a super sunny Saturday afternoon. Totally worth the fifteen minute wait. Me, being the shameless, cheapo piggie I am, got five free samples before settling on salted caramel and mint chip. Match made in heaven.

Came here at night on a weekend and the line went down the block and around the corner! It goes by pretty quickly, though. I don't think we waited for more than 15 minutes. And it's totally worth it. I'm not usually a fan of ice cream, but I tried their salted caramel ice cream here and I loved it. I like that it's more creamy than icy. And they have a bunch of other unique and interesting flavors. The staff is super upbeat and nice, too. Definitely an SF treasure.

So the first few times I came here I was pretty impressed and everything I had hit the spot, but today when I came in I was looking for something refreshing to help cool me down for the weather. I had their salted caramel and toasted coconut. Both for some reason tasted super sweet to me. I wanted something fruity, but unfortunately they didn't have anything on the menu :( I came just in time though there was no line, but as we were eating the line slowly accumulated down the street. There is also a park across the street that you can go enjoy your sweet treat at. Parking is also a pain in the butt here.

so lets talk dairy alright? alright. not very good for you, creates mucus but when you add sugar it perks it up a bit. a tad every once in a while ain't gonna kill you. so it seems it was one of the 1st hot days in SF & the line to get in was very long & it takes an eternity to get your treat. I really felt like an idiot waiting in line but I was at the point of no return & my gal pal wanted the stuff. no problem I said & we agreed it is nice enough to have on a hot day. so who walks by while in line no other than that tall star of "Glee". I don't know her name but I recognize the face. my, oh my does she love attention but everyone was cool & didn't fawn all over her but you could feel the buzz going through the line when she strolled by. that woman is very tall by the way & I'd say a minimum of 6" tall. as I gaze at the peeps all around me, I see hipster swill, happy loving couples, ditto boy-boy/ girl-girl combos & I'm thinking to myself, you are all in for some "REA" also know as *rapidly expanding ass* after you get your dairy licks in. then I try to roll with it some more & come up with this: "REAC" or ^Rapidly Expanding Ass Creme^ get it? that's @ASS CREME@ ... so a good 20 minutes finally pass & we get the dish of ice cream. we had rhubarb,ginger,malted vanilla & toasted coconut. so for 6 bucks we got 4 scoops which was just enough & not overly generous or anything but it seems like high quality stuff & the mucus buildup gave me many merry hocker ejections as I cleared my throat of the gooey dairy mucus as we walked back to the transportation unit . thanks be Satan we do not burn in HELL everyday in SF because I would NOT want to make this part of my everyday reality.

On a Saturday night at Ê9:30pm, this line was longer than the club! After a delicious dinner at ÊChouChou, we skipped out on dessert to visit Bi-Rite. This was bookmarked on my list forever so I was excited. So there are two lines when you get there. One is for the soft ice cream which is simialr to yogurt, no thanks. That line is too short to be true so scoot over! ÊThe other line is the line you want to get in. Its intimidating but it moves fast. There is also a menu that circulates down the line which is awesome. I decided to get the berry sundae with a scoop of Êsalted caramel ice cream! I love anything ginger flavored and I heard salty caramel was a must get here and what Bi -Rite is known for. Instead of two scoops of ginger I had one scoop of salted caramel and it was the perfect combination. The flavor of the ginger is a bit mild and the salty caramel balances well with my choices because it was pure delicious. It can get a bit salty after too many bites but its still so good. Oh yea, and its called the berry sundae because there are blackberries smothered on top. Yum! Overall, I love this place and cant wait to try the other flavors!

After strolling around Noe Valley & the Mission I had to stop by Bi-Rite on our way past Dolores. Honestly, I feel like I'm in a slightly grungier Zooey Deschanel movie when I'm in the neighborhood and I can't get enough! Also couldn't get enough of the Earl Grey Tea and Roasted Banana. Every flavor here is very robust, especially the Coffee Toffee and Salted Caramel which makes those two good for sharing even if I wouldn't order it again just for myself.

Worth the wait! Loooooooong lines. This past chilly weekend the line wasn't as bad as I imagine it usually is..maybe about 20 people in line. And it was cold out!! It was so worth the wait, which was surprisingly only about 15 minutes. Those cute little hipsters move fast! They are nice too and let you try as many flavors as you like. I had a scoop of the brown sugar which was ahhhhmazing! Drool. We also ordered pre-packed pints of malted vanilla with peanut brittle, brown butter pecan & ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles) - TO DIE FOR!! omg..one of the best ice creams I've EVER had!! Super creamy w/big delicious chunks of snickerdoodle cookie batter. The one disappointing pint was the meyer lemon. The flavor was actually pretty good, but it had a very strange texture..almost like it was dried out and not creamy at all. So maybe we got a bad pint or something. Avoid the insane lines by going when it's cold out and taking a pint to enjoy at home. Another tip is that you don't have to wait in line at all if you are JUST getting pre-packed pints, but hey you drove all the way there, you might as well try some flavors!

Don't be discouraged if the line wraps around the building, for a small place the line actually moves at a decent speed.

I've also tried the Sam's Sundae and that's freakin' fantastic also!

With so many reviews, it seems unnecessary for me to add to it. ÊBUT i have to show my love for my favorite ice cream store!! They are known for their salted caramel ice cream, but I like their roasted banana, earl grey, and MEYER LEMON. ÊMeyer Lemon is only around once a year for about 3 weeks (I believe around March or April). ÊI have not found an ice cream that I've liked better, if you ever go and this flavor is available. ÊBuy a pint or you will regret it because the next time you're back it probably will not be available anymore. Ê I've also gotten their Banana split sundae, which they caramelize with a small blow torch, love it! I've also tried their frozen yogurt which they opened next door. ÊTheir yogurt is very Êflavorful and not at all diluted by a "yogurty" taste that I find in so many frozen yogurt. This is my go-to recommendation for anyone living/visiting SF. ÊSo please brave the line (taught me patience so that no line for food has phased me since) and the SF cold to get this ice cream. ÊParking again around this area is very difficult, but be patient and something always opens up.

i've been to birite a couple of times before, and each time just makes the experience better. which means that yes, birite is THAT legit. what makes it even more legit is that they somehow manage to split a block-long line into three different smaller lines that allow pedestrian traffic while simultaneously keeping the line in check. personally, i'm a fan of caramel flavors... just not salted caramel. what captured my heart is the RICANELAS flavor, which is cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodles. other faves include the brown sugar, the toffee coffee, the roasted banana, and the toasted vanilla. try them all - you can ask them for samples when you (finally) make it up to the counter. the eating area is pretty small, only a few small tables inside and some makeshift benches built around the little trees on the sidewalk. not a dealbreaker though - dolores park is right across the street! pints are a bit pricy - 8 dollars for a single pint. but hey gotta do what you gotta do when you're screaming for some ice cream! and they offer stamp cards too - buy ten get one free! i'd recommend bussing over driving, since the J stops only one block away. either that or find a friend who lives nearby so you can use their driveway! but you may be lucky with parking too, so up to you and how lucky you (and your parallel parking skills) feel that day :)

Their other flavors of ice cream are pretty good, but they all seem medicore compared to the salted caramel. I always regret it when I get some other flavor along with salted caramel. I wish I just got salted caramel...that's how good it is. The only thing is that the texture changes every time I go! One day it's a perfect consistency to my taste (not too soft, not too firm) and another day it's practically melting. Either way, the deliciousness keeps me coming back for more.

Bi-Rite is conveniently located at a street corner near Dolores Park. Hot days mean the line could extend past the building corner, but don't be discourage because the ice cream is that good. I'm just going to highlight some flavors that stood out. Salted Caramel - A fan favorite and is a growing taste trend across the city. Honey Lavender - Smells like lavender, which in turn reminds me of soap. However, it doesn't taste like soap, so I definitely enjoyed it. Sam's Sundae - I believe my sundae was beyond salty, so I couldn't enjoy this as I wish I could. The interior is small, but I never hang around inside. I rather eat my ice cream outside, by the park or on the go. I definitely recommend this place to others, but a word to the wise is to try new flavors before you commit to buying a scoop. There are plenty of flavors to get lost in, and it just means you will have to come back and try different flavors.

After ages hearing about Bi-Rite Creamery, I couldn't stand it anymore, I need to try Bi-Rite! I need to find out what's the hype all about. ÊThe line was there but it moved fairly quickly especially when you can't really figure out what flavors you wanted. No one seems to like to get the soft serve ice creams from BiRite, so that's just an instant warning right there. Bi-Rite has some interesting arrange of flavors Olive Oil, Balsamic Strawberry and Peach Ginger. With the clerk giving us a few metal spoons to sample the ice cream. I went with a brown sugar and salted caramel single serving ice cream. Maybe I had a weird sweet tooth, but I definitely like the Peach Ginger flavor. The Peach Ginger has a little bite to it that seems so fitting for the ice cream. Though, I'm not a big ice cream fan, I definitely can see the appeal for Bi-Rite. I will definitely need to try all those other raved about ice creams in the city also to get a better idea on why SF is coming such an Ice Cream friendly city. ----- + Pro: Overhyped? Maybe, but soo damn good! - Con (1/2): Lines can get long. - Con (2/2): My friends said, "Good luck finding parking!" I was definitely lucky :P (-b ^_^)-b Overall: Delicious ice cream that might even pleases some non-ice cream fans.

It's cold and creamy like ice cream usually is, but the folks at Bi-Rite Creamery must be sacrificing small animals by the dozen in order to tease out the magical melange of flavors offered here. I went with the Dainty Gentleman sundae. Two scoops of Lavender ice cream drizzled with Blood Orange Olive Oil, Hot Fudge, and finished with a pinch of Sea Salt. This combination lead to an incredibly complex and intriguing experience that left me speechless. After waiting 45 minutes in line, I was EXTREMELY skeptical as to the caliber of ice cream and would have knocked off a couple of stars had I received anything short of exemplary. For once, my skepticism proved to be ill-found.

still my go to ice cream place in sf..and i've tried plenty of them. not a huge fan of the popular salted caramel (too sweet) or honey lavender (like soap)...but i do like the following flavors: -roasted banana -toasted coconut -balsamic vinegar -earl grey -almond fudge swirl (best to get when it's a new batch with the chocolate and almonds on top) also, the sugar cone complements the ice cream well without overpowering it, which i can't say is the same for other places. aside from the ice cream, the proximity of bi-rite to dolores park makes it a easy place to take visitors, and the convenient bathroom is a plus. lastly, the workers are great and are happy to let you sample flavors. note: expect to wait in lines on the weekends...out of towners!

This is the most reviewed business on Yelp! And for good reason-- The ice cream creations are delicious, and the flavor selections (both ice cream & toppings) are marvelous. I obviously couldn't pick just one, so we "Made Our Own Sundae" ($6.50) with: --1 scoop of Coffee Toffee (Wow.) --1 scoop of Ricaneles (cinnamon ice cream with chunks of snickerdoodle cookies. Wow.) --Brownie Pieces, Whipped Cream & Caramel (Wow.) Wowowow. Locals tell me there is a never a time there isn't a line out the door and around the corner, but if you have some time to spare, IT'S WORTH IT. ...And if you have some calories to spare, I suggest first going to their Soft-Serve Window (the line for soft-serve is much shorter), and picking up a Salted Caramel Cone to enjoy while you wait on line for the Creamery! ...Not that I did that or anything...

MMMMMMMM!!!!!! You know, for having SO much business (line down the block) and a pretty big menu, this place moves and operates really really well. Ê Salted Caramel ice cream. ÊWow. ÊJust, wow. Ê Get the sundaes. ÊI mean, you're there to have a treat, so have one. ÊThe first time we went, (we were on vacation and only in town for 2 days) I made my own sundae with a scoop of salted caramel, a scoop of creme fraiche, almond toffee, hot fudge, and brownie pieces. ÊDAMN. ÊPat had the sam sundae, of course, since he's italian and loves olive oil. ÊIt was great! ÊI think even less olive oil would be ok since there was a good amount left over at the end. ÊVery generous in general, they are. Ê The next time we were there, a few days later, I had the berry sundae with salted caramel instead of ginger because they were out, and you know, I think I can stop trying things. ÊIf I ever go back, that's what I'm getting. Ê Most importantly, their customer service was excellent. ÊThey were patient even looking out at a line that just won't stop. ÊThey let us sample whatever we wanted with grace and a good attitude. ÊThey seem happy to be there, and all in all it was a great experience. ÊWhy bother with crappy Humphrey Slocombe when you can have Bi-Rite? ÊTheir flavors are way more creative and are made better, and the ambiance is better. ÊWay to go!

This place still serves the best ice cream in San Francisco. I had to come here during my one visit to the city during my trip. They had their fall menu out and I got a 2 scoops of brown butter pecan and maple walnut in a single cup. All very delicious and creamy. My friend also got the brown butter pecan and candy cane. She really liked the butter pecan as well. I was tempted to get their famous salted caramel, but I had it so many times that I wanted to try something new. Until next time...

Compared to losing my virginity, my first time at Bi-Rite Creamery was so much better. It was my first, and it certainly will not be my last. I got Mint Chip and Malted Vanilla with Milk Chocolate and Peanut Brittle. I died. A little death. La petite mort. http://en.wikipedia.org/É Beware a place like this can hold a line.

This is my second time trying Bi-rite and I just don't get the hype. I purchased two pints and they were full of air. I used to make ice cream at a Êboutique ice cream shop in New England when I was a teen; I can tell when base has tumbled in the Emery Thompson too long. When I pay $8 per pint I want a dense product not frozen whipped cream. i feel ripped off AND I waited in line to get ripped off; hence the one star. The pints at Mr. & Mrs. Miscellaneous are much heavier. ÊIn terms of flavor, the mint chocolate chip lacked a strong mint flavor. I grew up with premium ice cream (Steve's, Ashley's, local farms etc..) so the fact that the mint ice cream is not green does not impress me. The toasted coconut was also lacking flavor. Even Mitchell's macapuno is much much better. I have a problem with them calling themselves a creamery since the base is from Strauss' like every organic ice cream place in the City. If you you aren't a dairy you aren't a creamery. Many people have already said its not worth the wait I think it is not worth the calories.

A few tips for visitors... - watch where you park (parking patrol take their job seriously) - try to avoid dropping by on the rare warm and sunny days - consider buying a pint of ice cream if there is a line. you can walk right in to purchase from the fridge! - Bi-Rite's soft serve ice cream is incredible and sold in a separate/shorter line.

So there has to be something to the 4000+ reviews for this place, right? Came here on 11/11/11 just before 11 and the line was out the door. Good sign, right? Had a menu passed down to us as we waited to enter. Arriving at the counter we were welcomed to try different flavors. I ended up getting the afternoon sundae (roasted banana ice cream with graham crackers and whipped cream), while my friends got salted caramel, coffee toffee, and white chocolate with raspberry swirl. The roasted banana ice cream was off the charts delicious. It wasn't one of those syrup-flavored, heavily sweetened deals - the flavor was fragrant and activated all my senses. The graham cracker crumbles were very light, as was the whipped cream. A+ effort. The salted caramel was awesome, Êtoo. My favorite candy of all time is caramel, and the sweetness of it is opposed by a salty finish, leaving you with a sense that you're eating caramel popcorn without the stupid kernels getting stuck in your teeth. Coffee toffee was another thumbs up. A rich and floral coffee aroma accented by toffee chunks. The white chocolate with raspberry swirl was exactly as advertised. Nothing outrageous, but still good. Great ice cream. Horrible parking, but it's San Francisco, so what can ya do? *wanna read a side story?* As I drove around the block to find near impossible parking, I came across an Acura MDX-driving douchebag who had obviously circled the block one too many times. He decided that he was going to force his way into a space which fit a Civic. After pushing the car behind him back half a foot and the car in front a half foot, he was good to go. EPIC TRIP TO SF TONIGHT!

We showed up here on the Friday night after Thanksgiving, and the line was well out the door and down the (cold, cold, cold!) street. This was my first clue that this was the place to go for some great ice cream. I had the S'mores sundae. Chocolate ice cream, graham cracker bits, caramel, and a fluffy cloud of meringue that was toasted with a blowtorch right before my very eyes. It was incredibly good, and my three ice-cream-enjoying comrades all commented, after tasting my s'mores sundae, that they wished they had gotten one instead of what they ordered (although all of theirs were delicious, too). The price of the sundae was $7 flat, and I got so much that, even after sharing, I had leftovers in our hotel room freezer the next day. Yep, I ate them.

I'm not even putting in 2 cents since 1/4000 reviews is about .02 cents, but here goes anyway... Great people, good ice cream. The only issue is that its just not very creamy - a bit icy, but their flavors are great: -Salted caramel - tasty but insanely sweet -Mint chip - average -Honey Lavender - subtle, not overpowering, and delicious - one of the best "weird" flavors I've had -Almond swirl - really almondy, very good -Chocolate coconut - you can really taste the toasted coconutiness, yum -Brown butter pecan - an average butter pecan -Malted vanilla w/ peanut brittle & choco - tastes like a candy bar Save yourself the wait in what looks like a line to a club, and go to the Bi-Rite store across the street that sells quarts of ~10 of their most popular flavors. You can eat the whole quart, you know you can...

I've come here once and another time avoided the line to instead purchase prepackaged ice cream from the market across the street. The ice cream is truly sublime (I think the salted caramel is a little overbrowned! but when I came back it was mellower.) The honey lavender is delicate and delicious, and the brown butter pecan rich and indulgent. I can make better ice cream at home, but it sure takes a lot of work. Bring a pint home; you'll wish you had if you don't.

I remember it being a gloomy day. ÊWandering around SF has its perks. One of them is walking up the wrong street and finding the right place. What can you say about how awesome Bi-Rite is that hasn't been said? Can I give it a 1-star just to get some attention? Maybe. But as a business owner myself, I know that's just plain wrong. Bi-Rite in SF is good, great, and amazing all at once. The store is small, the lines can be long, but you know you made the right decision. Portion sizes aren't big, but the ice cream is rich and filling. If you're a foodie, Bi-Rite is one of those meccas for ice cream. Enjoyyyyy! :)

We all know about the awesomesauceness of Bi-Rite, I mean, just look at the reviews. The ratings. The lines. Its all real. But do you know about the national treasure that is their ice cream cake? I would have never found it if my hubby hadn't randomly requested such a calorie bomb for this ?0th birthday last week, a mere three days before the said event. The next morning, I took to Google and Twitter, thinking Humphry-Slocombe and Bi-Rite would be my first choices before I went the *gasp* Baskin-Robbins route. And praise the Lord Bi-Rite answered me almost immediately. I called after a morning meeting and was able to select from one of the three cakes they had in stock for pickup later that evening--malted vanilla with milk chocolate and peanut brittle. WHAT? Its three days since we cut the cake. Its still in my freezer. I've had to add an extra mile onto my runs to work it off because there is no possible way for me not to eat some of it. I think I had some for breakfast this morning. ÊIf you have an occasion calling for ice cream cake (or just decide to make one up) you won't be disappointed. See you on the trails...

If you are NOT an ice cream lover like I am, then Bi-Rite will definitely change you. ÊI'm not sure what it is about this place, but for some reason, I always crave their ice cream now. My friends introduced this place to me when I was up in SF a few years ago. ÊThey told me that I HAD to try it. ÊAfter refusing, they forced a bite onto me and I was hooked since. I recommend the salted carmel, the roasted banana, the peanut butter chocolate swirl, and the cookies and cream. Ê The best part is, if you don't want to wait in their long line...go to their fridge and grab a few pints to take home. ÊIt's just as good without the long wait.

Came here on a lovely Friday evening with a friend who is a die hard fan of this place, so of course I was expecting amazing things. It was a chilly, foggy San Francisco summer evening, and yes, there was still a line! Must mean it's that good, right? I ordered a small, which is apparently two scoops and most people seem to mix it up with two flavors, but I chose to branch out and go for the Basil ice cream. Since I wasn't sure what other flavor might go with my selection, I chose to stick with having both of my scoops be the same. The texture is definitely something to write home about. It's so creamy and smooth, and probably the most memorable part about the ice cream. The basil was an interesting choice for an ice cream flavor. I had eaten tomato and basil pasta right before, so this reminded me a lot of the spaghetti sauce and was a nice compliment. Located right across from Delores Park, it made for a nice walk after ordering. Definitely a place I'll visit again.

Salted caramel - need I say more? Even though I love the fact that you can get more than one flavor in a cup, I always end up wishing it was ALL salted caramel. Although having a smidge of another flavor on the side does help me appreciate how delicious the salted caramel is over and over and over. My only complaint is - I've purchased a pint a couple of times now - once from the ice cream shop and once from the market. Both times, the consistency was strange. The whole middle of the pint was melty. I still drank it up, but it was a sort of a bummer considering how much of a luxury it is.

Soft Serve. Even a runny nose and a persistent cold couldn't keep me away. Something about going into an ice-cream shop that makes me revert back to a 5 year old adamant on having one (or many) no matter what my state may be. And given my persistence, combined with no lines and a brisk wednesday night, with a kind face in the soft serve window, I decided to give the 'twist' a try. The twist is the famous salted caramel and vanilla, twisted. Seeing how I like to optimize the varying choices available, this seemed like the best bet. And for the price they offer it for, it's a pretty decent sized portion! Now I have to be honest - I am not a big fan of their salted caramel. I tried it first at the street food festival and didn't like it and gave it another chance here and didn't particular find a great liking to it either. But it's creamy, soft (it serves the whole soft serve thing well) and rich. As was the vanilla. Not a usual fan of the vanilla, I found it great! I also walked into the actual creamery to see the varying choices and man are there many. The soft serve counter changes their specials everyday so check on their website for what's available, but the creamery offers plenty of choices along with pints of goodness! The sundaes especially looked quite amazing. Overall, I'm sooo happy I don't live that close to this place. Combined with my inertia to do any physical activity with my love for ice cream, my mother would say, can never be a good combination. Great place! Love it :)

Taking my brother to Bi-Rite was the equivalent of my 3rd grader class nerd self taking my parents to Open House at school -- there is nothing better on earth than showing my shit off! I've been to Bi-Rite a number of times -- I credit my beautiful fellow foodie partner in crime Angie B. for this fateful introduction -- and I have been blown away each and every time. The first time I tried (and subsequently purchased a pint to-go of) salted caramel, my life was altered forever. ÊNot only is it neatly salty, but the ice cream flavor tastes JUST LIKE you bit off a fresh piece of old-fashioned caramel. ÊSo real, so good. Bro opted for chocolate coconut and roasted banana (which also made my eyes roll into the back of my head -- it tasted EXACTLY like a fresh banana thrown into a roaster would taste like), and I of course fell for the coffee toffee and had to have my other standby, balsamic strawberry. ÊI think I prefer the balsamic strawberry up at Molly Moon's in Seattle, to be honest, but Bi-Rite does it quite well also. The workers were nice but efficient, so standing in the shortest of lines was like nothing. ÊGenerous scoops, enthusiastic line-goers, and plenty of cute dog-watching was a hearty bonus. ÊThanks for always bringing the happy my way, Bi-Rite -- see you again soon! REVIEW NUMBER 400 GOES TO MY FAAAVORITE INSTITUTION IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA!!! ÊI HEART YOU BI-RITE :)

It took me about 30 minutes to find parking. I parked about 6 blocks up. When I finally made it to the ice cream shop the line was around the corner. I was exited It has to be delicious for the wait to be this long right?! It took about 30 minutes to get to the counter. Thank God my son was in a good mood=) The service was great! After tasting a few samples I went with The Malted Vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate brownie sundae. It was very good but to be honest I wasn't impressed. We walked right across the street to Dolores Park and enjoyed our sundae on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. It was a couple hour ordeal for some ice cream. I Personally wouldn't stand in that line again but I'm happy I tried it and got to for myself Êwhat people make such a big fuss about. I think people are drawn to this place for their unique flavors.

I was pretty full when I walked into Bi-Rite. But once I started tasting the ice cream, I was hungry again! Everything I tried here was pretty delicious. Any place that turns tea flavors into ice cream is pure genius to me. They use whole cream here from Straus Creamery. You can definitely taste the richness and quality. I tried just about every flavor. But decided to go with the snickerdoodle one, earl grey, and milk chocolate chai. They were all very yummy. The ice cream here is pretty decently priced too. I got 3 decent sized scoops for $5. It was a very satisfying amount of ice cream without being too much.

Why are there 4,000 reviews of this place, instead of for the local Rite-Aid with their $1 scoops of ice cream or your local strip mall's Baskin and Robbins? Here are your top 10 answers: 10. It's right across the street from Dolores Park, where post-Mary Jane indulgers are getting a munchies jones, and this will do. 9. It's right across the street from the Muni train stop, where the riders from DTSF FiDi, frustrated by cubiclization syndrome, need a sugar rush to feel good about themselves. 8. It's near all the Mission District dive bars, and after doing a dive bar crawl, Yelpers crawl over here to settle their boiling stomachs and try to stop the sky from spinning. 7. El Farolito is too heavy a meal right now, and is reserved for 2 am after bar/club meals only. 6. Newbie San Francisco Yelpers think that if they eat and review: A) Burma Superstar B) Ike's Sandwiches C) Any restaurant serving Fois Gras D) Bi-Rite Creamery then they will become Elite within two weeks! 5. Because You Scream, I Scream, We all Scream for Ice Cream! 4. Because a higher percentage of SF Yelpers were weened on breast milk than anywhere in the US, and this is the next best thing to sucking a teat 3. Because 50% of active Yelpers are Asian Women, and we all know that they all want to act, think, dress, eat, and review alike 2 Because single, on-line daters can rave about this place to their date, then agree to meet them here for their first Real World meeting, then scan them in-line and flake out if they don't like what they see 1. Because SF Yelpers are foodie snobs, and spoiled adult children who were over-indulged with ice cream and other sugary snacks, so what better way to combine Ice Cream and Gourmet Food flavors, than at Bi-Rite, where you can get them combined in one?

I scream for Ice Cream! Though I can't see myself waiting an hour in line for this ice cream...I can definitely see myself waiting a little bit longer in line than I would at some other ice cream joints. ÊI honestly, didn't think it would be that great but I best believe the hype because it delivered and delivered good... I tried the maple walnut and salted caramel my first time here. ÊWhew wee...this be some good shit. ÊThe ice cream was smooth and cutting through the ice cream with the spoon felt like I was cutting through some warm butter with a knife. ÊNo forceful stabbing needed here. ÊEating the ice cream was just as fun as slicing it with my spoon. ÊIt was soft and not overpowering with sweetness at all. ÊJust the right flavor combination that it felt refreshing rather than just eating a spoonful of sugar given the flavors I picked. ÊMy friends and I all agreed that this was some pretty bomb ice cream. ÊOne friend actually made us swear not to tell his wife about this place because he knew that she'd make him drive all the way to city weekly to get this ice cream. ÊSo lets hope she doesn't read this review...ever. The staff here was another positive. ÊThey're just so energetic (but not in an annoying way) that one can't help but be put in a good mood when walking in. ÊI'll definitely have to come back to this place to try all the other flavors they have. ÊBi-Rite Creamery...I will see you again!

I came here today (second time), but I hadn't reviewed my first visit. FIrst visit. I came here on a Saturday afternoon with a friend to try Bi-Rite for the first time. I had the Salted Caramel with a scoop of Brown Sugar Ice Cream (single in a cup). The consistency of the ice cream was too soft for my liking, but the flavors were spectacular. Second visit. I came again with some underclassmen this afternoon after walking around the area briefly. The line was a 5-minute wait. After sampling the Orange Cardamom and the Orange Sorbet, I decided on the Orange Cardamom in a kid's scoop. There was practically a perfect balance between the orange flavoring/zest and the spice--the perfect balance of sweet and savory in the ice cream. I think I just found my new favorite ice cream flavor here. Bi-Rite Creamery's a must-try if you're on the lookout for ice cream on a sunny afternoon!

Bi-Rite reminds me why I love ice cream so much, when it's done right, boy is it incredible. I got 2 (hefty) scoops in a cone for around $3 & after taking my first lick I wished I had gotten 3 scoops! I had the the honey lavender, which doesn't taste like soap at all! It's the perfect amount of fragrant & sweet. And I had the malted vanilla with peanut brittle & milk chocolate pieces, great combo. Both flavors perfectly creamy & delish. Parking of course is Darwinian in the mission (survival of the fittest!), but totally worth battling for ice cream!

First time I came here on a rare, hot San Francisco day in February and found the line wrapped around the corner! Fast forward to June, I was lucky enough to park a block away. The line was short and I waited less than 20 minutes to try the salted caramel, balsamic strawberry, and ricanelas. Hands down, ricanelas was my favorite flavor! I couldn't get enough! After eating my one scoop, I felt guilty for even getting those other flavors. Overall, I wish they dubbed more snickerdoodle & cinnamon into the ice cream. And that is an understatement. Since I live 100+ away from the creamery, I have to settle for Vanilla bean haagen dazs infused with three tablespoons of ground cinnamon. You're killin me, Bi-Rite.

HONEY LAVENDER. HONEY LAVENDER. Sounds weird since it's a plant, but it's so good. I'm in class right now (and writing yelp reviews) and can only think about HONEY LAVENDER. So good. Love it. Get it. Pricey, but good for real ice cream. Seating inside is limited, but who cares when you have honey lavender ice cream? Bathroom available, but requires you to hold a big spatula (or was it a whisk?) with the key on it. Doesn't look very sexy, but who cares when you have honey lavender ice cream? Earl grey and salty caramel are both good too. Pick mandarin orange if you want something more fruity/sorbet-y. Good consistency.

Another great ice cream experience here...I had the usual: Brownie Sundae with three scoops of ice cream. ÊI had Salted Caramel, Ricanelas and Chocolate. ÊEverything was great and the taste of the excellent quality really came through.

I am usually more of frozen yogurt person, but this happened to be along the same route to the same place I was volunteering sooo...I decided at [first/last] minute to take a pit stop here. after tasting several/many of their flavors (felt kinda bad---like a cheap [or the more politically correct term: "economical"] chinese like my father would say. but i am indecisive when it comes to almost everything....FINALLY, i decided on a small cup of their salted caramel and coffee toffee...mmm. so good...oh so good. clearly better than the "economical" gallon-sized tubs of cheaply-made ice cream that my college roommates and family [used to] stock up on.

***Bi-Rite Creamery is a very popular (as well as nationally known) gourmet ice cream shop; while all of my visits have not been superb, their ice cream is good and this is definitely a must-stop if you are an ice cream fan and find yourself in San Francisco*** I remember first finding out about Bi-Rite Creamery through Yelp. ÊI later saw it mentioned in a national magazine. ÊOf the places in Los Angeles that get national recognition (Pizzeria Mozza, Father's Office, The Bazaar), I would say that they are all worth trying. ÊI feel the same about Bi-Rite Creamery. The ice cream is good at Bi-Rite. ÊTheir ice cream has a pleasing texture and some of the flavors are tasty. ÊMy experiences here have been inconsistent though, but I think this is a given with the temperamental nature of ice cream and the flavors/ingredients used. ÊNone of the experiences have really been bad, but the textures and flavors have been more pleasing on some visits than others. The salted caramel was not that good on this visit. ÊI am not sure if this was the case on previous visits, but the salted caramel had the flavor of burnt caramel. ÊYelper Clara K. had mentioned this to me and it was very noticeable on this visit. ÊThe texture was pretty good, but it was a little broken and not as smooth, creamy and dense as my last visit. ÊIf you look at my previous photo of this flavor, you will notice a very clear difference in the texture. Their cinnamon ice cream had a much nicer flavor. ÊThe cinnamon flavor was good and the ice cream had pieces of snickerdoodle cookies in it. ÊWhile the snickerdoodles were definitely noticeable in the ice cream and provided a considerable crunch, the addition of them was not too obtrusive. Service was quick. ÊIf you go during the day on a weekday, you can really avoid the lines and feel more comfortable about sampling a lot of their flavors. The prices were good. ÊThough the scoops were small, I thought the ice cream was reasonably priced for gourmet ice cream (gourmet ice cream shops in LA, including ones not as good as Bi-Rite, seem to be more expensive). I like the ice cream at Bi-Rite Creamery and have stopped there on my last three trips to San Francisco. ÊWhile I like the ice cream, I would say I prefer Pasadena's Carmela. ÊTheir ice cream is creamier and denser. ÊThe flavors are also more distinct and satisfying. ÊIn addition, while the service at Bi-Rite Creamery is fine, the service at Carmela is much more personable. ÊStill, I would say Bi-Rite Creamery is a must-stop if you are in San Francisco. ÊTheir ice cream can be very good and it could likely become one of your favorites. Parking is difficult here, but I was able to find a space east of Bi-Rite Creamery and nearby Tartine.

The group, including Daniel L, Jon W. Fia R, and a few others, decided it was an ice cream day, and the weather suggested it was one as well, so, after checking out the Japantown street fair, we headed to Bi-Rite. ÊWe were greeted with a long line that wrapped around the corner of the block, so that was a pretty good sign that this place is pretty good. ÊI've actually been here before at night, when the line wasn't so long, so I had a taste of Bi-rite, and wasn't disappointed. This time around, I'm still a satisfied customer. ÊI got two scoops of the Coffee-toffee flavored ice cream, which was absolutely delicious. ÊI was never crazy about toffee, and the only reason I chose that flavor was because I was craving coffee at the time. ÊI never knew toffee could ever taste so good. ÊEach piece from each bite I took was heavenly. ÊThe consistency of the ice cream was just right, not icey, not too creamy, good coffee flavor, and the toffee pieces were chewy, sweet, plentiful, and were like pieces of caramel. Another thing I like about this creamery is, their variety of flavors. ÊThat day, they offered olive oil, basil, and other unique flavored ice cream you wouldn't expect from your typical ice cream parlor, but this isn't your typical ice cream parlor. ÊThe place is located right next to Mission Dolores park, so if you're in the mood for a nice walk or you simply want to lay down and enjoy the weather, the park is right across the street. Well worth the wait. ÊI'll be back

Since I basically live for ice cream it was a no-brainer that I was coming here. I wanted to come so bad that we actually took a cab out of our way to get some ice cream. I would do it again. I tried a handful of flavors and they were all pretty delicious. I bought a double scoop of salted caramel and ricanelas (cinnamon and snickerdoodle). Salted caramel is one of my favorite flavors out there and this one was very good. It did taste a little burnt like other reviews have mentioned but I kind of liked it like that. It's not overly sweet. I do prefer the salted caramel from some places closer to me but this one did not disappoint. However, I loved the ricanelas more. It was such a yummy combo of cinnamon and doodle that I couldn't get enough. Yum, happy Tai belly. Both SN (dining partner deluxe) and I noted that there was a bit of a funky aftertaste. It sort of lingered in the top of your mouth. Hmm. odd. Regardless I would still definitely come back for some more of their delicious and unique ice cream offerings!

Wow, this place rocks!!! You know this place has to be amazing if there is a line outside the establishment going on twenty people deep. All this for ice cream!! My favorites at Bi-Rite Creamery are the Toasted Coconut and Balsamic Strawberry. Rich and deep flavors with a fantastic creamy texture. According to some of the regulars we talked to in that long line, the Salted Caramel is very good and popular. Once you get inside they also sell fresh baked cookies bagged up. I took a bag of 6 chocolate chip cookies for my flight to Vegas the next day. The cookies were not too sweet, which I prefer. The cookies also had that complex texture of soft, crispy and chewy throughout that I love! The employees here are very friendly! They don't get annoyed when you ask to sample the many unique flavors they offer. Prices are reasonable. Also, right across the street from Dolores Park which is a great place during nice days out. This place is definitely worth a try!

Are you kidding me Bi-Rite Creamery? Are you for real? Pretty sure they use hints of magical spice to make ice cream THIS good. I mean come on. If you disagree with me I don't think I want to know you (that might be a bit dramatic, but so what). This place had a line out the door. I waited 15 minutes to get to the front. Worth it? You bet your sweet ace it was! The people at the front were handing spoon-fulls of this and that, left and right, allowing us to try multiple flavors before ordering. I ended up trying the basil and olive oil flavors. The basil tasted like basil. Maybe somewhat like a margherita pizza. Which was fine, but not really my favorite when it comes to ice cream. However, the olive oil was phenomenal. I know it sounds super weird, but you have to trust me on this one. I ended up with a scoop of balsamic strawberry and salted caramel. I wasn't crazy about the salted caramel like everyone else is, apparently, but I was completely obsessed with the balsamic strawberry. The balsamic tangyness really brought out the sweet strawberry flavor. Salted caramel tasted like salted caramel. It was delicious, but I'm not a huge caramel fan. I ordered it mainly because everyone raves about it. I think next time I'll order the strawberry again, and this time pair it nicely with a scoop of olive oil. MmmmmMMmmmmm! P.S. You can purchase your birthday cake here, or pints of their famous flavors. You can also purchase their many delicious varieties of hot fudge in a jar. I'm crazy about this place!

Hi. My name is Lauren S. and I am just your typical unemployed 20 something. Boy if there are two things in this city I like, it's gotta be Bi-rite ice cream and Ike's sandwiches. Let me tell you why. 1. I love ice cream. Seriously, I've probably gained 10 lbs this week alone just by eating/sobbing into a lot of ice cream (hey don't ask why, mind your own DAMN BUSINESS). It's not pretty, but it's okay because I still am. Also MK told me it's probably just water weight because I'm about to hit that time of the month when I find out that I'm not pregnant and likely to stay that way. But I digress. My point is if there's one thing I have come to really know well in my 20 something years on earth, it's ice cream, and Bi-Rite is tits as we all know. 2. I love sandwiches. The more shit and mayonnaise you can pile on the better, which nobody does better than Ike's. I haven't been here since I turned my back on vegetarianism (which Jillian and Sean M. should probably do, too, because come on guys, you think a cow wouldn't put your ass on a bun if it could get its grubby hooves on you? Yeah, cows do not give a fuck so just return the favor). I'm sure they have good non-vegetarian options as well, which I may try just as soon as I can find an hour of my life to squander while waiting for a goddamn sandwich. Hey since I just mentioned two places in one review I think yelp HQ will be cool with me posting this on two different pages, right? Love ya HQ, never change. Just kilt two birds with one stone, BAM.

:o :) :D :'( Were my faces during this awesome experience. I can safely say that this was the best ice cream I've ever had. East coaster stamp of approval. It was pretty late and night and I was surprised by the line that was forming out the door. Don't fret! The service people manage to keep the line moving amazingly fast while dealing with those indecisive people who insist on trying every flavor (that would normally be me but I was too hungry). Happy about the roasted banana. There was such a strong flavor of banana, but not in an off-putting way. Perfectly creamy and the real kicker was when my scoop of roasted banana combined with the salted caramel. The combo is seriously so heavenly you want to stop time and/or move into Bi-Rite ice cream freezer and sleep next to the cartons of ice cream for the rest of your life. Sadface for realizing that I won't be back in SF for a while. But the next time I do i'm taking a taxi straight from the airport to Bi-Rite.

Does anyone remember that ridiculously warm day we experienced about two weeks ago? I believe the weekend of October 22nd will be remembered for many reasons- but let's all keep in mind the sweatastic weather we had! After a lovely pic-a-nic lunch in Dolores Park, my girlfriend and I decided to try Bi-Rite Creamery. It was hot, we were hot, and who doesn't love ice cream? Bi-rite seems to have two locations...one of which offers a plethora of flavors, and one of which just offers a few. We looked at the line. We stood in the line. We decided we were in favor of deciding upon one flavor and just spliting a pint. So we did (and we got to skip the line!!!!) We tried the Salted Caramel- which I believe to be Bi-Rite's famous flavor. It was different- but so delicious! It definitely is more sugary than most ice-creams (they even state this on the freezer door) so it's hard to eat a lot of. We ended up donating half the pint to the homeless man on the corner. I would absolutely venture back to Bi-Rite to try more of their ice cream...I'm just not sure I can get over the line.

(See pics) Yes worth the line waiting but the wait was actually not slow at all. With all the different cuisines I have had, I always like trying new tastes and that includes ice cream flavors. The olive oil was very subtle (but not oily at all) and was cute tasting with the smoothness to it. The basil was quite refreshing and different as usually I think of both as cooking ingredients. Good job for the inventive tastes and introduced me to savory ice-cream!!

I know there's been a rage with going to big ice cream sundae places like Fentons and Leatherby's but I think if you want some yummy ice cream and nothing too crazy bi-rite is the best! ÊI can honestly say it's my favorite of the places I've been to just because the flavors are rich and the ice cream is super creamy. ÊI love ricanelas, coffee toffee, malted vanilla, brown sugar -- and today, I tried the olive oil and though it really does taste like it, it's pretty darn good!

So...I've been here a few times. Every time I went, I've stood in line, sampled different flavors, and opted for my go-to order: a small cup of honey lavender and balsamic strawberry. (The salted caramel is just too rich in my opinion.) However, Saturday was different. 1. There was no line. Like, at all. (I KNOW! Craziness.) 2. Since there was no pressure, I took my time and sampled three flavors. I was about to order when the guy who was helping me asked the fateful question, "Do you want to try something fun?" ...Hell yeah I want to try something fun! 3. He spooned a little honey lavender ice cream (ftw!) then went to the back counter and did some magic. After 10 seconds he handed me a spoon that looked something like a Jackson Pollock piece. 4. The result was an explosion in my mouth. Literally. Never tasted anything like it. I felt like a kid in a candy shop that tried Everlasting Gobstoppers for the first time, but this was INFINITELY better because we all know those probably taste horrible while whatever was on the spoon was epic. EPIC. 5. Thus, I was introduced to The Dainty Gent. (More than just dainty if you ask me...) *ahem, clears throat* May I present to you...Bi-Rite's honey lavender ice cream drizzled in blood orange infused hot fudge, extra virgin olive oil, and sprinkled with a touch of sea salt. You may think I'm nuts. (Olive oil? Who would've thought?) But I let my friend try a bite, thence she made a fast beeline down the street and asked the guy at the counter, "Hi, my friend was just here...Can I have something fun?"

The biggest attraction to this place is that they offer fun and exotic flavors like basil, lavender, and snickerdoodle! HOWEVER, the quality of the ice cream is mostly a matter of preference...if you like ice cream that is light and icy, and not too sweet then this is the place for you! If you are more like me, and you like your ice cream to have some substance (i.e. heavy, rich and creamy) well, I've tried at least 6 different flavors here and none of them offer that. Also, I like my ice cream to be almost frozen hard, and the texture at Bi-rite is more like what you'd expect a thick milkshake to be. TIP: Eat your ice cream fast! I noticed that the ice cream often melts and falls apart in the cone before you can finish it. Also, be prepared to wait in line for at LEAST half an hour.

Loved the homemade whipped cream, LOVED the fresh fudge, love the bittersweet chocolate chunks & the coffee toffee was surprisingly not too sweet! ÊNow for the one everyone talks about, salty caramel, maybe it was flavor overload from the other stuff but it was bland to me. I got a make-ur-own sundae but I felt it was higher priced (7) than if u had just went for the 2 scoops + 1 topping, 1 sauce, 1 whipped cream(3.5+.75/topping=5.75).. My sundae was pretty big & filling so maybe that's why it costs more. My bf's brown butter pecan had delicious pieces of nuts that almost melted like butter but were maybe too mushy.

I crave their earl grey ice cream. ...mmmm..I actually can't believe that I haven't already reviewed this place since I actually have many holes punched out of my frequent buyer card. ÊIn fact once I ran into a friend here and I was a bit embarrassed when he saw me walking out with several pints of ice cream.

I was really skeptical walking into Bi-Rite. I didn't think it could possibly live up to the hype. Alas...every delicious bite did. The service was great -- the line looked long because it hung out the door so far, but the counter is right there when you get in, so it really didn't take that much time to get a cone full of deliciousness. Plus when you finally do get to the counter, they'll let you try as many flavors as you want. Usually I hate being greedy and taking advantage of such generosity, since I generally know what flavor I'm going to go with as soon as I read the menu. But I was absolutely torn between the Ricanelas (cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodles), the Brown Sugar with Salted Caramel Swirl, and the Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate. After sampling each of the three, I was still so torn. Instead of indulging and having all three, I held strong and just went with a kiddie sized Ricanelas in a sugar cone. Every bite was heaven. I will definitely be back to have equally as amazing experiences with their other flavors. If you love absolutely delicious ice cream (perfectly creamy texture, delicious flavor combinations, high quality fillings), then Bi-Rite might be your paradise. At least try it -- even the most cynical out there cannot deny that they do a really good scoop of ice cream.

Somehow Bi-Rite fell of my radar of places to review. Not that it needs anymore, it already has made quite a name for itself. What else can be said about near perfection? Not a whole lot. If I lived any closer to Bi-Rite, i'd need a lipid panel. Stat. Location is key, it's right off of Dolores Park, making it perfect to grab and go eat on the grass on a nice day. Flavors are adventurous but they don't get too out there like Humphry Slocombe (good or bad), my favorites are Honey Lavender, Ricanella's, Salted Caramel, and who would've thought, Olive Oil ice cream could taste so good? Writing about them has just made me salivate and I think I'm past due for a visit. Time to whip out the old stamp card!

I was in the Bay area visiting family and my cousin said that we had to try either Mitchell's OR Bi-Rite Creamery....we were closer to Bi-Rite....WAHOO - I am soo glad we came here! After a challenging time finding parking on a Saturday evening, the line was around the corner. I would guess over 100 peeps waiting for this wonderful ice cream shop. (So worth the wait!!) While in line, from my iPhone, I was able to read through less than a fraction of the 3000+ Five Yelp Star reviews. But the decision was easy - a scoop of the Salted Caramel Ice Cream was a must! I went a tad further than a few of the reviews that I was able to read....I ordered the "Trifecta".... The Trifecta is one scoop each of three different flavors, the Salted Caramel, a Malted Vanilla with peanut butter brittle and small milk chocolate bites, and a Brown Sugar with a ginger caramel swirl. (See my iPhone photo) I am not good at explaining heavenly tastes, but much like wine and food are paired together....the flavors that all three were smooth, rich and a creamy goodness in each bite. You don't inhale this ice cream, you savor each spoonful and appreciate each taste for each of their complimentary flavors. The sweet and salty conundrum is apparent in every scoop....you will learn with each bite why SWEET and SALTY compliment each other...OMG...I am hungry for Bi-Rite's Creamery "Trifecta". I LUV IT....Five Yelp Stars....I am screaming for Bi-Rite Creamery!! ;-p

YUM^INFINITY! I don't think I could ever get sick of this place. The ice cream is SUBLIMEEEE. It is so rich, flavorful, and creamy. I always get the salted caramel no matter what. The flavor is so happily complex. I definitely didn't know that salt could bring out the best in sweetness until I first came here in college. Bi-rite taught me so much about mixing different flavors I never thought of (balsamic strawberry, brown sugar ginger swirl, sigh...). The line can be ridiculous though. One time, I waited 45 minutes but it was totally worth it. I love how they always have at least 10+ flavors a day and there really is a flavor for anyone. This place is a MUST GO for anyone in SF or anyone who visits SF. Oh, after you get your ice cream, go over to Dolores Park and sit there. And if you're still hungry, go to Tartine Bakery and get a croque monsieur (ask for more pickled veggies!!!).

I finally got to try this place! I got two scoops, one of coffee toffee and one of cookies and cream. They were wonderful! There are giant pieces of toffee, and real pieces of cookies. Their spoons are old fashioned, back-in-the-day wood spoons, which make it an authentic ice cream experience :). They also sell their ice cream in pints. They also have stamp cards. The staff was very friendly, and the best part: no tax! Their seating isn't the greatest, but I think most people take it to-go anyway. Definitely will come back and hopefully try all their flavors next year!

DESSERT: 1.) Strawberry balsamic - yummieee fit my craving that night 2.) Salted caramel - good tasty interesting. Other times I loove this, but tonight I was in a more tart fruity mood 3.) Basil - very interesting. Tastes like italian meal in spoonful. Odd. Lol. Service Pink hair girl... starts with an a, "like he street name" they say but I didn't know what that street was lol Maybe it was Arguello. Yea? Anyway usually at ice cream stores I fel bad asking for s many samples but she let me sample a lot, more than I intended to. But it made me upgrade to two flavors instead of jus one. And now I'll instead of only one flavor on my to come back for, I'm down o come back for the strwberry balsamic... or the chocolate coconut one ATMOSPHERE: Very small shop.

If an ice cream place has a weird/out of the ordinary flavors...this is how they become big. Bi-Rite is very similar to Penny's Creamery in Santa Cruz (they serve organic and unique flavors as well). The line is super long, but moves fairly quickly. They use real spoons when giving samples. I had to think fast when I was here so I wouldn't hold up the line. I ended up with a cup of Toasted Coconut and Mint Chocolate Chip ice cream. Really creamy and exotic. The toasted coconut had real coconut shavings in them. The mint chocolate chip was very refreshing. Their ice cream is just unexplainable. TRY IT. The service is really friendly and they aren't stingy on the samples. There are a good amount of flavors to choose from, that I guarantee you can't find anywhere else. Balsamic Strawberry? Honey Lavender? What the.... come to Bi-Rite! This is where it's at! Oh yeah, you can even make your own ice cream sandwiches!

The samples were fun, but I felt the pressure to choose quickly from the hungry crowd breathing down my neck behind me. The seating area is very limited and tight. Tip: Bring an Igloo cooler and buy some pints of ice cream "to go" for a late night dessert at home!!! Cheers!!!

This place earns its reputation as among the best ice cream in town. Scratch that, the best ice cream in the state and perhaps in the country/world. Bi-Rite blends aspects most other ice cream places wish they had: 1) The balance between classic flavors and "trendy" ones. You can come here and get a great vanilla, or instead decide on something a little more adventurous. 2) Standout flavors that are consistent winners. Ricanelas is easy to gloss over when you're evaluating the menu, but you absolutely have to try it. I don't even like snickerdoodles that much but combining them with cinnamon ice cream makes for a frozen treat that is truly delightful. 3) Proximity to a park. Underrated I think in terms of aspects that make an ice cream place likable, but being able to stroll out to the park is a huge benefit. 4) Generosity with samples. It would be easy for a place this popular with a line this long to be stingy about sampling, but Bi-Rite lets you sample around, gives you real spoons (Interested in how many of those they go through per day) and still manages to keep the line going. OK, so the line is usually ginormous, but if you are willing to eat ice cream at 10 in the morning or when it is very cold outside (and we all know who of us we are), it can be avoided. Either way, if you're stopping for ice cream in San Francisco, you must start at this place.

Came here the same day as Pride at 9pm or so after having Mexican for dinner with a friend! Woohoo! Who knows how we managed to have such a heavy dinner, and still had room for dessert? OH DUH. Because it's ice cream we're talking about here. The streets were blocked off because of Pride, but I knew we had to make it to Bi-Rite! Was graced with parking half a block away. As we walked over, the streets reeked of alcohol, urine, and god knows what, though it did not disrupt our appetite for the creamy goodness of Bi-Rite Creamery. Not a very long line just quite yet, but it was getting there. A random passerby-er asked if we were getting salted caramel and the crowd in line said "OF COURSE!" Had the single size ($3.25) of infamous salted caramel and malted vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate. ÊFriend had the same! Salted caramel almost tastes like toffee to me, with a little burntish taste. It was good! And paired with the malted vanilla was nice, because I enjoyed the surprise of texture from the peanut brittle and milk chocolate. Yeah, do yourself a favor and get the salted caramel. It really is what it's hyped up to be.

The atmosphere is really cute I got a double scoop, one of their Ricanelas and Coffee Toffee. It was sooooo good. Their coffee ice cream was like drinking a cup of coffee.

The line is long at times but if your with a good friend it moves quick. Workers are extremely nice and attentive ... and they give you all the lil spoon samples you can handle .. overall It's always a good experience.

I always swore I would never line up for anything in my life-- but not in the case of really delicious ice-cream. The line today went around the building.... AHH!! Honey-Lavender - I thought it was going to taste like soap but it didn't. The flavor was very light and balanced. Salty Caramel was delicious & flavorful. Balsamic Strawberry taste like regular strawberry icecream but better, you can't go wrong with that. This place is near Dolores Park & Mission High School. Parking can extremely suck, have fun!

My first experience at Bi-Rite I tried the Strawberry Balsamic. I thought it was good, but not "that good" to command the ridiculously long line I see out the door every weekend. Somehow I went back and tried the Salted Caramel, Ricanella, Honey Lavender, and Ginger. OMG! I don't think I've had better ice cream than Bi-Rite's Salted Caramel. Not usually a caramel fan, I was surprised by how much I ended up loving it. The touch of salt in the caramel and the restraint in sweetness makes this a flavor for the grown up taste buds. The other flavors were also very good and way better than Strawberry Balsamic, but I consider them sidekicks to my obvious favorite. If you love bananas in your ice cream, I highly recommend the banana split. They torch the sugar coated halved bananas to make a crispy caramel coating as you order. It is then drizzled with fudge, sprinkled with pecans, and topped with real whipped cream. When the line extends to the corner of 18th and Dolores, you've got about a 20 minute wait until you get to the yummy yum yums!

Salted Caramel + Earl Grey combo is on HIT.

In general, it's already really hard to say no to ice cream, but if it's Bi-Rite, it's just that much harder. I will go even if I am about to explode from a filling dinner (which was the case during my last trip to Bi-Rite). The line is usually long, but it goes pretty quickly. It's best if you "tag team" it so that someone gets in line while the other person gets parking, because parking in this area is an absolute nightmare. That's really the only thing that stops me from coming here. Yes, I love all the flavors that people talk about: salted caramel, balsamic strawberry, earl grey,... the list goes on. I "like" the honey lavender, but it wouldn't be my first choice. Some people I know say that it tastes like soap, but I think it's just a taste preference. My biggest piece of advice: Try anything, even if it sounds weird! Last time, I decided to sample their olive oil ice cream. I never expected to like it so much -- enough to actually get a scoop of it! If you're too full, take a container to go!

Two words: salted caramel. I had one taste of their salted caramel ice cream, and I was sold. The balsamic strawberry is delicious, but nothing compares to the salted caramel. Their ice cream cakes are also delicious. Try balsamic strawberry with chocolate cake! Got to admit, their soft serve just doesn't compare to the ice cream. It doesn't matter if it's foggy or rainy, the line can be long. Tip: buy pints of the ice cream in the soft serve line to avoid the wait. The ginger ice cream tastes like ACTUAL ginger (hint: pass!)

This place is completely over-hyped. It has an amazing reputation, but every time I go, I keep trying to convince myself that I will eventually grow to like its flavors. The problem for me is that their ice cream is slightly salty and icy, compared to the typical creamy ice cream you would find at other stores. A lot of people actually enjoy that, so if that's what you're looking for, go for it.

It's delicious, homemade ice cream in a variety of mindblowingly creative and ridonculously scrumptious flavors. Yes, you have to wait in a long line to get a scoop, but something about waiting in line for ice cream makes you feel all giddy inside. (Note: If you want a homemade fruit popsicle, you do not have to wait in said line, and if you are okay with soft serve, the line is generally shorter. However, you're here, and unless you live in SF, you may as well go big and creamy!) With a "single" scoop you get more than enough ice cream and two flavors. I couldn't resist a cone, but if I did it again I would cup it because it was hot. My scoops were melting so quickly that I had to shove it all in my mouth before it ended up in a sad pool on the sidewalk. As a result, I wasn't able to appreciate the culinary nuances of salted caramel versus brown sugar with some nifty gingery swirl. The most my tongue was able to process was "cold, salty, sweet, gingery, good!" A little birdie told us next time we should try the honey lavender. Who knew birds had such refined taste buds?

Oh. Em. Gee. Heaven has arrived on top of a cone. I absolutely love the flavors at Bi-Rite because they are so bold and vibrant. I've had tastes of Earl Grey, Coffee Toffee, Honey Lavender, Mint Chip and Honey Tangerine, all of which make you stop and say "wow, that really does taste like...." HOWEVER, the BEST combination you could possibly dream of making will be found in the marriage of Roasted Banana and Salted Caramel. The banana has the flecks of banana in it and is so true to flavor. The complex caramel has that beautiful rich almost-burnt flavor that good caramel should have. Your taste buds will be confused into blissful oblivion as you savor their delectable love child. It's like bananas foster on steroids. When there's lines, it can be a bit tedious as you wait impatiently for those lame people in front of you to sample every flavor. But keep your cool! This ice cream is worth waiting for.

Oh.My.God. This is perhaps the best ice cream I've ever had. Arriving on a early Monday night, there was no line. Yes, no line up. All these flavours, I needed to quickly narrow down what I wanted. Trying out different flavours-salted caramel, brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl, malted vanila.... Finally, I decided on honey lavender, creme fraiche, and balsamic strawberry, on a sugar cone. This was amazing. Honey lavender was the perfect amount of sweetness, creme fraiche was creamy and sweet, and the balsamic strawberry, a light hint of the balsamic bringing the freshness of the strawberry flavour out. Making me super happy, I seriously wanted to ship some pints home!

Where to begin with this place! I was expecting for it to be a line around the street but guessing by the weather earlier, and for it being early spring, ice cream wasn't really a top choice for people on a cold late afternoon. But Ice Cream is a perfect time throughout all the day for me! Took some friends out on a day trip out here and was a little bummed because I wanted to find some good eats but that wasn't the case with some of my friends. I should have whipped out my phone and jumped on Yelp to get some spots. After we ate at a restaurant chain in Union Square, we were pretty much done and was going to finish the Night in San Jose. Well good thing I was driving because I was craving dessert. Thanks to my food/beer partner in crime I was led to this place. I had a feeling if I told her I didn't come here she would have been mad (somewhat) only because I'm basically a step away from the place. Well parking was the tricky part. I was so determined to find parking that I circled the place about a dozen times. Not giving up luckily I found an opening and got my car to fit that spot. We did a little speed walk and got there. Felt a little stupid because there was a window outside and apparently it was coffee and soft serve ice cream. I needed to make my way 2 steps forward and that's where the mother load is. Get in there and the place smells like ice cream heaven. Smelt like fresh waffle cones being made. Looked at the menu and was sure I had died. I already knew what ice cream I wanted and that was the Snicker Doodle Ice cream, that's my favorite cookie so why not have it in ice cream. Sampled quite a few and was sold on the Snicker Doodle and the Coffee Toffee. Hands down the best ice cream I've tasted so far. So creamy and rich and all that goodness. For sure when I'm in the Bay Area I'm going to try and make an effort to make a stop by no matter what weather it is. I'm pretty sure in the summer time it gets ridiculously busy. But for this ice cream, I'm willing to wait. MMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!

So good! Where else can you get such wild flavours of soft-serve ice cream? And they're delicious! I had a chocolate mint cone when I was there, but I kind of wish I had done a two-flavour twist... Amazing. It's like the best ice cream truck ever, but you don't have to wait until you hear that magical music -- you can just pop over to the Bi-Rite Creamery anytime you have a craving!

Yes, Bi-Rite does in fact live up to the hype. ÊThe cookies 'n cream (my staple since childhood) was delicious -- generous chunks of cookie, and the texture of the ice cream was just right. ÊAlso tried some of the twist soft serve, which was equally as delicious. ÊYou can't go wrong with Bi-Rite, and apparently 4000+ people seem to agree!

Their salted caramel ice cream was the best ice cream ever invented. every single lick is breaks my heart because i know eventually that this delicious creation will come to an end. i dont even mind waiting in line because the wait isn't too bad. and if i'm in a hurry, i buy it by the pint, so i can enjoy my bi-rite from the comfort of my own home. their brown sugar is pretty good too for those not a fan of caramel. but i seriously wouldn't comprehend why anyone wouldn't enjoy this satisfying treat.

WOW. Êtried a scoop of the salted caramel and a scoop of the snickerdoodle and both were out of this world! ÊIve never had such creamy delicious ice cream in such unique flavors. they have a ton of other really cool flavors too like balsamic strawberry and honey lavender (will have to try those next time) and awesome toppings (almond toffee, toasted walnuts etc). ÊThe single scoop was fairly priced at 3.25 and the sundaes are around six bucks. Êdont be intimidated by the long lines....we went on a sunday afternoon around 5pm and the line wrapped around the block but moved fairly quickly. Ê Ê if you've never been here before, this place is a definite must try and repeat! :)

An ice cream shop that has it's own marked line like you're going into a night club means that it's got something special inside. Well Bi-Rite definitely has the recipe. On the edge of Dolores Park it's the perfect place to stop off and cool down. I tried the malted vanilla and the salted caramel. They were both awesome on their own and together as well. The ingredients in each really come through and you can tell that it is high quality ice cream. It is worth the wait, and the line (even if it does take the turn around the corner) doesn't take too long to get through. You definitely will want to take the ice cream to go and walk over to the park or at least walk through the neighborhood. Inside the shop is a bit cramped.

Maybe I just came on a day when they didn't have any exciting flavors, but it was just meh. I think I've been spoiled by Sweet Rose Creamery in LA... Bi-Rite's got nothing on Sweet Rose! I got the coffee-toffee and mint chip. It was good, but not really better than Haagen-Dazs or anything.

I was complaining that my BF hadn't taken me to the most yelped place in the nation yet. After enough whining, we ended up here on a Saturday night. When yelp tells me it was my second check in at Bi-Rite, the memories start flowing. The familiar setting of Delores Park across the street, the long line that winds around the corner.. oooohhhhhh.. I have been here! Anyway, I sampled a couple of flavors and went with salted caramel and ricanelas. Definitely happy with my choice. I also got to try the honey lavender, which is a clean refreshing flavor. Their ice cream is perfectly creamy and the unique flavors are such a selling point. If long lines and hard to find street parking scare you, then go ahead and go home and be deprived. For the rest of us, see you at Bi-Rite!

I was told of the amazing ice cream they had here, so whilst in the Mission why not make a stop at one of the often raved ice cream stops in the hipster area of the city? I mean...a hundred hipsters can't be wrong right? Okay, so the ice cream isn't bad. I had the coffee toffee and the balsamic strawberry which definitely tasted smooth and creamy, but being more of a sorbet person, perhaps I wasn't as "wow" - ed. I would definitely return when I'm back in the Mission and definitely bring friends along...but just to be clear, I wouldn't wait in a long ass line in the summers for it. If you really want some and the lines are long, just mosey over to the store half block down and get yourself some!

I have no idea why I hated on Bi-Rite a year ago. Bi-Rite, will you ever forgive me? I don't know what I'd do without the salted caramel! This time around, I gave the salted caramel another try, along with the olive oil. Both me and Kevin L. got the same thing. We agreed that the combination of salted caramel and olive oil really brought out the fruitiness of the salted caramel. DELISH!!! The flavors were great by themselves too. _Salted Caramel: What can I say that would add to this discussion. If you're a fan of salted caramel, you'll love this. The salt is there but not overpowering; it merely serves to highlight the sweet, roasted and buttery caramel flavor. YUM! It's a favorite for a reason! (Side note- I think I might have hated on it previously because I didn't think it was complex enough.. maybe the batch I had lacked salt? OR I was just being weird.) _Olive Oil: Very subtlely flavored, it tastes rich and olive oil-like. Again, it doesn't overwhelm. It's fruity and maybe even a little floral. I suspect it'd be great with some sea salt sprinkled on top, which would bring out the flavors more. Also, I wonder how this would've tasted with the Basil ice cream? Probably awesome!! Like pesto in ice cream form.. who could say no to that ;) Grab a cone and head over to Dolores... only danger is trying to keep the ice cream from melting all over the place. But it's definitely worth it!

As everyone knows, it's delicious. Of course, if it's even somewhat nice out, I avoid this place as the line gets even crazier than normal. The only real problem is choosing which flavor to get. The salted caramel is actually not my favorite, but I recently tried the basil and it was amazing. I wouldn't have picked it out myself but I'm glad I tried it. Unlike a lot of ice cream connoisseurs (and not surprisingly, since I do not consider myself one), I like soft serve quite a bit, generally more than hard ice cream. But I have to admit their soft serve is fine, but not as good as their hard ice cream. True to my cinnamon-loving nature, I think the rincanelas is the best.

Please forgive me for the following review. This ice cream is alright. *ducks onslaught of machine gun fire* I know that you guys LOVE this ice cream! Me? I liked it a lot. Perhaps it had been built up too much in my mind? Picture this: I'm sitting around a family table in Tiburon. I've just cooked supper of bacon wrapped tenderloin with a Malbec,honey thyme reduction. We've just opened a bottle of Alsatian ice wine for dessert when I'm asked, "So Mary, what do you have planned other than hanging out with us on this trip?" Without hesitation, I blurt out, "Bi Rite! I have to try Bi Rite ice cream!" (I have always been overly enthusiastic) I scan my mind to reread all the treasured reviews from on-point authors with impeccable taste. Who LOVE Bi Rite ice cream. I nod to myself for my good decision to make this trip, other than spending time with my family, ALL about Bi Rite. "Isn't that the hipster San Francisco Ice Cream place?" I am asked, and I acknowledge with a proud nod of being in-the-know thanks to all of you fabulous Yelp authors, my other familia.:-) I text friends to let them know of my incredible date with destiny. Text: Going to try Bi Rite! *Note the power of Yelp reviews in my life. It's me and Charlie (My GPS) against the world (San Francisco drivers, sheesh!) looking for street parking on 18th. I walked into Bi Rite market first without confirming the street number. Charlie is always right, always listen to him! A great market, with Bi Rite ice cream available for sale by the pint, but something is wrong, where are the free samples? The adorable family selling organic cherries in front of the market, sold me some cherries and pointed me in the right direction, across the street. Bi Rite is a cool little ice cream shop. A line has formed of well-dressed patrons anxious to buy. I do a double take of my outfit. I didn't know this was a formal occasion or I would have worn more than chap stick, flip flops, n jeans. Eager to sample the legendary stuff, I tried balsamic strawberry, salted caramel, lavender-honey and ginger. I went with salted caramel and lavender-honey. The salted caramel was good and had a darker color with a more burnt taste than I am used to, but salted caramel is a flavor that I can Êusually take or leave. The lavender-honey was my favorite, it had a great aftertaste. The texture of this ice cream was not quite as good as my local ice cream shop (Carmela) that accomplishes the same flavor to me. In Bi Rite's version, I came across a tiny ice cube or two. As a person who has sensitive teeth, I hate that! The ginger was strong, it reminded me of the cookie which I miss from childhood. The balsamic strawberry sounded cooler than it tasted to me and left an unpleasant aftertaste. The price tag on this ice cream was a little high, but that is to be expected from gourmet ice cream. Perhaps it is unfair for me to judge this beloved ice cream shop so harshly when I am not a huge fan of sweets to begin with. When it comes to ice cream, I prefer the most bizarre flavors, the most tart fruits, and even worse! I prefer tart yogurt to ice cream most of the time. In honer of my favorite review, of the mecca of reviews I have read for Bi Rite ice Cream, I'll give you my favorite ice cream/ frozen yogurt/gelato/sorbet list in order of preference. #1 Rosemary ice cream, Mama's, Barcelona, Spain. #2 Tomat de arbol gelato, (tomato) Bergerac, Quito, Ecuador. #3 Cherimoya gelato, Marco Polo, San Francisco, CA. #4 Lemongrass and Thai Basil ice cream, Bridges, Danville, CA #5 Lychee sorbet, Joe's, Venice CA #6 Passion fruit-mango frozen yogurt, Nubi, San Gabriel, CA #7 Lemon basil sorbet, Carmela, Pasadena, CA #8 Saffron ice cream, Scoops, Hollywood, CA Orange blossom, rosewater and pistachio ice cream, The Good Food Market, Pasadena, CA #9 Lavender honey ice cream, Bi Rite, San Francisco, CA In closing, I admit that I really do like Bi Rite ice cream. It's just not my favorite. Maybe I have weird taste? Maybe I have bad taste? Don't hate me! *dodges rounds of bullets from the angry mob who disagrees with me* I'm sorry? *waves white flag*

OMFG. Ê Delicious. ÊCreative flavors. ÊI settled on a small with half honey lavender/half salted carmel. ÊThe honey lavender was sweet, but not overly sweet, and not overly floral. ÊIt went perfectly with the salted carmel, which had a slightly burnt sugar taste (in a good way) which was well balanced by the sweet and floral of the honey lavender. Ê I appreciated the large sample tastes that they offered up. ÊThe guy that was helping me was just giving me tastes of interesting flavors, which was much appreciated!

Have hit up Bi Rite each time on my last 2 Bay area visits. The fist time was before I had given up dairy and I remember ordering the largest brownie sundae available and eating myself into comatose. ÊIt was really really yummy and there was not much of Êa line and we easily snagged one of the nifty bench seats around a planter box out front. This visit I was accompanying people who really wanted to try it and some who frequent it often. ÊI was not excited about watching them eat ice cream and was indifferent to going. ÊLo and behold there were a few non dairy options. I had the coconut chocolate which was really good. ÊWay better than so delicious brand in the store and very good texture and consistency. ÊI watched everyone else gorge on their sundae's and cones which all looked amazing. Ê When you develop the gluten/wheat free waffle cone let me know bi rite and I will come a running

On my recent trip to SF, I visited Bi-Rite two days in a row. The first time, I had a single scoop of the white chocolate and raspberry swirl. Heavenly. The second time, I tried the ricanelas -- cinnamon-flavored ice cream with chunks of snickerdoodles. That was absolutely delicious, especially on a sugar cone. Lines weren't too bad the times I went, but I guess I got lucky. I saw lines form pretty quickly after I received my ice cream. My only complaint would be that it is a bit pricey, but I guess the same goes for a lot of ice cream places. I love the inventive ice cream flavors and will definitely come back next time I return to SF.

i've been hearing about good reviews from this place so I thought one of these days, I'll come by and try it out. After late dinner, my friend and I looked for desserts around the area. Yelp told us this place is still open so off we went. there was a long line at 10:30pm (they close at 11). we were lucky to find parking and we waited 10 mins in the line. Êluckily it was one of those very few nights in the city when it's not cold to be out. My friend got the vegan choc/coconut and another flavor I can remember. I got brown sugar and strawberry balsamic. First, the ice cream is too sweet, it's a bit gritty...not creamy. the strawberry/balsamic tasted like strawberry jam.. not as I'm expecting it. ÊBrownsugar was okay. The service was great but the ice cream itself is definitely disappointing. Would rather have Mitchell ice cream...

After hearing about all the hype about this place, I had to go try it for myself to see how good it is. Picking a nice sunny day to go was kind of a bad decision. The line for Bi-Rite wrapped around the block and it was a 30 minute wait to get scoops of ice cream. San Francisco rarely gets a nice sunny day around this time... everyone and their mom was in line for ice cream. Everyone who came out from the store were saying it was worth the long wait. In my mind I was picturing myself shaking my fist at the ice cream scoop and saying this better be worth it. After reading reviews on how good the salted caramel and balsamic strawberry are, I chose to get those two flavors in my single bowl. After the first lick of the salted caramel, my taste buds were sent into space. The ice cream scoops were really creamy and the flavor is out of this world good! It took a few seconds for my taste buds to crash land back and slap my mouth out of shock to start nom-ing again. Gone is 60 seconds was what happened to the salt caramel. It didn't even stand a chance. The flavor was initially caramel sweet, then some salty aftertaste. Just a perfect combo. The balsamic strawberry scoop was good, but not out of this world amazing. There's a really powerful strawberry taste that seems to be overpowering sometimes. There's just too much strawberry, which left me wondering where the balsamic vinegar taste went. I'm a big fan of strawberries, but this was just too much for me. I also picked up a Lorina sparking blood orange soda, which was disappointing. The soda has a 2% of blood orange juice content, which made it taste a bit like blood orange, but more of a sugary soda taste. I had better sparking blood orange soda with 40ish% of blood orange juice that tasted more like blood orange. Would I wait 30 minutes again for Bi-Rite? HELL YES! I would wait an hour for this if necessary. Bi-Rite's ice cream is holding my taste buds hostage now and I need to go back to reclaim them.

I've tried most of the ice creameries around SF, and finally got to try Bi-Rite. The place wasn't too packed on a Friday evening, so that's a plus. Found parking right away, always good since there's only meters and street parking around. My favorites are the brown sugar with ginger and caramel. Hard to believe but I don't particularly like ginger, but it's a mild flavor so this I can eat plenty. I tried their coffee flavor, but I like the creamy textures of the Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee of Humphrey's better. Thank goodness for constant sampling and the servers are really nice. I like that they have a to go store front next to the parlor...it makes the grab and go that much quicker if the lines are to be believed around here.

Ahh Bi-Rite! True to all the hype! Rich, creamy, and true to their flavors! I came here for a pre-dinner dessert with Lucy W. I was prepared for the long line, but it moved rather quickly. Since my friend and I were just visiting the Bay area and figured it would be a long while before we came back, we decided to split 3 scoops so that we could get a whole bunch of flavors. After sampling more than half their flavors (the staff here is very friendly), we got some generous scoops of lavender honey, strawberry balsamic, and pumpkin. While the strawberry balsamic and pumpkin were lip-smacking and smooth, my friend and I both agreed that lavender honey was the favorite. It tastes like a purple meadow out of some feel-good country movie, with the wonderful fragrance of lavender and the sweet flavor of honey. Besides the unparalleled quality of ice cream, I love Bi-Rite because of their local feel and their proximity to other wonderful eateries (Tartine Bakery and Pizzeria Delfina are on the same block), making a really fatty indulgent evening ridiculously easy. **Tip: Parking here is awful, as it is in most parts of San Francisco. We found parking near the park a few blocks west.

OK dude. This place lives up to the hype. I think the wait is WELL worth it, and to me, it's not that bad since I usually go with friends anyway. It makes it more delicious and satisfying in the end =) There are a bunch of flavors so no matter what you're feeling, you'll probably have something you want. So far, I've tried salted caramel, honey lavender, and.. the ricanella.. (I think).. I also tried some of my bf's banana split. I have LOVED. They are all not too overpowering and the texture is just right. Not too heavy, but not too light like you got ripped off. Hahaha. I forgot how much it costs. Either way, it is worth it because I feel satisfied in my tummy and on my taste glands.... One thing to note for the sundae or banana split or whatever my BF got. They actually GRILLED the banana and got a li'l crust / shell of caramelization on it which was frickin' perfect.. I want to buy their ice cream cakes one day =)

There was so many unique flavors like honey lavender, olive oil, earl's grey, coffee toffee, salted caramel...etc etc etc!

Ladies and gentleman, I am the 3,953rd person to stand in that line and write a Yelp review. To wait, determined, and see if it's all worth it. Or if it's all a cruel joke. Like Senior Prom. I did it. I really did. And here's the deal: Ice cream is good in all forms. So, right away, Bi-Rite is positioned to be awesome. But, their flavors are unique and intense. Super creamy and dense. The salted caramel tastes like burnt sugar and salted butter. The basil was incredible. The chocolate was thick and fudgy. Amazing. I'm afraid that my cynical evil twin is wrong about this place, and despite this being somewhat of a Mission tourist destination, it's still totally legit.

Bi-Rite is a delightful treat not to be missed in San Francisco's Mission District The first creation I tried at Bi-Rite was Sam's Sundae: chocolate ice cream with bergamot olive oil, maldon sea salt, and whipped cream. We saw this treat on Food Network's show, "The Best Thing I Ever Ate." Now, let me be honest.. I LOVE Bi-Rite, but Sam's Sundae is definitely only for the adventurous. It didn't please my palate all that much; I enjoyed the sea salt and chocolate ice cream, but the addition of olive oil was a little too exotic for me. Most of the flavors I've tried at Bi-Rite are funky, fresh, and fun. With flavors ranging from Vanilla, Roasted Banana, Honey Lavender, Balsamic Strawberry, and Mint Chocolate Chip, there's something there for the uber-adventurous and the ultra-safe. My favorites include Creme Fraiche and Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl . Next time you're in San Francisco, grab a scoop of ice cream and head to the sunny, grassy hills of Dolores Park, which is right around the corner.

Love, LOVE it! Does it get much better than Snickerdoodle ice cream with chunks of snickerdoodle cookies? I got two scoops! My boyfriend got Coffee Toffee and Peanut Brittle, both of which were nearly as amazing as mine. These flavors are more familiar than the crazy, yet awesome, Humphry Slocombe, and so incredibly delicious. Lines are always long but move fast. Worth the calories :D

A long ass line, but worth the wait for the strawberry banana sorbet, and the brown sugar flavors. Tangy and the creamy, and then creamy then tangy. This entire process is how I like to french kiss my ice cream. Careful waiting in line though, because this is hipster central. There's no country for old men like me in these parts out here.

Had to write yet another review for BiRite because it made my tummy super dee duper happy today! The wait was a bit longer than what I'm used to here probably around 10-15min because I came by after the early dinner rush. The line was out the door and halfway from the corner of the street, definitely not too bad for a Saturday night. Meyer Lemon. My choice of deliciously creamy poison for the night! Words cannot describe how yummy this tangily sweet and creamy dessert was! Too bad it's a special flavor so they probably won't have it too often! It reminded me a bit of Italian lemon ice, except it was way more creamy than icy. You know how usually acid, like lemon juice, will make milks crumble into a precipitate? Well this definitely didn't! Don't know how they managed to mix a super acid like lemon juice with creamy ice cream (and boy, would I love to know!) but they did and it was yummy goodness!!! I also came by for ice cream last week! Got me some Roasted Banana and Earl Grey in a single scoop. For my thoughts on the roasted banana, see my previous review! :) Earl Grey. Pretty damn good! ÊOnce again a special flavor, sadsies! I need more of this in my life! A bit more on the sweet side than what I'm used to for Earl Grey. Compared to Gelateria Naia this was definitely a lot sweeter. The fragrance of the Earl Grey was pretty strong and really tasted like an Earl Grey milk tea, thanks to the creaminess of the ice cream. I loved them so much I ended up bringing those two pints home with me after I ate my single! I've also tried their Honey Lavender, Ginger, Salted Caramel, Brown Sugar and Balsamic Strawberry. I found their honey lavender to be too fragrant for my liking, I guess I love honey and lavender flavors individually, but together it's just a bit too much for me. Their ginger was good, very ginger-y tasting for a lack of a better description, but if only they had ginger AND rosewater together... NOM! Their salted caramel and brown sugar were also both too sweet for me. The salted caramel legitly tastes like salted caramel but even a small sample was too much for me since I prefer lighter choices. The brown sugar I enjoyed when I had a sample but when I got a kid's scoop, it got to be too sweet for me halfway through but I think it's probably just because I have a lower tolerance for sweets. I love their balsamic strawberry though, creamy goodness of strawberries, yummy in my tummy! Plus it's super good with their Creme Fraiche ice cream as well! Nom! Overall, LOVE Meyer Lemon, Roasted Banana, Balsamic Strawberry and Earl Grey!

In SF we're quite lucky to be able to head over to Bi-Rites soft-serve window with NO LINE, then soft-serve in hand - head over to the real LONG LINE for their ice cream! ;) Salted Caramel may still be #1 in my book, but there are other close contenders! Ricanelas with bits of Snickerdoodle cookies - I love Ricanelas but this should just be named Snickerdoodle cause it totally captured the flavor of it. Roasted Banana - I love anything made with real bananas - not artificial, and this is another one to add to the list. So deliciously light and creamy! Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl - I only like ginger when it's muted, cause it's so strong to begin with. In this flavor, it's perfect cause the sweetness of the brown sugar balances it quite well! Honey Lavender - It's confirmed - honey makes everything better! I don't like floral flavors in anything I eat, but these flavors both taste so natural. ... One day, I have to just skip that soft-serve window so I'll have room for their sundaes that look ohhh, sooo goood =)

One of the best and most unique scoop shops I've ever been to. With unique flavors like Ricanelas (snickerdoodle), lavender, and my favorite, Salted Caramel, this place is a favorite destination of mine. The line can get pretty long, especially on sunny days, but it is definitely worth the wait. The soft serve shop next door, on the other hand, is not.

I should have guessed that Bi-Rite's soft ice cream would be a fantasy of richness, but it was just yesterday that I finally tried it. Most people seem to ignore this tiny window into heaven, as the main ice cream shop gets all of the attention (and the long line). ÊStep over to the second window next time and indulge in the wonderland that is soft serve. ÊMy salted caramel and chocolate swirl cone could not have been any more delicious. Upon being presented with a multi-leveled cone I said to my companion, There's no way I'm eating this whole thing. ÊIt's huge! Turns out I was in denial because the whole thing made it into my tummy.

Finally got a chance to try out the ice cream here! With 3900+ reviews, you know it's serious stuff. It was my first time there, but it wasn't hard to find because of the line of people spilling out the door. The line was a little long, but at least it moved quickly. I got a scoop of the Salted Caramel and Honey Lavender on a cone. Both were really good, so I'm glad I got to try a couple of these not so run-of-the-mill flavors. They also have some yummy looking cookies and syrups for sale. If you're in a hurry and don't have time to wait, there are pre-packed pints to all ready to go. There is some seating inside the store, and benches outside to sit on and enjoy your ice cream. The scoops are a bit small, but it's about all quality, not quantity. Parking's a pain, so be prepared to search for a spot and then walk over. Will be back to try some other flavors!

The verdict is in... ÊI'm still torn between Bi-Rite Creamery and Humphrey Slocombe's. ÊHonestly, it's all about their signature ice creams. ÊI am still a big fan of Humphrey's Secret Breakfast (so, they tip the scale for me at 4-1/2 stars, if there were such a thing)... Nevertheless, this is a review of Bi-Rite, and the experience was great. ÊAfter waiting about 10 minutes in line, I ordered two double portions of salted caramel (sweet n' savory) / honey lavendar (mellow and aromatic), roasted banana (awesome banana flavor) / toasted coconut (great texture). ÊAll were good, but my wife and I really liked the toasted coconut (we will be back to pick up a pre-packed pint).

Ya dude, the hype is NOT over the top. Got in line around 4:45, which did extend around the corner from the shop. It really only took about 15-20 mins though, and mind you it was a sunny Saturday afternoon. Worth the wait -- and if you're in good company, who cares? Didn't get the salted caramel like everyone said, I've had so many and sometimes its just too sweet for me still. But I got the malted vanilla with brittle and the toasted coconut. Oh my LANTA the toasted coconut was pretty delicious. My friend and I walked over to Dolores to eat our ice cream while the rest of the park goers lit up and played with their dogs. Will definitely return, even on the weekend. Maybe, especially on the weekend.

Everything is amazing and so rich and yummy. They use real whipping cream and all the ice cream is handmade. I cant get enough. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is that it was pricey. $9.50 for a sunday with and extra scoop and they have a pretty long line. Thats ok. Im willing support small business like this.

After much anticipation for Bi-Rite, I finally had the chance this Friday night. The line was luckily NOT out of control and NOT a mile long, and the weather was bearable to withstand whatever line there was. It was clearly meant to be. We ordered a medium size (in which you can choose 3 flavors) to share. The salted caramel (the Yelp favorite!), the malted vanilla with peanut brittle, and chocolate coconut (vegan) were our picks. As usual, Yelpers were right! The salted caramel is most definitely worth ordering!! What a way to reward your taste buds! The malted vanilla was surprising one -- sounded slightly weird, but the sweet and salty flavor once again was a hit! The chocolate coconut was the only one we didn't fully enjoy. The coconut flavor was considerably lacking, and the vegan nature of the ice cream resulted in a slightly more gummy, almost gelato-like consistency. Good experience to taste once, but I'd skip that flavor next time around. I also sampled the honey lavender, because the flavor sounded uber cool. Unfortunately, a little too much floral for me.

This place gets crazy good business. ALL. THE. TIME. I mean c'mon, people are lining out in the cold, freezing rain to buy and eat cold, freezing ice cream? Where's the logic in that? THERE IS NONE! Therefore... this place must be good. Right? Came here last weekend looking to pig out and have some delicious hyped-up ice cream. I chose the salted caramel and balsamic strawberry flavors in a single cup and teammate got cookies n' cream and chocolate. Cookies n' cream totally beat out the salted caramel. The salted caramel tasted more like burnt caramel. :(

LONGEST LINE EVER. Okay, I will admit that some of it was my fault--I decided to stumble over to this place on a Sunday around 2-3 pm. Not the best idea. But really? Out the door, down the block and around the corner? I can't imagine how any businesses next to Birite even make business--or actually on second thought this is probably bringing customers in for them. Hm. Either way, line was WAY TOO long for me, so we just went to the soft serve window. Got the twist sundae (with honey roasted peanuts and hot fudge). It was good, for sure, but nothing that special. I've had much better soft serve in my day (you gotta hit up Yogurt Park in berkeley) and would definitely not come back. As the top reviewed place on Yelp, I really do not feel like this place measures up to its reputation :/

What everyone says is accurate. What more can I add to this!? I wasn't a fan of the honey lavender (I don't like eating ice cream with the after taste of eating my lotion) but it is very great if you love the fragrant of lavender. I instead had the OLIVE OIL. My goodness, this was not what I expected at all. Just try it. However, don't try the Basil, which was what they recommended with the olive oil. The ice cream melted fairly quickly compared to other ice cream's I've had, so that was a bummer. All in all, great eclectic flavors, amazing staff (they gave me samples to every flavor!) and great location. Wait in line, Êlook at the menu that's passed down to you while you're in line, try as many flavors as possible, and pick one or two or more as quickly as you can so others can join in the goodness too, and make your way to Dolores Park with ice cream in hand!

Since there's been a gajillion reviews written already, I won't even comment on the ice cream (ok, I will, the balsamic strawberry is my favorite).

This has inspired me to dust off my ice cream maker!

My coconut senses were tingling (you know, like spidey senses) and I ordered the coconut ice cream (they also had a chocolate choice, but I'm a weirdo and not into choco ice cream). ÊIt was pure magic! ÊCreamy vanilla/coconut base and toasted coconut flakes mixed in. Ê The "one scoop" is actually two, so be warned if you're stuffed from dinner (of course me) and want something small, it's not.

Went to Bi-Rite Creamery a few weeks ago after hearing about it from several people. It had been a hot day so it was perfect to try it out. Got there and found a queue of about 20 people or so. The hype on the streets translated when I saw the place with my own eyes. Upon seeing the menu, I was delighted to see my favorite flavor of all time, Salted Caramel on the menu. I went ahead and ordered that. The ice cream has a really unique, rich taste to it. Its unlike anything I've tried, really.

Don't let the line turn you off. Bi-Rite's ice cream is super delicious. It's creamy, dense, and most importantly packed with flavor. The orange cardamom is excellent as well as the ginger.

Possibly my favorite ice cream of all time! I just came back from a weekend in San Francisco and I'm so glad I got to try Bi-Rite. It took two tries. The first night, we arrived right at closing time and they didn't allow any more people to stand in the long line going out the door. We decided to come back the next day, and I'm so happy that we did. We waited about 20 minutes. - Salted caramel: SOO good!! Definitely a must try. - Honey lavender: Light & not too flowery tasting. - Brown sugar w ginger: Really good. Tastes similar to the salted caramel. - Roasted banana: Very strong banana flavor. I liked this one the least out of the flavors I tried. I LOVED the salted caramel and brown sugar. Seriously SOOO good! I've been craving Bi-Rite ever since I got back home from SF. I want it nowww.

I think with all the reviews and being on the food network for "The Best Thing I've Ever Ate," I don't need to write a long and detailed review. The ratings speak for themselves. I think you can't go wrong with ANY of the flavors but I got the Salted Carmel and Brown Butter Pecan. This place is a must try and the wait is well worth it.

The ice cream here is very good. ÊBut, it came as a bit of a disappointment to me. ÊAll my friends told me how great it was, but there were too many flaws for it to inspire the kind of devotion that many yelpers give it. I really like the flavors. ÊThey are very bold and they are a bit unique. ÊSalted Caramel and Roasted Banana are probably my favorite. ÊBut, even with my favorite flavors, they miss the mark slightly. ÊThe salted caramel is a bit on one dimensional. ÊIt is a bit too sweet for my taste and the sweetness really washes out the flavor. ÊThe texture is also not quite perfect. ÊIt is a little between soft-serve and hard ice cream. ÊIt doesn't have the lightness of soft-serve. ÊBut, it doesn't have the body of hard ice cream. ÊIt feels a little greasy in my mouth. ÊSimilarly, the banana is a little one dimensional. ÊThere is a lot of sweet banana flavor, but there is nothing complimentary that makes the banana flavor stand out. ÊIt is almost like eating a pancake. ÊIt is good for the first few bites, but then the starchy sweetness becomes a little boring and underwhelming. ÊContrast a pancake with a good waffle that has texture and nice toasted flavors that compliment the sweetness. ÊThat is what I think makes great ice cream. If you haven't tried it, I recommend going to try the ice cream. ÊIt is a unique experience. ÊThe line is very long. ÊThe place is filled with hipsters in expensive asymetrical haircuts on their smart phones ignoring the people around them (even the people they came with). ÊSo much whimsical facial hair and so many fedoras. ÊThis place is also popular with cool moms who like to come to re-affirm to themselves that they are still cool despite having kids and moving from the mission to bernal heights. The cupcakes are also very ok. ÊThey have good flavors, but are way too sweet for me. ÊBut, the crumb is very consistent and small. ÊAnd, the cake itself is light. ÊThe bigger problem is that the frosting is too sweet. ÊActually, don't bother with the cupcake. ÊJust get a pastry at Tartine to go with your ice cream.

Good, creamy ice cream. ÊThere may be a line out the door sometimes, but it moves pretty quickly. ÊThere are benches outside for you to enjoy your ice cream, or you could venture over to Dolores Park. ÊIf you're a sun-hater like me, there are tables inside Bi-Rite as well. The Olive Oil flavor may sound disgusting, but it actually tastes surprisingly good. ÊTry it. My favorite, though, was the Malted Vanilla (with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces) -- SO good. However, it's not amazing enough for me to drive all the way over from Oakland. ÊFentons is comparable & so much closer to home.

Ok.. this place is a TEENSY bit overrated. The ice cream isn't worth the line nor the OMG BEST THING EVER tagline. Don't get me wrong, the ice cream is creamy and above average. The price is standard (around 3 dollars for a scoop). It just didn't blow me away. The flavors aren't even that unique. If you have been to Scoops in LA, those flavors are crazy (I had roasted rice white wine and it had a smoky taste to it, crazy stuff). I know, I'm not in LA, I'm in SF (not a LA fan btw). I guess I rather spend my 3 bucks on a pint of Ben and Jerry's which imo taste the same once thawed a bit. I tried the salted caramel and didn't like it. I'd give it two stars. I know, you all are thinking, SHE'S NUTS! It tasted a bit burnt, like it's TOO bitter. Their raspberry white chocolate, on the other hand, tasted way better. It's very silky creamy and just the right amount of sweetness. I have also tried strawberry balsamic.. I don't remember raving about it. I think I was a bit disappointed. I guess it must not have been that good (or bad) if I can't even remember it right? Bottom line: I'll come back if I'm in the area (and is feeling ice cream) but I won't take any detours to come back.

YES. GO PLEASE! FOR YOUR OWN WELL-BEING AND LIFE ENJOYMENT. Seriously though, this place is awesome! I got in when there was no line, so maybs my opinion is extra positive. But I also heard an overload of hype about this place from several friends, so I think that balances things out. Well, the salted caramel...duhhh. I'm not stating anything new. But the Honey Lavendar was the best I've had in all these weird-ass experimental-flavored ice cream shops that have been popping up everywhere. Awesome texture. Awesome flavor. Awesome service. Seriously everyone working there was sooo friendly! And seemingly excited to give out samples--I had to wonder if that was really real life...it was.

WHOA!! There was a line in 60 degree weather on a Saturday afternoon. I happened to pass by this place after playing tennis at the mission dolores park. Not sure what the hype was about, I asked a friend, which lead us to come here after dinner. Even then, with us wrapped in our jackets shivering, we stood in line to order ice cream. The staff was really friendly and funny. She found out it was my first time and gave me a bunch of samples to try. I really liked the strawberry balsamic, salted caramel, malted vanilla with peanut brittles, and ricanelas. Their ice cream is smooth and flavorful. I ended up with the coffee toffee and malted vanilla with peanut brittles. I think I have popped my bi rite cherry now!!! Who wants to come with me next time?!?!

How can I put this delicately to all the big Bi-Rite fans? The ice cream is AIGGGGHHHT. I drove my a$$ across the city to try the much talked about ice cream parlor known as Bi-Rite Creamery. I asked the guy behind the counter which is the most popular flavor here and he told me the salted caramel. I tried my first sample of it and it was disappointing. Maybe because I don't like overly sweeten foods but as a big fan of lavender, I opted for that as my first big cup. Honey Lavender was ...not bad...reminiscent of Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous's smooth quality ice creams. ÊI don't think it's worth the drive but a great neighborhood pick me up if you're in the area. Another note, they don't do big wedding ice cream cakes in case you're wondering.

I had great ice cream, I had amazing gelatto (in Italy), and this place can definitely keep up. The lines can get really long but worth the wait. There are two lines, one (shorter usually) for soft serves/bake goods and the other for the ice cream. Also, across the street, there is the grocery store. My favorites: honey lavender, roasted banana, and brown sugar. The salted carmel is good, but can get pretty heavy.

A little update on more of the flavors I've tried. - Ricanelas - cinnamon with Snickerdoodle, AMAZING and my absolute favorite from this place - Earl Grey - delicious, potent, like Earl Grey punched you in the mouth - chocolate coconut - rich chocolate taste, not much coconut, nothing to write home about, good for the chocolate lover - salted caramel - creamy, rich, caramel had that barely, but almost burnt flavor - brown butter pecan - uber rich, felt fatter just from one taste - honey lavendar - like eating flowers

Bi-Rite has some amazing ice cream. Do yourself a favor and get the sundae. Make sure salted caramel is one of the flavors. If you love fudge and toffee, by all means, request these toppings. The berry compote is also delicious. The line is long, but this ice cream is worth it. Eat it there or bring it over to Dolores Park on a beautiful day. Reasonable prices, unique flavors, fantastic quality. Parking can be annoying, though!

For people looking to try Bi-Rite for the first time, don't confuse it with the Bi-Rite market down the street! Great service, the people are so nice about letting you try every flavor! Also, I came on a Friday afternoon and there was NO LINE! (even though the Trans March was going on right next door in Dolores Park.) I loved getting to try all the flavors without feeling rushed. I've heard this is great dessert after a meal at Tartine Bakery. The ice cream melted a bit fast for my liking on a moderately sunny day, but otherwise I loved it! The price was also totally acceptable

Super tasty ice cream! Ordered the banana sundae with almond ice cream and malted vanilla. The malted vanilla had delicious bits of peanut brittle mixed in. The almond ice cream was my favorite! The banana had caramelized sugar on it. So delicious. Salted caramel was overrated, whipped cream was bland, fudge had no flavor. Nuts added a delightful crunch.

I'm in love with Bi-Rite, which pairs fantastic flavor with great service. Line up once for the experience. Didn't think a scoop of ice cream (or three) could ever merit such a long line? It's definitely worth the wait, even in the chilly evening San Francisco weather. Parking is difficult on the weekends, so arrive early! They always switch up their flavors, so skip the classics and go for a flavor you wouldn't normally try! I promise you'll be surprised. So far I love the balsamic strawberry, earl grey, honey lavender, olive oil and pumpkin. I'm usually a big sorbet fan, but in Bi-Rite's case I like the cream flavors better. Not too sweet, with just the right amount of creaminess that makes you crave another bite. It's possible to walk in and buy a take-home pint/quart if you don't want to wait in line. A dangerous choice of purchase, I tell you!

The ice cream here is great. My cousin and I got here early in the morning to beat the crowd. The salted caramel is good but a bit sweet for me. The honey lavender is tasty too but the lavender is a bit odd for me. I love to smell it, but I don't know about eating it. My favorite was the toasted coconut (I love the texture) and the strawberry balsamic. It sounded very odd at first but it's so yummy. I'd like to try the basil and ginger peach next time. I bought a pint of strawberry balsamic for my bf to taste but for $7.99 a pint, it seemed very steep. I can get a half gallon at Mitchell's for $9 and I honestly like Mitchell's better. The ice cream is creamier there, which I prefer and the prices are more reasonable. Nevertheless, Bi-Rite is a nice treat when my budget and waistline allows for it.

The first thing you will probably notice once you arrive at BiRite is the long line of people waiting to place their order. ÊIf you plan to go on a warm San Francisco day (70 degrees or higher) you'll see this line. ÊIf you go on the weekend you'll see this line. ÊThe line moves pretty fast and even if it didn't the ice cream is worth the wait. ÊI think BiRite is famously known for their 'Salted Caramel' ice cream which to the ice cream noobie sounds kind of weird. ÊI'll admit I was skeptical the first time I tried it a few years ago and it even tasted a bit weird the moment it hit my tongue. ÊAfter a few more bites I was hooked. ÊPure goodness. Today I had their "Ricanelas with bits of Snickerdoodle cookies" which was also delicious! Aside from the salted caramel they offer a number of other interesting flavors as well as mainstream staples like chocolate chip and cookies n' cream. ÊThey've got a small seating area inside with a seating capacity of about 10 people and they have benches just outside the creamery for you to enjoy on a warm day. Ê If you are not sure what flavors you want, the service staff behind the counter are more than happy to let you try any flavors you want. ÊJust ask. ÊIf you are really in the mood to indulge, I highly recommend one of their homemade cookies to go along with your ice cream. ÊI really wish they made fresh cones like Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous in the Dogpatch. ÊSince they don't I opt for my ice cream in a cup. Highly recommend BiRite. ÊGreat place to take the family (kids and parents) after a meal in San Francisco.

We went around 10:40 at night and there was a line but it moved fast and was completely worth it.

If you're looking for an imaginative assortment of ice cream flavors with a solid delivery, this is the place. No wonder there was a line circling the block when we first got here! I was craving some mint, so ended up with the mint chip and coffee toffee. IT HIT THE SPOT. Perfect. The coffee was pretty strong, which brought out the sweetness of the toffee even more. The flavors were so organic and fresh! Some other hits among our group were the roasted banana (by far), honey lavender, and salted caramel. Overall, a nice treat on a warm day. And plus, there's a park across the street to lazily sprawl out on and enjoy your ice cream :)

The one with snickerdoodles is yummy too especially for cinnamon lovers. Coffee toffee is another favorite. I did not like their honey lavender because I don't really like floral foods.

I have to admit I was somewhat wary about trying the Salted Caramel. I had just gone to Pinkberry a few weeks before coming here and they offered Salted Caramel froyo... with unfavorable results. But when I finally got a taste of Bi-Rite's --- ice cream heaven. I also had Balsamic Strawberry, which you need not be wary of at all. It has a slightly more savory finish than the conventional strawberry. I also sampled some of my friends' flavors too and they were all delicious. It made me want to line up all over again.

This place is a pretty good small creamery. I guess they make their own ice cream (and even cakes!) After dinner, we struggled to find parking at 7:45pm. We luckily beat the rush, taste tested several flavors (with real metal spoons), and ordered. I got the ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles). I like how there were chunks of snickerdoodles in it, but I realized how sweet this ice cream was when I tried my other friends' ice creams. Honey lavender is pretty good and bland (but not in a bad way). The Coffee Toffee flavor is interesting because it's crunchy with the toffee and kinda bitter with the coffee. The toasted coconut is yummy with coconut strips (: Roasted banana was okay, but wasn't that different from a banana ice cream from elsewhere. The basil, well, tasted like basil. It was interesting, but I didn't want that in my ice cream. The variety of special flavors would be a reason for me to come. But the quality of ice cream is only a little better than other creameries. I still prefer Preston's in Burlingame (:

Oh man I don't know where to start!!! Let's just say I frequent SF via a 6 hour drive mainly for the salted caramel and the Sam's sundae...need I say more? Sam's sundae I would say is definitely an acquired taste but nonetheless a unique blend of epic flavors of complimentary sweet and salty oh so good yumminess! Salted caramel is probably the one item that I would recommend as the must try. The scent and flavor of the caramel is so distinct and super delicious I dream about this in my sleep! I've had many so called homemade ice cream that doesn't come close to bi-rite...bi-rite got it right with the unique blend of flavors, texture, and consistency that has made me journey the pilgrimage just to have this! This will be the best ice cream you will ever taste, bar none! It's done...this will go down in my history as one of the best thing I've ever eaten!

Yes, yes.. Êsalted caramel is awesome and all but I prefer Mr. & Mrs. Miscellaneous better. It does pair well with balsamic strawberry (which itself is slightly more interesting than the Breyer's). I do love their roasted banana and toasted coconut. They truly taste like they were roasted and toasted! Malted vanilla was also good. They have this new flavor olive oil which I find underwhelming. Minuses: tough luck parking, long line and few seating. If you only want pints and quarts to go, you don't have to queue, just ask at the 2nd counter or grab some from the grocery store across the street.

I only came to Bi-Rite creamery to see what the hype was all about. I was intrigued by the idea of an old school ice cream shop selling new school flavors. My favorite? The balsamic strawberry. Not sure where the balsamic flavor is...because all I tasted was some seriously fresh & delicious strawberry! Other flavors are the salted caramel (good but slightly too salty for my taste), coffee toffee (seriously as strong as a cup of joe), creme fraiche, and more Unlike Baskin Robbins or other chain ice cream shops, you can literally taste the freshness and quality of the ingredients. A serious thumbs up for that! Another reason this place rocks is the price! You can get a kids scoop or a single scoop (with up to 2 flavors!) for a little over $2. I'd much rather get my ice cream here than Baskin Robbins at those prices! So glad they don't overcharge! I haven't tried their soft serve, but that's next on the list! Can't wait to come back!

Oh hell yeah!!! Bi-Rite Creamery is A-mazing. The young lady behind the counter was so friendly and helpful. It was a Thursday morning, about 11am to be exact, and the place was empty, which is a rarity. The friendly lady gave us a million samples...maybe I'm exaggerating a little...maybe it was 6, but that's still a lot considering she didn't have to give us any. All of the flavors that we sampled were delicious, which made it really difficult when trying to decide on which kind to get. Rather than purchasing a pre-made pint, I customized mine. I got a blend of honey lavender and salted caramel. What a fantastic blend of sweet, salty, rich, creamy heaven in a pint! My goodness! Bi-Rite has an array of sizes, from a single scoop, to a half pint, to a pint, to some other larger sizes. I can't remember what they're called. It's about $2 more than a pint of haagen dazs from the grocery store, but you're not going to find these flavors anywhere else (that I'm aware of) so it's worth it. Be warned, that unless you go on a weekday morning, expect to stand in a line out the door and a half mile down the block.

You have been warned: there usually is a line around the corner! Balsamic strawberry softserve? Creamy, smooth & not too thick. +1 for no line on the softserve & baked goods line! My boyfriend & I shared a cone w/ honey lavender, roasted banana & peach & ginger. The cone was not soggy - nice & crunchy texture. It served well w/ the ice cream. They also use additional cone layers in between scoops! The ice cream itself was worth the way... Not only did Bi-Rite have unique flavors - they were crazy delicious & they didn't leave that feeling of fattening film over your lips after having such a gluttonous snack. The place itself is cute & I like how they support SF's campaign to recycle & conserve. There's a few sit down tables. Great place overall & friendly staff.

This is definitely my favorite ice cream place in SF. There are so many unique flavors to choose from that are mostly good. I would not recommend getting their soft serve here, because this place is known for their ice cream. Everyone recommend the salted caramel ice cream, which is not a bad choice at all. However, my favorite is their roasted banana ice cream which tastes like fresh bananas, none of this artificial flavor business. This is definitely a great place to go to, just expect to be waiting in a line most of the time.

BEST ICE CREAM EVER. My top 3 flavors Salted Caramel: - salty/savory and sweet - has a "cooked" taste to it - like as if you browned caramel on a pan - such a unique flavor you cannot get anywhere else Coffee Toffee: - STRONG flavor - perfect balance of the bitter tinge of espresso, and the sweetness of ice cream - toffee chunks - crunchy and delicious - does not leave a grainy or bitter after-taste Ricanellas: - its reminds me of a snickerdoodle cookie, but in an ice cream form - excellently smooth - nostalgic taste makes you feel happy inside

Tried both the soft serve and the ice cream. Personally, I prefer the soft serve. My favorite part about the experience was the salted caramel (the caramel, not the ice cream) and the brownie they put in the soft serve. The ice cream was good, but not amazing. I prefer my ice cream to be less heavy. It was far too dense for my tastes. The soft serve was better and I thought the balsamic strawberry had a very unique flavor. Pretty delicious. However, this is an ice cream shop. It has a long wait and I was left underwhelmed by the ice cream. The fact that I prefer the caramel and the brownie over the ice cream is a bit of statement in my mind. I'm probably wrong though, I don't know sweets very well.

My new flavor: Malted Vanilla (which has peanut brittle in it). It taste like a milk shake with heath bar pieces. AMAZING, worth waiting 20 minutes in line...that stretched down the street and around the corner. I decided to be adventurous and I sampled the Basil flavored ice cream, which turns out to be not my cup of tea.

All I have to say is SALTED CARAMEL there toffee coffee is not too shabby either. ÊI walk into this place and immediately gain 10lbs so evil.

Love how I never "plan" on coming to Bi-Rite but, since "I'm in the area," I should go....and by "area," I mean 8 blocks away. They have olive oil flavor now, which my homegirls swear by! This time around I had the brown sugar with ginger and caramel swirl. TO-DIE! Next time, I need to samps their cinnamon with snickerdoodles!

Yum! We stopped here for dessert after brunch at Bar Tartine. Our group ordered the Toasted Coconut, Roasted Banana, Salted Caramel, and Coffee Toffee. We each claimed that ours was the best. I had the Toasted Coconut (surprise, surprise), and it was definitely the best. And it was definitely the best coconut ice cream that I have ever had. Next time I'm up there I want to try honey lavendar, earl grey, olive oil, and/or salted caramel! Don't those all sound amazing? The shop is super cute and the ice cream is to-die-for!

DELICIOUS ice cream - some of the best I've had in SF. I had a small (2 scoops) with coconut and chocolate. The coconut had bits of coconut in it and the chocolate was rich and creamy. There was a line around the corner, but it moved quickly and was definitely worth it. Highly recommend this, especially on a hot day at Dolores Park!

When I moved here from Atlanta, I was sad that I would no longer get to enjoy the delicious salted caramel ice cream at Morelli's. Well guess what? Bi-Rite puts Morelli's TO SHAME. The salted caramel here is my favorite, along with what seems like half of San Francisco. It's sweet, savory, and just salted enough without feeling like a fake flavor. The line can sometimes be a bit extreme, so if you get here early enough, just walk across the street to the Bi-Rite grocery and buy a pint. Grab a couple of spoons, a blanket, and head to Dolores Park. Quintessential SF. Pro Tip: Make sure to get a punch card. I've managed to fill mine up and get a free ice cream within the first couple of months of living here. Good for my wallet, not so good for my waistline.

Great ice cream but the place is almost too popular. ÊI usually go with the salted caramel (#35 on the 2012 SF Big Eat in 7x7 Magazine) but there are dozens of delicious and exotic flavors - worth the cash as long as the line is under 20 people.

Coffee Sundae -- the best part was the toffee. The salted caramel is as good as everyone says it is. The honey lavender must be an acquired taste because the sample I tasted reminded me of watered down green tea latte.

Holy Crap...this place is addicting! ÊI definitely do not need to live near here because no matter how long the line is behind that red velvet rope, I seem to find myself standing in it with the masses to get my hands on possibly the best ice cream on this planet. The ice cream isn't just good...it's AMAZING. ÊSeriously it's the stuff that makes babies and cures cancer...truly life changing. ÊMy favorite is the Salted Caramel. ÊI like to switch it up sometimes and mix it with a scoop of Chocolate or maybe add a fresh baked chocolate chip cookie. Ê I hear some of the other flavors are good, but once I have a favorite...it's difficult for me to try something else.

I LOVE their Honey Lavender. Every time I come to SF I have to stop by here to get some. I usually get about 3-4 flavors at a time but nothing every comes close to my love for their Honey Lavender. It's got such a sweet and calming aroma. There's always a line but I've never had to wait more than 15-20 minutes to get my ice cream. The workers are mad cool too. The cool thing is that the Creamery is right across the street from the park so you and your buddies can walk over and enjoy the people watching while licking away your sorrows with the yumminess that is Bi-Rite. Parking is of course a bitch but not impossible to find if you drive through the residential streets. Just be sure to come with a friend who is comfortable parallel parking.

I'm not really a big fan of ice cream or sweets in general, but goodness... the stuff they make here at this family-owned & operated little creamery is deliciiouuuussss. I got the mango-coconut-pineapple sorbet and the balsalmic strawberry double scoop in a cone. Definitely one of the better choices I made that day. haha. So good. :) If you come during a hot day, expect to be waiting in a line. It usually goes pretty quickly, especially if not everyone is sampling every flavor they've got. (Although, you can't really blame them.) My friends were joking that if you mixed some of the flavors like the Balsalmic Strawberry and the Basil flavor and the Olive Oil flavor, maybe your ice cream would taste just like a salad. haha. I've got to try that olive oil flavor one day though. p.s. the sweet scents and aromas of cookies and cream will hit you once you walk in. yeah. be prepared to spend monies. haha. (they accept credit cards! sweet!) (my double scoop with a cone cost a little under $5)

So I found out about Bi-Rite thru my sister about 2 months ago. There was a quart of salty caramel in the freezer and gave it try. I'm not a huge ice cream fan to begin with but after trying the salty caramel ice cream I was hooked. Now every time I drive into the city, I try to make a quick stop at Bi-Rite to stock up on my favorite flavors and race back to the east bay to get all that yummy goodness into the freezer. Last time I was here was this past Sunday, spent $45.60 on ice cream alone. I bought 2 quarts of the salty caramel and a pint of the toasted coconut and Honey Lavender. All worth it and never had to wait in line when purchasing quart and pint sizes. YUM!

Thank you, 7x7 for putting Bi-Rite on your list! Now I understand why everybody adores this place! I'm definitely a fan, BUT not that ridiculous line. I cheat and instead of waiting, bf drops me off while he circles around the block, I go in the smaller store, aka the 'to-go' section and buy the ice cream in pints. It took literally, 2 minutes to stand in line and order my delectable ice cream. Genius. I'd rather pay a little more for pints of ice cream than stand in that awful line. I love the Salted Caramel and Roasted Banana flavor! I can't wait to try the Honey Lavender!

I recently went up to the Bay for a 48-hour Yelp-driven food escapade with Cameron W., and Bi-Rite was the top priority on our list of places to try. I knew before we even started driving over that it would never live up to my insanely high expectations, and I was right. I was not particularly impressed. I prefer Scoops in Los Angeles for reasons that I'll identify in a bit. That said, Bi-Rite is pretty damn good for an ice cream parlour, and I can see why ice cream connoisseurs like it. The trip there was probably one of the most stressful moments of my weekend. We went on a cold, windy, rainy afternoon, and a couple circles around the block were enough to help me grasp the severity of the street parking deficit in the Mission. After about half an hour driving around the area with increasing desperation, we nabbed a spot a few blocks away. By the time we got in line (yes, there was still a line, wtf?) it had started pouring, so we didn't have to wait long. I sampled the blood orange sorbet and some sort of pecan, neither of which was very memorable. The texture was too creamy, and the flavours had no subtlety at all. They were all just mashed together. I ended up getting the honey lavender and the roasted banana per everyone's recommendations. The honey lavender was a little too fragrant for me, but the roasted banana was great. I tried the salted caramel too, which was more of a miss than a hit for me. It had a nice touch of smokiness to it, but there was just too much going on for me to really enjoy it. I'm definitely more of a gelato person -- I prefer Scoops' lighter, subtle flavours to Bi-Rite's more heavy-handed approach.

I know, I'm probably dragging down the whole average by giving them a three- oh wait- I'm the 99999999th person to review this place- no average disruption here! I ordered a sundae ($6.50) with salted caramel and malted vanilla ice cream, caramel topping, and toffee pieces. ÊThe garbage disposal boyfriend also got a sundae, but with cookies and cream, salted caramel, berry compote, and brownies. ÊHis was faaaar better than mine. ÊI really liked the malted vanilla, but the salted caramel wasn't that good. ÊI was wishing I got something else- but the salted caramel is like their "claim to fame" so I don't know what else I could have done! Ê My rating doesn't even take into account the wait (~25-30 minutes) because of course you will have to wait forever on Easter at Bi-rite. ÊNor does my review take into account the price- top quality organic ingredients aren't cheap, and I expect to pay for them. ÊIf I wanted cheap, I'd inhale some high fructose corn syrup at McDonald's. ÊJust kidding, I'd never do that- HFCS is pretty much the devil.

The 4000+ other reviews say it all! A few words of wisdom when coming here... Skip the sometimes ridiculously long lines and head to the freezer inside and grab yourself a pint (or larger) of salted caramel, grab a spoon, pay, and walk over to Delores Park and dig on in. So yea, it's a bit pricey, perhaps a bit gluttonous, but so. darn. good. If you do plan to wait in line for a sundae or something freshly scooped, give Sam's Sundae a whirl. Truly decadent and rich chocolate ice cream, a bright and fruit olive oil, and sea salt are a unique and utterly perfect combination. Oh and the whipped cream is freshly whipped as well. As I write this it is 70 degrees out and what better way to spend an afternoon that with a tub of ice cream in my lap.

Definitely love braving the lines to this place. I mean, it moves, and by the time you get in the door you have some idea of what you want right? Perhaps, but a taste of something here or there will likely change your mind. My recent favorite? Brown Butter Pecan and Roasted Banana. The Ricanelas I tasted was amazing too... but I didnt get enough scoops to want it as a third flavor... yet it's highly recommended. They also sell caramel and other jarred goods made by them that go beautifully with their ice cream (or, if you must, someone elses). Tip: if it's your first time, and you're in line, ask almost someone on either side of you; chances are one of them has been there before and has a recommendation.

Arriving at late afternoon (4:30), I was happy to find that the line was pretty short (and moving very quickly/efficiently). I had read about the wonders of salted caramel so I drooling as the line inched forward. Luckily, they had menus that were passed down the line to help you decide just what crazy combo of flavors you wanted. You could pick two flavors for a single school, or three flavors for a double scoop. Naturally, being the ice cream fanatic I am, I went with the double, picking honey lavender, salted caramel (of course), and brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl as my flavors of choice. My boyfriend went with a single school of salted caramel and malted vanilla and his best friend chose a single scoop of salted caramel and coffee. After paying for our ice cream (which was, I think, a little over priced), we sat on the benches they had outside and enjoyed our treats... Salted caramel: not nearly as tasty as I expected - maybe my expectations were too high but it didn't blow my mind as I expected. It tasted a bit too salty and "burnt" for my taste. Honey Lavender: Good, tasted kind of like camomile tea, but I kind of got sick of that herb-y flavor after a while. Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl: MIND BLOWN - so much more delicious than I expected (I had picked it randomly since I couldn't find a 3rd flavor I really wanted but I refused to settle for just two flavors). It was just the right amount of sweet (not too intensely sugary) and the ginger flavor was subtle and perfectly complemented by the smooth caramel. I also got to try the flavors the boys got: Coffee: Tastes like coffee - nothing spectacular. Malted Vanilla: Surprisingly good, woud be great for a person who wants a simple flavor (nothing too "exotic") but doesn't want to sacrifice delicious flavors. Its a very nice, creamy, rich vanilla flavor. All in all, this was some yummy ice cream, some of the best I've had (and I'm quite the ice cream connoisseur), but it didn't live up to its sky-high expectations for me.

How have I not written a review about this place already?! Everyone keeps raving about the salted caramel, but my absolute favorite is the ricanelas: cinnamon ice cream with little bits of snickerdoodle. It kind of reminds me of horchata! Don't let the long line deter you...it's so so worth it! The place is tiny and there's only a few stools to sit, so I'd suggest bringing your ice cream over to Dolores Park and eating it there :)

GOD. 2000+ miles away living the dream in (arguably) the greatest city in the world, and all i can think about it about is a quaint little shop on the corner of 18th & Dolores. Quick tip: If you plan on driving, DON'T. Take BART to 16th & Mission and walk off all the calories you're about to consume. If you really, really have to, drive up 18th st. past Mission High (Dolores Park will be on your left) and turn left onto the first street after the park, that goes uphill. There's usually a couple clutch parking spots...though probably after this review, there won't be. Whoopsies. Second tip: Bring a book or your favorite person or a hot date because if you go during the best time to go (a warm weekend), there will be a line down to Chinatown. Not really. Just tried to make it rhyme but I'm failing. Not gonna lie...just trying to get to Elite here. No time to be funny or clever. I sound like a douchebag. Third tip: I will swear by Honey Lavender until the day I die (probably from eating too much Honey Lavender), but 9/10 people don't like it because they're lame-os. Okay, so it tastes like potpurri. But tasty potpurri!!!! If you don't like the tasty of creamy soap in your mouth, go for the Ricanelas. It is a cinnamon sugar blend with real chunks of soft Snickerdoodle cookies. Other popular flavors are Roasted Banana, Earl Grey, and Salted Caramel. Fourth tip: Savor the moment, but eat it quickly. Since the ingredients are all-natural, the ice cream melts pretty quickly Fifth tip: Hang out at Dolores Park for one of the best views of SF and prime SF people-watching. Last time I was there, I carefully eye-stalked a pink poodle, two druggies (one of which temptingly offered a massage in exchange for some maryjane), a guy playing congo drums, two hot guys that I was praying to Madonna wasn't gay, but of course I was wrong, and about fifty crushed cans of PBR (an SF staple if there was one). Sixth tip: Eat, lick, slurp, and be merry.

I know every kid growing up has always wanted to eat ice cream for breakfast, except for me! Ê Yesterday however, since I wanted to beat any possible line for Bi-Rite and have been craving sweets so bad, bf & I had ice cream for breakfast right when they opened! ÊThey guy helping us was really nice and gave us a few samples with big spoons, no typical sample spoons here! I got the single size cup ($3.25) with a scoop of Ricanelas & their ever so popular Salted Caramel. ÊHe made his own Sundae ($6.50) with Cookies N Cream with fudge & brownie toppings. ÊThe Ricanelas was good the cinnamon and snicker doodle flavor was a little subtle. ÊThe Salted Caramel we loved! ÊCaramel can usually be too sweet but the salt was the perfect balance for it. ÊI even bought a pint to go! ÊI usually don't go for sundaes, but his was yummy, their brownie pieces are so good! ÊI've also tried their Roasted Banana Ice Cream at Osteria Coppa and loved it's creamy consistency and full on banana flavor. Ê We got lucky with parking a block up after a few circles around, but we all know how difficult parking can be here, so thank goodness I bought my emergency pint of Salted Caramel, when that runs out I'll definitely be back!

The line is always outrageous during peak hours, but believe me, it's worth it. I've tried most of the flavors on the menu and I would say my top 5 are: Honey Lavender, Ricanela, Roasted Banana, Salted Caramel, and Toasted Coconut. I had to list top 5 because honestly... you can't go wrong with any flavor at bi-rite. The ice cream here is just so creamy and fresh, my heart melts with every bite.

Bi-rite is anything but "rite" for my waistline. Dolores Park, the amazingly friendly workers, and the Mission sun just make the hour commute to the shop that much more worth it. Did I mention the amazingly friendly workers? One time, I stuck out my tongue with such great fervor that I knocked off my top scoop of meyer lemon. To my surprise, I had the decency to not lick it off the floor and go back inside -- the lady smiled and whacked on an even bigger scoop for me! The best, BEST flavor would have to be earl grey -- too bad it's seasonal. Honey lavender, meyer lemon, ricanelas, green tea, and salted caramel are must-trys.

Thanks to Anthony N's recommendation, I finally was able to try Bi-Rite. ÊWas in the city to pick up some goodies to take back home and made it a point to swing on by. ÊLet me start by saying that I hate parking here. ÊI circled around for a good 20 minutes before finding a spot. ÊEach time I spotted someone leaving, there was someone that snagged the spot within seconds before I could turn on my blinker. ÊHowever, in the end I was able to score a spot 10 yards from the front of the entrance (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É). ÊBi-Rite has seating both inside and out for their patrons. ÊAll of the tables were filled inside and luckily it was warm enough to enjoy their ice cream outside. Ê Only a few people in front (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É) which gave me time to figure out what flavors I wanted to try (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É). In the end, we ordered several flavors to try (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É): Roasted banana Earl grey Honey lavender Salted caramel Ricanelas Malted vanilla w/ peanut brillte and milk chocolate All were tasty and wished I was able to bring some home. ÊNext time I'll find some dry ice so that I can savour their ice cream down in Socal.

I just had to come back after dreaming night after night about the Ricanela flavor (snickerdoodle in cinnamon ice cream). So after spending most of Summerthing craving a cone I dragged my friend there today. The last time I came was on a Sunday, but with the perfect weather and all the festivities around town the line went around the corner. Waiting in line was totally worth it, with music playing and handy menus being passed down the line. I was heartbroken that they didn't have Earl Grey today, but the creme fraiche and honey lavender made up for it. Plus the workers didn't seem fazed at all by the line, our scoops were served and paid for just as quickly as if there were no line at all. The best part was that a taste of my flavors plus a double of brown sugar and cherry chocolate brownie made my friend a believer!

After much hype from a good friend, I finally got to try Bi-Rite during my last visit to SF. I opted for the single with pumpkin and salted caramel. AWESOME is all I can say. The line was long but moved quickly as everyone was just aching to get their ice cream fix. Grab a scoop and go chill at the park across the street and you're good to go. I want some more just writing about it right now.

I actually prefer gelato over ice cream, but there's two flavors that have essentially guaranteed my Bi-Rite lifetime patronage. Salted caramel: 10 stars Meyer lemon: 9 stars Yes, I would give the Creamery 19 stars if I could. But that's it--I'm not rounding up to 20 even for the roasted banana.

Came here at 9pm tonight and the I couldn't believe the line went around the corner! I almost thought my friends took me to a nightclub as a joke but nope it was this place. The line moved quickly which was a pleasant surprise and it gave me plenty of time to agonize over which flavor to get. I ended up getting a triple scoop with 1.coffee toffee =winner 2. Malted Vanilla with peanut brittle=winner 3. Ricanelas:vanilla with cinnamon ice cream and snickerdoodle cookie bits mixed in. =hat trick! Every single flavor in the place is good....seriously addictive and potentially illegal if your dieting.

You know what. I was pretty impressed with all the fans that were here for a Friday night. The line was out the door until it hit the corner of the sidewalk and the intersection of Dolores. Top 3 Flavors 1) Roasted Banana - for some reason I keep wanting to call it Burnt Banana. HAHAHA...It is extremely good, does really taste like a banana, but a little bit more sweeter. ( I usually hate the taste of over riped bananas. UGH!) 2) Ricanelas - cinnamon with snickerdoodles. Damn, this flavor is to die for!!! NOTHING like it. Wow. Wow, wow!!! 3) Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces - I saved this best for last. If you love texture and substance in your food. DAMN! PLEASE do NOT miss out on this flavor!! Not too sweet, not too salty. PERFECTION. I'm happy with the flavors that I chose. For standing in that long line which only took about 15 minutes. I was not gonna walk out that door with just 1 flavor. You know who helped me with the flavors I chose?! SALINA (with the purple hair). I was super impressed with the customer service, my friend & I were not rushed at all. She whipped out those samples & spoons without hesitation after we told her it was our FIRST visit. Great service til the end. The dude even gave me a frequent buyer card thing. Thank you Bi-Rite Creamery for being so kind & so sweeeet!!

SALTEDD CARAMELLL ! After a foodie day in the city, we just had to make a stop at Bi-Rite. One of Sf's Ice Cream Heavens. Their ice cream is so smooth and rich in flavor it leaves you craving more after your first taste. Unanimous opinion, Salted Caramel was our favorite. If you've never been here, you have to try Bi-Rite at least once. And everyone that knows what's up..stop holding up the lines!! - jenn

3.5 stars. I got the salted caramel (a little too sweet / bitter for me) and the honey lavender (I like lavender, but wasn't anything TOO special because the lavender wore off and it was more creamy / vanilla). Would come here again, but wouldn't go out of my way. Want to try something else. They had a sugar cookie flavor (Ricoan...?) that I thought was good when I tasted it. Parking is hard to find.

My fave combo: Salted Caramel & Earl Grey. The best combo ever! The strong flavors of the salted caramel goes perfectly with the refreshing earl grey. Too bad the last two times I went they didn't offer earl grey (total bummers), but instead I paired my salted caramel with the brown sugar ginger (good, but the salted caramel really over powers the brown sugar ginger). I've also paired it with lavender, but after awhile you get kinda sick of it. I just can't stop thinking about the salted caramel and earl grey together. my mouth is salivating just thinking about it. I wish I could get some now!

Rounding out the San Francisco ice cream shop tour for me is Bi-Rite Creamery. ÊFreakin finally! ÊI got a scoop of toasted coconut and a scoop of cookies and cream. ÊBoth were very dense ice cream flavors, almost like a gelato. Ê The toasted coconut is like a dream come true for me, because I love adding toasted coconut to my plain vanilla ice cream at home. ÊI felt like I was in Hawaii livin' it up by the beach. The cookies and cream flavor is nothing to write home about, but that's probably because my palette was overwhelmed by the delicious coconut that I tried first. ÊConsider it your 'safe' ice cream flavor. Ê I can understand now why I have to fight for parking and stand in line outside of the shop just to order. Bi-Rite or Humphrey Slocombe or Mitchell's? ÊHell it's ice cream so I like all of them!

Nothing bad to say about this place. The ice cream is super premium, so it melts quickly. No big deal though...I took two courts home to San Mateo, so the ice cream survived a 10 minute walk to the Bart, 20 minute ride to the San Mateo Bart, and 15 minute cab drive home. Riconelas is probably my favorite. It's cinnamon flavored ice cream with chunks of chewy, yummy goodness aka snickerdoodle cookies. If you know what you want, and you want to order more than a cup, call in ahead of time so you can avoid the line. Make sure to get a stamp card too. I'm sure you'll be back! Ice cream cookies are great too, and there's usually no line at the soft serve/bakery area. I had the strawberry ice cream wedged between two sugar cookies. The strawberry ice cream was phenomenal. Though it is Balsamic Strawberry, you cannot taste the balsamic vinegar. They use the vinegar when cooking the strawberries, so it mainly burns off, and leaves this tangy hint with the extremely sweet flavor of the strawberries. It's wonderful!

I'm probably the only one in San Francisco who has never been here before. ÊI'm probably the only one in all of the Bay Area who has never been here. ÊYes I'm ashamed. ÊEven my baby has been here before me. It's wildly popular and a bit pricey for ice cream. ÊBut when you're craving it, you just get it and shut your mouth and take a bite. Ê I sent my husband on a hunt for ice cream since he was in the neighborhood and boy am I glad he went. ÊHe got the salted caramel pint to bring home to the wifey. ÊWe strategically ate the ice cream so that it would last forever - meaning two tablespoons a day per person and that was it. ÊHe finally gave in. Ê"I can't take it anymore! ÊI need more than two spoons! ÊI gotta have it!" ÊFine. ÊPint gone. Somehow for Valentine's Day, my husband snuck over there and secretly hid two pints of ice cream in our freezer at home, another salted caramel and honey lavender. ÊMind you, I don't cook and obviously didn't look in the freezer. ÊHe hid those pints under a pile o' frozen food in the freezer for a whole week before he had to show me where it was. ÊMmm... salted caramel... mmm... honey lavender. ÊNow, he hated the honey lavender because he said it just tasted like potpourri. ÊI actually really liked it. This time, I let him dive right in. ÊOkay, 3 bites per day. ÊDeal. I still have yet to come here and I even earned a free gift card to go here so now it's a MUST GO. ÊI will also learn from my friend's mistake and avoid a $400 Bi-Rite ice cream trip and not get my car towed when desperate for the good stuff.

This place is not expensive. In fact, for the lowest tier price, you can get two flavors :) The servers are also not stingy about trying out their flavors at all. They handed me lots of samples on metal spoons that they later washed themselves. Love the green-ness of it all. In conclusion... this is just a place you have to try for yourself! Yes, you do have to wait in a line outside as though you are trying to get into an exclusive nightclub. But the flavors are really interesting and delicious, the texture of the ice cream is thick and creamy, and the prices are decent. If you like ice cream, there is no reason for you not to come here and try it :)

With 3,000+ shining reviews on its back, there's really not much to be said from me in this dinky little review box at this point, in terms of any tips or experiences that stand out amongst the rest. So, in an attempt to be succinct (for once. I know, I know): - They DO take card here, which is glorious in the Mission. - Try as many samples as you can. What makes Bi-Rite stand out amongst any other ice cream shoppe are its unique, richly crafted flavors and textures. (Salted caramel, roasted banana, and the white chocolate w/raspberry swirl are some of my favorites. Honey lavender is a big hit for my friends, so try that if you're a lavender fan.) - Don't fret if you see the/a line. It moves fairly quickly. The workers know what's up. I mean . . . they work at Bi-Rite. - If you happen to be wandering the area, hanging out at Dolores Park or just in the Mission in general on a rare, warm San Francisco day, this place is NECESSARY (but also, refer back to the third point). Lastly, it is totally moot that/if you're not an ice cream fan. This isn't ice cream, it's Bi-Rite. Love.

Stood in the line for close to 45 minutes. That alone would have annoyed me but it was nice and sunny and I had basked in Dolores park for a few hours so I was in no hurry as such. I tried the salted caramel and the almond fudge while the hubby tried orange cardamom, malted vanilla and brown sugar. Of course I got to taste! The salted caramel was nice but nothing spectacular.

There are places that you like, and then there are places that you LOVE... And Bi-Rite--I LOVE! Everyone likes ice cream right? From the stuff you get in the supermarkets or the ice cream man, to the stuff you get from ice cream parlors/shops... But until you've experienced Bi-Rite, you haven't really experienced the real thing. It's like waking up from a really long & foggy dream, like the light at the end of the tunnel, the caviar of all ice creams. Bi-Rite has the BEST flavors that ice cream has to offer. Coffee toffee, salted caramel, honey lavender, thin mint... They put a creative twist on "regular flavors," meanwhile completely staying faithful to the TRUE taste of the flavors. EXAMPLE(s): Eating their coffee toffee ice cream is like having the BEST coffee put into a scoop and plopped onto a (sugar) cone. The bits of toffee adds extra crunch and flavor--it isn't overpowering and it's just in total harmony with the coffee. The mint chip is PERFECT--they don't use the cheap green artificial coloring, just real mint flavor with lots of chocolate shaving chips.. Thin enough to melt in your mouth, and big enough to be able to taste. Honey lavender is exactly its description. You get the flavor and aroma of lavender with the sweetness of honey. YUM. Bi-Rite is small, and very quaint. There are about 3-4 small wood tables inside, and a few on the outside. Be prepared for about a ten minute wait... They have stamp cards (awesome!) There is NO BETTER than Bi-Rite. Definitely my favorite ice cream, ever.

My friend and I came here after exploring Dolores Park. Bi-Rite is right down the street from the park and yay there was no line! To my delight, Earl Grey was one of their flavors that day and I've always wanted to try Earl Grey ice cream after hearing my room mate rave about how good that flavor is at Ici's in Berkeley. I got two scoops of Earl Grey while my friend got ginger and orange nutmeg (?). I LOVED the Earl Grey and the ginger. Personally, I can't tell the difference between the ice cream at Bi-Rite and at Ici's. They're both delicious! I'll definitely be back when I'm in that area again.

It is a beautiful sunny day in SF, warm and just a bit breezy. After spending nearly half an hour looking for parking, I walk up to Bi-rite and see that a line has formed. Lucky for me, it moves quickly. The workers inside are very friendly and let me take 4 flavor samples. I ordered a double (3 flavors) in a cup for $4.75. I got my hands on some Salted Caramel, Ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles), and Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle. One of workers gave me a cone on top, which made me an even happier camper. Can't name a favorite flavor yet, since I only tried 3. I loved the peanut brittle bits in the smooth and creamy Malted Vanilla. I equally loved the cinnamony flavor and the chewy snickerdoodle chunks in the Ricanelas. I did like the Salted Caramel, but after eating half of that scoop, the saltiness became too strong for me. I guess I'm not much of a savory eater. I also noticed that the Salted Caramel softens quicker than the other flavors that I got. And attention all people who like unique flavors! I saw that they had Olive Oil and Basil! They told me that the two would fair well as a combo.

Honestly, I hate ice cream. I hate the thought of stuffing unnecessary processed junk and fat in my body (I'm completely full of shit, don't take me seriously)... BUT, I will cross OCEANS for Bi-Rite ice cream! ÊHere is some food for thought. Look at the contents of Ben & Jerry's ice cream: Cream, Skim Milk, Liquid Sugar (Sugar, Water), Water, Cherries, Sugar, Egg Yolks, Coconut Oil, Cocoa (Processed With Alkali), Cocoa, Fruit And Vegetable Concentrates (Color), Guar Gum, Natural Flavor, Lemon Juice Concentrate, Butteroil, Carrageenan, Soy Lecithin. Now look at the contents of Bi-Rite ice cream: organic malt powder, vanilla bean, salt, peanuts, organic tapioca syrup, organic sugar, butter, baking soda, milk chocolate, organic cream, organic milk, organic eggs. So it's not that much better, but I love that if I do choose to consume ice cream and similar junk, that I am at least consuming "sustainable, local, and organic" products withholding artificial ingredients. Now onto the important pieces: the flavors, the staff, and the wait- Flavors: Please note, I love anything that makes a crunchy sound. Especially with nuts. With that said, the Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces, receives my highest recommendation. Throw in coffee toffee and Earl Grey, the three flavors make Êthe perfect combination. Coffee toffee contributes to the crunchy noise I appreciate so much, while Earl Grey brings back nostalgic memories of tea time with my mother. Staff: Bi-rite has a phenomenal staff. Each time I've visited (a lot), I can truly say that I have not encountered a single grouchy face in sight. This is especially refreshing to me, considering they're dealing with literally, swarms of people per second. I also love that they encourage me to try new flavors. The wait: First of all, don't be one of those impatient people who complain and moan about waiting in line. Yes, no shit, the line is long, but there's a reason and it's worth it.

Without the line this place would easily be a 5 star ice cream shoppe. ÊBi-Rite does it right and their flavors are incredible. ÊSimple and unique ice creams tantalize every sensation making you want more. ÊGet a sundae and it's large enough to share... but you wont want to. Êyou've been warned. the latest craze is the coffee toffee ice cream. ÊCheck it out.

Yum... Bi-Rite. ÊMy first time here the other day and I had some good ice cream! ÊI got Vanilla an the Toffee Coffee one. ÊI was surprised that this ice cream is not as sweet as other ice creams. ÊMy go-to ice cream in general is cookies and cream and they did not have any this day! ÊBoo.. Anyhow, when we got there there was a line around the corner. ÊThe line wasn't that long since Bi-Rite is near the corner. ÊMy friends waiting in line while I waited the same amount of time to go use the bathroom. ÊSigh, I really wish some establishments had two bathrooms.

Ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles) is where it is AT. Honestly crap that is good. I thought the salted caramel was good, but not fantastic. Granted, I was spoiled by delish caramello al sale gelato in Italy for 3 years, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. I also am a huge fan of cookies and cream and Bi-Rite NAILED it. Yum. Yum.

My boyfriend had tried this place without me (the cad!) and kept pushing for us to go together. ÊWe were THISCLOSE to actually going once this summer while we were in the City, but it was probably about 11 o'clock at night and there was a line a block-and-a-half long and we couldn't find a parking spot within a 3-block radius, so...NO. Bi-Rite was finally able to fit me into its jam-packed social events calendar for the first time last night after I had dinner at Picaro and before I had drinks at Cassanova (I thank the rain for keeping 99% of the fans at home, but true fans still made it to this frozen dairy mecca). ÊI tried a tasting of the honey lavender, but it was a little too Victoria's-Secret-scented-candle for me. ÊI ended up going for their recommendation ("great combo!") of the roasted banana and toasted coconut, while the bf-unit got the malted vanilla and Ritual coffee toffee. ÊBomb diggity! ÊI know nobody says "bomb diggity" anymore (wait, did anyone ever?), but I know no other words to describe what I ate. ÊI love coconut, but the toasted coconut ice cream made me want to take it behind the middle school and get it pregnant (a buck to you if you get the reference). ÊAnd banana ice cream? ÊBanana is one of my favorite fruit, and now I can get it in ice cream format. I think my taste buds were invigorated by last night's Bi-Rite experience. ÊI woke up today, and my toothpaste tasted mintier, and my open-faced breakfast sandwich tasted more cheesy and eggy and whole-wheaty. After we had already paid, my bf said I should ask for a sample of the salted caramel because it's supposed to be The Shit. ÊThe guy behind the countner grabbed an ice cream SCOOPER and scooped me a scoop of the salted caramel and put it on top of my cone. ÊWHAT?! ÊBAM! Ê5 stars. ÊMay the force be with you. ÊLive long and prosper.

Salted Caramel. If you have cousins saying they wish they had ice cream for lunch only, you know you have a homerun. Don't get chocolate coconut. I didn't try it because I don't like coconut, but everyone with me that got it said it was bad. Ricanellas was awesome. I have never had snicker doodle but I felt I knew exactly what it should taste like after I had this. Brown sugar was also really good and tasted similar to salted caramel but sweeter and with more texture. The sitting area is really small but cute and intimate. I will definitely come back here because their flavors here look insane but together, they made taste perfection.

I came here on a Monday night, hoping there won't be a crazy long line like there is on the weekends. And I was in luck, there were only about 6 people ahead of us. The flavors here are very creative and unique, not your typical ice cream shop. The best part is that they continue to create new ingredients, which keeps it interesting. I had the roasted banana and brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl. It was good, but too sweet. Creamy, but nothing out of the ordinary. Flavors were on key though. I would come back if I was around the area and if the line doesn't extend around the block. Not my favorite, but still pretty good.

Amazing ice cream. I recommend the salted caramel soft serve. It is very inexpensive, considering how good quality it is. They do make-your-own sundae bars for parties, which I think is awesome. I went to a bar mitzvah and made a Bi-Rite sundae -- It was the best sundae I ever had! The only problem with this place is that there can be long lines sometimes. But I guess that just shows how good the place is!

Bi rite is tasty! The line can get ridiculous for a reason. ÊThe stuff here is quite impressive! Êvery reminiscent of Molly Moon's or Blue bird here in Seattle.

Jeezus. ÊSO good. Ê Since I'm not a fan of crazy ass lines (see my Ike's review), I've put off going to Bi-Rite for a very long time. ÊHowever, hubs and I finally had a random weekday off work, so we went at about 2:30ish, and only had a 5 minute line. I got Ricaneles (cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodle cookies) and salted caramel...hubs got toasted coconut and brown butter pecan. ÊAll four flavors were phenomenal, but I will say that if you are trying multiple flavors and one of them is salted caramel, save that one for last...it's a pretty strong flavor and can take away from more subtle flavors like the toasted coconut. I still dream about Bi-Rite, and the next weekday I have off work so I can go back sans line....

This is a nice ice cream shop that packs an amazingly power punch of flavor and texture to their ice cream. I came here already doing my research of the place.

KAZAAAAM! introducing my new favorite ICE CREAM place of all time! BI- RITE! hahah! yes it was that good.

I don't have a sweet tooth but I love ice cream. The line here is always horrendously long on the weekends so I decided to go on a random weekday in the afternoon when there was no line. I heard the salted caramel is amazing and requested for a sample. But since I don't have a strong sweet tooth, I thought the salted caramel was a bit too sweet for me. I settled with a scoop of the honey lavender and a scoop of the cookies and cream. The combination was delicious. The honey lavender provided a very refreshing contrast to the more rich cookies and cream. The ice cream is delicious here, but I wouldn't say it's worth standing in line for more than an hour.

I had to try this place after the reputation it earned to be on yahoo's top ice cream shops. I tried the strawberry balsamic ice cream and it tasted like a watered down strawberry ice cream. How does ice cream taste more like water??? Maybe I had a poorly made batch that day. I also had bought an ice cream cake. I believe it was something with peanut brittle. The brittle had a burnt taste to it and the ice cream was not creamy at all. The bread was very dry and the only moistness it had was when the ice cream melted on it. All in all I wish I was impressed, but sad to say I wasn't. I had to give it stars because although I wasn't a fan, there was a line out the door and other people seem to like it so they have to get some credit right? Also the staff was helpful.

I'm not big on sweets, but when there's so much rave about anywhere or anything, I have to hop on the bandwagon and try. Finally tried Bi-Rite a few days ago while making a trip to Dolores Park on this year's official start of warm weather season (or so it feels like). The ice cream is just as good as the reviews reflect. I tried the Honey Lavender since there seemed to be so many good reviews about it, and also the Almond Fudge Swirl, since I love anything Almond flavored. The Honey Lavender was really good, but I think I rather be smelling that flavor than tasting it. The Almond Fudge Swirl was absolutely delicious - loved the Almond flavor and the Fudge swirled in was a great compliment and sidekick to it. Yes, the flavors are wonderful, but what makes the ice cream here go above and beyond others is the texture and flavor of the ice cream itself - full flavored, creamy, delicious. I am definitely coming back - gotta take friends here, and it's a great spot to stop by, grab ice cream and go hang out at the park.

I rarely give 5 stars as it requires at least three trips and that the establishment is so good that it gets me to swear like a sailor on shore leave getting his kicks like it's his first time. ÊThe line around corner sucks. ÊThe trek across the bay sucks. ÊThe frequent trips to the potty afterwards because I'm kind of Êlactose intolerant sucks. ÊBut what can I say? It's all worth it. That's true love, baby. Ê The creaminess is not that much more outstanding than, let's say Tucker's in Alameda or Mitchell's in SF, but the flavors are unique and out of this world! ÊTake the salted caramel for example. ÊYou can really taste the burnt sugar that defines what caramel is while the salt adds just enough complexity to the buttery flavor of the caramel. ÊAnd, who would have thought of ROASTED banana ice cream?! Clear taste of bananas with a hint of smokiness from caramelized sugars that come with roasted bananas. Nice staff, super clean space, nearness to Dolores Park (if you want to lick and stroll) just add to what makes this place stand out among the rest. ÊWhere else do you see people huddle in the cold, foggy, SF mist (and sometimes rain) for a scope of ice cream? ÊIt's that good. Take heed, it's that addictive.

Came here on a Sunday afternoon, there was a line of course, but it moved pretty quickly. I got a single, with salted caramel & malted vanilla (vanilla w/ peanut brittle). BF got salted caramel & the one w/ the snickerdoodles in it. To me the salted caramel was a bit much.. too salty, not enough sweet. The malted vanilla was good. The ice cream consistancy was very nice, very smooth. I also tasted my friend's Balsamic Strawberry, yum, and honey lavender (eh, I felt like I was eating perfume).

After a night at Off The Grid we headed to Bi-Rite for dessert! I had a slight tummy ache after consuming all the food at OTG so I opted for the orange sorbet. It tasted like frozen orange juice haha. It was still good, though. I normally don't like earl grey tea but I tried a spoonful of my friend's earl grey ice cream and I was shocked that I reeeaaallly liked it! I also tried the honey lavender and was not as delighted.

My favorite ice cream shop! Salted Caramel and Ricanellas all day every day! Ricanellas is a Cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodle cookie pieces within. The ice cream does melt quickly so do eat it fast, but you would anyway since the flavors are different from your ordinary coffee shop. I didn't like the Coffee Toffee since it had a denser coffee taste; I anticipated a Haagen Daz Coffee taste. The prices are decent for the what you receive and I assure you that you will be coming back for more. This is a must go-to place anytime you visit San Francisco! Stop reading about it and go try it! P.S. They also have cool spoons.

oh the hype.. not to mention the LINE.. but what's worse is the parking! B -- S -- Good Luck with parking -- Have fun waiting in line -- Prepackaged pints, etc. are available without waiting in line -- Soft serve window = less wait, soft serve, prepackaged ice cream, baked goods and ice cream sandwiches! -- Interesting & unique flavors -- 2 scoops for $4.95, I guess Parking in this area is pretty much nonexistent because of Bi-Rite, Delfina, oh and Dolores Park! 18th and Dolores is basically packed with patrons and cars. I think it took us about 15 minutes to find a spot and that was a lot of circling, etc. Got in line around the corner and took another 15 minutes. I'm not really complaining about it, just letting you know. Fortunately I wasn't in a rush with the GF. We had just came from a lovely dinner at Bacco, so we were full of delicious Italian food and just wanted something sweet. The staff is pretty efficient, it's the customers like me that want to try stuff that make the wait so long lol. It's interesting they use real spoons for the taste testing and those weird wood plank looking spoons when you get your ice cream. Interesting, cheap and effective! Wood is better than plastic I'd assume on the environment. Our Order: -- Double of Salted Caramel & Coffee Toffee: The salted caramel is such a unique and interesting flavor that you keep eating it! I could taste the creamy caramel but the underlying salty taste is always present but not overwhelming. It's such a strange feeling but in a good way and makes sense why people love it so much. The coffee toffee is not for the faint of heart. The coffee is strong like that jungle coffee and the toffee is a crunchy reminder that you're not drinking just a cup of joe. It wasn't mind blowing, but decent. -- Single of Coffee Toffee & Ricanelas: The ricanelas is such an interesting flavor and ice cream. It's very creamy and sugary and the chunks of snickerdoodle put it over the top. I would say that it's probably one of the best flavors out there if you like that kind of thing. Bi-Rite lived up to the hype, but it's NOT necessary for me. I might want to stop by for a pint or an ice cream sandwich but I'm good off waiting 15 mins for a few small scoops. Nevertheless, I'm a fan of this unique and tasty place!

Salted caramel. Sounded sketchy........... BUT LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!! Cute little place, line out the door but it moves pretty quick. So many different flavors. All of them are good but my favorite is obviously salted caramel. It's nice that it's across the street from the park (don't know the name). So on a nice day, it's nice to get some ice cream & sit on the grass to enjoy. Parking is a factor that determines whether I'm making a trip there or not. But that's just too bad for me.

Being an ice cream lover, my friends brought me to Bi-Rite Creamery on a busy Saturday night. It took about 30 minutes to reach the front, but it was well worth the wait. The ice cream *is* as good as they say! I had the single: coffee toffee and salted caramel. And, yes, because I didn't know when I would be back again (I live an hour away) and because the fudge is homemade *and* because I love fudge, I added hot fudge to my order. One word sums it up: divine. The ice cream is creamy without being too heavy. Even though everything tasted sweet, their own flavor notes came through loud and clear. A must try for everyone. I dare say even for the lactose intolerant!

*heart heart* omg.... Bi-Rite makes my heart sing with joy and my tastebuds dance. I don't care if its pouring out or sunny or late at night, but every chance I get to go into the city, I try to make it out for a scoop of ice cream. Creamy. Rich. Ice cream. Ice cream that's so good that I get excited when I have plans to go... so excited that I'd want to eat the ice cream before dinner. Or even for breakfast. Salted caramel.... toasted coconut.... chocolate... *DROOL* SOOOOO freaking good. I want to get a big vat of it, roll around and smile with glee. Better yet, I want to install a nice freezer unit under my bed, stock if full of ice cream and just reach down and grab it so I can eat in bed. Morning. Day. and Night. I have a sickness.

Hands down the best ice-cream place in all of SF. My favorite is their earl grey ice-cream. Coming in at second is the orange cardamom. The orange is more fragrant than the earl grey, but really tasty. I generally have one scoop of each. Afterwards, my burps feel like a perfume factory. The orange cardamom is pretty fragrant tee hee. I like it. Ê My friend swears by the honey lavender. Lavender is not my thing in general, both in cuisine and in smells. Can't wait to go back and try the roasted banana and salted caramel!

Surprise surprise! I actually came here on a warm day in San Francisco. How lucky of me! I was hanging out at Dolores Park with my girlies and there seemed to be a constant line outside Bi-Rite. When the sun was finally setting, we decided we had to get our ice cream before it got completely dark. And at around 7, there was NO line! Gasp! So I got the single size with honey lavender and balsamic strawberry. They didn't have my first choice which was raspberry somethin' sorbet. They guy wasn't friendly at all, but whatever. It was a nice day and he had to serve an endless line. My two flavors were good! I honestly can't say it's THE BEST THING EVER though.. at least not enough to lure me back for awhile.

I've been here atleast 20 times now. ÊThe lines can be quite scary, but if you are with people you like, it's worth the wait. ÊIf you're on a date with a dud, skip the line, go right into the store, pay for a pint, say bye to your date, and enjoy your pint on your couch in your pjs. Ê My favorite 3: (though you really can't go wrong with any flavor...) Salted caramel: you've got to be in a sweet mood. It's very sweet, and very salty. ÊIt's great to see a place that does salted caramel flavor when you can actually taste the salt! Who would have thought.. Ginger caramel swirl: When you want salted caramel but want it to on a lower flavor profile. ÊFor those who can't take the punch-in-your-face flavor from the salted caramel, I direct them here. ÊThe ginger isn't that strong here so you don't need to be afraid. Vanilla: ÊI was never a vanilla girl till bi-rite. ÊAs my friend has stated, 'you can taste the happy cows'. ÊThe depth of the cream in the taste is so transparent in this flavor, you know why people wait in 30 minute lines for this and not for breyers. Even if you don't like vanilla you've got to try it! Oh, and if you like caramel get the ones that are staring right at you while you're checking out. ÊIt's $2each but it's well worth it. ÊSometimes it's goat and other times it's not.. so watch what type you grab!

We made 3 attempts to go to Bi-Rite Creamery however, on each occasion the line was around the block. People were waiting behind this long red rope- a freakin red rope!!!! I was like wait , is there like a celebrity over there or maybe a club upstairs? This line can't be for ice cream? And it didn't matter what time of the day we passed by cause it was 1st in the evening when it was like 56 degrees and twice in the afternoon. Well, one things for sure the people of San Francisco love their Bi-Rite Creamery!!!!! I gave in and decided to just go to Bi-Rite Market across the street and buy some pints and enjoy some ice cream at home.... OK - I was dissppointed and here's why... --Salted Caramel- Not salty at all - it actually tasted burnt... Maybe I had a bad batch or maybe the icecream gods above decided to punish me for gossiping (Everyone gossips so it can't be that). I don't know what it was but I was so excited to try this flavor..... --Balsamic Strawberry- No Vineagar taste at all...I love vineagar so I thought this would be a little sour but it just tasted like regular strawberry ice cream. Maybe I had a bad batch again- Oh Damn it!!! Maybe I need to go to confession..... On a positive note I did try really good cupcakes from the Bi-Rite Market (see my Bi-Rite Market review)..... I'm not giving up on this place so when I return to SF I will attempt to try them again, I just need to bring a lawn chair....

I love savory-sweet combinations, and Bi-Rite has perfected the art of savory-sweet ice cream flavors. Ê Example 1: Salted Caramel A sweet, toasted, almost burnt caramel taste with a hit of saltiness. Bi-Rite's most famous flavor for a reason! Example 2: Honey Lavender Subtly sweet honey ice cream with the surprising perfumey hint of lavender on the back end. Example 3: Sam's Sundae Chocolate ice cream with bergamot olive oil, maldon sea salt and whipped cream. First, you taste the sweet, rich chocolate ice cream. Then, the savory richness of olive oil. Next, the surprising crunch of salty sea crystals. And lastly, the delicate lightness of whip cream. So many strange flavor profiles at once, but it just works. I feel like I'm combining dinner and dessert in one with this sundae. And for days when I'm craving the ultimate sweet-sweet, I throw Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl into the mix.

Bi-Rite, my love... Not that this place needs any more reviews but... please try their Honey Lavender, Earl Gray, Blood Orange, and Salted Caramel. HOLY MOLY. ÊAll of these are true to flavor... my favorite combination, as suggested by the kind and hip girl working behind the counter, is the Honey Lavender and Blood Orange combo, or Honey Lavender and Earl Gray. ÊThe ice cream consistency is great -- creamy, thick, and dense... just the way real ice cream should be, and they all taste exactly like what they're called. It's magical. On the real though, almost every single flavor offered is superb and unique. Balsamic Strawberry?! Mexican Chocolate with salted peanuts?! Malted Vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate...? Brown Sugar with caramel swirl (*drool*)... and their Mint Chip is naturally color-less (which I love)! ugh, it's disgusting how much I am enamored by Bi-Rite. The line is definitely long but the employees are QUICKWIDIT, plus the ice cream is well WORTH the wait anyhow. ÊIf I lived in SF, I would frequent this place at least once a week and withstand the long line. The place is small and can only seat so many people but there's a huge park across the creamery so tight seating's not a big deal. Overall: 5 stars for service, 5 stars for reasonable prices, 5 stars for great great great ice cream! The only negative thing about Bi-Rite? They don't have MANGO!! It's okay, I still love you so much, Bi-Rite. **If you prefer not to wait, you can get a pre-packed pint of their ice cream at their Bi-Rite market a couple of steps down. **Takes credit card, whee!

I'd heard great things about Bi-Rite so we stopped in for a scoop before heading to Dolores Park for a little sunshine. Great location, well priced, epic creamy, cold, crunchy goodness.

This was stop one of our multi-sunny-day Bay Area ice cream crawl! Friendly, neighborhoody (if that even can mean anything...), cramped but warm space. The staff here was definitely fun and friendly, especially compared to the more constipated-appearing staff at some of the other shee shee ice cream shops (smile other bitches - it's ice cream!). Music was also fun, space is tight, a line is almost certain it seems. They also had lots of options: Tried (samples are given on real metal spoons) - Blood orange sorbet Honey lavender Mint chip Bought - Earl grey Salted caramel I might have liked the earl gray the most. So creamy and really tea flavored. The salted caramel was nice, but not the best of that flavor that I've had - it's at Hot Chocolate in Chicago (what can I say? I've live a charmed, spoiled, multiple salted caramel ice cream eating life.) - but it's obviously still delicious.

After many months of having you in my bookmarks taunting me with your creamy deliciousness, Bi-Rite, we finally meet. You continue to taunt me with your long lines that wrapped around the corner on a beautiful day in the city. I get handed one of the menus and all the flavors sound sublime. I wish I had 3 stomachs so I could try everything. I narrowed it down to two. Salted Caramel and Roasted Banana. But before getting my single scoop with these two flavors though, I was able to sneak in a taste of the cookies n' cream. It was really tasty and almost made me change my order. After getting my ice cream, I sat on the wooden benches outside and dug my little wooden paddle into the salted caramel. Super delicious and bursting with flavor. I can see why so many people order it. I make my way through a bit of the caramel in order to reach the roasted banana scoop underneath and it was awesome as well. Delicious stuff. Will have to come see you again Bi-Rite. Until next time.

Okay. I don't know why it took me so long to try this place out. i mean, i've only lived in this city all my life and strolled through this neighborhood one or more times.... Then came last Saturday afternoon. A couple friends and I were people watching and enjoying our Ike's sandwiches at Dolores Park. If that doesn't sound perfect already, we of course decide to do it big and pop my Bi-Rite cherry when we walked in on it empty and waiting to please us. I was pretty excited, since i've never been (i was raised on Mitchell's! i know...i know...). I didn't really sample much, and decided to get a kiddie size of the salted caramel. .... mmm..mmmmm....MMMMMM!!! Veeeery good!!! The perfect melange of sweet and salty! The consistency was so nice and smooth! And don't let the kiddie size deceive you. That single scoop of goodness is just enough to satisfy your frozen creamy cravings without the brainfreeze or sweetness overdose. I'll definitely be coming back....just thinking... what flavor to try next....

This was high on my list of places we missed last year, so I was rather excited on arriving here. It's doubly exciting because this was to be Ainsley's first taste of ice cream. I started with Roasted Banana. Intense banana flavor, dark brown flavor, and it is just beautiful. It's one note played perfectly. Next was Brown Butter Pecan. I love butter pecan ice cream in general. I've been anticipating what nice dark notes browning the butter might accomplish. I was slightly disappointed on that front: if the butter was browned much before this batch was made, it doesn't appear to change the taste of the ice cream much from what I expected. Still, it's a really good incarnation of butter pecan. Next up, Orange Cardamom. There are floral notes to the orange flavor that pair very nicely with the cardamom, which is fairly understated by comparison. I would absolutely order this again, though, as it's a lovely counterpoint to the fourth flavor, Salted Caramel. The first bite of this flavor had me hooked. It is intensely burned sugar with some surprising and welcome bitter notes. In fact, this is probably the most intense caramel flavor I've had, bar none. Some of that is likely due to the salt, but it's seems mostly intended. That they get a flavor that strong to show up in a frozen dessert is impressive enough, but it showing up in a dairy dessert, which has a tendency to dampen the intensity of most flavors, is absolutely noteworthy. And, although Ainsley clearly enjoyed the banana and orange cardamom flavors, she really seemed to enjoy the caramel. Mom and I agreed.

Party in my mouth! I have never tasted a bad flavor here. My absolute favorites are the salted caramel and honey lavender. I just wish their scoops were bigger because I always want more even after a double scoop, but I don't want to look like a fatty so I limit myself to two scoops per visit. But a double here is a single size elsewhere so keep that in mind. Try out their new flavor, creme fraiche!

Look for a place with a line wrapped around the corner, bubbled out here and there to accommodate the sleeping homeless people along the wall. That's it, that's the one. Bi-Rite Creamery is pretty popular and with good reason. Their ice cream is well worth any trip you made to get it (in the case of my party, practically walking from Fisherman's Wharf). Since the pricing is pretty much 1-2 scoops for the same price, I got Honey Lavender and Ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodle). I couldn't help but savor it slowly enjoying the rich flavors which also seemed to cleanse the palette all at once. Honey Lavender reminded me of warm vanilla lavender cookies and the flavor brought me home. Think Ego's sudden remembrance of being a boy while eating Remy's dish and all of the comfort it brought in "Ratatouille." The taste is simply love.

I liked the texture of the ice cream and how unique it tasted. I liked the vibe from the shop, too. Still, I regret not sampling some other stuff - or at least sampling the salted caramel before we ordered it - because I wasn't crazy about that flavor.

THIS IS SOME CRAZY ICE CREAM!! I tried the honey lavender, the salty caramel, and the roasted banana. The roasted banana was so strong, it was so so flavorful. Not in a bad way, mind you, but if you aren't a banana fan this isn't the ice cream for you. The salty caramel tastes exactly like you would expect it to, as long as you expect it to taste delicious. caramel ice cream with salt in it-standard. Lastly, the honey lavender was FANTASTIC! My favorite flavor, it was the most subtle of the 3 and was such an unexpected combination of tastes. By the way, parking is terrible and I'm assuming there's always a line because I waited a while on a day it was raining. So, prepare your nerves because driving around (and around and around) that block while eccentric ice cream flavors await you is extremely annoying.

Beware: LINE! Another stop to cleanse the palette on my San Francisco road trip, we came here after Ike's Place, which was featured on Man v Food. It is only a few blocks away, making it a perfect spot to go to and it is right across the street from a high school and park. The time we went there was a line just around the corner, which probably took about a half hour. It moves quicker than I thought, so don't be too intimidated. As for flavors, they are known for the salty caramel, which I tried and liked a lot, but I wanted the banana split, and it was a little to pungent for something like that. ÊSo I ended up getting a banana split with vanilla ice cream and a cinnamon snickerdoodle ice cream, which had some weird name, but either way, you'll know it when you see it. ÊIt was a great banana split, you got the fudge, the nuts, the ice cream, the whipped cream. ÊAll the elements of awesomeness.

So, Bi-Rite is definitely one of the most hyped ice cream spots in the city.. BUT, I have no qualms in saying that the hype is absolutely well deserved. Straight up, this is one of the few foods in the world that I can eat and then immediately be in a good mood.. Their ice cream legitimately makes me happy. I guess I'm no ice cream expert, but I have had my fair share of ice cream cones beyond Dreyers from the Safeway freezer aisle.. And, Bi-Rite's unique flavor selection, creamy and flavorful ice creams, and staff (usually) are truly bomb. If anyone visited me here in SF, this would be a destination for sureskees. What I recommend: EARL GREY TEA (do it), Honey Lavender (damnnn), Salted Caramel (a little hyped, but pretty good), Coffee Toffee. Notes: Typically a long line, even at night/when it's cold. Suck it up and wait. Don't park in front from 4pm-6pm M-F because you'll get ticketed... Beeeeen happened to me.. Conclusion: Must go to destination in SF. Even if you end up hating it (which you won't, unless you are an absolute freak), you should say that you tried Bi-Rite Ice Cream.

I am usually not a big fan of ice cream, but this place was so talked about that I had to try it out and I certainly was not disappointed. I liked this place so much that I went there twice in one weekend while visiting San Francisco. It was super hot the first day I went and the line was around the block. This is what I get for coming here the first time at around 3pm; everyone and their mother had the same idea of staying cool with some ice cream. I had to wait almost 30 minutes to get my ice cream, and it was definitely worth it. Salted caramel - excellent toasted sugar flavor. The on the palate taste was smooth and creamy, the after taste was great with lingerings of caramel. Two Thumbs up! Honey lavender - was nice and delicate, but I didn't care for the lavender taste so much. The 2nd time I visited this place was the day after in the morning right after breakfast. Haha, yeah I am crazy. In my defense, I was literally down street Êand I found street parking, so as to not waste it. I walked over to Bi-Rite again, the weather was warming up, really...hehe. Malted vanilla - taste like a vanilla malt shake. It has crushed peanuts and bits of malt in it which makes it even better. I personally would like more peanuts, but still very good. I am torn between salted caramel or malted vanilla. I think I will get them both next time. Do yourself a favor and visit Bi-Rite, especially on a hot summer day. Enjoy!

Oh good mother of god. I don't usually eat ice cream, but holy friggin cow this place is legit. Bi-Rite fires on all cylinders. It's a small creamery that seats only about 10 people, but damn I can definitely see what the hype is about. I ordered the honey lavender and the earl grey. Oh my god, the honey lavender. Probably the best ice cream I've had in recent memory. Not to knock on that earl grey, but damn the honey lavender takes the cake. Super reasonable prices, $3.25 for 2 scoops in a small cup. Not a crazy line, and great service and recommendations from a nice staff. Located right near Dolores park, you can grab your legit ice cream and have a hipster hangout at the park afterwards.

Made my first trip to Bi-Rite yesterday around 5pm, line wrapped around as usual but the wait wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be, considering is was a warm/hot day in the city. Got to the counter in about 15 minutes. Single Scoop for $3.25 (one or two flavors) Malted Vanilla w/ Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate - delicious! not too creamy, loved the slight chewiness from the peanut brittle. great flavor! Chocolate - i love chocolate so of course this was great! I love the idea of passing the menu down throughout the line. Quite an efficient system compared to Mitchell's. I knew what I wanted when I got to the front of the line, which is a plus for me and probably a plus for all the others waiting behind me in line.Also, the line seems to move faster here, and I assume it's because of this menu system. Got lots of love for Mitchell's though. Will be back to try other unique flavors!

There's always a decent wait for Bi-rite but today was an absolutely gorgeous day in sf so the line went around the block. They had their side window open where they serve soft serve and other "treats" and there was no line there so I decided to check it out. I usually just go through the main area, but this little window ended up being a nice surprise. Turns out you can get ice cream sandwiches there! Popsicles too which were cheap! Had two of their ice cream sandwiches: balsamic strawberry with sugar cookies and coffee with brown butter cookies. Balsamic strawberry was solid. Ice cream wasn't overly sweet (the cookies brought the sugar) and the cookies were nice and soft so you didn't get that mega squish factor that usually happens when you take a big bite of an ice cream cookie sandwich. Coffee ice cream was easily some of the best I've had. You could even see the grinds :))). Brown butter cookies were very subtle, but the flavor came out more as you ate along. My advice is to give the side window a try because they had 4 choices of sandwiches and lots of other treats there that looked great.

There isn't much to say that 3500 people haven't already. I'll just present an eating sequence that's worked quite well for me. Go to Ike's and get sandwiches. Walk over to Dolores Park and eat them in the sun. Rest/digest for 15 minutes. Walk to Bi-Rite and have Ice-Cream. Go home and sit on the couch for the rest of the day. Chocolate almond fudge, my dear lord.

You get what you pay for when you buy the best! It's hard to be disappointed with artisan ice cream made in small batches with fresh, local, mostly organic ingredients. You can't get any more San Francisco than that! Yes, people wait in line for this ice cream but smart locals come back later (the line moves fast) or go across the street to Bi-Rite market to get a pint of heaven to take home or share with a friend or two! Their single scoop lets you choose two flavors. A double scoop has three to four flavors and is far too decadent/too much of a good thing for one person, seriously! (Confession of an ice cream lover) My suggestions are my personal faves: Honey lavender started my addiction to Bi-Rite ice cream. Ricanelas is vanilla with cinnamon ice cream and snickerdoodle cookie bits mixed in: YUM! The salted caramel and coffee toffee are to die for, but not for the weak-hearted. They're the most intense flavors offered. The Popsicles are also very delicious; summer time fruits are my favorite flavors. The new soft serve window is a nice alternative; flavors are less intense so if it's your first time, you should try the ice cream to get the full Bi-Rite experience. Everyone that works there is so nice... and patient! When it isn't too busy, you can ask to taste as many flavors as you want =)

My friend dragged me here. He told me that he drove by this area many times. And every time, this place always had a very long line coming out from the store and sometimes the line was so long, it wrapped around the block. One day, he finally had a chance to try it and he loved it ! Ê ÊHe loved it so much that he had to drag me here so I could try it myself Ê(considering that I am a big fan for All Kinds of Dessert) and yes, he was right. The ice cream here is amazing - possibly the best one in town. Ê I tried Roasted Banana, Balsamic Strawberry and Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle (the last one was my favorite).

It is just so damn good. I got lost trying to find this place but then again where do I not get lost?? Anyways, came here with two friends driving in the rain and finding parking with approximate directions haha. We ended up finding the bi-rite market that is like a block away and had to walk to the actual ice cream shop a bit away. Kind of funny really. I got the salted caramel and coffee (i think...) and my friends got like lavender and stuff but we all had to agree it was fab and totally worth enduring the weather. I'll be back someday to try your strange olive oil ice cream thang when I'm back in town!!! *p.s. this is from a winter experience in sf--- so old review*

If I lived closer to Delores Park, I swear I would gain 10 pounds from the daily visits to Bi-Rite Creamery. So it's a good thing that I have to make a drive and that parking can be difficult, which makes the lazy nature overcome my ice cream cravings... maybe. I absolutely LOVE this place. LOVE. The line moves fast, the staff takes care of business, friendly neighborhood and best of all, delicious ice cream!! There are two lines - one for soft serve and pastries and one for the ice cream. You want to get the ice cream. Everyone raves about the Salted Caramel. I tried that and the Malted Vanilla (vanilla with peanut brittle). But I actually got a cone with Cookies n Cream and the Ricanelas (cinnamon and snickerdoodle). What makes BiRite the best is the texture of the ice cream - just the right amount of creamy. I thoroughly thoroughly enjoyed every lick and bite. Coming back? Is that even a question?

This is how I know Bi-Rite Creamery is PERFECT. I brought my friends here citing that this is the place to be in San Francisco. Parking was a slight pain, but hey - no pain, no gain right? Come earlier to plan your time in line and then relax in the park afterwards!! I entered Bi-Rite's LINE and was saddened to see the lack of Earl Grey. No matter... everything is good there! That was my loyal thought, so when I got to the front, I asked to try their Snickerdoodle flavour and Green tea. I couldn't help it. Even though I wanted to try everything else or stick to my favourite Honey Lavendar, I had to go and get the Snickerdoodle/Green tea combination. Strange? Trust me, if you walk out of Bi-Rite with a single scoop, you're doing a great Creamery wrong. Munching on my ice-cream, I quickly scoured my friends' options. Oh my god, brown sugar was heaven in my mouth. I wanted to trade with my friend until I tried the salted caramel and changed my mind again. Then I went back to eating my own ice-cream and felt so satisfied with my decision. Never have I felt so polar with food decisions before. Everything was amazing. See the thing with Bi-Rite is that there is no "right" or "wrong" option. Many restaurants/food places have that unfortunate addition. I used to think that all establishments had their good and bads, but that doesn't exist with Bi-Rite. It is perfect.

You better believe that every time I go to SF, Bi-Rite is on the itinerary. Everyday. Salted Caramel and Roasted Banana are my favorite flavors. I'm usually not a fan of banana flavors in ice cream cause it tastes really artificial to me but, not at Bi-Rite. The salted caramel is not overwhelming at all and I have yet to find any other ice cream shop that can top it. Small selection of flavors but, all so yummy!

Wowsa, I love love love love this place. For my money it has the best ice cream I have ever had. The line can be long, so go prepared. And parking isn't all that fun either, so take the Muni. But their flavors are delicious, and their salted caramel is my favorite ice cream I've ever had. The people that work there are super friendly, and if the line is too long you can always walk 10 feet down the street to their soft-serve window, which also has pastries...including a salted caramel cupcake! My personal choice every time I go is the Sam's Sundae. It normally comes with chocolate ice cream, which is great, but you can have whatever flavor(s) you want in it. Personally I go for Salted Caramel and Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces. The sundae has bergamot olive oil and maldon salt Êthe sweet and salty combinations in this bowl are amazing! The oil is fruity...it's not like dumping olive oil in ice cream. Nothing like that, in fact. It's a green oil that is not actually infused with bergamot citrus, but instead is crushed along with the olives and the juice is centrifuged out. (Bergamot is the lemony fruit that gives Earl Gray its flavor). If you can only go to one place for dessert or a treat in SF, this should be it.

On a moderately warm Sunday afternoon, the line for this place was out the door, along the building and around the corner. Several sources had recommended this place, and I wasn't in any hurry, so I decided to wait. Thank God for smartphones. As I approached the door, the group in front of me passed back a menu. There were plenty of interesting options, but I knew I only had one shot at this, so I decided on the Double (which is actually 2-3 flavors of your choice) and went with Honey Lavender, Toasted Marshmallow, and Balsamic Strawberry. The first two flavors were really well executed. ÊThe Balsamic Strawberry could use a bit more balsamic, though. A couple drops of aged balsamic or a few ounces of a reduced balsamic would go miles here, as it had only a slight tang to differentiate it from any other (good) strawberry ice cream. Is it worth it? I guess that depends on how much you like ice cream, want to try interesting flavors, and have something to do standing in line.

This review is a tad bit old, seeing as it was a part of the 'Mission Adventure' I ended up going on with Amy J. However I adored this place. The seating was cute and cozy, the service was quick and friendly and my lavender honey scoop was tasty and delicious. The only negative I could see is if it were really busy (like I've heard it gets) I would have probably knocked off a star for the lack of seating and the crowd.

Tremendous variety of flavors to choose from, you just have to go with the ice cream. ÊThe line looks a little daunting at first but there's usually a reason why there's a line with people willing The flavors that I liked the best were coffee toffee and the salted caramel. The balsamic strawberry isn't too different from the standard strawberry (it's good, but nothing special). ÊThey switch flavors occasionally from what I hear so you gotta stop in to try the new flavors. Also, try the cookies and other goods that they sell once you enter the doors. They're tasty as well. Would definitely recommend swinging by the shop if you're in the area or even on vacation in SF (as I was)

Parking was annoying. As I was circling around looking for a space, I noticed a really long line twisting almost around the corner. I thought it was a line to a club or something but when I finally found a spot, I headed closer and realized it was a line just for a darn scoop of ice cream! I was sampling at least 4 flavors and really couldn't decide. I finally Ê7x7 recommended flavor: the famous Salted Caramel and cherished every bite. There was so much bursts of caramel flavor and with the hint of salt, perfectly balanced out the sweetness of the caramel. I definitely want to give the coffee toffee a shot next time and maybe a scoop of cookies and cream. The line seemed a bit long, but it moved fast. So don't turn back! If you know what you want, you can head straight to the cash register and order a prepackaged pint (i might do that next time!).

To experience Bi-Rite, please wait in line for at least 20 minutes, order salted caramel flavor on a cone, pay the cashier $2.25 for a kid's single scoop, and proceed out the door.

Bi-Rite Creamery is one of the only super-highly-rated place on Yelp that I don't think is overhyped. You can definitely taste the quality, even with the tiny samples they give you. The staff have always been very pleasant to me; one even brought personalizing the experience to a higher level by saying, "Wow! I dreamt last night of serving a girl wearing a black and white jacket, and here you are, in front of me!" Okay, I'm a sucker for people who try to make a connection with me, even if it's a slightly lame line like that. Brownie points from me :) Their ice cream is so good. It's always a struggle for me to choose just one [or two!] flavors, but I think my favorites are the salted caramel, honey lavender, and mint chip [my favorite flavor in the world]. The boy likes the Riccanela one [the snickerdoodle one] a lot. :P Definitely can taste the difference between this ice cream and mass produced ones. So go visit Bi-Rite if you're in town! Or even if you're not, it's worth a stop by. Line gets long on warm days, but you can sit in the park and enjoy your ice cream :) Oh, parking sucks in this area, though, so might be a bit of a walk. But I mean, that makes your extra calorie-consumption alright, right? (;

Until recently, Salted Caramel was the tune I sang from the end of the line to Bi-Rite Creamery's cash register. Then I met Brown Butter Pecan, and SC now has been pushed to the top of the scoops-in-a-bowl composition. That way I can visit Brown Butter periodically between licks and spoonfuls of unctuously-sweet Salted Caramel and then end on the high note of nutty-sweet cream and buttery-soft pecans. Notice the switch between subject and adjective? Apart from the exquisite flavor experience, the ice cream has time to be sensationally and poetically symbiotic. Perf. And I think the fact that my two favorite flavors from Bi-Rite Creamery manage to make butter the star of already-sinful ice cream speaks volumes for both parties involved. Last words: may punch cards rule the world forever and ever.

I won't go to many places by myself and have a meal or snack but I can sit down by myself to enjoy some icecream at Bi-Rite with a smile on my face, loving life. (true story) Out of all the ice creams I have devoured in my day, Bi-Rite tops them all. Something about their unique flavors that are so bold, fresh, and decadent. I don't mess with the single scoop, if I get to come up to the city and enjoy this little heaven on earth it's only a 2 scoop sundae or 2 scoops with toppings for me. I recently had a scoop of salted caramel, a scoop of Ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles) adorned with fresh gingerbread cake pieces. DELIGHTFUL. I've also tried their baked goods: the macaroons and the lemon gingersnap were my favorite! It's a really tiny place so expect to be waiting out the door and they only have like 4 small tables inside. But trust me, none of that will matter anymore after you had your first taste of Bi-Rite!

ummm whaaat this place has the most ridiculous line (although i think diddy riese has a longer one) So....interesting flavors. I enjoyed the spoonful of basil that I tried, but wasn't sure if I liked it enough to eat a whole scoop of it. The honey lavender was a bit too flowery for my taste, but it was nice. I ended up getting a kids sized cone of salted caramel ice cream and it definitely was worth it. The initial lick tasted kinda weird, but it got better and better. The waffle cone was really good too! I wouldn't say this is the best ice cream I've ever had, but I see the appeal of being a repeat customer. I'll be back to try more!

Ê Sorry to burst your bubbles, but I had a scoop of the salted caramel and honey lavender, and I thought it was just "okay." IMO, their scoops were fairly small.

Honey Lavender and Salted Caramel, you should be renamed Sin and Blasphemy, you are so good. Long lines all the time, but worth the wait.

Bi-Rite Creamery is legit! Normally, I prefer frozen yogurt over ice cream, but I had to give Bi-Rite a try after hearing all the buzz. Ordered the Coffee Toffee and Cookies N Cream and jizzed in my pants. Also tried my friend's sundae (forgot the name of it but it had whipped cream, lemon ice cream, and snickerdoodles) and was also pleasantly surprised. Gotta say though, I tried the famous salted caramel and almost yakked out of disgust... (and at this point, I'm fully aware I'll probably lose a lot of credibility with the rest of my reviews) but hey, I have a very refined palate, what can I say...

The weight I've lost in the past two months will be back on in maybe two weeks or maybe a week if I get a chance to come here every night after dinner. My friend and I swung by one night and I didn't believe her when she told me there is a line around the corner. I mean what place has a line at night in the cold in San Francisco for ICE CREAM and why haven't I heard of this place before? I wish they had a menu going around earlier because I didn't know what to choose when it was my turn to order so I basically ordered on a whim, salted caramel and cookie & cream. It was delicious! And it was COLD!

This is hands down some of the best ice cream I've ever had. And for $3.25 for the single you actually get a good amount--I always get the bowl. :) The salted caramel is good, definitely. But I'm going to say it isn't my favorite. THe Brown Sugar and Ginger Caramel Swirl and the Ricanelas (which they don't always have--but it's basically cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodle cookie pieces in it) are absolutely my favorites. Highly recommend those.Especially together! The roasted banana is AWESOME if you like banana. Honey Lavender is weird, but tastes like how you would expect. As toppings go, I tend to get the homemade graham crackers. SO GOOD. The line moves fast... kind of. Just accept that there will pretty much always be a line and wait in it and be happy because there's some glorious ice cream at the end. The service there is always super friendly and awesome. I don't know if I could live in SF if there was no more BiRite.

Note to self: next time get a cup and not a cone otherwise your ice cream will melt all over your hand and you will be really sad. Note to self again: get the salted caramel and brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl, but maybe pair it with something light and refreshing like honey lavender or balsamic strawberry. Good stuff! ÊThe consistency and texture of the ice cream is so creamy and rich, it MELTS in your mouth (...even though ice cream literally melts in your mouth). ÊThere's no other way to describe it. Only bummer was that my ice cream was melting so fast on me, I couldn't savor it and really enjoy it like I wanted to.

I freaking love this place! if I could give 10 stars i would. I never get sick of their icecream, ever. My fav is probably their salted caramel. My parents house is literally 6 min away so when I was living there i'd always hit up bi-rite , pretty often. Especially on hot days. Another great thing about this place is dolores park is right across the street so if you're with friends and want to relax and chill, you can just walk over and sit on the grass.

The one thing worse than the long line is looking for parking. ÊToday we came during the day, and surprisingly it took less than Ê5 minutes from the time we checked out the daily flavors menu to the time I took a first lick of that ice cream. ÊBut not surprisingly, parking took more than 20 minutes. Ê We each got a single size, for a total of 4 flavors. HONEY LAVENDER---amazing lavender infused flavor that's not too sweet! ÊMy favorite! SALTED CARAMEL---didn't know that salt can bring out the flavor of the caramel so flawlessly. CREME FRAICHE---good but just like the regular yogurt flavor from Nubi. BALSAMIC STRAWBERRY---good but I was expecting something much more different than what tasted like regular strawberry ice cream. * Stamp card * Friendly staff * Benches out side * Soft serve and bakery serving cup cakes next door! * Very difficult to find parking day and night.

This place easily rivals other ice-cream shops. The staff is very friendly and they have some pretty unique flavors. One of my favorites was the roasted banana and vanilla ice cream. It was basically this ice cream with a hint of caramelized banana throughout. Great texture, but I'd recommend ordering only a Kid's size of that, because it can get heavy quickly. My friends ordered their Blood Orange sorbet, which has a citrus-like sweetness followed by a slightly bitter aftertaste from the orange peel. It's an acquired taste. I didn't like it much at first, but I have to say, if you have both the rich, creamy roasted banana and complement it with a refreshing blood orange sorbet, the combination won't leave your taste buds disappointed. It's pretty much a balance of yin and yang flavors, I think. I guess we got lucky with the lines...virtually 0 people in line when we got there. When we left, the line extended beyond the entrance. Perfect ice-cream, perfect SF weather = win.

Only in SF would you find people lining up in some cold, windy weather to get some ice cream. There's a definite reason to! Salted caramel ice cream. This stuff is the BOMB-BETA ISHNESS. As a kid, I used to hold marshmallows over the flame on a stove to burn it up a bit. The skin that was burnt from the flame used to slide off the marshmallow and be a sugary, burnt flavor. That flavor is this salted caramel ice cream. I bought a double scoop. Who's counting calories? Ha. Not today. I also bought a pint. My husband never complains about this booty. Ha. I am truly a fan. Dear Mitchell's, I'm sorry, I've known you since a kid, but I think I'm moving on to better things. I love you, but I love Bi-Rite more.

My ideal sunny summer afternoon (which for SF is peppered throughout the year, and not restricted to June-July-Aug) includes a stop @ Bi-Rite. After your Dolores Park picnic starring one of Ike's famous sandwiches, stroll down 18th toward BART. Skip the inevitably long line-up into the 1st Bi-Rite you see, and instead go nextdoor to the pop-up window, for the limited list, but equally as mouth-watering selection of their famous beat-the-heat treats. Try the brown-butter cookie with coffee ice cream sandwich... and love your life. Enjoy it while taking in the gorgeous street art plastered down the entirety of Clarion Alley off of Mission.

I have been lamenting this review... I had very high hopes for Bi-Rite. ÊI bypassed many other options on my birthday in favor of making the trek to have my birthday sundae at Bi-Rite; how could I go wrong with so many great reviews? I will not say I was disappointed because many things were very good, even great, but it just wasn't what I had expected. ÊAnd slow, oh so slow to make our sundaes... Like 10+ minutes... Really? I got the brownie sundae with a scoop (love the very reasonably sized scoops) of ricanelas and a scoop of brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl. ÊBrownie, fabulous. Ricanelas, very tasty and I could really taste the snickerdoodle. ÊBrown sugar with caramel swirl, amazing. ÊWhipped cream on top, wow. ÊHere's where they lost me... The hot fudge was horrid! ÊIt wasn't fudgy... It was runny... It was thin... It was cold... It was bitter... It had a gnarly aftertaste that makes Walden Farms chocolate syrup taste good (and that, my friends, I have always thought to be impossible). ÊBecause of this it was a complete distraction. ÊAnd it was all over the place so there was no artful way to make it go away. Ê My husband got a banana split but really felt it should be labeled as a bananas foster sundae because all it had was bananas and the unfortunate chocolate crap being passed off as hot fudge, he said he would try it again but with caramel sauce instead. We all agreed that the ice cream itself was worth the trek and the brownie was good enough to stand alone but the sundaes were missing something. ÊSorry purists, but what the sundaes here need is a dose of Ghirardelli... Bi-rite ice cream with Ghirardelli chocolate, hot fudge, caramel... Mmmmmmmm, that would be heaven.

Expect a long line during weekends (especially in the summer), but they have the BEST SALTED CARAMEL EVER!! The soft serve salted caramel is especially delicious, on the days that you can catch it (m, w, sun). They always have the salted caramel ice cream though. Other good flavors are cookies and cream, malted vanilla with peanut brittle, roasted banana, coffee toffee, and brown butter pecan. Unlimited samples is an additional perk, and the staff is friendly and efficient. Don't forget to get your Bi-Rite punch card to work your way to free ice cream! A must stop if you happen to be in the Mission district on a weekday as there is rarely a line.

Salted Caramel. Salted Caramel. Salted Caramel. The brown sugar with the ginger caramel swirl was pretty stellar as well, but at least every other person who walked out the door while we were waiting in line walked out with - yup, you guessed it - Salted Caramel. But whatever you choose, you'll be getting some of the most inexplicably smooth and creamy ice cream out there, with a ridiculous selection of not just ANY flavours, but INTERESTING flavours at that.

I like how they don't have a limit to the amt of flavors you can try, and how they're generous about it (unlike Ici). I got the Ricanelas with the Brownsugar with ginger caramel swirl. I definitely tried a BUNCH of other flavors and they were ALL good. ÊWent in with friends, we all tried different flavors and shared the spoons. LOL. What I love about places like these are the abundant yet not over the top scoops of ice cream, the creaminess, the trust that it's not full of chemicals, and their fair attempts (but not super over the top) at being green. I definitely wouldn't cross a bridge to get this, but if I'm in the area, and with a good friend or friends, I definitely don't mind finding parking and waiting in the cold SF weather to eat the ice cream. PS: my friends loved Sam's Sundae. which has a super cool idea.. but.... I HATED IT! haha. ÊI kept on trying it too b/c i thought i was an epicure. Maybe they should've used salted whipped cream instead of just adding salt to the ice cream. blegh blegh blegh.

Went to Bi-Rite yesterday for the first time...I am moving to the Mission tomorrow. There was no line on a breezy Tuesday night around 5:30 pm - guess we beat the after-work rush. The woman who worked there was SO nice and patient and kept giving us flavors to try until we had almost every single one, and also suggested which flavors would go best together. Protip: Honey Lavender + Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl. I don't even like caramel but this one had such a rich, smoky burnt taste that was impossible to resist. The Earl Grey flavor tastes like boba! I definitely had two scoops and then picked up a quart of salted caramel from the market down the street. It's just that good.

TIP: If the line is crazy out the door, just walk in to pay for a pint size of the flavor you know you want to get (SALTED CARAMEL?) and you can easily bypass the line with a whole-lotta delicious icecream. (pre-packed) The area was nice, there was a huge park nearby, so probably what created such a long line when i got here... it was a GORGEOUS sunday afternoon!!!! From all the raving shout outs for SALTED CARAMEL, i had to give that a try, and then a few others: ROASTED BANANA, SNICKER DOODLE, EARL GREY They were all great! I was definitely sad they didnt have the Strawberry when i was there. And i didnt get to take my time to pick due to the massive line out the door. The salted caramel was "melt in your mouth good!" and smooth! The snicker doodle had some crisp-ness from the cookies, which was definitely great, flavor wasnt overly sweet like the cookie itself normally is. The roasted banana was like ripe banana's with a slight nutty flavor to fulfill the "toasted" labeling of the name, which was yummy, but i wish i tried the coconut now. Earl Grey was simply and tasted like milk tea.

I used to like your salted caramel ice cream, Birite, but that was before I had Berthillon in Paris. Your salted caramel is simply too sweet and not caramel-y enough.

ÊFor an ice cream parlor, only two flavors have ever come out of their mouths: honey Êlavender and salted caramel. ÊI like ice cream but am not a maniac about it. ÊI questioned myself on how good this ice cream can possibly taste. ÊIce cream all tastes the same to me unless it is some sugar free bullshit. Anyways, ÊI came here for dessert with ebenezer after lunch at bi-rite market. ÊI ordered the single scoop cup and got salted caramel and ginger caramel swirl while the object of numerous assignations got the honey lavender and some orange flavor. ÊFirst thing first, they don't give you spoon. ÊThey give you a wooden stick, much like the compressors they place on your tongue to check your tonsils. ÊThis creamery is legit. ÊThis clip sums it up perfectly: http://www.youtube.com/wÉ. ÊIf you are lazy, it is .46-1:08. ÊAnd if you are even lazier, the quote is, "once it hits your lips.....it's so good". Ê Once the salted caramel touched the tongue, I was transported to a land of fairies and sprites, lovingly tossing their pixie dust at any wayward soul in gayish delight. ÊThe salted caramel was so good that it was indescribable. ÊA fellow yelper said it tasted like the top part of a creme brulee....no...that description does not do it justice...there is simply no way to describe it. ÊIt was the best ice cream I ever had. ÊIt was so good that it managed to mute the ginger caramel flavor. ÊI ate it with such disgust, hating myself for not ordering 2 scoops of salted caramel. ÊI sampled a bit of my girlfriend's cup and to be quite honest, the honey lavender was underwhelming. ÊIt was good and had a very delicate taste, but i felt that I was eating potpourri. ÊHer orange flavor was super intense in flavor, however, I am not that big on orange ice cream. Ê Bi-Rite definitely made me a believer. ÊOne scoop of salted caramel can make you float, or at least your innards anyways. ÊDon't come here expecting a Fentons experience. ÊYou will not get a softball sized scoop, but a dainty one. ÊThis place is not Baskin Robbins nor is it Dryers. ÊIf you say so with conviction, I will punch you square in the nose, along with Ruggy J.

They had tons of unique flavors but since i've heard all about the salted caramel, I had to try that one and I also got the roasted banana. Roasted banana ftw! Nice banana flavor, not too sweet, perfect in my eyes. The salted caramel was ok since i'm not too big of a fan of caramel. I think it would be better if they had some more salt crystals sprinkled on top for more salty/sweet contrast. Overall the ice cream is really good, will be back soon to try the other flavors!

I got here pretty early in the day...so I didn't have to wait in line. Got earl gray ice cream and lavendar. It was good. nice to go just because of the different flavors they have, but i wouldn't go out of my way to get here. I'm more of a Mitchell's fan.

The 5 of us wanted to end the evening right after a wonderful weekend in SF and Marin. We drove to SF and Disha and I lined up for 20 minutes in the freezing cold to get 4 sundaes from Bi Rite. It was well worth it and absolutely was perfect. We ordered: one banana split with brown sugar and salted caramel ice cream for Ruchi with almonds, whip and a little fudge Disha and Mike got the vanilla, salted caramel with extra fudge whip and almonds I got the salted caramel, brown sugar with a little fudge, extra whip and almonds. I couldn't finish the ice cream and I was full. Everyone else polished their sundaes off like prized pigs at the county fair. This is a winner everytime and the staff working their have high energy and give good portions. Favorites: Salted Caramel and Brown sugar swirl...

One of the best ice creams in the city. Perfect on a hot day and perfect on a cold day. It's located across Dolores Park so that makes this place even better. Definitely a place everyone needs to hit up at least 10 times and if you have people visiting the city, take them here! Line may seem long, but it goes by pretty fast. There's a few seats inside the creamery and some benches right outside if you're hanging around. I had the single scoop Toasted Coconut flavor for $3.25 and it was delicious. Little chunks of coconut were in it and it was awesome. I also recommend Honey Lavender and the Banana flavor. The salted caramel is supposedly really good, but tried it and wasn't a fan of it at all.

I loved the salted caramel! ÊThe roasted banana was a nice accompaniment but I'm eager to try other flavors. ÊThe ice cream isn't too sweet, allowing the natural flavors to shine. ÊThis place is a winner. The only thing I don't like is that I'm able capable of eating so much ice cream in one sitting. They really ought to sell their ice creams to markets or open up a location in the south bay. ÊJust saying...

Delicious ice cream with unique flavors. ÊVery long line for ice cream that wraps around the block, but moves quickly. ÊIf you're buying a pre-packaged pint or quart, you don't have to wait in that line. ÊThere is a separate line which is much, much shorter. We got the balsamic strawberry, which is mildly flavored, creamy, with just a hint of salty balsamic notes. ÊI enjoyed it, but it wasn't what I expected. ÊAnd of course, the salted caramel. ÊThat was insanely good, but not everyone in our group approved. ÊThere is a STRONG burnt caramel bitter after-taste, that is not suitable for all palates! ÊI love strong coffee and dark chocolate, so I thought it was just terrific. It's pricey and parking is nearly impossible, so they get dinged a star. ÊI took BART to 16th street, so that wasn't bad, since I was in the neighborhood anyway.

I feel like this is a recurring theme in my reviews. Overrated. Before I knew what Bi-Rite was all about, I used to think that all of my friends had an unusual obsession with Thrifty ice cream. I had made some sort of weird association between Bi-Rite, Rite Aid, and Thrifty in my head, so whenever someone would rave about BR, I'd just kind of nod and say "Yeah, their ice cream is pretty good, I guess." When I finally found myself actually at Bi-Rite, things began to make more sense. Too bad some things still didn't though. Like why everyone thinks Bi-Rite is so amazing. It's not bad, but if you gave me Bi-Rite ice cream, told me it was from Thrifty, and explained that it was their new taffy/lilac/moose antler flavor, I'd probably believe you.

Quality ice cream, deeeelicious flavors & wonderful atmosphere! Bi-Rite is the coziest ice cream shop with an awesome location, right down the street from Tartine and across the street from Dolores Park. After reading all the reviews, I'm a bit scared to admit that I'm not a fan of the famous Salted Caramel. I know I know, don't hate me! It was okay but I like some of their other flavors way more. For instance, the Roasted Banana is incredible mmmm. And my favorite flavor by far? The Creme freakin' Fraiche! SO GOOOOD! My boyfriend was kinda weirded out that I dug Creme Fraiche the most ("It's just cream!") but it was perfectly rich & just...YUM. I could have ate a whole bowl of just that one flavor. It's nice to see that they expanded the shop to seat more people inside and they're very efficient & friendly when serving their customers. My only other qualm is that I wish the servings were a litttle bit bigger. I'm totally spoiled by the likes of Mitchell's & their humongous scoops! But the reviews don't lie, Bi-Rite is definitely worth a stop in SF...believe the hype.

If you ever find yourself around Dolores Park on a beautiful day, but decide against chillen on the grass because the only space is in-between those dudes sword-fighting with branches and the ones blowing bubbles... then come to Bi-Rite.

Re-discover your love for ice cream here!! I love their original and unique flavors. Every time I come here I alway wish I was more brave, so I can try more wild flavors. I always can't help but go back to my favorites... Roasted Banana, Cookies and Cream, and Brown Butter Pecan. I have sampled there Salted Caramel, Honey Lavender, and Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle. The people who work here are amazing also. They always offer samples of there new flavors and encourage you to step outside of what you always get. If with a line outside they don't just grab your money and rush you out the door. They seem to be always happy (I would be too if I was around ice cream all day ;). The aroma of the place is so creamy and delicious. Even in the winter there is a line out the door and even in the winter it's the perfect time for Bi-Rite. Last time I was in town for a 3 day trip, our friends ended up coming here like 3 times...haha Got to love ice cream!

They opened up a soft serve stand next to the shop so don't make the mistake of waiting int he wrong line (it'll be the longer one haha). The line was pretty long even though it was kinda cold and windy when we went. ÊGood thing is the line moves along pretty fast. ÊThey have some unique flavors like the salted caramel, honey lavender, creme fraiche, strawberry balsamic, etc. ÊThey've also got some premade sundaes to choose from and suggest which flavors might go well together. My friend got the Sam's Sundae. ÊIt's the one with chocolate, salt, and olive oil. ÊI tasted it and I think they put a bit too much salt in there...I mean I like the salty sweet thing...but it was really salty. ÊThe olive oil was also interesting. ÊIt added this strange fruity, savory flavor. It was hard to decide, but I finally decided on 3 flavors. Salted Caramel Tasty! ÊSalty, but not too much so. Honey Lavender The honey is local and you can taste the subtle flavor in the ice cream. ÊThe lavender is in there too, but doesn't overwhelm the honey. ÊIt's a nice balance. Strawberry Balsamic It tastes more or less like regular strawberry ice cream. ÊThe balsamic is in there, but super light. ÊIf you didn't tell me it was strawberry balsamic I don't think I could pick it out. Overall pretty good ice cream, but expect to pay 5-6 bux for it. ÊI'm pretty sure my Chinese dad would not understand haha. ÊI'd say it's worth trying cause the ice cream is good and they do have some unique flavors. ÊThere were definitely a few more flavors there I wanted to try.

Seriously there is nothing new I can add about Bi-Rite that has not already been said. I mean you can pass by at any given time (during their hours of operation) and you can pretty much expect to see a ridiculous wait regardless of weather, time and day. We happen to pass by the other night on our way home and saw that the line was less than ten people long so we parked and stood in line. It took us about 10-15 minutes from the time of arrival and by the time we got to the cash register. ÊWe must have arrived during the "eye of the storm" because the line was trailed out toward the end of the block by the time we were leaving with our ice cream and a bag of THE BEST gluten free macaroons I have ever tasted. My Earl Grey Tea and salted caramel was seriously the best way to wrap up the end of the long day of driving and running errands.

I've been meaning to write an update for a while now, but Earl Grey pushed me over the edge. Have you tried it? If you haven't, it would be in your best interest to do so. The bliss that ensues is an experience like no other. This is the hook, line, and sinker - if you hadn't gotten addicted to this place before, the Early Grey ice cream is what'll do it. Either that or their amazing homemade hot chocolate. YUM. I'm still a huge fan of the Vegan chocolate coconut. Just can't give it up. Also, huge boost in the greatness of the customer service, despite huge lines and holiday season. There's this one fella, I'm sure you'll see him one day, who has the most sincere face. He smiles all the time, and I love the way he scoops my ice cream. Even when I'm cranky from a half hour of finding parking and fifteen minutes standing in line on a cold winter day/night, interacting with him always makes me feel a little better. I told him this to his face once, lol, and even though my friends agreed with me I think he might have thought we were really weird haha.

This place wasn't bad, however, it was not the best ice cream I've ever had. My brownie sunday was composed of several scoops of vanilla ice cream, two brownies, and whipped cream with chocolate swirled on top. The thing that got me was that half of it was entirely whipped cream, which had a strange, milky taste to it, that didn't seem right. I dug to the bottom to get to the ice cream, but after eating a few bites, I couldn't finish it. The ice cream itself, was pretty good, which is why I at least gave the place three stars, but I would not recommend getting a sunday.

No wonder Bi-Rite is such a popular spot, their ice cream is delicious! I had their coffee toffee - that's some serious coffee! ÊI crave it now. Ê(note: I would not advise to eat this after dinner like I did, you'll be tossing and turning all night from the caffeine!) I also recommend just getting their scoops of ice cream rather than the sundaes - too much toppings.

Hot Damn. This place is good. This was my first time there and I guess there is always a line so we knew what we were headed into. Tip - go to Philz up the street and get a cup of coffee, come back and wait in line until you get your ice cream. It took about 20 minutes to get through the line but it was so worth it. I got salted caramel with roasted banana. It was amazing. My friend tried with cinnamon cookie one - also amazing.

Bi-Rite Creamery offers the #1 Ice Cream experience in SF. I had the salted caramel, honey lavender, and earl grey flavors, and each were so powerful in flavor yet tantalizing to the tongue, that I immediately understood the hype of Bi-Rite. ÊThe Salted Caramel was definitely a favorite & is unlike anything I've ever tried before. ÊSmoky in a way that I didn't know ice cream could be. The Honey Lavender was also much stronger in flavor (yet not off-putting) & superior to other Lavender ice creams I've consumed.

Over-rated. Flavors I've tried: Salted caramel - good; a little too sweet for my palate Mint chip - super creamy and not as minty as expected Balsalmic strawberry - more bland in taste than expected; mellow flavor satisfying my tastebuds Last summer I had a bright red ice cream flavor.

I've only tried the salted caramel but it was sooooo good that I don't know if I could ever get myself to NOT get it. Do yourself a favor and get in line for this salty/sweet goodness that is the Salted Caramel flavor at Bi-Rite. The lines get crazy long during summer that they need a bouncer to handle things. Yes you read it correctly, a bouncer for Club Bi-Rite. If you want to avoid the lines, I'll let you in on a little secret. Just walk in, go to the freezer and pick up a pint of the flavor you want.

ÊWOW, since I had never been I got to pick the flavor......I was torn between many, but the snickerdoodle flavor caught my eye and holy ice cream was it delicious. ÊIt had real snickerdoodle chunks in it, was creamy - sort of a mix between gelato and the triple churned ice cream and was a perfect fit in the sugar waffle cone, we should have gotten 3 scoops damnnn it. We then strolled down to the bakery (1 shop down....I know, we're on a roll here) Êwhere they have soft serve and had a vanilla-coffee swirl sample by the extremely nice and happy gal that was working.

Service was blah. The workers didnt seem happy to be there, and just wanted to get the eff out and go home. Parking is horrid. I had the orange cardamom and coconut.. Im a sucker for all things coconut, but Im going to say it was just alright. The orange cardamom was pretty good.. I didnt get much of a cardamom taste though. I tasted the roasted banana and salted caramel. The roasted banana tasted like banana.. Good, though. I haaaated the salted caramel. It tasted like superly overly burnt creme brulee. Basically it tasted like burned sugar. Not a fan. Also not a fan of all the hipsters. Why cant I avoid them?!

The home-made ice cream here is legit! The first time I came here, I got the honey lavender and salted caramel.

Side note: There's another line on the other side for soft serve.

I've been eyeing Bi-Rite for a while ever since my sister and a good friend of mine raved about it. WHEW, it's not overhyped! The ice cream is handmade with natural ingredients and the unique flavors do not disappoint. I had a triple scoop with honey lavender, mint chip, and salted caramel. The honey lavender was definitely my favorite; the fragrant lavender pairs so nicely with the sweetness of the honey. The mint chip was by far one of the best I've ever had. The mint really comes through! And of course, their famous salted caramel is heavy yet more addicting with every spoonful. My only gripe, if any, would be that the ice cream is extremely rich and leaves a film of creaminess on the roof of my mouth, but hey, it's a small price to pay for such a treat!

Bi-Rite Creamery is probably the most popular ice cream place in SF at the moment. ÊI've always enjoyed my ice cream there and the assortment of flavors are changing all the time so there is always something new. ÊThe big plus for me is they do not seem to use any extra stabilizers such as gum which for me can distract from the taste of the ice cream. ÊThis for me gives Bi-Rite the edge over Mitchell's. To make the detour to get ice cream here is another question. ÊIt isn't super close to the BART station, but it isn't far and is probably worth the walk. ÊHowever, there is almost always a line. ÊI've been there in the middle of a weekday, and there is a short line. ÊDuring busy hours, the line snakes around the corner. ÊIf I'm here with friends, I'll wait.

As you come down 18th and Dolores street, once you see the line rounding around the block - you know you're close to BiRite Creamery. This small ice cream shop serves some of the most creamiest and delicious mixtures you can imagine. I love the Toffee Sundae - housemade almond toffee is crumbled with marcona almonds on top of coffee toffee ice cream with hot fudge and whipped cream. Other delcious flavors are salted caramel, roasted banana, balsamic strawberry, and toasted coconut.

You scream. I scream. We all scream for ice cream!!! And if it's Bi-rite's, we really all will be! Hands down one of the best ice cream places I have ever been to. For once, you can believe all the hype. They have super unique flavors that you probably won't be able to find anywhere else. My favorites are the infamous salted caramel and the earl grey tea. Their cookies 'n' cream is hecka good too. Blows dreyers...and breyers...out of the water. The flavors are just so rich and the texture so creamy. Regardless of the time or the weather conditions, there seems to always be a line here. On hot SF nights, the line is out the door and around the corner. ÊIf it weren't for the masses of people waiting behind me, I would probably test out every flavor when it's my turn to order. Parking can take quite a while and waiting in line can take even longer, but I still think it's worth it. Even in the chilly winter weather, I'd still be down to get myself a cup of Bi-Rite ice cream. Therefore, I am forced to give this place nothing less than 5 stars!

I came here on a cold day and the line was not too long. About 10 people in front of us. I heard many good things about this place and finally got to try it. I got the single cup with 2 different flavors - the Honey Lavender and the Salted Caramel. I don't think I've tasted any ice cream this good. It's creamy but not heavy. The flavor is so true to the name - the lavender was heavenly and the honey was sweet. Lavender is definitely an acquired taste and they did a good job of incorporating it with the honey. The balance with the salted caramel was just perfect - the salty with the sweet worked well together. Even though the weather was freezing and my face and hands were ice-sicles; this smooth and creamy dessert made me feel like I was on cloud 9. "Now, why did I wait so long to try this place?" I keep asking myself. Next time I won't wait so long to come back again.

Ricanelas ice cream with bruleed bananas... YUM! IMO, Bi-Rite wins best ice cream in SF (although Mr. & Mrs. Misc is still on my must try list if I can ever get there before they close). Some other amazing flavors to note here would be the Orange-Cardamom, Roasted Banana and Eggnog. This place has a line down the block in the freezing cold so be prepared!

I'm a fan of local businesses and I make it a point to only eat at these types of establishments. Bi-Rite is no exception. The family who owns Bi-Rite Market across the street branched out and opened this place a while back. Who can resist? The lines are always out the door and sometimes even onto Dolores. That MUST be a good sign right? Anyway, I've been stopping by here for years now, ever since I was introduced to all of its deliciousness. There are many original flavors, one that I like in particular is Lavender. They sell premade ice cream sandwiches, cakes, and pints/quarts located in their freezer. There's also an assortment of chocolate fudges and ice cream scoops/products. Overall, the prices here are higher than say, Baskin Robins, but hey, that's what you pay for quality! If you're just going to buy a premade ice cream sandwich or something from the freezer, just go ahead and grab what you want. You can pay directly at the cashier instead of having to wait in line with all the others. I expect this place to be busy busy busy this summer!

Stopped in with Classy Mike - and special guest Mr. Matt-boto - for dessert during our road trip from New York to Los Angeles. We finished dinner at about 10:30, meaning we had half an hour to get to Bi-Rite. ÊThinking on the spot, I suggested we flag down a cab. Twenty-five minutes later, and not a moment too soon, the driver dropped us off in front of the line of 15-20 people. "Is this a bar?" ÊHe asked, reasonably. "Nope." ÊWe said. Ê"Ice cream." He laughed. Ê But you gotta be dedicated. Bi-Rite is the kind of place where you eat way more than you should, go to sleep stupidly full, then walk up in the morning and pace around nervously before making the inevitable decision to go back and start the cycle anew. It likes up to the hype. ÊAmazing flavors, homemade graham crackers (!), hot fudge, brownies, and the line doesn't even take that long. ÊI've eaten ice cream all around the country, and this one is on the very small list of my two or three favorites. Food: 25/25 stars Ambiance: 18/25 stars Service: 25/25 stars Bathroom: 19/25 stars Probability of going back: 100%

I almost feel like I shouldn't review this place because my review will just get buried with the other 300+ reviews and it's not like it needs anymore help in getting customers in...but I'll do it just to say I've been here! =) For my last trip to San Francisco I made it a point that I NEEDED TO COME HERE whether it'd be with my girlfriends I was traveling with or my friends that lived there. Since the rest of the girls were visiting family on the Saturday we were visiting there, I went to have lunch with a friend and told him he needed to take me here because I've heard so much good stuffs about it from coworkers, clients, friends and yelpers. When we plugged the address into his GPS it brought us to some other weird location so we ended up getting lost for a good hour and we only found it after plugging it into his Iphone GPS. The parking there is horrible because everything is street parking so we parked a few blocks away and on top of a hill. ÊWhile we walked down to Bi-Rite it started raining but I was determined to eat here! With no rain or the cold stopping me! As soon as we got there, I was surprise to find no line outside or inside with us being the 1st in line. I was so excited to eat here that I tried various flavors from first trying the "salted caramel" then the "pumpkin" then the "mint chip" then the "roasted banana" and finally then the "honey lavender". I got the small cup with 2 scoops of ice cream which I opted for of course the salted caramel and honey lavender. As for my friend, he got the pumpkin and honey lavender. I don't know if I got the wrong batch but the Salted Caramel wasn't my fave because it was a bit too bitter..and my friend also said his batch was to salty. I do have to say that we both agreed that the honey lavender was to die for! It's a weird combination but totally awesome! It isn't to sweet nor was it boring...but it was just perfectly right! Only wish I got to try the olive oil when I visited because it was seasonal so they didn't have it at the time. This ice cream place is so good that while I was leaving the shop, I ran into my old boss from Hawaii!...small world, and definitely a bangn' whole in the wall place for 2 Hawaii visitors being here at the same time! Prices here are just right..very inexpensive for something so savory and good! Workers are also very helpful, and non judgmental when asking to keep trying the other flavors. The seats here are limited to only about 3 tables on the side but who wants to sit inside when Dolores park is right around the corner...perfect combination of ice cream and beautiful grassy park to eat on

Oh wow. ÊThe salted caramel is amazing. ÊNo joke. ÊI was only in the bay for a few days, and made a trip out of my way to have it again before I left. ÊI hate standing in line, I really don't get why people like to, (seriously, I was exiting a garage and 3 cars stood in one line and the other lane was empty) but I would stand in line for the ice cream here. ÊI hear that there are other places with great ice cream, but I didn't want to take a chance on something when I knew I would be pleased if I went here again.

Even at 10pm, there was a line wrapping around the corner! But if you're craving homemade ice cream, this is the place to go! I got the four scoops..because I couldn't decide which flavors to get so I went with all four! I got the salted caramel (of course) the balsamic strawberry, the coffee toffee, and the honey lavender. I have to admit though the salted caramel had the most unique taste. Each flavor just shot your mouth with flavor and definitely lived up to expectation! I have to admit though, my favorite flavor was roasted Banana. But that's definitely by preference. If you ever want to cut the line, just buy a pint and take it home to eat!

I LOVE Bi-Rite. ÊMmmmmm. ÊI can never say no, even if I'm really full from dinner. Not like this place really needs another long, 5-star review, so I'll just keep it short and tell you my favorite things about this place: 1) Ricanelas = cinnamon ice cream + snickerdoodle cookie pieces. ÊAbsolutely my favorite ice cream flavor EVER. ÊAnd that's saying a lot! 2) The line last night was only just outside the door and to the first window...shortest I've ever seen it! ÊSo I guess the moral of the story is...go to Bi-Rite when it's really cold outside on a Friday night around 9:45pm...but there still may be a line. ÊIt's just that good. :) 3) Sam's Sundae = chocolate ice cream with bergamot olive oil drizzle + sea salt. ÊA-maz-ing! ÊWas featured on the Food Network's "Best thing I ever ate," and so my friend and I were curious and gave it a try. ÊOh man..soooooooo good. ÊSounds weird, I know, but try it and you won't be disappointed! 3) Salted caramel is also delicious...I tried this the first couple times I came here. ÊBut it's hard to eat more than a few bites of, for me. ÊAnd I've since discovered ricanelas, so there's just no question anymore. ;) Ê 4) All their other flavors are delicious too, and I usually try 1 or 2 before getting my standard ricanelas. Bi-Rite, you will always be worth the wait!

I once waited 10 min in line and got salted caramel & roasted banana ice cream. After taking a couple bites, I decided that I needed more, so I got back in line, and by the time I reached the front, I was done and ready to get more. Basically, I love this place and all the flavors I've tried here (even the more normal ones like mint chocolate and white chocolate raspberry), but my all time favorite is roasted banana. Oh wait, I'm not that big of a fan of the honey lavender, since I feel like I'm eating body lotion or something. Maybe ask them for a sample before you get a scoop to see if you have that same reaction.

After three years in the city and countless trips to DP, I freaking FINALLY tried The Bi-Rite Ice Cream this week. ÊAbout time! I don't know how this never happened before. I don't buy into hype easily, but I don't avoid it like the plague either. ÊTherefore, I have no rational explanation for why my mouth and Bi-Rite ice cream have never made sweet, sweet love until this week. This story takes place on a Friday around 6pm. ÊMy friends and I had to wait in line for approximately 7 minutes. ÊThe wait went something like this: 0 min: I'm being a party pooper, going, "Ehhh, I don't know if I really want ice cream." 2 min: Jealously watching a couple with a dog eating their cones outside. ÊThe guy had pistachios sprinkled over his cone, and one of the nuts on the side of the cone that was furthest from his face starts melting down the side of the cone. ÊLife slows to slow motion. ÊThe pistachio is dangling 1mm above his pinky finger, threatening to fall at any second. 3 min: "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!" I scream (in that deep slo-mo voice) as this guy's pistachio falls off his cone and onto his dog's head. ÊThe dog maneuvers the nut into his mouth and swallows. 4 min: We reach the storefront, which has menus displayed in the window. Ê"OH MY GOD I have GOT to have this," I say, pointing to honey-lavender ice cream on the menu. 5 min: "OH MY GOD I have GOT to have this," I say, pointing to earl grey ice cream on the menu. 6 min: "OH MY GOD I have GOT to have this," I say, pointing to salted caramel ice cream on the menu. 7 min: "OH MY GOD I have GOT to have this," I say, pointing to roasted banana ice cream on the menu. Ê I walk out with a cone of earl grey & honey lavender (I'll spare you the details of how difficult it was to decide on two flavors). ÊIt was divine. ÊI want to go swimming in a pool of the honey lavender ice cream. I'm not normally a fan of lavender, but the honey tones down its slight bitterness, so it's just this heavenly honey-flower-tasting thing with a nice tea aftertaste. Ê I slurp it up all over the place, it melts all over my hands, I lick my hands although that is gross, proclaim it the best cone of ice cream ever, and die happy. Then I come back to life to write this Yelp review.

DELICIOUSSS!!! :) I've driven past this place many times & always see a long line. I finally was able to come here about a year ago on Mother's Day. It was a beautiful day in May, & of course the line was already at the corner. I didn't wait too long to get to the front of the line. Their Salted Caramel was YUM! It's their most popular flavor, so of course I to had to try it. Also, they just brought back the Balsamic Strawberry. I loved it! It was soo good! I wish that they had it all the time, haha. I've stayed loyal to these flavors the following times. There's limited seating here. You're probably better off enjoying your ice cream on the benches outside or across the street at Dolores Park. Parking usually sucks around this area, so good luck! But I can't wait to come again! ;)

Amazing! There will always be a line no matter what time of the day you go. I brought my family here for the first time, every person trying a different combination of flavors. The ice cream is not too sweet and light, which makes it an amazing summer dessert. As a family of 4 we were able to taste almost every flavor except for a few with the Bi-Rite scoop choices. If you're hesitant about what a whole cup of a particular flavor might be, I definitely suggest asking for a sample. Have fun, Bi-Rite ice cream is delicious.

This was my 2nd time at bi-rite. I got the coffee toffee sundae. It was "A-OK" .

I think i've officially decided I'm a Mitchell's Ice Cream kind of girl. Parking isn't all that great in this area, but thats what you expect in sf already.

I love you, Bi-Rite but not for your Salted Caramel.. I know, everyone else does but you have so much more than just salty and sweet... THE EARL GREY!! hubbahubba, the earl grey, knocks me off my feet. Here, is my winner. Taste so legit, i love it more than the actual tea itself. Love the pineapple too! and honey lavender, and blood orange, and roasted banana and ..seriously, I think you know where I'm going with this! I absolutely adore that they sample taste with silver spoons rather than plastic ones, because people like me who are indecisive will go and try nearly every flavor and imagine how wasteful that is.. MM and their baked goods, I'd go and buy pints but when I come around here the lines so long, parking a beezy, and we're chilling around the area far too long to keep a pint for home :( XOXO, love you Bi-Rite cause you make your ice cream RIGHT!

Came here one night with a bunch of friends, and it was close to closing. LUCKILY, we made it in time despite the line. Waited for about 5-10 minutes for a scoop of the Salted Caramel I read about. I had it with a sugar cone, and a couple of my friends had it in a cup. I think I had the tastier choice. :) It was indeed tasty, but what is most interesting about this was it's taste. I cannot fully grasp a definite description, so I'll just say it was Salted and Caramelly. I've never had this unique flavor clash inside my mouth, confusing my taste buds with such tastes. I NEED to come back to this place to try their other selections if not grab one or two scoops of their Salted Caramel again. Good luck finding parking though, it was a packed street when I went down there. But if you're feeling a bit daring, park where ever you want and grab yourself a scoop and zoom away happily eating your ice cream. (Just don't say I told you so if you get ticketed.)

Thought I'd see what all the hype was about by coming to Bi-Rite during a hot Sunday in SF. ÊWe got there when the line was super short (maybe 10 people ahead of us). ÊBy the time we left, the line was around the block. ÊWe got the Salted Caramel, Balsamic Strawberry, Cookies and Cream, & Watermelon. It's ice cream. ÊYou can't really have bad ice cream-- can you? ÊAnyway, I enjoyed our scoops a lot. ÊI like how they have so many different types of unique flavors. ÊService was quick, prices were reasonable. ÊI'll be back again if I'm in the hood, but I'd still like to try out the other gazillion dessert places around SF too. Ê4 stars for the variety of flavors and goods. Ê Ê MLOU'S TIPS ----------- 1) Salted Caramel is the flavor that EVERYONE recommends. ÊIt is VERY caramel. ÊIt's a little too sweet for me, but you won't be disappointed if you have a sweet tooth. 2) If you like soft-serve ice cream or other baked goods, you should go next door to The Window. ÊIt's Bi-Rite's other shop that specializes in just those items! ÊThey even have Salted Caramel cupcakes!

Quick Tip (7/19/2011): Coffee sundae! Located on the corner of Dolores and 18th St in San Francisco, this is a pretty dope place to buy some ice cream. You can buy your sundae or cone, and head on over to Dolores park (which is literally across the street) to enjoy your ice cream treat. Well, that is if the fog hasn't arrived to this part of the city yet. I always get the Coffee sundae because...I like the toffee and almonds (i think it's almonds) they put in it. It's very different from other sundaes I've had, especially Ghirardelli! It's a good change from the usual. The sundaes are much smaller, too, but is a good portion size. I think they make their own ice cream because not all the flavors stay the same, and they also sell pre-packaged ice cream. This place is pretty small, so once again...you may not want to go to this place with a ton of people unless you do plan on spending it across the street at Dolores Park. Parking can be a pain in your buttocks, but if you find one...bless you. AND the line can get pretty long, too. Just don't go there starving and expecting a huge sundae.

YET another place to wait but it is totally worth it! Let's just first clear this up...I honestly was debating if i should give this place a 4 or a 5 star but I end up giving it a 5 because I want to say this is my favorite ice cream place. They have different flavors everyday but they always have a few that is going to be on menu no matter what. Today I had the something pecan ice cream and coffee toffee and both of them was amazing! I didn't even think about coffee toffee because I tried it last time and instantly FELL IN LOVE. I don't know how they do it but there is no other places that compare to what Bi-rite has to offer in terms of this ice cream. :) It's just amazing. The pecan ice cream was pretty darn good as well. Don't listen to what i have to say...JUST COME HERE AND TRY IT AND GET WHATEVER FLAVOR YOU WANT OR OF COURSE TRY OUT THE FLAVORS FIRST AND THEN GET IT :)

Definitely one of the best desserts to treat yourself to on a nice, hot and sunny day. But as long as that sun stays out, the line for Bi-Rite will be even longer. If you don't mind waiting (I suggest you do), then you'll be treated to one of SF's best treats. My favorite so far? Well I haven't tried them all to have a clear-cut favorite but I do love the Honey Lavender and Earl Grey. Ice cream at its perfection. I tried the Salted Caramel and didn't think it was all that. It's right by Dolores Park and the Mission, so it's a perfect place to drop by for a snack or even right after dinner.

The best way to avoid those ridiculously long lines (although we still had to wait about 5ish minutes) is to visit at 9:30pm on a Tuesday night when it's 48 degrees outside. The nice thing (but sometimes not as fun thing) about Bi-Rite is their safely tasty flavors. Can't go wrong by the general masses for the most part. Honey lavender, always a hit. Earl Grey, ever so fragrant. Chocolate is bombastic. Etc, etc. The quality of ice cream is also very good, dense and rich. However, it doesn't give me that tingle I get in my panties when something's just outta control.

Unique ice cream flavors make it worth the trip and the wait. There's usually a line to get ice cream in the evening or during a hot day, but it's worth the wait. Their flavors are yummy, and if you're not sure what one tastes like, they're always happy to give you tastings at the counter. My personal favorites include ricanelas, roasted coconut (some batches aren't as good as others of this flavor) and lavendar (though my friend says it tastes like soap. I personally love it.) Get a scoop then get a pint for home! Don't want to wait in line? Just grab the pint and go to the head of the line. They also have a soft serve option at another window, which has less of a line.

Part of the "charm" of Bi-Rite is waiting 40+ minutes in line for ice cream. (The ice cream is worth the wait, as well as bragging rights in telling/complaining to your friends that you waited 40 minutes for ICE CREAM). If you want to bypass this process, walk a block over to Bi-Rite Market, grab a pint of your favorite flavor from the freezer in the back, and wait 10 minutes at the checkout line to pay. No more complaints.

I love bi-rite. I generally am not a big fan of ice cream, but for bi-rite I make and exception and I am obsessed with the coconut ice-cream. They have so many great flavors and constantly create new ones, that once you have been there the long line and even the price makes sense. No visit to SF and definitley the Mission is complete without ice-cream from bi-rite.

Pure deliciousness. Don't be turned away by the long lines, they move fast and the ice cream is worth any kind of wait anyways. The Salted Caramel ice cream makes it on the 7x7 Things to Try Before You Die list every year. You can't go wrong with this flavor. Also deserving of a mention: Toasted Coconut & Roasted Banana. If you don't want to wait in line, you can grab a few pints and bring it directly to the register.

Went to Bi-Rite Creamery for the first time with the S.O. yesterday afternoon, and now I can attest to all the rave about this place! Man oh maaaan, it is amazingly delicious! When we arrived, the line curved around the corner, but we were prepared to wait an hour or more just to try it. Thankfully, though, the line moved pretty fast! We probably ordered within 30 minutes of waiting in line. If you've been to Ici in Berkeley, it's got nothing on Bi-Rite. Although they both have unique flavors, the wait for Ici isn't really worth it that much compared to that of Bi-Rite. Ici ice cream has a more light and "icy" texture, while Bi-Rite ice cream has a smoother and creamer texture. Depending on what you like, both places are great. Anyways, back t Bi-Rite! We ordered a "single" size with Cherry-Raspberry Sorbet and Peach Ginger as well as a "double" size with Honey Lavender, Peach Ginger, and Salted Caramel in cups rather than cones. When I tasted the double size, I thought it was heavenly, but if you add their candied peanuts and walnuts, it tasted BEYOND heavenly (if that's even possible, haha). The salty and sweet combination is an orgasmic blast in your mouth that tickles your taste buds like no other. The Cherry-Raspberry Sorbet is amazing as well. I loved the tangy bite it has to it coupled with the more mild taste of the Peach Ginger. A great palate cleanser, in my opinion. Definitely worth the trip to SF and wait in line. If you're driving, there should be plenty of street parking a block or so away! Plan on going again to try out all the other flavors they have to offer.

Oh, quite the yummy in gourmet ice cream.... this go 'round was some salted caramel, roasted banana, and honey lavender, shared by 3. Um.... *this* was gone in 60 seconds! PS They opened up a soft serve and cookie window just to the east of its ice cream (across the st. from its market) in March!!! More tempation always hurts!

Went here after dinner at Nihon. Getting here was an adventure. Three grown men tried to catch a cab in the pouring rain for 25 mins, making it to Bi-Rite 5 mins before they closed. In other words, I was wet, cold, tired and a little inebriated. I ordered: Sam's Sundae Chocolate ice cream with bergamot olive oil, maldon sea salt and whipped cream All my problems vanished. The ice cream was smooth and rich, the salt was crunchy and the perfect amount, and the olive oil contributed a little aroma and incredible luxurious mouth-feel. We were so grateful to the cab driver for actually picking us up, I bought him a scoop of Orange Cardamom (after tasting it first) and it was so good it almost made me change my order. I will be back, hopefully with more time.

Oh, Bi-Rite, I went all out of my way to see you and taste your delicious salted caramel ice cream, and was sadly disappointed. I might have given it a higher rating (like a 3) but my expectations were so high and then miserably dashed. ÊThis is supposed to be the gold standard for all salted caramel ice cream, and while the flavor was fine, the ice cream had ice chunks and was not creamy. ÊSo sad.

Can't believe I've never reviewed this place! It is probably my favorite stop in SF, and well worth the drive from the south bay. I was originally hooked on honey lavender (try it!!) but now I'm really enjoying coffee toffee. ÊEvery time I hit a little toffee bit, my life becomes a pinch more joyous. I've taken to buying pints to take home with me, especially when the line is long since you can avoid the line by buying a pint! Check out Bi-Rite market on the same block, too.

Let me start off by saying that the ice cream itself deserves 5 stars. BUT, i'd say there are other aspects that are lacking. My boyfriend and I came around 8:00 p.m. on a Sunday night and luckily, there was no wait. ÊBut even no one else in the shop, the employees behind the counter were rushing us with our ice cream selection. ÊThis being the first time trying Bi-Rite, I was really excited to try out some different flavors. ÊMy boyfriend and I each asked for one sample and the guy serving us hesitantly gave us a small sample. ÊWe weren't convinced/set on the first samples that we tried, and we were planning on getting several scoops, so we figured we could try at least one more sample. ÊThe guy serving us then gave us a semi-dirty look, making us feel bad for asking for another sample. ÊHow ridiculous is that? ÊThere wasn't even any one else in the store. ÊAnyway, he did give our requested samples and then we decided that we wanted a triple scoop. This is where things got complicated. ÊSo here, they don't measure ice cream in scoops. ÊThey measure by sizes. ÊWe asked for three scoops, we didn't realize that they don't do "scoops," and so the guy then responded rudely "single or double." ÊWe didn't know what this meant until we took a step back and re-read the menu. ÊSo, pretty much, you can order a kid's size, single size or double size ice cream. ÊAnd within each order, you may try 2-3 flavors. ÊAnyway, since we were sharing the 3 "scoops" we decided to get the double, to get more ice cream. However, the serving was really small and we were really not impressed by the service. Ê Overall, I would not come back unless one of my friends insisted on coming here. ÊIce cream should be fun, and the employee here ruined that for me. ÊI'd rather go to mitchells, where there is a parking lot and much larger scoops. Notes: -Parking can be difficult. ÊI circled the area a couple of times and then got lucky. -Semi-small scoops.

Been here a couple of times and it is definitely solid ice cream. Obviously a little pricey, you can probably save some money if you're going to share with someone and just get a pint to enjoy at Dolores. Not a fan of chocolate ice cream, I love that everything isn't a variation of chocolate this or that. Their salted caramel is definitely worth trying but I'm a super fan of the balsamic strawberry flavor and the creme fraiche. Their flavors are clean and flavorful with a great consistency (melts a little fast though) so come and catch it when there's a short line.

MMMM, I tried the salted caramel and honey lavender. I've never had salted caramel before, so I can't really compare it to something else, but it was dericiousss. And the cone tasted fresh out of the oven too (wait...cones are baked in the oven, right?). The only down side was that my salted caramel melted really fast, and I wasn't even eating it slowly. I ordered the kids sized cone for ~$2. I had a bite of the honey lavender from my friend, and it felt like I just took a bite from Bath & Body Works. It was like swallowing the scent of lotion, lol. Lavender relaxes you, am I right? Anyways, I didn't expect something to taste like that from ice cream. Definitely worth a try.

My favorite ice cream place ever, because of its unique flavors I can't get anywhere else and they are soooooo good! ÊMy favorite flavors here are the earl gray and the malted vanilla. ÊI have never had earl gray ice cream before, and once I tried it I fell in love with it. ÊI am a big fan of tea and this flavor rocks my socks! Yesterday I Ricanelas for the first time and loved it! ÊIf you are a big fan of snickerdoodle cookies then this is a good flavor for you to try! ÊThe ice cream is super creamy, and there are many chunks of snickerdoodles in the ice cream! ÊI've never had snickerdoodles ice cream in my life! ÊSooo good! Other notable flavors are roasted banana and cookies and cream. One thing about this place I hate is the long long lines at all hours and days! ÊBut I love it so much I think it is totally worth the wait. ÊThe best things in life are worth the wait =) ÊWell maybe a half hour wait...

God bless the Food Network! Without them I may have never stumbled upon this haven of creamy confection. It's been months since I've stopped by but on a random Monday afternoon the line was still, (and always has been) out the door. Somehow I didn't mind. And I never do because it's well worth the wait everytime. At Bi-Rite the ice-cream is made in small batches, the ingredients are organic and all their packaging is biodegradable. So you can enjoy a cold treat and do something good for the environment. *smile* What'll keep you coming back though, are the flavors of ice-cream. Who wants cookies n' cream (although hey they do have it if that's really your thing) when you can indulge in flavors such as Salted Caramel, Toasted coconut, or my new favorite: Brown sugar (that's me) w/ginger caramel swirl. ÊFlavors change daily so you can always find something new to tickle your palette. Ice-cream not really your thing? Popsicle and ice-cream sandwich lovers they have what you're looking for too. They even serve up cupcakes and cookies. Basically, you have no reason not to stop by and try something. And with summer right around the corner it's best to get a taste before that hot weather brings everyone in line.

What can I say that hasn't been said before? We got the Salted Caramel and ricanelas ice cream. Ever since I discovered caramel and salt, my world has never been the same. To find it in ice cream form? Amazing! The ricanelas taste exactly like horchata and comes with a nice surprising crunch of the snickerdoodle cookie. Great service and really patient if you want to sample all the flavors. On another note: I'm jealous of anyone that lives in this area. So many good places to eat all in walking distance!

I came with friends and waited in the line. The line goes by quick as you chat with friends on what flavors you want to try. I got the Berry Sundae because it came with ginger flavored ice cream and I didn't want to settle for a common flavored ice cream. It came with blueberries, whip cream, and granola I think. There was too much whip cream for me, it over powered my ginger ice cream. My friends got the Sam's sundae and the banana sundae or w/e. The Sam's sundae was interesting, just make sure you don't get a mouthful of salt. I like how the bananas are caramelized for the banana sundae. I'm not completely convinced that this place lives up to the hype but I will give it the benefit of the doubt. I think I favor Mitchell's a bit more.

My boyfriend and I stopped by on a sunny Sunday afternoon. The line ended just at the corner, but the wait was only 10 minutes or so. I ordered the Dainty Gent sundae, which is truly the most perfect ice cream treat I've ever had: honey lavender ice cream, blood orange olive oil (omg.), hot fudge, and Maldon sea salt (o.m.g.). They let me order it as a single scoop (typically I think they give you the "double" size), which was the perfect amount. My boyfriend had a scoop of the famed salted caramel, which he LOVED -- and he doesn't even like ice cream that much (I know). He said it brought him back to his childhood and eating burnt sugar candy. Service was great, but the real deal-maker is the shop's proximity to Dolores Park. We took our ice cream and crossed the street to picnic on the lawn. Perfect San Francisco afternoon.

I guess you can put me in there with the rest of the 5 star reviews. ÊFor any first timer, I have to recommend the balsamic strawberry and the salted caramel. ÊTwo of the most unique and delicious flavors you'll ever taste! ÊThe banana is great for those banana lovers b/c it tastes just like it! Warning: Êthe wait can be long. ÊLast time I went with my girlfriends, we lucked out b/c there was no line whatsoever. ÊHowever, I think we started the line b/c we sampled everything in the store! ÊI love how they are so green, using metal spoons so that they can wash them and reuse them. ÊDolores park is just a hop, skip and jump away, which is great to chill and relax in the sun while you're chowing down on Bi-Rite. One of these days, when I want to treat myself out after a good, sweat-dripping workout, I'm going to try one of their sundaes.

I am an ice cream fiend, so visiting Bi-Rite was something to check off my bucket list. I ordered a scoop of salted caramel and one of coffee toffee. They taste exactly as described and are of very good quality. Don't go expecting Baskin Robbins or Cold Stones scoops. The biggest bang for your buck would be one of the cartons, which is also a ticket to cut the line. If you go this route, they also have an incredibly large selection of jarred toppings - salted caramel, chocolate sauce every which way, etc.

Home made ice cream. I always try and make a stop here when I'm in the area. If the line is too long then you can head to the front counter to the Bi Rite store and buy a pint.

Bi-rite, oh how i love thee! I LOVE salted caramel anything, so having salted caramel ice cream is magical indeed! even though it melts faster than other ice cream, so eat up. I also had the Riccanelas (snickerdoodle flavor) which was ok, but not something to trek to SF for. $3.25 for a scoop with two flavors of ice cream is a tad Êmore expensive than other places, but it's worth it! The only downside is that seating inside is limited, and on the super hot day I went, it was crazy hot inside as well.

There was a long line outside so it should be good. Bi-Rite is one of the ice cream places that everyone is raving about. It sure did not disappoint me. There was a long line for the ice cream who wanted to have it in a cone but since I was in a rush, I beat out the long line by going inside the place and picking up a "pre-made" pint or quart ice cream in their refrigerator. I heard that salted caramel is good so I have to buy it. Be prepare to dish out 7.99 for the pint or 15 dollars for their quart. The first bite is heavenly. It does not taste any of those super sweet ice cream. Its taste is a sweet, smooth, creamy, buttery, roasted caramel with a hint of salt. Once I had a bite with it, I cannot stop savoring it. I would not mind having it again, get in the line to feel the experience of waiting in the line, and try their other flavors.

Maybe I'm just not the typical ice-cream fan, but I didn't think Bi-Rite lived up to its hype... and I was also in a snorlax state of mind (sleeping everywhere lol) From what I remembered, my friends and I just shared salted caramel and the honey lavender. The flavors were pretty interesting... I prefer salted caramel over the honey lavender. Both flavors were not too overwhelming, and it tastes exactly what it sounds like. They were both pretty unique, but I realize that I like the more typical ice cream flavors :x This place is pretty comparable to Ici's in Berkeley (which I prefer over Bi-Rite!) Although both ice cream places are comparable, I like Ici's overall texture and consistency over Bi-Rite's. Next time I come here, I'd definitely try the sundaes rather than just scoops of different ice cream flavors. Maybe it'd change my mind (and my taste buds)

I went here a while after we finished eating our Tartine goodies, and they were just opening. Ê Since it was just us, it was nice that we weren't rushed and they let us take our time choosing our ice cream, the ladies there were really lovely! Anyways, I ended up getting the Roasted Banana and the much-mentioned Lavender & Honey ice cream--I actually really loved the latter. The Basil ice cream was surprising as well, but I didn't think I could finish a whole scoop of it, so I decided to not be too adventurous. Just as a side anecdote, the girl helping us out thought we were tourists even though we were from the Bay Area. ÊIt was our first time visiting so it must've been the look of utter confusion and the fact that my friend had a camera hanging around her neck that made it seem like we were from out of town.

I was skeptical at the sight of a line wrapping around the block on a cold summer SF night.... But looking at the numerous yet unordinary flavors on the menu being passed around sparked my curiosity. Still thinking to myself, why does my wife drag me here.. it's just another local ice cream shop. Boy, was I wrong. I ordered the toasted banana with honey lavender while my wife order coffee toffee with salted caramel. These ice cream are FREAKING amazing. Light texture yet rich in flavors.. It was absolutely delightful. The lavender has this perfect balance of being a cool, refreshing dessert while the salted caramel was so flavorful. The toasted banana was awesome, and the coffee toffee was like drinking an high-end coffee with a drop of toffee that brings out some sweetness. I walked away with an extra pint of brown butter pecan for the rest of the week. Definitely would go back... Even with a line wrapping around the block on a cold summer SF night.

What? SF why were you throwing me your minor league eats during the first part of my stay? As 948645 can attest on this site, if you aren't eating Bi-Rite Creamery ice cream, you aren't living right. Either you: a.) have no friends because no one has hipped you to the bliss of creamy love and complete acceptance (you'll never leave me, ice cream!); b.) you are pure evil and are barred from entering into the doors of Bi-Rite; or c.) you haven't been born yet. Because I can't imagine a world in which parents willingly deny their children this ice cream unless they are members of a.) and/or b.) My Bi-Rite experience: Salted Caramel ice cream, Brown Sugar ice cream, Roasted Banana ice cream, Brownie Sundae, Caramel sauce, whipped cream, toasted nuts, cherry, hot summer night, good friends, a wait time that wasn't as bad as forecasted, the sugar shakes, "Are you okay?

Delicious. The roasted banana ice cream was simply one of the best ice creams I've ever had. The mint chip was amazing as well. What I really enjoyed was that the ice cream wasn't overwhelmingly rich - some ice creams I've had are good, but almost impossible to finish even a single scoop because they have such a high cream content. I found that Bi-Rite's tended towards less cream content, almost sorbet-like. It doesn't leave you feeling sick to your stomach. Will definitely be returning when I'm in the city.

This place is awesome. Although I love the other famous ice-cream place in the city too (humphry slocombe) Bi-rite is open late, at least later than H.S. so it gets 5 stars! The ice cream is delicious too. My favorite is earl-grey, it was sooo yummy!! and I also really enjoyed their Lavender Honey. This place also has a line out the door every time even if it's freezing outside. It's really small inside too so it's hard to get a seat, sometimes you have to eat out on the sidewalk but it's worth it. I would normally think the scoop is a little expensive for the size but because the flavors are so unique and delicious I don't mind paying for it. The Hubby and I come here alot at night and we've never had a hard time finding parking but I don't know how it is during the day.

It is not like this place needs another review. But here's my advice: If you loooove their salted caramel, go across the street to their market and buy a pint of it (it comes in larger sizes, too!). I really like the vegan Chocolate Coconut (which was also available at the market when I was there last). Also, the kids size scoop or whatever is really not that small. It's the way to go if you're pretty full from your last meal.

The first time I had Bi-Rite was at the 2010 SF Street Food Festival where I tried the strawberry balsamic ice cream sandwich. The strawberry balsamic ice cream was kind of a let down because I didnt get any balsamic flavor at all, just mostly strawberry which fortunately was still pretty good. The sugar cookies sandwiching the ice cream were also very moist and yummy. More recently, I went to the creamery and tried roasted banana and mint chip. Both were flavor packed! The banana bits running through the roasted banana made the flavor that much more special. While I can appreciate caramel, although I'm not a big fan of it, I found the salted caramel to be too bitter of a flavor. The layout of the creamery makes it easy to get in and out with the roped off line area that leads to the ice cream case which is next to the register. Once you've got your cone(s)/cup(s) or any other sweets in hand and have finished paying, you have the option of sitting inside or on their outdoor benches, if crowds permit.

My experience comes at the soft-serve counter on a Sunday night. ÊWe approach to find that there is a small line. ÊI overhear the girl at the counter saying they only have a couple cones left and "I'm not sure there is even enough for you all." ÊAs we approach the window I mistakenly point at the pints flavors and ask "Are these all the flavors you have?" ÊI'm not a Bi-Rite regular, so don't know how everything works. ÊShe then tells me the three flavors they have and repeats (as she sticks her head out the sliding window) what she said earlier. ÊAt that point, I'm over it. I had the ice cream before, it was nothing to go crazy for and I'm not a huge fan of soft serve, so with the combination of poor customer service, I decided there was no need to spend my money there.

The time finally came and I found myself at the tail of this line (which, around 1030pm, had about 30 people ahead of me). 15 or so minutes later I'm at the front, and by this point you better know what you want- no time for dilly dallying. I settled on two scrumptious, out-of-this-world sounding flavors: Ginger and Earl Grey. Both were bomb and spot-on to their names. Normally "unique" "inspired" dishes like this come out tasting nothing like their namesake, but not so with BiRite's frozen goodies. Both those flavors (Ginger and Earl Grey) tasted just like Ginger and Earl Grey, but not betraying the creamy, sweet and smooth deliciousness of ice cream. They were so great. My friend got "Ricanelas" and it tasted JUST like Horchata! Mmmmmmmmmmmmm.

Con: Long line - about 20+ min (started from the corner) Ê Ê Ê Ê ÊTough to find parking Pro: Great ice cream Ê Ê Ê ÊSampled some various de-lish ice cream I would recommend this place- happy with Honey Lavender & Brown Sugar combo on my 1st visit. Wasn't impressed with balsamic strawberry nor the toasted banana (good thing I tried those flavors before hand making my selection) Missed that no Ginger nor Earl Grey, alas maybe next time

Bi-Rite is a fun place to BE: for the young, old, ice-cream lovers, and ice-cream newbies. ÊI got the single-size cup and let myself indulge in two flavors: Salted Caramel (a crowd favorite) and Toasted Coconut. ÊI'm not a fan of caramel or coconut but these flavors weren't super strong or sweet. ÊThe workers move pretty quick and you get to sample! ÊSo try the Basil Strawberry, the Peach Ginger, Olive Oil flavor (yum), and anything to your heart's desire! Ê(Just keep in mind that there are other people waiting, practically any time of day.) ÊEverything made from scratch--even the olive oil. I love that there's seating space inside for those windy, colder days, even seating right outside the creamery. ÊDolores Park is also across the intersection, so you get a good view of the city (perfect for love birds, friends, and families). ÊThe whole local, family-owned feel in a big city makes everything feel right. I would definitely come here again for a good portioned fix for ice cream. ÊNext time on a warm sunny day, where no fog is to be seen. ÊIndulge a little!

Parking a pain. But damn. Salted caramel is my favorite. It took me a bit to get used to this new taste because it was like eating burnt caramel, but oh boy is it wonderful. Orgasms on my taste buds. Honey lavender was too overpowered by lavender. I just couldn't take it. Balsamic strawberry was okay. I couldn't really taste the balsamic. I had a taster of the roasted banana. Wow is that thing banana-y. I also tried coffee... or was it toffee? Probably coffee.toffee ÊIt was alright, but after a while the toffee was too much. I think i remember the coffee part being a little more bitter than other coffee ice cream. Kinda like vietnamese coffee. I'll have to try it again. I have a love/hate thing with coffee that's bitter like that. I like them sweet! I usually come between 5 and 7. NEVER a line. =)

Standing in line I shuffle my feet against the concrete watching passing hipsters on fixies laugh at me. Seriously a line around the block for ice cream? I guess I am a slave to finding the best. First taste is the Honey Lavender. Cough... Cough.. swallow, wait did I just eat a flower? Nope that is how strange the ice cream tastes here, but I am a sucker for someone taking a culinary chance. Rickanellas gets my top vote. Some I love, some I like, some I think that is just plain weird. But all of the flavors are different and exciting, making me wonder what goes into the craft of real ice cream supremacy. I have a feeling it might be some guy in a basement talking to himself. Either way I hope he keeps doing it.

I may have to come back here to redo this review. The line is long, but it could be because it was a weekend. SF wind + standing in line = cold, but it was wonderful being in line with friends We didn't try any of their famous things because we were just really tired from a whole day of exploring. The mint chocolate chip was good though. It was interesting because it wasn't green so perhaps it was all natural!? haha It's definitely pricey though.

There's nothing more that I like to do than head over to Bi-Rite after a trip to Tartine. I recently had the toasted banana with coffee...and it was amazing. The line moves rather quickly so don't be discouraged if you see a line going out the door. There's a nice park nearby too if you want to sit down and relax while enjoying your ice cream. I have 7x7 to thank again for my visit here.

Ice cream. Yum. Lots of unique, gourmet flavors to choose from. It's more expensive than your typical ice cream scoop, but I think it's worth it. The famed salted caramel is delicious, but got a little too sweet halfway through. I love the coffee toffee though and I'm glad I had that to balance the sweetness of the salted caramel. It's close to Dolores park, so if you're lucky to visit sf on a nice sunny day get a scoop and enjoy it in the park.

WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER! This definitely beats out Humphrey to me. I've been on the ice cream war binge and have tried all the spots in SF for a great scoop. This place is definitely the winner.... great creamy texture (not quite as heavy-cream as humhrey but lighter), more traditional flavors, and even their take home pints taste fresh made. I'm not running in for the salted caramel though.... try RICANELAS. It is this amazingly delicious cinnamon ice cream with pieces of snickerdoodle in it. Yes-- that might not sound amazing (i'm not even a fan of snickerdoodles) but you have to trust me... its out of this world.

Visitor's Perspective: With NYC currently under the onslaught of frozen yogurt chains, I mam just happy to get away from it and get back to basics - ice cream. A first time San Francisco visit would not be complete without visiting a cool dessert spot, especially one with 3,000-plus Yelp reviews. Ê While the salted caramel seems to be an overwhelming favorite, the pumpkin sundae was just unbelievable. It totally hit the spot after a mediocre sushi dinner. Unfortunately, I can only surmise that this is a seasonal item so I would say that I visited at the most opportune moment. A special shout out to the amazingly friendly gentleman behind the counter who basically responded "Thanks for coming and God Bless You" simply because I requested an extra spoon. God Bless? You San Franciscans are just wonderful.

There will always, ALWAYS be a line. That's just the way it is, and that should be enough of a review. But I will add that, in addition to the fabulous normal ice cream (I won't even bother to elaborate, just go), there are also great dairy-free options! I recommend getting over to the street in the early-evening mid-week (so that you have a chance at a table) for dinner at Pizzaria Delfina, saving some room for dessert and ambling down the block to Bi-Rite Creamery. If it's cold, suck it up or sit in a car or just take it home--or you can try to grab one of the few seats they have inside the little space. If it's warm, you're in luck, cause you can sit outside, but the line will also be astronomically long.

Ok, I'll admit, I didn't really know what all the hype was about the first time or two I had Bi-Rite. ÊI certainly didn't understand the lines out the door nearly every night or why people were willing to fight for parking to come here. My last 3 visits, though, have made me see the light. ÊIt's true, Bi-Rite is exceptionally delicious! ÊWith a healthy offering of unique flavors, a changing menu, and unrivaled creaminess, I understand why people are crazy about this place. ÊNot to mention that all the ice cream is made on site - how cool is that? Here are my favs: Roasted Banana - 5/5 - Probably my favorite! ÊUnlike a lot of banana ice creams, there is nothing at all artificial-tasting about Bi-Rite's roasted banana. ÊIt's just the right amount of flavor and sweetness. Orange Cardamom - 5/5 - I'm a fiend for cardamom. ÊI absolutely love the stuff and was destroyed when Bombay Ice Creamery closed its doors a few months ago. ÊSO glad Bi-Rite has this in the mix! ÊIt's delicious like Bombay's, but even creamier. ÊI was a little hesitant about the orange, but you can't even really taste it. Ê Toasted Coconut - 4/5 - Delicious coconut ice cream! ÊActually, probably some of the best coconut ice cream I've had. ÊMinus a star only because it lacks that wow factor of some of the other flavors. Here are the other flavors I've tried: Brown Sugar and Ginger - I'm not going to give this a star rating because the reason I disliked this is unfair. ÊI hate ginger. ÊI am a ginger-hound and can detect even trace amounts of ginger in food. ÊIt's a curse. ÊBUT, the bf was blown away by this flavor and absolutely loved it, even though he doesn't much care for ginger either. ÊSo as long as you don't hate ginger, you may love it too. Salted Caramel - I know people are crazy for this stuff, but I didn't love it. ÊHundreds of people can't really be wrong though, so I'd at least try it.

My friends and I walked all the way from Coit Tower to try the ice cream (we wanted the exercise). Was it worth it? Oh yes. I had a single with both the coffee toffee and the balsamic strawberry. The coffee toffee was very rich with real toffee pieces and the balsamic strawberry was somewhat lighter with an interesting subtle flavor of something else (maybe the balsamic part?). I also sampled a friend's salted caramel, which I thought was a bit on the rich side. The only reason this place gets knocked down a star in my book is because of the long wait (took 15-20 minutes waiting in line before stepping up to the counter) and the price. I didn't expect it to be cheap and this is probably some of the best ice cream I've had, but $3.50 for 2 smallish scoops (not Ben & Jerry's size) wasn't great from a value perspective.

Even though I live in Southern California, I still crave their Salted Caramel ice cream cone! This place is located in San Francisco at the Mission District.

I'm sure you have all heard, but the salted caramel is great! I also tried the earl grey and I love it! When I came, there was parking right out front and no lines at all (random weekday around 3 pm ish). After my sister and I ordered, we sat outside on their benches to eat our ice cream. Sadly, my sister's top scoop of ice cream SLIPPED off and landed on the concrete. It was truly a sad sight to see hahaha. But she went back inside and they gladly re-scooped some ice cream for her. Cool!

Dear yelp journal, It feels odd to me to review an ice cream shop because it seems like something that shouldn't be reviewed, kind of like reviewing a gas station or something. ÊHowever, this place really deserves kudos. ÊIf my opinion isn't enough, ask the other ten+ people waiting in line and the other members of their party sitting in their cars waiting for their "chosen one" to deliver the goods. First off, I saw that cheesie movie with Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin "It's Complicated" and they were eating honey lavender ice cream. ÊI thought to myself, "Wow, that sounds really interesting, and I'd like to try that." ÊAfter having a delicious brunch, my gal pals wanted to come here for dessert, as it was a particularly sunny and beautiful day. ÊWe spent forever looking for parking (someone even backed into my car to try to squeeze into a parking spot - something to note if you're driving here. ÊParking sucks). Ê We got into line and the shop willingly gives you samples of the flavors once you get inside. ÊThe line moves quickly. ÊThey have a menu on the wall outside the door, so you can decide what you want to speed up the process or have some samples once you get in. ÊVery efficient. I saw their menu and they had HONEY LAVENDER. ÊIt was like one of those moments where it felt like "The Secret" actually works. ÊPutting a wish into the universe and having it get granted. Once tasted, it was POWERFULLY lavender. ÊMight not be so great for people who associate lavender with soap. ÊI had it paired off with the earl grey, which I think is sweet and neutral enough that it would be a great base to mix with any flavor. ÊIt's even good enough to have just by itself. ÊI wouldn't have minded. Anyway, the price is a little bit high, but the quality is totally worth it. ÊThe ice cream is creamy, rich in flavor, and the workers there are super nice and polite. ÊIf it weren't so good, I probably would not have spent the time reviewing it.

Now that I've been to Humphrey Slocombe's and to Mrs. and Mrs. Miscellaneous several times, I can review Bi-Rite's with a more well-rounded perspective. As San Franciscans, we're spoiled when it comes to ice cream, so it's tough for an ice cream joint to stand out. So my review is going to be comparative, because Bi-Rite's is only as good as its San Francisco competition, right? Location: I'm totally biased. Not only did I grow up 1/2 block away on Oakwood & 18th, but I am in love with Dolores Park. This is one of the most beautiful areas of San Francisco. Selection: Bi-Rite has a much wider selection of ice cream than H.S. and Mr/Mrs, which rotate 10 flavors daily. Bi-Rite's menu is ideal if you have a favorite flavor that you like sticking to. Taste: Bi-Rite masters the balance between unique flavor offerings that also taste good. IMO, Humphrey's tends to be hit-or-miss and tries too hard to be different. But everything from Bi-Rite has been delish! My favorite combo at the moment is roasted banana with salted caramel. A deliciously magical combination! They score equally to Mr/Mrs in this respect. Other top flavor contenders.... - Balsamic strawberry: Didn't taste like vinegar at all, which is probably a good thing. The strawberry was ultra creamy and velvety :) - Coffee toffee: More coffee than toffee. Coffee ground is sprinkled throughout, giving it a kick. But it totally works :) The only reason I don't visit Bi-Rite more often is because the lines are insanely long! My sisters and I tried going during last week's heat wave, but when we drove past and saw the line wrapped around the block, there was a resounding "Oh HEEELLL no!!" in the car. So we turned around and went to Mr and Mrs. You make me sad, Bi-Rite. Why must you have so many fans!? You should consider selling Express Passes, like the ones they sell at Great America that let you cut to the front of the line. I'd pay extra not to have to wait in line. If you decide to implement my idea, I will accept payment in ice cream. So sadly, I'm limited to enjoying their tasty treats only on cold evenings (when there is no wait), since I refuse to wait hours for ice cream, delicious as it may be. But considering their ultra-hip Dolores Park location, I'm not surprised they're the most popular kid on the block :)

Simply the best ice cream I've ever had, period. ÊYou can't over-hype. Over-hyping this place would be like over-hyping the experience of your wedding day or having your first child. I got the snickerdoodle and salted caramel...AMAZING. ÊNot too rich, not too sweet, perfect creaminess, and perfect flavor. This place beats ICI in Berkeley by a mile, plus service is 100% better, as they patiently let you try numerous flavors. I would give it 6 stars if I could, and I don't even like sweets that much.

Why aren't you closer to me, Bi-RIte? I was in the neighborhood, and I randomly looked up nearby places on yelp, and this wonderful creamery came up. I had the vegan chocolate coconut, and I swear that it just tasted like ice cream. If I were an actual vegan, I would've probably gotten nervous, question myself, and then ask the guy at the counter to make sure that it was vegan. IT WAS DELICIOUS. I didn't even think chocolate could mesh that well with coconut, but it damn sure did. Four stars simply because I've only tried one flavor and the wait was long. I'll probably update it to five once I go again and try all flavors in one sitting. Just kidding...but not really.

Dear Bi-Rite, I'm so glad we met. I think about you often and I love our monthly get togethers. I tell all my friends about you and how awesome you are. Although unlike every other person on the planet, I am not too crazy about the salted caramel, although that's really just a personal preference. ;) It saddens me when you don't have some of my seasonal or discontinued favorites, notably the white chocolate blackberry swirl. I may have died and gone to heaven when I tried it. I won't hold it against you that you don't have it anymore, since you've subsituted it with new tasty flavors. ;) I do consistently love the ricanelas and a new favorite is brown butter pecan. Your servers are friendly and they get a tip when I'm buzzed after some drinks with dinner. They get an extra tip when they let me try 10 flavors before I make up my mind. Until we meet again... Fondly yours, Me

Sadly, I'm not so positive (as most) on Bi-Rite creamery - for two reasons: (1) There is ALWAYS a line-up. I would get off my work shuttle across the street from here every single day and the line up would be around the block. When I want ice cream, I'm not waiting 20 minutes (sadly!) irrespective of how good it is. They either need to scoop faster or get more people working there! (2) The ice cream really isn't THAT great. I've had the chocolate, salted caramel and toasted banana and while they are creamy and definitely unique, they were not that awesome, and definitely not worth the wait. I almost feel bad about this review because everyone else is so positive on this place. If you really want their ice cream, forget the line-up and head to Bi-Rite market and get a tub of it to take home.

So, there's a Church just around the corner which my BF and I go to on Sundays. For some reason, we always tend to make a stop at BI-RITE before or after Church. I'm starting to think my BF is using Church as an excuse for a chance to get some of this DELICIOUS ice cream! We have been here almost every Sunday now that I'm a little embarrass to check in each time because I'm suppose to be on a diet! shhh! =X But, we just can't resist! The salted caramel and the coffee toffee taste so heavenly with their freshly whipped cream and bittersweet hot chocolate. The malted vanilla with peanut brittle is good when you get enough of that peanut brittle with each scoop. It doesn't matter how freezing, windy, chilly, and cold it is outside, Bi-Rite always has a line. But, if you don't want to wait in the long line, just go straight in, open their fridge, and grab a pint of your choice. You don't have to wait in line for the pints. If you can't finish it, save the rest for a midnight snack! GENIUS! ;0) I still have some left in the freezer. On second thought, maybe not! BF might have beaten me to it.

While I do appreciate all the unique flavors that bi-rite offers such as salted caramel, roasted banana, and malted vanilla, the reason I give it 4 stars rather 5 stars is it is kind of pricey for what you get and the flavors can be a little too sweet for me. The salted caramel is super good, but it is pretty decadent and I definitely cannot have a full serving of it. The roasted banana was the same. The malted vanilla was really good, I love the little bits of crunch, and it actually wasn't too sweet for me. I wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but I definitely don't mind going if I'm in the area.

Discovered this place a year or two ago and have been dropping in with out-of-towners and newbs ever since! Favorite hands down is Ricanelas, snickerdoodle ice cream. They have the BEST Sundaes, berry compote is a must. TIP: Lines stink, so if you're hankering and know what you want w/out the frills, skip the line and grab a pint to go... just as good =) A little pricey, but oh so delicious!

Last stop on our badunkaversary. We came here because it is famous on Yelp. Let's just start off saying that we've had some pretty good ice-cream in our time (i.e. Ici's, Tara's, etc.). The decorations are really nice, and it's a lot more festive than any other ice-cream place that we've been to. The line wasn't too long, and it moved quickly. We stood in line, stomachs bulging, looking at the menu. We were a little bit hesitant because we were scared to go beyond the tipping point of fullness, but we just had to try it. We got a double-scoop with: - Brown sugar with ginger caramel: overall good flavours, but a bit too sweet. The real ginger they used was pretty good, but the sugar overpowered the quality of the ingredients. - Ricanelas (cinnamon & snicker-doodle): I actually just don't think cinnamon ice-cream sounds appealing. Celia why did you choose that one? I don't know. That was a bad decision :( Ê Ê /stream-of-consciousness The scoops are HUGE though-- it's a pretty good price for quality ice-cream. When we paid, the cashier asked whether we were eating here or to go, but he'd already handed me a to go cup, so I wondered what the difference was. Then he informed me of the eat-in tax, which made me indignant, but Celia said it made sense because they were "internalizing an externality." We would come here again, but only if we're in the neighbourhood. Otherwise, we would rather stop by Ici's or Tara's in Berkeley.

After trying Bi-Rite, I scream for ice cream- it's absolutely DELICIOUS. On a rare sunny day in SF, the line to get in was very long, but well worth the wait. I was only in town visiting for a few days, but knew I had to see for myself how amazing ice cream could really be. ÊMy friend recommended trying Honey Lavender, and Salted Caramel...I easily scarfed down a scoop of each. The Honey Lavender flavor is the most unique and delicious ice cream I've ever had. It tastes exactly how it sounds- though eating lavender flavored anything might sound unappealing, believe me, your taste buds will disagree. The honey balances the lavender, in the most exquisite dance two flavors could ever engage in (on your tongue, that is). And of course, Salted Caramel, which is amazing- tastes like fresh caramel, straight off the stove, with a balanced, slightly salty/sweet taste...mmm. I'd love to try some of the other flavors the next time I'm in town..my mouth just waters thinking about the amazingly delicious ice cream at Bi-Rite-- Êperfectly creamy, all natural and organic-as the slogan goes, "good to the last lick' (or scarfed down bite/slurp)!

A friend recommended this place to me, but didn't express the absolute NEED to visiti; I'm soooo glad I decided to stop in. Judging from the rope dividing the store entrance/exit, there's usually a line, but even though it was 1pm or so, we were the only ones waiting. ÊI decided on Ricanelas cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodles, and brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl. ÊBecause I was on vacation, I went all crazy and had it topped with hot fudge, but the ice cream was so frickin' delicious that the fudge was completely unnecessary. ÊThe flavors were just what was promised, and creamy and rich. ÊThere was a vegan flavor and a sorbet, too. The inside of Bi-Rite was small but cute, and I'm guessing usually swarmed with people. ÊOnly complaint: the water fountain didn't squirt high enough to actually drink out of. ÊAnd that's all I've got in the negativity department. ÊTotally worth risking my lactose-intolerant digestive system.

Okay, so when I first had their ice cream (a combination of coffee, creme fraiche, and malted vanilla) I had mixed feelings. The coffee and creme fraiche were okay -- definitely not worth the line when push came to shove. However, that malted vanilla -- that I would (and did) wait in the long line for. Unfortunately, this was before I had tried Humphrey Slocombe's tahitian vanilla. Because the game changed completely after that experience. When I went back to Bi-Rite's for their malted vanilla, I was shockingly underwhelmed and disappointed. Nothing would ever be as good as Humphrey's. In conclusion, this place is worth a three. But only if your virgin tongue has not touched Humphrey's. Otherwise, the long lines and the overratedness of the place knock it down to two. Just go to Humphrey's already.

So I'm totally procrastinating with writing b/c for some crazy reason, I decided to go back to school. Turning to yelp is an escape because 1) i don't need a well defined research question, and 2) i don't need to explain the significance of my research. Though I will probably need to work on this if I want funding to buy some ice cream. Bi-Rite Creamery really doesn't need another review, but I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place. Can't get any better than this (well, I do have other fav ice cream shops in the city), but no one has the salted caramel or the roasted banana flavors. Two of my favorite flavors. I can't really give suggestions of when to avoid the line, there's always a line but it's fast. The staff is really good at getting your order and making sure that you have your cup or cone in a hot sec. If it's a nice day, head over to Dolores Park and chill there.

That is, until I had a bite of my roommate's pint of snickerdoodle ice cream. I get it now. They put crack in their ice cream, in the form of sugary cinnamon-y explosions of goodness within each frosty bite. Its so f'ing good I'm waxing lyrical in this very email about it. I think this may be the beginning of a very unhealthy obsession, and of course my knee is injured so I can't even run off the pints I will consume all in one sitting - because that scenario is most definitely imminent in my future.

They also offer a punch card too, which is always a nice plus. Go grab yourself a cone and walk around Dolores Park afterwards!

I walked down the street to this place after eating at Pizzeria Delfina for what I heard was some of the BEST ice cream I could get in SF. I was pretty skeptical but decided to go anyways since it was down the street. I am not big on ice cream or desserts in general, but this ice cream was DELISH I got the cookies and cream and my gf got the coffee toffee ice cream. The cookies and cream was perfect, thats the only way I can describe it My gf loves coffee ice cream and said that this place was the best she's had.

I had no idea where this place actually was. Seeing Bi-Rite written on the wall, I was heading to the little run down market to get some of their well known hand-made ice cream. Little did I know, what I saw wasn't really the real creamery. Strolling along, there was a little store that had red ropes for line control. Then reading the sign above, it said "...home-made ice cream". Then I was like, "wth?" It says Bi-Rite Creamery... Stepped in and the place is quite small, as I already knew from some of the pictures. Clean and traditional inside. Friendly service of course. Plenty of flavors to try out. As many people already know, their salted caramel was the one to try. Delicious and that salt wasn't over powering and it wasn't terribly sweet. Light and creamy in the mouth. Their sorbet is also tart and refreshing. I also had their roasted banana and that was good too. Had hints of smoky roast and their tones of banana. Sweet and enjoyable. I'll definitely come back.

Roasted Banana is my everything. Not joking. It's the only ice cream I will go out of my way to get. I always want to get that + one new flavor every time I go to Bi-Rite, but then I find that Balsamic Strawberry and Salted Caramel are just so delicious too that I end up forcing my friends to get the other flavors I want to try and just mooching off of them. Honey Lavender is also delicious, but I'm not much of a fan of such... fragrant-tasting things, I guess you'd call it (I mean I don't like Jasmine tea either so if that kind of thing floats your boat then go for it!). Always get at least two flavors. I don't remember if they've always had so many tables inside but I like it! It's also conveniently located next to Dolores Park so just go over there and eat your ice cream and enjoy the nice San Francisco sun while it lasts! As for me, I'm pretty sure I'm going to be there every single week this summer. Hopefully I'll be able to resist getting my usual roasted banana + salted caramel combo and try some more of their other flavors... See you there! :)

Bi-Rite Creamery is a famous ice cream spot located in the Mission District. They hand make their ice cream, soft serve, and baked goods in small batches. And you can really taste the difference! The ice creams are extremely soft and creamy without any annoying ice particles. My favorite flavors are the honey lavender and toasted coconut. Unfortunately, their famous salted caramel is not for me since I don't like the resulting bitterness after mixing sweet and salty together. But at least sample it when you're there! You might think it's the best thing ever! We'll often get the toffee chocolate chip cookie to go with our ice cream. Very good cookies, but not the best I've ever had. Also, I have never tried their soft serve at the window next door since their ice cream is just too good. This is a must-stop in SF regardless of the long lines. I would definitely try to stop here anytime I'm remotely close to the Mission. All in all, this particular block of 18th St simply has too much deliciousness going on (Tartine Bakery and Pizzeria Delfina)!

Back to five stars for Bi-Rite Creamery. I had to undo the bad juju from the brownie sundae last week, so this time I had a banana split. Dark chocolate ice cream was cheerfully subbed in at my request. The carmelized bananas went perfectly with the ice cream, the syrup and the whipped cream. Yummy yummyness.

OH MY GOODNESS, OHMYGAHD, when I scream for ice cream, I SCREAM FOR BI-RITE ICE CREAM! seriously. I was on my way to Dolores Park when lo- and behold, I pass by my longingly waited to be visited Yelp bookmarked, Bi-Rite Creamery. Thanks to Yelpers' 4000+ raving reviews, I have been longing to give this place a try... I cried with excitement, jumped with joy, and literally ran into line at the site of this innocent little creamery. I am typically wary of hype, but no... one sample and I assure you that you'll be hooked, as was I. 5-star ORGASM: - Salted Caramel - Honey Lavender 4-star NOMMMMMMM: - Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl - Roasted Banana - Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces 3-star YUMMMM: - Strawberry Mint (popsicle) 2-star YUM: - Cantaloupe (popsicle) Pretty much everything was good. I got the Salted Caramel&Honey Lavender... slightly odd combo, but they were so good! Actually, it was a very strange combo, probably will stick with complimentary flavors next time... like the bi-rite suggested triple threat: salted caramel, brown sugar, and coffee toffee or the lavender and peach ginger. Salted Caramel and Honey Lavender we're both orgasmic though, definite safe bets on nom-ness... nommmmm. I probably wouldn't recommend, or plan on getting another popsicle.. but there's no wait for pre-made items like popsicles, and there was a long line wrapping around the corner on our return from the park... yes, that's right, I did go TWICE within one day! And I would've gone for a third run if I could. I am determined to try all their flavors and to reach Bi-Rite bliss, plus to get my free scoop after 10 purchases! GO GO GO, if you haven't been already! NOM.

Jeebus! Hands down the best ice creamery in SF for the time being-until proven otherwise. This place leaves me wanting for more. So much more that I would buy pintfuls of ice cream (cookies and cream) and gorge it down to the very last oreo? cookie crumb in one sitting. I absof**kinglutely love their earl grey, honey lavender and salted caramel ice cream too. So yummy! I am going to die. There is so much flavor, creaminess, and richness to their ice creams that make it so wonderful. And what's not better than to have a beautiful park, the Dolores park just one cross street away?! There, I can have my ice cream and eat it too. Ok, so the only downfall I have for this place is the ridiculous line that stretches around the block and makes it down two more blocks. Seriously, just prepare yourself to wait for a long, long time if you have the patience. And once you are there, just buy like gallons of ice cream to store you up until your next trip there. It'll be worth it.

Bi Rite has a deal with the devil. That's got to be the reason. There is no way on earth that you can make ice cream so creamy, so smooth, so silky, so much better than everyone else. People will say its the milk, but I mean come on! Do they have some secret cows that lactate better milk? What the heck? Bi Rite has a deal with the devil. That's got to be the reason. How else do you make ice cream that gets softer, not harder in the freezer?? What mad alchemy is this? Adding more sugar? Been there, done that. There's no way this makes things softer in the freezer, no frickin' way. The first time you try Bi Rite, your mouth is wondering what the heck you just ate. I mean no way on earth is this ice cream. It is like nothing you've had before. With each succeeding mouthful you begin to realize that, hey, this is ice cream, this is what real ice cream taste like. At last. Then you realize you've finished the whole pint. Salted Caramel. If you have tried it, no words are necessary. If you haven't tried it, you are a dunce.

Being that this was my first time in SF, I wanted to try the best bites [at an affordable price] and Bi-Rite definitely did not disappoint. Small little set-up off the side of a street in Mission. There was a decently sized line leading out of the shop, nothing I've never encountered. What I loved about this place? They didn't give you dinky little plastic spoons for samples like the ice cream places in SoCal - they give you full-on dinner spoons and huge sample servings. I went with the Toffee Coffee, and OH MY MOTHER!! Huge chunks of toffee nuggets and coffee'ized coffee ice cream. There was ground coffee IN the ice cream to give it the super duper extra aromatic flavor that kicks you in the face. Sure, the ice cream was more expensive than say, the likes of Rite-Aid, and was even pricier than the likes of Baskin-Robbins and Fosselmans, but who am I kiddin'? Why am I even comparing such great ice cream to such basic, low quality junk like the aforementioned joints? Bi-Rite - I will be sure to visit you every time I go to SF - you are FAR TOO LOVELY to pass up. LOVE IT!

I happen pass by this place, saw a line, so we thought that we should try it. I got a small cone with 2 small scoops. I had cherry chocolate which was delicious, and a vanilla cookie, was good too. I tried the salted caramel, since there are a lot of people saying that it was awesome, however, am not a fan. Still too sweet to me. We had 2 small cones, and totally like 5 bucks some. The texture of the ice cream is pretty good, not icy but also not too creamy. I I would say B&J is too rich for me, after one scoop, am done, Bi-rite, I may have 2 scoops. Recommend to eat in store if you got a lot of ice cream, they get melted very fast. Overall, it is a good ice cream place, but don't hold too high expectation, it is just ice cream anyway.

Okay, I am a total cliche. I saw this place featured on the Food Network's "Best Thing I ever Ate" and of course I got sucked in. It had been a year in the making - my faithful pilgrimage to Bi-Rite Creamery. And...the salted caramel was simply scrumptious. I know this sounds lame - but it literally tasted like salted caramel. Fabulous! The Sam's Sundae I was salivating to try...well, it was alright. I completely appreciate the quality of the ingredients, but the combo of chocolate ice cream, salt, olive oil and whipped cream just didn't win me over. That is not to say others don't love it, because they really do - but my palate although appreciative, has no interest in having it again. I think the salt was over kill for me. The whipped cream was a delight however, very fresh indeed. I will be all over the salted caramel again and ÊI hope the roasted banana will be available next time too. I also want to try the honey lavender since I love the one at Ici (Oakland) so much. I tried my boyfriend's mint chocolate chip and that was delicious as well. Truly a top quality creamery with a very nice staff. When we went, we were lucky, the line was minimal, but it is funny to see a roped line all the way down the block. It's like you're waiting to get into a nightclub. ÊWOW, clearly they must be really busy. Parking is a nightmare, so be warned. Overall take on the place - enjoyable. I mean who doesn't love amazing high-quality sweet fatty goodness? I of course loved the ginormous pink ice cream cone structure above the entrance too.

While this page was loading I was pondering to myself about this place probably having a bunch of great reviews already and if I should write or not.. And then up pops that Bi-Rite has over 3,000 reviews!! ÊWow! They deserve it too! ÊI went the other day after a day of shopping in the city to be peasantly treated to a delicious bowl of salted caramel and cookies and cream ice cream, topped with HOMEMADE brownie bites (a lot of them too), HOMEMADE hot fudge (that actually hardened like real fudge), and HOMEMADE whipped cream... Mmmmmmm I was NOT missing that high fructose corn syrup on this sundae! Ê It was amazingly great and totally worth the $6.50 I paid. ÊThe employees were all really cool too and totally social and awesome even though it was freezing and probably 45 degrees. Definitely will go back!

I'm a self-proclaimed VIP at Bi-Rite. I've gone through about 15 punch cards and have acquired a muffin-top as a badge of honor. I've tried it all (with the exception of Sam's Sundae - I know, what am I waiting for!?) and they're all mmmmazing! I'm lactose intolerant and my body throws a tantrum every time.

All I have to say is SALTED CARAMEL ICE CREAM!!! Talk about LOVE at FIRST BITE!!!! :) In my weekend in SF i went back 3 times! I also tried to beg southwest if I can hand carry my ice cream to San Diego because I bought a pint and could not finish it. Sadly I could not bring it with me, even with my idea of packing dried ice on my carry on :( wahhhh!!! I had to leave my pint with my auntie and savor my last bite before I left.... I love everything salted caramel now (they even have salted caramel hot chocolate at starbucks!!! yumm) but nothing beats Bi-Rites ice-cream!!! p.s. this ice cream is pricey but worth it!

Salted caramel ice cream anyone? ÊFricken' awesome! Came here with friends after being told by other friends that it was a 'must-visit' spot. ÊNot disappointed.

Would probably add another star were it not so overhyped. Ice cream was good and worth the wait and hour of circling around for parking if your intent is to lounge in Dolores on a particularly sunny day, but not quite craving-worthy on it's own... Ordered: Salted Caramel- to be fair, ever since having a life changing caramel ice cream experience in Argentina I have been rather picky...nevertheless this was good but I really didn't feel it lived up to the hype.. Honey Lavender- hm if you like the idea of tasting soap/potpourri, this ones for you...felt like I was eating ice cream in my grandmas bathroom Roasted Banana- good Malted Vanilla w/Peanut Brittle- good... Love how they embellish their average ice cream by going into full hipster mode with their flavor combos (i.e bergamot olive oil, sea salt, and whipping cream)...hmm next stop Mitchells!

Ice cream is my ultimate downfall in life ... I cannot resist it and wish I could eat it everyday. Bi-rtie is now my favorite ice cream parlor! When I had my first bite of salted caramel ... I was speechless!! Well, actually I did say something ... OMG ... yummm!! And that's all I said until there was no more ice cream. Every bite was followed with umm. We arrived sometime after 10PM on a rainy cold Saturday night in SF and there was still a line out the door! I cannot imagine what the line is like any other time of day. If you buy pints of ice cream though you can bypass the line all together. I had to try everything! So embarrassing .... when we got to the counter I handed the girl two large containers and one pint and she proceeded to ring me up and gave me a total, until I told her we weren't done and kept handing her carton after carton of ice cream. ÊWe bought two huge containers of salted caramel and a vanilla plus a pint of coffee toffee, mexican chocolate, and ricanelas. Overall, I spent $70 on ice cream!! Who does that?? I didn't get to try the balsamic strawberry or banana though ... but don't worry I will be back!! =) I will be traveling to SF more often now just so I can eat salted caramel ice cream from Bi-rite! Now all I have to do is devise a plan to get it back to LA. Any suggestions? =)

Yum... On a hot hot day, nothing beats bi-rite ice cream. I went for the requisite salted caramel and toasted banana and topped it all off with hot fudge and the almond toffee (quadruple yum)... I know much has been said about the salted caramel and the toasted banana but let me put in my 2 cents about the almond toffee: You HAVE to get it. I see so many of you walk away with a scoop of one thing or another and I think about how incomplete your lives must be if you haven't tried this topping. It is like the yin to your yang (the crunch to the soft creaminess of the ice cream.) Take it from me: Brave the line (again) and order the make your own sundae and top it off with the almond toffee.

FINALLY FINALLY got to go. After years of hearing about BiRite I finally managed to be in the neighborhood while craving ice cream. Flavors, creaminess, service and speed put it as one of my favorites in SF. Perhaps not quite as many choices as other places, or as experimental, but what they do is excellent. I went with 3 different scoops, Coffee Toffee, Salted Caramel and Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl. Absolutely wonderful. My favorites of those three were the salted caramel and the brown sugar which went together particularly well. Their honey lavender was also very interesting as was the Earl Grey. This is definitely a place to go any time you are in the Mission.

After checking out Humphry Slocombe and Ici in Berkeley, I had to try Bi-Rite Creamery. ÊIt's definitely harder to find parking here compared to Humphry Slocombe and the lines are long (but not as long as Ici's), but the wait was really worth it! A single size (1-2 flavors) is equivalent to a 1 scoop at Humphry Slocombe or Ici's. ÊI like the fact that we can have two flavors for the price of once flavor at other places. Ê I got the lavender honey and earl gray on a cone. ÊIt was awesome! ÊIf only it had the same chocolate filled cone as Ici's. It's a tough call but Bi-Rite and Ici's lavender honey and earl gray were equally good... the deal breaker for me is the cone and Ici's chocolate filled cone makes them a winner in my book. ÊWith that said, Bi-Rite is a good runner up and I would definitely be back.

Finally got to try this place on a nice sunny Sunday :) Perfect for ice cream, but that meant a lot of people were thinking the same thing.. o_o DON'T LEAVE BECAUSE THE LINE LOOKS TOO LONG. Once you take the first bite you will think to yourself , "this...was... SO WORTH IT!!!". TRUST MEEE! The wait really wasn't that long. It wrapped around the corner and went a bit down the street. But I think we waited about 20 minutes. When you have company 20minutes goes by very fast. I've been getting into Salted Caramel flavored things so it was awesome that their "flavor to try" was the Salted Caramel flavored ice cream!! I also ordered the Roasted Banana flavor. Both flavors were excellent! Craving some right now... *drool. I love banana flavored ice cream, or banana flavored anything in fact. The Salted Caramel they said was going to be a lot softer because of the high percentage of sugar, and it sure was soft and creamy and just awesome :) This is a great location. You can enjoy it after or before visiting/chilling in Dolores Park which is just across the street.

Bi-Rite's regular ice cream is to die for -- i.e., worth waiting in a 30+ minute line wrapped around the block on a chilly evening -- so when they opened the soft serve window, I was skeptical -- because, really, what could be better than salted caramel ice cream? Well, I'll tell you: it's called SALTED CARAMEL SOFT SERVE. No words exist to describe the deliciousness of this stuff -- it's incredible on its own, but salted caramel + chocolate swirl = the best combination ever (who thought of this??). It's that good! Oh, and the other flavors are pretty great, too.

So after a day filled with Impressionistic art, I wanted ice cream. I managed to convince the bf to take me to Bi-Rite as we've never been there before. We bumped into a friend at the end of a fairly short line and hung out for a bit. The BF made his own mix while I tried the Salted Caramel, Honey Lavender, and Cinnamon. OMG. HAPPINESS IN A CUP. The Honey Lavender was sweet and creamy while the Salted Caramel had a slight burnt ending. But, unexpectedly, my favorite was the Cinnamon one. It was rich and light and just OMG! delicious. You can pick up pints of their ice cream as well. The workers are fast and friendly so the line moves pretty quickly. A must go to as their ice cream is amazing!

I seriously wish I lived in San Francisco so I can eat here all the time and get fat. The ice cream here is soo amazingly good! My friend has been hyping this place up for months, so on our recent trip to SF, we had to stop by to see what it was all about. It was freezing the night we stopped by. We couldn't find decent parking, so a few of us ran in to get ice cream while the others idled in the car. Flavors I tried: Coffee Toffee - I have a weak spot for coffee flavored ice cream and this one hits the spot. The balance of coffee ice cream and toffee crunch is wonderful! Salted Caramel - By far my FAVORITE flavor here. Where can I get salted caramel ice cream in Orange County?!?! Ricanela - cinnamon and snickerdoodle cookies! If you love snickerdoodles (which I do), you must try this one. Honey Lavender - I'm going to admit that this isn't a favorite of mine. A little too flowery for me, but I heard that this is an acquired taste. I ended up getting 2 scoops in the smallest cup of Coffee Toffee and Salted Caramel. I scraped up every little bit. I'm drooling just thinking about it now. I love how they use silverware as taster spoons so we aren't adding those little plastic spoons to the landfills. Cups are biodegradable too. Earth conscious bunch here. :) Lovin' the friendly service and interestingly tasty flavors. You gotta try it!

Voted on of the best ice cream places by many review articles out there, it's no question that Bi-Rite is simply "As good as it gets!" With unique flavors made daily at the creamery, Bi-Rite is sure to satisfy everyones' craving. I always hit this place up when traveling to San Francisco. With all the buzz surrounding it, there's often a line out the door that comes with the trouble of finding parking. There is the creamery itself and the less busy soft serve stand to the side of it. They have set flavors as well as seasonal flavors that range from Mexican Chocolate to Balsamic Strawberry. They also sell goodies on the side such as cookies and ice cream sandwiches. Although if you go there to just pick up a pint, don't wait in line and grab one out of the fridge and pay for it at the counter.=] I usually get Honey Lavender, it's sweet with a hint of lavender that leaves me wanting more! I also enjoy the toasted coconut and balsamic strawberry. They cook the strawberries in balsamic vinegar- this makes the sweetness of the strawberries stronger. It's close to the Bi-Rite market so unless you want to go to both locations, don't mix the two up. It's definitely a place to stop at while on your trip to S.F.! Happy Eatings! =]

My first ice cream stop in the bay area. And after all the other ice cream I had, I have to say that this one left a mark in my heart. Corny. So what? The Ricanelas+ Balsamic Strawberry. Agh! And I love how the samples are given with metal spoons. I know that has nothing to do with what I think about the ice cream. But hey, it helped me remember my experience vividly.

This review should really be 3.5 I was so hyped up to try Bi-Rite after reading pages of reviews and hearing about it from everyone I know whose tried it. Sadly, it didnt not meet my expectations at all. I sampled a handful of the flavors and none of them really had that "wow factor"..I didnt even bother sampling the salted caramel cuz I just wanted to get it, thinking that it was the most popular flavor. Regretted my choice immediately of not trying it first, before thinking that I would like it. I just felt was was a bit too sweet, it was good but not great. I think the best one there was the earl grey ice-cream. I also wished that they had more unique flavors to choose from. It was nice to try, but really nothing worth coming back for.

Go on a Wednesday. No line. Best thing ever. This was good, especially for my first time, because I was able to try many of the flavors without feeling rushed by a line. I ended up getting the brown sugar ginger by recommendation of the server and my mom got the salted caramel and toffee coffee. It was 14.50 total, a little much for me for ice cream. The consistency was more gelato-like and the flavors were intense so that you didn't really need much to be satisfied. I enjoyed my cone, but would probably head to Swensen's or somewhere else if I was looking for ice cream with a more ice creamy consistency or a cheaper cone. However, I'm definitely glad I experienced it.

stopped by to meet some friends, who luckily were already waiting in the rather long line so we hopped in with them. employees working behind the counter were awesome, made good suggestions and helped the line go by quickly. ordered two flavors in one cup: the salted caramel and the malted vanilla. the salted caramel was really yummy but i couldnt finish it. it got to be too much for me, not sure if it was the salty sweet combo (that i usually like) but i couldnt eat it all. the malted vanilla however i couldnt get enough of. mmm mmm had some nutty taste to it and a bit of crunch also. super yummy. wish i could have traded the rest of my salted caramel for more vanilla. overall a great experience. interesting flavors, helpful staff. a little cramped space cuz it was busy but nbd. would def come back if i were in the area. :)

Everyone that is from SF raves about this place! Now I see why... First off, the ice cream is always fresh and flavorful...each and every ice cream flavor tickles your taste buds in a different and unique way. My 2 personal favorites are the salted caramel and the malted vanilla. But most importantly, you have to try the Ricanela banana ice cream cake!! It is, most seriously, the best cake that I have ever had in my life. I guarantee that if you try this cake, you WILL fall in love with it. In fact, I'm starting to drool right now thinking about this cake. There is always a long line on the weekends, and parking is horrendous...but in the end, it is all worth it for that moment when your tongue soaks in some of that yummy ice cream flavor!!

This ice cream place is sometimes hard to get to. ÊIts right by Delores Park so you often see people take their ice cream over and sit in the sun on a good day. ÊI usually find parking on the street around the corner. ÊThe line will wrap around the corner on a sunny day on the weekends. ÊThey have a few places to sit and eat inside and outside. ÊYou will sometimes have to wait 15-20 minutes to get your ice cream, but its worth it. I've had the salted caramel. ÊIt's pretty good. ÊNot too sweet. ÊI like that its really smooth, but it melts really fast and before I'm even done with my ice cream its already melted into a soup. ÊThey also limit how many flavors you can taste. ÊRoasted banana is my FAVORITE here. ÊI love cooked bananas and this tastes just like it but in a better texture. ÊThe toasted coconut is also good. ÊTheir cones are regular.

The ice cream is really good, dont get me wrong, but I want to go back and try more flavors before I give it its extra stars. I tried the Sam's Sundae, since it's been raved and talked about a lot.

Rushed here after dinner on Sunday before they placed the "CLOSED" sign on the last person in line. It was already 9:57pm when we left the restaurant so Daughter #2 got her car and dropped us off in front. Woo-hoo...only 5 people in line and no "CLOSED" sign in sight. I ordered the single serving size with two flavors - balsamic strawberry and ricanelas (cinnamon snickerdoodle). Hubby ordered the double serving with two flavors - salted caramel and honey lavender. Daughter #2 had the salted caramel and ricanelas and BF #2 had the chocolate with the salted caramel. It had been two years since my last tasting because last year we had walked by around 9:30pm and it was chillier and there were about 40 people in line so hubby refused to wait. Sigh....I had to wait another year to satisfy my craving but it was worth it. I had forgotten how intense the flavor was on the salted caramel because I had been substituting Sweet Republic's salted caramel which is more subtle. Sorry Sweet Republic, but Bi-Rite's my #1 preference.

You know something's good when there's always a line out the door. It is a small establishment, but still, for ice cream in a city that averages 50-60 degree temps and ridiculously hard to find parking, it's a testament to how good ice cream is even in cold weather. I love the variety of flavors at Bi-Rite. Simple and common with a dash of creativity. It's a place that knows their flavors which translates well to the masses. My favorite flavor is the Earl Grey Tea which is pretty much milk tea in ice cream form (but without the pearls). Unfortunately, they don't always have it. The coffee toffee is amazing and so is the browned butter pecan. I could go on and on because all of them are just so uniquely bi-rite. The great thing about the location is that you can get your ice cream and (on a good day if you're lucky) walk across the street to Dolores Park and savor your ice cream on the green grass. At that moment, you'll be enjoying how perfect everything is. It's worth the trek from the south bay and don't forget to get a "Buy 10 get 1 free card". note: not 5 stars because - it's far from me, parking really is annoying, and they haven't opened one in the south bay. (hint, hint)

The ice cream here is so good!! I'm not usually a big fan of ice cream since I prefer fro-yo, but I'd definitely pick Bi-rite over most fro-yo places. ÊI've tried a few flavors, but I always come back to the salted caramel. ÊMmmmm~ Ê While you're in the area you should make a stop at Tartine bakery for their banana cream tart.

There's nothing I can say that 2800+ people haven't said about this place except that Bi Rite has introduced me to my all time favorite flavor of ice cream - Salted Caramel. And it has a very incredible after effect. Case in point: My breath smells like garlic and onions after eating a delicious pizza from Delfina across the street. However, one taste of this carefully prepared ethereal treat http://media1.px.yelpcdnÉ has me singing the praises of the slightly burnt, buttery, wonder http://media1.px.yelpcdnÉ . After a single spoonful has been swallowed, magically my breath smells like cotton candy and children's laughter. Go figure. P.S.

Every time I have gone has been at 930pm-ish and there is always a long line wrapping around the corner building. We've stood in the cold in parkas and holding places in line while friends find parking. ... so worth it. Faves: Vegan chocolate, balsamic strawberry, lavendar (smells so good!), and salted caramel. GO!

Yum, yum and yum! ÊThe small creamery offers a small but unique and gourmet flavours like salted caramel, lavender and creme fraiche. The texture was soft but rich and creamy. There is a small seating area inside the creamery but there are also benches outside the store. ÊWe sat outside under the cover of the store to savour our delightful treats. If it weren't for the wet weather, we would haver gone across the street to Delores Park to enjoy the view and skyline of the city.

My one review won't make a difference to the 2,000 plus reviews bi-rite already has on yelp. This ice cream shop is a staple in SF. Every San Franciscan knows about this awesome place with the tastiest ice creams ever! The salted caramel was a favorite among many but my ultimate favorite would have to be the roasted banana and balsamic strawberry. Both flavors were fantastic and was probably one of the best ice creams I've ever had. It was soo tasty that we decided to buy 5 pints which were 7.99 each and brought them to our friends BBQ. If you're in the area or even if you're in SF visiting...I highly recommend you stopping by bi-rite to grab one of their delicious ice creams. Just be forewarned that the lines are pretty long but it's all worth it!

Other than the painful search for parking, this place has the BEST brown sugar ice cream. I didn't like the salted caramel as much as I wanted to because I've had better, but the brown sugar ice cream was really good. We waited in line for a short while (around 7:30pm ish). The place is a bit packed with people inside and outside and the atmosphere is pretty loud. I enjoyed the atmosphere because it truly reminded me of Europe, where people enjoy themselves in a cramped place. I will be back for your brown sugar ice cream!

Did you know its possible to hypnotize a chicken? I learned this useful little trick during my childhood summers spent on a farm. If you don't believe me, check out this video: http://www.youtube.com/wÉ So what does this have to do with BiRite? Well, the first time I tried Bi-Rite I correctly presumed I should sit down to fully enjoy what was coming. About three bites in I looked, and felt, like that hypnotized chicken. I sat there in a trance- motionless (except for the continuous scooping) gazing off into space completely unaware of anything besides that blissful sensation in my mouth. When I finished and came back to consciousness, I turned to my date and said, "Right now- I can die happy. Honestly, there's just nothing else after this ice cream." *SIGH*

I come here whenever I'm down in the Mission and it's remotely hot. I'm a fairly boring ice cream eater and get stuff like the cookies and cream, mint chip, or the vanilla with peanut brittle. The vanilla with peanut brittle is good, but really sweet. I wouldn't recommend getting more than one scoop. Everything I've had here is great. My wife loves the honey lavender, which I personally think is gross. They're famous for their salted caramel, which is ok. If you ever are in the Mission, and it's hot. You'll definitely be waiting in a fairly long line. But don't worry, the line moves pretty fast. I don't think I've waited more than 15 minutes ever. Definitely give it a try if you're in the mission/dolores park area!

LOOOONG lines. Since we weren't from the area, time was limited. The long line is for all the options, whereas the shorter line was for selected soft serve flavors and other treats. We opted for the shorter line. Luckily they had the flavor I wanted to try which was the salted caramel, because of all the reviews. It was delicious. Just the right creaminess, salty/sweet mix to be satisfying but not overdone. The shorter line only took a couple minutes and we went on our way back to the hotel. At least I was able to check this place off my list of places I wanted to go while in SF. Definitely, next time I'm in town I'll be a trooper, go in the other line so I can take advantage and try the other flavors. =)

Upside to going to Bi-Rite Creamery in 40 degree weather: 1. No line means no waiting. 2. Ice cream doesn't melt on the walk home. 3. Chocolate mint and vanilla soft serve, original cookies and cream and a vanilla ice cream chocolate chip sandwich are all outstanding no matter what the temperature.

I finally got to visit the actual Bi-Rite Creamery in SF and boy, was I a happy camper. **Note: parking was a pain. Expect to circle around 18th Street for at least 20 minutes. Street parking in SF is terrible. I don't have any advice for this other than to pray that you get lucky and find a parking spot nearby. ATMOSPHERE It reminded me a lot of Ici back in Berkeley, except not as "cute" and "girly." Like at Ici, you can sample the flavors with actual silver spoons! Classy at its best. There were also jars of fudge/syrup and baked goods lined along the walls, which only served to tempt me to buy bags of chocolate chip cookies or salted caramel syrup. Mmm. The place is very small. In fact, there's more room near the cashier compared to the seating area, which is a narrow room with immovable wooden tables and tiny wooden stools. FOOD The flavors change daily and you can call in to ask for the daily selection. However, based off other Yelpers, I decided to go with the salted caramel and the honey lavender and HOT DAMN were they tasty. I highly recommend both flavors. However, both flavors do get a little sweet after a while, so I recommend getting a single and split the single into half honey lavender and half salted caramel-- that way, you don't get sugar overload and you can still leave extremely satisfied. Overall, one of the best ice cream parlors I've been to. It's just a shame they didn't have the balsalmic strawberry ice cream sandwich I tried at the SF Food Festival...

There's the infamous salted caramel. The note posted on the refrigerator says the salted caramel is not as hard when frozen but stays creamier/more melty because of the higher sugar content? Great, now I don't think I want to order that again. Honey lavender. Soap anyone? Roasted banana. If you are crazy about bananas. Brown butter pecan. I do like the nuttiness. Sam's Sundae. Chocolate ice cream with bergamot olive oil, maldon sea salt and whipped cream. The best thing I ever ate? Aida Mollenkamp, you lied! http://www.yelp.com/biz_É So until you bring Earl Grey back and make it a regular rotation, Bi-Rite I am boycotting you! Earl Grey! Earl Grey! Earl Grey! Oh yeah, the 5 star is for the Earl Grey.

How can you visit SF and NOT come here? Many of my Norcal friends from school recommended I try this place when I went to visit this past winter break. I have been to Norcal a few times in my life and I wish someone had told me about Bi-Rite earlier. My friends and I went at a random hour and luckily the line wasn't too long. The place itself it very quaint and homey, just the way I like it. I got the salted caramel and the coffee toffee. Both were delicious! The salted caramel wasn't too sweet, which was nice, and the coffee toffee had the best toffee chunks I ever did taste. One of my friends tried the honey lavender which I really, really liked. It's a risk getting aromatic flavors because they could either be really good or really horrible. The lavender flavor was not overpowering at all and I could definitely taste it but also got the honey as well. One of my other friends tried the roasted banana which was also amazing! It tasted exactly what it was named, a frozen roasted banana. I also purchased some toffee chip cookies to take back home, but unfortunately, those were not so praiseworthy. They were rather hard, instead of the chewy goodness I was hoping for and also rather plain. So my suggestion is, skip out on the baked goods and indulge in a multitude of fantastic ice cream flavors!

Yum! I love ice cream, and I wanted to stop by and check out their ice cream since I was going to be here anyways (getting lunch from Ike's). ÊThe store is pretty small, with a small counter showing their ice cream selections. ÊThey also sell caramel and hot fudge sauce in small jars and bottles. Ê We got to try several samples before we decided on what we wanted. ÊThe nice thing about coming here is that you can choose more than one flavor of ice cream. ÊWe each got a small, which comes with 1-2 flavors. I think if you get a larger size, you might be able to get more. Ê I got the salted caramel with the malted vanilla with peanut brittle. ÊThose two flavors (IMO) worked together really well; the vanilla cut down on some of the sweetness of the salted caramel. ÊK got the Coffee Toffee and Mint Chip. ÊThe coffee toffee had a really deep coffee flavor; very reminiscent of espresso. ÊThe mint chip was okay; I just liked that it wasn't green like most mint chocolate chip ice cream is. Two smalls cost $6.50 total; which isn't too bad considering I've paid about $4 for a small ice cream at other places. ÊThey don't give you a huge serving (well, I did get a small), but it was definitely enough to satisfy you considering the ice cream was quite rich.

No matter how many times I come to Bi-Rite and how many different samples I try (the spoon washer must hate me) I ALWAYS end up with the same flavors: Salted Caramel: There is an amazing depth of flavor. It's like I can taste each layer of buttery sweetness as they folded it into the ice cream. It's like climbing up a marble-inlaid stairwell at the hippest nightclub party in your mouth. Balsamic Strawberry: it SOUNDS weird, but it flavors compliment wonderfully. Strawberry sweet, a little tart - a perfect seesaw. Honeydew Sorbet (i think?): tastes like a beautiful, breezy, summer day.

ICE CREAM WITH THE BOYFRIEND. Wow. I only decided to come here because of the 7x7 100 things to try in SF before dying..well and the top 50 sweets list as well. Because of this, I decided that I needed to at least try the Salted Caramel and the Sam's Sundae. I got Sam's Sundae - it was different. Chocolate ice cream and Olive Oil? I know it's weird, but it was quite delicious. Not for everyone's tastebuds, but mine were singing and happy. My boyfriend made his own sundae with salted caramel and coffee toffee ice cream. Salted caramel is like a little bit of heaven. Thinking about it now makes my mouth water and I want more! I know that I'm not in love with the savory and sweet, but these two combinations I'm actually in love with. MUST TRY.

Unique flavors, friendly staff. I came here sometimes with long lines, sometimes with no lines. Love how you can get 2 scoops when you order a single, etc. My favorites are probably the Roasted Banana and Toasted Coconut. The Salted Caramel is an all time favorite, everyone tries it and almost EVERYONE likes it. It's a little bit TOO salty for me, I always find myself thirsty after finishing the scoop and it overpowers the other flavor I get :/ They have sundaes, and popsicles, even sorbets. They sell by the pint too. Parking is a little hard to find but the area is magnificent. Dolores park nearby, ice cream on a good day? Sure, why not.

Quick update: I went there this afternoon and had a double-scoop in a cup; the Ricanelas and the Creme-Fraiche. I had already spoken about the Creme-Fraiche before, but the Ricanelas was BLOODY AMAZING !!!! I don't know how to describe it but the cinnamony-spicy flavour was perfect and I couldn't recommend it enough! ====================== Having had a bite at Ike's our group strolled over to this other San Francisco foodie-landmark. I must admit I had heard about Bi-Rite in passing and never really paid it much attention. So here I was, with absolutely no expectations. I took the mini "single" cup with a small scoop of creme fraiche and another of the toasted coconut. I particularly liked the mild subtle flavours of the creme fraiche and loved the texture that bordered on a soft serve ice cream --- just the way I like it! The toasted coconut too was really good with bits of toasted coconut blended in, but I'd rather take the coconut gelato I had in Berkeley over this one. And oh, I am definitely coming back for more ... but not before I drop in at Humphry Slocombe (haven't been there either) first.

Yummy Orangey Salty Chocolate Balls of Icecream! I'm talking about the Sam's Sundae, which is two scoops of rich chocolate icecream, drizzled with bergamot olive oil and sprinkled with malden sea salt, with a side of heavenly whipped cream!!! Featured on the food network and recently raved about by my fellow sweets indulger Ciara G, i knew exactly what i was gonna order while heading up to SF. And luckily, there was no line around lunch time! (although i did see a line around the block the night before). The first thing i did was to satisfy my curiosity of salted caramel (never had before!) with a sample of their icecream version. It was delicious but i couldn't see myself eating a whole cup full of it. I also sampled the honey lavender -nice but it was too perfumy for my taste. So i stuck to my pink guns and stayed with my original choice of the Sams Sundae!!! The combination sounds strange, but it does all work together into this really interesting swirl of flavors. There's a citrus-y tang from the olive oil that really compliments the chocolate oh so well. The salt on the other hand- you either like or not. Although i love salt, i'm not a huge fan of Sea salt, so i could have done without it. But the dude enjoyed it. Next time i want to try their Balsamic Strawberry and get a couple of their cupcakes! Eat it with the wooden spoon- tastes better for some reason!

They also rotate a nice array of innovative and ultra-fresh classic flavors - all organic, all good, except one.

Back in April: I spent $4.75 on a double scoop of Balsamic Strawberry on a sugar cone. (That was so good and I was impressed, but I'm not coming back again.) Two weeks later: I took my daughter after her Dr. appt. I spent $4.75 on a double scoop of Ritual Toffee Coffee in a cup. She had the $3.25 kid scoop of Cherry Almond on a sugar cone. (That was so yummy; we are not coming back again.) A month later: I took my niece after lunch. I spent $4.75 on a double scoop of a Salted Caramel. She had the Cookie and Cream and Vanilla combo. (The third trip was better. But then, we won't ever come back.) Few weeks later: The Fantastic-4 came here after an early dinner. I spent $4.75 on a double scoop of Cookie and Cream and Cherry Almond combo. Wife had the double scoop of Honey Lavender. Jr. had Toffee Vanilla and daughter had Salted Caramel. (The fourth visit for the "Fantastic-4"; nah, we better not.) Last week: The Fantastic-4 and niece came after an event nearby. I spent $4.75 on a double scoop of Honey Lavender and Vanilla. Wife had the Ritual Coffee Toffee and Mexican Chocolate combo. Niece had the Salted Caramel and Mint Chip. Daughter had a scoop of Balsamic Strawberry Jr. had the Toasted Coconut. ("Forget it!

Sorry to burst the 4 or 5 Star bubble but this place just wasn't having it with me. Yeah their ice cream is good, but I definitely would not wait in that long line again for it. Service was okay, ice cream was good, and the servings were way skimpy. For that amount of money, I'd rather go to Mitchell's and feel thoroughly satisfied after. Sorry Bi-Rite, I hope we can still be friends.

They advertise "artisanal ice cream, sorbets and confections", which I believe is a hoity-toity way of saying they're charging a few more shekels for your scoops, sport. That's fine by me because...dare I say it...it may very well be as good as Mitchell's (a clap of thunder erupts the near-silence of my typing). A friend of mine with more refined taste than me recommended I come here. So of course, I pick a brutally cold evening to visit, and there's still a line. Lots of flavors to choose from, and a very friendly staff to serve you. I decide to get creative and ask for a combination of the coffee-toffee and ginger in a single scoop. They comply, and to add insult to injury, I ask for toffee bits to be sprinkled on top. The combination is frickin' good...a total moo-cow high. A single scoop is $2.95, and a topping is 75-cents more, so $3.70 is not a discount, but it isn't a piggy bank-breaker either. They even have little benches in front to allow you complete concentration as you lick. they have cakes and some goodies in a display on the side, but go for the ice cream. One area for improvement - put the names of the ice cream flavors in a prominent display on a sign that we could see as we wait. I noticed only later that they scribbled the flavors on the glass next to the front door. ICE CREAM - 5 stars...dare I say it...it's Mitchell's-level...now I have to be killed AMBIANCE - 4 stars...cute, compact space with a retro-sign across from the Êbustling market and catty-corner from Dolores Park SERVICE - 4.5 stars...service with a smile TOTAL - 5 stars...lactose addicts unite!

Bi-Rite is an ice-cream power-house. Bi Rite is worth a block and a half line and could even be worth three. Their stuff is insane. Never had I had such rich, sharp, and distinct flavor in such perfectly made ice-cream. The salted caramel IS - buttery, creamy salted caramel. The honey lavender IS -sweet lightly fragranced cream. The banana ice-cream IS -rich-creamy fresh bananas. The ginger is lovely and cuts your tongue with precise flavor. None of that half-assed..."eh it tastes like a little like strawberries....yeah like strawberry flavored milk....kinda" stuff. Bi-Rite brings it. Leaving nothing but a trail of pure tongue lolling bliss. .... Oh and...I'm still not done yet.. YES there is more. Their sundaes have fresh whipped cream. Yes fresh. They make homemade popsicles, and homemade toppings. And their servers, even with the line quickly growing behind you, will walk you through their flavors and reassure you that you've chosen well. Jann's in Elementary School never tasted this good Haagen Daags (sp) in Middle school...ehhhhhh not quite. Gelato in Italy in high school might dance kinda close up on Bi-Rite. But international area codes don't apply to this competition. And even the thick Baskin and Robbins shakes from College didn't and don't match this stuff. They bow down at Bi-Rite's beautiful organic sugar cone. Cause Bi-Rite keeps the good stuff coming. They keep their flavors exciting. Their sundaes creative... Bi-Rite is genius and everything good. Vote Bi-Rite and you'll be lickingsugardrizzledfingers for days.

Line at Ike's: Rarely worth it Line at Badlands: Never worth it Line at Chinese embassy by my house: Not really sure what's going on Line at Bi-Rite: Totally worth it Chances are, if you live in SF, you've been to Bi-Rite. It's a (pardon the pun) Rite of passage, so to speak. I was introduced to Bi-Rite on one of my first nights living in SF, and what better way to celebrate moving to a cold and strange new city than by trying a few cold and strange ice cream flavors. When I say strange, I don't mean like Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans... but strange as in flavors you don't normally see at an ice cream shop. I have returned many, many times in my years here, despite the fact that it isn't exactly close to my neighborhood.

If you pop pills (Lactaid to be more specific), or have a steady Êsupply of Gas-X plus a box of ÊImodium (just in case), then you know you are a Lacto-like me! Why-Oh-Why would a foodie since birth be born Lactose Intolerant?! ÊSuch travesty!!! Do you know how much of a torture it is to be the only person at the table to not be able to eat that decadent creme brulee and opt for a boring sorbet instead?! Well, Lactos rejoice!!! With Bi-Rite's VEGAN BANANA ICE CREAM Ê (Don't say, "No, you di-n't!" ) Because I did-- one kid's cup of Vegan Banana Ice Cream for $2.25 and it was delicious!!!! ÊI was salivating over SALTED CARAMEL, HONEY LAVENDER, ÊBROWN SUGAR, and all those decadent flavors but I just couldn't. http://www.yelp.com/biz_É http://www.yelp.com/biz_É Vegan Banana, however, made up for my longing for regular ice cream. ÊIt was smooth, slimy like Êripe bananas, so full of bananas you can even see the seeds -- just plain wonderful that if all vegan ice creams taste like this, I wouldn't be so bitter about being born Lacto. I did not Êeven miss the cow. (They also have Vegan Chococate Ice Cream.) So, Lactos, Vegans, and non Lactos alike, go to Bi-Rite. I guarantee you'll find your flavor. BTW, who says I have self-control? I asked for a sample of the FAMOUS SALTED CARAMEL. Ê(Some things are just worth-suffering for.) For that flavor alone, I'll pop a truck load of Lactaid for one delicious scoop of Bi Rite Ice Cream! Go now and sample every flavor at this tiny ice cream shop. The staff are very nice and will let you. Ê Grab your ice cream and chill at Dolores Park across the street! http://en.wikipedia.org/É

Went to try the recommended Salted Caramel and was not impressed. Simply felt like eating caramel from a snickers bar. :\ Not sure what all the rave was about. I tried 3 flavors, SC, Honey Lavender, and Orange ???(forgot). The Orange-whatever was blek. Tasted ginger-y and failed my is-a-dessert-test. Weird blend of flavors there. Next! The stand out for me was Honey Lavender since the flavors really showed. The honey stood out and had a natural sweet taste which is awesome. Might go back there to test other flavors but not sure if it is worth the wait.

Honestly, with all the hype, don't come here expecting the ice cream to change your life... because really, it is still just ice cream. ÊWhat this place is great for is that it offers unique flavors. ÊSome interesting flavors I remember are: - Malted vanilla ice cream with peanut brittle and chocolate - Cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodle - Salted caramel ice cream - Brown sugar ice cream with ginger caramel swirl - Coffee toffee I sampled 4 flavors, but I just had to order their salted caramel after all the reviews. ÊIt was really delicious, but the flavor became too strong after having more of it. ÊI got the cinnamon with snickerdoodle for the man after sampling it because I thought it was quite tasty too. ÊIt's like cookies and cream, but with snickerdoodle instead of oreoes! The texture of their ice cream was thick, and creamy. ÊOverall very delicious! ÊI thoroughly enjoyed it, and I can't wait to go back to try more flavors! A few notes... ÊThey have regular flavors, and they have seasonal flavors, so don't always expect your favorite to be there! ÊAlso there are two Bi-Rites, across the street from each other. ÊOne appears to be a large market, which closes earlier than the other. ÊThe other is a tiny little storefront that only serves their ice cream products. ÊBonus points for being open late enough for me to have ice cream after a late dinner!

OHM OHM OHM The ice cream here is pretty damn good! *thumbs up* Bi-Rite is a unique creamery in that they have exotic flavors that aren't typically found in ice cream such as Honey Lavender, Salted Caramel, and Roasted Banana; they make almost everything at the creamery, and a lot of their ingredients are organic. Upon entering, we were able to sample as many flavors as we wanted. Although the server looked a little frustrated that we all wanted to try something, he reluctantly but kindly granted us the privilege to try a whole bunch. I tried Coffee Toffee and my friend's sample of Salted Caramel and found that while the latter was a little too sweet, the Coffee Toffee was pretty good. I bought a pint of Coffee Toffee to bring home and although it was a little pricey at $7.99, my family and I enjoyed it. My friends got single scoops which were a little pricey ($3.25) for the size, but from what I tried they were good too. *SIDE NOTE*: If you see Bi-Rite Market down the block DON'T get confused and ask for ice cream there. It's the wrong place. While we didn't make this mistake, we almost did since both Bi-Rite's are only a couple paces away from each other!

I've been hearing about Bi-Rite Creamery for the last 3 years. Finally, I got the chance to partake in the glory that is, what most say, is the best ice cream in SF. I think the two things that surprised me most about this place was how small and almost hole in the wall it is and how friendly the staff is. We were in here at about 8pm on a Sunday night, amidst a long line of anxious customers and the ladies scoopin' the goods up front were all smiles and very polite. They let you sample to your heart's content, but my advice to you: if the line is long, don't try more than a few flavors at the most before you pick your poison. Bi-Rite customers DO NOT want to wait a long time for their Salted Caramel or Mint Chippy... or the Roasted Banana Ice cream. And why should we? The stuff is delicious. I tried the vanilla with caramel, (something else) and ginger and it was SO good. If I could consume more than a spoonful of real ice cream without getting sick, I would have had this. Instead, I went with their chocolate soy variety. It was delicious and tasted more like iced chocolate frosting a soy something. I will happily come back here each and every time I'm in SF... duh.

We ordered pizzas for take-out at Pizzeria Delfina across the street, and we had 20 minutes to kill. I noticed Bi-Rite, and after reading all the hype on Yelp, I had to see what all the fuss was about. Since I'm a huge chocolate freak, initially I was a little disappointed to see only two chocolate flavors (and one was vegan chocolate coconut) on the menu. After trying the chocolate, all was forgiven. Then scooper guy was really friendly and offered us samples of anything, and didn't rush us at all, despite the line. I tried a few other flavors and setlled on chocolate (of course) and salted caramel. My husband ordered some sort of cinnamon snickerdoodle flavor and our son takes after mommy - CHOCOLATE! Smart boy. It was excellent and reminiscent of gelato. It may be the best ice cream I've ever tasted.

I'd been slacking on giving Bi-Rite word time as one look at the 895+ reviews on the Yelp page, and the endless serpentine line out the door and it's pretty apparent that people do indeed love this place. So this one's for my east coast brethren who ask me where to go when in the Yay Area. HEEEEEEEEREEEEEEEE, friends. We're talking local Strauss rGbh free milk churned to the paragon of ice cream existence! Merely the sight of it gives me palpitations. Gripping one of their old skool wooden spoons digging into a biodegradable cup of salted caramel, coffee toffee or balsamic strawberry sweetness cures any psychological ailment for the duration of consumption guaranteed, says Dr. Ligaya. Oooh lucky San Francisco. How rare for the hippie, foodie and hedonist to all be satisfied at once!

What do you want me to say? It sucked? I hated it? Should I even bother writing a review? I guess... You already know it's 5 stars. I thought I had amazing 5 star ice cream before in my life, that was until i had Bi-Rite. I tried the Salty Carmel, Cookies N' Cream, the Coffee Toffee and the Snickerdoodle flavors... All of them were outstanding. The shop is located at a kiddie corner across from Delores Park. The shop is pretty small inside, with only 3 seats against a wall. You can sit outside near the trees and people watch, which is nice in this part of town... The price must fluctuate from time to time because the prices in the Yelp pictures are lower than what I paid today... If you're looking for the best of San Francisco, best of Yelp, best of Ice Cream in your life... You've gotta try Bi-Rite.

When the weather turns warm I immediately think of ice cream. OK, let's be honest, I'm obsessed with ice cream and I'll pretty much eat ice cream in a flood, snowstorm, monsoon, well, you get it. At least when it's warm I have a legitimate reason to eat ice cream. So we headed to Bi-Rite Creamery. Apparently, I'm not the only one who likes ice cream on warm days as there was a line out the door and halfway to the corner. "I hope this shit is worth it and not just some trendy shit that I'll be paying through the nose for just to say 'I tried Bi-Rite Creamery,'" I thought to myself. The plan was to get a scoop with the wife as an afternoon treat then go home and cook a little dinner later. I'm a chef. I don't cook for myself very often and this was a big deal. (If you were a garbage man would you take out the garbage at home? I didn't think so, smart guy.) As I neared the counter and got a better glimpse of the flavors my order soon changed to a full on sundae complete with berry compote, whipped cream and crumbled pieces of biscotti. Dinner is SERVED! The ice cream is made with Strauss Creamery milk and they have classic flavors like vanilla and mint chip as well as some creative twists and fresh flavors like roasted banana, salted caramel and brown butter pecan. The Kid has a little congestion so I got the soy chocolate so I could share with her. What kind of heartless motherfucker eats ice cream around a kid and doesn't share? The soy chocolate is amazing and almost completely convincing as real ice cream. Which brings me to another point. There are soy options as well as sorbets for the vegans or lactose intolerant (I will not STAND for lactose! Poor bastards.) It's all high quality and really delicious (and this is from a dude who eats enough ice cream to know) so what are you waiting for? It's ice cream time, dude!

And here it is. I am commemorating my 1000th review on Yelp with one of the most Yelp'd places I've ever been to. I thought long and hard about what I should do with my 1000th, after all its no small feat and I'm sure my carpel tunnel will thank me later but after all, this is what Yelp is all about. Bi-Rite Creamery is just the appropriate venue for me to celebrate this 1000th review (and hopefully more to come) as it is the definition of what happens when people get together and share their opinions and love for food with the world. It results in a good 20 minute line around the block for this little creamery that serves up not 5, not 10 but more than 15 tantalizing flavors of ice cream from a variety of sorbet (vegan) options to real oreo cookie crumbs in my cookies and creme. The staff is beyond friendly, and very dedicated to the creamery as they immediately attack you with free samples if you so ever slightly mention the word "ice" or "citrus" until you're just about full from trying all the flavors. Then you have to make the deathly difficult decision as to what you'd like. Yes the double can only hold 3 flavors, THREE that's it! Stop getting so greedy and move on. And no, I would not recommend anymore than three flavors unless you really enjoy a good ol' case of stomach aches later, like your mama warned ya! The inside of this shop is very small and almost no one really stays to sit in its two small tables to enjoy the ice cream especially since there are nice benches outside on a great weathered evening in San Francisco (and these are rare indeed). They do sell pints and cakes to go so if you want those you can just walk directly up to the cashier. For the authentic experience I recommend you wait in line anyway, get some scoops and then get a pint to go; after all the line is what makes it even more special! You can also call ahead to order and customize a party-sized ice cream treat any way you want it. Finally, they have a bakery portion on the side that serves soft serve ice cream in salted caramel and two other flavors that you can swirl. The cupcakes and pastries are ... ok ... If I had to give them a separate rating it would probably have to be 2.5 stars (sorry, it really did not impress) but the ice cream was incredible. Cookies and creme: best I've ever had (and of course my absolute favorite in terms of ice cream flavors ...) Honey Lavender: where do they come up with these flavors?! Vegan Chocolate: I don't even like chocolate and this was finger lickin' good Kiwi Banana Sorbet: refreshing and does not leave a sticky feeling in your mouth Pineapple Mango Sorbet: also very similar, but I did like the kiwi banana better Brown sugar Ginger Caramel: to. die. for. and again, I hate ginger. they're really getting me to eat all my veggies so to speak :) I will have to stop by for a pint, or two ... or three next time I'm in the area. maybe four.

From what I gather, BiRite is one of the SF Ice Cream Trinity: ÊHumphrey Slocombe, Mitchell's, and BiRite. ÊFinally made it out to BiRite on a Saturday afternoon and there is a long line. ÊBut everyone in the line is happy, unlike the lines at DMV, so I get in line, too, with my friends. Several people recommended the Salted Caramel and Balsamic Strawberry. ÊBoth sound good so I get a scoop of each and only after I ordered I remembered my doctor had told me to refrain from eating too much ice cream this week. ÊOh well. Both were creamy yummy and the flavors were expressed truthfully, but as a combo, the intensity of the Salted Caramel overshadowed the the subtle balance in the flavors of the Balsamic Strawberry. Ê Well, that's my fault. In the end, I thoroughly enjoyed my ice cream, the company of my friends, and I didn't even mind waiting in line, so yes, I am a fan.

After chowing down on some pastries from Tartine, it's only natural to go to Bi-Rite, right? We did stop in the store first to get my stomach some time off from this punishing eating trip but it really wasn't that much time to digest since the ice cream shop is just across the street. I opted to get a small but you can pick two flavors. I got the salted caramel that I heard so much about and the brown butter pecan. Mmm, yum yum! My friend had a melon popsicle with chile. I didn't try it since I'm allergic to honeydew but she said it was great.

I did not win the genetic lottery. ÊThere was no big winner on 10/3/1980. A blonde, blue eyed baby with no eyebrows, I was born with the genetic makeup for broad shoulders, little to no ass, toothpick legs and an affinity for ice cream. ÊOk, affinity is the mildest word I could possibly use. ÊIt's an obsession; a love affair so hideously painful that if I ever become lactose intolerant (I am knocking on wood as I type), I will do a flying cartwheel off the GG. Ice cream is the purest form of sensuality, don't you think? ÊCreamy, sinful, satisfying. ÊRoasted Banana and Salted Caramel Ice Creams topped w/ Chocolate Sauce. ÊDid you just climax from that description? Ê No? ÊWell, I did. You see, Bi-Rite Creamery does things to me you'll never be able to do... even if you are tremendously flexible and use both hands.

The first time I was here, it was a hot Saturday afternoon and there was line out the door that almost reached the corner. ÊBut I waited in line patiently underneath the scorching sun. And you know what happened on my inaugural visit? ÊI was asked to leave the premises. I didn't mean to to destroy their display of books and stuff. ÊBut I thought there was a clue hidden in one of the fixtures. How was I suppose to know they weren't participating in the Yelp Scavenger Hunt 2008? And in my defense, when asked for a clue, they were the ones who pointed me to the display in the first place. I made a promise to return and try their famous ice cream and see what all the hype was about. I finally got to experience it. And to the chagrin of many family, friends, and fellow yelpers, I didn't like it. The Roasted Banana was too sweet. The overall flavor wasn't bad and the texture was creamy enough, but there was this sugary aftertaste with almost each bite. It's too bad since I like do enjoy banana ice cream. I wonder. With so many positive Yelp reviews, could I be the one who's wrong? I'll give this place yet another chance. Beware Bi-Rite, I'll be back. And when I ask for a clue, you better not point to the bookshelf. Oh, and that ice cream of yours better impress since I rarely give a second chance.

Like other popular ice cream places, Bi-Rite lacked sufficient seating arrangements. ÊHowever, some of their ice cream flavors are unique and tasty. In August summer afternoon, we came around 1pm. ÊThe trick is to come at odd hours to avoid long lines. ÊPicking from the menu, I ordered Ginger, Honey Lavender and Balsamic Strawberry, the most three unique flavors to try. ÊGinger was not too spicy and although I could taste some slight ginger flavors I think it was too mellow. ÊBalsamic Strawberry was OK, not too special. ÊMy favorite was Honey Lavender because I could taste the distinct and fragrant lavender and the scoop was not too sweet. ÊOverall, the ice cream texture was smooth, even and creamy, but I think Ici in Berkeley have better service and more creativity. If you don't want to get in the line, you can get a pint from the Bi-Rite Grocery across the street. ÊThey have most of the flavors.

In 19 days, his poor stomach is going to be inundated with cheeseburgers and burritos and bacon and all of the things that Oz just doesn't seem to know how to make properly. And when he's finally finished stuffing his face, I'm gonna make sure he satisfies his sweet tooth with some real ol' American ice cream at Bi-Rite Creamery, because the land down under sure as hell doesn't know what it's doing in that department. (And don't even get me started on their shoddy excuses for milkshakes.) Brown sugar and ginger caramel. Ricanelas. Salted caramel. Even the classics like mint chip and vanilla.

ÊIf I could think of something it most resembles it would be a See's Candy Butterscotch lollipops. ÊThe Vanilla ice cream with peanut brittle and chocolate pieces was very good as well. ÊI recommend this if you are a big peanut brittle fan. ÊThe vanilla flavor kind of gets masked by the peanut brittle flavor. Ê Bi-Rite lives up to the hype and more.

I was struck with a Bi-Rite ice cream craving (not a fro-yo craving, wow). ÊThis time my experience wasn't quite as good as the first time but with the gourmet toppings, fresh baked goods (cookies, brownies, mini chocolate souffles), boxes of sprinkles, ice cream books and natural tasting, high quality ice cream, it still merits five stars. I tried the cinnamon ice cream with bits of crushed snickerdoodle cookies (the name of the ice cream starts with "r"). ÊI love cinnamon and snickerdoodles - inspired combination with plenty of cinnamon. The orange cardamom ice cream tasted natural and had bits of orange rind but the cardamom flavor wasn't there. ÊThis one was a miss for me because I am a cardamom fan. Ê I sampled the ginger ice cream - nice and zingy with ample fresh ginger. Ê The biggest disappointment was their chocolate chip toffee cookie. ÊIt was almost paper thin. ÊThat type of cookie should never be that thin. ÊI'm sure it would have tasted great crumbled up in ice cream but on it's own, it was a big miss.

What do you do when it's hot as the devil's ass crack in the city, and you just had an absolutely amazing meal, but the restaurant didn't have any desserts that called out to you? Given that I'm writing this review, those who have not suffered severe head trauma would naturally conclude the answer is: go to Bi-Rite Creamery. I had the brownie sundae (because I'm a sucker for those), but swapped the vanilla ice cream for lavender honey. ÊWifey had a double-scope cone of roasted banana. We took our just desserts and found a nice slice of bench near a tree in front of Bi-Rite, and sat and watched the sun fade from the western sky, as the houses on the hill glowed from inside out, and people on the tennis courts near the park lazily lobbed balls back and forth under the lights. ÊI savored my sundae, the ice cream perfectly recreating the flavor of lavender honey. ÊWifey devoured her cone, which tasted just exactly like Bananas Foster. ÊWe sat in front of the brightly-lit Creamery, and we talked for a long time in the cool clear night air. ÊAnd life was good.

As if eating ice cream before dinner last week wasn't bad enough, guess who dined at Limon Rotisserie AFTER stopping by both Bi-Rite AND Humphry Slocombe Monday night? Yup, Suany Fat Pants. My fat ass needs to be spanked...hard! I sampled the infamous Salted Caramel, which was good, but nothing to wet my granny panties over. My favorites were Earl Grey and Roasted Banana. Unlike the distinct tastes in Humphry Slocombe ice cream, most of Bi-Rite's flavors have a uniform note which makes differentiation difficult after sampling several varieties. While I enjoyed my visit here, my adventurous taste buds will most likely be steering me toward Humphry Slocombe in the future.

Oh my goodness!!!! The Sam's Sundae was everything I thought, hoped, wished and dreamed it would be. Completely lived up to my super high expectations of pretty much ice cream sundae perfection. Chocolate ice cream is my last choice of ice cream ever but topped with that maldon sea salt and bergamot olive oil this sundae is pure genius! The house made whip that was fluffed on the side was amazing and added the perfect creaminess to each salted-chocolaty-orange essence olive oily bite. We went around 10pm and even with the chilly San Fransico wind, there was a line out the door! I stopped by first at the little "Bi-Rite express" window to find out that that window only sells soft serve and cookies and cupcakes. The guy working was super friendly and gave me a sample of their Balsamic Strawberry and Vanilla swirl froyo yo. Ummm delicious! If I didn't have my hear already set on Sam I would have been happy with a soft serve and a cupcake to-go. Even though the line was long it moved super fast. Well and it helps to when you know what you want. They have so many awesome sounding ice cream selections to choose from. I would have loved to try them all (or at least 2 or 3) but I didn't want to be "that person". Staff was friendly and put my sundae together fast. A Sam's Sundae from Bi-Rite will now forever be a permanent stop in my SF visit itinerary. They have stamp cards available and even though I live roughly 398.2 miles away, I took one anyway.

Ice cream lovers will love Bi-Rite. I'm more of a frozen yogurt person, ice cream is a little too rich even for me, but I tried it anyway because its on both of my current lists: #35 on Big Eat SF and #75 on Yelp's top 100: Salted caramel ice cream and Bi-Rite Creamery If I were smart, I would have sampled the salted caramel and ordered mint chip, to be guaranteed happiness. But I'm not smart, and I just went straight to the ordering and had a cone with salted caramel and brown sugar with ginger caramel swirls. The salted caramel was too salty for my liking. I liked the brown sugar better, but it still wasn't amazing. ÊIn retrospect there were many preferable flavor options besides the mint chip.....vanilla with peanut butter, balsamic strawberry, cinnamon with snickerdoodle....I really ordered all wrong. The ice cream is high quality, and I do understand why people like it, but I doubt I'll wait in line for it again.

I knew I was going to get it.. maybe not right now but sooner or later when I could make the opportunity to get a shot at fully enjoying it... I've heard of this ice cream before... and I could have enjoyed it way back when but I was too full with dinner I had just eaten. As much as I would have loved to have tried it then, it would not have been fair to me or to it to have tried to force it down. Though I did keep it close to me in my thoughts forever more. Finally the day had come that I could finally partake of the goodness that is bi-rite. I admit it had been hard to not get some earlier or along the way with merely tastings here and there. But now is the day that I can fully enjoy all that is Bi-Rite without thought of aythign else. Nothing else matters at this point. Did I mention there was NO line? Got a banana split with coffee toffee ice cream, I think maybe balsamic strawberry and possibly butter pecan. I dont know but it was all good... Great even. *drool* ;D

You know who I'm not a big fan of? Sweets. That's who. Before you give me that look, step off and observe my new cavity. The first cavity I've had since age 7, when I routinely stuffed my face with anything that my mom forbid me to eat. Ya, I was one of those kids who brought all-natural peanut butter sandwiches and carrot sticks to school. I was also the kid who tried to "up for grabs" my trail mix in exchange for a rice crispy treat. Unfortunately the other kids seemed to outsmart me, and I was usually stuck eating my stupid unprocessed, unwhitebread sandwiches. But I'm all growns up now. I live by myself, I buy my own food, and I make my own g-d damn choices....choices that lead to sugary worm holes forming in my teeth. But you see, I really don't eat that many sweets. Once and a while I'll accept a slice of cheesecake, or a half a brownie, or half of a berry pie. You see? I'm good. I'm healthy. I prefer salty over sweet....like Bi-Rite's salted caramel ice cream. You see tooth!!! Salt! It was salt for f*cks sake, you shit bag tooth! Don't you get it?? It was salty, with a hint of sweetness and a whole bucketful of delicious. It was melty and creamy and OH FINE! It was sugary!!! I get my new trusty filling in July 11th. Mark your calendar tooth because the next day I'm gonna treat you to something real special like. Something salty, something creamy, something that will most likely drill a mutherf*cking big ass hole in your neighbor.

Believe the hype! What could be better on a hot summer day than full fat ice cream? It's tantamount to inner peace! If you're on a diet, just get a cup with a scoop of salted caramel (to massage your taste buds) and a scoop of ginger (to add a bit of zing). Getting only one scoop is pointless, because you'll just have to walk back five blocks to get another 10 minutes later. It's that irresistible on a warm afternoon when the Bay Bridge is closed down. Oh, and don't eat it in Dolores Park, as that's too close....then you'll end up eating four scoops and blowing out the diet. UPDATE: The Brown Butter Pecan is only so-so : ( UPDATE: On further examination, the Brown Butter Pecan is pretty darn good!

I have to admit that I eat more ice cream than I probably should. It's my "thing." I can't say no when it's in front of me. It shocks me that I've lived in SF for 5 years and last weekend was my first time trying Bi-Rite. I honestly can't think of a time that I had something better. Maybe in Italy? They have really unique flavors like Salted Caramel and Brown Sugar. When I originally saw these flavors I felt jipped. What the hell is this? Where's my chocolate? Where's my strawberry? When I got to the front of a line I tentatively started tasting... and instantaneously my idea about what was good ice cream, was gone! It was nearly agonizing coming to a decision. I ended up with coffee toffee and it was like no other coffee ice cream. It was rich and creamy with the perfect balance of crunch. I took it over to Dolores Park, munched away and had a perfect afternoon.

When I first tried the brown sugar/ginger/caramel ice-cream, I don't know if I wanted to cry tears of happiness, sing from the top of a mountain (well, dolores park will do), or punish myself for not having had it sooner. I ended up doing none of the above, instead opting to stare blankly into the distance until my friend asked me if I was okay. When I woke up from my food coma, I realized this might be the single best ice cream flavor I have ever tried. It's not like it was the most original thing I have ever encountered, and I wanted to take away 1 star because the consistency is not as dense as I would like it to be (think Double Rainbow), but somehow they made the balance of the 3 flavors work to perfection, so I had to go with 5. The other flavors are definitely delicious, and it's worth going back on numerous occasions to find your favorite (the salted caramel is quite popular). As for me, I have finally found my one true love and I will never leave its side again!

ÊActually the hot chocolate special was called "Extreme Hot Chocolate" ÊLady sitting next to me ordered the hot chocolate, took a sip, and kept saying, "oh my God, oh my God, this hot chocolate is, oh my God, so good" I guess it was good. Ê But let's get back to the ice cream. . . I ordered a medium sized cup with two scoops - one salted caramel and one ginger. Ê I can't remember how much it cost but it doesn't even matter. ÊThis is by far the best ice cream I've ever had in my whole life. ÊWhatever I paid, it was worth it. ÊThe salted caramel ice cream was the perfect combination of sweet and savory flavors. ÊThe ginger ice cream was incredibly rich with ginger flavor and generous with bits of fresh ginger. ÊThis is serious ice cream. ÊGreat texture, fresh flavors. Oohs, and ahhh's ensued from the first to the last bite. ÊThis was four people oohing, and ahhhing consistently throughout the whole ice cream eating extravaganza. Ê I'm not a huge ice cream person but I'll make room, no matter how full I am, for a scoop (or two!) at Bi-Rite Creamery. ÊThat's just how darn good it is! Grrrrrrrrrrrr!

Honey Lavender, Salted Caramel, and Ginger ice cream, all three delectable flavors nestled in a compostable cup and topped with a sugar cone, are an amazing treat for a day as warm and beautiful as today. Bi-Rite has been hyped up in my mind for some time now, and upon recent discovery of the East Bay ice creamery, Ici (Berkeley), I've been skeptical whether or not Bi-Rite's offerings were competitor worthy. ÊWell, believe the hype because Bi-Rite Creamery makes some really amazing stuff. ÊRich in flavor, smooth and creamy in texture...each flavor was distinct and well-balanced. Ê My only complaint is that I didn't find any of the other flavors (aside from the three I mentioned above) appealing to me, unlike that piece of heaven they call Meyer Lemon Ice Cream from Ici. ÊSo I'm giving Bi-Rite a 4.5-star rating unless they come up with something amazing like, I don't know, "Organic Meyer Lemon Ice Cream That's As Good As Ici's But You Don't Have To Drive Over The Bridge For It" flavor, you know what I'm saying? SIDE NOTE: ÊPlease be aware of birds overhead when standing in line for Bi-Rite. ÊI got shat on.

What a better way to follow up dessert then with dessert... but not any dessert but with Ice Cream and not just any Ice Cream but Bi Rite Ice Cream. After me Daniel L. and Kent P.had a decadent indulgent of amazingly sweet pastries at the wonderful Tartine Bakery... what did we do? We went to have more dessert...Lol....Yes us sweet ahoholics went trenching over to the wonderful Fabulous Bi Rite...The much longed, much dreamed about place- that I have so eagerly been Êwanting to try. The place is much smaller then ÊI had envisioned with only but a bench outside for seating, the line was not that bad at all (whew)...but still a little line. They had flavors all the way from Honey Lavender (AMAZING) fresh rich sweet and beautiful also Kent P.s favorite ... Crme Fraiche...Ok....Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl....Mmmm yum another favorite......Salted Caramel.....Most popular and I can so see why...Wow....there were many other flavors, they rotate daily and those were just a few for that day...Being a little stuffed on previous desserts..: ) I opted for a child size of the oh so..

I don't know what I can really add to Bi-Rite's 1000+ reviews. Short and quick..... SALTED CARAMEL!!!! - Smooth, not "salty" at all (well maybe a little), right amount of sweetness YUMM! Malted Vanilla- I've never been a fan of malt but when the boyfriend said it was delicious I knew I had to give it a try. Now I know why I love him so much, he never lies =) it was DELICIOUS. I really wanted to try the pumpkin flavor since Thanksgiving is just right around the corner but I didn't. Damn...why didn't I try it! =( Bi-Rite Creamery sell flavors by pints as well. $5.99 for a pint of awesome-ness!!! haha

Let's face it - I'm not writing anything new that hasn't been said before (unless I'm writing a WTF one-star review here). The ice cream here is simply heavenly. These non-traditional flavors are divine and aren't just unique flavors for the sake of being unique. For $3.25, I got a single scoop of ice cream that could be split into two small scoops of two different flavors. After sampling as many flavors I could before feeling self-conscious about it, I decided upon the balsamic strawberry and salted caramel on an organic sugar cone. I can have tunnel vision when it comes to eating, but never have I been so engrossed in consuming ice cream as I was with the salted caramel. Now I know what Homer Simpson experiences whenever he lapses into his extended mmm/drooling sessions. Major pluses for local, sustainable and/or organic ice cream and environmentally-conscious business practices. Minus points for myself since I'd have to drive from afar to get a lick of heaven from BRC.

What is the first thing that comes to mind on a very, very cold night in San Francisco? Ice Cream! I'm a Mitchell's guy and love their tropical flavors and I've heard of Bi-Rite Creamery. I've never had the chance to compare the two, so after eating some spicy Burmese dish, we wanted some cold dessert to counteract the spiciness in our tummy with some sweetness, and this was the perfect night for it. Just like Mitchell's, the line goes out the door and wraps around the corner. Like a perfect tag-team, I dropped off the wifey so she can wait in line while I looked for a place to park. After circling around for several times, finally found a space a block away. By the time I checked with the wifey, she was almost halfway through the line. We looked at the menu, checked Yelp app on the iPhone and the first thing that pops out is the Salted Caramel. Everyone seems to be raving about it. Also, it's a rotating menu and advertised as an Artisan ice cream. Translation: they can charge you whatever they feel like it. But after having a nibble, it's damn worth it. Now, I had trepidation about ordering the Salted Caramel since I am not fond of Caramel very much, and I didn't....my wifey did. I did have the Coffee Toffee, Roasted Banana and Toasted Coconut while the wifey had the Salted Caramel, Coffee Toffee and Malted Vanilla. Plain this is absolutely not. They are bursting with flavors and the ingredients are fresh. It's not too sweet either and a perfect blend of creaminess. When I did taste the Salted Caramel, I began to understand what the fuss was all about. Holy Mackerel Sweet Mother of Mary....this flavor was new and quite a revelation. Yes, I need to come here more often and i don't care if parking is an adventure and the line takes longer than a foreign movie to end. It's damn worth it. Hey, I'll still love Mitchell's, and this just means there's another place to choose from. Let me put if this way: Mitchell's is a Ferrari and Bi-Rite is a Lamborghini. Their both unique and cream of the crop. Or better yet...Ice Cream of the crop.

Is there such thing as ambrosia? According to Wikipedia, ambrosia is "the food, sometimes the drink, of the Greek gods (or demigods), often depicted as conferring ageless immortality upon whoever consumes it." I would like to respectfully disagree with Wikipedia's take on this one. Ambrosia is found right here on earth, and it's sold by the cone and the pint at Bi-Rite Creamery in San Francisco. What exactly does this ambrosia consist of, you ask? ÊThe answer is malted vanilla, milk chocolate chip, peanut brittle ice cream. In case you were wondering, those are NOT 3 different flavors. ÊThe mad scientists (or are they Greek gods?) at Bi-Rite combine all 3 of those flavor layers to create the greatest ice cream in the history of man. And I got to taste it this past weekend! After spending a long Saturday afternoon getting sunburned at Dolores Park, I hopped over to Bi-Rite for a little cool-down. ÊLittle did I know that Bi-Rite would be an utterly orgasmic ice cream experience, and it would manifest in the form of a heaping cone of malted vanilla, milk chocolate chip, peanut brittle ice cream. One lick of this thing and I was walking on air. ÊIt more than made up for the long line to get in. Thanks to Bi-Rite, I think I can die happy. Ê(Sadly, while Bi-Rite ice cream is supremely delicious, this ambrosia doesn't confer immortality, omnipotent super-deity-style.)

I was so incredibly happy to FINALLY be going to Bi-Rite for ice cream. ÊBi-Rite has become the ice cream shop equivalent of Hawaii for me. Ê Everyone in my family, including mother, father, sister, brother, second cousin once-removed and a random great-aunt has been to Hawaii. ÊAlmost everyone I know has been to Hawaii. ÊExcept me. ÊI'm starting to get a complex. So my Bi-Rite complex has been growing because practically everyone I know has been there, fallen in love with one or more flavors and keeps telling me about them. ÊRepeatedly. Ê For my very first ever taste of this nirvana of frozen treats, I selected a dense, dark chocolate and a light, crisp ginger. ÊBoth were delicious. ÊBoth were gone in about 3 seconds. ÊNeither gave me a headache. I have to tell you, though...I wouldn't stand in a long line for it. ÊIt was great ice cream, no argument there. ÊBut in the world of "yes I will waste calories and $$ on this" sweet treats - it's not worth a line around the block.

We all know the story about poor Fatty Watty and her ever-expanding ass...Well, they may as well change the name to Fatty Autumn Two by Four. Because I am in love with a dangerous man! Dangerous man, Salted Caramel is thy name. And I have never, ever, never, never had it as good as Salty gives it to me. His friends, Lavender Honey and Cheesecake come in at a close second and third, but my loins and my tastebuds cry out for old Salty first and foremost. I managed to avoid this den of dirty pleasures until very recently. Upon my first visit, I was plied with sample after sample and two scoops for the price of my ass. Now, I'm playing favorites with my clients because of them. I run, breathless to my client meetings that put me in the vicinity of Bi-Rite and trudge resentfully to the meetings that do not. I am an addict. And soon I will be so fat that you will no longer recognize me. But it's ok. Salty loves fat sex. Tight ass and taught tummy, it's been swell! But I'm onto BIGGER and better things...

Sure, why not be review #1851, ya know? When I heard that the lineup was only 45 minutes long, I squealed - not in disbelief but because that was half the amount of time I'd. When shit's yelped in San Francisco, expect lineups. Even moreso if it's in The Mission and a major hipster magnet. I got a double portion ($4.75) with three flavours. From favourite to least: 1. Salted caramel: Oh. My. Gustav. Soooo good. On a return visit I'd totally fill up a bowl with just this flavour alone. 2. Brown sugar with caramel swirl. One of the flavours of the day. This was surprisingly the most plain of the three that I picked. It was good, but not strong enough of a flavour for me to remark on. 3. Creme fraiche: No.

Now I have heard so many many people raved about how good their ice cream here so I thought I outta give it a try since I am in this part of town. ÊFinding this ice cream place can be a little challenged. ÊI did not know that they have a Bi-Rite market so of course, I wonder into their like a stupid person loss and looking for ice cream. Once I finally got to the right place, there was a line down the street. ÊSo of course, I waited for some ice cream. ÊI might add, it was a bit nippy in San Francisco that afternoon. ÊAll I could think is that it better be good and worth the wait. ÊI was soooooo wrong. ÊOnce I got to order, I found that there are only so many flavors to choose from. ÊThey didn't even have any of the tropical flavors that I seen in other ice cream parlors. ÊVery disappointed. ÊI ordered the coconut toasted ice cream. ÊDid not see any coconut and it was just plain. ÊIt wasn't creamy like Mitchell and even in some of the store bought ice creams tasted better. ÊNothing special about this place at all. ÊYet there are so many people waiting in line for it. Ê I guess, if you waited long enough that you have to convince yourself that it is good just to make your conscience at peace. What made it even more painful is the fact that it took almost 30-45 minutes to find parking for ok ice cream.

Okay I have been here twice this year alone and I don't even live up here ^_^ ÊThe first time I would have given them 4 stars (http://www.kats9lives.coÉ) but the recent trip I would give it 5 stars. ÊSo I am going to bump them up to 5 stars when it's 4.5 stars. I think one part that made this visit better was that there was no line! I know it's shocking, but we went when it was really cold and nobody was there. ÊMuch more fun and less pressure on moving the line and keeping quiet lol. ÊWe were in and out within 5 mins. ÊScore! I LOVE their Salted Caramel... it has just the right sweetness with a hint of bitter saltiness... it kind of reminds me of burnt sugar, yummy! ^_^ Ever since last time I have been thinking about getting more so this time I just grabbed a nice tub from the freezer while I was there shopping for more ice cream flavors to try. Ê The first time I was here, I was not that big of a fan of what I had. ÊThis time I got to take my time and choose what I wanted after trying them out... all the flavors were great and flavorful. ÊThe Salted Caramel alone is worth coming for! I also liked the Honey Lavender this time around because it was just the right amount of flavor. ÊNot too overpowering and not soapy tasting. ÊAll the ice creams here have a great consistency and are really flavorful. Ê I miss you Bi-Rite! ~XOXOXO! ^_-

I am not a waiting in line person, so it was with some trepidation that I agreed to get some ice cream at Bi-Rite. Don't get me wrong, I've been wanting to go here for sometime, if anything to see what all the cold buzz was about. So finally, this Saturday afternoon, after going on an urban hike from DMV Heights to the Nission via Hayes Valley, our "yosse" ventured forth. Yeah, there was a line, but surprisingly it moved along smoothly. There are some nice benches outside to enjoy the day, also to lick your ice cream in the faces of those still waiting. Flavors: Of course the Salted Caramel is just as good as everyone says, but so is the Balsamic Strawberry. Heck, I'm going to go out on a proverbial limb here and say that almost all of their flavors are delicious and fresh. Will need to experiment of course, so more outings are planned. And next time, I'm gonna try a sundae, don't try and stop me.

I've been intrigued...Bi-Rite Creamery has been on the hot list on Yelp for awhile and I finally got to see what the craze is all about! With no parking in the area, I was dropped off around 7:30 (no line) and sent into the unknown. ÊI hopped back into the car with a Double ($4.75 for two to three flavor choices) of Brown Butter Pecan, Snickerdoodles with Cinnamon, and Salted Caramel. Ê(They were out of Mexican Hot Chocolate.) After the first bite, the Husband insisted we return again after dinner! ÊThis time it was 10 pm and a line that was snaking along the block. ÊWe got the Double again, this time Salted Caramel, Toffee Coffee, and Snickerdoodles with Cinnamon. ÊThe Salted Caramel is what everyone is talking about and it's so good...we like to think of it as See's Butterscotch Kisses! Ê Yes, a bit more expensive but you can taste the quality.

I was walking in the park, holding a three scoop Bi-Rite sunday when I realized something that made me a bit sad. I have never been stared at with the abject lust that my ice-cream was receiving from passersby. Bi-Rite makes some fine examples of tastiness, the salted caramel ice cream being a personal favorite. Be aware, there will be a line when you go. Now, I have been to three ice-cream parlors that consistently have long lines. Bi-Rite's wait to taste ratio is by far the best. It's worth it. Trust me. Next time I'm in San Francisco, I expect to go to Bi-Rite Creamery. On that day I will hold my treat close to the face and pretend that those looks are meant for me.

Lactardation be damned. ÊDespite the non-catchy, unmemorable name, Bi-Rite's ice cream was worth the 20 minute wait (winter, outside), the jelly belly (gelatinous, yet comforting), and chins (double, cascading into a triple because we returned the very next day). Ê It's that good. Ê Highly recommended, the Ricanelas was a cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodles. Oh hi. ÊDesserts are not my thing, but this flavor caused me to sob audibly into my eco-friendly napkin. Ê And then. Ê The famed Salted Caramel. ÊBurnt brown sugar cream magic may be an appropriate descriptor; thankfully, salt was NOT the first flavor. ÊThis blew my mind. Ê Ê Courtesy for my companions prevented me from slobbering over the liquid remains, but now, days later, despair. ÊBecause I'm still thinking of that dreamy salted caramel, and SF is 1,250,000 miles away. ÊIf anyone, ANYONE, can find me an equivalent in NY, I promise to buy you a jumbo cup.

I'm a dessert person. I intentionally save room while eating dinner just to have tummy space for ice cream. Steak? yes - I love it ... ice cream though?? I love it even MORE! I took a nice stroll through the city to get to Bi-Rite (in the hopes of burning off even just a small percentage of what I was about eat) and found myself in total awe at their selection of unique and creative flavors. In Seattle we're spoiled with Molly Moon's and Bluebird - but dangit' Bi-Rite, you kick butt! Rumor has it that their salted caramel and balsamic strawberry flavors are even better than Molly's. I opted for something totally new and got the roasted banana. Such a great choice! The ice cream was smooth and rich, the cones were fresh, and the service was quick. A line over 20 people long was scooted in and out the doors in less than 15 minutes. Pretty great! For this ice cream, I'd stand in line on a cold winter night anytime!

Okay. Bi-Rite convert. Salted caramel is like my mind exploding and for some reason makes me think of strippers. The chocolate was lovely, like rainbows and kittens.

Over 3,000 reviews... are you kidding me? Dang this place gets around! Apparently, the line that I waited in to get my ice cream was pretty small to what they usually have... so go expecting to wait, but what you get at the end of that wait is well worth it. They have interesting flavors such as salted caramel, honey lavender, brown sugar with ginger caramel, etc. However, don't let these unique flavors deter you. Not only are they quite spectacular... Bi-Rite also lets you ask for a sample taste of flavors before you pick the one you want. Definitely a "must visit" if you're in SF!

ÊI can handle fellow sugar addicts, but cold, wet, bored, potentially violent sugar addicts waiting to get their fix? ÊNo thanks. Ê So yeah, when we passed BRC last night, I saw my chance and took it. ÊTurns out their ice cream's pretty decent. ÊIt's really the fixins that give it the fourth star. ÊThey use the quality goods. ÊWe ordered the Brownie Sundae and the Berry Sundae (gotta try their sh*t before you start getting creative). Ê Most ice cream shoppes use the driest, nastiest piece of crusted chocolate in their brownie sundaes, but BRC actually uses a moist slab of brownie that one might even consider eating without the ice cream. ÊThey top that mofo off with vanilla bean ice cream, hot fudge, caramel, and spiced pecans. ÊTheir hot fudge is totally weak sauce, though. ÊTheir Berry Sundae was a generous lump of ginger ice cream topped with a fresh, tart berry compote and bite-sized pieces of ginger snap cookies. ÊNot bad. Ê But come on, Mitchell's has halo halo. ÊAnd all kind of tropical flavors, like jackfruit and coconut. ÊThe flavors of my people. ÊIf you don't have halo halo and/or your hot fudge blows, you don't get 5 stars from me.

ÊNow this place is not hyped up and all talk like ...well, I won't go there but you get my point. ÊYou don't? ÊTrust me; Bi-Rite has flavors to blow your mind! ÊRoasted Banana, Salty Caramel, Orange Pomegranate Sorbet, Brown Butter Pecan, Coffee Toffee etc. Being that I was an ice cream virgin to this place, I wanted to get something that will sure give my ice cravings a kick in the ass! ÊSo what the heck, I asked for a scoop of Salty Caramel and a scoop of Coffee Toffee. ÊTalk about a combo! ÊA combo that is just as good as Pacquiao's combo punches against his boxing foes. Ê The perfect amount of saltiness with the smooth, silk taste of caramel, you definitely can't just have ONE bite. ÊTalk about a taste bud boost! ÊThe Coffee Toffee has to be thee best coffee ice cream I ever tasted! ÊYou definitely get that rich coffee taste and you can also see it as well. ÊI'm talking about the lil coffee grinds that you can see every time you take a bite. ÊThe amount of toffee is just right, it adds another depth of flavor and sweetness to it. Ê If you haven't been to Bi-Rite before, get there. ÊYou'll thank me later..

Okay, fine, this really is the best freaking ice cream place ever! ÊIt's a really big deal to say "best ever" but it's true... I got really lucky both times I went here bc there was no line. ÊTook my ice cream to Dolores Park and people watched. ÊSF is amazing... Anyway, Salted Caramel needs no more praise... it's damn good. ÊBut the Roasted Banana was also delicious! ÊSo I just want to give it a little extra special attention. ÊIt actually tasted like roasted banana (not funky cardboard)... it was creamy, smooth, and delicious. Ê What can I say, I love bi-rite!

This place is uhhhhhh-MAZING !!!!!!!!!!!!! With over 1200 reviews and 4 1/2 stars on yelp, I had to try this place. ÊAt first, ÊI was a bit hesitant to try this place because the salted caramel flavor and organic ingredients everyone was raving about just turned me off. ÊBUT, I am sooooooo glad I went to this place!!! It was hands down the most tasty ice cream I've ever had. ÊI tried the coffee toffee and one flavor, I forgot the name, but it had bits of snickerdoodle cookies in it!! ÊAmazing! Now, I haven't tried Mitchell's yet, and I know it's another Yelp favorite spot for ice cream, but I really can't see how ice cream can get any better than Bi-Rites at this point.

One Sunday: 11:00 AM rolls out of bed. 12:30 PM morning bun & latte at Tartine; finally got there early enough to get the morning bun, which is usually sold out by the time I roll in around 2:00 PM for my "morning coffee." 2:00 PM drags 6 loads of laundry to Wash & Dry. 4:20 PM jogs around Dolores Park - killer hill. 5:00 PM lays on the grass at Dolores Park. 7:00 PM picks up a whole chicken at Limon Rotisserie for dinner; kills 1/2 bird by 7:45, stuffed. 8:30 PM feeling like salted caramel ice cream at Bi-Rite....no, that would negate the workout! 9:00 PM fighting the temptation.... 9:45 PM almost winning against the temptation...Bi-Rite closes at 10:00 PM. 9:49 PM sudden change of mind, grabs a purse and leaves the apartment. 9:55 PM arrives at Bi-Rite; there still is a long line 10:15 PM creme fraiche & brown sugar ginger caramel in a cup... Life is good.

What's THIS?! ÊANOTHER ice cream place?? ÊWell ..... yeah! Went here the other night after a disappointing new restaurant in the area, but good wine and good company can overcome that. I've been here twice and have not been disappointed yet. ÊToo bad, both times, I couldn't finish what I ordered. ÊBoth times I took some pints to go, and both times they were gone in a day. ÊThe flavors rotate often, and are a cut above vanilla. I like the selection here, as it's not as "vanilla" as Humphrey Slocomb, which is it's only downfall. ÊParking is non existent, and at least one side is a tow away zone at times, so be careful.

For my birthday, my husband took me to San Francisco for a day of museums and lunch. I couldn't decide whether I wanted to try the ice cream at Bi-Rite or at Humphry Slocombe, so he took me to both because he is really just the best. Bi Rite's ice cream was amazing. The texture was almost fluffy, yet substantial. We had the salted caramel and the honey lavender flavors. The salted caramel is so talked up, I thought it would be incredibly amazing, but it was only amazing. I thought it would be saltier. I like salt with my sweet, and that is what I was hoping for. It did, however, taste like delicious deep brown caramel straight off the stovetop. The honey lavender was even more amazing than I thought it would be. It was sweet like honey and its lavender aroma reminded me of the soap at Harbin Hot Springs. I would buy a large amount of this ice cream and get really fat with it. I'd love to try some of the other flavors, but I don't make it out to SF very often, and when i do it is to visit my lactose intolerant grandparents. Oh well, maybe for my next birthday...

Bi-Rite and Humphry: it's just so hard to play favorites, I love you both! ÊBut Bi-Rite often wins out simply based on location. Ê By now I've tried half a dozen flavors, but the Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl always seems to lift my day and make everything better, if just for awhile. ÊWhich is exactly what an amazingly good scoop of ice cream is supposed to do. Ê Five stars, Bi-Rite, for a job well done.

This place is all right 7 bucks for what would be considered a "love it" cup from coldstones creamery. I got the banana split. They used a flame to Caramelize the banana which was very unique to me. It gave the banana an unexpected hard candy taste. Workers are nice. They put a whole shit load of whippitdacream that fooled you to think you got your money's worth. Which cost them their two stars. 70% of my banana split was whipped cream. :( tear.

All right! ÊAbout time I found a place worthy of a 5 star review. Ê First of all, I apologize for no pictures. ÊWe stuffed our faces with our purchases before I could get around to bringing my camera out. ICE CREAM: OMFG. ÊI'm so mad at myself that, for all the years I was growing up in San Francisco, I never ventured to Bi-Rite for ice cream. I went and got gypped at Bombay Creamery instead. Ê My friend BK and I stopped by the soft serve stand first and sampled the balsamic vinegar strawberry soft serve. Ê HOLY SH*T. ÊThat was so friggin delish I almost forgot that I was on a mission to try their actual scoopable ice cream and was about to break through the window and suck that soft serve directly out of the machine. Fields of strawberry dreams indeed! Thank God BK pulled me back by my collar and ushered me next door, or else I would have never sampled their unbelievably orgasmic brown butter and pecan flavor ice cream. Yum. Like eating a creamier pecan pie. ÊI also enjoyed a half scoop of roasted banana, which tasted like Entemann's banana cake - so that said, you either love it or you don't. I loved it. BK passed. Ê She instead opted for the honey lavendar, which I already know is amazing because I bought it in a pint before, and the ginger brown-sugar swirl, which is amazing and refreshing. Ê Both of our ice creams had JUST the right texture I like in my ice cream - firm and sticky and doesn't melt too quickly. It was hard to stop after one scoop, but well... gotta watch the expanding food baby... AMBIENCE: Very cute, small space with a few very small tables and chairs. Most people just grab their ice cream and enjoy it at nearby Dolores Park. ÊService was friendly enough, nothing to write home about, although I did appreciate that the store uses all organic products and metal taster spoons that they wash and reuse rather than wasting plastic spoons. An "A" for environmental awareness! PRICES: $3.25 for a single scoop of up to 1-2 flavors. ÊA bit pricey, but not too bad when you consider the quality of the ingredients used. Also, if you get the punch card your 10th ice cream scoop is free. I'd say it's a place that gives Scoops in LA a run for its money. PARKING: Seriously, who would drive here when it takes longer to find parking in the Mission District than it does to drive here from anywhere in the city? ÊStreet parking only.

On the prowl New Years day we were jonsin for some ice cream. We had our hearts set on Mitchells, but to no avail... they were closed. I really wanted to have some ube ice cream, drooool. We then proceeded to bi-rite to get our ice cream fix as a consolation. Since it was my first time, I of course had to try all the different flavors. I started with their most popular and then picked a few from there. I think I could get full on the samples alone since they give you full sized spoons filled with ice cream as a taster. ÊAfter the little tasting session we had settled on three scoops with salted caramel, malted vanilla with peanut brittle, and a brown sugar ice cream. It didn't hurt that the worker also had pointed out that they went well with one another. In order of favorite I have to say the brown sugar was number one followed by the malted vanilla, and the most popular salted caramel last. Ê All in all I don't think there was anything too special about bi-rite. I think ici or even fentons offers better ice cream, but different strokes for different folks. I ended up eating some store bought jamocha almond fudge with a brownie thrown in it later that evening; delicious.

We were in the Mission District in search of SF street food vendors, but after an hour of walking all over, we concluded that our search was unsuccessful. ÊOn the flip side, we saw Bi-Rite Creamery and I told my friends that they're in the "8 Great Ice Cream Parlors In and Around SF" list according to Gourmet Magazine. ÊIt was 60 degrees but there was no way I was going pass up the opportunity to try their ice cream (especially since it was one of the places that I bookmarked to try on my Yelp). We ordered the following: Cookies & Cream, Vanilla with Raspberry, Chocolate and Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle. ÊAll of us got the kid's scoop but it was more than plenty. ÊAnd the ice cream? ÊIt was amazing! ÊIt was smooth and creamy; you could definitely tell the difference between freshly made ice cream to store bought ones. ÊI haven't had ice cream in a while (I mostly get yogurt nowadays) because I've always felt it was too heavy that gives you a bloated feeling afterwards, but Bi-Rite ice cream was pretty light... I did not feel guilty at all! Although I didn't get to have my SF street food experience, I was ecstatic finding this place.

I returned to Bi-Rite early last week with a couple coworkers after having dinner in the Mission. "Damn you Bi-Rite" is all I can say. I say this in part because it is on the other side of the bay from where I live and in part because it's so heavenly, rich and amazing. The flavors are precise with just the perfect mix of sweet and savory. Of course the Salted Caramel and the Balsamic Strawberry are fantastic, but I stayed away from my usual and ordered the Roasted Banana and Cherry Almond (because I love that you can order two flavors in a small ice cream) The roasted banana is absolutely perfect with an obvious fresh, not at all artificial taste of banana. The cherry almond was fantastic as well, with whole pieces of cherry and subtle flavors of amaretto or something similar. I tried the brown sugar ice cream as well (which had slight hints of ginger), but that was completely eclipsed when I tried the amazing cherry almond. The line was short when we went (about 9pm on a Wednesday). We were in and out of the store quite quickly and had time to savor our amazing ice creams as I walked back to bart and they walked back to muni to get them home. Damn you Bi-Rite. Damn you for your delicious ice cream and everything you do.

I walked in the freezing cold with a group of friends on a late weekday evening to come try their famous salted caramel flavored ice cream featured on The Big Eat SF 7x7 list. Single scoop (1 or 2 flavors) - Salted Caramel: smooth, creamy, sweet, and a little bit salty buttery - goodness. - Toasted Coconut: I love eating coconut flavored popsicles, but this one is in a smooth and creamy form. So good with bits of shredded coconut too! I was surprised there wasn't a line when we arrived, but we beat the rush because many customers came afterward. I wanted to sample all flavors, but was limited due to the line forming behind me. The employees were very lively and energetic even during the late evening hours, plus! Their flavors are simple and not as hard to get used to as Humphry's unique flavors. But both exert high quality ice cream in their own way. They also have interesting popsicle flavors that I want to try next time Ê(blood orange, pineapple with mint, lime blackberry, etc. Flavors change, call for daily selection). P.S. If you can't get enough of their ice creamy goodness, they sell pints, baked goods, and ice cream cakes/pies too!

I quite like salted caramel. Okay, okay, I have an absolutely inconsolable enthrallment with salted caramel. One so unquenchable that it would cause me to drag my dining companion to Bi-Rite Creamery BEFORE dinner just to procure some salted caramel ice cream (in my defense, they close at 10:00 and our dinner reservation was at 9:30.) Upon entering the compact shop on 18th Street I was immediately taken with it - from the ice cream flavors scrawled on the outside window to the fresh baked treats that line the shelves along the wall. I tasted the goat yogurt but passed it up and chose one scoop of the salted caramel and one of the cookies and cream instead. This turned out to be a fantastically perfect combination. The woman behind me saw it, said I'd read her mind and went on to order the exact same thing. NOTES: The bowls and utensils are compostable Features Straus Family Creamery dairy products The ice cream sandwiches look amazing and next time I will get one CONCLUSION: Before dinner, after dinner, whatever the time, Bi-Rite Creamery is a must for ice cream lovers! UPDATE JAN 14, 2007: Returned for more salted caramel ice cream and this time also tried mint chip. 5 STARS for Bi-Rite Creamery!

On our way to Tartine to keep the food-freakfest going, I spotted Bi-Rite from the corner of my eye. ÊI had heard the rumors of their deliciousness on Yelp, but here I was already full from Monk's Kettle, on our way to Tartine to have a sweet indulgence, and oh why Lord why did you have to put Bi-Rite in my way?! ÊAs we passed by I noticed several people sitting outside with ice cream sundaes. Ê"Cripes in 40 degree weather with the wind blowing up a storm they're eating ice cream?," I said to myself, "Its gotta be good!" Ê Needless to say, the guys and I got something to go from Tartine and headed straight to Bi-Rite to satisfy my sweet tooth jones. ÊThe rumors of Bi-Rite's orgasmic flavors, oh yes they're true. ÊRoasted bananas and toasted coconut were my choices and my friend got the toffee coffee. ÊA testament to the deliciousness of their ice cream: Êmy friend's New Year's resolution was to stop eating ice cream. ÊShyea right Bi-Rite broke him of that 2 days into the New Year!! Due to their graciousness and willingness to put up with our fat asses we also tried the creme fraiche, ricanela, honey-lavender, salted caramel, brown butter pecan, and other forms of ice cream crack that I can't remember. ÊOne word: Êscrumdiddlyumptious. ÊI usually like a denser ice cream with less air whipped in but how can you complain - its so good, once it hits your lips its so good!! ÊThe different flavors we tried were all nicely balanced too, not too sweet, and with a good ratio of unadulterated ice cream to whatever goodies were mixed in. ÊBonus points for being able to choose two flavors when you order a single and for their other delicious wares. ÊI brought home a Bi-Rite Rocky Road chocolate bar (dark and milk chocolate, housemade marshmallows, and almonds) and best believe that was the best $6 candy bar I've bought in a loooooong time.

After dinner in the mission I decide to finally try Bi-rite Creamy and see if it is really as good as everyone says. 1st sign that is is as good as people say: I turn onto the block with Bi-Rite and think "all these people must be in line for a club" right? Nope the crowd I saw in line was actually for Bi-Rite. Really? Must be good. 2nd sign that is is as good as people say: I ask the people behind me if the line is normal for a weekend night. ÊThey tell me the line is actually a Êlittle light. A line at 9:30 at night for ice cream? Must be good. 3rd sign that is is as good as people say: ÊOnce home I realized that my hand-packed mixed pint of Salted Caramel (smoky &amp; creamy), Ritual Coffee Toffee (Ben &amp; Jerry's has nothing on this) and Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel (the best of the three) was melting. So before putting it in the freezer I try a spoonful. ÊHalf a pint later all I'm thinking is "Wow that is way better than people say!" The only miss: the toffee cookies are kinda "meh". ÊAnd while I didn't like the cookies they don't warrant one less star.

As part of my sf adventure I went to check out this highly yelp Bi-Rite creamery. The time I went they aren't busy at all. The cashier were very attentive and offer us many samples. I immediately went for the salted caramel and honey lavender. Salted caramel was good, but honey lavender I decided to pass, personally it's weird to eat something that smell like a lotion. lol~ The cashier told us his personally favorites were the snickerdoole and the early gray tea! I got to agree with him on this one, those two I love. Esp, early gray tea. It is sweet yet not overpowering. What perfect balance. I might just find myself a new favorite ice cream. lol~ with so many selections... my friend and I end up both getting two scoop of ice cream of our choice. He made his into a make your own sundae and I got a 2 scoop. yay.. I shall be back!

Bi-Rite DREAMERY is more like it. We finally checked this place out. We found parking two blocks away. There was no line. Maybe there IS a God. Husband and I had just eaten dinner at Regent Thai and I was making the push for a quick trip over to 18th and Dolores. It doesn't take much to convince husband to indulge in dairy-free delights. He was in. On the way there, I summarized Laura B's hilarious review, told him that Frisco J raved about the ginger ice cream (I love all things ginger) and that Tania C was all about the honey lavender and roasted banana. I glanced over at husband to meet his blank stare. He thinks I'm crazy hooked on Yelp. He's right. Well, that all changed once he tasted the magic of their soy chocolate ice cream. He'll be givin' thanks to Yelp Vegan Goddess Laura B for a long, long time! As for me, I had a scoop of ginger and a scoop of roasted banana in a small cup. My only regret is that I didn't get a large! I'll say it. This place is better than Maggie Mudd. It's better than Mitchell's. The texture and flavors are out of control. And it's just so freakin' adorable in there! P.S. They also have some serious baked goods in there. By serious, I mean they look insanely decadent, delicious, and perfect.

Of course I had to go to the legendary Bi-Rite Creamery my first night in town. ÊI wasn't sure I'd be able to try anything other than sorbet (boring!) since I'm lactose intolerant, so I practically jumped for joy when I saw they had a non-dairy ice cream option. The vegan chocolate coconut tasted like it was made from coconut milk and was nice and creamy. ÊVery delicious. ÊWhat a treat to get two scoops on a sugar cone and walk around the Mission district.

There has to be a real good reason for me to venture into the Mish because parking is abhorrent. ÊBut, vocalizing "Gladys, Gladys, Gladys" must've helped as we found parking in front of Delores Park with 2 ambulances parked in front of us with the paramedics next to their vehicles. ÊNever know if you should need medical help. ÊWe were only one block from Bi-Rite. ÊAs for Gladys? ÊSt. Gladys is the patron saint of parking, who'd guess? ÊMy co-worker, Gladys, tells me she never has trouble finding parking..... I love the fact that they use organic dairy products from Straus Creamery in Marin. ÊTheir milk is sooo good and needless to say, the ice cream here is fabulous and not overly sweet compared to Haagen-Dazs. ÊStill, at $7 for a pint of organic ice cream, it's hard to swallow when you can get 2 pints of HD for $7 at your local Safeway on sale. A small ice cream in cup or cone costs a tad over $3 and you can get 1-2 flavors. ÊI got a sm scoop of toasted coconut (nice toasty flavor) and vanilla (had bits of vanilla bean in it), both were very good. Hubs had the choc coconut (OK) but his vanilla malt was excellent with bits of nuts in it. ÊI'd consider buying a pint of that, it was like eating a vanilla milkshake. ÊThe ice cream was worth the trip into the Mish. ÊYum.

So i remember reading about bi-rite creamery and i wanted to see what all the hype was about. Parking was a bitch, couldn't find any after 4 rounds around the block. So me and my cousin just got dropped off in front while my brother drove around again. They had alot of crazy flavors, i choose the salted carmel. My cousin looked at me real funny when i got that flavor cause it didn't sound so good to him. After i took the first spoon full my face just lit up, and he asked me how is it? I was like "this shits off the hook son" and he too had to try the salted carmel. I also tried some of the chocolate coconut and the ginger swirl both of those were also great. ($3.25 / single scoop in a cup) This place lives up to the hype, they make some great ice cream. But I still think i like ICI more in the eastbay. 5 Stars for Bi-Rite Creamery in SF

Uh, can we say YUM? A bit pricey? Yea. A bit pretentious? Maybe. Friggen delicious? Hell yea. The hardest part about coming here is deciding what flavors to get. I usually succumb to the 3 scoops. Salted caramel is a favorite, you can taste the burnt sugar notes with flecks of sea salt. I'd also recommend the ricanelas, cinnamon ice cream with chunks of chewy snickerdoodle cookies, SO GOOD.

It was freezing outside but after hearing and reading all the rave reviews, I knew I had to try their ice cream! This is not to be confused with the Bi-Rite market that's on the same street only a couple blocks down! My friends and I originally walked into the market and were a bit confused... Anyway, once you find your way into the Bi-Rite CREAMERY, you must try the SALTED CARAMEL! It is delicious! Yes, it's as good as everyone says! It's the perfect combination of sweet and salty, the 2 kinds of flavors my tastebuds are constantly craving. I also tried the Honey Lavender which was also yummy but I didn't quite fall in love with that one. But I'm not a huge lavender fan to begin with either. But the name of the flavor explains it all. Think lavender with a hint of sweetness. My friends also got the Brown Sugar and the Snickerdoodle flavors which were also sweet and delicious and tasted exactlyyy like their names. If you're in SF and in Mission, this place is a MUST-TRY!!

God I love ice cream. The things I will do for a good scoop of ice cream... don't get me started. Bi-rite has the taste of home. Everything is made with care, you can taste that and the quality ingredients in the ice cream. House-made toppings like hot fudge and caramel make me want to hop on a flight to San Fran right now. It's what Ben and Jerry's must have been like when it was a small shop in Vermont. Scoops are small but that's OK. So are the long lines that sometimes wrap around the block. With the park across the street, on a warm sunny day, Bi-Rite can't be beat. Oh and the selection of unique flavors will really blow your mind. Yum!

Oh. My. God. ÊI'll pay it. ÊWhatever amount you ask of me, I will cheerfully pay it. ÊI have been spoiled for Ben & Jerry. ÊForever. ÊFor I have partaken of the nectar that is salted caramel ice cream and it is to die for. ÊI got a double scoop and it was half eaten by the time I paid, waited for the girl to retrieve my snazzy new t-shirt, and got back to the car. ÊIt is that good. ÊAnd not only is it supremely delicious, but they keep it at a perfect temperature and consistency. ÊYou know how sometimes you stick ice cream in the microwave to soften up just the teensiest bit? ÊWhat? ÊNo one else does that? ÊHmm. ÊOkay, carrying on. ÊBi-Rite's consistency is spot-on. Next time I will get a ginormous sundae with the salted caramel ice cream and caramel sauce and pecans and whipped cream and instead of a spoon I will eat it with one of their amazing toffee chip cookies and then I will die happy. ÊThe end.

1341 reviews and 4.5 stars? That is ABSURD I tell you!!! ÊI know Yelp started in the Bay Area and all, but I seriously feel like a repetitive little peon. ÊYou don't really need me to tell you just how good this is. It wasn't busy at all when I went on a Thursday night. ÊI guess it was pretty cold. ÊIt's pretty much a buy-and-leave kinda place because there are only three stools with a little bit of counter space. ÊIf it's not busy then you can stand inside a bit for extra warmth. ÊI tried the following flavors: Salted Caramel (perfect!) Coffee Toffee (big toffee bits) Cookies 'n Cream (cookies are soooo soft!) Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirls (very unique and light!) I chose the single scoop ($3.25) over the kids size ($2.25) for the sole fact that you can get one more flavor, but it was too much for me especially having had dinner right before. ÊThe ice cream itself really has a homemade quality to it and I love how all the ingredients are local and organic. ÊGo SF! ÊThey even have vegan flavors which taste close to the real thing. Ê Ê There are few "regular" flavors served here and I'm glad. ÊIt's nice to have something different, plus each one contains so many elements it's like a party in your mouth. ÊIt makes me wonder if those old fashioned parlors with your familiar flavors will survive. ÊNow the Asian dude helping us has a very friendly vibe. ÊSome people came in and they didn't know what flavors to choose so he said "it's like your first year in college; just try it out and you'll find yourself later on."

Oh Bi-Rite Creamery, after being an established Pharmaceutical/Local Supermarket for many of those in this side of the Mission. Those artisan flavors of yours that entice us are truly splendid on hot faux summer day (it was the middle of September for crying out loud) gone by. I came here out of pure suggestion and hype from Yelpers, Friends, and Local SF dessert lovers alike. Everywhere I go, after mentioning Mitchell's or Humphry. Bi-Rite Creamery would be a suggestion hanging on the coattails of my ice cream trek gone to an end (at least in the Bay Area). JTS and I managed, to have one free day in the final week before a long awaited departure from the old roaming grounds. As a side note parking was very tricky (and disappointing considering the outrageous citation courtesy of the Douchebag SF Parking Patrol). So be wary when trying to find a place to rest your car before you get screwed over. In any case, we went inside and like fickle minded children we couldn't decide what to get even after a few samples: -Honey Lavender (it's like honey dipped onto mellow but sweet flower on a spring day in cream form; redundant, yes but hard to explain) -Salted Caramel (A lot better than my Fleur De Lys addiction from Haagen Daz, not so much salt but the caramel was decadent) -Strawberry-Kiwi (vegan style; had no recollection on the kiwi-attribute, it was tart on the strawberry side though) -Creme Fraiche (Creme Brulee, but more butter than anything, in terms of texture and flavor) -Chocolate (was consistent in texture and taste but not an avid chocolate fan, as a standalone) So what we ended up ordering were the following: -1 Double Scoop on an Ice Cream Cone: Cookies and Cream and Chocolate for JTS -1 Double Scoop on an Ice Cream Cone: Balsamic Strawberry and Brown Butter Pecan The Cookies and Cream and Chocolate were consistent to their contenders in the rest of the Ice Cream-dom. Smooth and creamery, with the chunks of Cookies all around the vanilla. The Chocolate, was exactly as I described it as a sample. The Balsamic Strawberry did disappoint, now I'm no condiment whore on my salads. But Balsamic should have a hint of sour flavor when blended with anything (maybe somewhat dominant in a lot of aspects). But the strawberry was a bit overwhelming for that sour taste, and therefore voided in the creamery confines of the cone. It was as if, I tried only a strawberry scoop without the bits of strawberry chunks. Lastly, the Brown Butter Pecan, was on point. Pecan bits were definitely in full effect, and kind of reminiscent of Scoops' (Los Angeles, Ca.) take on "Brown Bread" for flavor and texture contrast in combination. Overall, we spent about $12.00 plus tax (no tip necessary). As my final conclusion of this trip, Bi-Rite came at a close second, to Humphry only due to less "unorthodox and more on the conventional flavors." Becoming a more avid gourmet, I feel the need to try stuff that's a bit more "out of the box." Therefore on the spectrum of Ice Creams in SF would be as follows: Mitchell's For the Tradition, Bi-Rite for the Medium, and Humphry for the Adventurous (more of my preference all thanks to their Secret Breakfast). Thanks for bearing with my delay on this series of reviews, folks! Now is time to play catch up, to inform you all on of the other food spots I've scoured, cheers!

[Featured: ÊBest Thing I Ever Ate, Sugar Rush Episode, Food Network] Best Ice Cream I've had Period. Okay, not period. ÊI want to say more. Ê I first saw Bi-Rite when it was featured on the Food Network on a show called, "The Best Thing I Ever Ate." Ê They featured the SAM'S SUNDAE: chocolate ice cream with organic bergamot olive oil, maldon sea salt and hand-whipped cream. ÊThat's right, ice cream with olive oil and salt! ÊThe olive oil has a citrus flavor. ÊMix that in with the sweetness of the chocolate ice cream, the salty sea salt...and the smoothness of the whipped cream...amazing, simply amazing. ÊI just learned that this place was also featured in the NY Times, Forbes, GQ, and Bon Appetit. Ê Luckily, I went there with three other friends and we decided to maximize the experience by going family-style. ÊEverything was awesome. Ê We all knew about the famed salted-caramel. ÊThat lived up to the hype. ÊI fell in love with the Roasted Banana. ÊThen again, the Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces was damn good too. ÊArgh. ÊSo confusing, I love them all. Ê I love this place. ÊI love their mission statement, their history, their commitment to local, organic, and sustainable ingredients. ÊAlso, I'm a big fan of Straus Family Creamery. ÊMy 19 month old loves Straus. ÊAnyway, they are the first ice cream shop in San Francisco to use Strauss Family Farms organic dairy in their ice cream. ÊCool, eh? Ê In sum, what a great night: Êdinner at Spork (review forthcoming) + ice cream at Bi-Rite + chilaxin at Dolores Park. ÊThank you Bi-Rite, you are totally awesome.

Some friends and I came to Bi-Rite yesterday after an afternoon of sitting in the park talking about, genuinely, nothing. ÊI felt like I was in a Seinfeld episode. ÊBut it could not have been a better time. We waited in line to place our orders, once up to the front of the queue I was met with a very friendly server behind the counter. ÊShe asked me what I would like and I told her "something with spice." She pulled out a few spoons and gave me samples of the ginger and the ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodle bits). ÊI was in love after sampling the two and got a scoop of each on a cone. ÊIt was the best $4.25 I'd spent all day! I recommend and would definitely return.

Now I know what people are talking about. That honey lavender Ice cream was delicious. This place is like a boutique creamery or whatever. Uniqueness is what it strives for, i guess. Of course, like almost all of sf... no plastic.... so disappointing, especially when the ice cream is as pricey as it is. I can buy 2 cartons of ice cream with the price I paid for 2 scoops. It's good, but I don't think it's something I would regularly pay for. Dreyer's can still make me feel the same way, if not better.

Sitting here in front of my computer like a work monkey, I suddenly had a great urge to yelp. My God. What do I yelp? What makes me feel oh-so-good. Ice cream. Ice Cream makes me scream for more ice cream. More specifically, SALTED freaking CARAMEL ice cream. What a gold mine. If I had invented Salted caramel ice cream flavor, I would patent it and charge all ice cream distributors a million dollars to sell my delicious flavored ice cream. Bi-rite made this flavor to be adored by me.

Arrived there at 10:45 to a closed shop...or so I thought. Ê ..."Sir...can you please just let us in. ÊWe came all the way from So Cal and took a $20 cab ride just to come here to try this spot. ÊYou gotta help us" ..."uhm miss, the ice cream shop's that way". ..."oh" Lesson learned, leave your visine tears and sob story at home, and head to the ice cream shop on the corner and not the market just a couple of shops away. We ordered: Salted Caramel (4 STARS) Honey Lavendar (5 STARS) Roasted Banana (4.5 STARS if you like banana) While I liked Salted Caramel, it only took like 5 spoonfuls before it got too sweet for me. ÊAlso, I just came back from Phoenix not too long ago and had ice cream topped with salted caramel and chocolate covered cornuts from Postino, so it's pretty hard to top that =D With that said, honey lavendar FTW. ÊThere's something to be said about subtle sweetness that makes it so delicious. ÊYou know what this reminded me of? ÊChrysanthemum tea. ÊIt's as though this is what Chrysanthemum Tea Ice Cream would be if they put it in ice cream form. Ê500 points for tasting like one of my all time favorite drinks.

you CANT go to SF without hitting up the 7x7 100 things you must eat before you die list right?! well Bi-Rite is included in that list for its salted caramel ice cream so we hopped over to the SHORT LINE at off peak hours!!! HORRAY for "1 scoop" including 2 flavors!!! ---salted caramel was a dissapointment... i dont know why.. but it tasted burnt to all of us.. none of us enjoyed it!!!!! ---coffee toffee... SO GOOD.. coffee ice cream never fails & when you add buttery toffee its just that much better!! the ice cream is rich & thick, but if you aren't into ice cream, Bi-rite also has a soft serve/bakery window down the street with 2 diff flavors each day! ---mint chocolate soft serve was good ---picnic chocolate cake was okay.. kind of reminded me of boxed mix ---cookie sandwich.. looked better than it tasted... SKIP THE SOFT SERVE WINDOW.. DIVE INTO THE ICE CREAM LINE!

Prime location across the street from SF's best small park (Dolores), and walking distance from all that is great in the Mission, Bi-Rite Creamery is perhaps the best-located and best tasting Ice Cream Shop in all of the Bay Area. The obnoxiously long lines are worth the wait and all the hype, as Bi-Rite provides great flavor selections that are well balanced and put a smile on the face and hearts of all its patrons. People will swear by the played out and over used Salt Caramel, but I would recommend you try many of the other worthy flavor offerings. Ê Bi-Rite serves the most well rounded ice cream around, providing a nice balance of flavor, consistency, and creaminess. Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê I would call this place flawless, but I feel that the ice cream is served at too low of a temperature and usually wait a few moments to allow the ice cream to soften up a bit. The flavor rotation is a bit weak and too safe at times, but why take risks when you don't have to. ÊThese people know exactly what they are doing and need not deviate from their successful formula. Ê But other than that, Bi-Rite is a definite stop on the Ice Cream pilgrimage and is arguably the best ice cream shop in California. Highly Recommended

I was very excited for this place to open... I stop in, try to buy some ice cream but they dont accept debit cards for under $10.00. I came back and got 2 scoops witha tiny drizzle of Hot fudge sauce (which is not hot by the way) and it was 3.50. The pint of ice cream i got to make it over 10 dollars had to be 9 bucks, because my total was 13.00. To me this doesn't seem worth it. Yes, the ice cream is tasty, but the price and the whole vibe is off the mark. I feel that when they get the wrinkles ironed out it could turn into a good spot for a quick scoop. Till then, ill pass. Pro's: Ice Cream is tasty, organic and its close. Cons: Price are redic, hot fudge is weak and its a bit snobby... __________________________________________________?__ Second Chance review: I am officially over this "ice ceam"shop... Normally I would abide byt he "if you don't have anything good to say..." rule, but I just think this place is honestly a mediocre at best frozen milk shop. Ê Honestly, it's way too expensive, the wooden spoons they gave you have more taste than the "Ice Cream" and the whole bandwagon-ness of it take all the fun out of what is traditionally a great time. This "ice cream" shop gives real ice cream places a bad name. Sadly I don't see it closing anytime soon. OVER IT! ________________________________ Third Chance review: Still sucks...

5 starring and a fan not for the usual salted caramel (although it was good) but for the stellar non-dairy option. Cost to worth it rating: 3 ($3.25 for single 2 flavors) Eve award: best non-dairy ice cream Highlights: - Lactose intollerant friendly: the best dairy-free ice cream I have ever had by a mile! Most non-dairy options in grocery stores or ice cream shops taste like gum even at their best. This could go undercover as ice cream and not get found out--amazing! To make it even better, the flavor was chocolate coconut, one of my favorite desserty flavor combinations. They also have a sorbet option. - Ingredients: organic and mostly around 5 or less per flavor (beats even Breyer's). Love that! - Economically friendly: paper cups and classic wooden paddle for a spoon. - Popsicles: few flavors a day which was pretty cool. Lowlights: - Flavors of the day not listed on their website. A la Hot Doug's in Chicago, would be nice to know what's available before waiting in line. Didn't expect to jump on the bandwagon, as I don't each so much ice cream, but did love it so I'll be back to check out more non-dairy offerings.

1500+ reviews already? ÊDamn its a sad realization for a yelper when he hasn't already been part of that first 1000 who have unanimously voted for bi-rite's greatness. ÊNeed I say more about the place? Ê And because of that, it explains why on a cool 59 F degrees Monday night at 9:30pm while Dolores Park's blazing bright field lights just beam down on 18th St illuminating the line that STILLL exists at this time of day. ÊSimply amazing....but not as amazing as the 3 flavors my friends and I decided to check out. ÊAnd what makes Bi-Rite great is the seating area outside that lets you enjoy the delight while people watching in the Dolores area. Ê We tried the following: - Salted Caramel - yes, its good....it meets the hype - Toasted Coconut - didn't know THISS one huh? ÊIf you're as crazed on coconut as I am.....winner right here. - Balsamic Strawberry - pretty good, but doesn't seem too far from the regular taste of strawberry - Honey Lavender - I just came to a realization lavender should just stay as a color in my head, but I could see it being good to other people.

It's always good when a place lives up to the yelp reviews hype. This is one of them. My bf always raves about this place every time we're in the city but we never want to stand in line. We finally came here and barely beat the line and now I can see why this place is always so packed. We got the coffee toffee, salted caramel, and ricanelas (cinnamon). In order of my favorite it goes: coffee toffee, ricanelas, and then salted caramel. This is a little biased because I always put anything that has chocolate or coffee at the top of my list. Also, I saw a lot of bad things said about salted caramel. I'll admit that I wasn't fond of it at first but it grew on me. Plus, the name itself should serve as a warning that it's not gonna be the best thing you eat. I don't know what it is about this place. Maybe it's because it was such a nice day when we went, maybe because it's right next to a park, but the ambiance of this area makes for eating icecream outside one of the most relaxing things I've done in the city. I'll be back to try all the other flavors.

Review #517 for the establishment. Yeah, just another voice in the line wrapping around the corner! It was a nice day out. Convinced two who did not feel like moving after a large meal to walk the 4.5 blocks from 18th and Sanchez. That salted caramel is crazy good. Gimme more, gimme gimme more! Mint chip is excellent too. Absolutely love the Halloween outfits the folks behind the counter sport as they serve you some very yummy ice cream. Soft-foods/brace-faced friendly. I had the single scoop [1-2 flavors] in a cup, rather than the cone since the cone's a bit too crunchy for the teeth at the moment. Oh, but when these braces come out, I am ALL OVER those cones - they won't know what hit 'em. Buy 10 ice cream products, get a single scoop for free! Get the punch card.

Unimaginably creative & delicious flavors! I adored the Honey Lavendar + Pineapple Banana Sorbet. Sampled the following (thru a friend & samples): - Balsamic Strawberry (very intriguing) - liked - Coconut Chocolate - yummy - Cinnamon with SnickerDoodle - delicious - Coffee Toffee - very good - Salted Caramel - odd (possibly a bit too salty for me, but I'm not a big "salty' fan; I'm going to try again on my next visit) All in all, I must admit I prefer Bi-Rite Creamery to Mitchell's (sorry ice cream gods) ;)

mmm, just writing this yelp-review makes me want a BiRite cone right now. BiRite can easily take come classic flavors like, chocolate chip, vanilla, chocolate, mint chip, cookies and cream and make them infinitely better. But what makes this place stand out from your typical cold-stone or half gallon from Safeway is the fresh ingredients that they use and the ice cream is so creamy it reminds me of gelato. The coffee toffee is my favorite! You can see they use real coffee beans with chunks of toffee sprinkled throughout. Flavors to try: Malted Vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate! Ginger, salted caramel! Ricanelas is okay. It just taste like cinnamon ice cream Honey Lavender: is great for the first 3 licks, but like all lavender ice cream, you can't really taste the lavender towards the end.

I tried the honey lavender, salted caramel, and the balsamic strawberry. All of them were excellent, but my pick is the salted caramel. I make my own ice cream at home and have tried making the strawberry and salted caramel. The flavor was similar but something but the richness of of Bi-Rite's ice cream can't be reproduced. Pro-tip: If there's a huge line and you're with friends, just grab a pint to go at the window down the street or at the Bi-Rite market.

Everyone hated me and I loved it. Everyone who saw me that is, because I was walking down the street with a bowlful of delicious, SCRUMTRULESCENT ice cream from Bi-Rite Creamery! I had to skip out on what I thought would be a nice walk to grab a light lunch, but was too busy to get away. Settled for Trader Joe's frozen something-or-other. ÊNOT HAPPY. I beat myself up at the gym for it, but secretly I was killing myself so I could be a big fat piggy face and have ice cream for dinner. WHY? Because it reached 90 degrees on a ridiculously gorgeous day in May in San Francisco and I was trapped in a concrete jail, yearning to make a 'lil vitamin D, and I got denied. I pitied myself to the point of self-indulgence and that's what I did. And it was all that I hoped for.... and then some. while waiting in line I was recognized by staff as a patron at another establishment I Yelped (she wasn't too pleased with it- that's the nature of honesty), but that didn't slow me down from thinking about which flavor combination I would get. The winners? Salted caramel and balsamic strawberry. I had no idea how these flavors would mingle on my tongue, much less my bowl, but it seems you can't really go wrong with any combo here. The salted caramel flavor was reminiscent of the caramelized sugar atop creme brulee rather than your typical and traditional concept of caramel, but this was caramelized sugar done right. I didn't get much in the sense of salted, but there most certainly wasn't any of the nasty burnt or tinny flavor of a poorly executed melted sugar crust. The taste was so interesting in the form of ice cream that in the words of my boyfriend, I had to keep the spoonfuls coming to my mouth like a conveyor belt lest "I lose the flavor! There will be a flavor deficiency in my mouth!" The balsamic strawberry was delicious too- a fairly good, strong fresh strawberry flavor that once in the mouth, was tamed and teased by a veil of balsamic vinegar. The flavor combination has always been a favorite- especially saba and strawberries, and to materialize it in an ice cream is pure genius. Contrary to another reviewer, I didn't think the ice creams were too light and airy. My ice cream stayed fairly solid from Noe Valley all the way to the first half of the Bay Bridge with minor meltage and that wouldn't have happened with a lighter consistency. What pleasantly surprised me was the fact that it didn't seem too sweet, and it was definitely rich and every bite was delicious. The line moved fast enough and the counter staff were friendly, even though they were stuck behind a counter with a bunch of hot fans trying to keep our ice cream cool. The shelves leading up to the counter were lined with artisan chocolate bars and housemade cookies, books on Tartine and cupcakery, and a cooler at the end held prepacked pints and cookie dough, although on a day like that, everyone's focus was on scoops. I felt a little guilty as I scraped the last morsel of my double scoop from it's biodegradeable bowl, but not too much!

I have to say I was pretty disappointed in Bi-Rite after my first experience. ÊI do want to say the staff was awesome. Ready to serve samples and answer questions all with a cheery smile on their face. 5 stars for the staff for sure. I'm an ice cream snob and hailing from the midwest I am picky about my dairy. I think Bi-Rite is one of those places you think is great if you haven't had insane amounts of ice cream like me. Or if you live close and its your only option. Why only 2 stars? Their famed version of Salted Carmel was the worst rendition of the flavor I have ever had. I actually could not finish it I thought it was that bad. It could have been a bad batch but I don't know. Throwing away ice cream is a bad sign. I could not get my ice cream on a cone. What? Well I could have but the staff told me I could only get one tiny small scoop because their ice cream won't hold up in a cone. Total BS. At least 2 scoops on a sugar cone is my typical order - to not be able to have this was just wrong. I also ordered a scoop of the Ricanelas and it had a very icy consistency. The flavors just seemed off again. Another disappointment. I sampled the Honey Lavender and it was like drinking my shampoo. There is a way to use flower essence in ice cream but it should not be so overpowering. I also tried the Coffee Toffee and it just didn't work for me. My favorite ice cream is Jeni's in Ohio. Until I find ice cream I love in the bay area I guess I'll keep ordering online. http://www.jenisicecreamÉ peace, love, and good booze ~ chase

Bi-Rite Creamery is right across the street from my damn house. My gut is going nowhere. First of all miss creamery woman, do not let us try everything. Oh man. I resisted with all of my might. Are you trying to kill me? And everything in this place is organic. She told us so. Like a dozen times. I swear she convinced us the counter was organic. Great. Now I feel better about stuffing my face with ice cream. I went with chocolate. Boring? Maybe. But like I said, I LIVE ACROSS THE STREET. I'll be back. I have to say, it was one of the best chocolate cones I've had in awhile. Man. Admittedly, it did seem a tad spendy, but it IS Bi-Rite. They don't skimp. And when we first approaced it, the place looked closed. Seems like they could use some better lighting. Although their selection won't be as big, I predict they'll give Mitchell's a little run for their money...

Omg.. this must be the best ice cream I ever had!!!! Even the melted toffee chocolate chips cookie was so good!! ÊTheir ice cream is nicely done, full of flavor, creamy, just the right amount on the mixture. Ê You can't even get sick of it after a pint of them. ÊB/c it's San Francisco, they let you taste the ice cream with real spoon (being green), which was pretty interesting. Honey Lavender - superb!!! I felt like I fall in love w/ it. Salted Carmel - a tab too sweet but it was still good Roasted Coconuts - yum yum yum... It's a little bit toward the expensive side consider how little ice cream they give you. ÊI had three flavor in a double cup bowl for $4.75. ÊHey but I would come back again and again just b/c it taste sooo good...

Even after hearing all of the hype, Bi-Rite still Z0MG-ified my taste buds. Ê Honestly, every scoop was a taste of heaven. ÊEach bite of lavender honey was like a mini trip through the fields of Provence. The Orange Cardamom evoked my fondest memories of homemade Kulfi... and the Vanilla, was -really- VANILLA. ÊThere was nothing plain about it. If you really want a kick in the taste buds, also try the salted caramel. EASY FIVE STARS!

Until recently, I hadn't been back since my first venture two years ago; it's still as good as I remember, and there's still a line outside the door. ÊThat says a lot. The honey lavender was my favorite on this trip. ÊIt's solidified that their homemade ice cream is solid, but I think their more typical offerings are what make you appreciate a place like Humphry Slocombe that has flavors "outside the box", so to speak...flavors that don't sound like they should be meld together, but somehow work.

There's already over 1600 reviews so I don't think mine will make a huge difference... If there is a place with a line around the corner for ice cream on a cold and windy day, then the ice cream must be good. Ê If there are over 1600+ reviews for an ice cream spot, then the ice cream must be good. Ê(You can't really have 1600 negative reviews and still be open can you?) That pretty much sums it up.

I think it's crazy what San Francisco-ians do for food (standing for hours, tolerating cold weather, dropping serious dough, eating in cramped spaces, and tolerating rude attitudes). ÊJust an observation. First, how the heck do people get to this place? ÊParking is non-existent in this area. ÊI had my friend park illegally while I ran into grab some ice cream. ÊOne star off because of that. When we arrived, it was very busy. ÊI tried the famous salted caramel and earl grey tea. ÊFriend got the honey lavender. ÊThe flavors are strong and leave a lasting impression. ÊThe salted caramel is to die for! ÊVery delicious and creamy. ÊEarl grey tea...ehh, not my cup of tea but it was true to it's flavor. ÊThe honey lavender reminded me too much of soap but my buddy enjoyed it. ÊI would come back for more.

On hot days you'll see the line from Bi-Rite reach the street corner of 16th & Dolores and beyond that. That may be the only terrible thing, not really worthy of losing a star in my opinion as we are judging the quality of the good stuff--yada dafdsakjf The best thing about this place is the ice cream tastes exactly how you imagine their quirky names to taste. Does that make sense? I probably sound like Willy Wonka, more specifically, when he was describing "the raspberries tasting like raspberries the snozzberries tasting like snozzberies" (I'll go on a tangent every so often). +The honey lavender tastes like a flower made of milk and honey, if that makes any sense but I guarantee you'll love it, unless you're a man with a taste for something less sweet. +The toasted coconut had shreds of toasted coconut in it and tasted like a real coconut cupcake on a cone +The salted caramel won't disappoint if you're a Twix, Reeses', Snickers kind of babe ;) The portions are so small and you feel like a fat ass for ordering 4 even though 4 scoops of their ice cream totals about one normal ice cream scoop by my standards. This doesn't really apply to the sundae, the sundaes were kind of big, satisfying. Works best if you have 2 flavors you love that go well together because you get a way bigger portion, toppings, choice flavored syrup and a symphony of sweet and salty, a rare achievement, period. lol Good luck finding parking Only go there for the ice cream! Their cookies tastes terrible =\

Bi-Rite needs another review like I need a hole in the head. But since I'm an attention whore, here goes my two cents... Honey Lavender -- Five stars for uniqueness, but the lavender flavor was too overwhelming. Mint Chip -- Nothing to write home about. The mint flavor was way too overpowering. It was like eating Wrigley's Double Mint Gum in ice cream form. Uh, or a sprig or two of fresh mint. Toasted Coconut -- Pretty damn yummy. Recommended. Mexican Chocolate -- My new favorite flavor. Chocolatey richness. Highly recommended. I won't gush too much about it 'cuz I want more for me. So all you hipsters standing in line, you better save some for me!

This place is... wait for it... wait for.. it... AWESOME!!! The Ninja was was enjoying the lovely weather in the City by the Bay. The sun was shining and a cool breeze carefully swept through the air as the Ninja looked upon the Golden Gate. Suddenly, a craving began to tickle the Ninja's taste buds... ice creeaaammmm.... In a strange way cold weather & ice cream make sense to the Ninja. But where!????! Where could this craving.. this urge.. this madness be remedied??? *Gasp!* The Ninja began to flashback to an episode of "The Best Thing I Ever Ate: Sugar Rush". Aida had spoke of this creamery called "Bi-Rite". With no time to waste the Ninja-mobile sped off in a thunderous chirp! After several loops around the block the Ninja located a parking spot and was ready for battle. A smile grew ear to ear once the Ninja's eyes gazed upon the creamery. .::Overall::. Salted Caramel - Ah-Mezzing!! - Salty & Sweet cannot go wrong here Toasted Coconut - Very Nice - Like biting into a super creamy macaroon Pumpkin - Excellent - the Ninj' kept looking for pie crust bc it was just like eating pumpkin pie Coffee Toffee- Excellent - So good the Ninj' has decided to have a scoop of this in the morning instead of a cup of joe Bonus - the staff is fantastically friendly ^_^ .::Recommendations??!!::.

I think San Francisco when I think of Bi-Rite. ÊThis place i think recently expanded within the last year, opening a seating area and a soft-serve window that also serves cupcakes. Ê Despite the long lines, service is always relatively quick. Ê Have unique flavors such as balsamic strawberry, honey-lavender and my all-time personal favorite - ricanelas (cinnamon/cream ice cream with freshly baked snickerdoodles). Ê Unfortunately, my boyfriend and I were not impressed with their sundaes. ÊSam's Sundae (chocolate ice cream, bergamot olive oil, sea-salt and homemade whipped cream) Êjust tasted "off." ÊI am a fan of sweet and savory but the consistency of the olive oil, saltiness of the sea-salt and chocolate ice-cream did not bode well with me. Afternoon snack (roasted banana ice cream, homemade graham cracker crumbs, whipped cream and caramel sauce) was slightly better than Sam's Sundae but the homemade graham crackers also seemed a little too salty.

Ice cream is worth the long lines and wait at Bi-Rite Creamery! Bi-Rite offers an eff-ton of unique flavors I've never seen anywhere else. Best part, the counter help is totally cool with you sampling many flavors... they even encouraged me to try different flavors I didn't ask! (Also, props for using metal spoons and reducing waste). Bi-Rite is quality over quantity. The serving sizes are normal. A single scoop really is a single scoop. A double is two. In my opinion, this is so much better than getting a huge portion of uninspired, blah ice cream. I sampled the honey lavender and ricenalas (cinnamon with snickerdoodle), and ordered pumpkin and malted vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate pieces. The honey lavender and ricenalas were true standouts. Really unique! If you're into herbal and natural flavors, get the honey lavender! The malted vanilla with PB brittle and chocolate wasn't as unique as other options, but reminded me of a gourmet version of Ben and Jerry's. The pumpkin was a good seasonal choice, but wasn't exemplary. The toppings at Bi-Rite are so unique- I had to try the homemade graham crackers! They weren't very sugary, which was nice. More of a toasted flavor with a nice crunch. Highly recommend it! So wait in line, because it's worth the unlimited samples and some of the best ice cream around!

Talk about overhyped and overrated. ÊWait I forgot another "over" description...overpriced. Ê I did not enjoy a single part of my experience here. ÊFirst of all, the pints are $8!!!

Came here on an early week day afternoon with no line! ÊAs a result, I didn't have to feel guilty tasting one sample after another. ÊI really love how they (and Humphry's, and I'm guessing all of SF) use metal spoons Êrather than disposable plastic ones when giving out samples. ÊThe woman who worked there was really nice and encouraged us to try as many as we liked. ÊIn the end, we ended up getting four scoops (I think it was $5.75 - pretty darn expensive for four small scoops of ice cream): -Strawberry Balsamic - This had a very mild balsamic taste to it. ÊI liked it but didn't love it. -Salted Caramel - Everyone raved about this one, so of course I got it. ÊI liked it, but again, I didn't love it. -Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces - I LOVED THIS ONE! ÊI am a huge fan of malt in general, and this one was exceptionally malt-y and the peanut brittle gave it a good crunch. Ê -Ricanelas (Cinnamon with Snickerdoodles) - Another good flavor the comes with actual pieces of snickerdoodle cookie! Ê Two thumbs up! ÊScoops in LA is still my favorite, though, but this is a very close second!

Is the unattainable really more desirable? If so, Bi-Rite is the unattainable to me. I'm rarely in the Mission district. And when I am, it's never a good time. I'm either: on my way to eat; too full for ice cream (i know it's unimaginable! but it happens); or heading in a different direction. When the opportunity does come, its always moments before the store closes. So once again, Marti mad-dashes her way over to make it before 11pm. 11:02pm. Darn! Luckily, there were a bunch of fatties...i mean...Bi-Rite lovers still inside eating their ice cream. It was a cold windy night. And the sight of a dozen people huddling in that tiny store enjoying their treat in those tiny bowls just planted a fat smile on my face. I always get a scoop of Salted Caramel. Then rotate flavors as my second scoop. This time I tried Malted Vanilla: chocolate bits and peanut brittle. Creamy ice cream with suprising bits and bursts of crunchiness and sweetness. Yummmmerz!! =)

We all know that ice cream makes everyone happy, but is it worth trying to find parking and waiting in line on a chilly evening for that happiness? If it's Bi-Rite in SF, that would be a resounding yes. This was probably one of the best ice cream cones I've had in a long, long time. This is one hole-in-a-wall where I definitely would not know about if it weren't for Yelp or friends. You see a line out the door, and with the red velvet ropes, you would think people were waiting to get inside some club. Happily, it's for ice cream, there are no annoying bouncers, and the line moves relatively fast. All the flavors look so good, and the distinct names probably have a lot to do with it. Balsamic strawberry, snickerdoodle, creme fraiche, the list goes on. There's even a honey lavendar, which seems too exotic for me. Sounds like it would taste like body lotion. But I wish I could get a scoop of everything else. I would gladly skip a few meals and go a strict Bi-Rite ice cream diet. I go with the popular salted caramel and roasted banana on a cone. There's incredible depth in the flavors, especially with this combination. I would describe it as making s'mores, but with bananas. The other usual superlatives follow -- smooth, rich, and creamy. It has that fresh, organic, homemade quality that you just can't duplicate. My only gripe is that I thought that the scoops were rather small. Or maybe I was just enjoying the ice cream too much to realize how fast I was eating it. My cone was gone within minutes. I'm already plotting my next visit to try the other flavors. Planning a trip around ice cream? It doesn't get any better than that.

The sixth stop on the 7x7 journey. The day was quickly becoming the evening and although I just had my Ike's Place sandwich with judicious bites of other sandwiches as well, when asked if I still wanted Bi-Rite's ice cream I enthusiastically replied, "YES!" The creamery is literally a stone's throw away from Dolores Park and so even though there was a line, we were in the store perusing the flavors in no time. Being a first timer, it was time to try some flavors and I absolutely love how they whip out the big silver spoons for tasting. After trying a myriad of flavors, we settled on Malted Vanilla (milk chocolate and peanut brittle) and Ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles) which I made the mistake of pronouncing it "Ree-CANE-las" when it should be "Ree-canelas." You can bet I felt a little stupid/ dumb and not even in the hyphy-type of stupid dumb you can get away with in the bay area. However, what wasn't dumb was the quality of ice cream you get here. It's creamy and delicious and you really get bits and pieces of brittle in the Malted Vanilla that makes for a sweet treat not to be missed. Also, the Ricanelas wasn't at all overpowering in flavor as it's cinnamony concoction would suggest. Together it was just incredible plain old-fashioned good creamy ice cream. How come a place with such cold weather gets such awesome ice cream? Not fair at all for an ice cream lover. Ê Ê p.s. Coffee Toffee isn't that bad either...but it has a strong coffee flavor while still retaining a lot of sweetness.

This is the place for ice cream! I would of never found this place till a friend told me about this place. Of course parking is always hard to find in SF. This is a small ice cream store w/ a huge line! You can tell it's really popular. I'm not a sweets person, but their ice cream is so good! Hello SALTED CARAMEL and CHOCOLATE MINT. I think they had a cookie and cream one also. Seriously, I was quite surprised because the ice cream is so creamy. Did I mention we had ice cream and night in the cold and it was still good. This place is packed til they close. Lines are constantly forming. I haven't been here in awhile. I must make a visit again for the salted caramel! It's kinda hard to find this place.

It's just so so good, you can't stop thinking about it. The salted caramel is tasty. Balsamic strawberry tastes amazing, like nothing you've ever had, and it's memorable. We went for the coffee toffee sundae with everything... delicious. What else is there to say? It's good ice cream... good enough to go out of your way for. There's pre-packed pints you can take home. They also sell cookies and brownies which I have yet to try. Not much area to sit. Just a counter with four stools and a couple of benches outside. Now that I think about it... Walking around dolores park + ice cream = working off some calories (less guilt?)

It was a bad day. I left work. I went to Dolores Park. I got drunk there, and I cried there, all by myself. Then I walked to Bi-Rite Creamery for the first time in my life and got a child sized cone of salted caramel ice cream. The second the full weight of the flavors hit my tongue I momentarily moaned. Soon that glorious cone was all I could think about, and as I sat there in the sunshine, licking what heaven must taste like, I knew this place had saved the day.

One of my favorite ice cream places. ÊI love supporting the local places, and they have some flavors that certain ice cream places couldn't even dream of creating. ÊI love how they make the ice cream on site, and use a organic egg and milk in it. ÊAdditionally, you don't need a chemistry degree to understand what they put in, usually it's eggs, cream, milk, sugar, butter and whatever ingredient to make each flavor. ÊAdditionally for those on special dietary restrictions they do offer some vegan friendly and lactose-free alternatives. Plenty of people have already said it, but just some of my personal favorites when I'm there is the Salty Carmel, Toasted Coconut and Brown Butter Pecan ice cream. ÊAnd while the menu rotates and you do not know for sure what they are going to have on any given day, when they have all three I usually get a double scoop of ice cream and take a pint home with me. ÊI usually keep away during those really hot lazy dog days of summer, but sometimes the craving and the enticing flavors are to much to resist and I end up finding myself happily standing in line. Ê One little gripe I have is with the frequent buyer card, where if I by a cheap item like a Popsicle or something Êa little more expensive like a prepacked ice cream pints, I get only one punch for it. ÊIt's nit picky I know, but still, I wish they did something to reward us who like to hoard and take a pint home with us with our 2 scoop sundae for immediate consumption. ÊStill if you never tried this spot, definitely give this spot a try, it's definitely worth the wait... but if you aren't feeling patient it's OK, you'll be one less person I have to wait behind while I wait my turn.

Bi-Rite! My Love! How have I not reviewed you yet? Hmmm, maybe because every time it occurs to me to review you, my sweet one, I think it is a much BETTER idea to actually visit you. Yes, that is why. All I need for the rest of my life is Salted Caramel ice cream.

I am MATAKAW. Êas in... hella voracious when it comes to eating! once I stepped into this place, I told my peeps that I will ask for a taste of EVERYTHING. Êbakit-why? Ê because I want to find out if they can live up to the hype.... and I am hecka cheap. The first thing I noticed was that they used actual metal spoons for tasting, which means this place is all about being green (metal spoons are washable; their spoons and cups are made of compostable products). ÊI asked the lady, who was very accommodating, if I can taste their most popular flavor: SALTED CARAMEL. Êohhh dayngg hella good! Ê alright... how about another flavor? Ê she gave me the COFFEE-TOFFEE. Êooooh mmmm... oohhh yeah..... Ê how about another flavor?.... she let me try the ORANGE CARDAMOM. wow. ÊI didn't think I'd like cardamom (I used to distill the oils of this crap in my organic chemistry lab) but it worked well with the orange! My taste buds were still craving for some of the SALTED CARAMEL, so I ordered a scoop of that and a scoop of the coffee-toffee (i love coffee and toffee). After I finished my ice cream, I felt the stretch receptors in my belly screaming at me to ESTAP DAT! Êwhy? coz i'm BUSOG na BUSOG. ÊAs in.... my TIYAN is going to ESSPLODE if i don't ESTAP. because I already got ENOFF. The hype. Ê"CANYUBILIBINIT?" I asked myself.... YES. ÊI BILIBINIT!

All I know about the historiography of Bi-Rite Creamery's reviews I learned in Jewish Studies. My Jewish Studies professor explained that historians of any event follow a very particular timeline. First, there are those affected by the event. ÊFor them, it was a defining moment, which informs the exceptionalism of both that generation and of that people; this is our generation, we post 5-star reviews and we loudly proclaim "WE HAVE ONLY NOW BEGUN TO EAT ICE CREAM, FOR WHAT WE THOUGHT WERE 'ICE CREAMS' IN THE PAST WERE IN FACT *LIES*" to all four corners of the globe. Second, historians representing the generation to come next (these reviewers are only now being born) will cast doubt upon our 5-star reviews, saying "oh, those Bay Areans in their affected little bubble of culinary sophistication, they chose so tiny a perch from which to leer down upon so large a world." Third, the children of our children will review Bi-Rite truthfully--and the historiography will become a full and rich-bodied thing. The time is not yet right for an objective and reasoned review of Bi-Rite's "ice cream," if this manna can stand to bear so pedestrian a moniker. ÊSo, I sigh, and I wax poetic over an ice cream--sorry--*the* *one* and *only* ice cream that I will ever go out of my way to eat. ÊEVER. The crme frache is my favorite. ÊBy far.

Could it be that in 3 short years Bi-Rite has overtaken 56-year-old Mitchell's as the ice cream to beat in SF? ÊIf so, they went about it pretty competently. Ê Step 1: Set up shop across the street from Dolores Beach, on a block already packed with foodies who are well-versed in phrases like "HTST vs UP" and "vegetarian rennet". Ê Step 2: Advertise that you're using Straus milk. Ê Step 3: Watch the lines form around the block. Ê Incidentally, I don't find any ice cream in the world to be worth a half-hour wait, that's why I came on my lunch break instead of a weekend. ÊThough I think this means you're less likely to find a special flavor. ÊBut really, everyone should just start with 1 scoop each of salted caramel and honey lavender. ÊBecause, all analysis aside, this stuff is bliss on a cone. So congrats, Bi-Rite. ÊAnd now every soda jerk from here to Sebastopol with an itchy scoop finger and a (mint chocolate) chip on their shoulder is gonna come gunning for *you*. ÊJust wait.

After Ê1/2 a day of loafing (thanks to hangovers and the Special Victims Unit marathon) C says, "So like.how do you feel about getting ice-cream; I know this spot that makes the best flavors, EVAR." My response: "Uh...yeah! Where's my wallet?" So we roll up on 18th Street, and I see a line that almost extends around the corner.but it's no biggie, considering that I come from the land of 1.5 hour waits for subways and Shake Shack (om nom nom!) Fifteen minutes later, we're at the front of the line in a small dessert shop with no indoor seating; just a freezer for pre-packed quarts, a ledge for freshly baked goods, and a highly accommodating staff at the register who let me taste the Êbefore settling on a trio of Salted Caramel, Honey Lavender, and Balsamic Strawberry. And Oh Em Effin' Gee - I'm in love. Now truth be told, the Balsamic Strawberry wasn't anything special; the tangy and sour savoriness from balsamic vinegar that I love (and occasionally use as an ice-cream topping, akin to fudge) just didn't shine through the dense creaminess of the ice-cream.leaving me underwhelmed. The Honey Lavender, on the other hand, blew me away; somehow, Bi-Rite managed to capture the slightly soapy, herbal astringent-ness(?) of lavender! With every spoonful, it was like being cradled in the arms of a Provencal herb garden.or at the very least; eating sweetened high-quality triple-milled soap. Mama approves. And as for the salted caramel - WOW! Just wow. I would probably never want to eat this flavor on it's own, because it's almost *too* rich. But when completing the ice-cream trifecta, the salted caramel perfectly compliments the slightly boring strawberry and the somewhat soapy lavender. If you're a Ben-N-Jerry's aficionado, this is not the ice-cream for you; Bi-Rite's flavors are much too subtle and delicate for your harsh palate. But for the rest of us who crave creamy complimentary confectionary perfection - there's Bi-Rite.

YAY! i finally got to try the infamous Bi-Rite Creamery! ÊI sampled their famous flavors: Salty Caramel and Honey Lavender Salted Caramel: EEK! way way WAYYY to sweet. Êi didn't enjoy it at all Honey Lavender: i also wasn't a fan of this one either..it tasted really herby The flavors i did like: Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Chocolate: YUM! Êu can really tell it was homemade. Êthe vanilla taste was strong and the peanut brittle was crunchy and had just the right amount of sweetness Roasted Banana: i usually hate banana flavored items..the only banana things i like are the actual fruit. ÊHowever, this ice cream tasted like there were actual bananas mashed into the ice cream. Êvery scrumptious indeed! Ricanelas: This was also another fav flavor of mine. ÊThis consisted of snickerdoodles and cinnamon ice cream...sounds a bit strange, but tasted like nothing i've ever had in my life. Êif you're a fan of cinnamon this is a def. must for you! The prices were a little high..a single scoop (where you can choose up to two flavors) was 3.25 and we also bought a pint of ice cream which was 7.99

The ice cream here is pretty good, and the workers are really good about letting you sample flavors. ÊThe best part about the Bi-Rite Creamery experience, however, is the sugar cones. ÊI'm normally a waffle-cone person myself, but these sugar cones are amazing. Going here is nowhere near the experience of visiting Polly Ann's or Mitchell's, so you'll be disappointed if you expect anything but good ice cream.

ÊJustifying the extra calories with "Well if we walk off our lunch..." we made a hasty exit and headed towards our ice cream nirvana.

Friends took me to this charming creamery near Dolores Park. I sampled their mint chip flavor and fell in love all over again. (I LOVE mint chip in practically any form, so getting me to buy a cup of the ice cream wasn't a hard sell.) Their version was excellent: cool, smooth, with chips that weren't too huge, and melted in your mouth. On top of that, they actually took my credit card for the small purchase ($3). There's seating indoors, but most folks took their snacks outside to enjoy the (then) lukewarm San Francisco weather. We hopped across the street to the park to eat. Next time I'm in the neighborhood, I'm stopping by.

Yes, it's that good. My serotonin levels shot through the roof, and my six-month-long depression was gone in seconds. Am I exaggerating? Why don't you try a scoop of Honey Lavender, a scoop of Balsamic Strawberry, and a scoop of that vanilla flavor with peanut brittle before you mock my adulation.

Today was one of those rare super warm San Francisco days - perfect for ice cream, even though we stuffed ourselves with brunch. It actually worked out to our advantage - made the wait more pleasant basking in the summer sun, deciding which of the *18* mouth-watering flavors to try. ÊWould be great if they had a 'Bi-Rite sampler' on the menu - lil' melon ball scoops of heaven. Ê I ended up choosing the Coffee Toffee and the Brown Butter Pecan, both were delicious - but the Brown Butter was palate blowing! ÊI'd go back for an extra large scoop of that next time (which hopefully will be soon). I also purchased a pack of chocolate chip cookies - they are scrumptious - soft, fresh, and milk-chocolaty.

Ten stars for Bi-Rite! Yesterday I had the "Sam's Sundae." One scoop of chocolate, one scoop of honey lavender, and drizzled with olive oil and sea salt, with (almost unsweetened) whipped cream. $5.50. The olive oil does something extraordinary. The crunchy sea salt ... o m f g. Is it wrong to love something inanimate so much?? You have to have one at least once before you die. I intend to have at least 100 of these before I die.

That Almond Joy Sundae sure was good; looking and tasting (though forgot to take a pic in the haste to eat); toasted coconut ice cream; toasted almond; hot fudge. The creme fraiche too, though may be too creamy (sour cream/yogurty aftertaste) for some. I'd get both items again, yep. Long line on Sunday afternoon, down the street and around the block. Will return if in the area, hoping not with a long line, but that's just wishful thinking. Only a couple of blocks over from 16th St BART station, at the corner of the Dolores Park Tennis Courts that looks up on the park. Eat up there or one of the small benches right outside the store.

After a few visits to this wildly popular creamery I finally got here early enough before they ran out of the highly praised salted caramel flavor which had eluded me on every visit prior to this one. ÊStill, while waiting in line I was a bit anxious and nervous that by the time I got to the front of the line they would have, of course, run out. I ordered a small cup with a scoop of salted caramel and recanelas (cinnamon ice cream w/ snickerdoodle pieces) and the two delicious flavors complemented each other quite well.

Perhaps I was expecting too much, but was simply underwhelmed by Bi-Rite Creamery. I tried the salted caramel. I was so sure I'd love it based on all of the rave reviews that I didn't even have a sample, just went for it. I am an ice cream afficionado. I usually finish my cup (yes, I'm an ice cream purist: a cup girl, not a cone girl) wanting more and more. However, I didn't even finish this ice cream. It was rich but not that satisfying, and a bit too buttery for my tastes. I'm definitely willing to try more flavors (twist my arm...) but admit that I was a bit disappointed. I had a taste of my boyfriend's cinnamon which was pretty dern tasty, but overall... I was left wanting more. I admit that part of it may be my own palate, but I've consistently enjoyed Mitchell's and Naia more.

Oh Bi-Rite. Your prices continue to shock and dismay... following in the steps of their namesake store, the cost of a pint of sweet delicious goodness from the creamery is a whopping $8 bucks. But you just cannot put a price on the taste of their salted caramel ice cream. To know that I live a mere 2 blocks from this place is a very dangerous thing.

Sure, it's pricier than the guy in the park with the freezer cart, but absolutely delicious - without that super-rich goobucket gutbomb feeling of the Ben & Jerry's/Coldstone tradition. The sundaes look great (haven't tried one yet) and the ice cream cookie sandwiches taste like they should cost $40 a pop on a street corner in the Tenderloin. Plus, they've got lots of soy options for my lactarded wife so she doesn't get jealous of whatever I order.

Some things are just perfect in two different planes of existence. Myself being in one (I didn't stuh-stutter..I said perfection) and BiRite, supposedly, in the other. But like Romeo and Juliet...Tiger Woods and fidelity...me and your Mom (tell her Lijah says Hiiiii!)..some things just ain't made to be. I had a feeling GOD was trynna nudge me with that plain truth a few nights ago when me and the homie dropped in to BiRiC to be decreamed (get it?? like deflowered but decr-..dangit! moving on...) Parking. We did a few laps and finally found a snug lil spot across the way. Now I coulda maneuver'd my own vehicle in there but SOMEBODY wanted to show off, and Lijh loves making the children smile..SO like the true genetleman he is, he let her have a go at parallel parking. Luckily I was there for guidance ;) We walk in, and there was a small line (bueno!) and get our turn. After some taste testing (not by me), some glaring (not by me) and some arguing (not by- okay, that was me), I got a double scoop with 2 different flavors: Earl Grey - Some things should just stay in a cup. lol. Earl Grey has always been my tea of choice and it mos'def had the taste, it was just kinda weird having it all cold like that. Threw me off indeed. Ricanelas - hmmm..horchata (or orxata)? No bueno. It tasted hella cinnamony and Im not a heavy fan of cinnamon (I'm just heavy...and also brown and sweet [grins]) so this didn't really go my way. The texture was good though and overall the flavor wasn't all that BAD, I just didn't find it all that GOOD. Now why the 3 stars? Bad scoopamentals. I got a cone, with 2 scoops stting precariously on top. Why wasn't it pushed down to so it could be secured in the waffle awesomeness that was my cone? So after a few tastes, and a slight bump from the lady in front of me and *thwap*. The floor is now enjoying my scoops. Homeboy who worked there was maddd nice however and told them to get me another 2 sccops while he took care of the mess (Sorry homie!). So now I'm back at the vehicle, new cone, new scoops, new chance, and I'm talking to the homegirl and I go to lick [ hehe] the cone and *thwap*. YUP! Guerrero st is now enjoying my scoops.

OK, after mentioned Bi-Rite Creamery within my Bakesale Betty review, it was time to make the trip to SF and try it out. Ê Actually, I was already at Fort Baker in Marin at 7:30 AM to cheer Gayle on during her Susan G. Komen Walk for the Cure. ÊSo after I saw Gayle (and who was pleasantly surprised to see me), I headed into the City. ÊThat added up to $9 in Fast Trak tolls over the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge and the GG Bridge. Of course I puttered around first. ÊI took my own sweet time on Union Street and the Marina and then Japan Town and the Fillmore before walking to the Bi-Rite from where my car was parked in the Castro. ÊThe day was hot and the fog had not yet saved the day. ÊThere was also a Block 18 party going on. For all the exemplary Yelp press, I was surprised how small and unassuming this place was. ÊAnd there was no line! ÊAnd contrary to Lisa N.'s experience, I found the the staff service to be very sincere and friendly. I ordered a combination of chocolate and the banana ice cream. ÊThe chocolate was excellent and the banana was good, but not especially noteworthy. ÊBut, it did take the edge off that Indian roll I had at Kasa for lunch! And I'll need to come back to try all those other cool sandwiches and maybe even take a pint home to eat after my Bakesale Betty's chicken sandwich. Life IS good.....

Bi Rite makes my favorite ice cream, thank god it's a thirty-minute BART ride away from me or I might not be able to fit into a BART seat anymore... They offer spot-on flavor combinations and of course the much vaunted salted caramel. The ice cream is the creamiest and smoothest I've had, no doubt due to a ridiculously high fat content. Other items available for purchase include cookies, assorted baked goods, pints of ice cream, and ice cream accompaniments (sauces, toppings, etc.) Though there's always a line, the employees seem to really know how to handle customers and move them through quickly while still providing them with samples.

1 star for hitting the "all natural" buzz word. 1 star for hitting the "home made" buzz word. That's all. ÊThe net result is I should have just gone to Mitchell's like my wife was saying to do. ------------------------------- Chalk. ÊThat's what it taste's like near the end of the bite, and after. ÊMitchell's tastes creamy and yummy, during, and long after the bite (or lick). ÊThis doesn't happen with the Strawberry, so perhaps their method is best left to the fruit flavors. ÊAnd perhaps Mitchell's uses some naughty bits. ÊGiven that I'm eating ice cream either way, I'll take the naughty bits and have something I can enjoy, thank you very much. I can't help but think the big draw here is the "fancy" flavors (yawn... enough already with the honey fig and the jasmine cow nut... just make something that tastes good!). ÊExample, the Mexican chocolate Ice cream with salty peanut. ÊThis is no chocolate and peanut butter combo... it's clearly done to sound fancy, because the peanut over powers what little Mexican chocolate taste there is. ÊThe end result is it tastes like salty peanut with a bit of chocolate... that ultimately ends up tasting like chalk. ÊI absolutely love Mexican chocolate, yet Bi-Rite found a way for me to want to dump it in the trash... that's no easy task. ÊThe other combo flavors I had also sucked and I'll just leave it at that.

My Black Friday has been pretty laid back so far because I've ruled out shopping and dealing with the crowds in favor of staying in, and with all the leftovers from last night's food fest and On Demand on tv, I'm all set. And a great way to start the day is to have some ice cream. Luckily I found parking across the street and sampled a couple flavors (creme fraiche and toffee coffee) before I settled on a kid's cup (it's the PERFECT size) of their famous salted caramel. It's brilliant. Tastes like salty caramel popcorn (but minus the popcorn). Creamy, buttery-salty and caramelly...aww yeah!

#35 on the 2011 7x7 List: Salted Caramel ice cream #35 on the 2009 7x7 List: Salted Caramel ice cream -Tasty? Possibly the best and most memorable thing on the list so far -Service: ÊIt's simple: They ask you what flavor and what vessel that will hold your ice cream (cup or cone) and then you hand over the money to get the ice cream. ÊIt's that easy -Ambiance: It's a very small ice cream shop with two seats at the counter. ÊThere are several planters outside the store that you can sit on -Worth the trip/try? ÊDefinitely. ÊThere are also a few things on the list in the area, so if you plan well, you can hit a few all in one trip The Salted Caramel ice cream is best eaten with a cone. ÊFor a little under $4, the amount of ice cream you get is meager compared to other ice cream places, but the smile and sheer happiness you can derive from the delicious ice cream is worth ever penny. ÊI recommend going a little after lunch for dessert - there was no one there when we arrived. ÊIf you wait till the afternoon or after dinner, you can expect to wait a while

Delicious! Went here after dinner on Saturday. There was a line but it moved fast! Before I knew it we were inside ordering all sorts of flavors of ice cream. I got the balsamic strawberry and creme fraiche which I thought was very yummy. My friends were equally happy with their choices of salted caramel and toasted coconut. It was a perfect dessert! I will definitely suggest this place anytime anyone says they are in the mood for ice cream! Warning there are things to buy to take with you that all look amazing! Now, go get some ice cream!

Ok I'm kind of an ice cream fanatic so I think I know what I'm talking about here. Anyone who uses Strauss family products gets a big thumbs up. Two flavors here are kickin -- Salted Caramel (INSANE) and the roasted banana. I dunno why but for some reason I always have to eat banana ice cream wherever I go. ÊMint chip and coffee are also awesome. Go get yourself some of the best ice cream in the city and kick it at Dolores Park with some friends.

By golly, I feel like I've been ice cream binging this past week. ÊFirst, Mashti Malone's, then Scoops, and now Bi-Rite? ÊDon't judge me. ÊIt was all so worth it. The line out the door seemed long at first, but it moved relatively quickly. ÊThough there were people waiting behind me, the worker was more than willing to let me sample a few flavors. ÊNot wanting to hold up the line, I tried my best to not try every single flavor. So I ended up getting to try Salted Caramel, Creme Fraiche, Roasted Banana, Mint Chip, Honey Lavender, Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl, Butter Pecan, and a Sundae with Hot Fudge and a Chocolate Chip Cookie. Everything was delicious. ÊThe Salted Caramel was like a cold, melting piece of Morinaga caramel candy in my mouth. ÊThe Creme Fraiche had an amazing, layered flavor, with a subtle, sour aftertaste. ÊThe Mint Chip tasted like what I imagine a delicious batch of Tiger Balm medicinal balm would taste like (I've always wondered what it would taste like). ÊThe Roasted Banana tasted just like what its name suggests, with a nice, s'more-like burnt aftertaste. ÊThe Honey Lavendar tasted like a lavender soap bar from The Body Shop would (not that I've tried it or anything) mixed in with a twist of sweetness. ÊThe Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl was a marriage of three amazing flavors that ended up capturing all my taste buds in a huge sweet and savory net. ÊAnd finally, the Butter Pecan did not stray too far away from its classic flavor, which is not a bad thing. The sundae was like any other sundae, just with better ice cream, and more interesting flavors. ÊIt's always a fun idea to swirl together a bunch of different flavors, as you would a dish that you're cooking at home. More than anything, i would recommend a bowl with the Salted Caramel and the Creme Fraiche, as their flavors mix together well (salty, sweet, and sour) in a not so strange way. In terms of service, flavor selection, and taste, Bi-Rite does it right. GET: ÊSalted Caramel, Creme Fraiche, Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl

Bi-Rite is simply amazing. Read the reviews, most people have nothing but good things to say. I just moved back to the city recently and am therefore a Bi-Rite virgin. After 3 years in Boston enjoying delicious J.P. Lick's ice cream I was afraid I wouldn't find a new ice creamery to fill the hole in my heart. Alas, that worry has be squashed. As we walked up to this little hole in the wall there was a line outside. This did not surprise me given the sheer number of reviews on Yelp. However, the people working were quick and the line moved swiftly. We tried the malted vanilla, toasted banana, honey lavender and Ricanela (snicker doodle). All were great. I'm a banana fan and so it was right up my alley. The snicker doodle had a great not-to-sweet cinnamon taste and the malted vanilla was creamy with a clear malt taste. My only suggestion would be to have a stronger lavender flavor b/c it was too light to be tasted when eaten with other flavors. Not a big deal, it was still tasty. Do yourself a favor and try it out. Don't bother with Ben and Jerry's or Dreyers - support your local ice creamery.

I am never disappointed with this place. I normally get the Salted Caramel and the Honey Lavender ice cream. This time I tried the Earl Grey tea ice cream and it is hands down, the BEST. You need to try. Best thing to do is go in the store and get the pints. No lines. No waiting. Stock up on Bi-Rite in your freezer and you'll always be happy. That's what I did.

So I have this weird affinity for combining the salty and the sweet. Maybe it's not so weird. But it's hard to name a more gluttonous combination. And in the thesaurus shelved in my brain, gluttonous is a synonym for delicious. The salted caramel flavored ice cream is as gluttonous and delicious as it gets when it comes to ice cream flavors. The caramel flavor is potent with a sweet and almost buttery taste. And the salted portion tastes of well salt. But please do not let my elementary use of adjectives dissuade you from trying the salted caramel. It is, dare I say, transcendental? It is unlike any flavor of ice cream I have ever tried. Describing this flavor is like trying to describe one of those "you just had to be there" moments. You just have to try it to grasp the full magnitude of this flavor. Another Bi-Rite favorite of mine is Sam's Sundae. I can't think of a more unique sundae combination. Chocolate ice cream, olive oil and salt?! What in the world?! Notice the recurring salty and sweet theme in my ice cream choices. I justify eating this delicious sundae by telling myself that olive oil has omega-3s, so it can't possibly be that bad for me. It's not like I'm eating lead, right?! Right...? I've spent the last 200 words or so raving about Bi-Rite. So why only 4 stars instead of a perfect 5? The negative 1 star is for the Honey Lavender flavor, which is neither salty nor sweet. It tastes more like the cheap soap that my mom used to wash out my mouth with for saying naughty words such as Phuket or "flower bridge" in Cantonese. Sorry Bi-Rite, but I am not a fan of this flavor.

Anytime there is a line out the door wrapped around the corner, you know that whatever is in that building has got to be good. Thats Bi-Rite Creamery... This is what I ordered: Toasted banana Snickerdoodle Cookies n' Creme Honey Lavender -The toasted banana tastes exactly like you are biting into a ripe banana, really good if you're a nanner fan. -Snickerdoodle was out of this world! It has hunks of freshly baked snickerdoodle cookies throughout. This was by far my favorite!!! gimme a quart of that stuff. -Cookies n'creme was just okay, nothing too special. -Honey Lavender was very simple. Lovely on the palate and wasn't as floral as I thought it would be. It has a "pretty" taste, if that makes sense to anyone? LOVED BI-RITE CREAMERY! If ever in SF, stop by! No disappointments there!

Bi-Rite Creamery's salted caramel ice cream is #35 on the 2010 Big Eat SF List. (http://www.7x7.com/eat-dÉ) It puts all other salted caramels to shame. To be honest, I'd overdosed on the salted caramel trend lately. Wouldn't even have tasted it if it wasn't listed on the Big Eat SF list. This salted caramel was a smoky, dark burnt-caramel taste with the faintest sway of salt underneath. Other yelpers have commented on the competition from Molly Moons. Not even a comparison. As bubble gum ice cream is to french vanilla, Molly's salted caramel is to Bi-Rite's. Perfect follow-up to some pizza from Delfina's, just down the block.

I was in San Francisco for a week and during this time I tried to sample all of the offerings on hand at Bi-Rite Creamery --- I know, I am so giving to you people. Here is my report: Salted Caramel --- ÊI really can't speak about it, it's too good, it's so rich, it's so the perfect ice cream that I can't even finish a whole cone, dang, yeah. Caramel and Pralines --- Even more perfect. I can definitely finish a whole cone so no need to share --- haha! Coffee Toffee --- Oh sweet sweet nectar of the God's this is some strong coffee and the toffee chips are huge and you know what they say about big toffee chips...yup, good eatin'. Chocolate Chip Mint --- Tasted more like peppermint with chocolate...I for one don't consider that a bad thing, I'd get it again, for sure. Honey Lavender --- Where's the lavender? It just tasted like honey, which is tasty but not as complex as one might hope. Soy Chocolate --- I suppose if I were lactose intolerant this would be a nice treat, but thank the good ice cream heavens that I have working enzymes and don't have to eat this for dessert. Summary: Bi-Rite Creamery has good ice cream the way Jimmy Hendrix has good guitar playing abilities.

You know, it was good...but it didn't blow my mind. I thought it was SOOOO SWEET! I had the Coffee Toffee and the Mayan Chocolate. Both had good flavor, but like I said. SWEET. Major pluses: compostable cups, friendly servers, and they take credit cards even for a $3 purchase. And a small was $3.25 and I thought it was a pretty good size serving. Also I know they use all organic milk and cream which is pretty awesome. Minuses: Overwhelming sweetness. It just didn't rock my panties off. Overall I enjoyed my experience, but I definitely wouldn't stand in the normally gigantic line for it. Honestly, when it comes to ice cream in SF, I'd rather go to Mitchells or grab some gelato.

As with my other reviews, this one is for the sake of Yelp profile completeness, because as you can see, this place really doesn't need anymore reviews. ÊAnd if 3000+ reviews can't convince you to come here then my review probably won't either..! ÊAnyway... I'm rounding up, because I think I would say 4.5 stars, but I think that's only because the standard in my mind is Scoops in LA, and I have yet to find a place that measures up with the flavors / taste AND the price. That being said, I think Bi Rite does an awesome job with flavor. ÊTasted salted caramel and honey lavendar (YUMMM) and ended up getting pumpkin (I get pumpkin cravings) and the snicker doodle. ÊEverything tasted exactly as it sounds, and was super YUMMY!! Ê So the only negative thing is.... it's not $2 for two scoops (like it is in LA..!) and the flavors don't change up as regularly as they do at Scoops. BUT that being said, the ice cream here is very yummy and I would come back the next time I'm in SF!

The selection of ice cream here is amazingly delicious. Located on the corner of Dolores and 18th Street, it's THE place to go for something fruity, creamy and delicious before you head across the street to Dolores Park to enjoy the throngs of San Franciscans. I've become a scoop-hound here, and will occasionally splurge on one of their amazing sundaes, and on a warm day (rare for SF) their popsicles can seem heaven-sent. So run, don't walk whenever you're in the neighborhood, or take MUNI over for something yummy. MA

An almost four thousand reviews and an average 4.5 star rating predisposed me to high expectations. Surprisingly, unlike other over-hyped establishments, Bi-Rite Creamery lives up to it's reputation! I am not sure if this is a daily thing, but when I came here on Friday evening, the line wrapped about the building. With good company, the wait was bearable. By the time I reached the front, I had already decided on what to order. I got myself two flavors: their famous salted-caramel (of course) and balsamic strawberry (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É). My friend also got two flavors: malted vanilla and toasted coconut. The salted-caramel was very unique! I am usually a fan of caramel and the slight hint of salt made for an interesting aftertaste. It reminded me of See's Candies caramel lollipops. The balsamic flavor in the balsamic strawberry wasn't as strong as I liked, but it was good. I also got to taste the toasted coconut and malted vanilla. My favorite out of all the flavors would have to be the malted vanilla! It contained just the right amount of peanut brittle that added a very nice crunch to the silky ice cream. The toasted coconut was good too, but I didn't think there was enough coconut pieces. I really like Bi-Rite Creamery because their ice cream is made fresh and they create very unique and organic flavors. They also make their very own ice cream cakes. Their staff is also very well trained and the prices are fair. I know you can't resist, so go check them out! Remember though, it's a teeny-tiny place, so don't plan on eating there!

Mexican chocolate is my favorite so far. ÊI love the kick of cinnamon in Mexican hot chocolate and Bi-Rite puts in just enough. ÊSome of the other flavors I find lose this subtlety. ÊThe honey lavender was just too much lavender for me. ÊI like the scent in my laundry but how did this flower become such a frequent flyer into my food? ÊThe ice cream is reminiscent of licking the bathroom floor, albeit a clean floor, but still a floor. ÊDon't even try to throw that "how do you Êknow what a bathroom floor tastes like" question. ÊIt's a long story. ÊI'm kidding. ÊSo I digress... All other lavender scented food products I've tasted (cookies, crme brulee, other ice creams) have that toilet quality. ÊSo it's not exactly a bad ice cream, just not my preference. ÊThe salted caramel on the other hand, I did think was bad. ÊThat ice cream so numbed my taste buds that after a few bites I had no idea what I was eating. ÊWhen I switched over to roasted banana I couldn't taste a thing. ÊThe only way I knew there was ice cream in my mouth was because it was cold. ÊTo me, that is the sign of a bad ice cream. Bi-Rite is good and their flavors are fun but not as good as everyone makes them out to be. ÊSo far Swensen's is winning my heart.

Okay, seriously. Ê1600 people who rated a place and overall it's 4 1/2 stars ... you probably cannot go wrong with Bi-Rite unless: 1) you hate ice cream 2) you hate sweets 3) you have no soul The first time I tried Bi-Rite I was blown away by their flavors, and my favorite (given that I have sweet teeth, not just one tooth) was the salted caramel. ÊI highly caution those of you who aren't as big of a fan of sweet stuff. ÊOther great flavors are Strawberry Balsamic and Honey Lavender (much lighter). Ê The ice cream is just home made, creamy, and made with love. Ê The one star? Okay, well, I was watching a Food Network episode and this chef was gushing about the sam's sundae. Ê"Get it," she urged through the TV, "the melodious flavors of the bergamot olive oil and chocolate ice cream are amazing, and the sea salt makes it even SWEETER! ÊIt can't be beat." ÊWell, uh, it's....just kind of odd. ÊAlthough I could try to appreciate it, it just wasn't up my alley. ÊThere was too much salt in quite a few bitefuls, and also the olive oil solidified and didn't make me too ga-ga like I was told I would be. ÊPlus, quite a few friends made "oh thats...interesting" faces when I made them try it. Stick to the other choices. ÊYou won't regret it.

My two favorites are the Ricanela icecream with snickerdoodle cookie dough and balsamic strawberry. This place really does live up to the hype!!!! All the flavors Êwere handwritten.

Our motorcycle ride ended right in front of Bi Rite Creamery and I knew we had to stop in when I saw the Bi Rite Creamery chalkboard with all their yummies listed. I had the salted caramel with house made fudge and he had the banana with house made fudge. The salted caramel had a wonderful rich caramel flavoring with just the right amount of salt. The house made fudge was thick and flavorful. The banana tasted like slightly overripe bananas, just how I like them. We took our ice creams to Dolores Park and had a nice little walk around the park. I even got a kiss under the mistletoe. I highly recommend Bi Rite Creamery, and kisses under mistletoe.

The line was pretty long this past Saturday but I didn't care, I finally made it to the counter and I took my time tasting about 10 flavors.

The pints sure didn't last long and it looks like I'll be back in the City this weekend for more. Note to Self: BRING LARGER COOLER w/ ICE

Small world. ÊIts interesting writing reviews about places in other cities, and then seeing how many of your local friends have written about those places themselves; it really is a small world. ÊAlso, writing some of these SF reviews, I'm blown away by the reviewing capacity of the SF crowd, but SF is the home of yelp, so I guess its not a surpise. ÊStill it must be pretty hard to get a "first to review" here in this city I think. Anyhow, got Sam Sundae's, was alright. ÊChocolate, whipped cream, olive oil, maldron sea salt, when you mash and mix them all together, the sundae definitely gets better, and while I liked it, I don't see what makes it a "best things I ever ate".

Last week, I finally went into Bi-Rite Creamery. ÊI had really high hopes and expectations about this place. ÊYou know how this story is going to end . . . I did a double of 3 flavors. ÊI did my Yelp research on this place and everyone raved about 2 flavors. ÊYes, you know what they are: ÊSalted Caramel and Honey Lavender. ÊUnfortunately, I have to say I was heartbroken with these flavors. ÊI was confused with the taste of the Salted Caramel being toffee-like or almost butter pecan. ÊStrange but true. ÊThe Honey Lavender had too much lavender for my palate, which reminded me of air freshener. ÊI decide to finish them anyway to: 1) make sure my tastebuds were working, 2) refresh me on a warm day. ÊAfter all, it's still ice cream. The 3rd flavor was my lifesaver: Êbalsamic strawberry. ÊThis flavor was delicious!! ÊA fruity flavored ice cream without being too rich and having more substance than a sherbet. ÊBless this flavor! Bi-Rite Creamery, you have not seen the last of me! ÊWorth going back for the balsamic strawberry. ÊMy favorite flavors are still yet to be discovered.

I'm keeping my review short (like the amount of time my ice cream lasted) and sweet (like the flavors and memories that were conjured up after my first Bi-Rite experience). Ê 1. Salted Caramel: ÊNo brainer. There's a reason why everyone raves about it. Just read the next 1000 reviews after mine. 2. Coffee: pretty darn good. We got some because they were out of the strawberry balsamic and orange cardamom. ÊVery intense coffee flavor that beats anything at Starbucks, hot or cold. 3. Blood Orange: Tastes like you're eating fresh blood oranges - simultaneously sweet & tart and it looks like you're eating frozen blood - slurp! 4. Creme Fraiche: had a hint of citrus to it but it was nice and silky. The winner: ÊThe blood orange combined with the creme fraiche was like eating a very sophisticated orange cream-sickle! ÊBrought back memories of chasing down the ice cream truck as a child. ÊI've been to Italy and had some amazing gelato that I'll never forget & I'm sure there are many native Italians who have visited San Francisco who have been to Bi-Rite creamery who thought they were back in Rome.

Growing up Chinese-American has its privileges (everyone assumes you are good at math and were born with the ability to play the violin) and its disadvantages, mainly that you are not allowed to be frivolous at any time - even when, say, it is your seventh birthday and you want a sundae. Chinese families have an unspoken code when dining out - thou shalt not order drinks other than water/tea (if free) and thou shalt not get anything more than a single scoop of ice cream on a sugar cone. If you see an Asian person drinking a coke at a restaurant, chances are, they are not Chinese. So at 28-(ahem, please allow an old lady some dignity)- I had my first Sundae - a banana split at Bi-rite. Holy Crap! I can't believe I've allowed my parents to keep me away from a caramelized banana, two scoops of ice cream (three in my case brown sugar with ginger swirl, malted vanilla with toffee peanuts, and balsamic strawberry, cause that is how I roll), hot fudge which solidifies against the cold ice cream, whipped cream and walnuts. ÊI found the whipped cream to be superfluous. ÊJust give me the ice cream! So as of yesterday, I have cast off the emotional restraints that my parental units have imposed on me and realized my dream of eating a Sundae. My shrink would be proud.

I Scream, You Scream, We all Scream for Ice Cream! Okay, up until today, I thought Marianne's ice cream in Santa Cruz had to be my fave. Well, now I think there is enough room in my heart for two places. Opposite ends of the Bay at that! If I had a heart necklace, I would break one half off for Bi-Rite and the other half for Marianne's. One day hoping that the two would unite in creamy goodness. Line felt long but it actually went fast. A friend I was visiting in SF happens to live a few blocks away. I wasn't in the mood for dessert until she mentioned Bi-rite and my ears perked up. This place was on my radar and I thought, well, what would a little ice cream hurt, huh? (I like to convince myself that sweets are a primary food group). Staff were incredibly nice and fun too! I can't believe anyone could be thin after working there, but the people behind the counter were young, friendly and thin. Go figure! The ice cream was unique in that it reminded me of the consistency of gelato more than a traditional ice cream. I am not sure if that is why it felt like it melted fast, because it was a little chilly and windy outside, so there was no reason for it to melt quickly. It didn't deter me from drinking my serving though! hehe. The flavors more than anything were what won this ice cream a place in my heart. I really enjoyed the salted caramel, malted vanilla with peanut brittle and chocolate, and the roasted banana!

The scene: a small ice cream shop with a long line The flavors: let's see how many I can remember... malted vanilla, vanilla, coffee toffee, chocolate, mexican chocolate, pumpkin, salted caramel, cookies & cream, mint chip, honey lavender, toasted coconut, banana, snickerdoodle Other options: pints of ice cream, cookies, cookie sandwiches, Popsicles, etc. The price: $3.25 for a small with 1 or 2 flavors, 75 cents per topping, 75 cent cookies My selection: the coffee toffee and snickerdoodle (had a strange other name...) Thoughts: YUMMY!!!! Complaints: I hate little wooden spoons! Eating off of wood gives me chills!

ÊWeather was on point, peeps were here from Maui, money in the bank, etc. ÊAfter a heart clogging session eating Silogs in DC (what a shocker), I wanted to get some dessert in the city. ÊThankfully the other Oompa Loompas were on the same page. ÊI've been told to come here but have never had the opportunity till now and none of the other people in the car have ever been there.

ÊIf that doesn't tell you that you've 'arrived', then I don't know what does. Ê I got the salted caramel and honey lavender. ÊA little salty to go with the sweet. ÊWe got our cup of love and headed to Dolores park, where apparently everybody and their mama was there enjoying the crazyness that has become Global Warming. ÊCall me crazy, but all I wanted to do was hold a boom box over my head and play "One Love" by Bob.

Forget your fatty 31 Flavors! ÊBi-Rite offers some amazing original flavors that leaves you yearning for more! Which...is why I came back the day after (= ÊI LOVE LOVE coconut and for years have been a fan of pineapple coconut ice cream. ÊBut Bi-Rite offered me a new twist to try - Chocolate Coconut (it's considered vegan because rather than using milk, coconut milk is used, YUM!) ÊRich, aromatic, and creamy. ÊSo delicious, you have to control yourself by taking small portions just so that you can savor each scoop! There was a new flavor the second time I went to Bi-Rite. ÊIt's hidden in the lower right hand corner of the fridge. ÊI don't remember what it's called, but it has crushed Snikerdoodle cookies swirled into the ice cream. ÊThe sample was delicious! ÊWish I had traded my scoop of Salty Caramel for a scoop of that Snikerdoodle :D

I don't understand!!! Why is it so good?! Salted Caramel, Roasted Banana, Brown Sugar, and Malted Vanilla ... Oh my!! Oh god even their cookies are super delicious. I've been wanting to try their Earl Grey after hearing so much about it from others but they didn't have it today since they're selections change daily. I thought it was neat that they gave you a silver spoon for each sample of delicious ice cream goodness. Makes it feel more... authentic. To the right of the main shop, there's a mini window where you can order soft serve. But no matter where you decide to go be prepared to stand in a long line.

I waited in line for 45 minutes until they advised us Êthat they had no vanilla ice cream... I understand, it happens; however, the employees were giving some customers free pints... the customers before and after me were given free pints of the good stuff, and I was charged for a chocolate cone and not even given an apology? What? This place left such a bad taste in my mouth, and its not the ice cream... but the customer service is horrible. IMO, no ice cream is worth $8 a pint, 45 minutes in line and horrible service.

When the weather is nice (and remember San Franciscans have a different definition of nice weather than most), you can expect the line around BiRite to be wrapped around the block. ÊI don't know how the poor people who live around there stand it because last Friday night at 10pm the line was at least 20 people long and some of those people seemed slightly intoxicated and were being quite loud. I'm pretty sure that in each gallon of salted caramel ice cream, they put just a pinch of COCAINE. ÊNot enough to crack you out, just enough that you become insanely addicted to it and once in a while can't help yourself and curse life as your spoon hits the bottom of the empty pint. ÊIf I can't fit into my wedding dress, it will be solely the fault of BiRite.

What is it about cold blustery days that makes me want ice cream? Mmm...ice cream! Bi-Rite is DAMN GOOD ice cream. Seriously. You can just taste the quality of ingredients and the creamy texture is must for your tongue to experience. Mmm... Lots of fancy, unusual flavors and a small soy selection for our vegan friends. And yeah, I'm going to say it's better than Mitchell's. Mitchell's is good but Bi-Rite is gourmet! (Hence paying $2.95 for a single scoop.) I sampled the honey lavender but found it a bit too perfumey. So I had a single cone of salty caramel on a cone. A single scoop was just enough as the sweet flavor of this ice cream became overwhelming by the end and all I wanted was to eat the cone. If ice cream isn't your thing, they have a whole wall of candies and other confectionery goodies. You have to also commend this creamery for using organic ingredients and metal spoons for tasting instead of like other places that use disposable plastic spoons. Only in San Francisco. Way to be eco-conscience!

I finally forced myself not to have dessert at Ti Couz in order to give Bi-Rite a try and I admit, it was worth it. I had a single scoop of salted caramel and coffee toffee. And I agree with other Yelpers, this ice cream combination has to be the best in all the land. The crunchy toffee bits melded perfectly with both flavors and I will definitely be getting a double scoop next time. And boy howdy, there WILL be a next time. Update: All my out of town guests love Bi Rite! Though most recently my coffee toffee was too...coffee-y. Too many coffee grounds, I guess. But I have a new favorite combination....lavender honey and orange cardamom! Update 2: Today is my birthday and I have a new new favorite, ricanela cinnamon ice cream with homemade snickerdoodles! Update 3: *mouth full* Mmm, malted vanilla and peanut brittle! They also offer Kika's Treats cocoa nib shortbread as a topping now. Mmm... Update 4: Ick. Almond cherry was not good...

I'm a big supporter of homemade anything! And homemade ICE CREAM? Bring it onnnnnnnnnnnn! After a big dinner somewhere on Valencia/Mission Streets, do stop by Bi-Rite and get a scoop of their honey lavendar ice cream. Sounds weird but it's uber uber uber refreshing. It's light and honestly don't feel like you're eating heavy fatty ice cream. They have so many weird flavors from salted caramel to roasted bananas, but I'm compelled to believe that they are all really good. I'm definitely coming back to try more unique flavors.

When you come somewhere twice on a single weekend visit it must be special... That is Bi-Rite Creamery. A recommendation brought me here, and the amazing Salted Caramel brought me back for more the next day when we found ourselves in the area one more time. The Magnolia Coffee Porter, Vegan Coconut Chocolate (damn), and Vanilla Malt are off the chains. While it is a little overpriced, they are in line with typical homemade places. This one is organic though, which is nice. As an over-eater, the portions could definitely be larger: a scoop is actually a small little scoop. Nevertheless, people come here in droves and probably will continue to do so. The line may move faster if it weren't for the required "two sample rule." I appreciate how they use real spoons for said activity, saving millions of plastic spoons from a life in landfills...

Here's something many people don't know about me, a native Chicagoan: I suffer from cold urticaria. ÊThat means when I get too cold, I break out in hives. ÊIt's a crappy allergy, and it's also one of the main reasons why I moved to LA. ÊStill, I heard so many great things about Bi-Rite that I just HAD to stop by for a visit during a short weekend trip to San Francisco. ÊAnd of course, the day I decided to go, it was really cold and rainy out. ÊPerfect for ice cream, huh? Well, let me just say, hives and ensuing itchiness didn't deter me, and I'm so glad I came! ÊSalted caramel + honey lavender in a cup made me forget that I have one of the stupidest allergies in the world. ÊLove, love, love! ÊThe ice cream was really smooth in my mouth, and the caramel was almost *too* salty, but not quite. ÊNext time I'm in the area, I'm bringing my Benadryl so I can have my ice cream without the hives.

I love creative ice cream flavors, especially when they taste not only intriguing but divinely good. ÊAcross from one of my favorite restaurants in the city, Delfina, and an organic goods shop with the same namesake, Bi-Rite attracts patrons like bees to honey. ÊMy favorite is a tie between honey lavender and salted caramel. ÊFor honey lavender, just imagine that teasing scent of pure lavender, emitting a complex range of delicately clean, floral, herbal, and finishing with a honeyed sweetness. ÊSalted caramel is perfectly named, for it captures how mouth-puckeringly salty when juxtaposed to addictively sweet can create a mouthwatering harmony of opposites. My other favorites are flavors I have, for the most part, had at other high quality ice cream parlors: Êbalsamic strawberry (so refreshing and fresh-tasting, a seasonal item so live it up), roasted banana (like slightly nutty, toasted banana), coffee toffee (relatively unexciting, but the coffee is from Ritual and it really tastes like good coffee), chocolate soy (rich and creamy), lemon (lightly tangy), and chai spiced milk chocolate (like a great cup of chai). Service is fun and really friendly. ÊYou can tell they love working there. ÊThey are really cool about letting you sample. ÊI shamelessly ask and ask, and as they hand me the mini spoons, they just look at me with an ear-to-ear smile like they completely understand. Ê"We know, we know," they telepathically convey, "How can I not want to at least try orange cardamom, creme fraiche, and pluot sorbet?" ÊThank you for your patience and empathy, lucky staff (imagine the freebies) of one of the best ice cream shops in San Francisco, and with Delfina, Tartine, and Dolores Park within walking distance, definitely the best location.

So how did I not have ANY clue that Bi-Rite existed until last night at dinner?? ÊIt's true everyone I had no idea. Amazing seriously. ÊI like to think I am in the know about certain places, but apparently my skills in the ice cream area are a bit weak. ÊThankfully my foodie friends make up for my ignorance. Ê After a yummy catch up dinner with my friend Jen she looked at me and said hey let's go to Bi-Rite I haven't been and am dying to try it. ÊI was like what is that? ÊI soon found out. ÊSo Bi-Rite is homemade yummy unique ice cream you all must try some time very soon. Jen had warned me about the line and on a Monday cool SF night she wasn't joking. ÊWe waiting about 10-15 minutes which I guess is good because usually the wait is much longer. ÊThe flavors they have are all very unique and you feel like you want to try not just one, but like 3 or 4. ÊSo for $4.75 you get three scoops, three choices. ÊI would say you should try what they are famous for which is the Salted Carmel. ÊVery good if you like a salty sweet taste which I do. ÊI also had the Brown Butter Pecan....heavenly. ÊAnd rounded out my three with the Malted Vanilla which was very creamy and again very good. You can tell this place takes pride in their product and it's made very well. ÊThe price may seem steep but the quality makes up for it and it was a great after dinner snack for sure. ÊThanks Jen for exposing me to Bi-Rite I know I will be back again!!

I work out extra hard so I can buy the pints/tubs of the ice cream so i can eat it whenever I want.

I scream, you scream, we all scream, for BI-RITE!!!!! My friend being the major ice cream fanatic that she is, googled and yelped a list of ice cream places that she wanted to hit up while we were in SF. Since we were heading to Alamo Square to see the Painted Ladies (Full House houses), we decided to head on over to Bi-Rite to appease her ice cream craving (I would say satisfy, but she's never satisfied with the amount of ice cream she eats). Pulling up to the place, we saw the long line that went out of the store and wrapped around Dolores St. I don't know about you, but when I see lines like that, I feel safe in knowing how "too legit to quit" a place is. Sure it was a low 60 degrees out, but we had our coats on, and we waited patiently for our chance to get some ice cream. I decided to get three flavors: roasted banana (mmm), honey lavender (more mmm), and earl grey (maximum mmm). The roasted banana had that real banana taste to it, none of that artificial crap that some places try to pass off as banana. The honey lavender was a good mix of the two flavors without one over powering the other. The taste had a flowery after taste, but a pleasant one. Now the earl grey I was skeptical to try since I absolute detest the tea, but I wanted to give it a try because it sounded too interesting to pass up on. Yeah, I'm hella glad I tried it since it turned out to be my favorite flavor of the bunch. I don't know how to describe it, but safe to say it's not anything like the tea (which may be a bad thing if you love the tea). Over all, I'd say it was a very well worth it 40 minute wait for ice cream. Definitely a place to go to when your in the city. Can't wait to go back with my darling churro (Cheryl Y.)

I check in here whenever I make it down to the Mission: this place has definitely earned the popularity. Worth the lines! They've really found a good formula with the salted caramel.

The first time I came here was with my mom after having lunch at Pizza Delfina. It was on a week day during work hours which was nice because there wasn't a line and we were able to taste the different flavors to our hearts content. And after trying so many different flavors, who knew my favorite would be the Salted Caramel. It's sweet but not too sweet, it's the perfect balance between the two flavors. GO TRY IT!

What to eat? Head on down to Bi-Rite Creamery and lets your senses be awakened... There's always a queue for this place, but the staff are efficient and it moves fast. You may be overwhelmed by the variety on offer, but don't worry... THEY'RE ALL GOOD. And besides, the brownie sundae is to die for. Panty-dropping-lcious, to paraphrase a friend.

Look for the neon pink ice cream cone above the door, a line anytime of the day & the handwritten menu on the chalk board outside & you'll know you've arrived at the Bi-rite Creamery (across the street from the Bi-Rite Market.) I finally settled on coffee toffee & brown sugar ginger swirl (both were sugary sweet & worth the wait) after sampling a buncha flavors: honey lavender, salted caramel & malted vanilla with peanut brittle. The guy helping me was totally patient with my indecisiveness & wasn't all "judgey-eyes" about me sampling. I loved the texture of the two flavors I had-extra, super, doped up on velvet creamy but still had crispy bits of toffee or brown sugar running through it. You can tell they only use high quality ingredients & that they care about servin' up some high end ice cream. Bi-Rite ice cream is like the Louis Vuitton of ice creams. Thank goodness I don't live anywhere near here because at $4.75 for 2-3 decent sized scoops, I'd be in some serious trouble with my favorite pair of "skinny" jeans. *update 9.18.09* i usually only like lavender in my massage oils, but their honey lavender changed my perception--honey lavender ice cream is amazing.

I came here with some friends on a rainy day. Despite the cold and wet weather, Bi-rite creamery was still delicious. They make an interesting selection of ice cream flavors, salted caramel, roasted banana, strawberry balsamic, malted vanilla and much much more. Although they did not have strawberry balsamic when I went, I definitely recommend it. Good balsamic vinegar, when mixed or roasted with strawberries, really brings out the natural sweetness of the fruit. And the fact that they were able to churn the ice cream base (with vinegary) is still a perplexing mystery to me. Although, probably because I have been spoiled by Berkeley's Ici's Creamery, I was a bit disappointed by the consistency of the ice cream; it was more runny than I am used to, meaning that they used a normal ice cream base instead of a custard cream base. Also, the ice cream lacked texture, which i normally like. However, that could just be a personal preference. Overall, the ice cream was smooth and the unique flavors really came through; so I enjoyed it. Will need to come back to try their strawberry balsamic ice cream and their sundaes, for I heard that they are really good.

First time I went to Bi-Rite Creamery, I thought "what an odd location for an ice cream place. I don't think they'll do very well." A few months later I was soaking up the rays at Dolores Park and we all decided we wanted an ice cream. And what was round the corner? That's right, Bi-Rite. The line was round the block, consisting almost entirely of park -goers. Makes perfect sense to me now. I am an idiot. PS Oh, and the ice cream? Well, it's no Mitchell's, but it's pretty damn good. And on a hot San Francisco day (don't snigger, we have them every now and again), when you're in the park, there's no more convenient place to pick up a scoop or two.

ffinnaallyyyyy got to try this place. It was raining like crazy in all sorts of directions and my damn umbrella broke, but this ice cream made up for it. I had roasted banana, which might be my new favorite ice cream flavor now (sorry lavender honey). I also had some sort of vanilla ice cream with peanut brittle and chocolate, a winning combination, but not as mouthwatering as roasted banana. I guess the storm dissuaded people from eating ice cream because there was no line there!

Move to San Francisco for this place. ÊDon't leave because of it. ÊBecome a slave. ÊIf I grew ice cream for hair, I would fight faust for the right to grow bi-rite. ÊA list: Brown sugar with ginger-caramel swirl Peanut butter with fudge swirl Honey lavender Roasted banana Malted canilla with peanut brittle THOSE ARE MY FAVES. However, something terrible has happened. ÊNot terrible in a take-a-star-away kind of way. ÊBut nonetheless, my spine has been chilled: brown sugar with ginger-caramel swirl has not been on the menu for 9 months. ÊWHAT IS HAPPENING??????? Bi-Rite, must I beg? Seriously though, I cry into my latest cone as I strut Dolo mojo all the way home.

Ok I now know why Mariah Carey chose to sing a song about Honey...she must have had the Honey Lavender ice cream at Bi-Rite of course! Here I am, sitting at my desk with no sweets in site just thinking about it. I look out the window, oh dear it is only 3 bart stations away. WHY? And for that matter why can't it be 5 o'clock yet? But it's not just the flavors at Bi-Rite that get me going, it's the ultimate creaminess of the ice cream itself. They don't call it a 'creamery' for nothing, and believe me it gets you real creamy - ok, maybe not, but it is def. foodgasm worthy. Strauss organic cream can do that to you. Try making whipped cream with Strauss and clover and bam, you'll know. Now imagine how much better that makes the ice cream! Whether or not it's better than Mitchell's has long been debated. I personally like Mitchell's coconut ice cream, so I could never scratch Mitchell's, no way. But there must be a reason all my friends go to Bi-Rite....There must be a reason people sit around on couches dreaming about their Salted Caramel (that's my second favorite). There must be something going on I swear it's the cream.

I just want to say I hate ice cream. I just do. It's cold, and a lot of times it doesn't taste good, hurts my throat, cold stuff makes me cough a lot, potential diabetic risk, and blah blah blah. I fell in love with ice cream when I had some of Bi-Rite's ice cream. Pretty cheap too considering it's all homemade. I swear to god, ice cream will never be the same because of this. I almost wish I could order some right now. *salivate* Lame part? The bizarre line. I tell you, if there's one thing I cannot stand it's standing for long periods of time. Second to that is standing in a line. The WORST is standing in line for long periods of time which is exactly what happens with Bi-Rite. It wasn't so bad...once you had the ice cream. Also, we had to deal with some Orange County bitches (they MUST'VE come all the way from SoCal to piss me off, otherwise I have no idea who these fucking people thought they were) who with their pearls and wrinkled botoxed skin had to hold up the entire line and then merge into the second line which was JUST to pay and cut in front of several people and then conveniently say "oh I'm sorry did I cut in front of you my bad" and then just stay there. You evil bitches. Take your fat babies and die. Choke on that ice cream! You have tainted the vibe! *foams at mouth*

(What happens when Bi-Rite reaches 9999 reviews?) I feel so unfaithful! I pledged forever love to salted caramel! But I've finally tried the Brown Sugar, Ginger, & Caramel Swirl that Gordon, Rick, and Bora rave about. It is indeed as delicious as they say and my heart has wandered! (I have to confess....I even ate it for breakfast the other day....haha. Don't pretend you haven't had something just as ridiculous for breakfast!!!) I also tried the ricanella (snickerdoodle) and while it was good, I think the flavor of cinnamon can be overpowering so that if you have two flavors in your cup, you might not taste the other flavor as well. My cousin keeps ordering the Ritual coffee flavor every time he comes even though the coffee keeps him up at night...he thinks it's worth it. My brother's favorite is the roasted banana. My brother and I are already plotting to go back and get more. Maybe we will go when there isn't a long line and there's less pressure to decide what flavors to get.

Now most people seem to go for fancy wedding cakes, or the faddish fountain, but we wanted an ice cream cake from Bi-Rite Creamery. No one's protest of "It's going to melt" would deter us. Bi-Rite thought it was a great idea. We had the place to ourselves for our early morning appointment. The woman who was helping us gave us samples of every flavor ice cream we could possibly have desired. Unfortunately, no actual ice cream cake. Even though their catering menu clearly specified their prices, I was braced for a shake-down when we mentioned the magic word caters love to hear: "wedding". The prices were the same no matter the occasion. We ended up getting 2 half sheets (so it'd be easier to stick in the restaurants walk-in), plus a little round for our table. We had seasonal balsamic strawberry and a number of other flavors. Sadly, the servers at our wedding didn't know what they were handing people. But our friends and family ate it up anyway. We got no less than a dozen compliments (there were only 50 people). People loved it! What was really awesome is that without telling us, Bi-Rite decorated our little round in a festive way. Plus, they were stuck with our dietary requirements for the decoration as well. Now that's service. So not only do we love to get our scoops on cones here, we can recommend Bi-Rite for your wedding cake. Simply delicious!

The ice cream here lives up to the hype. ÊI'm typically averse to hype, especially when it requires having to stand in the freezing cold at 10pm for over 40 minutes to get ice cream. ÊThe moment you finally reach the doorway and can read the menu, it's quite a rush. ÊI mean, how can flavors such as: malted vanilla with peanut brittle, roasted banana, toasted coconut, and salted caramel not get you excited? I dug into my creamy combo of salted caramel and toasted coconut ice cream and the world paused for just a delicious second. ÊIt was rich, flavorful, creamy yet textured, and absolutely one of my most enjoyable ice cream moments. ÊI didn't want to stop eating it. ÊAnd I realized that I would have stood in that 40 minute line in the freezing cold time and time again - if it meant a scoop of my Bi-Rite ice cream. Luckily for the Bi-Rite ice cream lover, you can take home pints of your favorite flavors at either the ice cream shop or Bi-Rite grocery store a few stores down the street. ÊI'm a new super fan!

YUMM YUMM YUMM - the perfect place on a warm San Francisco day and people watch and laze around at nearby Dolores Park. This place is so friendly, always has a long line (which moves fast though, and you can always opt for the soft serve next door that has no line), but as they say, you have to wait for good things. I ama Êfan of small, local businesses that care about what they put out and Bi-rite with its small batch, organic, creamy and flavorful product satisfies me absolutely! LOVE LOVE the Salted Caramel, Roasted Banana and the Honey Lavender (in that order) and even though they don't all go together, that does not stop me from doing just that :) There is the Bi-rite Grocery across the street (next to Delfina, another favorite) so you can stock up on that creamy salted caramel goodness!

I think that Bi-Rite Creamery makes excellent ice cream, just not the swoon-I'm-having-a-foodgasm-and-I-can-die-a-happy-?person type of ice cream. ÊTheir ice cream is great, but I think that I expected a lot more (perhaps a bit unfairly), based on all the rapturous reviews on Yelp. Ê Going on a weekday afternoon is the best way to avoid lines- we pretty much had the whole place to ourselves when we went. ÊThe salted caramel was definitely going to be one of the flavors we got- after all, all these Yelpers can't be wrong, right? ÊUnfortunately, I was a little disappointed. ÊWhile good, I think that the salted caramel was a little too salty. ÊThe caramel flavor was delicious and complex, but less salt would have made it perfect. ÊWe also tried the honey lavender, the roasted banana, and the malted vanilla with nuts. ÊThe honey lavender tasted too much of lavender- it didn't seem balanced with the honey. ÊI would have preferred a more subtle lavender flavor. ÊThe roasted banana was deemed the favorite of the four flavors, though I think the banana flavor could have been punched up a bit. ÊThe malted vanilla was quite good and was a close second to the banana. We also got a package of the toffee chip cookies- good, but I think they would have been much more awesome if the cookies were heated (The toffee was a little hard.). ÊThat way the toffee chips would have been melted and gooey-the cookies would then be perfect for dipping into ice cream. Bi-Rite is a little out of the way for me, so coming back would be a result of being in the area and craving ice cream. ÊThe parking situation is pretty horrible, even on a weekday, and its best to bring the smallest car possible, so that you can fit into the spaces. ÊBi-Rite does make some of the freshest tasting ice creams I've had and I really applaud their enviromental consciousnesss (compostable spoons and cups, organic ingredients), but I just wish that the ice cream flavors blew me away as they did other Yelpers.

My trip to Bi-Rite was so amazing that I insisted my sister take a photo of me in front of the menu outside afterwards, in which I look maniacal with happiness. ÊThe gentleman at the counter was lovely, offering spoon upon spoon of samples and telling us his recommendations. ÊI went with one of his recommendations, brown sugar with caramel and ginger swirl, along with malted vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate. Ê Like so many businesses in SF, Bi-Rite really seems to take pride in using quality, mostly organic ingredients. ÊWhen, oh when, will this modus operandi take hold in NY? ÊThe ice cream is incredible-- creamy, complex flavors, natural tasting... and on an aesthetic note, just perfect looking in a cone. ÊMy favorite dessert of our trip!

Bi-Rite Creamery has been on my list of "to try" eateries for a while now. ÊAs expected, you yelpers know a thing or two about good eats; Bi-rite did not disappoint! ÊWithin seconds of entering Bi-Rite, I got the cozy "old-diner" vibe, which I love. ÊThe flavors are handwritten on the glass and everything is organic and local, a few personal touches that add to the novelty of the creamery. ÊAll the flavors are silky, rich, and creamy - you really can't go wrong with anything that your heart desires. Ê DO... - Try the salted caramel - best seller for a reason! - Try the coffee toffee if you're a caffeine junkie. ÊHas a rich coffee flavor to it and tastes like actual coffee beans in the ice cream. - Try the Ricanelas - cinnamon with snickerdoodles. ÊMy favorite of the trip! ÊMakes eating your ice cream like a treasure hunt looking for the tasty cookie morsels mixed into the ice cream. DON'T... - Feel bad asking for samples to decide on what you want (unless of course there's a huge line of people glaring at you). ÊKudos to Bi-Rite for being green and using metal spoons for tastings. - Be deceived by the small cups! I got 2 scoops so I could enjoy two different flavors, and was so full by the last bite. Ê - Get discouraged by a long line. ÊIt's moves pretty fast. Ê Decent prices for a gourmet ice cream experience! ÊI will definitely be back when my sweet tooth cravings hit!

How can you say no to ice cream. This is my new relief joint after being tortured by my chiropractor (which happens twice a week), so this means that I will be having ice cream to sooth my pain with ice cream twice a week. Fair trade. Parking is very limited and there are only five small tables inside. But they do have a restroom. There is seating outside. There are long lines, when I went, but it moves very fast. For those who Yelp via AT&T iPhone, there is no reception. Nada...So it may be hard to "Check-In" there. Ê So far I have tried three types there. The salted caramel, brown sugar, and the malted vanilla. The salted caramel tasted more like peanut brittle but with a little bit of a salty pinch to it. Very good and a must have. Next one I had was the malted vanilla. This one had peanut butter bits through out the dish. This one was oh so good too. Ê Last was the brown sugar. I really liked this one. I totally forgot what was in it. I guess my senses were blown away by the yummy goodness in my tummy...or it could have been the brain freeze after eating it so fast. As they say back in Hawaii...Onolicious!!!

Well. I was spoiled at a very young age by working at the best ice cream place in the world, with the best boss ever (Screamin' Mimi's in Sebastopol... absolutely worth the drive), so any ice cream I've had since I was 15 has had a LOT to live up to. I wouldn't even eat Ben and Jerry's for years. So, I really like the whole idea of Bi-Rite, but, for me, it didn't live up to the hype. I am obsessed with sweet & salty together, so I loved the idea of salted caramel ice cream, but honestly, it really wasn't that impressive to me. Sam's Sundae was also an interesting concept, with the salt and olive oil and chocolate, but it didn't work for me. Not bad, just not what I was hoping for, I guess. They do get points for using biodegradable spoons and cups.

ÊFor me, there were 3 or 4. ÊI ended up trying earl grey, coffee toffee, and pumpkin pie. ÊAll 3 flavors were DELICIOUS, but I opted to get the earl grey and coffee toffee kuz, well, coffee and tea - what better duo is there? I am a HUGE fan of coffee ice cream. ÊIt's my favorite flavor, probably because I'm a recovering coffee addict. ÊBi-Rite's coffee ice cream definitely did not disappoint. ÊI loved how it had a lot of coffee flavor, without all the sugar that a lot of ice cream places like to pack in all of their ice creams. (I drink my coffee with cream, not sugar, so I'm not a fan of the sweet coffee flavor) ÊThis coffee toffee paired perfectly with the earl grey, which was super flavorful but very light at the same time. ÊI still don't know how that's possible, but somehow, Bi-Rite figured it out. Anyway, I thought their scoops were way too small, probably because I loved my 2 flavors. ÊI tried the bf's cookies and cream and salted caramel - didn't like the cookies and cream, and salted caramel, while flavorful, wasn't exactly my favorite flavor. ÊMaybe a little too salty for my tastes.

The name Bi-Rite makes me think of the 25 cent ice cream we used to get at our neighborhood Thrifty drug store. But Bi-Rite is no 25 cent ice cream store, no siree! As the line will tell you, this place makes amazing ice cream. Interesting flavors but nothing too bizarre (see my Humphry Slocombe review). There's something for everyone. ÊI ordered a double scoop of roasted banana & ricanelas. I loved the bits of snickerdoodle cookie in the ice cream. What a great idea! I also tried a lick or 2 of the salted caramel (very strong creme brulee flavor-YUM) & ginger (not too gingery, just right!). They were all amazing. Unfortunately 2 in our group of 6 decided not to partake in the yumminess (party poopers!) otherwise I would have tried theirs, too. Come to Bi-Rite, get a few scoops, & enjoy the people watching outside.

ÊIf they were selling something they actually had to cook, like meat on a stick or dumplings swimming in MSG soup, the wait would probably have been at least half an hour.

Once inside the store itself, I eyed the menu and decided on two scoops in one cone, with the salted caramel ice cream and the brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl ice cream.

Ê The Roasted Banana, on the other hand, is almost strange... in a fantastic sort of way. ÊI'm usually not a huge fan of banana ice creams, but this one fits the bill of any exception you might have to consider. ÊIt's not just your average banana flavor... it's a ROASTED banana flavor... a taste you can MOST DEFINITELY distinguish. 5 Stars

**UPDATE** 9/28/07 Tuesday was, like, the hottest day of the year. How do I know this? I had a serious hankering for some ice cream. Only happens once a year and usually as Indian Summer drops the heat bomb that should'a happened in August. Double parked, ran in, got myself a double scoop (it was THAT hot outside) of salted caramel and white chocolate raspberry swirl, and was out the door in under 5 minutes. It was the best hot weather treat EVER! ÊSalted caramel, people. Holy shit!! *********** I'm not an ice cream person. Don't be so shocked! I'm not. Never have been. It was sort of a problem for my family who LOVED the stuff. I mean, it's not that I don't LIKE ice cream, I just would never really go out of my way to get it or eat it. Or wait in a long line for it. ÊI mean, if you put it in front of me, like, on top of a cobbler or something I'll eat it and enjoy it...I don't know what it is... Bi-Rite Creamery may have changed all of that. Seriously. Their lavender-honey ice cream is the loveliest, creamiest, most delightful frozen cream I've ever tasted. It was elegant and decadent and just plain good! Like I imagine ice cream should be! Really effin' good! Maybe-I'll-wait-in-line-myself-next-time-good! Well...that might be pushing it. Fortunately, I have people for that.

After reading numerous review... I've wanted to come here for so long, but has never been able to make it. It just so happen we were at Pizzeria Delfina and decided since we were so close we will eat ice cream here. I ordered the salted caramel and chocolate. Êthe chocolate is a very deep dark chocolate, to the point where its more chocolate than sweet. ÊI like. Êvery very rich chocolate. Êthe salted caramel... was goooodddd... I will definitely get that again. ÊAs my friend Monica described it, it tasted like the toasted outside of a marshmallow, but cold... no burning of the tongue here. Êthe ice cream texture itself was smooth. Êits very dense and rich. ÊI scrapped that cup to the last lick. ÊITs true... its definitely good to the last lick. My friend got toasted coconut and she was quite surprised that it was actually toasted coconut. ÊMy other friend got the lemon pistachio and snickerdoodle, which both i also liked. Ê I guess i liked everything I tried there.

Aside from waiting in line for 15+minutes everything was good about this place!!! ÊThe flavors are innovative, the taste superb and the people working there were very patient and helpful. I had the salted caramel and it was a full of flavor, salty and sweet. ÊI also had the Cinnamon w/ snickerdoodle, yum!! ÊMy sis had the creme fraiche and she loved it. ÊI also sampled a few flavors and my favs were the balsamic strawberry & toasted coconut, ÊMoreover, the prices were pretty decent, I paid $3.25 for a cone and 2 scoops. ÊThis is definitely one of my favorite ice cream places in the city!

This is absolutely, positively, certainly a MUST try if you spend any time in San Francisco. I have been on a bit of an ice cream frenzy lately, and there is hardly anything better than salted caramel, honey lavender or, well, anything else at Bi-Rite.

FINALLY had a chance to stop by on a Sunday night. Parking is always an issue...but I was lucky and found parking right on the corner of Dolores and 18th! ÊThere wasn't much of a line... it was out the door, but the wait was only about 5 minutes! I tried the orange cardamom, which was yummy goodness (Ici in Berkeley is the only other place that has some yummy ice cream with cardamom). And also had a scoop of honey lavender. nomnoms. So smooth and creamy. The boy ordered a Sundae with malted vanilla and salted caramel, which came with fudge and peanut brittle. He absolutely loved it. I tasted a bit of the salted caramel, and I might have to come back for that. Good spot, but I'm more of a fruity/tropical flavor person...so Mitchell's still remains my favorite!

After hailing Bi-Rite ice cream and the quality of the goodness that goes into each delectable serving to co-workers at a company BBQ, I had no choice but to order the Sundae Party Kit when it was time to do an Ice Cream Social for the company. Bi-Rite Creamery didn't disappoint. ÊI ordered the delicious handpacked quarts of Vanilla, Honey Lavender and Salted Caramel for the three Straus Family Dairy flavors in addition to the Soy Chocolate and Plum Sorbet for any Vegetarians/Vegans who may not eat dairy. They completely set us up with more than enough biodegradable bowls and spoons (corn-based, I believe) as well as organic blueberries, toasted almonds, hot fudge, hot caramel, brownie bites, whipped cream and sprinkles. Ê It was a hit and the leftovers were minimal. ÊI found out that the coffee lovers can always use the whipped cream and caramel in their morning caffeine rituals. Ê Personally, the only negative that I had was the aftertaste of lavender in my mouth ALL day (think: soap).

I'm gonna' say it's overrated. I like ice cream as much as the next girl but I even the salt caramel flavor that everybody raves about seemed flat. I like the idea of a little independent ice cream place but the their selection of flavors didn't impress me too much. The people who worked there were nice and quick but I don't think there's a reason to wait in line for a dairy treat. I can grab a Klondike bar or Nestle's cone for less money and time. In fact I'd rather do business with the guys who push around a little, white, belled cart with a wide selection of frozen goodies. Actually I'd rather have the ice cream man come down my block in his spectacular, ice cream truck! Hmmmm, maybe I want to be the ice cream girl! I'll wear a push up bra and sell push up pops; I'll be more successful than anyone! hahaha!

OVERRATED! I had been looking forward to going to Bi-Rite for quite some time. ÊAll the damn food snobs that I know always rave about the place. ÊHowever, upon finally getting over there today for a mid-afternoon taste, I was disappointed to learn that the hype is much greater than the ice cream itself. Miraculously, the line was not too long (I have driven by many times to see a much longer line). ÊI had hoped to try banana since banana is the measuring stick by which I judge all ice cream places. ÊUnfortunately, they were out. ÊInstead, it would have to be a single cone with Orange Cardamom and Honey Lavender. ÊI was put off at how ridiculous and food snob-esque some of the flavors were, so I figured I had to try them. Ê The flavors themselves were actually okay. ÊHowever, to me, the ice cream experience is half flavor, and half texture. ÊThe texture of this ice cream is terrible. ÊThere is way too much ice in the ice cream. ÊYou can feel the ice crystals. ÊIt's as if you just dug out an old carton from inside your freezer that had all the freezerburn ice crystals forming on the surface of the ice cream. ÊNot good - I usually throw that ice cream away. ÊInstead, at Bi-Rite, you can get a tiny portion of it at a price appropriate for a serving twice what you get. If you want good ice cream, stick to Mitchell's. ÊYou can't go wrong. ÊBi-Rite isn't worth it.

So at the recommendation of a few Nor Cal natives, we came here around 10 pm on a Saturday night on the spur of the moment to kill some time and try out this place out. We had plans lined up later that night, so we just wanted a quick dessert pit stop. So there we were about to arrive, and as we were turning the corner, we saw a huge line for Bi-Rite that was literally out the door. All this on a chilly Saturday night in the SF! Disappointment... Heartbreak... So we find an illegal parking spot across the street, and spend 10 minutes debating whether or not it was worth it to wait outside in the cold for the ice cream. Then, as I was eyeing the long line in longing and in jealousy, I suddenly saw the Bi-Rite Creamery to-go stand, about two storefronts down from the actual store.... It was as if both fate and divine intervention intervened! So what did we do next? We risked our lives jaywalking across the street at 10:30 pm, waited in line for a glorious 5 minutes, and ate a PINT of EARL GREY ICE CREAM in the comfort of a Honda CRV. Was it worth it? Damn right it was.... Down to every last bite of the every last penny of the $7.99 I paid. As a self-proclaimed tea lover, the Earl Grey Ice Cream is exactly what you would imagine - Earl Grey milk tea frozen in a pint of ice cream goodness. IT WAS AMAZING. A taste of heaven, almost - it tastes exactly like Earl Grey tea, but it's not too sweet, and it definitely hits the spot. So for my first business venture after I make millions of dollars of course, I intend on using the concept of tea flavors (conventional and unconventional) and making ice cream flavors out of them. Yes, I have it patented already, so don't try to jip my brilliant idea.

Bi-Rite's ice cream is okay but i am giving them 4 stars because they have unique flavors (Balsamic Lavender, Cinnamon with Snicker doodles, Roasted Bananas and etc). The line can be out the door but the quick service makes the wait just 5 minutes are less. Seriously, what is consider GOOD ice cream? Maybe I'm just not an ice cream person because ill eat ice cream from Polly Ann's or even Baskin Robbins. But if you are in the mood for something different or around the neighborhood, check out Bi-Rite. PS. Parking can be a biotchh......

Just had a customized ice cream cake from Bi-Rite last night .... and let me tell you... WOOOOOOOOOWWWW. ÊI've never tasted any kind of cake like that! ÊMy friend chose this cake based off of someone else's birthday cake that they tried 2 weeks prior. Ê The cake from top to bottom: ÊRicanela icecream with snickerdoodle cookie dough, banana ice cream, gingerbread cake crust. ÊThe cake wasn't too sweet at all. ÊALL the flavors complimented each other sooo well. ÊEven banana ice cream haters LOVED this cake. ÊThe banana flavor wasn't too overbearing. ÊIt was a nice hint of banana creaminess. ÊI'm not a fan of cookie dough ice cream... but this snickerdoodle cookie dough was amazing. ÊIt was nice and crunchy and added a lot of flavor to it. ÊWe got a 8" cake, good for 10-12 people... and for the 8 people that were eating this cake, there was only 1/7 of the cake left... It was THAT good. ÊEven through my diet, I caved in and went for the 2nd slice. =D ÊMust try an ice cream cake sometime. ÊIf you plan on customizing a cake, order it 3-4days in advance. Also have been here for the ice cream a while back. ÊYes, the lines get pretty long... but the lines go by pretty fast. ÊBlame all the people asking for samples (like me ;) ). ÊThere were WAY too many flavors that I had no idea about... much less knew what they would taste like. ÊLavender? ÊSalted Caramel?? ÊAll sounds soooo weird! ÊBut to my surprise, they were both very good! ÊThe Lavender does taste like a flower tho! ÊI did try a million samples to make sure I got the right flavors =P ÊI ended up with the salted caramel and i can't remember the other one. Ê The pricing for ice cream here is decent, not TOO overly priced, but I guess pretty avg for ice cream shops around SF. ÊThe portions were small though... but still worth a try!

Flavors that make Bi-Rite so awesome (in my book of books): *Salted Caramel *Roasted Banana *Honey Lavendar *Spiced Chai Tea They have more flavors available, BUT THESE YOU MUST DEFINITELY TRY!!!!!

Yum! Enjoying a warm evening I walked over with my roomie after dinner. Hipsters in hoodies mulled around contemplating which flavor combo would broadcast their street-cred to others as they leisurely licked. Just then came an announcement from behind the counter: "Free upgrade to anyone who knows EXACTLY what they want!" "I'm ready" I replied and was soon enjoying the rich creamy goodness of the roasted banana in a waffle cone. I got the hook-up and of a double at the single scoop price. Nice! I still prefer the exotic selection at ÊBombay Ice Creamery, but I'll be back to try the sundaes. . . .

I was never the girl who dreamed of what her wedding day would be like. Ê The dress, the flowers, the venue - I did not spend years envisioning all these things. ÊExcept for one thing: THE CAKE. ÊIf I got married, I knew one thing for sure: I wanted an ice cream wedding cake! Well, I did get married, and my fiance-now-husband proved that he was perfect for me by totally being into the idea of having an ice cream wedding cake. ÊThat was actually the first wedding decision we made. ÊAnd given that we had enjoyed Bi-Rite so many times - and had gotten a brochure from them outlining their reasonable cake prices - the decision to get a cake there was made. It couldn't have been easier. ÊI gave them a call and explained what we wanted: just a simple ice cream cake to feed fifty people. ÊIt could be a plain sheet cake - we were absolutely not expecting anything fancy - no tiered concoction for us. ÊWe made an appointment to come in and sample some flavors (yum!). ÊWe ended up deciding on two half sheet cakes - one yellow cake with Balsamic Strawberry and Ricanela, the other a chocolate cake with Mint Chip Ice Cream. ÊWe also decided to do a small round "Bride and Groom" cake, with Balsamic Strawberry and Ricanela ice cream and gingerbread cake. ÊWe weren't expecting much in the way of decoration - the sheet cakes would be cut up in the kitchen at the reception and served to guests, and the round cake - well, Bi-Rite said that they'd pretty it up since it would be photographed, but really, we just wanted a cake that tasted good. The day before our wedding, we went to Bi-Rite to pick up the cakes (they don't deliver). Ê ÊMuch to our surprise and delight, our round cake was GORGEOUS - it was piled high with strawberries and shards of white chocolate. ÊIt looked absolutely wonderful (no need for a cake topper!). ÊWe put them on dry ice and drove them 1/2 hour to our reception site. Ê The cakes were a big hit! ÊI think all our guests had multiple slices. Ê One of the best parts: the cost. ÊThe three cakes were totally within our budget. Ê I love Bi-Rite all the more now - not only do they make great ice cream, but they made us a beautiful, memorable wedding cake!

Love everything about Bi Rite so bad! The line looks really intimidating, but trust me it goes fast (and even if it didn't it's totally worth the wait). I can't wait to see the expansion...which was set to be unveiled today! I love the decor on the inside and out. The giant pink ice cream cone is a super cute touch. Last time I was here I split a do-it-yourself sundae with a friend, which was a wise choice because A. it was delicious B. I was stuffed after eating half, but know I would have continued eating the other half if I wasn't sharing because it. is. that. good. We got two flavors: toasted coconut and salted caramel with hot fudge and I think toasted almonds? I don't remember for sure because I was in such ice cream bliss.

You scream, we scream, we all scream for ice cream. ÊHad to see what all the hype was about, this line out the door down the block? ÊWhy folks are really into this place? ÊYes It was good...nice creamy consistency, unique flavors like Chai spiced chocolate and Balsamic Strawberry, organic ingredients used on the billing/ packaging. Ê Maybe it's the retro signage, the fancy neo architecture or the benches with the Palm Trees out front that made you feel like you were in eating ice cream in Miami, maybe just a whole packaging of that...

After a violently spicy Ethiopian dinner tempered by ambrosial honey wine, my friend and I headed to the famous Bi-Rite to see what all the fuss was about. When we saw the line, we knew were in for a treat. It extended to the end of the block, with the typical San Francisco motley crew of yuppies, hipsters, and weirdos. Frankly, the discussions with various members of the line was legitimate entertainment in itself and made it go quickly. Despite the crowds, when we got to the counter we couldn't resist trying all of the exotically conceived flavors. Brown Butter Pecan? Ricanelas (cinnamon with Snickerdoodles)? Balsamic Strawberry? I am no stranger to *unusual* flavors such as "corn sorbet" at New York's Cones, but these flavors sound like Willy Wonka got into Timothy Leary's secret stash. Fortunately, the flavor combinations themselves are brilliantly executed, with Brown Butter Pecan being an especial favorite of mine. However, the texture of the ice cream leaves a lot to be desired. There is a vague chalkiness to the texture which I believe is due to miniature ice chunks, as I felt several larger pieces of ice which became even more obvious as the ice cream quickly softened in the cup. These texture deficiencies were aggravating enough to warrant a 2-star deduction, although I think I may be judging particularly harshly due to Bi-Rite's peerless reputation.

There is something very bad ass about sitting outside, the night before a storm, unabashedly eating full fat ice cream. If you're going to eat rich food, it has to be enjoyed and savored.

I'm not really sure how I have reviewed three other ice cream places before Bi-Rite, because this the hands-down winner in the category of ALL THINGS EVER. ÊIf Cheeseboard pizza is what I will eat as my last meal on earth, Bi-Rite's brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl ice cream will be the dessert. Expect to wait anywhere between 15 - 30 minutes at least if the weather is above 60F. ÊOr, you can go in the middle of winter. ÊYou'll be able to walk right in.

Oh god... how I miss living in the city... for missing these treasured places like Bi-Rite. Ever see a line that looks a mile long and you have flashbacks to Disneyland lines without FastPass... AND you still get so excited and anxious.. welcome to Bi-Rite Creamery. Depending on the time you go there, most likely, you can expect a line... and trust me you will probably go there with your ice cream cravings when most other people have them as well. The first time I heard about this place, my husband and I were just living in the city--- and I was about 1.5 months pregnant and I was craving something creamy and sooo good. Well! my baby boy and I were sure happy... or least I would like to think he was sharing in this experience and my guilty of stuffing my face with good good ice cream was eased. So lets get to the REAL scoop- the ice cream. My favorite (as most other reviews will state here)- SALTED CARAMEL! There is just something sooo right about this flavor. I have always love chocolate covered caramels with sea salt on top.. but honestly, you wont even miss the chocolate in this ice cream. It is smooth, creamy and the balance of caramel with that hint of salt is perfection at its finest. My husband needing to fare out tried their Balsamic Strawberry and let me tell you, it was pretty awesome. Others that people have claimed to be good- Roasted Banana and Honey Lavendar. YUM! The line can be a bit long but it goes by fast and you won't regret it. One thing to note-- Parking is a bitch in this area. Avoid if you can, spare the earth and walk there from your closest public transport. So, if you want to indulge and have no regrets about it, then Bi-Rite is the place to go!

I feel like I'm the last person on earth to try bi-rite...finally got over there last weekend. ÊEven though it was a bit chilly, the line was down the block - a good sign in my book. ÊAs I couldn't pick just one flavor, I opted for honey lavender, mexican chocolate and salted caramel. ÊMy friend had a sundae. ÊWe were both in our own personal heavens until he scooped up the last bit of his ice cream and said with a big grin, "Oops, did you want some of this?". ÊNice, real nice. ÊNo bonus points for him. Ê But major bonus points for bi-rite, it's yet another reason to get over to the Mission.

I don't think I am going to write a thorough review. Everything that I wanted to say has already been said. Everything. Read Lori K.'s review; she pretty much sums it up! I will add though that I was tempted to remove a star because of the wait. I am not an impatient person but the line last week was almost around the block! I think they should open another location in the Haight. We're all sooooo very tired of chains (Ben & Jerry, I'm looking at you.) I want exotic flavors like Orange Cardamom and Honey Lavender! Anything that tastes perfumey is yummy to Yum Yum.

Let me just preface this review by stating I'm not an ice cream aficionado nor am I an ice cream snob (well before bi-rite at least!). ÊBefore this place, I just assumed that ice cream was a pretty standard fare dessert. ÊSure there was this one time in a bakery in Vittel, France that somehow combined warm fresh baked waffle-like cones with semi-melted ice cream that blended into a delectable treat. ÊBut places like that are more the exception than the rule . ÊIn the US, ice cream is ice cream. ÊOr so I thought. ÊBi-Rite changes all that. ÊThe only thing that is standard at bi-rite is the wait! ÊExpect to wait in line for at least 15-20 minutes on a spring or summer day. Ê The flavors at this place are amazing. ÊSalted Caramel-Yes;Honey Lavender-Yes (and don't knock it till you try it), even the mint chip tasted way better than any other ice cream I've had before. ÊThey have standard flavors for the less adventurous. Don't let the odd name of the restaurant scare you or the sticker shock from your $3.25 mini-bowl of ice cream. ÊStand in line and check it out. ÊThe ice cream rocks, the people are nice and the ice cream rocks...did I say that? Call me a snob b/c I'm never going back to Dairy Queen again! jjg

You know when you meet someone who's ridiculously good-looking, so you just assume that she must be dumber than a box of hammers to make up for the blessed genes? ÊAnd then... then, she tells you about the research she's doing with her Fulbright Scholarship Award? Bi-Rite is like that. ÊThey're ridiculously good at ice cream. ÊEveryone seems to agree that Bi-Rite is blessed with long legs and huge knockers. ÊThe thing is, not everyone is aware that Bi-Rite got 2400 on their SATs! And by that I mean, they do cake, too! ÊNot just ice cream cake, but actual baked, moist, delicious chocolate midnight CAKE! Bi-Rite is no empty-headed one-trick pony who'll let you do shots out of her navel on spring break.

Very delicious and unique flavors! ÊI had the Salted Caramel and the Earl Grey. Salted Caramel is very interesting. ÊI'm not a big fan of sweets so the salted caramel worked for me because the "saltiness" offsets the sweetness in the caramel. ÊIt's a little bit salty during my first lick, then it gradually turns into the caramel sweetness. ÊI think it's a good blend. ÊIt's interesting and hard to put it in words, you just have to try it yourself. Earl Grey is my favorite. ÊIt is very light and not too sweet but you can taste the Earl Grey tea flavor. ÊIf you've ever had very good macha green tea ice cream, the taste is similar...except that it's Earl Grey instead of green tea. ÊThis flavor is very refreshing and it definitely wakes you up after waiting in that long line. Yes the line is long, but you can sample as many flavors as you like and the staff is very nice and friendly. ÊAlso, if you want to try out more flavors at once, the "single" size can get you 2 mini scoops of 2 different flavors. Ê I will definitely come back to try out other flavors.

4.5 stars I couldn't help but crave ice cream while staring at the crisp blue sky today. And it was fricken meant to be because there was NO LINE at fricken Bi-Rite Creamery. I guess everyone was too busy frolicking in the green across the street. Anyway. Their Malt Vanilla with chocolate chips and rice krispies can holler at me anytime cuz that flavor, while is a bit too sweet, is FOBulicious! It tastes just like my childhood fave, Horlicks!!! The workers on the other hand, you suck. You better chuck the bad attitude when I come in tomorrow for round 2. **6/3/07 Edit -Malt Vanilla is not a regular flavor! =( -Honey Lavender has an acquired taste. -Creme Fraiche is sour but good. -Butter Pecan is even better. -Salted Caramel--I only got a taste but now that I believe the hype is true, I'm gonna have to go back and get 2 scoops. It tastes like toffee, and toffee is the shit!

I'm a lucky bastard. I live just a few blocks away from Bi-Rite and have the devilishly good advantage of coming here after early Sunday brunches, thereby beating the crowd and completing my Sunday meal. I came for the first time last Sunday--perfect weather to eat a cone in Dolores Park! I tried the Toasted Banana and Lavender Honey... OMG, yum! I haven't had fantastic home-made ice cream since my days in Pittsburgh, and their flavors are rich but not overpowering, and most importantly... simple! They made for the perfect Sunday. At $2.25 for a "single scoop" (two mounds of cream, i.e. two tasty options), it's plenty of high quality ice cream at about the same prices I remember paying for commercial places like Baskin Robbins. With a stamp card and appetite in hand, I am a return customer, guaranteed.

I can't go to Dolores park without being tempted by the Bi-Rite Creamery. ÊSooooooooo good. You can sample loads of flavours, and I normally do (heh) but I always end up getting the same combination, because it's just sooo damn tasty. Ê The salted caramel and the ricanelas with bits of snickerdoodle are simply delicious. The creme fraiche is also yummy, and the coffee toffee....and pretty much all of them! Go get an ice cream and sit in the park (and then jog around it 20 times, as that ice cream sure is creamy!) :) But be warned, if you go on a warm day, expect a line that goes right round the block!

Bi-Rite Creamery gives you a reason to say, "Check please after you meal" so you can shoot over to 18th for dessert! ÊIt's a creative creamery that serves samples with silver spoons! ÊI sampled about 6 of their flavors, including salted caramel, roasted banana, chocolate chai, coffee toffee, vanilla and butter pecan. ÊYou don't get overpowered by the cream like other spots and you can actually taste the ingredients. ÊHefty servings and they accept credit card transactions over $10. ÊIf you are a light eater, share the sundae because you will waste your money by throwing the other half in the garbage.

I've sworn off sweets except for special occasions, but my defenses totally went down when my 14-year-old niece asked where we could get some ice cream on a warm (by SF standards) night...and she offered to buy (what a little sweetie, eh?).

In fact, I can't even remember what the others we had were...oh yeah: the Coffee Toffee was good too.

Who cares that my body physical rebels when I indulge in ice cream? This is worth a night of intestinal punishment! But enough about me, on to the creamery! Service: It was great! Even though there were a few people milling about inside, the staff was very helpful and patient while letting people sample as many flavors as they wanted. Very important for us indecisive people. Flavors: Tried the Salted Caramel and was sold. I tried the Toffee Coffee, but it was a little too strong in the coffee flavor... and I do love my coffee. Space: I only wish there was a little more space inside to hang out. Unfortunately, they only have 3 little stools and not much space to mill about. Be prepared to take your ice cream to go, or sit outside on one of the cute benches built around the trees. Can't wait to go back and try some more goodies!

In the constant struggle between who's got the better ice cream, Mitchell's or Bi-Rite, I have to say the edge goes to Bi-Rite. I just find the flavors more enticing to my palate. I appreciate the care they take to provide an ice cream that has local, sustainable, and organic ingredients that shine in each flavor. My favorite is the Balsamic Strawberry, which has the slight tang from the balsamic and the strawberries used are fresh and sweet. I've also sampled the ever-popular Salted Caramel, which pops with caramel. Sometimes caramel can have that burnt taste to it but this was made perfectly and the salt heightens every sense on the tongue. The Roasted Banana is also a hit with me. It tastes more of like a sorbet to me rather than an ice cream because the banana flavor is so incredibly intense. Sam's Sundae is a unique amalgamation of ingredients. Who would have thought to put chocolate ice cream, olive oil, sea salt, and whipped cream into a dessert? On a recent visit, I had to try it and see what all the fuss is about. I gotta say it was unusual though. The Bergamot olive oil had a fruity, almost floral taste to it. The chocolate was some of the best chocolate ice cream I've had. The flakes of Maldon sea salt are not distributed throughout so in one bite you can have too much salt whereas in another you can have just a bit of it. Trust me, this ice cream is worth standing in a long ass line in the bitter SF cold for.

Best Sundae's I've ever had: BROWNIE SUNDAE 5/5 - Most brownie sundae's focus on the gooeyness of the heavy brownie and the warmth of the fudge. This baby hinges on the creaminess of it's Bi-Rite Vanilla, the sweetness (but not too sweet) of the caramel and fudge, and a crunch coming from the brownie and toasted nuts. The end result is a lighter than normal brownie sundae that doesn't leave you in a coma and makes you wanna slap the chef. SAM's SUNDAE 4.5/5 - Chocolate Ice Cream, OLIVE OIL and SALT?!! ÊChocolate ice cream is chocolate ice cream: chocolate, cold, icee, smooth. This sundae brings a salty component and an oily, rich, lukewarm and slightly olivey component that makes this sundae much more than just chocolate ice cream. It's a complex, must try it once in your life or more creation that leaves you gossiping to your friends, "Hey, have you ever tried chocolate ice cream with olive oil and salt? I have." That conveys to them that you're a FOODIE, meaning you've gone far beyond the common Dreyer's Chocolate for your chocolate fix; you go for Sam's Sundae.

How many people do you know who don't like ice-cream? Two? Freaks! Well, I am one of those people who'd rather have a meatloaf than ice-cream. Fro-Yo would be the closest I have ever come to ice-cream. No more! This place changed my opinion of ice-cream even Cherry Garcia couldn't. Delicious flavors! I spent close to 10 minutes narrowing down the flavors I wanted to try. Having three flavors in my mind (Honey Lavender, Toasted Coconut, and Crme Fraiche), I spent another 10 minutes deciding which one I really wanted. So after this agonizing struggle, I chose Balsamic Strawberry. I could have never been more right in my life! Ok, maybe only when I decided to move to San Francisco... Balsamic Strawberry is the mix of tangy taste of balsamic vinegar and sweet strawberries stirred into vanilla ice-cream. Divine. You Scream, I Scream!

Our dear friend managed to lower our expectation by shrugging his shoulders and nonchalantly described Bi-Rite as "alright" when we made a proposal to stop by for some ice cream after Cha-Ya super healthy dinner. Ê "Oh." ÊWe were disappointed and confused because there are always a gazillion people outside whenever we drive by. And then our friend proceeds to find parking right in front of the front door around 10pm on a Friday evening. ÊSo we had to go in and give it a try. ÊMy fiance got Orange Cardamon and some sort of vanilla. ÊI wasn't paying much attention to what they got because I was busy charmed by the cute shop. ÊPeople continuously flooded into this small place you coulda swore it's 80 degrees out. ÊUnfortunately it's more like 50 and thus the cute benches around the trees outside were totally wasted. Ê Our friend got salted caramel. ÊAnd yes, he claims Bi-Rite is only "alright." ÊBut yes, he inhaled that whole thing in 2 minutes and talked about how good it is. Ê Oh well, aren't we all a little contradictory in life at times? I tasted the orange cardamon and that some-sort-of-vanilla ice cream. ÊIt's good. ÊAnd interesting. ÊAnd made us discuss what cardamon really is for a while. ÊSo in case you are wondering too, here is what they say in Wikipedia: [Cardamons] are used as flavorings in both food and drink...(boring Wiki details)...Cardamom has a strong, unique taste, with an intensely aromatic fragrance. ÊBlack cardamom has a distinctly more astringent aroma, though not bitter, with a coolness similar to mint, though with a different aroma...(more boring Wiki details)...It is one of the most expensive spices by weight, and little is needed to impart the flavor....(Ooh, here is an interesting fact): It is broadly used to treat infections in teeth and gums, to prevent and treat throat troubles, congestion of the lungs and pulmonary tuberculosis, inflammation of eyelids and also digestive disorders. Well, I thought it tasted like lemon.

"Tootally rad dude" - Kathy S. , Yelper Thank you random person sitting next to me @ Isobune Sushi today for suggesting this place. No regrets here! I swear the rumor is 30 minute wait but it really felt more like only 20 minutes and either way I'd wait up to 45 minutes for this delicacy! I first tasted the lavender (they let you taste) and it was too much for my palate so I ordered the double half cinnamon, half salted caramel. It was so fresh and flavorful each bite brought me closer to the meaning of life. I saw little elves marching around with balloons after the first bite, then confetti floating around me after the second bite. I swear I saw a Unicorn walk right by me by the 3rd bite and then I was somewhere in heaven by the 4th... Just got better and better.. it had a consistency somewhere between hard and soft ice cream and was somewhat like cookie dough.. It was an experience that I savored whilst seated on one of their benches outside. PS- Across the street is a grocery also named Bi-Rite and they sell the ice cream there all the way at the back in the freezer section. There is a lot of hype there too as people are grabbing their favorite flavors and paring them with crackers and whatnot.. but I didn't really see a line.

Sam's sundae, two scoops of chocolate ice cream drizzled with Bergamot olive oil sprinkled with Maldon sea salt, sounds interesting? Well sure it does sound odd but then again it makes sense. you have rich ice cream and to compliment it with a fruity citrus olive oil. then the sprinkles of Maldon sea salt to give it a contrast in flavor that just jumps out at you. So all of this should have given it a 5 stars right? blame it on the great food i had right before i came here or the ice cream parlor across the bay. More so i rather blame that the olive oil was lost as the salt overwhelmed my taste buds in this sundae. What ultimately got it only 4 stars is that i can take the sea salt and do it myself at home and get very similar results.

Yes, there's a cult following of this place...and for reason. We had the Ricanelas (cinnamon w/ snickerdoodles). I would have preferred more cinnamon or something funky w/ the snickerdoodle flavor. Not bad, but I've had better Bi-Rite flavors. 2nd flavor of the dish: Brown Butter Pecan - music to this (partly) Southern girl's ears! It was almost better than the pie in my opinion. Next time I'm going for the soft serve as that counter also had interesting flavors (& not 1/2 as many people waiting in line). Definitely a "scene" here.

I can simply sum up this review into two words: SALTED CARAMEL. It's a very creamy, caramel ice cream with just the right hint of saltiness, unlike the Vinegar Caramel at Humphry Slocombe which tastes way too salty after a few bites. The texture of this BiRite staple seems to be much creamier than any of their other flavors, and is actually close to gelato. I've also had the balsamic strawberry, and the roasted banana. Both were good, but nothing beats that salted caramel!

Seriously, a 15 person line at 9:30 on a Monday night? ÊSeriously??? ÊIt's not even summer yet guys!! I had to see what all the fuss was about, and I did. ÊAnd now I know - The MALT VANILLA W/PEANUT BRITTLE is the bomb. ÊLike I mean, the super creamy, crunchy Êsweetness, honest-to-goodness bomb. Ê The COFFEE TOFFEE was good, but not to-die-for fantastic. ÊIf this were a video game, I'd go back to my save point and order 2 scoops of malt vanilla w/peanut brittle.

Pick your poison: Cream or Butter? The ice cream, smooth like buttah, made from cream. The cupcakes, frosting so creamy, most certainly butter. Like a sugar-laced, supple, buttery bosom you want to bury your face in. Yes, just like that. You wait in line for ice cream and you probably never even considered getting anything but the cold stuff. But wait, there's more. When it's not blistering hot out, get your cake and eat it too. Warm spice: think pumpkin pie transformed into a delicate crumb. Salted Caramel: and you thought the ice cream was good, OMG! This takes the cake. It's both frosted and filled with sweet-salty-buttery love. Your arteries may hate you but your sensory organs will love you forever.

With over 2600 reviews, I still feel obligated to write a review on Bi-Rite Creamery to spread the word of deliciousness. Their ice cream is so creamy and dense, the unique flavors that they offer add to the amazing-ness of this establishment. The guy working was nice enough to let us sample almost every single flavor they had. He's so friendly, I think my boyfriend fell in love with him. We had the malted vanilla, salted caramel, honey lavender, and the cherry one. Even though it was slightly chilly outside, we gobbled it up as if we were burning in summer heat. The malted vanilla was so good that we went back to order another scoop. On our way driving back to San Diego, James and I were reminiscing about how good Bi-Rite's ice cream is. When I visit San Francisco again, know that I am merely going there for Bi-Rite creamery.

Because I love ice cream I would have given this place 5 stars. Because I don't like ridiculously loud music and getting my order wrong twice due to no one being able to hear a thing over the silly loud music I am detracting one of those stars. But this is NOT a negative review. The ice cream is delicious. Fully freaking yumtastic. The flavors are just out of the box enough to make every single one crave-able, without any fear of wanting to spit it out. They have a lovely balance of creative spins on old favorites and I'd definitely recommend stopping by!

Organic? I'm SO there. Never would have thought that these quirky flavors would taste so amazing together. I got the salted caramel & shoot, my brain just farted and I'm forgetting my other flavor. But it's okay. Because the salted caramel, the honey lavender, strawberry balsamic and white chocolate blackberry swirl are enough to make up for that flavor I forgot. Must try! And don't be intimidated by the line...moves by pretty quickly.

Sorry, Yelp, you've let me down. ÊYelp, I take your ratings pretty seriously, and this time you were just plain wrong. ÊTHIS is your idea of a 5-star ice cream place??? I couldn't wait to try Bi-Rite after hearing that it may just be the best ice cream place in California. ÊHaving high expectations often sets one up for disappointment. ÊPerhaps, that's the lesson here, kids. My friend and stopped by Bi-Rite last night. ÊDolores Park was jumpin', and 4 cop cars were driving around in circles, so . . . no funny stuff. ÊWe found an awesome parking spot right on the corner of 18th and Dolores and crossed the street. It was a hot day in the City, and yet there were only 4 people in line at Bi-Rite. Ê"That's strange," I thought, remembering my last visit to Mitchell's, highlighted by a 32-minute wait. I ordered two scoops in a compostable, biodegradable cup. ÊFrankly, I would have preferred a waffle cup/bowl which would have been even more biodegradable in my tummy. ÊI opted for a scoop of roasted banana and a scoop of cookies 'n' cream for $4.75, topped with chocolate shortcake for an additional 75 cents. Ê The topping was good, and there was a lot of it; so much that they couldn't fit it all in. ÊThey even gave me a tiny cup with a few more pieces of the chocolate shortcake which tasted like a truffle brownie. ÊMmmm, truffle brownie. ÊThe ice cream itself, however, was not very good. ÊMealy and watery, it was kind of disappointing. ÊCookies 'n' cream flavor was very pedestrian, and the roasted banana lacked banana flavor, believe it or not. One word about the Bi-Rite employees: there's something weird about them. ÊThey seem genuinely happy. ÊI mean, really, reeeeeally happy. ÊI am talking HAPPY. ÊHappy like a 16-year-old boy on Prozac who just scored a touchdown to win State, found $100 on the street, received a Playstation 3 as a gift from his parents, and finally got to second with his girlfriend. Ê In my humble opinion, Mitchell's is still the best ice cream in San Francisco. ÊThey have long lines, no benches outside and no compostable anything. ÊAll they have is tasty ice cream, which isn't so bad in my book.

I've been sitting on this review for three weeks. Just like something that's perfect, it's a daunting task to try and explain my love for Bi-Rite. But after not eating it for over a week (the longest I've strayed away this entire summer), I feel enough distance to look at this place objectively, with reason, and with a hindsight. Kind of like a break up allows you to see things you didn't see before, but Bi-Rite is a place I will keep coming back to...probably in the next few days. My relationship with Bi-Rite Creamery: We met one faithful day, when I decided to check out the hype. Went for the riconelas, was mildly impressed. Real nice cinnamon tastes with bits of snickerdoodle, one my favorite kind of cookies. Over the next several visits, I started to acquaint myself with the different flavors through tasting with their silverware spoons. For awhile, I ordered a single balsamic strawberry as a safe bet, before I decided to jump into more adventurous tastes. My breakthrough moment was the honey lavender. Light, refreshing, and definitely unique. The cool taste of lavender lingered in my mouth moments after I scarfed it down. I became a huge fan of their strawberry-cherry sorbet, still unmatched by their other variations (such as peach-ginger, peach-cantalope etc). Coffee toffee was another favorite, with specks of Ritual coffee and oh-so-satisfying toffee bits. I've made it a point to share this spot with all my loved ones, whether it's my parents who are visiting from out-of-town or with my friends after dinner. Strangers too: I picked up a French tourist and gave him a tour of the Mission, which ended with us sitting at Dolores Park with our single cups of Bi-Rite. This little ice cream shop holds a sweet spot in my heart--there's nothing more satisfying than grabbing dessert and sitting down on those wooden benches with my favorite people.

AME-MAZING!! Not one other person in the shop on a sunny Sunday. Cute interior with thoughtful touches of decor. Asked lots of questions and got the insider scoop. Tasted Pumpkin (OK- good flavor), Salted Caramel, and Honey Lavender. Choose to buy a half and half scoop of Salted Caramel and Honey Lavender... best versions of those two flavors I have had! A half scoop seemed small, but the deep flavor of the ice cream made it filling. FYI's * Someone in Seattle opened almost the exact same shop as Bi Rite- with the same flavors... BUT her ice creams taste does not compare to Bi Rite- the Seattle copycat can't get the flavors from being too strong or too lackluster in the unique combinations * Biodegradable cups with small wooden stick/spoons * Moderate prices that match the quality

If this place respected its clientele enough to move to a place big enough to accomodate its fans, instead of cultivating its cult-like status by making us stand out in a line stretching halfway to the Pacific Ocean, I'd give it the 5th star it probably deserves if taste and selection were the only criteria. Look, the salted caramel and roasted banana flavors are two of the finest things I've ever had in my mouth, and this is coming from somebody who is intimately devoted to what may be the best ice cream ever concocted, Graeter's Black Raspberry Chip from Cincinnati. It's just too bad that one has to miss out on it so often because the line is just too formidable.

If you live in SF and haven't heard of Bi-Rite, you've probably been living in a cave, as it's developed a cult following! Pros: "Unique" Ice Cream Flavors Cons: Ice Cream Flavors aren't unique enough! The standout flavors of the night were Brown Sugar and Honey Lavender. Runner-ups would be Salted Caramel and Pumpkin. Unfortunately, they didn't have Balsamic Strawberry or Earl Grey this time, so I didn't get to try those. My main gripe with Bi-Rite is that there aren't enough flavors that are "out there." The majority of the flavors were rather bland and uninteresting (ie: chocolate, vanilla, etc.). I'd like to see more creativity in their selection...just take a look at Humphrey Slocombe in SF or Scoops in LA. With that being said, Bi-Rite is still one of those quintessential checklist experiences that every San Franciscan should try at least once. Check! ...now, what's next?

ÊMy jaw just about dropped, but I went ahead anyway and got a cup of the honey lavender. It was one of the best and most enjoyable cups of ice cream I've ever had. ÊThe honey flavor was very noticeable, with an ever so slight aftertaste of lavender. ÊThe flavors complemented each other quite well. All the other flavors looked delicious too, especially the roasted banana!

Came here after finding out Humphrey Slocombe ran out of most of thier flavors! Since we had kids in our group, I'm glad we ended up here because Bi-Rite is definately more flavor friendly to kids than Humphrey Slocombe is. Ê When we arrived, the line was long but it moved pretty smoothly. ÊI don't remember it being this crowded when I first came here a couple of years ago. They also have a seating area inside, which all ten of us were lucky to take over! Ê My flavor choices were Salted Caramel and Roasted Banana - Oooh my, they were BOTH sooo good. Not only are they individually good...they're even better together! ÊThe kids were a big fan of the cookies & cream flavor. I gotta try that (and more) next time around! PS. Be sure to get a frequent flyer card! FYI: Parking can be very challenging in the Mission district due to Dolores park and many other good eats around the area.

I was warned that the ice cream was really rich because I'm lactose intolerant. But I am lactose intolerant with an affinity for ice cream. =) I had the salted caramel and it was a bit too buttery for my taste. I also had a scoop of the toasted coconut. Now that was YUMMY! I had a taste of my friend's apple pie ice cream and it was like an apple pie a la mode. I should have ordered that one! I didn't like the lavender flavor and the ginger flavor was overpowering. Even though the ice cream was a little too rich for me that I ended up feeling sick, it was worth the pain in the end. Their ice cream is organic and the cones are organic too. WOW! Overall, it was cool but my heart still belongs to Thrifty/Rite Aid ice cream. Coconut pineapple and chocolate malted crunch will always top my list.

Sam's Sundae= A++ :) Salted Caramel= B+ Ricanelas= A+ (the pieces of snickledoodle make me go to a happy place. lol.) _______________ My friend and I went to Bi-Rite on a Friday and it was an absolute gorgeous sunny day in SF!

I timed it, (so I can report back to my fellow yelpers) and it took about 25 mins for us to order. The time goes by quickly. HINT: 'People watching' is always entertaining in SF. It's also fun to watch people's parallel parking skills (or lack thereof.) My friend and I saw this one car almost knock over the Bi-Rite menu outside. Oh boy! And now on to the the ice cream... Mmm... Sam's Sundae lives up to "The Best Thing I Ever Ate" Food Network Hype! For the adventurous eaters out there... You gotta try it! ÊIt's two scoops of Chocolate ice cream topped with organic bergamot olive oil and maldon sea salt, with hand-whipped whipped cream on the side. Serious yumness. Oh and let me tell you, the customer service here gets an A+. ÊThe girl that was helping me was super nice. ÊShe got a little excited when I asked to sample Salted Caramel. And even more excited when I asked to sample the Ricanelas. She said, "Good choice, It's the staff favorite." Ê P.S. The Snickerdoodle Ice Cream a.k.a. Ricanelas is SO delicious. If you are a fan of the snickerdoodle cookie, you HAVE to try it.

In an effort to avoid the lamentably long line of sugar deprived Mission hipsters in this unbearable Indian summer heat, my bf and I opted for the shorter [practically nonexistent in comparison] Bi-Rite soft serve line over the usual assortment of magically titillating ice cream flavors. Due to our unwillingness to wait, we made the most disenchanting snafu that has managed to thwart my unvarying passion for Bi-Rite. Yes, the impossible has finally happened. We ordered their special concoction, listed as a "must try" on their handwritten daily board: Vanilla soft serve with blood orange olive oil and a dash of sea salt. The result was a bland and overly sweetened Vanilla soft serve, reminiscent of McDonald's $1 version yet far more pricier in comparison, drizzled far too heavily with blood orange infused olive oil [pretentious much?] with a colossal amount of sea salt sprinkled on top. Bi-Rite, you've pulled a Humphrey Slocombe. Shame on you.

My favorites (flavors do come and go though) - Salted Caramel - omg - if you love caramel... love love love. my personal favorite. - Earl Grey - i have an obsession with earl grey that started circa me living in london for 6 months. but regardless, it has a nice tea flavor that is light and refreshing - malted vanilla - creme fraiche Ê - Ricanellas - I'm not 100% sure whats in it. but i know it has like cinnamon in it somewhere... - Honey Lavender (i think...) - not my fave bec it kinda tastes like soap. Anyways, the texture is thick and creamy - YUM. I always get a single cup with 2 flavors (1 scoop each) ! ! ! I've compared this place to that place in berkeley icee - I think bi-rite is better =p

One of the better ice cream places in SF. ÊThey've got a revolving menu with pretty unique flavors such as Creme Fraiche (which is slightly tangy) and Basil (which is surprisingly really good). ÊMy favorites are the Salted Caramel and Roasted Banana.

Thank God I do not live close by to this place.. I'd end up being one tub of lard. The best of the best ice cream. ÊI've never had anything better than Bi-Rite Creamery. ÊI've told all my friends that this is a must, and it never disappoints. Some of the flavors are a bit foreign, Honey Lavender, Soy Chocolate, Roasted Banana, Salted Caramel, and etc.. but they never fail. ÊEVERYTHING is good. ÊI love how they don't mind you to test out flavors. ÊThey actually give a good sample size and encourage you to try more.. one of everything please.

I've lived in the city for almost 2 years now, and have never tried this delicious heaven of a place. All I really NEED to say is, "SALTED CARAMEL ICE CREAM." I just am in love with it. (my mouth is watering now just thinking about it.) It was a chilly evening but I was in an ice cream kind of mood. The line wasn't too long, but I have heard that it can be out the door and up the block. All the flavors seemed pretty interesting like "Blood Orange" and another one with Lavender in it. I went straight for the salted caramel and enjoyed EVERY last bite. This is a must if you are an ice cream lover. So salty, so sweet, so caramel-y. =) The prices were good too for the amount you get. They really pack your cup. Next time I'm going to try two flavors, but one was enough for my first time.

Bi rite if you want to impress me, get the lines moving faster at both the store and the creamery. Also, a pre-packed pint of ice cream should not cost $7.99. Ê@ $64 a gallon I expect more than just cream and sugar.

After a couple hours relaxing at Dolores Park, walked over to Bi-rite to get some sweet treats. The girls at the counter were super friendly and didn't judge you when asked to try 28374 flavors because you are super indecisive. I really appreciated their interesting & intense flavor combinations. After much deliberation, settled on a single scoop with two flavors: honey lavender & burnt butter caramel swirl. $3.25 for 4 oz of sugary happiness? Yes, please! Bottom line: Can I please just move to Mission??

Put me in the ranks of Bi-Rite crazy San Franciscans. Sure Mitchell's has more variety, sure you have to wait less at Maggie Mudd, sure Bombay Creamery has all those great Indian flavors, but Bi-Rite Creamery occupies a special place in my heart. It's the combination of excellent ice-cream, perfect location (take your frozen heaven and enjoy it while lying on the grass in Dolores Park) and environmental consciousness (compostable cups, spoons and cartons and an effort to use local and organic ingredients). The staff are super-nice as well. I remember rushing to Bi-Rite after dinner with a big and slightly loony group of friends, only to find the creamery closed and the staff cleaning up. Deprived of our dessert fix, we stood outside the glass door making sad faces at the staff. They good-naturedly let us in to pick up a couple of pints. Salted Caramel and Honey Lavender ice-creams were the perfect ending to the evening.

Ok, it's no Mitchell's, but it'll do. A shop that made me stray from normal order of mint chocolate chip. Something just said to me, "try the chai milk chocolate". "And the cookies and cream..." Although the roasted banana was making me salivate as well, I regretfully declined its siren song. As my friend and I perused the list of flavors that day, honey lavender was tempting, but something so exotic, perfumed and yet dairy-filled could go horribly awry. I decided to step away. I got my single scoop to go and sat out in the sun. After an afternoon field gazing in Dolores Park, it was the perfectly timed next step. Sure there's a wait, but all good things come...blah blah blah.

After stuffing ourselves with the starchy delights Êat Charanga ranging from the common potato gratin to the fried Yucca pieces accompanied with their wonderful aioli, topped off with a cup of their sweet strong sangria, we decided to take a short jaunt to Bi-Rite for a smooth finish to our rainy yet Êfun social gathering. Located on a pretty quiet street up from Delfina, the line was out the door. ÊBut this was not a line of tourists, but rather locals from the Dolores area. Ê Different concoctions of ice cream reign supreme here, with true flavors of peanut butter, lavender honey infused secrets, and rocky road chock full of almonds and marshmallows....this is the real deal. ÊI opted for the old stand-by white chocolate raspberry and a scoop of the lavender honey. ÊThe white chocolate raspberry was exactly as it sounds: creamy, with the right amount of raspberry ribbons to deliver the fruity punch within a vanilla smorgasbord. ÊThe lavender honey treat was light with the floral notes, and toned down with the sweet tendering of pure honey. ÊI was in heaven. Around $4 for two scoops and I finished every single wooden spoonful while standing there in the store sharing in funny conversations with my dear friends. Try their other flavors as well: burnt caramel, olive oil, and the granitas.

Bi-Rite Creamery....mmm creamy goodness. This is a walk away from Dolores Park, so if you plan on hanging out there on a hot day, I suggest- no no, I demand- that you stop by the Bi-Rite Creamy Goodness Creamery and get some Creamy Delights. I love the little ice cream/cookie sandwiches they have. So good... It's a tiny place, but they have a bold combination of flavors. Soy Chocolate, Ginger among some of them.

GREAT ICE CREAM! There was a huge line on a Tuesday Ênight, but had really good toasted coconut ice cream. ÊThe coffee toffee, was a little too toffee for me. But the real reason I had to write about my experience was that the guy behind the counter was a little, well, "unhappy" and he was barking at the customers: "No more samples after you - this is all the ice cream I have and a thousand people behind you." and the line of the night, after all the barking: "I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU WRITE ON YELP, WE'LL STILL BE HERE IN 30 YEARS" Well, at least he's acknowledging the power of yelp!

Soooo yummy! The first time I went a little past 9pm on a weeknight and there were about 10 people out the door. (20 people total in line). I heard someone say this was a very short line, and I believe them. The ice cream here is so good, how could there not be a long line? Since that first time, I've been multiple times, taking a new friend whenever possible. The servers are very friendly, and you feel welcomed to try 2+ flavors without feeling rushed or bothersome. All of their flavors are so delicious: salted caramel, toasted banana, honey lavender, balsamic strawberry, white chocolate with raspberry swirls, etc! ÊI really liked that the flavors and menus were handwritten-- It all really goes well with the homemade ice cream/local ingredients they use. I absolutely loved their creme fraiche flavor, which I very rarely see as a flavor. How amaaazing it was! It had the perfect creme fraiche flavor without the sourness of real creme fraiche. Their meyer lemon is truly good enough to write home about. It tastes like a lemon cake. It's a must-try in my mind. I always have the kids size, which was $2.25. The perfect size when you just want the same size scoop as you would serve yourself at home. The small, at $3.25, allows you to choose 2 flavors. Their ice cream cakes are truly divine as well (~$30). I had never had "gourmet" ice cream cake, but I don't think I'll ever go back to the regular stuff.

4 stars for the creative flavor ice cream that actually taste good! The only thing I dislike is how sweet it is... It is definitely a lot sweeter than a normal dryers ice cream. Salted caramel - this one surprised me. The flavor was quite good! Who would have thought salt and caramel. It would be perfect but it's just too sweet for my taste. Great to try. Malted vanilla with peanut brittle - this one is my favorite here so far. It isn't as sweet as the salted caramel, but still a tad too sweet. I love the malty flavor and the crunch from the peanut brittle. Honey lavender - this one just isn't my cup of tea. I hated the lavender taste. It tasted like I was eating perfume flavored ice cream. Portions are ok. The junior size is good enough for me. Price is pricier than any other regular ice cream place, but then again this place don't serve regular ice cream.

While watching The Best Thing I Ever Ate: Sugar Rush on Food Network, they talked about Bi-Rite Creamery's Sam's Special. I knew I had to give this place a try the next time I was in the SF area. Fortunately, I had such an opportunity when I went to visit my brothers a few weeks ago. I must say that I was rather impressed with their ice cream. For awhile, I thought that Mitchell's Ice Cream was the best of the best and could not be matched. Well, I stand corrected, Mitchell's certainly has some stiff competition from Bi-Rite Creamery. What truly makes Bi-Rite Creamery stand out from the rest are their unique flavor combinations. They do an excellent job at blending sweet and savory flavors together. For example, flavors such as balsamic strawberry & salted caramel, which we normally assume would taste odd, in fact are some of their best flavors. Other flavors worth noting are the honey lavender, coffee toffee and brown butter pecan. If you are in an adventurous mood try the Sam's Special. The chocolate ice cream with bergamot olive oil (fruity flavor) and maldon sea salt all pair extremely well with each another. Final Thoughts Bi-Rite Creamery's ice cream offers a great balance of flavors and texture from the very first bite to the last spoonful.

After lunch at Tartine, my friends and I walked over to Bi-Rite for some ice cream. ÊLucky for us there was a line so we had time to digest. ÊI got the Balsamic Strawberry and the Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl. ÊThe brown sugar was a bit sweet. ÊYes, I know it's brown sugar, sugar is sweet... Êbut compared to the Balsamic Strawberry, it was just a tad overboard for me. ÊHowever, combined it was soOo good I really didn't want to share. My only gripe... ÊI got two single scoops which cost me $4... Êhowever my single scoops really looked like kiddie sizes. ÊI think they need to get some girls with more arm muscle to really dig into those ice cream cause even though it's gourmet and delicious, I can't help but feel a tiny bit jipped. ÊYah I know, it's not Scoops in LA... but dangit... I really thought they gave me kiddie sizes!!

I've pretty much tried all the flavors here as they are pretty generous with the samples.. My two favorites were the Salted Caramel and the Roasted Banana. Salted Caramels in real life are generally fuckin amazing and to have it in ice cream form pretty much answers all my prayers and hopes in life. So in summation: They can salt my caramels and roast my banana anytime they want to. Bi-Rite Creamery FTW!

ÊI ended getting a double with three flavors: Ê Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl, Salted Caramel, and Vanilla Malt with Peanut Brittle and Chocolate Pieces.

We hit Bi-Rite fifth in the Ice Cream Walk of the Damned. ÊI came off with a better impression than previous visits, probably because I sampled more flavors and avoided ordering a whole cone based on the novelty of the name. Ice Cream Texture : 4/5. ÊVaries between flavors - Brown Butter Pecan was delicious and creamy while Cinnamon was harsh. Flavor Variety : 4/5. ÊLots of interesting flavors, but still a fair number that fall flat on my tastebuds (Balsamic, Snickerdoodle). ÊNot as experimental as Humphy Slocumbe but fewer crazy bombs. Customers : Dolores Park regulars, foodies from everywhere Strengths : ÊGood selection of novel yet tasty flavors Cons: Lineup, buskers, salivating regulars

Hands down my favorite flavor is SALTED CARAMEL! A must try! Majority of their other flavors are delicious and very unique as well, and they change every day. All of their ice cream is homemade, creamy, and the perfect temperature and texture. Even "normal" sounding flavors like balsamic strawberry are orgasmic. A little on the pricey side, but you get exactly what you pay for! Sample a few flavors and take a pint or two (or five) home. TIP: No need to line up if you're only purchasing pre-packed ice cream. Simple grab it from the fridge and go straight to the register. The line always looks long but it goes by faster than you think. Workers are extremely efficient and friendly. Another plus: they open til 10 or 11pm! But don't get your hopes up...there's usually still a line regardless of the time of day, weather, natural disasters, economy, you name it.

"I wish I were sitting in Dolores Park right now eating a Bi-Rite Creamery cone," I keep saying to my boyfriend now that we're back in Atlanta. When we hit up this Mission hot spot, the line was out the door, wrapped around the sidewalk. All the flavors looked enticing, but the wait gave me enough time to decide on two scoops to pack into my cone: honey lavender and salted caramel. Despite my usual distaste of lavender flavoring in my beverages or food, I loved its faintness in my heavenly scoop. The salted caramel tasted like a graham cracker. I kind of wish I had tried the balsamic strawberry instead. I also found the bathroom key charming: one of the staff members brought it to me attached to a whisk. I tried to eat a bowl of Mayfield yesterday and accidentally screamed Bi-Rite's name instead. Now I can never eat inferior ice cream again!

I came here on a random hot hot day and I was in the mission and thought about this place and wanted to go there asap for their ice cream!! When I got there, I think the elementary school nearby just got out because every little kid was their with their mamas. I thought it was cute and people had their bikes and doggies too! Anyways the line was not that long and I really really wanted to try their Earl Grey Tea but they didn't have it that day!! But I got a total of 3 flavors! The salted caramel, balsamic strawberry, and honey lavender. Everyone raved about the Salted Caramel so i had to get it! IT was the BEST out of everything else! As for the Strawberry Balsamic, I liked that I could totally taste the vinegar in there, but it was sweetened enough to taste good! And the honey lavender wasn't anything special, it always tasted like lotion but I still have love for it! Next time I will come back for Earl Grey and more Salted Caramel! But I was kinda disappointed that their scoops were kind of SMALL I wanted more bigger scoops ):

Passing by here the other day I saw a little girl slathered with sticky chocolate ice cream. ÊI think she missed a spot on her forehead. ÊMom nor herself bothered to wipe off the mess, knowing full well another blob would paint her chin in a matter of seconds. Ê We passed the creamery and headed to its sister shop, the Bi-Rite Market.

I am not your normal ice cream fan. I was vegan for four and a half years until recently and lets just say I am sensitive ice cream. This quality ice cream however left me feeling good all around after consumption. My taste buds were very pleased too. I chose salted caramel - since those flavors are so flirtatious and honey lavender ice cream since that flavor is so "me". I have only been here once and I crave it many times over. Maybe I will go back tonight. There is most often a line. Not too much room to eat inside but even on cold nights you will see people eating ice cream outside b/c its that good.

Awesomeness in a cup (or cone). Tried the salted caramel and apple pie - deliciously smooth caramel with a hint of salt, and crumbly and cool apple pie. So yummy. Both those were just the samples! I actually had a single of mint chip and cookies and cream. So rich, creamy, and full of chocolate flakes and large cookie chunks. I was amazed at how good the ice cream was. The mint even had a hint of herbal mint (the real deal, not fake artificial mint). Not much standing room, but very very good, and worth the trek.

There's no better way to enjoy a beautiful sunny day in San Francisco than with ice cream from Bi-Rite. ÊThe lines are long, but It's definitely worth it.

Finally got a chance to come back last night to give it another try. It was pretty cold/windy but there was still a line out the door when a friend and I got there! We didn't have to wait long and it gave us some time to decide what flavors we wanted to try. I didn't want to sample too many so I settled on the balsamic strawberry and their infamous salted caramel of course. The balsamic strawberry was much more pleasant than I thought it would be...it tasted mostly of fresh strawberries with a hint of balsamic. I would definitely come back to order this flavor. But I was determined to get the salted caramel this time around and it was absolutely fantastic! Not too sweet with the perfect notes of saltiness...it was heaven in my mouth. I LOVE caramel and it totally reminded me of the Werther's hard candies in ice cream form! I got the kid's size on a cone (you get more than in a cup) for $2.25...what a steal!

I don't suppose my review will move their markers much. People will always go, it's a legendary place, etc. Of course, nothing wrong with putting my own two cents in. I've always been known to do so. It's cathartic. We traveled across town to get here, wandered through some hipster areas, and made our way up to the counter. Greeted by fewer flavors than we were expecting, I settled on honey lavender. A home run - nom nom! In a conversation with the friend who sent us to Bi-Rite, she said the honey lavender was the only way to go. She was right. It was fragrant and full of flowery goodness, rather than just the essence ("Having the lavender waved over it," as a friendly old grandmother might say). My manfriend had the brown sugar-caramel-ginger thing and although it performed competently, he found it to be pedestrian for homemade ice cream. A notch above the branded stuff, to be sure, but not worthy of a place with over 2600 Yelp reviews, as of this writing. So if you go, get honey lavender. Can't vouch for anything else, but that's what all the other reviewers are for.

I tried 3 different flavors from a silver spoon before deciding on a single cup serving. Final decision - Butter Pecan The ice-cream is homemade and so are their topping sauces like caramel, which is by the far the best caramel sauce I've had. Great, smiley workers and they offer ice-cream cakes and ice-cream sandwiches. I want to return for some more ICE-CREAM.

Unique, Super-refreshing and Good Location Unique- flavors like honey lavender, orange cardamon, cinnamon with snicker-doodles tingles both curiosity and taste buds. You can sample any ice cream; serving size is variable, the smallest you can still get 1-2 flavors, so if you can't decide what to have, why not have them both? Super-refreshing- okay. The way their flavor dissipates as the cream caresses ever so gently is definitely a plus, however, if you want the complete ice cream experience, just wait a while until it's a bit melted. (not too much though) I recommend walking across the street to Dolores Park. Enjoy the sun a bit while you savor the flavor. I love this ice cream place. All ice cream places should be like this. Well, except maybe they should also have model trains going everywhere. Yeah, that would be the ideal creamery.

After hearing such great things about this place and the famed honey-lavender ice cream, I thought that all the hype would inflate my expectations and leave me disappointed, but oh no no, i was not disappointed. Even on a non-holiday Monday afternoon, there was a line for the place! (Don't you people have to work?!) I got a scoop of the Malted Vanilla, full of goodies like peanut brittle and cookies?, and a scoop of the honey-lavender. Honey-lavender wins. It tasted so unique, so divine, so delicious. Usually, I'm skeptical about lavender flavored things, because the lavender taste is too overwhelming. Not this ice cream. It was perfect; it tasted like lavender but not like I was eating a mouthful of lavender leaves. It was just....good. I want to come back and try more flavors next time. Maybe even a sundae!

I am torn between a 4 and 5 star rating, and as the saying goes, if Yelp allowed half stars.... BUT, I think I am going for four because of the incessant line & cramped nature of the quarters. I guess in this city you have to choose your #1 ice cream and I am going with Mitchell's for it's convenience (read:parking lot) and queuing quality. ÊMy Operations Engineering brother would be so proud. ÊThere don't seem to be as many flavor choices at Bi-Rite as well, and I actually prefer ice cream served ice cream style more than gelato-stizz. ÊActually, Bi-Rite deserves their 4 stars! However, if Mitchell's were to, god forbid, be closed, Bi-Rite would be my next choice in terms of ice cream quality.

Being one of those that "left his heart in San Francisco", every trip back to the city merits an out of the way jaunt to Bi-rite creamery. The organic local ingredients, and biodegradable environmentally conscious staff would attract me anyway... but instead let us focus on what really makes one drive 20 minutes for this local taste of greatness. I'm all for the Brown Butter Pecan, Salted Caramel, Mint Chip, and good old plain Chocolate. But the real reason I stand here Êscooping it up in 40 degree weather is for the Honey Lavender Ice Cream. Another one of the rare dishes that lives up to "yelp hype", this special flavor feels like a scoop of the lightest gelato, and tastes like... well I'm gonna say a "flower"(*1) not because I have a better metaphor, but because my sister used it and I'm stealing it. So yeah... make the trip. If the weather's hot, this will cool you down. If the weather's cold, well your freezing your ass off anyway, so pull out your biodegradable spoons and scoop up some honey lavender ice cream!! ...... Ok my sister is demanding to be credited for the metaphor... and since she did actually pay for the honey lavender goodness... here it is. *1 - Tina S.

This place is absolutely delicious. I cannot believe I waited this long to try the ice-cream here. We came here on an overcast, but humid day . . . not the perfect ice-cream weather, but heck . . . I love me some good ice-cream. I had the coffee toffee and the roasted coconut. I hate drinking coffee, but I like all things coffee-flavored. I'm odd like that, and the coffee ice-cream here was strong, but oh-so-delicious! The coconut was nothing spectacular so I'll probably try another flavor next time. I dabbed into my friend's salted caramel, and it was a little too sweet for me. I'll probably pass on the Honey Lavender as well because everytime I try something lavender flavored, it ends up just tasting like soap in my mouth. This reminds me of The Christmas Story. Christmas Story is good; Lavender in my mouth . . . no bueno.

Decided to wean myself from fro-yo and have actual ice cream. Went with some coworkers to Dolores Park and finally made a stop here. What I liked: -the honey lavender. The name was fruity and sounded like a body wash my gf would get at Body Shop, but this flavor is incredible. Almost tough to describe it, but it's that d*mn good. -the malted vanilla w/peanut brittle; great flavor, brittle almost tasted like a waffle cone. It's that mixture of sweetness and saltiness that makes America great -staff was friendly and gave samples. -I didn't have to suffer the plight of other friends/Yelpers and wait an eternity, I stood in line just under 3 minutes. -and you can't go wrong with a wooden ice cream spoon. Why it didn't get 5 stars: -actual size of the serving, a double for 3.25 is still somewhat small; I know my nephew would go through it in seconds and want more. -definitely bus or take BART, trying to find pkg around here is mayhem. But overall, I felt that Bi-Rite lived up to the hype. I ain't gonna start the whole Bi-Rite/Mitchell's debate, but I will say when out of towners visit, I'd be inclined to take them here as Mitchell's has always been crowded. And fyi, Bi-Rite has a great market just across the street.

Mitchell's ice cream is an old time favorite. ÊI'm been going here for 16 plus years. ÊI love the ice cream here, and while I've tried several ice cream places over the years, nothing really compares to Mitchell's... until now. Sorry Mitchell's, but after 16 years of considering you my #1, I have strayed. ÊPlease forgive me. What really sets Bi-Rite apart from most ice cream places is the oddball selection of off the wall flavors that work... and are quite tasty! ÊI mean who thinks of putting chocolate ice cream with olive oil and sea salt? ÊI was hesitant to try it, but damn... it was good! ÊMy other favorite would have to be the salted caramel.

With nearly 2,000 reviews, I'm not going to sit here and repeat every little thing that makes BiRite Creamery so great. No, I'm not going to sit here and tell you how yummy the balsamic strawberry ice cream sandwiched between two perfectly chewy, yet crispy sugar cookies is OR how, on even the hottest day, their (mixed berry) popsicles help you to stay in Dolores Park a few minutes longer OR how a sam's sundae seems totally weird with olive oil and salt slathered all over it but is one of the most interesting combinations I've ever had OR how, I KID YOU NOT, they make theeeeeee best pumpkin ice cream in the world (I definitely won't tell you I'm mad they only make this during the holidays). No -- I just won't do it -- I won't tell you that the workers totally accomodate my neurotic ways when I insist on standing in front of the freezer (only during non-peak hours!!) asking for a sample of every new flavor and sometimes a flavor I won't be able to fit in my cup that day OR when their freezer broke and I excitedly and unknowingly bought 3 pints (ginger, salted caramel, brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl) and ended up bringing my parents a salty, gingery, sugary soup, they happily exchanged all 3 the next day. No -- ÊI'll save you the trouble and I won't waste my time...but I guess with 2,000 reviews, most of you know it by now anyway. P.S.

I've been wanting to try BiRite ice cream for the LONGEST time. ÊSadly, every time I was free to visit SF, it was a weekend and the lines are always rumored to be out the door, so I never bothered. ÊI was fortunate enough to come here with some friends yesterday evening. ÊMaybe it was the chilly weather, but we got there around 8:15pm. ÊNo line. Got to try 4 different flavors. Salted Caramel is just as good as everyone says it is, but my favorite is the Earl Grey (surprisingly!). ÊI didn't like the honey lavender as much, but I'm not much of a lavender lady. ÊI also tried the malted vanilla w/ peanut brittle and chocolate... That was good too, but not as good as Earl Grey! lol. What I like most about the ice cream here is the texture and flavor which both remind me of a gelato consistency (kind of melty but not too melty and with a clear, distinct flavor). ÊI'd gladly wait in Êline for 10-15 minutes. Otherwise, a pint would do since you don't have to wait in line to purchase one or two or three! A friend bought a pint and noted how the ice cream didn't get rock hard in his freezer and maintained its nice creamy consistency! woo hoo! A few other great things are their paper bowls and wooden tongue-depressor-like spoons!!!!! Eco-friendlyyyyy! We lucked out because after we got our ice cream, a line of about 10 people formed (i'm sure that's probably considered short by the usual standards!) Sigh. I want to get an ice cream cake from here!!!!

You have 1,210 reviews to go through, so I'll keep this short: Bi-Rite Creamery makes the best ice cream in the world. Period. Their secret - they start with Strauss Creamery's (West Marin organic dairy) ice cream blend. So does Three Twins and Scoop. But Bi-Rite's flavors top those other two, which are also stellar.

I've always wanted an ice cream machine in my own home so that I wouldn't need to go else where, however, Bi-Rite is one of those places that you'd hear from everyone and you end up going there for a stroll. After having brunch in the same area, two friends and myself decided to wait in line and grab a scoop or two; really, there was a line for ice cream, just as bizarre as the Abercrombie & Fitch in New York during the summer (where European tourists line up to enter the store, shop, and maybe even take a picture with the shirtless model of the day). In line, I pondered whether to get my two scoops in a cup or a waffle cone; I'm a person that doesn't like to be messy, so cup it was, and another condition was that one of my scoops be vanilla. I ordered their Lavender & Honey in addition to vanilla. When dug into the ice cream, I questioned the slowly melting confection "this taste like vanilla", oh wait, the top scoop was vanilla, and until I got to the bottom, you can really taste the lavender (though it's not overpowering, actually, you'd want more and more of it), the Lavender & Honey is really that good. Shirley got a scoop of salted carmel; such a wonderful collaboration; sea salt pairs well with carmel. Neil got a scoop of malted vanilla with peanuts, he was having trouble eating away at the melting cream "it seems lighter than most ice cream", but overall he said it was good. MMMMMMMMM! Ice Cream, bi-rite is a must try!

I walked by this ice cream joint at about 6pm and it took me a grand total of about 2 seconds to decide if I wanted to ruin my appetite by eating sweets right before dinner. The server was great and allowed us to try almost all the flavors. What's cute is that they let you taste with metal spoons, but you get a wooden tongue-depressor like spoon when you actually make a purchase. I LOVE the honey lavender one. It's tastes like lavender earl grey tea with a spot of honey. I partnered this with a scoop of salted caramel, which went well with the sweetness of the honey lavender. I didn't like the saltiness as much on its own. This place is the ice cream place of choice because they actually offer seasonal ice creams. The one for fall is the brown sugar ginger caramel one - tasty tasty tasty. Other flavors of note are the roasted banana, and Ritual's coffee toffee.

"People are talkin, talking bout people I hear them whisper, you wont believe it." Let's just say if Bi-Rite were my lover, I'd be one hellavuh lucky lady. Anyhoo Bi-Rite reminded me of this song because people are always talking about this place. I mention Mitchell's and I hear a collective groan in unison from the group, but you say Bi-Rite and everyone is taken to this magical place where it is not just a creamery but a dreamery. The first time I went here was just a few weeks ago, and then I had to go 2 weeks in a row. I started with the salted caramel and balsamic strawberry. I love me some caramel and especially salted caramel, so this was completely drool worthy. What's cool is that they use real spoons for the taste samples, and are very green in general, what's bad is the line is always forevers and a day. But for the most part it's worth it. Even on the coldest day in the city there will be a line out the door for the deliciousness. Definitely the best ice cream place in the city that I've discovered so far.

Bi-rite is a cute, fun ice cream shop that's definitely worth a visit! Nice place to grab a cone before having a picnic at Dolores Park. I tried: Balsamic Strawberry. You taste a slight tartness, but the rest of it is pretty much strawberrylicious. Honey Lavender tasted like a sweet, pleasant shove into a never-ending field of lavender. Coffee Toffee. I love coffee anything. So this was amazing. The ice cream had great, creamy texture, but I wasn't completely blown away. I'm probably not mature enough to understand the tasteful palette of great ice cream. +1 for the creative flavors.

Finally! I got the chance to taste the infamous Bi-Rite ice cream. It was a cold and windy night in the City. Before hitting up some bars, my gal pals and I had a craving for Ice Cream and made it a point to come here. Parking was a biznatch and walking uphill against the strong gust made our craving for ice cream quite a journey. Nevertheless, I was happy with the end product: Roasted Banana and Snickerdoodle on a sugar cone! It was amazing...orgasm in my mouth. At that point, I didn't care how cold it was outside, I wanted more! Other flavors I sampled: Balsamic strawberry- Nyeh, tasted like regular strawberry to me. Perhaps my taste buds aren't sophisticated enough to pick up on the balsamic part. Honey Lavender- Great to sample, but a little too overwhelming to have a whole serving. Cute little place. The staff rocks. Ice cream- heavenly.

Divine (minus) standing in line. When I lived in the Mission I would go to this place every Friday and get their salted caramel~!!! However, over time I have to say this place has gotten a little over-rated. I like how they opened a frozen yogurt stand next-door. Great business move

Doesn't look like this place needs another 5-star review, but I'll go for it anyway. ÊCame here on a whim since the aroma of freshly made waffle cones brought us in. ÊHad a "make your own sundae" and almost made myself sick because it was SOOO good that I could not stop eating! Ê This place is amazing and you MUST go if in the neighborhood.

Finally checked out the soft serve ice cream last night, and I was surprised how un-creamy it was. ÊIt tasted kind of icy ... like iced milk. ÊI asked the window girl (who was super nice despite the fact that she was freezing her butt off -- by the way, they should give her a window that she can shut so she doesn't DIE of exposure back there!) about it, and she assured me that it was ice cream but explained that it had less milk fat than the hard pack. ÊI think, though, that if it has less milk fat it wouldn't be ice "cream" .. it WOULD be ice milk, right? Anyway. ÊIt was okay, but not fabulous. ÊI do, however, appreciate how they change their soft serve menu each day. ÊDespite that, I'll stick to the hard pack next time.

Already stuffed from dinner, our friend asked us if we wanted to grab dessert. Hello, there's only one right answer to that question. Ê;) So we made our way to Bi-Rite Creamery and ...OMG, ice cream never tasted this good! It makes me sad thinking how far away Bi-Rite is. And when I'll be able to have it again. :( The salted caramel + butter pecan combo was to die for. Sweet, buttery, nutty goodness for your mouth. It was so good I tried to convince my friends to go back the following day (didn't happen). And then again the day after that (didn't happen). Why do my friends not appreciate gourmet ice cream? It's worth the hour long drive from San Jose!

This place is so good, it makes me want to cry knowing that I live in London and it's so far away. We were recommended this place by a lovely guy in the Sunglasses Hut in the Castro, and he was spot-on with this place. I had the balsamic strawberry (as he suggested) and the roasted banana. It was amazing. I repeat, AMAZING. Take it from someone who a) loves ice cream and b) goes to Italy a lot to eat ice cream, this place is totally worth a visit and it makes my heart break that I got a taste and it was fleeting, but worth every second of full fat heaven.

Salted Caramel. ÊSalted Caramel. ÊSalted Caramel. Came on a Saturday afternoon after having brunch nearby. ÊHad to wait in line for about 35 minutes, which isn't really that bad. ÊI got to sample about 5 different kind of flavors before settling on Salted Caramel and the Strawberry Balsamic. The Salted Caramel is just.... magical. ÊNothing really beat the salty and sweet and that toasted flavors from the caramel.... GAH I'm drooling. ÊThe ice cream itself isn't too soft or too frozen. ÊAs for the Strawberry Balsamic, don't worry, it's not gonna taste like vinegar. ÊIn fact, the balsamic probably enhanced the strawberry flavor. ÊYou can't really taste balsamic, but it was just so good. ÊIf you think Haagen Daaz strawberry is good, Bi-Rite's destroys it. Sampled the Honey Lavender... didn't really care for it since I'm not that huge of a fan of lavender but my friends loved it. ÊThe snickerdoodle is a must for peanut butter fans. You can choose to have a sundae made, order an ice cream sandwich, or even get Salted Caramel frozen yogurt at the separate window (with way shorter line). It's about $3.50 for a small. ÊLittle expensive but trust, it is way worth it. ÊIf you want to buy a pint or a quart, you can skip the line! ÊSo if you have a big group, just get Salted Caramel pint size and have the time of your life! Again, Salted Caramel. ÊJust do it.

My favorite combos so far: Snickerdoodle and Ginger. That's after attempting on several trips to find something that went with Ginger and one of the friendly employees gave me a delicatible sample of this. The Mexican Chocolate is also quite scrumptious when paired with salted caramel and the Lavendar Honey an out of this world deja vu moment that sends me soaring back to memories of Lavendar ice cream at the foot of Mount Fuji Êwhen I lived in Japan.

OH MY GOD! I know I say this a lot when I eat ice cream, but seriously, I think I just died and went to heaven!! Ice cream here is so delicious. And oddly enough, it's kind of fluffy, light, and airy. Delicious, but kind of a shame since I could eat a gallon in like 5 minutes without having a stomach ache. I love the burnt caramel ice cream, especially with some toffee and caramel sauce. Also, the berry sundae is epic. Some of the flavors sound a bit odd, but somehow they made it work. Don't be shy, ice cream here is to die for, and the staff is fairly helpful and kind. They make it easy to go into ice cream coma and dream heavenly things.

There are 3 ways to win me over. Give me some ice cream, give me some cookies or give me some cake. Really that's all you need. Bi-Rite definitely has some bomb ass ice cream. I'm not sure how to describe it exactly...maybe its the cream they use...but the ice cream is so creamy yet not overly heavy. The other night, I was lucky enough to have the bro-in-law bring back a pint from Bi-Rite. Why hellooo you Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces of yumminess!

Thank you YELP and fellow Yelpers for letting us know about this wonderful place! Seriously the best ice cream I have ever had! Some friends and I had seen this place on Yelp and wanted to try it, but I have to admit I was a little leary it would live up to all the hype. I can now safely report that yes, it does live up to the hype. Why can't Dublin have good places like this? A group of friends and I stopped in one day last week and thank goodness it wasn't busy. All four of us were Bi-Rite virgins so we took quite a bit of time ooohing and aahhing over the different flavors. We each sampled 4-6 of the flavors with no hesitation from the guy behind the counter, he was so super nice. ÊI love how they give samples on real spoons, so environmentally friendly. I tried the Magnolia Coffee Porter, Roasted Banana, Toasted Coconut, Salted Caramel, Ricanela's (a cinnamony ice cream with snicker doodles) and some other flavor with a ginger caramel swirl. ÊThey were all so amazing I couldn't decide what to get. I eventually ended up with Salted Caramel, Ricanela's and Cookies and Cream...all so wonderful! A little piece of creamy, sweet heaven on earth! It was like having Grandma's fresh home made ice cream, but with amazing flavors. Seriously, believe the hype...this place is THAT good!

You're lucky you lived up to the hype and surpassed my expectations, Bi Rite. After months of delays of wanting to try this place, I finally made it, and I decided to bring 3 buddies along. Granted the weather was cold and it was damn near 9:30 in the evening, this place was still poppin'. Guess any weather is good weather for their ice cream. I mean there were couples, families, and hungry groups of friends like us. I could easily see why lines can be long during peak hours and hot days. Now I didn't sample anything before I made my order, but I did notice how they use metal spoons to give out samples. Props for thinking about the environment. With so many damn flavors, it was hard to choose what I wanted, and they all looked good. I'm not gonna lie, I like my plain vanilla, but I didn't come all the way from the east bay to have it here. I like how the sizes they offer have 2 sets of scoops to chose from. For example, the large (which I got... don't judge) allows you to get 2 or 3 scoops. I'm trying as much as I can here, so of course I'm gonna cop 3 scoops. I ended up ordering the salted caramel, brown sugar, and honey lavender. The salted caramel was good, but kinda strong. I guess its cool that the aftertaste stays on your tongue for awhile. The brown sugar was good too, but wasn't as flavor-packed as I expected. My favorite out of the 3 scoops was definitely the honey lavender. The best way to describe it is like its.... bathroom potpourri in your mouth? Well, that's what I thought it was. Take it as a good thing, honey lavender was money. I also sampled my friends' ricanelas and balsamic strawberry, and those were rather delicious too. What's funny is that after eating all my ice cream, I didn't feel bloated or guilty haha. It would have been nice to have a bottle of water handy though. Bi Rite has easily become a favorite of mine due to the quality of the ice cream, the variety of unique flavors, and the flexibility in scoops. They also take credit card! I really look forward to my next visit so I can either get more scoops of new flavors or even a sundae. Woot.

This is one of those places where you wish you knew about a long time ago. Heard all the hype about this place from my friends so I thought i'd try it out myself. At first when we got there, i was tryin to imagine how these flavors would taste because they were not your ordinary flavors. So, i settled for the salted caramel, brown sugar, and ricanelas which is pretty much a snickerdoodle. DAMN. I was shocked with all the flavor this freakin ice cream put out. Brown sugar tho was kinda blah after tasting the other 2. But other than that, it was all good. Also tried the balsamic strawberry (yum), malted vanilla (super yum w/ rice crispies inside), and chocolate coconut. (ok). ÊThey take credit card! woo pah! I look forward to trying out other flavors esp their sundaes and coffee toffee. Definitely would recommend this place to ANYONE who loves ice cream.

Chocolate Ice Cream. Check. Bergamot Olive Oil. What? Sea Salt? Ummm... Yes folks, these are the ingredients for their well-known "Sam's Sundae" and if you haven't had it yet - GO AND TRY IT!! I was once a skeptic but I finally gave in after my bf begged me to share it with him (he saw it on TV and the person eating it said it was the BEST sundae she ever had..EVER). ÊI know, olive oil and salt in ice cream?? It is SOOO GOOD!! The flavors of the bergamot and salt mixed in with the chocolate ice cream was AMAZING!!!! Ê In addition, BiRite also has an amazing selection of fab flavors such as ricanelas and brown butter pecan (just to name a few). ÊThere can be a long line here sometimes, but the wait is so worth it for this ice cream. ÊFor those who like popsicles better, they also have some available and they are just awesome.

I think Bi-Rite is a little overrated (personally I prefer Mitchell's), but it's still some pretty good ice cream. Things that separate Bi-Rite from others: - most unique flavors: salted caramel, ginger, honey lavender, ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles), brown butter pecan, roasted banana, creme fraiche, etc. - crazy high prices - crazy long lines Be prepared to wait in line for 30-60 minutes, and ready to spend aroudn $5 for a tiny bit of ice cream. If you're cool with that, then this place is for you! No, I'm not a hater, but people should know that the lines are long and the prices are high. That being said, the ice cream is good.

At last, I finally met my match!. I never thought I could ever find a dessert that I would love without any chocolate or the main ingredient is chocolate, but Bi Rite introduced me to Mr. Salted Caramel Ice cream lol. I was iffy to give it a try because I love chocolate and have always tend to order chocolate just to keep it safe. I decided to try this due to rave reviews. I couldn't be any happier..I just fell in love with the taste. It has the right amount of saltiness. ÊUntil now i'm still having a hard time describing how it taste but i say GO TRY IT and u won't be sorry. Line can be long but they know how to keep it moving and it goes by fast. It is also by Dolores Park so u already know how hard it is to find parking around there. Park 5 blocks the first time i came here...then the second time I went, I just told the bf to drive around and drop me off. The people that works here are also nice and friendly. Try the Coffee crunch (i THINK THATS THE NAME)....its gonna be the best coffee ice cream ul ever have . Their chocolate ice cream is also awesome (drool) ...It's semi sweet and i love dark chocolate ice cream..its just rich without being too sweet. Lavender Ice cream is suprisingly good, something different...the taste and aromas of lavender definately lingers to my nose after trying it...but It's not for everyone. Don't be shy to ask for samples because they really don't mind how many flavors you try. Nice Service and definately worth a try.

I wouldn't say that this is the BEST ice cream i've ever had, but it was a nice experience. Perhaps I didn't try the right flavors (brown butter pecan, malted vanilla, roasted banana) but to me everything seemed a little similar in taste. I know that this place is an institution, but I really, really think that there are better options out there. I'll give it another try, I swear! I've also had a bad experience with salted caramel ice creams, so I refuse to try more. Of all the flavors that I tried, I'd say the malted vanilla was pretty great. The peanut brittle was a nice touch to it. By the looks of it, I would've expected brown butter pecan to have more flavor but I swear it was just vanilla ice cream... So I don't think this place was exactly bad, but it wasn't the best thing i've ever had. I'll be sure to give it a chance though. I feel a need to fill up that punch card!

Goddamn is that delicious ice cream. It's not good enough that I got 2 scoops of awesome in a cup. No, I had to get an extra little taste of the peanut butter swirl ice cream as well. Mint Chip - rich with lots of mint flakes. It's imperative that I get mint flakes in every spoonful so I had to do a little mixing of the ingredients myself, but no points off for that. Cinnamon Snickerdoodle - I'm a huge fan of cookie dough ice cream, but I had no idea I would like this one with bits of cookie in it. Delightful. Love it every which way.

Salted-caramel ice cream is the best ice-cream I've ever had. Ê Sadly, I can't find anything like it in Texas. I regret not trying the honey lavender...next time! My really awesome hosts took me here before dinner at La Trappe. ÊWe were all supposed to share a small ice cream for taste but after trying the salted caramel, I ordered my own serving. ÊThough my stomach felt like it was going to explode later that night, it was worth it. Ê SO WORTH IT. Not like a lot of ice cream places do it, but they don't skimp on the serving.

My go-to spot for ice cream in SF. ÊLucky for me, it's "walking distance" from my place in Hayes Valley (I say "walking distance" because my friends visiting from LA didn't think 1.5 miles qualified as walking distance.) Excellent selection - obviously known for their Salted Caramel (even more-so now since being mentioned on the 7x7 list.) ÊThey have other interesting flavors such as Ginger (my personal favorite - very light and palate-cleansing), Earl Grey Tea, and Roasted Banana. ÊThey even have a couple vegan options for you lactards out there. The texture was interesting - one of my friends described it as being "icy-creamy" which was pretty spot on. ÊDefinitely not as creamy as Mitchell's. Definitely worth waiting in line (which can stretch half a block down Dolores on some days.) ÊBrownie points being San Franciscan and having compostable cups and spoons before it was mandated by the city earlier this summer.

The salted caramel icecream is as good as everyone says. Earl Grey was a bit too milky for my taste, but definitely tasted like Earl Grey tea. The honey lavender made me think of eating handcreme (something nice like L'Occitane, but nonetheless handcreme). Yay for Bi-Rite's use of compostable bowls and spoons.

I'm on a diet for a summer body and this place is the worst when it comes to avoiding sweets. Lol I'm NOT even a sweet lover, but I like...no...love this place. Warm staff, very friendly, they give you samples in metal spoons to save the environment (so SF sustainbility movement lol). I had the Ginger ice cream, bloody mary float with Ginger ice cream and cookies and cream. Ginger is bomb!!! Very sweet, but who cares, I like the smell and this is new! for me at least. Only if I didn't eat my lunch, I think I would have stuffed 2 more scoops of whatever. Beware...there is a LINE. Lol.

YUM!!!! ÊThis is the best ice cream ever! ÊI am so happy that I discovered Bi-Rite Creamery. ÊToo bad it's so far away from me, or I'd be coming here all the time. Ê We got here late on a foggy afternoon, so the line was out the door, but it wasn't too crazy long. ÊAnyway, it moved really fast, and I needed the extra time to decide which flavors I wanted to try! ÊI ended up trying the salted caramel, which everyone raves about, honey lavender, pomegranate sorbet, and malted (toasted?) vanilla. ÊThe salted caramel was really good with a lot of depth of flavor, but for me it was just a little too sweet. ÊThe pomegranate sorbet was good too, but I generally like creamy ice cream better than sorbet. ÊI loved the honey lavender and especially loved the malted vanilla with peanut brittle. ÊWOW. ÊSo good!! ÊYou can really taste the quality of the ingredients they use (I think they use milk from Strauss Creamery). Too bad they don't sell this stuff at Whole Foods or something. Ê I can't wait to go back!

Absolutely the best ice cream ever! The honey lavender tastes just like a spa. ÊAnd the mint chocolate and coffee are amazing as well. If ever you want an ice cream cake, Bi-Rite is quite accommodating. ÊDon't expect any frosting on it though, as it's just ice cream on cake. ÊNot expensive as other cakes in the area so definitely worth the visit. ÊAll in all, very good stuff.

I tried the Balsamic Strawberry, Honey Lavender and Salted Caramel. ÊBalsamic Strawberry = how could you go wrong with strawberry, this was delicious; Honey Lavender = reminded me of some skincare product infused with lavender - this flavor left a pleasant aftertaste, but I have to be honest, it didn't go well with the other two flavors - for your highest tasting pleasure, it should be enjoyed by itself; Salted Caramel = if you like salty and sweet at the same time, this flavor is for you - it took me a few moments to get used to it, as my brain kept telling me isn't ice cream supposed to be just sweet? ÊBut later on, I understood how it can become quite addicting. Ê When I arrived here @ 11am on a sunny Saturday morning (the time it opens for business), there were only 3 people in line before me. ÊThe lady who took my order was very sweet and all smiles! ÊI definitely look forward to returning here again and trying the Roasted Banana, Toasted Coconut and Earl Grey flavors next time around. ÊGreat that it is located next to Dolores Park - that is a very pleasant park to be at. ÊAnd come here by public transportation if you can; don't stress yourself out in finding parking around this area. ÊIt's a shame that I used to live only a few blocks away from this place but had never gone until now. . . ÊThis is by far the best place I've found to get ice cream in SF.

I haven't Yelped in a long time, but after visiting this place I was inspired to Yelp again. BEST.ICE CREAM.EVER. So good that I had to use Caps and periods. The line was ridiculously long but my friend had a genius idea of buying a couple of pints and sharing. That way we get to try different flavors. ÊNow if you're buying pints instead of individual scoops, you get to bypass the line and go right up to the front and order. I believe pints were about $7 or $8. We ordered: Salted Caramel, Coffee Toffee, Ricanelas and Malted Vanilla. ÊI honestly cannot tell you which is my favorite and I'm getting brain freeze just thinking about it.

Fresh and pure ice cream and sorbet handmade at the Bi-Rite Creamery (started by the same folks as the Bi Rite Market down the street). ÊIt's great anytime, but best go on a chilly foggy San Francisco evening, and get a scoop of the salted caramel or brown butter pecan flavor. ÊThe cold inside makes you feel warmer on the outside, or something like that. For a little show, order a banana split that they blowtorch right in front of you. ÊAnd why not get dessert here instead of hogging the damn tables all night long at Pizzeria Delfina (as the party of three in front of us did the other night - are you sure you don't want a third dessert or cup of coffee? ÊHow about running through those vacation photos again? ÊSheesh, get a clue people, the place is tiny and people are starving!) Anyway, sorry, I digress. ÊBottom line, this place is quality, I loved the natural ice cream and will be back. ÊFour stars, pretty darn good.

I just don't get what all of the fuss is about over this place.

This review is for the chocolate chip cookie ONLY. ÊI'm lactose intolerant and therefore unable to enjoy the ice cream here. I believe that Bi-Rite Creamery bakes the 2nd best chocolate chip cookie in San Francisco. ÊUnlike the ubiquitous buttery/chewy Toll House style that mainstream Americans seem to fall over each other for, the good folks at Bi-Rite have created a very unique cookie. ÊIt seems to have a high walnut content, although the nuts are lovingly chopped almost to the consistency of granola - a very nice touch, since I'm convinced that the "chunky walnut" craze that has a death grip on pop culture here in the States is in fact the result of laziness, plain and simple. Ê(Yes, I'm talking to you Mission Beach Cafe Cookie Chef.) There is also a deeply satisfying note of molasses in the dough, but the key to the success of this cookie is quite honestly in the chocolate. ÊI'm not a sucker for any halfway decent chocolate chip that comes along, but let me point out that Bi-Rite does not use chocolate CHIPS per se. ÊRather, these would be more accurately referred to as chocolate PLATELETS that are broken into randomly sized chunks. ÊSometimes I'll bite into a very expansive platelet that the chef has (perhaps on purpose?) left intact somewhere in the cookie, and this is such a thrilling moment - on par with opening a fortune cookie message that reads, "You will inherit some money or a small piece of land." ÊA surprisingly complex cookie experience.

Believe the hype. ÊI'm an ice cream expert and this place made me feel small and unknowing. Visiting S.F. and my ex-girlfriend/foodie, she always tries to blow my mind with her newly found favorite epicurean discoveries. ÊThis time, again, she achieved her goal. We arrived at Bi-Rite to find only three people in line which apparently is very rare as normally the line is out the door and down the sidewalk. ÊListen, if there's a line, just like Salumi in Seattle, GET IN LINE and enjoy the wait, you will be rewarded. I had the hot fudge brownie Sunday which was very good but I would suggest just going for scoops of like three different flavors so you can really appreciate the craftsmanship of this stuff. ÊI ended up taking tester spoons out of Laura's cup! Ê The Honey Lavender was amazing in a weird "I'm eating flowers" sort of way. ÊTry it for sure. The staff was cool, with the transplanted Milwaukee dude breaking my chops about my Cubs hat. ÊThe guys working there laughed and joked with every person who came to the counter, taking the time to do so and yet no one minded waiting! ÊSo good to be back in a place with friendly, jovial people! Cheers guys! ÊSee you again before I leave.

Just kidding, babe, I love you! Haha, I don't want to piss off the only person that reads my reviews. Sorry again for the ADD. ÊTo summarize, this place is a must-try when in SF.

ÊCome when you can, and if you see the Chinese butterball in the corner indulging himself in a pint of Salted Caramel, say hello!

One of the few things that has disappointed me about San Francisco is the lack of ice cream joints. ÊOf course, Mitchell's is incredible, and Bombay will do in a pinch, but it's nice to have another one to add to the list. The cookies and cream was good -- big chunks of Oreos and extra-creamy ice cream. ÊI'm a big fan of the environmentally-friendly cup and wooden spoons, as well as the real metal spoons for tasting. ÊStaff was friendly, and although it is small and crowded, the benches outside around the sidewalk trees are really nice. True, $2.95 for a single is more pricey than Mitchell's or Bombay, and you do get less -- but I'm okay with it, because it's one of those times where you pay more to be a little bit healthier. ÊCause, who's gonna leave any Mitchell's amazing grasshopper pie in the bottom of the cup? ÊNot me. ÊBut if you don't get a huge portion to begin with, you aren't gonna eat it. ÊAnd if I have to pay a bit more for some help to exercise moderation. . .well. . .that's okay.

I didn't know I liked ice cream. I don't remember the last time I actually got ICE CREAM - it's usually gelato, frozen yogurt.... crepes. My friends and I were on our way to Gelato Naia and saw this huge line and had to see what all the fuss was about. They have interesting flavors, I'm personally not interested in eating ice cream that tastes like flowers, but I tried their Coffee Toffee and Roasted Vanilla and it was amazing. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. They also had ice cream sandwiches, chocolate souffles, chocolate chip, and oatmeal raisin cookies. UPDATE: I was confused where the patisserie was, because I wanted to find the rest of their baked goods. They sell some, but not all, of their baked goods at the creamery. Across the street at the bi-rite market they have tartletts, breads, and cakes, as well as a fine selection of wines... The Malted vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate and Coffee Toffee are so ridiculously good, I think I'm having withdrawal symptoms after just 3 visits.

Jess M is pro Bi-Rite and not so pro Mitchell's. She says the ice cream at Bi-Rite is so much better and in order to give me the best eating tour of SF, she takes me to Bi-Rite and you know what I do? I don't order any ice cream. I go for a melon popsicle. I did however sample the roasted banana and it was freakin good. Not so banana-y but very much a hint of banana. Like chesnuts roasted on an open fire, this banana ice cream was roasted to perfection. But alas, I wanted a follow up to the melon agua fresca I had an La Tacqueria and the melon popsicle at Bi-Rite was the answer. Jessica M got the plum popsicle. It was the most gorgeous shade of purple, it could have been a shade of nail polish. Anyhows, her popsicle ended up tasting like prunes (sorry Jess). My melon popsicle was refreshing and like agua fresca on a stick. Me, Bi-Rite Creamery, Dolores Park, and a bff = a perfect afternoon.

This place is literally heaven in your mouth. Seriously... I know another 5 starts isn't going to do it justice, but I just had to mark this place off on my to do list. I first heard of this place on the food network and was quite intrigued on how the host was ranting and raving about Sam's Sundae (Chocolate ice cream with bergamot olive oil, maldon sea salt and whipped cream) So I tried it not expecting much, but OOOOOH there were so many fireworks going off the creaminess of the ice cream, subtle saltiness of the salt crystals, and the floral notes of the olive oil were just fantastic. I'll also suggest trying the Ricanelas and salted caramel oooh wow... The one thing that I really like is that you can get your ice cream and walk kiddie corner to the park and people watch.

I know people are raving about the Salted Caramel, but for me it was all about the Honey Lavender and Ricanelas (Snickerdoodle) combo! I tasted the Salted Caramel and for a moment I was puzzled to see many people buying scoops of it when I thought it tasted like caramel cooked far too long. Now, now, before the flames come at me that's just my opinion of it alone ... I think that if you paired it with something else it would mellow it out some bit - just sayin'. I got my Honey Lavender and Ricanelas combo which was probably the best decision I've probably ever made in ice cream selecting history! The Honey Lavender was sweet and you could really taste the Lavender in there, it is not subtle. The Ricanelas (Snickerdoodle) was creamy, had bits of Snickerdoodle and had that cinammon-y bite to it and was just wonderful. The workers are great here and for the prices of homemade ice cream, nawwwt bad! P.S. I was still craving for more so I went ahead and got the Mango Popsicle which is $1.95 and it's perfect for those Mango nectar lovers, it was like someone took a mango froze it and sprinkled magic on it to turn it into a popsicle treat! Pretty sweet though.

K and I were finally celebrating my bday (it was in January) and I chose to dine at Delfina so I can also 'stop by' Bi-Rite... Ê I just had to find out what the fuss was all about.

ÊAfter dinner, even though we were both full, I just *had* to walk by Bi-Rite and check it out, not *really* intending to get anything. ÊBy golly, the line was much shorter! ÊMaybe only 2-4 people out the door. ÊSo, of course I just *had* to get in line and get something. ÊSo glad we did.

I don't see what the big fuss about Mitchell's is when there are places like this in the city. Of course, I'm still a devote Naia fan, but that's gelato and if I were in the mood for some simple ice cream, I would totally come here instead of Mitchell's, and here's why: 1. They're not as crowded 2. It's right near Dolores Park AND a bunch of cool restaurants 3. You can sit down and hang out here They have a bunch of unique flavors, and the last time I had a sample of the Lavender which was a tie w/the Earl Grey when deciding, but I went with the Earl Grey, which was super yummy...almost tasted like the chai you get when you go to indian restaurants (which is basically Earl Grey w/milk). ÊNext time though, I'm definitely getting an order of the Lavender cuz I'm still thinking about it!

Bi-Rite is the shit. I've been hearing about this place and meaning to come here for years, but never made a trip out of it or tried to figure out where exactly it was. I was leaving Teachers for Social Justice at Mission High and then I saw a fat line for this ice cream shop so I was like I might as well. Then I got to the front of the line and the sign said "Bi-Rite" and I was like 'oh what, this is Bi-Rite". Salted Caramel was insane, maybe the best scoop of ice cream I have ever had - super rich and deep flavors, someone else said buttery and I would agree with that. That was the top of my cone, on the bottom I asked for Toffee Coffee and that was really good too.

I don't get into sweets much, but if you've ever had delicious artisanal ice cream-and I don't mean gelato-you understand why it's one of the rare enticements for my taste buds. I really got excited when I saw the Salted Caramel flavor. It reminded me of the yummy as hell Bertillon ice cream you get in Paris. I hesitated once I saw the price tag: $8 for a pint?!?! wtf...awhh, wt hell, this better be good. No one else is making such good flavors around here. The result: me and 3 other Bertillon fans all really enjoyed the flavor. It should be renamed burnt salty caramel. So freaking tasty! So why, you ask, do I only give it 3 stars? The price you pay is too high for the air-pumped cream. It just doesn't fill you or your freezer as much as the denser stuff I love, but then again, tighter ice cream probably would mean even higher prices. A splurge.

I finally had the chance to try Bi-Rite Creamery. I mean, I tried it before, but that was at the SF Street Food Festival a couple months ago (had Sam's Sundae at that time and LOVED LOVED LOVED it--chocolate ice cream, olive oil, and a sprinkle of sea salt). This time around, I was so tempted to get Sam's Sundae again, but I opted for a couple scoops. I got creme fraiche and ricanlas (cinnamon with snickerdoodle cookies). The flavors went sooo well together! Craime fraiche was delicious and tart like it should be, and the ricanlas straight up tasted like snickerdoodles (one of my favorite cookies)! I also had a taste of my friend's balsamic strawberry, salted caramel, and coffee coffee, which were all delicious as well. Next time I want to try the ginger, lavendar honey, and roasted banana. Yum yum yum! Luckily I went without my SO, so now I have to take him back there...lucky me! :0)

Best.ice cream.ever.period. Salted caramel, coffee toffee (uses coffee from Ritual!!), ginger, etc etc. Soooo good!! And the servers are soo sweet! They have so much patience - they let me try basically every flavor. Hot or cold, rain or shine, I'm always down for some yummy Bi-Rite!! So here are individual reviews for the flavors I can remember: Salted Caramel: sounds like a weird combo, but it's reallyyy good. Might also be an acquired flavor. Ginger: REALLYY good. But I'm also a huge fan of ginger ice cream. Coffee Toffee: I LOVEEE coffee flavored ice cream, and this is the best I've ever had. Roasted Banana: Gross. Brown Butter Pecan: Really good, but you can almost feel your arteries clogging. Honey Lavender: Not a fan. Kind of tastes as if you're eating soap. Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel: It's okay. I'd much prefer the Salted Caramel. Ricanelas: pretty good. Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces: I can't remember, but I think this might have been good. Sam's Sundae: So I know a lot of people like this sundae, but I think it might be an acquired taste. I definitely was NOT a fan at all. It's chocolate ice cream with olive oil and salt in it. One of the servers created a small sample for me.

THEY HAVE THE BEST BANANA ICE CREAM I HAVE EVER TASTED IN MY WHOLE LIFE. EVERRR... Luckily I came on a cold and rainy day and experienced no lines! Cute chairs. Isn't it weird that the restroom is RIGHT there? Iono.. I wanna come back and try their ice cream sundaes with the olive oil!

Seriously...Salted Caramel ice cream, OH F YEAH! Sorry if it's boring, but it was really too good. The place was totally cute, not much seating but I think ice cream is best for strolling (too bad the SF nights are not like the East Coast nights...though that's the ONLY way I'd ever compare SF to the East Coast where the East Coast has ANYTHING over SF...) I digress. Go here if you haven't. And if Salted Caramel ice cream sounds remotely interesting to you- GET IT! Oh, you can taste it first too- SWEET, literally!

Really this was a 3.5 for me....but since I can't give 1/2 a star, I'll round up to be nice. So we came here after dinner on sat since we were in the neighborhood..and it was around 10:15 and the line wrapped around the block. As our group was standing in line, freezing our butts off - I was thinking this better be some bomb-@$$ ice cream! Since I only wanted to try 1 flavor, we decided to to not wait in line and just buy a pint. It's $8 for a pint of this famous Salted Caramel Ice Cream and you don't have to wait in line. Well the ice cream was good but not enough for me to wait 45 mins in line for. Also, for $8 a pint, its pretty pricey! But if I were in the area and the line isn't too long, I'd come here again...but I'm more of a vanilla kind of girl anyway.

I'm going to dedicate Jodeci's "Feenin'" to the roasted banana. "I can't leave you alone, you got me feenin". This place has 3000+ reviews, what is there to say that hasn't been addressed? Well, I think there is a lack of roasted banana fanfare. I don't think you guys understand how good this flavor is. Everytime I take a bite, I can imagine the ice cream wizard (Bi-Rite employee) hovering over a skillet with some type of Bananas Foster concoction, simmering all the lovely, brown sugar, caramelly goodness to perfection. One time I went to Bi-Rite and I thought I was going to try a different flavor but as I was approaching the counter, the Afternoon Snack Sundae caught my eye and why wouldn't it? It consists of roasted banana, caramel, and homemade graham crackers. So naturally, I pulled an audible and ditched the idea of expanding my flavor horizon. I must say, that was one of the best decisions I've ever made in 2010. The Afternoon Snack Sundae is the biz (and I never use that expression). Roasted Banana reigns supreme. I don't ever think I'll be able to taste anything else that Bi-Rite has to offer.

This joint could get 5 stars from me simply because they use metal tasting spoons. However, there is so much more to love about Bi-Rite Creamery. ÊSince I love numbered lists so Êmuch ("I'm a good driver, a very good driver"), here goes: 1. ÊSALTED CARAMEL ice cream. ÊOne billion stars. 2. ÊLavender-honey ice cream. ÊI no longer have to drive to Fairfax for this flavor! 3. ÊPrime location. ÊWho doesn't want to lick an ice cream cone in the park? 4. ÊCute shop. 5. ÊNice staff. 6. ÊMakes you feel rich. ÊWhy? ÊBecause a pint of ice cream is eight bucks. ÊThat is basically the equivalent of buying a Bentley instead of a Honda. ÊSince I don't have any plans, or means, to buy myself a $100,000 car instead of a $6,000 twenty year old vehicle, this $8 pint makes me feel like one of the founders of Google. ÊLook at me- I'm so outrageous in my purchasing habits! ÊThrowing caution to the wind! ÊAn $8 pint of pint of ice cream! ÊWhy not? I'm worth it!

I remember eating at Delfina's a while back before Bi-Rite Creamery opened up. ÊWe finished dinner and walked by Bi-Rite Market and saw a sign that read homemade ice cream. ÊOur mouths watered so we decided to go in to get some ice cream. ÊI think we were looking for scooped ice cream served on cones which we couldn't find. ÊLooking back I think they probably had pints in the refrigerator. Ê Disappointment. Years later I drove by that area and saw a new store front, Bi-Rite Creamery! ÊWoo hoo! ÊI Êimmediately stopped (even though I was in a rush to get somewhere) and went in to get some ice cream. ÊI have never looked back since then. ÊBi-Rite has become my favorite place to get ice cream in San Francisco. ÊI Êjust love their clean taste and creative flavors which are not over the top like other places but creative enough to make me smile. Ê Some of my favorites are salted caramel, roasted banana, and double ginger. ÊThe newest flavor on my "like" list is orange cardamom. ÊA harmonious blend of flavors that aren't too overpowering and works perfectly for me.

This place is by far the best ice cream you can get. ÊIt seems like every time my friends and I eat in San Francisco, we always end up here at Bi-Rite for dessert. First time i came here, my taste buds was kind of off. I believe i had a hangover or something but i didn't like it. Second time i came here, i got the salty caramel and the malted vanilla with peanut brittles all stacked inside of a cone. Let me explain that moment. The salty caramel had a crazy kick to it in a good way, it's like Chuck Norris punched your tongue. The malted vanilla with peanut brittles helped calm the caramel down. Mix those 2 flavors together and you got a party in your mouth. You have to get both taste mixed together and you will understand what i went through. It was delicious. 5 stars for a great ice cream shop

My friends and I went into Bi-Rite for some ice cream even though it was FREEZING in SF. I was only visiting, and honestly, I wish I knew about this place a long time ago. The staff was so nice and patient because I sampled a bunch of flavors before actually committing to any. Whether a cup or a cone, you can still choose 2 flavors when you order a single because they give you 2 scoops for $3.25. I chose ricanelas which was a cinnamon ice cream with bits of snickerdoodle cookie pieces, and the brown sugar ginger -- SO BOMB -- probably the best combination ever. I also tried the toasted coconut, roasted banana, honey lavender, and the salted caramel. ALL OF THEM WERE GOOD! You can also buy sundaes, ice cream cakes and pies, or just buy their flavors by the pint. I'm definitely going back.

Ok Ok, I know I might have a slight, no major addiction to ice cream and frozen yogurt, but at least I am happy to admit it! I was very excited to try this place after hearing great things about it and I am always looking for new sweet spots. I must admit there was a pretty long line and my friend said, "Do you really want to wait in this line?...We can just skip it." to which I replied, "No, we can't skip it. I hear it goes fast, it's worth the wait and I MUST HAVE ICE CREAM." Yummmmmy, so worth the wait and I wish I had gotten a bigger size because when I finished, I sadly looked down at my cup wishing there was just one more bite. And I was getting a cup of coffee this morning right across the street at The Dolores Park Cafe at 7 a.m. (on a Sunday, don't ask) and I wished they were open, I would have happily had their ice cream for breakfast.

Bi-Rite creams a good ice... There are several features upon which I typically judge ice cream. ÊTexture is obviously quite important, but Bi-Rite's best attribute is in the taste department. Ê Typically I am somewhat of a traditionalist when it comes to new flavors (Peppermintstick on a summer day is pretty hard to beat), and this usually stems from the fact that many creamers who venture into new flavors just dont nail it. ÊThese guys have some of the best true flavor in creamed ice that I have ever come across. ÊMy typical benchmark for flavor quality gravitates around the standards (Coffee being paramount, as few nail this one, as well as Strawberry and Vanilla). ÊThese guys kill it with their coffee with toffee in it, nice work. They obviously get some credit for their flavors of novelty, as well, and the basics (or iterations of basics, like the Strawberry with Balsamic, essentially a Strawberry with a bunch of "zing" to it) are quite tasty. Lack of novelty-traditional flavors is OK in their realm, as all flavors they make are truly their own. Amazing flavor, definitely solid texture, and Êa great shop.

if i can creatively express the goodness of bi-rite creamery with books I've read... For example, Baskin Robbins is like "where the wild things are" by Maurice Sendak- simple, full of colors, craziness, nostalgically childish. where as Bi-Rite Creamery is like "the prophet" by Kahlil Gibran - wanting, philosophical, insightful, full of perspective. They uniquely handcraft ice-cream flavors and you can mix and match the flavors just the way you like it, in two scoops or more. So be creative and go to Bi-Rite Creamery, and get some perspective!

I'm so down with this place. Maybe even too down. I don't think I could pass this creamery and not get their ice cream even if I tried. They're famous for their salted caramel. There is an excellent reason for this. It's heavenly. And I don't even like caramel! The downside: The lines can be dauntingly long. The upside: The soft-serve counter 10 feet away NEVER has a line and is really good too. Sunday is chocolate/salted caramel twist. DO IT.

While I appreciate ice cream, 9 times out of 10 I would rather have a french fry. However, Bi-Rite may be just the thing to turn me to the sweet side. I felt like I needed to try the salted caramel and then also got the roasted banana. The salted caramel was excellent but the banana was mind.blowing. I will gladly take a night off from french fries to wait in line for this deliciousness.

I've lived in the Bay Area my entire life, and I rarely visit unknown places to me, but my friend Diana recommended this place after one of her friend's told her about it. We made our way to Bi-Rite Creamery, and when we got there, there was no line, as we were standing there I noticed an Ice Cream sign, and we realized we were standing at the Bi-Rite soft serve, so after trying a sample of the salted caramel soft serve the lady recommend we try the ice cream next door. I tried the salted caramel there too, and decided to have a scoop of that until Diana tried the white chocolate with raspberry swirl and after trying a sample of that too I was convinced to get both of them. I have to say the ice cream there is pretty good, and I'd go back there again to try out the other flavors they offer.

When you say Mission I say Bi-Rite Creamery. ÊThis organic ice cream is a San Francisco staple. I don't like waiting in line for food but I'll do it at Bi-Rite because it's that good and I am definitely a fan. My favorite is the honey lavender ice cream. Each spoonful of ice cream showcases both flavors to their best. I didn't think I would betray my favorite flavor until I saw salted caramel in my cousin's freezer the other day. I couldn't resist, so I took a scoop and I don't feel guilty because it was really good. I can't wait to try more flavors!

I think anyone can go to this place even with the super cold weather right now in SF. The best is definitely the Salted Caramel. I also love the Cookies and Cream though.

The flavours here are so unique and definitely worth trying. Salted caramel, brown sugar caramel ginger swirl are my favorites. The honey lavender is also great. I like getting a sundae with their housemade almond toffee and whipped cream. It is SO good. I tried their sam's sundae and preferred to make my own. The olive oil was something i had to try once but not something i would choose over the other delicious flavors and toppings they had.

What I like about Bi-Rite is that the flavors are so unique that you probably won't find them anywhere else. Because of this, I'm really looking for the next time I come back. I heard/read that blood orange is really, really good, so I plan on getting that next!

I'm not a sweets person or a dessert person or really anyone who even regularly eats sugar, mostly because (1) I have a love affair with salt, and couldn't imagine cheating on it with silly sugar; and more importantly, (2) it's not on the diet plan to lose these "last" 5 lbs. Nevertheless, I paid the toll. Yep. Got on the hedonism hwy and oh man, was it worth it!

Never mind it's a $6.50 sundae, b/c quite frankly, if they charged $20 I'd get it (please don't do that though, Bi-Rite). You MUST try it & throw yourself a gastronomic party.

It's concluded. I'm a 1000+ review whore. I have week long affairs in my head about these places until i try it. I do what P Diddy does; I mind f**k these food havens before, during and long after my first bite. As you've read, Bi-Rite is the right bite for that perfect after dinner or pre-dinner spoiler. Unlike my sweet talk, everything, that everyone says, about the Salted Caramel and Honey Lavender is true. ÊThe Salted Caramel makes you melt before the ice cream and the Honey Lavender massages your buds and instantaneously relaxes any angst or uncertanties you've had about their flavors - If only it could kick your feet up for you and do your laundry(but i guess that's what boyfriends are for). ÊTwo very different flavors that dance so gracefully on your tongue. We also bought a scoop of the Ricanelas (cinnamon and snickerdoodle), coffee toffee and had a chance to sample the earl grey, roasted banana and cookies and cream. They all left me sad that i didn't have a larger stomach or higher tolerance for sweets. I don't care if it's dirty and a little scary....The Mission is slowly becoming my Êlittle, foodie, promised land of hope.

I'm a man of simple tastes, vanilla ice cream is often a standard of mine with "cookie dough" being relatively fancy for me. But, when I stopped in at Bi-Rite Creamery and saw their more exotic offerings, I had to at least sample some of them. The cinnamon was actually quite tasty and left an impression on me, I still sometimes think about the flavor and texture. I wound up getting cookie dough, though :)

This is the best ice cream in the city, no contest. Last night I discovered my new favorite flavor, too.. malt with peanut butter. I got the coffee sunday with half of that flavor and actually liked it better than the coffee ice cream (normally my favorite). The sunday was incredible... lots of nuts, toffee, chocolate sauce and whipped cream on top. It was $6.50, but worth every penny. I stashed half in my freezer because it was so huge, and may have the other half for a sinful breakfast this week. Those who are looking for a cheap scoop of "normal flavored" ice cream at regular prices and don't recognize gourmet ingredients or superior quality, go elsewhere to avoid the line (and save me time!), but those who appreciate outstanding food, its worth the hassle!

this place is the first joint I'm yelping that has over 3000+ yelp reviews averaging 4.5 stars. It's hard for me to get into SF since I live San Jose and my life is busy as heck. So when I do make a trip up there, I do my best to eat at as many well-known places as possible. On this particular trip, I wrote down both Bi-Rite Creamery and Tartine Bakery to stop by after my lunch. Yes, that's a fatso move. So what? I come to SF like once every two months. I gotta be strategic. But after lunch, we first stopped by Tartine Bakery...but ended up ordering way too much and we were all stuffed beyond our imagination. Then we said let's just forget Bi-Rite Creamery...and plus, we didn't even know how far it was from Tartine Bakery! So we got in our cars and started driving and after two blocks, we are waiting for the traffic light to turn green and what do we see on our right side? Bi-Rite.....how can we just pass on this opportunity? Being a true fatso I am, I just got out of the car, happily rushed in and tried the samples of their salted caramel, roasted bananas and honey lavender (nothing shocking...all good). ÊDon't worry...you may think because I'm full, I'm just not fully experiencing the beauty of Bi-Rite but remember...true fatties never get full....and when they do say they are full, if you lure them with good food, they will still take some and fully enjoy em. Ê Everyone talks about salted caramel but to be honest, it was nothing new for me. I've had this growing up in South Korea....on the streets with these guys melting brown sugar (BBOPGI in Korean) and selling to sugar deprived asian kids...it brought all the memories of my childhood...stealing my parents money just to buy another bbopgi after school. all in all, it's a good ice cream place. i'm not sure if it deserves 5 stars and 3,000 plus reviews but the locals love it and i wouldn't drive from San Jose to get a bite of this so-called one of the best ice cream joints in America.

Oh why, oh why....most of the foods I fall in love with it is in SF? Oh why?! Bi-Rite is just not any kind of ice cream/dessert shop, it a decadent mixture of different flavors that makes one hell of a scoop or even more. The flavors they have may make your mind debating if you should try it but once you have, your taste buds will be begging for more. At this first visit to Bi-Rite, I chose a kids scoop of chocolate coconut ice cream. It was smooth, creamy with specs of coconut and a good taste of chocolate. I new I should have opted for a single scoop which includes 2 flavors because while eating mine, I tasted some other flavors hubby and my sister chose and wish I have gotten the other flavors. From their scoops, I was able to taste roasted bananas, balsamic strawberry and snicker doodle ice cream. WOW....the freshness of the ingredients hits your mouth which instantly makes you say "HMMMM" and grabbing some more. I don't know if I have a FAVORITE but I do have to say, the next time I come back, I will get a single scoop with Balsamic strawberry and snicker doodle. When you first arrive at Bi-Rite, you may need to stand in line but don't let it bum you down. The line goes by quick and you won't remember standing in line once you finish your ice cream.

Friday night at Bi-Rite. I read up on this place. On a list of other places to try, Bi-Rite was our initial stop. I think I got my hopes up though. Came here to try one thing and one thing only: Salted Caramel. But sad to say, it was a bust. The Salted Caramel ice cream didn't cut it for me. Standing in line wasn't worth it. I don't know why they hype it up but the sweet and salty wasn't right for this contraption. Flavor was extremely overwhelming. A little too rich, in fact. No cone here. My sis also sampled the Chocolate Chip. That was pretty good. I likes me my chocolate chips. Kinda made me rethink my decision about ordering Salted Caramel on its own. For a single scoop, you get to choose between 1-2 flavors. Maybe I wasn't bold enough to try the other flavors and was too hung up on trying only one. I'm all for their environmental friendliness and I hear it's a great place for awesome ice cream. But I still haven't seen the light yet. Maybe next time.

After seeing it on Yelp and dreaming about trying it for months, I finally got a chance to try it today. Delicious. I went around 7pm and there was only a short line of four people in front of me. I'm glad I didn't have to wait! I can tell they're really into the green-movement. First, they use metal spoons for sampling. Second, they only have a recycle bin (no trash!). Pretty cool! I sampled the creme fraishe and was disappointed that the fancy name was code for plain ol' vanilla. I also tried the salty caramel which was really interesting. I enjoyed it, but I wanted something a little sweeter. I ended up with the white chocolate blackberry in a kids cup. It cost $2.25 for a scoop, which happened to be the perfect size for me at the time. I definitely would have wanted more had I not just eaten a slice of cake 10 minutes prior. I really don't know what it is, but Bi-Rite has a certain quality or taste to it different from other ice creams. It's delicious! It wasn't too sweet for me and not too creamy. Next time, I want to try lavender honey. Seriously, who else makes flavors so interesting???

Finally! ÊI had been trying to make it here since opening - latest attempt having been thwarted by Bi-Rite's abnormally early closing time (10pm on a weekend? ÊCome on!). ÊSo this past Friday, I committed to foregoing dessert at Delfina (very tough move) for some ridiculously-anticipated ice cream. ÊMade from scratch with Straus dairy products, food snob-friendly flavors... I knew this would be my kind of place. Ê And I was not let down. ÊThis is seriously good stuff. ÊBecause I am a caramel obsessive, that's naturally what I got. ÊSalted caramel + brown butter pecan (the latter being a bit too subtle to truly shine in the intensely caramelly salty face of the former) + whipped cream + marcona almonds + homemade fudge sauce = Delfina panna cotta, I don't miss you in the least. ÊThough next time, it's going to be all about the Toffee Coffee. ÊI love coffee ice cream. ÊWill I love it more than caramel? ÊTBD, my friend, TBD...

Such a cute lil' place. ÊThe flavors are innovative and so tasty!!! ÊLocal, organic, and sustainable products used when creating their treats. ÊI've been back here twice and have always gotten really lucky with parking (jinx). Ê First time was the 2nd day they had opened. ÊI had the Brownie Sundae which consisted of housemade decadent brownies with salted caramel & cookies and cream ice cream, chocolate and burnt caramel sauce, whipped Straus cream, and candied pecans. ÊThis was all devoured between me and my bro with bio-degradable spoons! 2nd visit was a nice scoop of salted caramel ice cream on an organic sugar cone-yummmmy! Because the flavors are innovative-ask for lots of tastes. ÊThey are nice about it :) ÊTastes come on silverware spoons, ergo cutting back on waste-another mindful, green move. Note: on both visits I've seen, but have yet to order, the homemade hot chocolate. ÊThere's a machine brewing near the register-TEMPTATION. ÊLast visit I noticed it was labeled EXTRA DARK CHOCOLATE brewing-OMG!!! ÊAlso, don't even look into the take-home freezer.... *Love the cute benches they built around the palm trees out front*

Oh my goodness. Wow. I love ice cream, I used to be the President of the Ice Cream Appreciation Society, I should know these things. Anyhoo. Did I say wow? This place is mouth-watering, I'm licking my chops right now. The ice cream here is SO GOOD, good enough that I use the word good against the advice of all my English teachers. The texture is spot on, creamy, smooth, delicious, and none of that weird fatty aftertaste you can get at some "homemade" ice cream style places or from your own ice cream maker. I had a sundae, the whipped cream was really whipped on the premises, it looked drab because it didn't come out of a fancy spout but from a spatula, the almonds were half pieces so they were crunchy and the hot fudge was decadent. I don't even like chocolate that much, and I still loved the rich gooeyness of the hot fudge. Now on to the ice cream. I couldn't decide what to get so we split a sundae, salted caramel and cookies and cream. I kind of wanted the banana ice cream but I thought I'd be a good sport and let my friend choose the other half. They were both FANTASTIC, wow, I am salivating as I sit here. Flavorful and rich, it's the way I like my ice cream and chunky full of oreos for the cookies n' cream. I'll be sure to stop next time I'm in the Bay. It was the highlight of my day.

As a person who spent a good part of high school working in an ice cream shop, I have to say Bi-Rite Creamery is the cream of the crop.

Extra star for using all natural ingredients.

You'll be hard stuck to find anyone in dolores park who hasn't at one time or another tried bi-rite creamery (and reviewed it on yelp ) to either maintain their hipster air or superiority, or simply because it's the closet ice cream to the park. because for some reason, elite status is achieved by, "Oh yes, I waited 30 minutes in line for the best ice cream in the city" I'd been a few times years ago (before there were lines. okay it may have been the dead of winter, no hipster points there) and wasn't wholeheartdly impressed. yes, it was ice cream, yes it tasted okay, but it was nothing to write home about. But then I went back last night, and oh man, it was a different story all together. Now I'm not one of those people who get excited over exotic ie cream flavors, and really I mostly just like chocolate. Bi Rite's chocolate is not bad, but I've had better (aka strauss) . But last night I got two scoops, one chocolate and one roasted banana, and oh man, it was a mouthgasm to be sure. So good that I'll probably go back again tonight on my way home (It's probably a bad thing that this place is on my commute path) So for those of you who have yet to try the Birite creamery, suck it up, stand in line and taste a little bit of deliciousness. On a side note, their ice cream is totally affordable, the staff friendly, and the inside spotless.

I basically second everyone's opinions and suggestions here (did the salted caramel, toasted banana, and coffee toffee). ÊEverything was delicious as expected (I'm a harsh critic on ice cream, so I RARELY give out the full 5 for ice cream establishments unless they really REALLY blow my mind... or if Jake Gyllenhaal's behind the counter). However, I do have to mention that the best part of the visit was when the lady at the register rang me up: Lady: What'd you order? Me: Uh....two sundaes. *slightly embarassed and feeling like a fatty* (Note that I'm by myself as my friends didn't feel like waiting in the line and decided to lay out at Dolores Park on one of those rare sunny days in SF). Lady: Oh... don't worry, no explanation needed. Thumbs up for sure for their customer service, and understanding.

Forget about ordering vegan ice cream from Herbivore after dinner! Go to Bi-rite Creamery! Bi-rite has like 2 vegan flavors but their chocolate coconut is incredible!! And also way cheaper than paying $4.25 for ice cream at Herbivore (I do think they're reasonably priced on everything except most of their dessert items). The people working there are all pretty chill and yeah there's usually a huge wait but it's totally worth it. I like to get my ice cream here and then head to Dolores Park to enjoy.

Salted caramel is equally delicious, but extremely sugary, which is of course a-okay so long as you are mentally prepared.

#2123 reviews. Holy sh*t! Everything I say will probably be a repeat of everything everyone else has said about Bi-Rite Ice Cream. Even this statement was probably said at least 10 times. Oh well. Even though there is 0.00000001% chance that someone might even read this review, I still would love to share with you my feelings about this wonderful place. Ê If Bi-Rite Ice Cream and I had a song, it would be "Me & Mrs. Jones" I grew up eating Mitchell's Ice Cream and loyal to the creaminess and the tasty textures of the Ube and Lanka flavor. Nobody would be able to tell me otherwise. Then in 2007, Bi-Rite came along with its Salted Caramel and Coffee Toffee and swept me off my feet. I was going back and forth, forth and back, trying to stay loyal to my Mitchell's. Every once and awhile I would secretly drop in to Bi-Rite and have a scoop, but would always run back in to Mitchell's arms. I thought of Bi-Rite every now and then...of our secret ice cream love affair, but stopped going all together. Tried a few different ones...Swensen's, Humphrey's, but I didn't feel the same way about them as I did with Bi-Rite. Then recently, I joined the 7x7 Big Eats and there it was...#35 Bi-Rite's salted caramel. And the rest is... When are you going to start your love-affair with Bi-Rite?

Bi-Rite's ice cream is delicious but I would also recommend their popsicles, especially on a hot summer day. I have tried a few of their popsicles, but mango-strawberry is still the best. They seem to change the popsicle flavors by season. The popsicle tasted like a frozen sweet mango stuffed with strawberries. In terms of ice cream, I love their balsamic strawberry. The only flavor I have tried and not like was honey lavender so much because of the lavender taste. But if you like lavender, like lavender tea, you will like it. They are known for their salted caramel ice cream. It is amazing and something everyone should try at Bi-Rite, however, I found it very hard to finish my small serving. It became too sweet towards the end. If you go often, buy 10 items, get a scoop free!

I have been eyeing this place for the last year, just waiting for an excuse to eat their raved about ice cream! Finally! The Boyfriend was in town and in SF, so I had the perfect excuse to force him to eat ice cream with me even though it was cold and rainy. Nothin' ice cream can't solve :) We went and the lady behind the counter offered us generous amounts of samples and offered up her fav, the snickerdoodle ice cream. The only downside is it's a bit expensive (3.50 for a small) but mmmm it was a frickin' party in my mouth and my taste buds and stomach thanked me for it later.

Ok, I will admit it. I was a little intimidated by the Sam's Sundae concept. Chocolate ice cream, bergemot olive oil, sea salt, and whipped cream. For a midwestern boy who was raised on the sweet pleasure of vanilla custard turtle sundaes, this is a major departure from the norm. So glad I took the plunge. The olive oil is insanely fruity, and with the salt it makes for this immense amount of depth that your tongue just doesn't expect off the bat. Incredible genius went into this creation. I will be back for more someday.

Bi-Rite is a right buy! Sweet slogan huh? Can you believe I just made that up right now? Alright whatever, I've heard about the ice cream here for some time now, apparently it's quite legendary. The salted caramel is as good as they say. It tastes just like sunshine on a spring day. It reminds me of my favorite dessert from Gjelina back at home. I got to sample a few others as well, the toasted coconut was also was very notable while the lavender honey tasted like soap, the dainty little ones they give you in your hotel room. Grab a couple scoops and go recline leisurely on the grass at the nearby park. Clothing optional. Darn SF hippies. I love you.

Bi-Rite is one of the crazy popular places to get dessert in SF and there is usually a long line that snakes its way outside and around the corner, even on the chilliest of nights. ÊThey're most famous for their salted caramel flavor so you know I had to put it to the test. Once I got into the shop and tried some of their unique flavor combinations, I had to go absolutely sick and ordered 3 scoops. ÊThe first was obviously the salted caramel, but I followed that up with the brown sugar with ginger swirl as well as the ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles). ÊLet me just say...wow! ÊAll three flavors were absolutely great, with the standout being the superstar salted caramel. ÊIt wasn't overly sweet and the saltiness was extremely subtle, but there was a very special balance of flavors that you've got to taste to understand. ÊThe brown sugar and cinnamon flavors were also phenomenal and the flavors were so well balanced with their accompanying combinations. While I didn't totally dig some of the flavors in the case, they simply weren't for me. ÊHowever, the choices I did make were soooo good, and I can totally see why people are willing to stand out in the cold to score a scoop or two. ÊThere is seating outside where you can hang with your dog (the whole neighborhood is pet-friendly) and I highly recommend bring them to keep you company in line. ÊThe Mission has some really cool eateries, and none more cool than the cold scoop of their famous salted caramel. Food: 10/10 Service: 9/10 Price: $ Atmosphere: 9/10

I've only gone to Bi-Rite Creamery during off times, and on my second most recent visit, there was this one surly counter-person who was clearly from New York (and clearly so shamelessly rude that he figured he'd move to the West coast because he's run out of people to alienate.) Anyway, that punk appears to be gone and thank goodness! On my most recent trip my boyfriend and I were showing some friends around the neighborhood. This time we waited in the long line I always try to avoid. Well, we waited less than 10 minutes -- far less painful than I expected. There was friendly, happy and helpful staff behind the counter, and this was during a sunny day which is incredibly busy for them. And the best part of the recent visit: I learned that you can get two flavors in your single scoop serving. That's information that will force me to kiss my waistline goodbye for good, but whatever! That's the price you pay for the five minute orgasm of eating their ice cream.

Used to love this place until that one fateful day in February... Was down to my second-to-last lick of yummy Salted Caramel ice cream on a sugar cone when I see something dark and wiry right at the surface of my last bite. It's a pube. Seriously. Not believing my own eyes, my friend and I picked it out and put it on a napkin to get a better look. No other part of the human body's hair looks like that (and you know it).

Who doesn't like Bi-Rite? Bitter people who hate good things, I'm guessing. Bi-Rite doesn't need another killer review, but I'll highlight my favorite thing about it: the soft serve. I like ice cream as much as the best San Franciscan, but the salted caramel-vanilla twist is my addiction here. Not only do you rarely wait more than a minute or four at the froyo side window, but you also get your pick of stellar toppings or popsicles if that's more your thing.

im not sure why i bothered with so many samples... the second i heard they carried banana ice cream my subconscious had decided for me. wait....b a n a n a? yep, roasted banana creamy cold goodness! there is something about it that has proven time and again that it makes amazing ice cream (as well as gelato). bi-rite definitely continues that belief. we strolled in after a delightful lunch of Ike's in the park around the corner. i was given the heads up of its deliciousness, and though pretty full and satisfied, i couldnt pass up checking out another local fav. after a handful of samples on full-sized metal spoons, i got a scoop of banana (yes, banana!) and the peanut toffee brittle. amazing combo together. this is one of the creamiest ice creams ive ever had. and the selection of flavors are unique and sounded wonderful. i was damn near close to being a complete sample whore wanting to try all of them. but somehow the regular sized spoons they use made me feel guilty doing so. i never even thought to try the balsamic strawberry or lavender! gah, next time.. thanks for the recommendation david g! =)

A must try if you like ice cream. The line is always long, even on cold evenings. You can jump the queue by getting a pint to go, there's a separate line. I usually try to stop by if I'm ever in the Mission. My faves are honey lavendar and brown sugar. Salted caramel and balsamic strawberry are pretty good too.

Salted Caramel is always good. I tried this other flavor, I forgot what it was called, but it was cinnamon snickerdoodle with snickerdoodle chunks in it. BOMB! As I was leaving, I saw someone carry out a box of cupcakes with what looked like ice cream on top instead of frosting. I'm definitely going to try that next time.

Do you like supporting local establishments? 'Cause i do, and this SF ice cream shop is awesome! Despite the city rarely ever having "ice cream weather," any day is the right day for some Bi-Rite's Ice Cream! But sometimes there is a crazy long line out the doors, so be prepared. Bring you friends and chat while waiting, and be sure to bundle up if it's one of those foggy cold sf days. I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE their Ricanelas flavor - cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodle cookie chunks. DELICOUS! I also like the Toffee Coffee and Salted Caramel. (it may sound odd, but it's really good!) Bi-Rite's is a must try! Come on, who doesn't love ice cream?

Watch out mitchells! Êi came here after my amazing girlfriend took me to delfina's down the street. this place is amazing. there is usually a line but its so efficient you are literally still deciding what to get when it is your turn so you feel pressured to choose! Êbut they got crazy flavors like vietnamese sandwich or balut. Êits crazy! i got the salted caramel and my girlfriend stuck with mint chip.

Lines are a given, just give it 5-10 its worth it! Got the Small size with two flavors in a cup but TIPS: 1. ask for the cone on top, best of both worlds at no extra charge! 2. ask for samples they are more than willing to do so and give you metal spoons! a small thing but it saves on the waste and makes it memorable. 3. bring friends so you can steal some off them as well! Salted Carmel: they are famous for this for a reason, creamy, sweet, carmely but not overly sweet, creamy or heavy. Just satisfying. Honey Lavender: know that light, clean, fresh, relaxing, springesque, lavender smell you love so much? Yah now its in a delicious ice cream. Go get some. Early Grey: surprisingly flavorful, often tea flavors don't translate well into ice cream as either too subtle, muddled, or artificial but this gets it right. Definitely recommend at least a sample. Roasted Coconut: features actual bits of roasted coconut in the icecream it self. This is not the almond joy or typical shredded coconut many have come to recognize as the only form of coconut, rather has a more nutty crisp texture compared to the oily more chewy shredded form. Good but the least favorite of the four I tried.

Here are my favorite Bi-rite flavors: RI-CA-NEL-AS!! Isn't that a fun word to say? I'd order this just for the hell of saying RICANELAS! Malted vanilla with homemade toffee crunchy bits and chocolate pieces Coffee Toffee Cookies and cream Roasted banana and of course .. the infamous Salted Caramel... it sorta looks like mud colored. It was very caramelly indeed, salty at the end, with a somewhat burnt brown sugar taste and super sweet, even for me and my sweet mouth. Single scoop, two flavors in a cup- $3.25. I swear their is a line every time I pass by this place, but never fear, as they opened their little soft serve window to the right where they're serving up one single soft-serve flavor along with cupcakes, cookies, cakes, and pints. Here is their schedule for soft serve ice cream: Monday- Coffee & Chocolate Tuesday- Spicy Mexican Chocolate & Vanilla Wed- Salted Caramel & Vanilla Thurs- Malted Vanilla & Chocolate Fri- Chocolate Mint & Vanilla Sat- Vanilla & Chocolate Sun- Salted Caramel & Chocolate Enjoy! There's always room for ice cream..=)

I'm not a big dessert person, but this place has some pretty decent ice cream. ÊI wouldn't say they're totally unique or anything. ÊLike others have mentioned, salted caramel and honey lavender are good. I left here with the impression that it was probably one of the best ice cream places I've had, but after my recent visit to Scoop's in LA, my opinions have changed. Bi-Rite is probably the best SF has to offer, but if you like it you gotta make a stop by Scoop's next time you're down south and be your own judge.

Dear Bi-Rite, I don't know if it's truly that you are delicious or that your flavors are so imaginative, but you saved my night tonight. ÊAfter a horrible dinner, I needed a pick-me-up and my friend took me to see you. ÊThere was a line, but something told me you would be worth the wait. ÊWhen I got to your counter, you wonderful, creative flavors (many sprinkled with topping treats like peanut brittle and cookies and cream or honey) distracted me. ÊYour staff was very patient as I made my decision though: a single scoop of vanilla fraiche on a sugar cone - a perfect, normal-sized scoop too... like the scoop mom would give me as a kid (the one scooped out with a tablespoon instead of an ice cream scoop). ÊBefore I knew it, the experience was over, but I was far from mad. Sometimes, just sometimes, you only need a taste to appreciate the true divinity of this dairy delight. ÊFor that, I wrote you a little diddy. ÊSing it if you like: Bi-rite... you did me right.... you saved my night! And for, that my dear, you are truly out of sight. Baby, baby, baby... you are DY-NO-MITE!

I got 1 scoop that was 2 flavors: Peanut Butter with fleur de sel nuggets and Cookies and Cream. Mmmmm. ÊYou can have a couple of samples before you decide. Salted Caramel is a big hit but I personally am not so into that one. It tasted a bit too buttery for my taste buds. But, who cares- there is something for everyone.

Two words: ÊSalted Caramel. The salted caramel ice cream here is, to put it simply, the best ice cream I have ever had in my life. Ê(And I have had a lot of ice cream.) The only downside of this fact is that it means that none of Bi-Rites other flavors can *also* be the best ice cream I have ever had in my life, because they are all trumped by the salted caramel. Creme fraiche! ÊBalsamic strawberry! ÊI am sure I could have fallen in love with them too, but I simply can never bring myself to order anything other than the best.

A friend of mine who recently relocated to the bay area told me she found ice cream better than Fosselman's in Los Angeles. ÊI told her she was being blasphemous. ÊDuring a recent visit, she took me people watching at Dolores Park. ÊAfter 15 minutes of this, I was ready to go. ÊSo we walked down the street to Bi-Rite where I was able to confirm/deny such blasphemous rumors. I ordered a single, which really means a double scoop (?), which ensued much confusion on my end. ÊIf I had known and actually read their sign, I would've gotten two flavors instead of the boring old one. ÊTrial and error, I guess. ÊBitterness aside, I ended up getting the ricanela on a cone. ÊThat cone. ÊWas. ÊBOMB. ÊIt was light and crispy, not dense, brittle, crumbly, or overly sugary. ÊPerfection. ÊThe ice cream was tasty, as I enjoyed the cinnamon and cookie bits. ÊBut that cone, it was something else. Can't say it's "better" than my beloved Fosselman's, but it's definitely up there. ÊI'll need to try the salted caramel and maybe one of those delicious looking sundaes on my next trip.

Being that I had joined the froyo revolution, I felt like I was cheating on my cause when I came to Bi-Rite. ÊBut seeing the line that was out the door, I couldn't help but to line up and found out what the deal-o is. ÊAs we lined up, we saw a chalkboard list of flavors...which is a great sign because they claim they make all their flavors in small batches so their flavors rotate. ÊThumbs up for them on that. ÊI thought I'd play it safe and go with the honey lavender...I liked it and I literally tasted lavender which is strange for me since I usually take whiffs of it in the bathroom. Ê Next time, I'm coming here to try the balsamic strawberry flavor and maybe that snickerdoodle one too...Please forgive me froyo gods for my future unfaithful transgressions...unfaithfulness has never tasted so sweet!

It's Indian Summer, is that politically incorrect to say that, in these neck of the woods. Warm weather is expected end of September and October so it's no surprise the lovely weather we've been having. My grandparents live up the street from Bi-Rite but we were raised on Mitchell's Ice Cream. Today we went to visit grandma on her 93rd Birthday, after our visit we headed to Bi-Rite. Parking is a biiiiiiiitch! What with Mission High school right there, Tartine down the street, and Dolores Park too. Circled 2x and managed a space on Guerrero. Thankfully there was NO line at Bi-Rite! I knew what I wanted to try and what my mom would be open to taste. Prices have gone up! AUWE! At least with the single you're not limited to 1 flavor but for $3.25, I want more!!! So I got the Salted Caramel and the Roasted Banana, how could I not? Everyone raved about them here on Yelp! And mom got the toasted coconut and butter pecan. Being a warm day and having to walk back to the car, a block away, melting was occurring. I actually noticed that they seemed soft when the guy was scooping for me. The salted caramel tasted like burnt creme brulee to me. Not bad, but not great either. The roasted banana was more my cup of tea but it needs nuts in it or something, walnuts perhaps? My mom loved both her selections. ÊI only got a taste of the butter pecan and it tasted like vanilla with raw pecans. Where was the buttery goodness? or pralined nuts? Noticed the cute benches built round the trees out front. And there's some bench like seats built into the building. I can see it being a hit with some, but I guess I'm a self proclaimed Mitchell's loyalist!

Happy. ÊHip. ÊHappenin' You know an ice creamery is legitimate when there's a line out the door and people are wearing boots and fleece jackets. Bi-Rite creamery has helpful, friendly workers, unique but tasteful flavors, and delicious, quality ice cream to match! Ê The salted caramel is creamy, rich, and speckled with saltiness throughout. ÊSorbet is refreshingly tart. There isn't too much flair about Bi-rite, and the colorful, old fashioned vibe and it's pure quality will undoubtedly keep the lines long. Know Before You Go: 1. While a friend is waiting in line, have another friend scope out one of the few bar stools if you're looking to sit inside! (6 chairs inside!) ÊThere most likely will be a line. 2. Don't be afraid to ask for samples, the employees are kind - but don't take advantage! ÊKeep it reaaallll. 3. Take a date and share multiple flavors!

Ice cream you can SCREAM for! It's so worth the trip. ÊEven on a hot day and with thousands of people milling around Dolores Park for Pride festivities.

You can get 1-2 flavors with the single size and 2-3 flavors with the double size.

Came here again last night and there was no line albeit it was freezing outside. My best friend brought her friend here since he's never tried their ice cream before. Wasn't planning on getting anything and was waiting for my loverman to arrive first in case he wanted something so we could just share. He didn't want anything but he got me the Earl Grey Tea ice cream. Mmmmm. It was amazing! I am a huge fan of tea and this had a really strong tea flavor. It was nice to have something other than green tea. He said the orange cardamon flavor looked good and I told him it sounded disgusting to me. He ended up narrowing down the flavors to his top three to sample. Haha. He said he tried the orange cardamon flavor first and it was so bad it ruined the other flavors he sampled. He ended up getting the salted caramel. I tried his and we both wished it was saltier. Best friend bought a pack of their toffee cookies there. They were pretty bad. I can bake better cookies myself. We also just bought a dozen cookies from Anthony's on Valencia right before coming here so that might be another reason why they tasted like shit.

Thursday, 9:30PM. Shout-out to those who told me it was imperative that I visit Bi-Rite Creamery. The website indicates that Bi-Rite uses organic ingredients and engages in sustainable business/environmental practices. Awesome, awesome, awesome! Now, it just has to taste gooooood. We found a sweet parking spot right in front of the shop. Hopped out, stoked as heck, and saw the dreaded "CLOSED" sign. Ahhhh! Floral lady to the side of the front entrance informed me that the creamery was 40-50 feet west of the Bi-Rite Market. Needless to say, my party and I were rejuvenated, despite me feeling like a dork and thinking the market was the creamery. Signs on the creamery door says they're getting a bigger shop and I can see why. Line was out the door, despite the dang rain and despite being 9:45PM in the evening. You know it's gotta be legit if it's freezing, wet, and people still want the goods. Though there were six people ahead of us, we were ordering before we knew it. Yes, you can sample stuff too! If I wasn't so full from dinner, I'd be sampling for days. Final Call: Since there were only three seats inside, we ate the scoops standing...but you know what? It doesn't matter because the quality of the ice cream was outtttta this world. I intend to try ALL the FLAVORS! ********** Stuffed my face in: 1.

I love ice cream. I made ice cream once in chemistry in high school. It didn't come out as good as Bi-Rite's ice cream. I actually haven't gone out for ice cream in a while. I'm mainly been on a froyo streak lately, but after my friend told me about Bi-Rite, I was excited as hell to try it. Last Sunday, I finally fulfilled my dream. We skipped indoors a couple minutes before it was about to close, though the store was still super packed. Got a sample of the roasted banana (they give you samples with real metal spoons! very eco-friendly), and though I usually don't like banana that much, this sort of banana was awesome. Got one scoop banana, one scoop earl grey (because I love tea) in a eco-friendly cup, topped with an ice cream cone. Sat at a small wooden table in front of a water fountain, watched my friends do a check-in on foursquare with their iPhones and jealously wished I had one too.

4.5 Stars I want ice cream just like everyone else so expect a line and to wait during peak times. ÊIf you don't want to wait, just stay at home! There'll be more ice cream for me..muahahah :) If you tough it out though you'll experience genuinely unique flavors you cannot get anywhere else. Single - $3.25 - One or two flavors Double - $4.75 - Two or three flavors Triple - $5.95 - Three or four flavors They give you ACTUAL metal spoons to try the ice cream. ÊI highly recommend the Salted Caramel if you like a mixture of sweet and salty. ÊAnother good combo is the Roasted Banana and Toasted Coconut. ÊThe Toasted Coconut even has actual coconut shavings. This place serves up some legendary ice cream and I'm happy the weather is starting to warm up. ÊBe sure to bring your frequent buyers card because if you fill up 10 punches, you'll get a single scoop for FREE. ÊParking can also be tough so I highly recommend taking the MUNI if you live in SF. == A MUST TRY! ==

Hype gives +10 taste points. Bi-Rite is pretty darn good I'd have to say, just because there aren't any ice cream parlors like this in my neighborhood. It was a Saturday afternoon that we decided to trek to SF for a spontaneous trip. (spontaneous it was, good and bad) It was a pretty warm day for early April. Line was out the door, the usual. Like other reviewers have mentioned they have a great variety of flavors. I expected salted caramel to blow my mind, but it was a bit too...salty for my liking. I expected more of a starbucks salted caramel hot chocolate. So we opted for snickerdoodle and toasted coconut. Both were faaaab. Single scoop on a cone for like $2.50? Beats 31BR anyday. Would definitely stop by for an ice cream fix if we were in the neighborhood. Parking is a little pain in the A$$ though. SF meter maids are ruthless creatures.

"Wait...what the...oh hell no." My thoughts as I drove down 18th and AROUND the corner to Delores street gazing a the monstrosity that was the Bi-Rite line. ÊMy girlfriend had spoken nothing but good things about the Bi-Rite, and was excited in being able to finally take me. My anger reached its apex though when it took me 15 minutes to find parking and I ended up walking 10 minutes. It's a good thing that I love my girlfriend. It's another thing that Bi-Rite absolutely kicks ass. ÊThe line went quicker than usual, and I was impressed with their flavors. ÊWe settled on the Balsamic Strawberry, the Coffee Toffee, and the Salted Caramel Flavor, and sat ourselves down at Delores Park. I could care less really that the flavors are organic, but this was some great tasting ice cream. ÊThe Salted Caramel eventually melted and acted as a bit of a topping on the coffee and strawberry flavors, and each bite was great. Ê Definitely one of the best ice cream creameries in the Bay.

WOW! This place meet expectations. I was so stuffed after lunch but I still wanted to try this place, I only got a kid scoop, but the serving was SOO generous. I saw the guy expertly dig and shape the honey lavender into a perfect ball of sweetness. The ice creams almost looked like gelato, so smooth and creamy- with the right amount of sweetness. Extra stars and thumbs up to the biodegradable cups and the "pride sundae" to celebrate the gay pride celebrations the next day- I love it when local businesses really support their neighborhood :)

Treat Ice Cream in San Jose held the crown for the best Bay Area ice cream for me, and I'd heard so much about Bi-Rite, that it was time to see if it could take the title. After suffering the parking situation in the Mission, I wasn't going to just get one flavor. No, I got the Balsamic Strawberry, Coffee Toffee, and Earl Grey to eat there - and the Salted Caramel to take home. Earl Grey - It really tasted like Earl Grey tea, not just a hint of it, but it was like a cup of tea in ice cream form. Unfortunately Earl Grey Tea isn't the most exciting thing in the world - so this didn't really wow me. I was hoping for some other flavors to amp up the overall taste. Coffee Toffee - My favorite flavor. Bold taste, and chunks of delicious crunchy toffee, what's not to like? Balsamic Strawberry - Also very good, I was afraid it would taste like Balsamic Vinegar in ice cream form, which is a mildly scary proposition. But this was not the case. Salted Caramel - My second favorite. This is as good as everyone says it is, with a nice contrast between sweet and salty. Plain old caramel ice cream would be far too boring. Bi-Rite has very innovative flavors, but as far as quality of the ice cream itself goes, and execution of the simpler flavors, Treat Ice Cream is still the winner for me. But Bi-Rite is definitely worth checking out, especially if you want something different from plain old vanilla or chocolate ice cream.

Bi-Rite.....where have you been my whole life? ÊAfter a 10 min wait in line (not bad considering the park was full of picnics waiting for fireworks on a Sunday afternoon) we were transported to a sampling frenzy of every flavor they had available. ÊI chose the salted caramel and the brown sugar. ÊWhile the salted caramel is amazing....the perfect ratio of sweet and salty ...I was just udderly (ha - I crack myself up...) amazed by the brown sugar ice cream and the ribbon of ginger caramel running through. ÊIt is very sweet which is just how I like things! ÊOther orders with my friends included the sam's sundae (brownie goooooooood!) and the snickerdoodle ice cream (highly recommend if you love cinnamon). Ê I have a feeling we will be back very soon with coolers in hand to purchase some pints! Now I think I have to add bi-rite to my last meal request....

mmmmmmmmm I'd been to Bi-rite a few times before during one of those lazy sunny days in Dolores Park. I had the toasted banana and balsamic strawberry back then. I didn't get the hype but like everyone else, I stood in line on a cool treat on a hot day. Not until today did I fully realize the awesomeness of salted caramel ice cream. It was featured on a list of things one must eat in SF. So glad I did. I'll put it in the top ten list of foods I've ever eaten. Yes, that good. I'll have to wait in line for a scoop every time I go to D Park. minus one star for the wait.

Noting recent experience and the age of my original review, I think it's time for an update. Ê A recent visit into the parlor revealed there isn't a new "seasonal sundae" on the menu in quite some time. ÊThe selections were all the same as were the flavors available for the most part. ÊThe ice cream was very good, but not exceptional. ÊPerhaps it's just there is now some fierce competition in town and my tastes are more subjective now. ÊIt's certainly better than Mitchell's but Humphrey Slocombe tries harder and stays more fresh I think. I also recently tried their new soft serve. ÊI wasn't super impressed the first time and gave it a second chance to today. ÊI LOVE soft serve. ÊDairy Queen rules. ÊSorry Bi-Rate but you don't even rate with dairy queen. ÊThe choco/vanilla twist had very little of either flavor. ÊIt basically tasted like sweet cream which was ok, but I wanted both vanilla flavor and chocolate. Ê Once again me thinks location, location, location and a sense of take the money and run has gotten the best of what started out to be an outstanding place. ÊHate it when that happens.

Dear sc (salted caramel), I have a new favorite. ÊHow can I say that? ÊYes, I have been faithful to you since trying you back in 2008 but I dared to try something new (isn't that what life is about?) ...the brown butter pecan and oy, that toasted pecan against the gentle sweetness of the ice cream is what summer is all about. ÊThat and sitting in one of their available wood seats outside (love the organic wood shapes) with the sun shining. Ê Happy days. Never fear, sc. I still bought two pints of you for me & a couz.

I've been wanting to try this place for awhile after seeing that they had a strange concoction of the chocolate ice cream with olive oil and salt. My wife likes to collect different salts from all over so she tried Êthe "Sam's Sundae" it tasted good but I think it would have been better with a little less salt. But that's just me. The staff is very friendly and patient as I wasn't sure what I wanted. Luckily when I was there, the line wasn't too long. So I ordered a "Salted Caramel" sundae with some toasted almonds and my oh my it was awesome. I'm a fan of caramel so I had high hopes for this when I finally decided to get it. The inside is quite small and only has a few small tables, long bench seat against the window and some stools. Nice water fountain too. Parking in this area can be aggravating. I'll definitely be back here though if I get a chance.

MY FAVORITE ICE CREAM SPOT IN SF! Why its so good? The variety of flavors are unique and different from your average ice cream place ie, cold stones, baskin robins, etc..and also VERY VERY affordable. You are allowed to try flavors before purchase. My favorite: Roasted banana and balsamic strawberry. Sam's sundae and Brownie sundae (better than a pizookie!) are good if you want a large serving of ice cream. Its also enough for 3 people to share. Others Ive tried that are good: salted caramel, coffee toffee, cookies and cream, honey lavender (varies for some people), Riccanelas (snickerdoodle) If you have family from out of town bring them here. Lines are long at night on the weekends but they have fast service so you wont be waiting that long. I also suggest that if you are a frequent Birite customer to get their hole punch card because after 10 hole punches in your card you get a free scoop which benefitted me in the long run because at one point I was able to fill up 2 cards!

Although, somehow the staff keeps the line moving, without making you feel rushed when it's your turn. I've tasted a few flavors, but my favorites are the cinnamon with snickerdoodle, and the salted caramel. I also appreciate that they'll do two flavors in my cone, even though i always order a small. This place renewed my love of ice cream, and coming here is a such a treat!

I came here the other night after discovering Bombay Ice Creamery was already closed for the day. Like Bombay, they have lots of unique flavors (salted caramel: yum; ginger: pretty darn gingery, but still good; chai spiced milk chocolate: kind of watery and not as good as I'd hoped; mint chip: nice and minty), so I was able to fill my need for some good, but also different ice cream. I love that they use compostable cups and spoons and that they have ice cream sandwiches. However, I don't like that there isn't much room inside (and hardly anywhere to sit), that everything is just a bit more expensive than I feel it ought to be, and that they don't make milkshakes. If they did, I bet they'd be darn tasty. I'll be back though. I really want to try their sundaes--they all sound so delicious!

I just could not give this place anything higher than 3-stars. I had a single scoop of the toasted coconut and it just left me asking, "why so many stars?"

These people are so nice.* Where do they come from? I was trying samples and got guilty about it even though they use real spoons and not those sad wasteful plastic spatulas and was ready to order but the guy was like, "No, you should try this one too. And this one." Then I ordered and was delighted to find that a "single" scoop is actually *two* flavors, so I didn't even have to decide between lavender and salt caramel, which is an indescribable sensation in your mouth, drip drip. Then I sheepishly asked if they wouldn't mind filling up my Crystal Geyser water bottle with tap water (I'm on a budget, people!) and he said not at all, and his co-worker girl smiled at me not in a condescending, "I can't believe you're so cheap and granola-y" way but in a "right-on my green sista" kind of way, and I was so happy I nearly laughed aloud. *Okay, only on weekdays.

Only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because I'm a stickler when it comes to giving out 5 star reviews. I must absolutely be blown away by the food or product and in the case of Bi-Rite I was definitely happy with my purchase, but it wasn't life changing. Not like the gelato I had that one time in Italy. That said, Bi-Rite is a definite must-do for anyone visiting San Francisco. It may not look like much, just a tiny little ice cream shop by Dolores Park, but you'll notice it (esp on a weekend) because there's a long line out the door and down the street of people waiting for a taste of that Honey Lavender goodness. Prices seem decent - and I prefer my ice cream to be higher priced anyway so I don't buy it that often. Many of the flavors are unique, which I appreciate -- Coffee Toffee was - yum! - and I'm dying to try Balsamic Strawberry. A small cone comes with two flavors and it was something like $3.50. Perfect afternoon treat if you happen to be in The Mission.

As if we weren't full enough from dinner at Chez Papa, we came here last night for second round of dessert! (Yes, we are pigs! So what?!?!) Since my warm chocolate cake lacked ice cream, I justified myself with a treat at Bi-Rite! The flavors here are all so unique! I wanted to try everything!! I settled on a small scoop split between two flavors. 1) Chai spiced chocolate: YUM! I love chai, so this was my favorite! Chocolate ice cream was infused with spicy chai flavor and it came with chunks of chocolate. 2) Salted caramel: I had to get it of course. It was very creamy and sweet. I didn't taste too much salt, but I think that's a good thing. I also tried the Roasted banana. YUM, banana is one of my all time favorite flavors and this one tasted like real bananas. I tried the blood orange granita too. Tasted like the real thing! It was in the 50s last night and this place was packed! Definitely worth a trip here for ice cream if you're in the neighbor.

Salted Caramel and Chai Spiced Chocolate Chip. HEAVEN. I have for years been a loyal devotee to the fine food of gelato. I was skeptical when a friend raved about Bi-Rite and brought me to try it for myself. Since then, I have been a loyal Bi-Rite ice cream eater (and gelato when I'm outside the bay area). I even love the coffee flavor (Ritual Coffee Toffee). I NEVER EAT COFFEE FLAVORED ICE CREAMS OR GELATO. But those bits of buttery toffee and the perfect amount of coffee IS AMAZING. Another plus is that their utensils and cups are compostable! The people there are friendly too and will let you try big bites of whatever you want. Had a cookie there before too, that was tasty too. Brownie toppings were so good that a couple of days after I got my wisdom teeth out, I couldn't refuse them even then...

My friend Robert G. and I were discussing tonight how Bi-Rite might just be the best ice cream in the world (Italian gelato excluded because it gets to be in a category of its own) over a double scoop of salted butter caramel and brown butter pecan ice cream. Made with Strauss organic milk (which, if you've ever tried it, is naturally sweeter than other milks and it's one of our local dairies!), they have all sorts of exotic flavors (i.e. strawberry basalmic, ginger, and my favorite, salted butter caramel), make their own ice cream sandwiches from scratch, and even have a sundae with olive oil and salt as a topping... I don't know why you'd go to any other place in the city for ice cream.

It is so good we have been her three times in the past week. The line may look long, but it really only takes around 20-25 minutes which is totally worth it. We've tried the Sam's Sundae, Berry Sundae, and Banana Split Sundae. SO DELICIOUS. I could eat the whipped cream forever *drool*. You have to give the banana split a try. They caramalize sugar on the bananas so it has a little extra crunch which makes it absolutely heavenly. All the ice cream is so creamy and the flavors are so delicious--I'm drooling as I think about it. The prices aren't too bad either. $5-$6 for a sundae isn't too bad. The serving size isn't humongous but for the quality, it's definitely worth the price!

So, so so good. I had the roasted banana and chocolate, but I tried several other flavors. Everything positive that has been said is true. Clearly high quality and Êall natural, unlike the fake flavor extravaganza at Mitchell's. Yeah, I said it. Every flavor I tried was rich, smooth and full of flavor. I will say, though, that I was shocked by the cone I received: a tasteless, out of the box, cake cone. It was nasty and I threw it away (I had it on top of my cup - that way, enjoy the cone, but no rush to chow down on the ice cream before making a mess. I have a system.). I would really expect a place like this to have great cones - waffle or sugar, but not just cake out of the box! Yuck! Also, I felt bad for the server who got in a little trouble by two employee for making my man's serving too large. He must agree with some Yelpers. Ê :)

3 stars for the flavor and flavors of ice creams. I'm a big fan of the salted caramels. If you love salted caramel try fran's chocolates. She has the best salted caramels. Anyways, I liked bi-rite's flavor of ice creams, but the texture isn't all that. When I went there I got two scoops, coffee toffee and salted caramel on a cone. I also bought a pint each at 7.99 so I could bring some home to my husband. I thought the salted caramel was too airy and didn't have the oomph creamy texture that I like in homemade ice creams. It was more like a mousse ice cream. For the coffee toffee there were too many icy bits that made the ice cream too flaky and not cohesive and creamy. Also the toffee just sucked. The toffee bits were sugary soft bits. They should just leave out the toffee. I'd like to go back to try more flavors, but i won't be buying pints anymore until after i try them.

Holy shniekies, Batman! I'm not really saying anything new or profound here, but I just walked over for my first scoop of Salted Caramel. I took one bite and said, "Jeezy Chrizzy" out loud. That's good ice cream.

Two reasons I continue to live in pricey and foggy San Francisco: 1) My husband 2) Salted Caramel Ice Cream Move over, Mitchells. The gentrification of the San Francisco Ice Cream scene has began (in a good way). This place has the BEST ice cream flavor in the whole world: salted caramel. ÊSounds funky, but I assure you, it will be the best ice cream flavor you have ever tasted. Only if they had Dulce de leche, or queso or mango (not the sorbet kind) flavors as well...

Omg, they're so good but so fatty (I bet). I got a double size of the salted caramel and toasted banana, yum. I was so stuffed. Ê ÊI was stupid and read the menu after ordering. If you're a small eater, get a single because you can still get two flavors. Not cheap enough for me, but cheap ice cream is below even my standards. Ick for the wooden spatulas they give out to eat the ice cream. It's nice and reminiscent of childhood, but wooden products sets my teeth on edge (Blegh, it's on edge right now thinking about it.) Yay for the sugar cane spoon they gave me when I asked for a spoon, and for reassuring me that others have requested a spoon for the same reason. ooo, I also like how they use real, not plastic, spoons for samples. If you're really ambitious and want to work off those calories, just go Dolores Park right across the street (I suck at directions). ÊOr go people-watch like I did.

We all scream for Ice Cream!!! Well maybe, I'm a Mitchelle's ice cream snob.. I just love the long menu of flavors.. however since I love ice cream I try to not discriminate too much. Last Friday was total ice cream weather. A. and I decided to walk the franks in the hood and visit Bi-Rite Creamery. Always a line out the door... I order Toffee Coffee and he ordered some type of coconut... One lick of the Toffee Coffee and I switched.. A. has a MAJOR sweet tooth, I bet he'd put sugar on top of all his sweets if he could. :) Me? Well I always considered myself a sweets lover and I am, but sometimes too sweet is just that, too sweet.. That's what happened with the Toffee Coffee... tooooooo sweet for me.. A. loved it. The coconut ice cream was nice.. way better.. Mitchelle's is still my fav. :)

Oh yeah. I'll give this place 5 stars - without a doubt! 1 star = Salted Caramel flavor ice cream. Wow! So tasty, I actually crave it. 2 star = Honey Lavendar flavor ice cream. Definitely their #2 flavor. 3 star = Friendly service. Everyone was super friendly even tho the line was out the door. 4 star = They are open later than most ice cream places. 5 star = I got parking right in front.

My buddy and I ended up circling the area because as it turns out, there is NO parking in San Francisco. So three of our friends got out of the car and alas, I had to settle for whatever they brought me. I wound up getting their much talked about Salted Caramel paired with Coconut. The salted caramel was very exciting, it tastes exactly like it sounds ... sweet and salty. The burnt/caramelized sugar flavor was a tad overwhelming, but I still enjoyed it. The coconut was very creamy, very sweet ... but not the best complement to the salted caramel. I didn't really get to know you Bi-Rite ... I didn't even get inside of you ... But I think I loved you.

Salted Caramel Ice Cream - it does live up to the hype. ÊOn first bite, I was a bit surprised by the flavor, but a second taste reassured me that I liked this. Ê The more bites I took, the more it reminded me of eating the hard crunchy top of a yummy creme brulee. ÊWhat I find most interesting is that the ice cream managed to taste like a bite of creme brulee (both the cream part and the burnt sugar top part all rolled into one bite). Yumm. Ê Also had the Coffee Toffee today. I LOVED the toffee. I really wish there was a bit more of it. And the Coffee taste was really strong but in a good way. It is a quite pricey pint of ice cream ($7.99) and definitely an indulgence unless you've got a bottomless box of cash. ÊAnd if you have one, please let me know where I can get one too.

From the moment I got there until I finished my last bite of ice cream, this place was packed with people! We got a 2 scoop cup with honey lavender and salty caramel. I wasn't much of a fan of the honey lavender. At first bite, it wasn't that bad, but then the aftertaste felt like I was eating a plant, twig or something earthy and herbal. The salty caramel was bomb diggity though.The blend of saltiness with a bit of sweet caramel was exceptional! I'll definitely be coming back here to try the other flavors, since the consistency and texture of ice cream was also superb! **update** came back here and tried their "brown sugar with ginger and caramel" and "Ricanelas cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodles". The brown sugar was too sweet for my tastes, but the Ricanelas was heavenly! I liked the hidden crunchiness that was within it.

So I've lived in SF my entire life, and seen all the ice-cream shops come and go...To my surprise besides Mitchell's Ice Cream and Polly Ann's ÊI would have to say this is one of the best Ice cream shops in the city. Ê I love the salted caramel and Roasted Banana. It is the perfect remedy for a desert after a nice dinner in the Valencia or on Mission. Ê If you come here on a Sunny afternoon expect lines out the door, and be prepared to wait at least 15 mins...but it is definately Êworth it. Ê Make sure you get your frequent buyer card stamped on the way out, cause once you try it, you'll definately be back. This is a very American style flavored ice-cream shop so if your into classic Chocolate, Coffe, and Vanilla flavors...this would be the most ideal place to get it.

I have to say it was a very interesting flavor, super creamy and the salt side of it kept it from being too sweet. I was also considering the balsamic strawberry and honey lavender.

ÊNext time I go, I will sample each one before making my selection. I really hated the lavander, esp when it touched the other flavor and I got a taste by mistake. ick!

If you like melty ice cream, this is the place for you. I don't know if it's ever firm because both times I've had Bi-Rite ice cream I've been the circle-in-the-car-because-there's-never-anywhere-?to-park person and somehow, between my wingperson walking from the store to the car, the ice cream turns into really delicious, rich, complex soup. I love how spot-on the flavors are (banana tastes like bananas instead of the banana FLAVOR I've come to expect after a youth spent sucking on banana Now-n-Laters), I love that they offer non-traditional flavor combinations (even if this means that they don't offer anything involving peanut butter -- not sure if they just don't or if I've just missed their peanut butter days), and I love that you can get a teeny, tiny kid-sized cup of ice cream because JIMINY CRICKETT, that stuff is rich.

I'm not a huge fan of sweets, but my gf is. So we came here on a random night, and decided on the Salted caramel, and a Sam's Sundae. Sam's sundae may seem a bit weird, chocolate ice cream, sea salt, and olive oil. It doesn't sound entirely appealing but the combination WORKS. You get the smooth velvety chocolate, and the sea salt just enhances and confuses your taste buds, causing them to scream in pleasure. And then you get that fruity taste of olive oil. It's really intense and I'd suggest anyone to try it. The salted caramel is more or less on the same level as Sam's Sundae. The salt just brings out the flavor a bit more, kind of transforms what you normally think of caramel into something different. It's smooth and velvety, and a lot softer than other ice creams, but the reasoning behind that is the high sugar content, go figure. The lavender ice cream is pretty cool too. It's hard to describe but you kind of get a little minty aftertaste.

Passing Êthe line divider outside, I felt relieved that it was that easy to get some ice cream, assuming people line up out the door. It was 2 o'clock in the afternoon.

Took a journey to find some good ice cream today because it was mildly hot. I went with a few friends at around 9pm and as we passed by, there was a line out the door to the corner of the block already. To our surprised, the wait wasn't very long. It resembled Ike's Places' line but went by much quicker. Plus, I got parking right in front today :] I had heard salted caramel was good but I was never a big fan of caramel. I liked how roasted banana sounded so I got that along with Malted Vanilla in a cone. I must say, their roasted banana flavor made me go bananas! It tasted so fresh and I could really taste fresh banana. So GOOD. About $3.25 for a double scoop cone. Very worth it I was always scared of having two scoops on a cone though. That one moment you're too excited to lick and it just falls off. Good thing it didn't happen to me though. Gotta keep your head in the game! *NOTE: my friends both got sundaes and told me the ice cream was good but they add too much chocolate and it minuses points for them lol. Cone or cup should be just fine!

Bi-Rite is all-Rite! Salted caramel: one of the best things you've ever tasted Rincanelas (vanilla? with hint of cinnamon and snickerdoodle pieces inside): maybe the 2nd best thing you've ever tasted. The ice cream here has a great creamy consistency and nothing is too sweet or too bland = perfect! Service was pretty awesome as well; we must have sampled every single flavor, and the lady still had a smile on her face. Best I've had in SF so far!

I LOVE Bi-Rite! I can literally go there everyday, and I did for a month (sometimes twice a day!). Yes I have an obsession. Just thinking about the salted caramel and honey lavender combo is driving me crazy! That is really the best combo, or you can sub honey lavender with earl grey! The salted caramel is sooo good it tastes like the See's Peanut Butter Caramel Brittle Bar (i think that's what it is), but the flavor can become overwhelming and that's when a soft flavor like honey lavender or earl grey can balance it. Brown butter pecan is pretty bomb, the balsamic strawberry, the malted vanilla, omg everything was soooo good. And the watermelon sorbet. ÊYea when I first went, I literally tried everything, but I don't think they mind because they were super nice about it; and they give you a silver spoon to try the ice cream with (hooray! for being environmental conscious!). Here's the perfect summer day in SF, if weather permits: -You're going to need a beach towel, a light blanket, a book, magazines, and your ipod. Also bring a game or some form of physical activity. -Grab a sandwich at Ike's (beware lines are super long, get ready for at least a 45 mins (if you're lucky) wait; but trust me it's worth it. -Set up your spot in Dolores Park , eat your sandwich, read your book/magazine and listen to some music. ÊTake a nap. -Then go to Bi-Rite for ice cream. -Go back to the park, and play some frisbee or football. -Go to one of the many GOOOD restaurants for dinner; then take a stroll. -Finally before leaving, make sure you go back to Bi-rite again!

Bi-rite is always a fun spot to go with friends. I don't think this is the best ice cream I've ever had, but their Honey lavender is one of my favorite. It's really smooth and creamy, with a subtle hint of lavender, and just melts in your mouth. The servers are really nice and always willing to give out samples. If you aren't in the mood to wait in line, there is a take-out window on the side. Definitely give Bi-rite a try if you have never been, it's one of the best ice cream spots in the city!

Got to have Sam's Sundae: Chocolate ice cream with bergamot olive oil, maldon sea salt and whipped cream. The guy behind the counter also made his version for us which we actually thought was just as, if not more, yummy -- vanilla ice cream, caramel, bergamot olive oil, maldon sea salt and whipped cream. Also, the Salted Caramel ice cream is to die for. The quality of their ice cream is top-notch -- creamy, organic goodness!

The best ice cream, only one scoop left. Savory. My friends and I came her on a Monday night to see that the line was stretching around the corner. We had nothing else to do so we waited. And waited. And finally we got to taste the best sweet thing on the planet. Mmm salted carmel. I cant believe that was my last scoop, but anyway come to bi rite to try the salted carmel.

After hearing much ranting and raving about Bi-Rite, I decided to finally try it. ÊWOW! The ice cream was amazing and will definitely pay many more visits here!!! Ê SALTED CARAMEL wins first prize! (well for now, until I try more flavors) It was the perfect amount of sweet and salty combined. ÊAnd the texture was wonderfully smooth and had just the right amount of creaminess. ÊAfter finishing my scoop, I went back and purchased a pint for $8, pricey, but all worth it! After waiting in the long, expected line, it was finally my turn. ÊAlthough the wait was not so bad, as it was my first time and needed that time to decide upon the numerous, unique flavors. ÊThe workers were very nice as i asked to try more than two samples! ÊIf i could, I would have tried a mini spoonful of all flavors! Ê Flavors I sampled: Ê -Honey Lavender (pretty good, would buy a pint) -Roasted Banana (not what I expected, maybe it needed more banana flavor) -Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl (was good, but wanted more brown sugar flavor than ginger) -Malted Vanilla (wins the pretty good award) It is a plus that Bi-Rite uses natural, organic ingredients as well as the metal spoons for samples, instead of creating more trash with plastic. Ê Always fun, is the unique variety of flavors offered. ÊI already know what I am going to try next- Earl Grey, Orange Cardamom and Mint Chip just to name a few. Ê Overall, it was a great experience. ÊOnly thing is the line and lack of space to eat the ice cream. ÊThere were some seats, but all filled and had to squish in with other visitors. ÊI wish the seating area looked more like a "cute ice cream shop" where I can sit and enjoy my treat. ÊAlso, the parking is horrible! ÊI had to be dropped off to enjoy the ice cream myself! Ê Besides these downsides, Bi-Rite deserves 5 stars for its product!

The workers here are so goddamn nice! I think I tried half of the flavors they offered because I couldn't decided. I ended up with the Salted Caramel and something with Pecans in it. LOL. The salted caramel was too strong for my liking, but with the pecan ice cream it balanced out the flavored. Definitely 5 stars worthy. Awesome customer service and unique delicious flavors. I'll be coming back when I'm near Dolores park again.

The snicker doodle ice cream is hands down the best cookie flavored ice cream I've ever had (cookies and cream doesn't count since it's more of an ice cream flavor than a cookie flavor). This place is pricey (low scoop size to dollar output ratio), but you can taste the creamy quality in the ice cream so it's worth it. They are adventurous with the flavors but don't really rotate them often. The people behind the counter are kind and happy to help you sample several of their flavors. I have mixed feelings about the cookies and cream here. For comparison, the standard goodness is Dreyers in my book. The flavoring of Bi-Rite's is actually better. But then you know how in Dreyers you can get those cookie chunks and no matter how old you are, you get a giant child-like smile on your face when you find one? Well, I got one of those in my cookies and cream here and I smiled, but then I bit into it and my childhood memories got smashed. I expected the cookie chunk to be great seeing as how the flavoring of the ice cream was so creamy and well cookie-balanced, but it was bleh. Not spit-out or avoid the rest bad, but just not good either. All-in-all, they serve up a creamy indulgent dessert . And although I can't see myself frequenting this place, I would stop by again if I was in the neighborhood.

I normally try to visit a restaurant more than once before I write a review, however the ice cream here is good enough to warrant an immediate response. Expect a lengthy search for parking ( as with anywhere else in SF) and a long waiting line - we visited at 10:00pm on a cold night and there was a line. Once you get past those minor problems, you are treated to quick service and tasty ice cream. The staff are friendly and allow you to sample flavors before you decide. After trying many odd sounding flavors I decided to go with Ricanelas (Cinnamon with snickerdoodles and homemade caramel sauce). Where do you even come up with that combination? Doesn't matter. It was amazing. The ice cream is creamy and clearly homemade - not some factory made repackaged nonsense. They have the usual suspects such as chocolate, mint chip and the like, but do yourself a favor and try the unique flavors like honey lavender and roasted banana. The city favorite seems to be salted caramel, and with good reason.

So this place has like 1000 reviews that tell you how incredible BiRite is and why you should come here, so why write another review? Because this place is awesome. Even from the line outside (which can get long on nice days), you can smell the creamy goodness that is taking place inside. With flavors of ice cream ranging from Delicious to Exquisite (maybe a maple pecan something or other somewhere in the middle), you'll never be disappointed with their rotating selection of flavors. Go see Andrea while you're there - if you leave grumpy after talking to her, there's no hope for your soul. Oh, there's also plenty of tasty treats you can buy inside from cookies to cakes made from local bakeries. There's really no way you can leave unhappy after walking into BiRite. Unless you're the devil.

Fantastic! ÊLocal friends brought me here on a "short walk," and, apparently from the other reviews, it's a good thing we made it there before 10! Actually, when we got there at 9:30 on a Monday night, we didn't have to wait at all. ÊThey offered up free samples of whatever we wanted to try, but as soon as I had the salted caramel I knew that's what I wanted. A friendly smile & a beautiful friend also got us into the reserved for employees only (wink, wink) restroom, which was nice to have in that kind of non-retail area late at night. The prices aren't cheap, but I was born in the 70s and grew up with Thrifty's ice cream at 15c a scoop, so, I guess since I'm working now I can afford $4 something for 2 scoops of ice cream.

This past weekend I came here twice. On Saturday I waited 15 minutes outside in the boiling hot weather to order a single scoop of honey Ê lavender ice cream. Apparently, for a single scoop of ice cream you can choose two scoops of flavors but my friend only ordered me two scoops of the honey lavender for $3.25. She herself ordered a scoop of honey lavender and toasted coconut. The honey lavender was too sweet but it has a very strong and aromatic lavender flavored. After eating that I was in desperate need of water to wash the sweetness down. I managed to taste a small nip of my friend's toated coconut and it is excellent. The texture of the ice cream is very creamy and with flakes of toasted coconut that really enhances the flavoring. Best of all it was just right--not too sweet. After the bay to breakers on Sunday, I went again and waited 20 minutes this time to order a single scoop--toasted coconut and balsamic strawberry. ÊThe toasted coconut once again was delicious. The balsamic strawberry is also very tasty with a heavy strawberry flavoring and a little bit of sourness. I ordered the coconut on the bottom and the strawberry on the top of the cup and it was divine. The strawberry really enhances the flavoring of the coconut so neither flavors would overrided the other making it one fabulous combination.

"LEGEN...wait for it, wait for it...and I hope you're not lactose intolerant because the next part of that word is DAIRY. ÊLEGENDARY!" I'm not a huge ice cream lover. ÊI don't go to the store to buy ice cream, and I don't really care whether my freezer has ice cream or not. ÊI'm usually not the one to eat it. ÊPretty much the only place I eat ice cream is Ghirardelli when I'm giving someone a tour of SF. ÊWell, that was until I found out about Bi-Rite Creamery. First time I went I got Cookies N Cream (to be safe) and then Roasted Banana. ÊCookies N Cream was almost the same as any other, but when I tried Roasted Banana, OMGWTFBBQBANANA! Heavenly. ÊI've been to Bi-Rite two other times after that and have always gotten this plus one other flavor. ÊMy friends have started tallying how many people like Roasted Banana vs Salted Caramel. ÊCan't say I'm a fan of Salted Caramel, but to each his own. ÊSo far, Salted Caramel is winning. The second time I went I tried Honey Lavender with Roasted Banana. ÊOf course the Roasted Banana was good, but the Honey Lavender was...INTERESTING. ÊNot bad, but not something I'd like to have again. ÊIt sort of tasted like how I'd imagine Febreeze's lavender aroma would taste. Third time, again Roasted Banana, but the second flavor was Cherry Almond. ÊIT WAS DELICIOUS. ÊIt really is just almond and cherry flavor mashed into one delicious ice cream. Ê The service there is also really great. ÊThe servers are always smiling. ÊI picked up a "Buy 10 get 1 free" card because i know i'll be going there very often. Ê ÊParking is a little difficult closer to the weekend. ÊWeekdays between 9 and 10 it's quite easy to find parking. GO TO BI-RITE. ÊTHEY HAVE AWESOME ICE CREAM. I'm probably going back here tonight haha. EDIT: I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news. ÊI just found out today that Cherry Almond is a seasonal flavor! ÊSo what with cherries only being available during the summer, it turns out that CHERRY ALMOND IS ONLY AVAILABLE IN JUNE/JULY! ÊRemember this, mark your calendars for June/July 2010. ÊGO TO BI-RITE. ÊMUST TRY CHERRY ALMOND. ÊEven if that means coming back from your summer vacation in Hawaii or Cancun or whatever. On the other hand, Balsamic Strawberry is delicious.

First time here yesterday and the line was long! But it was worth the wait. It's been forever, since i've been able to have some homemade ice cream with high quality ingredients. The service was very friendly.. which was surprising because even though the line was out the door and around the corner, they seemed to greet every customer with the same energy and eagerness. I had the honey lavender & Roasted Banana. The roasted banana was really good & the honey lavender had a weird first taste.. really florally, but then it got pretty good after the first initial shock of the taste buds. The flavors are definitely unique and I hope to come back soon to try out the rest =)

Yes, I jumped the food network bandwagon and found out about this place on Best Thing I Ever Ate. Had Sam's Sundae and wow. This is a sundae for those with advance palettes and can appreciate new things. The olive oil was citrusy and delicious, and so unlike olive oil that I had to remind myself of what it was a few times. The salt intensified the chocolate ice cream, and the citrus was creamy and unexpected. All around delicious and I can't wait to come back! Then I came back, before I posted this. Salted Caramel.

Sweet and savory is the new john and yoko. At least bi-rite would have me think so.

I think one of the biggest draws to bi-rite creamery is the unique combination of flavors. The ingredients, of course, are fresh and organic, but I think it's the pairings of these ingredients that make bi-rite a stand out. They aren't the run of the mill flavors you would find at any other ice cream place....I love the balsalmic strawberry, creme fraiche (tastes like tart yogurt) and the ricanela (tastes like horchata!). They also have several other unique flavors such as lavender honey, roasted banana, black cherry almond. All good, but I would taste a few before settling on one....for example, though good at first bite, I definitely could not eat an entire cup of lavender honey. The one downside? Kinda pricey....but what is not in SF?

I'm usually pretty critical of a place when I first try it, but for the first time in a long time, I didn't say anything negative about a place. ÊNow that has to mean something! ÊAfter finishing my single size cup with two flavors, let's just say I couldn't stop talking about how great it was. Don't tell anyone this, but I had previously been stalking Bi-Rite for the last several months. ÊSo when I came in, I pretty much knew from the start what I was going to order. ÊI knew that I was going to order the Salted Caramel and the Roasted Banana flavors. ÊBut I taste-tested them both just in case (some people complained about the Salted Caramel being salty, but it definitely wasn't!). Both were sooo flavorful and scrumptious. ÊThe Salted Caramel has this burnt taste that's almost indescribable. ÊMy sister said it tasted like coffee, but I didn't think so. ÊEither way, it was delicious. ÊThe Roasted Banana was perfect. ÊI think next time I might just get only that flavor. ÊI was expecting chunks of bananas (which would also be pretty tasty), but instead I got rich, creamy banana-y goodness. ÊI even saw banana seeds, so it was definitely fresh/natural. Great place!!!! And I followed the advice of other reviewers, who said to Ê get your ice cream and then go eat it at Dolores Park. ÊDo it!! ÊThe park was so gorgeous, especially on a nice, sunny day like today. ÊThe rolling hills were amazing and great for people-watching. ÊI bet they could've held Woodstock there...

I finally tried the icecream here and let me tell you, it definitely lived up to my expectations. Its never fun when places disappoint after hearing all the hype and I was not at all disappointed with my 2 scoops of Êdeliciousness. Here's how the story went: Once upon a time, it was a warm, sunny Sunday in the mission, and so obviously I thought to myself, this is the perfect day for icecream. Luckily Bi-Rite was only a few blocks away. When I arrived, there was a line out the door, but it moved fairly fast.

I discovered this place when I had lost my job and needed some sweet & fattening love. I love this place. It's always a long wait...maybe 30 minutes, but to me the Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl is so so SO worth the wait. It's one of those places where you have to put a lot of thought into whether or not you want two scoops, and if you decide on two scoops, do you get two scoops of your favorite or do you venture out. Then if you venture out, you need to put thought into what you want the last taste & texture to be in your mouth. It's a science with wonderful results. Mmmm. The salted caramel really is delish as well. Yum. Now that I'm working again and not gallavanting all over the Bay Area in unemployed bliss, I don't get to enjoy this as often, but now it's an even more special treat.

When I walked in yesterday at 7pm there were only two people in front. ÊI sampled the lavender honey which was a little too sweet for me. ÊI didn't really taste the lavender, but the honey was pronounced. ÊI ended up getting the vanilla malt, which has peanut butter toffee and milk chocolate. ÊIt was perfect! The toffee provided a great crunch and the combination was delicious. ÊWhile it was indeed good, I think it's a bit over rated because I feel that I've had ice cream just as good else where.

I'm lactose intolerant. Understand what that means for me when I a) love icecream b) dislike the taste of soy c) live around the corner from bi-rite creamery. It means that way too often I suffer stomach cramps because I *need* to consume all the amazing flavours you can get from here. On top of that the price is completely right. I always feel under-charged. I mean - I just purchased a huge amount of oral goodness and I've change from $5!!! I don't want to go into which flavours are best, etc - just accept that you can get anything (especially the salted caramel) and be extremely happy (especially if you had the salted caramel).

The second time I had bi-rite, it was in October and I got the melon sorbet and honey lavender, both, which were splendid flavors for the hot Indian summer San Francisco receives every fall. Light, aromatic, and not too creamy, they were perfect. The third time I came was two weeks ago with my cousin. She was a bi-rite virgin so I brought her so she could become de-virginized. She immediately loved the flavor names and decided upon the honey lavender and chocolate, while I got the salted caramel and earl grey. I had the salted caramel and always love it each time I try it, however that night Mr. Earl Grey stole the show with his lovely aromatic and very close to tea taste. I LOVED every single bite of it and wished I had gotten more. Thank God it is only a bus ride away because now I won't have to fret!

New place, new dining room table, thought I'd initiate it with a lovely homecooked dinner for me & my BF. First, a late morning shopping orgy at Bi-Rite market (does anyone else spend $100 just walking in?), then across the street thinking to pick up dessert. We were early but figured it was worth waiting outside for 10-15 minutes for the place to open. ÊNice that the guy didn't mind how we were hovering and staring and drooling. Salted caramel... worth waiting 10 YEARS for. ÊPerhaps the best ice cream flavor EVER. Ê How do I buy the 5 gallon bucket?? Balsamic strawberry... a nice strawberry ice cream but um... at risk of incurring the wrath of Yelp... where's the balsamic part? Ê I think all other flavors will be ugly stepsisters to the Cinderella of Salted Caramel, but I'm going to have fun tasting them all to prove it.

Screw you if you dont think this ice cream deserves 5 stars. You need to get your taste buds re-wired! Just the other day had toasted coconut with roasted banana and it was HEAVEN. All the organic shiznit they use is a huge bonus. Plus super friendly staff and super awesome location. WHY ARE YOU READING THIS REVIEW!? JUST GO TRY SOME NOW NOW NOW!

Business at the Bi-Rite Creamery has gotta suck these days with the howling wind 60 degrees or less temperatures all day and night, one of the last things I want is something frozen. Jeeze. There, now I feel better. The ice cream is made with love, tenderness, and the best *&%$ ingredients possible to put in sweet and savory frozen cream products. You think they are saving money this summer on their freezer costs? I am very partial to the coffee toffee flavor. And anything with chocolate in it.

GOOD UNTIL THE LAST LICK..... shut your face??!!! really!!! (3.5 - 3.75 stars) their shirts for sale sure had me cracking up. this creamery is known in SF and i decided to give it a whirl on a latenight outting with friends. its late, barely a line. when we walked in i told everyone in line "i'm going to be adventureous and daring and ordering something without trying anything". HONEY LAVENDER ICECREAM - i skipped the spoon tasting and just ordered a cone scope of Honey Lavender. I kind of felt like i was licking soap, you know, you associate lavender with (dish) soup. it was creamy, smooth, and sweetened by the honey. enjoyed it but towards the end i was sick of the taste and tossed it. Obviously, it wasn't good until the last lick. Afterwards, all the other flavors i can already imagine what the tasted like. no suprise. but i did inquire another flavor "Balsalmic Strawberry". i asked to try it and it was delicious. wish i ordered that instead of the honey lavender. I didnt even taste a hint of balsalmic, it tased like strawberry. not creamy strawberry as i feel the balsalmic probably canceled the creamy out. i enjoyed this place. however, i've tried better icecreams in SF. - ambiance: small, only 10 people can be seated... maybe not even 10. - price: affordable - taste: yummy. better then avergage but lower then the best will i be back? you bet.... this time for Balsalmic Strawberry Until the next review....

FINALLY! ÊI'm born and raised in SF and had never gotten around to trying Bi Rite until last night. ÊI've tried a few times but the has always been insane. ÊBut finally last night, the gods smiled- there was a line of only four people and a parking spot right in front Ê**alleluia** I sampled three flavors, roasted banana, almond fudge and ricanelas, before deciding on the ricanelas. ÊThe guy helping us was very nice and encouraged us to try as many flavors as he wanted. ÊMy date also tried three before deciding to order the Brown Butter Pecan.

I was in town and made it into this spot with my friend and had the Sam Sundae that i had heard about on food network. The chocolate was really good and the fresh whipped cream; the sundae did include a citrusy olive oil and sea salt added on top, so it was a diff type of sundae nothing usual, but it was different n we both enjoyed it, parking was near, and ur right across the street from dolores park. overall: would go bck.

Having already noted Slocombe, Smitten, and Ici plus spending substantial time in the Mission it seems only logical to conclude my comments on San Francisco Ice Cream (for now) with the most famous of all - Bi-Rite Creamery, an offshoot of the lovely Bi-Rite marketplace down the street and yet another purveyor of frozen treats made locally, sustainably, and with Straus Family Dairy milk. Arriving at the small store just short of dinner time I found myself greeted yet again by a relatively short line of about ten and with four folks working the counter it would be perhaps five minutes before I found myself in front of the case being asked not what I wanted to order, but what I'd like to sample as though they read my mind. ÊAgain knowing what I'd come for but wanting to take a couple of tastes I started Balsamic Strawberry and Honey Lavender, the first a slightly tangy take on rich strawberry ice cream and the second reportedly created with organic dried lavender and honey that is gathered in Sonoma especially for Bi-Rite the profound sweetness honey suspended in cream with a faint top note of lavender that perfumed the sinuses more so than obscuring the honey; it was good enough that I almost changed my preconceived order and to an extent I wish I had - at least half of it. Beginning first with the Salted Caramel - certainly Bi-Rite's most famous flavor - the texture was expectedly creamy and the flavor rich and sweet, but overall I have to say it was simply too much salt and not enough caramel. ÊHaving tried myriad iterations of this classic (and still uncertain as to who did it "first") the flavor of Bi-Rite's option fit somewhere between the impossibly smooth and textural Salty Caramel of Jeni's Splendid Ice Cream in Columbus and the Burnt Caramel of Toscanini's in Boston and although excellent it was not as good as either overall. ÊMoving next to the Ritual Coffee Toffee, however, I found what could potentially be my new favorite ice cream of all time - a dense admixture of Straus and Ritual teaming up to form a perfect latte flavor that was smooth as silk punctuated by crunchy bits of house made almond toffee that was sweet but not overly so, more acting to highlight the creaminess of the ice cream and the slight bitters of the coffee. With a price slightly less than any of the competition I tried and the taste and texture every bit on par or better I can say that overall the Mission is certainly the place to be for Ice Cream these days and while I'll admit my predilection for breakfast foods and sweets in general I can only assume that a scoop of Slocombe's Secret Breakfast and Bi-Rite's Ritual Coffee Toffee would be blissful.

Probably the best ice cream I've ever had! ÊOne thing you should know about this place is that it's very small and there is always a line but it is so worth the wait. Ê The main flavor to go for is the salted caramel. ÊIt's sounds different but you will not be disappinted. ÊIt's very smooth and just so good! ÊThey also make any kind of sundae you want.

This was my first time at Bi-Rite! I normally see a million people lining up outside this place, but on a lucky Thursday, an adventure buddy and I got there with just a couple people ahead of us. The workers there greeted us with smiles and was more than happy to let us try almost all their flavors with their metal spoons! How environmentally friendly! I first tried the eggnogg for the first time, and she warned me beforehand that there was alcohol in there, it was actually not bad! I ended up sticking with a single salted caramel and candy cane ice cream. YUMMM!! Soo worth the money and the wait!

Social proof! That's all it is! I was really not as enamored with this place as the other 3,000 reviewers were. I got the brownie sundae; the brownies tasted like they had been sitting out for days, the ice cream itself was garbage, like that white stuff you get in the big tubs at the grocery store. It was nothing that made me feel like i needed to come back for it, certainly not for 6.50 (and a long wait in line in a seedy part of town). The three other people I were with each got different specials and were equally unimpressed. I think my brother described his flavor as "poppyseed with motor oil and stale antler shavings." If you're a tourist and you want to say you've been to a place with 3,000+ reviews, perhaps you can give it a shot, but its utterly forgettable. Mitchell's (and Humphrey Slocumbe, if you're into the alternative flavors) are FAR superior to this place. If you really like ice cream i suggest you go there instead.

I feel really uncool but I gotta say that I didn't fall in love with this place .. everybody and their mamas seem to be fanatics, and I get why .. the flavors are pretty exotic .. and I did like what I got (orange cardamom) .. but I guess my taste in ice cream is pretty boring .. I grew up loving plain ol' vanilla ... and orange sherbert .. and I like my ice cream super creamy, which wasn't the case with my orange cardamom ... the almond toffee topping was fantastic though, just crumbled in your mouth .. same goes for the cone itself ... ice cream is like pizza .. we all have our own favorites, and no place is unanimously good or bad ... I prefer Mitchell's myself.

When there's ALWAYS a line out the door down the street, you know it's gotta be a good place. (Don't worry, I think the line moves pretty fast) They ran out of Salted Caramel and Ritual Coffee Toffee (kinda funny cuz we had just walked over from Ritual Coffee), so I ordered Honey Lavender and the Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate (wow that was a mouthful). The Malted Vanilla was definitely my favorite - SO AMAZING! I taste-tested Balsamic Strawberry (what a weird concept!) and found it to be pretty good as well, but not good enough to order. And although one of my friends really liked Ginger, I wasn't too wild about it. I got the single scoop (2 flavors) in a cup and couldn't finish it...but then again I just had 3 tacos beforehand so maybe that's not too surprising.

Few establishments that draw a crowd large enough to form a line long enough to turn the nearest corner ever serve something good enough to be worth the wait. Pinks in LA comes to mind. However, Bi-Rite Creamery's rich offerings were worth every one of the twenty minutes I spent waiting. Rather than behave like the pair of obnoxious, slovenly dressed Dolores Park hipsters that had to sample every ice cream before choosing, my partner and I decided to order 5 kid sized cups of every flavor that struck our interest. I highly recommend this, because ice creams we initially didn't like ended up impressing us as we finished them. Salted Caramel - lives up to its hype. Creamy, salty, burnt, sweet. Honey Lavender - a good flavor combo with an overpowering lavender aroma Orange Cardamom - too light on the cardamom, but otherwise good. Cookies & Cream - the best rendition of this flavor I have ever had the pleasure to lick off a wooden stick Toasted Coconut - light on the coconut, even lighter on the toasted. The only flavor I'd not order again. Get yourself some scoops and enjoy the people-watching.

I don't know if there is anything I can add to this that hasn't already been said! With over 1800+ reviews and an average of 4.5 stars, I think Bi-Rite speaks for itself. Check out this place in SF-- you won't regret it! Came here on a Friday night and saw the line outside the door and around the corner, but was happy to find out it moves along rather quickly. With flavors like roasted banana, balsamic strawberry, and brown sugar with ginger, what's not to love?! I got the balsamic strawberry and honey lavender-- the strawberry was sweet and very flavorful, and the honey lavender was absolutely yummy. Light, sweet, fluffy, with a hint of lavender-- perfect! As a college student in Berkeley who's tried Ici many times, this is my new favorite ice cream in the Bay Area. The flavors are just much more strong and flavorful at Bi-Rite. If Bi-Rite could improve in any one aspect, it would be their ice cream cones-- Ici's chocolate tip kills the competition.

IT'S OK... I've been hearing all the raves about "weird" ice cream called salted caramel, so i did some research and found Bi Rite Creamery with 4.5 stars average.. WOW that is very impressive, its a MUST to try this place out. so we did, and luckily there's no line. anyways, the cashiers were really nice, and introduced us to some popular flavors. the bf ordered Earl Grey - OK Roasted Bananas - tasted just like banana Honey Lavender - no thanks first off.. honey lavender is gross. unless you like eating soap or perfume. it smelled good, like a scented bathroom at a spa, but i didn't like it at all. (that's why i didn't order it ) i got the SALTED CARAMEL - too sweet for my taste TOFFEE COFFEE - OK tasted like coffee RANCHINELAS (uh i forgot how u spell that) - its good. when i first tried salted caramel, it was pretty good. salty and sweet.. but when it was in the same cone as the toffee coffee, i couldn't tell the difference between them anymore. both of them almost tasted the same, or maybe i could no longer taste the salt because of all the sweetness in the rest of the ice cream. don't take me wrong, i will come back... just not as often and definitely not going to waste my time driving across the city/look for parking and wait in ridiculously long line for this.

To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of ice cream. But Bi-Rite definitely has done something right. There's always a huge line out the door, and when you FINALLY get into the shop, cute vintage-style items are neatly lined in display (including their sugarcane cola). They use REAL spoons to let you taste whatever your heart desires. Their salted caramel is delicious... perfect amount of saltiness and sweetness. I actually really liked their Earl Grey... kind of like an English twist on the green tea. But my heart goes to mint chip... your good ol' fashioned mint chip with refreshing mint and the perfect bitter-sweet chocolate combination. Last time I had it, it was a sunny Sunday afternoon after lounging at the nearby park. Perfect.

I'm not completely impressed with this place. It is over-hyped for me. I give it 3.5 stars. Monday night 9:30pm and there's a line! How is that possible? But yes, I waited since I was already there. So I made the best of it by tasting a lot of flavors: - Balsamic Strawberry (the favorite of the set, it was a creamy strawberry. didn't really taste the tang of balsamic) - Salted Caramel (bleh. didn't like this one despite the knowing what it is.) - Honey Lavender (this was nice but i don't like lavender) - Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces (a little too sweet) A small cup gets you 1 to 2 flavors. A middle size cup gets you 2-3 flavors. And so on. I ended up not liking really any one flavor. Very sad, so I randomly picked 2 for my cup of $3.25 or something like that amount. Deflated, I took my cup of sweet cream, with brown wooden paddle as spoon and sat by the bench around the tree to eat it. I will say the texture of the ice cream is super creamy and smooth, rich with fat and little overrun (that means air). So to that I say 'yum' but the flavors didn't do it for me. I'd rather go to Marco Polo for black sesame.

Salted Caramel. The most amazing ice cream I've ever tasted. Ohhhh yes, better than Mitchell's or Cold Stone or whatever other popular ice cream place there is. Bi-Rite got it Right. Ok so honey lavender is pretty good too... and peanut butter and all the other flavors. Not to mention the toppings. Extra points for being green. But really, it's all about the Salted Caramel.

The place generated such a buzz during the day that I just had to make a stop before I left S.F. Ê It was fairly quiet at night, with only two other patrons in the store. ÊI had time to ogle at the glass case and eat some samples before settling on a single scoop of half balsamic strawberry and salt caramel. The portion was extremely generous. The creamy texture of the salt caramel became more pronounced as I worked through it, and the flavor was just okay. ÊHowever, the balsamic strawberry was a delicious treat of strawberry base and inkling of balsamic flavors. I really want to try the sundaes next time I'm in town.

We were in town for 2 and 1/4 days.. We came here 2 TIMES.. THE LINE took up one entire day (kidding kidding-kinda) The flavors are listed outside the door, so you can start the brain wrenching decision of picking a flavor before you get to the front, all of the workers were very friendly... Rad Flavors- HONEY LAVENDER GINGER BROWN SUGAR CARMEL SALTED CARMEL Yum.... and for someone who does not consume much milk, my tummy was totally fine with the small size.. I actually wanted 4 more...

Salt caramel bliss! This is a must taste, and it is delicious. However, in the spirit of excess, on our 2nd tasting, we brought a pint home, and proceeded to drizzle fresh caramel brought back from Brittany onto the ice cream, then garnished with yes, more sea salt. Divine. And while I am so happy to have this chilly outpost in the neighborhood, I must toot my own horn and proclaim that my homemade salt caramel ice cream (using Straus products and other organic ingredients of course) adapted from a NY Times Magazine article, is just a teensy bit better. But since I won't be selling it to you by the pint, you'll just have to mosey over to BRC for a scoop. The other flavors are all so good it is hard to choose. The roasted banana ice cream is so good - as is the chocolate made with Schokinag brand chocolate. Bring it on. The house made toffee is just that little slice of heaven. Ok, if you have been to Paris and sampled the amazing Berthillon salted caramel ice cream, you really have been to heaven. No doubt I think with Straus' quality milk and cream BRC have nearly reached perfection (minus Eiffel Tower). (I wish they would do soft serve too - hint hint!)

Sure, the Salted Caramel is amazing but people, try the BROWN SUGAR. My mind is blown. Love the usuals still: cookies n cream, honey lavender, ricanelas, etc but seriously BROWN SUGAR (not to be confused with brown butter pecan). I usually get the single cup which comes with 2 flavors. It is a bit on the small side but with me gaining some pounds lately, it's probably a good thing. Don't let the line scare you away, it goes fast (unless a-holes like me are trying about 5 different flavors).

I guess I know where I'll be making regular stops along with my visits to Dolores Park this year - Bi-Rite Creamery has got the goods for ice cream lovers. ÊVery creamy - delicious ginger, roasted banana and coffee toffee. ÊI tried 16th Street Honey something, and it was so-so ... but still had a great, creamy flavor. This place is pretty close to the corner of 18th and Dolores .... don't bother wandering down towards the Bi-Rite Market cuz the creamery is on the opposite side of the street and much closer to Dolores than the market. see you at the park with our fabulous Bi-Rite Creamery desserts this summer/fall! :)

If it's your first time, you might be a bit skeptical about the flavor, but once you try it it's a match made in heaven. ÊGuarantee. It's just undescribable.

Only Bi-Rite Ice Cream would make me trek halfway across The City, get off the elusive beast known as the J-Church, run through Dolores Park at night for a fix of Salted Caramel! ÊAnd the cool folks even packed my single scoop of Vanilla Malt in a pint container for the run to the J that I had to make to get home. All of the ice cream flavors here are tremendous. I haven't tried any of the soy creams, but after reading some of the posts here I will have to get them a shot. Ê So, what makes this place so sweet? Let' see: 1. Organic ice cream made here in SF 2. Local ingredients 3. Sustainable business practices (yes, BRC uses metal tasting spoons) 4. Great toppings 5. Sick toppings (Biscotti anyone?) 5 for 5 baby! I can see no reason to not give BRC 5 stars. Ok, so it doesn't have the menagerie of tropical flavors that Mitchell's' has but hey, do they feature organic ice cream? I didn't think so. ÊAnyways, Mitchell's' and Bi-Rite Creamery are entirely different genres of ice cream, in an "old school vs. new school" way.

The line says it all. The sundaes are a little on the expensive side, but when it's that good, you just don't give a fig. We stood in a line that weaved it's way round the corner for a good 20 minutes - the day was a hot one, but oh lord. getting to the front, everyone is just in such a good mood. It definitely helps that the guys behind the counter are terribly cute. I love that they have cool interesting flavours. I made my own sundae, something I would never normally do in a rational state of mind. Malted vanilla with peanut butter and milk chocolate, and SF cheesecake, hot fudge sauce, spiced pecans and almond toffee topping, and their homemade whipped cream. To die for!!!!!!! A whole $5.95. Going back to spoil my workaholic husband. UPDATE: Just took my burnt-out husband over there for a alted caramel whirl of frozen de-lite, and he is a convert.

About a week ago, I compiled a list of local indie ice cream places throughout the Bay Area and one in L.A. ÊWell some of you contacted me and insisted that I include Bi Rite in the list, otherwise my list wasn't complete. You were right, and I thank all of you. Ê I mentioned that Fossilman's chocolate flavor ice cream was an excellent stand alone flavor because of the balance between the semi-sweet and milk chocolate flavor. ÊWell Bi Rite is a notch above that. ÊThe best way to describe Bi Rite's chocolate ice cream is to describe it as an ice cream version of a Bittersweet Classic drink. Ê(Please refer to my Bittersweet review in either Oakland or SF) But I didn't stop there. Ê I actually ordered the brownie sundae. ÊFirst of all, the brownie alone was awesome. ÊThen their homemade caramel and hot fudge...WOW! ÊOf course I substituted the vanilla ice cream with chocolate. ÊHands down, the brownie sundae beats my standard Coldstone order of birthday cake remix...scratch that, no contest whatsoever. ÊSo what if I'm paying almost $2 more, worth it. But I still didn't stop there. For another $.75, they have a "cookie of the day." ÊTheir chocolate chip cookie is up there along with Specialties. ÊOn my next visit there, I'll probably try to pull a "Diddy Riese" and order two cookies and a scoop of ice cream in between. Ê The staff is extra-ordinarily friendly here. ÊIf it wasn't for the fact that I desperately need to lose weight, I'd ask one of those sweeties out.

This is a place where diets go to die. Bi-Rite Creamery has the most delicious and innovative flavours. Their ice cream's texture is perfect as well. Their staff always serves with a smile, despite the often obnoxious crowd barking orders at them. And if you ask nicely, they'll give you as many tastes as you'd like. The only downside are the long waits on a sunny afternoon and the occasional spoilt brat waiting in the queue. However, the honey lavender more than makes up for these drawbacks. And frankly, for another scoop of their brown sugar, I'd buy pants a size larger any day. Go. Eat. Enjoy.

Be still, my heart. At least, that would happen if I lived next door to Bi-Rite. Bi-Rite is hands down the best ice-cream I've had in my life. When I got to the counter, I asked what's the max number of flavors I can get in the largest cup. Of course i got the max! I shared this with my friend (kinda wished I didn't...). I couldn't believe how fresh and creamy the ice cream was. I pretty much licked the cup clean. Considering how long the lines were, I am also surprised to see how happy all the employees seem to be!

For girly girls, they also have these very cute wifebeater tank tops with "good to the last lick" on them. In a cool retro/vintage font, of course.

This place certainly deserves 4 stars for reputation alone, and the ice cream is indeed to die for. But unlike Mitchell's, it's equally legendary counterpart, Bi-Rite Creamery's line system is a mess. I can't count the number of times people have outright cut in front of me while I was standing RIGHT THERE waiting for the cashier. Personally, I don't think the shop's compact size is the culprit. Order can be introduced if you worked hard at it enough. One of those number-ticket things, ala a barber shop or Mitchell's, would really help. Some of the people behind the counter are friendly, even energetic. Sometimes, however, they barely look me in the eye when my order's being taken. I feel like I'm being processed, or worse, a distraction along the way of me forking over my cash. Best to end on a positive note: Bi-Rite Creamery, in addition to an impressive palette of flavors, also has some yummy cookies. And unlike Mitchell's, there's plenty of seats to enjoy your treat (treats, even?) outside.

Considering how many times I've come here and how many people I've brought here, I can't believe I never put in a review. Fortunately I've usually gone at late hours so the lines have never been killer. I'm a huge fan of the salted caramel. I tried the snickerdoodle, but I think I'd prefer to eat the real cookie. The ice cream has a very good, dense texture. I also enjoyed the lavender. I must admit I rarely stray from the caramel.

The first time I was here was on a nice summer day, but it wasnt very hot, so the place wasnt busy. Dont be confused by the other "bi-rite" signs, especially when you drive by. There was no line outside of the creamery to suggest that it was an ice cream shop. The service was nice and allowed me and my friend to try different flavors. I settled on the strawberry because it has become my bar for good ice cream. The strawberries tasted fresh and was very refreshing, which is a major thumbs up for me. It was creamy, but also has a bit of a tangy kick to it. Came in a cute cone. I didnt feel like a fatass eating it. The second time was on one of those unusually warm days in the winter months. There was a long line that was about to wrap around the corner for this place. I didnt order anything for myself, but shared the salted caramel pint with my friends. As it turned out, I dont think we had to wait in the line if we were just getting a pint! Darn. The Salted Caramel tastes much better than it sounds! It was deliciously creamy and wasnt too sweet. The salty taste wasnt prevalent as the name suggests. My friend raved about it so much that we had to try and it didnt disappoint. Awesome place to stop by if you're planning to chill at Dolores Park that's right across the street. The street is also pretty vibrant and lively on a nice day, with some nice shops, grocery shops, and restaurants around.

These reviews are part of a series where my Vancouverite friend wanted to try a bunch of food carts all weekend. ÊWe ended up deviating to some other cheap eats. The contestants: ÊLers Ros Thai, Fritzj, Adobo Hobo, Pizza Hacker, Gumbo Cart, Lumpia Cart, Bi-Rite Creamery, El Farolito, Bacon Dog Cart, Pho Garden, Zante's Indian Pizza This review is about Bi-Rite. ÊI'm not sure what it is about Bi-Rite that keeps me going back. ÊThe lines are long, the parking is terrible, the service is slow. ÊOh, that's right the amazing ice cream! ÊSo it's pretty common but I was first hooked on the salted caramel ice cream to the point where I would drive out of my way to the mission just to pick some up. ÊThen I started sampling all the other kinds and almost every other flavor there is pretty darn good as well. ÊEspecially the strawberry kiwi sorbet. ÊThe one thing I only thought was okay was their grape popsicles that are made from some farms grapes, eh, it was only okay. Ê The best thing I learned about this place is that you can cut through that long line and go to the nonexistent line to the right of that if you are buying pints of ice cream. ÊAnd with ice cream this good, OF COURSE, you're going to buy pints of it. ÊAlso, it's usually pretty chilly and crowded outside anyways so unless it happens to be a beautiful afternoon, I see no point shivering in the cold eating ice cream. ÊFYI, it you buy some salted caramel ice cream to bring home, it's meant to be extra soft because it has a ton more sugar than most ice creams so don't think that it's spoiled or anything. ÊHope this helps!

I have no idea why in my 30+ years of living in California, I experienced this creamery's delightfulness just recently. My entire family knew about this place. Knew how good it was, but yet failed to inform me of it. I had the roasted banana ice cream and salted caramel on a sugar cone. The salted caramel was good, but the roasted banana....there are no words to describe its perfection! With every lick/bite, you could taste the freshness of the real bananas in the ice cream. None of that artificialness. None. Zilch. Nada. In fact, the ice cream is so fresh that it was melting as I ate it. It made me sad because I sorta had to hurry up and eat the stuff and not be able to thoroughly enjoy my experience of this ice cream. One must venture out to this place at least once in their lifetime. Trust me. They have alot of unique flavors that warrant a head to the side like a little dog, but they do have some flavors that just make you want it instantly! Go Now! What are you waiting for?

Wow, this has got to be the best ice creamery joint in the bay area by FAR. Never have I actually been able to *strongly* taste exactly what is said in each ice cream flavor. Even salt in the salted caramel which wasn't exactly my cup of tea but all of the others I've tried (chocococonut, roasted banana, and coffeetoffee) were amazing. Coffeetoffee is my favorite of all time... I'd probably buy some in bulk next time :) The wait is not as long as ici over in the east bay because they don't go ahead to OFFER you a sample unless you ask for it (hint: because all of it's delicious!) One thing I noticed/LOVED about this ice cream was that it was at a perfect temperature. Not frozen solid so that your spoon can't scoop up any (without making the scoop tumble) but like ooey and gooey and sorta pull-y (?) ifyaknowhadddimean I love that the line moves quickly. seriously it's cold enough outside and i'm waiting in line for your heavenly ice cream. make the torture as bearable as possible please.

Perfection in the form of ice cream. Why haven't these flavors been around before this place? Also, someone needs to get these people on the mass production bandwagon so my fat ass doesn't have to drive down there to pick up some ice cream. Seriously though, ginger-brown sugar ice cream just wins on so many levels. The salted caramel is good too, but I really think they could rename that flavor molasses cookie. Whatever, still good. A little pricey, but for the quality, it's worth it.

YAAAAAAY! It's open during remodeling!!! I was showing my cousins around the Mission before heading to dinner at Delfina, when I saw that it was open! I thought they would be closed for half of March for remodeling, but I guess they are making good progress? They have added a couple of small wooden tables and seats for guests to sit and enjoy ice cream! They were still putting in the tables and seats when we got there. ÊSuch a good thing to do, since before all they had was a bar type set up with a few stools. That's all I could see from the expansion, maybe there will be something more??? Love, love, LOVE their ice cream! I like how they offer you samples of their ice cream in real spoons, instead of little plastic ones. So environmentally friendly! I'm a HUGE fan of the salted caramel ice cream! Just the right blend of buttery caramel and salt. I'm thinking of it again now... I've also had the earl grey tea and honey lavender. I'm a fan of earl grey tea, and this flavor was spot on! And the honey lavender had the right hint of lavender and sweet honey infused together perfectly. I don't know how they do it, but they just know how to blend their ice cream flavors so well, so that all the unique flavors they do have is not overwhelming, but just right on the money! No flavor ever overpowers your senses or leaves your mouth feeling overly coated and perfume-y. Bi-Rite creamery, you are doing some kinda wonderful thing!

Its good but not crazy good. Arrived around 1:45pm on a Wednesday, surprisingly their was no line. (although it was a cold day) The smell of freshly baked cookies roamed the air as I walked in, two friendly workers waited to take my order as I took everything in and stared blankly at all the choices contemplating on what to get. The workers were extremely friendly and patient they let me sample some of the ice cream so I decided to get what I sampled. I had the salted caramel and Riornal (sorry if its spelled wrong, I couldn't even pronounce it). The salted caramel tasted more like burnt caramel but it was good (expected too much) but the Riornal was delicious with a little crunch to it, (forgot what was in it), loved the little wooden chairs and really got this home feel too it when I first walked in. Soft, cold, with a melt in your mouth sensation but sadly it melted pretty fast. Overall It was a pleasant experience, burned off the calories of ice cream as I walked to Ike's Place to get my sammich, Definetly worth a try if your in town

Thick, flavor-rich, delicious taste of salty caramel, dense, textured, melting like chocolate, quenching my sugar cravings, very lightly and not overly sweet because it's salty... easy street parking just 4 blocks away, and a single scoop lasted me that entire distance while I walked on this gorgeous sunny day. The worst part of it?... I don't eat ice cream! They made me! They are that good!

I had plans to meet a friend at Bi-Rite Creamery recently, so I locked up the bicycle and was lurking around outside, waiting. ÊThe guy inside behind the counter said, "quit lurking around outside; you're creeping me out." (or something to that effect). ÊI explained I was waiting for someone, he said that doesn't make it any less creepy, and to come inside and start tasting things. ÊSo I complied, and he started handing me spoonfuls of things he thought needed tasting. ÊNow, people who know me know that giving me bites of things is the easiest way to make me adore you, but this guy didn't even know me. Ê The ice cream is amazing, they don't overwhelm you with too many choices, and all of the flavors they do have are spot on, so you can trust that whatever you get will be great. ÊLike their grocery-store sibling, they downright *encourage* tasting. ÊYou also don't have to feel guilty about liking your ice cream in bowls with spoons instead of cones (not that I know anyone like that...) because their bowls and spoons are compostable (make sure to put them in a composting can when you are done, not a trash can!) ÊAnd, finally, they give you a big, beautiful park right across the street to eat your ice cream in. Ê Now, with all of that wonderfulness, it's understandable that there can sometimes be a bit of a line. ÊWhich is why Bi-Rite Creamery is at the top of my list of places to hit up when most of SF is toiling away at their jobs.

I agree with all the 4/5-star reviews. ÊBi-Rite Creamery brings a nostalgic, old-time ice cream parlor feel that's spot-on with what the neighborhood wants. ÊMission hipsters might not have the money to eat at Delfina but they can go to the pizzeria next door and treat them selves to an affordable luxury that's now become ice cream. ÊAs a business guy though, I have one thing for you to think about: Ê ÊHow does Bi-Rite make all its money??? Ê Folks, it's called over-run. ÊOver-run is the amount of air that's whipped into the ice cream during the manufacturing process. ÊTake home a $9 pint of Bi-Rite ice cream and feel the weight of it vs. a $4 pint of Haagen-Dazs. ÊYeah, it's light as a cloud... Êso there's less milk per pint of Bi-Rite vs. other branded pints you'll find in the regular grocery store. ÊWith sky-rocketing cost of dairy, this keeps Bi-Rite creamery in business. Ê But what gets me is that Êpeople don't realize that they're sacrificing all this rich butterfat that makes ice cream so indulgent. Ê But does it matter when you can get flavors like "Honey Lavender" or "Creme Fraiche?" Ê This place is gold mine as far as I'm concerned. ÊCapitalism still lives!

The line is really worth it. And, if you at all can, get some to take home. You'll regret it if you don't. My hands down favorite is the honey lavender. The balsamic strawberry was really good too. I loved that it tasted like real strawberries, not chemical strawberry flavor. The salted caramel is good, the brown butter pecan was good (although I'm not really a fan of pecans). This place is worth it. Period.

GOOD! SO GOOD! SOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOD!!! did i make my point? Yes, this place has a line out the door on any given night and you can count on it if its the weekend. But it's definitely worth the wait if you really want ice cream, or something sweet after dinner. Their ice cream are all homemade so i don't think you can find these flavors anywhere else. I actually came here 2 days in a row because I had to get my hands on the other flavors! :P The Almond Joy Sundae is a good choice if you're into coconut, almonds, and chocolate. If you're choosing by the scoops, one scoop of the roasted banana and one scoop of the honey lavender is a great combo. Staffs are friendly and energetic, it made the environment fun! Ice cream and enjoying it right outside on the benches at night sets the evening right.

I Keep hearing about this magical ice cream parlor called Bi-Rite. Ê So i decided to take a little trip to try this famous place. ÊI was told there was always a line out the door. First of all there wasn't a line but there were many people showing up after I arrived. Ê Their single scoop is two little scoops where you can pick one to two flavors. I choose honey lavender and ginger for my flavors. they were refreshing for $4. ÊCan't complain about that. I went back another time and got one of their homemade Popsicle (strawberry) best Popsicle I have ever tasted! I was excited to see that their sampling spoons were real spoons (Environmentally friendly!) However, the servers were quite rude at times. ÊOne gentleman in particular talked to me in a condescending tone when i asked to try a flavor I couldn't pronounced and mocked me in front of the other customers. ÊOverall my experience was decent at most, if you can tolerate this rude individual (who is always there) than the ice cream is worth it! When getting a single order two very different types of flavors it enhances each flavor individually. you will not regret it!

ÊYes, on a hot day (and often on a cool night) you will find a line wrapping around the street corner, but don't let that sway you.

Okay this place is ridiculous. I've had this place bookmarked for the longest time and a friend and I decided to come here on a whim last Saturday. We looked it up to find the addy and it had a whopping 1711 reviews and now just merely two days later it's up to 1868. Ridiculous. Anyway, the weather on Saturday wasn't pretty but there is a line outside, like down the end of the block. Well okay, the place is almost at the end of the block but there were still a good 10 people waiting in line. Just plain ridiculous, this place. Luckily the line moved quickly. I got the balsamic strawberry and creme fraiche. The creme fraiche is like vanilla but much much richer. For anyone whose Chinese, it was like eating the white rabbit candy in ice cream form. The Balsamic strawberry was okay, the flavor was a bit more muted than i'm used to but it was probably because of the balsamic taste, whatever that is. I dig how this little ice cream shop makes their own ice cream, offers lots of interesting variety and does it the natural way, so I will probably be back.

The ice cream scooper was probably one of the nicest one I've ever met. He let me try like 5 of them, and yes, they give you real spoons! I don't know if getting ice cream for breakfast was the best idea, but I couldn't resist...I ended up with the Coffee Toffee, which tasted less like coffee and more like toffee. The coffee flavor was light but the ice cream was very sweet. Roasted Banana and Salted Caramel were strong flavors, but also very sweet. The toasted coconut was less flavorful. I should have tried some of the fruitier ones...next time!

I would *never* compare Bi-Rite to Humphry Slocombe. They're two completely different places with their own uniqueness. They're both equally fantastic. Ok, with the said.. onto the review :) This past weekend I did a food excursion in SF. In this excursion, Bi-Rite was a must stop. The way I had planned out my journey, Bi-Rite was almost my last stop of the day. Yet I would pass by it going from place to place (namely walking from Ike's Place to Bi-Rite Market to Tartine) and I would get more and more excited to get my butt in there for some ice cream. When it was finally time for dessert I couldn't hold back my excitement. Got in line, and though it was quite long for an ice cream place, it went by quickly. I read the flavors of the day and just couldn't decide what I wanted.. so I went with four different flavors in a cup. I had the Earl Grey, Roasted Banana, Coffee Toffee, and Salted Caramel. I loved each one of them, but if I had to choose a favorite.. it'd be Earl Grey. I wanted to get a pint to bring home, but wasn't allowed since 1) I was far from home and 2) we weren't headed home just yet.. and who likes liquid ice cream? (I really should have went with liquid ice cream to be quite honest :\ Oh well..) If you like HK style milk tea, then Earl Grey is the way to go. It was perfect. Wonderful full earl grey flavor with the perfect amount of sweetness. I dislike anything too sweet and think that Bi-Rite's ice cream is wonderfully perfect. It soothes that sweet tooth without giving you a rotten one. The other flavors were just as wonderful. Roasted Banana tasted just like it sounds. The wonderful caramelized banana sweetness throughout the creamy ice cream. Coffee Toffee: the buttery toffee enrobed in silky coffee ice cream. Salted Caramel: the savory slight saltiness matched with sweet caramel.. Utterly unbelievable flavors! Verdict: I doubt you can choose a wrong flavor here.. but for me, I will most likely stick to Earl Grey. Absolutely a winnar here! ^_^ PS. Ice Cream. Earl Grey. Cold.

I've been here... 3 times now? 1st time: Balsamic Strawberry and Honey Lavender. I was sick and stuffy, and these were the only flavors I could actually TASTE in my condition. But boy, was it delicious! Ever since... BiRite has elevated my ice cream tastes. I can't settle for $1 RiteAid ice cream anymore! I have to admit that I like BiRite more than Ici in Berkeley. The seasonal flavors offered have so much depth! You can always find a flavor to match your mood. And they don't run out of flavors by nighttime (this always happened to me at Ici. sigh). Plus, the lines have always been really short the 3 times I've been now. On the pricey side for ice cream, but very reasonable for the creamy quality and deep well-crafted, balanced flavors. Always a worthwhile treat for meeting with old friends, hosting out-of-towners and just because. :)

Afternoon Snack sundae is the best! Êroasted banana ice cream? ÊI thought it might remind me of that overly powerful artificial banana flavor but I was so wrong. ÊWith the homemade graham crackers, caramel sauce and whipped cream... equaled heaven. ÊI tried to make my own roasted banana ice cream at home but failed miserable in comparison to Bi-Rite. Sam's Sundae... I could only do two bites and I was done. ÊThis is very hard to eat all by yourself. ÊIf you are curious to try it as I was, you should definitely share with a bunch of people. ÊI love sweet w/ salty but with the addition of the bergamot olive oil and the richness of the ice cream, it was way rich. ÊIt's one of those things you just have to try once.

When bi-rite opened, I did not know what to expect. I grew up in the cold, but I would eat ice cream in winter, spring, summer, or fall. The first time and every time I have visited Bi-Rite I have loved there ice cream. My favorites are the salted caramel and the honey lavender. I have tried some of there soy and some of there sorbets, also interesting. I also had a peanut butter one that I liked as well. Recently, on my way to a barbecue, I picked up there cookies and cream ice cream pie. It was delicious. Everyone loved it. The flavors were right, there were enough cookies, and it melted in our mouths. Also, I didn't have to wait in line to get it. I just got my pie, walked up to the register, and paid. One drawback is the constant line. There is a ray of sun and bi-rite is packed. I am not going to criticize being popular, as they don't rush anyones experience and the line does move fast. I would certainly put this in the league with Mitchell's, Swenson's, and Fenton's.

I came here and the store was packed! A line was formed outside to the corner of the street. Very busy but they know how to get through everyone friendly and quick. I really wished I remember what I ordered... Something with Coconut and probably butter pecan? Whatever it was, it was still great! My friends tried the salted caramel, honey lavendar and other flavors, too... But whatever they got, they thought it was great and yummy nonetheless. :) Service was nice and organized. Store was clean. That's a good thing, because ice cream gets really messy and when it's messy, it really stinks. It's like the mildew or rotten food kind of smell. They make cakes, too! I didn't see any though. :\ I would definitely come back again if I had the chance.

Ê There's usually a line on hot days, but the wait's never been too bad. ÊSeating is very limited, so plan on getting it to-go.

Bi-Rite greeted us with a long line that snaked around the corner. But we weren't deterred, long line means that it is worth the wait. And oh boy, it did not disappoint! I got the Balsamic Strawberry and Creme Fraiche. My friend Allison got the Strawberry and Honey Lavender. And my friend Chris got the toffee coffee and chocolate. The strawberry was the strawberriest tasting ice cream I ever had! It has to be the balsamic that brought out the fruity tart of the strawberry. And Creme Fraiche tasted like my favorite dessert=Cheesecake! Therefore, my strawberry cheesecake combo was freaking amazing...it was Bi-mazing! The Honey Lavender that I tasted was also bi-rrific! I didn't get to the coffee or chocolate, but my friends thought they were bi-licious! Flavors I want to check out next time: Roasted Banana and Salted Caramel!

I normally do not like this which are either sweet or creamy. ÊNeedless to say, ice cream is not something I usually bother eating. Over here, I like the cinnamon ice cream a lot. ÊIt is less sweet than the other flavors and also has a good taste and texture. ÊI can still only eat about half a kiddie order, but that's more ice cream than I usually eat. Most of the other ice creams here are too sweet for me. ÊI can tell from eating them that they are high quality and have a nice texture, but I cannot eat more than a bite or two of most of them because of the sweetness. I also sampled the green apple sorbet, and I liked it. ÊI want to try one of their fruit popsicles too.

If heaven offered ice cream, they would serve Bi-Rite Ice Cream (and possibly Mitchell's Ube Ice Cream, heh). But seriously, it's good. My girlfriend and I came here during a mild summer day. The line wasn't as bad as we expected, but it was out the door a bit. All of the flavors on the menu sounded really good, but we went for the famous salted caramel, and honey lavender. Who'd have known that salt and sugar would go hand in hand so well? The Honey Lavender was really good as well! One of the most enjoyable things is to get an ice cream cone from Bi-Rite, then head over to Dolores Park and chill. Can't wait to do it again!

Have only tried four flavors so far -- Salted Caramel, Coffee Toffee, Earl Grey Tea, and Honey Lavender. Out the four, Salted Caramel is definitely the flavor packed one. It hits you right away, like you didn't expect it would so quickly. The Coffee Toffee is a bit bitter and carries more of the coffee flavor. Nonetheless, a flavor I'm likely to order again. Earl Grey Tea and Honey Lavender are both lighter in comparison to the other two I mentioned. The flavors are subtle, but definitely there. All in all, I loved all four. So, the ice cream at Bi-Rite is pretty good, but it's nothing I've never seen before around SF. Bi-Rite is in the very very busy Mission district. Parking is a literal nightmare. Last time, I came here I bought 3 different single scoops, for three different people. My boyfriend circled around the block like 7 time, looking for a parking space. And I came out of the store, juggling three freezing cups in my hands. I would have opted for cones, but I thought I'd have a harder time. It kind of killed my overall Bi-Rite experience, sad face. I really want to come here again, but maybe only on a weekday when hopefully, there's less parking issues!

Hands down, the best place in the bay area for ice cream. Try the Honey Lavender and Roasted banana flavors. The other flavors are superb as well, but those two are my own personal favorites.

Also fortunate it's not too close to the east bay or else i'd be gaining a lot of lbs.

4 stars - SF institution, creamy goodness, things to do If you haven't heard Bi Rite is the place to go if you want ice cream in SF. Itry to avoid crowds and lines because, frankly, people have no situational awareness anymore and are freakin rude; but, I will endure up to an hour in line at Bi-Rite to get a few scoops of this creamy, yummy goodness. Service is great and funny! They do their best to control people so you cant blame them. Perfect on a sunny day after a sausage party. Ample bike parking. Lots of stuff going on in the neighborhood. tips: listen for instructions, know what you want, have your money ready, leave the strollers outside, be courteous, don't be a jerk or else i'll dump my ice cream on your head. kinda got the feeling it's one of those places to be "seen at"

Salted caramel and toffee coffee...Orgasmic. I've never had more rich and creamy ice cream in my life. Perfect on a warm... Let's just say perfect on any kind of day. So go grab lunch at Tartine's or Pizzeria Delfina, get a cone or scoop at Bi-Rite and knock out from the food coma your going to get at Dolores park. Sounds like my kind of day.

I typically compare all ice creams to Ici's in Berkeley. I love those crazy flavors that somehow work out so beautifully! In short, Bi-Rite was for sure on par with Ici - I loved it! I got the Pumpkin and Honey Lavender. I love that Bi-Rite's ice cream is not too overpoweringly sweet. The pumpkin had more of a taste of pumpkin spice/cinnamon, which is a good thing in my books, though it's not represented in the name. The Honey Lavender was also fantastic - a dominant honey taste with a hint of lavender. Loved it, and would recommend it to everyone! :)

Two words: Honey Lavender. Okay, wait. I have more to say: It was my first time at Bi-Rite and I asked a woman in line what her fave flavor was. ÊShe offered Honey Lavender and Salted Caramel. ÊWell, I'll tell you folks. ÊThat Honey Lavender blew my mind. If you like really creamy ice cream, with a hint of something-something, you'll love Bi-Rite. The line moves decently fast even if it's around the block on a hot day in August. ÊAND, the girl behind the counter gave me another scoop when she saw that I'd almost finished mine before getting around to paying for it (it was THAT good!). Told me she couldn't have me leaving the store with a near empty cone!

I debated between 4 and 5 stars. ÊWith the creamery portion of Bi-Rite there are these detractions: it's too small, there's usually a huge line, the staff has always been consistently rather snotty, and every single flavor isn't astoundingly phenomenal. ÊMost are really wonderful, but three or four are just okay. Ê My highest recommendation to anyone alive on this planet who's not vegan or has a dairy allergy: TRY THE SALTED CARAMEL. ÊIt will change your life. Ê It certainly changed mine and what I consider the gold standard for salted caramel ice cream and what I consider partial heaven on earth and what I consider worth living for. ÊIt is a superior ice cream to all other ice creams. ÊIt is so perfectly balanced, with such intense caramel flavor, and the texture, oh god, the texture is perfectly light and fluffy and rich and creamy at the same time. ÊI could go on...I'll leave it at - it's one of the great loves of my life. ÊI don't know what I'd do without it. But so other flavors that I've tried and loved are brown butter pecan, creme fraiche, roasted banana (so good! Êperfect with chocolate sauce!), mint chip, honey lavender, and the snickerdoodle one. ÊAll fantastic! ÊHowever, the Mexican chocolate with salted almonds was actively bad. ÊBut, maybe it was just the batch. ÊAlso, the rituals coffee is just OK and the rocky road definitely needs more rocks in the road. ÊSo, one star off for inconsistency and service. ÊBut oh, how much I love you Bi-Rite Creamery!

EARL GREY TEA ICE CREAM! We've lived in the area for over a year now and Bi-Rite Creamery is pretty much the crown jewel of our 18th street paradise. We love the seasonal flavors like pumpkin and now earl grey tea! Bi-rite is arguably the best ice cream in the city. I'm a fan of Mitchell's and Humphrey Slocombe too, but those are two ends of a spectrum from homey, traditional flavors to radical and outlandish...and bi-rite sits squat in the middle, with more tame favorites like coconut, rituals coffee toffee, and mexican hot chocolate...plus their uniquely original ones like salted caramel and honey lavender. You MUST go by bi-rite if you're in the Mission or Castro, but watch out for the longer lines, even on cold nights at 9:50pm!

This is hands down the best I've ever had. The salted caramel is unreasonably good. Balsamic strawberry, ricanelas? Unreal. You could sell bi-rite ice cream to an eskimo with no taste buds. You need to eat this ice cream.

I was in the Bay Area this past weekend and my friend sugggested we go here for dessert. ÊSo we gathered the kids and started driving. ÊWhen we got there at 9:00 PM there was a big line and the parking was pretty much nonexistent....I was beginning to think..."I don't even like ice cream that much. ÊNo ice cream joint is worth the hassle..." ÊI was very, very wrong! ÊWe finally found parking, packed up and bundled up the kiddies and stood in line. ÊSurprisingly, the wait was not very long, but gave me enough time to decide what I wanted to get. My son got the vanilla which my son claimed to be the best vanilla ice cream he ever had! ÊAnd it must have been because he didn't want to share...which he is usually very good about. My SO got the coffee toffee with the peanut brittle. ÊThis was delicious! ÊThe coffee was not too sweet and actually tasted like coffee!. ÊThe toffee's sweetness offset the bitterness of the coffee perfectly! ÊIt really didn't need the peanut brittle topping. I got the burnt brown sugar with a ginger caramel swirl and salted caramel. ÊBoth were amazing, however the brown sugar was a little too sweet for me. ÊI really enjoyed the salted caramel!! ÊThe salty and the sweet combo is just to die for! ÊI don't like my ice cream to be too firm, I prefer to have it slightly soft so it's easy to eat. The texture of the ice cream was perfect for me! Ê We were standing at night, in the cold, with the winds of San Francisco blowing outside as we ate ice cream. Ê Funny thing...the ice cream seemed to warm me up...Would the owners ever consider opening one up in Long Beach....

Did you know stressed spelt backwards is desserts? Holy ice-cream. ÊI have heard the hype for quite some time now, and with some free Sunday time I took my butt to that infamous corner. ÊThe line was wrapped around the corner and I came to wait. ÊThe line went by pretty fast and before I knew it I was inside. The flavors are creative and exciting. ÊI was nervous about asking for samples but they give them with ease, even on a silver spoon! I am an indecisive mother so I opted for the three scoop bowl with three diff flavors (honey lavender, vanilla malt and toasted coconut). ÊIt was beyond delicious. Ê I left a very very happy camper, and just to note, if you ever want to run by and grab a pint there is no need to wait in line which is a total plus if you want to go fancy with the dessert when company is over and serve the to die for salted caramel.

Holy motherfucking donkey shit. ÊIce cream does NOT get better than this! ÊI remember coming back from a trip to Italy saying nothing could beat Italian gelato, when all of a sudden Bi-Rite Creamery opens up out of nowhere. ÊIt's like they're holding up a giant middle finger to all the other ice cream shops in the city. ÊHonestly, who makes ice cream this good? You cannot go wrong with any flavor, but some personal favorites include Toffee Coffee, Roasted Banana, and let's not forget the beast-status SALTED MOTHERFUCKING CARAMEL.

I'm pretty sure there is crack in this ice cream because I crave it like an addict! First time I had this ice cream, a friend had brought it to a party and OMG! I am not a huge ice cream eater but I swear I could eat an entire pint of this in one sitting and still want more. I literally couldn't stop thinking about bi-rite for weeks until I finally made the trip up to SF to get some. I bought 2 pints (Salted Caramel & Roasted Banana). Those 2 pints did not last long in my freezer and 2 weeks later I was up in SF again buying 3 pints (Salted Caramel, Earl Gray & Mint Chip).... you get the picture... I also managed to get the rest of my family hooked on this place so that now when we go up to SF, there is a bi-rite phone chain. We have to call everyone to take orders because we all need our fix!

Their ice cream shop and flavors are definitely one of a kind. I tried several 2 samples before I settled with the salted caramel and the mint chip. It's good, but got tired of it after a small cup. 3 stars because the girl helping/giving us samples was annoyed and she wasn't afraid to show it. Her attitude made my friends and I not want to be there so that wasn't too pleasant. Besides, that's part of her job.. She shouldn't work if she has that kind of attitude dealing with customers or first time customers in our case. Ê So my overall experience was just okay. It's probably not the best out there and isn't worth waiting in line for. I'd probably just go to Mitchell's to save all the hassle and they have always had great customer service!

ÊMost bodegas in the city have a good selection of vegan ice creams, and I can get a pint for about the same price as a cone at bi-rite. If there selection improves, let me know.

6 tastings, 3 generous scoops, and less than $5 later, I was sitting happily on a bench outside Bi-Rite enjoying my yummy ice cream (grudgingly sharing with J... good thing he doesn't really care for sweets...) and watching the critical mass crowd pedal by. Salted caramel - very interesting. Delicious when combined with another sweet flavor. Will definitely get it again Honey lavender - while I enjoyed this flavor (esp paired with the salted caramel), J thought it tasted like soap. It ruined it a little for me. I don't think I can get this again... will just end up thinking about lavender soap. :( Ginger - quite good. Wish it were a bit more gingery and less cream-y. Might get it again, but probably only with the salted caramel.

ÊThe staff is very helpful, more than happy to provide you with samples, so you can make an informed decision, and well, if it sounds interesting, you should try it, because it probably is. ÊI've had their Earl Grey, salted caramel, honey lavender, coffee toffee, and brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl. ÊAnd I've had the Sam's Sundae, which is odd sounding, but spectacular tasting. The ice cream has a wonderful texture, it's not over priced for the quality you get, and you can get more flavors than you'd expect for each size, so you feel like you're beating the system, which is always a good feeling. Ê Here's the kicker to spectacular ice cream. The servers here are very friendly, and make you feel very welcome and appreciated.

My first visit to Bi-Rite, it was 20 minutes before closing on a Saturday night and there were tons of people STILL in line. I didn't mind the line at all though because it was one of the most interesting lines I've ever had to stand in. There were drunks and crazies who were out for movie night at the park in Dolores Park and I got a chance to hear strange convos in that line. Good times! The line went by quick and I ordered the honey lavender & salted caramel. This was not a combination that I liked. I just didn't like the honey lavender, it just tasted, weeell...flowery. I did like the salted caramel and I do understand why everyone raves about it. Sometimes that bit of sweetness and saltyness hits you in all the right spots! We also tried the ginger ice cream and liked it. If you're brave enough, try it! Writing this review just made me salivate over Bi-Rite but they're closed at the moment. Damn.

WOW. One of the absolute best ice cream places in the bay area along with Mitchell's, Bombay Creamery (if you like original ice cream flavors), and a select other few. I don't like standing in lines outside of stores, but for this place i'll make an exception. ÊI've only been here a couple of times, but i'm in love. ÊI have a wicked sweet tooth and this place soothes it every time. The Banana Split...The blow torched bananas (and they blow torch them right in front of your eyes) are pretty awesome, as is the freshly made whipped cream. The Afternoon Snack...I'm not sure how long this sundae will be available since it's seasonal, but if i were them, i'd add this on as a permanent fixture. ÊThe banana ice cream and the freshly made graham crackers make this a dream...throw on the caramel and you have dessert bliss!

The line looks long, but it actually goes by pretty quickly. We waited 10 minutes when the line extended to the end of the block. The wait is worth it for the unique flavors and delicious ice cream. With a small cup, you can get 2 flavors. I had the salted caramel and malted vanilla with peanut brittle. I was very happy with my selections. The salted caramel has a rich deep flavor that I liked, though I wouldn't get an entire cup of it. They also have traditional flavors like mint chip and cookies and cream. If you just want to buy prepacked ice cream, you can skip the line.

I came at a time where there no line (~6:00PM). If you want good ice cream, come here. Everybody orders the Salted Caramel Ice Cream. However, I would NOT recommend getting this as I didn't really like it. I would also NOT recommend the Honey Lavender Ice Cream--it tastes like some sort of soap. I would recommend ordering the Roasted Banana Ice Cream. I tried these three flavors and the Roasted Banana was the best. Get it in a cone. $3.25 for a single scoop is a little much, but just about worth it for a unique tasting experience. I know this place gets super busy at peak hours so try to come during a time where there probably is not an influx of people.

ÊAlso tried their salty caramel and roasted banana after reading all the reviews but I didn't really care for those. ÊThe salty caramel tasted way too bitter and salty.

I'm docking one star because I had to come here FOUR times before I could finally get a bite of their deliciousness that is ice-cream. And parking is a major pain too. But other than that, when I finally got to try their ice-cream (after a 20 minute wait in line), it didn't disappoint. I got the earl grey and salted caramel. The earl grey was not too creamy or strong, and the salted caramel was the perfect mix of sweet and salty. Both left a very pleasant after taste. Can't wait to go back again!

I have a girl crush on this cutie who blogs on http://mashiso.tumblr.coÉ and she mostly posts on food. She seems to know food very well, and she's kind of filled the void Yelp has with "secret" gems. I tend to get myself stuck in a rut with where to eat, or I frequent the same place too much. She was talking about this thing called 7x7 (which i believe is a bay area foodie mag), and their 100 places to eat challenge. The salty caramel icecream was listed, and I decided to give it a try. Don't let the long line discourage you, these people know how to get it moving! I was the 25th in line and I got my stuff within 5-10 minutes. Not bad. Salty Caramel : Don't let the name fool you either. It's not salty. It tastes like straight up liquid caramel. Yum. Lavender: Tastes like flowers. Stay away from this is you'd prefer to wear florals than taste it. Cookies and cream: My bf had this and he loved it. All flavors had a super smooth consistency. I can't wait to try all other flavors. If you'd like to just take a pint home, you can skip the line and let them know. Bathroom keys are at the register btw. Service is great!

Pro: Most flavorful ice cream everrrr. Definitely an experience for palate and sugar tooth. Con: Way too many flavors to choose from. The line also took 30 mins when it was like below 50 degrees outside. Crazy sf ice-cream fanatics! Also a bit costly for ice-cream, but worth it. Weapon of choice (to my gut!): Salted caramel and roasted banana. Verdict: The ice cream was rich and smooth, but I wish I chose the toasted coconut instead of the roasted banana after trying my buddy's. The salted caramel was also extremely overpowering!

I like sweets and had read about BiRite from 7x7 and people have told me that is the place to go for ice cream. ÊBut as I'm new to SF myself, I haven't gone myself. ÊSo when my out of town friend visited and suggested trying out BiRite creamery I was more than willing to take him. Ê We got there on a Friday night around 9:30pm. ÊWhile there is a line, it was moving at a brisk pace and gave us BiRite virgins time to study the menu. Ê My friend did a search on Yelp and saw that the top 2 recommended flavors of their ice creams are salted caramel and honey lavender. ÊI guess the fact that I just typed these two words upped their # of reviews mentioned. ÊHow unfortunate. Ê Don't get me wrong, while I sampled those 2 flavors and didn't take a dislike to it, I would not recommend those 2 flavors as THE ITEM to try at BiRite. ÊSalted Caramel was too sweet, I know, how can it be too sweet when its salted? but it was. ÊHoney lavender had too much honey. ÊI drink honey with my tea and I drink tea every day. And i am very particular with the amount of honey I put in my tea. ÊI actually do not like the taste of honey on its own. ÊHowever, combine with other food and used as a sweetener, honey is better than sugar, IMO. ÊWith the honey lavender, I didn't taste much lavender. Ê What I ended up getting was their Pumpkin Sundae. After sampling their pumpkin ice cream first. Ê I had been on a pumpkin-everything-kick these past 2 years and I want to try everything with the pumpkin flavor. ÊDuring my pumpkin craze, I have discovered that to get the pumpkin flavor right is quite difficult. ÊToo much pumpkin then it'd taste a bit too earthy, too much cinnamon then it'd over power the taste of pumpkin, too little pumpkin then it'd just be sugary sweet or bland. ÊBi-rite's pumpkin ice cream was perfect in delivering the flavor of pumpkin, the creaminess of ice cream yet light enough where its not too heavy as one would associate with other ice cream flavors. Ê Given I knew I'd like the pumpkin ice cream I wasn't too worry about the sundae given its toppings etc. ÊBut boy was I pleasantly surprised when I have the first spoonful. Ê The sundae was AWESOMELY DELICIOUS. It came with 2 scoops of pumpkin ice cream, gingerbread cake and topped with whipped cream, spiced pecan and caramel sauce. ÊThe ice cream was already delish, coupled with the crunchy but not so crunchy & sugary that it sticks to your teeth pecans and gingerbread, I was smiling with every bite. ÊThe only tiny tiny thing I didn't enjoy was the caramel sauce. ÊNext time I'd order without it or ask them to go light on it. ÊGuess I'm just not a caramel fan. My friend got a single scoop of salted caramel and he had to throw half of it out because it was just too sweet and it got tiring after awhile. ÊHe liked his salted caramel, but after he had my sundae, he said the salted caramel was nothing in comparison. I killed the pumpkin sundae with a vengeance. ÊThe rest of the night I cannot get it out of my head. Ê I can go back any day for that pumpkin sundae sans the caramel sauce again.

Very simply, good flavors, HORRIBLE access and wait! If you're not driving in to this place it's a good little gem, but street parking is almost non existent! People compare this to Mitchell's and i would say that's fair, however, some noticeable differences (not that I'm telling you which one is better, but to distinguish between the two for the actual food. The Ice Cream here is deliciously flavored, but not as smooth (creamy) as Mitchell's. They do have some flavors that would bring me back here Vs. the other place, one being the Orange Cardamom. There used to be an Indian Ice Cream shop close to this area as well, but has since closed down, so now, to get a cardamom flavored ice cream, Bi-Rite is the place to go! Sample all you can, the flavors truly are delicious, and don't forget to try the special concoction!

Bi-Rite Creamery's unique, exotic flavors and textured ice cream is the perfect pitstop after a meal in the Mission for a cheap and satisfying dessert. With flavors like honey lavender, brown sugar (with a caramel ginger swirl), orange cardamom, and earl grey, you won't be disappointed with the selection. Flavors like toasted coconut manage to taste like the real thing, even adding texture with small flecks of coconut throughout, instead of tasting like some cheap, cloying imitation flavor. The service is friendly, the ice cream delicious. My only complaint is the ridiculously long line (I waited more than 30 minutes the other day) - which only goes to show its popularity and excellence !

So, it's crowded. But it's good!! The line wasn't too bad, I tried like 5 flavors and decided to settle on brown sugar ginger swirl! it was sooo good. Usually when something is so good I'm happy and I go crazy. But I had to control myself to be extra disciplined so I wouldn't do anything rash and stupid and drop my icecream on accident. 1. I don't really like ice cream, honestly 2. I don't like ginger, at all. not the taste, not the smell, it's just repulsive! but. I loved the ice cream here, loved the ginger here. mmm. delish the carry-home cartons were a bit pricey though =(

I do like the unique flavors at Bi-Rite. ÊMy faves are the orange cardamon, lavender, and earl grey. However, I am not a fan of the texture of their ice cream. ÊI like my ice cream dense and creamy, like Haagen Dazs. ÊBi-Rite is too fluffy. ÊAll of the air molecules mixing in with the cream actually makes the ice cream seem less creamy. Ê A pint for $8 is just too steep for ice cream I am not in love with.

Good ice cream, long line. I like that they have unique flavors. I had the butter pecan and the salted caramel. Butter pecan was delicious. I expected more from the salted caramel. It was more like a burnt caramel. I may come back if I'm in the area but I wouldn't make a special trip for it.

If I'd ordered only a scoop of Roasted Banana and walked away I'd have given this place 4 stars. Rich, creamy, dense and nicely accented with sticky banana bits. Very true flavor. (And I'm not even a fan of banana anything.) But then I ordered the messed up sorbet. The pineapple tangerine flavor was unremarkable. The texture was off. Was "dry" and crumbled into...crumbly pieces. Perhaps this is why they only had one sorbet on the menu (not including the one granita)? Summer's a better season for fruit and ice anyhow so they've some time to improve. I'll root for them. In the mean time, my suggestion, Bi-Rite: don't put it out if it ain't rite. I ordered a second ice cream flavor - the honey lavender - and Bi-Rite Creamery somewhat regained my favor (but just about wiped my wallet clean...that's another thing.) The not so subtle lavender flavor was a plus for me, and it was fairly creamy but still inferior in texture to the roasted banana (and the salted caramel which I sampled) in texture. What I really liked, besides the Roasted Banana: -- the environmentally conscious Êservingware (from the biodegradeable bowls to the metal tasting spoons -- the "Hot Chocolate Drink of the Day" (way to respect this winter beverage, thank you!) -- the use of local, Strauss organic dairy products -- the friendly girl who served me -- the sundaes and "toppings of the day" Definitely deserving of another try. Unfortunately the prices prohibit enjoying more than a couple flavors at once. Although it seems to go against all good sense and decency to serve the honey lavender alongside the ginger anyway, doesn't it. Update: Salted caramel - 4 stars chocolate - 3 stars Fairfax scoop has this place beat, for sure.

Tucked on a side street near Dolores Park, Bi-Rite is a bit secluded from clear eyesight. ÊThis tiny little shop occupies only enough seating for three and their cabinet of assorted flavors so expect to grub outside. They have a wide selection of ice cream and sorbet. ÊThe presentation of their goods is similar to that of a gelato shop's. ÊI constantly had to remind myself that it was ice cream instead of gelato. ÊThey allow for sampling with their own metal tasting spoons, yet I always just go for the kill. There are several people there to help you. ÊAs I went to order a guy taps me on the shoulder. ÊWahhh? ÊWhat's getting in my way of dessert?! "Hey I was here in front of you", a man begrudgingly states. "Duhhh, I came in here with her??", I reply as I point to the lady with a stroller and three kids. ÊI had opened the door for this lady talking on her cell phone while pushing her cart of kids. ÊI had even let this lady order before me and now this guy was tapping on my shoulder? ÊHow impatiently could this guy be? ÊThere were two servers and only two people in front of him! ÊAnyways... I ordered plum sorbet and orange cardamom in single cup ($3.25, pretty standard fare for gourmet ice cream). ÊThe plum tasted like it was straight out of a starburst packet. ÊIt was good, just not great. ÊThe plum flavor wasn't that discernible mostly because it was overrun with sweetness. ÊIt was so sweet that it slightly burned the back of my palette. As for the orange cardamom...oooh yeah. ÊThis flavor was sooo good. ÊIt was creamy and luscious. ÊI wouldn't mind going for a cup of this by itself. ___ A tiny gourmet ice cream shop with interesting flavors. ÊA friend of mine tells me that most of the flavors are really saturated and deep, so I maybe pre-tasting would be a good idea. -Does it have enough to distinguish itself from other shops? A: Not sure? ÊI guess you'll have to visit to find out.

Can't help but feel good when you get a slam dunk parking spot right in front on Bi-Rite. Then saw the line out the door and around the corner... Shucks! :( Got to give it to the crew there for moving the line at lightning speed since the wait was no longer than 5 minutes. Really, I felt I barely had enough time to decide on my flavors:) luckily they were cool with letting me sample, which helped the decision process. Ended up with a salted caramel (who could refuse???) and lemon meyer. Salted caramel got me weak in the knees. Almost enough to trade in my boyfriend for a lifetime supply of this oh soooo smooth, cool, salty, toffee tasting delectable cold confection. Ok, I'm kidding about the boyfriend trade, but it's definitely something to consider... Oh, almost forgot about the lemon meyer. It was a very refreshing flavor with a hint of ginger. Great palate cleanser if you just had a greasy meal. In fact, I think it might reverse the effects of greasy food and give you a chance at re-eating yournlast meal. Friend offered a taste of the honey lavender and it really just wasn't my cup of tea. Had the same flavor at Holy Gelato and it still feels like potpourri in my mouth.

Great icecream at Bi-rite! I had the deliciously rich salted caramel, Ricanela and Brown Butter Pecan. My favorites were the salted caramel and Ricanela- the Brown Butter Pecan's flavor was a bit more subtle than the other two- it was good but not amazing like the others. Wow, talk about FLAVOR! It was dead when we got there so we also got to taste a few other flavors- the service was great. It's more expensive than other ice cream shops but it's not "other" ice cream- it's hand-crafted, superflavorful, life-affirming ice cream. Grab some then eat it in the park right up the street!

Wow, over 1200 reviews?! ÊWhat can I possibly say that hasn't been said? ÊProbably little! I'll just note that I had a two-scoop cup today consisting of ricanela (snickerdoodle) and toasted banana, which ended up being a delicious combo. ÊKinda small size for two scoops, but it actually satisfied me perfectly. ÊCertainly creamy and sweet, but not too cloyingly sweet, and the texture of the toasted banana (with bits of crunchy dried banana) was perfect! And despite the gorgeous warm weather in SF today, my friend and I waited less than 5 minutes for our ice cream (at 1:15pm on a Sunday). So, with all this deliciousness, why not five stars? ÊWell, I save five-star ratings for super-exceptional places... with surprising ambiance, impressive generosity (e.g., donating a large percentage of profits to charity), amazingly cheap prices, etc. ÊBi-rite merely offers really yummy ice cream next to an attractive park, so -- while impressive and much appreciated -- just misses out on that 5th star.

I've been wanting to come here for a long time. I finally had my chance one night when walking around the mission after my friend's birthday dinner. It was a pleasant surprise that we just so happened to come across this place. We were already pretty tipsy from some sangria from Cha Cha Cha so we didn't mind waiting in line for a little, and of course...we had the drunken munchies.

ÊI opted for the snickerdoodle and cookies and cream (apparently I was in a really fatty mood) on a cone. The snickerdoodle was especially delicious! Cookies and cream was pretty standard. But the cone was just...ehh....a cone. Let me forewarn you, I'm biased to another ice cream place. If you haven't already made your way across the bridge to the East Bay, go to Berkeley and try Ici. I swear it won't disappoint. And, once you have a handmade cone at Ici you will never be satisfied by Bi-rite's. Sorry, but it's just the plain facts of life. Bi-rite is not bad at all, it's quite delicious. But, try Ici sometime...I'm just sayin.

I tried this place, skeptical at first, thinking that it was just a tourist-y place (I grew up in the city). BUT, the salted caramel really wowed me. I had tried this flavor at Molly Moon's in Seattle, and found it too strong after 3 bites. Bi-Rite gets it right- smooth, light, balanced! I also tried Ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles)- smelled great and the first 5 bites were delicious, but after that I got tired of it. If it weren't so far from me, I'd come more often.

There are two ice cream stores within about two miles of each other. One of those is living a sustainable existence, complete with the coolest cats in town scooping the most delicious, fresh ice cream the city has to offer. The other is no longer on my radar now that I have found my home at Bi Rite. I have waited up to an hour to spoon the freshest, sweetest local ice cream into my mouth and have also stopped by in the middle of the day, when it was 91 in SF and waited roughly 10 minutes. If you hate HATE waiting on line, you are in luck. You can bypass all the lovely folks texting, facemashing (anyone catch that?) and yapping and head inside. If all you want is a prepackaged pint or quart of bundled goodness, you can grab it from the freezer and head straight for the finish line. They have the most amazing Vegan blend of chocolate and coconut that honestly tastes like it's got some moo cow hidden in it and the Brownie sundae ( I always add choco sprinkles to bring out the 9 year old in me) is truly heaven served chilled.

At Marcie's and Kelly's Korner, the two local ice cream parlors, it was Cookies n' Cream all the way. But at Bi-Rite, there's just too many good flavors to choose from. I was first told to try the Salted Caramel, which was awesome. And then I discovered the Honey Lavender and the Balsamic Strawberry. Yum and yum. It really depends on my mood that day or the weather, but you really can't go wrong. Kudos for the inventive, paradoxical flavors. Who knew?

Damn. Seriously, almost every time I try to walk past 18th street, I find myself turning down towards Dolores Park to get an ice cream cone. My favorite combo is the Masala Orange and Lavender flavors, but if I'm feeling decadent I'll get Toffee Coffee and Peanut Butter fudge. Toffee Coffee ice cream. Of all the sets of 2 flavors that rhyme with each other, Toffee Coffee is my favorite. And the coffee is from Ritual.

My fave ice cream spot on the west coast. Bi-rite makes delectable, organic, homemade, creamy ice cream. Some of my favorites are... 1) Coffee Toffee (Tastes exactly like gourmet java!) 2) Cherry Almond (Real big cherry chunks and lots of almonds) 3) Honey Lavender 4) Salted Caramel (but can only have so much... as the name states- it's salty) The Mint Choc Chip was good, but pretty average compared to the rest of their offerings. Can't wait to try the Balsamic Strawberry and Mexican Chocolate flavor when I go back!

Bi-Rite is a cute ice cream shop that offers interesting flavors that you probably can't find anywhere else. We got the salted caramel, honey lavendar, and ricanelas (cinnamon ice cream with bits of snickerdoodle). Salted caramel, although the most popular flavor, was my least favorite of the three. It was just too strong for me! After eating it for awhile, my throat actually felt a little sore/scratchy. Ricanelas was EXCELLENT though. Overall: Bi-Rite is cool to try for its crazy flavors, but the taste of the ice cream is still questionable.

Um, I used to think the line out of here was cause it's good. But no. I've had better dryers icecream than this. Though it's true, they dont do seasonal sea salt whatever and icecream that tastes like trader joes hand soap. Trust me- I love exotic floral icecream (see my Bombay review or Marianne's), but handsoap- not at this price.

Ok I am the biggest ice cream fan in the world! Seriously just ask anyone who know me. ÊThis place has always been the spot people keep telling me about that I absolutely MUST try. ÊSo I did and got the 2 flavahs: Strawberry balsamic: Had crunchy Êice crystals and not enough strawberry nor balsamic flavor. ÊThe color of the ice cream was a faint pink! if I were to rename this ice cream I would call it "the light pink ice crunch" Salted caramel: Had better...this too had ice cruchies!

Salted Caramel Ice Cream. If you could write a four word review that would summarize how good this place is that would be it. Those four words describe an experience. This is not a food, this is not a dessert, it's the best ice cream anywhere. I have yet to taste a bad flavor and I have to say it's just flat out sensational. Great ingredients, friendly employees and an atmosphere of awesomeness make this one of the best spots in the Mission. Enjoy!

Over 2000 Yelp reviews and 4.5 stars? ÊThat already says a lot about this place. Bi-Rite is my favorite ice-cream place of all time. ÊSnicker doodle, Toasted Coconut, Cinnamon Swirl and Honey Lavender are some of my favorite flavors. Ê Doesn't matter what time of day or what time of year, there is always a line out the door. ÊDespite this...the staff seems always willing to provide samples (I always felt bad about asking for samples with so many people in line behind me) and they never make you feel rushed. ÊGreat place to stop by after spending the day at Dolores Park across the street. Ê Bonus points: ÊThey use recycled products for their spoons, bowls, and napkins.

Fresh, uniquely delicious ice cream served up by friendly hipsters in the Mission? Hell yeah! My favorite has to be the salted caramel. I tend to never diverge from the norm, but today I got the malted vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate. To die for. Nice to see that Bi-Rite is going to be expanding their space. Although, it is quite fun to hang outside and people watch too...

Last weekend I finally decided to see what all this hype over BiRite was about. So I stood in line for about 15-20 minutes and pretended I was a Mission Transplant Hipster. I had a single scoop of the Coffee Toffee. I really enjoyed that there were bits of coffee grinds. However, it was a little more expensive than I wanted to pay. I'm used to a gourmet cone costing about $2.65 or so, but over $3? Plus, the scoop was not very generous. BiRite definitely has decadent and complimentary flavors. I like it better than PollyAnn's, but it may take a few more visits to make me switch from being a Mitchell's fan. BiRite is for the person with a sophisticated palate. Imagine the type of ice cream you would receive for dessert as a sampler at a fancy restaurant. ÊIn short, however, ÊI probably wouldn't make a trip to the Mission just for the ice cream.

Ice cream is such a wonderful thing and it's great to see a place like Bi-Rite Creamery doing it with passion and class. When I was visiting SF my friends took me out to this place and I was blown away by the great flavor of the frozen cream scooped into my cone. It was pretty crowded when I went but the line went by pretty fast and it's well worth the wait. Final Thoughts: Not much to say other than if you're ever in SF check this place out. It's a classic treat done extremely well.

IF YOU LOVE ICE CREAM, THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU! As a visitor to San Francisco, this was my second visit to Bi-Rite! The first time I came, I got Salted Caramel and Peppermint - delicious! My fellow tourist really enjoyed their fruit popsicles that he bought 3! Another friend ordered a Sam's Sundae and the lady that helped us was so kind as to split it into two flavors! After such a great first impression and the quality of service, I made sure to make another visit here when I was in San Francisco again. This time I got Salted Caramel (again) and Cherry Vanilla. It was delicious, but I thought the SC/Peppermint combo was better (next Christmas!). Bi-Rite never fails to satisfy your ice cream cravings! :)

ICE CREAM YOU SCREAM WE ALL SCREAM FOR ICE CREAM! No really, I would scream for ice cream. I've been here 2 times now, and I would continue to go back. The first time I got Mint Chip, which is my go-to flavor and I always love it. This time I got Apricot Sorbet, which was extremely Apricot-y, it wasn't as icy as I had hoped, and was a little..sticky? I'm not sure, but it wasn't my favorite. I also don't usually choose sorbet so that might be why. This place is so popular and the people are so nice.

It was a rare, hot 80-something degree day in SF. What better day to get ice cream from Bi-Rite Creamery? It was 5PM and the line came to the end of the block. I would've loved to sample some flavors, but I didn't want to hold up the line. I opted for a single size (one to two flavors) with 1) Salted Caramel and 2) Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces, for $3.25. Kind of steep for two small scoops, but they were both delicious! They melted too quickly though. Bi-Rite uses organic ingredients and no unnecessary additives or coloring. Also, great friendly staff.

3 years ago, my friend brought me here on our tour of her neighborhood. She was trying to woo me to move to SF from Boston. "They have lavender ice cream? Who said that was allowed?"

This place always has a line out the door and down the street and around the corner, but I'm not sure how many of these people are in it for a scoop of Salted Caramel. If they are, it's available at the window next door that sells soft serve. Doh. This is a review for that line. We got a scope of the hard packed salted caramel and a swirl soft serve, and I'm sure it was delicious as it was eaten rather quickly by some very already-full patrons, but I have made ice cream at home and I'm not sure this is the best. I came because I was in the area, but I wouldn't make the drive or walk from upper SF to seek it out. ÊMaybe next time I'll suck it up and stand in line and see if there's anything better, but for now, a 3 star rating will do.

I've tasted salted caramel before (in Seattle) but I thought, what's so great about it? I did not know what I was missing until I tried Bi-Rite. One taste of your salted caramel and I was in LOVE. Their ice cream is soft, and super deliciously perfect. I was re-directed to the window outside because I wanted the salted caramel soft serve..... and got the swirl of the day salted caramel with vanilla. It was heaven sent! Soft, creamy, and reminded me of this caramelized sugar dessert in the streets of Korea..... so delicious. I noticed they had cupcakes and other baked goods as well but I had to resist! I had plans to try another cupcake place elsewhere. I wish there was one in the southbay..... because I'd go everyday. :) COME HERE FOR THE BEST ICE CREAM IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD!!!!!!

A friend an I spent the day in the city on Saturday which we topped off with a visit to 'heaven sent' aka Bi-Rite. The Salted Caramel and Honey Lavender is the way to go! Make sure the lovely person behind the counter leaves the Honey Lavender for the second scoop. It will not only give your patience a work out whilst you enjoy the deliciousness that is their Salted Caramel but you will be rewarded with a stellar, delicate and sweet finale. I'm not joking when I say that those two scoops were... life changing. You kind of drift after first taste, deeper and deeper until you have devoured it all with your eyes closed - then you open them - taking a minute for your eyes to focus in again. Do you care if people stare??? No! The line that stretched from their door to the corner was worth it, it moves fast anyway. Take your friend by the arm with your scoops in the other and head for dolores park, sit amongst the palms and fellow locals and just be...

Bi-Rite Creamery is, as the 5 stars indicate, as good as homemade crafted Êice cream and sundaes gets in San Francisco. ÊBut if I could give a half star I would give them 4 1/2, only because they don't make shakes and malts - maybe that will change.... Bi Rite always has great flavors to choose from. ÊYes, it's expensive but suck it up and go all out and get one of their sundaes. ÊMy recommendation would be the banana split, it's pretty big so it's great to share. But I guess if you were really ambitious you could power your way thru it all by yourself...but you will have a tummyache after! One of the things I like about this place is the ability to get two flavors in a single scoop serving. This may sound trivial but it really is great, especially if you only want one scoop but have a hard time deciding on a single flavor.

Any time I'm in the mission, I always make it a point to come to Bi Rite. ÊIt isn't like any other ice cream I've had before. ÊAll their flavors are so original and unique that makes me always come back here. ÊYou can try as many flavors as you want and they always have a smile on their face even if you ask to try them all =D. ÊMy favorites are their Roasted Banana, Toasted Coconut, and their Balsamic Strawberry. ÊYumm....I tried their Salted Caramel that their famous for but wasn't a fan of it. ÊMaybe it's because I don't really like caramel in the first place =P. ÊI think it's more for the caramel lover. If you're brave enough (like I was) ask to try all their flavors. ÊThat way you know how it all tastes and really decide which ones you like so afterwards you're not second guessing you're decision. Ê Oh even on cold nights here, there tends to be a small line...maybe a 5-10 minute wait. ÊBut on warm nights, the line goes around the corner and expect a 15-20 minute wait. ÊOn a super hot day...gosh I can't even imagine since it's so close to Dolores Park.

ÊOkay, maybe you don't scream, but I scream "This is sOoOo delicious!!!" as I take each bite...(wipes drool from thinking about Bi-Rite ice cream) I would have not found this place if I didn't search for ice cream on Yelp.

One sentence summary: Definitely one of those places you have to go to before you die. Recommendations: Overall, everything there looks and tastes fantastic. Look at the menu and get what looks good to you. Other than that, I suggest trying the roasted coconut, brown butter pecan, salted caramel, and coffee toffee.

Gee, I feel so honored to be the 1145th reviewer of Bi-Rite. In case you were not enticed by the other 1144 rave reviews of the Bi Rite Creamery, and still need convincing, here's one more. Yes, it's the best in the Bay Area, likely the best in California. The Mexican Chocolate is my favorite (chocolate with nuts). The Ritual Coffee Toffee is also great. Honey Lavendar and Salted Caramel are good, more subtle flavors. Make sure you top of your cup with their chocolate sauce. Oh, and the sundaes are to die for. Could I make it a meal? If it's one of the 15 or so hot days a year that bless San Francisco, be prepared to wait in a line around the corner. On any other day, you'll stll probably wait a bit, but yes, it's that good.

Your dilemma: "Man, I really want icecream. Where should I go?" My answer? "Simple. Bi-Rite mofo'in Cremery, my friend." Not only do they make icecream fresh everyday, use local organic ingredients, biodegradable packing materials, it's a party in my mouth. I was sold after my first scoop. Sure, they have some basic flavors for the non-adventurous types. Vanilla, chocolate, cookies and cream? Check, check, and check. But why have those when they have flavors like Salted Caramel, Honey Lavender, and Snickerdoodle?! I really had to resist the urge to type "Snickerdoodle" in all capital letters, I'm just that enthusiastic about the flavor. It's delicious, with little chunks of crunchy goodness in a sweet cinnamon-y bed of creamy dairy perfection. I warn you, lines are long and the wait may seem like forever, but it's totally worth it when you dig into that refreshing scoop. Note: If you're buying a pint, there's a separate line for that, so you pass by everyone waiting for individual scoops.

Got my fix of salted caramel and balsamic strawberry! The single scoop size is perfect for slipping past my newly developed lactose intolerance. (sigh, it's on the internet now, that means it's really real.) How do i describe this ice cream... smooth - no ice chunks here!, creamy, melts fast but wouldn't last anyway. You know how some flavors don't translate well to other mediums? This ice cream tastes like the real thing... rich silky caramel, full flavored subtle strawberry... but in a fresh cone. Oddly there was no line here at 7pm on a friday - just a bunch of new moms and dads looking for an escape. maybe it picks up around closing time? parking IS ridiculous though. you might as well try to land a helicopter on this block. i'm going to lobby for a bus directly here from bart.

i waited 30 minutes in 50 so degree weather for ice cream. Êworth it! Êgot the balsamic strawberry (still dont know whats in there) and the salted caramel. Êboth were delicious. Êmy bf found the caramel a little bit too overpowering, but i really liked it. Ê live up to all the hype?

YUM-O! It's good to know that this ice cream is NOT pumped with artificial high-fructose partially hydrogenated preservative junk so it can sit in a freezer until 2034. Anyone can appreciate anything made in-house with organic and sustainable local ingredients which is even presented to you in recyclable materials! Or ice cream can come on an edible cone or cookie ice cream sandwich. 18 years in Berkeley makes me indeed part hippie, but this place really has a great idea going on! Creative flavors and super creamy consistency. The salted caramel was divine! Buttery, salee/sucre, cold flavor combination. I want more!!! There was no line when I went about 30 minutes before closing. Actually, it was quite empty but I might just wait in line for this. They also have a stamp card!

I went here and knew I loved it. But I didn't realize how much I (we) loved it until it came up in every conversation for a few weeks. Somehow we managed to work it in as "hey, have you tried bi-rite creamery yet"? and "you really need to try bi-rite creamery". Salted caramel ice cream -- fantastic.

Roasted banana ice cream - super creamy, not overly sweet, slightly nutty, and with the essence of banana. ÊTry combining it with salted caramel or chocolate (you can get two flavors in a single). The best part is that they don't tell you the nutritional information, so you can enjoy it without worrying about the fat/calories, yet you know the ingredients are fresh/natural. Ê It's worth waiting in line for. ÊIt also means I never order dessert at any restaurant when I'm anywhere near Bi-Rite.

I'm not really much of an ice cream fan, but since I was in the area and Bi-Rite is pretty much legendary, I was pretty much obligated to try it out. After giving the flavors a quick glance, I asked to try the white chocolate raspberry swirl, obviously because it sounded amazing. I think the spoonful I got was 97% raspberry and 3% white chocolate, since I tasted only the tartness of the raspberry. Not wanting to be a jerk and ask for another sample, I decided to just order a small malted vanilla crunch, another flavor that sounded like it was a slam dunk. I love my vanilla, but it seemed like the malted-ness of it masked most of the vanilla flavor. It was still pretty good though. My friend got the salted caramel and that was a clear winner. Like I said, I'm not the best judge of ice cream since I don't fiend for it, so Bi-Rite gets 4 stars for good interesting flavors.

ÊWanting to try somewhere different, I proposed Bi-Rite and WOW we weren't disappointed.

If you live in the city, then you know bi-rite. Everyone talks of it. Every time you pass it there are long lines. They also sell it in some stores. Bi-rite is something that people seem to consider authentically San Franciscan. With that said, I expected to reach nirvana when eating this ice cream. Expectations were sky high. I would have to say that it didn't meet those expectations. Then again, I'm not sure any ice cream could've. Their unique flavors reminds me of Bombay Creamery and I particularly enjoyed that. I got two flavors that I judge most places by: chocolate and coffee. Their version of chocolate had a hint of cinnamon and their version of coffee came with toffee bits. They were both absolutely delicious. On a somewhat unrelated note, I did a mental comparison of this to frozen yogurt (a popular current trend). While the ice cream was good, it was something that, after 2 scoops (single serving), I was quite done. My sugar buds were done with. But with frozen yogurt, flavors tends to be more subtle. There less of a blast to your taste buds which I appreciate. I'll definitely have to return to try the other flavors but, for now, I don't consider it worth waiting in a really long line. It seems that people have a partiality for it because it is an independent, local business with a certain flair. But, in my eyes, they have real competition when it comes to Bombay Creamery and Mitchell's.

Visited San Fran and as I was told Bi-Rite Creamery was the way to go. It was overcast when I visited, but in some strange way I am the type of person who enjoys ice cream more when its cold outside. Yes. I know, strange, indeed. When I asked for a free sample, they gave me a metal spoon from a jar of water. It sort of put me off a bit, not quite sure why. I guess I expected using a plastic spoon and have it thrown away. But, of course they were environmentally conscious as I saw they were separating their trash! A HUGE PLUS in my book. I wish more shops were like this. If I had one suggestion, it would be their most popular flavor- salted caramel- a little bit of sweet decadence with a touch of bitterness, sort of like a bacon topped doughnut I had tried before. It leaves you asking what the heck did I just eat?!? ÊBut you find yourself continuing to eat it because you just can't stop. EXACTLY.

Ok so I keep a small cooler in my car trunk just in case I go to SF. Lol! I must visit this place when I am in the city. I get a pint of the salted caramel. It's like my ultimate comfort food! I'm content just having a teaspoon of this ice cream a day until i finish the pint. When I actually find parking and stand in line, I like to sample a couple of flavors before choosing what to get. The last time I went, I asked the person who was helping me about his opinion of the blood orange and sea salt sundae with vanilla or chocolate ice cream. He actually prepared sample sizes of the sundae, one with vanilla and the other with chocolate so I can taste. The flavors were good, but I was in the mood for sweet. I ended up getting Êroasted banana with homemade graham cracker. Sooo goood! On another occasion, I sampled their chocolate-vanilla soft serve which they serve at the walk-up window. Also for sale are yummy baked goods. They have a chocolate souffle, and a chocolate cupcake with honey, peanut butter and sour cream frosting. All are delish!

the salted caramel ice cream is probably one of my faves... there's just a touch of magic thinking it's sweet and then a rush of saltiness comes running through after... it's awesome. What i also like about Bi-Rite, is they sell all these amazing dipping sauces of different flavors! i tried buying a jar of the dark chocolate sauce and it was so great with strawberries and as i would hate to admit, i would dip my finger in it and just eat it by itself. (totally savage, i know). I came here when there was a LGBT festivity going on at the park, and boy this place was packed! the line was extremely long...but theyre really fast here...so it was all worth it for my scoop of fatness.

I must admit that I have heard people talk about this place for ages, but the "Bi-Rite" name just kept registering in my head as bad grocery chain type ice cream. Boy, was I wrong. ÊJust a bevy, nay, a cornucopia of flavors to try. Our server was great even in denying my bid to have him dip my brown sugar and candied ginger caramel ice cream cone in pistachios. ÊThe store is typically tiny (for SF), so someone in your party should scope out some seating pre-ordering if you don't want to eat outside. Is it the best ice cream I've had in the Bay Area? ÊI can't say for sure. ÊI do like the variety of non-standard flavors. Also, and I don't know if they are separate from the ice cream store, there is a little window to order cupcakes.

This place is crazy! ÊCray-cray crazy. We tried to stop by for ice cream on Labor Day, and the line was around the block - and I was assured that this is pretty normal. ÊOur SF friends told us that the trick is to just go to the market down the street and buy a pint. ÊWe tried to do that, pushing through the absolutely claustrophobia-inducing packed store to find that QUELLE HORREUR, the ice cream coolers were all broken. ÊShelves and shelves of delicious Bi-Rite ice cream taunted us from behind the glass doors and masking tape barriers. Fortunately, we had one more option. ÊI made a bee-line for the Bi-Rite Bakery window, where I was told that you could ALSO buy pints. ÊNo wait, no line, and in a few minutes we were happily eating salted caramel on a park bench.

Why go anywhere else? Because it's the Mission and you have to deal with parking. I take the J-Church from downtown and walk a block down 18th. I grew up in Berkeley in the 80's where ice cream was like water compared to the scarcity we have now. Not only that, it was all handmade locally. We had at least four good shops that are all now gone. So, now that you understand where I'm coming from, I gotta say, "THIS PLACE ROCKS!" Be a rock star, spend some of your summer-walkin' around-enjoying the sun-lazy Sunday money here. Most people rave about the salted caramel, but I'd encourage people to try the brown butter pecan, too. They also do a nice CHOCOLATE chocolate...and a Ritual Coffee Toffee. Oh, small detail: they make all the ice cream in 3-gallon batches, right there. Oh, I didn't see it last week, but they used to have the thickest hot chocolate in San Francisco. It looks like melted chocolate. Not for the faint of heart, but they have several flavors and when I had it, I was impressed. Five stars for product, and good, happy service. I was in there, and a 3-year-old girl was single-minded about the soy chocolate. I asked what her favorite was. She told me SOY CHOCOLATE. Mom said, "I think it's the only flavor she knows." Perhaps the next gen of ice cream aficionados is upon us. It's time for us geezers to step aside and let them have our spots in line. Not on your life, Dumbo!

Bi-Rite needs another review like, well, the Mission needs another Taqueria, but after my most recent visit tonight, I was really turned off by the sassy service we received. ÊAt almost $8.00 per pint, the staff needs to be a little more courteous, rather than corralling the customers into the shop and yelling "Everyone inside, we're closing up!", even with 20 minutes before closing time. ÊIf they were so put out to serve us, they should have closed 20 minutes earlier. While we didn't order at the counter, as the prepacks of roasted banana and vanilla were in the freezer, we collected our pints and then to our surprise, the cashier then yelled at us to "come over here and give me your money!". ÊWhile they might have been trying to be cute, throwing the receipt on the counter only helped to taint the experience. Ê I'm not that delicate and have been served by rude shop clerks before at other stores, however, I was really disappointed at the service at Bi-Rite, especially since I had a guest with me who had never been to the creamery, it was not a good first impression. Poor service aside, the ice cream flavors are inventive and are always tasty and their efforts to be green are commendable.

Bi-Rite is the best ice creamery in the city, which is ironic because it's so close to my new apartment. ÊThe only downside, is that there is always such a long line, but at least people who go to Bi-Rite are cool, so I have fun meeting new friends and potential GFs while standing around talking about which flavors we like the best, and how awesome our bikes are, or where to buy neato hats.

Bottom line: Sam's Sundae is, without a doubt, the best ice cream dessert treat I've ever had. Yeah, I'll admit it: I saw the damn Êthing on that thar food network show, "The Best Thing I Ever Ate", saw the 2000+ yelp reviews with a legitimate 4 1/2 stars rating and had to go. I went on a Saturday afternoon and not surprisingly, Êthere was a line. I usually hate lines but the reputation of this place preceded it so we stayed put. For a place that does so much business, the girls behind the counter are really quite cordial. Service with a smile, even when treating people like cattle wouldn't deter too many customers away. It took a little longer to get my sundae as opposed to my 2 other companions getting their single scoops of ice cream because, as the girl said with a smile,"We're making you a fresh one because the whip cream wasn't good enough". Sounds like a weird, brown-nosed fantasy but they want their product to go out with a high standard of quality. Oh yeah, if you dont already know, Sam's Sundae is 2 scoops of luscious chocolate ice cream that is made with good, high quality chocolate producing a true chocolate flavor, drizzled with bergamot olive oil (which was a citrusy, lavender taste) sprinkled with maldon' sea salt and lastly, freshly whipped, whipped cream. Now, as you can tell, Im no professional food writer and i dont know how it works, but it works. The olive oil has so much flavor and it adds this floral, lavender taste to the sundae, its completely new to me and completely amazing. The salt adds this savory accent that cuts through the decadent creaminess of the ice cream... Yes, Im babbling and im sure i embarrassed myself when I was waxing poetic about the sundae as i ate it on the sidewalk, my companions rolling their eyes at me but I dont care, this thing is great. Definitely not your normal had fudge on vanilla with a cherry on top...If you're wondering how such a sundae could be thi good and this popular, just get over to bi-rite creamery and try it.

it's good ice cream but I just don't see how it is the best. I imagine a 5 star ice cream to have a unique flavor that fills the mouth with an aroma to match. It seems like this may be the best you can get in the bay area but I believe an ice cream can get even better.

uh huh. Oh yea. My good friend and ice cream aficionado heard about this delightful little shop while he was in town last week. ÊCuriosity peaked with thoughts of salted ice cream so we decided to seek out and join the throngs of salt worshippers in hopes of understanding the true meaning of the salt lick. After standing in line for about 20 mins we were welcomed by signs promoting organic and environmentally friendly products (always a plus). Then came the moment of truth. ÊI clutched my cone and lapped up my first taste - a sharp burst of flavor - sweet butter cream, rich and aromatic, dissolved in my mouth, leaving a salty rememberance and a yearning for the next taste. Ê The perfect balance to an ice cream I had not had before - Êthe moment you think it's too sweet, you're hit with the boomerang of salty and then back to sweet with the next. ÊThe perfect ending to this delectable delight is the fresh crunchy cone that carries it (can't get more environmentally friendly than that).

Was really excited about this place until I got there. The guy behind the counter was a bit rude.. not just to me but to everyone.. short and snippy. Had the salted caramel, lavender/honey and something else.. the something else was pretty unremarkable as I cant even remember what it was. The other 2 were good plus the cookie of the day was pretty decent though kind of dried out from sitting on the counter all day. At least I can say I tried it.. maybe my hopes were to high?

So I was intrigued by the salted caramel and dragged a friend to Bi-Rite on a weekday night! It was meant Êto be- I got a beautiful parking space almost right in front! I ordered the salted caramel and the roasted banana and I sampled the balsamic strawberry AND the cookies and cream! :O All of them were A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! It's the perfect place to try something new while still sticking to your usual. That chocolate souffle is calling my name and with my new little "buy 10 get one free ice cream punch card" I'll be sure to be back! ;)

So we finally got to try this so talked about ice cream place last week. Lucky for us, it happened to be a pleasantly warm and sunny day in the city. It's right across from Dolores Park so a lot of people tend to notice it and the line was out the door and along the curb when we went. Good thing we waited though, the ice cream was fabulous in texture and unique in flavor. I decided to sample a couple and went with the cream fraiche and the honey lavender. Both were rich, creamy and distinct in flavor. The lavender surprisingly actually TASTED like it too. Those two flavors alone get the 5 stars from and a huge plus that their all natural and organic. If you can, avoid the weekends and better yet, try coming right at opening. There were other flavors I wanted to test out but didn't want to hold the line up.

Three stars will suffice for this place. ÊLet's see if I can explain this briefly. Extremely long line on a Monday night at 9:15. (-) Amazingly delicious cinnamon and snickerdoodle flavor.

Finally got to try the famed Salted Caramel (...and honey lavender, earl grey, malted vanilla + peanut brittle, toasted coconut, & more..) from Bi-rite. Definitely lives up to the hype! (: The flavors are interesting and the texture is sooo creamy, as it's made from high quality ingredients. Reasonably priced at $3.25 for a single scoop, where you can get 2 flavors. I haven't seen so many adults line up for ice cream in a long long time. I've also heard good things about Sam's Sundae (chocolate ice cream topped with olive oil and sea salt) though I can't say I've been brave enough to try that myself yet. I love their punch cards to reward those that keep coming back for more (free scoop after 10 scoops). The only thing that makes me sad is the parking in the area at night. The best bet is to circle around and find someone leaving.

A warm and lazy Sunday at Dolores park with a scoop of ice cream from Bi-Rite Creamery completes the equation. ÊAlthough it just so happens everyone's caught on to this discovery and the line is around the corner. ÊFortunately, our wait was a mere 30 minutes. Ê Upon entry, you'll notice all kinds of ice cream that they offer, I'm pretty sure I asked to sample them all. ÊI couldn't really settle on a decision so I just stuck with the famous salted caramel.

If I could choose a place to clumsily break my leg, it would be right in front of this place. My injuries would be iced by some of the best icecream I've ever eaten. Pretty great stuff. While I'm a huge Fenton's Creamery fan, Bi-Rite is nowhere near as cloying or overkill. I love the distinctiveness of the flavours, if that even makes sense. Salted Caramel, Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl, and Ricanelas (snickerdoodle-type flavour) are my fave fave faves. And I love the portions too. I'm not getting hit over the head with a tub o' lard. The olive oil icecream sample I had was surprisingly awesome, like an orange-infused spoonful of vanilla buttery (but slightly salted) popcorn. One of these days, when I get my teeny paycheck, I'm about to devour a legit scoop-sized version. Oh man...the Ricanelas though...makes me want to faint with weakness. Sigh.

In the City after a return trip to a newly beloved Peruvian restaurant for dinner, I announced that ice cream would be our dessert & the girlfriend agreed when I proposed a trip to Bi-Rite Creamery. I actually had not been to this well known ice cream institution yet & was looking forward to trying their stuff. After walking up the street a block or so from where we parked, we were greeted by a sight familiar to any ice cream worthy of merit. There was a line out the door & down the street. Service was pretty speedy, however, as we ordered & were served our ice cream scoops before long. The girlfriend got a single scoop of Balsamic Strawberry & I also opted for the Balsamic Strawberry plus a scoop of Craime Fraiche. It was yummy. It was, in fact, really, really yummy-creamy-smooth delicious. In terms of Bay Area ice cream power rankings, though, I feel there is better. For me, nothing has bested the little shop in Berkeley run by the former Chez Panisse pastry chef. As good as my 2 scoops from Bi-Rite were, there wasn't quite the same subtlety & depth as the ice cream from my #1. Of course, this is only the difference between really, really good ice cream & really, really, really good ice cream. There's some yummy ice cream at Bi-Rite, for sure. While it's not my absolute favorite, Bi-Rite Creamery is one of the best ice cream shops in the whole Bay Area. When in the City, Bi-Rite is an excellent choice for really, really good ice cream.

I don't know who is responsible for the current sea salt in sweets craze see: Recchiuti- fleur de sel (sea salt, caramel, dark chocolate) Vosges- Barcelona (sea salt, caramel, almonds, deep milk chocolate) Pocodolce- Bittersweet tiles w/ sea salt (double roasted almond, crystallized toffee, burnt caramel, aztec chile) But I fully agree! As you know, Bi-Rite has an amazing, fabulous salted caramel ice cream. How do you improve upon perfection? sprinkle MORE sea salt on top and add hot fudge. oh god, best ice cream experience ever. And no, it's not too salty. Caveat, I also think people who complain about MSG are wimps, so sprinkle salt at your discretion.

Holy begeezus! Another dope ice cream spot to hit up. This place may give my ol' reliable Swenson's a run for its money. This small little ice cream shop definitely packs a punch with a range of organic ice cream flavors. Salt caramel, basic chocolate and the cookies and cream were great. It's a bit hipster-ish but I think its got the goods to hold its own. Drawbacks? Popular and trendy. We barely missed the line that formed instantly once we walked through the door.

I'm too much of an ice cream purist to truly appreciate some of the creative flavor combinations a place like Bi-Rite comes up with. ÊI mean, unless a place has some profound version of espresso chip, or something involving either vanilla, chocolate, or coffee with actual chocolate chunks in it... it's lost on me. ÊI'm just too in love with the above flavors. I do have to say though, Bi-Rite was incredible. ÊI've become a HUGE HUGE HUGE fan of the salted caramel flavor...and I'm a guy who doesn't really like caramel!

After reading millions of rave reviews for Bi-Rite, the bf and I finally made it to the fabled ice cream shop this afternoon. My verdict? Overrated. To be honest, only the most discerning palate would be able to differentiate between Bi-Rite and Haagen Daaz. Don't get me wrong, the ice cream here is good. But it just tastes like "normal" ice cream. Some of the flavors are more exotic and original, but that's about it. Here are quick reviews of the ones we tried: Salted Caramel - Probably Bi-Rite's most famous flavor. And just as one yelper notes, you'll probably either love it or hate it. I personally thought it only tasted good for the first 5 bites. After that, the burnt flavor became too strong for me. Honey Lavender - Definitely did not like this flavor at all. I am usually a fan of floral flavors, and I love honey, but somehow, this just tasted wrong. Maybe I'm not hippie enough. Strawberry balsamic - Where was the balsamic? Beats me. Brown butter pecan - It was delicious. How can you go wrong with butter pecan? Overall, Bi-Rite is underwhelming. I'd probably only come here on a hot day if I lived close by. NOT worth a 50 minute drive.

I want to buy an ice cream maker attachment for my new KitchenAid and make honey lavender ice cream and eat it until the ice cream maker breaks. Too bad you can't smell ice cream, that would be the ultimate topper. I was sniffing my lavender hand cream while alternating spoonfuls of ice cream for the ultimate lavender experience.

They also have soy ice cream for those who are lactose intolerant. We all had cones - those of us who had ice cream had the "salted caramel," "chocolate," and "mint chip" flavors.

Bi-Rite Creamery is good. Damn good. Damn, damn good. That is my review. I would now like to suggest how you use the ice cream experience in the sequence of a day.

Yummy, yummy. Get in my belly! I love that they are trying out different flavors. Favorites are the Roasted Banana and Lemon. Salted Caramel, which is highly touted, was tasty but I was tasting too much salt. Maybe its just my sensitivity to it. I wasn't such a fan of the Chai Milk Chocolate. The best I had was Springtime Sundae with the Roasted Banana; came with crumbled sugar cookies and fresh strawberry compote. Mmm. Mm! Two downers: one, a bum that smelled like pee that was sifting thru the trash while we were in line. He dropped some creamy trash on my sandled foot. :"( And I think the ladies were a little stressed behind the counter. Non-stop park-goers and parents with their kids. They need three people working and some more counter space. In the future, if the line is long, I'm going to walk across the street to Bi-Rite market and look for some pre-packaged in the freezer section.

Oh Salted Caramel, how do I love thee... let me count the ways I love thee to the depth and breadth and height My tongue can reach, when feeling hunger in my tummy For the ends of milk and ideal Ice Cream. I love thee to the level of everyday indulgence From my most quiet need, to exuberant joy Ok, so it is pure grabbing of another persons poem and bastardizing it... but it just fits so well.. Beyond Salted Caramel though, I have not tried anything there that I would turn down a scoop (or two of), in particular the Roasted Banana, Balsamic Strawberry, Mexican Chocolate (with peanuts), and I always thinking about (but never get) the honey lavender.

After 867 reviews, I'm just singing in the choir. Bi-Rite is awesome! ÊWhen I first moved to the Bay Area, I thought Fenton's was pretty damn good. ÊNuh-uh. ÊBi-Rite rocks! ÊOkay, the salted caramel was overrated, but I love their rocky road with almonds. ÊWho doesn't love marshmallow in their ice cream? Bad part of Bi-Rite? ÊLocation sucks. ÊDon't get me wrong, I love the Mission. ÊIn fact, I'd probably live there if it weren't for work. ÊBut parking can be tortuous. ÊFortunately, I've been blessed with good parking karma. ÊSo far, on my trips...scratch that...treks up there I've parked within 2 blocks of Bi-Rite. ÊAh yeah! ÊSo, if anyone wants a Bi-Rite run and has poor parking karma, let me know so I can change all that.

How long have I heard of this place? Forever. How many times had I been before last week? Never. But then twice in one week! I love SF heat waves! So the first time I went, I tried Sam's Sundae - chocolate ice cream, bergamot olive oil, sea salt and whipped cream. I like to try odd stuff like that from time to time because if I don't, I go home wondering about it. And then kind of obsess over it. And I wasn't sure when I was going to make it back to this place. Anyway, long story short, it was interesting and good. In that order. The olive oil was really light and had a pretty strong floral essence to it, and I liked the sea salt in it a lot, but there looked to be so much more to try. So...the second time I went, I tried the cookies and cream and the salted caramel. WOW. That salted caramel is a piece of work. When you first taste it, it tastes like it's going to be super-sweet, but then all of the sudden the salty bit kicks in and it's a perfect balance. Oh, and the cookies and cream? Whatever those cookies are...they could kick Oreo's ass in a heartbeat.

SALTED CARAMEL ICE CREAM! Ê I went four times in one week..need I say more? Ê I love the salted caramel ice and coffee toffee. ÊI hate it when places go stingy on the toffee, but every bite I took into the coffee ice cream, ÊI got a piece of toffee. ÊEqual portions makes me happy. Ê The coffee toffee ice cream cake is delicious as well. ÊI had that for my birthday cake! Ê YUMMY! I also love the fact that you can get a card (10 punches, and you get 1 for free).

AMAZING. ÊI LOVE this place. Had the Salted Caramel and Balsamic Strawberry Ice Cream, both are just so perfect any time of the day. I will rave about this for a long time to come. Everything about the flavors here is spot on: Not too rich, not too salty or sweet, and not the slightest hint of anything artificial. Every ingredient is carefully chosen, organically produced, locally farmed, and it makes all the difference in the texture and taste of the ice cream. They choose their ingredients wisely at Bi-Rite and don't skimp with lesser quality fillers. I have been waiting a long time to try this place and it is EXACTLY what I was hoping for and more. I can't wait to come back for more, and next time- I'm definitely taking home a pint. Or two!

Fabulous ice cream....some of the best I've ever had in my life (and..I've had..a LOT....in fact, too much...sigh.) Not only do they have cool flavors, but they keep their ice cream traditional - thick, dense and creamy! For East Bay kids - I think it's better than Fentons (which I absolutely adore)....man, I feel bad for saying that.

Standing in line for ice cream in 50 degree weather at 10pm takes dedication. ÊI always thought people were crazy to stand in line on a chilly night for ice cream, but at Bi-Rite Creamery, I understand why. ÊRain or shine, there is always a line at Bi-Rite. ÊWhen I didn't think it could get any better, their new remodel includes a bakery next door! ÊYes! ÊA BAKERY!!!! Ê What's even better about Bi-Rite is that they have the most friendly staff and are super patient about giving patrons tastes of the different flavors. ÊThe last time, however, I was being helped by this nice guy who just came back from a smoke break and I felt like could taste the remnants of his cigarrette with my Ricanelas sample as if he scooped it with his own hands. ÊThis, however, did not prevent me from getting two scoops and a pint of Burnt Caramel to go! Ê Side note: So...is it bad that I put spoon to pint and almost finished it by myself in one sitting? My absolute Êfavorites have to be Burnt Caramel (of course...) and Roasted Banana. ÊScoop them in together and you get this oh-so-cream(er)y compostable (Yes, they're GREEN!!!) spoonful of goodness! Ê Buy a pack of chocolate cookes (or oatmeal) and eat them with your ice cream and...Enter: Nirvana.

Love it!! This was my second time visiting the shop. The first time, the line for ice cream was around the corner so we had their soft serve (which had no line, but limited selection). The soft serve was AMAZING. I would choose this option often. This time we arrived in the middle of the afternoon, and walked right up to the counter. The flavor selections are really creative, and they all sound amazing. I had a make your own sundae with one scoop salted caramel, one scoop malted vanilla, homemade hot fudge sauce, toasted almonds, and fresh whip cream.

The salted caramel ice cream is DIVINE. It really, really, really is. I would also recommend the mint chip, but then again it's my favorite flavor, so I suggest it regardless of where I am. Do not be afraid to just ask for a sample, despite the frenetic pace at which the line moves. N.B. Although a solid five, this place really isn't worth the line around the block on the weekends. I'd recommend buying a pint to go ($8) across the street at Bi-Rite Market, or going during off-peak hours, such as 3 pm on a weekday. Hey, Êno one actually works in SF, do they? ----------- P.S. Just made trip #2 to this place, simply because I walked by and there was no line. Sure, it was Sunday at Êbreakfast, but not only did I not give a toss about the time, I was able to leisurely sample at least 8 flavors before deciding (mint chip, as you might have expected.) What I learned is that the honey-lavender ice cream is incredible, orange cardamom sublime; malted vanilla with peanut butter and milk chocolate was divine and not too rich; and the buttered pecan was amazingly nutty and toasty. ÊDon't even get me started on the rocky road, or any of the other chocolate flavors. And FYI, a "single" permits the customer to choose two flavors.

During my days of school hopping, Tuesdays meant working at Mission H.S., which in turn, meant an indulgent scoop of orgasm in your mouth ice cream at Bi-Rite. ÊThey offer flavors, such as Salted Caramel, for the days I'm craving something both sweet and salty. ÊGenius! ÊHowever, my personal favorite is Coffee Toffee. ÊPerfect coffee ice cream with little toffee chips buried in every bite. ÊYUM!!! ÊThe kid's cup with a cone on top is just enough, but you can pack in two different flavors if you upgrade to the small. Depending on the day (sometimes a random Wednesday evening), there can be a line of people out the door, almost to the corner, but it's well worth the wait.

Although I feel like I'll get stoned to death by all the Bi-Rite fans because of my 3-star review, I just gotta say one thing - what's up with charging $3.25 for a single scoop of ice-cream? Maybe it's the incredibly high expectations, my desire for salt to simply bring out the flavor in sugar but not to over-power it, or memories of reasonably priced ice cream... I just wouldn't bother if it weren't for my friends salivating upon just hearing the word "bit-rite." Ê That being said, I do appreciate the focus on local, natural ingredients.

Salted caramel (with brownie bits) is a MUST. I don't think I would want to try a sundae even if I could stomach it. The ice cream is so rich and filling, but also so flavorful that all that other junk would probably take away from it. Great for before/after the park.

I can't believe I didn't find this place earlier! Being a SF foodie, it was sooo sad when my socal friend had to take me here. This place is known for using organic ingredients. They are pretty strick about closing on time, and we barely made it there before 11pm on a saturday night. Someone came out and cut off the line, so if you're not in line by 11...you'll be left empty-handed. A single scoop at $3.25 gives you an option to choose up to two flavors. Basically, they give you two scoops that fill up your cup. I chose Balsamic Strawberry and Mint Chip. Also, they offer Soy Chocolate, which gave my friend (who's allergic to dairy) something to be excited about. The texture and flavor make their product stand out from its competitors. MMMMMMMM SOOO GOOD! Each time you make a purchase, you get a stamp. And 10 stamps will earn you a free scoop. This place gives me a reason to drive all the way out to that neighborhood. Tip: this would be a great place to go to the next time there is a movie-in-the park at Dolores Park.

So I think everything that can be said already has but...the Peanut Butter Fudge swirl is the BEST flavor ever. Clearly Bi-Rite is the best damn ice cream, but I have a few critiques. 1) The line is always waaay too long--even when you go at "off" times. 2) It's price is unfortunately, and like most things in SF, more than it need be. My Solution: Skip the line and buy a pint from the freezer! You get more bang for the buck, and honestly, you know you could down a pint, no prob.

It was 9:53pm on a Thursday night. My roommate (and fellow Yelper) and a friend of mine were drinking some lovely homemade screwdrivers (Grey Goose and organic tangerine juice) when I suddenly had an intense craving for ice cream. Of course, as females, we do everything in herds, thus a minute later we were running down Dolores to hopefully make it to Bi-Rite Creamery before they closed at 10pm. We made it with one minute to spare! Out of breath and overwhelmed by the tantalizing flavors, I couldn't decide between two; not wanting to hold up the line, I ordered a half chocolate and half brown sugar cup. This clearly was the best decision, as I got two well-sized scoops, enough to ease my sugar cravings. I had just moved to San Francisco so this was my first experience with the pure joy that is Bi-Rite's ice cream. The first bite was... I don't even have a word for it. I fully expected the heavens to part and a beam of light (yes, even at night) to illuminate the divine treat in my hand. Both flavors were rich and creamy, without being too sweet. The chocolate had the sharp cocoa flavor I associate with good ice cream, and the brown sugar had the mouth melting taste that you get when you surreptitiously eat chunks of sugar when baking. Less than $9 to ease the ice cream cravings of 3 women? The best ice cream I've ever had? 3 blocks from my house? How could it possibly get any better?

This is the best ice cream I have ever had. Their Malted Vanilla is the best one that I've tried so far. ÊThe Salted Caramel was really good but ended up being a bit too rich for me after a few spoonfuls. ÊThe Roasted Banana tasted exactly like the name, really good but not great. The Malted Vanilla was so good that I bought some to take home and ate almost half of it. I had to force myself from finishing the whole thing. Needless to say, I'm going back there ASAP for the Malted Vanilla and to try all the other flavors. Parking is not so great since it's street parking. ÊDon't miss their grocery store acroos the street, lots of unique and hard to find foods.

Written by my 7-year-old: The ice cream was really good. We liked the ice cream but just didn't like the soft ice cream. My sister wanted to put 5 stars and my dad wanted to put 3 stars. We really liked the ice cream because the flavors were really special and it tasted really good. There was a long line and lots of people eating outside. There were really good flavors like malted vanilla with peanut brittle and chocolate,and salted caramel. I really liked it and I want to go there the next time I come to San Francisco. I am really glad that we went there.

Word of caution: parking sucks here (once my dad stood in an illegal parking spot while my mom and i ran inside to get ice cream. yeah so worth it). Second word of caution: their ice cream will spoil you and you will never go back to mediocrity ever again. Nevertheless, I'm just adding to the noise here. Not much new being said in my review, but it's amazing what fresh, natural ingredients can do to make a difference in creating good ice cream. Every flavor shines. I've had Salted Caramel Honey Lavender Cherry Almond Peanut Brittle The snickerdoodles one with the spanish name Balsamic Strawberry Creme Fraiche Ginger Caramel Roasted Banana Brown Butter Pecan and probably an S load of samples of all their other flavors OH crap! have I seriously eaten every single flavor in the store!? Says something about their ice cream. NOW GO.

Wow. 3238 reviews, I get it. The ice cream is good. Ê What ISN'T so tasty is finding a hair wrapped up IN my ice cream. As in, it wasn't sitting on the surface and in no way could it have been my own hair. Upon my discovery - unfortunately, I was more than halfway done - I looked up at the people working behind the counter. Every single one of them had long, unkempt hair. Ok, to be fair, one guy who was totally jamming to the music had somewhat-"done" hair, but he was bouncing around back there with no hair net or hat. One girl had long, loose pigtails coming down the front of her shoulders, with a hat loosely sitting on top. Another girl had a long side ponytail, also down the front of her shoulder, and an oversized beanie. Imagine, they all have to LEAN OVER to SCOOP the ice cream. With what looked like unwashed hair, inches away from the ice cream. It just repulsed me. I'm all for this hipster "style," but in such a fast, crowded food service place, cleanliness should come above all else. Bi-rite, please ask your employees to wear hair nets or tie their hair back, at the very least. I mean, they can be day-glo hair nets and ties.

The salted caramel is really good and so is the brown sugar. Went they melted together it became from cool to dammmmmmmn! The line is always hectic so be prepared to stand for a good 15 min. Dont be discouraged cuz they dont rush you when you are at the counter, Êso dont be afraid to ask to taste a few. i suggest you buy the double or the triple cuz its so good you will eat it quick.

Finally had a chance to try Bi-Rite. My nephews rave about this place so I was really looking forward to trying it. Parking is almost non-existent here. After about 15-20 minutes of looking we lucked out when someone left right in front of the creamery. By this time there was only a handful of people in line so we didn't have to wait too long. Decided to try the balsamic strawberry (definitely better than the balsamic caramel i tried at the other creamery) with mint chip and coffee crunch or something like that. The ice cream is very rich and creamy and very filling. The flavors don't seem to be as adventurous as Slocombe's but the flavors they do have they make it good. Will definitely visit here again.

Some pretty creative flavors, forcing me to go overboard and try the burnt caramel, honey lavender and cookies 'n cream all at one go. Although I hate jumping on bandwagons they definitely surpass other places in creativity. The ice cream is extremely rich so one scoop should be enough. Going all out and ordering three different flavors may actually muddle your experience a bit. If I lived in the neighborhood I would definitely be coming here on a regular basis to try each and every one of their interesting flavors.

Oh man... their ice cream is BOMB! They use organic ingredients and I don't know how they actually make it but their ice cream is always so creamy and light. They also combined flavors that I didn't think would go together, but it worked! My favorite flavor is the salted caramel! I don't usually like caramel because I think it's too sweet, but the added salt toned down the sweetness and it was just perfection. I've also had Sam's Sundae, which was featured on Food Network's "The Best Thing I've Ever Had." The sundae included vanilla bean ice cream, topped with bergamot olive oil, sea salt , and whipped cream. The bergamot was like an orange flavored olive oil and it gave the ice cream a slightly citrus flavor. Another flavor I recommend is the ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles). Cinnamon + snickerdoodles? How can you ever go wrong? Many people complimented the honey lavender flavor. I tasted it and it was good, but I felt like I should be smelling it instead of eating it. I wasn't a huge fan. Hands down, this is the best ice cream I've ever had!

Honey Lavender ice cream= NOM NOM NOM! One of the best flavors by far. I am not much of an ice cream person because it is often too heavy and overly sweet, but this flavor was perfect- not too sweet or heavy. Writing this review is making me crave it now. Though this flavor was awesome, on my second visit I decided to get a sundae and it was so overwhelmingly sweet and heavy that I got a tummy ache =(.

Who was at Bi-Rite when it was like..90 degrees in SF? I was. Not only was the line long, but that place was blasting some heat! Maybe it was the heat from the refrigeration, but it was just as hot inside as it was outside. Well, maybe this is their ploy to get people to buy more ice cream? Anyways. True to all the yelpers out there who have raved about the ice cream here, I tried their salted caramel, toasted coconut, and honey lavender. They were all delicious in their own way, but the lavender kind of made me feel like I was eating potpourri. Haha. I wish this place was a little bigger, because I love creameries like Fenton's, where I can sit down and enjoy a huge sundae in a roomy restaurant that has breezy cold a/c.

I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PLACE! Love that they do not rush you and let you try any flavor before you purchase. I always feel welcomed here, the customer service is always awesome and they're so friendly. The ice cream is pretty good too, no, it's AMAZIIIIIIIING. I cannot rave any more about it. I've been here several times, and will keep coming back because BiRite has earn my money and trust in delicious ice cream. The salted caramel, malted vanilla with peanut butter and milk chocolate pieces, and coffee toffee are my three absolute faves. I switch flavors and pair them with a double scoop on a waffle/sugar cone depending on my mood. The lines are long for a reason, but by the time you get to the front, omg, it's so awesome to point and laugh at the other customers whom are waiting in line to buy ice cream when you've got one in your hand. The first bite and it's def like a taste of heaven in your mouth (not that I'd know what heaven tastes like) but the ice cream sure does a real good job at telling me. I'm like a like kid at the candy shop when it comes to me and ice cream. MMMMM so good, think I might have to pay BiRite a visit soon, my ice cream senses are ticking. happy eating! :)

Seasonal flavors are the best--my faves are pumpkin (fall) and egg nog (winter).

ÊSalted caramel is a staple. ÊBi-Rite's ice cream in general is good, but I just don't get all the hype.

The salted pecan toppings got me! Of course I gotta try this salted caramel ice cream everyone's talking about. Pretty darn good! The honey lavander was very good too! I'm surprised at how strong the scent was. Just don't get it with other ice cream flavors, the herb scent kinda throws everything off. Though the ice cream itself is not the bestest ever, it is darned good and the toppings and fudge were awesome so the resulting sundaes are definitely worth making the trip and lining up for. Aside from the build your own sundae with the aforementione flavors, we had the brownie sunday and the banana split. Very good. Also had the roasted banana ice cream and chocoloate ice cream. If I didn't know the flavor, I wouldn't recognice the banana or the roasted in the roasted banana ice cream. Chocolate was good though. But of course, cant go wrong iwth that!

I am not much of an ice cream fan that is why my good friend badgered me to come try to this place. Bi-Rite Creamery is definitely one of a kind. The line forms well around the block and good luck finding parking because the park across the seat is a big hit in the city. Also, beware for there is no reception/3g around that area so waiting in line was a lot harder than expected. I really commend this place for having such unique flavors and combinations. I was able to taste a few flavors, ricanelas was one of my favorites, which was ice cream mixed with snickerdoodles. I also had the malted vanilla with peanut brittle and balsamic strawberry which was a little off for my taste. According to reviews and friends, next time I will try the salted caramel and roasted banana! And Bi-Rite also goes eco friendly with rewashing tasting spoons, yay for the environment!

Came here for dessert one night on a weekend. Parking wasn't easy. When we got to the store front, there was a line down the block..this was 20 minutes prior to their closing time! We didn't really know what to get so we tried the Salted Caramel, Honey Lavender and Earl Grey. Earl Grey was the best flavor..very light and refreshing. Salted Caramel was a bit too sweet for our liking. Honey-Lavender the taste reminded me of smelling potpourri.. Worth a trip to stop by here! The employees were upbeat and friendly.

I had con my bf into waiting in the line with me at Bi-Rite Creamery tonight, but I somehow managed to! Go me! :) I had never been before, and you know, if you go around touting yourself as an all-knowing SF foodie, as I do, there becomes a point when there are like, responsibilities and expectations to live up to. I felt like I was slacking, you know, having not been to the famed Bi-Rite Creamery!!! ÊAll these people were like talkin the talk and I was mum. Not cool, not cool at all... Anyways, it was a warmish evening at around 10 pm, and we waited outside for about twenty-five minutes, at least. I probably eves-dropped on the convo of the ppl standing in front of me just a tad too much, but hey, you've gotta do something to get by! Finally got inside and my bf was hellbent on trying the "Sam's Sunday": chocolate ice cream with some kind of gourmet olive oil and salt. I said, umm, yeah, NO. He said, hey, we've waited in line so long, we might as well get something really exciting. I said that's EXACTLY WHY I don't want to get it...when I've waited this long, I want to get something semi-safe that I know I'll like, not something that involves olive oil and salt (I mean, I'm sure there's something special and different about, but tonight I wasn't willing to find out). We ended up going out with a two-scooper of roasted banana and butter pecan, along with a pint of the ever-so-popular salted caramel. Then we sat outside to dig in. Well, I'll definitely say this: I liked it more than Mitchell's. Now, I'm sure that statement means different things to different people, but I stand firm. I found the flavors of the Bi-Rite ice cream to very complex (and significantly more experimental and gourmet) than anything I've ever had at Mitchell's. I know Mitchell's specializes in Tropical flavors, and that's cool and all, but when it comes to ice cream, I think I prefer the more unique balanced flavors and combinations that Bi-Rite had to offer. I'm giving four stars, just because I'm not a huge ice cream eater in the first place...as much as I enjoy it, I'm a more of a savory eater, and ice cream isn't a must-have for me, like it is for some...so that's just a personal take, but if I'm gonna have ice cream, I'd definitely come here!

I cannot add anything that probably hasn't been said (at the date of writing this) 227 times before. ÊIts good. ÊThey have boutique ice cream and likewise dessert stuff. ÊIts Bi-Rite.

The line is almost always out the door, but with good reason. Ê The ice cream is pheonomenal. ÊEach and every flavor I've tried. ÊIf I were to choose among the many great ice cream parlors in SF, this would be a first choice. Flavors I've tried: * Salted Caramel * Roasted Banana Creme Fraiche Mint Chip Balsamic Strawberry Honey Lavender * Vanilla Malt Toffee Chip * = my favorites.

Well, The selection was OK. I kinda expected more based on what my friends kept raving about. They definitely got an extra star for turning the lights down and singing happy birthday to my friend. The ice cream flavors are really unique but I'm still faithful and in love to another.

The salted caramel and the coffee toffee was the best thing after a day in Dolores Park. I cannot wait to go back and try everything else, which I wanted, but refrained from ordering lest I look like a pig.

I had heard good things about bi-rite, so I was excited to finally check it out. I was told to try the Honey Lavender, which I thought was a very interesting ice cream flavor, but it was delicious. The selection of ice cream flavors at Bi-Rite truly shows what a creative mind, and desire to push the limits can create. Not the traditional baskin robbins ice cream here, and that's a good thing. It's a small shop, and when I went it wasn't too crowded, but I suspect this place can get quite busy once the heat arrives. I'll be back.

We walked in and thought, "Rejoice for there are no lines!" We finished our order, turned around and there was a line of people streaming out the door. The ice cream's good, but Sam hates you and Sam hates sundaes. Salt doesn't really belong in big crunchy clumps on ice cream. Or is the salt not to be eaten? Did it serve a role in maintaining the integrity of the ice cream? ÊDoes Sam love freezing point depression?

Many of my best friends are people I disliked upon first meeting. Now that can be extended to ice cream. Bi-Rite didn't make much of an initial impression but now it's probably my favorite ice cream shop in the entire US. I eat a lot of ice cream. I got the Sam's Sundae and a scoop of the honey lavender because I was there from out of town and didn't know if there would be a second time. After a few bites of the Sam's Sundae, I was struggling to finish it. I look back on it now and like it better upon further reflection but I can't get over the fact I ate ice cream topped with oil and salt. Did I finally reach the limits of my gluttony? Did the word "excess" actually resonate within me? Not quite. My friend wanted to return the next day before leaving San Francisco so I took her to eat honey lavender ice cream, which I enjoyed. Then I sampled and sampled. The cinnamon snickerdoodle flavor, orange cardamom, balsamic strawberry, salted caramel. Each one was a cold, creamy revelation in itself. I finally settled on orange cardamom after which my friend said "Wow, this ice cream by itself makes me sad to leave San Francisco." I came back my last night in SF and ate the toasted coconut (the best coconut ice cream I have ever eaten) and malted vanilla with milk chocolate and peanut brittle. I agreed with my friend's earlier statement. Bi-Rite, why do you have to be across the country?

This place is much more crowded about 30 min. before it closes! The roasted banana and coffee toffee were mouthwatering! I don't know how they achieve the flavor in the roasted banana, but it's so great! It's like eating an actual roasted banana, but you're licking an ice cream scoop! And the coffee toffee had BIG chunks of toffee which were YUM!

Ok there are already 1000+ reviews for this place so everyone knows its delicious already but man I still have to write out it.

Mmmm, the ice cream here is sooo friggin good. Just how good are we talking? It was a rainy, cold December nite in SF and there was no way I wasn't going to finish my cup. The people that work here are really nice. They let us try a bunch of different flavors and they took the time to explain things. The ricanelas (it's sort of like a cross between a horchata with bits of snickerdoodles) and double ginger were my favs (i was in a Christmasy, gingerbread mood). The salted caramel was quite memorable as well (damn the 2 flavor limit for a small cup!). Try the honey lavender too, but personally, I'm not a huge fan of things that taste like flower. But it was unique, I'll give it that, and something you should definitely try at least once if you go

Good idea with the creative flavors, but the flavors really didn't pack a punch. We had the salted caramel and some sort of toffee one or something.

I daydream about Bi-Rite constantly: at work, waiting at the stoplight, getting my haircut, doing my laundry, during 8 mile runs, while I'm eating ice cream that isn't from Bi-Rite...you get the point.

On the Big Eat SF top 100 list... and the salted carmel ice cream did not disappoint! This was perhaps the oddest and yet most incredibly delicious ice creams I have ever tasted. I complimented it with a small scoop of the roasted banana flavor as well (by suggestion of the kind lady serving me). Decent price for a single (two small scoops) for $3.25 and a great treat to walk to the bus with after the let down at Dolores Park (see my review on the 2nd annual Norcal Regional Grilled Cheese Invitational...) Check one off the list with a smile on my face and a tasty treat digesting in my stomach. :)

Last weekend was one of the first sunny weekends in San Francisco. Slightly windy, but sunny nonetheless. I woke up and thought: "It's a Dolores Park day." After a picnic of baguettes, salami, Italian truffle cheese (from Trader Joe's - REALLY good!) we looked at the line for Bi-Rite and decided it was a must. I had only been here once before, and had never waited in line. The anticipation grew with every minute. Finally we were up at the counter. Honey lavender or salted caramel? I couldn't decide. I got both. 10 minutes of pure ice cream cone joy followed.

Bi-rite is at the top of SF's ice cream list along with Mitchell's and Polly Ann's. Each one has a special place in our heart. If Mitchell's is old-fashioned goodness and Polly Ann's is Asian fusion, well, Bi-rite is gourmet ice cream. The first thing you'll remember about Bi-rite is it's space. It's located a block away from Dolores Park, so on hot summer days, you and your friends should hop on over and grab a cone or two. There are no yogurt shops around, so this is one nabe that's fad-free. So far, we've liked every flavor we tried: salted caramel, creme fraiche, honey lavender, ginger brown sugar, coconut, and cinnamon with snicker doodle. However, salted caramel is our tried-and-true favorite. Parking can be a bit tough in this area, so be aware of the $10 taxi ride out to the Dolores Park. That's a $15 all-inclusive ice cream for you, but it's worth every penny.

Yes, definitely believe the hype! This past Friday was my first Bi-Rite experience and what perfect timing it was! We got there before the crowd officially formed around the block! I had a single combo of the chocolate love and the salted caramel. The sis had the chocolate love and the boy had the single combo of chocolate love and coffee toffee. He liked them both of them and really, it was just the perfect time to enjoy and experience their ice cream. I loved the salted caramel and will probably order it alone next time around.

I'll keep this one short because this place gets reviewed up the hizzle. Favorite flavors (in order): Sam's Sundae (ask a scoop of vanilla instead of chocolate, the bergamot olive oil and sea salt really taste good with vanilla), honey lavendar, salted caramel, ginger (in all its forms), cinnamon, pumpkin, vegan chocolate. I finally got to try balsamic strawberry, since it's a seasonal flavor. It was okay, it tasted more like plain strawberry with a hint of salt. People are awfully nice and very upbeat. Bi-Rite FTW!

On the hottest day of this summer, we were in the Castro watching the parade and the perfect way to beat the heat was to have some ice cream! It just happened that we saw this little cute place across the street. I'm soooo happy we decided to wait in line and get yummy ice cream! I'm a pretty big ice cream eater and this is definitely hands down the best ice cream I've ever had. I had the honey lavendar and the black cherry almond.

Monday night was my first visit to Bi-Rite! ÊAnd all I can say is HOW DID IT TAKE ME 23 YEARS TO TRY THIS PLACE!? ÊIt is officially my favorite ice cream shop in the city! ÊThe Honey Lavender and Brown Sugar will be my reasons for coming back. I went with a bunch of girlfriends after dinner and we were all trying it for the first time. ÊOh boy...we were such nubes! 1. "Dude, the line is so long!" (Of course the line is soo long...the ice cream waiting inside is sooo good.) 2. "What flavors should we get?" Ê(Well, obviously according to Yelp reviews, the Salted Caramel and Honey Lavender) 3. "Can I try this this this and that?" (The server was definitely going to kill us.) 4. "I felt so rushed! I couldn't pick my second flavor." (No excuse for this one.) 5. "The Salted Caramel was really...salty" Ê(My friend said that my palate is not sophisticated enough to appreciate it.) Well next time, I will no longer be a nube! This is going to be a regular spot from now on! P.S. I tried to return the next day but it was closed. True story.

This place is average, at best. ÊYeah, the ice cream tasted pretty good, but I think I'm just spoiled by living close to Mitchell's. ÊHere are the reasons Bi-Rite is inferior to Mitchell's: 1. Mitchell's has more flavors and more variety of flavors. 2. Oreo Cookie is tastier at Mitchell's (this is the true litmus test of any ice cream place). 3. Mitchell's is creamier. 4. Wooden spoons??? ÊReally??? ÊGross! 5. Lining up outside is not as good as the number system Mitchell's uses. Within SF, I'd say Polly Ann's is also better than Bi-Rite. ÊI'm glad I went to try it, but I'll probably only go back if I'm in the area anyway, with so many other superior ice cream options in the city.

I usually just get a small because there is so much flavor you don't really need that much. All of the ice cream here is great, but I want to suggest Honey Lavender.

I don't know how my taste buds have wandered so far away from the masses and as I write this, I am ashamed of what I am about to say but the ice cream was too creamy and the flavors too intense for me. I got the salted caramel and honey lavender. I love honey lavendar in gelato form but as an ice cream, the lavendar was overpowering. At first it was delicious and then I felt my taste buds drowning in an oversaturation of flavors. And that sounds like it should be an amazing thing, but it wasn't. The boyfriend and I tried to share a double and we both had to stop and drink water before continuing. I don't know whats wrong with me but I refuse to believe my taste buds don't like sugary, salty, creamy flavor so I'll definitely try this place again and try different flavors next time.

The Good: + great quality + unusal flavors + great location near Dolores Park + they're eco friendly - they use metal taster spoons instead of plastic ones and disposable cups The bad - kind of pricey, single scoop @ $3.25 but at least you get two flavors - not a lot of inside seating, though they have benches outside - but not ideal during windy/foggy/rainy weather Flavors worth trying: * Earl Grey - tastes like milk tea! * Chocolate Coconut (vegan) - you wouldn't even know you're missing the milk! * Roasted Banana - wow!

Honey Lavander...amazing... Despite the line out the door, it moves quickly and is worth it. Reason it moves so quickly? The people who work there are impatient jerks. Everytime I've been there, some man is working (I'm assuming he's the owner being in his 40s, working at an ice-cream creamery) is always yelling "Next! What can I get you? It tastes how it sounds, now what do you want? NEXT!" Super rude...if I want a taste then give me a damn taste or I'm keeping my $3.50!

You can't go wrong here! Quality homemade ice cream and baked goods but an extra star for unique flavors. I actually tried Earl Grey Ice Cream the other day. Honestly, it was not my favorite, a little strong for my taste, but I was just impressed by the creativity of it. My all time favorite is the Ricanelas (snickerdoodle with lots of cinnamon. But the coffee toffee is also really good (not for the moderate coffee lover). I also love the popsicles very refreshing! But the snickerdoodle cookies are just like grandma used to make. Which probably means they have more butter in them than I'd care to know about. Just don't tell me the details!

I can't get enough of the salted caramel ice cream. All the other flavors are creative and delicious, but I always get the salted caramel (the taste of salt is very mild, rest assured). The cookies and brownies are solid, but the ice cream stands out and needs no adornment (e.g., cones, cookies, toppings, etc.). The lines appear prohibitively long, but they move quickly. Street parking is scarce, so I would park a few blocks away and walk.

There is usually a huge line out the door on weekends. But ÊI went with a couple of friends during the day on New Years Eve 2009 and there weren't many people. This place is delightful. They have very unique flavors and the ice cream is very creamy. ÊShared the Sam's Sundae. I would recommend a tad less salt. But I love sweet and salty combinations so I thought it was overall pretty good. Waiting for another good time to go back without waiting in a line that goes around the block.

Trust me when I say that if you plan to go overboard, indulge, bomb your gut, bust your diet, feed your sweet tooth, act like a 5 year old or whatever you call your visit to Bi-Rite, know that you'll never have such a good time stuffing your face with the creamiest of desserts while walking around the Mission trying to burn it off simultaneously. We stood in line for about 30 minutes like it was the freakin' Indiana Jones ride and then once we got through the door and up to the counter it was the fastest 2 minutes that went by as I tried to sample flavor after flavor before the people behind me started breathing heavy sighs of impatience. Next time, I will NOT be deterred by sugar-fiending foodies because I deserve to savor the bliss of each spoonful because gosh darnit I stood in that line in the San Francisco cold. So why am I getting freezing ice cream? Because there's such a thing as a brownie sundae with my choice of 3 different ice cream flavors, of which salted caramel MUST be one. Not to mention, the workers behind the counter hustle their bustle and get you your ice cream pronto. Prices are reasonable for the hype and prestige surrounding this place. Here's the breakdown of the flavors I got (a list which I only hope to expand in the very near future): Cookies and cream: Great flavor, nice chunks of cookie, but probably one I would skip next time, just because of the commonality of it. Chocolate: Decadent, delectable, delicious. Salted caramel: Don't ask questions. Just ask for a sample. Then go fill a cup or cone with this salty sweet confection.

Mmmm....I LOVE their salted caramel ice cream. It's absolutely sublime! ÊRich, creamy caramel with just a hint of salt on the finish - it was decadence and elegance in the same bite. Ê The roasted banana is my other favorite. Ê Do I think Bi-Rite is better than Mitchell's Ice Cream? It's a very tough call...Bi-Rite's flavors are more gourmet and unique, but I like Mitchell's just a tinsy bit more because their ice cream is creamier and has a more home-made feel to it. However, both places offer such a completely different variety of flavors that my recommendation would be to choose the place based on what type of flavor you're craving that day. You can't go wrong with either place!

After walking down from Dolores Park, we headed over to the raved-over Bi-Rite Creamery. ÊI'm glad that the wait wasn't 45 minutes that day, like so many people mentioned. Ê Of course I had to sample the flavors when we did get up there, though :) ÊI did try the salted caramel, but honestly it was too sweet for me; I don't think I could have handled more than that little spoonful of it. ÊI shuddered. ÊThe ginger was SUPER gingery! I liked the ice cream; I especially appreciate that it's from local farms with organic products; how nice!

I came here for a late night snack a few weeks ago. Even though we came close to 10pm, the line was out the door and to the end of the block! However, the weather was nice (and warm) enough that we didn't mind waiting outside for a bit. I ended up ordering the salted caramel and coffee toffee. I have to say -- the salted caramel was my favorite! No wonder everyone raves about it. The coffee toffee wasn't bad either, though the wonderfulness of the salted caramel flavor really stood out to me. I definitely want to come back and try the other flavors! -L.

I've been to Bi-Rite a few times in my visits out to the Bay Area, and this has to be the best ice cream shop I've been to. First things first - if you're going to go on a day where it isn't that warm outside, bring something to bundle up in...you're almost always going to have to wait in line. It's also a pain finding street parking, so it's always a bit of an experience just getting down Bi-Rite. But once you get your hands on the ice cream, wow is it good. I think the worst (if you want to call it that) flavor I've had is the honey lavender, which was unlike any other flavor I've tasted. I probably wouldn't eat it on a regular basis, but the infusion of a...flowery taste with honey was unique. I'm a huge fan of the cookies & cream (very standard) and the ricanelas, which is a cinnamon lover's dream. My girlfriend is a huge fan of the ice cream, but she absolutely adores the almond toffee topping. You're going to have to wait it out to get your ice cream fix, but it's definitely worth it. If you're visiting San Francisco, find a way to take half an hour, maybe an hour, to head out to Mission District and hit up Bi-Rite. If it's a nice day out, you can just walk on over to Dolores Park and savor heaven in a cone (or cup).

Forget the line! Head over to the Frozen Yogurt counter! The flavors frequently change. I got the salted caramel swirl--a mountain of creamy, melty, delight piled high on my tiny cone. I licked my happiness away. I tried Sam's sundae-- do it only if you're in the mood to be adventurous. Too salty, too chocolately, too oily! I guess that's what I should have expected...but this was the first time a sundae went unfinished. Mishaps happen! But I assure you, the frozen yogurt never fails.

Bi-Rite is top notch. Personally, I like it better than Mitchell's. I would say it's more comparable to Ici in Berkeley, in terms of the flavor variety. I really enjoyed the salted caramel. It's a lot sweeter and less salty than I was expecting. It was actually a lot better than Ici's "burnt caramel" flavor in my opinion. I also stopped by their soft serve stand. That would probably earn 4 stars..it was good, not as great as their traditional ice cream. Prices are fair. $2.25 for kids size (one scoop), $3.25 for small size (1-2 flavors) and somewhere in the $4-$5 ranges for the medium & larges. I would highly recommend this place! But..parking is a toughy!

I heard about this place from a coworker and I had to try it out. ÊI was told they had many different flavors to choose from and the following three flavors I had selected were referred by my fellow friends. I only tried the salted caramel, earl grey and honey lavender topped with blueberries and macadamia nuts. Ê 1.) The salted caramel tasted like caramel popcorn, which was the exact flavor I was imagining when I had read the name and took my first bite. 2.) Earl grey tasted like the earl grey tea. ÊIt was really refreshing,. reminded me of drinking a black tea unsweetened from Starbucks 3.) The honey lavender was bLEHH,. the taste reminded me of being in a bathroom; the taste/smell of bathroom spray. Bi-Rite served up some unique flavored ice cream, that I had to take two scoops of the salted caramel to go and have the *FAT BOYS* try it. ÊThey LOVED IT! Ê Def a place I will be coming back to

Ê I went with Will W who had the clever idea to add creme fraiche ice cream to our sundae. ÊI often see lines here and now I know why.

I loved all the unique flavors here! It's such a fun place to check out, especially on a sunny day, and so close to the park as well! I wish I had gotten to try the Balsamic strawberry but I felt bad getting as many samples as I did in the first place.. but everything was so good! The honey lavender was amazing, and the mint chip although not unique was perfect. The salted caramel was just ok, but I loved the malted vanilla with pecan brittle and milk choc fudge. Heaven. Even the brown sugar with ginger crystals was great. We are fatties and foodies and couldn't resist this place. We HAD to go back for seconds, we just had to.

Dear Mitchell's, I'm having an affair with Bi Rite and I just can't choose between you two. I'm torn, I tell you. Torn in half. You're an old standby for Filipino flavors, but when have you tried something new? Bi Rite trills and excites me with roasted banana, brown sugar, and strawberry balsamic. When was the last time you did strawberry balsamic for me? I can't think of a single instance and quite frankly, I need that kind of excitement in a ice cream shop. I guess what I'm saying is I'm at a cross roads. I'll admit, your parking lot is pretty sweet, but it's alway full on hot night. I need to go out and try new things and experiences. Maybe once I try Bi Rite's salted caramel I'll decide. Until then, I'll call you. I take that back, maybe I'll text you or meet you somewhere like Pacific Super so we can talk it out. Christine

It feels futile to review this place as it has the gravitational pull of SF behind it, but I just want to make one more pitch for the soft serve...because some kaboshers in my sphere of influence (as in, those who influence me) had been naysaying aforesaid soft serve, saying it was just "ok" as compared to the hallmark hard stuff. Well, I'm here to officially kabosh the kaboshers and say: the soft serve ROCKS!! The basic flavors are indeed great, and how nice that the hallmark salted caramel is also a SS option! Consequently, the soft serve line, which only a few months ago was in its embryonic stages and functioned as a quicker alternative to the nearly omnipresent long line for the classic stuff, has also grown into a Line of Its Own. And well worth it. Life has truly zenithed when it's a sunny Sunday, the park beckons nearby, and a cup of melting sweet creamy Bi-Rite goodness sits in your hand. p.s. the service is awesome too, btw - always friendly, prompt and anticipatory...but I am vowing to never regress to my lethal habit of taking home pints...

Still on the quest to complete the Big Eat! Salted Caramel: ÊThis is creamy, salty and burnt tasting with a bit of a grainy texture and smooshed together in one heavenly scoop of perfection. Chocolate Coconut: Ê This is my favorite even over the salted caramel. ÊI wish I could get an IV of this injected into my veins every morning. It's vegan, and I have no clue how you make ice cream this good without milk or eggs. Ricanelas: Ohhhhhh cinnamon and snickerdoodles! ÊI tried this one, but I imagine that if you got a full scoop, you would be chunks of snickerdoodle in every bite. Roasted Banana: This was the only one I didn't like...it was way too banana-y for me. Balsamic Strawberry: A creative flavor, but I don't think I would ever order a scoop of it.

Definitely a solid ice cream place. I can't say it's better or worse than Mitchell's, but what I can say is that it's different. It's flavor's dont necessarily compare to Mitchell's.

I love Bi-Rite! I don't mind waiting in line for food so long as it's great. Having said that, you'll never hear me complain about waiting for Bi-Rite's ice cream. I can hardly contain my excitement as I get closer and closer to the front of the line. I appreciate that the staff is always patient with me when I ask if I can try different flavors and continue to be patient with me as I stand there battling my indecisiveness. I usually go with a single with two flavors. Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Chocolate Pieces - My favorite! The crunchiness of the peanut brittle adds another depth of texture and flavor to the creaminess of the ice cream. Coffee Toffee - You'll like this if you enjoy a more subtle coffee flavor. I prefer a more intense coffee flavor in my ice cream. ( Humphrey Slocombe makes a great Blue Bottle Coffee ice cream.) Toasted Coconut - I had a sampler. There was a very slight nutty taste and the coconut was very refreshing. You can't go wrong with the Salted Caramel and Brown Butter Pecan either. Just thinking about it is making me salivate...

It only took me four years, but I finally made it to bi-rite for a little ice cream. ÊTwice, actually. I have to say it was good, but not great. ÊThe line went by quickly, the servers were as friendly as one could be when serving massive amounts of people ... but the ice cream left something to be desired. ÊHere are my descriptions of the five flavors I tasted: 1. Salted Caramel - My favorite flavor. Ê The salty-sweet combo was spot on. 2. Roasted banana - The banana part was great, but there was something off about the roasted part. Ê 3. Brown Sugar - Another great flavor. ÊIt's different and tasty. 4. Balsamic Strawberry - Not my cup of tea at all. 5. Malted Vanilla Êw/ Peanut Brittle - There was no peanut brittle in scoop my malted vanilla and the vanilla was bland. ÊMaybe it was just a bad batch? *Bonus tip: ÊIf you've never been here before, stay away from the ice cream that looks like it's only had a scoop or two taken out of the container. They're probably not that good.

ÊAmazing combination already, but to top it off, they caramelize your banana with a blow torch and add hot fudge, fresh whipped cream and nuts...heavenly. I also tried the Sam's Sundae with chocolate ice cream, bergamot olive Olive oil and sea salt and whipped cream.

I'll have to give a fairer review when I actually buy my own scoop, but here is my rating of the licks gleaned from generous friends. Not much to say, except perhaps, wayy better than the overhyped Ici. The prices about match up, but the similarities end there. Yes, Ici is more warm, inviting and precious. They do give you homemade cones w/ a small bite of chocolate ganache at the bottom. But at Ici's, I feel like I'm paying out of my ass for Alice Water's namesake. The flavors read like a perfumery rather than a dessert shop. In contrast, Bi-rite is a little less pretentious, a little more homey. I tried the malted vanilla, the coffee, and the strawberry sorbet. The former two were creamy and distinct, and not too overbearing. The strawberry sorbet tasted like fresh strawberries... but frozen and pureed! Still, the price is steep, and I can't get over the name... Bi-Rite. It sounds like a discount grocery outlet rather than an artisanal ice creamery. Bottom Line: For those bad, bad days when you really need a pick-me-up without the hangover.

I've never been a fan of sweets, or long lines, or traveling anywhere far with busy streets to get something I don't even really like. However, after getting a gift card here, I couldn't resist but to try the place. I read reviews here to try flavors like salted caramel, honey lavender, and other flavors that I am just not used to. I came here with two friends and we got different flavors to try. I stuck with something close to "normal" flavors and I got malted vanilla with peanut butter brittle, and balsamic strawberry. My friend got honey lavender and another friend got honey lavender. Tried them both, didn't like it as much as my own. However, I will say the ice cream was better than other places I've had. The ice cream was SWEET and CREAMY and deeeeeeeeeeelicious. I have a pint of ice cream waiting for me in my freezer, PEACE OUT!

tried two things from here so far - sam's sundae and the twist softserve that they offer on saturdays (balsamic strawberry and vanilla flavors). both these items were amazing. the chocolate ice cream didn't have the powdery or bitterness that chocolate ice creams tend to have (i'm not a big fan of chocolate ice cream) and surprisingly, the bergamot olive oil made it even better! i wasn't sure whether i was going to like it because i don't really like adding olive oil to stuff, but wowwwwww. i now love bergamot and chocolate together! (recchiuti has a bergamot ganache, also delicious). vanilla soft serve - very good! it didn't have that artificial vanilla extract feeling, enough vanilla to make it super flavorful but not overpowering. super creamy, wonderful texture. balsamic strawberry soft serve omgggggg. i was skeptical because i DO NOT like balsmic vinegar. but this was....ridiculously good. i am now a balsamic strawberry convert and a soft serve convert. you can taste the flavors of soft serves so much more than with regular ice cream gonna try to come here on different days of the week so i can try all the flavors of their soft serve (and then several more days to try all their ice cream...hah)

This is the best ice cream that I've tasted thus far. I went here once on a sunny Sunday afternoon, and you know that there will be a line forming around the corner on a sunny day. My friends and I waited about half an hour until we got in the ice cream shop. I ordered the salted caramel and honey lavender on a cone. The salted caramel was my FAVORITE! It tasted so good. You definitely need to try the salted caramel here. The honey lavender tasted like what you would smell when you walk into Bath & Body Works, but I still enjoyed it. I don't think I would be getting that flavor again though. It's hard to find parking around here. You can also go to Dolores Park to enjoy your ice cream with other people as well :)

I also got to try the white chocolate/raspberry and then lavender/honey flavors. I went there on a wednesday night and was lucky to not have to wait in line!

I love salted caramel candy, so I was couldn't-contain-myself excited when I discovered a local establishment serving Salted Caramel ice cream. ÊThe ice cream, however, just didn't live up to the wait-in-line-for-45 minutes-in-windy-cold-SF hype. ÊThere was a slight bitter after taste from the strong caramel flavor. ÊMaybe I just prefer more of a milky caramel. ÊOh well, at least I got to cross off another must-do on the list. P.S. Don't hate me for the 3 stars! ÊI'm a good person, I swear!

i'll let you in on a secret. Êi wasn't big on bi-rite when i first tried it. Êi'm talking about the salted caramel here. Êi didn't like the salted caramel (insert gasp here). Êi just didn't get the hype. Êevery time i revealed that to someone, they would look at me like i had just admitted to killing a dog. Êwith my bare hands. Êseriously, they would be beyond offended. Êi don't know what it was though, maybe those were my rebellious, defiant, go-against-the-grain years. so i spent some time in bi-rite exile (it was called nyc), where i still had a fair share of good ice cream. Êbut now i'm back and i decided to give bi-rite another try. Êi don't know what happened between then and now (maybe nyc helped me develop functional taste buds), but to those of you who i may have offended before with my negative declaration of the salted caramel, i'm truly sorry. Êtruly truly sorry. Êi can't explain my callous opinion in the past, but i get it now. Êto prove i really mean it, i'll eat as many scoops of salted caramel as you want. Êno, really, i will.

This place is incredible. This is one of those "I can't believe I JUST discovered this place after living 21 years in the bay area" kind of places. I'm normally not too big on ice cream. Whatever comes from the grocery store is usually good enough for me. But this place put my ice cream taste buds into a whole new perspective. The first time I came here, I decided to be adventurous and order Sam's Sundae, because I was so intrigued by having olive oil and ice cream mixed together. No way that would taste good I thought, but my friend was telling me that it was on the Food Network before so I had to give it a try. Oh man this was one of the best things I've ever had in my life. It felt like I had every single taste in my mouth at once. Sweet from the ice cream and whipped cream, sour and Êsalty from the sea salt, bitter from the olive oil. Everything cept spice, which I'm kinda glad wasn't there. The second time I came I got a Ice Cream sandwich with peach ice cream and sugar cookies. Oh man the cookies were amazing and the ice cream was super smooth. Made me wish I hadn't shared with a friend so I could've been a glutton monster and had the whole thing to myself. My only gripe about this place is the super long line, even up till closing. Waiting in line during a cold night in SF isn't all that fun, but the end result is worth it. This place literally puts a smile on your face that will stay there for the rest of they day. Did you just have a good day in SF? Then end it right by coming here. Did you just have a bad day in SF? Then turn it into a good day just with one visit to this ice cream shop.

School's about to start for me, and I had to check this off on my summer to-do list. Check! The line wasn't terribly long, I waited for about five minutes? Not too bad Êat all, in comparison to my five-hour wait in line on the last day of Ike's.. oh lord. When I got to the counter, I wanted to taste the balsamic strawberry because the name sounded so appealing, plus, who doesn't like strawberries? It wasn't anything out of the ordinary. I decided to go with salted caramel and honey lavender, just because these flavors don't appear frequently on other shop's menus. It was pretty worth it for two scoops at $3.25! The salted caramel tasted exactly like the top of a creme brulee - a caramelized, burnt flavor. Definitely should try this flavor for all you creme brulee lovers (me!) The honey lavender was like some aromatherapy-esque flavor. Yes, weird, unique, but I still liked it. It uncannily smells like hand lotion, or hand soap. I mean hey, if you ever wanted to eat your lotion or soap, here's the edible form for that! One star off, sadly, because the ice-cream was not kept at a temperature ice-cream should be kept at. It was already starting to melt, and it was not hot today.. (when was it ever hot in SF, anyway?)

i feel like an idiot because it took me sooo long to actually go to bi-rite, i blame it on the ridiculously long line that's perpetually formed out the door. So it makes sense that i finally went in on a whim, when, as i was walking by, I saw that there were only FOUR people in line! I found out that that was because they were just past closing, but i pouted my lips and the sweet, sweet doorman let me in to convert me to their sweet sweet ice cream cult of deliciousness. i got cinnamon ice cream with pieces of snickerdoodle, an ice cream combination i often search for but rarely (more like, never) find. the name escapes me because it was so good. I digress, think about it, where else would there be a line to eat ice cream in the middle of a cold night in january? That line speaks for itself, and I am now happy to be a part of it (but, thankfully, their service is fast so it moves quickly). enjoy!

It's all about the Salted Carmel= perfectly satisfying, surprising, and unique. ÊThe great thing is, however, that even a single dish allows you to choose two flavors, so try another flavor but never miss out on the salted carmel. ÊEver. ÊI've tried other flavors and I'm always pretty happy- brown sugar w/ ginger (not enough ginger so watch out for your expectations), creme fraiche (my second favorite), blackberry white chocolate, malted vanilla w/ butter pecan- but I always wish I at least had a little Salted Carmel. Ê I love that they let you try bites before you order so you don't have to blindly choose your $4 small cup and be disappointed.

Just did a self-guided food tour of San Francisco/Berkeley/Oakland (including: Commis, Chez Panisse Cafe, Delfina Pizzeria, Range, Bi-Rite Creamery, Tartine, Vik's Chaat Corner and La Rose Bistro, etc.) I am going to forego my lengthy reviews and write several short ones - well, I'll try to keep it short at any rate. CUT TO THE CHASE: Bi-Rite has my favorite flavor of ice cream that I have ever eaten - SALTED CARAMEL - hands down the richest and most effective flavor of ice cream ever! EVER! And the best ice cream I have had in these United States. (Gelato we can argue about later - here, we are talkin' Ice Cream.) In Paris, Bertillon serves a Dried Plum and Armagnac Ice Cream that made me weepy it was that good - and I understand that they too serve a Salted Caramel now - I have not tasted it yet - next time I am in Paris is will try it though and report back to you - until then BI-RITE IS CHAMPION!

We were eating down the street at Delfina. We had to park our car next to Bi-Rite and saw the line oustide. I was thinking to myself "who waits in line for ice cream?" I hadn't read about it here yet. Luckily, we bypassed dessert at Delfina and decided to see what the hype was all about. It delivered! I got a cone with cinnamon and mint chip. It was delicious and fresh - lots of great flavors on the menu. If I lived here, I would frequent this place often. It is the bomb.

I'm going to have to agree that Bi-Rite is pure awesome. The salted caramel is, of course, very good, but I'm partial to the roasted banana, which rivals the best gelato for pure depth of flavor, but maintains its delicious creaminess to be securely called ice cream. I haven't ever been the least bit disappointed by Bi-Rite and it's a favorite spot among visiting friends who want to experience a bit of what SF has to offer. If you appreciate ice cream, it won't matter whether it's a warm autumn afternoon or a chilly winter evening--you will rejoice in your selection after every delicious tongueful of Bi-Rite's trademark goodness.

The salted caramel and honey lavender here = good. Very good. It's the sort of ice cream you would gladly lap up even on a chilly rainy day. The salted caramel is sweet and salty and it leaves an absolutely divine burnt toffee taste on your tongue. It's addictive, and quite possibly the most interesting ice cream flavour my palate has ever known. I had my boyfriend get me a pint, and I shared it with him begrudgingly.

What can I say that's different than the thousands of other reviews here? Well tried their famous salted caramel. It wasn't as salty as we thought and just kinda tasted like cracker jacks. Good thing in a small, they give you two tiny scoops and you can pick a different flavor to balance out the strongness of the salted caramel. I chose the honey lavender. As my friend said, it tasted like a "spa." Hahaha, thought about it and it's so true. The lavender was definitely the overwhelming taste in that flavor so it tasted like how a spa would smell. Both were good and I had one light flavor and one strong flavor so I think they balanced each other nicely. It was also a pretty cold day for the bay so no line. Whoohoo! They had the ropes set up outside but no need, just walked in and ordered. I will have to cpome back in the summer though when strawberries are in season to try their strawberry balsamic. $3.50 for a small. And there's maybe like 5 tables inside. All in all, cool and different flavors.

Yeah, what he said and she said... 700+ reviews, here are my 2 cents which barely makes a difference or dent. Still hear me out! What were you doing on the fluke summer weekend in SF? I was in my cute short shorts and tank licking down my honey lavender ice cream on a cone. This scene reminds me of laid back Texas on a hot and steamy summer day, kickin' it with my innocent posse. Nowadays, I rarely eat much ice cream because I am usually full after 2 spoonfuls and because I have mild, late onset...you know...some of you understand what it is liked to robbed later-in-life of yummy dairy foods. But Bi-Rite creamery makes great organic ice cream, and my tummy responded a-ok. My olfactory glands were heightened by the lavender and honey flavored ice cream, which made me think I was eating my lavender scented sheets. I got used to it and fell in love with the flavor lick after lick. ÊNext time when I feel like reminiscing my childhood, I will definitely go for the roasted bananas, one of my friend's highly recommended flavors. The line may be long, but it goes pretty fast!

So, I've been dying to go here, after hearing so many good reviews from my friends. I finally went, and...it is definitely worth the hype. First of all, there was a super long line that went around the outside corner of the store. But, the wait was worth it! There are sooo many flavors to choose from, and it was pretty overwhelming trying to decide what to get. The workers are really friendly and let you "sample" the flavors, until you decide what you want. I decided on the salted caramel (YUM x100), and the white chocolate raspberry swirl, on a cone.

This is definitely the best ice cream I've ever had. No kidding. I'm a banana milkshake freak, but I usually don't like banana ice cream because it has that artificial bananay flavor that's just icky. But this banana ice cream was incredible. INCREDIBLE. Seriously very very good. I don't really do ice cream all that often - I'd rather have cookies or cake for dessert, but this stuff might make me change my mind. It was like a mush ball of bananas and frozen yumminess that made me wonder how long I could make it last. The chocolate was just as good, as were the flavors my boy picked out.

ÊThe texture of the ice cream leaves a weird chalky mouth feel that I found to be unpleasant, too. On the other hand, the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful and charming. But the long lines are unwarranted - if I want a long wait, I'll head down to Mitchell's instead.

The favorite ice cream here is salted caramel. ÊIt's very good.. So good in fact that NOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAND IN LINE for a small 4 oz portion.. Just go to directly to the counter, grab the small portion out of the freezer (to your right) and pay for it. ÊPresto, you're OUTTA THERE in less than 2 minutes! ÊThank you Bi-Rite!

This may be the best ice cream I've had in the bay. The salted caramel and roasted banana are quite delicious. ÊI also tried sam's sundae which has chocolate ice cream with olive oil.

Typical groggy San Francisco weather, I assumed we can be in and out of Bi-Rite in a couple of minutes, well what do you know there still was a line! However, it wasn't my first time here, and let me tell you it is worth the wait. What's not to like about this place? Everyone loves ice cream, and on top of that made from SCRATCH ice cream so you know it's going to be the business. What I always recommend is the salted carmel and the honey lavender. These are usually the two flavors you wouldn't be able to get at your local grocers, but they also do have the regulars like cookies and cream, mint chip, etc... and those also taste exceptional. If you get the three scoop deal it totals out to be around 6.50-7 so it is a relatively cheap place to go after a heavy burrito when you're around the mission district.

I finally got to see what the hype was all about and checked Bi-Rite out this weekend. ÊI can't say the ice cream is the best, but they had some interesting flavors. ÊI wanted so hard to love this place, but the ice creams were just okay. ÊI'm all for different flavors, but these didn't work too well for me. ÊThe location was my favorite part - it was in a fun chill area of SF up the street from Dolores Park, so I'd come here on any sunny day.

Was really impressed with the Olive Oil ice cream - rich and creamy with no weird after taste. ÊAs for the salted caramel, it wasn't as great as everyone hyped it. ÊI guess when you already make your own ice cream at home, a place like this just becomes another ice cream place. ÊNot so special.

I love ice cream, and Bi-Rite is some of THE best ice cream I've ever had! I tried the salted caramel, which was great, but I actually liked the brown sugar caramel better. I also had the balsamic strawberry, which was good, even though I'm not really into strawberry ice cream. I would definitely recommend this place, and I'm for sure coming back to try their other flavors. Btw, I like how there are a set amount of flavors so you're not TOO overwhelmed by the variety. I think they put a lot of thought into which flavors they make, and that's definitely a plus!

Bi-Rite Creamery is where the happy people gather. Nice sunny day out on 18th avenue; Once I took a bite into my creamiest salted caramel ice cream my taste bud was dancing. After the intense flavor of coffee toffee, the fresh taste of roasted banana was just so refreshing. So many selections of flavor, you can't help but order two or more scoops at once. Children, mothers, couples, and puppies, we all sit out by the cute little bench. This decadent ice cream is worth the wait.

Let me tell you my biggest obsession - the smell of lavender. and they made an ice cream of out of that! BRILLIANT! It wasn't overwhelming and was just soooooo good. The chai-spiced chocolate was also really good. I am going to go back there to buy some cookie dough, i bet that is top notch. Update: this place needs to be 5 stars.

Mecca, Tibet, Vatican City, Jerusalem, Salt Lake City.... all false religions, to the one true ice creamery. ÊMy fiancee picked it out, and we rode the BART to the 16th street station. ÊWe initially walked in the wrong direction, and getting the distinct impression that we were about to be mugged at any moment, I was thinking that Megan was about to lose her trip planning privileges for taking us to this neighborhood. ÊWe then straightened out where we were and past Valencia the neighborhood turned. ÊThen the clouds part and a ray of sunshine beamed down upon this humble little shop were scoops of divinity are dispensed to those seeking a momentary, out of body experience. The staff, or maybe ice cream prophet more properly, was excited that it was our first time, and insisted that we tasted almost all of the flavors. ÊMegan selected two scoops, one of coffee toffee, and another of salted carmel, I decided to follow suit, but then opted to up the ante with a three scoop, 2 of coffee toffee and one of chai with chocolate. We will be making this trek back..... are they still open....damn, I will have to wait until tomorrow. If they were to decide to mass distribute this stuff they could conquer the world, I'm sure of it.

I have a slight addiction to all things soft sweet and frozen (think frozen yogurt, sorbet, gelato, and of course on a splurge... ice cream). OK well it may be more of an addiction since on my last fro-yo "mission" a woman asked if I was pregnant due to how passionate I was in request for yogurt! No joke! Fat Ass Alert...Heck No! I just want my fro-yo lady! Anyways, I digress... last weekend the rise in temperature demanded frozen goodness, and I knew it was the perfect reason to FINALLY make it over to Bi-Rite creamery! Ê Due to the heat the salt caramel was a little too heavy (but that little taste was so good I'm sure I'll be back for a cone), so I ended up getting a scoop of strawberry and cookies and cream. My boyfriend was smart enough to get the roasted banana (sooo good!). Both were delicious, creamy, and so satisfying on a hot day. We then strolled our refreshed tushies over to Tartine.... yeah needless to say bikini season isn't quite here yet and I am so grateful!

Update: ÊBalsamic Strawberry (doesn't taste like a salad; balsamic brings out sweet-depth of berries) and Chocolate is my order. ÊSometimes, it's the simple things. ÊThere's a line out the door now like Tartine even at 830pm on a cold summer night... yah. FIRST, I REVIEW BI-RITE CREAMERY BROWNIE: ÊAt first, the BRCB seems like there's too much air in the bag... and taste like there's too much air in the brownie because the texture lacks the density and flavour of the DREAM brownie. ÊWhy? ÊThe BRCB was very... uh, American. Ê(Americaine?) ÊYup, Bi-rite cannot dethrone Tartine's creamy, dense, slighlty bitter, jammed with chocolate French femme fantasy brownie. ÊOh, no, no BRC, even though I love the neo-Americana-groove you bring to my hood and to your ice cream, your brownie is slightly too pedestrian/non-Euro for my tastes. Ê(HOWEVER, the next day I noticed that the BRCB tasted better, denser, chocolatey-er... so what's up with that?) ÊDoes is take a day for the BRCB flavours to meld? ÊNot the best, but worth the $5 for three-pack. Frozen-wise? ÊLove the malted vanilla, blood orange sorbet, mocha spiced chai and the brown butter pecan; chocolate is decent. ÊCannot deal with honey lavender (am I eating soap?), olive oil in my ice cream sundae and again, I'm not a salted caramel convert-- the ice cream or the trend. ÊAlso, cherry almond has issues like almond bits getting caught in the throat causing a mild gagging. Overall, BRC is a cute storefront with lots of tchotchkes and fun stuff to look at while you're waiting in line. ÊThey use real spoons for tasting and while their unique flavours aren't for everyone, weren't we getting tired of bubblegum and spumoni anyway? ÊLooks just like the ice cream shop I scooped at in the Midwest, and the counterpeople Êtake care of the 'hood with a smile... just like at Bi-rite down the street.

UPDATE 9/5! I've had a chance to return to Bi-Rite several times now. ÊI've tried the honey lavendar, milk chocolate chai spice, and the ginger. ÊAll the flavors are good! However! ÊI am taking away a star because of what seem to be consistency problems. ÊI've had the salted caramel four times, and it's been different each time. ÊSometimes stronger caramel flavor, sometimes weaker. ÊSometimes the ice cream is dense, sometimes it has more air incorprated. ÊIt hasn't actually been yucky or anything, but it has been substantially different. Ê ***Original review*** Okay, so I've only tried the Salted Caramel so far, but it was pure HEAVEN! ÊSmooth, creamy, rich, with complex flavors that stood up to the texture and sweetness. ÊGood mouth feel (and I mean that in the dirtiest possible way). ÊI want to work there.

I completely agree with Max B. on the statement of Andrew G. and the hatred. I mean, DAMN Andrew G., last time I checked, Bi Rite didn't have a Haterade flavor, so you know he didn't get that from them. :D I personally liked this place, and I think that I waited about 5 or 6 minutes in line for my cone, though I think that it was goood because of the fact that there was so many different flavors and I had to weigh my options heavily. The staff was super friendly with my friend and I. The guy that was scooper (can I call him Scooper?) talked with us and was super just mellow and nice. The girl behind the register was sweet and all up-beat. Oh, and for those that are dying to know what I picked...I went with the salted caramel...so good! And, because I'm just "me" like that, I got the salted caramel with caramel sauce on top. Overloaded with goodness in my mouth!!!

I'm sorry Mitchell's, but you really let me down when you stopped carrying Chicago Cheesecake ice cream. Yes, Bi-Rite is closer to where I live and carries lemon ice cream (Mitchell's doesn't). There are no numbers to take from the number machine so you just have to hop in line here and wait your turn. There are still long lines to wait in here at any hour of the day. Maybe more so during the day at Bi-Rite since it is so close to Dolores Park. One other downfall of Bi-Rite-your only parking options are street parking. Mitchell's has limited parking in the back. Don't let the line or parking discourage you. The ice cream alone is well worth the effort. The staff is always really friendly too. Not sure which flavor to try? Ask for a sample. There can NEVER be enough ice cream options in the city. Bi-Rite is an excellent option!!

I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream! I recently had some of their toasted banana coconut chocolate curry ice cream. It was delicious. The coconut flavor was slightly nuanced and not too strong. The banana flavor was the most pronounced as was the taste of the curry on the finish. The chocolate wasn't in the flavor but instead in little chunks so you were actually biting the chunks and tasting it that way and it made for a more interesting texture. Overall, it was great, it wasn't too sweet or creamy because sometimes ice cream gets cloyingly so and that's why I prefer it when it's cold outside rather than when it's hot. I usually prefer popsicles or Mexican-style shaved ice/sno-cones (raspados) then. It was a toss up between the Balsamic Strawberry and this. I guess I'll have to try that one next time. Also of note was the Honey Lavender ice cream which was delicious. It tasted perfectly like both. I like these fusion flavors because not only are they creative, but, it gets you to think outside the box in terms of flavor pairings. I would expect banana to go with coconut on a tropical theme and I would expect the taste of chocolate thrown in there but the curry was something else. I've also had chocolate with chili powder in it and that goes pretty well together (surprisingly) as is common in some Mexican dishes, like red mole sauce, for example which sometimes has ground peanuts and chocolate added to it richen and smooth out the taste spike of the chilies. All in all, I would say it was the most interesting ice cream I've ever tried other than Garlic ice cream at the Gilroy Garlic Festival a few summers back. That was just weird because essentially it was just vanilla ice cream with garlic flavoring. Weird.

What else can I really say that everyone else hasn't? They have excellent ice cream that works perfectly within the confines of traditional, but without being afraid to make a few small changes to make it truly unforgettable. So many places get lost in the urge to do something new and different that they forget that things often become classic for a reason. Yet just because everyone makes vanilla ice cream doesn't mean you should dismiss it as pedestrian and boring and demand that something be done to offer a new take on it. That's the dark side of food and down that road only lies pretension and flash-in-the-pan noveau cuisine that will be forgotten as soon as the next trend comes along. Well-made food is much like clothing where true classics are often simple not because they're boring, but because they have been refined through the ages. In this respect an excellent vanilla is like a white Oxford-cloth dress shirt: care, quality, and attention to detail all matter and serve to make the simple into the sublime. Salted caramel, malted vanilla, roasted coconut are all stand-outs, but due to the daily changes it pays to come back again and again to sample all that's on offer. Just remember, they're not doing it just to be different or because they believe it's trite and needs to be "updated" (a la "upscale comfort food", "modern American", or almost any sort of fusion), but because they're just trying to do it well. I almost never manage to come to the Mission and not get a cone at Bi-Rite.

This place doesn't really need another review attesting to it's wonderful-ness so I'll keep it short and sweet. There are so many enticing and delicious flavors to choose from (I almost always have a panic attack trying to decide) but I have to say their salted caramel is by far my favorite. For a "single" scoop on a cone, you can get two flavors so it's really more like a double, so it's worth the price. It's worth it to make a trip out to the Mission just for this ice cream. Coupled with a sunny day and Dolores Park, Bi-Rite Creamery is perfection.

Love this ice cream - some of the best I've ever had, if I say so myself. (Lactose intolerance be damned!) It's total Nectar of the Gods - you know, if the Gods were alive today and all. I don't really get the salted caramel hype - I can eat one or two bites before it starts to taste metallicky, which really sucks, because I truly want to like it. Instead, I'll stick with the balsamic strawberry - yummy and not too sweet, the balsamic vinegar tempers it perfectly; the brown butter pecan - so good, with a hint of sweet from the butter; and the chocolate - because, sometimes, I tend to be an ice cream purist and want something familiar and simple.

Don't even bother reading the other reviews. In fact, don't waste any more of your time considering Bi-Rite as an ice cream option. Is it decent ice cream? Yeah, sure.

Perhaps I'm only adding my agreeing voice to over a thousand others, but they're all correct. This is the best ice cream I've ever tasted. We walked in. It was impossible to choose. Each looked better than the next. We tasted, and tasted, and tasted, and tasted, and each tasted better than the next. I'm not sure I've ever paid so much for so little ice cream, and believe me, I would gladly pay twice as much. I'm almost glad I live 40 miles away, otherwise I would blow all of my money eating myself silly on ice cream. It's so good, not only is it worth stopping in, it's worth a special trip for ice cream. No, scratch that, it's worth a freaking intercontinental vacation EVEN IF YOU LIVE IN LIKE SRI FREAKING LANKA to come here for the ice cream.

I'll be fair and judge the place for what it should be judged on, its ice cream. I think it's pretty damn well done. There are no issues of taste here, it's all great and the variety is there, so there's some flavor for all types. My only gripe was that I really don't like the wait too much. Yes, I understand you have to wait for good food, but I'm not even sure this ice cream is worth the tremendous wait you have to endure most times. Then again, you can always skip the line, grab the pint from the fridge, and eat that there. Not scooped right in front of you yes, but tastes just as good.

I had heard about this place through one of the culinary magazines that finds its way to our house on a monthly basis. ÊHere's how it goes -- I read an article about the best ice cream shops in the U.S., and the one mentioned in S.F. is *not* Mitchell's. ÊCuriosity piqued. Ê We try on a Friday night after dinner in the Mission. ÊHaha...no. ÊNo way, no how - not gonna find parking. ÊNot to mention, there's a line around the corner of the building. Second try, this time a Sunday afternoon. ÊStill little chance of finding parking, and there's still a line around the building. Ê"Hmmm...this place must be very good." ÊOne helpful technique we found was to have the folks in the backseat of the car go wait in line while we found parking. ÊSure enough, by the time we made it back to Bi-Rite, our friends were next-in-line for ordering. ÊScore! Everyone in our group ordered doubles. ÊThere was mint chip, chocolate coconut, chocolate, strawberry balsamic, roasted banana, and toasted coconut. ÊI think everyone came away from the experience satisfied and having enjoyed their ice cream very much. Ê So, why only 3 stars? ÊIt just wasn't THAT good. ÊConsider it 3.5 stars, but instead of rounding up, I'm rounding down. ÊIf I lived in the neighborhood, this could easily be the regular spot to visit. ÊIs it worth driving all the way from San Jose just for a scoop? ÊNot so much. ÊIf I happen to be in the area and have a craving for ice cream, is it THEN worth it? ÊMaybe. ÊIt depends on the parking situation... ÊI'll circle the block a couple times, but I'm not going to go out of my way (and risk getting a ticket for more "creative" parking techniques) just for a scoop.

Wowaweewa. I was sitting at home watching the food network and someone said that the Sam's Sundae was to die for here. And thus began our journey to get in line and get us some of that delish ice cream!! We drove by here around 8 and the line was long, so we decided to do some shopping at the early sale at Nordies and return some stuff at Urban and decided to return. Line was still long, BUT we got parking right smack in the front so it wasn't bad at all. Waiting in line isn't that bad, especially not bad for this kind of ice cream. =) MMM.... I ended up getting the Sam's Sundae which is two scoops of chocolate ice cream, with olive oil, sea salt, and whip cream. SO GROOD. My BF got the malted vanilla and balsamic strawberry. The strawberry is to die for! So good! =) We got a pint to go. They also have a punch card! Go. Here. Now.

Bon Appetit named Bi-Rite Creamery and Bakeshop as one of the top 10 ice cream shops in the U.S.A. So, naturally, I had to go and check it out. The ice cream was fresh and cheap, but I think they could improve their flavor palette. Plus, I was surprised that they didn't offer toppings Cold Stone style. I still think Cold Stone has better ice cream, but out of support for local ma-n-pa places, I highly recommend Bi-Rite Creamery to those who live in or will visit San Francisco.

Wait, what? No review from me yet? I LOVE BI-RITE. Yes it's a small shop, yes parking sucks (but where in SF doesn't it), Êyes seating is limited but the ice cream! Oh, the ice cream! Salted caramel is my ultimate favorite. It's not easy to perfect the balance between salty and sweet and Bi-rite does it right. At other places it's either too salty or too sweet. Next in line is lavender honey and then brown sugar. SO FREAKING GOOD. So smooth and so creamy. I also love that they use all local and organic ingredients. I wish there was a Bi-Rite closer to home.

Tried this on our trip up to San Francisco, I'm sure for some people, mostly those who inhabit the city, this place is worthwhile and it would be for me if I lived anywhere near here, but I don't. The ice cream seemed ordinary and it was just ok, nothing too great. I will confess I'm not a big ice cream person so that already was a bias for me BUT I must say that the taste of Salted Caramel was pretty unique as was my friends Toasted Coconut. Maybe I needed to try something else, or maybe I need to try all the flavors, but I would never ever ever ever say I NEED to visit this place on my trips to SF... but you should try just to give it a chance your opinion really is the one that matters at the end of the day.

You first come here and see the flavors options. ÊVinegar strawberry, honey lavender, chai spiced tea chocolate. ÊYou'd think they just randomly toss in stuff into their test kitchen and went let's try this and that, but hey, it worked! Only issue for me is getting here, it's away from the freeway and clustered in the horrible area where it's extremely hard to park and the wait is somewhat long.

So tasty, and I love how you can just walk up to a window on the street, get your soft serve or cupcakes, and roll out.

It can't be any better than this! This is absolutely THE BEST ice cream I have ever tried! ÊIt's light and airy, yet creamy and oh so yummy!

Anyway, I can't wait until friends from out of town come to visit so I can share the delishiousness of Bi-Rite Ice Cream... There is a line if you want to try samples and get a cone - otherwise, head over to the Bi-Rite market across the street and get a pint.

On a cloudy, cold summer night in the Mission District of San Francisco, a line wrapped around a corner block like a snake, though it moved like a snail. When I approached the tail, I knew its head had to creeping into Bi-Rite; I had heard the raves about Bi-Rite Creamery, and had long searched it out prior to my short visit to the City. ÊThe wind swept through the streets, but no one paid it heed. I was constantly moving back and forth to warm up my limbs because it is 95 degrees in Alabama in the summer; but not here. These people love their ice cream, even in 55 degree summer evenings. I had debated on going to the infamous Humphry Slocombe instead, but after seeing the line and the dedicated following that Bi-Rite led, I knew I had made the right choice. ÊFinally, after 45 minutes, I enter the shop. It is a cardboard box only much more decorated. The place was tiny. Thus, the long line. Knowing I would not be able to return again any time soon and after braving the interminable line, I had to opt for the largest bowl, which allowed three to four scoops. I knew that the Salted Caramel was voted their best ice cream, if not best in the city, so I knew I had to try it. For my other three scoops I chose Roasted Banana, Malted Vanilla with peanut brittle, and Brown Butter Pecan. ÊThe Salted Caramel was astounding. I was blown away. It was rich, creamy, sweet, salty, smokey, savory. It hit all the taste buds. The smoke came from them using a dry caramel base, which means they literally burn the caramel. They use high quality sea salt, and it shows. The salty taste over balances the sweetness, which is rare to taste in modern ice creams; most are too sweet. ÊThe Roasted Banana was little more than banana ice cream. I tasted very little caramelization or roasted flavor. But as a banana ice cream it was extra creamy and sweet. ÊThe Malted Vanilla was a great base to add peanut brittle to. Instead of a boring sweet cream base, it had a hint of malt flavor which was a perfect, subtle canvas for the sweet and salty peanut brittle. There was not nearly enough brittle in the ice cream. A crunch factor in ice cream is paramount, and I only had two brittle pieces. ÊThe Brown Butter Pecan was an amped up, fancier version of butter pecan. They just burnt the butter, which gave it a smokey, caramelized taste. The pecans melted in my mouth right along with the ice cream. ÊI wasn't even mad about the line; I was impressed. But the thing that bothered me was their generosity. I know it is a big city, and they have to serve as many people as they can, but the sizes of the scoops would have barely feed dwarves. It wasn't even funny; a bad joke. The generosity of a business speaks louder than the product at times, and though it did not take away from their awesome flavors, it did leave me in want. I have been to shops in NYC that gave scoops twice the size of the ones here, and for the same price. ÊThat aside, Bi-Rite does ice cream right. Some of the best in the country without a doubt.

I had the salted caramel ice cream in a junior/kid size cup. I love when salty and sweet are combined.... I don't think, however, this was that great. I think it was more salty than it was sweet. It was also pretty expensive. Again, I'm comparing to Ici at Berkeley. Ici is way better.

It says something when two irrational girls drive an hour to get to the City, take another 15 minutes to find parking, get their ice cream, then go home, without doing anything else in SF. And, when my guy friend and I missed our bus to get ice cream, then decided "ah, screw it" to miss the next one, so we can go back in and get another scoop (yes, we were incredibly late) It.is.that.good. I always make a pitstop when I'm in the city (with or without car). -Salted caramel: I swear, I hear trumpets and Hendel's "Messiah" or something. The saltiness adds a wonderful balance. -Balsamic Strawberry: I hate salad dressing, this does not taste like salad dressing, AT ALL. -Coffee Toffee: I see the coffee grinds, and the toffee chunks are wonderful. I always get this and Salted Caramel. -Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle: Peanut Brittle, omgggggg -Honey Lavender: actually, not so excited about this one. I forgot which sorbets my mom tried, but those were good too. COOKIES, also good. I still must try their soft serve...

Came here after a meeting with a counselor at USF. ÊI needed a pick me up so ice cream was the answer! Samples: -brown sugar with ginger-I'm not a fan of ginger, but I actually enjoyed it a lot. -Coffee Toffee-MMMmm Mmmm GOOD -Roasted banana-not too much banana and it was just right. -Salty caramel-salty, sweet, richness from the caramel. ÊIt was awesome. I was holding up the line so I finally decided on the honey lavender and the balsamic strawberry. I usually shy away from lavender, but couldn't say no the the honey :) I was worried that the lavender would overpower the honey, but it didn't. ÊIt balanced out really well where my ice cream didn't taste that much like soap. ÊI can taste the honey on it's own so that saved it. ÊThe balsamic strawberry was a lot better. ÊIt was creamy, but I can still taste each ingredient on it's own. ÊEverything was very well balanced. Ê After ice cream, I couldn't resist but order a lemon icing cupcake and a fresh mint chocolate cupcake. ÊI wasn't too fond of the lemon cupcake because it was too dense, but the icing was AWESOME! Êthe fresh mint chocolate cupcake was ooohhhh so GOOD! ÊI can taste the freshness of the mint, the cake was moist and had hidden chunks of chocolate in the icing and the cake! ÊIt was like a reward with every bite. I enjoyed my yummy treats right outside on the wooden benches on a slightly chilly day, but enjoyed the ice cream anyways. ÊI also laughed when this dog attempted to walk his owner into Bi-Rite and wouldn't budge when the owner tried to pull him away.

I came here upon a recommendation from a friend since I've already tried Polly Ann's and Mitchell's. There was a line but it wasn't too bad. They move efficiently which I like. It's kind of a hidden place on a side street but you can always tell where it is by the line. I ended up getting the honey lavender and the creme fraiche that day. Both were very good. The creme fraiche wasn't overly sweet and had sort of a cream cheese taste too it which was unique but not too strong. The honey lavender was my favorite. It had that hint of lavender but was sweet overall. I can see why this place gets good reviews and can agree with most of the Yelpers here. The people were friendly and patient as they waited for you to decide what you wanted. I can't give this place 5 stars because my ice cream melted really fast. My friend's was immediately dripping off his cone but he was eating it as fast as he could which made him unable to enjoy it as much. Also, the flavors are good and unique but nothing out of the ordinary to me. If they were closer together, I would pick Ici (in Berkeley) over Bi-Rite. Still, not a bad place for new flavors and quality service.

Best freaking ice cream I have ever had in my entire life--and no I'm not being dramatic. I really do think this is the best ice cream I've ever had. This is better than Mitchell's and WAY better than that piece of crap tasting Humphrey Slocombe or however you spell it. Who actually likes Humphrey?! Bleck. If you want great flavor, come here! I always get the salted caramel (what they're known for) and the roasted banana. I've tried others--but those are the two flavors that are the best in my opinion. The best thing about it is that everything tastes exactly as it's written. The staff is great--so accommodating and always patient. Love this place!

The best ice cream in San Francisco. The staff is helpful and friendly. The samples are generous. The sample of the hot cholocate was very good. Also the cookies are some of the best in SF and only 75 cents each. Only four stars because like any ice cream shop there are good flavors and flavors that are only ok. The ginger ice cream is five star all the way. There is a nice blood orange flavor too. I thought the salted carmel was ok but I didn't love it like the ginger which is worth a trip.

If Ice Cream was a country and every flavor from every ice cream place was a person living in that country, Salted Caramel from Bi-Rite would be that country's Supreme Dictator and Living God. Other ice creams would walk for days, shoeless, over dirt roads and through snowy mountain passes just to spend a fleeting moment in his presence. He would be the world's most powerful dessert, beloved by his subjects and allies, hated and feared by his enemies. He would make the leaders of Cake, Cookies, Pie and Chocolate bend to his irresistable will. He would travel in a diamond-encrusted helicopter.

I had heard alot about this place, supposedly comparable to Mitchells. The ice cream was good... not overbearingly sweet and good consistency. There were probably about 15 different varieties to choose from (1/2 of them classics, the other 1/2 more unique) In the end, I got the butternut pecan which is odd because I love to try different flavors. None of those options appealed to me that night (Lavendar...?) Long lines, but it moves fast & the service is friendly and quick. This is ice-cream afterall. I might be more adventurous next time & maybe it'll convince me to up my rating. My companions DID rave about the sugar cones - so i'll be sure to check that out as well.

San Fran is not a dessert-kinda-town. This is especially true when it comes to ice cream. You can do Mitchell's, which when compared to the Êoption of Baskin Robbins, Swensen's or Polly Ann's, is relatively fair. One can, if willing, make the trek 'across the bridge and through the hood' to Fenton's for more decent creamage. On the other hand, whom strives for just the OK? Why not partake of the really good? Try Bi-Rite Creamer and baked goodies. Each flavor tastes completely different. That's why they are called different flavors. A basic concept, often lost on the aforementioned ice cream purveyors. The Salted Caramel...a creamy concoction of fresh caramel with a hint of salt. The coffee...has "coffee' in it. The vanilla, with real vanilla bean. Get the picture? Go now.

Okay, so still think the flavor and quality of the ice cream is still dyn-o-mite! But, the portions are getting tres wimpy. We noticed this a few visits back, but recently it has gotten out of control! We decided to go with the double scoop (2-3 flavors), but sadly, the scoop sizes of 2 scoops does not even compare to the 1 scoop of the good old days. My 3 scoops today did not even fill the bowl. Just 3 sad little golf balls hanging out in a vast bio-degradable bagasse bowl. ÊFor almost $5 for 3 scoops, just feel a bit short changed. I do think it depends on who is scooping, but come on, the big yummy scoops (versus the corporate mandated scoops) were part of the charm. But, alas, it seems to have changed.

I heart Bi-Rite. I've been coming here since they opened a few years back and everytime I go back to SF I make sure to stop by. My favorites are Roasted Banana and Toasted Coconut, but honestly all of them are unique and taste so good. The people behind the counters are always pleasant and give you tastings by the spoonful. Go and taste them all and good luck choosing.

I need Bi-Rite in Seattle, please. My friend took me there a few hours before I left SF back to Seattle. I don't know how to thank her for taking me there. I knew I liked their ice cream last time, and yup, I liked it even more this time. This is how Salted Caramel should be made (I wish Molly Moon's could learn from Bi-Rite.....salted caramel doesn't have to be salt ice cream). I also had a scoop of Coconut ice cream, and wow was it good! The service is efficient and friendly. Amount of ice cream is just right.

Now this is some great ice cream! I'm a Double Scoop (Three Flavors) kind of guy. Salted Caramel is absolutely the best, followed closely by the Strawberry-Balsamic. The Cinnamon with Snickerdoodle is delicious and gets even better if you combine it with a bit of the Ginger ice cream. Really though . . . its the Salted Caramel that brings me back time and time again! Its thoroughly craveable. Mexican Chocolate with Peanuts, Honey Lavender, Creme Fraiche, Brown Butter Pecan, Toasted Coconut, Almond Cherry . . . You are sure to find a flavor that's right for you. The staff is friendly, and graciously offers samples. They have fresh fruit sorbet when in season (plum has been my favorite so far) and walking across the street to Dolores Park (weather permitting) is a perfect way to immerse yourself in both the city and the decadence of Bi-Rite. The Bi-Rite market (across the street and one block down ) also sells some pints and ice cream cookie sandwiches, although I found that the sugar cookies on the Strawberry-Balsamic overwhelmed the ice cream. Stick to the creamery for ice cream, but definitely don't miss the market if you find that you can't live on ice cream alone?!?

So one day I perused the Mission on my bike, it was hot, it was summer, it was ice cream time. I looked to the right side of 18th street, right by Dolores Park. Holy smokes! There was about 50 people waiting in line for Bi-Rite. I figure that's got to be the shiznit ice cream right there. I came back another night more recently to avail of no lines, and hit up three scoops of ice cream. The salted caramel that's really popular.. was really good, salty, sweet, creamy, buttery, velvety, smooth.. It was pretty tasty, the chocolate and the cookies and cream were really good too. It's not really pricey either, so for a pit stop at the Dolores Park.. I think Bi-Rite is a great place. Everyone loves ice cream, and if you don't then you're a sadistic person who probably hates animals. Nuff said' - go try it. Buy a pint and if you've recently broken up with someone, this place will mend your heart a little and make you loosen up your belt a little too.

I really like this place.. I've only recently had it but I think it's great. Some of the flavors are not yummy to me though (sorry).. I don't like Honey Lavender- tastes like a spa that I would go to and that would be lathered with a lotion with that scent/taste. And I love chai lattes.. but the Chai Spiced Milk Chocolate was just okay for me... not to bag on the company but I do love the Malted Vanilla, Salted Caramel, and Strawberry Balsamic flavors... recently I tried one that was (Ginger, Caramel, Vanilla, Brown Sugar?) That was amazing.... :) all in all, I would recommend this place if you're looking for unique flavors and a lovely staff. Very Friendly!

Salted caramel = amazing. Coffee toffee = equally amazing. The servers behind the counter are super nice and funny, and always let you sample. The only downside is having to avoid the temptation of buying a pint of ice cream and devouring it (by yourself, in your bathrobe, standing in front of the freezer) at home when no one is looking.

The best ice cream I have ever had - for serious. When I first tasted Bi-Rite's ice cream, I was amazed. I was dazzled. I never expected that mere humans could take something as tasty as ice cream and make it better. It's like giving David Bowie the power to fly. Bi-Rite is well worth the wait on hot summer days. It is also well worth the mad dash for an $8 pint in a rainstorm. The friendly staff lets you try as much ice cream as you want, and you will want to with all the flavors they have up for grabs. The only bad thing I can say about Bi-Rite Creamery is that one time I waited in a crazy long line to get ice cream, and then when I got outside I took a lick of the top scoop of my cone and knocked it to the ground. While my friends and I pondered whether or not the five-minute-rule applies to ice cream, the frosty dome turned into a sugary, gravelly soup. So sad. My favorites to date include balsamic strawberry, salted caramel and creme fraiche.

At first glance you would think that the flavors are a little over the edge. But oh was it good. I wish i could have more. I went on Friday at around 1:00pm. Only 1 person in front of me, but I was ready to wait. Usually when I pass this place I'm on the UCSF shuttle coming from SFGH. I had never heard of this place and all of a sudden I see a long line out the door. I was getting so jealous of all those people that I had to try it for myself. I got a recommendation to get salty caramel. then someone told me it was too salty. (depends on your taste buds) read some reviews and people raved about the salty caramel. I got the SALTY CARAMEL AND ROASTED BANANA. I WANT MORE! the Salty Caramel was not too salty for my tastes. And the Roasted Banana was not roasty or too banana. the prices range from $3.25 to i think $8 depending on what you get. They have sundaes, combos with brownie, and they even make their own chocolate. next trip i'm getting coffee toffee and something else. go try it for yourself.

I am not a huge fan of ice cream but on a nice sunny day walking in the mission this is the place to be! We had salted caramel and coconut and one other...and they were all REALLY GOOD.

I'm a major tart frozen yogurt fan, but even then, I can appreciate the goodness and creaminess of Bi-Rite. However, it's just not for me. I tried the salted caramel, which tasted great, but was too sweet; the cherry almond, too sweet and didn't taste like much; brown butter pecan, too sweet; balsamic strawberry, pretty good. All the flavors were spot on, but they were just overly sweet for someone used to tart fro yo. HOWEVER, ice cream lovers will love this place. Great flavors, creamy ice cream. All my friends love it.

Do not be discouraged by the long line. The wait is amazingly worth it. OK get ready. Malted Vanilla w/peanut brittle pieces, Balsamic Strawberry, Salted Caramel, Creme Fraiche, Honey Lavender, Brown Butter Pecan and so on and so forth plus toppings galore and not to mention the variety of ice cream sandwiches and Popsicles. I'm not going to over analyze the taste of ice cream flavors because I'm lazy and ice cream is good period, HOWEVER the ice cream here is special. Special how?

Normally, when there's something in the Mission, I'm on it. But when Bi-Rite opened, I was busy and my butt was bigger than usual. Plus, living at 26th St biases me to the south Mission and Mitchell's. How can you get better than buko flavored ice cream? Mexican chocolate? Then I traveled around the world for a year and when people I met heard I was from San Francisco, the first thing that many of them asked was "Oh, isn't that where that ice cream place is that has the salt caramel flavor. Like, oh my god. You're so lucky to live there." Just two days after landing back in San Francisco, I had my first saltysweet taste of Bi-Rite's caramel flavor. It was a little melted from under freezing, but since I gobbled it down, that wasn't much of a problem. Other flavors like balsamic strawberry and honey lavender were worth returning for too. Though the salt caramel may always beat them back when I order.

Love ice cream but if given the choice of any place for some leet ice cream I would opt for Bi-Rite Creamy. Amazing quality here and sharp clean flavors. Take a moment be it sunny or cloudy and visit this place and if there is a line it is more then worth the wait. My favorites, Their Ice Cream Sandwiches, something about yummy Coffee Ice Cream between two Chocolate Chip Cookies. Cakes for parties like the Brown Butter Pecan. And of course their scoops such as Roasted Banana. Get your treats and enjoy a moment outside or at the park a few steps away or just people watch and guess what everyone else is going to order.

Salted Caramel kid size with hot fudge sauce, $3.00. DANG, that's pricey! Never would've tried this flavor but a friend said it could not be missed. I am not an ice cream fan, more of a salt tooth gal, but it was mighty good. I only went bc it was the first time that I ever saw the place without an enormous line, Wed night around 5-6pm, in case you want to try. There is a good assortment of flavors, but not a lot in the sorbet or dairy free zones. They do offer tastes without hesitation though, and that gets props. Also, they use organic Strauss creamery dairy, so don't worry about unnecessary antibiotics, but don't forget where veal comes from. As this is the highest number of reviews I have ever seen on YELP, you know that you have to try it. Don't bother reading any more, get on over there.

Bi-Rite Creamery is a little gem near Dolores Park. ÊParking is limited (but if you come on a Sunday - one of the lanes on Dolores Street is closed off for parking, church I suppose). ÊSince I went relatively early, around 2:30, the line was short. ÊI felt like I didn't have enough time to decide. Ê I got a scoop of the Toasted Coconut and Ricanelas (cinnamon Êwith snickerdoodles) in a cone and it was SO DELICIOUS! ÊI'm a sucker for gourmet/homemade desserts! ÊHowever, I do think that Bi-Rite leans towards people with a sweeter tooth.

Had to try Bi-Rite after so much hype from local friends and yelp! I thought it was quite good. ÊThe reason I rated it only 3 stars is that they use Straus Creamery products to make their ice cream, but the Straus Creamery ice cream you can buy at the grocery is still better! Ê Even so, this place sells organic ice cream, has a multitude of unique flavors to choose from and seems to do it the old fashioned way. ÊThat's the way it should be! P.S. The day we went it was hot as balls, so waiting in a long freaking line that day, SUCKED...

On with my search for a good gelato joint, I was drawn to Bi-Rite by the constant lines and word of mouth. I was mildly disappointed. The consistency slightly too frozen, the texture slightly dry and a dark chocolate flavor slightly "un-rich" and "un-dark". Not enough for all the hype. A-Ok.

I craved it the next day so I drove across town just so I can get a pint of Ricanela ($7.95) and guess what? I took one bite and my whole family finished it off before I could get another bite of goodness. So a few days later, my friend's birthday rolls around, and I volunteer to order a cake from Bi-rite..YES..the exact same Ricanela+banana ice cream and gingerbread cake and let me tell you 5 small asian girls can swipe down a 12 inch- no problemo!

A definite gem! With non-traditional flavors like lavender and salted caramel and earl grey... its definitely out of my comfort zone for my comfort snack. I find myself having cravings for these unique flavors. Mine personally is the ginger ice cream... I am a BIG ginger fan but this ginger flavor isn't overpowering. What else is a must try is the sundaes... yum-um! Oh... and did I mention its organic for all you organic fans out there. As for the store itself, the place is a bit small, but quaint, cute and reminds of a 50's mom and pop ice cream shop. A definite must-try in the city!

I've been here more than a couple of times and I have friends who really love it here, but, honestly, I really can't get too into it. The location is great, right on 18th and Dolores street. Great place to be right after a super sunny day (rare in SF) in Dolores Park. The ice cream is really good, but honestly, I don't find anything special about it. I guess that's because in Mexico the ice creams are extremely, extremely, extremely varied and ALL organic and natural. I even find Mitchel's, Bombay Ice Cream and Belgano's more exciting than this place. The flavors here, I feel, try too hard to be different and aren't flavorful enough, nor do they have a nice consistency. The staff's nice, super energetic and cheery. I will continue to come here often, as long as there isn't a mile long line of awed and thirsty Noe/Mission dwellers.

Salted-caramel ice cream at Bi-Rite Creamery is DA BOMB! Why didnt they invent this when I was a kid?!?!? $2.95 for a kid's size (but actually pretty big). $1 more each size larger. Well worth it. I have had this multiple times, but needed to do this again for the 7x7 challenge. Sometimes its too salty, but this time just right. Kicks off pretty strong with salty taste then sweet caramel sinks into your tongue and hits your sweet tooth. We also got the Pineapple-Raspberry Popsicle for $1.95 - great combo.

With that in mind, I will just say that the cinnamon ice cream with the snickerdoodle cookie pieces is the most amazing ice cream flavor ever!

Oh.My.DELICIOUS!!!! I had just finished up dinner over at Pizzeria Delfina with a couple of friends and we decided to polish our dinner off with ice-cream over at Bi-Rite. There was a line out the door but it gave us time to look at what we might want! After about 5 minutes of testing 10 different flavors, I settled on a mixture of honey lavendar and the salted caramel with macadamia nuts on top. The ice cream is so creamy and insanely rich! Somehow they managed to infuse the flavors without them being weird or over-powering and believe it or not - the combination of HL and SC were unbelievable. They have about 20 flavors for you to try and also have a variety of other offerings around the store ranging from cookies to macarons but everyone was clearly there for the ice-cream. There is also a fun menu of different sundaes and combinations up on the chalk board above the counter - which I totally plan on trying next time. The prices are obviously a little higher than your average ice-cream but nothing absurd. Our walk home with Bi-Rite's ice-cream was heaven!!! Even on a cold night - it was totally worth freezing our butts off even more with the ice cream! P.S. I got a pint of salted caramel to bring home and plan on ordering an ice cream cake for my best friend's birthday from here.

The salted caramel ice cream and roasted banana are true winners! Every time I go to Bi-Rite these are the two flavors I get. Yeah, yeah I know...I need to try the other flavors. But these were the first two flavors I tried and I've been hooked every since. Most definitely if you like sundaes -- theirs are worth trying. I personally just like ice cream the old fashion way - on a cone. No muss and no fuss. Bi-Rite definitely knows how to make ice cream! Hmmm...starting to crave some right now.

Definitely over hyped and I would not go out of my way to come to this ice cream place.

ÊWe got there around 10:45pm and the line was still out the door. ÊCrazy! This place must be good! Maybe I was too full from dinner and the ice cream was good but NOT to die for. I had a taste of the honey lavender and I thought it was too fragrant and reminded me of hand cream. ÊTried my friend's Earl Grey and it was yummy! Definitely a flavor I would get next time. ÊOther friend got Salted Caramel and it was just ok. ÊInteresting but didn't knock my socks off. ÊI went with my safe bet - mint chip and it was good. ÊCreamy. Sweet. Comparable to Mitchels? I think so. At least the line at Bi-Rite actually moves! I can't believe I waited an hour at Mitchels to eat ice cream. ÊONE HOUR! I think if i lived near the Mission and didn't own a car I would frequent Bi-Rite. ÊThe ice cream is definitely better than Dreyers/Ben & Jerry's or Baskin Robbins.

POMEGRANATE POPSICLE STICKS. I'm a sorbet gurf, not really into the creamy ice cream. but I did enjoy their salted caramel and their roasted coconut that my mum had. I'm not a coconut fan but this kicks the spot. I hate waiting in long lines cause it's always a line ride here I've never been pass this spot without having to hang out and ride the line ride. But once you get in it's nice and cool on a warm summers day with refreshing ice cream to go with. They have gift cards which is an extreme plus, cause I know gift cards it makes me feel like I'm not spending any money at all!

Came here with the Boy both yesterday and today (we had heard about this place from a SF pal, who raved that it was unbelievably delicious -- she was right!) and the line was really long, but we didn't mind because the weather was great, the people in line interesting to talk to (we filled out voter registration forms for SF while in line), and the prize -- delicious, fresh, interesting, smooth, ice cream -- well worth the wait. Yesterday, he got the Berry Sundae and I a scoop of Salted Caramel and a scoop of Roasted Banana. I loved the caramel flavor -- everything I was hoping and more. The Roasted Banana was remarkable in how banana-y it tasted, but got kind of boring after a few bites. The Boy's Berry Sundae was so great -- chewy gingersnap chunks, fresh (thick) whipped cream, blueberry sauce with tiny, tart blueberries, and thick vanilla ice cream. So so good. Today we split a Sam's Sundae (chocolate ice cream, bergamot and olive oils, and sea salt) and all I can say is that everything is better with olive oil and sea salt. I also tasted the Honey Lavender flavor and he the Mint Chocolate Chip and we can't wait to come back to have cones of those flavors. Go there! Go there now! If you're reading this review while in line, I hope this review builds your anticipation to a fever pitch, because BOY ARE YOU ARE IN FOR SUCH A TREAT.

ÊYou should at least order the double size that allows 2-3 flavors. ÊThe single size just doesn't cut it for me. SALTED CARAMEL, EARL GREY, and the Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces flavors were AMAZING with every spoonful. ÊI wasn't too crazy about the balsamic strawberry since it tasted like any other strawberry ice cream. ÊIf you only like lavendar in your soaps and lotions, I wouldn't try the honey lavendar ice cream. ÊI just couldn't get passed the taste like I was eating soap.

Finally bit the bullet and drove over after dinner to check out the rave reviews of the salted caramel. I thought the salted caramel was very good, but not as great as the hype says it is. More memorable was the honey lavender and the earl gray flavors. I came at about 8:30 in the evening, so the line was short. What's great is that after getting ice cream I was able to walk over to Bi-Rite market and sample their cheese. I ended up leaving with a bar of chocolate bacon. Go figure.

I love ice cream & I know my ice cream, I'll travel far and wide for the milk based goodness. Heck I can eat it for breakfast, lunch, dinner, AND midnight snack! With that said, Bi-Rite blows ice cream out of the park. I urge you to come and indulge. Le Sigh... Bi-Rite makes my heart beat a little faster. ps. please try their salted caramel cupcakes. oh boy. deeelish!

The best ice cream of my life! Riconela + Honey Lavendar is an amazing combination. Even separately they're mind-blowing flavors. You can get a sample of whatever you'd like. Also take note that they have special flavors on different days. (I was disappointed when I saw they had mexican chocolate ice cream only on tuesdays). It's a regular stop on my San Fran trips now :)

I've driven by here so many times and every time there's always a line, even when it was freezing. Êok, I'm exaggerating but it was definitely cold and people still lined up for ice cream. Ênobody in their right mind would be eating ice cream in the cold. Êbut then again, there were plenty and that definitely means something. my first bi-rite experience was during a KFT event I worked. Êthe lady purchased two ice cream cakes for her son's bday. Êshe gave us a slice of the coffee toffee ice cream cake and a slice of malted vanilla ice cream cake. Êboth were really good. for my second experience I actually lined up. Êthe line went down to the corner. Êit wasn't too bad, about a 5-10 min wait. Êthere were some very interesting flavors I wanted to try. ÊI ended up ordering the cherry almond. Êthey did not disappoint. ÊI actually wanted more but didn't want to overindulge. bi-rite deserves nothing less than five stars. Êthe service was great and the ice cream is just heavenly. Ênow I understand why people would stand in line in the cold freezing their butts off for ice cream. Êtheir ice cream is so good that I'll actually wait in the freezing cold freezing my butt off.

It's Friday and as the fog is begining to roll in over Dolores Park, I have the realization that I MUST have ice cream before leaving SF!! How is it that not even chilly temperatures will keep people away from Bi Rite??!! I must have skipped from the shop all the way to BART, savoring every single spoonful of my salted caramel and honey lavender scoops..... Heavenly; that is the only way to describe the flavors. A marriage of really good ingredients and amazing flavors (oh god, I am drooling all over my keyboard thinking about it....). I thought of buying a pint, then imagined myself eating it on the way home on BART, guess I'll have to simply trek out to the city every now and then for this amazing treat!!

Perhaps it's a coincidence that both ice cream spots that I luh-luh-luv have the word "rite" in the title--Bi-Rite? Rite-Aid? Not to compare them on the same level, but both do ice cream rite (right). Yes, I'm THAT girl who is more inclined to order orange-cardamom and honey-lavender and earl-grey flavors on a cone. But I can get down with their snickerdoodle, too! I just think there's something for everyone here. Just make sure to enjoy it across the street while sitting on the Dolores Park lawn with some good company. You'll love it so much that if it falls off your cone and lands on the same grass that Lord knows what else has been, you'll make sure to dust it right off and try again. Best ice cream I've had in a long time.

Holy moly, why has it taken me so long to try this place? ÊThe gf said she wanted to try Bi-Rite for a while and since we were in the city we thought we swing by. ÊHowever before hand we already had ice cream in Vacaville, Sushi in Japantown, Foie gras at the Chez Spencer on the go Food Truck, and so I thought she wanted to pass but she remembered. ÊWe drove by and she said she will call me to tell me of the flavors (I had already said I wanted Earl Grey) but there may be additional flavors. ÊWhile I was circling around I never got the call. ÊI came back around and she was ready to go with two pints of ice cream. ÊWhere was the call? ÊWhat's going on? ÊI thought I had a say in what ice cream I get to buy (next time she'll circle around). ÊShe said she had tried both flavors and they were too good so she just picked those two. ÊWhat are the flavors? ÊHoney Lavender and Earl Grey. ÊWe ate some when we got home and daaaammmmn, it was good. ÊReally puts the ice cream I had earlier in the day to shame. ÊThe honey lavender has a great fragrant smell of pure lavender. ÊThe earl grey ice cream is just perfect as the flavor isn't too over bearing or strong. ÊThe only thing I didn't like was it's $7.99 for a pint but you know what, since the ice cream is so good, I'm willing to overlook this price point. ÊI guess you don't have to ask whether I'll come back or not. On another note, I added a crushed salted caramel macaron with the ice cream, let's just say that is my new dessert of choice! ÊI better go play some basketball or else I'm going to get fat.

after mitchell's we went straight to bi-rite. i like bi-rite but not as much as i like mitchell's. bi-rite is good and the ice cream is rich & creamy. I wasn't too big on the honey lavender flavor, it was too floral - tasted like i was eating a soap, in my opinion. Which also shows that it has a very strong flavor Ê- so for those who likes lavender, you may want to order a scoop. the salted caramel was interesting and i like it. But i really like their coffee toffee. my goodness it was bursting w/ coffee flavor! it was really good.

They have vegan ice cream! I'm not vegan but I'm lactose intolerant! For those of you who don't understand what that means - if I have any kind of milk product I've got about 4.5minutes to find a bathroom before I mess my pants and yes I've tried the lactose pills and all that other stuff and all it does is buy me about 3 more minutes of bathroom hunting time. So for a place as awesome as Bi-Rite to serve vegan friendly ice cream is fricken awesome! Especially when it's Chocolate Coconut Ice Cream!

Oh Bi-Rite, I wish I could have you every day for dessert if not for the long line in the cold SF weather. Anyways, I've tried coffee toffee, earl grey, honey lavender, and another daily selection that I forgot the name of. I keep hearing/reading that the salted caramel is amazing, maybe I'll try that one day, although I do really like my go-to combo of coffee toffee and earl grey.

what more needs to be said? but i cannot contain my personal joy, so i will still add to the glowing reviews. salted caramel - just do it, dammit. roasted banana - i'm not a usually a big fan of banana, but i love the flavor that shines through in this one. malted vanilla (with some bits and pieces of almonds or something-something in it, can't remember) - basic, but pretty good. has that obvious malty taste, which i really do appreciate. honey lavender - light and fragrant, i enjoyed this. love having this in a mix of 3-4 flavors, because it makes the segue in taste really apparent. balsamic strawberry - was really looking forward to this one, but unfortunately when i had it, it tasted like straight up strawberry. fresh and tasty, nonetheless, but was expecting more of the balsamic body and kick to it. eager to try out the other flavors, but i won't complain either if i just stuck to these five all the way through. the line can be long, but it moves quickly. get a cup/cone and head over to dolores park in these sunny days. one of the simple, brilliant pleasures in life.

What can I say about a place with over 4000 reviews that hasn't been said already? I came around 11:30am so there was no line. I had their famous salted caramel ice cream and the balsamic strawberry ice cream as well. The former definitely lived up to its reputation. As for the latter, I could not taste the balsamic vinegar at all. Just tasted like regular strawberry to me. The price is quite good for such a well-known place. $3.25 for two scoops and they accept credit cards. The customer service is quite good. I was offered many samples and given many recommendations when I told the worker that it was my first time there.

Salted caramel is my all-time favorite.

I'm not really sure, maybe I just haven't been here during the day time. Haha. Anyways, there is always a line for ice cream... luckily when my friend and I were passing by, we managed to just walk in and get ice cream.

I'm usually wary of places that claim to be "the best" so I didn't have the highest of expectations coming here. Well, it turns out that I had no reason to worry because Bi-Rite lived up to its name after all. Although the flavors themselves were very interesting and unique, what I rated for was the richness of the ice cream. I could definitely tell that their quality of ice cream was much higher than that of generic store bought ice cream, or even ice cream chains including Coldstone. That said, Bi-Rite doesn't have the creativity or selection that Coldstone has, but its definitely delicious in a different way.

Anyone that serves Eggnog with Brandy ice cream is my new best friends and guess what?! Bi-Rite Creamery is my new best friend!!! My boyfriend had heard about this creamery on television, most likely on the Travel Channel, and has wanted to come here for a long time. So I decided to treat him to some ice cream one saturday, so we hoped on BART and then walked the rest of the way to the Creamery. For $5 you could get a 2-3 flavor 3 scoop bowl, a great deal for fresh ice cream. I got 2 scoops of chocolate and 1 scoop of eggnog with brandy, glad I only got 1 scoop since it's rich. My boyfriend got 1 scoop chocolate, 1 scoop vanilla and 1 scoop salted caramel, seriously he always picks great dishes whenever we go out and I really wanted to trade him! It was the perfect combination!! The seating is small inside, maybe 6 people total could fit, but why would you want to sit inside when you could walk across the street to the park and sit in the sunshine?! I'd love to return to this place, hopefully something in my future places me near Bi-Rite.

Bi-Rite ice cream could be creamier--it is a bit powdery-- but the flavors are excellent. I thought that I was going to love the salted caramel, as I adore salty/sweet flavor combinations, and was surprised to find that I didn't care for it. ÊIt lacked sweetness and was somewhat bitter. ÊAlso, the sea salt sprinkled on Sam's Sundae (see below) provided a much more appreciable salty kick than that in the salted caramel. ÊI would have enjoyed the salted caramel more if it had a sweet caramel swirl in it plus sea salt. I liked the honey lavender ice cream a lot-- very fresh tasting and redolent of lavender. ÊIt is unique and a real treat for anyone who loves lavender-- like me! My favorite was the ricanelas-- cinnamon ice cream with cinnamon sugar cookies (a.k.a. snickerdoodles.) ÊWhy is there not more sweet cinnamon ice cream in the world? ÊIt is fabulous. I also sampled Sam's Sundae-- chocolate ice cream with bergamot olive oil (bergamot is a type of citrus), sea salt, and fresh whipped cream. ÊAside from the chocolate ice cream being a little powdery in texture, the sundae was very good. ÊLightly salted chocolate is fantastic! The line was out the door on a Saturday night but moved pretty quickly. I look forward to sampling more flavors, and in the meantime highly recommend the honey lavender and the ricanelas.

Dear Bi-Rite, WHY MUST YOU BE SO FAR FROM ME?!?! I am a HUGE fan of soft serve ice cream, and recently popped in for the salted caramel version Bi-Rite was serving up... freaking delicious! I've seriously contemplated just hopping across the bridge at random hours just to go get another cone with some of their soft serve.

I love this place because they are very creative and inventive with their flavors... it not just vanilla and chocolate. If you are down to try new things .. this is the place! I had the salted caramel, roasted banana, and honey lavender. My favorite was the salted caramel because it has this sweet, salty, savory, distinct test to it that really makes your mouth orgasm. The texture is very smooth and leaves you craving the next bite. ÊThe roasted banana has a very strong banana taste to it, thought it was also good, I do not prefer it over the salted caramel. My least favorite of the three was the honey lavender. I love the smell of lavender, the color, and the flowers -but in your mouth- not so much.

This town needs more ice cream parlors--supporting happy, hormone- and antibiotic-free cows, of course. P.S. Someone just wrote me asking why I rated this business if I've never been there. I think it's fine for me or anybody else to point out that the line has been too long to go here. See what Jenny K. says, for instance. If Yelp let me leave no rating, I'd do that. Meow, hiss. Ê;)

Being that i just polished off a pint of the creamery's Butter Pecan ice cream I figured I should review it. Now I know that everyone LOVES the creamery, but i have to give this flavor only an eh. In fact to be honest the only way i was able to finish it ( 'cause at 8 bucks a pint it wasn't going into the garbage) was to crush up some strange candy bar I recently bought in Copenhagen and Êthen mix it in to the ice cream followed by a drizzling of Recchiuti Bitter-Sweet Chocolate Sauce (1000 stars for that stuff by the way). So why the four stars - their Ritual Coffee and Roasted Banana flavors ROCK my world. The Malted Vanilla with Chocolate Covered Rice Krispy treats is also pretty tasty though slim on the 'treats.' Plus this place is literally just across the park from me and when it is hot I am too lazy to walk very far.

The first time I visited Bi-rite Creamery, I wasn't impressed. ÊThe ice cream had an annoying icy quality, and the flavors tasted like the base was made with evaporated milk. Months later, I've gone back and it is among one of the best ice cream shops in the city. ÊA little sliver of a place located in the Delfina corridor in the Mission, it's cute and simple crammed with an array of sweet treats, ranging from chocolate sauces and confections from local boy Michael Recchutti, to various cookbooks, notecards and company t-shirts made from organic cotton. The ice cream, rich, creamy and flavorful. ÊThe Roasted banana is made from fresh bananas roasted with brown sugar, the honey lavender is light and fragrant with hints of bergamont. ÊThe salted caramel, the signature flavor is a combination that could have gone south with a quickness, but the balance of burnt caramel edged with salt (which I presume is sea salt) makes this quite possibly one of the best ice cream flavors ever created. The service is good, although the servicers could smile a bit more. ÊThey do believe in sampling, which always a good thing. ÊAll in all, Bi-Rite is one more excellent ice cream shop for us foodie types to indulge ourselves. ÊHopefully more people will support these boutique-type businesses; anything to help run the chain operations the hell out of town!

I love ice cream. I'm lactose intolerant. However, since I looove ice cream, I defy my intolerance regularly and suffer many consequences and usually it's worth it. And the first time I tried the ice cream here, it was worth it, though a little soft. ÊBut the next time it was even softer, and the third time I was annoyed. Licking as quickly as possible, I still couldn't eat it fast enough to avoid the melting mess my dessert was becoming. I've bought pints, cones, and cups but now I'm giving up. I can't keep up. My ice cream must have more substance- I would like to chew it softly, please.

Mark G.'s War Journal: 7/25/07 I'm starting to smell a conspiracy going on in the Mission. First, I discovered Mitchell's when I moved here a few years back. Then, it was the Bombay Ice Creamery. Now, Bi-Rite seems to have joined the dark side by opening their own ice cream shop. Who could be behind this? It's possibly someone close. Someone who knows that I have a sweet tooth. Someone who knows I shouldn't be eating these sort of things. Someone who knows that I cannot fight temptation when it comes to ice cream. And, the Bi-Rite Creamery knows how to make their ice-cream. Damn them. Who could be behind this? Professor Celsius? Doctor Kelvin? The Iced Wonder? Or perhaps it is that nefarious Frederick von Fahrenheit? I must investigate. I should start at the docks. Perhaps its seedy denizens could shed some light on the evil mastermind. But, first, I must stop by Bi-Rite Creamery for a little dessert.

So after eating Tartine's Jambon and some of my boyfriends pastrami sandwich that he couldn't finish, we thought that it would be a good idea to get something to cool off in the out of nowhere hot weather...So off we go to The Bi-Rite Creamery and their popular as hell long line. I'll say this first, I don't eat ice cream much because I am lactose intolerant to heavy amounts of dairy...cheese on the burgers I eat = nothing. Ice Cream at the creamery = A world of pain brought on by the deliciousness of the ice creams that they serve. I knew I would go with a classic cookies and cream, but I felt I should make the experience special and try out the Salted Caramel which was bliss on a cone....even thinking this, I still opted for the C&C....it pleases me...what can I say. I don't know if they rotate flavors but their selection is what demoted this 5 star with 5 big red ones review down to a 4 star review. I see no real reason to avoid coming here on a hot day....i'll be back when the real summer comes in September.

This place makes ice cream the way it should be made... The flavors are eclectic, yet tasteful and playful all at the same time. Like baking, the process of creating ice cream is all about the magic that happens once you put the ingredients together... Every time I walk by this joint it is always hop-hop-in. Before I even knew the pleasures of this great little oasis. My girlfriend kept hinting to me that we 'need' to go here. We should go to the creamery... Hey it is sort of luke-warm out, we should go check out the creamery... It sure is cold and windy..maybe we could go down to that little place by the park and get some ice cream...oh yeah the BI-RITE CREAMERY!!!!!!!!! FINALLY, I pulled my head out of my leftover southern California mental-haze... AND... we checked out the creamery a week or so go after hanging at the park. It could not have been a more perfect day to roll the flavor dice at the creamery... Man!? Ê Holy COW...Sacred walking lactose filled savings account and future retirement fund.......If I had only known how may cool flavors they had to choose from......all the time I have wasted.....I could have been full force into sampling everything that comes out of this sweet joint!? Luckily for you and the salvation and sustainability of this entire planet..... This little joint, is by no means a f-in 31 flavors....AND dismount!

This place rocks. ÊThe salted caramel has been beautifully haunting my dreams since we first met. ÊBalsamic strawberry, cookies and cream, and roasted banana are all worth checking out. ÊSkip the chocolate peanut butter (I may have just tasted it on a bad night). For those of you who complain about the prices, there's a giant sign right above the counter that (SHOCKER!) lists the prices. ÊIf you're going to get your nose out of joint because of how much it costs, then DON'T EAT HERE. ÊMore for me! Mitchell's is good, Bi-Rite is better. ÊBrave the lines and shell out the $3 for a small cup with 2 flavors. ÊJust make sure that one of them is salted caramel.

I used to be a loyal customer to Maggie Mudds--- but Bi-Rite won me over! One, it's in a super convient location, just a half block away from Dolores Park- nothing more fun (in the summer at least) to get ice cream and hang out in the park with friends. Bi-Rite Creamery makes all their ice cream in small batches using local and organic ingredients. It is obvious how much care and thought the staff puts into their product-- with a variety of unique flavors such as salted caramel, honey lavander and Basalmic Strawberry flavor- but they also have traditional favorites like Cookies and Cream and Chocolate too. The flavors rotate, but they are pretty consistent too. High quality ingredients with craftsmaker care! They also have a nice selection of pre-made cookies and cakes and pint sized ice creams to go- which works out really nice if you want to bring something sweet to a dinner party. The astethic of the place is nice too- simple, and small they have a few benches outside for sitting, as well as a couple of bar stools inside for eating too. The ice cream display is simple and they sample with metal spoons- which I really enjoy. Oh, and their to go containers (paper cups and wooden spoons) are 100% compostable!

Ê Well, I think the Bi-Rite Creamery has matched some of my favorites!! ÊNot only do they give Soup Spoon sized sample tastes, the flavors are amazing!! Ê All organic ingredients for those concerned about that with dessert foods. ÊFlavors like Honey Lavender, some Snickerdoodle flavor that's too good for it's own good, and Roasted Banana ---- rest assured, you won't be let down.

It really don't get no bettah in this city. Seriously. I love Ice Cream. ÊAnd by love, I mean love. ÊIn a sick way. ÊLike, if I was walking down the street and an old man in front of me was eating an ice cream cone...and had a heart attack....and keeled over --- well I'd give him mouth-to-mouth simply to be able to lick the cookies n cream from the insides of his mouth. Yeah. ÊIts like that. So Bi-Rite is sort of a little piece of heaven in my world. ÊIt is kitty-corner to my weekend haunt (Dolores Park), only a few blocks away from the homestead (Castro Street), and has some of the most yum-o-rific flavors I've had the pleasure of licking off a spoon. Ê Scoops are pretty generous. ÊAnd the staff is also real nice about taste tests, which is helpful since a lot of the flavors will be new. ÊSome favorites include Malted Vanilla, Salted Caramel, Peanut Butter Fudge Swirl, Honey Lavender, Double Ginger ...mmm - I could go on & on. Ê The Brownie Sundae (2 scoops of ice cream - any flavor, a nice big chocolate brownie, whipped cream & spiced pecans) is a standby when I am feeling piggy. ÊThere are some delicious ice cream sandwiches (more reminescent of it's-it's than your standard ice cream sammitch). ÊThey also have an odd sundae - with sea salt and bergemot olive oil. ÊIt's a trip. ÊNot bad at all ,and worth a try at least once to try something off the beaten path. ÊI've also tried the standard Banana Split, which comes with caramelized bananas (which they fire up right in front of you) as a sort of twist on the ol' standard. Anyway, the lines get a bit long (even on a Tuesday night, there's a line!), but it truly is well worth the wait. Ê Basically, this little gem is priceless.

Walking back from the yarn store ... my endless obsession ... there is nothing better than a scoop of chocolate ice cream on a hot day. I pretty much always order chocolate, although perhaps I should have been more adventurous, as Bi-Rite has some pretty fantasical-looking flavors! Salted peanut indeed! Anyway, being a stickler for chocolate allows me to compare this standard of ice cream flavors, and I must say that the Bi-Rite chocolate stands up well to the other varieties around the city. It's nice and dark, with a wonderful, legitimate graininess. It doesn't taste over processed, and on a day like this, it simply melt ... in your mouth, and if you're on careful, on your clothes. The cones are also quite excellent. Crisp and thin, but substantial enough to hold their own and be refreshing against the richness of the ice cream. And I didn't try this, but you can get multiple flavors on a Êsingle cone! It's the closest idea I've seen to gelato since, well, gelato! Except it's most definitely ice cream and doesn't pretend to be anything but that. Definitely head here. Lines go quickly and the reward is as tasty as they come.

Please people...this place was just alright. Here are the reasons why its just alright: - long lines out the door! Bi-rite needs to somehow get the line going faster...crowd control or something. Its the least they could do for people who have to wait upwards to 20 minutes to even get in the door. I can't imagine how it is on a super hot day in SF (good thing its hardly ever!). - its a little overpriced. I felt a little ripped off when I got the single for $3.25 which only had two very small scoops. I guess its a good place if you are watching your weight. Bi-rite would get 10 plus stars (if that ever becomes possible) if they were a little more generous with their portions. -no sitting room. They had only a few barstools inside. Good thing there's Delores park nearby. -Parking. Don't even bother about driving there. Get prepared to walk a bit or get dropped off. Ok, there are good things about Bi-rite! I like Bi-rite despite all those things I just mentioned above because: -Location! Honestly, I come to the City only a few times a year and this place proves to be on a good block. Like I said, next to Delores Park and easy to spot from the main street (maybe cuz there's a long line of people out the door). -Ice cream is pretty great! Smooth and interesting flavors- I especially liked the lavender one. -Patient staff. Maybe so patient that's why there's a line out the door. This review just made me realize that I'm just impatient when it comes to getting my ice cream. I need to chill and spend those minutes in line anticipating some good ice cream coming my way...

Seriously. as good as it gets. my friend took me to mitchell's a month ago, and we waited 45 minutes for me to try a fairly mediocre to decent ube ice cream. i mentioned bi-rite to him, and he told me always passed it on his bike but never got a chance to try it. we showed up at 1030 on a saturday night, waited for maybe 10-15 minutes, and got to sample all the flavors we wanted to try despite the semi long line that was behind us. i settled on the salted caramel and my friend the roasted banana on two cones. i'm not the biggest fan of ice cream and am much more of a fan of sorbet and fruity flavors, but the salted caramel was AMAZING. it was the best ice cream i have ever had in my entire life. i'm normally turned off by caramel for fear it might be too sweet, but this was amazing. it wasn't too sweet and completely flavorful. the only thing that wasn't so desirable was the hole in the bottom of my cone. i tried a bite of the roasted banana and it was also incredible! i was blown away. i've had fantasies of the salted caramel since trying it. if you're ever in the city, you must go. it is definitely worth the minimal wait!

For some reason, the constant crowd actually makes this place better. There is always a line and the inside is pretty small. The ice cream is so good that most people just stand around outside eating on the sidewalk. The overall experience is very intimate. It kind of reminds me of lunch during high school. Even if you aren't talking to these people, they are still right by you and you have a lot in common...like a nice cup of salted caramel ice cream.

I've never gone here when there's a line and I never get the salted caramel, and I don't like unique flavors in general for ice cream.

ÊI also like their cookies that they sell. If you want to take it to the next level, go for the ice cream sandwiches...or better yet, buy a bag of cookies, a pint of ice cream and engorge. ÊMy experience is a little skewed because I've only experienced good parking situations, no lines and really sunny afternoons. ÊIt's far from it, but as close to Diddiy Riese as it'll get for SF. If it's a sunny day (like today) and there's parking because people are at work, head on over to Bi-rite and grab yourself an ice-cream sandwich (I like the Snickerdoodle cookies with Cinnamon ice cream). ÊNothing feels better than walking around, eating an ice-cream sandwich and people watching on a great weekday afternoon.

Yum ice creamo. On a nice Friday night, the line wasn't particularly long. It reached the end of the block but I've heard of it wrapping around before. So from the window of the women's boutique shop, it should take around 15-20 minutes to get in your order. Of course if the people in front of you are sampling every other flavor, it's gonna take longer. I went with the strawberry sorbet which tasted very good. Refreshing and not too sweet. And for my second scoop, I got the salted caramel which tasted a tad like coffee and a tad like toffee. Overall, a very interesting and good flavor. The prices are great and they even have packaged ice cream in the fridge for quick pick'ens.

Friendly service; this small place serves up a few scoops of delectable ice cream/sorbet in the dairy or non-dairy fashion (I'll choose the latter). I felt welcome here which was nice in a small crowded place on a saturday night, and oh did the veg chocolate coconut, pomegranate, and banana orange pineapple combo w/ waffle cone that I got taste good! Hit the spot! Mmm! I can see why it's heavily reviewed- for good reason; especially right by dolores park where the hills and sun are just waiting for you to come sit in it with it. I'm with it. Sorbet, that is. Props to bi-rite peoples here. Another bi-rite review - try-rite.

Stumbled across this place randomly once with "CBG." We were craving ice cream one random Sunday and looked this place up on yelp. It had great reviews so decided it was worth trying. The flavor selection is plentiful, with lots of options. They also have a wide variety of toppings and sauces, I got chocolate and cookies & cream with the fugde topping, absolutely delicious. It was so nice, creamy, and just the perfect amount of sweetness. They even take plastic, which is unusual for a little ice cream place in the city. Only complaints and recommendations: Ê - No waffle cones, just sugar cones, a little bit of a surprise. - Just one chocolate flavor, would like to see a lot more variety in chocolate. And this place is cheap, $7 for two people, much cheaper than most ice cream places, and so much better. Two thumbs up for this place. Parking is a pain in the mission, so be prepared to look.

wow. this place is the best! Even with the line wrapping around the street corner, it's ok! well worth the wait. I can seriously come here on a daily basis! I always get the double scoops, but I might start doing TRIPLE scoops! So far, I tried balsamic strawberry, brown sugar with toffee and caramel swirl, coffee toffee, and toasted coconut. I also try a bit of the honey lavender from my bf, and it tastes good but a bit weird. Especially since my lotion scent is lavender. Right when I took the first sample of it, I felt like I was eating my lotion. ÊThe salted caramel, name sounds weird, but it taste really good!! Every flavor I tried, I love. I also got a pint of coffee toffee to bring home, but my boyfriend is fighting over it with me, SO I will need to buy more to bring home. If it was a bit cheaper, I think I will definitely buy each flavor to bring home because i am THAT crazy over bi-rite!

Yes, people. ÊIt is all that it's cracked up to be. I'm not sure I have anything to say that hasn't already been said. ÊMy favorite flavors are the roasted banana, strawberry balsamic, the one that has Ritual coffee in it, and of course, the salted caramel. Ê It don't get no more San Francisco than Bi-Rite. UPDATED: ÊThe Bi-Rite Soft Serve is minimalistic and it's fantastic. ÊI've had the malted vanilla, chocolate, and the salted caramel and by far my favorite is the malted vanilla/chocolate swirl. ÊSo simple. And for those who complain that it's $3.50: ÊThat's the same price as the ice cream and you NEVER have to wait in line for soft-serve. ÊI always laugh at the suckers who stand shivering in that line as I walk by with my cone. ÊTrust me, you'll be just as satisfied.

At 1668 reviews, this spot really is as good as it gets.

My boyfriend and I just recently discovered this little gem. We were a bit skeptical at first, considering their strange flavors, but they got such good reviews on Yelp that we had to try for ourselves. Everyone is right. It is always packed. The lines are always long. The parking is terrible. BUT worth all the trouble. Their flavors are ingenious! Very creamy and tasty. My bf had the salted caramel, which I believed to be a little too salty/rich, but I'm not much of a caramel fan to begin with, so I feel a little biased. I got the roasted banana... It was AMAZING. The service/staff is great. Super friendly, waiting for questions or to give you samples. Bi-Rite should be on every one's "To-Do" Êlist. It is most definitely worth all the trouble. We're definitely coming again.

I'm still amazed by this place. We were in SF dropping off my sister and decided to stop here. First off, the line was around the corner (again) of the block...not kidding. But these people are so efficient that we were at the front in less than 10 minutes. And the ice cream? I will truly never get tired of the flavors. I tried the Brown Butter Pecan. It was heavenly.

I think they best thing about this place is the interesting flavors. Maybe that is why people are so ga ga over this place. Don't get me wrong, it is good, but it isn't THAT amazing. I've had the malted chocolotate something or other.... eh... not impressed. Salted Caramel.... not something I can eat a whole scoop of. Leaves me really thirsty. Balsalmic Strawberry.. probably my favorite so far. But again, nothing orgasmic. coffee toffee... not bad. Bold flavor, but again, left me really thirsty. I probably wouldn't have been back so many times if my room mate didn't want it so much! So again, i see why people like it so much but I'm just not huge fan. Gave an extra star for the creative mixtures and friendly staff.

Bi-Rite Creamery is a definitely a "must" anytime I go to or drive by the Mission district in SF. Every time I come to Bi-Rite, I get the famous Salted Caramel Ice Cream and the Cinnamon Snickerdoodle ice cream. I haven't even dared to try anything else. The best thing about Bi-Rite is you can get a single cup of ice cream and split the scoop amongst 2 flavors. Thursday night, I half-way stepped outside my comfort zone and tried something different, the Roasted Banana ice cream and of course, the Salted Caramel. What a great combination! It tasted almost like eating a banana's foster. K got the Salted Caramel and the Brown Sugar ice cream. Both delicious as well. The ice cream is rather cheap at Bi-Rite, $3.25 for a single scoop. If ya'll haven't tried it, I suggest you get your butt down there now. You will be addicted!

Alright. Soooo tried this place for the first time today and it was great! From what I hear try the ice creams because your taste may be different. Personally, I was NOT a fan of the salted caramel despite the hype. It was ok, but there was better. In one day I visited this place twice because it was that good (and my friend lives a block away) I had the malted vanilla with peanut brittle, roasted banana, and cinnamon with snickerdoodle pieces. ALL WERE TO DIE FOR! This is authenic real as it gets ice cream and it's really great. It's like 2.25 for a 1 flavor kids scoop, 3.25 for a 2-3 flavor single scoop, and so on. I hear it gets super crowded and the lines go around the block! but it wasn't too bad when I went around 2pm (the first time) and 8pm (the second time) but keep in mind this is a cold Wednesday. MMM, I want some more!

First of all, I'm a sucker for places that let me taste the ice cream. I'm super indecisive, especially if I've never been there. I was all set to try the salted caramel, thanks to the intrepid reviews on Yelp, but then I tasted ginger and my mind was set. It's smooth, creamy, and just the right touch of ginger. Not too overpowering. The staff was friendly and patient, and for some tasty ice cream the price was pretty good. Way better than the Ben and Jerry's I had later that day. (Don't judge me, it was free ice cream day.)

Came here after having brunch at Boogaloos and wandering around and about in the Mission yesterday. When we got there, there was a massive line in front of Bi-Rite all the way up to the intersection. I've never seen such a line for ice cream before! But after having Bi-Rite ice cream, I now know why. I decided to get a single cone with salted caramel and malted vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate pieces (jeez, that was a mouthful, lol). Note to self: stick with a cup. I didn't realize how fast the ice cream would melt right after I got it! The ice cream melted so fast that it almost fell off my cone D: Usually, I wouldn't go as far as to try and save my ice cream, but I somehow caught the ice cream and plopped it back onto my cone :x Nevertheless, it was the most delicious ice cream I've had thus far, and that's saying a lot even with the ice cream dripping all over my fingers. Both flavors tasted heavenly, no joke. Earl Grey was pretty tasty as well; I think I might have to get that next time I go there alongside the soft serve. Extremely amazing ice cream plus excellent customer service (the person that helped me was super cute :D) is a win for me.

I know our babies will get very far just like the quart of salted caramel ice cream I had in my freezer for 2 months and still tasted amazing. Even though it'll cost quite a bit to raise all our awesomely flavored kids, it'll be worth every penny. All your friendly servers can attend our wedding and baby showers.

There's a reason why there's a line every time I come here. It's because the flavors are unique and delicious. ÊSome of these flavors are definitely flavors I would have never thought to be served as ice cream before. Some of my favorites that fulfill my sweet tooth: Salted Caramel- I didn't like this the first time I had it, but the second time I enjoyed it more, now I love it and I almost always want it. Roasted banana- Reminds me fried bananas with coconut ice cream. I love it! Early Grey- not too sweet. Who would have thought to make this into an ice cream flavor. It's not strong like the actual tea. But its very refreshing. Ricanelas (Cinnamon and snickerdoodle)- Another great flavor to get Pumpkin (seasonal)- get it while you can. It's popular and delicious. I love anything pumpkin flavored. I love coming here, but I hate waiting in the long lines. It's worth it though

ÊWith a gracious drizzle of hot fudge? ÊI'm becoming more and more convinced that the best nights end with ice cream. ÊA little sweetness sure hits the spot. ÊEvery time. We waited in line for about 10 minutes, during which I ran into a former co-worker! ÊI think seeing someone I knew enhanced the experience, making it feel like the corner ice cream place where friends reconnect. I can't comment on the quality of Bi-Rite versus other local ice cream places, but the excellent selection of flavors and service with a smile scored high enough to warrant enthusiastic endorsement.

There is literally nothing you can contribute to a place which has received over 2,000 reviews. However, one tip: Make sure you are a fan of the specific flavor you are choosing. The flavors are VERY strong - I tasted honey lavender yesterday and it was very lavender-y. My second choice the coffee toffee had an extremely strong coffee flavor, which reminded me more on cold espresso due to the bitterness than coffee. I surely enjoyed my flavors to the fullest, but really make sure you love the flavor you going for.

I am an ice cream freak and this place is A+!!!!! ÊGot there, no lines, staff super friendly. ÊI got a cup of the salted caramel and it was everything I dreamed it would be. ÊCreamy, smooth...and the saltyness just brings out the caramel flavor even more....amazing. Ê I would like to come back and try "Sam's Sundae", that's next on the list!

Finally tried Bi-rite yesterday night! We had tried to get some of this infamous icecream the Friday night before but the line was out the door and around the corner so we had to take a raincheck. Now ÊI understand what the wait is for! I had the balsamic strawberry and cookies and cream, and my boyfriend had the salted caramel and malted vanilla with peanut butter brittle pieces. All four flavors were amazing but my favorite was the balsamic strawberry- the strawberry flavor was true to the fruit itself, which is so nice since sometimes strawberry flavored icecream butchers the real strawberry taste with too much sugar. This strawberry icecream was really natural and not too sweet. And for those who are worried about the combination of balsamic vinegar and strawberries, I assure you, you will not taste the balsamic. The salted caramel lived up to its reputation. The flavor was really interesting and complex- sweet and subtly salty. Definitely Êtry this place for great icecream! Expect a wait but the line does move quickly.

Salted Caramel ice cream! Need I say more? But if that's not your flavor, they have a lot more. And just like other ice cream parlors, you can try them out before to help you decide. I ordered the salted caramel ice cream and the roasted banana. Together, it was delicious! I'm Filipino, so having this combo reminded me of a "turon" (friend banana in a lumpia wrapper). The workers here were very friendly. The girl who helped me was very nice and patient as I tried to figure out which flavors I wanted and as I kept asking for samples. So definitely a plus for their great customer service :)

OMG. This is THE place for ice cream on a nice San Francisco day (or even if it's chilly)! Flavors that I've tried so far and can't wait until I try some more: Salty Caramel Roasted Banana Lavender Honey Ê Earl Grey Ricanelas Toasted Coconut Tried Food Network's featured: Sam's Sundae with Chocolate ice cream with bergamot olive oil, maldon sea salt and whipped cream. I thought it was OK. Would of tasted better if they sprinkled more sea salt. Tips: Go on a weekday before 3pm. Normally the line is SUPER LONG (especially weekends). So I find it safe going around 1pm or so and it's perfect.

I was told constantly by people of how great this place is... and surprisingly those people were right. I went there for the first time a few days ago.

ÊI know i'm a bit spoiled after years of eating Eiger Ice Cream down south, so i was so excited to hear that there was a possibility of something just as good here in SF after Eiger closed.... To start with the positives (+) flavors are creative and inventive (+) taste is good but not great (we had the salted caramel, seasonal flaovor (cinnamon), chocolate and cherry almond) (+) service is friendly Disappointment (-) Texture of the ice cream was not great, ice cream for me is about flavor AND texture (icy chunks, not as smooth and creamy as i'd expect) (-)the crazy lines (-) cherry almond was bland, chocolate was too icy and not creamy

It was a sunny and warm day, and we happened to be in the area. We walked over from Dolores park, when we go there, there was a line. It wasn't too long. When I got inside, it smelled so GOOD. The customer service was really good. The lady who took my order was so nice and funny. I decided to get two flavors- roasted banana and salted caramel. OHMYGOD. It was like ice-cream heaven. IT WAS FANTASTIC. I also tried the flavors, honey lavender and balsamic strawberry . The honey lavender has this incredibly, unique taste. The strawberry one was just okay. On the other hand, it did taste really fresh! I can't wait to go back!

The ice cream here is spun fresh daily. ÊI was able to have the Balsamic Strawberry and Roasted Banana. ÊThe Roasted Banana was my absolute favorite as I love anything banana flavored. Ê I also got to try Salted Caramel and Brown Butter Pecan. ÊThe Brown Butter Pecan was another great flavor that was extremely delicious.

I'll keep it short since this place has plenty of reviews - ÊI think the ice cream is very good but I have had better in Scottsdale, AZ. I had the salted caramel (very good), creme fraiche (very good) and brown butter pecan (not that great). The reason I believe Sweet Republic in Scottsdale is superior is because the texture of the ice cream is better and they have homemade waffle cones. I thought the prices and service were good, better than I expected. After I got the ice cream I was walking towards the Bi Rite market to check that out when I passed the "soft serve" window with a bunch of cupcakes in the window. I bought a salted caramel cupcake which was out of this world! It survived a day in my laptop bag and still tasted delicious.

Salted Caramel is as amazing as everyone says! It reminds me of Filipino leche flan...sweet, creamy caramel with a tinge of burnt/smokeyness mmmm Also tried... Coffee Toffee - Almost as good as Hagen-Dazs Toasted Coconut - ÊYummy but the coconut pieces could have been less chunky and more shave-y Honey Lavender - This was good but not my favorite. The lavender was strong in this batch...kinda tasted like soap =X Also, the line was long but moved at a good pace -- long enough for me to decide what flavors to try and fast enough to get that creamy goodness in my tummy!

Okay. ÊI am ashamed to say that even though I'm born and raised in the SCO it took me until recently to finally get my butt over to this place. ÊIt's almost that effect where I know I COULD go whenever I wanted so there wasn't really much of a hurry. ÊWell after finally being fed up with my touristy friends born and raised in towns I don't even care to remember talking about this place I finally hauled myself here. Is this the best ice cream in the world? ÊProbably not. ÊIs it the most affordable price? ÊDude, it's in the city.. I doubt it.... ÊBUT... was the ice cream made with natural ingredients, with friendly service, and satisfy my taste buds? ÊYup. ÊI went here after a full meal at Ike's Place and had the Balsamic Strawberry and Honey Lavender. ÊNow you may think that this is a weird combination but I found that the smooth taste of the strawberry toned out what could be a slightly overbearing taste of the honey and lavender if you're not used to such flavors. I wish I had the time or the balls to jump the counter, hold the staff hostage, while I grabbed multiple spoons to try all the flavors before the cops came but other things came about. ÊOne day... A boy can dream. If you got the time then swing by and enjoy your ice cream at Dolores Park across the street enjoying San Francisco's beautiful foggy summers (which with global warming is far and few lately - I mean REAL SF summer weather, not what you outsiders consider cold... psh...). ÊIf you're in a rush just stop by their side window and grab a prepacked pint. ÊOtherwise you go to your Cold Stone Creamers or Baskin Robbins and watch those idiots dance and sing for their quarter tip.

Bi-Rite Creamery gets it right...EVERYTIME!! This is the first stop i try to make once i make it out to SF. For ice cream i will wait, and for Bi-Rite i will wait a long time! Especially since the line sometimes wraps around the corner and down the street. There aren't many ice cream shops that are worth waiting 20 minutes for, but this is definitely the spot. It's the kind of ice cream that makes you feel like you're doing good for the world if that makes sense. They have unique flavors, some odd, some obviously delicious...i swear they could have a liver flavor and make it taste good! I usually go for the coffee toffee, salted caramel, and then test out one of their more unique flavors like strawberry balsamic and honey lavender...ALL GOOD! The ice cream has a reallly good consistency and texture which takes the cake from any other ice cream ive had, and you can get more than one flavor in each cup. Right across from Bi-Rite is Dolores Park which makes it an ideal location to sit and enjoy the Cali sun...the test is trying not to finish your ice cream before you even get across the street to enjoy the weather. Trust me, its hard. Their cookies aren't so bad either! I got the chocolate chip toffee ones that were nice and chewy. Next door, Bi-Rite has a soft serve window where you can get soft serve ice cream cones and ice cream sandwiches, and they also have a grocery store further down the street where you can buy their packaged ice cream to take home.

always a line, even in 50 degree drizzle. The secret is to go next door to their soft serve, they never have a line. The soft serve has more limited flavors but usually have their unreal salted carmel soft serve. Crack disguised as ice cream, you will have to buy a pint for yourself and your friends.

I *think* this is the most reviewed place on yelp! Sort of overhyped, but it is a hipster joint in SF so if you wonder where the 4000+ reviews came from, yeah. Wasn't bad or anything though, I still recommend paying this place a visit lol I got the Honey Lavender and the Salted Caramel flavors in the Single cup($3.25). The Honey Lavender was great, as it was a perfect balance of sweet honey and herbal flavors. The salt in the Salted Caramel was overpowering instead of bringing out the caramel flavor like it is supposed to. I know you can make ice cream with salt, but you're supposed to put a lot of salt on the outside of the ice cream maker, not the inside! ÊThankfully I had bottled water in my car lol. It's pretty cool how they give you unlimited samples to try though. Parking here is horrendous btw. I think I ended up parking illegally and blocked off half or more of some poor dude's driveway. Sorry!

I was fortunate enough to be sent to San Francisco for a conference and I researched the places I wanted to try. This was at the top of my list. I visited during the day so as to avoid lines. I went back again before the week was up, and would have gone even more had my travel companions been willing. But it was inconvenient to go to the Mission from where we were staying. I tried Earl Grey, Honey Lavender, Coffee Toffee and Salted Caramel. I loved them all. My travel companions thought that Honey Lavender tasted like soap...not everyone likes lavender flavors in food. The servers are so incredibly friendly to the point where they all seem pleasantly drugged. Nothing wrong with that. I might be that happy without the benefit of drugs if I could spend my days around high quality ice cream. I've seen some reviews suggesting that Bi-Rite is nothing special...how jaded would you have to be? We don't have anything like this here in the provinces of Washington DC. This ice cream haunted me. When I got back from my trip, I tried to figure out how I could get ice cream this good here at home. Tried Moorenko's - didn't do it. Tried SoCo creamery's Earl Grey. Not as good. Finally, I decided to try making my own ice cream. I used David Lebowitz's book and blog and was very happy with the results. You don't have to be a good cook, just able to follow directions. I would love to be back enough times to try every flavor and the ice cream treats such as ice cream sandwiches made with gingersnaps and Meyer lemon ice cream. For those of us not fortunate enough to live in San Francisco, apparently a Mecca of ice cream, Bi-Rite creamery is a peak experience.

I am on a quest to find the best places for food when I visit a city, and damnit I mean it! ÊWe were trekking around SF seeing sights, people, places and most of it via trolley cars or bus and to try and get to Bi-Rite was about an hour venture from only 5 miles away. ÊBut so worth it. Ê I've had some bad ice creams, and some amazing ones, and this is near the top of my list. ÊThe way they push the boundaries of flavor here is not only delicious, but thoughtful as well. ÊLavender is very hard to make perfectly palatable, without imparting either too much flavor (soapy) or too little (nothing). ÊThe Honey Lavender was PERFECT. Êthe BF and I tried 6 different flavors, all were decadent, I wanted more! ÊTHe only one I didn't care for was the Brown Sugar-ginger.. a bit too strong of a flavor for me, but my BF loved it.

Tried the Mint Chip, Roasted Banana, Balsamic Strawberry, and Salted Caramel. The mint chip was normal. Roasted Banana wasn't bad; you can definitely taste the real banana flavor. The balsamic strawberry was great as well. The salted caramel, hoping that it would be as great as yelp reviewers stated was not enjoyed by the three of us; the first bite was super sweet then came the bitter aftertaste. Maybe the salted caramel is an acquired taste...just not for me.

My gf made this place out to be the best place EVER!!!!!!!!! Not quite. The flavor selection is poor. The ice cream is wonderfully creamy. If they didn't have the lavender-flavored selection, I wouldn't bother going back. To be fair, I'm not big on ice cream. However, Ralph's Italian Ices and Ben & Jerry's Chubby Hubby are exceptions. If you like ice cream and mint chocolate chip impresses you, go.

I also had the Peanut Butter with fleur de sel nuggets - superb! To top it off, they vibe in this closet of a space is super cute, fun and the nicest service in the city. I mentioned to the dude with the scooper that it was my friend's b-day.

It was good. ÊNice gourmet flavors. ÊBut the ice cream quality itself was not better than Mitchell's. ÊOr, lord have mercy, the dreamy creamy quality of Emack and Bolio's in Boston. ÊThat is an ice cream town. But Bi-Rite was good! ÊGood location of you can handle the hipsters.

Among the best ice cream places *anywhere*. Ê I used to live in Boston, which (with some merit) considered itself the ice cream capital of the US (Christina's, Toscanini's, Steve's, Herrell's, and other great purveyors were always competing for supremacy). Ê Bi-Rite is as good or better than anything you'll have in Boston. Daring flavor combinations and emphasis on organic/sustainable practices are big pluses.

My first love for ice cream will always have to be Mitchell's as I have been going there since I was a little girl, but consider this place the gourmet Mitchell's for the new generation. Ê You have to love a place which carmelizes its banana splits with a mini blowtorch. ÊGreat flavors too.

Orange cardamom, butter brickle, salted carmel; the list goes on and on. Ê This is the single best ice cream in town. Ê Without a doubt. ÊYou will be tempted to try and stock up on it in order to avoid the long lines and have plenty on hand at home. Ê Resist this temptation. Ê Ice cream is like a vacuum cleaner for freezer odors and crystallizes in funky ways over time. Ê Eat in fresh, get it here, and you will find just the right balance of creaminess, sugar, and flavor. Ê I salute you Bi-Rite Creamery!

This is damn good ice cream. I moved here from Chicago a couple months ago, where I lived near a frozen custard shop I loved. But Bi-Rite Creamery is a legit replacement. I'm currently subleasing a place just a few blocks from here, so I've been eating way too much ice cream. The Mexican chocolate / banana combo is my current fave. Love the ginger. And the Ritual toffee. Oh, and the mint chip is delicious. Not a big fan of the salted caramel (too sweet) or the lavender (too perfum-y tasting). If only they made black licorice flavored ice cream like the Tillamook Creamery in Oregon. So good. I have celiac disease and have to be on a gluten free diet. Ice cream is usually pretty safe, as long as there aren't cookies in it, so I took a chance the first time I went here and was fine. But, they list the ingredients for most of their ice creams on their website, in case you'd like to take a look. Can't give this place five stars because the customer service is usually pretty crappy. Most of the employees there are unfriendly. I've heard them get pretty pissy at times, which is annoying. It's Bi-Rite, you know what to expect, it's usually going to be crazy busy, the least you could do is try to be nice to customers. Or find another job. One of the girls working there was for some reason in a particularly good mood when I went the other day - so much so that she called me "sweetheart." Um, excuse me hun, I'm probably much older than you are, I don't appreciate you calling me sweetheart. Especially when you're usually really rude to me. How 'bout finding a middle ground? Mmm-kay?

I haven't set foot in the place, but I'll still swear Bi-Rite makes the best ice cream in the Bay Area. Had the honey lavender and salt caramel melting together in a bowl for dessert last night at a friend's dinner party. ÊIt was so good it silenced a whole room full of blabbermouths for the first time during a long, fabulous meal. Can't wait to work my way down that list of flavors!

One of the best ice cream I ever had, thanks to a certain individual for showing me this place. Organic ice cream at its finest. Very unique flavors, which I have yet to try them all. I had the Salted Caramel and Balsamic Strawberry, they were different and at the same time interesting. I never had a salted ice cream of any sort and it blew my mind. Will definitely come back here on a hot sunny day. Unfortunately there are no table or seats which means you will have to enjoy your ice cream along Dolores Park, I guess I can't complain about that. UPDATE: Returned for another ice cream stop. 45 mins wait later ordered a scoop of Ginger and a scoop of Honey Lavender on a cone. ÊGinger flavor not strong enough however still very creamy, also as I was biting into it there was a small piece of baking paper! Oh wells, it happens I still like the ice cream. Honey Lavender was better than the ginger, it has a subtle lavender flavor, not overpowering.

Just superb. I am a guy who hardly ever thinks anything is worth the wait, but this pace is worth the wait. The salted caramel keeps me coming back again and again and again, but I'm also a fan of their balsamic strawberry, coffee, and orange cardamom, too.

I love this place! This is my favorite ice creamery in the city and believe me, I've tried practically all of theml - Swensen's, Mitchell's, Bombay, Polly Ann, etc. I love their malted vanilla ice cream with peanut brittle and milk chocolate bits. Heaven in a cup! I've tried their honey lavender, balsamic strawberry and snicker doodle flavors -- not bad, though I still prefer the malted vanilla. Every time I'm in the Mission I make it my mission to go here.

This is the best ice cream in the Bay. The creamery was hip and the employees were awesomely cool people. The guy gave us full-spoon samples which was differently appreciated. He mixed the most random ice cream together that tasted so uniquely delicious. Cookies 'n Cream with Mint Chip was my winner. Although, I will go back to get Salted Caramel which was oh-so-[expletive]-good!!! Happy dance was present as I enjoyed my small cup of this must-have ice cream. Next time, I'm going to get a gallon! Highly recommended. Two thumbs!

OHH Goodness... so much goodness. Banana split me anytime! Oh with the vanilla malted ice cream... Two weeks ago I nearly killed for a taste of the balsamic strawberry. My husband is crazy for the honey lavender and the seasonal flavor of pumpkin makes our taste-buds festively happy! Grab a frequent ice creamer card when you're there, cause you're bound to be back... a lot. Please don't even try to compare this place with Mitchell's. It's so completely different! Mitchell's is good and has some great flavors, but it never feels personal... it's more of a novelty. ÊAt Bi-Rite your orders are received with smiles and excitement as they fill you up with ice cream and treats made from local goods and ice cream made in quantities maintained to keep that homemade taste. Big plus is there single scoops can come in two flavors and you can try flavors you're curious about. They also sell their cookie dough, ice cream sandwiches, pies and tons of other goodies right there. When I indulge here I never feel that heavy lactose intolerant feeling. I almost don't even feel guilty (Danger, Danger!.) It's light and delicate and creamy and well... so yummy. Get some and bring me a scoop too!

Nice selection of flavors you will not find a 31 flavors. They even had soy ice cream (a good thing for us who are intolerant of lactose). Even with a single scoop you get two flavor selections, which is perfect for those who cannot decide. Just be prepared for a long line. It took us about 20 minutes on a Saturday evening.

Wow, this is truly an amazing ice cream Êplace! Before Bi-Rite I though Holy Gelato (in the Sunset) was the best ice cream in the City. I would now have to say, Bi-Rite has taken the cake, or... taken the cone. I had the sinker doodle ice cream, full of flavor and delicious. While there is limited seating inside, there are benches outside. I ventured over to Mission Dolores Park with my friends on an usually warm winter Saturday. Great way to spend an afternoon!!! PS... grab a punch card at the register and ask them to punch it. You'll be back,.... very soon. PPS... .Don't be scared of the line way the heck out the door.

It's the best ice cream in SF, although I wish it were denser and creamier like the best Wisconsin ice creams. Humprey Slocombe is a close second, with Mitchell's a distant third. Yes, it's well worth waiting in line for -- but please don't be that guy or girl who has to try and then deeply reflect upon each flavor before trying yet more flavors before finally ordering, because, yes, people in line behind you are in fact actually praying that you'll drop dead.

hahahah I didn't have to wait in any stinkin line. Not one. Just so happens a co worker had a birthday today and lucky me got to have their toasted pecan ice cream cake with a side of salted caramel ice cream. HELL YEAH. Let me tell you, as a bride-to-be on a strict diet/workout routine, there is nothing that would prevent me from digging into this creamy deliciousness. The salted caramel ice cream was just ummmmm, as one coworker awkwardly put it in front of everyone, "it's like a little orgasm with every bite" (odd looks and silence follow) ÊWhile I wouldn't say that in front of my bosses, this shit is pretty fabulous.

Had the Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Chocolate. Good stuff! BUT, docking one star for the way that they hurry you down the line. Understandable with the 50 other people lining up on the street, but the guy's attitude was not that great.

I have been "hanging out", as the kids like to say, in the Mission for less than three months, and yet I am already on my second punch card here. To be fair though, I take all of my friends here and then steal their punches that they could put on their own cards. Hmmm, that's not really fair at all actually. But I digress... I personally have only had ice cream here six times. Okay, I guess that's a lot. Why must you tempt me with your out of this world, fantastically stupendous ice cream Bi-Rite? While I enjoyed the salted caramel, ricanelas and mint chip, I was putting off trying the coffee toffee, because I knew myself well enough to know that once I had that, it would be game over and I would never try another flavor again. I was right and I will now only be able to sample their other flavors on one of Bi-Rite's spoons (I love that they have real spoons rather than evil disposable ones) or mooch off the many other friends I intend to bring to this establishment.

The first time I came here was on a hot summer night and the line was ridiculously long so it made sense. Then I came back a couple times on some colder nights (typical SF weather) and the line was still long, and I ended up leaving because my friends didn't want to wait. This time I came on an afternoon hoping that there wouldn't be a line, but I was wrong. It took us about 10 mins so it wasn't too bad, and it's worth waiting. So far I've only tried 4 flavors (ginger, honey lavender, roasted banana, toasted coconut) and they're all very good. Ginger is my favorite at the moment, and I am ready to go back and try some other flavors really soon. (I would give a 5-star if the line wasn't always that long)

I went to Bi-Rite Creamery a couple of weeks ago! I've been meaning to go for a long time. I decided to go since I was with my sister and my cousin at Dolores Park at the time. I know Bi-Rite Creamery is usually pretty crowded, but there was no line when we went, which was awesome! The employees were really friendly too. I told the lady working behind the counter that it was our first time here. She was cool about the samples and she even complimented me about my baseball jersey! :) I ended up getting the salted caramel on a cone. It was delicious! The texture was nice and the taste was very subtle. I'll be back again. Thanks Bi-Rite! :)

Before coming, I saw an episode of "The Best Thing I Ever Ate" on the Food Network featuring Birite. ÊIn the show, there was a mention of their famous chocolate ice cream with olive oil, and I knew I had to try it before leaving San Francisco. I visited this place on a sunny Sunday afternoon, and the line was along the wall and around the corner -- a definite good sign! ÊAfter 30 minutes and a bottle of water, I was finally inside! ÊI was not sure the exact name of the olive oil chocolate sundae, so I described it to one of the friendly and helpful staff. Ê"Sam's Sundae", he said with a chuckle, and served me the best sundae I have ever eaten. Here's the description of the sundae: "Chocolate ice cream with bergamot olive oil, maldon sea salt and whipped cream" The coldness of the ice cream quickly chills the olive oil and heightens its viscosity to create a perfect blend between the ice cream and the whipped cream. ÊThe crunchy texture and the saltiness of the sea salt provides the perfect contrast which accentuates the creaminess and sweetness of the sundae. ÊIt's a perfect balance on multiple levels.

Probably one of the best ice cream places you are going to find in the Mission District. If you are heading down by Dolores park and you wonder what that long line is for outside the store, it's Bi-Rite icecream! I happen to get the caramel-brown sugar swirl with mint chip and it was well worth the $3.25 for the two scoop ice cream. The service is nice and you really do get in and out quickly despite the deceiving long line!

Expectations were high when we went to Bi-Rite. Unfortunately we were disappointed. We loved the flavors we tried (lavender honey and coffee something or other). Bi-Rite's ice cream is fluffy- you can tell immediately when you hold it how light it is. If you like fluffy ice cream then you'll die for this stuff. If you are more inclined towards a denser and creamier ice cream you'll prefer Humphrey Slocombe.

I'm gonna sound like a broken record with all the other 5 star reviews, but this is really amazing ice cream. I waited in line about 25 minutes to get a scoop of brown sugar and a scoop of coconut, and I would wait another 25 minutes to go back and try the salted caramel. Not only that, but they played Salt N Pepa and En Vogue back to back. Made my Saturday. I also developed a slight lezzie crush on the girls working behind the counter. Could be because they were so liberally giving out samples of different flavors, or because ice cream is a personal aphrodisiac. In any case, I will go back again.

BI-RITE ice-cream = yummy they have all these favor's you would want to taste, and you must taste them all. My favorites Coffee Toffee, Earl Grey, and Roasted Banana. I'm not a big banana ice cream fan, but you gotta try it, it is so yummy definitely not an overwhelming taste of ripe bananas (I think ripe bananas taste gross)... Honey Lavender is pretty good too, but you must like flowers because it almost feels like your eating fragrance. The line is usually long, but it's worth the wait. Oh' the parking sucks.

After brunch we braved the rain to try this place. Heard such amazing things about it and really all i needed to hear was Salted Caramel ice cream.

When my SF-local friend kept recommending me this "salty" ice cream, I didn't understand how it could taste good. Yes, it does taste funky and unique in its own way, but it is delicious and thus worth a try - when you feel most patient for the line that continues down the block, that is.

Who cares that it was windy and cold outside---who can pass up eating ice cream!? =D It was our first time trying out Bi-Rite in the city today and we were lucky enough to beat the crowded lines that forms at this place. I'm so glad they had a menu posted outside their store ---way to get you excited and eager like a little kid waiting outside an ice cream store! I ordered a single scoop (you can choose 1-2 flavors) and of course the piggy I am, I got two flavors. (I almost wanted to order the double scoop, just so that I could get three flavors! =x) I ended up with the salted caramel and coffee toffee. The flavors are true to its name, super creamy, and melt-in-your mouth YUM. Good thing, D ordered two different flavors from me, because I got to try 4 flavors and not just two! Next time, I'm getting the double scoop and ordering the toasted coconut, salted caramel, and malted vanilla with peanut brittle!

Salted Caramel was really good, but the only problem is after the first few bites. It starts to become a little too sweet as you keep eating. I had to share my single scoop with a friend. The line isn't too long of a wait, but I'd say you definitely should try it if you haven't already.

At risk of getting tarred and feathered, I just don't get all the love this place gets. While the ice cream is remarkably... well, creamy... that's about the only thing that stands out to me. I tried just about all of their flavors and simply was not impressed. Salted caramel tasted like caramel popcorn, balsamic strawberry tasted like regular strawberry, honey lavender was too sweet and overpowering, etc. I don't think the ice cream here sucks, it's just that I don't think it's *that* much better (if at all) than Mitchell's, Polly Ann's, or Joe's Ice Cream.

Chocolate, Caramel, and similar related fans will love BRC for their creative concoctions. As a matter of fact the majority of Êtheir menu items revolves around chocolate and the like. Rich, delicious, and oh so naturally made. But I won't be returning on a regular basis, not because of the quality of the product, or because of the customer service, but because I prefer fruity icecream flavors aka "Mitchell's Ice Cream" on 29th St/San Jose. And the prices are set on "gourmet", so it's difficult for me to justify buying here. Parking is near impossible, so walk/bike/bus or use a friend with a car for a "drive-by". This is no way a negative review----just not my bag, baby.

The line was just about to turn the corner when my family and I got into line. ÊNote, this was at about 9:30pm on a Monday. ÊAnd it was worth the wait!! I had the salted caramel, and did it live up to the hype. ÊIt tasted like the caramel my family makes at home, just in ice cream form. ÊThe saltiness was just enough. ÊEveryone else was very satisfied with there 2 scoops of ice cream: vanilla with peanut brittle, ricanelas (cinnimon with snickerdoodles), toasted coconut, apricot sorbet, and more. ÊI cant remember the others. Ê And the price isn't bad at all. ÊFive people with 1-2 scoops on a cone, came out to $15. ÊI will definitely be back to try the other more adventurous flavors.

It was a gorgeous sunny afternoon in San Francisco. ÊI go play tennis at Dolores Park for about an hour. ÊIt got a little warm so I head over to Bi-Rite. ÊI ask the nice man behind the counter if they have any flavors that are sugar free, as I am watching my sugar intake nowadays, but he said no. ÊAnd the sugar amount in sorbet is actually higher than the regular ice creams, I had no idea. ÊWhatever, I wanted some ice cream. ÊI end up getting ginger and earl grey. ÊBoth flavors were really good, but the ginger definitely overpowered the light taste of earl grey. ÊALSO, there was no line at 2pm on a Thursday, yes!

Recently, took an acquaintance that was visiting from out of town. She looked at me and said, "I've never seen a line of grownups for ice-cream before" Êbut as soon as she tasted the vegan chocolate she understood it is well worth the wait. The flavors are exquisite no matter your mood - salted carmel (best paired with the roasted banana), honey-lavender, creme fraiche, orange cardamom, and amazing sorbets no matter the flavor. While I am not vegan myself and prefer ice-creams that aren't very plain the vegan flavors are incredible and even plain-jane vanilla is anything but. The staff moves very quickly mindful of the ever-present line, are friendly, and don't mind hand packing multiple flavors for you (always quickly) even if other customers are busy glaring at you for not just picking a single pre-packed flavor out of the fridge. I happened to swing by on Halloween this year and got served by the prettiest hipster zombie girl ever, and Hey Arnold which only endears me all the more.

Salted Caramel was on my "must try" list. I was always wandering why people love it so much, until I tried. I got a small cone for $3.25. I chose two flavors-salted calamel and white chocolate raspberry swirl. The caramel was a perfect combination of sweet and salty. The white choc raspberry was a little sour, but mostly sweet. BiRite is a great place to go to on a warm day like this. You can go sit in the park and enjoy your ice cream. No wander this place is so popular! :]

I found Bi-Rite after my family and I decided to do an ice cream-venture. Bi-Rite was our first stop, and boy I was hooked! In fact it was unanimously all on our #1 spot. Despite my disgust when I tried the Sam's Sundae (the Olive Oil made my tongue itchy), the Roasted Banana, Salted Caramel, Toasted Coconut, Coffee Toffee, Ricanelas, and Afternoon Sundae made me such a fan. I will return over and over, and it doesn't matter how long the line is.

we came here on a Monday night but the place was still packed. Êthe line-up was huge and almost reached the corner. Êbut judging by the velvet rope, there's always a wait for the most popular ice cream shop in san francisco. the store itself was dainty and cute with not much room for anything else but the ice cream counter, cash register, and a few seats. Ê(most customers lingered around the outdoor benches to enjoy their dessert.) we tried the following flavors: -toasted coconut -balsamic strawberry -chocolate -honey lavender -brown sugar they accidentally gave us the chocolate flavor when we asked for coconut but were nice enough to give us the coconut scoop on the house. i'm personally a huge fan of flowery flavors so i must recommend the honey lavender. Êthe brown sugar flavor was really rich and sweet-- recommended for sweet tooths. Êthe coconut had a nice flavor and pieces of coconut in it, not too strong. Êthe strawberry was nice and the oil was an interesting touch, definitely pulling away from being too sweet-- it created a unique pallet of flavors. Êlastly, the chocolate was extremely rich and creamy in texture, more so than most ice cream shops

Obviously this place shits on the rest! Such good ice cream. Such good quality fresh ingredients (local, organic produce/ingredients)! Totally worth the price and wait. The flavors are so creative (like honey lavender for example) and so yummy, it's kinda absurd how good it is. Ricanellas...if you don't try this signature, you're not livin' it. Snickerdoodle and cinnamon ice cream...amazing. My new fave is the malted vanilla with their fresh PEANUT BRITTLE - dank, chronic, delicious. One time they recommended a friend the roasted banana to pair with ricanellas and I thought roasted banana wouldn't be quite the business but WOW! Was I wrong...it tasted like a REAL banana! Not the generic, semi-banana flavors you get in like other ice creams and desserts. This was LEGIT. You gotta come here if you're in SF.

After spending the afternoon in Dolores Park, my friends from the East Bay brought up the fact that thy had heard about Bi-Rite. ÊSo even after eating all afternoon, off to wait in line we went. ÊAnd what a good decision that was. Even around 6 pm, there was a line, not yet around the corner. ÊOf course the business is ready with those line thingys from Disneyland and the airport. ÊAfter the wait, the buzz about the unique flavors got us chatting about what to try. Ê Although rather safe, I had the white chocolate with blackberry which was very creamy with enough tart from the fruit. ÊMy friends were a little more exotic with lavender and salted caramel which were much better than I thought they'd be. Ê After hyping it for so long, definitely would go back for gourmet ice cream with a fantastic cone and a reasonable price. ÊI am more of a fan of Bi-Rite than ICI in Berkeley. ÊThe flavors are more interesting and the vibe is nicer. ÊAvailable seating always helps.

We are ice cream crusaders and we were not let down by this fantastic shop. The line sucks though, but that's the price of good ice cream.

I believe there are two categories of ice cream joints- the kiddy kind and the adult type, which I base on the flavors and ambience of the establishments. Bi-Rite is hands down the best of the adult type I have ever had. The reason is simple- the flavors are wonderfully unique and not too sweet. Flavors such as earl grey, lavender honey, and balsamic strawberry make this joint wonderfully gourmet and a destination worth adventuring for the sake of ice cream perfection. This is in contrast to a kiddy place, which I am not opposed to, but has a menu full of mainstream flavors and a sugary sweetness that can be overwhelming like mint chocolate, rainbow sherbet, or cookie dough. I can always manage to find these flavors at my grocery store, so I like to eat out of the box when I'm adventuring for food.

Regardless of how cold it may be or wet outside if you are near Bi-Rite Creamery you must visit this place.

The one thing holding me back from not giving this place a one-star is the authenticity of the ice cream itself, but here goes the cons. parking is a bitch. the wait is horrendously long (30 min) especially in the cold ass weather. do not come here if you don't make it in time to stand in line by 10pm, cause they will have some person holding up a stupid "open/close" sign to block off people from the closed side. LAME. prices are overly priced for its quality, go to mitchell's instead. basically super overrated. this place, like any other places will pay yelp to put up the good reviews on top so you guys can't read the bad experiences. i basically found parking right smack in front of the place, oh how i felt lucky. decided to line up and stupid guy decides to say no, even to a nice girl who asked politely. don't think of getting any of my business and any referrals; plenty of other places with better price, quality, and especially service.

Bi Rite is one of the best ice cream spots I've been to. The only thing keeping this review from a solid 5 is that their lines are ridiculous. The first time I went to check them out was on a Saturday night and the line was down the block and around the corner. That's a good sign that but there was no way I'm going to wait in a line that long for ice cream. I ended up going back during an early evening on a weekday and only had to wait behind 15 or so people. I'm almost glad I had to wait because it took me awhile looking at all their unique flavors of the day to choose what I was going to try. Bi-Rite actually has two entrances, one is for regular soft serve and baked goods (there's no lines there) and the other is for the hard stuff. The people there were young, hip, and friendly and didn't at all rush me and didn't mind letting me sample a couple flavors. The ice cream wasn't completely hard, which is actually ideal because the it gives a smoother texture with more pronounced flavors. The portions were on the smaller side and the prices were a tad high but this is high demand artisan ice cream so it's fairly justified. Of the 18 flavors available when I went, most of them were out of the ordinary: Salted Caramel, Balsamic Strawberry, Roasted Banana, Malted Vanilla w/ peanut brittle and chocolate, Brown Sugar w/ ginger caramel swirl, Creme Fraiche, Chocolate Coconut, Honey Lavender, Brown Butter Pecan, PB&J (w/ blackberry jam), Ricanelas (cinnamon), and Toasted Coconut

The location is totally perfect since its right next to Dolores. The decor is very cute and quirky. I had such a hard time deciding becuase all the flavors sounded so interesting. I got a few samples and ended up with a scoop of the brown sugar with ginger caramel and a scoop of the coffee toffee. Both were so delicious. The brown sugar was so buttery and sweet and was perfect. The coffee toffee had a strong coffee flavor (which I like) but the chunks of toffee gave it a sweet balance. So yummy :)

Ahhh-ma-zing ice-cream. That said, finding parking was very hard. I came by on a Friday night around 10pm, to find a line of 20+ people, and after driving around the block a few times, I gave up and decided to come by the next day. Next day: Better, less than 10 people lining up, but still had to circle around the block three times before finding parking. (Please excuse the sidetrack, but not being able to find parking sucks when it acts as an obstacle between you and delicious ice cream.) Now back to the good stuff, ze ice cream. I had Salted Caramel, Honey Lavender and Coffee Toffee. All three flavors were strong and distinct in their own ways. The staff was very nice and patient during my mini break down due to the dilemma of having to choose between all the flavors. All in all, just as I expected, I LOVED the ice cream. Will be coming back to sample more flavors, and fingers crossed, I will have better luck with parking.

There are 2,000 reviews (really??). I don't need to say much else.

It's located right next to Dolores Park so you can always grab a cone and relax on the patchy grass.

I'll wait thirty minutes in line for a rollercoaster, but not for an ice cream cone. ÊThat line of reasoning always keeps me from coming here on weekends, when Dolores Park is full to capacity and the line at Bi-Rite runs around the block. On a Monday evening though I was willing to wait five minutes to see what the fuss was all about. ÊI got a cone with salted caramel because that's what everybody else makes a big deal of, and mint chip because I always like mint chip. Ê Salted caramel tasted like the sugar was allowed to burn a little too much, and was melting all over the place before I could even get it to the park. ÊSorry, doesn't live up to the hype. Mint chip tasted better and was much more structurally sound. ÊStill, since all mint chip ice cream is delicious, I'm not really sure how much credit to give them for that. Overall, I really like ice cream, and Bi-Rite Creamery sells ice cream. ÊIf I'm in the neighborhood and want ice cream and the line isn't outrageous, I'll gladly come back and try some other flavors.

Now I have an option for when Delfina's still full at 9pm and they won't let me in for dessert! I've only tried the salted caramel ice cream (really good), their ginger snap cookies (best ginger snap I've had), and their ginger ice cream (out of this world--though you have to be in the mood for non-ice-cream-flavored ice cream), but the creamery is getting a big thumbs up. They have a good mix of standards to go with their off-beat flavors. The ice cream falls someplace between gelato and regular ice cream--it's not your standard hard-serve scoops, so it's super creamy. (It doesn't bother me, but both times I've been helped, the employees have handled my cone with no gloves and no napkins. That's gonna drive some of the germaphobes away.)

Mitchells used to reign over my tastebuds, but no more---Bi-Rite Creamery has stolen me away. ÊOh my----if I lived nearer, I would eat here EVERY DAY! (and my internist would scold the heck out me for eating instant cardiac death)-----Instant cardiac death? Because there's no way ice cream this good could get that way without being seriously bad for you. Do note; these are adult flavors---although most people don't realize it, adding a little salt to sweet flavors adds depth and even intensity---but for people looking for "kid flavors", this isn't the place----that's OK, that just leaves more for ME!

Bi-Rite, how did I not know of your existence? ÊEspecially when you're a mere 3 blocks from Imagiknit (aka Yarn Heaven)! We met up for dinner in the Mission just so we could go here afterwards. ÊThe setup reminds me of Ici, but I really appreciate those U-shaped benches out front, and though crowded, there is a very small standing only space inside. ÊThe flavors were a little less adventurous than Ici (I shouldn't compare so much, but I can't help it) but still delicious. ÊI went with Coffee Toffee and Cinnamon with Snickerdoodles...I'm still wishing I had at least sampled the Salted Caramel, but I'm sure I'll be back. Bi-rite wins on location: being next to one of my favorite SF parks, walkable from MUNI and BART, and just down the way from all of the treasures on Valencia St. ÊI see many happy Sundays spent hitting up all my favorites spots in this area and lounging in park with some ice cream.

Salted caramel ... how I love your sweetness. The line going out the door can be intimidating. ÊHell, downright torture on those rare hot days in SF. ÊBut, the salted caramel ice cream is totally worth it. Ê To try different flavors without the actual commitment, ask for a sample. ÊWhat you get is a generous spoonful of a sample on a REAL spoon. Ê Like a gelateria, your one scoop size ($3.25) comes with the option of 1 or 2 flavors. ÊWhen you're getting 2 flavors on a cone, it behooves you to plan ahead which flavor you want on the bottom. ÊI got honey lavender on top, salted caramel on the bottom. Ê Just 4 stools at a counter to enjoy your treat away from the foggy cold air. Ê Little benches encircle the trees outside. Ê If you go across the street to sit on the grass at Dolores Park, watch out for licky dogs sneaking up on you.

I am hesitant to say this, given that I am such an ice cream fanatic and I'd like to leave the field open, but Bi-Rite may be the best ice cream I have ever had! I had a sugar cone with Salted Caramel and Roasted Banana ice cream. ÊExtremely creamy, unique, intense, complex flavors. ÊThe portions are small but due to the complexity of the flavor, larger portions would really be unnecessary. This isn't the type of place to come if you just want to get your traditional fill (oversaturation?) of milk and sugar. Ê Would be nice if they had a bigger location so that the store would be more than just one big line, but really, the ice cream was so damn good that I can't complain!

Easily the best ice cream ever on the face of the earth!!! Its super good and the people who work there are super nice! Its located right next to dolores park so after you get ice cream you can enjoy the beautiful scenery on a hill. Its not cheap, but not pricey...On hot nights it can get pretty busy, creating a line of around 15 people out the door, near the street corner. There are also benches outside if you don't want to go to the park. This place is wonderful. Just go...you won't believe it will be your first time, and it definitely won't be your last!

I would give it 10 stars if I could, just for the chocolate, toasted coconut, and salted caramel. ÊThe chocolate is just to-die-for, being deep and rich in its flavor, without too much milk or sugar to dilute it. ÊThe toasted coconut is a nice complement to the chocolate, and the salted caramel had a wonderful combination of sweet with just a bit of salt to bring the other flavors out. Ê I've been absolutely thrilled with every flavor I've tried there -- in addition to the 3 above, I've tried the Mexican chocolate, malted vanilla, coffee toffee, and cookies and cream. Parking in the neighborhood totally sucks, but the ice cream makes it worth the trouble. ÊI've been lucky to get there at times when there's no line, but even when the line wraps down to the corner, it tends to move pretty quickly. ÊThe servings are on the generous side, so be warned that if you get the 3 scoop size, you'll end up with close to a pint of ice cream. Ê Ê Every time I find myself up in the city, I try to make it a point to stop here, even if it's out of the way. ÊPlus, it's organic, so it must be good for you... or at least that's how I justify it to myself.

New Review: Owners of Bi-Rite Ice Creamery are probably reading my review because the flavors are so awesome now! ÊI love the roasted banana and toasted butter pecan ice cream. ÊI'm still not a fan of the lavender ice cream, but that's my preference. Ê ______________ I live on the block of Bi-Rite Ice Creamery and there is ALWAYS a huge line on the weekends and after 7pm.

ÊThe price of the ice cream is moderate and there are a variety of flavors to choose from. ÊThe only flavor I like at Bi-Rite Ice creamery is the Balsamic Strawberry.

I came here twice in the last week or so. ÊAddicting...if I lived in the Valencia area, this would be my greatest weakness. Flavors are unique and very creative. ÊGood for adventurous eating types (and even the not-so adventurous). Coffee Toffee - Is hella good. ÊThe toffee may make it a little sweet for some tastes, but its good for me! Banana - Also hella good. It tastes like a banana flambe kind of thing. If you're going for a mix, add this to Coffee. Mint Chip - Indulging in the Asian-ness. ÊIts very minty! Hardly ever taste mint that has a strong mint flavor, but its so good! Vanilla w. Peanut Butter and Chocolate - I'm not usually a peanut butter fan (yes, you people can kill me now), but its really good in the vanilla. ÊA bit crunchy with a good texture to it. Ê Portions are a little small, but deal with it. Its darn good ice cream. Service - Pretty good. The people working behind the counter are just as friendly if its packed, or if there's not many people around. Plus - On weekends, if you want a pint of your favorite flavor, you can bypass the HUGE line outside to get some. ÊOn a nice day, I'd suggest walking to the top of Dolores Park with your ice cream. Nothing beats the SF view with good food. ÊMmM...

Not impressed at all. Long lines, but thought it would be worth the wait. ÊFor the real good stuff, I suggest getting a gelato in North Beach. Although the flavors here sound cool, they're much the same. All I tasted was frozen cream (as in ice-cream). It wasn't smooth or creamy and the flavor was an aside rather than part of the ice-cream. Had to try what everyone was talking about, but if I catch myself in this neighborhood again I will walk down the bloc to Tartine Bakery instead.

One of my friends was going on and on about how she's always wanted to try Bi-Rite but has never had the right people to wait in line with. A couple of us decided to pile up in the car and go check this place out. Now, I don't have any favorite flavors when it comes to ice cream; so I ended up getting one scoop of mint chip and the other, cookies n' cream. Close enough right? Anyway, I was thoroughly satisfied when I finished devouring it. So much that I ended up going back inside just buy a pint of cookies n' cream ($7.99, totally worth it). They use vegan-friendly ingredients too. I suggest you give it a try. Definitely made my summer day. :) PS - There's a rumor going around that Bi-Rite is gonna open up on Arguello.

I love ice cream and this is one of the best places I've been to. The lines are always out the door when we go. Even on the coldest day ever when the last thing on my mind is ice cream, I always see a line when I drive by. My favorite is the toasted coconut. So creamy and the coconut flavor is amazing. You can also find tiny bits of coconut mixed in which only makes the ice cream even more yummy. I've also had a taste of the roasted banana from my husband's cup and it's wonderful as well. Amazing banana flavor that you can't miss . I also tried my friend's earl grey (I didn't get it because I am not a fan of earl grey, the tea.) but it was actually good - maybe because it didn't taste like earl grey.

Nothing like homemade ice cream. It was probably one of the best cookies and cream I've ever had. Creamy with a nice portioned chunks of cookies.

I made my way up to San Francisco from San Jose with my girlfriend just to try Bi-Rite Creamery, due to its tremendous reputation. I arrived at Bi-Rite and i immediately noticed a long line stretching out to the sidewalk, but surprisingly i was ordering at the counter within 10 minutes.

None of them beats Bi-Rite's MINT ICE CREAM! haha I'm in love, and my girlfrind is too.... haha To sum it up, This place is amazing.

I will parrot a majority of the reviews here: Salted Caramel In my quest to impress picky eater friends, I shared different ice creams with them. They couldn't get enough and I was a local hero. On my first trip to Bi-Rite, I enjoyed the Browned Butter Pecan (oh SO good!) and the Ricanelas (who can resist cookies?!?!). This trip, I savored Salted Caramel (*drool) and the Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Chips (good, but not heart stoppingly great). While Fentons is a school kid's dream with their decadent, chunky flavors with traditional and fantastic toppings, Bi-Rite is ripe with fresh, sophisticated grown up flavors.

Who knew diabetes could taste so damn good? When I come to Bi-Rite Creamery I usually stuff my face with as much honey lavender as my sensitive stomach can handle.

And all the others flavors are fantastic as well....go try them! Êthey are really friendly and lets you try all the flavors if you REALLY want. ÊGogogo!!!

To most of the reviewers, I might just sound damn right crazy... Is there such a thing as ice cream being too sweet? I certainly do believe such a claim! I saw this creamery featured on one Food Network's show and HAD to try it while I was in town last weekend. I had the Coffee Toffee and the Brown Sugar with Caramelized Ginger. The coffee in the Coffee Toffee was over powering and slightly bitter, and there wasn't much toffee. The Brown Sugar was overly sweet which was a bit hard for me to swallow and could not taste the ginger either. I had a taste of the Mint Chip which I enjoyed because it tasted very natural and sweetened perfectly. I also tried the Honey Lavender which was prob a bad idea considering I don't like lavender much but it sounded interesting. I felt that the main flavors were just a bit too intense and overpowering instead of complimenting and balancing out the other flavors. I really wanted to love this place but I simply could not. One thing I really appreciate though is that it is organic and natural. Maybe my taste buds were off that day... I think I'd have to give it a second shot to finalize my opinion about Bi-Rite...

This ice cream place is AMAZING!! I've never been so happy about ice cream. It's my favorite ice cream place now. Ê I had the honey lavender, brown sugar, and balsamic strawberry the last time I was there. It was awesome. :) They're eco friendly too. Everything is compostable. Parking is horrible, and the line is always long, but it is totally worth the hassle.

I have never, ever been disappointed by Bi-Rite Creamery. Actually, I think I fall in love with it more and more each time I go. Honey lavender, earl grey, salted caramel, balsamic strawberry, brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl...oh lord absolutely THE best ice cream I've ever had. Super flavorful and unique, but not overly creamy or heavy tasting. They give you pretty hearty spoonfuls when you want to taste the different flavors, which is a huge plus in my book. They recently expanded the ice cream shop to include more seating - but that doesn't necessarily mean that you'll find a seat inside. I feel like SF people eat ice cream in any kind of weather, so expect a line (sometimes to the end of the block) even when it's marginally sunny out. But no worries, it generally moves pretty quickly and it's SO WORTH IT.

When I went to Bi-Rite Creamery for my first time, I noticed that there was a super long line at night around closing time.. It seems to me that people like me were crazy enough to wait in a long line to get ice cream on a saturday night when they can be doing something else. I thought, "hmm this place must be special".... I can tell you that the staffs are super friendly and nice... If you are unsure of what flavors to get, they let you sample as many flavors as you need and are nice about it... Some of their ice cream flavors are a little too extreme. Their ice creams have strong taste and it brings party in your taste buds... This place is def. a place to visit when your around the area. I can't get over how their neighbors can deal with the crowd and all the noises at night...

I love an ice cream shop with unique flavors, and Bi-Rite definitely has an array of interesting choices besides the old standards. The salted caramel. toasted coconut and honey lavender all looked promising, but I ultimately went with the roasted banana, since I love most anything banana-flavored. This was hands down, the best banana ice cream I've ever had! It was a great balance of creamy and a little salty, with flecks of banana all over it. Definitely not your standard Runts-esque boring banana. My partner went with mint chocolate chip, and thought it was pretty great as well. We took our cones down to Mission Dolores Park, which is right around the corner, and enjoyed every bit. Plus, for homemade ice cream, a single scoop in a cone didn't break the bank!

MIght as well add to the hype! The first time I came here I thought it was a club - the line was wrapped around the block! Yes, the line is long, and yes, parking does suck, but really good things never come easy. I come here solely for the salted carmel ice cream. As noted, the single is 2 scoops - so a more subdued flavor like roasted banana or ginger is a good complement. The texture is smooth and very creamy and the salted caramel is especially rich and robust in flavor. Buying a pint is more cost efficient, but as other Yelpers have noted, it melts fast. Maybe bring an ice chest? There is limited and crammed indoor seating - so probably not a fun evening outing if it's super duper cold outside. But go anyway!!

wow, how have I not already reviewed this place with its sweet sweet ice cream action? I love the wackier flavors at Humphrey Slocombe, but the quality of the ice cream here is much higher. I'm always torn between Ricanelas (cinnamon ice cream with specks and chunks of snickerdoodles) v. Salted Caramel (smoky buttery caramel with salty flecks of mmmmhhmm). And then I always top it off with whatever tea flavor they have or orange cardamom. Earl Grey somehow makes an awesome ice cream flavor. Lines on hot days can wrap around the block and even on drizzling cloudy cold nights, there will be six or seven cheery people waiting in line. Soft serve kiosk is a little ways down the block.

I don't know. Maybe it was the overhyping or my super high expectations but I wasn't really impressed. Plus since Scoops (in L.A.) has become a part of my life it's hard to find another ice cream shop that's equally as good. I would actually put this on par with Lucerne ice cream. Yes that's safeway brand ice cream for those who don't know. Nothing special. Pass for me.

Bi-lieve the hype people! When three of my favorite Yelpers, Ciara G, David G, and Michelle T give an establishment a 5 star review, you better bi-lieve it will be an amazing place. Bi-Rite Creamery is a San Francisco legend. I swear that not a week goes by where I don't see a new review or review update on this wonderful ice cream parlor by one of my many Yelp friends. I have had it bookmarked for well over a year and last week I finally had the privilege to indulge in Bi-Rite's tasty treats. Bi-Rite is a tiny joint, located in the mission district of SF. No matter what time of day you visit Bi-Rite, rain or shine, this shop will never be empty. The night I stopped by was a cold, windy night and there were still six people ahead of me. Their menu was packed full of delicious sounding ice creams and sorbets. Not to mention Popsicle's, ice cream sandwiches, baked goods and ice cream cakes and pies. Since it was my first time I sampled many of their flavors. This is what I sampled: Toasted Coconut Honey Lavender Roasted Banana Balsamic Strawberry Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces Every one of these flavors was freaking fantastic, especially the Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces. I would have to agree with David G, who said that this flavor is "the greatest ice cream in the history of man". I remembered that both Ciara and Michelle had mentioned the Sam's Sundae in their review, which is a sundae that consists of two scoops of chocolate ice cream, drizzled with bergamot olive oil and sprinkled with Malden sea salt and a side of whipped cream. It sounded wonderful except for one element, the chocolate ice cream. Don't get me wrong, I love chocolate ice cream, and I'm sure Bi-Rite's is too die for, but with all their unique flavors I felt that I needed something more exotic than plain chocolate. I decided to create a modified version of Sam's Sundae using the Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces ice cream. The guy who made my sundae said it wouldn't be good, the guy who rang me up said it wouldn't be good, hell, even I thought it sounded strange. But guess what, it was phenomenal. I have never tasted a sundae that tasted as beautiful as my modified Sam's Sundae. This sundae had so many levels of yumminess. It was sweet, salty, tangy and creamy all at the same time. It sounds strange but trust me, it was fabulous. I also got a balsamic strawberry ice cream sandwich made with sugar cookies. It was also really, really good. The prices and service here was great. Even though there were a bunch of people in front of me, the line moved quickly. I don't remember exactly how much I paid for my two treats but I know it was not over ten dollars. In all honesty, I would have paid ten bucks for my modified Sam's Sundae alone. Trust me when I say that it is a must that you try Bi-Rite at least once in your life. If you don't Bi-lieve me then just ask Ciara, David or Michelle, they will tell you to Bi-lieve the hype that surrounds Bi-Rite.

I came to San Francisco for a conference and had a free day Saturday the 15th. Knowing this already I knew one of the must-go places to stop by was Bi-Rite Creamery, after seeing Sam's Sundae on Food Network's The Best Thing I Ever Ate with Aida Mollencamp (funny thing it should be "The Best Thing I've Ever Eaten). So a couple of friends and I took a taxi here (well worth the fare in my opinion) and we arrived about an hour before it opened. During the taxi ride though I did notice a line outside some place on the corner of Guerrero and I'm not sure what other street. It turned out to be Tartine Bakery, another place I wanted to go to, and basically I got baked goods from there....but AFTER waiting in line and buying the bakery's goods...Bi-Rite Creamery was open. Here it is ironically short, sweet, and to the point. GET SAM's SUNDAE! Amazing chocolate ice cream, orange-ish olive oil, sea salt, and whipped cream make for a WOW ice cream sundae...you don't even need any of that caramel or chocolate fudge etc etc. After eating such an amazing sundae, I decided to get 5 flavors of other ice creams...Salted Caramel, Roasted Banana, Brown Sugar Ginger Swirl, Earl Grey, and Brown Sugar something.... All good, especially the earl grey in my opinion, but I still kept thinking about that Sam's Sundae... Just go and get one! I miss it already :|

Not sure what compelled me to buy a bunch of ice cream sandwiches since I generally don't like them. ÊCookies tend to be hard as a rock and not very fresh. Ê Here's what I bought: Sugar cookies with balsamic strawberry ice cream: Sounds weird and disgusting, but I really like it. ÊStrawberry has never been my favorite flavor and still isn't, but I'll eat this any day. ÊIt wasn't too sweet and had a nice subtle tartness to it. ÊPaired nicely with the sugar cookies. Ê Chocolate chip cookies with vanilla ice cream: If you're boring and unadventurous, you'll enjoy this. ÊDon't get me wrong, it was good, but too plain and ordinary for me. Dark chocolate cookies with mint chip ice cream: ÊOne of my favorite ice cream flavors and who can resist dark chocolate cookies? ÊI've had better mint chip ice cream though. Orchid watermelon popsicle: Sounds exotic, but not worth the money or time. ÊDidn't taste the orchid (not really sure what orchid is supposed to taste like) and the watermelon flavor was faint.

Being a first timer, I wanted to try basically everything and at first I felt like I was getting pretty annoying, but they were super nice about it and even encouraging that I try more. The flavors were seriously out of the ordinary. And as for the wait in line, it's pretty moderate. It gets crowded some days, but for the most part, it moves pretty quickly.

Took the J-Church and walked up a block to Bi-Rite for a little fantastic ice cream. Flavor did not disappoint. ÊI had a triple with mint chip, cookies and cream, and malted vanilla with peanut brittle. ÊThe ice cream is first rate and the flavors are simply outstanding. ÊThat has not changed. What has changed are the servings. ÊVery noticeable reduction in how much a serving consists of. ÊA single serving isn't even the since of a standard ice cream scoop.

I came here after many recommendations from friends. I bought a pint of the SALTED CARAMEL, BANANA, and ROCKY ROAD. Let's just say I want to live in a tube of the salted caramel ice cream, it's so flavorful and creamy. The rocky road was sooo good, with little bits of homemade marshmallows and almonds! I usually don't like rocky road ice cream, but this one is awesome. The banana was "meh," I felt cheated for spending $7 on it. However, the other two flavors made up for the banana's short comings. :-P

ÊLearned about this place from my 15-year old niece...and she asked me to take her...and I'm thinking, "Really, an ice cream place all the way in the City...it better be good!" ÊAnd it surely was. Pros: * The servers are all cordial and efficient with managing multiple orders...slightly impressive with all of the patrons they get * The servers let you take multiple samples...okay, let's not take advantage here...maybe two to three max is appropriate without pissing off the people behind you * Their samples are served on silverware spoons...not plasticware...Yay, go green! Ê * The flavors are all extremely unique combinations and prepared from scratch * They offer a variety of toppings, sundaes, baked goods, novelty/popsicle items, sauces and other items for your sweet tooth Cons: * The line outside the door will make anyone who doesn't have 10-20 minutes to spare for ice cream want to pass on this place...however, you will be sorry. * Limited seating inside and outside Perhaps one of the best ice cream places I've been introduced to in my lifetime...no joke. ÊI am partial to their version of the banana split and have already had it more than a few times. ÊNext time, I am going to try another sundae called the Berry Sundae. Hope you notice the more than 2800 reviews on this place and swing by...it's delish!

First review ever..Yeah me! After hearing mixed reviews from friends about the ice cream, I'd thought I stop by to try firsthand. There are about a dozen flavors on display, some of the usual suspects (cookies and cream) and a few yummy different looking flavors. I tasted two: the honey lavendar and the salted caramel. I liked both because it was different but not too weird. The employee was friendly and Êhelpful. I ended up with the salted caramel which was rich, creamy and sweet. I got a single scoop and I almost didn't finish it because it was way rich and almost too sweet. if you are craving Êice cream like they used to make it in the old creameries, come here. It's definitely a treat but too much might make you feel a little sick...

OK, OK, this was as amazing as everyone claims it is. I love that you can order a single scoop and get two flavors, brilliant! The salted caramel was really good, it tasted just like a Werther's Original. ÊMy favorite though was the balsamic strawberry. Two things really good on their own, but with their powers combined . . . I only take away one star (i would take off half if i could) because I thought the sugar cone tasted like cardboard. Yes i know that Bi-Rite prides itself on being natural and organic but the cone should not be. ÊNext time I will get a cup. Ê If only it wasn't so close to my work . . . this could be trouble.

My boyfriend and I love ice cream.. he loves Mitchell's and I love Bi rite. so we try to go to both evenly... their flavors are different, consistent and delicious. balsamic strawberry and roasted bananas are the ones I always order. When I want to take it to the next level, I ask for brownie pieces on top. The little chunks of goodness are moist and gooey... ah... nothing better than adding another 500 calories to your ice cream, especially after a nice, heavy dinner. after you have your ice cream, take a nice stroll at dolores park. on a clear night, you have this beautiful view of the city, which makes your ice cream-eating experience more formidable.

After the free stuff fair in Dolores Park, my omnivore friends craved some ice cream, so we stopped by Bi-Rite. I was just waiting in line with them, when BAM! I saw it. Soy chocolate ice cream. So I picked up a scoop with some roasted walnuts. It was bomb. Even on a cold day.

All the five-star ratings here are yet more proof that many yelpers either have little grasp on high-quality & are way too easily impressed. Yes, the ice cream is good here, maybe the best I've had in SF, but it's nothing super special. All the flavours seem to be Philadelhia-style, rather than French-style ice creams & the cream content does seem a bit off. Also, the flavours could do with some punching up. The ice creams pale into comparison to ice cream I've had in Berlin, as well as my home-made ice cream. If you want really good ice cream, invest in an ice-cream maker & some quality ingredients. It's really simple to make & oh-s0-bloody good.

Excellent selection of homemade ice cream and generous servings, whether you are ordering a cup or cone. Personally, I take my ice cream in a cup, no matter what people say. I really liked the butter pecan, but wasn't much of a fan of the salted caramel. Guess we'll see what other flavors I like next few times I return.

Roasted banana, my love. Great flavors, great people. No wonder it's nearing winter yet the line wraps around the block for ICE cream. Also you might be weirded out by Sam's Sundae on the menu: olive oil and sea salt on ice cream? Trust me and do it. It's a heavenly combo.

Okay, so I like playing Russian Roulette with incredibly amazing flavors of ice cream and today I got nailed with one of the best I've ever had...Chai Spiced Milk Chocolate!!!! Holy Cannoli, it just about made me cry, it was so dang good. The spicy chai and silky chocolate are such great playmates, I hope they stay together for a long, long time. There is a strong cardamom finish that just carries you away to nirvana with every bite. mmmmm....more, please! ***One note of caution: Don't get there too late! because if you stick around and sit on the bench and eat your ice cream, Êyou'll have to see all the sad people who show up after they've closed. It's hearbreaking to see those long faces as you greedily devour your cone.

ÊIt's kinda of like a gelato place where you can sample the different kinds and then pick the one you want. ÊOh yeah, if you want it in a cup it's cheaper.

We decided to head over after dinner on a week night. We lucked out cause when we got there, the line was short, and it quickly grew by the time we had ordered. The variety of flavors was awesome and the servers were great about letting us try different options. I tasted the roasted banana, which had a good flavor (although i wouldn't say it was very different from a regular banana flavor... but still very tatsy). I also tried the Honey Lavender, which was amazing.. and different, as well as the salted caramel. I ended up getting the balsamic strawberry, which at first just tastes like strawberry, but you start to notice the slight tang to it, which is a great, subtle flavor. I'd go back again, just to try the other flavors as well as the cakes and cookies they also sell. :)

Bi Rite gets 5 stars for getting it right in all the areas they could have gone wrong. -cute and clean interior -unique and masterfully balanced flavors -creamy ice cream -sweetness is just right -consistent quality and open just the right hours -offer sundaes and cookies, brownies, other pastries -nice, efficient staff -frequent buyer card As my experience with SF ice creameries expands,so does my appreciation for Bi-Rite Creamery. I think sometimes ice creameries that try to get creative don't get the balance of mixing flavors right or get a little too creative. ÊBi-Rite has a pretty regular menu of flavors that you can come back and get consistently. My favorites are Balsamic Strawberry - strawberry with JUST the right amount of balsamic tang, Honey Mint Lavender might be one of my favorite ice creams of all times - it has a yummy aromatic taste/smell that is actually really soothing - and the honey tinges it with a comforting sweet, and Ricanelas which is cinnamon snickerdoodle - the cinnamon is so good and the snickerdoodle chunks drive me wild. Ê YUMMM. ÊI will eat anything and everything here. ÊAnd of course, it's conveniently located to Dolores Park. ÊYou can also stroll over there from any Mission restaurant after dinner. They also have gift cards, which I've bought for a friend's birthday before; Êyou can also find their pints of ice cream at the Bi-Rite Market if you're there and want to take some home. ÊIf they don't have a pint of what you want, they will hand pack pints of whatever flavor you want.

I like ice cream. ÊI really like the ice cream at this ice cream store. I am struggling to distinguish my review from those of my predecessors. ÊYou know the ice cream is good, so let me tell you about my experience with the store, instead of the ice cream itself. As we waited in the sizable line, a guy walked by and loudly asked the crowd to part so he could get through, explaining he is a local. ÊBut I looked at the faces in the line around me.

When considering Bi-Rite Creamery, the right question is whether it's line-worthy. Is it line-that-goes-out-the-door-down-the-block-and-?sometimes-around-the-corner-worthy? The unique flavors make this place worth it. If you're looking for standard vanilla, skip it. Go to Albertsons. If you're looking for salted caramel, or brown sugar with ginger twist, or lavender honey, or any of the other bizarre and random flavors, this is where you'll find them. And for that, it gets five stars. Yay!

It's great ... unquestionably great ice cream. There are two problems: 1. The line 2. The people in the line who insist on tasting every flavor when they know that there 7,000 people in line behind them. See my review of Tartine, because it's almost the same. I can't help but think "idiots" every time i see people lined up around the corner of Dolores Street for this place.

I have had ice cream and gelato all over the world and nothing compares to Bi Rite's balsamic strawberry ice cream. It tastes unlike any other strawberry I have ever tasted, like strawberry flavor raised to the infiniti. I also like the salted caramel. I visited Bi Rite after chowing down at Tartine for breakfast...which included a lemon tart...and my friend insisted I try Bi Rite. They were so nice, they totally let me just taste everything, so I had to give in and buy a scoop.

Had to check it out from word of mouth and the reviews on yelp etc. The line last night was not crazy at all at 6:30 pm. I had the salted caramel and toasted bananna. It was very good....but I think there are better in San Fran...namely Swensens and Mitchell's(which the line is always very long). Bi rite has unique flavors...very boutiquey Êhoney lavander etc....the flavors are nice but not very strong. The texture is nice smooth and creamy. The staff is very nice helpful and patient. I would go back...but I would rather go to the other two mentioned above.

If Bi-Rite Creamery was closer to my house, I would weight 300lbs. This ice cream shop was an instant hit since the day it opened. The ice cream is so fracking good! Yes the line can be hellacious, but if determined, well worth it. The sundaes are crazy good and get me zipping around like a 3 year old full of Otter Pops. A definite sugar bomb. So tasty. The creamery/bakery has expanded and now has a walk up soft serve window. Got to love that! If you find the scoop line too unbearable, maybe the soft serve window will do the trick.

FINALLY! Every time I pass by this joint, there's a line snaking around the corner. I paid a visit to GRX this past rainy Sunday and noticed the absence of a line. I immediately scampered over and tried their Honey Lavender and Salted Caramel with Ginger. KICK BUTT. The workers behind the counter were a delight, actually walking each customer through the myriad flavors (unlike the dbags at Humphrys) You would expect with a constant flow of customers, they would be too busy to give you samples.

Whenever I get out of town visitors, I take them here. Each one of them says its the best ice cream they have ever had. You really can't go wrong with any flavors; even chocolate will amaze you. My favorite though, is the salted caramel. Theres something about the salty burnt surgery taste that I love. Eat it quick though, because it melts faster than other favors. I recently tried their banana split as well, which was delicious and way more than enough for two people! When I saw the employee pull put a blow torch and start melting caramel over the banana, I knew I was in for something special. I've heard Mitchell's is better, but the location of Bi Rite makes it better by default. ÊGet your amazing ice cream, and go enjoy it at the park across the street! There is nothing better!

My Format: Price, Atmosphere, Selection (of products), Customer service, and Final thoughts. Price (5 Stars) As I always say, if the price fits the craftsmanship and taste then they deserve to get paid for it. I feel fine paying $5 for 3 scoops of the best ice cream I have ever tasted. Atmosphere (5 Stars) Not much to the place but Êthe line around the corner will give you a good feeling about whats to come. Expect a looooong line come summer. Selection (5 Stars) Lots of flavors and holders for them, not much else to say :-P Pre-packed pints too. Customer Service (5 Stars) I once went in there asking for my 3 flavors in 3 separate cups because I hated with my mint chip got mixed with cookies and cream and other flavors. Its almost a crime for the flavors to befoul each other like three princes in a fight to the death for the sovereign crown. So they Êmade me happy and i left with a fistful of cups :-) Thats called going the extra step. Final thoughts... This is what ice cream was meant to be. I normally love a ton of chunks in my ice cream but with this place less is truly more. A MUST TASTE when you come to S.F. The mint chip will clear your sinuses... and its not green!!!

We spotted the take-out window first, and assumed that was all they made. Like hungry beasts, we quickly purchased the salted caramel soft serve (wouldn't you?). ÊWe were disappointed that it was sickeningly sweet but not at all salty enough. As we ventured down the street, we discovered that they made regular ice cream as well, and after having a sample of that version of salted caramel, found it to be much saltier, but our insulin levels had already maxed out for the day :( So if salted caramel is what you seek, be patient and walk ten steps down to the actual storefront!

Went here a few nights ago with the hubby, along with his cousin and cousin's friend. It was past 9 pm, and pretty chilly - typical SF night. Mind you, this night was days before the recent heat wave, and yet there was still a line that reached the end of the block. 30 cold minutes later, I finally reach the front of the line. The fat kid in me wanted to try all of the flavors, but in the end I settled for a scoop of the salted caramel and a scoop of the coffee toffee. Coffee toffee, in my opinion was the better choice. Although salted caramel seems to be the majority favorite, it tasted a bit bitter... as if they burned the caramel. Maybe it was a bad batch. Personally I've had better ice cream, but the I'm still intrigued by the other flavor selections. Looks like I'll be venturing out to BiRite in the near future. Hopefully my next experience will be better.

This is the best ice cream I have ever had, worth eating despite the freezing cold wind. I had the roasted banana, perfect and not fake tasting at all, and the vanilla malt which had yummy crunchy chocolate things in it. My mom had the salted caramel, again delicious, and the prailine.

Ice cream always makes you happy. I ordered the toffee coffee and ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles). The ice cream was thick and creamy, absolutely delicious. The ricanelas had a great cinnamon flavor, with some chewy cookie bits. The toffee coffee had wonderful coffee flavor with delicious, crunchy bits of toffee running throughout. Even a single serving is quite generous, and even better since you can pick two flavors!

did it live up to the +3K reviews? absolutely - the husband who doesn't like ice cream ever loved the salted caramel and snickerdoodle one. the hype is not hype, it's fact. Êand the service is ridiculously wonderful. Êway way nicer than ici on college in berekely. Êtake the time to make the drive and be unbelievably delighted.

Went here for dessert after Ike's (don't judge the degree of fattiness) and was immediately daunted by the writing on the freezer case holding the freshly made ice cream; it kinda looked like a science class lecture which made my brain shut down since I have been repeatedly traumatized by those classes. But I took a deep breath, ignored it, and asked for samples of flavors that piqued my interest. In the end I got a single of the salted caramel and malted vanilla with peanut brittle. The staff will ask if you want them to pair samples for you too, which follows my ice cream eating philosophy of having more than one flavor in the same bowl (again, don't judge). The honey lavender surprised me but I knew it would end up being too sweet after a couple of bites. Salted caramel was my favorite although the malted vanilla was good too, except I didn't get a strong malt flavor/sensation. Ideally I wanted to try all the flavors but I didn't want to be THAT person. The boyfriend got ricanelas (snickerdoodle with cinnamon swirl) and brown sugar. Even though it was cold, I really liked the flavors of my picks and the smooth creamy consistency that made me feel like the gourmet hipster ice cream is on point with the hype.

Hands down the best ice cream I've ever had. To make the wait worth it, try as many flavors as you can before pissing off the employees. ÊThat way, you can really get a sense for how ridiculously good every flavor is. ÊI went with the salted caramel and ricanelas. I may or may not go back and buy a pint today.

The ice cream was pretty good. ÊI got the olive oil flavor but I couldn't really taste the olive oil. ÊI also had some of the salted caramel which was very strong and flavorful. The staff was really nice and I felt comfortable. The only major drawback is the line. ÊI was there on a fairly cool night, not a typical ice cream kind of night, and the line was still pretty long.

AHHH Bi-Rite, how I adore your friendly employees and straus creams. Mitchell's can suck it! Êthey really cater to everyone! ÊMy all time favorite is the chocolate coconut, made with coconut milk.

I honestly don't understand why one afternoon there can be no line and another one around the corner. I've been to this place twice, the first time I tried the salted caramel, I gotta admit, it was pretty good! I mean, I wouldn't scream out that it was amazing but it was satisfying. The second time I tried it, I had the brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl and the balsamic strawberry. The strawberry was really good, the brown sugar just tasted like liquid sugar with an occasional "oh, there's the ginger!". I didn't really like the honey lavender, it tasted like I was eating soap, had plenty of that as a kid. No thanks. Tried to come a third time but for some reason the line was extremely long! Probably because it was a weekend. If anything, I'll come back on a weekday around noon.

I really LOVE the strange exotic flavors that they offer in this shop. I believe I may have gotten the ice cream called Honey Lavender and the Salted Caramel. Like Mitchells, this ice cream shop also offers a wide variety of flavors, although in terms of originality, I would say that Bi-Right may win this round. Mitchells always seems to carry the same standard flavors with a couple of exceptional new flavors introduced every now and then. Bi-Right has a lot more unique flavors to offer. Now I am not saying I like Bi-Right more than Mitchells because both hold a special place in my heart. The only thing that deters me from coming to this place is that its almost impossible to find parking and that the line is insane. It can extend to about a block (or maybe a little less). But regardless of the line, the workers here are extremely friendly and happy (it amazes me). Do check this place out if you're willing to try new flavors.

So close to 4.5 stars... Found Bi-Rite on a recommendation from the hotel concierge and it did not disappoint. ÊAlthough, as our first experience, we found it odd that SFers were lining up in mid 60-degree weather for a scoop of ice cream. ÊNow we know why! ÊAnother bonus - they were open an hour later than many of the competitors. The flavors are decidedly unique and tasty, yet we learned that the top sellers do run out early in the evening. ÊRather than gush on about the flavors (which can be found in nearly any other review), I'll share some of my likes. ÊPassing a menu down the line = great idea! ÊCrowd-control and line management made the wait shorter than expected, too. ÊSuper friendly servers that know I want to try EVERYTHING, even though I politely decline. ÊNice soft-serve option next door, but that's not why we came... I found some of the flavors to be icy or crystallized, not entirely smooth and creamy. ÊWhile each tasted amazing, the textures were inconsistent and sometimes lacking IMHO. ÊThe sundaes looked awesome, but my first trip is always the purest - why load up the toppings before I know how good the base is? ÊI'm just not sure I'd want to wait in that line again. It's in my ice cream "top 20" now, but I'll need another visit to see if it's really 5 star worthy.

Honey Lavender ice cream... mmm creamy, light, yet flavorful. Their cupcakes however... not up to par. However, it could be because I went in the early evening and I had the lonely ones that were left out till the end of the day. I'll give four stars simply because with all their popularity, they should really invest in some extra seating outside. I love where it's located (I pretty much just love SF) and I am going to go back at an earlier time in the day to get an ice cream/cupcake combo!

Oh muh gawd. I love you. I love everything about you. I even love the line I have to wait in just to eat your icecream. Which by the way is amazing.

I came here before lunch, before dinner and after dinner, and then once again before we went to the airport...in fact, we almost missed our flight because I insisted on one more cup of your amazingness.

Seems like most people always talk about how crowded this place is but I somehow slipped in during a twilight zone empty hour. Got a solid scoop of Ginger Ice Cream. It was pretty damn tasty. The guy working was talking about crystallized ginger candy and I'm like "I formally request to have that as a topping or integrated into the ice cream itself. Now that would be killer." Being in total agreement with me, I think I might have convinced them to make a customer induced suggestion :) 4.5 stars

Walked across the street this weekend after lunch at Delfina Pizzeria. ÊHad 3 scoops: roasted banana, salted caramel and toffee coffee. ÊAll were very good. Ê'Creamery' isn't a misnomer -- the texture was indeed very creamy compared to the more crystalline offerings at Sketch in Berkeley. ÊThe flavour of the salted caramel isn't quite as complex as Sketch's burnt caramel, but the coffee is very similar (except, of course, for the chunks of toffee). ÊRoasted banana was a perfect compliment to the other two scoops. ÊAfter giving it some consideration, I'm partial to the style at Sketch -- more ice, less cream -- but Berkeley is a long way from Tartine & Delfina! update: Êhad a sundae with brown butter pecan & roasted banana. Ê banana definitely tops here -- butter pecan wasn't 'brown' enough. ÊThe honey lavender is great too.

I am the dessert orderer---you know the one everyone at the table looks at when the server asks if you saved room for dessert (I KNOW you biatches want it too, just using my obsession as an excuse!) Let's keep it simple: ice cream = 5 stars! (lavender?--mmmm, crushed almonds w/ fresh cherries?---delicious!, salted caramel?--get the f*ck outta here, chai-spiced milk cholcolate?--every time!) service = 4 stars, pretty cool about letting folks try flavors, though that Mission-y cool attitude prevails) set-up & wait = 3 stars----totally agree w/ the idea about the numbers, having to post up in line is sucky! also, it's ALWAYS out the door and it's usually pretty foggy/cold outside (ok, remind me again, I'm shivering int he cold to buy a frozen treat???) overall....I do CRAVE this place, and would go much more often if it wasn't such a craptacular pain in the ass (parking...waiting...shivering)

My friends and I ventured here on Saturday afternoon after enjoying lunch at Zuni Cafe and miraculously found a parking space down the street without having to drive around endlessly. To top it off, it was a perfect day for ice cream as the sun was shining and a slight breeze made sitting outside a treat. Never having been here prior to this experience, I was happy to see there was almost no line as only four (4) people stood between me and the ice cream. I expected gobs of people as other reviewers mentioned but we got lucky I suppose. As you wait in line, there are one of many temptations swaying you from actually getting to the ice cream like the chocolate cake and other assorted goodies sitting on the shelf just left of the counter. I was almost lead astray but kept to my objective as I only wanted one thing... samples of every ice cream flavor available. Samples of strawberry balsamic, salty caramel, honey lavender, and roasted banana were tried. We decided not to be greedy plus we didn't want to hold up the line. Everything was amazing and creamy!!! Everyone a hit in my opinion but I needed to decide on one scoop. I could have gone for a four scoop but resisted the notion. My order ended up being a scoop of honey lavender in a sugar cone all for $2.95. Pure heaven in my book. I like how they have compostable cups and spoons if you are carb-phobic. They also have benches outside for those days when you want to make people jealous of your cold and delicious handheld treat.

I have had a series of trips with friends to bi rite to enjoy their ice cream. It is a real treat to have such unique flavors and great ingredients, Strauss cream dominates all dairy. The salted caramel is always the first for anyone new and afterwords you can go for more avaunt Gard flavors such as balsamic strawberry. Mexican chocolate is very good, not to spicy but enough to clear your nose. The Snikerdoodle flavor is ballen. its like some took millions of snicker doodles Êand compacted them, froze them, and offered it on a cone. go to bi rite for something good. If anyone is a Mitchell's Fan, Êperfect. But that doesn't mean you cant enjoy good ice cream. Don't compare, just sample.

I actually do not understand why this place isn't rated 5 stars! This place offers very dynamic flavors and that is why their flavors are superb! They only have about 8-10 flavors but they have mastered and perfected each one. I chose salty caramel and cookies n cream, a single scoop of each but my taste buds were longing for more when I finished. They also bake! I have not tried it but tasting their ice cream, I'm pretty sure that their baked goods are the "BOMMBDIGITTY~" I live on the east bay side and I would drive an hour to get more of this Bi-Rite ice cream!

Yes, I want to wait a half an hour in line for Bi-Rite; yes, this ice cream is beyond worth the wait to me; and yes, I want to add another review to the kajillion others.... A sunny day at Dolores Park doesn't have a better complement than Bi-Rite ice cream (and maybe some friends to share it with). I love the inventive flavors, and the business's commitment to the community and all the other jazz that has already been said within the sea of Bi-Rite reviews.... So, I suggest not reading through them all. Just go try the Creamery for yourself, you won't regret it.

Lot of Interesting Flavors to Choose. Salted Caramel is a Classical Masterpiece. ÊMost of the flavors I tested were good. Roasted Banana was not my cup of tea. On my 2nd visit, I got the new Magnolia Coffee Porter flavor on top of Salted Caramel. I could definitely taste the beer on Coffee Porter. The Coffee was more subtle. It's light and refreshing like a Lager. ÊColor was more blonde than brown. But nonetheless a good flavor that isn't too sweet. It's a good contrast to the sweeter and rich Salted Caramel. Get your Ice cream cone and then walk across to Mission Dolores Park to enjoy a majestic view of the City. Smaller Portions but worth the Price.

I wasn't sure if it'd be worth the hype, but now that I have been I can say it really was awesome. The brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl is amazing. I had it along with the also wonderful coffee toffee and honey lavendar in a bowl. Extremely tasty! The salted caramel ice cream is also wonderful. It is quite thick and very, very richly flavoured. The mint chip is extremely tasty, but BEWARE! It is *peppermint* with chocolate chips, not regular mint with chocolate chips.

Your first indication that this place may be good is the long line that always wraps around the corner but by no means let this deter you from enjoying one of the best scoops of ice cream you'll have in San Francisco. The creamy quality deliciousness that is Bri-rite is everyone's quilty pleasure at its best. The flavors are orignal, organic and home spun and savory to the taste buds! The sundaes are a trademark with their homemade cookies and hot fudge sprinkled on the top.

The BEST ice cream I have had...so far. I haven't tried the other highly rated places yet but they're on my list!!! My favorites are Salted Caramel and Coffee Toffee. Coffee ice cream will never be the same for me again (just like my experience after I had a cup of Blue Bottle coffee). Balsamic Strawberry is always a winner. Despite the use of the word "balsamic" there is nothing sour about it. It actually helps bring out the flavor of the strawberries and is very true in taste (unlike strawberry-flavored candy). For vegans, I have seen a Chocolate Coconut flavor. I have never waited in line for ice cream. You should though if you're not in a rush because it is well worth it. **Tip: if you're not interested in any of the exotic flavors of the week/day, they do have a couple standard flavors pre-packed in pints in a freezer. You could just grab one of those without waiting in line. If I remember correctly, some of these flavors were Balsamic Strawberry, Mint Chip, Snickerdoodle and Chocolate. Their sundaes looked enormous and I will make sure I leave enough room in my stomach next time for those.

Best Ice Cream In The Bay. ÊPeriod. Although it may not look like much, Bi-Rite Creamery serves top quality ice cream. ÊThey make the ice cream themselves on site with organic and locally grown foods. ÊThey also have a bunch of seasonal flavors which change during the year. ÊTheir flavors are also unique and quite delicious. ÊI suggest going here with a bunch of friends, have everyone order a different flavor, and share! ÊBut be warned, you may go back for seconds, thirds, fourths.... The price is extremely reasonable for ice cream this good. ÊAlthough there isn't much room to sit inside or outside, don't let that bother you. ÊStand up and eat good ice cream, don't be a princess. I also do suggest trying their sundaes. ÊAlthough the ingredients may seem foreign and strange, try them, they put them up there for a reason. ÊThey taste DELICIOUS! Whenever you're up in the bay, after dinner, and still have a sweet tooth, GO HERE. ÊBut be warned, the line on a weekend usually goes around the block, but it does go by quickly. ÊBring a jacket.

Of course the salted caramel was great (just like the last time). The Coffee Toffee had a bold rich coffee flavor. The brown sugar with Ginger swirls was my favorite new flavor. ÊThe Orange Cardamom was a refreshing great combo of flavors. It's not cheap ($3.25 for two small scoops) but the quality of the ice cream and distinctive flavors are worth it.

After the first day I visited (once before and once after dinner!) I had to go back. ÊI hit B-Rite twice more while I was in town, each time trying something different. ÊEverything is so good! My choices on each visit: 1) Kiwi banana sorbet (vegan) - delicious. And very creamy for a sorbet. 2) salted caramel and coffee toffee - salted caramel was tasty, but the coffee toffe was even better! 3) brown sugar w/ ginger caramel and ricanelas - both were phenomenal, but ricanelas was the winner. I love me some snickerdoodles! 4) ginger and cookies n cream - cookies n cream was the winner hands down. it wasn't even close. ginger was the only flavor i didn't absolutely love - it was just too flowery for me. Every time I went, the staff were awesome. ÊVery efficient, but also very friendly and helpful. ÊKept the line moving w/o rushing people thorough the selection process. ÊAwesome! http://www.flickr.com/phÉ

Places like the Bi-Rite Creamery are why I will never leave the Bay Area. ÊI came here a gazillion years ago from Texas, and I am still shaking my head at how the Bay Area can generate so many occasions of such deliciousness, over and over again. ÊIf there's a bad ice cream place in the Bay Area, I haven't found it. ÊAnd there are plenty of great standouts, like Ici, Three Twins, and Humphry Slocombe -- but Bi-Rite Creamery is just out of this world. ÊThe salted caramel ice cream is one of the best things I've ever eaten, and I have taken out-of-towners to get it half a dozen times. Ê How do they do it? Ê I hope one day to get my salted caramel craving under control so I can do justice to all the other wonderful stuff they have. And now I hear they have Soft-Serve and that it's fabulous. ÊTime to haul back into the city -- this can't wait.

With 2600+ reviews, there is not much more that can be said. But I will anyways.... Parking is a pain Ice Cream is good (Salted Caramel is Fantastic, Honey lavender was good, Brown Sugar and Ginger could use more ginger) The price was about right for SF. There was a line, but it did move quickly (quicker than finding parking). The staff was easy on the eyes and happy to help. The ice cream could have been kept colder so it didn't melt so fast, but it was a hot day in the city.

The appeal of the funky flavors or of the combinations of 2-3 different flavors, quickly wears off once you get the bill and once you taste it. The bill is memorable, the taste is a-ok and not memorable. Perhaps they should experiment with a greater proportion of whole milk to cream, and/or make it less fatty - and more memorable!

Who knew that salty caramel could rock my world in such a way? Well it did and I'll never be the same. If all men could figure this out perhaps there wouldn't be so many sexually unsatisfied women and the world would be a happier place? Or maybe if a guy can't figure it out he should just buy his lady some salty caramel soft serve from Bi-Rite! Went to Bi-Rite with my friend Crystal for some after shopping sweets and it was so worth it! I had heard about Bi-Rite so many times from friends and when I saw the line that extended around the block I knew that this had to be good as legend had fortold. My friend had to get back for another meeting so instead of standing in the very long ice cream line, we stood in the shorter soft serve line. I'd much rather have ice cream than soft serve but I was willing to suck it up as we were short on time. To my delight their twist soft serve of the day was chocolate and salty caramel. We ordered two giant cones and began licking our hearts away as we walked back to catch the BART. I've tasted happiness but this was a different level. I'm so glad I got a twisted cone because it was so fun licking back and forth between the two flavors. We walked through the Mission, looked at the locals walking their dogs and kids and I thought, "It just doesn't get any better than this!" I'll be back for more Bi-Rite and am now a huge fan of their phenomal salty caramel.

Although we were not hungry at all, we went to split a couple of scoops of ice cream down the street at Bi-Rite Creamery. Again, another line down the street. We waited and got a scoop of their salted caramel, and a scoop of their toffee coffee. Both were super yummy. The salted caramel was a little too sweet for me, but the salt was delicious in it, and the toffee coffee was two of my favorite things put together in an ice cream. Even though I was super full, I definitely stuffed that whole thing in my tummy and it was very very very very good. They allow you to get a cone with 2 scoops in it. You can choose both of the same type of ice cream, or 2 different flavors, but be careful because they are very prone to falling off the top. We witnessed an entire scoop falling off the top inside the store, before the guy even paid. Luckily for him they are very kind and replaced the scoop no problem :)

I came in on a Sunday & got myself a sundae. ÊResult: Êbest sundae and Sunday OF ALL TIME! After contemplating the various flavors, I set my sights on the sundae selection. ÊBecause the only thing better than ice cream is ice cream with additional tasty things piled on top. Ê In the end, I went with the Afternoon Snack, which is composed of roasted banana ice cream, graham cracker crumbs, caramel sauce, and a dollop of whipped cream. ÊNormally, I'm not a huge fan of graham crackers or caramel, but since Bi-rite makes all of their toppings in-house, nothing was the bland, standard-issue fare of your average popsicle stand. ÊStrangely, both the crumbles and the sauce possessed a slight burnt flavor, which kept the sweetness from being too overwhelming. HOWEVER Minus one star for the fat content and lengthy lines. (But maybe if you waste away in line for long enough, the indulgence would be warranted)

The texture of their ice cream is so unique! It's super soft and creamy. And the salted caramel lives up to all the hype!!! Definitely a must get! I also had the honey lavender. After the salted caramel, it just seemed bland, but up til then, I enjoyed it. For those scared of floral ice creams and have visions of eating floral sachets, don't be afraid to try it! I've seen a couple of references to Ici in the East Bay, so just my own little observations: 1) Bi-Rite is smooth and creamy, almost like softserve, whereas Ici has the more traditional ice cream texture, more solid. 2) the flavors at Ici are more intense, have more bite...however you want to phrase it. For example, I've had a lavendar combo flavor at Ici before and it was just like smelling a jar of lavendar salts. Intense! Whereas the honey lavendar at Bi-Rite was subtle and more easy on the palate. Both places are great, I personally prefer Bi-Rite though.

If you want the best ice cream in SF, Bi-Rite is it. Only a few flavors, which is great because with a line nearly a block long, you don't want people wasting time picking from a huge menu, especially since there are no wrong choices. The texture of this ice cream is perfectly smooth and creamy. Every flavor I've tried is tasty, though the balsamic strawberry could use more balsamic. Yummier than Mitchells and cheaper than Humphry Slocombe, not to mention nicer staff.

Ok, Bi-Rite, (btw - am I the only one that thinks of Rite-Aid, every time I say, Bi-Rite?) really small place, which explains the long line. ÊAlso, limited seating inside, but a few benches along the sidewalk. ÊThe creamer-istas' were great! Ê There were 3 people taking orders that night: 1. A white woman that had so much green eye liner and other make-up around her eyes, it would make Lady GaGa proud! ÊShe was awesome; allowed us to taste almost all the flavors! 2. A Hispanic man, let's call him, Consuelo; short, clean cut, no visible tattoos. ÊEfficient. 3. A short Asian woman (aren't they all? Haha..jk), she was also great; nose pierced, spaghetti strap tank top, and black wavy hair. ÊThe slutty look. Ê"Weren't you both just here??" she asked...but we'll get to that in a sec. Now to the ice cream: Salted Caramel & Honey Lavender - not my style. ÊIn fairness, I think it's an acquired taste; if I was forced to eat it, I'd probably end up loving it. Coffee Toffee - I love to drink coffee, not eat it. Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle - Good but not great. Chocolate (not the vegan) - Fantastic; I dare say better than, Haagen Dazs. Brown Sugar w/Ginger Caramel - I LOVE ME SOME BROOOWN SUGAAA! Ê Overall: They use actual metal-spoons to sample the ice cream & are generous in their sampling portions. ÊI didn't get any of the sundaes or extra toppings on my ice cream. ÊIf you need more sugared toppings to make your ice cream taste better, how good was it to begin with? Ê Got 2 scoops, Malted Vanilla & my Broooown Sugaa! ÊWe loved our selections so much we went back (yes, got back in line, cause that's just how we role, son!!) for more! ÊGot another 2 scoops with Salty Caramel & more of my Broooown Sugaa! ÊThe asian woman behind the counter recognized us; was probably intrigued by my infatuation for their Brooown Sugaa! ÊGreat place and more important, awesome ice cream!! Ê Afterwards, I had this urge to listen to Beyonce and watch a movie starring Halle Berry. ÊHhhhmmm.....

My dad described it best... "It isn't bad, but it isn't what I'd call good either. It's novel." Yelp's description for three stars is perfect: "A-OK." After dinner with my parents, I suggested we stop at Bi-Rite. My mom is an ice cream fanatic, and after passing Bi-Rite on the bus and then reading about it on Yelp, I was determined to try their ice cream for myself. A group of five was in front of us, but things moved quickly and I appreciated that the friendly woman behind the counter let us try samples while they were making up their minds. The ice cream is extremely rich and sweet. I rarely complain about food being too rich, but I agreed with my parents - this ice cream was heavy, sugary and rich. I believe this is the first time in my life that I couldn't finish even half of my ice cream - and I got a small. I definitely do not recommend stopping at Bi-Rite after a satisfying meal. Like me, you'll probably have to toss half and then feel like a wasteful big spender. We ordered three smalls. My mom got Brown Butter Pecan and Ricanelas (cinnamon and snickerdoodles). She let me try a bite of the ricanelas... It was "just ok," in my opinion, although she said it was "pretty good, but too rich." It tasted slightly like hazelnut, which I hate, and the snickerdoodle bits were really flat and floury - I don't think they started out as very delicious cookies and I'm pretty sure they were stale when they were thrown in the ice cream. (I used to work at a bakery that turned all of their stale goods into nasty "fruit bars" and I can definitely recognize stale bits of cookie mixed into other things.) I tried the famous Salted Caramel and I thought it was pretty good, so I ordered a small half- Salted Caramel, half- Coffee Toffee. I assumed I'd enjoy the Coffee Toffee, because those are two of my favorite things. I was right - it was delicious, but too rich. I ate more of it than the Salted Caramel, but I was nowhere near finishing the scoop. The Salted Caramel was delicious, for the first four bites. Then it was too intense to finish. If I were to order it again, I would probably order a scoop of vanilla with it, to mellow out the palate. The few bites I was able to finish were mostly mixed with the Coffee Toffee. My poor dad had to wait in the car and he asked for sherbet. The helpful counterwoman told us the sorbet of the day was Banana Kiwi. I told my mom that Banana Kiwi is too exotic for my dad, but she ordered it anyways. I was right - he took one bite and said thanks, but no thanks. I sampled it - it was much lighter than the ice cream and the kiwi flavor was nice, but I don't really like banana flavor anywhere except in bananas. The bottom line? Bi-Rite isn't the be-all, end-all of ice cream. It's a helluva lot better than Dreyers or store-brands, but if the choice were between Bi-Rite and Haagen Dazs, I'd choose the latter. If you're looking for truly delicious homemade ice cream, make your own. That said, I love Bi-Rite's organic ingredients and environmentally-friendly attitude. ÊI will almost definitely make a point to try it again.

OMG! ÊHow awesome is this place!? ÊThe Salted Caramel is everything and then some. ÊI about a pint to go as well and already finished it... This is about as close to addicting as you can get. The best time to go is just after 3pm when the line isn't too long. ÊThe first time I was here, I just stood there sampling all the flavors. ÊRicanelas, Earl Grey, and the Roasted Banana are also my other favs if I don't get the Salted Caramel. ÊI also had Sam's Sundae before (chocolate ice cream with bergamot olive oil, maldon sea salt and whipped cream) only because I had no idea how sea salt and olive oil would work, but it does somehow.

This place had a huge line and I was told they have amazing flavors. ÊThree of us went to try it for the first time and each of us chose different flavors then sampled each others. ÊThe quality of the ice cream is great, so I can see the appeal. ÊThe flavor options though were a little too weird for all of us. ÊThe scoops are smaller in size, but then again their flavors are so power packed that a little bit goes a long way. Ê We prefer Mitchell's, but this place is worth checking out at least once.

*Review is for Sam's Sundae* 7 STARS Was being an old lady as always and was watching Food Network's "The Best Thing I Ever Ate". ÊAnytime they have bay area "good eats" - I'm down to try it out and Sam's Sundae from Bi-Rite was on there. It was a little over OK but, not oh my god, to die for typa sh*t. ÊIt's some super rich chocolate ice cream drizzled in the not the average olive oil, with sea salt and a whop of cream on the side. ÊAll the flavors together were good but not the bomb - sorry. ÊAgain, 7 Stars! All the flavors together almost tasted like a cinnamon pistachio chocolate explosion but not that awesome fantastic journey to the motherland that I was hoping for. I'm up to try the other flavors though, those looked potentially more yummy!

Got an ice cream cake for my birthday. ÊDee-licious!!! Website gives you all the info you need on ordering, then you call in and order. ÊVery simple, pick an ice cream, pick a base, pick a frosting. ÊPricing is reasonable - ~$33 for a cake that fed 8 people (with leftovers). ÊPickup was easy (although I double parked, and have now accrued bad parking karma that will probably take a lifetime to expiate)...I even had a nice little chat with the guy at the front counter about how awesome his job is (he GIVES PEOPLE ICE CREAM for a living!?! Êdoes it get any better?). Ê My only, qualified, suggestion for improvement would be that the people on the other end of the line give you some suggestions for ordering ice cream cake. ÊMine ended up being kind of a vanilla overload (yes, it is possible) and I sorta wish someone had pointed that out to me. ÊThen again, I didn't ask, and I'm sure some people love vanilla so much they want to inject it straight into their veins. ÊWhen you work in ice cream, you learn these kinds of things, I suppose....I think what would be nice is if the website had some suggested combinations. ÊThat would make a standout truly superlative. ÊStill love ya, Bi-Rite.

now i know why this place has 3000+ reviews. this is definitely as good as yelpers have hyped it up!! after having tried so many good ice cream places all over new york, berkeley, bay area, this place definitely trumps everywhere. the ice cream is so creamy and the flavors definitely hit the spot. the line was super long even when it's 30 minute before closing, so expect to wait for a while. I tried the salted caramel, which is the recommended and it was amazing!! the coffee toffee was equally as good. i definitely wish i can try others. i think overall, all of the flavors are really good, so whatever you get, you won't be disappointed. they also sell in pints and quarts if you would like to have more!

Even though I'm often lactose intolerant, I really love ice cream, and I really love Bi-Rite! ÊI know everyone talks about the salted caramel, and it's a really GREAT flavor, but it's not my favorite. ÊI love the whole salty-sweet combination, but it's just bit much for me. ÊI can only eat about half a scoop without thinking that it's too rich for me. ÊI personally prefer the Ricanelas, which is cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodle pieces in it! ÊIt's tastes light and not super sweet, and the cinnamon in the ice cream and the cookies just makes it awesome. ÊI also love the malted vanilla, cookies and cream, and mint chocolate chip (which DOES NOT have that fake, bright green color you get in most mint chocolate chip ice creams). ÊI've also heard great things about the sundaes, especially the one with the olive oil on it, and I'll probably try that sometime soon! ÊThat, and the frozen yogurt next door too! Go to Bi-Rite... it's awesome!

long line sometimes for ice cream, but its really worth it for the unique tast of combinations of ingredients that they use.

As much as I enjoy ice cream, I can rarely finish a single scoop on my own. So when I happily licked up the last spoonful of my 2 scoops from Bi-Rite, I understood exactly why the lines are always out the door and down the street for this place. The line actually moves pretty quickly, and though I started on the corner of Dolores & 18th, I had the ice cream in my hands in less than 10 minutes. I'd remembered reviews raving about the honey lavender, so I asked to taste this and their famous salted caramel and liked both so much that I went with a scoop of each, even though I got into the line intending to get just one. 2 or 3 blocks later and halfway through my ice cream, though, I realized that I'd been given coffee toffee instead of salted caramel! Still good, but of course I was disappointed! Will definitely be back for that scoop :)

I'm always impressed by the creative and delicious flavors Bi-Rite comes up with! Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl! Delicious! The servers are friendly and extremely patient, especially when I ask to try almost every flavor they have. I also like that they have indoor and outdoor seating.

friend-"You wanna try Bi-Rite?" me- I shake my head in confusion "No, No, I've gotten that out of my system early on in my path of sexual discovery. " Then i start in on my feelings on bisexuality. Ê "Bisexuality is for 16 year old teenagers who aren't quite sure what they want. ÊIts a way for them to ease into being gay. ÊIts a stop on the way to gay-ville. ÊIts a detour on the way to homo-town. ÊGet it straight, get it crooked, just get it. Ê!Okay!" Ê*in my chola accent* Bi-Rite did me right in all the right places. ÊThe ice cream flavors were delicious and executed perfectly. ÊThe crowds of people are proof enough as to why its so popular. ÊI don't think they need more reviews but I'll say my piece. The flavors I got to try were the salted caramel and honey lavender and creme fraiche and balsamic strawberry. I have heard about the hype of the salted caramel, let others be warned. ÊIts not for everyone. ÊI felt it was a little one-noted to me, just a bit bitter and salty. ÊHowever, I enjoyed the other flavors immensely. ÊThe honey lavender was probably my favorite of the 4. I wished they had a few more exciting flavors. ÊI felt like they had the equation and they knew how to do it and didn't deviate from it. ÊThey do solid flavors and do them right. ÊBut where's the attitude? Where's the razzle dazzle? The texture was a notch above most ice cream stores. ÊThere always seems to be a texture issue at some ice cream places that I have beef with. ÊThis was ice cream done right. ÊIt held its shape, it didn't melt lightening fast even though it was hotter than Hades outside, and it didn't have a gummy texture like some places. ÊIt had the perfect creamy consistency without being overly so. ÊThe texture is almost like thick icing but cold. I'm giving them a gold 5 stars because they did it right. ÊGo, Go now, and bring me back some!

VEGAN ICE CREAM! ÊY'ALL BITCHES BESTA RECOGNIZE!!! This place is so fucking good that i ate here twice today. Êi got one scoop and ate it on my walk home, got home, took off my pants (don't ask), was like, "fuck it. Êi've had a long, hard week of overindulging in food and drink to the point of adult onset diabetes so clearly mama deserves a TREAT!" and then got right back on the road again. Êi wanted this shit so badly that i walked all the way down the hill on Church st. (okay??) in the rain without an umbrella (it's not that i don't have an umbrella. Êi have many, in fact. Êit's just that i am hard core, you see. ÊUMBRELLAS ARE FOR WEAK LITTLE GIRLS!!!). ÊAnyway, I get there and the Bi-Rite dude is all, "what's up, vegan girl!" Êand i'm like, "you know how we do! Êholla!" Êand then he's basically like, "for real?" and i'm like, "FOR REAL." all dead serious with the look of the kill in my eyes. ÊI get my second scoop of the day. Êand also a soda pop. Êand perhaps also a third scoop whatever fuck you laura is the boss of laura and if laura wants three scoops of ass sticking soy cream and wants to cry on the scale at weigh in tomorrow morning then that's what laura wants. ÊI AM ONLY SO STRONG, PEOPLE!!! Ê Anyway, after three scoops of ice cream, I head back up the hill on Church street. ÊNow, for folks who aren't familiar with this peak...let me paint you a picture. ÊIt's called, Everest. ÊLook it up and then imagine a beast ten times worse and covered in the stench of dog and human piss and also, men to your left having sex in the bushes off of Dolores Park (hot!). ÊDo you know what it's like to hike back up that cliff with nothing to shield you from the harsh winter elements? ÊI was like the motherfucking kids in Alive, setting up base camp and then threatening to cut and/or eat fellow pedestrians. ÊI am lucky to be here today. ÊThank GOD I have the extra seven layers of fatty protective coating. ÊI was smart to carbo load at Bi-Rite before scaling that thing. ÊCan you imagine a Yelp site without me? ÊYou're like, "Yes bitch, leave" and I'm all, "Hey buddy, fuck you! ÊDidn't you read the part where I said I'm the boss of laura?!? ÊBitches, please."

Again, I rate this place 3 stars just to alleviate any of the haterade messages I may get for actually giving this place the rating I'd LIKE to dish out. I also completely realise that, by now, the ninehundredth review for this place means so very little. BiRC Ê(somehow) garnered features in magazines left and right, tv shows, and the hype continues to live on, much like James Cameron's epic feature from 1997. I don't *care* if there are lines out the door on any given warm weekend in SF. I don't *care* that celebrity XXXX *adores* your ice cream (wait, i don't even know that to be true.) On a weekday evening, we show up.. at about 10 min shy of closing. The manager (?) is literally SHOVING the door closed, trying to make SURE that no one ELSE makes it through the doors so that they serve not ONE more scoop of ice cream after the clock ticks 10. It's a birthday, so we're in the mood to share a banana split, which sounds just perfect. We request the icecreamista, "is it ok? can we order a banana split? we know you are closing soon", and HE FRICKIN rolls his eyes at us and obliges. Hang on. it gets better. We realise that the banana split states that the ice cream is "vanilla", but we're feeling mocha-y at the moment, so we tell him. Hm. SEEING AS HE HAS ALREADY started scooping the vanilla, he PROCEEDS TO SCOOP The vanilla ice cream INTO the bowl, and then scoop 1/4 of a scoop of the flavor we actually ASKED for. During all of this, of course, manager-man is YELLING at the door person to close/lock/whatever the doors so that no one else attempt to give him precious american greenbacks for his ice cream. Y'know what? I'd soooo rather go elsewhere for ice cream if I have to deal with that kind of crap. Hell, if it weren't a birthday I'd have just gone to Safeway. Any business owner who has SO VERY little gratitude for his customers has no business taking MY money, I'll say that much. Reminder to the owners: The Neighborhood made you what you are, and the 'holier than thou' attitude that you seem to hold towards your customers can quickly snap back at you and take away all the hype that you have created for yourselves. **** And yes, I have been here more then just this one time, but this particular occasion just put the cherry on the proverbial sundae top. WAIT A FRICKIN SEC... I realise.. I just paid almost $7 for a sundae... and it did not even HAVE a cherry on top! What the hells. Get thee INSTEAD to: Scoops in LA... OMG yum... sooo good.... Joe's Ice cream on Geary (my absolute SF fave) Bombay Ice Creamery right down the street on Valencia Ici in Bezerkeley (holy hotness while you're waiting in line, just ask Elin ÊF.) Oh, and for the record: THIS is what a REAL banana split should look like. http://imagecache2.allpoÉ For a little under $7, we got 1.25 scoops of ice cream and i would venture to say, 1/4 of a banana. WTH!

We're major ice cream fanatics and this place may have the best ice cream we've ever tried. It is incredibly delicious -- creamy, intensely flavorful and never any touch of freezer burn. They have traditional and more outlandish flavors -- they are all absolutely delicious. The line can be very long and since we couldn't wait, we went around the line and went straight into cooler to pick up some to-go pints and an ice cream sandwich. You can't go wrong with any of the flavors. A must place to visit in San Francisco.

After noticing the opening of Bi-Rite's new sidewalk bakery that operates next to their ice cream store, I decided to swing by to have a closer look into their display case which was filled with cookies and cupcakes along with an impressive listing of soft serve ice cream posted on the wall. After catching myself staring at these gorgeous looking cupcakes for way too long, I decided to bring a White Chocolate Cupcake ($2.50), Picnic Cupcake ($2.50), and Salted Caramel Cupcake ($2.50) to share with my good friend and fellow Yelper Angella S. The White Chocolate Cupcake was my favorite as the dark chocolate cake had good moisture when layered with sweet white chocolate butter cream and a coat of dark chocolate glaze. The Picnic Cupcake was very rich and bolstered with lots of pecan and chocolate chips with chocolate fudge frosting to cover a dark chocolate cake deliciously mixed with sour cream. The Salted Caramel was Angella's favorite as the yellow cake was airy and a tad dry that depended on salted caramel filling at the center to give a definitive taste while the vanilla butter cream on top was a delectable add on. Overall, prices were decent for these cupcakes when compared to those at similar boutiques. With the exception of Salted Caramel Cupcake, the other two shared the common thread of rich taste, solid moisture, and full body finish. The ones with sweet fillings inside were particularly enjoyable and added a nice touch of moisture of which was distinguishable instead of repetitive from the creamy frostings. Service was quick, friendly, and knowledgeable. These were not the best cupcakes I've had but it was good to see the ways in which Bi-Rite has continued to expand upon their repertoire by introducing new products while maintaining their edge in defining what good ice cream is all about.

Gosh, how this place has grown! Still a Brown Butter Pecan girl for life, but another love has also entered my life. It's name is Soft Serve, available at the cute little window, just past the queue for the ice cream area. So far, have had the malted vanilla, chocolate, mexican chocolate, and salted caramel flavors. The texture is just perfect, and the intensity of the flavors really shines. Talk about taking the typical swirl to the next level! Ice cream, make way for your cousin Soft Serve because she's got it goin on!

Thanks to tremendous peer pressure, I finally was able to make it up to the counter and get ice cream. I got a scoop of ginger and a scoop of the salted caramel. It was delicious and worth the (short) wait in line.

Vegan coconut chocolate ice cream?! Good thing I don't live in the Mission or have a million dollars or else I would stop by every day. It's very good but since it's home made and everything, it can be a tad expensive for the little scoop you get. I think I rather buy a pint of soy ice cream at the market for $6 and put my own toppings on it and it can feed a few of my friends too.

Ever since I discovered this place, thanks to my co-worker, I love it! Despite the long lines and limited parking spaces, it never deter us from stopping by this place to grab a treat when we are in the area. Salted caramel is a must try. But after a while, I don't get the same satisfaction I got when I first had it, so I moved on to trying other flavors. ÊThe malted vanilla with peanut brittle is now my favorite. ÊI'm not too adventurous and like to stick with ones I already know taste good. So it'll probably be a while before I will try another flavor. ÊEspecially when there is a long time, I feel obliged to make a quick decision instead of spending time trying different flavors. Recently, I've noticed that your scoop size varies depending on the server you get. Some will give you an oversized scoop, which definitely worth my money, yet there are other times you get just barely a full scoop..otherwise, I still love this place! :)

After seeing Bi-Rite featured on Food Network's "The best thing I ever ate: Sugar Rush" and voted for one of the best ice cream places in San Francisco.. I had to come!!! I also had to try Sam's sundae: 2 scoop of chocolate ice cream drizzled in organic bergamot olive oil and maldon sea salt w/ side of homemade whipped cream Êwhich was pretty good, they didn't drizzle enough olive oil but overall 5/5. (featured on food network) My friend got the coffee sundae:coffee toffee ice cream, almond toffee, hot fudge topped w/ homemade whipped cream and marcona almonds Êand he said he loved it! that's if you're into the coffee feeling. Ê5/5 The line is reallly long depending how far you are, for us was about a 20 min waits.. 2/5 but its worth the wait trust me

I am going to review Bi-Rite Creamery without actually stepping foot into the ice-cream parlor and here is my story. We decided to try Bi-Rite Creamery because of the raving reviews on Yelp. ÊWe were driving along 18th Street trying to find the creamery and saw Bi-Rite Market. ÊSilly us thought the creamery was in the market so we drove around the block to find parking. ÊWe went round and round and no parking. ÊFinally we got fed up and stopped the car right across from the market. ÊWe decided to have RF stayed in the car while I went to get the ice-cream. Ê"Be sure to get the salted caramel ice-cream," RF said. ÊI walked through the market and discovered there was a plethora of fresh organic goodies. ÊI went straight to the back of the market thinking there was a ice-cream counter there. ÊTurned out there was no ice-cream counter but there was a really large freezer with cartons of Bi-Rite Creamery Êice-cream. ÊThe pint size looked good so I grabbed the salted caramel pint. ÊA pint of ice-cream was not cheap...$8! ÊI made the purchase, sped out of the store, hopped into the car and drove off in lightening speed into the sunset. ÊOn the way out of the Mission mayhem, we spotted the actual Bi-Rite Creamery. ÊOh crap but oh well. That night we decided to have the salted caramel ice-cream for dessert. ÊI dug the ice-cream scoop into the ice-cream and my goodness it was the most creamy ice-cream I had ever felt. ÊThe taste...was worldly delicious!! The caramel had a deep flavor, it is hard to describe. ÊIt tasted like actual homemade caramel with a hint of burnt sugar and the salt really added to it. ÊThe texture was so creamy and I felt as if I was in caramel heaven. ÊI am addicted. ÊI cannot wait to go back to get some more salted caramel and try their Honey Lavender. ÊBi-Rite Creamery ice-cream is awesome! I am here to announce that Bi-Rite Creamery's Salted Caramel ice-cream is my ice-cream of choice. ÊI am Mabel Y. and I approve this message.

I am a big fan of Bi-Rite, but I'm not a big fan of their line. The wait isn't really because of anything they do wrong, in fact it's more because of what they get right. They always have a ton of very interesting flavors and they will let you try each of them, which is awesome, but that makes for one very long and slow line. Honestly, just forget about it if you've got a hankering on a warm Saturday afternoon. I highly recommend the Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and the Ricanelas. A helpful tip: if the line is too long, just go to their grocery store down the street and split a pint of your favorite flavor (or eat it yourself, which is totally not sad).

Umm, hell yeah. ÊThis place is simply amazing. ÊAll the yelp reviews have been right on. The salted caramel, lavender honey, ginger, cookies and cream, etc...all fabulous. Yes, so I sampled almost every flavor but I have become a bit indecisive and it allowed me to taste all the yummy goodness. ÊI ended up with mint chip.

ice cream at dolores park is an automatic three stars. when that ice cream happens to be the bi-rite ginger ice cream, it warrants the coveted five stars! true to its reputation, bi-rite appears to hit a home run with the creamery. after one lick of their ginger ice cream, i was sold. it is most delicious, and has that strong ginger kick to it. yelpers, if you don't like ginger, this is the ice cream for you, and if you do like ginger, this is the one you have been yearning for. Ê*sigh* Êof course, bi-rite creamery also offers a wide range of other flavors to blow you away. so jaunt over and satisfy your ice cream craving here. then take it to dolores park and get blown all over again, as you savor your ice cream and admire the majestic city view. ahhhh, we live in a very special town. . * all bi-rite ice creams are organic, and the cups and spoons are biodegradable. nice.

Amazing place, if there's one place that I think that's better than Scoops in LA, this is it, and it's no contest, really. Part 1 of 2 of the ice cream tour in SF: Bi Rite One Word to describe Bi Rite: Amazing! Pros: - Honey Lavender (probably my favorite ice cream to date) - Salted Caramel (Awesome) - Brown Butter Pecan (Mmmmmm) - Tried a few other flavors, and they were all really good. If not for the drive back to LA, I'd have bought a few pints back home. Cons: - the wait/line?? (However, it was only about 15mins for us, so it's not too bad) Honestly, Bi Rite is amazing, one of the best, if not THE best ice cream I've had to date. I'd easily wait a hour for this if I have to as the flavors and tastes were amazing. Unlike Humphry Slocombe, Bi Rite actually delivered and I was happy I came here after HS as I didn't care too much for the flavors there. Keep up the great work Bi Rite as it definitely lives up to all of the hype!

Great place to come after eating at Delfina right down the street. ÊTheir scoops are very generous, one scoop is actually two and you can choose two flavors if you want. ÊI always get the coffee toffee whenever I come here. ÊIt tastes like vietnamese dripped coffee in ice cream form. ÊThe line hasn't been too bad whenever I come here, it goes by pretty fast even with people trying flavors. ÊThe only downside is parking can be a little difficult.

As everyone else states, the ice cream is REALLY GOOD and the flavors are unique and fun to try. Very creamy and heavenly. My favorite is balsamic strawberry, although my boyfriend got ricanela which was sooo good, he had to fight me off his ice cream. One star off for the really expensive price. It's a lot of money to pay for one small scoop. But if you don't mind paying a good chunk of money for good ice cream and waiting 20 minutes in line, then definitely come here.

Something happened since I first visited this place a year ago! Last time, we went right in and took our time sampling flavors like toasted coconut, banana, plum sorbet, and coffee toffee. But this time we waited in a line that stretched all the way around the corner, and by the time we reached the counter I couldn't say "1 scoop-chocolate and cookies n cream in a cone, in a bowl" fast enough! Even though I was rushing and the counter was packed, our ice cream-scooper took the time to talk to us, as how we were and carefully pack scoops into my cone. The cookies n cream was amazing, with big chunks of cookie (that must have been home made, because it didn't taste like Oreo) hidden in the cream and was reasonably priced at $3.50....mmm....Bi-Rite is on my permanent list of places to go every time I'm in SF!

OH. MY. GOD. I don't really know why i'm bothering to write a review for this place because i can't really say anything that hasn't already been said. I've had Bi-Rite in my bookmarks for quite some time now, ever since i saw it featured on "The Best Thing I Ever Ate" on the Food Network. My friends and i came on a Friday afternoon before heading over to Dolores park to get shwasted. When we got there, there were only like 4 people in line! :):):) Fuck yeah. I hear all these people talking about how they waited 30+ minutes in line and such and i can't believe we lucked out. I was all set on getting Sam's Sundae, which is chocolate ice cream, bergamot olive oil, sea salt, & whipped cream, but when it came down to my turn and i saw all of the other delicious flavors, i couldn't resist. I had to get the Coffee Toffee ice cream, as well as the Ricanelas (cinnamon w/ snickedoodles), and holyyyy shit. I WISH i got a large. It was so good. The pieces of their homemade toffee and snickerdoodles are what pushed me over the edge. All of the people working were reallly nice and not trying to just rush you along. Oh, and a couple people have mentioned in their reviews how they don't like that they use metal spoons for sampling...it's to help save the environment. Think of how many little plastic spoons Bi-Rite probably goes through in a day. ALOT. It would be such a waste, not to mention harmful on the environment to be so careless with throwing away so much plastic everyday. I'm pretty bummed that i have to wait allll the way until i'm back in SF to come here again. I'm even willing to wait in the long ass line next time if i have to.

bi-rite is luscious, delightful, heavenly even... but ici in berkeley is better. don't agree with me? fine, the cheese stands alone. look, i know bi-rite is fantastic; 2554 of you think so, and i can vouch that it was absolutely dreamy on a hot and sunny saturday at dolores park. i had the balsamic strawberry and the salted caramel and both were really, really good. but my 5 star review goes for ici, which is sheer perfection. ici has the clever and original flavors of bi-rite, but with a creamier texture that this SF spot can't top. if you love the flavors of bi-rite, i guarantee that ici has an even better one. think the salted caramel is good? try ici's rosemary caramel - it's out of this world. like the balsamic strawberry? check out the brandied cherry. bi-rite has earl grey tea, ici has green tea. bi-rite's cones are organic, ici's are organic AND hand-rolled. i'm sure there are plenty of city snobs out there who can't fathom the idea of an east bay venue besting a city site. and yes, bi-rite is bigger, has a more extensive menu, and is certainly more well-known. but trust me; if you really love ice cream, i mean crave-it-in-the-night kind of love, you want to go and taste this. venture to berkeley. try ici. thank me.

Êyou can choose almost any flavor ice cream (except the ones that are too soft and sorbet) to make into a cake and have it with chocolate or vanilla cake, topped off with a chocolate, whip cream, or butter cream topping!

ÊSalted caramel, honey lavender and peanut butter fudge trouble our dreams and beckon hauntingly at any time of the waking day.

So after leaving Humphry Slocombe (see last review), we had to go to Bi-Rite Creamery. I wanted the Salted Caramel, she wanted to try it for the first time. Unanimous decision: the quality and flavor of the ice cream here was far superior to that of Humphry Slocombe. How about that for some instant comparison people? There's a reason why Bi-Rite has a line, and Humphry Slocombe doesn't. *Buuurp* And I'm telling ya, the culinary excellence of the burps that Bi-Rite ice cream yields is unmatched!

Like someone wrote before me, this is more of 3.5 stars. I went with 3 instead of 4 primarily because this place might be overrated a little bit. I finally went there a couple weeks ago after wanting to go there for months. Long line around the corner, sunny and windy day. I got three different flavors and they were yummy. But as I was eating it I kept on thinking about how I don't necessarily need to drive to SF just to get this particular very good ice cream. If I'm nearby and want some good ice cream, I'd absolutely come here again. But will I drive there and deal with parking or Muni?? Ehhhh, not likely.

so we came here on a random weeknight and there was still a line out the door. Êpeople were crouched next door licking their ice cream cone. Êwe thought we found a spot but the mini cooper in front took up too much space. Êhello mini drivers, other people dont drive minis. Êso we had to be quick we saw that if you were picking up a cake or take out pints you could skip the line so i went to the frige and got 4 pints: salted caramel, honey lavendar, coffee toffee, and roasted banana. Êno i did not get to skip the line. Êi think people got mad at me. i heard the market across the st actually sells them too without the lines or ppl getting mad the people behind the counter are super friendly though. Êi heard them telling customers about flavors. Êabout how you can have 3 flavors in 2 scoops. Êwhich really was 3 mini scoops. they also have sundaes like afternoon snack (roasted banana ice cream, graham crackers, caramel) and almond joy. ice cream sandwiches. Êi saw pies in the freezer and ice cream sanwiches there too. my 4 pints came out to $38. Êbut when we got home they were the perfect consistency to scoop. Êall the flavors were really good. Êsimple, not too sweet. Êi was imagining if i was the dessert chef at a restaurant i would want to make ice cream like this. Êimaginative flavors but very simple, pure ingredients for a clean, memorable taste. Ê the case had some other flavors i would like to try. Êbalsamic strawberry.

My friends Jillian and John brought me here (not forcefully by any means) last night after dinner. We had been discussing how I had lost weight last week because I had gotten sick. In an effort to regain the weight that I had lost, Jillian suggested we go have some dessert at Bi-Rite. Approaching the place, there was already a visible line of people outside, about 10-15. Thankfully the line moved pretty quickly as I had already decided what I wanted to try. At the last minute, Jillian asks me "wanna split a sundae?" Normally, I wouldn't be a fan of sundaes, but I said what the hell; sure. We ended up ordering a brownie sundae with 2 scoops of ice cream. One was the balsamic strawberry, and the second was the salted caramel. Never in my life would I have thought that those were a good combination, but I was very surprised! The salted caramel was delicious, a little rich but went really well with the brownie and cinnamon(?) pecans. But then, I took a bit of the strawberry to finish it off...and it was an amazingly refreshing taste that didn't feel heavy at all. So, I've decided to at least come back a couple more times, as a way to not only satisfy my taste buds, but also to add on some extra poundage so my friends don't start calling me anorexic.

There are already so many reviews for this place so I'll keep it short. ÊGet the salted caramel..... but not on a hot day because it melts so quick. ÊLesson learned! Êthe staff is very friendly and always gives me an extra punch in my punchcard! ÊThey sure know chinese people and know they love free stuff! ÊMore expensive than baskin robins and tom and jerry but so much better! Êthis place is a must if you visit sf!

Today I took the afternoon off. On my way to the Bi-Rite market to pick up something for a friend in the neighborhood, I walked by this place. In the past the line has always been out the door and down the block and I've never been able to get ice cream here because of that. Today there was almost nobody. I walked right in and took a look around. It was like seeing a parking place while passing through a busy area and thinking you should grab it just because. I felt I should eat ice cream before lunch today, just because there was no line at Bi-Rite Creamery. 5 stars because it could be a reason to quit my job or take a vacation.

I tried the Salted Caramel, finally. And to my surprise, it was what people said it was.. but just a bit salty for my liking. Though I got it with Vanilla which complemented the taste of the Salted Caramel. I'm not a big fan of Strawberry but their Balsamic Strawberry is fairly good. Their portions are a bit small but that's good enough for me, I rather have that then a huge scoop that will lead me to obesity. One of my professors is vegan and he said he'll check this place out, so good for Bi-Rite for catering to vegans too. I visited during one of the many hot days that San Francisco had recently, and to my surprise.. no long wait. And it's super convenient for those who appreciate nice weather in San Francisco and decide to go to Dolores Park. Parking sucks though.

yummmmmy! im a big chocolate ice cream person... so thats exactly what i got, and it was good as gold! i was very pleased to see they have exotic flavors as well.. i tried the lavender... tasted like someone spilled some bath and body works lotion in my mouth, not my cup of tea ....at all, but it was worth a try. the line was long, but worth it. take your ice cream and have a seat somewhere at the park... the two go hand in hand :)

I don't care if I'm full, or if it's a long line, or even if it's raining outside, because ice cream from here makes me happy. I love lavender flavor anything, and it's the only place I know of that has this delicious honey lavender flavor. I was also into banana milkshakes growing up, so I'll take a scoop of roasted banana on top. Yum

holy femoly, 1615 reviews already! but i have to say, i will gladly add my five stars. BELIEVE THE HYPE, friends! i've been meaning to go here for a long time but never seem to make it to the mission, and i'm glad we were there at a time when the lines were minimal (i can totally imagine them snaking out the door). monday night at 7:30 PM it was only two or three people deep. i would, however, gladly wait in however long a line there was. so yes. it was so good i had to go back in and get another cone. cone 1: salted caramel + honey lavender. cone 2: brown sugar + ricanelas (cinnamon Êwith snickerdoodles) well hot damn. you don't get a big scoop but i like how for the price of a single ($3.25) you can try two flavors (so two smallish scoops). y'all, you MUST get the honey lavender. such a great, refreshing flavor for warm (and cool) summer nights! the salted caramel does not taste salty as the name implies, and the brown sugar and ricanelas were both also good (i got the first scoop of the tub so it was loaded with snickerdoodle pieces -- yum!). there is a very small bar seating area inside, but ample seating on benches outside on the sidewalk. the people behind the counter were very pleasant and you can't help but pick up on the fact that the customers eagerly licking up the creamy goodness (oh my, that sounds gross) there were in a sublime mood. a wonderful, magical place! p.s. umm, there's no official free wifi there but my phone managed to pick up a signal from someone's unsecured router...(because as we all know, at&t is teh suX0rs in the city. major GRR).

I absolutely love the banana ice cream. It is my favorite. It's like a ripe roasted banana in ice cream form. How wonderful is that? The texture is smooth, but not too cold, so you dont get a brain freeze. The downside to this place is that on hot days, the line extends way outside the store, thus for one, exposing you to the blazing sun and two, causes you the frustration of waiting behind 10-15 people to taste every flavor before deciding what to get. Also, I don't like any of the flavors except banana. Haha. So these 4 stars are for the banana flavor! :D It is just that scrumptious.

there will a come a time in your life when global warming will attack earth (notably, san francisco/east bay area) and someone will owe you an apology, and if by chance those two events collide and happen to land on the same day --- consider yourself the luckiest girl in the world! that is, if you're a smart grudge-holding princess who has saved up many days of apologies for one special treat. dig deep in their apologetic sympathy pocket and seek penance in ICE CREAM! if you come on a weekend, you may have to save up for this sweet reward because you may need someone to drive in circles as you wait in line. (weekdays have always been easy for me though). i was not excited about waiting in line, i have waited in that line of tortune known as mitchell's ice cream (100 tickets behind!) but i can say with confidence that even on the hottest weekend day, the line will move fast enough here. the excitement will build up as you are in line, i even made friends with the two girls behind me :). since the store is tiny, make a decision and get out fast. don't be the a-hole in the front of the line holding it up tasting all of the flavors, if you were smart like me and my-newly-made-girlfriends, we tippy-toed when we were about the 5th group in line to check out the flavor inventory of the day so we could order and get out of there. and if you were EXTREMELY smart, you would have ordered every flavor you wanted. because you should. they are all DELICIOUS! to date, this is the best ice cream i've had. i LOVE their ice cream, it's almost like gelato, it's refreshing/light and extremely flavourful. mint choco chip is my favorite ice cream flavor, and bi-rite's version is the best i've ever had. their salted caramel lives up to the hype, as do all of their other unconventional flavors. my favorite is the nectarine sorbet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! take your treats and walk over to delores park for a cute afternoon of ice cream, spf55, and lovelovelove. I LOVE BI RITE! FOREVER!

Good, but not THAT good. It was hyped up a lot, so I was expecting more. The line was pretty long, but it went by fast. I wanted to try all the varieties, but I always feel bad for asking. i tried two flavours & my sister tried 1. I ended up getting the double scoop of roasted banana & balsamic strawberry. the banana was good; anything banana is always good in my book! the strawberry was good, but i did not taste a hint of balsamic. it just tastes like regular strawberry ice cream from haagen daaz (which i think is good!)

It's 10:45 on a Saturday morning - and we will be having ice cream for breakfast... hopefully! I am writing this review now in a shameless attempt to be the first to give a REAL review of the Bi Rite Creamery, which opens in just 15 minutes.... hopefully! You see, for the time being, I have to give this place only minimal star(s) for having promised to open so many times only to disappoint. For instance, a couple of weeks ago, three of us walked some five breathless blocks, up hill and down hill, having heard that the long awaited creamy cousin of the Bi Rite Market had opened just a few days earlier, only to be disappointed yet again. Then, this place was rumored to be opening last weekend, and again we waited in breathless anticipation. What's the hold up? Who knows - just open the doors, already - if this place is even only half as delicious as the Market across the street, it will be a raging success. So, off we go for breakfast and, upon my return, I will give give a "breaking news", "hot off the press" review of ice cream for breakfast! SO... now Êit's 11:45 and we are back and... what can I say? Yes it was open and yes it was fabulous. I pigged out on the seasonal sundae (pumpkin ice cream, gingerbread cake, caramel sauce, candied pumkin seeds, and whipped cream) and the Missus had a single scoop of salted caramel ice cream and a lemon ginger snap cookie on the side. We are both ice cream snobs and ginger snap officinados, but all of these were indescribably delicious, delicate, and complex. We were the second customers to be served and all the charming and slightly nervous staff were out front waiting on our every word and gesture. There was a palpable sense of intrepidation and excitement as they hung on our every word. We discussed the ins-and-out of salt in ice cream, made the appropriate (and genuine) ooohs and ahhs, and wished them well on their can't-miss venture. If they can keep the quality as good as opening day and the lines shorter than Tartine, they will surely be opening a second creamery before long... opening date TBD! 5 stars, for sure!

What can I say that hasn't already been said about the salted caramel? It's delicious? It titillates the senses? It's worth the (usually very long but goes quickly) wait?

I've been here several times, and the icecream is beyond compare. BUT The service was appalling on my visit last night. I asked for 2 tastes of flavors I had never had before, and the server said he had run out of spoons, so i settled on my old time favorite salted caramel. well, what do Êyou know, the person behind me asked for a taste and the very same server (named Andre) miraculously produced a tasting spoon and proceeded to give everyone else on the queue tastes. i asked why, and he said it was because they were new customers i didn't quite get that rationale as 1. i hadn't mentioned i was an old customer and 2. why does a regular customer deserve any less courtesy than a new one? I was hopping MAD. and am going to call the manager to complain. But i must say the salted caramel ice-cream is a like scoop of salty heaven.

This ice cream shop is awesome as its popularity indicates. They have many unique flavors like honey lavender, salted caramel, roasted banana, strawberry balsamic, and many many more. If you love ice cream, you should definitely check this place out. BUT!!!, if you choose the wrong day and time, you'll find yourself waiting in over 30 minutes in line just for an ice cream. Since parking is not easy around this area, if you have spent enough time finding parking and end up waiting, you'll be spending an hour for an ice cream. The pleasure you get out of this ice cream is immense, but it only lasts 5 minutes tops. I have spent an hour here many times only to see my happiness come to an end in 5 minutes. So, I suggest a few things to you guys. Try to avoid Saturday and Sunday lunch times as they are almost always packed during these hours. AND if the weather is sunny and great, forget about it. Try to avoid the lunch time and go between 3-5pm, when it gets less crowded. There is a park nearby, so on weekends and sunny days, everyone in the city comes out. Enjoy your ice cream, but avoid wasting your precious time.

While impressed, I am not floored by the experience.

ÊI figure if an ice cream creamery deserves a 5, I should be able to recognize it immediately. That said, it was small, the line wasn't too bad, and the ice cream was good.

A great place to take your SF foodie girlfriend who loves real foods and rainbow market but other than that...it's just aiiiiiiight. I felt like another typical SF touchy-feeley organic blah blah blah food place. The ice cream was good, but definitely not worth the 25 minute line.

My favorite dessert! Everyone compares this ice cream to Mitchell's, and now the holy trinity includes Humphry Slocombe. ÊMitchell's is good with tropical flavors, whereas Bi-Rite has better creaminess. ÊHumphry slocombe has very unique flavors. I've decided this place is my favorite. ÊLove the creaminess of the ice cream. ÊSalted caramel is worth every trip here. ÊThe key here is the roasted effect of the caramel flavor. Even in cold weather, I still come for the powerful rich bold flavor the cinnamon and snicker doodle (ricanela) is good too. Êbrown sugar with ginger is interesting the line goes outside in 40 deg weather -- you know this place is worth it! Êtry salted caramel with coffee toffee (so rich), or combine with butter brown pecan also adding spiced pecans can be nice, but can overwhelm the ice cream flavor -- but if you get a single with topping, they put it in a bowl, so you get more ice cream i still love this place and recommend it all the time the sundaes have 2 scoops of ice cream catch the club like line up outside on weekends? Êplace is still going strong now has suggested combos -- i still like the coffee toffee with salted caramel such perfect contrasting of strong flavors (always consistent). Êlove it after all these years.

Holy macaroni. ÊThank you Yelp for directing me to this hole-in-the-wall on my most recent trip to the Bay. ÊI am eternally yours. The line wasn't as ridiculous as feared, but I suppose we did go after dinner in January. ÊWe still had a good five or ten minutes to plan our orders, but no standing around the block. I have to say, service was fantabulous. ÊI'm a huge pain in the ass when it comes to ice cream shops. ÊI have to sample at least three flavors at a fucking Baskin Robbins before making a commitment, so imagine how insufferable I am when I'm looking through a glass displaying flavor names that take time to read. ÊI sampled the chai spiced milk chocolate, the riconelas (cinnamon and snickerdoodle), and the creme fraiche. ÊI didn't want to sample too many more, so I narrowed it down to the malted vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate and the brown sugar with ginger and caramel swirl for my last sample. ÊI did this out loud to my friend in line ahead of me. ÊWhen I asked to sample the malted vanilla, the server handed me a spoon with both the malted vanilla and the brown sugar on it - she had overheard, and instead of being irritated at my request for a fourth sample, decided to give me everything. ÊI almost asked her to marry me. Since I don't live in the Bay anymore, I decided to do Bi-Rite right - my friend and I went family style. ÊHe got three scoops - roasted banana, chocolate, and honey lavender. ÊI got four - salted caramel, chai spiced milk chocolate, malted vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate, and creme fraiche. ÊTogether with the rejected samples (which were oh so hard to reject), that makes nine flavors, and every single one was absolutely delicious. ÊThey were all very deep, distinct flavors, and I'd be hard-pressed to pick a favorite, but I suppose if I had a gun to my head, or if someone were threatening to take my Bi-Rite away from me, I would go with either the malted vanilla or the salted caramel. ÊI was scraping the bottom of my four-scoop cup. ÊIf only I could be a regular, the lovely servers could watch me as I came back night after night looking more and more like a blissful balloon.

After hearing the crazy hypes for this place, I had to try it. Luckily, it was completely empty when I came after lunch at Ike's. I really liked Ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodle) as well as the honey lavender. The popular salted caramel was a bit too strong for me. It tasted a bit too burnt or something. I love the richness of the ice cream and the unique flavors they have but at the same time, sharing a small was more than enough for me. I'd recommend trying this place for sure and it's in walking distance of Ike's so will make a great dessert afterwards.

well, geeze, i hope i could help this place out by doing 1 more review. Ê bi-rite is very well known but the line moved quickly. Êit is NOTHING like an LA food trend which I just can not tolerate. Ê everyone in line was polite & civil. Êthe employees were efficient and quick. Êit was a relatively painless process. Êwhen i heard we were going i was worried i was going to have a "Pink's Hotdogs" or "Sprinkles" (both located in Los Angeles) experience where you wait in line for hours for over priced, mediocre food. not bi-rite. Êthe ice cream was rich and unique in flavor. Êi got the single scoop of creme fraiche & brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl with dark chocolate topping. Êmy only regret is not ordering a TRIPLE. Ê:D

Delicious ice cream. ÊI like soft serve, so had their flavors of the day (they have two different flavors per day), salted caramel and chocolate. ÊLOVED the sundae, which was the ice cream with homemade hot fudge and marcona almonds. ÊBest sundae ever! ÊWent back again and had the almond toffee sundae, good, but a little too sweet for my taste. ÊThere is always a line at this place...but the soft serve line is usually short and goes pretty quick. ÊCan't say the same for the other line.

The warm day in San Francisco turned into a windy cold. ÊI didn't care, having heard that this play had great Yelp reviews and I am an ice cream fanatic! ÊSo I made sure I got to Bi Rite after dinner. The line was a little long, it was cold outside while waiting, and I didn't bring the best attire for such weather. ÊBut! ÊIt was all worth it. ÊThe service was friendly, and most importantly the ice cream was incredibly great. ÊI had Salted Caramel, Coffee Toffee, and Ricanelas [a snickerdoodle ice cream]. ÊIn my opinion, Salted Caramel and Ricanelas are some of the best ice cream flavors I've ever had.

last night was the best ever!!!!..because i had the most glorious, heavenly, luscious organic ice cream!!!! i had a kiddie scoop (which accdg to the board: for kid's only!, but the guy at the counter gave it to me anyway..so that was super cool!) of SALTED CARAMEL and it was very, very, very delicious! on the other hand, my companion had the MALTED CHIPS RICE KRISPIES..and of course, i have to have a taste of it, so i had a lick (he didn't mind) and yet again, it was pure heaven!. though organic, it was surprisingly full of flavor. both of us was so happy...furthermore, you could purchase their pre-pack ice cream, ice cream sandwiches, cookies, banana splits, sundaes, cakes, some Êorganic chocolates and their wonderful varieties of toppings for your ice cream, such as, mocha, orange, chocolate are also available for purcahse. NOTE TO SELF: go to bi-rite creamery after work to buy: 2 bags of TOFFEE CHIPS COOKIE, 1 pre-pack of SALTED CARAMEL and 1 ice cream sandwich in COCONUT WITH CHOCOLATE.

Five stars seems a bit extravagant, especially compared to some of the other places I've given five stars. But four just doesn't seem enough. So the fives have it. We went here on my birthday after reading numerous Yelp reviews and articles praising its virtues. And it was pretty damn good. It was a Wednesday evening and there were only a few people in line in the store (we didn't have to wait outside -- yay!). I had to get the Salted Caramel after hearing so much about it, and it was definitely good. Not super strong on the flavor necessarily, just really creamy and sweet, but yes ... a slight saltiness could be detected, though I'm not sure I would have noticed it if I didn't know the name of the ice cream. My other flavor was the Ricanelas -- cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodle cookies. I'm not even hugely into cinnamon anything (except a giant, gooey cinnamon roll, perhaps) or snickerdoodles, but this ice cream was fab. My fiancee got the Coffee Toffee and it was delicious and full of flavor. He also got the malted vanilla, which I personally thought was good, but not my thing. I would totally come back here sometime, I just don't get out to this part of SF regularly. But I'm sure we'll make the trek again sometime. We even considered taking some home, but figured it would be mostly melted on the near-hour drive home so just voted to be happy with the single experience. Yum.

Yes! Finally, I made it back to try the Salted Caramel - thanks, Diane P! It's good. I usually stay away from caramel ice cream because it tends to be too sweet for but this one isn't - maybe because there's salt in it? Well, that's my scientific analysis!

I used to think ice cream was the most boring-est dessert ever, but I think Bi-Rite has changed my mind. The malted vanilla and the salted caramel were SOOO goood! Definitely, the best vanilla ice cream I've ever had. I think I would be content with sampling all their flavors, since I'm not a big ice cream person and I couldn't even finish one cup. But for all the ice cream lovers out there, this is a must try. It even made walking 4 blocks in the pouring rain worth it.

The long wait did not deter me. ÊNeither does the parking. Ê The wait turned out to be 15 minutes, which is perfectly acceptable given that it was a Sunday afternoon and everybody is just looking for a little pick me up between lunch and dinner. Ê The parking turned out to be 2 blocks away, only either through my own sheer luck or the kindness of the SF Parking God. Ê Apparently legend has it that there are only two Bi-Rite flavors that really matter: Honey Lavender and Salted Caramel. ÊI tried them both before ordering and here are my verdict: 1) Honey Lavender: the taste reminded me of hand soap from Bath & Body Works. ÊI kid you not - I'm sure a lot of people swear by it but, to me it didn't taste like anything but soap. ÊSorry. 2) Salted Caramel: a definite winner. ÊSee below for further explanation. So I ended up with a two-scoop cone of Salted Caramel and good ol' Cookies and Cream (based on the expectation that nobody could ever mess that one up). Ê The Salted Caramel was the more famous of the two, being #35 on 7X7 2010 Big Eats SF: 100 Things To Eat in SF Before You Die and I can see why. ÊI wouldn't be surprised if they stole the trick from certain maker of bad (yet good!) sugary cereals a la Frosties and Froot Loop: adding NaCl actually enhances the sweetness of sucrose. ÊLike a drug, the salt / sugar mixture in Salted Caramel was the one that made people keep coming back for more, and definitely was a direct catalyst for the ice-cream flavor's fame. Ê Otherwise, for those who are looking to be a bit more adventurous, Bi-Rite isn't really the place to be. ÊTheir other flavors, like Cookies and Cream, are great, but unfortunately not special. ÊDefinitely not 15-min-wait-or-more special. ÊThink the likes of vanilla, toffee, chocolate, mint chip, butter pecan, white chocolate with berry swirl, and strawberry. ÊIn short - flavors you can find at your nearby WholeFoods or even (heavens forbid) Safeway. Ê The adventurous bunch would instead be better off going to Humphry Slocombe a mile away (Strawberry Candied Jalapeno, here I come!!!).

Mmm, salted caramel tasted exactly like perfectly roasted marshmallows.

ÊNothing else compares. ÊThank goodness for competition, because in San Fran there are more than a couple amazing creameries.

ÊThe honey lavender is brilliant, too, but in a way that's edible...sometimes flowery or herb-y ice cream flavors can feel more like experiments than perfect marriages (I've had tarragon ice cream at an upscale restaurant that was less than awesome).

If there's an ice creamery with a better location than this place, you'd have to show it to me. It's small-ish yet they've got a sizable amount of mixed and standard flavors.

ok.. looks like there is a million reviews on this place so I will keep it short and simple... this place rocks my socks off. FANTASTIC ice cream!!!! Salted Caranel- I guess I'm not the only one who loves the combination of sweet and salty!!! The Salted Caramel... geeeezus, you couldnt ask for a better creation. The ratio of sweet to salty, on point. If i had a tub of that it would be devoured in seconds. Balsamic Strawberry- good, not as spectacular as the salted caramel but still delicious. IMO its just strawberry. i didnt really taste anything out of the ordinary, just the fact its got a bit more of a tart taste than the norm- reminds me of raspberries. Creme Fraiche- who in the world would think this would be an ice cream flavor? YUM!!! Honey Lavender- good, not as good as the hype, but still good. I just kinda felt as if I was licking my lotion. Its good, but possibly an acquired taste. Ê Despite the 5 minute wait in line, this place is really worth the wait! Single scoops you can get 2 scoops with 2 different flavors!! it helps to come with friends so that you can all try something different. Just dont come with people who only want chocolate or vanilla.

Bi-rite is the best ever! I love their ice cream even if it comes out to like 16$ per pint (vs like 3$ for one at your local grocery store). Everyone of course is raving about salted caramel and for good reason - its simply the best flavor i have ever had in my entire life. I also had Earl grey with this, amazing stuff really. I have been here 3 times really and I always get salted caramel + one other flavor. I have never been dissapointed. I will go and stand in that ridiculous line any day of the week, rain or shine, sleet or snow, I must go. Well too bad I dont live in the area anymore, but when I visit this is always on my list. I want some right now, i need to know a similar place in TX, please tell me anyone who can.

This is a place I initially avoided because of the line that is always spilling out the door, but it's worth the wait, which actually goes pretty fast. Although Mitchell's still has the creamiest, most luxurious ice cream, I honestly prefer Bi Rite. They offer such adventurous yet amazingly well-balanced flavor combinations. The salt caramel really is the star here. It's incredible- salty and sweet and slightly smoky; very intense. I disagree with Tom about the honey lavender. My sister and I thought they did a really good job of balancing out the honey and lavender flavors so that it didn't taste too soapy or perfumy or sweet. It was simple and perfect, if you like the flavor of lavender. The brown butter pecan was too rich for me, but I don't like butter pecan much in general. I had a taste of the milk chocolate chai, and I'm definitely getting that next time. Or the balsamic strawberry...... They also have several innovative sundaes, such as one with chocolate ice cream, bergamont olive oil and sel gris. I don't remember the prices exactly, but they're reasonable: a bit over $2 for a small, and about $6 for sundaes. and their ice cream is so rich and flavorful I've always been very happy with a small. I suggest going with friends so you can all try lots of different flavors.

This place is great. The only gripe that I have is the smaller portions / big prices. The line is usually long outside for the ice cream but moves pretty fast. Most people don't know there is soft serve at the next counter Êbeyond the line. Usually there is no line there and they only have 3 or 4 different flavours to choose from.

there are so many good ice cream places around, and bi-rite had been hyped quite a bit, but we joined the long line anyway. Êseconds turned to minutes, and every person that walked by caused me to salivate like one of pavlov's dogs. Êafter what seemed like an eternity, we were finally faced with bi-rite's amazing choices. Êeventually we ended up with salted caramel, banana, and a "yummy sundae," which consisted of lemon ice cream, caramel topping, whipped cream and gingersnaps. well, slap me silly and call me sally - bi-rite is AMAZING!

With a webpage that has "salted caramel" cached in every paragraph, 400 reviews and 4.5 stars, I decided to jump off the bridge with everyone else. ÊOne of my best friends Christina Y. came along because we thrive on Yelp and bookmark everything and go on Yelp excursions (you can join if you want!) and then write nasty reviews of our favorite places because we're such selfish hoes. Upon arriving, I'm that irritating person in line who just HAS to try everything and then takes an extra 10 minutes to decide what to actually buy. ÊFrom what I've tried, the Chai Chocolate and Mint Chocolate were tasty, Nectarine was tasteless, and Strawberry vinaigrette was just OK. ÊOn the other hand, salted caramel was everything I had hoped for and more! =))))))))))))))) I didn't only see the bottom of my cup all cleaned up and SCRAPED up, but I ended up seeing my jeans. ÊOh dear, it was time to buy another scoop. I would have to be reading the book "Skinny Bitch" to deny coming back for Salted Caramel. My only dispute: ice cream should not melt faster than sorbet. ÊIn this case my salted caramel melted and drizzled over my frozen plum sorbet (3.5 stars) after less than 5 minutes.

I was hoping to find some vegan ice cream in San Francisco and Bi-Rite did not disappoint! I got a brownie sundae made with their vegan chocolate coconut ice cream (the whole sundae wasn't vegan, though). The ice cream itself was awesome. It doesn't taste too much like coconut but it's very creamy like dairy ice cream. The brownie was homemade and they put spiced toasted pecans on that are amazing. The sundae was $7 but it was worth it for a sundae made with vegan ice cream! It also seems like they have good values in terms of using whole/natural ingredients and that's worth supporting, too.

Once again I may be the dissenter in my opinion, the traitor in your midst...but I just didn't find Bi-Rite Creamery to be that extraordinary. ÊIt was 9:30 p.m. on a blustery night when I decided to make an ice cream pilgrimage, my first outing to this seemingly holy place. ÊI walked right in, no line and decided on the ginger. ÊIt was nice and gingery but too sweet, I immediately felt my blood sugar level spike (yeah I know sugar is a key ingredient in ice cream)....I may be back again for some of the recommended flavors.

This is probably the best ice cream in town. I'm not usually an ice cream lover. However, Bi-Rite is the exception. I've come here twice with my friend. I've tried honey lavender, ginger, coffee toffee, and cinnamon ricanela, tastilicious. An added bonus is Delores Park, where the hot men gather and dogs are adorable.

i almost don't want to write this review. that is how good this effing ice cream is. i don't want to contribute to the lines, but y'all need to know totes for serious. y'all don't even know. the salted caramel is like an explosion of heaven and joy all over my mouth. i got it on a cone and it was Êso good i bought a pint. and at 8 bucks a pop, that is saying a lot. i understand that the higher price of organic ingredients and the artisan craftsmanship blah blah blah contribute to this, but i don't really care. honestly, i would pay $15 for a pint of this gold. just don't tell them that.

I went here last weekend after reading a lot of positive reviews. I've NEVER been so disappointed with anything after being referred to a product or service. I tried four flavors and was, at best, unimpressed with any of them. First, the salted caramel, which seemed to be the most popular choice: Though I'm not sodium dependent as so many other people (I don't even cook with it), this ice cream was far too salty, with no balance of flavor, not particularly rich. The aftertaste was bitter, leaving me to anticipate my next flavor... The brown sugar/ginger: The ginger overwhelmed and didn't complement the sweetness. I'm not sure if this was equally bitter to the salted caramel, but it was time for another palate cleansing, then on to the next flavor. Balsamic Strawberry: This was probably the least offensive flavor. While the balsamic vinegar balanced the otherwise sweetness of most strawberry ice creams, it also did very little to complement the flavor. It was the richest, creamiest of those I tried, but still fell far short of my expectations. Finally, the Ricanellas (cinnamon w/snickerdoodles): This flavor was the closest to any other quality ice creams that I've eaten. The cookie pieces did very little but to provide cheap filler ingredients. While it was most easily palatable, it's relative inferior quality left me wanting for NO MORE. I have been travelling 40 miles to the city since 2005, sometimes just to get Mitchell's ice cream, as I have found none better. I'll be writing a review in a couple days after my return from my next venture. There is no way to compare the two, as their products have few similarities. For Bi Rite, I'd add one star for their customer service, as their employees are very friendly and will allow you to sample several flavors. But, because of their helpfulness, I'd subtract 1/2 star for the long lines and another 1/2 for the small portions and inflated prices. If you are a true aficianado, you might agree with my review. Try Mitchell's or Humphry Slocombe's. If you are a common ice cream eater that is easy to please, you might also agree. Try Fenton's or Loard's Ice Cream in Oakland. If you are pretentious and want to provide a socially acceptable opinion for fear that your peers will otherwise think less of you (thus bruise your ego), then you might disagree with my review. Keep coming here and be happy in your narrow-sightedness. I'm not sugar-coating anything here. Thoughts of favorite things don't wet my pants like they do for some other people. My opinions are partly subjective, of course, but I take into account the fact that people's tastes vary. I don't dispute the quality of the ingredients, but the finished product does not merit a better rating; (using the McDonald's analogy again) If I ordered a soft serve, I would rate it three stars, as I would expect no more for the price. I expect to "get what I pay for" (in quotations, as I would never end a sentence with a preposition). My expectations were not met.

These days, a visit to SF doesn't seem complete without a trip to Bi-Rite Creamery. It was a nice sunny day in the Mission district, so there was quite a line, which I guess isn't unusual, even on not-so-nice days. It was actually good, because it gave me time to look at all their offerings of the day. Salted Caramel was #1 on my list, had to try that, but what to get for the 2nd scoop? There was toasted bananas, vegan chocolate, honey lavender (!), and a bunch of other stuff. I figured toasted bananas would be good w/the salted caramel so those were the flavors I got. Mm, excellent texture and flavor, not too sweet or icy. It was almost like a gelato consistency. My friend got the hot fudge brownie sundae, which was AMAZING, with the warm brownie and spiced pecans. Definitely warrants a repeat visit the next time I'm in town.

3.5 stars - Came here for the first time on a sunny San Francisco Saturday and battled parking for a good half hour and inevitably waited in a line which to my delight moved swiftly. ÊI ordered a single of half cookies 'n cream and half lavender honey. I've had lavender honey elsewhere and thought it was little too potent here. I thought the cookies 'n cream was the smoothest, yummiest ice cream I've had in a long time but still didn't think it was incredible (translate: this place's 4.5 star rating is overrated).

There's probably not much left to add to this Bi-Rite review page, but I imagine that their recipe for salted caramel involves sugar, butter, cream, rainbows, unconditional love, a child's laughter, and that satisfying feeling you get after blowing on a dandelion. ÊIt's just magical and good and probably how God intended ice cream to taste like.

HOLD YOUR HORSES, WAKE THE CHILDREN, SMACK YOUR BOSS IN THE FACE, HEAVEN IS HERE!!!!! I was graced by the hand of God to forgo this wonderous treasure just the other night. I was having dinner with some friends and we all had a craving for some ice cream. I had had frozen yogurt for about a month now, so I knew it was time to visit my old love ice cream. Much to my surprise there was a place just a few blocks away from the restaurant and we went on our search. This quaint little corner shop was anything but a secret hideout. A line formed out the door with a few individuals already enjoying a few scoops of this scrumptious delight. I was quite excited as I waited in line, even though it was a bit of a wait, everyone knows that when there's a line its going to be worth it. And it certainly was! The store was brightly lit, scents of ice cream and waffles eminated out the door. The menu was handwritten, which I found quite adorable. The flavors were all written in various colors on a chalk board, all with common names and also some that were quite intriguing. I had a sample of the Earl Gray Tea and the Honey Lavender. Aside from the flavor, there was the debacle of size, cup or cone, toppings or no toppings. So many decisions for just one woman. I decided upon the single cone with Honey Lavender and Balsamic Strawberry also adding the cookie of the day as my topping. Sadly cones couldn't receive a topping buddy, so the server graciously suggested putting my ice cream in a cup and sticking the cone on top. I was thrilled at the idea and at the moment I took my first bite, I was not disappointed. The flavors hit you like lightning, they shocked the system, electrifying every single taste bud. It was, and I will gently say this, the most orgasmic sensation you will ever feel in your entire life! The two flavors, mixed with a waffle cone and powder sugar covered cookie was indeed a heavenly experience. I have found euphoria and its name is BiRite :).

Maybe it has to do with the fact that summer is here or maybe it has do with the fact that my palette has become more refined as I continue to experience San Francisco's unbeatable cuisine, but Bi-Rite creamery has grown on me. Last night, my friends from San Jose were visiting and we did the "18th/Guerrero" gourmet tour, including stops at Delfina pizza, Tartine, and finally Bi-Rite creamery. My friend (who is pretty much an ice cream connaisseur as she plans to open up a frozen custard shop) had some recommendations including the balsamic strawberry ice cream sandwich and the banana split made with caramelized torched bananas. ÊI first tried some samples, just to see what the options were looking like- the snickerdoodle cinnamon was quite good, as was the balsamic strawberry. However, as we had just feasted on Delfina's rich creamy cheese laden pizzas I decided to go for the lighter options being the plum sorbet. This was very tart, very plum, and very refreshing. My friends ordered the banana split, coffee toffee sundae, and balsamic strawberry ice cream sandwich. Oh wow. Awesome choices (of course I had to sample their delicacies as well). The banana split combination of bananas au flambe, roasted nuts, and roasted banana ice cream was divine, as was the coffee toffee ice cream sundae made with Ritual's coffee ice cream, and delicious toffee chunks (not to mention a generous drizzle of chocolate sauce and crushed almonds). The balsamic strawberry ice cream sandwich was fantastic as well- the cookies must be made with some kind of shortening that doesn't harden under low temperature as they stay moist and delicious. Although I couldn't really taste the balsamic flavor, the strawberry was light and creamy. So, it looks like we might have a tie between Bi-Rite and Mitchell's right now, although I still do think Bi-Rite should expand their sorbet and yogurt options.

Four words: Salted Caramel Ice Cream. It is simply divine. I have tried a lot of their different flavors, but the salted caramel is my favorite- it is sweet & savory....words cannot describe its' lovliness.

If you know me, there are few things that come between me and ice cream (even a stomach virus doesn't stop me). ÊThe first time I set foot into Bi-Rite was during the Red Bull Soapbox Derby, and the line totally threw me off, but we all know this means that it's delicious. ÊJust getting a whiff of this place takes you away. ÊIf we're in the area, I'll stop by for a treat, even if we're on our way to dinner. ÊI'll have dessert before dinner.

When you see a long line stretching out from a small shop, especially when it's for ice cream, you begin to make wild remarks like, 'There MUST be crack in this,' or 'This HAS to be the ice cream that Chuck Norris fancies,' or 'Is THIS the ice cream finally worth robbing for?' ÊBy reflex, I had to have the not-so-common flavors: salted caramel, ginger, and honey lavender as they would usually pose the most challenge on my taste buds. ÊMind you, I was in an altered state that increases appetite, and what doctors call these days as having 'the munchies'; so ice cream, by default, was smooth and decadent.

Meh.

The ice creams were alright for the first few bites but then became too sweet. Like many other posters, I too tried the lavendar honey and salted caramel, and I also checked out the coffee toffee.

Having left the left coast, I feel the occasional frustration with myself for not exploring San Francisco more in my four years in the East Bay. ÊLast weekend, that occasional frustration turned to unbridled self-loathing when Renee T. took me to Bi-Rite. ÊHow could I have deprived myself of this heavenly treat for all those years? Having sampled a few flavors between us, I urge the reader to try the brown sugar with the caramel-ginger swirl. ÊCrushed up gingersnaps just plain belong in ice cream (See also: Toscanini's Black Bottom ice cream, Cambridge, MA). ÊAlongside the brown sugar, I tried the ricanelas, a bright cinnamon flavor, that paired really nicely with the ginger. ÊThe honey lavender was refreshing, though I wouldn't describe the lavender as subtle. ÊI've had fantastic honey lavender before (Christina's, also Cambridge, MA), but the Bi-Rite version was leagues more floral and fragrant, which I liked, but I imagine might be off-putting if you're more of a traditionalist when it comes to ice cream flavors.

Picture it: San Francisco, Sept 2010 and it's a heat wave. A mid 30's gay boy from the desert, who happens to be sweating like a you know what in church goes to the City for for Folsom and the GayVN Awards. One day while sashaying around the city, he decides to pop in line at Bi-Rite to see if the tasty frozen treats here give you the Big O as so many yelpers have claimed. While waiting in line he checks out the crowd, sizes them up and goes over the menu items wondering what two items to choose, or risk having his girlish figure expand...again. Once inside, I...I mean the mid 30's gay boy decide on two flavors - cookies & cream and brown sugar, to which he thought, "damn they stole my stage name!" Oh.My.Goodness!!! It was like a flavor explosion that I didn't want to end! It was smooth, creamy and tasty, nothing like you'd buy at the grocery store, baskin robbins or dairy queen. You'd think here in the Arizona desert there'd be something this good, but sadly I now know that I must travel to San Francisco for ice cream that good! It's okay, it's another reason to visit this incredible city. Oh, and that mid 30's gay boy wanted to take his ice cream across the street to Dolores Park, enjoy it and take in the fun.

The ice cream here is high quality stuff, no doubt about that. It was terribly rich -- I have mixed feelings about this. I don't know if I want my ice cream to be so sweet. It wasn't very complex, but maybe I need different flavors. Good stuff nonetheless. A bit pricey too.

Ice cream was definitely good, no doubt about that. ÊBut is it worth the price? ÊI think not. ÊI would prefer to go to Naia's for better gelato and cheaper prices. ÊEven a good pint of Haagen Dazs vanilla could beat this. ÊOr even the father-in-laws home made ice cream out of a wood and iron churn. ÊActually, that's giving the wrong impression. ÊThe father-in-laws ice cream puts this to shame.

When seeing a line out the door for a place. You know it's good! I had this place booked marked forever since I saw "Salted Carmel" I love Salted Carmel cupcakes so I thought I should love the ice cream. We knew this place was good cuz parking sucks around the area and there was a line out the door. Since I really wanted to try the place we circled around for parking and finally found one. Walked over and must say a cute neighborhood and waited in line. I was getting all excited to try ice cream and even at night and cold there are people here eating outside with there ice cream. They also have another window open but its for Soft Serve, I hear they change there flavors but that night they only had Chocolate and Vanilla which they didn't to much business. Everyone was in line for more of the other flavors they had. They had a good selection but I wanted to try the Salted Carmel and Honey Lavender. They also sell pints of all the ice cream on the menu. Of course we picked up a few pints. My date end up getting Salted Carmel and Roasted Banana. After trying the Salted Carmel it was a little bitter for me but I don't know if its cuz I ate the Honey Lavender first. Both was good but I notice the ice cream was not overly sweet and nor the cone which was great. The Banana was good too. I just they would be consistent with the size of the ice cream. Mine was huge and my date got small little balls of ice cream. Compare to mine his was small. I think when I do come back next time I want to have the Honey Lavender again and Roasted Banana. Yum!!

I've noticed in San Francisco when there is a line outside a food establishment it is usually gonna be damn good and worth the wait. Bi-Rite Creamery is no exception. ÊRun by the neat little market down the street, this little Ice Cream Parlor is something special. ÊThey are the purveyer's of the greatest ice cream of all time... Honey Lavender. ÊYou might not think that sounds too good, but trust me. ÊGet a couple spoonfulls in you and you will quickly see what I'm getting at.

I love the ice cream here. It's so good it should be illegal. The salted caramel that everyone raves about is as good as everyone promises. The snickerdoodle is good too. The Vanilla is hands down the best vanilla ice cream you have ever tasted. There is another reason to come here though. I don't know how Bi-Rite does it, but the people that work behind the counter are some of the best people I have ever come across working or not. They are happy, engaging and entertaining. I am personally in awe of one of the boys that works there. He makes me smile and doesn't even try that hard. He's just an awesome human being and kinda cute too! :)

There's more than 3000 reviews for this place so it doesn't really matter if I say that this place is good or bad. I'll just say that I really believe this place is worth it.

Also, I think this place is a big part of San Francisco culture and you should definitely come here if you are visiting from out of town.

For my wedding, I knew i didn't want to go the traditional cake route--so expensive and nobody ever eats it! Instead, I had an ice cream Sunday bar from Bi-Rite Creamery!! It was the best ever. I had four flavors--salted caramel, honey lavender, roasted banana and coffee toffee. Then a whole mess of sauces and nuts and sprinkles--everyone loved it! Even my parents friends who initially found the whole no-cake thing to be tragic. My guests where comparing toppings and Sunday styles--you name it. I'm telling you I have begun a new trend.

Giving this place anything less than 5 stars is a crime against the beautiful Straus Family cows of Marshall, CA who made this ice cream possible. In fact, the Salted Caramel really deserves at least five and a half stars, since I crave it daily. Soy Chocolate, Coffee Toffee, Chai Spiced Milk Chocolate. All perfect for mere mortals. Ice Cream Sandwiches, Popsicles. Love 'em both. But Salted Caramel on an organic sugar cone... ooh... it gives me cool, fleur de sel dreams.

Insulin rising, temperature decreasing. I love you, Salted Caramel. You are so lusciously creamy you even have a disclaimer about your texture; a feat no other ice cream can live up to. You are surrounded by well meaning flavors, but I must ask why your Cookies and Cream companion had an unpleasing lingering mint taste? Shh, don't speak, Salted Caramel.

Bi-Rite's salted caramel ice cream is the best ice cream I have ever had. The other flavors I've tried are great too, just not easily and obviously #1. Other outstanding flavors: roasted banana, something with a cinnamon base that my brother got and I ended up eating half of (but then again, he ate my salted caramel; so we're even), honey lavendar. I know the place sometimes gets some flack for a hipper-than-thou staff, but in my experiences, they were always fine (including the time one of my friends ended up breaking parts of the shop as it is a small space and she was very excited/jumping around at the prospect of yummy ice cream after a long day).

I went with some buddies and got a double consisting of the salted caramel as well as the coconut. The salted caramel tasted a bit like burnt caramel and wasn't quite right for me, but the coconut was awesome. It was delicious on it's own, but they even added some bits of coconut in the ice cream, which was a nice touch. ÊI also tasted a little of some cinnamon ice cream and banana, which made me wish I had gotten either of those instead of the salted caramel. Maybe a bit pricey, but this place is delicious and so close to Dolores Park!

Not much more needs to be said. The Salted Caramel is a MUST GET. If you're like me and love creamy vanilla ice cream, but like additional texture you should get Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces.

There are 10 trillion reviews here. I don't care. They have intriguing flavors, use my favorite milk from a farm powered by cow pies. They want you to compost your used cups and little wooden spoon sticks - just like the ones you would eat dixie cups with as a kid. Oh, and possibly most important, they are spitting distance to Delores Park, so you can sit in the Sun and eat your ice cream as the Blue Angels fly overhead.

Omg, melt in your mouth heaven! We came here wanting to try Sam's Sundae on "The Best Thing I Ever Ate" with the olive oil and accidentally went Êinto the market across the street (which by the way has really fresh produce and great cheeses), but instead the Afternoon Snack Sundae caught our eye when we read "roasted banana" ice cream. The flavors blended well together with the roasted banana ice cream and home-made graham crackers which had a caramelized taste. Topped with fresh caramel sauce yum wise choice! I'm not a big fan of chocolate ice cream anyways so this was an interesting flavor to try. They don't have too many flavors here as they do change them throughout the season and many of their flavors are unique. This is the first time I've ever heard or tried a roasted banana ice cream. Lucky for us we went on a winter's weekday so there was barely a line. One time we drove by in the summer and the line was around the corner! Crossing my fingers I can come back soon.

5 stars for the best ice cream in the bay area. (and I live 2 blocks away from Mitchell's Ice Cream). It has EXCEEDED my expectation TWICE. On my first visit, I had their honey lavender. I thought I was eating perfume or a flower when I took my first bite. The flavor was refreshing, unique and SUPER YUMMY. I went back 2 days later because everybody was talking about Salted Caramel and I had to try it! However, they were out that night, so I pick the Malted Vanilla. It sounds plain... but that's the best ice cream I have ever had! I have yet to try Salted Caramel but it will happen soon. I like Toffee Coffee too, but Malted Vanilla is my current favorite.

"Yum yum yummy, in my tummy.." - a song that my tummy sings on a rarely warm sunny day in the city when I'm eating something delicious. And Bi-Rite Creamery is delicious. I finally had a taste of the Salted Caramel ice cream that my co-worker raved about. He had every right to rave! It tastes a little like toffee. The saltiness is not overpowering. I also tried the Balsamic Strawberry, and the Honey Lavender. I had to knock off a star because of the Honey Lavender flavor because it reminded me too much of my bath soaps and lotions. My husband said it tastes like my lavender linen spray. Not exactly the most ideal flavor combination. But I'm sure the other flavors are worth a try, so I'm hoping to make a repeat trip into the city to see what else they offer. Just a mental note to myself: avoid anything that sounds like a scent from Bath and Body Works. ;)

ÊWell, it does, it's a most, heavenly flavor, there aren't any words to describe this, you just gotta try it.

My boyfriend absolutely loves this place so we go here all the time (at least once a weekend) I love the mix of interesting flavors and the creaminess of the ice cream. Though there is always a line it moves quickly and the staff always is pleasant and lets you try the different flavors. My favs would definitely be chai with chocolate, roasted banana, and the butter pecan. Perfect when going to Dolores park (or taking a walk in the mission) or just because you like to eat :)

bi-rite is still mighty good. apparently fat asses like me have caused bi-rite to stop offering more than 3 scoops on a cone. Êhowever, they will hook it up with up to four scoops in a cup and then top it off with a cone. lols. i got: - ricanela: awesome!! i am biased because snickerdoodle is my favorite cookie. - brown butter pecan: so rich and delicious! - coffee toffee: nice hit of coffee but minimal toffee taste. btw, the homemade almond toffee topping is like sugary crack. omg!

Bi-Rite Cremery is what Tina Turner might say if she tried this ice cream it's "Simply the best." Ê I, of course, tried many flavours and I couldn't get enough. ÊI finally decided upon the Salted Caramel--yes, I said Salt Caramel! ÊFor those that are salt phobic I am sorry. ÊThis is an experience that there is no substitute. The flavour profile was convincing and perfected. ÊNot too salty...it is just right. ÊI like caramel as much as I do chocolate. ÊI have had burnt caramel but haven't found that in a while. ÊBi-Rite has splendid flavours - creme fraiche (a clean and rich experience), strawberry balsamic (delightful--more balsamic, please), honey lavender, and roasted banana. ÊThese are great flavours and I think these are the most convincing, thoughtful and successful. ÊI have had at other vendors flavours like rose petal, cardamom (which some of you might know as one of my favourite spices), and Langka Ê(which is more commonly known as Jackfruit) but I walked away with no more passion as when I walked into these ice cream houses. I savour and pine to go back for flavour profiles I have never seen before. ÊYou will get a scoop and wish you ordered two. ÊI avoid 18th street as much as I can-- if i am slightly near Bi-Rite Creamery I am going to pack on some weight. ÊAmazing, simply amazing. Recap of tasting (on a 5 star scale): Roasted Banana - 4 stars Strawberry Balsamic - 3 stars Creme Fraiche - 5 stars Salted Caramel - 10 stars Honey Lavendar - 3 stars

I used to think that Mitchell's had the best ice cream in the city, but after trying the chocolate and salted caramel flavors at Bi-Rite Creamery, I was forced to reexamine this firmly held belief. In general, the ice cream at Bi-Rite is perfectly flavored, smooth, sweet, and free of ice crystals (*ahem*). As for flavor, well, the salted caramel is a delicious must-try, and the chocolate is possibly the best plain chocolate ice cream I've ever had, and is surprisingly - and happily - similar in flavor to the chocolate gelato at Gelato Milano in Berkeley. But the piece de resistance is the Sam's Sundae, a spectacular concoction including the aforementioned chocolate ice cream combined with Êbergamot olive oil, coarse sea salt, and whipped cream.

I tend to like my ice cream filled with shit....no, not FECES, but yummy ice cream shit. My ideal flavor would be something like chocolatechunkscookiedoughfudgeglobsmarshamallowsn?utsandanythingelseyoucanthrowintheicecreammaker. Bi Rite is a bit more minimalist, but totally yummy when I'm in the mood for something sweet and simple, yet delectable. I swooned over the salted caramel, which contains nary a trace of good ice cream shit and is simply a lovely flavor explosion in my mouth.

What really got me wanting to come sooner than later is because of one flavor - the honey lavender. ÊWhen I read they have this flavor on one of the reviews - that was it. ÊAll the other reasons why others came were just secondary. ÊI LOVE lavender - everything lavender. ÊThe first time I had lavender ice cream was at Palomino over 10 years ago and that special fragrant and taste stayed with me. This place is small. ÊTo the left are shelves of goodies you can take home from the tasty crispy cones, cookies to the flavored chocolate sauce. ÊThere's a small freezer next to the counter where you can find pre-packed pints and quarts of ice cream, ice cream pie, ice cream cake, ice cream sandwiches, cookie dough...etc. When it is your turn - the folks behind the counter were just friendly and patient. ÊYou can ask for taste after taste and they happily give you a spoonful of whatever you requested on a REAL spoon. ÊYes folks, they use real spoons and not tiny plastic taste spoons like other places. ÊThis is very impressive and really a fantastic idea, not to mention very environmental. Ê I had to try the honey lavender first, after all we are there because of it. ÊOne small taste and I was in love. ÊOk - pint of that. ÊNext was the salted caramel I read so much about - taste of that, fell in love for the 2nd time - yup, a pint of that too. ÊTasted the balsalmic strawberry, wasn't our cup of tea. ÊNext was the mexican chocolate with salty peanuts, it was tasty and we decided to get it on a cone. ÊAt the last minute, I decided to add the toasted banana flavor (single can have up to 2 flavors, double up to 3 flavors...) even though we haven't tasted it - it was good. ÊWhile paying, I noticed the fresh cookies and added a chocolate chip cookie. ÊThe cookie was thin but it was chewy and full of chocolate chips! ÊIt was the perfect companion to the ice cream cone - we sat inside to enjoy our treats while checking out the menu and other flavors...thinking what we should be getting on our next trip over. Thanks Yelpers for another great place, we wouldn't have known about this place if it wasn't for Yelp and it's Yelpers.

I've finally experienced the wonders of Bi-Rite Creamery. I wasn't feeling too adventurous so I settled on a cinnamon flavour with Snickerdoodles in it. It tasted just like the cookie but with ice cream. The staff are really nice. The guy at the counter was really concerned that I might drop my cone. I appreciated the effort. Luckily, when we went, the line wasn't terribly long but then again, it is getting a little colder in the city. ÊI'm definitely going back to try more flavours. Hehe.

Bi-Rite opened the soft serve window shortly after I moved away from the hood. The salted caramel soft serve on Wednesdays is perfection. Forget the swirl... give me salted caramel only!

Honey lavender ice cream for me please! This is one of the best lavender flavored treats I've ever had! The flavor is mild and pleasant. I tried the salted caramel which was a bit too thick and salty for me. I am a true fan ice cream. The weirder the flavor, the better.

Bi-rite has some of the best ice cream I've ever had. ÊTheir selection of flavors is incredible, and they're always generous with the samples. ÊI usually get the salted caramel and the ricanelas (cinnamon ice cream with chunks of snickerdoodle cookies), with lots of samples in between. ÊThe roasted banana is awesome, and so is the earl grey. ÊBoth of them actually taste like the description, with no gross colorings or artificial flavors.

Mission ice cream crawl stop 3 of 4. The ginger, salted caramel, and lemon samples I tried were all Mel Gibson-crazy. Settled on the salted caramel and paired it with the more conventional roasted banana. The ice cream here laughs off the usual creaminess-flavour trade-off like no one besides Sketch in Berkeley. It's not quite as creamy as Mitchell's, but it has a better mouthfeel. The banana has a deep, deep taste, and the salted caramel, as you may recall, is Bai Ling-insane. This is shock flavouring, which is why I'm withholding the fifth star for the moment -- don't know if it'll stand up to repeat visits. But repeat visits are guaranteed.

Just moved onto 18th street on 3/1/11. It's now 6 wees later. Fuck. I am screwed. Ê Always intrigued by people standing in the rain waiting for ice cream, but simultaneously thinking that they are just really stupid and that this place is like Serendipity in NY, which is just way overrated. Last night I gave in. I have AT&T and don't have service in weird spots, like, my house. So I took a walk outside to chat with my mom. I walked by Bi-Rite about 4 times in that one hour, and then as I walked past the final time I stopped. I was the second person in line at the side bakery/togo window (the regular line was about 15 deep, no thanks). Got a pint of Salted Caramel for $7.99 (now at this point I am thinking I am just stupid). I get home, open it up, and share half of it with the beau. So delicious. I mean, freaking amazing. Like really effing good, creamy ice cream. ÊI now feel good about $7.99 that I paid. Just now, I had a couple bites from the half full pint. The bf will be home in about an hour. At that time I will ask him if he wants to split the rest of it. Maybe I will have one more bite before he gets home. Stop reading the reviews, just go get some. please.

So my husband and I were in the city one afternoon and he mentions that we should try this ice cream place he heard about. Ice cream? I'm in! So were driving around the area where we think its located until I spot some happy looking people licking ice cream cones crossing the street. From there we followed the steady stream of folks with ice cream until they lead us like a trail of ants to Bi-rite creamery. Outside the creamery was a long line of people (like 10+) and parking was no where to be found. We circled a several block radius searching for a tiny spot for our tiny car but we could find nothing! Nothing I tell you! We started arguing - "Why didnt you take that spot? Didnt you see that spot!!!?" "That wasnt a spot, that was a driveway!" "No, it was a spot, and now its gone! Ugh!" Our desire for ice cream was driving us mad. So after 20 minutes scouring the neighborhood for a spot, my husband decided to drive by the creamery one more time and if we didnt get a spot, we were giving up. And then, it happened. An ice cream miracle. We drove by, and the 10 minute loading zone right IN FRONT of the shop was open!!! Yes, RIGHT IN FRONT!! This never happens to us. Tears of joy streamed down our faces and we quickly apologized to each other for getting snippy earlier. We got out of the car, proudly and smugly for finding such a precious gem of a parking spot and the people waiting in line looked envious (undoubtedly they were parked miles away). So now to the ice cream. Its wonderful. The toasted coconut was delectable. The chocolate ice cream was the best chocolate ice cream I've ever had. SO GOOD. I do have to say though ordering was a bit soup nazi-ish. No time to decide what you want - and you can barely see the menu until you are right there at the counter. And then you have to move over and get in the other line to pay or else someone behind the counter will yell and say "Move to the other line to pay!". So yeah we didn't know the whole "routine" but now we do and will be prepared.

Let's be honest - no one's reading this review. There's a sea of us writting reviews for bi-rite. Currently it's a 1 in a 2369 chance my review will be the one your eyes decide to scroll over. So, for my own sake I'm writting a review, but also for my own sake I'll keep it short and sweet. Came here for the Carmel (salted that is) but left in love. First off we got here about 20 min before closing the line was still down the block. Yikes we might not make it! But, alas, we did :) There were 5 of us so we all got to taste quite a few combo's of goodness. Me - Salted Carmel + Roasted Banana - personally I think I choose wisest as it both were wonderfully sweet - but not too sweet. and the fruity creamyness of the banana complimented the carmel quite nicely. Hubs - Ricanelas - so freakin' amazingly good I can't remember what other flavor he got. This I thinks should be on the Big Eats list instead of the carmel Friend 1 - a double dose of salted carmel. Not that the flavor isn't good- but - heloo - boooooooring! Get another flavor! But he was happy with it. Brother - Banana-kiwi sorbet! Sour, sweet and creamy at the same time. Delicious! Momma - Honey Lavender - A flavor just like my mom, relaxed, sweet and welcoming. The lavender is such a unique thing to taste rather than smell. They did it well. Dad - weirdo - Lemon + chocolate something. Not a good combo andhe admitted it wasn't good. Each individual really good, but together in a cup - kinda weird - not the perfect pair. We loved it and will be back as often as we possibly can.

yes... Yes... YES... YES!!!! So far we've tried two of the ice cream sandwiches, a pint of the Salted Caramel, and a brownie sundae... all were freekin' glorious! We even ate the sundae outdoors during this wack-a-doo cold snap that slaps you in the face the second you step out the door. What a lovely, perfect addition to the nirvana that is 18th betwixt dolores and guererro. we are now ready to brave the Sam's sundae (chocolate, olive oil, and sea salt, really!) on our next visit, it sounds superbulous.

i'm not the biggest ice cream fan, i actually have to be convinced to go get ice cream most of the time but bi-rite has changed all that, i still don't suggest it most of the time but when the ice cream scheme involves bi-rite there is no need to convince.. top flavors- salted caramel - perhaps the best ice cream on earth balsamic strawberry - paradoxically also the best ice cream on earth... honey lavender - taste like soap, but i can't avoid it, so tasty peanut butter - tastes like frozen peanut butter, enough said lemon - i've not had a fresher tasting ice cream in my mouth ever EAT THEIR ICECREAM

i prefer haagen daz over mitchell's and swensons. i read about the salted caramel at birite. Êi already am in love with haagen daz's fleur de sel caramel ice cream, so i wondered...how good could bi rite be? Êwell, damn it was good. Êit was smooth and creamy and all the salty/sweet flavors made me say "mmm" out loud after each bite. Êwe walked over to dolores park on this glorious day, but i scarfed my down even before we plopped down on the grass. the honey lavendar is delicious too, but lavendar is really an acquired taste. Êsome people think it tastes like soap. i love it. Êwell done, bi rite!

I'm a hardcore Mitchell's fan, but my friend kept talking about this place, blah blah salted carmel, blah blah honey lavender. So I went. I walked in, in kindof a daze. There was no line when I went, and the staff wasn't too helpful. I looked around, confused as all hell, then just went with pre-packed salted carmel and honey lavender. Honestly on service I'd rate these guys lower but...... This ice cream is SOOOOOOOO creamy. even right out of the freezer!!! The salted carmel wasn't totally my thing, but the honey lavender was! totally right up my alley and the best thing I put in my mouth that week. I def. want to go back and try other flavors!

Yummy is the word! ÊI haven't spent a lot of time in the Mission since moving to the Western part of town, but I am "rediscovering" my old stomping grounds and finding some wonderful "new" additions, Bi-Rite being one of them. ÊThe salted caramel was delish, but I think my favorites were the toasted coconut (megayummy) and the coffee toffee. I tried the soft serve, but I think the regular ice cream is better. ÊBeing an old married type I am Êwoefully behind the times, but I am excited to see this growing trend of creative and new food in the Mission (and else where) and plan to explore more..

where do i even begin!?? i love everything about this place .. minus the parking that is. haha everything i've tried here is amazing. their ice creams are full of flavor! i never knew that ice cream could taste so good until i went here. everything is made with natural ingredients, which definitely makes a huge difference. coffee toffee is my favorite. i'm willing to make a road trip from sj just to buy a pint. *drool...* the coffee toffee sundae is pretty awesome as well. and yes, i admit .. i ate the whole sundae by myself. but it was worth it! salted caramel is also a must try! this seems to be the crowd favorite, which i can clearly taste why. balsamic strawberry is quite tasty as well. i was a little drawn back by the name, but trust me! it's really good. long story short, you gotta try this place!! you won't regret it. the staff is extremely friendly. the line tends to be a bit long, even on cold, late nights, but the quick service usually speeds up the wait.

How good is this ice cream? Good enough that we served Bi-Rite ice cream cakes as our wedding cake. Good enough that prior to serving Bi-Rite ice cream cake as our wedding cake, we did a "test run" where we bought a cooler and dry ice to test how long the cake would remain frozen on a trip down to the south bay. Good enough that my husband and I have driven an hour each way from the south bay and back just to buy a pint to bring home. Bi-rite is basically as good as ice cream gets. Texture - perfect. Creaminess- perfect. Flavors-great. The only negative thing I can say about Bi-rite is that they don't rotate flavors, and I'm generally one to really enjoy variety. However, I like the honey lavender flavor enough that I don't actually mind getting the same thing every single time I go there. In the ice cream rankings of the Bay, Bi-Rite has been at the top of my list for a while. Better than Ici, better than Humphrey Slocombe. The only other place I think is a possible contender is the fairly new Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous... but I have to go back a few more times to make my final judgement on that one. Another nice thing about Bi-rite is that their spoons and cups are compostable. 10 points to Gryffindor for being green.

i'm a kind of person that likes to try different things. so once i ate ice cream here (only once) i just can't bring myself to buy anything at baskin robbins anymore. i'd definitely come here again if i was in the area. when my co-worker told me about this place, i was like what? salted caramel? that's just odd. but i went and got a scoop of that and a scoop of chocolate soy. i was in ice cream heaven. who would have thought that something like "salted caramel" could be so frickin' yummy? mmm...salted caramel....

There is a good reason why bi-rite has 1800+ reviews and almost 5 stars. Im certain those reviews cover the ice cream which is indeed exceptional. I went on an evening that was COLD to avoid the queue (and that I did). The girl that served me (Mercedes) was super nice and greeted her customers with warm welcoming smiles...it goes a long ways in my book. Mercedes service + bi-rite product = winning combination.

If you don't have an hour to wait in the long line, just go straight to the freezer and grab a prepacked pint. I saw on Yelp that they were known for their salted caramel, so I just grabbed a few and paid for it. OMG, so good! ÊTheir Strawberry basil is pretty good too.

who the heck puts olive oil and sea salt on their chocolate ice cream anyway? i effin do! man don't knock it until you try it. it has a perfect balance between sweet and saltiness. the olive oil has a citrus element to it making it so flavourful . what an amazing way to serve ice cream that practically nobody on the planet has ever done. line ups are long and this place is famous so be prepared to wait a while. also you might want to try the salty caramel.

Oh my God..two words. Salted caramel. Absolutely heavenly. I'd heard so much about it so I figured since it's my first time I better start with what they're famous for. Wow! No words can describe its creamy, rich, sweet, salty deliciousness. You just have to go try it for yourself. I went on a Friday night around 10:30 after having dinner w/friends and felt like a little sum'pn sum'pn sweet for my ride home. I just double parked in the bus zone across the street and ran in (it was packed of course). Luckily I didn't get a ticket but it almost would've been worth it!

After hearing such great reviews about this place, I checked it out about a few weeks back. I ordered the lavender honey and toasted coconut as a single scoop. The toasted coconut was yummy, but the lavender honey was gross. It tasted like some Chinese herbal ointment. GROSS! I also felt as if I was eating lavender aromatherapy oil. Next time, I'm going to stick with something "ordinary".

Get ready to cream your pants ... Êeww! Get your heads out of the gutter. This place is so stellar you might drop your cup causing you to spill your ice cream all over your pants and exposed feet. I went with a visiting friend from Texas. He's a bottomless pit and claims he knows the best places for all food groups. Seriously, he claimed Cold Stone Creamery holds top reign (what a fool). So we were sitting in Dolores Park and watching a drunkard harass a group of stoners in front of us. And then, I began to crave ice cream (it could have been the man's bourbon bottle). So I pulled him over to Bi-Rite across the corner. The line extended all the way to the corner of Dolores and 18th. I cannot stand lines but I vaguely remembered a coworker mentioning this place as the best spot for local homemade ice cream. I skeptically stood with my arms crossed and sneered at the crying baby to my right. My pessimistic self reached the counter and chose the Toasted Coconut as my friend ordered Malted Vanilla. Boring right? Far from anything simple. The flavors of churned cream coated my mouth as my sweet spot sang for joy. The bits of coconut were chewy and nutty (I needed a moment). Now just saying, if you are going to do it, cream your pants over this. Not yanking your chain...or anything else for that matter.

The ice cream was fantastic - I had the cherry almond and the ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodle bits). Delicious! The ricanelas was great - cinnamon-y like horchata, not cinnamon-y like a Red Hot - and the snickerdoodle bits got all moist and awesome. The cherry almond was my favorite though. Delicate almond flavor and big chunks of cherry and sliced almonds. The line was pretty long since it was unexpectedly warm today, but it moved very quickly. There are some benches outside and the Creamery is just across the street from Dolores Park. Next time I'll try an ice cream sandwich!

okay, so i'm kind of bias when everyone says "this is the best ______ ever!"... cause when people do that i have high expectations. and when i have high expectations, i usually get disappointed. therefore, instead of having high expectations, i go into a new food place thinking "watch, i'm not even going to like it" and then try to find every fault i can to not make me like it. this isn't the case with Bi-Rite. i seriously LOVED the ice cream here the first time i tried it. now i know why people wait in long lines to get this ice cream. i loved the selection of flavors. the honey lavender actually tastes like honey and lavender. i like the the rituals coffee toffee and salted caramel. this place brings the hefferness of me out... holla!

I'm kind of over the whole "just because its weird, its better" thing. Don't get me wrong Bi-Rite is good, creative, and independent ,and I like all those things. The staff is super efficient and friendly and they have cute baking stuff up front. The Balsamic strawberry kills it, and the Salted Caramel is pretty ridiculously awesome, but for me its kinda like new wave California pizza. Yeah, its different and tastes good and all, but somethings just wrong. The consistency is almost always off, and unless there's toffee in it I don't want my ice cream to seem brittle. I think when it comes to ice cream this place is definitely worth a go or two but I'm sticking with Swensen's and Mitchell's. Their ice cream does what Êits supposed to do, cool you off on a hot day, give you a big ass grin and make you feel like a kid. Sorry, Bi Rite but your fancy flavors and holier than thou patrons never have. 3 and a half.

This place vies with the Bombay Creamery for my second favorite ice cream shop. ÊOnly Ici is better. ÊWhen my friend told me we had to go to Bi-Rite for ice cream, I was sketched out at first. ÊThe only Bi-Rite I'd ever heard of was a club discount chain store more seedy than a strip mall Rite-Aid. ÊOne look at the flavors and I was a convert. ÊMy favorite is ricanelas, a snickerdoodle and cinnamon ice cream. ÊI'm a big fan of chewy chunks of stuff in ice cream. ÊBi-Rite has a good balance of brightly flavored, sophisticated ice cream and ice cream with candy or cookies in it. ÊThe price is reasonable, way less than Ici for ice cream that is almost as good. ÊI like that I can get two flavors in a single scoop. ÊThe only disappointment: they don't have good cones.

In response to Tiffany's Review and her thoughts on Plastic Spoons, maybe because they are trying to do the right thing for the environment. ÊPerhaps you haven't watched the news lately or read the newspaper, but there is something going on called "global warming" and plastic is a major contributor. ÊSo, Bi-Rite, I praise you and Tiffany, you should be ashamed of yourself.

I came here with a girl friend on one of the week nights. Parking was crazy!!! After circling around for nearly 20 minutes, I found a parking a block away. =) ÊWhen I got there, the line was LONG and it was COLD outside. I had the dark chocolate cookie mint chocolate chip ice cream sandwich. It was DELICIOUS! Definitely worth the wait in the cold! I also tried the vanilla lavender flavor that the lady working there recommended and it was good. There are benches outside for people to hang out. I would definitely come back on a nice warm night to sit out and have an ice cream sandwich again.

long lines and more expensive than your average corner ice cream shop. but the build-up is worth it. bi-rite is right next to dolores park so enjoy your ice cream on the lawn. birite's flavors are unusual. but theyre SO good. you can try samples of any of the flavors but my favorites are: -balsamic strawberry -brown butter pecan -earl grey tea -ricanela's and one that was beer-flavored ..some of the flavors change but others are pretty standard.

Let the ice cream wars begin.....Bi-Rite/Humphrey Slocum/Mitchell's?? Bi-Rite has some really good scoops and is among the best in SF if not the best. Salted Carmel ice cream is my favorite there. There are so many amazing flavors to choose from though. The lines can be a little long on nice days, but totally worth it since you can take your amazing scoops out to Delores Park across the street to enjoy.

460 reviews and going strong. Instead of another "oh so delicious" review, let me tell tell you why I was tempted to try Bi-Rite. Of course it includes the fact that Bi-Rite consistently ranks on Yelp's most popular and most reviewed lists, but also because I'm one of those suckers that just needs to see what the hype is all about and simply cannot feel left out. I must consistently be in-the-know and around the up-and-coming hotspots. So when the weather gods granted us San Franciscans a rare warm sunny day, I took the opportunity to try the wildly popular salted caramel and I was not disappointed. Bi-Rite offers flavors aside from the usual vanilla and chocolate, so you must give it a try so you can say, "been there, done that".

never really disappointed as long as i stick to what my palate likes best, but if i were to be adventurous, bi-rite seems to be a great place to try it out since you can taste little samples! on the "hot" days, there usually is a long line in front, so if you are spending a lazy afternoon in the mission grab an ice cream, go to tartine for a bite to eat, and lay out in delores park and people watch, dog watch, Êplay frisbee, etc. its a nice neighborhood full of cafes. i really liked the lavender ice cream. creamy, fragrant and vanilla-y they give you a pretty healthy serving for 'one scoop'. i would sum it up as "the gelato eater's ice cream". they have a great selection of sundae's and you can build your own sundaes. you really can't go wrong here.

sorry mitchell's, i'm a bi-rite girl. Êwhat a perfect location across from Dolores park! Êevery time i'm at the park now, even if i'm not hungry (or just about to eat dinner), i have to get me some bi-rite. even though the line is always long, it moves quickly enough, and their flavors are posted outside, so people don't have to cram inside or wait until they're at the counter to decide what they want. ÊI usually change my mind about ten times while I'm in line, and always end up getting more flavors than just one, which clearly is a sign that bi-rite has too much goodness on the menu. Ê The richness of the ice cream, yet dense smoothness reminds me slightly more of gelato, which is probably why it seems like such quality to me. ÊPlus their flavors are perfectly suited to my palate. ÊI'm particularly fond of the brown sugar with carmelized ginger swirl. ÊAnd while some people may find just a taste of the honey lavender to be good, I'll enjoy a whole scoop's worth because it's not an intense overpowering of lavender, (but it's certainly not your traditional chocolate or vanilla). I haven't met a flavor that doesn't taste like what it says it will, only it tastes like a fresh version of the ingredients rather than an over-sugared mass produced made-for-ice-cream taste. ÊI'm smitten with bi-rite, I just wished I lived close enough to be able to buy the pre-packed quarts and get them home before they melt (or are completely eaten!)

I love ice cream. I especially am a sucker for specialty, not- your- run -of the- mill- buy- in -the -freezer- section ice cream. I like all flavors, I'm a chocolate AND vanilla person. Having said this, I don't eat ice cream that often. Maybe once a month? Once every two months? So it isn't like I have a ice cream problem and certainly not anything resembling an addiction. HOWEVER. I happened to walk by Bi-Rite one fine Saturday afternoon (maybe one of the best days of my life, by the way) and stopped dead in my tracks. I told the gf, to go on and buy some beer for our afternoon at the park. Now, I had heard the hype, I have friends that are true ice cream addicts and they mention Bi-Rite like fundies mention Jesus. It was time to check it out. I waited in the enormously long line, but it didn't really bother me, that is the kind of bad ass day I was having. What to choose?/ That was probably the hardest part of my day. So many amazing looking choices, brown sugar pecan, balsamic strawberry, malted vanilla, the list goes on. And then there are the sundaes! It was a tough decision indeed. I ended up going for a simple two scoop in a cup. Balsamic strawberry and a rich caramel. Married and having their honeymoon in a cup for me to enjoy. Though the line was long, and the customers demanding, the Bi-Rite staff were nice and full of good humor. This was impressive, because having worked in an ice cream shop way back when, I know how grueling scooping ice cream for hours on end can be. You actually start to develop little bruises up and down your arm. So I paid, stepped out into the sunny Mission and had my first bite of heaven. I met my lady on the hill and kept smiling til that cup was empty.

If you love Ice cream- do not miss Bi-Rite if you are in the SF Bay area. We stopped in after a delightful sunny afternoon at Dolores Park, and although the line was long it was ABSOLUTELY 150% worth the wait! The flavors are rich and delicious, and the scoops are small so definitely get two! Ask the scoopers their favorite flavor- they won't disappoint, plus they will let you try as many as you like!

Mitchell's and Polly Ann's are really my favorite SF ice-cream joints, but Bi-Rite has now entered the picture big time! You really can't avoid one-of-a-kind flavors like Salted Caramel, Chai Spiced Milk Chocolate, and Roasted Banana! They also offer tasty ice cream sandwiches (get the Mint Chip), popsicles, cakes, cookies, and pies. With gourmet desserts, expect gourmet prices folks- and I thought their double scoops were not so double. Regardless, it's all "rite" going to Bi-Rite and I'll be back for more.

I love bi-rite so much I actually accost annoying tourists to recommend its divine presence. ÊThe other day I heard some tourists across the lobby of the hotel I was staying at in Union Square, and upon hearing the concierge recommend to them Coldstone as a good choice for a nice walk to get some ice cream, I flew over to somewhat breathlessly tell them that they just had to go to bi-rite because it was the most amazing thing in the city & they would forget everything else about SF and just remember bi-rite. ÊWell, they went and the next day I saw the concierge and he asked me for the directions to Bi-Rite because the couple had come back a couple hours later just totally in love with San Francisco and how it was the best ice cream that they had ever tasted and wow it was really a neat part of san francisco that they had no idea existed and how awesome it was.

Been here a few times, but never got the chance to write a review until now. The first time I came here and got the toffee coffee ice cream with salted caramel. They were both really good, except I had gone to bi-rite at night and the coffee ice cream kept me up until 5am. The coffee ice cream was basically grounded up espresso beans with chunks of toffee in it. I loved it, but I didn't love the fact that it kept me up for hours.

I'm not a big ice cream buff. My friend dragged me here for some overly priced ice cream after we had some overly priced pizza. I had the $6 banana split. It was pretty good but so is any banana split worth $6. I did, however, sample the salted caramel and I have to say, I bought a $12 pint of it. I ate the whole thing. I never eat a pint of ice cream. Needless to say, I will buy another pint of it. And if it came in a half gallon size, I would buy that even though I'd probably be out $50. Beats smoking.

I'm really a patisserie girl. I will choose cake and cookies over ice-cream any day until I was introduce to Bi-Rite Creamery. I had the roasted banana and double ginger. My friends had the honey lavender and salted caramel. It was all sooo delicious. There is a huge difference in homemade ice-cream versus Dryers. The quality of ingredients is very noticeable.

mine and danny e.'s perfect "date" night starts off like this: -eat at yamo a few blocks down -walk up to bi-rite -i get the single scoop with the ricanela (cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodle pieces) and honey lavender in a cone -we lick our ice cream cones on the walk back to the car...which is parked near yamo. -sometimes when hanging out at dolores park we will walk to bi-rite, pick up our respective cones and walk back to the grassy knoll. "date" nights are always awesome!!! also, extra extra stars to the employee who let us go in one night for our ice cream when we walked up just as they were closing their doors. danny and i let out a collective "awwww man!" as we walked up and the worker was kind enough to let us in to get our delicious bi-rite on! ps i never notice the hipsters at bi-rite, always seems to be families when i'm there. but i don't give a shit about them anyways cuz they're just out of towners who moved to the city and think they're all that cuz they live in san fuck-cisco. who cares!?!?

I had the butter pecan and cinnamon. The pecan was great, but the cinnamon tasted a bit too doughy.. like eating some snicker doodle cookiedough. For a sunny 80 degree day in SF the line went by pretty quickly. I prefer bi rite to humphry slocombe because of the more standard flavors.

oh how i love thee, let me count the ways... 1. salted caramel icecream: Êthe best flavor ice cream with the perfect flavor, texture and consistency. Êit melts fast so if you live far away good luck trying to get a tub home to your loved one. Êi've actually roasted some bananas and cut them into the ice cream, it enhanced it a little (not that it needed any help at all) 2. ÊRicanelas snickerdoodle icecream: i just love snickerdoodle, but man, when you put it in good icecream, it is divine. 3. Êmalted vanilla with peanut brittle and chocolate pieces 4. Êbalsamic strawberry, roasted banana and pretty much the entire menu. parking sucks, but i like this place a little better than humphry because they have more kid friendly icecreams and dolores park across the street.

I've ALWAYS wanted to go here since my cousins love their ice cream. What impresses me is that for an ice cream shop, they have over 3,000 yelp reviews. So I finally get the chance to go here last night w/Jan. Parking sucks here. We had to drive around a few times to find parking and eventually found a spot a few blocks away. What's funny though is that when we saw Bi-Rite, we saw that it was a crowded grocery. So we go inside thinking maybe the ice cream shop is in the back of the store...? We go back outside and I check the navigation on my phone about if we were at the right place or not and apparently Bi-Rite Creamery is down the street on the right. We felt pretty moded, but thought it was funny we got confused since they had the same name. Lol! Anyway, when we go inside we see it's a small shop and I wanted to try their Sam's Sundae since it sounds so odd I had to try it (btw, who is Sam and how did he create this odd combination?) I order that while Jan orders the banana split and I grab a pint of their famous salted caramel ice cream to take home. It's cool how w/their banana split, they pour a little sugar on the banana and then used a blow torch to caramelize it like creme brule. Never seen that done to a banana split before. We decide to eat our sundaes in the car since all the tables were taken. Jan's banana split was pretty good. He liked it as well. My Sam's Sundae on the other hand was very interesting tasting, but the salt they sprinkle on top was HELLA SUPER salty. I thought the chocolate ice cream, whip cream and the bergamot olive oil was interesting by itselt, but the salt hella threw it off for me. Jan didn't like the Sam's Sundae at all. He thought it was just weird. The salted caramel ice cream's really unique. You can really taste the buttery caramel flavor in it. Not too sweet yet not overwhelming w/caramel flavor. Really good! Reminds me of caramel corn, but in ice cream form. I'd definitely like to go back to try their other flavors. (4/5/11-Dammit Bi-Rite! Why is your salted caramel ice cream SOOO good?! I'm officially addicted that my fat ass has been going there every week to get some AND I'm about to head over there right now to get more quarts of it. Lol!)

One of the biggest things for me at this place are the size options. I love me some creamy ice cream especially when It comes in smaller sizes. I don't care how good it is, if your medium is like a gallon, I can't handle it. The flavors are simple and delicious. honey- lavender, chocolate- coconut and banana all completely delightful.

ÊTheir sundaes are also amazing, and they're generous with the toppings (homemade whipped cream, marcona almonds, fudge, etc.). ÊThe staff is nice too.

Where else can you go and get Lavendar ice cream! I was simply a visitor to San Fran when I tried Bi-Rite for the first time, but I became an instant fan. Things are simple but complex at the same time which sent my tastebuds into a frenzy. Being from LA where frozen yogurt is all the rage, it was nice to see a line of people who shared my preference for actual ice cream. So far the snickerdoodle is my favorite! Every time I go to SF, I make it a point to stop in and sample a new frozen delight, I encourage you to do the same.

This should be 4.5 stars. Great Ice cream, almost always a 20 minute wait though. This place has some of the best flavors ice cream imaginable. What I really like is that it all tastes light but flavorful unlike most ice cream places where it tastes super heavy. Like mentioned earlier there is almost always a line, weekends and weeknights. It moves quickly though. I like to try multiple flavors per visit but don't need 3 huge scoops of it. They offer small scoops in cup or cone. This way you can try 2-3 flavors for the same size as 1 regular sized flavor. My favorites: -Roasted Banana (So good and I am not even a huge fan of bananas) -Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle (Mmmmm) Dislikes: Note, these are still good, just not spectacular in my opinion. -Mint Chip (Very disappointing) -Salted Caramel (Eh, had a lot of hype but I wasn't impressed) This place is worth a try. Exotic flavors you can't get at most places. -

Ok, I admit to being ridiculously obsessed with the opening of this creamery. ÊI mean, after all, we have Mitchell's. ÊDoes it get better? YES! ÊThe salted caramel ice cream is so perfect, I could just keep on eating forever. ÊI'm going back for Sam's Sundae one day soon because it looks delicious.

ÊThe fourth was so salty it was almost inedible. ÊYou want it to have just a hint of salt, not taste like salty cream. ÊThe sweetness has to balance it or ick. ÊSo when I went back for my fifth pint, I told them about the last batch (my husband and friend, who have also loved this ice cream, agreed with me btw) being just way too salty, etc., and told them I'd like to sample the pint I was going to buy before I bought it because I really didn't want another pint from that batch again. ÊThey acted like I was putting them out and honestly? ÊIf I owned a business and someone had been there five times in the three weeks I'd been open, I think I would comp them the pint.

I don't get what the big deal is. Their ice cream is overly sweet and tastes exactly like Cold stone creamery, too creamy. I had four different flavors, the ginger, white chocolate with a raspberry swirl, salted caramel, and malted vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate pieces. All were cloyingly sweet except for the ginger ice cream. It was the perfect amount of ginger and wasn't too creamy and heavy.

In my neverending search for the Best Ice Cream I finally made it to Bi-rite Creamery today. Was it worth driving around for 20 mins looking for a parking spot on a Sunday - yes. Was it worth the walk 5 blocks on the windiest day so far this year - yes. Was it worth waiting in a line over 20 mins that stretched out the door and around the block Ê- yes. I tried 5 flavors. Toasted Coconut - not a big cocount fan so this one was just ok. Coffee Toffee - yummmm. Thin Mint - yummmm. White Choc Rasberry swirl - yummmm. Cookies and Cream - yummmm. I really was not expecting it to taste this good or to be worth it, but I have to honestly say that it was and I'd do it again. Although next time I'll have to try the Sam's Sundae. I made a stop at Bi-Rite market on the walk back to the car and grabbed a pint of Rocky Road with Almonds - yummmm and cookies and cream. I love Bi-Rite market too. Maybe I was just really hungry but the Turkey and Swiss sandwich that I got to hold me over before I got my ice cream was delich!!

The first time I went there I had Salted Caramel and Honey Lavender. And the second time was this past weekend.. I ordered the exact same thing..! Can't get enough of it! Ice cream is nice on a sunny day, but there's something about cold rainy day that makes ice cream sooo good!! (maybe because of shorter line) The line for Bi-Rite can be super long..

I finally tried this place out. The ice cream is all organic, probably from happy cows, and very good! It's not very sweet, unlike ben and jerrys and baskin robbins. It's very creamy and perfect. I just don't live in SF so I wouldn't drive to the city just to eat ice cream there but if I was in the Mission, I would for sure go back and get a scoop of ice cream. You probably won't be happy with just one flavor choice but you can get 2 flavors in a single size scoop which was perfect! I had the strawberry balsamic and the banana flavors. The shop was small and the line went out the door. I liked that all their utensils (cups, spoons, napkins) you would use were all being recycled in a bin outside. They are very socially responsible and I loved the ice cream. Next time, gotta try the sandwiches.

Êthe thing that separates bi rite creamery from other places is that 1 they make their own ice cream and 2 the flavors are unique and phenomenal. If you like caramel then you have to try the salted caramel. Êthe mint chip was really good but my scoop had too many chocolate pieces in it Êi 'm sure the whole batch was not like that; Êi also loved the bold coffee flavor of the coffee toffee ice cream while the vanilla ice cream could have had a little stronger vanilla flavor but it was very tasty as it was. Êthe next time i go i'll buy a couple pints to go, Ê Viva La Ice Cream!

I ate here for breakfast. Actually, our group was staying in line for Tartine and told me to walk just two blocks and try this place in person for the very first time. I believed it opened at 11 and I got there at 10:55. There were just a few people waiting before me so there was barely a wait. I opted for the salted caramel since everyone says it's the most awesome. And it was very goot at the rate of 2.25 each kids scoop.

All Bi-Rite virgins must pop their cherries as soon as they get the chance to. Missing out on such flavors like salted caramel, balsamic strawberry, roasted banana, snickerdoodle, and HONEY LAVENDER is truly a sin! Go stand in that long line and think about why you haven't tried it already!

Ice cream, sex and sunshine are among my favorite things in the world. But since we are on the topic of ice cream i will have you know i am an ice cream conoseur and absolutely am always on a quest for the best. My personal favorite ice cream in the city is Birite Creamery. There is a reason there is a line around the block on any given Êsunny day. Their flavors are rich and real, no artificial or preservative crap. I love banana ice cream when its done right and their roasted banana is an orgasmic and creamy blend of real banana and brown sugar. Other flavors are just as decadent like salted caramel, balsamic strawberry, among others that make you salivate. ÊThe price is really reasonable too for the quality you are getting. And their home made fudge and toppings are made fresh daily. While they may be a really small business they are very efficient and the line moves fast. I also admire that they don't use plastic testing spoons for the environments sake, they use real metal spoons and compostable spoons and bowls. ÊAnd to put the cherry on top the staff's not too bad looking either... So next time you are near Dolores Park, wait in line (its so worth it) and go sit and the park and enjoy the genius

I had very high expectations for Bi-Rite, but it ended up being pretty disappointing. ÊI tried four flavors: salted caramel, honey lavender, brown sugar and ginger, and toasted coconut. ÊThe brown sugar and ginger was the best by far and was very good. ÊThe salted caramel was a bit too sweet. ÊI was most disappointed by the honey lavender; the lavender left an unpleasant soapy aftertaste. ÊThe toasted coconut was pretty good. ÊAll the ice creams were pretty rich. ÊI'd like to try some of the other flavors, but since I was disappointed with what seems like their most famous flavors, my expectations are much lower now.

The salted caramel blew my mind. Yes, it is a bit sweet, but there is no way I can criticize it for being too sweet. It is perfect the way it is!!! Flavors hit you in the face (or mouth) as soon as you take that first bite: creamy, slight burnt caramel, yummm. Seriously, after the first time I had the salted caramel, I thought and dreamed about it for the following weeks. Honey lavender tasted like a June wedding. Fragrant, creamy, and overall amazing. I love ice cream from this place so much, invested $40 bucks in pre-packed ice cream to bring home. Somewhat melting from the drive home from SF to Fremont, but I know it will be perfect again when I let it sit in the freezer for a couple of hours. Warning: Bi-Rite ice cream is extremely rich and creamy. ÊConsider this your splurge for the day. Unfortunately ice cream is my weakness, and Bi-Rite ice cream may just do me in someday.

The Salted Caramel is amazing and the Toasted Banana w/ Chocolate Curry bits has a nice flavor with a spicy bite to it. Don't be intimidated by the line, it progresses pretty fast.

Yesterday was that gorgeous random February day that happens every year when it's suddenly Spring... maybe even Summer... if only for a moment. It breaks my heart to know it won't last, and I was scared to celebrate it too much. But knowing Bi-Rite was so close to where we ended up having lunch was too tempting to resist. I have been on a real sweet and salty kick so I had to try that salted caramel ice cream! It was fantastic, it tasted so incredibly fresh. I always love lavender paired with another flavor, but I was a bit worried about the honey, I thought it might be too sweet, but it was perfect, I dare say I liked it better than the caramel! The hubs had coffee toffee and chai milk chocolate, they were fantastic as well, with little bits of toffee and chocolate to enjoy included in the ice cream. The next time I go I will have to try Sam's sundae, chocolate ice cream with olive oil and sea salt... sounds absolutely heavenly. Alas, today is a pleasant day but I can tell already our little taste of the sun is over. Thank goodness we enjoyed it with a little ice cream while we could.

fresh, local, and organic ice cream made to perfection! one of the best ive ever had! mmmm... so lickably delicious! after an hour of searching for parking i told the bf screw it... ill just pick up a cup for us and we'll just eat it in the car. just my luck, by the time i got their late friday night and there out of salted caramel ice cream! oh i was so bitterly dissapointed, especially coming from the east bay and having to pay a $4 dollar toll! i opted for a double scoop of chai spice milk chocolate and coffee tofee. damn, that was some good shit!! the chai spice milk chocolate is enough to keep me coming back! the ice cream was so incredibly creamy and i enjoyed surprise of little "crispies" inside. the chai spice milk chocolate had little bits of milk chocolate while the coffee tofee had bits of tofee. i also had a taste of the bf's cookies and cream. eh, didnt care much for it. after a few bites he asked me what flavor it was. not a good sign if you cant even make out what flavor it is. i tasted it and was dissapointed that the taste of milk over-powered the cookies and cream aspect of it. i retreated back to my scoops of goodness. cant wait to try the goat yogurt, roasted banana, and of course salted caramel. --- 5 stars: i am a loyal customer and cannot live without this place/restaurant! 4 stars: consistently great food. a place i would definitely frequent if i dont already. 3 stars: good food. id come back for more if a particular craving for something specific they offer hit me. 2 stars: for the sheer reason of convenience and semi mediocre food [but convenience being the majority of reason] id come back. 1 star: id never be caught dead in the place ever ever again.

They only offer two flavors of vegan ice cream but for non-dairy people like me, that's already more than enough =) I always go for the vegan chocolate coconut and it never disappoints. Great flavor and you can't even tell that's it non-dairy. Their waffle cones are non-dairy too which is a definite plus. There's always a line here after dinner but don't let the line intimidate you because the line moves quickly so the wait is usually only 10 minutes or so. It's worth it!

While everything i have ever heard about bi-rite has been a raving review or more, I didn't really care for the lavender honey ice cream. I thought the lavender flavor was a bit too strong and the honey was hardly there, if any to be found. I love lavender and the flavor of it, but it wasn't soft, it was a bit overpowering. I wish I could have given it a 4.5 or something higher, because they deserve more than just a 4...On the other hand, the BROWN SUGAR with caramelized ginger was outstanding. The people there are super nice, super helpful, and very patient with a newbie like me.

It's nice to get some ice cream here and take it across the street to Dolores Park and sit or lay in the grass with a friend. The individuals that work here are always so friendly and helpful as well. Definitely a must if you're in the City!

You'd think savory ice cream is weird, but this place makes it work. ÊFlavors like salted caramel, honey lavender, olive oil, balsamic strawberry, roasted banana--all strange, but Bi-Rite has got it down. ÊUsually we were told the line is insane and out the door, but because we came on a rainy Monday night, we thankfully only waited 5 min. ÊPer a request from our friend, we knew we'd be getting the salted caramel pint to go. ÊWe sampled the balsamic strawberry which was a burst of tart berries in our mouths but opted for the stranger honey lavender which was mildly sweet and just tasted clean and girly, if an ice cream can taste girly. ÊAmazing. ÊThe texture of the honey lavender was dense and creamy while the salted caramel was fluffier. ÊI prefer the denser ice cream. ÊAlso liked the other flavors more than salted caramel--I'm just not a fan of caramel (too sweet). ÊAt $7 a pint, it's no cheap treat, but still a cheaper option than buying it by the scoop. ÊI just wish we were here and had more time to try every single flavor.

Êmy friend had a sundae and she thought it was a bit overwhelmed with all the fixin's (ie. too high of a fixin's to ice cream ratio), but she was really impressed with the type of almonds they used.

I've tried the salted caramel, honey lavender, malted vanilla, and ricanelas. The ones I tried were really creamy and light, and the texture lacked the undesirable grainy sugary feel that some ice creams have. Ê Each were very tasty and unique in flavor in comparison to other ice cream parlors, but for me, nothing beats the ricanelas! ÊIts flavor resembles that of cinnamon toast crunch with milk. ÊSounds ridiculous that cinnamon toast crunch in the form of ice cream could be that amazing, but don't knock it until you try it. ÊI went back several times in one weekend for scoops in that flavor, and wanted to kick myself in the face for not having simply purchased a bucket of the ricanelas. ÊTry it out, and enjoy!

There really isn't anything bad to say about this place. After coming here at 10:30 on a Friday night (parking was ridiculous), the line moved very rapidly, and the servers were extremely friendly and willing to offer samples. $2.25 for a perfectly adequate kid's size cup.

crme frache ice cream?!? who has that!?! well apparently bi-rite does. along with such other delicious flavors as honey lavender, almond cranberry, cinnamon snickerdoodle, ginger and salted caramel. hot damn! basically what i'm getting at here is that we tried a LOT of ice cream and it was all fantastic. nothing tasted artificial or over the top. the flavors were spot on, with my personal favorites being the crme frache and the snickerdoodle. NOM! i must pause my praise to point out that my boyfriend ordered the sorbet and was quite disappointed. i, however, maintain that anyone who chooses sorbet over ice cream is clearly a fool and deserves to be punished.

If you're bored of the usual plain flavors, this is one of those place you want to check out. They definitely have some unique flavors like salted carmel, honey lavender, and I believe there was something with olive oil. Wait.. what? olive oil in ice cream??? Wierd but interesting. I had the Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces and wow it was good. Decent price for a typical scoop size, but the quality is definitely there. I don't even want to think about nutrition when it comes to something this creamy. Just enjoy and think about it later. Though I do have to say... parking is hell in that area.

Unbeknownst (Movie reference anyone?) to my knowledge I had already been here once before without realizing; I vaguely remember it was following the MP3 Experiment held in Dolores Park when ImprovEverywhere was in town. There is ALWAYS a line to this tiny creamery, but they damn well deserve it. You salivate as each customer comes out with their creamy smooth ice cream. The flavors are posted right outside the door, so before you make it to the front of the line, make sure you pick out your top five choices, so you can sample them before making your final decision. I tried a little bit of the Salted Caramel one and that was overwhelmingly sweet for me; to me, it seemed like an acquired taste, more like an acquired sweet tooth, personally, I lack one of those. I opted for the Earl Grey, which was extremely fragrant in Earl Grey fragrancy and the taste was just amazing! You can smell the infused lavender and black tea; it's unlike that of your ordinary green tea ice cream, which doesn't taste like green tea at all. The Meyer Lemon was, also, perfect. Smooth, creamy and the perfect tartness, I absolutely loved it. The short version: Meyer Lemon: Yum! Perfect balance of sweet and sour with an additional thumbs up for making a fruity flavor, creamy! Earl Grey: Delish! Sweet essences of the tea linger on your tongue and make you crave for more Salted Caramel: Please, don't hurt me for saying this. But it is definitely not something I would order again. They have a Vegan Banana choice and I've heard amazing things about it. I will definitely be coming back for more, especially for post-game-heartbreak-sorrow-drowning goodness. Btw, if you like the extra protein, make sure the guy smacks the bug that flew into the freezer above the flavor you're planning on engulfing. My friend found some critters legs in his ice cream, but that was okay, it was still AH-MAZING! Five stars even with the bug incident! HAHAHAHAHA!

I've only tried the salted caramel ice cream because we didn't want to wait in line. There were 4 ladies in our group and we finished the whole tub! The saltiness urges you to keep on savoring the ice cream. You might think that sweet and salty won't blend together but it was magic for the ice cream!

So i risked parking in front of a hydrant and and running in to get my ice cream. Salted caramel and strawberry (something). The ice cream was good but not worth getting a ticket over. I still prefer Mitchell's.

i tried the salted caramel, basil (not bad at all!), honey lavender, peach and ginger, roasted banana, coffee toffee, basically, i tried all the flavors & the employee was very generous with portions & patient with indecisiveness... and i decided to go with a cone with two scoops of ice cream: olive oil & honey lavender. although all the flavors were good, i wanted to get unique flavors i couldn't get elsewhere. so these were my picks & i was not disappointed. DELICIOUS.

despite the nippy december chill, the grand tales of bi-rite ice cream drew me ever near. i tried the salty caramel (omg so good!), coffee toffee (makes me wanna stay up all night so i can get my ice cream on!), and lavender honey (like eating a flower). Êone price, two flavors, and one very satisfied customer. can't wait to come back here and try EVERYTHING! i've been told the strawberry balsamic (which they didn't have when we went) is also very good. the tasting spoons are real metal (so that they can be washed and reused) and the ice cream "spoons" are little wooden paddles like you had in grade school. Êhow very eco-friendly SF hippie of them...

Although I am not a huge fan of ice cream, I am certainly a fan of Bi-Rite's salted caramel ice cream! This place makes fresh ice cream with organic ingredients. Couple this with their unique flavors and voil, you get ice cream that is as good as it gets! Makes non-ice cream lovers, love ice cream from this place. Nuff said. Go check it out for yourself.

on a hot day, this place is completely san francisco. on my day off, i happened to be sunning in dolores right after some ethiopian food in haight with some of my friends for lunch. the night before was crazy as hell, but we downed some water and took some pictures at dolores and everything seemed perfect. but what could make it even more perfect? two scoops of cookies and cream from this little heaven around the corner. it was such a hot day today, and so many people were strolling past our spot into the park with their bi-rite cones. somehow, no other place can make it quite like they can. i walked back to 16th and guerrero, and i couldn't stop smiling with my ice cream in my hand. i just feels that good. ;]

with 301 reviews already posted as i write this, what's more to be said that hasn't been said? well, how about this? it is great to have locally made ice cream. i do appreciate it. when i lived in philly i lived around the corner from a great place called "more than just ice cream", and it was death for my waistline. hell, i had a cone on my wedding day, ostensibly for good luck. of course the next morning we hit a deer on the way to her parent's place and four years later we were separated. so much for the positive talismanic effect of good ice cream. anyway...i was talking about bi-rite...what was my point? right...locally made ice cream=good. and this certainly is pretty good ice cream. it's just not the mouth-orgasm that you want it to be for the money they charge ($8 for a pint? wtf?!?). still, it's good. and close (on my way home from bart). and i'd never ever before had salted caramel. and they use local products, which i do love. so for that and for the fact that Êi've made a vow (what is it with me wrt vows and ice cream?) to only get never-eaten flavors from them...well, i'm glad they're in the 'hood.

Bi-Rite Creamery often has long lines on weekends, but its totally worth it. The ice cream flavors are much more interesting than any creamery I've been to. Its hard to describe what makes it so good, but its very clear when you taste it Sea Salt Caramel (5 stars) - The best is their signature sea salt caramel. Its noticeably salty so some less adventurous souls may not love it, but if you're looking for a new experience, this is the best one I've had. Its sweet, but also somewhat smoky. ÊIts really well balanced. ÊBrown butter pecan (4 stars) - It is like the best butter pecan you've had, but with the burnt smoky flavor that makes browned butter different from butter. Halfway through though it became a little overwhelming and tasted more like a more familiar butter pecan. Lavender honey (3 stars) - It was very interesting, but for my tastes, the lavender was just too strong and could have been better balanced with more honey flavor. Lavender can taste a little soapy and it tastes a little too soapy in this ice cream. Roasted Banana (4 stars) - This flavor starts out strong and interesting. Its never that fake candy banana flavor of other ice creams, but the roasted aspect comes through stronger at the beginning. By the time I was done with my kids cup though, it seemed a little more ordinary. Chai spiced milk chocolate (5 stars) - This one is just terrific. It has a very strong chai tea flavor that is all the better because it doesn't overwhelm the chocolate, yet it very potent. Milk chocolate describes it well because it is sweet and creamy, but not a really strong rich chocolatey flavor. One of my favorites. Mint chip (3 stars) - I don't like mint much so take this with a grain of sea salt. Its just fine, but by Bi-Rite standards, not that interesting and not better than other places. The mint is pretty strong and the chocolate chunks are pretty large. Peanut Butter with fleur de sel nuggets (5 stars) - I've tried this one but I don't know why I haven't ordered it because it was really great. I thought it might be too peanut buttery, but the taste I had was really impressive and I wish I had gotten it tonight instead of the roasted banana. Malted Vanilla with Peanut Butter (4 stars) - Tried a few bites of this one and really liked it. The malted part of the vanilla adds a lot and the peanut butter chunks were enjoyable.

Pasted by here on my way to Tartine and it looked pretty busy. So I decided to put it on my "to try" list. I ended up trying this place toward the later part of the evening. Finishing dinner with a girl, and wanted to have some desert...we decided this would be a good bet. We decided to swing by here grab a pint and head up to twin peaks. Vanilla Malt was the choice...and I have to say it was pretty damn good. If your near by, it's a great way to end the night.

This place is great, and I gotta give it props even though it does not have a lot of the more fruity flavors of ice cream that I normally go for.

When I grow up, I want to be an ice cream server for Bi-Rite Creamery so that I'll never have to choose only two flavors of ice cream at a time. *snaps back into reality* Given that I'm already grown up and like my current job as well, I'll have to settle for being a frequent customer - on a face recognition basis with one of the workers - at this ice cream store. The staff is incredibly friendly and always willing to give suggestions to customers about ice cream flavors and/or good combinations. They don't ever seem to mind it when customers take an extra long time sampling to make up their minds. This is why they're hired as servers and I'm not because it's annoying to have my ice cream delayed by the indecisiveness. I've tried almost all their flavors except the ginger and that's only because it's just ginger and nothing else to buffer the flavor. While Mitchell's specializes in tropical flavors, Bi-Rite specializes in combining All-American classics like snicker doodle or brown butter pecan. While it's near impossible to choose a favorite flavor - as hard as it is to choose your favorite child - I am partial to salted caramel and malted vanilla with peanut brittle. ÊTheir cookies are good too and given their small size, you'll even think that the cookie can fit into your diet. I'd avoid the one that's all dark (looks like it's complete chocolate) because that's a chocolate cookie with bacon bits. It isn't bad and it's true that bacon makes the world go round but I have different uses for the money that the cookie used up, such as a banana split sundae. They caramelize the banana with a blow torch right in front of you! Please don't go during the hours of 4:00 pm through 9:30 pm as you seriously delay my ability to devour ice cream as soon as humanly possible.

For being the 420th reviewer for this place, I'm sure I'm going to say what everyone else has already. But TRULY, You have NOT had the best ice cream until you've tried their Salted Caramel.

this place is really ironic. who would have guessed an ice cream shop that has a line coming out of it and going down the block every night? really its true. the great thing about it, is that my best friend lives right accross the street. literally. so it helps. i would say 90% of the time i go over to her house we go to bi-rite. everyone knows there ice cream is amazing, but why? what makes it so great? i mean sure its creative. who else has salted caramel ice cream? no to many places. your not getting that at cold stone. thats for sure. i enjoy this place because its close to the park, and hey, and ice cream shop next to a park?! you cant really go wrong there. every flavor i have had from bi-rite has been amazing. i havent tried them all, but someday i hope i will. the only reason i am not giving them 5 stars is because of the crazy lines. sure i know that is not their fault, but still it effect the way i feel about the business. all i can say to those bi-rite folks is thanks. thanks for taking the time to make some amazing ice cream for me and all the other folks in this city.

ÊOn a typical day, I actively avoid lines, which explains the infrequency of stopping here for cold cream.

After all this talk about Bi-Rite amongst friends, I had been anxious to stop by... Needless to stay I was thrilled and the sweets met everyone one of my expectations! There were an abundance of interesting and delicious sounding flavors. If there wasn't such a long line behind me (at 10pm mind you), I would have sampled all of them! ÊI ended up getting: 1) Creme Freshe (sp?)!!! ÊSo deliciously slurpiful... Im drooling right now just thinking about it. 2) Salted Caramel: really delicious, gets a little sweet towards the end but perfect combined with other flavors. 3) Butter Pecan (I think it was called something different actually): good but I was still obsessed mostly with #1. I cannot wait to go back and try all the other flavors! Not looking forward to the line all the way around the block though... + it is quite pricey for the amount you get. Oh well, won't stop me!

The best ice creamery in town. I have not found any place better. I like the salted caramel and ricanelas flavors the best. I go there almost every time I when I have the chance. I have been going there for years. Moreover, the quality of their products have remained consistently great. It is well made and the product presentation is good. At other places the ice cream is too soft or too hard, too sugary or they have Êice chips in it. Most of the flavors are pretty good and have the right amount sweetness, creaminess, and flavor intensity and complexity needed to make consuming the product enjoyable. The selection of flavors are good, some flavors are exotic. Though, not as exotic as the Bombay ice creamery. I highly reccomend this place.

Today its getting quite warm. Its 515pm...and I can't wait to rush home from work and get a scoop of bi rite icecream. I used to think, "WOW. salted caramel...yummm" but iv'e converted. Now, anytime the weather tops 70 degrees...i think "MUST HAVE orange cardamom!!!" Oh, it is truly divine. There's fresh orange zest, a light refreshing taste, but unlike any other orange confection. unlike sherbert, unlike creamsicles, unlike jambajuice orange dreammachine with a protein blast.

Over 2000 reviews, what more can I add? Just a note: if you love Bi-Rite so much that you want to introduce this to your family during Thanksgiving break/family reunion in a different state, you can! I simply googled something to the effect of "Can I bring ice cream on a plane?" and I got detailed explanations from some guy who had the same idea: transporting Bi-Rite to loved ones via air. Following his explicit instructions, I got me some dry ice and 4 pints of Bi-Rite and convinced TSA (Nov 2009) that it was okay for me to go on a flight with my precious goodies. It worked! In conclusion, Bi-Rite is so good, that I risked an evening spent with TSA at SFO to introduce Salted Caramel to my family. Thank God they loved it too. (FYI: If TSA was going to confiscate my ice cream, my backup plan was to have a friend who happened to be in the area, swing by SFO to pick it up and consume it to his delight. There is no way I'm letting that ice cream go to waste!)

ÊWe had just enjoyed a smorgie at My Tofu House and were looking forward to a nice dessert. ÊI had a scoop of salted caramel paired with butter pecan, and savored ever bite of it. ÊAbsolute confectionery perfection! ÊPJ enjoyed her trio of brown sugar, coffee toffee, and salted caramel. It was well worth the wait in a longish line.

Let me be the 2151st person to state that Bi-Rite creamery is delicous. Sure, it's pricey, sure it's a yuppie den, but just suck it up and enjoy some delicious iced cream, friends. SF only has Yuppies and Hipsters at this point anyhow. They can fight it out in the street Êwith fixed gear bicycles and SUVs and the loser can buy ice cream for the winners at Bi-Rite Creamery for all I care.

Delicious goodness is what this place is! I've heard a lot of great things about Bi-Rite and finally my sister, daughter, nephew and I made a trip over here yesterday. Good thing too cause it was 97 degrees out, yup no typo there it was 97 degrees in San Francisco. After getting a scoop each of the Salted Caramel, White Chocolate with blackberries and cookies and cream, I was in ice cream heaven. My 21-month old daughter did however help me with my three scoops and she loved it. Her sweet tooth is worst than mine so I decided to take home a pint each of the Salted Caramel and white chocolate with blackberries. On the way home, I didn't feel so guilty about missing Bikram cause it was worth the trip and many more to come(",) Oh and I did get a taste of the Balsamic Strawberry, I'll be taking a pint home the next time I'm there. I can't wait to go home and eat some Bi-Rite ice cream. Another plus is that they use organic products and that there are no artificial flavoring.

is it weird that i don't want my ice cream to taste like my earl grey tea? or that i don't want to taste what rose petals would be like converted into an ice cream? nor do i have any interest in tasting the honey lavender. maybe it's because i don't have a sophisticated palate. or maybe it's just because i don't feel like ice cream should be so complicated. so unnecessarily re vamped. to be honest, it freaks me out a little bit. but enough about the bad, let's talk yum. gotta love the ricanelas. cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodle cookie bits? yes please. banana ice cream with balsamic strawberry and chocolate? heck yes. love the cookies and cream as well. i will say i was feelin' swanky one night and decided to order a banana split, and after waiting almost a half hour in line, i ordered one thinking you couldn't pick yr own ice creams. i got my finished product and it was three scoops of just vanilla. HE DIDN'T EVEN ASK ME. I WAITED THAT LONG FOR A VANILLA SUNDAE. $6.50. screw that. thankfully i live relatively close so if i'm riding my bike by, i can see if they're line-less. if so, and the mood calls for it, sure i'll pick up some ice cream. if not, i'm headin' over to humphrey's. it's closer to home.. and my roommate works there. score.

because it's even mentioned in the same sentence as Mitchell's, that should be enough to get you to try Bi-Rite.

Whenever we go to San Francisco we generally stop by here on our way home. In my opinion Bi-Rite has the best ice cream in the Bay area. You get good portions for the price and the ice cream is so creamy and rich. ÊMy favorite flavors are malted vanilla and salted caramel. ÊThey have about 10-15 flavors that are unique and there is usually a line out the door with a 10-15 minute wait so be patient. ÊTrust me it's worth it.

Coming from the East Bay, there are two ice cream shops that pop out in my mind, Ici and Fentons. ÊIci had many unique flavors, but was not creamy whereas Fentons had thick and rich ice cream, but not the gourmet edge. ÊI feel that Bi-Rite is a merging of the two. ÊI split four scoops: salted caramel, ricanelas (snickerdoodle), toasted banana, and cookies and cream. ÊAll were tasty, but the best flavor was the caramel. ÊI definitely look forward to trying many of their other flavors.

Came here for the first time on a trip up north and heard about this place, so we thought we'd give it a try. If you're like other ppl, you might accidentally walk into the local grocery store that SELLS the bi-rite creamery products, but that's not where you want to go, you have to walk further down the street to the actual place where they sell the single serve ice creams...the store only has it in bulk qty. ÊJust look for the lines, you can't miss it. Ê Line was fairly long, but goes quick - it's only ice cream. ÊI had the toasted coconut and roasted banana flavors, which were really good. Finz had the chocolate(a little too rich for both of us), and our friends had the other flavors, can't even remember them all, but they even had the salted caramel - which was by far the best of the bunch. ÊI was recently introduced to the whole salty/sweet combo thing, and I have to say, it tastes A LOT better than it sounds(read: choc covered bacon). ÊBut most of the flavors were very good, save the chocolate one...oh yah, sampled the balsamic strawberry - it tasted more like real strawberries since they weren't as sweet. ÊNot too expensive tho, so a great place for dessert if you're in the area. ÊOh yeah, there was ONE flavor I didn't like too much in addition to the choc(I had to read another review to remind me)...the Honey Lavender; it tasted like I was eating flowers...albeit cold ones. Ê Parking - we took the Bart and walked, but parking looks like a major beyotch in this area Service - Very nice and friendly, and they help move the line along w/o much trouble. Ê I would definitely come again.

The ice cream looks really nice in the freezer. You can sample all of the available flavours. Last night was the first time that I tried the ice cream. And yes, it was creamy. I had the Salted Caramel. I had 2 scoops, in a cup. There is a freezer on the left which has the pre packaged pints of ice cream that you can buy and take home. Also on the left is a display of books and other things about food and desserts. There is no washroom for the public. We are taunted with the washroom door, but alas, it is for employee use only. The parking situation is a little cramped, but you should be able to find something. The parking police won't be trolling around for you. Anyway, even if it's cold outside, you should still give this a try.

I had the balsamic strawberry and ricanela ice cream and my boyfriend had the roasted banana and toasted coconut ice cream and they were all good. The ones that stood out were the roasted banana and the ricanela. I did try the the honey lavender and although it was good, I can't get over that lavender potpourri taste.

I will add my seal of approval to Bi-Rite. The place smelled delicious and sweet and yummy, and the selection (while limited) was very exotic. I'm not a huge ice cream person, but I craved a 4 scoop cone so that I could sample all the delicious flavors. And about the long line, I live near Swensen's which has sub-par ice cream and there's always a long line there too. If you're going to stand in line for ice cream, this is the place to do it....

My first time came to this place, was introduced with their famous salty caramel ice cream which I thought was really good paired with their butter pecan, which was very good as well. My eyes were locked into the balsamic strawberry but instead, I ordered cookies and cream because my hubby loves the flavor. So, maybe next time. Something to look forward to. I ordered the medium size (3 scoops). The ice cream was really good and I came at the right time (around 7 pm) because as I was leaving, I saw long line behind me.

WOW!! Screw polly ann's and Mitchell's. This place is the SHIT. I've never had ice cream as good as this. Their ice cream are homemade, not too sweet, and texture is perfect to taste. Creamy yet firm. A friend told me about this place and after a week of talking about it, he finally took me. It was a tuesday afternoon so it wasn't crowded at all. I tried their honey lavender ice cream and it blew me away. I felt like I was literally eating flowers. The fragrance of the lavender was so accurate but not overwhelming. It was too perfect! Went back again a week later with a different friend, this time it was on a weekend and damn it was crowded. The line went around the corner of the block. It was worth it!! They have some crazy flavors. Salted caramel (popular flavor), Roasted ÊBanana, Toffee Coffee, Ginger (yes, ginger! Not a fan of ginger but it was good!), Balsamic Strawberry, and much more! A must go. Bi-rite ice cream will not disappoint your taste buds.

Ok - not much to say after over a thousand reviews. Its high quality ice cream served in a cool trendy neighborhood. At almost $4 for a single(which is actually 2 scoops) i wasn't dying to go back for more. The flavors are more inventive than your average Ben and Jerry's, but I found a lot of them to be overly sweet for my palate. The toasted coconut and the malted vanilla with toffee was a bit too overwhelming, but my friend's balsamic strawberry was close to perfection. Its a great place to grab a cone and play with the neighborhood puppies, but for now it will stay an occasional indulgence when I am craving something different. My biggest gripe is the service is a bit brusque. I get that there is a line and some jackass is going to want to sample every flavor or take a million years to commit to their flavor, but treating me like a number and screaming "keep the line moving" makes me feel like I am in the big house and Bubba plans on making me his bitch. Not conducive to a feel good ice cream moment.

-Second Update- I have to update again because now that I've been back to Bi-Rite more times than I can remember, I'm a huge fan. What can I say? I was a slow convert. This ice cream is not for those who don't like fresh ingredients and rich, creamy flavor. I haven't had a single sample (or cup or cone) of ice cream that wasn't a great balance of taste and texture. The owner really takes the time to think about her ingredients and flavor combinations. Another thing that's great about Bi-Rite that has nothing to do with its flavor is that everyone who works there is super nice. I would imagine that 1) working at a place like Bi-Rite might make one snobby because...you work at Bi-Rite. Come on. And 2) there's always a long line out the door and people (*cough* including me) always want a number of different samples. You could easily become snippy, snappy, snobby or sullen with customers but these folks don't. They're cheerful and don't hurry you along. -End of Second Update- -Update- I'm updating my review after having gone several more times to Bi-Rite. Like I said before, the ice cream is very creamy and the flavors are interesting, to say the least. Maybe the last time I went, the salted caramel was too salty and the ice cream was too creamy but this time, everything was perfect. May I recommend the salted caramel or the brown butter pecan? I went back after watching a "The Best Thing I Ever Ate" episode where one chef loved Sam's Sundae. The thought of olive oil on ice cream was initially a huge turn off but the more I thought about it, the more appealing it seemed. So the Boyfriend and I went, stood in the long line and finally got to the counter. The chocolate ice cream is the best I've ever had - perfectly textured, perfectly chocolatey, perfectly everything. The salt was overpowering and I made the Boyfriend eat the top layer of ice cream. The olive oil is pretty light and sweet - it's grassy (which is the type of OO I like) and almost citrusy. All in all, I wasn't a huge fan of the sundae but I'm a fan of Bi-Rite! -End of Update- I might lose what little influence I have by giving Bi-Rite three stars but I guess I like my ice cream less creamy. I love that the flavors are unique and the ice cream is handmade and the little things, like using metal spoons to offer tastings so as to cut back on waste makes Bi-Rite memorable. The ice cream is good, don't get me wrong.

Awesome! We heard about Sam's Sunday from Aida on Food Network. It was pretty interesting, with tropical olive oil (orangey) over two scoops of the richest, deepest chocolate ice cream ever, sprinkled with coarse salt and topped with a dallop of whipped cream. The combo was interesting, the best bites included the chunks of salt. Who knew ice cream and salt were so amazing together? We also tried the balsamic strawberry and the salted caramel. Double yum on those. Creamy, dreamy, and worth the wait.

The cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodle=best I've ever had. The texture alone will blow your mind. I also tried the vegan coconut chocolate and that was good. My BF tried Sam's Sundae as he had seen it on Food Network and it was just too salty... the olive oil part was good, but the sea salt. eh. We just couldn't hang. Everyone was raving about the salted caramel. The roasted banana was good also, but weak flavor.

Excellent ice cream shop. Tried the Salted Caramel. It was good and it's probably just me, but it was too salty for me. The Balsamic Strawberry was awesome. Not too impressed with the sugar cone they used but whatever. The people are laid back and let you try whatever you want. And they're not cheap with their samples either. Plus, Dolores Park is right outside. All good qualities for any ice cream parlor.

great interesting flavors ( honey lavender is my favorite). also, i think they may use recipes from David Lebovitz's "Perfect Scoop" which is my favorite ice cream cookbook and they also sell the book there. But this place get VERY crowded, Êthere is always a line out the door and choosing your flavor is a very rushed experience. As such, there is no place to enjoy your ice cream inside and barely space outside. not their fault but something to consider.

I have to agree the ice cream here is pretty good! And with 1800+ reviews, it says something!! Flavors sound a bit weird, but try it out! It's really good! There's a crazy wait, but luckily, I didn't have to wait because my friends waited in line for me. I'm not sure if I'd wait in line for this stuff. Hence the 4 stars. It is very good however. I had the salted caramel. The "saltiness" is great because it brings out the sweetness of the caramel. I also had the balsamic strawberry. It not Êyour typical sweet strawberry ice cream, the balsamic sounds weird, but it really adds another layer of flavor to the ice cream, that adds the tartiness. Very good! Thanks friends for waiting in line. There was a poor girl yacking her brain out from drinking too much!! It was only 10:30!! WEAKSAUCE!!!!!!!!!!

After trying Ici and Humphrey Slocombe, I am convinced Bi-Rite has the best ice cream in the bay area. ÊSalted Caramel is still ice cream perfection. ÊAnd Balsamic Strawberry is the best strawberry flavored ice cream in existence. ÊPaying $3+ for a single cup of ice cream is so worth it... this is a must try if you are ever in San Francisco.

Yesterday it was summer-hot and perfect for icecream. Of course they predicted that and anticipated the long line. Stars for organization and quickness. Long line, but it moved fast and of course the ice cream was totally worth the wait. Staff was super friendly and on top of it. They had kid size cones too, perfect for all the little ones who can't handle eating all the ice cream before it melts. Not much place to sit, a few benches outside but kitty corner to Dolores Park. I tried the coffee toffee... perfect blend of coffee flavor with tiny bits of tasty toffee. Salted caramel also yum for those who crave the sweet and salty taste. Decent price for top quality ice cream!

Some of the best darned ice cream I have ever had!! I opted for the Salted Caramel (the most perfect balance of salty sweets) because it was recommended to me by my foodie sister. Also, everyone else seemed to be doing it as well, I took the popularity of the flavor as a good sign. Is the secret ingredient the ambrosia of the heavens??? because DAYMN that was some GOOD STUFF. It was an insanely hot day and that ice cream sure did hit the spot!! I think the salt content in it made it melt a little faster but that does not matter because you'll be eating it so fast, there isn't time for it to melt much! SO yummy yummy in my tummy. If you're in the neighborhood DEFINITELY check this place out!

this place does not kid around with the strong flavors of their ice cream. Êsalted caramel was EXTREMELY salty! Êa couple of bites and we were done...anymore and we would have to load up on some bottled water. Ênot our favorite...just a-ok. Êwe also had a scoop of the ricanelas which i figured would be wonderful because of the snickerdoodle...it was good...very strong with the cinnamon...but much better than the salted caramel. Êwifey had a taste of the coffee toffee...once again, extreme in flavor. why the 4 stars? Êbecause the texture was really awesome...similar to a gelato...and the ice cream tasted really fresh.

I wouldn't dare give this Mission institution a poor review. There was a long line that wasn't an issue on a sunny day. The ice cream is super super rich, so the smallish portions (albeit reasonable price) aren't too small. I really enjoyed the salted caramel, but I wish they had a salted burnt caramel and maybe a gingerbread flavor or salted dark chocolate to complement it. Did NOT go well with the saturated honey lavender... wayy too lavendery for me. I would pair the Salted caramel with a more "regular" chocolate flavor like the cookies and cream. Enjoy!!

Came here with my boyfriend one night recently because i was craving ice cream and i wanted to try a new place. Got here and there was a long line maybe because it felt like a summer night.

We came at almost 9:30 on a Tuesday night, the line was out the door even though it was raining pretty hard. It was well worth the wait. The salted caramel was was too salty for me and I'm a little dissapointed that we walked out the door with a pint based off all the reviews. We probably should have tasted it first. The brown sugar was AMAZING, so amazing that I could drive to the City every night just to get my fix. The Lavender Honey was super strong at first, but then after I got used to the taste it didn't seem so strong. It was like soothing tea. The Banana was divine. My boyfriend and brother both got the malted vanilla and I somehow missed out on getting a taste of it. Next time. One thing they're missing out on is Milkshakes. That is the only thing that could possibly make this place any better!

FINALLY!! I made it to Bi-Rite. I was confused looking for the place, ended up at Bi Rite the grocery store looking around for a ice cream booth LOL!!! Well finally found the place across the street and down the block and boy was I happy! Then I was so excited I couldn't find the sign of flavors to choose from. Looking everywhere, I see sundaes, size price, but no flavors!! Panic panic it's almost my turn. I look to the FAR left side, oh there it is! So I got the balsamic strawberry and snickerdoodle cinnamon flavors and they were sooo good!!! The density of the ice cream was perfect! Nice and creamy and solid like I like it. I don't like my ice cream to be soft served when it's not called soft serve! I can't wait to go back. I went in the middle of the day on a weekday and it was busy but not weekend crazy line busy.

Have I really not written a review of this place yet?? What on earth has gotten into me? Quite simply, this is the absolute best place for ice cream on the plant. Period. The brown sugar ice cream with the roasted banana ice cream is my fave, although I am also partial to honey lavender. Occasionally, I just want some good ol' chocolate, and that is incredible and rich and creamy, too! I've also gotten their cookies, which are yummy, but the ice-cream is what to come for! Oh, and don't worry about the never-ending line that is a constant here; the line goes really quickly!

If anyone ever visits me, I make sure to take them to Bi-Rite, the icecream darling of San Francisco. ÊAll of their flavors are delicious, but if you must choose on two or three, I would suggest the honey lavender, salted caramel, and earl grey flavors.

salted caramel...WH-WHAT????? we were up in the bay area for the sf half marathon..and well, we were trying to carbo load for the run. hahah ice cream counts too right?=P as a rookie to bi-rite creamery, we made the initial mistake of walking into the bi-rite market! upon walking to the end of the market you see pints of bi-rite ice cream in the freezer. umm, where's the ice cream man handing out ice cream cones????? haha, lucky for us dunces...the bi-rite staff strategically placed a sign on the freezer informing us that they have another location serving smaller portions of their ice cream across the street. D'OH! so off we go and there you see the creamery - a few shops down from the market across the street. there's 2 separate lines..one for the frozen yogurt (which you can do mix-ins with the yogurt or go get their flavor of the day) and also some baked goods. then right past that you'll see the longer line for the ICE CREAM! yum!! i applaud the bi-rite staff bc the line was moving fairly quickly. too quick that my mind was racing on what 2 flavors of ice cream to get! you can ask to sample the flavors so that helped out in the DECISION! haha. plus there was a small group of us and we each got 2 flavors so that we could try out as many flavors as possible=). so here's the scoop: Salted Caramel - hands down, one of my favs out of them all! Êwish i lived closer so that i could bring a pint home with me! Honey Lavender - chose this over the Balsamic Strawberry to just offset the sweetness of the salted caramel. I liked it, quite refreshing and tastes like lavender tea. though my peers will argue with me that's it's too floral tasting..heheh to each their own. Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces - simple and sweet. so good. Balsamic Strawberry - don't let the name fool/scare you, flavor tastes like you're eating a fresh strawberry! Coffee Toffee & Chocolate - good on their own, but maybe too sweet to combine together? Toasted Coconut - a hit for all the coconut lovers! Roasted Banana - reminded me of eating a banana's foster=) the lady at the counter was super helpful and friendly sooo you know what that means...let's say the mantra together now: good service + good ice cream = thumbs up for bi-rite!!!

I love this place, and apparently so does everyone else in San Francisco because every time I come here there is a line out the door and around the corner. The first few times I got the roasted banana ice cream.. sooo good (I have some obsession with bananas in desserts). They have specials that have infused olive oil drizzled over vanilla ice cream, sounded intriguing so I gave it a try. Mine had blood-orange infused olive oil, and it was so great. Point is..

Can't believe that after living in the City for over 20 years and passing by many times before, we finally came here for first time tonight for what everyone has been raving all about: salted caramel ice cream! It was very flavorful and tasty along with the Honey Lavender I had in my single cup! My friend had the balsamic strawberry along with the white chocolate blueberry or raspberry swirl. It was not overly sweet or rich, but satisfying for my sweet tooth. The wait outside was about 20 minutes around the corner on this nice Labor Day holiday even at 9pm. Looking forward to coming back and trying the other flavors!

I wasn't sure I was in the right place...just so happened I was in the right place at the right TIME :) We went late afternoon and only had a couple people ahead of us, allowing plenty of time to make up our minds which flavors we wanted. Five stars for patiently letting us try as many as we wanted. Had to try the Honey Lavendar, as interesting as it was, I decided on Brown Butter Pecan and Salted Carmel. Both were delicious. The ice cream is soo creamy and I love the bio-degradable bowls and wood spoons. Very friendly service.

This is the 1631 review for Bi-Rite Creamery. I don't know if I can really say anything different from everything that has already been said. I had the Balsamic Strawberry and then Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl. It was really good ice cream.

Getting ice cream at Bi-Rite is like waiting in line to get into a club, but it's well worth it. I have never tasted the types of ice cream concoctions anywhere else.When you get to the front, they let you sample all the flavors you want without feeling rushed. ÊThe Salted Caramel and balsamic strawberry is eye roiling in the back of your head good. And if they run out of scoops of salted caramel, you can buy a pint. The ice cream melts quickly so you'll need to make it home fast or find the nearest freezer you can store it at.

Bi-Rite, so right. ÊOn a perfect or not so perfect day in the city, there's nothing better than a scoop of their salted caramel ice cream. ÊYou can see the line forming down the block as you're walking to the shop but let me guarantee you that the 15-20 minute wait is worth every minute. ÊMy second and third favorite flavors are ginger and mint chip.

The salted caramel has seriously changed my life. Tastes exactly like the burnt caramelized sugar of a perfect creme brulee. I'm house sitting for a friend that lives a block away and stored some in the freezer for the next day. Yes, again it was that good. It made me break out into song (well in my head)...I almost had a bollywood moment in my kitchen.

I'm sure anything I could say about Bi-Rite has already been mentioned by other yelpers, but the ice cream is definitely worth a modest wait. And, as I found out tonight, the frozen yogurt (pumpkin + vanilla swirl) is worth it too (and probably won't even have a line)! I really want to try the cupcakes one day too, but it's so hard to go and NOT get something ice creamy.

Wow.....that would be the word to sum up my experience. My friend and I walked up to the ice cream shop. I saw a major line coming out the door. I was a little worried. We waited for a few minutes and finally made our way up to the counter. I ordered a brownie sundae...and I was very pleased. It was wonderful. Actually...."yum" was the word I used to describe it. It was nice to know that the condiments were biodegradeable as well. The service was great...all smiles. They also sell cookbooks and t-shirts. I have to go back now so I can try all the other selections they offer.

Guilty pleasure number one after shoes and an addiction to clothes is gelato or gelato resembling products (um..that'd be ice cream). And there's one flava flav that I love: Rum Raisin. Which is why I can't give BR Creamery a fifth shurikin. That aside, it's freakin' heaven. Mitchells was my "go-to", but after sampling the Honey Lavender, Salted Carmel, Coffee Toffee and Chocolate...I have to reconsider. Actually, they're in two different leagues. Bi-Rite Creamery is a gourmet stop for flavorful ice cream. Mitchell's is your mainstay. One drawback is that Bi-Rite doesn't have that many gelato flavors. They need to seriously expand their gelato selection. Otherwise, love in a cone.

With over 600 reviews I can safely say it's been said by now - but I really enjoyed my ice cream today! We tasted a bunch of options and I finally settled on the toasted coconut and the banana. Phenomenal. I like the whole idea of this place. It's super cute and they're super nice, giving us a trillion samples and splitting scoops, which a lot of places get annoyed about. And you know it's freshly made with quality ingredients. Happiness. We lucked out and didn't get stuck in a line, and could take our time working out the order. As good as I'd hoped!

i love bi-rite ice cream. the lines don't feel too long... i like the quality better than mitchell's actually. everything tastes great, ricanela, mint chip, salted caramel, yums yums... i had a banana split yesterday though with a ricanela scoop, and my HEAD EXPLODED WITH JOY. ricanela is already wonderful: snickerdoodle in cinnamon ice cream. but then this was drizzled with fudge, and had half bananas on either side which were BRULEED! there was a smattering of walnuts and the whipped cream was SALTED. this is by far the best banana split of my life. you can't imagine my face when i first tasted it. i don't want to get too detailed, but basically imagine the ecstasy of st. teresa by bernini, and there you have it. my friends were backing away from me as i arched my back and howled while clutching the spoon to my bosom. need to try this honey lavender with hot fudge. i shy away from lavender in sweet things because i feel a little bit like i'm eating bed linens... but bi-rite can probably pull it off.

I love ice cream so I was looking forward to trying this place for the first time. ÊThe parking is terrible in this neighborhood so I had someone drop me off to pick up the goods. ÊI went at about 7:45pm on a Thursday night and there was no line. ÊI chose 3 pints to take home. Ê Salted caramel: ÊI've heard so many good things about this flavor and I happen to love caramel. ÊI thought it was fantastic! ÊThere's just something about the salty sweetness. ÊI felt the consistency was on the thin side and melted a bit too quickly. ÊIt also had a strong aftertaste, in a good way. ÊOverall, this flavor was terrific! Ê Brown butter pecan. ÊThe flavor wasn't very rich and it had bits of pecan in it. ÊIt was good, but I've had better versions. Ê Roasted banana. ÊThis one was great! ÊIt had a strong natural banana flavor and the consistency of this one was thicker than the salted caramel. Ê I felt like all three were on the airy/fluffy side. ÊMaybe that's just the way they make their ice cream. ÊIt's not like the thick, dense stuff, more like the slow/double churned Dryers ice cream consistency. ÊI guess I was expecting something heavier. ÊIt's not cheap either - pints was $7.99 each, which is pretty expensive for ice cream. ÊBut I would go back only for the flavors I can't find elsewhere, like the salted caramel.

Yes, it's expensive. True, the lines get long (but they move fast). Bottom line, though, it's the best ice cream in the city with the most creative list of flavors -- coffee toffee, honey lavender, burnt caramel, balsamic strawberry -- and it's located in the heart of a vibrant San Francisco neighborhood. Grab a cone, head to Dolores Park and let your worries subside with each lick!

this little ice cream store opened with a line wrapped around it and it's been that way ever since. yes, it is that good. sometimes i need a break from bi-rite, but that's because i live 2 blocks away and ice cream as dinner can become a too good ritual. a lot of peeps love the salted caramel, i did not enjoy it at all. my staple favs are roasted banana and honey lavender. right now, i'm loving the malted vanilla with peanut butter brittle and brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl. my friend got me an ice cream cake here recently, it was the smores cake - chocolate cake with a layer of marshmallows. it was SOOOO delicious. things to love: - free tastings of all the yumminess - sorbets, popsicles and vegan ice cream for the non-dairy fans - homemade whipped cream, just divine - vegan sprinkles - ice cream sandwiches!!! my fav is the strawberry with sugar snap cookies - caramelized bananas from the sundaes - cones are really tasty, no card board taste here! - biodegradable spoons & cups - loyalty card because when you go this much, a free cone is really a sweet thang...

A Creamery can only truly stand out, in my opinion, by two respects. Innovation, a difficulty task in a time ages after the invention of ice cream, and quality, a given. Bi-Rite Creamery is exceptional in both categories. Creativity? I don't know anywhere that can boast the claim to be greater. Quality? May I answer with a dare? I DARE you to find a place better. Salted Caramel with olive oil is such a culinarily stimulating idea and an absolute delight.

ohhgguh. my tummy aches. i ate 1/2 pint of salted caramel in about 10 minutes. so salty! so caramelly! though i don't necessarily mind what my body does after mass quantities of dairy, the people around me might have something to say about it. let's hope the torture waits till tomorrow to rear its nasty head. i envision the following, in my ice-cream induced fantasy: a 1950's style diner, with tall vinyl booths, a jukebox at every table, a long bar like the one at st francis soda fountain, and a rotating cake display. waitresses like my lady katie joy-- a little bit of attitude, a drizzling of sweetness, and the efficiency of a stockbroker--serving not diner food, and not even blue plate-style gourmet diner food, but tartine pastries, quiches, and sandwiches, as well as hot, fresh versions of what sits behind the birite market deli counter, and all the ice cream treats offered at birite creamery. this town has plenty of comfort food, but one thing that birite market, birite creamery, and tartine all have in common is their delicious products without enough places to sit. hence, the diner. designed for people to stay a while. what about in that old fabuloid/wang fat fish market spot on mission and 18? or where that new Stack's is going in, on hayes and octavia? or, right across the street from that--the old oxenrose has been sitting empty for the last 15 months. whaddya say?

Believe the hype. The Blue Bottle of Ice Creameries!!! You will have to wait during peak hours, but unlike Mitchell's Bi-Rite is worth the wait! Everything you have heard about the Salted Caramel is absolutely correct! I have not experienced a similar feeling since my first taste of Polly Ann Green Tea ice cream. I also loved the Ginger ice cream. Sooo strong, even for my jaded tongue. The sundaes feature delicious whip cream and a great assortment of nuts, which I am sure considering the aura of this place probably were grown organically with no harm to the surrounding soil, and great care taken not to bruise the nuts...ouch!...but I digress. I loved the blueberry compote topping. Very fresh and more fruit than jam, which is a plus, except that the topping really drowned out the flavor of the ice cream, surprising considering how strong the ice cream is. I recommend a simple double or triple cone to get the best flavor experience.

i was intro-ed to bi-rite last year when a friend was visiting and did i fall in love with this place! the friend of the friend told us that they had salted caramel, honey lavender and other flavors that they make and we were both intrigued i got the honey lavender and even tho it sounds weird to be eating something lavender flavored, it tastes exactly how it smells, but even better w/the honey in it...my friend got the salted caramel and it was an interesting flavor but had the balance of the sweet/saltiness that i like i took my bf there earlier this year and he got the snickerdoodle concoction and he loved it...i sampled a little and wished i should've gotten that instead b/c it tasted just like my favorite cookie! every time i've gone, the line is always long, but its worth the wait to satisfy my bi-rite cravings!

Bi-Rite really doesn't need another 5 star review but here it is anyway, more to boost my own review count than anything else! It took some convincing to get my brothers to come all the way out here with me, especially since the younger one was craving some Mitchell's mango and they were NOT intrigued by the salted caramel flavor. Once they saw the line out the door on a freezing and windy SF summer night, they were convinced that this place "had to be good". We lucked out with gangsta parking and discussed our flavor choices while we waited in line. I went with salted caramel and ricanelas (snickerdoodle), the bros tried combos of the basalmic strawberry, roasted banana and ricanelas. After tasting my cone I decided that there is too much hype over the salted caramel. Don't get me wrong, it was super tasty but man, that snickerdoodle flavor was like SOO much better! Why isn't there more hype about the snickerdoodle? It's expensive, but luckily I only get cravings for ice cream every once in a while. I'm looking forward to picking up a cone on a sunny weekend and taking it across the street to Dolores Park to soak up some sun.

the honey lavender ice cream reminded me of eating weeds. Êyes, i've eaten weeds, and it tasted like this flavor. i couldn't really taste the ginger in the brown sugar with ginger, but i really liked it nonetheless. the chocolate was way rich. Êrich like you're actually eating a block of chocolate in each spoonful. Êi can see some people liking that. Êit made me went back for more weeds.

mmmmmmmm salted caramel............. enough said. At first bite when I sampled the salted caramel...I was thinkin' mmm maybe not. But I had to try their chocolate, and what goes best with chocolate then salted caramel! It's such a splendid idea for an ice cream, I ask why other brands dont sell it at the grocery store? Maybe because it wouldn't live up to how yummy the Bi-Rite flavor is. Be warned, that while it is 5.6 miles away from the SF bridge (so my yelp app told me) it's a rather far detour when trying to get back to the east bay. Worth it? Well, the 25min line was worth it, but I am not sure if I would make a big detour again. If we happen to be in those parts of the city then yes. The hubby had the Sam's Sundae and it was gross. The olive oil, really tastes like olive oil, and its not yummy. We recommend avoiding it, even if it was featured on Food Network...

I now know what their salted caramel tastes like! Some people say it's too sweet for their taste, but if you are a fan of See's Candies butterscotch lollipop, then that's exactly what Bi-Rite's salted caramel ice cream tastes like, but in ice cream form! It tastes dead-on the same!

Returned to Bi-Rite and tried Sam's Sundae, which consists of chocolate ice cream, whipped cream, bergamot olive oil and sea salt. ÊWhile the chocolate ice cream was really tasty, the sea salt was totally overwhelming. ÊUsually the salt v. sweet flavor combination works well, but in this case, the sea salt was a bit too much.

It makes me sad that I did not become aware of the existence of Bi-Rite until a conversation with a friend of mine in December who lived in San Francisco for a few years. ÊI don't know how long they've been open, but I would have been a regular here for decades had I known of its existence (and be about 20 pounds heavier). I stopped by here for good solid ice cream in a somewhat cramped space at the end of 18th and Dolores after stopping by Tartine Bakery for a requisite bread pick-up stop. ÊYes, it's too cold for ice cream, but I needed to try this and I was glad that I did. ÊThe honey lavendar ice cream is lovely, you can taste both the honey and the lavendar and neither overwhelms the other (which is what happens frequently with attempts at mixing honey and lavendar in ice cream or other desserts, as they are two flavor profiles that I love together and separately). ÊI tasted the Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl and loved it and should have gotten this in my small cup of ice cream, but instead I got the Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces, which I found disappointing. ÊThe peanut brittle overwhelms the malted vanilla and creates for a bitter taste that I didn't like at all. ÊI should have gotten the brown sugar instead. I was glad that the line was on the short side and moves rather quickly, unlike the line at Tartine Bakery. ÊYou know I am a New Yorker when I think that two scopes of ice cream for $3.95 is not too bad for a creamery that makes its own ice cream using fresh ingredients (or in the corporate lingo "in a responsible and sustainable manner"). ÊI enjoyed sampling ice cream on actual metal spoons rather than the plastic ones that you get from most gelato/ice cream places. ÊI just wished that they had more seating, as I didn't really care for sitting outside the store on the benches that surrounded the trees on the street, but I was happy to sit and was glad that the seats were rather clean. ÊThank you Ned for the suggestion, I will go into my sugar coma now.

It was a sunny day. ÊWe drove by, saw the line, but still looked for parking. ÊI had been wanting to try their ice cream out, but am rarely in the neighborhood. ÊWe waited in line for about 15 minutes, which gave me enough time to decide on my two flavors. ÊI picked Salted Caramel and Honey Lavender. ÊYes, the scoops are small, but that was okay by me. ÊSometimes you just gotta pay the price for something better. ÊThe Salted Caramel was beyond belief. ÊThe ice cream itself is so creamy and smooth. ÊThe flavor was simply amazing. ÊTo be honest, I don't remember much about the Honey Lavender. ÊIt tasted like it should and was good, but not my favorite. ÊI guess it would work for someone who really likes those two together. ÊFortunately for us, there was seating inside, along the side with the windows. ÊIt was a busy day and folks were sitting on benches outside, too. ÊThe line does move fast, so for the indecisive folks, make sure to get your flavors down by the time you get to the front of the line. Ê I have a fellow sweet tooth friend whom I'm trying to convince needs to try the Salted Caramel out, because I know he would fall madly and deeply in love with it. ÊHe is grossed out though, by the thought of salt and caramel together. ÊIn his mind, that combo doesn't work. ÊHELLO??? ÊWhat about salted caramel chocolates? ÊI guess he's never had those before. ÊAnyway, wouldn't you know it? ÊA friend gave me an entire pint of the Salted Caramel a few weeks later for doing her a favor. ÊBelieve it or not, I managed to make it last for over a week in my freezer. ÊAbout every other day, I would take it out, scoop out little, and just savor the salty sweetness. ÊI hate to say it, but OMG! ÊI Êwould pretty much try and lick the bowl clean each time. Ê Well, I guess that's why you get a pint, so you can get away with behavior like this in the privacy of your own home. ÊIf I go back, I'll try out the other flavors, but it will have to be paired with a scoop of the Salted Caramel. Whatever they do and however they're doing it, I hope Bi-Rite Creamery continues to do it. ÊAnd don't ever discontinue the Salted Caramel!

Bi-Rite is... good. ÊReally good. ÊIt just isn't to die for, amazing, unbelievable like it would have to be to deserve the hype it gets and its 2000+ reviews. ÊIt reminds me of Pinks in LA... it would have to be *astonishing* to stand in that line, and it's not. ÊIt's also not cheap. ÊThe flavors are nice, but unusual ice cream flavors are more common these days, so once again the line is quite a disincentive. ÊSome of the flavors actually strike me as a little heavy-handed, like the brown butter pecan... it's just a little too much. ÊAnyway, if you are one of the few members of the species who haven't tried it yet, you should... maybe if you go at an off time on a really icy day you won't have to stand in line that long. ÊThen again, maybe you will.

I LOVE their salted caramel ice cream! I came here with a co-worker after work on a hot day in San Francisco. ÊThe weather was rare because San Francisco generally does not get very hot. ÊHowever, the temperature was in the 80s. ÊWhen we came here, there was a long time. We expected it because this place was highly rated and it was so hot. ÊMy co-worker came here before and recommended that I get the salted caramel because she says it's not your usual ice cream from Safeway or other drug stores. ÊI heeded to her advice and got it. Boy was I surprised!!! The salted caramel was salty, sweet, and creamy. It absolutely melted in my mouth like butter. ÊIt's soooo delicious that I wished I bought a tub home for my fiancee to try. ÊI got my ice-cream in a cone and I gobbled it up in less than 5 minutes. ÊIf you ever come here, you need to try their salted caramel flavor. ÊI will definitely come back for their ice-cream!

(Damn, 340th person to review this place, they are hot) The ice cream is one of the BEST ice creams ever. They even caramelize the banana in the banana split so that it has the hard thin browned sugar skin that creme brule has. ÊStill, i like ice cream plain best, and it's good to eat it like that here because you get it in one of their compostable bowls with a flat wooden paddle stick-spoon, both which are awfully elitist-but-in-that-stylish-cute-way. ÊBut the ice cream is so good that the wooden taste from the little paddle stick spoon gets a little invasive. ÊIf you get a sundae you get a compostable plastic-ish spoon instead. Every ice cream I tasted was PERFECT. ÊAll depends on what you're feeling at the moment, I was feeling lemony and lavender-honey, but they have something for every mood. They also have a bike rack outside which is nice because ice cream tastes 10x better after riding all around, so i would recommend that to make it the best of the best.

Bi-Rite is pure heaven on a cone. Perfect as an after dinner dessert, for a sunny afternoon, or just when you have an antsy craving for ice cream which means that it's just right for any time of day or weather. I am in love with the cinnamon flavor or the ritual coffee toffee (even though I'm not such a big fan of toffee). It goes down light since the ice cream is not heavy like gelato, which is another story entirely because I love gelato too. And as for the space or a line (godforbid! ha) well I don't really care because the whole experience is hedonistic anyway so just relax. And I also prefer to sit on the benches outside.

Bi-Rite Creamery absolutely lives up to its reputation! Their ice cream is super thick and creamy, and so many interesting flavor choices, wow. I intended to have a scoop of the chocolate, but the honey lavender was too good to resist.

Mmm.. If you love dark chocolate, or if you're just PMSing, you've got to try the Soy Chocolate. It's the darkest chocolate ice cream I've eaten. Bi-Rite's flavors are unique, but the selection is small. There are probably about 10 flavors total, though all of them sound very exotic. Other than Soy Chocolate, I also sampled Lavender, which was a little too odd and a little too sweet. The cashier (maybe he was the manager?) seemed a little nutty when I was there, but I mean that in the best way possible.

Stood in line going back and forth on whether to have salted caramel or blood orange sorbet...as I got closer to the counter I decided I would taste the salted caramel but get the sorbet. ÊAfter one lil spoon I ditched my plan and got the salted caramel. ÊIt was unbelievably yummy! ÊStaff was totally helpful in suggesting flavor pairings. ÊWill have to go back when I'm less full to try some of the suggested combos.

Holy shenanigans! ÊThis place puts ice cream on a whole other level. Mr. O got the Salted Caramel. ÊIt was like a slap to the tongue! ÊBursting with flavor, woke him up in an instant! ÊHe literally said, "Whoa!" Sam's Sundae was heavenly - sweet and salty. ÊIt's familiar and new at the same time. ÊI'm not a huge vanilla fan, but I couldn't pass up the Banana Split. ÊIt packed some serious vanilla flavor at it's purest! ÊThose caramelized bananas were so crunchy and sweet.

5 star ice cream. ÊStar retracted only because EVERY time I go there is a wait in a line down the block. ÊDespite the decent microclimate of Dolores Park it is often cold out. ÊLet's recap: I wait in the cold to EAT THIS ICE CREAM in the COLD. ÊIt is that great. ÊThe best ice cream in the Bay Area.

I love the salted caramel, though it is little too sweet for me, but the creme fraiche is where it's at! ÊI like the clean, slightly tangy taste, which left me refreshed and very satisfied, a wonderful sensation which does not always occur after I eat desserts. ÊThe coffee toffee and brown butter pecan are also really good. ÊIf you like ice cream, you need to check this place out.

This place has really different flavors of ice cream so it is a nice change from the "usual". ÊA sundae was $6.50 which seemed pricey to me because it wasn't that much ice cream. I didn't think it was as great as my friends told me it was so maybe my expectations were too high?

Well, like Êsome other yelpers.... I also saw the food network show about the Sam's Sundae. While it sounded tasty I didn't really see how someone could be so in LOVE Êwith a sundae that had salt and olive oil on it. (no chocolate sauce, no cherry? I mean how could it really be that good) . Boy I was wrong. I mean I always knew that a little extra salt made things sweeter (I'm know for making double salted chocolate chip cookies that everyone likes) but there is really something about the olive oil that takes this sweet treat from great to WOW!!

We were food-comatose in our hotel room, watching food network's dessert special. They featured "Sam's Sundae" - Chocolate ice cream with bergamot olive oil, maldon sea salt and whipped cream ..WTF, right?..we decided to hunt this place down and try some. We finally found this place Êand there was a line going outside and around the corner. It's not too bad of a line, but you have to stick it out. My friend and I ordered Sam's Sundae and the only way to put it is "a party of flavors in you mouth". It was sooooo weird, like a really GOOD weird. I sampled their salted caramel and it was amazing! Their sundaes are a little pricey, but enough to share with someone and definitely worth it.

To begin with, I don't really discriminate on ice cream flavors. So I really liked the honey lavendar. Often compared to laundry detergent or potpourri, the lavendar was fairly floral but it still tasted great with the sweet honey...sigh... yeah i still think about how creamy it is. Flavors don't really get this exciting in Orange County so I think it's important to realize and appreciate the different flavors bi-rite has to offer. Also to note, great service =) Crowded and small, but worth the wait. Luckily the night i went wasn't too bad either.

Yes, the ice cream is really good here but they also have the best rainbow sprinkles in the world! ÊSprinkles can often taste a bit waxy but the ones here are thin, crisp and sugary. ÊThese sprinkles are actually imported from Germany and are gluten-free (not that that matters to me). ÊAlso, they come in pastel colours so they look oh-so-pretty on your ice-cream~

One of my roomies took me here when I was craving a sundae. I was bummed they didn't have just straight-up strawberry ice cream, so I got some malted vanilla with peanut brittle in it. It was pretty good, but, I have to say that it was so sugary that it made me thirsty! My roommate got some crazy sundae which had olive oil and sea salt in it! I had a taste of it and it was actually pretty tasty. ÊIf you are in the mood for completely crazy ice cream or want to try a twist on an old fav, give this place a try.

So I honetlsy doubt that one more review about this amazing delicious ice cream shop will do any world of difference. every single ice cream that I have had has been totally and completly amazing, my two favorites so far include the cinnamon sugar one (tastes like a snikerdoodle) and the salted caramel. The malted vanilla is also really nice as is the pumpkin. I have never once hit the long lines I have heard about so i feel glad about that, and if you want to spice up your ice cream try thr brownie sunday option it has toated pecans which are soooo sooo amazing!!

Above average ice cream outlet. They should have more of the flavors that can be stunning: strawberry, blueberry. The lavender honey was my favorite, and I tried orange cardamon, coffee toffee, salty caramel, earl grey tea. The salty caramel I found to be too sweet for my taste, but I can see how people rave about it. The honey lavender I had a second serving of along with a Boylan's cream soda.

So, once again, I had ice cream from Bi-Rite Creamery. This is the fourth time this break and third time this week; I know, what's become of the health-conscious-conscious, right? To be honest, I'd probably throw my health out the window for this place, almost, maybe. Even before arriving, I had a craving for their Sam's Sundae. However, when we were maybe a block and a half away, I realized that I've already had the same sundae for more times this week than I thought necessary. I thought, "maybe I should give Sam a break, he's probably sick of my pugly mug." I knew I wanted a sundae, but could not decide between the two that caught my eye: the brownie or the banana. Now, let me tell you something about myself: I used to find banana split sundaes disgusting, to the point of repulsion. Why, well, when you swiftly deliver that first spoonful of your average banana split onto your anxiously waiting taste buds, the copious amounts of canned whipped cream just overpowers the entire experience: you get an eight-to-two ratio of fat-filled air to anything else. I hated whipped cream and would immediately make a self-programmed u-turn every time it came within close proximity to my palette. The whipped cream served up by Bi-Rite, however, is nothing short of heavenly: a fresh, airy, almost guiltless quality in every bite. I have a feeling that if given the choice, I could eat that stuff with almost anything, sweet, even savory, haha. Anyway, back to the review. Since I was already intimately familiar with Bi-Rite's whipped, and realizing that the only thing that had steered me away from trying banana splits was the usual canned whip fare, I decided to give myself the option of trying Bi-Rite's banana split. But I couldn't decide between my love for brownies and the spirit of trying something new. So, why not ask which the server preferred? So I did, to my delight. She probably sympathized with me as she offered to give me a two-for-one special, halving each sundae flavor and combining them to form a dual-delight. And so, I had a banana split on top of their chocolate ice cream and the brownie sundae on top of a scoop of vanilla, per my choice. Awesome. My impatient taste buds probably made the wait seem longer than it was, but every single millisecond of waiting was worth it for what I was about to see and taste. The whole sundae was like a piece of art, golden caramelized bananas and brownie bits sitting over two generous scoops of ice cream, topped off with huge dollops of freshly whipped house cream and caramel/chocolate syrup zigzags accompanied by toasted walnuts and candied pecans. Damn, feast for not only my tummay, but my eyes as well! Talk about two-for-one. I first started with the brownie sundae: soft, crumbly, cocoa brownies over vanilla ice cream. I enjoyed the brownie bits, but wished that they were toasty or even warm to play off the coldness of the ice cream. I think I enjoyed the vanilla ice cream way more than the sundae for what it was. And then, on to the banana. To be honest, I was a bit skeptical when I dipped my spoon into the banana split portion, but as soon as I spooned that mass of bananasplit into my mouth, all skepticism was replaced by orgasmic delight. I could barely keep it in... my mouth. The slightly crisp layer of banana complimented the cold chocolate ice cream perfectly and the whipped made the whole experience that much more creamier and dreamier. The walnuts added a nice robust, toasty flavor to the mouthful, accentuating the texture of the single layer of candied banana with its own nutty crunch. And then you get this creamy banana aftertaste that dances around your mouth. Mmm, favorite. Nothing short of it. I've had ice cream from Bi-Rite two days back-to-back now and I'm still hooked. Will I ever tire of the incredibly innovative and exotic flavors they consistently churn out? Will I ever be able to escape the inescapable money drain that is Bi-Rite Creamery?! I don't think so; at least not when they have such an inviting buy 10 get 1 free promo going on! So, in short: GET THE BANANA SUNDAE, or if you can't decide between two, ask them nicely to fit both into one bowl for you!

The salted caramel sounds kind of odd for an ice cream flavor, but one taste of this and you'll definitely want more. They are really nice about letting you try out all the flavors, so don't be scared to ask. I ended up getting the salted caramel, brown sugar and the coffee toffee. My boyfriend got the Brownie Sundae and that was equally as good. I loved the brownies and the candied pecans in the sundae. I have yet to try their baked goods, which is sold at the counter a couple houses down from the creamery.. but judging by the brownies in that sundae, I would recommend you get some of those cookies and brownies for the road :)

Wait in line! I promise you wont regret it! With outrageous flavors like Ginger Caramel and Balsamic Strawberry this ice cream parlor attracts a huge crowd on all days of the week. The servings are small but the flavors rich and the sundaes offer unique toppings like berry compote and buttery soft toffee. Order a cone and stroll over to Delores Park on a hot day.

Either I've just been getting pretty damn lucky not having to stand in a huge line for all these places I've been dying to try or the food Gods have just been working in my favor. I'll take either :P After watching Toy Story 3 in 3D out in the East Bay, my cousin and I decided we wanted some ice cream. No, not just any regular ice cream, but Bi-Rite. We were sitting in the car contemplating whether or not we wanted to sit through that rush hour traffic, and the next thing you knew, we were on the freeway. Right as we were driving up the block to Bi-Rite, a car pulled out. As we were parking, I noticed that there was no line at all. Um, JACKPOT. The servers were so down to earth and not bitchy about giving you samples. I never understood how people who worked at ice cream parlors could be such douches.. who doesn't love ice cream? Anyway, I sampled the coffee toffee and roasted coconut and this is gonna sound ridiculous but I ended up getting their double, which allowed me to choose 2-3 flavors and I got the coffee toffee salted caramel, and malted vanilla with peanut brittle. The prices are definitely worth it, especially when you can opt for an organic sugar cone. I noticed that the different flavors had different consistencies. For example, the salted caramel melted the fastest while the coffee toffee took the longest to melt. That didn't mean they weren't all delicious because they were. As I was finishing my ice cream, I watched as almost every customer ordered the balsalmic strawberry. I decided to sample it... bad idea. I ended up ordering a scoop of it on my way out. Ok, I just put my fatass on blast but F it. That just shows everyone how bomb this joint is. But then again, who could ever say no to 4 scoops of ice cream?

I love the salted caramel ice cream at Bi-Rite. ÊI could do without the Bergamot Olive Oil on the Sam's sundae. My first experience with Bi-Rite Creamery was through a pint size of salted caramel ice cream from the Bi-Rite market. ÊIt was love at first taste. ÊThe salted caramel ice cream was absolutely amazing. ÊJust the right amount of salt mixed in with the most rich caramel ice cream you'll ever have. ÊIt was real caramel flavor; the kind where you boil sugar in a pot before it burns, not your cubes of caramel wrapped in plastic. Ê My second experience with Bi-Rite Creamery was through Sam's Sundae. ÊI saw this sundae on the food network's "The best thing I ever ate" and they gave such great reviews that I just had to try it. ÊSam's sundae consists of 2 scoops of their chocolate ice cream, topped with Maldon sea salt, organic Bergamot olive oil and fresh whipped cream. ÊFirst bite, i was like "oh my god this is amazing!" The whipped cream was nice and fluffy and perfectly sweet. ÊThe chocolate ice cream was rich, probably one of the best chocolate ice creams I've ever eaten. ÊThe salt added a nice contrast to the chocolate flavor. ÊThe olive oil was nice and fruity. ÊThen I had my second bite and all of a sudden the olive was too strong and was over powering everything else. ÊI ate a little more with the olive oil and finally just had to eat the sundae without the olive oil. ÊDon't get me wrong, the chocolate ice cream with the Maldon sea salt and fresh whipped cream were still super amazing - I'll just ask them to hold the olive oil. ÊNext time I'll have to try the Spicy Mexican Chocolate. ÊI hear that ones really good and I like the heat.

the line wrapped around. but again the wait just made me justify how good it was. especially on a sunny saturday afternoon. taste tested the honey lavender. it tasted like soap. got a scoop of cinnamon. yam. deliciousness. and roasted banana? i think. okay all i really remember was the cinnamon. definitely a MUST.

I'm sorry Bi-Rite but I have to take away one star. Since you're in my neighborhood, I still frequent you, but I've tried other ice cream places (Humphrey's, Ici, Mr. & Mrs. Micellaneous) and I've been having second thoughts about five stars for Bi-Rite. It's mostly because I feel limited to salted caramel and a few other flavors when I go. I've decided that I'm not a big fan of the sorbets. They are vegan and there's a lot missing in terms of taste. Oh, but Bi-Rite's new addition, the soft serve is wonderful. If only they had more flavors everyday...

in a bowl, three scoops of buttery, sweet then suddenly salty, deep, intense SALTED CARAMEL! mingling with a scoop of snickerdoodle ricanelas on the side, and a scoop of brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl! a crunchy sugar cone sitting on top and maybe a cookie of the day. quickly sample the earl grey, balsamic strawberry, and blood orange sorbet, steal a bit of your friend's amazing roasted banana ice cream --- walk to dolores park, get comfortable, enjoy the rich cold creaminess...NOTHING ELSE REALLY MATTERS!!

Holy moly, salted caramel and vanilla swirl soft-serve ice cream!!! Their ingredients are all natural (from what I understand) which means that their flavors are true without any of that icky aftertaste you get from usual artificially flavored ice creams.

I finally hit Bi-Rite on a beautiful warm day with some out-of-town friends, after filling our faces with Tartine goodies, and man, did I impress them! Bi-Rite is worth waiting in line for fifteen minutes or more; their flavors are incredibly imaginative and super-fresh, and I love: (1) that their ingredients are organic (2) their bowls/spoons are compostable, and (3) they let you split a single into two flavors! Perfect for indecisive freaks like me. I had the salted caramel (it's everything that people rave about, AND more!) and the roasted banana (so deliciously creamy!) Although I have a soft spot for Mitchell's, I have to say that I prefer Bi-Rite because I don't get that disgustingly full and gross feeling when I'm done with my ice cream.

three words: olive oil sundae. somehow, they've managed to subvert the dominant paradigm of an ice cream shop, all while producing some of the best ice cream i've had. Êyou need to be brave here, but the payoff is huge. after hearing so many good things about this place, i was a bit surprised that their ice cream wasn't the creamiest ice cream i've had. Êpeople usually flock to places that use lots of butterfat, but i don't think (though i could be wrong) that bi-rite follows this trend. Ênonetheless, their ice cream is absolutely satisfying, and rocks your tastebuds with every bite. oh, did i mention that they use straus organic milk/cream and Ê biodegradable bowls and flatware?

What can I say? Luscious and dreamy Salted Caramel! A wonder of science and taste! Whoever decided this magnificent flavour combo is a genius.

5 stars for BiRite!!! I had their ice cream today..and decided to get their salted caramel because it was their popular flavor and bro got their coffee toffee...once we got it..i couldn't wait to get back to the car i had to try some right away! The first few spoonfuls was orgasmic!! It was like nothing i've ever had before...the saltiness plus the creaminess of the caramel was a perfect match! I'm personally not a huge fan of caramel because im a little sensitive to EXTREMELY sweet and sugary flavors...but the salt made it a perfect harmonious paradise in your mouth...mmmmmmm. Their flavors are special and unique like balsamic strawberry and honey lavender..and ginger..but also have your classic flavors like coffee toffee. Oh yeah...we accidentally walked into the deli market first...thinking the creamery was maybe in the back of the store? It wasn't...it's actually at another location down the block....we wasted valuable seconds where we could've waited in line...when we got there it was around 5:30 or so on a sunday evening..and there were still around 15 people ahead of us..now that tells you something! SO DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE...MAKE SURE IT SAYS BIRITE CREAMERY OUTSIDE. ÊOh yea..and they also deserve 5 stars due to their environmental friendly green compost bin! They give wooden spoons..and paper bowls out and expect their customers to finish their ice cream there so they can dump them out in the green bin. YAY for environmental friendly establishments! One more thing...location was a plus...niice friendly neighborhood close by to where I live...and parking was a breeze. Great ice cream on a sunny sunday evening...does it get any better than that?!

No doubt that their ice cream flavors are unique. ÊThat's what makes them good. I would go here just because you can't those those flavors anywhere else (unlike Mitchell's). ÊI tasted their salty caramel, which is kinda too strong for me, so I opted the Cinnamon with Snicker doodles. It was pretty good though I expected a bit more.

Brown Buttery Pecan saves this review. I would have rated this place a 2... 1 for ambiance and 1 for good service. Most of the ice creams are way too sweet for my taste.

The ice cream servers were very friendly and I loved that they gave you samples on real spoons rather than disposable spoons. That's one way to reduce some of the waste that goes into our landfills. I ended up with a salted caramel and creme fraiche cone. It was good but not spectacular. I'm not sure that I would be up to waiting another 1/2 hour for it next time. I would be back if the wait was shorter.

Such good ice cream...probably the best gourmet ice cream shop in the city. Before I quit eating dairy, I really liked the dark chocolate ice cream (or was it the Mexican one?), but you know what, they have just as good vegan ice cream, it's homemade and they use very quality ingredients. They also have baked goods, and the make yummy sundaes. The line is huge though, so get there as early as you can. And yes there's even a line during winter. Amazing!

Any ice cream joint with a line down the block on a cold, rainy day has got to be delicious. Bi-Rite Creamery did not disappoint. As someone lactose intolerant, I really appreciate that they have both sorbet and non-dairy ice cream. I had the chocolate coconut non-dairy ice cream with hot fudge, my boyfriend had roasted banana with the berry compote topping, and my other friends respectively had honey lavender, banana kiwi and ricanelas. The biggest hits were definitely the honey lavender and the roasted banana. My boyfriend also thinks the combo of roasted banana, berry compote and hot fudge is godly. Our only complaint is that the texture of the banana kiwi sorbet was a little off.. definitely too gooey. A minor complaint about a truly delightful creamery though.

here's another one in the long list of "ZOMG SALTED CARAMEL ICE CREAM NOMNOMNOM" reviews. actually, it really is ZOMG SALTED CARAMEL ICE CREAM NOMNOMNOM. i really didn't think it was going to be good. but i had to try it because it was on the 7x7 list, and well, my sister had tried it. i would not be outdone! i was afraid of the salt that i thought would come in the ice cream. would there be flakes sprinkled atop? would there be crystals hidden inside the scoop? well, no. it's not as salty as you would think. just like you add salt to baked goods to draw out the sweet notes, the salt provided the same result here. except, in the most delicious way imagined. think of it this way: think about the best caramel you've had ever - bi rite is better than that! yea, it will pretty much blow your mind. however, i couldn't JUST have caramel. i was going to have my ice cream and eat some more. so i ordered a single, in a sugar cone, of half salted caramel and half plain chocolate. now, i used to work at an ice cream store, so i know that good chocolate ice cream is hard to come across. and they actually did it pretty well. not too milky and not bitter either. but it paled in comparison to the salted caramel. btw, for you ice cream lovers out there, the best and probably only way you should have ice cream is to have it on a cone. and licked. that way, your sweet receptors, which are at the tip of your tongue, are subjected to the sweetness and the flavor is better emphasized. now, head over to birite. b/c i said so.

Bi-Rite is my new favorite ice cream parlor! I used to frequent Mitchell's but I am now a true believer of Bi-Rite and their salted caramel. The wait can be long though bearable (especially compared to Mitchell's) and parking can be near impossible. We usually park far and then walk to Bi-Rite which makes the ice cream even more enjoyable- kind of like a treat after a nice, long walk. I had been wanting to try this place for a long time and even tried a few times with no luck due to parking (or lack thereof). Needless to say, my expectations were increased due to the failed attempts but alas the salted caramel has me hooked.

I finally decided to fall into the line after convincing myself that the line would never be shorter. It wasn't too chilly outside, so I didn't mind very much. Anyway, I'm so thankful for the handheld menu that floats around the beginning of the line because as a very indecisive individual, I do not want to be responsible for holding up the line. I tried the Salted Caramel and the Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces. Surprisingly, I did not like the Salted Caramel, at all. I am a HUGE caramel lover but this flavor was way too strong for me because of the weird aftertaste. I'm not sure what it was but it was nasty. On the flip side, I enjoyed the other flavor a lot. I like to have texture in my ice cream to keep it exciting. haha But really, this flavor was super delicious. The prices aren't bad at all because I got two scoops on a cone for $3.25 (I think) and I was happy. All was well.

The staff are always friendly and have a great way of encouraging you to enjoy tasting flavors and moving the crowd thru quickly. Expect a crowd any warm day or night. If it's a hot day, the line can reach the corner, and it's worth the wait. No other ice cream like it.

I love summers in SF even more after eating here a few weeks back. My first introduction was the balsamic strawberry and Mexican chocolate. I would have done better w/ the roasted banana, but I felt like chocolate that day.. is it me or does the Mex choc taste a bit pot flavored? They were the perfect level of creaminess. The only thing that sucks is the line. Next time, I'm bringing a cooler full of ice and buying ice cream from the market.

...meh personally i think it's overrated. it was good, but not that great. i think it was too sweet and a little too creamy. maybe it's just because i like lighter things. but i would have liked if they had a selection that was lighter. it was so crowded i didn't even have time to think, just randomly chose some, and of course tried some of the famed salted caramel. it was good. but still. overrated.

The honey lavendar ice cream ROCKS! ÊWent with a friend to Delores park and stopped by to get some ice cream. ÊThe honey lavendar looked like vanilla ice cream but from the moment it hit your tastebuds WOW! you could smell the lavendar. ÊIt was awesome! ÊI've never had anything like it and totally WOW'd it. ÊIt's made with organic honey from a local bee hive.

Crossed the street for ice cream after dinner at Delfina. ÊThe line for ice cream was about 15 people long at 9:30 pm but well worth the wait.

Ordered the vegan chocolate coconut and the balsamic strawberry. It was definitely worth the half and hour wait. The flavors aren't as intense as Ici's (I still think their chocolate ice cream is the best I've had to date). But the ice cream tastes lighter and fluffier, which I tend to prefer. I was surprised by the chocolate coconut, the texture looks icy but looks can be deceiving! The ice cream melts in your mouth upon contact. I think the balsamic enhanced the strawberry flavor, but my friend thought it was weird. The staff is very friendly and patient. Despite the long line, there weren't any irritable customers. In fact, you almost develop commradery as you wait together admist the air of excitement and anticipation (and indecisiveness because they have so many flavors!) Definitely coming back again!

ÊI decided to try the coffee toffee and VEGAN chocolate coconut. As soon as the flavors caressed my tongue, I knew that I had to get both. A single gets you 2 flavors! Happiness ensued in my mouth and in my wallet. The toffee coffee is bold and the chocolate coconut is light and tasty, I couldnt believe it was vegan!!! Definitely have to go back. bring fun people to hang in line with and if you think you can't find the place. Just look for the ridiculously long line.

Let me start out with the fact that I hate chocolate Ice cream, I love chocolate, but I hate chocolate ice cream... weird...I know so I watch a lot of food network, and I saw the episode, where this place was featured, and the way Aida was eating Sam's sundae, made me want to lick the screen. So, I couldn't get the thought of that damn sundae out of my head. I live in the richmond, so last week, on a hot day, I decided to just make the drive out there. I was skeptical about getting sam's sundae- only because I hate chocolate ice cream. Also, the combination of the olive oil and sea salt, seriously, who would have thought. My fear was that I would be disgusted by the chocolate ice cream, and I would be swallowing oil by the spoon fulls.... WRONG!!!- But- they gave me a sample, of the sundae on a spoon. It was so delicious I wanted to swallow the spoon whole- so I indulged, and can not wait to indulge again. I wish it was closer, but so worth it, I don't mind taking the drive out there. I didn't taste other flavors- but am ecstatic about their innovative flavors. Thats definitely my type of ice cream place! Can't wait to show it off to all my friends :)

This ice cream is as good as it gets. ÊIn the three years I have lived in San Francisco and always avoided the long lines at Bi-Rite, I finally decided to give in one hot sunny day at Dolores Park and see what it was all about. ÊI figured one scoop wouldn't hurt the no-ice-cream diet I'm on, but when I finally got through the line and saw all of the interesting and exotic flavors, i ended up with three flavors on my cone! ÊThey're all all interesting and make the looooong lines worth it.

On my last night before I left San Francisco, my gracious hosts remembered Bi-Rite Creamery and we drove at break-neck speeds to get there before closing time. We arrived with 10 minutes to spare and found the line snaking up the block. We estimated a long wait, but I decided I would stick around to see what this place was all about. The staff work their butts off to make sure everyone gets their ice cream in a timely manner, so the wait in line wasn't all that bad. They even tolerated my asking for 3 different samples, which I really appreciated. The flavors I tried were all very interesting and sometimes unexpected combinations, but all worked well as a whole. The ice cream was not icy at all and was smooth as it should be. I decided on the salted caramel. Oh my stars, so good! I'm usually more into fruit ice cream or sorbet, but I could not resist the salted caramel. I should have gotten 3 scoops of this =( I am already planning my next visit to San Francisco and Bi-Rite is definitely the first stop on my list.

salty caramel.. hands down the best flavor here. the fresh organic ingredients, and interesting flavors. they are very environment-friendly, the spoons are even compost-able!

There's a reason why you'll often find a long line outside this spot waiting for even just a taste of their ice-cream. ÊIT's that good. ÊI've gone here only 2 times, but maybe upon future and (repeatedly pleasant experiences I'll give it 5 stars). ÊThe service is really good, they'll let you sample whatever you want and don't get annoyed if you want to try more than one flavor (customers waiting behind you, might haha). ÊI like anything caramel/toffee so that's what I've gotten each time (of course not without sampling the other flavors and all were just as good).

Dear readers of the world, you have not lived until you've stopped by Bi-Rite Creamery in San Francisco. I am totally kicking myself in the ass for not knowing about this place until now when I've lived in the city for 19 years. All their ice-cream is homemade right upstairs fromt heir store front with all natural ingredients. Softer than ice-cream but harder than gellato and ultimately - HEAVEN ON EARTH.

This place is rather amazing. I would say, that when it comes to texture their ice cream is high quality, but nothing earth shattering. What is earth shattering are the flavor combinations. They are subtle, but well balanced with the dairy. I got cherry almond which was amazing, because I love those two flavors since they are botanical brothers, but I digress. I also got the creme fraiche, which has an amazing tartness to it, kind of like full-fat yogurt, or sour cream. The strawberry balsamic was definitely good, and I would recommend it. I also tried the vanilla soft serve which was good, but had an interesting taste Êin my opinion. They also have cupcakes, but I wouldn't bother - stick with the ice cream! Cash only FYI, and typically, there is a line out the door.

Êit should take up to 15-20 minutes to get your order but if you don't want to wait, there is a freezer in there too that has ice cream pints, ice cream sandwiches, and cakes i think that can be purchased then and there.

Yummy ice cream, but overhyped to the point of being disappointing. I was expecting a dense ice cream, and this is very fluffy and air-filled. I got salted caramel and it was soft and melting. I ended up drinking the last quarter of it. I also tried my friend's sundae. I loved the heavy cream and the homemade graham cracker and caramel topping. So yummy, but quickly became sickeningly sweet. I think this place is good, but not great, and a bit pricey for what you get.

Currently, my favorite place for ice cream, besides my own kitchen. If we needed an excuse to visit our best friends, who reside in the Mission (and no, we don't), stopping for a late night cone at Bi-Rite would be it. Nothing better than getting a sugar high while sitting on the benches in front of Bi-Rite Ê- my favorite might be banana, but the salted caramel is also worth two sticky thumbs up. I also appreciate that you can get two flavors per scoop - so you never have to totally decide (the long line gives you time to make up your mind about what to order at least 3 times).

i'm not a very reliable reviewer because when i go out to eat i tend to get only one thing all the time, never trying anything else. Êsuch is the case with bi-rite. Êi only get the salted caramel and refuse to try anything else because i love salted caramel. Êoh... wait, i've had lavendar (i think it's a flavor that they have unless i'm thinking of mitchell's) and ginger flavors. Êmmm, not a fan of either, because, well, lavendar is a weird flavor to begin with, and the ginger flavor tastes very similar to salted caramel but salted caramel is better so might as well just get that. Êbut one of these days i should check to see if they have mint chip. Êmmm, looking forward to that. i love that this place is located next to dolores park... nothing beats a warm day hanging out at the park with a bi-rite scoop in cone in hand. Êi think every time i am in the mission i always stop by. Êand... even in cold weather i bother to get a scoop because that's when there are no lines!

The reviews are right. It's really that good. I was skeptical that it wouldn't live up to the hype...but it did. I love that with the single you can get two flavors. I am very indecisive, so that was a nice surprise. I got the salted caramel (how could I not) and the ricoletto (sp?). Mmmm, I loved them both. The salted caramel was different than I imagined, it tasted like this great sea-foam candy that my grandmother always gets. The ricoletto is cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodles (my favorite cookie) mixed in. I can't stop telling people to go here. I'm glad I don't live closer to it, because I'm sure I would be going way too often.

I "popped my bi-rite cherry" last week, so to speak, and learned what the hype has been about. It's the nontraditional ice cream flavors like Salted Caramel and Honey Lavender, which REALLY taste like their descriptions! I'm talking about intense flavoring that doesn't lead to second-guessing "oh this could be raspberry instead of strawberry." And I tried a few spoons of my date's brownie sundae. Wow, that was heaven in my mouth. Plus you have lovely Dolores Park across the street, so this is a perfect place to go on a sunny day. I'd go back to try the other flavors, and remember next time to offer my companion some of my cone... (sorry!).

One can't really find fault with the ice-cream here as they have unique flavors and they're generally very delicious. ÊI think it's a bit overhyped though leading to long lines out the door which brings up the perennial question .. "is it THAT good" and I think the answer is not really unless you really couldn't settle for something from the grocery store. ÊI'm also a bit spoiled coming from some great ice cream purveyors in Seattle which has similar flavors like salted-caramel but tended to have a more ice-cream like consistency (not too melty-soft like what I had at Bi-Rite).

Made the trek over after hearing good things about this place. ÊMy friend and I parked quite far due to construction and crossed Dolores park to get here. ÊAfter a 20 minute wait, we tried a couple of flavors, and I decided on Roasted Banana and Salted Caramel. ÊBoth were good, but the flavors forgettable.... both me & my friend thought that the ice cream felt very heavy (yes, ice cream is not a low-calorie food), but it just didn't sit right in our stomachs.

I think I may have stumbled across the name Bi-Rite Creamery once while searching through Yelp, however what really made me want to go try it was a brief mentioning of it in Sunset magazine. ÊWhen I hear about lines being out the door and around the corner, something tells me it might be worth a shot to make a trip down to the Mission where there is NO parking. "It was worth it," concluded my husband, daughter, and me. There is the store counter that serves the ice cream in which the line went down to the corner. It was probably a 15 or 20 minute wait and not much of a time difference with the beloved Mitchells Ice Cream which we adore with all our hearts, so I'm not sure what people are complaining about. There is also a window counter with a much smaller line for soft serve ice cream and baked goods. If you are a play-it-safe type of ice cream person who only likes the classic chocolate-vanilla-strawberry flavors and would rather buy Dreyers at the store, then of course a place like this makes you wonder what the hype is about. Ê(Hence the Yelpers who are wondering what the big deal is). We like boring flavors too, but we all loved what we got! My 7 yr old preferred the chocolate vanilla swirl soft serve. The hub got a "make your own" sundae with mint chip ice cream, homemade graham cracker topping, chocolate fudge, and whipped cream. I am a boring single-scoop-of-strawberry type of girl who can't eat too much dessert, but guess what? I got a double size in a small bowl which allows you to choose 2-3 flavors. (The scoops aren't that big). Here's what I got and LOVED: Malted Vanilla w/ peanut brittle and milk chocolate bits, Salted Caramel (O!M!G!), and chocolate coconut (vegan). I didn't want it to end...ever... and I was sad when it did. Two other pluses besides the "Hooray For Ice Cream!" success were: 1) the employees at both the store and at the window counter were super nice and 2) their green ways. ÊThey use compostable and biodegradable items (eco plastic spoons and compostable paper bowls for ice cream), use real silverware spoons for tasting, and have the recycle, landfill, and compost bins outside. A successful experience for sure. Bi-Rite is one of those places where you just have to try the unique flavors. I know next time I'm trying other flavors too!

Absolutely fantastic! I tried the Lavender Honey, and the Roasted Banana. Both of them are incredibly wonderful as ice creams. Store bought ice cream, or even coldstone doesn't hold a candle to Birite. I think the difference is that birite's ice cream seems to have a lot of subtlety to it, the roasted banana for sure tasted like a ripe banana instead of a sugary bananaish thing that most ones are. Fantastic!

I always have to try and stop here if I'm in the area. Best flavors are honey lavender, salted caramel, and roasted banana. I also love the "Sam's Sundae" with chocolate ice cream, handmade whip cream, bergamot infused olive oil, and a pinch of sea salt. I usually hate chocolate ice cream since it's too heavy, but this one is lighter tasting and refreshing. Expensive compared to other ice cream shops, but so worth it if you think of the effort and money that goes into making small batches every day.

I tried this place on my birthday this year and was surprised to find one of the best ice cream spots yet. I tried the strawberry balsamic, but settled on the honey-lavender (it was a tough choice), which tasted as fresh as it's name, and all the cakes and pastries looked delicious (too bad I was full from lunch).

I'm definitely an ice cream person, but my favorite flavor is Mint Chip and I am fine with having it every time I have ice cream. After waiting in line, I tried some of the flavors this place is known for, including Salted Caramel and Honey Lavender, but neither flavor appealed to me so I decided just to go with my Mint Chip. I was very disappointed with the Mint Chip - the taste was kind of flavorless and there are better places for it in San Francisco. However, I do love Bi-Rite's location, the neighborhood and the fact that it's right across from Dolores Park, All in all, I don't it's worth the wait and hype. Maybe it's just because ÊI'm not really attracted to the unique flavors this place known for, but I probably won't go back.

I live close to Mitchel's but I would much rather walk the extra distants to have ice cream here. ÊThis is by far my favorite place to enjoy dessert in San Francisco. ÊWhether I am walking through or eating at one of the numerous excellent restaurants in the neighborhood.

First I would like to say that my friends and I are icecream FANATICS! Needles to say we have tried many many types of icecream. We all found this place to be great. I disagree with the other reviewers saying that the icecream was nothing special. The icecream is very flavorful, creamy etc etc. I do however agree that it is very overpriced. I go here one in a while because if I went as much as I wanted to - I would be broke! I also agree that the service is one of the wost. It is a total crap shoot, some of the workers are super nice and others seem like they need prozac administered intravenously. I also agree that there are too many yuppies from out of the area. While I do not mind that others come in from outside the neighborhood - I do care when they are absolutely obnoxious, snobby, pretentious etc etc.

This place is so perfect it makes Ritual seem like starbucks. ÊI'm sorry, but it's true. ÊYou step in, the system is flawless. ÊThey heap silver teaspoons with loadsa cream. ÊThe flavors are varied by high-class. ÊThe staff is super friendly and patient. ÊThe size of the small shoppe feels cozy and there are enough chairs inside and out. ÊThe menu gives you enough to work with depending on your appetite and it's all priced point-perfect. ÊEven in 40 degree weather on a windy SF-day, I never miss my weekly dose of bi-rite creamery. Ê(PS. ÊI accept that Mitchell's is a SF staple. ÊHowever, the comparison between the two is like comparing Bill's Hamburgers to Burger Joint--crude and dated.)

Hipster ice cream heaven!!! The ice cream is solid, and comes in alot of unique flavors. The line is super long on the weekends partially due to It being very conveniently located next to Dolores Park. If you have a few extra minutes I say skip Bi-Rite and go down the road to the Bombay Ice Creamery for a much better taste.

The best ice cream in town and the best toffee chip cookies.If your not a fan of nuts make sure you let them know not to put too many nuts or any at all on the dishes that come with nuts otherwise you have nuts for days on your ice cream. I was hoping the strawberry tasted more like strawberry. They use a sour cream which gives it an odd taste. Other than that they're friendly and Im happy they're here in San Francisco

If you need to squander some of your artery points, do them here. ÊRich, creamy, subtle ice cream in a panoply of interesting flavors. Ê I've tried a few of the flavors but nothing beats the Salted Caramel which is not sickly sweet. Ê ÊOrange Cardamom, Snickerdoodle were Êwas ho-hum. ÊThe Lavender Honey is good but I have to be in the mood.

On a late Sunday evening, with a line out the door and the surly counter staff trying to close the place (I'm not deducting any stars for that, by the way), I managed to score some Bi-Rite salted caramel ice cream. ÊIt was my first taste of Bi-Rite ice cream and I've been fantasizing about it ever since.

I LOOOOOVE Bi-Rite! ÊI've been to Tara's Organic Ice Cream in the Berkeley/Oakland area, and I've been to Ici as well. ÊThey're both really good, and have similarities like small batches and unique flavors, but Bi-Rite just kicks it up a notch and they're really the best. ÊBi-Rite also gives bigger scoops than Ici and Tara's, so that makes me happy. ÊBigger scoops of anything that good is just automatic bonus points. ÊMy favorite flavors are Honey Lavendar, Malted Vanilla, Balsamic Strawberry and Salted Caramel. ÊI always get those and I haven't branched out to other flavors yet because those ones are so fantastic! Ê To compare Bi-Rite to another San Francisco (ice cream) landmark, Mitchells: ÊMitchell's has bigger scoops and Filipino flavors and is close to my heart because my family has been going there for years, but Bi-Rite is so fresh and the ingredients are just excellent. Ê There is also a place in Fairfax (Marin County) that also has excellent ice cream, called the Fairfax Scoop. ÊThey also use the Straus Family Creamery which is a small organic farm. ÊI would go there more often if it wasn't so far away. ÊIt's so worth it if you're in Marin--it's just like Bi-Rite, including the long line! Ê:)

Been here several times, and have several different flavors. I think you can tell good quality ice cream from tasting the vanilla flavor, and I must say... this ice cream place was yummm didily. However, you must know that I have not only tried the vanilla. I've tried other flavors such as coffee-toffee, butter pecan, cookies & cream, (tres leches?? i think) and they have all been very flavorful. I'll be back for more! BTW, I like this place better then Mitchell's because the flavors are great and you can by-pass the ridiculous lines at Mitchell's.

The ice cream is great. ÊBut then I also paid $3.95 for a Balsamic Strawberry ice cream sandwich and while it was good, was not really worth it. ÊBut on the up and up you can get 2 different flavors on a cone for the indecisive and the malted vanilla with peanut brittle and chocolate is great. ÊMy girlfriend got the mint chip which was creamy and tasty. ÊIt is definitely worth going to and trying but as I eat ice cream as much as possible not the best for an everyday treat.

Ok, as far as quality of taste goes, this place is five stars without a doubt!! Coffee toffee is far & away the best ice cream I've ever had. But the lines are always, ALWAYS unbearably long. Sure, it's *nice* to stand & chat & run into people you haven't seen in a while, but it's, like, give me my ice cream now. Standing there reading the list of flavors over and over and over and over and... my god, I could die of anticipation. Of course, your wait is always rewarded with the best ice cream you've ever tasted -- and the employees are always very sweet. Sometimes, though, I wonder why I didn't just buy a few pints from the market & save myself the twenty minute wait...

1665 reviews?? ÊDamn.. What have I been missing?? Finally got to check this place out after hearing rave reviews REPEATEDLY from my friends. ÊThey also warned me about the long lines so thought I could bypass by going @ 9:45pm, 15 min before closing....and there was still a line!! Ê After 15min of waiting, got Malted Vanilla with Toffee (OK. ÊA bit too sweet for my taste), Roasted Banana (Yummy!), and Balsamic Strawberry (Favorite of three...has a nice "kick" to it). ÊAlso got to try a taste of the salted caramel (good but too sweet to finish a scoop) & their chocolate chip cookie (not bad..tasted like a lighter version of Mrs Fields). Ê Overall, great unique flavors! ÊTexture was OK (Joe's is better). ÊWill definitely come back again to try other flavors & their to die-for ice cream sandwiches.

There was actually a line around the block because it was hot out but the line was pretty fast and surprisingly, the people serving the ice cream were still craaaazy friendly and they'd been swamped all day!

I wanted to try Bi-rite's ice cream since it draws so much attention in Yelp. So I did last night. Had earl grey and the famous honey lavender,,they both were kinda sweet. Earl grey smelled really good and left an awesome aftertaste after each bite which impressed me, thumbs up !!!! The honey lavender had a real strong scent plus it's way too sweet. Don't get me wrong I love lavender scent but it's kinda weird to put into mouth. I will go back to try out other flavors esp. salt caramel which they didn't have it last night :( TO BE CONTINUE......

With over 2000 reviews, what are the chances that more than four or five will get read? I'll post this more as a reminder to myself when I'm up for some ice cream. I found out about this place over the summer from Hot on Yelp while looking for a coffee shop to hang out in after the SF Exploratorium. Came back again a few weeks ago during "winter" to find that nothing's changed: the ice cream is as excellent as others have raved, the parking is still terrible, and the lines still exist (though they are planning to expand to the building next door; more flavors and seats to come?). At my most recent visit, shared the honey lavender, coffee toffee (my favorite), and brown sugar. The aroma and flavors are very strong; the lavender smelled good but the taste was a bit overwhelming. Sample the flavors and get a scoop of two or three; you might even go back for more.

I LOVE BI-RITE CREAMERY, rain or shine. ÊThe only issue I have is the availability of parking and the occasional long line that wraps around the corner. I've been here a few times and tried several of their flavors thanks to the patience of the workers :] ÊMy favorite is the ginger and earl grey. ÊThe ricanelas and brown butter pecan is also very good, but you can't go wrong with any of the flavors they have. ÊI also tried the lemon gingersnap; it was delicious! ÊThe texture was chewy and the flavor was very crisp and clean. ÊThe luscious smells coming out of the kitchen made it extremely tempting to buy more, but it was hard to buy another when they were $0.75 and not that big [about 3 or 4 in. diameter]. ÊBUT I would say they're definitely worth a try and that I will probably get another cookie next time :] The last time I went, it was my friend's birthday. ÊShe had already ordered her ice cream but was getting another order for a friend. ÊAs a birthday treat, the server added the extra scoop onto her cone for free! ÊSuch a sweet man, even though I think he misunderstood her extra order and thought it was for her. :]

ÊIts so good that I concluded I would probably eat it out of someone's butt if that was my only option for getting it.

Seriously, I don't know what's so special about this creamery. It's just "normal" to me (and according to 3 other people in my foodie group). I tried their lavender flavor, salted caramel and roasted banana. The lavender tasted like car's air freshener. The salted caramel is sweet and somewhat too salty like the name implies. Only the roasted banana was decent. It's definitely not worth the 1 hr drive from sunnyvale + 15 minutes finding parking in very competitive mission district + 20 minutes waiting in line. I'd rather get some starbucks mud pie ice cream from safeway than this.

I love me some salted caramel ice cream, so one day my wife purchased a pint for the house. That same week i had my 4 wisdom teeth removed, so I couldn't chew regular food. For a couple days, my diet consisted of Ê10% mashed potatoes and 90% Salted Caramel ice cream from Bi-Rite. I couldn't get enough of the stuff.

I would do many things do get a hold of this ice cream. I have, in fact, planned a whole trip based on visiting this place. Went for the first time in 2007 then again in 2009... from the awesomely unique flavors (like lavender...etc.), the outrageous quality of the ice cream, the hole in the wall (it's pretty small) feeling, and occasional fun interaction (last time a server greeted people by asking how they would like to 'start their ice cream journey'), I adore this place...I may have nostalgia tied to it...but still. And the lines that can occur don't bother me...they make me appreciate more...Bi-Rite Creamery...I love you.

The ice cream is extraordinarily tasty. They have a great balance of traditional and adventurous flavors. My two caveats are (a) that Bi-Rite isn't cheap and (b) the store isn't air-conditioned, so the ice cream melts _really_ fast.

My husband and I have been living in San Francisco for about 6 months and just about everyone we meet highly recommends BiRite Creamery when ice cream is on the mind! ÊWe got there just before close (around 9:50pm) and we ordered the Salted Caramel and it was just as delicious as all the fans describe. ÊMy husband, however, felt it was too salty and probably will not order that flavor again. But we both agreed the texture was amazing, light, fluffy, creamy, perfect. ÊI ordered the kids cone, which I thought was plenty for an after dinner dessert. ÊMy friends ordered the Strawberry Balsamic and thought it was good but have actually tried that flavor at Beachy Cream (http://beachycream.com) and think BC makes a better version. ÊOverall, I have to admit it is as good as everyone says, thank goodness it's not in our neighborhood so I won't be tempted to visit every evening!

Expect a line! ÊThis place is very popular, even at 10pm on a Friday. Ê The daily flavors are posted on the door and on the board. I tried the salted caramel and didn't care for it. ÊBut I really liked the balsamic strawberry and the white chocolate with a blackberry swirl. ÊThe vanilla is the best I've ever tasted. ÊThe cookies n cream was average. Ê If you want the soft serve, go to the doorway on the right. If you want a pre-packed quart, go to the door on the left. ÊThe freezer will be on the right. ÊYou pick a quart and step up to the right side of the counter to pay. Only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because there isn't much seating and parking is a real pain. Next time I will have a sundae, I've heard good things about their fudge sauce! ÊAnd they use real whipped cream, too.

My favorite ice cream in the city. Mitchells is a close second, but Bi-rite is closer to my neighborhood and I walk by it weekly. Yes it is pricey, so I only go in once every couple of months. My desire for their wonderful ice cream goes up and up, until my resolve breaks and I go in. I usually wait until I'm passing when there is no line. And really there are many times through the week when there isn't the long line out the door. I always find that the staff is friendly and helpful. Usually they talk and joke with us. I like the compostable plastic spoons, I abhor the flat wooden spoons--they give me that fingernail on chalkboard feeling, so I have to remember to ask for the special spoons and not call them plastic or I get the compostable lecture. My current favorite flavors are Earl Grey , Lavender Honey, and Ginger. I've never been a fan of the salted caramel, but come and try the flavors out, there's bound to be something for you.

Hello salted-caramel ice cream! ÊI am actually a little lactose intolerant, but I will eat salted-caramel ice cream thousand times. ÊSweet and rich caramel flavor mixed with a hint of salt in a creamy ice cream form is a combination that will make your taste buds go wild.

Top flavors: Ê Toasted Coconut Ê Coffee Toffee Ê Salted Caramel, a really nice savory butterscotchy flavor. Ê Roasted Banana It's right by Dolores Park, so on a hot sunny day it's great to enjoy your ice cream after your wait in the line, even though it may wrap around the corner sometimes.

I was in San Francisco last week on vacation and everyone in the Castro district was talking about Bi-Rite, so I went to check it out.

Everyone loves ice cream. ÊAnd everyone loves Bi-Rite. ÊI went with a few friends after reading all of the reviews. ÊI sampled the salted caramel after all of the rave reviews and liked it but didn't love it. ÊAs some have said, it tasted a bit burnt. ÊThe chocolate coconut was ok but not outstanding, and the ricanelas was good but didn't blow me away. ÊI had the toasted coconut, which was tasty. ÊThe real winner of the day though was the roasted banana. ÊThe Mexican chocolate soft serve that we sampled on the way back was also deeeeelicious. ÊBonus points to the staff for being courteous and fun. ÊThey helped me goad a friend into buying ice cream when she said she was "stuffed from dinner" (who needs to be goaded into eating ice cream, really?) and gave me a frequent buyer card after the fact when I realized that we hadn't gotten one when we bought our ice cream.

While other "favorite" ice creams are all about the flavors, Bi-Rite is all about the foundation--super creamy, delicate, melt in your mouth goodness.

Their ice cream is really good. Possibly some of the best ice cream I've ever had. But, it's also the type of ice cream where it's good only once or twice a week.

It all started when I called up my friend. She was enjoying a cup of Roasted Banana ice cream in Dolores Park reading Twilight...hahah. I asked where she got her Roasted Banana flavored ice cream and she mentioned Bi-Rite Creamery. Anyways, one day my friends and I were trying to figure out an alternative to Mitchell's ice cream, another awesome spot. Bi-Rite came to mind so we went to check it out. Whenever I visit to get my ice cream fix, I haven't had trouble looking for parking yet, but once I approach the shop, BOOM! a line. I don't mind waiting in lines, but it can get too long sometimes. The wait is worth it though. I was going to give four stars for this reason, but besides that, everything is +++. It's a nice little shop with a great selection of unique flavors. You know what they say, when there's hella people in a food place, then it must be good. I haven't tried Salted Caramel, which sounds like the crowd favorite, but Malted Vanilla and Roasted Banana are my favs. Truly a magical experience.

Ok, I get it...this place is good; although...it's a little over-rated in my book. ÊPerhaps I went in with too high expectations after reading everything on Yelp. I had the salted caramel (my favorite!) and honey lavendar and both were delish. ÊMy husband ordered the roasted banana and he liked it a lot.

You must try their ice cream! It's different. They serve you samples using real silver metal spoons, and the people who work here are friendly. I was surprised that they weren't getting annoyed of people asking them constantly to try a flavor since most of their flavors aren't common. I had the Salted Caramel and it was scrumptious!

Bi-Rite is good ice cream. Based on the two scoop single serving I got, one scoop was good and the other not so good. The bottom scoop was coffee toffee. It had good flavor and good toffee texture, but the ice cream texture was off. It was really soft and gritty and several times I crunched some ice. The top scoop was their famous Salted Caramel. It was very tasty and had much better texture. The wait was a bit of a scene but the three women working the counter made it move fast. Their service was great and they discounted my order because the Salted Caramel was scraped from the last bits of the pan. If the Coffee Toffee was spot on, I would totally give up four stars and I will be back.

Holy snaps! Ice cream is off the machine. It is the most perfect place to go when the sun is rarely out. It's nice to get a scoop or if you're big like me SCOOPS of ice cream and take a stroll around the area. I am a huge RICANELAS fan. Cinnamon snickerdoodles flavored ice cream? Genius. It's like Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs came and made my wish come true. Salty Caramel! Totally flavor town in your mouth. Get both of those together and you seriously might just die. Take a bite and knock out. Might as well bring a blanket. Prices are fair. Bomb ice cream deserves its money. Parking is tough since its the streets! If it is a really hot day, like REALLY hot and it's around a vacation time say the summer, then there is bound to be a loooooong line. That's why if you go bring your money so the wait is worth it. If you can't decide on what to get, ask for free samples! They do do that there. So take advantage of free tasting!

Delicious! This is a sweet spot to go to after eating dinner in the area. ÊThe only problem is the longgggggg lines and the lack of parking. ÊOtherwise, this place rocks. I tried the salted caramel ice cream, which everybody talks about on here. ÊIt's really a unique flavor. ÊI love ice cream and dessert probably as much as anyone you'd know, but two scoops of salted caramel made me feel like I was going to get diabetes! ÊNot to say that it wasn't good, because it was. ÊThe flavor was just really strong. ÊGiven that I'm a masochist, the next time I go back there I'm definitely getting salted caramel again. I paired my salted caramel with this vanilla toffee crunch...I forget what it was called exactly, but that was delicious as well. ÊNot as strong of a flavor as salted caramel, but they went well together. I nibbled on my friend's earl grey and honey lavender. ÊThe earl grey was good. ÊObviously it reminded me of earl grey tea, but it was a unique flavor that I wouldn't mind having again. Ê The honey lavender, to me, tasted like massage oil. ÊNot that I've ever consumed massage oil, but that's the feeling I got after I had a bite of that. Despite my dislike for honey lavender, this place deserves 5 stars alone for the salted caramel. ÊI wish they had more than one bi-rite around the city!

I've got deep, deep love for Bi-Rite. ÊMan alive, that's some good stuff. ÊI usually opt for a classic sugar cone, but I've been known to splurge and go for the sundaes, getting the housemade graham crackers with roasted banana ice cream with caramel sauce and whipped cream. ÊIt'll make your knees buckle. ÊIt's that good. ÊI am not kidding. ÊThe mint chip employs the freshest mint and tastes like no other mint chip you've ever tasted and the salted caramel is divine. ÊIt's usually crazybusy, with a long line, but service is sweet and swift. ÊI enjoy grabbing a snack and strolling up to the top of Dolores Park, my most favorite spot in the City and sitting on one of those benches or lying on the grass and staring up at the sky.

Delicious, delicious frozen treats. I got the balsamic strawberry and salted caramel. The balsamic strawberry was noticeably better than your average strawberry ice cream, but the salted caramel was the real prize-winner. I must be honest and say that I don't recall having caramel ice cream before, and I haven't had actual caramel in a very long time, but the Bi-Rite salted caramel ice cream perfectly replicates the best caramel flavor in my memory. I was so happy with it that I bought a pint at the market today as I passed by. Much better value there, but I can definitely understand the line outside the creamery. Bi-Rite has definitely been one of my better ice cream experiences. I've had some really good gelato before, and although they're not recent enough in my mind for me to be able to compare, Bi-Rite is the first place to make me think that regular ice cream even has a chance.

Tasty ice cream and a really cute store with an eco-friendly vibe. After reading yelp reviews, I had to taste the salted caramel and roasted banana. The former's caramel flavor was really in-your-face strong and concentrated sweetness. It's amazing how they infuse such specific flavors into their ice cream. The coffee toffee tastes like you're drinking coffee! Furthermore, the different textures of the different flavors suggest that they aren't just products of various combos of artificial flavorings--they actually contain the foods that they are based on. For example, the roasted banana was much denser than the other flavors I tried; plus, the bananas hanging in the kitchen area verified that they really make their ice cream authentically. The really friendly saleslady suggested a combo of roasted banana and brown sugar, to which I happily agreed. A "single" serving, which can be two flavors/scoops, amounts to ~$3. We came at around noon on Saturday and surprisingly there was no line, although more people started coming in as we sat inside and ate so we probably beat the rush. I'm lactose intolerant, but did not feel sick after eating their ice cream. Minus one star for being expensive, but I would stop by again if I ever find myself in the area.

avoided them for ages even though they were reviewed in aa attractions mag, (1) because i was embarrassed aa knew something about sf i didn't and (2) because every time we drove past it the queue was looooooooooooooong. then one day i was just walking past and voila! no queue. (tues am i think.) anyway i went in and the guy behind the counter made me taste like 200 flavors! ok, it was more like 7 but by the time i was done i had no more room for the huuuuuuuuuge cone i had envisioned. Êit's pretty amazing they had that many flavors for me to taste since i'm allergic to chocolate, coffee, and just about every scrumptious thing there is! and then... the guy volunteered to give me a kiddy cone! even though the sign said no kiddy cones for adults and i'm right between kiddy age and the age where i would be buying for my kiddies. Êi was *well pleased* esp because the lavender ice cream was yuuuuuuuuuumy. -1/2* for the price, but i think that's what you have to expect for gourmet ice cream in sf. plus the kiddy cone wasn't too expensive and was plenty for me after all the samples. going back for more!

The Bi-Rite Creamery has sophisticated, unique, delicious ice cream. I especially love the salted caramel (rich, densely flavored, and not too sweet-- this is ice cream for grown ups). the crunchy coffee toffee, and the roasted banana. If anything, Bi Rite may be a little too creative, and there are occasional misses-- the honey lavender tasted kind of like eating a potpourri, and the strawberry balsamic was too oddball for me. But it's a special place. Between Tartine and Bi Rite, this is a dangerous block of the Mission for sweet tooths.

Here it goes: 2 scoops of chocolate ice cream, Molton sea salt, organic bergomot infused olive oil and fresh whipped cream. Don't think you'll love it? Then you'll have to argue with my favorite TV chef, Aida Mollenkamp. She will set you straight!

Small ice cream shop with excellent American style ice cream, high in butterfat. This is not gelato. They have interesting flavors like salt caramel and honey lavender. Sam's Special is chocolate ice cream, whipped cream, bergamot-infused olive oil, and salt. While it sounds awful, it's great. There are only a few seats inside: be prepared to sit outside on one of several benches or walk across the street to Dolores Park. If you are in SF, well worth a trip

Ê Flavors to Try: ÊSalted Caramel (a MUST try -- sweet and salty goodness!), Honey Lavender (try, but don't get a full serving..after a few bites, you feel like you're eating soap or drinking lotion.), Cookies and Cream, Earl Grey, Pumpkin, Cinnamon, Toasted Coconut, the list goes on and on and on... Oh and if you're buying a pint or a ice cream sandwich, you can bypass the line! ÊJust go grab it and go to pay!

Sunday afternoon with no plans called for a impromptu day around SF for myself and a couple of buds. The line was small and moved at a good pace, so we were inside in only a few minutes. Salted Caramel and Roasted Banana were my Êchoices, although I asked to sample the Balsamic Strawberry before placing my order. I plowed through the cone and two scoops of ice cream in no time flat, which left me extremely tempted to fall back in the still surprisingly short line and grab another one. Salted Caramel had a good balance of sweet and savory. My friend thought it was nasty. Are you serious, woman?! I suppose it's an acquired taste for some, but most will agree that it's pretty damn good. That with Roasted Banana made for probably the best ice cream combo I ever had. No joke. Now that I think about it, the two flavors remind me of Bananas Foster, sans the need for a stove. This place is legit, so I'm putting 5 (stars) on it.

bad day at work today. gonna take it out on the hapless BiRite Creamery. I remember when I first heard of a gift registry for weddings, and I almost couldn't believe such a thing existed. Or the first time I saw someone eat sushi with a knife and fork, I simply could not continue my meal and politely excused myself. Or perhaps my first encounter with classic nouveau American Suburbanism, replete with the white carpets and the electric fountains and the too-large houses on too-small lots. Here we have the ice-cream equivalent of the offenses enumerated above. Its bad enough this place so wantonly flaunts its association with Bi-Rite Grocery, one of the most ridiculously over-priced bouzhie Mission grocery stores that has ever existed. ($5/ pound tomatoes?!) But the real crime here is how SWEET the ice cream here is. That's right, sweet. ÊSaccharine, cloying, catches-in-your-throat, mawkish sentimentality that has to be tasted to be believed. Sure, the names of the flavors are interesting. Honey-Lavender, or perhaps the Salted Caramel may catch your eye. Ê(BTW, sugar and salt do not affect the taste of food in opposite ways! Sugar is an organic molecule, brutish and monochromatic with flavor. Salt, applied well, is far more subtle, enhancing some flavors, adumbrating others) I imagined the salted caramel to taste outer-worldly, subterranean. I thought maybe it would be akin to eating pure mineral matter. Perhaps I would know again and again the rare joy of the taste of mistaken expectations---like when you reach for your water glass and get the wine instead, and for that magical moment you taste, truly taste with no preconceptions whatsoever. The problem is that this moment only occurs when it is unexpected, so its a little hard to experience it consistently. (Now that I think about it, I guess you could blind-fold yourself and have your sig-fig feed you mystery foods a la 9.5 Weeks, but that might not be for everyone. Anyway). The honey-lavender was a joke, so sugary the delicate lavender oil barely registered. Don't get me started on the chai spice milk or the balsamic strawberry. Am I being too picky? I notice this place is always packed with a line outside the door. The reviews are almost uniformly positive. Maybe I am the one who is wrong, and don't understand this folksy, good-natured approach to desert. Doesn't matter. I'll stand with my bad taste in ice-cream..

yes, the ice cream at bi-rite creamery is pretty good, but it's not that great. it's just ice cream. taste-tested the chai-spiced milk chocolate, but passed on it since it the flavor was too over-the-top. salted caramel was good. classics like mint chip, chocolate and banana would be good choices as well. what stood out to me the most though, was the adult-to-child ratio at this ice cream shop: 15:1.

The ice cream was okay. Not as good as nearby Bombay Ice Creamery. But the reason I give this place one star is because of all the yuppies who frequent it. We're in the Mission right? For some reason Marina people think they can take over this street: with Delfina, Bi-Rite and Tartine. I say no thanks mofos. When I was at Bi-Rite last time there was some dude with his two little kids. I swear what a bunch of spoiled a-holes. Just be happy that your dad is buying you over-priced ice cream. Just go back to your mommy waiting in the Mercedes double parked outside. Yeah, if I wanted West LA I'd live in LA assholes. Stay outta the Mission please. Stick to Bombay....

why is it that people who maintain a vegan diet assume that just because something is vegan that it tastes good? bi-rite, unfortunately, falls into this category. if i were someone who consumed dairy products, i'm certain i would rant and rave about the awesomeness of this joint. i mean the design of the place is sweet, the flavor selection looks nice and even the sundaes look cool, but the real proof is in the pudding...er... ice cream. unfortunately the first lick did not send me into vegan frozen treat heaven but rather returned me to the dark days of the early 90s eating moca mix or rice dream--complete with nasty aftertaste. they get two stars, mostly for effort. back to the drawing board bi-rite folx. i'm sticking with maggie mudds.

with places like fenton's and ici under my belt, it was time for bi-rite. lucky for me, it was close to where i was staying. i tried pretty much all the flavors but only malted vanilla w/ peanut brittle and chocolate truly stood out to me. salted caramel, earl gray, brown sugar were good but i didn't crave it. the ice cream here is much more intricate and sophisticated than fenton's but i still love ici's waffle cones. definitely a must stop for ice cream fans but it just lacked that extra oomph for me. must try humphrey slowcombe for more comparison as well.

The Salted Carmel Ice Cream is something that wakes me up at night and makes me crave it's creamy goodness. This is BI far my favorite dessert in SF. Call it fate, but there was no line when I went. We sampled a few flavors and decided to go with the Salted Carmel. My best suggestion for those people who just started seeing someone who is totally sexy but talks too much (and ok, let's be honest, you're really just dealing with the chattiness to get them into bed), take them here, buy him/her some Salted Carmel Ice Cream, shove a spoonful immediately into their mouth, Êdrive like hell to your apartment before the delirious ice cream coma wears off, BAM! Mission accomplished. They won't even know what hit them. All they will know is they want more of where that came from. (Ok, that's totally evil, but will SO work. For added effect, take the Salted Carmel to go and pop in the Notebook. Sealed deal guaranteed.)

Êtime for my second chin to make a comeback, with the assistance of bi-rite creamery. on cold WINTER nights, the lines for bi-rite don't fail to spill out the door. on warm sunny SPRING days, the line goes up the street and around the block..... ahh who am i kidding? Êit's always ice cream season!!! bi-rite's ice cream is incredibly CREAMY and RICH. Êtheir flavors are unique but not too crazy. Êyou can have 2 flavors in a the single scoop, which i would SELL MY SOUL for.... but bi-rite only charges 3.25. the CINNAMON/SNICKERDOODLE has chunks of real snickerdoodles it it and is excellent! Êit replaced the BROWN SUGAR GINGER W/ CARAMEL SWIRL, which i also loved (the name is self-explanatory.) Êthe ORANGE CARDAMON was very refreshingly fruity yet spicy... it was interesting and the flavor grew on me with each lick. Êthe VANILLA MALT was quite malty... a bit too malty for me, but enjoyable nonetheless. Êthe COFFEE BEER was also overly beery for my taste.... but the COFFEE TOFFEE is to die for!! chunks of toffee in strong coffee ice cream.....mmmmmmmm! Êthe GINGER ice cream was spicy, i would like it more if it were sweeter. Êmy friends all loved ROASTED BANANA, however i don't go near the stuff cause i don't like bananas... cutting to the chase... my ALL-TIME FAVORITE is still SALTED CARAMEL. Êits sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo delicious i want to marry it and eat it forever. the end.

A gorgeous day in San Francisco is pretty hard to come by so it makes a great day for ice cream! ÊYesterday we waited in the long line for some bi-rite. ÊNote to self - next visit just go straight to soft serve to get salted caramel because there are only 4 people in line at the most. ÊLuckily this line didn't wrap around the block when we arrived but there was zero parking because everyone and their mama was at the Dolores Park! I tried the cookies n cream (I've had better), honey lavender (my favorite - really strong lavender flavor I felt like I was eating my lavender oil at home), and roasted banana (Mmmm so damn good). ÊI got a little sample of salted caramel, the depth of that flavor for a tiny little sample was crazy. Ê You can also purchase cookies, cakes, and their prepackaged ice cream if you don't want to wait in line. ÊAt the time they had Mexican Chocolate prepackaged. ÊThe best part about this place is that they have frequent buyer cards. Gotta love that!

Overpriced and so mediocre. We wouldn't have an issue spending the money, but it just wasn't that good. The pint was so light---read not much butterfat and mostly air--and tasted as such. The flavor was good of the salted caramel but still it was not particularly creamy. The toffee was icy and tasted more like a snow cone than ice cream. Hands down I prefer Mitchell's. I left very disappointed. Sorry to all you 4 and 5 star folks.

i just cannot get enough of bi-rite creamery. ice cream is not my friend - i think i may be borderline lactose intolerant and i'm not supposed to eat sugar. but i cannot resist the salted caramel-one-scoop-on-a-cone-please from bi-rite creamery. it's outstanding. my lady loves their ice cream sandwiches too- macaroons with chocolate ice cream anyone? the best possible place for dessert ever.

no. it's not ok. it's so good it makes us want to cry. we cry all the way home. we cry AT home when there is a pint in the freezer. crying and drooling simultaneously because something is sooo good is not alright. salty caramel, malted vanilla with peanut brittle & honey lavender are the best things you will ever taste in your life. if not, your taste buds are boring/broken and you are WRONG.

When i first saw Sam's Sundae from Bi Rite featured on Best Thing I Ever Ate, i was literally drooling. I was expecting to wait in line, i literally walked in and ordered my ice cream, done. Ê I knew i was only going to have one opportunity to visit Bi Rite, so Sam's Sundae was too risky, what if i didnt like chocolate and olive oil and salt, so i opted for the safe choice. ÊI ordered a small for $3.25 which allows you to try two flavours. ÊI know the salted caramel thing is pretty mainstream, but it had that slightly burnt taste i love, but i dint get any saltiness. ÊI also had the Malted vanilla with peanut brittle and chocolate pieces, this one didnt do much for me, it was just ok. Êmy sis had the cookies and cream, paired with the vanilla. ÊShe loved both of them. ÊI have to give the scoopers at bi rite Êmajor props, because they scoop the ice cream perfectly, it is in a tight, clean ball. ÊAlso there was a celebrity sighting, Jay one of the finale contestants in last season of Project Runway.

First time visitor...I tried the roasted banana ice cream and the chocolate, topped with brownies. The roasted banana ice cream alone is good enough to warrant five stars. The chocolate ice cream and brownie topping were not as memorable, but that banana, WOW! I've never tasted that much banana flavor. I highly recommend!

When I lived in the Mission, I used to go to Bi-Rite Market on a regular basis and would see signs about the Creamery opening soon, and I would wait and dream. Of course, as soon as I moved away, this placed opened up. Typical. Now I live in Southern California and have nothing comparable down here!! Since it opened, I have been probably 10 times to this place and it has yet to disappoint me. Sure, there's always a long line, and like this past Saturday night, parking was a bitch and it was freezing outside; it is still worth all of this. This place may not have all of the flavors that Mitchell's has, but they are brilliant at the classics, vanilla and chocolate. This past time, I got the build your own sundae with one scoop of vanilla and one scoop of roasted banana (the most incredible flavor ever!), brownie bite, hot fudge, and whipped cream. This was the best sundae I have ever had in my life, hands down. I love you Bi-Rite Creamery!!!

Let me just say this, hands down the best ice cream I've had in quite some time. The reason for only four stars? The hoops you have to jump through to get a scoop. You know, sometimes the hoops aren't worth the scoops. Point being, I'm the type of person who generally knows what he wants and if I don't, I usually deal with what I get. It seems that a lot of people out there want to sample every flavor of ice cream in the case before they settle on their old stand-by. This can take up a vast portion of an hour, when you are the last in line and the brats in front of you want to lick every !@#$% spoon in the joint. Sorry, I just had to get that out of my system. Anyway, if you have the patience or great timing, then by all means go for it. The concoctions are fantastically avant-guarde and I have not had a flavor that I did not enjoy. I especially like the Sam's Sundae. This creation has bergamot infused olive oil, drizzled over dark chocolate ice cream, with a sprinkling of flaked sea salt and of course topped with homemade whipped creme. I'm salivating just thinking about it...I gotta go jump throug a hoop...I guess I'll be standing in line for some ice cream.

i love bi-rite, even though i often find myself waiting in line - once i waited in line for half an hour and it was 10:30 at night. the wait comes from people sampling everything. however, the ice cream is so yummy and the flavors are great! my favorites are balsamic strawberry, coffee toffee, and salted caramel. it's also fun to get a sundae with your choice of toppings, too. just be aware, bi-rite ice cream melts fast! but i always like ice cream soup...

Cute small place with unique flavors. They're known for Ginger flavor but I think the local favorite is sea salt caramel. Personally I think their honey lavender is the best.

on a rainy, gloomy day, us east coasters braved the freezing cold weather to get the famous bi-rite ice cream. Êinitially we walked into the bi-rite grocery store (which is gorgeous but NOT the creamery) and then finally found our way down the street to get soft serve of the day and a rich hot chocolate. Êthe salted caramel soft serve was exquisite and affordable and the hot chocolate machine didn't have enough so they charged me less. ice cream to grab and go, skip a long line, and walk around SF with on a fall day? ill take it.

I've been here a couple of times but I always chose the original flavors like chocolate or mint ship. However, I finally decided to try their salty caramel flavor and Sam's sundae. Usually, when I go there, there isn't a line so when my friend and I walked toward the creamery, I literally shat my pants to see a line reach to the corner of the street. The wait wasn't that long though and when I finally got a chance to place my order, I ordered a single sized cup with balsamic Êstrawberry and salted caramel. After the worker gave me single sized cup, I asked for a Sam's sundae as well which surprised her because I'm guessing people usually don't order a sundae as well as two flavors of ice cream. First up, I ate the salted caramel which I really enjoyed. It was pretty sweet which can be a turn-off for some people, but it was a total turn-on for me. I also loved the balsamic strawberry with small chunks of strawberry and a subtle presence of balsamic vinegar. Sam's sundae was...interesting. I saw this treat on the food network channel so I decided to give it a go. The first thing I tasted was the salt, which was off-putting. Then the olive oil hit my taste buds like a sucker punch and the chocolate brought the sweetness that I was craving for. This mixture of salty and sweet wasn't the best thing that I've ever eaten but I ate the majority of it. Even though I didn't really care for the sundae, I really enjoyed the balsamic strawberry and salted caramel flavors. This is my favorite ice cream place and every time I come here, I leave happy.

(yes i've TRIED them - they don't wow me.) if you just want a unique flavor, go here. otherwise, i'd rather go to swensen's or mitchell's. it's not worth it to come down here for a flavor you don't have dirty fantasies about. cuz even though parking sucks at swensen's and mitchell's at least the black mtn raspberry/mango WILL wow you.

I've heard about this place for a long time as it vies with Humphry Slocombe to become to top ice creamery in San Francisco. I declare a winner! It was quite strange waiting in line for ice cream on a hot sunny Saturday afternoon in late November in the city, but I was excited to try the delicious handcrafted flavors. I tried several different flavors before settling on toffee coffee and toasted coconut. I felt the salted caramel was too sweet and the honey lavender was too fragrant. Toffee coffee and toasted coconut was the perfect combination. It's probably some of the best coffee ice cream I've ever had. The ice cream flavors were bold where they needed to be and subtle in other instances. Needless to say, the ice cream disappeared pretty quickly. I guess going along with the sustainability movement, they now have sustainable ice cream. I suppose that's a good thing. As long as they keep churning out delicious dessert!

I feel really bad for saying this but I think I may like this place better than Swensen's. I hope that doesn't mean I have to move now. I am a huge fan of Fran's Gray Salt Caramels (you must try these, delicious) so when I heard of an ice cream place that sold Salted Caramel ice cream I knew I must try it. I found myself in the Mission last night for this bikini store grand opening party and after looking at a bunch of bikinis that I knew I could never pull off I decided I needed some ice cream to just cement the fact that I was decidedly not bikini ready. After accidently first going into the Bi Rite grocery store I finally found the actual ice cream place after the kindly grocer man pointed it out across the street. I walked in and it was instant lactose heaven. I have a low lactose tolerance but this ice cream is worth any amount of gastrointestinal discomfort. I tried the balsamic strawberry and salted caramel which were amazing. I walked out of there with a double scoop salted caramel and brown butter pecan and a pint of mint chip. Yummmmmmmmmmmm.

Don't know what was wrong with my GPS, but I had the hardest time finding this place.

ÊThen I looked for a "Creamery" inside and only found a freezer full of Bi-Rite ice cream. ÊI was a little disappointed but assumed this was what everyone was raving about. ÊDisappointed, but I was gonna try this ice cream of theirs. ÊI went to the counter with my little canister of Bi-Rite ice cream. ÊI even asked the lady checking me out, if the freezer was all that they had of the ice cream (which I actually meant to mean "Is this all the flavors your Creamery served?"). ÊShe said yeah. ÊSo I was disappointed again. ÊHesitantly, I walked away with my canister in a paper bag. Ê5 steps outside, I just thought something was not right. ÊGathered up the guts, walked back in, and asked "Is this Bi-Rite Creamery?" ÊThe cashier finally let me in on the secret that it was down the street. ÊAnd he was even nice enough to refund me the money for my pre-packaged Bi-Rite ice cream so that I can walk down the street to get the fresh Bi-Rite ice cream. ÊWhich I did. ÊAnd it made my day!

I am drooling just thinking about "Sam's Sundae" and the "Afternoon Snack". I will wait in line for days if I had to!! Okay, maybe an hour or two at the most, but really, Bi Rite has got the best sundaes and best ice cream in town! The lines are longer than the most popular club in the city, but who cares because you leave here with the most mouth watering, delicious ice cream creation and big goofy smile on your face! Despite the long line, the laid back staff will STILL ask if you want to sample a flavor...don't be shy!!! Sam's Sundae is my favorite of all time (chocolate ice cream with bergamot olive oil, whip cream and a sprinkle of maldon sea salt) but the roasted banana, plain chocolate, and toasted coconut are among my favorites!)...God I wish I lived closer so I could have dessert here every single day of the week.

Been eating way more ice cream than I usually do and the reason for that is Bi-Rite Creamery. I just started going to this place about a month ago and I'm addicted. This place has the best ice cream I have ever had in my life and I've tried a lot. I love the texture of the ice cream its almost like a gelato soft melt in your mouth texture. There are so many flavors that are good it all depends on what your in the mood for. My personal favorite is the coffee toffey, salted caramel, and mint chip. Sometimes if I feel like a fruity taste I would get the concord grape popsicle. This place actually reminds me of Milk Creamery in So Cal, but this place out perfects them. The service here is very friendly and the location is great (right across from Dolores Park). Price is very reasonable and the scoops they give you are generous. I give this place 5 stars because I don't know if ice cream can taste any better than this, by far the best ice cream I have ever tried. No wonder I'm addicted.

It's probably hyperbolic to call ice cream "life changing," but that's how I describe Bi-Rite to other tourists. I don't look at ice cream the same after coming here because I didn't know it could be this good. If there is better ice cream on the planet, someone will have to prove it to me. So many people recommended it to me on my last trip to San Francisco that I didn't believe it could live up to the hype, but it far exceeded all my expectations. I don't think you can go wrong with any flavor. The salted caramel is the one people talk about, and it's great, but the rest are just as good. I think the apple pie has entire, baked, apple pies crumbled into it. Some day I hope to come back to try one of the sundaes (chocolate with olive oil and sea salt is first on my list). The worst I can say about it is that there can be an absurdly long line, even on a cold night, but that seems to be par for the course in this hipster gourmet part of SF, and it's worth the wait at Bi-Rite.

I'm glad I never heard any of the hype because I definitely would've been disappointed. This place has unique flavors, but none of them were too appealing to me. I love that you can ask for samples of any flavor and the workers never give you a look like "are you gunna buy something or are you just going to sample every damn flavor?" Went here yesterday and had the balsamic strawberry and honey lavender. Balsamic strawberry wasn't bad. Just a less sweet version of strawberry ice cream. The honey lavender though....TASTED LIKE SOAP! My husband loved it..but he likes weird things like snake and alligator sooooo yeah. His breath definitely smelled like soap the rest of the day. Our friends had other flavors, which I sampled, but none WOWed me. Good job Bi-Rite for having unconventional flavors, but sorry, you fail in making them yummy and worth driving out to the city and taking 30 minutes to find parking for.

i was passed by the grocery store first and got really confused, and i had to ask someone inside where all the ice cream was. Êturns out the creamery is a block down.

oh how I dearly miss u Bi-Rite!! After moving back home to so cal, i have never quite found a good fix for my ice cream Êcraving since you have set the bar soooo high. I have constant craving for coffee toffee and honey lavender. I dont care what peope say about honey lavender, it does NOT taste like soap. It tastes like a little piece of heaven in my mouth. I have battled the crowds far too many times and stood in line on way too many freezing sf nights for some ice cream. But its all worth it for my cup of coffee toffee and honey lavender. Also, i initially was a skeptic when it came to the soft serve, but after one bite, i was converted. There have been times when I make my friends wait in the regular ice cream line Êand i go get soft serve and eat it just in time for me to be in the front of the line with my friends for the regular ice cream.

i can't deny that the decor is absolutely adorable, but in my opinion the ice cream lacked a certain creamy quality and the pricing in somewhat prohibitive. that being said, Êthe flavors were incredible (try the salted caramel). the stand out item was the blood orange granita. though if it hadn't been 40 degrees outside i would have enjoyed it a bit more.

Without exaggeration, this is The Best Ice Cream In The World. ÊI'm frugal, and I think it costs about $8 pint, and let me tell you, it's worth every penny. ÊIt's difficult to describe why it's so good... creamy without being heavy, unusual flavors (ginger, creme fraiche), and homemade toppings. ÊI recommend the butter pecan ice cream with toffee topping. ÊMiraculously, eating their ice cream does not result in a sugar crash later on.

Yes, Bi-Rite Creamery really is THAT good. This is a must-try in SF- I tried the famous salted caramel and Earl grey. No words to describe the amazing flavor and creamy texture. Seriously, this makes other ice cream taste icy! My only complaint is the lack of seating, especially when it's a chilly night. But i would still go, and just devour it all in my car! They also have soft serve next door, and only offer one flavor a day (along with vanilla). The night I went, the flavor was Mexican hot chocolate, which i wasn't too interested to try. And plus, I was already stuffed. The next day was salted caramel (!!!), but I didnt get a chance to swing by. Next time, I will have make it a point to try it!

Yummmmm! I was on a Southwest flight to Las Vegas when I first heard about this place. They were listed in one of the SkyMall magazines you find on the airplanes and I remember reading all about their organic concept and unique flavor combinations. I salivated all the way to touchdown in LV and vowed I would go to SF to find this place. It took me a year to finally come here but I am glad I finally did! This place is amazing! The flavor combinations are to die for. I was able to try the Salted Caramel which is by far their most popular well known flavor and it is good! The salt really brings out the sweetness of the ice cream. I also tried the White Truffle lemon aioli salted ice cream which was amazing too!The honey lavender was good but tasted too much of lavender in my opinion. It needed something with it like crushed nuts to cut the sweetness. I ended up with a cup of their Ricanelas which is cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodles crushed into it. So good! I woofed it down walking across the street to the Bi Rite Market. :) Overall so cheap for the price too. My cup of ice cream was the perfect size for me and only costed $2.95. I am so glad I finally came and I love that every carton and container and cup they serve is biodegradable and recycled materials. What a way to send a positive message!

Jeez folks, how come it took my whole life to find people who love ice cream as much as I do? ÊGod created ice cream to be loved, to be created, conceived of, dreamed about in the same manner he invented angels and heaven, absolute joy. ÊWhen I first started hearing about Bi-Rite, I thought, just what we need, another run of the mill http://dot.com refugee with too much money and time on his/her hands and a shallow faculty of delivering more than expensive, organic ingredients. ÊI then read reviews that talked about flavors that sounded atrocious so I had to go check them out, and I was delivered where to the promised land. ÊMy first lick of balsamic strawberry confused my taste buds, but I wanted more, the way a crack whore wants more, and then there were other mystical, adventurous flavors I'll leave for you to explore and fall in love, hate or indifference with. ÊSundaes, cones, scoops, brownies, cookies, toppings and long lines make Bi-Rite the newest San Francisco treat and tradition, DO NOT DEPRIVE YOURSELF.

Reasonably priced for such unique ice cream. At first I thought it wasn't going to be anything too special because ice cream doesn't excite me. There were a lot of flavors to chose from and the two people working there were pretty friendly. ÊI opted for 2 scoops on a sugar cone - had the toffee coffee and the salted Carmel. I loved the sweet and savory of the salted Carmel! ÊI have to admit that this is not my first encounter with this combination but it worked very well as an ice cream. At first you may think the sweet would be weird with the salt but it is totally perfect. Ê I enjoyed this flavor over the coffee toffee that was good but the salted Carmel outshines it. Someone with us got the strawberry vinaigrette, which was good too but not too special. It kind of just reminded me of salad dressing. ÊI'm not sure I'm in love with the consistency and the level of creaminess but the flavors were worth the visit. I would stop in herd to check out new flavors or get the salted Carmel again.

Came here for some dessert after dinner. Saw a long line at the door..and it was almost 10pm. So I thought "This place has to be good!!" Line went pretty quick. Tried the salty caramel and roasted banana with some roasted almonds, it was delicious!! Love love love the roasted banana... the roasted caramel was good, definitely has a salty touch to it...and you can really taste the caramel flavor. The roasted almonds were actually warm which was a nice touch to the cold ice cream. Liked that the almonds came in nice chunks! Cause I love chewing stuff with my ice cream...=)! Would like to come back and try more flavors if I was around the area or at Dolores park cause it's right across the street. Menu looks like it had a few funky flavors I would like to try. And these are home made, will need to come back and try more flavors to see if it deserves more stars...too bad this is in SF, parking sucks so accessibility for me is not that great.

i don't know why, but i first thought bi-rite was suppose to be some kind of hole in the wall ice cream shoppe. like swensen's or something. but surprise surprise! it was kind of pretty looking. kind of fancy for an ice cream shop. so many crazy flavors i've never seen in my life! ok, maybe it's not crazy, but definitely unique. balsamic strawberry? roasted banana. i got the salted caramel with the honey lavender. honey lavender was pretty good and the salted caramel was delicious, but then it started getting too salty in the end. kind of expensive for the tiny two scoops they give you but i guess they have the right since you can't get these flavors anywhere else. would i come back? yes! must try the other cool flavors!

i REALLY REALLY L-O-V-E brownie sundaes and when i walked into this place i was super excited to see it on their menu! maybe it was the time of night or maybe that's just the way it always is, but that was one stale and nasty brownie at the bottom of my sundae :[ the spiced pecans and caramel and fudge toppings were the best part. the sundae came with two scoops of my favourite flavor: vanilla! and i gotta say that their vanilla is only OK plus it was kinda inconsistent in the taste - some spoonfuls were bland and others were verging on overwhelming. my partner had a cone with mint and cookies and cream - i thought the mint was refreshing and she dug it too. the cookies and cream was blah. we'll be back to try some of the crazier and oft recommended flavours, but this place is only average for the basics and damn it, sometimes you just want a fine scoop of vanila.

You can't buy wrong at Bi-Rite...ok corny pun intended. but seriously. ÊSome friends and I ate at Vietnamese place where the topic of best ice cream places in San Fran came up. ÊOur friends were raving about this place so we decided to skip dessert at the restaurant and head over to Bi-rite. ÊThe said to expect a line, so when we got there, we werent too surprised about the line around the corner. Standing in line on a chilly "summer" San Fran night yearned for the succulent taste of ice cream dribbling onto the warm tongue makes waiting not fun. ÊAna, who hands down has the be the best ice cream server IN THE WORLD. ÊNot only is she a tall beauty with a stunning smile...no matter how pissed off you want to be because you waiting in this line, her smile and warm charm puts to ease any unhappy feelings. ÊInteracting with her was almost as good as the ice cream. ÊAmazing experience...I got a card which means I'm headed back!

i'm sure all the cool kids...or since it's the Bay..koo kids.. know this but Bi-Rite is down the street from tartine and as most popular places in SF go there is always a line. but dear God, if i have to stand in line let it be for ice cream as good as this. now i'm a fan of all things coffee and ice cream when done properly is awesome. so when i saw that Bi-Rite had combined the awesomeness of coffee with toffee pieces a tear ran down my cheek and i parked it. luckily the friendly servers move the line quickly and before i knew it i had a cone in my hand. one bite and i was sold. i hate coffee ice cream that doesn't taste like coffee and this one was perfect, just enough coffee for me to know what flavor i had but not overwhelming and the toffee pieces so inconspicuously hidden and just making an appearance to give a nice surprise to my every bite. love at first bite indeed. definitely visited on my 2nd trip to SF like two weeks later.

i'm not much of an ice cream person so it's a crazy thing for me to give an ice cream shop 5 stars. but i give bi-rite 5 stars for allowing me to indulge on 2 flavors of ice cream for the price of a single scoop. my heart belongs to coffee toffee, salted caramel and balsamic strawberry flavors of creamy goodness. it's not often that i can actually consume an entire serving of ice cream without feeling ice cream overload but it's almost always guaranteed that that won't happen when i get it from bi-rite. heck, i'd even go there on a cold wintry night! doesn't that tell you something?

there is a delicious selection of ice cream. i would recommend the ricanelas, toasted coconut, and ginger. there is so much to choose from that it's easy to stand in awe with a line of people waiting impatiently behind you. Êon a warm sunny day in the mission, it is the kind of place that gets packed. it is small and located in an area with lots of people passing through. there are a few benches outside for patrons to sit outside. i like that the ice cream is served with a wooden spoon, it just seems to add to the whole ice-cream-eating experience without taking away from the flavor.

One night, after having a lovely time at Tokyo Go Go, one of my fabulous friends and I decided we had to have ice cream no matter how freezing cold it was outside. ÊFor people who love ice cream, you know what I mean. ÊAnd for people who really love ice cream, there is only one place in the city I would recommend: Bi-Rite Creamery. There is a reason you will wait in line. ÊSimply put, it doesn't get any better than this. ÊI swore off all other ice cream when the first spoonful melted in my mouth. ÊThere are no words to describe their incredible salted caramel ice cream. ÊIt nearly sent me into a state of comatose bliss--it's just that amazing. Here's a tip: get a larger container of this ice cream than you think you want at the time. ÊYou will want to stash this in your freezer for later. ÊYou will want more later. ÊYou will keep wanting more later. ÊYou will think about this ice cream during random moments in time when you are supposed to be working. You might even dream about this ice cream. You really will. There's only one thing I can think of that is better than this ice cream, and I will leave that to your imagination. Bi-Rite Creamery: yes, yes, yes!

I have to honestly say this is the best ice creamery in San Francisco. The flavors are limited to 10, but they are so delicious, you won't mind that they don't have a "bubblegum flavor" Êice cream or the sherbet variety at other places. Kidding. They do cover my favorites and that includes honey lavender, salted caramel and the double ginger. The only complaint I have is I still am shocked at myself for handing over $30 cash for 2 pints of ice cream. The cones and single servings are reasonably priced, but there's no discount for buying bulk.

I've been Bi-Rite ONCE, so I am basing this rating purely on taste. ÊThe line was out the door and down the street much like a popular night club. ÊMy boyfriend and I drove around looking for parking while our two friends went to wait in line. ÊParking is terrible! ÊI think we must have parked a good 3/4 mile to a mile away. ÊOn the plus side, by the time we got to Bi-Rite, our ice cream was waiting for us. ÊI had the salted caramel which was actually chosen for me. ÊI don't even know how to describe the power this ice cream had over me. ÊThe flavor was so intense and so incredibly yummy.

OK, based on all the raves, I was expecting this place to be phenomenal. It was not. Seeing the crazy lines, I swung by one day in the mid-afternoon on a weekday, no line. The workers were all really friendly, knowledgeable and not holier-than-thou, which I fretted. Anyway, the flavors are pretty cool (do I really need lavender in my ice cream?). I asked an off-duty worker what her favorite was, and she actually said Snickers. That turned me off right there. She told me they used organic ingredients, so that re-piqued my interest. I went with what I thought would be classy, pure flavors - coconut and, shit, i can't remember the second one, that's how non-amazing it was. Anyway, at least you can get two flavors in a "single" cup. They give you this flat double-ended wooden spoon (remind you of ice cream in a pull-top?). C'mon, can you at least gimme a spoon I can scoop with? The flavors were fresh, the dish creamy. But it wasn't outta-this-world amazing. Those of you from New England - - remember the original Steve's in Somerville (before they franchised?). It's not as good as that (no smoosh-ins!). So, yeah, in short, it's good, but not Berthillon-Glacier-Paris amazing or Giolitti-Rome-gelato amazing. And, in fact, I think Mitchell's gets the nod for the original but unpretentious (c'mon, did you say "lavender?!") flavors: buko, halo halo, langka, lychee, macapuno, and ube. When you go to Mitchell's, you'll also notice that the clientele seems more "real people" too (more clients of different ethnic backgrounds, ages, and income levels).

i fancy myself to have a diverse palate and for that reason i passed by the famous salted caramel and ordered the honey lavender. at first it tasted like potpourri, but i really started to like it after the initial four bites or so. it had a sweet honey flavor, but with the lavender my breath smelled like an old lady's underwear drawer/living room for a while.

some flavors are out of this world, some are ok...i loved the ricanelas, the salted caramel and the roasted banana. i am a huge fan of lavender and honey and ginger, but theirs wasn't that great. the unenthusiastic scooper kind of make my experience a little drab and the cashier was kinda snippy with me because i didn't find the pints that i wanted in the freezer. i looked 3 times and didn't see my flavors, so i asked her to get them and she gave me attitude! i'll go back for ice cream in a mid week day night because i am sure that there are lots of people gathered on nice sunny days. they have a prime spot, especially being next to dolores park!

Some of the flavors are not quite you'd expect in an ice cream, but there's no doubt that they all push the envelope. ÊMy favorite is the malted vanilla with peanut brittle and chocolate. ÊThe roasted banana is has an unusually strong banana-y flavor, very much like overripe bananas, but it makes the best base for milkshakes that you can imagine.

I think everything has been said about this place already. My favorite flavors are the roasted banana and the salted caramel. However, my new favorite thing to get here is the "Afternoon Snack." which is roasted banana ice cream, home made graham crackers, whipped cream, and burnt caramel sauce. OMG this is the best! They will even do a small size for you if you don't feel like indulging yourself. Just be prepared to wait on hot days and occasionally on colder days. Well worth the wait though.

I went to my first picnic in Dolores Park yesterday and a friend disappeared, then returned with three pints from Bi-Rite--salted caramel, peanut butter fudge swirl, and mint chip--and ten wooden spoons.

ÊHe went a couple of times with friends, but finally I was able to make the trek with him to see what the buzz was all about. ÊI've been to Mitchells and Swensons, but in all honesty, weren't very memorable experiences. ÊBi-Rite definitely delivered on texture and flavor. ÊI tried their Salted Caramel and Toffee Coffee and both were yummy to the tummy. ÊThe Salted Caramel is a fan favorite, but my hat goes off to the "Ritual" Toffee Coffee (yes, you read that right, the use Ritual Roaster beans!). ÊIt was a perfect combination of coffee flavor and crunchy toffee texture. ÊIt was definitely multi-dimensional versus the Salted Caramel, which was good, but somewhat of a 'one note.' ÊI definitely want to go back and try some more flavors! ÊNow, just gotta try Humphry Slocombe....

Saw this ice-cream shop on Food Network and had to try the Sam's Sundae (They make everything look so good on TV). Ê The sundae was good, but I had my kids get the salt carmel and the pumpkin. ÊThey were both good, but the salt carmel was the winner. ÊI will definitely go back. ÊFairly priced and nice portions.

I have been longing to visit this place for the longest time! I came here on a Friday night, the line was not too long ( I expected longer ). I got a medium cup with honey lavender, roasted banana and salted caramel. I must say the roasted banana and salted caramel are both very unique and is nothing I have ever tried before. However, I can live without the honey lavender, I felt like I was eating a Glade air freshener.

AMAZING ice cream. ÊThe fads of fro-yo and gelato will come and go, but good ice cream will always be around. ÊI had their salted caramel ice cream and my partner had a cone with cookies and cream. ÊEverything was really good, but I will suggest maybe going for two flavors in a single serving so that you get to try more flavors. ÊI'm already trying to plan my next trip there (since it's a little aways from Nob Hill where I live).

The long line means it's amazing. I love to have a tacos-n-beer picnic in Dolores Park, then follow it up with the best ice cream in the world right around the corner. Honey Lavender is my favorite flavor by far, but they're always adding new ones to the menu. The olive oil and salt flavor is the weirdest I've tried yet, and even though I didn't get a full scoop, I was pleasantly surprised by how good the sample tasted. Oh, and the scoopers are really friendly and fun people.

Is it silly for a grown woman waiting 20 mins in the windy cold at 9:30pm on a week day for some ice cream??? Well, that's what I did last week and boy was it worth the wait. I tried the Salted Carmel- good but too sweet, Lavender Honey- delicious and light, Roasted Banana- my favorite (bias b/c I love bananas), and the Balsamic Strawberry- refreshing and hits all the right spots. ÊCan't wait till my next fix!!!

the best ice cream i've ever tasted. (and it's kind of a pet peeve of mine when people say that! Êone time a girl told me this restaurant in hawaii had the FRESHEST fish ever... really?? Êlike freshest in the whole world? Êlike fresher than the restaurant next door that sourced from the same fisherman? Êlike fresher than pulling out lobsters from the atlantic ocean and hauling it into a restaurant on a pier in maine 5 minutes after it came out of the ocean? Êlike fresher than getting fish at the tsukiji fish market and cutting it right there on the spot to eat sashimi? Êi can understand freshest fish you've ever eaten, but freshest fish ever? Êsorry, ish don't think so. Êanyways, i digress...) Êi'll preface it by saying, in my opinion, this place truly rocks out of this world ice-cream! Êmy family tried the salted caramel, coffee toffee, candy cane and roasted banana ice-cream. Êeverybody thought it was delicious. Êmy 5-year old son was so enamored with his ice cream that as we walked by the open door of the store when we were walking to our car, he peeped his head in and said "you have the best ice cream ever!" Êtell us how you really feel, son... :)

this place is awesome. the line usually wraps around the block but it's worth it. i had the sam's sundae because i saw it on tv and had to try it. the bergamot olive oil and the rock salt complimented the chocolate ice cream and the home made whipped cream perfectly. my future fiance had a scoop of salted caramel and snickerdoodle, her ice cream had cookies in it! while the ice cream is delicious and phenomenal the best thing about this place hands down is they sell old school coke in glass bottles!

it's really hard to form into words how i felt about the ice cream. i just kinda want to make noises and i'm pretty sure you'd understand, but yelp doesn't have an mp3 feature. Êthe line is down the block just like everyone says and you feel a little nuts for waiting in it, especially on a chilly day but everyone in the line is so happy to be in it that it just feels like you're hangin out on the block with the neighbors. Êthe staff does rush you a bit which is hard if you're a newbie like i was. there's just no possible way to compute all the creative flavors in such a small amount of time. Êbut they do let you try any of them, and with a real spoon which definitely enhanced the experience for me (don't ask i have a weird aversion to plastic utensils and such). you'd think that such cool and interesting flavors could only be served with a heaping side of pretension and snobbery, but this place is more like hippy utopia in only the best way possible. i ended up choosing the toasted coconut (noise: gggrllllmmsslmlmgr) and the balsamic strawberry (noise: aalalrflllnuuuuh) and now am totured by longing dreams of fresh tasty ice creamy special goodness on a regular basis.

After ordering a cake for my son birthday on Thursday. I , my BFF and oldest son decided to go and try Bi-Rite Creamery. We are die hard Mitchell's customers, but thought we would try it . First of all, parking is very hard to find on 18th St. When we got there, a meter man was waiting for a tow truck to tow a car on the "NO PARKING AFTER 4 PM" lane right in front of the store. We went in and we looked around and saw all the flavors they had to offer. BFF sampled the BROWN BUTTER W/ PECANS. I sampled TOFFEE COFFEE and ROASTED BANANA both very good. This place almost(not all the way)but almost converted me from Mitchell's. This is my number #2 place for ice cream from now on. Another great thing about this place is you can order ice cream cakes and pies, or just Oder regular cake w/out ice cream and they can do it for you. They also have a catering menu for ice cream party kits. Next time I plan to sample the other flavors of their ice cream.

i wanted to go to the other ice cream place but my friends were too lazy to walk there. Êwe were coming from the park so this was close. plus i'd heard of it before. we waited in line and i was thirsty and really just wanted a drink. water or a milkshake. they dont have milkshakes but they do have water, so i got that. i had also been thinking if i were to have ice cream right now, i'd want black raspberry. nope, no black raspberry. flavors with oil, salt, vinegar, but no black raspberry. no shake. i guess im more of an ice cream traditionalist. i dont like ice cream all that well in the first place, so maybe thats why i want something simple. not as simple as vanilla (which they do have) but still. i tried my friend's strawberry soy ice cream... he liked it but no one else did. i tried my other friend's sundae it was ok not special. also bad that you cant get a kids cone unless you're a kid. or that's what the sign said. maybe if i asked they would have changed their minds. i just cant eat more than a kids cone of ice cream.

for ice cream, it's pretty pricey but well worth every penny. Êi went on saturday, one of the nicest and hottest days i've seen in sf. arrived right when it opened at 11:00 and there were only 5 people in line. i had the honey lavender and salted caramel...so creamy and delicious i was willing to drive back into the city from sonoma on the SAME DAY as bay to breakers just for a second helping of the same exact flavor combo. Êbi rite ice cream at dolores park on a sunny saturday. i can't think of a better way to spend the day.

rituals coffee toffee is absolutely divine, especially if you get a scoop from a fresh full tub and get all the toffee sprinkled on top. Êif you buy a pint, make sure you get a fresh hand packed pint, not one from the freezer. Êthe popsicles are great too, but overpriced.

adding to the raving reviews...yes. Êi went to bi-rite for the first time years ago. Êthat one street just has great places...b/t tartine bakery and pizzeria delfina, bi-rite is the superb added bonus. Êafter moving up to norcal recently, i had to go back. Êi have been back 3 times in the last 3 weeks. Êone week i went twice! Êi know...its all about the salted caramel although i have to say that too much of one thing makes it not so good. Êwe bought a pint and shared it last weekend with 3 friends...it was a little too much of the flavor. Êa small scoop is perfect. Êi've had the banana (highly recommend), coffee toffee (i still prefer baskin robbins jamoca more), and the toasted coconut (i still prefer the rite aid pinneapple coconut more). Êtoasted coconut has real coco flakes but i wanted more flavor...it was not as flavorful as i wanted it. Êif you have never been to bi-rite, go! Êlines are usually 15 - 20 minutes regardless of day/night it seems. Êif you are up to purchasing pints (7.99 each), you can do that thru the soft serve window...i didn't know this until last time. Êthis way, no wait.
