You can never go wrong with Umami burger! Classy hamburgers that don't make you feel like you have to run 10 miles after just to make it up. Food taste delightful, original and "healthy(?)" Always the best place to go with family and friends for a casual / classy / fun meal

Hands down the best burger I've had! I love their truffle burger. I'm not a big meat eater except for the occasional Korean BBQ and steak, but I LOVED their meat. It is juicy and melts in your mouth. Their sweet potato fries are okay. Didn't really care for it. Just get their regular fries.. My husband and I also love their shake and get it every time we go.

Bastards! How DARE you close the original location.  The Miracle Mile gave you your start - made you who you are today.  You're too good for us now?? I visited this place the first week it opened.  This is the thanks that I get?  Now I have to go the GROVE to eat at Umami.  Total BS.  Do you know how long it takes to park at the Grove?? I'm totally off this place now.

I can't even begin to to you how ridiculously awesome Umami's burgers are. I love this place. It's stupid amazing! You must try it!  I've had great burgers before too...a close second is Shake shack in NYC but geeez, Umami's Truffle Burger...that ones my fave..it literally melts in your mouth. Try it...you'll love it.

My favorite burger place..... so fancypants dainty.... so good.... so UMAMI! Le burger may look small but its actually pretty filling. For people who like eating very dainty fancypants good luck cuz the bottom bun gets super soggy real fast and you need a pretty big mouth if you know what i mean ;D.. cuz burger is really tall! Pro tip: squish with a napkin for manageable thickness, cut in half with le knife and rest on its flat side so buns dont get soggy. I like and I come often cuz my goal is to try every single effing burger on this menu. Tried... Hatch Burger - Good! Actually spicy not like dem other white folk who say "spicy" but it aint got that spice you know? Umami Burger - BEST! Newcomers should probably get this to experience what umami burger is like. The parmesan crisp is so fehawflehae good :[] Truffle Burger - DECADENCE! If the refined sir and/or lady doth require an exquisite break from the bougy fast food one encounters so often in dealing with the burger or the lowly peasant seeketh to expand his tongue's expectations the burger herein doth satisfy. Actually it gets pretty neuks fast even though its frikkin delicious for the first few bites. actually its not that great its just expensive. Cali Burger - Good! Tastes very typical burger if you came to umami better off getting something more exotic and umami yadidafeelme? Manly Burger - MANLY! I get this when i feel ppl question my already insanely apparent masculinity. This is like the carl's jr western six dollar burger JACKED UP very good but you probably wanna get like a pickle or lemon up yo drank cuz it gets heavy fast. Port & Stilton Burger - STINKY! I thought i liked blue cheese... i really did.... but so much stink so much..... ive gotten this about three times cuz i always think i like blue cheese but so much stank... i get woozy after a few bites and usually i end up jus taking out some cheese cuz so much stank... so much... Greenbird: my pansy healthy friends usually get this, i havnt personally tried but everyone always realllly enjoys this fake burger Thin Fries: very good typical thin fries i like but usually dont have enough cash moneys to justify buying it. Sweet Potato Fries: depends on the person... they put a bit of cinnamon on it which i really wish they didnt but some people like... meh Smushed Potatoes: ermaghed.. so gut.. favorite side hands down like on the table. They be like crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside i like to suffocate them with pepper and keep dunking them in the sauce again and again and then soak up any juices that fall from my burger until i lick the sauce off and then eat it. Umami Ketchup: i dont like ketchup so i dont pay attention.... its supposed to be different like umami or something they have like a mustard aioli.. best sauce at umami like the best honey mustard but better i dip my potatoes in them and i like and Umami has a hidden menu i think it varies from place to place but ive heard of a diablo burger, supposed to be very spicy if ur into that kind of thing but im not sure and also you didnt hear it from me actually whut? Overall pretty pricey for a burger meal, umami gets a bit overrated but everyone should still try it for sure. YEAH!

LA BREA LOCATION NOW CLOSED Good burgers but too small for what you pay. The hostesses are weird. Too young and not professional. The little room sucks, you feel like you're eating in a frickin closet. But none of that matters anymore because they are closed. The car wash manager next door told me they lost their lease.   The sign on the front says they are remodeling and coming back soon with new tastes and a new  look but it's bullshit because when it reopens it will only be a totally different restaurant.

I really think the actual Umami burger isn't that great so I never get it... so I ordered the Triple Pork Burger and it was deelicious! So juicy and the bun was perfect. The fries were good and crispy this day - I never opt for their special ketchup (I'm not a ketchup person..) but their other sauces are good! I like how they have a cheap valet at the door, it makes it so much easier sometimes.. but then again I wish they just had a bigger lot so we can just park ourselves.. this Umami isn't that large.. so not sure why they have a valet...

This place could be real good if they'd just COOK THEIR BURGERS! I went there tonight and ordered the "Manly Burger." It sounded good, but turned out to be a disaster. #1 Don't give me any $#!+ about how I want my burger cooked!!!!! I like my burger well done. Don't act like its an insult that I don't want it bloody. It tastes better cooked.... in my opinion. #2 The "lardons" on my burger were too much. I understand what you're trying to do, but plain old bacon would have been much better. My friend and I both agreed that the lardons were way too much and the texture was very off-putting. #3 I'm pretty sure my stomach and digestive system issues were caused by your desire to be burger snobs (turning your nose up at anyone who actually wants their burger cooked). I mean, if there's blood dripping from the patty....it's not a good thing! Needless to say, I was very disappointed with my first Umami burger experience. The actual place was nice, service was fine, but get real and cook the darn burger!!!

Four Stars is a bit generous. The burgers are delicious but too small. I ended up eating two burgers which made the meal hella pricey. But...they were so damn good. Uggg...bastards. People in reviews complained of "hipsters".  Um...then don't live in LA? I thought the service was adequate. The waiter was excited to talk about the amazingness of the burgers. I like the enthusiasm. I just can't afford to eat here often.

Went here on a late Sunday afternoon and waited about 20 min. for a table. Location is pretty small, only about 10 tables inside and a good number out on the back patio. Nice ambiance inside though it can get loud due to small size of room. Now onto the food, burgers are decent sized, and cooked to order. Bun was toasted crisp and meat was cooked exactly as requested. The flavor was ok, but I was not amazed. Had the manly burger which had onion strings and bacon lardons. I actually enjoyed the sides more than the burger. Special was cheesy tots, and they were pretty good. Also ordered the tempura onion rings which I was very impressed with. They were lightly salted. Overall, worth trying for all the hype, though don't think I would head out of my way for this.

I have no idea why people love this place. I just thought it was an ok burger joint. The burgers weren't all that special. Maybe it was their off day??? I had their Umami Burger and my friend had their Manly Burger. We both thought they were ok but nothing beyond average. We would have preferred In N Out over Umami. Some of my other friends rave about it so I may give it another try but I really am not expecting much of change of opinion...

I cant think of a more useless, over priced restaurant than this. Burgers? The burgers I make at home are about a thousand times better than Unami burgers at a fraction of the cost. This is where all the hipster douche bags hang out at or people who do not know any better. Call me sinister, i am a realist. I went here once because a friend dragged me here. I kept a positive mind frame but the burgers were pathetic for the price. I was expecting to be blown away. Burger king would have tasted just as good, seriously. The place is small and every table seems so closed in together. I hate being so close to strangers while I am sitting down and eating. its uncomfortable and annoying. 15 conversations are flying back and forth, I would almost throw in ear plugs with every burger so you can at least eat in silence since you barely hear the person your with anyways. I do not recommend this shit hole and if you think this place is cool and yummy, you are a common folk. Hip does not mean good but since its hip its good right? Morons. Keep throwing your money away here, I will spend mine at places where the food actually tastes good!

Umami is the place you leave asking,"What should we eat now?" Here's the running theme:  Dry. Small.   $70 for 4 people to eat burgers.  Thoroughly unremarkable and overpriced. $12 for truffle burger - which was mine and deemed the best of the lot but still utterly forgettable, $10 for small burger, $11 for Umami.   $3 per Crush and Mexican Coke in the bottle.   You could tell the ingredients were quality, the buns were good, but the kid's burgers in particular were quite dry - which we all know pretty much wrecks everything else. I was puzzled and my kids weren't impressed.  We were particularly put off by the service, which was bordering on non-existent with just a dash of rude (lest we think they forgot us!). Would I try it again?  No - I'd rather go next door to Wacko and blow the $70 on something to take home!!

Before I came here, I was in the "How good can a burger possibly be??" camp, but now that I've tried their burgers, I totally get it! I tried both the Umami and truffle burgers and liked the Umami burger more. Also, even though, the burgers seemed small at first, they were really really filling! I couldn't finish the last few bites of my truffle burger half. I also tried the famed sweet potato fries, which, while good, were less impressive than the burgers. P.S. My favorite part of the whole dinner was the "you are beautiful" sign in the bathroom. Thanks for the self-esteem boost, Umami. Thanks.

This place is really just average...... I've been here before and thought it was average before as well. Decided to give it another try last night and it didn't impress. I had the Truffle Burger ($12) which oozes the smell/taste of truffle but it was a bit heavy and a piece of my cheese slipped from the bottom of my burger to the place and it was also drenched in oil LOL. The tater tots (on the secret menu) were decently good though. They were infused with cheese and fell apart at the first stab. Lastly, I got the Truffle Beet Salad. I am a fan of arugula, ricotta cheese, and beets but not the dressing. It was a truffle dressing that was WAY too cheesy and overpowered everything on the plate. All in all, my experience was mediocre, if not on the border of bad......I will definitely not be returning to Umami.

Delicious burgers.  I had one of the specials of the day:  beef patty (rare), whole chunks of fresh bacon (not the strip kind), a fried egg, smushed tater tots, and onion strings.  It was such a great, rich, and flavorful burger.   The sweet potato fries are sprinkled with brown sugar, so way overly sweet.  They brought us out a new plate without the sugar, but that batch was burnt.  This was disappointing, but their truffled beet salad was delicious, especially the house made ricotta on it! Odd... a burger place that doesn't have beer.  I heard several people trying to order it! TLDR: Great burgers, skip sweet potato fries.  Go to a different location if you want beer.

It is better than average, but is it really very good? I think it is really in between those two. The burgers taste good and are interesting, but I think they are also 20-30% over priced. What Umami does have going for it are the sauces and the onion rings which are very innovative and have a great taste, but burgers are about the patties and the buns. I have to say Umami does have good buns. I also like the other sides beside the onion rings like their house pickles and the fries. The smashed potatoes are wonderful, but take note they come with lots of pepper on. The location isn't great and cramped and if you sit outside you are quite close to the road, but worth it for a great burger. The wait is a pain and I don't wait for burgers so I try to get here at off hours or go to the Los Feliz location.

This is more like a 3.5 but 4's a bit of a stretch.  Came here on a thursday night with some friends because we couldn't really figure out what to eat, so on a whim decided to check this place out.  I read a few years back on yahoo that this was the best tasting burger in America so I was really excited.  I think this place suffers from such lofty expectations.  In reality, its a really solid burger.  The meat is done perfectly and the lightly toasted bun complements the meat well.  Still, after spending 14 bucks I still felt like I had only gone through an appetizer.  The thin fries were way too thin, but the sweet potato fries were great.  They have a little tablet on each table which serves a dual purpose as a card scanner & a gaming device, but you have to pay to play the games which is really stupid.   This is somewhere I'd go if i was on a date, but not if i'm hungry.

With a name such as this, I was expecting my taste buds to jump out of my mouth. It didn't happen. Since it was my first time, I opted for the signature burger, the, you guessed it, Umami ($11). Shiitake mushrooms, caramelized onions, roasted tomato, parmesan crisp, umami ketchup; medium rare; no side. It was pretty average, and the bun lacked a bit of umph (I guess I am too used to pretzel buns but they are so perfect...); the flavors worked together but didn't create anything out of the ordinary for me. The atmosphere is also a bit over the top, with dramatic low lighting that doesn't really scream "burger joint" (which it is, in the end) but rather, steak house meets sushi bar. That didn't do it for me on a Monday around 2 pm.... Not a destination for sure, but convenient if you are in the area.

Finally, I made it to Umami Burger!  Only took like several years to get here, but I did.  Came here on a Tuesday for lunch at around 12:30.  Surprised that there wasn't a line, but I'm not complaining...spent enough time waiting in lines at restaurants. Had the Truffle Burger because I have a severe weakness against truffle.  I can say, it was a pretty good burger.  Very flavorful and tasty.  My only gripe is that it was a bit lukewarm once I got it and that the beef, while tasty, was still a tad bit dry.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's bad at all.  But man, when you can taste that meat, you can really TASTE DAT MEAT.  I can't say that here.  Bit overpriced for my liking as well, but oh well it is what it is. Also go the thin fries, sweet potato fries, and smushed potatoes.  Thin fries were about as expected, kinda hard to screw those up.  Sweet potato fries were quite tasty.  Loved the smushed potatoes, came with this epic glaze that I still can't get over.  Was still a bit perturbed that the fries were also lukewarm...come on, bring out my food faster! All in all, very good burger, worth the hype.  If I'm ever in vicinity of one, I'm definitely gonna come back.  But still not the top of my burger list.

Trendy LA burger spot.  Interesting burger choices with high grade ingredients.  I recommend the tater tots. But be aware they are only served certain days of the week. Wide variety of specialty sodas.  The tablet menu for ordering and payment is a novel idea.  The deserts are decent but nothing to scream about.  I also tried their pickle plate.  It wasn't my favorite.  But pickles are kind of a personal favor on how they are brined.

When you walk into a joint such as Umami Burger, you will quickly see that a good third of the experience is the atmosphere. With its dark vibe and gaudy Japanese decor, UB is quick to present its drink offerings as equally as valuable as the actual grub. This burger and restaurant feel trend is a little too ritzy... if I am going to get a famous burger, I don't need dim lights. If anything, they are a little lacking on the booze program, as their beer selection was fairly limited and just too dang pricey to pair with a $15+ burger. Add on fries and your gratuity, and you are pretty much $25 upstream for a burger and beer. Can't say that is super attractive for a meal that should generally be pretty affordable. Anyway, the burgers themselves are pretty good, at least unique to balance out the over the top pricing. Unfortunately, happy hour boasts nothing more than a handful of beers at $4 a pop and a couple of $5 wines and a $6 Smashburger. I would have liked maybe a half price order of fries or something of the sort. This specific location offers up a centralized spot for all who enjoy this powerhouse of a restaurant group--one that offers an off the chain burger called the Umami. As for me, I will continue enjoying the Smashburger a third of the cost.

I wasn't quite sure if I wanted to unleash this secret but.. against my own good judgement I'm doing it for my 31 yelps.   When my cousin came to Hawaii we went to a couple of places here and we ended up talking about the best burger places.  He told me the next time I came up we'd try UMAMI Burger because they have THEEEEEE best burger.   On a spur of the moment trip (we were only there for 2.5 days- 2 of which we were at Disneyland) my cousin asked if I still wanted to go to Umami.  I said YESSSS!! Let's try.   When we drove up, I was thinking you sure this is the place?  From the road it looks kind of crazy.  When you walk inside the decor is modern and pretty cool.  The tables have virtual menus and you can also play games on it for the kids (first game is free then it's like $8) Looked at the menu and decided on the MANLY burger.  We all got different burgers so we could share.  The table ordered the original Umami burger, tuffle burger and another one and we got a whole bunch of sides.   The manly burger was blow your mind good.  It had bacon and cheese on top.  I thought that was the best one until I tried the truffle burger.  OMG that is beyond blow your mind good.  I don't know what it was about it, it was juicy, the bun was soft, and the truffle infused cheese was AMAZEBALLS.   Their sides should be a staple in every restaurant.  Smashed potatoes, truffle fries, and cheesy tots.  OMG so good.  Everything was so good.  The servers were knowledgeable and friendly. And their water cups are so cute.   I can't wait to go back.  My new favorite but i'll still have to go to in-n-out.   Must try: Truffle burger and all the sides Tip: ask for extra Umami ketchup. 31 yelps ~ 24/31

One of the worst burger I've ever had in LA. I went there with a friend on a weekday and ordered the Truffle Burger. It wasn't packed or anything so the wait time is quite normal. I ordered Truffle burger, beef patty came out too dry, the bun is cold and overall there is no flavor whatsoever. Where is the Umami??? I'm not a fan of steak cut fries but I gave it a try anyway and it came out real soggy! $20 for burger and fries!!! Over-hyped, overpriced, and I went home still feeling hungry!

Came in starving and came out pretty disappointed and still hungry. For $16 I had a small burger and a small amount of fries (that I had to pay extra for).

This place is ridiculous. First, when we arrived around 8pm, we were seated outside in their back porch. It's a cute set up with wooden chairs and tables. But as soon as we sat down, we started getting whiffs of pungent odors every time the wind would blow - turns out there's a fat trash can right next the porch behind the wooden fence. It was absolutely disgusting and made us lose our appetite. We asked for seating inside, but it would take another 20-25 min, so instead the server moved us to a different side of the porch. It was a tiny bit better, but of course, the it was right next to the exit to the trash area I'm assuming. One of the busboys would walk back and forth from the kitchen, and throw trash out right behind our table (divided by the wooden fence), and we would just hear glass shattering as it hit the trash can each time. We had to stop mid-conversation just bc it was so noisy. Food? I had the ahi tuna burger and it was disgusting. The wasabi sauce on it was very light and flavorful, but I basically ate the sprouts and 1/2 the bun, and barely touched my tuna patty. Do not get this burger. I cannot believe this burger was over $10. Other people in the group had truffle burgers, portobello mushroom burger - they all loved their meals. The cheesy tots (not on the menu) are delicious and so are their truffle fries. Overall, I don't think this place is worth the $$. We ended up paying around $150 for 5 people who ordered a total of 6 burgers, 2 cheesy tots, and 1 truffle fries. $30/person? I'll take my money elsewhere.

An absolute Cluster-F at lunch, so stressful just standing there being jostled around waiting for takeout. The burgers were pretty good but certainly not worth such a long wait, def not worth the overpricing, and not worth being crammed in a 10X10 room. I never went back. Also, I wasn't so gung ho about the in-house made ketchup. Can't we just have Heinz? They've got the experience. They know what they're doing. Kinda overhyped IMHO.

I was still on a burger quest last weekend, after Fathers Office failed me. I figured Umami couldn't let me down. We hit up the original La Brea location, & it's a pretty small one. They do have a lot, but it's valet only for I think $1.50, just make sure to have cash. Umami is yummy, I love their fries, & service is friendly. AND they let me modify my burger ( which is more than the geniuses at Fathers Office can do). Since I don't eat burgers much I'm down to she'll out for a fancy $12 gourmet burger now & then, especially because they aren't huge so I don't feel like a fat pig when I eat the whole thing. If you've never been, it's worth a try.

I was super excited to come here because I have heard of all the awesome recommendations. Turns out, the portion is extremely small for what you pay for (~$14). Normally I would not mind if the food is yummy. I had their famous Umami Burger and was disappointing ):. It tasted oily. Honestly, I think going to In N out is much more worth it.   Pros: At least I tried it out! But I will not come back again

i don't want to hate, because it definitely wasn't bad, but especially after all the hype about the amazing burger and the umami flavors... I don't know. I found it kind of gimmicky and underwhelming. It didn't help that the wait was over-long (we went at lunch time on a weekend, though), but all the various umami toppings didn't make that much of an impression on me. I also don't remember it being cooked particularly spot on (I like mine on the rare side) or anything memorable about the meat. Maybe I'm just a classicist when it comes to burgers and want a slice of American/cheddar and a thinner, but undercooked patty and some nice, plain, salty fries on the side. Umami Burger is definitely not that. The place is not bad by any means, but I've never gone back, and I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to have it.

On a street lined with industrial-looking buildings lies Umami Burger, named after the acclaimed "fifth taste." This gourmet burger stop features a simple and straightforward menu centered around its signature burger. It is a small venue, verging on cramped, but the modern, Asian-hinted decor assists in making the restaurant a cozy locale nonetheless. As for the cuisine, the menu spotlights a few interesting and unique items, such as Tempura Onion Rings and Mexican Coke in an awesome glass bottle. On the particular day we dined, they were serving tater tots that were not your ordinary potatoes. They were filled with steaming, delicious cheese and came with a great sauce which made them one of the favorite dishes at our table. The Tempura Onion Rings did not taste too mind-numbingly extraordinary. Not bad, but nothing too special. The burgers themselves were mouthwatering, gourmet displays of true fast food mastery. The ingredients included sun-dried tomatoes, mushrooms, and parmesan crisps. We could not help taking our time with this "fast food." All in all, the meal was quite enjoyable. The burger sells for around ten dollars, which, if you think about it, is quite expensive for a burger. However, all things considered, it is a fair price for a delicious gourmet meal, as a meal fifteen or under is not bad in general. It is definitely on the more expensive side, and perhaps not as affordable for a student, but the eccentricity of the menu and the ingredients really made the meal.

Way too expensive for a burger.  I thought that at $10 bucks per burger that they would be huge so 6 of us shared 4 burgers and three fries.  $90 for 6 people (four kids and two adults) for 1/2 a burger and a few fries per person.  We left the restaurant still hungry.  If you've already eaten and you have an extra $20 you want to spend on a gourmet snack, then eat here otherwise consider this place a fad that will not last and save your  $$$.

After a good morning of hiking in the mountains, my friend and I decided to check this establishment out. Our timing this past weekend was impeccable as we were able to hit various eating establishments before the rush hour. I've heard about Umami a lot and wasn't expecting too much, but still, I had expectations. For $11 a burger, this burger should have been cathartic to the point where I was swaddled with ridiculously good taste and waddled out on just how full I had been. The knife that they provided was not even necessary; we smashed our burgers down and went ham on it. The beet salad at $7 was beautiful and tasty. My friend is naturally carnivorous to a higher extent than myself but still, was able to enjoy the simple taste of vegetative fare. However, since this is supposed to be a burger joint, I am still skeptical as to why their salad would taste eons better than their burgers. I think that we tried their cheesy tater tots (special) for $5. That was delightful though I am sure that it would be much tastier if the size was truly the size of a tater tot (you know, tot, a small amount?) and would have been easier to consume. We were lucky that we had forks from the salad beforehand as consuming these by hand (we tried) provided a very hot and stimulating experience (not necessarily a good thing when these balls are hot). Perhaps amend your menu to reflect that these are cheesy tater balls. Overall, I'm satisfied that I tried yet another culinary adventure in the big city of Hollywood. Would I ever come back? Possibly though highly unlikely on my own accord.

We were not big fans of umami burger. My husband said his "breakfast burger" with bacon, egg, beef, tatertots and sauce lacked flavor. He ordered medium rare and it came well done. I enjoyed my burger but it wasn't anything to rave about. I have the Umami burger.

The food is good if you can stand the obnoxious waiters. I wish reviews for restaurants could primarily focus on the food but customer service plays a huge role for me. I don't need to be pampered, I just want to be treated with respect. Have been to this location twice and each time waiter acted like he was doing us a favor and seemed very annoyed every time he stopped by our table- which wasn't frequently enough.

SIKE!!!! i call bluff!!!! it doesnt compare to other gourmet burgers like Golden State (they only have one burger, and they do it well), or Fathers Office. ive reviewed other hood burgers or diners higher than this but its bc this isnt in the same burger category. you pay alot and expect alot. their prices do not reflect their burger enjoyability. lets get to it. 1. the umami burger- all hype. whack 2. the cali buger- its pretty good. 3. the truffle burger- the only burger worth returning for. 4. the earth burger (veggie)- not worth it at all. my gf is vegan and couldnt stand it- shes a veggie burger lover. 5. theres a burger that has butter n bread pickles. meh. 6. fries are blah and the sweet potato fries have cinnamon and sugar, kinda tastes like a churro- not really what id wanna pair with a burger. environment- bunch of doucebag hipsters and whack ass servers.

I ordered the "Umami Burger", figuring that was the best thing to try.  They said their burgers are prepared medium-rare.   Sadly, the burger I received was rare-RAW.  The inside was RAW AND COLD meat, uncooked. Not only that, but the whole burger arrived only mildly room temp. Taste-wise, it was strangely sweet, except for the stale stick-in-your-teeth parmesan crisp on top that seemed made a few day prior.  Overall, the burger was just rather bland and lacked flavor, not to mention the texture was just ALL MUSHY WET.  There was no texture or body to the burger, just a big mushy pile of poorly incorporated ingredients. This was my second visit to Umami, after having a bad experience with their Truffle Burger, I wanted to give them another chance.  Sadly, it was even more disappointing and I will not be returning.  There are MUCH better burgers to be had in Los Angeles. Anyway... service was quick, friendly and on top of things.  Restaurant was clean and atmosphere was good.  However, at the end of day, it's all about the food.  I'm going out to dinner, not going out to atmosphere.

***This review is based on service only. I am a fan of Umami Burger and all its sister restaurants, however, on this brief encounter, I actually went elsewhere.*** On a hot summer day, I drove the hour north to LA to have an early dinner with a friend to celebrate his birthday.  I relished the thought of a nice, cool drink as we relaxed with good food and good conversation.  I had been to Umami Burger before, but not this location.   I got there about 10 minutes early and parked in the tiny valet served lot.  I immediately noticed a crowd outside, which I thought was odd because it was early for dinner.  Once I was out of my car, I understood:  A sign directed people to wait outside until the hostess greeted them. When it was my turn, I asked for a table for two and was immediately turned down...not because there wasn't room (the restaurant wasn't even half full), but because it was "policy to not sit full parties."  I was told to go sit in the chairs on the street and wait. I already felt uncomfortable, not just from the unsmiling, rude hostess, but the idea of waiting on noisy La Brea, south of Wilshire, was not my idea of fun.  Additionally, the sun was blaring on the seats and there was not a bit of shade in sight, minus the umbrella the valet stood under.  This pale-skinned girl was not happy. I found out my friend was running late.  I once again nicely tried to get a seat inside, and I was again turned down.  The hostess even rolled her eyes at me. At this point I decided to redirect my friend and go elsewhere.  When the hostess noticed me getting my car, she laughed and asked if I was at the wrong location.  I told her no and let her know I was not interested in waiting in the sun.  She simply shrugged. The valet pulled my car out of a spot, not more than 10 paces away and wanted $3.00. Seriously? I had been there for less than 15 minutes. I grudgingly gave it to him as I made a mental note to never come back to that location.

If I were rating the burgers alone, I'd give it close to 5 stars.  However, the tiny environment makes for long waits to be seated & packed like sardines at this location.             The servers are not very personable either.  They're not rude, but very detached & aloof.   They seem to be a bit on the hipster side, and let's be honest, it's tough to stomach a meal looking at hipsters.   OK, I get it.  It's no one's dream job to be a waiter at a fancy burger joint, but since you're working for tips, it's probably not a bad idea to be a little bit on the charming side.   Final tally: 2 stars after accounting for the tiny space & detached robotic servers, and pricey for the tiny portions. I'd never urge friends that they must go here, not if I cared about them.

Valet parking is $2.50. We were seated after around 10 minutes, which isn't too bad considering we came during lunchtime when the place was pretty crowded. I split my Truffle Burger with my friend's Umami Burger and ordered a side of sweet potato fries. The truffle burger was good. If you've ever had the Angus Mushroom Swiss Burger from McDonald's, the flavor is somewhat similar. Fortunately, that's where the similarities end. Their beef patties are so much thicker and juicier, and the truffle glaze and cheese are rich and flavorful. I also enjoyed the Umami Burger which had mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, and cheese, although simply listing the ingredients doesn't really do the burger any justice. My favorite part was that the cheese lacked that gooey cheese texture that you usually get in sandwiches/burgers. Instead, it was nice and crisp, which went well with the roasted tomatoes and caramelized onions. The sweet potato fries were a good complement to the meal. I couldn't taste anything special in their ketchup, though apparently it's made on-site. The burgers here are a little expensive and range between 10 and 12, maybe 13 dollars. They look a little small, but I didn't even need to finish my fries and water to be satisfied. Overall a good burger joint when you don't feel like eating at your typical fast food place.

Five stars for the Truffle burger.  Loved the truffle cheese and sauce . Both burgers had nice juicy meat, pink in the middle which is something I'm not used to but did enjoy.  The Umami burger came with a parmesan crisp and a sweet roasted tomato.  Also liked the soft brioche buns, with the Umami logo somehow imprinted on the top bun. The burgers are a bit on the smaller size, which is fine by me.  This location has limited seating inside, but seemed to have a rather large patio.   They also have digitized menu that will give you photos and descriptions of all the menu items.  You have to pay $1.99 to play their games though.  That's gotta be a sad dinner / lunch date when you're paying $1.99 for better entertainment than your dining partner.  You can also total up your bill and pay for it at the table. I also liked how they provide tons of free condiments, like aioli, hot sauces, homemade ketchups although I can't say I did more than taste them.

Ok.  So far i have tried this chain's La brea, downtown, and hollywood locations.  And i just don't get why people eat at this chain. The burgers are total rip offs.  your paying like $12 for a burger worse then Mcdonalds or Burger King burgers that you can get for like $4.  Give me In-n-Out any day.  For so called premium burger chain, how do they not season their burgers?  A little salt and pepper is cooking 101 man! And the sides are all greasy and quality is so inconsistent.  Sometimes I get stale bread and sometimes sides like onion rings are terrible because they use the tough stringy outside part of the onion instead or the soft meaty inner rings of the onion.  Worse the fried items are so greasy. I have tried couple of times figuring maybe the cook was off his/her game that day but no its the same old mediocre food.  The ridiculous price made it more offensive. Having pretty much tried everything they have..ie..burgers, sides, desserts etc and this one of the worse value for the money I have seen. I usually order a burger $12, side $3, drink $3.  With tax thats $19 then you have to tip cause this burger joint is staffed by waiters...waiters for serving freakin burgers!... so add a another $3 tip and your paying $22 for a freakin burger!?!??  helloooooo.......?? The yuppies who keep coming to this chain definitely must be brainwashed by whatever drug they put in these burgers to keep them coming back here to pay the ridiculous price.   Maybe if they dropped the burger price to $6 and got rid of the tipping of  the wait staff then it would be an ok burger place.  Right now medicore burger joint.

Umami burger is awesome. You can't really go wrong here when you're craving a gourmet burger with some high quality ingredients. Go for the Truffle Burger your first time then venture out to the other yummy combinations. Make sure to ask about secret items not on the menu (like the tator tots). It's easy to over-order here because it's like you want to try everything. I like how they serve lots of different sodas. I like how some of the menus are little electronic tablets. It's pretty unnecessary at a place like this--I've only seen this at high-end restaurants. Anyway, I think this might be the original location since it has the most reviews but I don't know for sure. In any case, this place should be on any burger-lovers bucket list. I wish that they sold the Umami Burger T-shirts that the employees were working.

Ok. The secret ingredient is Crack. Everytime I take my first bite I get the feeling like I have tasted something undescribable. Hense Umami...or Crack I've tried the Umami burger and Truffle burger many times over. Full flavor burgers, perfectly seasoned meat and good bread. Never a dissapointment. The only disspointment here was the pickle tray. Too much vinegar for my taste. The ice cream sandwiches are really good as well. Best Burger in LA or possibly anywhere.

I got the truffle burger and wow it was so good! Maybe it was because I hadn't eaten since 8PM the previous day and it was 2PM the next day, but the truffle burger was made so well, so good! The next burger that I've had that's actually made me so whimsical over a burger would be the 510 burger, but I haven't had one of those in too long. I had and order of tempura battered onion rings on the side and it was great! One of the better onion rings I've had. If you like your onions to be fully cooked inside and super soft, these are not for you. But these onion rings are cooked well, not overcooked, which will give it the onion texture onion rings should have. The service was good but the location is so small. Regardless, it was a nice atmosphere and the burger, wow the burger! Good thing they opened on in San Francisco, I'm definitely going sometime soon to try their other selections!

This burger joint hits the spot!  The location is nestled in the middle of the building and it's hard to find parking.  If you're here on the weekends, make sure you're here before rush hours. Their truffle fries are amazing.  It's crispy, flavorful, and if you try it with some condiments it gives a good twist to it.  All of their burgers are juicy as well.  They are known for their umami burger which is basically their traditional.  They have many different types of beer and wine as well.  If you want a combination, they have food and drink pairings. This joint also have poetry nights which is also cool.  It's a bonus to have entertainment at this place.  So if you're looking for a place to eat some delicious burgers and want to grab a drink while you're in Hollywood, Umami Burger is the place to be.

Best Burger in LA? hmm. I hope not but certainly somewhat serviceable. I was in LA for a wedding and suddenly the striking desire for an amazing burger hit us. out came the google machine and up popped a best burger in LA list. Umami was near the top.  Since it was close by it got the nod.  First off a burger place that charges for valet is a bit much even for my high tootin lifestyle.  I know its LA but really?  We skipped the Valet and parked on the side street about 20 steps away (I'm glad we saved the money because we were gooing to need it). It was pretty backed and trying to find seats for a party bigger then 2 seemed to be a bit of a challenge. after about 5-10 minutes we were sat in a weird room that had the acostics of your shower corner.  needless to say I rocked that shiz with my rendition of I will always love you (Dolly version not Whitney.. I am from Dallas BTW).  The waitress while somewhat pleasent for LA standards kept forgeting items or our refills on our drinks. We pretty much ordered the whole menu so I got to know pretty much everything they offer.  I really enhoyed the beet and goat cheese salad which I admit is odd to say of a burger place but it was tasty.  The burgers were good. Pretty good even, pretty thick not too big, soft bun, great toppings.  The fries were really good as well, and so were the onion rings.  I really enjoyed the green tea as well.   The bill was pretty hefty coming down to an averahe of about $20-$25 a person.  Which for a burger is a lot. It's a fancy pants burger but sometimes we fancy up things that don't need to be fancied up.

Between the food poisoning from the burger or fries or the Coke from Mexico and then checking out my togo truffle salad which had leaves that were sunburnt and soggy and old (leaves changing from green to yellow everywhere) I have to give this place a 1 star.  The portions were tiny, the burger was really greasy (fat galore) and tiny.  And I got sick.  Yay!  Not!  I will not be coming back.

While a favorite of many yelpers, considering Umami's burgers as the best is a bit of a stretch. Subjective? Yes. However, hamburger patties should be aptly seasoned and not possess as high fat content as Umami's patties do. High fat content effectively masks the (good or bad) quality of beef used in the patty, and in my eyes, is appalling especially as grease races down your hand and onto your wrist. Hamburger patties should be aptly seasoned. With so many choices for burgers in Los Angeles, I vowed not to waste precious calories on Umami's burgers ever again but I was weak and succumbed to the plea of a couple of my friends to have burgers here. Because street parking was nonexistent, our only option was valet parking. We were greeted, seated in the patio, then waited upon by a gal who appeared to be a former cholita. She seemed a bit apathetic. Tempura Onion Rings: 1/5 http://www.yelp.com/biz_… I certainly am a fan of anything tempura but not when the tempura batter is overabundant, soggy, and lacking crispy texture. Cheesy Tots: 4/5 http://www.yelp.com/biz_… http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Umami really surprised me here. I enjoyed the perfectly fried tots with embedded bits of cheese. Very tasty and was not salty. Truffled Beet Salad ($7.00): 5/5 http://www.yelp.com/biz_… http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Arguably the best thing on Umami's menu. Umami's truffle dressing is decadent and binds the flavors of ricotta, beet, and arugula. Certainly one of my favorite salads. Umami's best burger ($12.00): 3/5 http://www.yelp.com/biz_… http://www.yelp.com/biz_… This is Umami's best burger. It is succulent and has a dynamic flavor combination comprised of truffled cheese and truffle glaze. But the problem remains a patty that simply has too much fat. I failed to mention that this burger is marginally larger than a slider. There are two burgers I crave and most assuredly am able to enjoy often: 1. The Comme Ça Burger 2. The Office Burger at Father's Office I certainly do not crave Umami burgers. A mere 10-15 minute drive is all that separates you from possibly having just an okay burger or an amazing burger. It's your choice.

The burgers are good.. they're "unique" and the bread they use is pretty darn delicious.. However taking account the portions and the price.. it's not as worth it as people may think.  I've had other "gourmet" burgers elsewhere that are just as good or better for a cheaper price.. I would rate this 3.5 but I lowered it to 3 because when I ordered onion rings.. I literally got like 4 rings.. definitely not worth it.. their sweet potato fries are good.. standard sweet potato fries you'd find anywhere else.. One cool thing about this place is that they give you 4 different sauces.. and i'm a saucy person so that's a +1 in my book. burger-wise all of the ones we ordered were good.. Most of them were recommendations of our waiter.. You probably won't go wrong here. but some people might leave not completely full and a slightly empty wallet

It pains me to leave any establishment with "meh" ratings...BUT: 1) Long wait & no reservations taken 2) Valet parking due to hard-to-find street parking 3) Teeny tiny (albeit delish) burgers leaves one hungry even with side orders.  Love the Umami ketchup.  Umami burger still most-preferred. 4) No alcohol license at this location 5) Service was truly meh [one in SaMo is much friendlier] Overall 3 stars: Creative gourmet burgers but improvements much needed~

My friend had the truffle burger which I took half of because the first bite made me "OOOOOOOOOMGGG". Their sweet potato fries are TO DIE FOR good. The amount of flavor constantly bursting in my mouth was insane.. SIDE OF PICKLES. We were literally expecting a plate of regular pickles out of the jar or something but it came in this plate with 9 different types of pickles. They even had kimchi, pickled mushrooms (gross), pickled cauliflower, pickled beets, and pickles tomatoes. Amazing. Their ice cream sandwiches was reallyyyyyyyy good too. Best to share because the burger, despite the small size, will fill you up for sure. Organic food for the win!

Umami: One of the five basic tastes, the meaty or savory taste... Must-haves: Cheese Tot's [B+], Pastrami Burger [B], Sweet Potato Fries [B] Skip: N/A As I said in my Slater's 50/50 review, burgers suffer from the "Cupcake Dilemma." You can have a great cupcake, but in the end....it's still just a cupcake. In my Slater's review, I compared Slater's to Umami in deliciousness but acknowledged the different style of burger. While Slater's will give its customers big tradition burgers full of flavor, Umami takes a more modern approach. Burgers are smaller, patties are smaller, and appearance is more elegant and hip. I feel like this burger could be served at a really expensive restaurant that has smaller portions. That said Umami gives you the flavor you would expect at a really expensive restaurant. I ordered a Pastrami burger, which really is an Umami burger with 1 thick slice of pastrami. When I chomped into it, I was really impressed by the flavor. Burger patty was juicy and didn't taste like poor quality ground beef. Pastrami wasn't overly salty and complemented the patty well.

I hear this is the original location so it was quite nice to be able to tell our friends visiting from out of town. =) Service: Seating attendee outside was super friendly and courteous. And the wait staff was very attentive all night. Even when we had a little spill at our table, one of the wait staff came flying in from nowhere with a blue towel to clean up the spill. WOW~! You'd think with that swiftness that his only job was to wait for spills. Excellent service. Food: We loved the cheesy tator-tots!!! Must try! Half the table enjoyed the tuna fish burger, perfectly seared with slices of sushi ginger and pickled carrots on top. The most interesting + yummy sauce was the one that tasted like fresh cucumbers (not sure of the name). Overall much smaller than the other locations we've been to but the quaintness and lovely staff make this a location worth coming back to. Thank you guys!! ^_^

Definitely overrated. I've heard such amazing things about Umami burger, but it really didn't live up to my expectations. I had the truffle burger, but I really couldn't taste or smell much of the truffle flavor that I was so excited for. I also found the burger tasting really sweet, which I really didn't like. Our waiter made a big deal about how great their ketchup that they make in house. I wasn't all that impressed. The fries were good, but not great. The onion rings were pretty tasty. Long wait. Tiny restaurant. Decent service. Mediocre burgers. Tiny portions.

Hands down the best burger I've ever eaten! The truffle burger is absolutely delicious!  The restaurant is a little small, I went on a Friday night and had to wait a bit for a table but it was totally worth it.  The sweet potato french fries are also heavenly, however its my horrible weakness for truffles that keeps me coming back.  If you order another burger, they are kind of challenging about making substitutes, so if you are a picky eater keep that in mind!

Umami burger, I'm not impressed by you. Your burgers tend to leave me in thirst for water because I feel like my blood had just been infused with copious amounts of sodium. I also feel like my heart slows down because the burgers are that rich and oily, not in a good way. Don't see what the hype is all about. Best thing about umami? The beer battered tempura onion rings. Delicious, about the only delicious thing on the menu. Tsk tsk, shame on you guys for paying off Yahoo to name you the best burger in America. I LAUGH! -____-

Visiting from Chicago, we have similar "burger bar" concepts; however, none are as good as the "Truffle Burger" at the price point sold.  I will admit that I put ketchup on everything!  So when the "Truffle Burger" came out with literally just the meat and a piece of cheese, I was a little concerned.  However, after one bite, I realized any additional condiment would have done injustice to the burger. The fries are good; however, there are better out there (DMK & Rockit in Chicago).  But overall, the 25 minute wait was definitely worth it for the the "Truffle" and "Umami" burgers.

Had a bite of the little lady's umami burger and thought it was an above par burger but definitely not the best burger I have ever had. Tempura onion rings were tasty and the truffle cheese fries were okay. Definitely west la prices at $45 for 2 burgers, 2 sides, and 2 drinks, but the services was excellent! The best part of the meal was the entertainment!

Umami burger..u got me feeling rip off! I can not believe I spent $40 for two people on eating on just burgers and fries when I can eaten AYCE Korean BBQ for the same price!! So $12 for truffle burger, $11 for Umami burger, $6 truffle fries, and $3 a drink...it all adds up. So the little burgers came in such a big plate, which they at least should had made it fancy looking for that price I say. Worst part, I was still hungry (or maybe I am just a big eater)!! Still the fries with truffle was not big size either. The customer service is nice though I have to say, since the guy kept coming back to see how we were doing. However, this place is small and they ran out of tables so we had to seat in bar seats in the little room...once again this is the second reason I felt ripe off!! I This place is overly hype by people it seem, since I had better burgers at cheaper prices or even at the same price. I would not come back unfortunately. Also, forgot to mention they do valet parking, a third ripe off!!

After a hike (almost) to the Observatory in Griffith Park, my man and I thought it fitting to treat ourselves to something we couldn't really get in the LBC....Umami Burger! After seeing this on "The Best Thing I've Ever Eaten", we pretty much had no choice but to force ourselves over to one of their 3 relatively close locations and grub! It wasn't hard to find...and, we passed Pinks on the way (still have yet to go there). Once we found it, we dropped our car off to be valeted. Kind of comical to enter a small strip mallish area and valet your car to eat some burgers. But, hey, this is LA people...this is LA. Once inside, the service was friendly and we took a seat at a small table. Still hurtin from our hike, we ordered ice water, stat. It came in these cool "stemless" glasses shaped like wine glasses. But, they were plastic and had a little place for your thumb. Clearly I like the glasses. Onto the food. We ordered what would turn out to be a ton of food: he had a pork stilton burger, i had the umami; he ordered a side of onion rings, I ordered sweet potato fries; AND we split a pickling tray. The tray of pickled veggies came out first. It was a beautiful presentation that had a plethora of colors and flavors with mushrooms, beets, pickles, carrots and more. Then our burgers arrived with their accouterments. All of their burgers are cooked medium - medium rare, so be ready. But, this temperature and the brioche bun and all the goodies are the burger make it melt in your mouth. As I sit here eating my blueberries and greek yogurt, I am craving this sensation. This was a while ago, and I think I've mentally blocked out what the bill was...but, it was not cheap. Regardless, whenever I find myself in this neck of the woods, craving a burger...it's likely I will return.

Named after the "fifth taste", Umami Burger would be better off concentrating on the first four. The "Port and Stilton" (named for a cheese that is not present in the burger) was a huge disappointment.  All I could taste was blue cheese.  Salty, low quality, blue cheese.  I couldn't taste the burger at ALL, and I was thirsting something fierce from the intense saltiness. This is a classic example of how people think they're getting a quality product just because it costs more.  Try Obo Burger across the street for a far superior experience. Also, not to be classist or anything, but the level of service I received was VASTLY different from the suit wearing business men sitting next to me.  Nothing against them (they were looking crisp!), but the girl went over all the specials and options not available on the menu.  She came around to me and said, "what do you want to order?"  and that was it. Oh, and any place that charges for ketchup is obviously run by assholes.

Mmmm Umami. I love you. I really do. Burgers are cooked perfectly. Complex flavors. Savory, juicy and indulgent. All on a fluffy brioche bun stamped with the Umami logo. Housemade sauces. Umami ketchup and garlic aioli are my favorites. Check out the off-menu specials as well. Noteworthy: UMAMI BURGER. A nice blend of savory and sweet (caramelized onions and tomato) to balance it out. Topped with a parmesan crisp and umami ketchup. Savory and delicious. One of my go-to burgers. TRUFFLE BURGER. Topped with truffle cheese. Very intense truffle taste so keep that in mind. Yum. PORT & STILTON BURGER. Topped with blue cheese and port-caramelized onions. Full of flavor, great if you like blue cheese! THE GREENBIRD. Your classic turkey avocado burger topped with sprouts and "green cheese". Moist and delicious. SIDES: Tempura onion rings + Smushed potatoes + Sweet potato fries. All equally delicious. Try one or all, you won't regret it. This particular location can get busy and seating is limited. Seating is also very close together. They do have a back patio but it isn't connected, meaning you'll have to walk around the outside to go to the bathroom. Parking is valet only, or street parking on side streets. Service isn't the greatest here, but the food usually does come out fast.

I crave this burger constantly, i have nothing but great things to say about this burger place. Now this isnt your average slab of meat burger, its gourmet. So its smaller, not as small as a slider just slightly bigger. I cant remember the name of the burger but it had blue cheese and port on it, ughh soo good. Whats really great about this place is that they have Mexican Coke! You can honestly taste the difference.

I had the ahi tuna burger, and it was good. The bun was toasted very nicely (the bun resembles a brioche bun), and the ahi tuna was cooked just right (medium). I also liked the addition of avocado, ginger, and wasabi flakes, giving it a Japanese-style presentation. Also ordered a side of truffle fries along with the garlic aioli sauce and their "special" ketchup. The fries were decent and crisp, and the taste of the truffle stood out. I would give this place more stars, but I spent over $20 for a burger and a side of fries (which I shared with my friend) that barely filled me up. The burger is probably the size of my fist, and my hands are not very big! I hear Father's Office has some amazing burgers, so I'll try their burgers first before I give Umami another shot. Also keep in mind their parking lot is valet-only. If you don't want to pay $2.50 for valet, you'll have to find street parking.

Very small restaurant. Don't go in thinking you're going to stretch your legs. The valet is a little unnecessary. Bun is amazing. Meat is amazing. Cheese is amazing. Service is amazing. Ambiance is amazing. Sides were pretty good. Don't salt and ketchup your food right away. TASTE it without your additions. You'll be impressed at what they can do with seemingly so little seasoning.

On my mini vacation to LA I was told this is one of the places I had to stop and eat at. Lets start with the food. We ordered the original umami burger (figured I should since its the name of the restaurant) and it was so flavorful and delicious! The bread offered a certain crisped that I loved and it was cooked medium which was perfect. The flavor s that came with the burger was amazing. We also order the tempura fried onion rings which were crispy and went well with my meal. I was, however, very disappointed with my dining experience. We were seated at the outside patio with the chefs coming in and out of the back door. I, personally, hate being able to see the kitchen when I'm eating. They're taking out the trash, yelling across the kitchen, and whatever else goes out the back door. It ruins the magic. Not to mention the flies I had to keep fanning a way from our food. That was a real bummer. Middle rating for awesome food, but meh dining.

I was ready to be wowed based on all the rave reviews and even one of our friends goes nuts over this place. I forgot which burger we ordered, but from the description, it sounded very flavorful (bacon and all that good stuff). However, I was kind of disappointed. My first bite was delicious, but after that, it tasted a bit bland. Maybe I should have went with the truffle burger to compare with Lunchbox Laboratory's here in Seattle, but then again, all of Lunchbox Lab's burgers are amazing, and I didn't expect any less from Umami. However, their stuffed tater tots were delicious, and so were their sweet potato fries.

Yes, yes and yes please! I'm a burger snob, and this is one of my most favorite burger spots in LA, if not THE favorite. I visit other burger places thinking to find Umami's top contender. Still no luck! Try anything on the menu. I love all their burgers, but if you're new to this place get the Umami Burger and you won't be disappointed. The flavors will punch you in the face and leave you wanting more. The burgers are juicy & messy - just the way it should be - I'm salivating as I reminisce my last visit. The service may not be in the tip top shape I'd like, but the food just blows me away so I don't mind. Oh and please try their orange creamsicle beverage (alcohol). They serve you a classic bottle of real cream soda to add as much to the drink as you please.  So good. Such a treat. Do it. The crowd is a bit more energetic as everyone is chattering away (probably about the burger). It does get a bit packed, and you may have to wait for seating at dinner hour, but they'll text you when they have a seat available as you wander around that little shopping alley. I see some are complaining about the tab, but it's not your typical burger place and it's trendier, so don't expect amazing prices. The ingredients (brioche buns, tender thick patties, truffle oil, etc.) aren't cheap so nor will be the bill.

Had to come to California to see what all the Umami hype was about. From friends to food network, this place is renown for it's boogers. Gourmet burgers with buttery buns (although a lil big for my taste), thick patties, and pretty original yet simple condiments / add-ons. Ahi Tuna Burger is great if you're feeling some meat from the sea. Otherwise, the classic Umami with your typical shrooms + onions and atypical crisp can satisfy your burger craving quite well. Burgers aren't too big (compared to Texas at least), and great sides you should order to share as well - fries, sweet potato fries, onion rings! Yes, all of them.

Lived up to the hype! We got 5 burgers for 4 people, the 5th was dessert. Well, we also had the salted caramel ice cream sandwich. The truffle fries and the onion rings were also really great, and lots of interesting dipping sauces. We were actually sad when the food was done. This location is a little dumpy with traffic whizzing by the outdoor seating and something funky occasionally wafting by but no line! A couple miles down the road is The Grove and a looong line for that Umami Burger.

This place doesn't serve beer! Boo! The most boosted burger establishment. Anthony C. and I went on a burger binge yesterday. He ordered a burger while we were at Darkroom and we decided that although it was not bad, the burger left much to be desired. We had been wanting to try Irv's but the clock had just hit their closing hour. So we thought, "what the hey, let's give Umami ANOTHER try." The first time we visited, I was extremely underwhelmed. I ordered the Truffle burger... it was overcooked and under seasoned. Should have just left it at that bad experience. First bad omen upon arrival... CURB RASH!!!!! #@#@%#$ So that already set me in a bad mood. But one thing you oughta know about me is that BURGERS make me HAPPY! Well, juicy, perfectly seasoned, tasty burgers that is. You would have expected that this story ended well... well, it did but not thanks to Umami. Fast forward, I am beyond grumpy at the burger counter. We order a Manly Burger along with a side of fries. I don't like little baby fries, should have remembered from the first bad experience (though I must admit their steak fries are lovely). The burger came out, meat was cooked well but onion ring crisp thingies were STALE. Blah. Dry, dry, dry brioche bun. Boring cheese. The sauce was OK. But I must state this to even the playing grounds, I'm not big on the "Umami" taste. I'm pretty sure it was more prominent in this burger than the Truffle one from before but... meh neither burgs constitute the $$$ IMHO. Fret not, our evening ended extravagantly! Right after we ordered, I trolled my Twitter TL only to discover that the beast that is Grill 'Em All was posted in Echo Park!!!! Best decision we made all night was to go there after Umami for a REAL burger ;) Idk, even sans curb rash, this place was a big boost. In total, we had lunch at home, shared three burgers throughout the day + fries +cocktails + beer and ended the night at our beloved Taco Zone. Beat that?

I had wanted to try this place out for so long after hearing much hype and talks about it.  I couldn't think of a better meal than a burger after running 13.1 miles.  We decided to stop by the La Brea location because it's on our way to Santa Monica.  I was not impressed by the $2 valet parking.  I may sound like a total LA n00b, but valet parking for a lot that fits 10 cars is a little ridiculous.  We parked in the residential area behind the restaurant instead.  There were plenty of parking around early Sunday afternoon.   We were seated right away, but our server was nowhere in sight for close to 10 minutes.  I played around with the tablet they had on the table, which consisted of their menu.  It's a bummer that we couldn't just order using the tablet, like Stacked in Downey and Fashion Valley.  Our server finally showed up after the boyfriend went up to the counter to ask for help.   Here's what we ordered:   Manly Burger Portabella Umami Onion Rings Iced Green Tea The iced green tea was delightful.  It was refreshing with a hint of sweetness to it.  I regret ordering the Portabella Umami because this airhead thought there would be meat along with the portabella.  The mushroom was a bit too salty for my liking.  I would go with just the regular Umami next time.  The boyfriend got his Manly burger.  I can only imagine he enjoyed it because he gobbled that burger up in no time.  Onion rings were good, light and crispy.   Our bill came out to $28.82.  It's a little pricey but reasonable for a popular gourmet burger joint.  We would return again, and I'll make sure there's meat in my burger next time!

First impression: not a great location with the awful parking situation, but something I can deal with no sweat for good food. Second: It's cold outside, and as I step up to the door with my female friend to snag a table for ourselves and one other friend who is still looking for parking, we're told we have to wait outside until he gets there.  Two tables were occupied inside.  I'm getting to the part where I rave about the food, but this sort of service snobbery is ludicrous.  I can deal with waiting in the cold like that, but it's cold outside and she's a lady. You have a mostly empty restaurant. Unacceptable. Now, the service.  Our server was awesome explaining everything and being extra helpful as it was our first time.  She was super attentive, so she gets an A+. The food: We tried the Umami, the Hatch, and the Port and Stilton... I've since had the Truffle burger as well. I also had the smushed potatoes with the Garlic Aioli.  Ask for a sampler of all the sauces they have if it's your first time. Let me just say that brioche is the only bread I believe you should serve a burger on, so they have the base down.  The medium rare patty was perfect, perfect. Everything else after that is really all about personal preference, so in saying that... The Hatch is a no for me. Umami was great, the cheese was a nice little bit of crunch and the flavors were solid. Port and Stilton, yes yes yes!  I'm a cheese freak and this is probably my favorite. Truffle burger was delicious delicious, but you know, as many places as I've been to I'm not really sure what truffle tastes like or what it's supposed to taste like.  Like I said, it's delicious, but if you asked me to describe it to you today, I couldn't make any strong notes about a certain distinct flavor.   I plan on updating as I go a few more rounds of burgers. Smushed potatoes were great too, however I had an inconsistency.  First time they were a little more crisp on the outside which was a really nice texture complement of the "smished" inside.  Second time they were mostly just smushed, not bad, but not as good as the first time either.

I usually get one Truffle and one Umami burger to share between the two plus squashed potatoes as a side, which is amazing with their house sauce. With my burgers, I always have to add ketchup to each bite or it just doesn't taste complete. Nevertheless, it's still delish. love the patio area in the la brea branch.

Too much hype umami. You definitely don't get bang for your buck. To be honest, just go to In-N-Out burger and you will thank me you didn't go here and pay more than 15 dollars for a burger. Just the burger by the way. The seating area is small and barely any space for anyone to move. The valet seemed absolutely unnecessary for such a tiny plaza with the only popular store there being umami burger. I have to admit though, if you want to try their burger, just go try it so you can say that you actually had an umami burger. Other than that, I don't think it's worth it to go again. In-N-Out all the way. But one cool thing they have is their iPad menus and "registers" where you can order and pay from.

I love a good burger. AND Some truffle ANYTHING I love the truffle burger and the truffle fries (which are not on the menu, but they always have) If you don't like your burgers medium rare or rare then do not get the truffle burger.  Luckily I love my meat bloody.... I would also not go here before a night out because it will put you in a food coma. I am bummed this location doesn't server booze, hence why the location in Los Feliz is my favorite. My only negative is the host station is outdoor....and if you sit on the patio the service is really slow. Otherwise, the food is what keeps me coming back again and again.

Food here is decent but there's better burger spots in LA. It's a bit pricey and the servings are small, which doesn't help. I didn't think there was anything special about the normal Umami burger; I preferred the Manly. I had the oxtail burger once when it was a special and that was really good. Verdict: regular burgers are OK but not worth it. Specials can be really good and are worth trying.

It wasn't my first time eating Umami, but it was my first time at this location on La Brea, which only lets you do valet parking for $2.50. Bleh =P Anyway, we were fortunate to beat the dinner rush on a weekday and were seated immediately. I noticed that they now have little tablets to show off their menu (ie pictures) and stuff which helped one of the first timers. I ordered the Triple Pork Burger, which features BACON and chorizo + ground pork. It was mighty tasty just like everything else that they make like the truffle, umami and manly burgers. We ordered the cheesy tots, thin fries and smushed potatoes. They were all good, but the tots stood out. No room for dessert this time, and their little tablet didn't let us pay on it, but overall a good meal as always @ Umami =)

After having tried Umami Burger for the first time at the Hollywood Blvd location a couple of months back, I was eager to visit the one on La Brea to see if it delivered a similar experience.  What I found was that the food was very similar, but the location had a different ambiance to it.  The Umami on La Brea felt like more of a place to grab lunch, or get food to go, than a 'sit down' restaurant.  It was much more casual, and did not have a bar like the one on Hollywood Blvd.   The food at this Umami tasted almost exactly the same.  I ordered the Manly Burger again, and got a side of sweet potato fries to go with it.  It was much better this time than my last visit for one single reason, they put hardly any ketchup on my burger.  Now that I have eaten at Umami twice, I know what I like, and what I don't like...and I absolutely HATE the ketchup here.  It tastes like prune sauce to me.  The burger was amazing, and would have been even greater if I would have remembered to ask for no ketchup at all.  The sweet potato fries were pretty good.  They were covered in some sort of cinnamon mix that made them tasty, but I have had much better.  I also ate a few of my wife's onion rings, and yup, I still hated them. I would describe Umami as a place you either love or hate.  They have really flavorful ingredients in their food. If you happen to not like a specific flavor, it will most likely overpower the taste of your food and you will probably dislike your meal.  I think I have figured out what I do and don't like, and what I do like is really good.  I just wish they had regular old ketchup.  I may just have to sneak in my own ketchup the next time that I am here to have the perfect burger...

Doesn't live up to the hype. The burgers are average and over priced. I didn't care for Umami Burger very much--and was glad someone else paid the tab. Not worth the trip for mediocrity.   Go to The Counter to get your tasty, healthy burger & fries fix.

Love this place!  Inventive, delicious, great space, and fairly priced.  I have had several different types of their burgers, but love the ahi burger and the truffle burger especially well.  Ask for the cheesy tots (tater tots filled with cheese...delicious, and not on the menu).  Everything was extremely fresh, served hot, not greasy, but not dry.  Quality all the way around. The wait staff was terribly confused, resulting in a little lack of attention.  However, the manager, quickly noticed, apologized and comped some food.  Definitely will continue to return to this restaurant, and looking forward to trying other Umami Burger locations as I understand each has a slightly different menu. The only reason I am withhold a star, is because they do not allow customization of burgers.  I'm sure they have their reasons, but this is L.A., our hallmark is customization!

3.5 stars?  Really?  I just totally do not get all the hype about Umami Burger. Okay, it's a passable burger, but in a town that cranks out some true greats (not least of which the ethereal Father's Office - refer to my FO review), this just was nothing special.  The burger had not been transformed into something unique, the bun was so-so, the home made ketchup tasted like ... like ketchup.  The parmesan crisp somehow didn't have that unctuous taste that one would expect of something made of that wondrous cheese.  And the fries are a bit too mealy and mushy for my taste - reminds me of the chips one gets in a London fish and chips shop. Do yourself a favor.  Skip the hype, get over to FO and taste a real burger.

First off, I only review burgers.  I can't believe it's taken me so long to write a review on Umami.  Umami used to be a good case for the argument that burgers are built better in L.A., but they are now in the O.C.  Although I haven't been to the O.C. Umami Burger yet, I'm trusting it's the same high quality burger.  The juiciness and flavor of the burger patty is top notch.  It is one of my top 3 burgers. WHAT I ORDERED Main --- (in order of favorite to least favorite) Truffle Burger: 5/5 I get regular cravings for this Manly Burger: 4/5 Very solid burger Umami Burger: 4/5 Not a mushroom fan or this would be a 5 Port & Stiliton Burger: 4/5 Solid burger Socal Burger: 3/5 For the unadventurous souls Hatch Burger: 3/5 Needs more spice Sides --- Thin Fries: 3/5 Nothing special Smushed Potatoes: 4/5 Worth trying Sweet Potato Fries: 3/5 Nothing special Malt Liquor Tempura Onion Rings: 3/5 Very oily STAFF: Friendly.  No complaints WAIT TIME: Depends on what time you go.  Not a lot of tables.  We didn't wait too long. PORTION: Biggest complaint about Umami is the smaller burger size, but the taste makes up for it. BANG FOR YOUR BUCK Not great.  If you're a big eater, you might need 2 burgers to fill you up, but that'll leave a small dent in the wallet. WOULD I RETURN Absolutely

This place is small and cute. There is valet parking for 2.50. We were seated almost immediately after a party left. This place could be extremely pack during lunch hours so beware. Ordered myself the Umami burger and shared the smushed potatoes, sweet potatoes fries, and the malt liquored tempura onion rings. **The Umami burger was fantastic! This was probably the best burger I have ever had....it must be the Parmesan crisp for texture, or the caramelized onions..yummmm **My next favorite was indeed the malt liquored tempura onion rings, Oh my! a Must try!! Better than any plain onion rings I've encountered. The other two, smushed potatoes and sweet potatoes were okay, nothing out of the ordinary. For dessert, Salty Caramel Ice-cream sandwich, delicious, but I love sugar...so my opinion for this might be bias.... One small Unisex bathroom....EH! I can't wait for the Costa Mesa one to open!! :)

Of all the Umami Burger locations, this one is not as attractive, both externally and internally. The signage isn't that great and the parking is valet. I would suggest parking on the side streets. Our server was fantastic. All the tables have an tablet for browsing the menu, playing games, and paying the bill. However, it was not free to play the games and the tablet wouldn't read our credit cards properly. It's too bad because the transaction would've been so seamless and easy. It even had options for splitting the tab by grouping certain items and automatically calculating the tip based on what percent you select. The burgers are cooked to order and done so perfectly. As with all Umami Burger locations, my favorite thing is the housemade sauces and the round fluffy bun. Of the sauces, the ketchup, ranch, and aioli are my favorite. The hatch burger was great, but the green chilies didn't stand out so much. It really needed sauce to complete it. The port and stilton burger was pungent as one could guess. It was a bit too much for me, but it could be neutralized with sauce too. The cheesy tator tots weren't that cheesy, but were great as tater tots.

I've been to the Umami Burger in Santa Monica (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…) twice in the past, and today marks my second visit to the La Brea location. All of which I am extremely pleased with. My first time at Umami, I had the Ahi Tuna burger and I loved it! Though I do recommend it, I suggest that your first visit to Umami should rely on the Umami Burger or the Truffle. Since then, I've always ordered the Truffle Burger and it's never disappointed me. On the other hand, the sweet potato fries are a debatable item for me. I'll eat them if the other people with me want it, but I'd never order it on my own. They seem to be lacking something.. What I like most about the La Brea location are the tablets placed at each indoor table. You're able to look at the menu, play games, and calculate your bill with this nifty little thing. It's super cute! PS. This location has valet parking for $2.50.

I FINALLY tried Umami. Last person in LA. I have no excuses - I just suck at life. You're going to hate me,  but I wasn't blown away...and, there's more. At risk of you summing me up as a whack-ass valley girl female douche, I totally  tried to sneak my dog in my purse. It's not as bad as it sounds, I am whack (but not a valley girl), she's cleaner than you toddler and  totally discrete. Haters be relieved, I was still discovered and promptly kicked out to the patio. Humiliated and being hated on/judged by the entire staff, I kind of wanted to leave, but I stuck it out to report back to you folks. A brief moment of gluttonous panic came over me when I saw how small the burgers looked on the plates passing by. "I am so hungry. Shit. This isn't enough. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO." I was quickly silenced by a large order of very hyped up sweet potato fries all my friends told me I had to try. Why they were covered with brown sugar, I know not, but I do know they were cold, dry and really not all that good.  Thank goodness actually, didn't want to fill up on that. I tried my friend's regular fries and wasn't hugely impressed with those either. The ketchup was homemade, though not as good as Oinkster's. I ordered the Umami Burger. I should have gone with the Truffle Burger, but we all know that's cheating because truffle oil makes anything delicious. Even though it does look demure, the beef patty was massive. I found the taste to be good and interesting, not the best thing I ever ate. The meat was perfectly cooked -  medium rare. After that ridiculous moment of panic, I ended up eating about half of what I ordered, go figure. Sorry, Umami for bringing in my dog and not loving your food. I'll let you woo me with truffles next time (still say it's cheating) and hide my dog better.

Friday night's big debate. We're hungry and don't know where to go... Enter Umami Burger; a name that has been all but branded in our brains by our foodie friends. So manfriend and I made the trek from OC to Los Angeles. Note to self: don't do that on a Friday night. Travel here on like a Monday, or Wednesday. At about 40 minutes to close, there was a line and we waited for about 15 minutes. This wasn't too bad as it was quite entertaining watching the valet park the car. :] The touch-screen at the table was quite fun, and listed SO MUCH more than on the paper menu ! Manfriend got a Umami Burger and an apple cider beverage as well as smushed potatoes. or whatever they're called. I got a Cali Burger and iced green tea. The burger was DELICIOUS ! Manfriend thought his was too. But, what really blew my mind out of the water was the ICED GREEN TEA. It was SO GOOD. Not overly sweet, not undersweetened, it's so hard to explain, but it was extremely unexpectedly perfect. Don't get me wrong, the burger was fantastic but I expected greatness. Haha. I'd pass on the smushed potatoes. They're rather bland. But if you MUST, ASK for a bit of ketchup. It's like a BBQ-y ketchup. That's good.

In this case do believe the hype. The Umami burger is worth every one of the $11 I paid for it. Great sides --- get the pickles and see what they bring you. Fries are outstanding and my dinner companion loved her veggie burger too. People rave about the burger and the umami flavor, but the bun is half the fun --- outstanding. Finally, thanks for serving a medium rare burger as standard. Parking sucks and you sit on top of your fellow diners, but it is worth it.

This is the best burger in LA. I love salty, and this burger definitely packed a lot of flavor in such a small package. The bun was good, the meat was perfect, and the cheese was unique and interesting. I tried the Truffle and the original, both were very similar except the truffle was sweeter while the Umami is saltier. I preferred the Umami, all the ingredients blended together perfectly to create a burger where every bite was bliss. I also had the popped potatoes, which were interesting and tasted like normal potatoes in my opinion. While the service isn't very good and the prices aren't reasonable for a burger, I feel like this is something that distinguishes Los Angeles as a food haven and one of the best burgers I have ever eaten. If you're a fan of salty or savory foods, I would order the Umami, it somehow filled me even though I was pretty hungry and it was pretty small. Quality trumps quantity any day in my book!

Love this place.  Every time I go there I try to take someone new with me who hasnt been.  The burgers are amazing and I love their fries too.  This was the first time I went to this location but the it ended up being just as good.  I usually get the Truffle burger but I also like the Umami burger as well, these are my two favorite things to order off the menu.  Anyone who hasnt been I recommend to try at least once, then you can be the judge.  They also have a delicious selection of sauces that comes with the fries which I always ask for.  Overall this place is really good if you are a burger fan.  Im pretty sure you wont give it less than 3 stars.  Enjoy.

66% Good, but not great burger. ***Short Review Came back here in Jan '12 to re-try the Umami burger (visited a few times back in '09 but wanted to see if my opinion changed) Overall I found myself enjoying the Umami burger more than I did prior. It is a good burger, but I wouldn't place it as one as my favorites. The Umami burger does have character for certain, there's nothing out there that's similar in terms of use of condiments. -the good; the beef used is certainly tasty the good is that, cooked 'medium rare' the beef patty has a good char. there is a good play of textures from the crunchy cheese to the more chewy shitake mushroom. bun used is pretty light, so the ratio between starch and meat is reasonable. -not so good; beef patty was over-cooked and not cooked as consistently as I'd like. the caramelized onions while taste good seemed a bit too sweet and obscured the flavor of the beef. (although I suspect if you like teriyaki or bbq sauce burgers you may find this effect appealing). burger is generally smaller than most gourmet burgers, and for that I think the value isn't the best. service and ambiance are about average. nothing really stands out other than the fact that the food comes out pretty quick. Detailed Review will look the burger further.  My burger reviews typically break down the dish by specific elements such as the beef patty, condiments, bun, etc. **** Umami Burger shiitake mushroom, caramelized onions, roasted tomato, parmesan crisp, umami ketchup ($11) (Dish Rating, 66%) http://www.yelp.com/user… I had this burger back in '09 and didn't enjoy it very much back then.  I didn't care for the condiments as much as I do now, but I still feel it's short from a great burger.  What gives it character for the most part are the condiments, but in some ways the beef patty is also very good, even if the execution wasn't spot on.  This is something I would recommend everyone whom is interested in gourmet burgers to give a try, even though it's unlikely to appease all. Beef patty here has it's strengths and weaknesses.  In terms of the good, the beef itself is quite tasty.  when eaten alone it is certainly has more of a robust tastiness to it, and hold it's own.  there were some noticeable juice and grease levels despite being overcooked for medium rare.  I suspect it would be effective with minimal condiments.  Char levels are great, the ends of the beef patty have a slight crunch to it. What I didn't care for was that the meat was over-cooked, and cooked inconsistently inside the beef patty.  parts of the beef were between medium to medium well, although never overdone.   http://www.yelp.com/user… It was good, but I think it may have been better if cooked right.  Will order 'rare' next time to offset possible over-cooking.  Beef patty thickness was thinner than I'd like.  Size of the beef also seemed smaller, not really something you'd expect from a typical gourmet burger, but larger than your typical slider. Condiments were good for the most part and gave the burger much of it's distinct character.  I enjoyed the crunchy Parmesan cheese.  The flavor of the Parmesan was noticeable, yet balanced.  It was robust but did not overpower other elements.  I loved the crunchy texture and how it blended with the crunchy char of the beef. Shitake mushroom was a smaller portion, but again the flavor is there, and it gives the burger a slight rubbery texture in contrast the the chewier beef and crunchy cheese.  I didn't feel it was as gimmicky this time around. I wasn't a huge fan of the caramelized onions.  There was something in the flavor that reminded me of balsamic vinegar, although I could be entirely off.  I felt they were a bit too sweet.  Although they didn't quite over-power the beef patty, I felt that it muted the presence of the beef more than I'd like.  The effect is similar to what you'd experience in a teriyaki or bbq burger, which is okay if the beef isn't that special and lacks flavor.  here, it's more of an intrusive element.  Still, it is a very tasty burger, and I like the burger's overall character. The bun works too.  Visually it seems like there's too much bun for the smaller beef patty, but the starch is fairly light and compresses well.  the ends of the bun have a prominent glaze and the bread is delicious by itself.  Despite some level of juices and sauce, the burger doesn't fall apart. As mentioned prior, portion size is smaller than your typical burger.  If you are a big eater like myself, I think at least two burgers would be needed (although I'm confident I can take down four).  Fries aren't complementary.  Despite the lower than average price for a gourmet burger, I figure most ppl with a heartier appetite may end up spending $20-$30 for the food alone (fortunately I was only there for a snack).  Value is so-so.

Food: I think the food is amazing. I love everything from the burgers to the tots. I've been there often and have never been disappointed in the food. Service: The staff act like a bunch of vegetarian hipsters who are serving medium-rare burgers cause they think it's ironic. The waitlists are long and the service is slow and poor. They don't call out names but just look around and if they don't notice you right in front of their faces, they will seat another party that had the same number of people. When I approached the hostess about the fact that she seated the three cute guys instead of my group, she looked at me as if I was preventing her from listening to her favorite band I've never heard of and then rolled her eyes at me. Tip: Call ahead and order to-go.

Well I ate here about a year ago and didn't write a review I'm trying to write more reviews on Yelp and really want to put in my 2 cents on this establishment. I would give it 2 stars (because I don't really care to go back) but since it's been awhile and maybe I forgot something I'll give it 3. The sweet potato fries were good since they had a brown sugar flavor (my favorite sweet potato fries are from Coles in DTLA) I was disappointed with the burger because I was expecting alot from the ingredients in it. I got the Umami burger with shiitake mushroom, caramelized onions, roasted tomato, Parmesan crisp, umami ketchup. I expected alot of flavor from the Parmesan,  shiitake mushroom, and roasted tomato ( I LOoooVE all 3 of those ingredients!) but I really didn't get the flavor I was expecting, perhaps my palate is not refined enough /:[ I actually checked to see if my Parmesan crisp was really in there! The bun was not substantial enough for me, too airy and squishy; on it's own as bread I would like it, but I didn't like it as a bun for a burger. Oh, if their ketchup is "homemade" it just tastes like regular store bought ketchup. I can taste the difference in ketchup at Oinkster, homemade for sure!   The service and decor was nice. Modern/hipster. Service was very good. It's a small place but I never mind that. I don't remember what day I went but it wasn't crowded, I think I went in 3 in the afternoon.

Waited 15 minutes to get seated and another 20+ minutes for two burgers and a room temperature fries. The food weren't bad but it's nothing worth the wait. The table next to us got a bloody under-cooked burger and all the manager had to say was "you ate half of it already. what do you want me to do?" the kitchen did replace the burger but the manager couldn't help himself to throw the plate onto the table like he might as well slamming the burger in the customer's face. The guy seriously needs a vacation and don't come back. Slow kitchen + an unpleasant manager = a ruined weekend night out. Avoid this location.

I'M DEF COMING BACK FOR THE CONDIMENTS!! -- umami ketchup and aioli sauce! Otherwise, no. It will be only a one time thing for me. This place is overly hyped. For $11plus, you get a burger w/o a side. I mean the burger was super soft and moist, but it was the size of a double cheeseburger at mcd's, which I would've probably been more satisfied with. Add $4-5 for a side. I got smushed potatoes and cheesy tater tots (they were good.) I mean, we spent $40 bucks for 2 burgers and 2 sides. I usually don't feel bad spending money on food, but that was the biggest waste of money.

Finally tried the infamous 'umami burger!' I was completely satisfied with my meal! There's a reason why so many people make such a big deal out of these hamburgers. The beef is medium cooked, juicy, and just mouth watering. We also got the umami fries (cheese melted on top) and the beet salad. A little pricey, just for one hamburger it's 8/9$, but totally worth it. It's a small restaurant so the tables are too close to each other. There's no privacy. Also, valet fee at 2pm when the parking lot is empty? Very unnecessary. But other than that, I am definitely eating here again. Just closer to my house next time!

OMG. I FINALLY HAVE BEEN UMAMI-TIZED!!! Got my first Umami-gasm. And UUUU-MAMI was it good. ;) What I got: Truffle burger: This one was alright. I should learn to never trust one of my uber-bougey friends' tastes. It was good and extra truffley if you're into that. But...I set this one down to make room for the... Umami burger!!! nom nom nom. My favorite part of this burger was the delicious little parmesan crisp. Ugh. I die. I could eat this burger for the rest of my life. Two greasy thumbs way up! (Oh...that didn't sound as cute as I thought it would. Oops.) Onion rings: YUM! These were perfectly crisped and delishuz. Paired with the garlic aioli and ketchup = happy tummy. Garlic Aioli: Standard garlic aioli haha. Good though! Mango soda: YUMMM!!! I looove how they have all these different sodas and drinks. Very cool. I wish I could take a box of these home for myself. I usually hate soda, but this one was yummmmo. Service was great, atmosphere was cool and fun and food was stellar. Now I know what all the hype was all about and I'd say I'm convinced.

Suuuuch a fan of this place, it's not even funny. I've been to the Santa Monica location more than I care to mention, so this location was new to me. After a failed attempt to go to City Walk one Saturday night (too much traffic), me and a few friends from out of town were driving back home when we all came to the conclusion that we were at an 8 on our Hunger Scale of 1 to 10. Thank the food gods cus we had just turned on La Brea, and I miraculously saw the Umami sign and made a sharp left turn into the parking lot. Parking is valet, and I really didn't want to deal with that. I drove down the next street over and parked on a residential street. It was kinda sketchy, but I just went with it cus fulfilling my stomach's needs was way worth it. Of course we walk in and the small restaurant is already packed. Luckily, we were seated within ten minutes. Every single time we come here, we want to try the Truffle Burger so badly but never think it's worth it. Our waiter graciously explained how utterly amazing it is, and we went ahead and ordered it. Plus some fries. YUM. The Truffle Burger!!! OMG the Truffle Burger!! You won't ever regret consuming this. Ever. The ketchup's delish here. Make sure you get some. Also, their garlic aioli...mmmm. Service could've been better. We had to wait and wait and wait for our condiments and ended up only eating half our burgers so that we could add the condiments on our other half. Had to flag down the host to help us out there. And what?! No alcohol here!? The Santa Monica one does so I'm not sure why this one doesn't...

Umami, you and all your dang hype. After thinking The Counter was expensive (at about $9 a pop), imagine my eyes when I saw Umami's menu ($10 is your cheapest burger)... and $5 pickles? There better be some flecks of gold in those pickles, Umami. The location is small (there is indoor and what appears to be far more spacious outdoor seating), valet is entirely unnecessary--but hey, its what we get for living in LA--and the portions are smaller than I imagined. I will agree, however, that the burgers are delicious. While the burgers were juicy and I'll admit, better than our dear In-N-Out, I cannot see myself paying $11 for a burger that tasted on par with what I consider to be cheaper alternatives (and now here is where The Counter's lookin' mightyyy fine). The sweet potatoes, however, were scrumptious for two reasons and for those two reasons alone I may return to Umami: 1) They were topped with brown sugar and 2) Aaaand they were topped with brown sugar (ha!)

I am a firm believer that once a business gets too popular, expectations of said business goes way up. This in turn reflects on later ratings of these businesses. Umami Burger is a victim of its own success. If you've never heard about Umami Burger and went in off the streets of LA, you would automatically give it the 5 stars that it deserves. But since there has been so much hoopla about this burger joint, the expectations have gone through the gotdang roof. That said, I enjoyed my truffle burger and fries. I recommend this joint to the max.

It has been way too long since I've been back to this place that took the restaurant scene by storm. So much so that there are copycats littered around LA(including across the street from this location). But the original is still great, albeit pricey. As a vegetarian, I am usually chowing down the earth burger, but since I still eat a little fish, the ahi burger sounded too good to pass up. Done in a mix of Japanese ingredients and American flavors, this burger was perfect. Not small like some of their others, this was bigger than my fist(how I measure my burgers). The tuna was delicious and cooked to perfection. The only thing keeping me from inhaling it was brown sugar dusted sweet potato fries. Now why the 3 stars? Too expensive for what you get here, period. And if I am going to pay this much, I want to drink out of a REAL GLASS. Why am I sucking back some special green ice tea out of flimsy plastic? This isn't hip, it's classless. Secondy, valet parking here is an insult. This should be a regular lot and if it's full, there is plenty of street parking if you aren't completely lazy. C'mon LA, we can do better.

Umami's Earth Burger is NOT VEGETARIAN!  The ingredients are listed as vegetarian but it's NOT vegetarian. I am violently allergic to fish and as soon as I bit into it, I got violently sick.  After the fact, Umami admitted that the Earth Burger is not strictly vegetarian....WHAT???  They confirmed it had "dashi" flavoring, which is made from dried Bonito flakes.  This was REALLY disturbing.    Very irresponsible!!!

Oh, man, I love Umami Burger. It's not your typical burger but they just get it right! The variety of sauces and their sides just make the experience that much better.We usually order the tempura onion rings with the jalapeno ranch and garlic aoli. If we're feeling extra indulgent, we'll also grab some beers. I hardly stray from the original Umami Burger -shiitake mushrooms, caramelized onions, tomato, and, my favorite,  the parmesan crisp adds a unexpected crisp that you normally don't find in a burger. I HATE ketchup (my greatest fear in life, makes me puke) and didn't realize they put their own Umami ketchup in it... once I realized what was in it, I just kept eating it. It's that good.

I finally get what the whole commotion is about. After waiting, what seems to be like an eternity...I finally had an umami burger. I would say that it ranks up there with the Father's Office burger but with a different LA twist. It's definitely a burger joint to try. I had the actual Umami burger and it was delicious. Sweet Potato fries are a must. The onion rings were a waste of time though. I found them soggy. Not even soggy underwear could be worse than a soggy onion ring. Also, they have valet. I'll try not to judge a burger joint by the pretentiousness of valet, but umami burger does the job. Even if it's a tad overpriced.

Yes, you will be paying $10-12 for "just a burger", when "just a burger" should only be $2-5... These burgers are pretty special.  Starting with the bun, it is pure, pillowy, perfection of brioche.  The burger patty is (I'm guessing) a dry-aged beef mixture of chuck and skirt, and is always cooked perfectly medium rare!  I appreciate the size of the burger patty too, which is about an inch thick, molded and shaped perfectly like a savory and juicy hockey puck...probably 8 oz.(1/2 lb.). Truffle- one of the best burgers here, the cheese, glaze, and beef creates an intense savory and a little sweet combination that is hard to describe.   Port and Stilton- classic, delicious combo of blue cheese and beef, British Stilton is used and the onions are grilled with port wine. Greenbird- turkey patties can be infamously dry, this turkey burger is juicy.  Delicious sprouts and avocado spread, one of the best turkey burgers I've ever had (next to Burger Lounge in SD, and soon to be in LA). Manly- bacon lardons, cheddar cheese, and smoky onion strings...a western bacon cheeseburger on 'roids, the huge cubes of bacon will punch you in the face.  Thank you to Carl's Jr. from the late 80's for this classic combination. Umami- their signature (and my least favorite) burger.  The parmesan crisp, roasted tomato, and shiitake combination didn't do it for me. The cheesy tots are a great side here, and the Japanese caprese salad is a good option for veggies.  This location no longer carries the delicious Milk ice cream macaron sandwiches, which was a nice dessert treat.  Separate yourself and your taste buds from food that can be 'overhyped' or 'just a burger', and simply taste and enjoy the flavors.

If I had written this review right after the first time I had Umami, I would have given it 2, maybe 3 stars.  But last night Umami redeemed itself.   My first experience wasn't very good.  The service was extremely slow and inattentive.  Food wasn't great.  I ordered the Umami Burger, and for an $11 burger, I expected bigger, less greasy, the bread to not be soggy, and just... better.  I could tell that the meat quality was good, but because all the other things with the burger weren't, I was very disappointed.   Last night I came back.  I ordered the Hatch Burger this time, thinking that it has to be better than what I got last time.  It was good, but not great, because again, for a $10 burger, I think it should have been better.  I should have ordered the Umami Burger, because last night it tasted amazing.  Bread wasn't soggy, wasn't greasy,and the parmesan was crispy.  I took a few bites of my bf's Umami Burger and instantly regretted not ordering one myself.  It was GOOD.  We also shared the Smushed Potatoes.  Loved these, but I wish they came with a side of a flavorful dipping sauce.  We washed it all down with Mexican coke and root beer, both of which were made with pure cane sugar.     Service was friendly and attentive enough.  They have these cool little tablets on each table that you can play on while you wait for your food.  Parking sucks because the surrounding neighborhood is permit parking only, so you are pretty much forced to valet in their lot for $2.50.  If you're lucky, you'll find some metered parking on the big streets.   I hope last night is the norm and Umami was just having an off-day the first time I came here!

Anyone who tries the truffle burger and doesn't give this place 5 stars based on that alone is insane.  Service is great EVERY single time I come.  I really like the smushed potatoes and the root beer (in a bottle). The truffle burger will change your life.  I don't even consider this a burger so I don't even understand people comparing it to other burger places.  It's just an amazing slab of beef between two pieces of bread.

No doubt about it - a really good burger.  But, being a super fan of good burgers, I find myself not going back there for some reason.  I just can't quite put a finger on it.  Wait staff was friendly when I was there - could it be the price?  A burger, a drink and onion rings = $20.

Im updating my review from a few years ago......I like this place but overall its just over rated, super busy all the time I appreciate the work that goes into what they produce at Umami -  I really do.   They make their own fries, the burgers were high quality ingredients.    However, none of these things make up for how difficult it is to find parking (or pay for parking) then wait to get a seat, wait for service and eventually the food - which is not bad - just not incredible.   The first time I went they made their own ketchup, the last time I was there it was Heinz.  They still charge you for extra ketchup even though they bring you a tablespoon.  For the prices they charge, I think its fair to bring a bottle of ketchup to the table.       Lately there has been A LOT of hype around this place and in my opinion its just not that good.  If someone were to say this is the best burger place in LA - it just means they haven't tried enough.    Again, this place isnt bad - its just WAY over rated and over priced.

I always opt for the truffle burger...even after trying different kinds I find that one the most satisfying.  Not really a fan of the regular umami burger, though.   Love the umami ketchup that goes with the fries.   I admit the prices are a bit high for the amount of food, but I think the quality is high enough to justify it for me.  Will be back soon.

Soooo yummy! The burgers were the perfect size (no food coma) and really juicy. I got some teriyaki pineapple burger thing (one of the specials) and it was sooo good. Had it cooked medium well because the server said medium was still pink. The triple pork burger was kind of plain. The sweet potato fries were delicious though! They had this cool tablet thing on the table that you could view pictures and descriptions of items on the menu. You also get two free games to play, so choose wisely or pay $1.95 for unlimited games!

3.5 Stars to be exact but I'll give it a 4 There was so much hype about this place that I had to try it. The service and atmosphere was warm and friendly, not to mention the interesting feeling of dining in a "glass box" restaurant. I was very pleased with everything we ordered: The Umami burger, The Manly Burger, Onion Rings, Cheesy Tator Tots, and Mango Soda. The best part and probably the most unique thing about this about this place was their tasty homemade ketchup and dipping sauces served in a "pho" spoon. Sadly, Umami Burgers are yummy but for the price I was expecting mind-blowing, out-of-this-world burgers. Don't get me wrong I really liked it but I just prefer old fashion lettuce and tomatoes in my burgers. Maybe next time, until then back to In'n'Out.

I really liked the upscale diner ambiance, and the amazing sketches from visitors on the wall. The sweet potato fries were very good with what appeared to be a little bit of sweet with the salty. I got the Umami Burger for $11. $11 for a burger with a parmesan crisp! At first bite, I thought, wow, this burger is amazing. I may have been mesmerized by the branded "U" on top of it. At first the burger was really good, as it was unique over any other I've tasted. The bun had that good underlying egg bun flavor. The burger's texture was a little too much texture. I had the caramel salt ice cream sandwich for dessert, but they must have reserved the salt for the burger, as it was just 2 cookies, ice cream, and a tiny bit of caramel drizzled around the sandwich. It was the next day that gave Umami 2 stars, when I awoke to--what was I thinking? I needed a gallon of water to quench the salt content. Sure, any burger can be great with a bucket of salt and most likely added butter or grease. I ended up having to go to In n Out Burger the next day to cleanse my palate before jumping on a plane back home.

The truffle burger is unlike anything I'd ever tried before! Unique and delicious! Because of the popularity, there is a wait. At the tables, we enjoyed playing around with the little tablets they left for us. I recommend coming with no more than 4 people, or else it gets tough to get a table! The portions leave you upset because you wish there was more.. We also enjoyed some fries and their onion rings. Trying the sauces was cool!

Not only their burgers good, you have to try their cheese tots, it is so good. Whenever we go we always order two different kinda of burger and share to get the variety favor and cheese tots, sweat potato fries with Mexican coke to top it all off. The only thing stopping me from going so often would be the price.

I'm the kind of person that thinks that a lot of restaurants put too much sugar in their food---if you're that kind of person too, steer clear of Umami Burger. I was really looking forward to biting into a savory and well seasoned burger, but I was so disappointed by this place. I had the Umami Burger and the Truffle Burger, and both were waaaay too sweet to me. Like, sickeningly sweet. I actually couldn't even finish my burger (and they're pretty small) because of the sweetness. I was dying for a little salt....any salt, please! The sweetness just washed out the entire flavor of the burger and it just tasted like a generic, sweet mush. We also ordered the cheese and truffle fries and sweet potato fries. The cheese and truffle fries were pretty good, but the sweet potato fries were terrible. I have a huge weakness for sweet potato fries and I always order them when I see them on any menu. The ones at Umami Burger were soggy and also covered with a weird sugar/cinnamon/spice mixture that was just terrible. And again...no salt?! On fries?? C'mon now. Maybe my tastebuds are just wired differently than the people who love this place. I'd never go back again.

I ordered the Truffle Burger with lettuce, tomato and onion. It came on a big bun with a U "stamped" on the top. I thought that was a unique touch, but the taste of the burger was just average. And I was really hungry, so it should have tasted out of this world to me. It definitely is not worth $12. The sweet potato fries come sprinkled with sugar, which my friend and I did not like at all as it was too sweet. The waiter was nice enough to bring us a new order of fries without the sugar. NOTE: * To our disappointment this location HAS NO LIQUOR LICENSE. * There is an outside patio, which is kind of nice.

Someone is going to have to explain their seating policy to me, because I don't get it.... Empty tables inside and 2 people out of a party of 3 are not allowed to be seated until the 3rd person arrives, and are told to wait outside in the cold? When there was absolutely no wait? It's not like 1 person was trying to take up a table of 10 seats during peak dinner hours. Anyway, both times I've been here, it was still pretty early, at 6 or 7 pm, so there was no crowd yet. Of course valet seemed utterly pointless, but whatevs. I actually didn't see the valet booth my first time and just drove right in to a parking spot in the empty lot. I guess it might be useful during busy times.... On to the food - I've tried the Portobello Umami burger (very juicy), the Japanese Caprese Salad (good, but not filling if ordered as a dish), and various sides including the thin fries and the tots. The sides are pretty delish. I would prefer for the burgers to come with a side, given the price of each burger. Umami Burger is a very innovative concept, right down to their logo and the tablet on each table, and the food is savory, but I feel like it might be overhyped a bit. I am still down to try some of their other burgers sometime (with meat! mmm), but I'm not that impressed yet.

Best burger I've ever had. Period. But I walked out of the restaurant thinking "OMG I CAN'T BELIEVE I PAID $25 FOR A HAMBURGER MEAL.." My friend and I ordered a burger each with small fries to share and the total bill amount was over $40. I feel like this place could be a little cheaper.. because afterall, it's just a burger, but I have to admit their ketchup is BOMB. I don't know what they make their ketchup out of, but it's no ketchup I've had before. I don't think I'd go back because of their price, but I'm glad I've tried this place out.

Other Burgers Are Inferior Two things you have to know about me.   1)  When I'm hungry, nothing else matters. 2)  If there's an option to add bacon, bacon is added.  If there isn't an option to add bacon, you still add bacon. My friend brought me to this low-key place after we struck-out at a few busy places (Korean BBQ is all the rage over there).  Much to my delight, the food here was awesome.  Seeing that I'm a man and I enjoy bacon, I feasted on the Macho Burger and some sweet potato fries (these fries are macho too). The best part of the burger was the bun.  HAHA, I'm just kidding, it was the BACON.  There were straight up bacon chunks on my burger.  Not strips or bits that you toss on a salad to make it less green.  I'm talking cubes.  Each as good as the last. It's a shame that I can't ravage a burger weekly here since I'm an East Coaster...but rest assured, if an Umami Burger opens up anywhere near a 20 mile radius of me...I'm there. Miss you bacon chunks.

After hearing much hype about this infamous Los Angeles chain, I finally had the occasion to visit this past week with an old friend from high school and two of his friends. I had heard quite the range of reactions to this place. Some have claimed it's a life-changing burger experience, while others have been underwhelmed at best. Consequently, I was never in that much of a hurry to get here. But, being that it's such a talked about LA establishment, and seeing that I am the starving artist, I felt it was time I check it out for myself. The location has a charming Japanese feel to it: bamboo-lined walls, Japanese artwork, and a lovely little fenced-in patio, which was where we sat. Immediately upon looking at the menu I was irritated. Burgers starting at $10 and you have to buy your fries/sides separately. This means if you want a burger, fries, and a drink, you're easily going to spend $20 with tax and tip... not impressed. I know there are many out there who are glad to drop money on a "gourmet" burger. For me, you can dress it up and call it whatever you want - at the end of the day I'm still spending $20 on a burger and fries. Though our waitress was pleasant, she wasn't entirely on her game - she seemed a bit out of it, and would disappear for long intervals. On top of that, we waited a good 20 minutes for our food. Come on, Umami, it's an effin cheeseburger on a Wednesday night. But I will say, I did enjoy my food. Though I'm not (currently) a vegetarian, I really appreciate creative food (and frankly I just was not in the mood for ground meat) so I went for the Earth Burger, which had a mushroom and edamame patty topped with house-made ricotta, white soy and truffle aioli, cipollini onions, butter lettuce, and a roasted tomato. Very well-seasoned and as satisfying as any "real" cheeseburger. But what I REALLY fawned over was their "smushed potatoes," described on their menu as "double fried creamer potatoes"... I had no idea what that meant, but I wanted them... all over my body. It turns out they were baby potatoes fried, smashed, then fried again, and served with a garlic aioli. A borderline sexual alternative to french fries - super crispy crunchy crust, light and soft interior, a little greasy, and alarmingly addicting. Well done. My check came to $19 after an even four-way split (my friend and I shared the potatoes). Worth it? Meh... Though I was not completely wowed by my experience here, I certainly wouldn't write them off. I could see myself getting a hankering for those potatoes at some point. And I feel I have to try the signature "Umami Burger" topped with shitake mushrooms, caramelized onions, a parmesan crisp, and a roasted tomato. But only when I feel like dropping $20 on a burger and fries.

My bf and I wanted to try this place out since we've heard some good reviews about it. Also, everytime I pass by the restaurant, I always thought to myself that I'd try it out one day. So...we did. First off, we got there for dinner and there was valet parking for $2.50. Which sucked because we were getting to-go and there was no street parking available at the time. My bf and I ordered a cali burger and it was no bueno. They put some sauce or herb in there that kind of took the flavor off and it was very greasy. The cashier guy who took my order asked if we wanted our burger patty medium well, so we said yes and when I opened up that burger....that was not medium well. It was practically rare inside. My bf also agreed that the patty was rare. I mean, guys usually like their meat a little rare but this was really rare for him. That was a little disappointing. The only reason why I give two stars is because their fries are decent. The fries are small skinny fries, not like those regular medium fries you get usually. I honestly did not think the burger tasted that great....the funny thing was that I craved In-N-Out after eating that burger. lol. I guess nothing really beats a good old fashioned and cheap In-N-Out burger (animal style). :) P.S. The burger was really pricey. For two burgers and a fry, it came out to about $26-27 dollars plus valet...:( so sad.

The only reason I came here, was for the hype.  Everyone I knew kept bragging about UMAMI BURGER and how spectacular it was.  I seriously did not understand why.  We ordered a $12 burger that did not come with fries, so I expected this burger to blow my mind.  I can't say that it was terrible, but it wasn't to die for.  I've had a better burger at Father's Office.  The taste was good, but a little too bloody for my taste.  The waitress failed to ask me how I wanted my meat cooked.  If I would have known the burger was going to be bathing in blood, I would have asked for it to be cooked Medium. The highlight of our dining experience was the tablet on the table.  You can play games and keep up with everything added to your tab.  Pretty cook, but somewhat of a lazy approach for the wait staff. They barely checked up on us. Guess that's a great way to keep you distracted and stop you from requesting service. "Here you go customers, play a game and stop pestering us."  OH, and you can pay your tab at your table as well.  No need to bug the waiter/waitress in splitting your tab. The place was pretty small. Not big enough for the rush crowd and the parking lot was tiny.  I'm absolutely stunned to see establishments like this that require valet parking.  I mean, you get in my car and park it 10 feet in front of me. Really?  I have to pay you to move it a few feet in front? I thought that was pretty lame.

Someone told me that Umami puts MSG in their burgers and that's why it's so delicious. I kind of believe it. Besides, the whole Asian flair on American food is not complete without a dash of MSG. Occasionally, I like to take my parents to restaurants outside of the SGV and we venture into hipster places like this. Papa bear was craving a burger for his birthday dinner of all things so, I decided to take them to Umami. We came on a Saturday around 6:30 and it actually wasn't busy at all (it got busy around 7:30). The host sat us outside in their patio dining area which, was quite nice. They had heat lamps up and hanging mini lights..it was very cozy. Papa Bear had the Umami Burger and Mama Bear had the Socal Burger and they both really enjoyed it. I ordered the Truffle Burger and thought it had a unique taste to it. The burger was sweet which, I really liked cause I love mixing savory and sweet. We all thought, the burgers were cooked really well. It was moist and flavorful. We also got two sides: the sweet potato fries and smushed potatoes. We weren't really huge fans of the sweet potato fries..it wasn't very crispy and seemed soggy. The smushed potatoes were definitely a favorite though. I love the baby potatoes and they were baked to crispy perfection on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. yummm. Overall, it was a decent experience. Service was great. We felt the prices were a little steep for the portion size ($10-$12/burger) but, it was a good one time experience. Don't know if we would come back again though.

Great burgers...honestly, awesome taste, but I can't eat here anymore because it goes against everything about my health, and the only place I allow myself that kind of indulgence at is Soul Dog.  Don't get me wrong, the food is excellent.  If you are a burger fan, you will love this place.  Of course it's expensive, but still tasty.  I can't believe I still didn't post my review on this place from literally a year ago, but it's a great place to stop in and munch down on a wide array of different burgers.  To be fair I like Father's Office more, and I can't say that they are any healthier, because they're not lol.  Bottom line, I do love this place, and once I get my body fat percentage back down to 8, I will work this back into my weekend indulgence menu :) Umami Burger, you rule and deserve your awesome 4 out of 5 stars.

Taken from the Japanese word for fifth taste, Umami represents an elusive savoriness that occurs within various foods containing the amino acid Glutamate and Ribonucleotides.  Serving as a complimentary expansion to other flavors and primary senses, its rich profile with the coating of the tongue and watering of the mouth has been deemed the fifth primary taste.  Starting in LA, they have multiple locations as well in Santa Monica, San Francisco and soon to be in Las Vegas. The original Umami Burger is the only burger we get; we've tried the others, and although good, nothing can compare to the original.  The Umami Burger: house ground beef with Shitake Mushrooms, Caramelized Onions, a Roasted Tomato, a Parmesan Crisp and its own Umami Ketchup melts harmoniously like a well orchestrated orgy! The Umami: well seasoned and robust with flavor, it is not overpowered by the condiments nestled on top.  The Parmesan crisp adds a crunch unexpected yet compliments the savory Shitake mushrooms and the tangy roastiness of the Tomato. And with the addition of the Umami Ketchup and soft toasted bun, this culinary crescendo reaches its climatic apex with an order of the Cheesy Tots (not on the menu, its a secret side).  I have been known to cry in the past when they have run out of these!!! These crunchy little nuggets serve just the right proportion of fried heaven and soft, starchy decadence.....And with the vast array of dipping condiments, you can find your favorite combination.  We're partial to the Roasted Garlic Aioli, the House Spread and the Jalapeno Ranch. Crack with a dollop of more crack! As for refreshments, we have our fav:  Bundaberg Ginger Brew from Australia. It's got a potent kick to it, but cleanses the palate each time to the mouth to receive more Umaminess. An honorable mention:  the Bacon wrapped Scallop Burger at Umami SF is a delicious alternative and a well, healed second place!  And now that Umamicatessen is opened Downtown,  we have even more reason to go to LA and try out all the new offerings that Umami dishes out!

After visiting the LACMA with my brothers, we passed by this place and decided to see what the whole deal about this famous burger joint is all about. Ordered their specialty, the Umami Burger, and the Angus beef was sooooooo good. Shittake mushrooms with their crisp cheese, WOW. We also ordered their cheesy tater tots which were a wee bit too cheesy (they give you a generous amount, so maybe I was just eating far too much). the service here? SUCKS. TUUURRIBLE as Charles Barkley would say. When we first ordered, our waiter wasn't friendly at all, didn't seem like he wanted to be there. When my brother ordered his burger without chili (he's very particular when it comes to his food), he gave us this sharpe look that I didn't appreciate. We had to practically flag down our ever disappearing waiter for water, but another waiter came out, gave us what we needed, and had this condescending look in his face and I just wanted to leave as soon as he did. Talk about snooty. I'd def give this place another try, but at a diff location. I wish I could give them a 3.5 bc the waiters SUCK, but i can't, so i'll settle for 3.

Went here today and sat outside in their heated patio.....the first thing we all (5 of us) noticed was this awful smell.....we tried to ignore it but that was difficult.   When I asked our waiter what that smell was, he replied, "I'm not sure but we wash the kitchen floor every single night and all the dirty water goes out the back door and under the deck"  and he walked away.   So basically that awful smell was bits of raw meat, and god only knows what else that has been sorta swept under the carpet if you will......The experience was far from Umami as the smell over powered the flavors of the food.   The waiter offered nothing in the form of a discount, so we suggested it to him.   He took it to his manager and a 20% discount was applied.... Very sad this took place cuz we love the burgers that ruined the experience.

Truffle burger with truffle cheese. Now wait a minute, snobs -- you suspect there's probably just a homeopathically infinitesimal  amount of truffle in there, don't you. Well that is not the case. This burger is packed with funky truffle goodness. Oh and the sweet potato fries? They have brown sugar on them! The pickle platter is kind of gimmicky but interesting. The home-made ketchup is tasty. The iced green tea is delightful. And the servers are all WONDERFUL. I took my mom and aunt and 6-year-old here for lunch and we all came away satisfied and happy.

To be specific, I wanted to give this place 3.5 Stars. I'm rounding up because I do believe this food is very good, and worth the somewhat expensive price. However with all the other gourmet burger places I've been to, I cannot in good conscience give this 5 stars. I still don't know why I paid $3.50 for a bottle of coke with no refill... Anyway, I came here with a friend and ordered the onion rings and smushed potatoes; both were extremely delicious and the right price, which raised my hype for the actual burger. The sauces we received with the rings and potatoes were also very good, and upon recommendation of our waitress we got the ketchup and horseradish ranch. Fantastic food. For my burger I got the "manly" burger and got the meat cooked medium. My mistake. a hamburger needs to be hot in my opinion, to really get that seared-meat flavor to combine with the other materials in the burger that makes them a global treat. What I got was lukewarm (but tasty!) burger on amazingly soft bread with similar-quality toppings. I actually loved all the food here, It just seems that everything was overpriced by 2-3 dollars. Just expensive enough to give me a momentary pause in looking at the bill. I would come here again if a lot of my friends wanted to stop by, but this is not a place I would go even for a pick-up lunch.

Sing it! Straight up now tell me do you really want to eat at UMAMI, oh oh ohhh or is this just an eat and run? BOOM! MOUTH ORGASM when I had the first bite. I'll keep it short. This place is legit. Small parking for valet only $5, but there's street parking between the restaurant and the car wash if you're coming from the 10 fwy. No reservations taken, so don't bother calling in. Usually a long line on the weekends, but pretty easy to get seated during the week. Here's the low down on the food: delicious, scrumptious, home made...and delicious...did I say delicious? Oh yeah...I freakin' did. My recommendations: 1. Truffle Burger (http://bomb.com) 2. Umami Burger (http://bomb.net...it's dot net cuz it's 2nd choice) 3. Cheesy Tater Tots (not on the menu...booyah you're welcome) 4. Sweet Potato Fries (they put crack on this) 5. Ketchup (Yeah ketchup...this shit's home made SON!) I usually just order to go and eat at home cuz i'll be moaning and groaning too much and the customers all just stare at me. Go figure. If you're a recovering crack addict then avoid this place at all costs cuz the food is friggin' addicting! Be wary food coma will ensue, therefore Umami gets a stage 5 rating in Food Comage (pronounced "koh-medge"). Good luck! Eat, Drink, and be Merry!

Umami Burger was the standout place of the weekend jaunt to Lala-land. We were headed to the Grove and were going to have brunch at the Farmers Market but the sign for Umami Burger caught my eye and I remember a few fellow Yelpers' glowing reviews of the gourmet burger chain. I'm docking a star for the lame $2.50 valet parking situation for this place, along with the fact that they don't serve alcohol. Liquor and brunch go hand in hand. But beyond that, it was the best dining experience of the weekend. The burgers are not cheap, at $10+ a pop but I do think they are worth it. We got the signature Umami Burger, which had high-quality meat patties with mushrooms and a Parmesan crisp to give it a nice crunch. We also ordered the special of the day which was a Truffle Poutine. It was basically a meat patty with truffle cheese on top of a bed of skinny french fries. The Smushed Puppies were inventively good and you'll love it if you like baked potatoes. Try all their unique sauces but watch out for the orange one. It has habanero peppers in it and will deliver a swift kick to your mouth if you're not careful.

Delicious burger.  I had the truffle and it melted in my mouth. It totally hit the spot.  My bf had the triple pork, and it def was pork tasting instead of beef, so be aware of that if your craving beef.  You could taste the chorizo or spicy sausage in it. It was good, but doesn't hit the spot as much as the truffle. I saw the Cali burger come out and that looked good too. Sides- where I have to take off a star. We were starving when we arrived. So I asked for anything that was quick. I started with a house salad. Their only dressing were the house kimchee dressing, which was a bit spicy and jalapeno ranch. I tried the house dressing and was not impressed. We also ordered the cheesy tater tots after reading so many reviews. I could have done without them. So, $50 later (after food + tip), we were satisfied. But next time, we'll just go for the burgers and spend like $30 (burgers are like $12).  O and the garlic aioli is nothing special. Ketchup comes out on spoons. Jal ranch was pretty good though. Decor/Ambiance-outside has heat lamps and can fit big groups. Inside has white paper on the tables you can draw on (they hang it up) and card machines to pay your bill at the table. Only 1 bathroom for the whole restaurant! Can be a wait ~ especially on the weekends. We went at 4 on a Saturday so only waited like 10 minutes.

I've been wanting to come here ever since I heard about it years ago on Good Day LA on FOX when Jill had mentioned that Umami's had the best burger in LA, but never had the chance until recently, and boy did it live up to my expectations. I don't know what they put in these little suckers but they're amazingly delish! The burgers are quite small, but it does its job and will fill you up; the problem is that it's so good you would want more and wish that it was actually bigger so therefore you don't have to fork up more money for an extra burger; which you really want but don't want to embarrass yourself and look like the fat ass that orders two burgers when everyone else is having one, yes you certainly don't want to be in that position - so one burger shall suffice. Aside from that dilemma, the salad here is to die for!!! We ordered the beet salad and I guess they dress it with crack sauce because it's so addicting. I can honestly say it's the best salad I've ever had in my entire life, the best simple salad that is - in the end it was worth the $8-$9 that I was complaining about when the husband ordered it.

I CAN NOW DIE HAPPY. I'VE FIFTHED TASTED THE FIFTH TASTE. I was in L.A. the past weekend with my best friends, and we planned on going to Father's Office for some good old big juicy old fashioned American hamburgers. As we arrived, I.D.s were required, and one of my friend's didn't have her I.D.s, so Plan B it is, Umami Burger, we come. And so fate has it, that I might die sometime soon, lose my taste buds, or somehow all cows will all die simultaneous soon and I must experience the Fifth Taste before any of those events occur. Once we got there, we put our names down, and it was a bit of a wait. But it's all good, I mean our lives are about to change through fifth tasting, what's 30 minutes? Nada. We got seated, and we all ordered the Umami Burger, yes all four of us, I mean it seemed like the right thing to do since none of us has been here before (Later I learned from SoCal friends that the Truffle Burger is the best... but it's all good, not like I'm never coming back, because I will). I ordered mine, medium rare, with sweet potato french fries. Once the burger arrived, it was about the size of a Haribo build--a-burger candy. Literally. Okay not literally. But it was small. I'm small but I eat like a fat girl. But again we all expected it to be pretty darn small. So whut-evah. We each took a bite, and looked at each other. I don't know what happened but whatever it was, I liked it. They gave us all these little cute spoons, filled with sauce. But I swear on my mother, you didn't need sauce. At. All. No sloshing ketchup, no ranch, no garlic whatever. And this is a first for me. I usually slosh all these condiments into my burger. Omgosh it was too good. And now I wish I never went to Umami burger. I wish I went to Father's Office. Because now, I won't enjoy any burger I'll eat, because I'll always compare it to this. So fuck you Umami, I hate you. But I love you and can't live without you. ...I can already tell it's about to be a volatile relationship. But I'm used to this, just go ask my ex-boyfriend.

Its good but I left thinking....damn I'm still hungry =/ The tater tots and dipping sauces were my favorite part of the meal. The burgers are good but when I have a burger, I want a BURGER! The burgers have lots of flavor but its a small burger or even a big slider.  Its not worth the wait or the money.

Best burger place!!!! I'm I'm love! I heard from my friend that this was the best burger place & I had to find out for myself. It really is as good as people say. I'm super excited they opened up in the OC! I had the Umami burger which has mushrooms & mmmmm so good!  Amongst the 3 of us, we all tried different burgers. My cousin had the garden burger which I think was absolutely mouth watering. We also got the side condiments & they were a nice add to the burgers. My favorite was a spicy jalapeño/chili ranch! I'm glad I finally got to try Umami. Well worth a drive to L.A.!

this place is utterly amazing. Simply a beautiful treat to my taste buds. The buns are soft, sweet, and small, not overwhelming, and depending on the meat or non meat in my case that you order, it stays inside the bread.   IT is not a tiny meal, no no no, just small portioned, and filling.   The patties are cooked to perfection, NOT too well done, not too raw, just right..almost like medium....My veggie seemed wonderful, it was soft, and I didn't have to take a long bite, it melted in my mouth, and the blends of their special white soy and truffle, omg. I savored every bite of my burger. Blended with riccotta cheese, and mushrooms and edemame patty was filling. The burgers are a bit bigger than sliders.   I know it's probably pricey, but seriously it's worth it, and you don't feel like you just ate a ball of grease.  IT is a bit overpriced, but this is more of a treat dinner place, also if you wanna impress a date.  Burgers simple here, but classy. Sweet Potato fries are amazing omg! :D they serve them with ketchup, ask for ranch or something.   You CAN DRAW ON THE paper table cloth! bring  your own crayons or something. I think this place is more for adults.  I wouldn't recommend this for families with small children.  Basically if you feed your kid McDonald's all the damn time, stay away, your kid will be sad there was no toy.   they have Mexican coke. :D Ice Cream sammiches, yummy desserts. Also, there is a trivia game thing on the tables, lame part you have to pay for it, and I don't really see people playing on it.   VALET PARKING I live near here so i can just walk. Anyway check it, it's really great, the service is great, also, it's not super spacious, and there are lots of hipsters there. but the food and service is so great, I honestly ignore the other customers. :D SO come on down to my area, and have a taste of this goodness :D CHECK IT!

So the burgers here are not terrible but they aren't the greatest like everyone says they are.  The only burger worth nothing is the Truffle Burger but that's really about it.  I've had better burgers at other locations  like Father's Office and Lazy Oz Canteen.  Try those burgers and you'll know what a good burger should taste like. The sodas are unique and the onion rings were good.   Other than that, I don't know why everyone says they have the best burgers.  Yeah, maybe the Truffle burger is up there with the best but we tried their Umami Burger and that was bleh ... nothing that exciting.

After hearing all the hype about this place I figured that I needed to try it out. It ended up being just ok.   I had the truffle burger with fries and a Mexican coke.  The burger was well-prepared and tasty but I've had better burgers for under $12.  The fries were a little too salty and I don't see what the big deal is about their Umami ketchup...it's just ketchup. I would go here again...if somebody else was paying.  You can honestly make your own better burger at home or create one at the Counter. And that bogus valet parking at this location?  Absurd!  Just park somewhere on La Brea or in the neighborhood behind it!

Came here for lunch on a workday since my coworker wanted to try them out and the La Brea location was the closest.  Got a primo parking spot on the street just steps away from the restaurant instead of having to valet.  I don't mind paying a few bucks if there's no other options but I don't really like anyone touching the inside of my car-icky.  Makes me a little bit OCD afterwards and I have to wipe everything down.   Can't tell how many tables/seats they have since we were seated right across from the cashier area.  Took the waiter quite a few minutes to take our order but he was friendly so no problem.  I got the original umami burger with sweet potato fries, coworker got the port & stiliton one, and I forgot which one the boss had.  The burger's pretty small but with my sweet potato fries and green iced tea, it was the perfect portion.  The meat tasted a little sweet but I think I was more fond of the shitake mushroom and the parmesan crisp part of it.  My coworker loved his burger and he ordered a side of smooshed potatoes that were pretty yummy.  Everything tasted pretty good but it's a pretty expensive lunch for just burgers and fries.   Oh, payment was really convenient with the tablet on the table.

Truffle Burger all the way! Just do it! It's a small burger, but the meat is so dense that it's enough! I've had plenty of guy friends order one and share another one (or just order and inhale two). I brought one home for my boyfriend, and even when it was cold, he was in heaven. Their own ketchup is to die for. I order the fries just so I can eat their ketchup. The service is also wonderful and the wait staff are down to earth. The manager (?) even brought out things to us. I like this specific location better than the one in Hollywood since it's a bit more personal (no alcohol though). Draw on your paper tablecloth, too, and they'll post it on the wall! :) Downside: parking. There is a little street parking, but pretty much it's just valet.

Our waiter was pretty cool/ helpful. Had the special = Pastrami burger + sweet potato fries the burger definitely lived up to my expectation, everything about it was like a symphony of flavors in my mouth the fries were top notch, gotta put it up there with the top sweet potato fries I've had. The house whipped ketchup improved the flavor too

Umami Burger: 3.5 stars bumped up to 4 stars. My boyfriend took me here as a fun dinner date and I was excited to finally get to eat an Umami Burger! And yea I know -- I'm 6+ months behind but hey! better late than never no? :) I didn't try valet parking it. Instead we managed to find street parking on the next intersection and didn't mind walking to the restaurant to save a few bucks. If you want to do the same, you will have to go way from the direct area surrounding Umami because it's all private property (aka no parking without a valid permit). As soon as we entered the joint at 7:30 pm, we were promptly seated at a table which was a surprise since other people complained about long lines... and it's a Friday night too! hmmm I ish very confused! Our waiter was nice and helped take our orders promptly as well. Food we ordered: Umami Burger- I'd say a good traditional tasting burger indeed. It has this smokey taste to it which was a surprise and the cheese was interesting-- kinda like a thick salty cheese cracker. Nevertheless, you needed to take all the ingredients in one bite to fully appreciate the burger. Truffle Burger- This was just as good. The burger was more flavorful because of  the truffle oil; however, the taste was a bit overpowering. Proof of overkill= too much oil! It was dripping down my hands nonstop! I think it's impossible to eat these burgers without the juices spilling all over your fingers. Smushed potatoes-- It's potato...  you can't get much better than that lol! Cheese tots- It was a much better side. My boyfriend said there was a hint of truffle oil in it as well which I couldn't taste (still overwhelmed by truffle burger aftertaste). On the positive side, I LOVED the soda I ordered (the mango soda) and their ketchup. The soda was perfect-- not too sweet with a hint of mango. What was interesting was that the bubbles would remain fizzing on your tongue and on the back of your throat which is pleasant :) As for the ketchup, this condiment was sweeter and has a thicker consistency, which beautifully complimented the sides. Con: The waiter forgot my boyfriend's cheese tot order even though she had been the one to suggest we get it. . .  We had to remind two waiters before we finally got it. I was kind of disappointed that neither of us were "SO FULL" like other Yelpers claimed. I swear-- I don't have a huge stomach or anything LOL... I try to eat smaller portions and within regular meal time periods and yet I felt like I didn't really eat anything? I must be weird... o_o;; Oh and I was disappointed by the roasted garlic aioli-- I didn't taste the garlic at all :( Overall, food is okay but I feel like I'm half paying for the name "Umami Burger". I'm not bothered by it-- I'm just understand what people mean that Umami is a lot of hype.

Okay...  First off, valet for a Burger joint? Are you serious... Worst burger ever... Can't even compare to in-and-out... I get the gourmet ingredient concept, but you need to maintain the basics of a burger--- NON soggy bread. Okay, so the meat was good and tasty but the soggy bread soiled the whole burger experience for us ...

So this is what the hype was all about.... Ok. So I wouldn't necessarily deem this place to have the best burgers in the world. Honestly, I'd be just as happy (or more) with an animal style double at in'n'out. But having an Umami Burger should be on everyone's LA "to eat" checklist. I went with a few of my friends and we each ordered a different side, so we ended up trying every single side on the menu. All their fries are amazing (except the thick cut/wedge fries tasted a little weird...like you could taste the oil they fry it in) but I definitely recommend their smashed potatoes. They taste AMAZEBALLS with their jalapeno ranch sauce. Got the Greenbird burger (turkey burger, avocado, sprouts, green cheese). Loved it but was not impressed by the size. [Insert that's what she said high five] If I'm gonna pay $11 for a burger and an extra $5 for a side of fries, i better be getting an $11 sized burger butttttt i didn't. At least it tasted great so I forgive you, Umami Burger. Yes. I paid almost $20 to have a U-stamped burger bun. You should, too....at least once.

Had to try this place because I heard so many great things. It's very small so make sure you go for early dinner. They have all their sodas in bottles, which is cool. Even had a few old school classics. Faygo anyone?   Okay, the food. Sweet potato fries were decent. Onion rings were way too doughy. The Umami ketchup wasn't anything special and the Garlic Aioli was just whatever. I don't like to put mayo on my fries. So that could be the issue. Oh, wait we came here for burgers. We ordered the Umami burger and the SoCal Burger. Of the two I preferred the SoCal. The Umami burger had a bit of a sweet taste to it.  Very hard to describe the taste. Would I go back here?  It's quite a drive from Orange County, so probably not. Would I recommend to a friend?  Sure, doesn't hurt to try something new.

I love hamburgers and fries but above all I LOVE TRUFFLE so when I saw their Truffle Hamburger I almost had a heart attack pre-cholesterol hype...sadly, when the burger came out I didn't love it...the taste wasn't what I imagined and the truffle flavor was minor...I almost felt cheated. Also, they don't allow any add ons...I mean really? But their fries and onion rings were very yummy so I was completely heart broken and that is why they get a 3 star from me!

Theoretically, the idea of Umami is a good one. In the English/European lexicon, there are certain flavors to food - salty, sweet, dry, rich, etc - but none for the sensation of fullness and wholesomeness. Its the satisfying taste of having a hot bowl of Asian soup on a cold day, or the juicy steak with potatoes. That is the flavor of Umami. On a chemical level, the 'umami' taste is actually the subtle taste of protein - one of the essential macronutrients (the others being water, carbohydrates and fats). Asian soups and steaks have one thing on common - they're packed with that taste. So, when Umami Burgers came out a few years ago, I was pretty excited. They would capitalize on the idea of making everything protein-flavored, like a nice hearty, freshly-killed steak. I wanted to see how the idea would pan out. My taste buds would agree. It was good. Their Umami Burger is not something to be trifled with. However, is it worth paying more than $10? Frankly, the addition of Umami to the burger's taste isn't the magic pill that makes me fall in love with franchise. Living in California, Burgers are as essential to our identity as freeways, cars, and scantily clad women strutting around Hollywood on a Friday night. Burgers also stand stiff competition: In & Out reins king, and every major city has a burger joint it can brag about. Here in Pasadena, I'm rather proud to tout Lucky Boys, Jake's Billiards & Burgers and Top's. Luckily, in the taste department, Umami reins supreme over them. By a hair, and by taste only. By value, on the other hand, it is not worth visiting. In total, with parking, a can of Coke and sweet potato fries - it cost me $25. Too much cost. Too little taste. Nice decor, but no thanks. If you're from out of town, I'd recommend it. If you've never had it, try it once, perhaps prove me wrong. They're worth the shot. But for a burger man like myself (trust me, I'm fat), its not worth everyday human consumption. I'd rather pay for a six dollar burger at Carl's Jr. At least over there, they're only mildly pretentious about the price vs value.

One of the Best Burgers in LA! umami burger - Meat melts in your mouth. It's very soft and juicy. Grilled tomato, and crispy layer of egg and mushroom and sauce perfectly work together. Their onion rings are huge. Try a couple of those and you'll be halfway full. Sweet potato fries with tartar sauce are top notch too. This is one of my top 5 burgers in LA.

I had the special Tune Seared Burger that was topped with fresh Ginger slices and Avocado. it was so delicious and tender. My friend had the shrimp burger, which I never tried, but it looked amazing and he loved it. We shared the onion rings that were fabulous. Umami burger was crazy packed, but the staff was friendly and easy going. The only thing I didn't like was feeling so heavy all day after I ate there. And I didn't even eat all of the bread because it was just way to much. I would love to eat here again and try the vegetarian burgers they offer.

Great ending to a trip out west.  The wait was quite long but that's always a good sign, right?  Once seated the service was super quick and pretty awesome.  We ordered the umami burger, sweet potato fries, onion rings and some other burger.  We were brought one wrong burger which was quickly remedied.  Personally I liked the size of the burgers.  They were not too big and not too small.  It was good, but I don't really remember it standing out that much.  I loved the sides and the sauces available though.  The onion rings were crispy and not too oily.  The sweet potato fries had cinnamon that worked well when dipped into hot sauce.   Overall, when I'm back in Cali I'd definitely try to stop back up and get some more onion rings!

There is so much hype about this place that I just had to try it out.  This is the only location I've been to and it was tiny.  They had about 5-6 tables inside and then the majority of their seating was on a heated outside patio.  We sat outside and it wasn't that bad, just the occasional firetruck/ambulance interrupting the ambience...The heat lamps surprisingly did their job and wasn't the least bit cold in a short sleeved shirt! I got the umami burger, because I always feel the need to get the entree named after the restaurant!  This consisted of a medium rare patty, with sauteed onions, tomato, and some kind of crispy layer.  It was pretty good...I wouldn't say it's the BEST burger I've ever had but close to it.  I still felt the patty was a little dry and kind of crumbled even though it was cooked medium rare. We also got the tempura onion rings and the sweet potato fries.  I find it kind of weird that they pair the sweet potato fries that are seasoned with brown sugar with ketchup, but they still tasted decent.  I liked the tempura onion rings more, they were huge and better than your normal onion ring, because I think the breading was a good texture to go with the onions! Overall I might come here again, but it was kind of pricey for the amount of food you get and it wasn't the best burger I have ever had.

My sister-in-law brought me here after a day of wedding prep shopping. We were starving and she said that this place is generally packed to the max. I've been meaning to come here for at least a year now to see what all the fuss was about. We had a couple of delicious apps for now, which I have forgotten about. Not because they were forgettable, but because I had a lot of things on my mind at the time. All I remember is that they were delicious. Wait...it was a secret app...Cheesy tator tots and the onion rings, yum! Yes. They kind of put us overboard on the belt buckles. Anyway...on to the burgers. I tried the Umami burger since it was my first time coming here. Not to mention that I love mushrooms and they put shitake on this baby. It was such a different type of delicious burger with that traditional bbq taste. I can't really explain it. Umami is on the list of my burger joints along with the Santa Monica Counter. I really like that place. I also really want to try "Not your Father's

Umami Burger may not be the BEST burger in Los Angeles according to some, but its definitely "top shelf" according to most. People may argue that there are better burgers out there, but "DAMN Umami... you tasty!" Out of all the burgers on their menu, the undisputed favorite and stand-out is definitely the truffle burger. Perfectly seasoned, simple yet complex, with great Umami flavor throughout. Meat, cheese, bread, flavor... that is it. This burger is awesome and it definitely does not need the entire salad bar between the buns to make it great. The sides are great as well... my favorite are the smashed potato's and sweet potato fries... each cooked perfectly and delicious in their own right. I also highly recommend the beet and goat cheese salad for those of you that are not looking for something as heavy. All in all, a great burger restaurant and this particular location provides valet parking but I would recommend trying to park on LaBrea as parking is typically plentiful. The prices may be a bit pricey and YES... the do charge you for extra sauce on the side but... like i said earlier: "DAMN Umami... you tasty!" Grab a burger, some fries and a Mexican Coke, smile and be happy.

My friend, her roommate and I came here to eat dinner on my last night in LA. This place was amaaaazing (food wise), service wise -- not so much; hence why I give it a 3 stars. I guess it was packed inside because as soon as we were about to open the door, the hostess came out and asked if we would like to be seated outside and said it was heated. After debating, we agreed and followed her out around the back and she told us that we could sit anywhere. The outdoor seating area was pretty cramped and it was pretty chilly outside; the heater barely helped even though we were close to it and it was turned up. It took a bit of time for the server to come and greet us at our table. He wasn't too personable and barely visited our table. My friend and her roommate ordered a Umami burger to share, I ordered one for myself, and we also got sweet potato fries, tempura onion rings, and thin fries to share amongst the three. The food was delicious. If I were to rate this place on the food alone, I would definitely give it 5 stars. The burgers were juicy, with both of the meats cooked to perfection, just right! The fries were addicting and the sauces -- yum! Especially the Diablo sauce! We also tried the Jalapeño Ranch and Garlic Aioli sauces. We demolished  our meal -- as my friend said, "That was rudely delicious." Probably the best burger I had in a while. 11$ though for a pretty small burger; on the expensive side, but the taste -- definitely worth it.

The lack of stars is for service and the fact that my partner and I had really bad stomach aches after we left.  I've been to the Umami in Hollywood and loved the experience, the price is pretty steep but the burger was fantastic.  This time around I went with 2 friends and my partner, we ordered nearly every side.  The food tasted good.  The burgers were all ordered medium (except mine, medium rare) and when everyone took a bite we noticed they were all at different temperatures.  We enjoyed them none the less.   Our server was great.  He was attentive but not intrusive. Fast, knowledgeable.  The Manager, however, had a stinky attitude that stunk up the entire restaurant.  He would grunt at guests that came in, not saying hello or welcome.  He would say "how many?" and they point to a table.  He was scowling at my table the entire time and never came by to check on us.  I'm not expecting to be treated like royalty but this guy obviously had a chip on his shoulder and was rude to everyone that walked in.  I can tell that people were put off by it.  I wish that people like this would leave the industry if they are so unhappy or burnt out, it's not called the hospitality industry for nothing!

I didn't like anything about this restaurant. Overhyped. Over it. It's like my ex-gf. It's bourgey (spell check) as hell. They served me raw ground beef and said that that's how it's made. The server was bourgey. The place was bourgey. But there are a few attractive people around so it was ok to creep. This was like going to see a Johnny Depp movie and afterwards realized you just watched a really lame Alice in Wonderland remake that only hipsters like. Not better than Passion of the Christ, Definitely not better than Lethal Weapon 4.

Here are my tips for a successful 5-star dining experience: - Don't buy too deeply into the hype; - Go at off times, to avoid the wait; - Skip the signature Umami Burger, and go straight for the Truffle Burger; - Get the Sweet Potato Fries with garlic aioli. The Truffle Burger was really delicious... would totally order it again. Unfortunately for me, I bought into the hype my first time out and started with the Umami Burger... and while also delicious, it was underwhelming.  Apparently the depth of flavor wasn't as deep as I was hoping for. Service-wise, I had no complaints. I would definitely go back, and just stick to the Truffle Burger from here on out.

Truly one of  the best burger I've every had, second to Peter lugars steak burger in Queens (hint its not on the actual menu). To be completely honest, those of you who gave this place 1 or 2 stars are hating just to hate! The frustrating thing about yelp is reliability. Who's reviews are good and who's are well...shitty? It seems like many of your negative reviews are based on trivial things. "oh he stared at me funny! boo hoo" come on people grow up. No offense, but I have a pet peeve when it comes to yelp reviews that are completely biased and well...shitty. I've been steered wrong by so many of you that I don't even know why I'm on this site... boredom?   At the end of the day I've been here over 100 times and I've had maybe 1 not so great meal and 99 mind blowing burgers. I acknowledge the fact that shitty service happens and bad meals happen so I'm not completely writing off some of your comments but hating on the burger? Bullshit.  If your reading this review I strongly encourage you to try this place. and... IF FOR SOME REASON YOU DO NOT ENJOY THE BURGER, MESSAGE ME AND LET ME KNOW! Call me an idiot and tell me how wrong I am but for some reason I don't expect to have a full inbox...Best of luck PS. In general, when you read a particularly good or bad review on a restaurant, I suggest clicking on that persons profile and see some of their other reviews. It will give you some insight on whether to trust the review or not

The BEST Burgers in the World! Family from Fremont were visiting and they heard of Umami--a must visit. Came with Larry, Christian, Nicholas, and Lea for a special lunch after visiting the Peterson Automotive Museum. Street parking was ample, and we all, except Lea, ordered burgers: Truffle and Umami. We also got Truffle Fries, Thin Cut Fries, and Sweet Potato Fries. The boys loved the burger, and Lea loved her fries. Everyone was filled and happy. Next Stop: Page Museum.

I dont understand the big fuss. I dont understand the big lines. I dont understand why trendy people dress the way they do. And most importantly, I dont understand why people love this place so much. Their burgers are average at best. If I had the choice between Umami and In N Out, I would probably choose In N Out. They charge $10 a burger and it doesnt come with any sides, let alone drinks. You cant order your burger well done, only medium and I hate it. Its a terrible place to come to with more then 2 people bec your wait time would be ridiculous. The only thing thats good about this place is the decor. They really did a good job on making the interior look awesome. Other than the decor, Umami might be my 8th option for lunch if Im craving a burger.

I got the Umami burger that comes with a portobello mushroom, parmesan crisp, carmelized onions, roasted bell peppers, and sundried tomatoes on toasted brioche. For sides, I got sweet potato fries dusted with brown sugar and served with  housemade ketchup. I also had tempura onion rings. I washed everything down with an iced green tea that was slightly sweetened and served in the cutest plastic cup complete with a thumb holster.  The food was awesome! I can see why USA Today picked this place as California's must eat burger joint.

Although Umami is a solid 4, I'm not sure I'll run back because there are so many other burger joints to relish when you live in L.A. The reason I would go back would not be for the burgers, but for the sides. The onion rings were definitely some of the best I ever had - apparently they just changed the batter so for those of you who were disappointed before, try them again. The smushed potatoes (baked potato + french fry concoction) are quite delicious too. The sweet potato fries are just ok compared to these two. I wish I had tried the tots. As for the burger, pretty good, but definitely overhyped. One thing is I concur with a lot of the other reviews mentioning the temperature cooked vs. requested can be quite inconsistent, leaning on the rarer side. I like medium well, so I asked for well done just to be sure (I rather have my meat dry than bloody). SO wanted medium, but I pushed him to get medium well since I figured they might cook it closer to medium rare. When we cut our burgers in half, SO found his was a medium well like he requested. But mine was more undercooked than his! Mine was definitely medium even though I asked for well done, which basically means burn the shit out of it for all I care. So just be aware that they don't know the grill that well. It sounds like they know how to make medium rare and everything else is up for grabs. Service was really good - from hostess, server, busboy. A bit pricey for the burger ($11), but that's to be expected. It would be nice if they threw in some fries with your burger - I mean a potato and oil costs almost nothing. Parking on the street was easy, but that's because we got there right when parking restrictions on La Brea let up.

Am I missing something? I don't get the massive amounts of praise for this burger.  It wasn't bad, it wasn't good. It was super average.  I've had FAR better burgers in my lifetime.   And seriously, I know it's just soda. But the weird diet cola they serve is not good at all. Like it's straight up gross.   My bf was also disappointed that they do not serve beer.   I will say, the server was nice and the hostess was very sweet as well.

This place is soooo good.  The burgers are the perfect size and literally melt in your mouth. Plus what can be better than crispy sweet potato fries?  The beet salad is divine as well. The food is of great quality...when I eat Umami, it is all I have to eat in a day and I stay full and satisfied.  I also usually feel like I have put something good into my body too..which is a surprise from a burger. The only downside to coming here is that you will dream about it and want to come back as soon as you wake up.  :) It is non-stop salivation from the first bite on out. Be careful coming in a large group though, as this place is usually packed and doesn't have large seating areas.

Occasion: Dinner with Lynn and Aaron What I Had: The Umami Burger Food Review: THE Umami Burger includes a shiitake mushroom, caramelized onions, roasted tomato, parmesan crisp, and umami ketchup along with a sizable hunk of meat. There was nothing special about the caramelized onions, but where this burger does get points from me is the parmesan crisp. I have a soft spot for pretty much any food that adds a little contrast, and the crispy cheese did it for this burger. Service Review: Nothing in particular about the service.   Venue Review: Parking can be rather difficult at this Umami. This is one place where valet parking is a necessity unless you are walking, which is unfortunate. The restaurant itself is also extremely small, and it feels crowded with the tables squeezed together. Overall Impression: The burger was great, but for $10-12 I'd expect it to be at least the size of an average burger. I'd definitely eat here again because you can't get this burger anywhere else, but I have to rank the Office Burger at Father's Office higher overall.

Maybe I'm a little annoyed at all the hipsters high-fiving themselves about how great this place is, but it just is not going to get more than 3 stars from me.  Maybe 3.5, but Yelp doesn't allow that, so suck it, hipsters. The burgers here are definitely DELICIOUS and worth the trip.  I got the truffle burger and my girlfriend got the three-kinds-of-pork burger (whatever that's called).  Both were exceptional.  They also have (at least at the La Brea location) a nifty little tablet-like device where you can browse the menu, pay for your meal, and even play some fun little games with your lunch/dinner partner. Here are my issues: -Price: It is really good meat, I get it, but it really seems crazy to pay $12 for a burger that's no bigger than In-n-Out burger.  It ended up being the right size, i was totally satisfied, but it seemed like $12 was kind of steep when the burger comes with nothing on the side. -Fries: The fries were nothing to write home about, and while I can't remember how much they were, they were definitely overpriced.  My girlfriend loved the sweet potato fries, but I'm still trying to get over the great Sweet Potato Fry incident of 2009, where I got sick after eating sweet potato fries... so i didn't have any. -Ketchup: I once saw a t-shirt that says "I put ketchup on my ketchup."  Now, I'm not THAT bad, but i do like a side of ketchup for any kind of burger and definitely any kind of fry.  Umami makes their own ketchup, and while it's not terrible, it's not very good either.  And that's your only choice is the Umami ketchup.  Can we at least have a backup bottle of Heinz?   -Drinks: I paid $3.00 for an 8 oz bottle of Diet Coke.  $3.00.  8 oz.  Again, i can do with a small bottle of Diet Coke to accompany my meal, but don't charge me $3.00 for it.  How about $1.00 (which is STILL too much)? -Sneaky Games: The games I mentioned before?  They're not free.  In fact, you THINK they are free, but once you play for five minutes, they want you to pay to play longer (or some such nonsense).  Also, there is an added $.01 on your bill for playing the games.  Again, it's not the fact that they charge you a penny, but WHY do they do it?  They are already overcharging you for everything else!  It's just insult to injury. Will I go back?  Yes.  At least now I know what I'm getting myself into.  But I definitely wouldn't be a regular there.  It's just too pricey for this cheapskate.

Pretty damn hard to sell me the "ultimate burger" when some of my favorite burgers were off the grill at friends' pool parties or at a tailgate. I like a simple burger. Buns, meat patty, cheese, light ketchup. A good friend loves burgers and told me this was a solid place to grab one. We arrived at their valet parking lot around 7 on a Saturday night (Although I will never understand why I will need to pay someone $3 to park my car 20 feet away for me). We were sat immediately. We ordered the Umami Burger, the Truffle Burger, and some Sweet Potato Fries. Both burgers were smaller than expected and the buns were a little greasy. But both burgers were pretty damn tasty. My gf and I inhaled both quickly. Sweet potato fries were...different. They were sweeter than salty. Flavored like churros. Some people might love that, I thought it was ok. Decent experience. Wouldn't be opposed to heading back, but I don't think I would go out of my way for an umami burger.

This is the type of restaurant that is hard to find and you may have to make a circle around the block just finding it. What does not help is the valet parking for a lot that is the size of a tennis court. Look for a spot on the street to save money.... Even for a 3pm late lunch Umami was quite crowded. We ended up waiting for about 10 minutes for an open table. What I did not realize from standing outside is how small it is inside but fortunately all the tables were not all that cramped together.  As my girlfriend and I were being seated near the kitchen we saw all the really cool drawings on the wall people made on their place mats. I mean some of these look very professionally done. They mostly included the famous Umami burger logo in some way. Since I had Umami Burger last week for the first time in Hermosa Beach I decided to try a different burger then the namesake burger. I opted to go for the Triple Pork burger. The girlfriend decided to split an order of sweet potato fries as well. Things went a little downhill from here. When we got our sweet potato fries first, it only came with  literally a spoon size amount of ketchup on a spoon!!!. Where are the bottles? I was left wanting more ketchup. At least the fries were done really well with a good amount of cinnamon. Also we ordered a coke, not a bottled one that came out. We were assuming when we asked for a coke we could get refills from a cup with ice. So much for that.... Then my Triple Pork burger came out. It was a bit greasy then what I remembered from last time and just didn't taste that well. Maybe I was hyping this place so much expecting EVERY burger to be literally an explosion of flavors in my mouth. I still need to try all the burgers here to judge everything to the full extent. Service was really nice. Just a note for everyone complaining about getting sick from eating the burgers here because of how they cook it. Seriously do you people realize you can have them cook your burger to how you want it?  It is not that hard to ask them.....

The only thing this place had it going was the scrumptious burgers they were serving. Other than that, it was all downhill from there. This place is SMALL, the inside hosts a few tables but then you are basically eating elbow to elbow with your neighboring tables. They do have a back patio, but it doesn't connect to the restaurant so if you wanted to use the bathroom, you would have to walk around the outside of the restaurant to get into the restaurant itself. It felt very unconnected as a whole. Service was awful. First, they were out of ice. Really? Ok .. that is acceptable I guess. But then, they were out of knives. Said they didn't have any clean ones at the moment. Hmmmm ... then they finally came after we already finished half the burger in which we had no use for them any longer. Lastly, we asked for water and it finally came at the end of the meal .. really? I wanted the water to wash my food but of course, I'll have to use my saliva this time. Onto the food. I ordered the three chili burger (around $11), sweet potato fries, and smooshed potatoes. The burger was again, delicious as I had remembered it from a previous visit to a different Umami Burger location. Very juicy and tender with an excellent bun to compliment. i could definitely taste the green chili in it in each bite. The sweet potato fries were delicious as well (although the waitress told us that the only fresh side dish were the smoosh potatoes, everything else was frozen and not fresh, bummmmer!). I could have gone without the sugar they dashed on the fries because they were already sweet to begin with. The smooshed potatoes were ok, nothing spectacular like the waitress had advertised. They were basically baby potatoes that were halved and then smooshed. Baked and then dressed with an aoili sauce. So, total bill for 3 burgers + 3 sodas + sweet potato fries + smooshed potatoes = about $23/pp incl tip/tax.

I was always curious about Umami Burger because I liked the name.  I was even more curious when Ryan Seacrest announced it as LA's best burger.   I was surprised we only had to wait for about 10 minutes before we got seated.  The table had paper tablecloth and plastic cups with indentation for your thumb.  My niece said it looked fancy.  Free wifi for the customers. Truffle Burger: House made truffle cheese with truffle glaze for $12.  The meat was as good as juicy burger.  I liked this burger a lot but it could use a little more truffle oil. I liked how part of the meat was cruncy and the bun was sweet. Manly Burger: Beer-cheddar cheese, smoked-salt onion strings, bacon lardons for $11. My yelp assistant liked it.  I liked how the bacon was so fat. Sweet potato Fries:  Not bad...dip it with different dipping sauces. Tempura Onion Rings: 4 slices of greasy and not so good onion rings.  I was disappointed. The burgers were tiny..I was still hungry when I walked out. $2 Valet parking but there are a lot of metered parking. 3.5 stars!!   Umami's Truffle Burger is yummylicious!!!

Simply good burgers but, they can be a little greasy. Definitely different than The Counter but, I actually think these taste better. The location is tiny but, it sounds like that's true for a few of their spots. I do think they have the best sweet potato fries though...the brown sugar they sprinkle on there is what makes them so perfect! Yum!

Came here for dinner, having very high expectations from all the things I've been told by friends. Though we were very doubtful at first of it being worth $10 for a burger, we were all very pleased when the food arrived. We had umami burgers, portabella mushroom burger, tempera onion rings, thin cut fries, and sweet potato fries. Everything tasted fresh and amazing. The burgers were cooked about medium, keeping them extremely juicy and tasteful. The fries were all seasoned differently, and each one was a great new experience. The burgers may seem small, but they won't leave you hungry. I've had a few run ins with $10 burgers before in California and Vegas, but this one is truly worth $10. Great ingredients, concepts, and presentation made this meal a phenomenal experience. This place has a very neat look to it as well. The inside feels very welcoming, and you almost feel like a place you'd go to for drinks and small dishes. The water cups they give you were interesting as well, being flexible and clear, kinda wanted to take one home (but didn't). Some things to know, parking can be a bit hard if you don't use valet (which is $2.5), so be aware of that. Anyways, I would definitely come here again, recommended to anyone!

I've stayed clear from Umami Burger because of the hype and from my first impression that it was overrated. My first cherry popping experience was at the Umami Burger Hollywood location which is way closer to me than this La Brea one. The only reason why I found myself back at Umami was because one of the fellas had his birthday dinner here so I had to represent. Although it was a Saturday night and we had a party of eight, the wait wasn't too bad (no reservations) granted that there were quite a few groups waiting out front. One thing I took notice was the friendliness of the workers. They were all smiles and answered any questions with no hesitation. The service was also quick and our plastic cup of waters never ran dry. Note: they do not serve any alcoholic beverages at this location. I ordered the Truffle Burger ($12): house made truffle cheese with truffle glaze which I thought was a pretty tasty burger. A little ketchup and dijon mustard goes a long way. Although not the best burger I've had, it was still pretty satisfying. I gave half of this burger away so I can sample half of the Triple Pork Burger ($11): fresh ground pork, chorizo and applewood smoked bacon with manchego cheese & pimento aioli. This was also a good call. The triple pork was meshed together in the patty rather than thrown in individually. I personally would have liked my bacon in its normal form but you can't always have your cake and eat it too. Verdict: not too bad for you pork lovers. Note that the burgers do not look like much but looks can definitely deceive. We ordered a few sides to share and surprisingly the Malt Liquor Tempura Onion Rings ($3) were my favorite. Very crispy and somewhat flaky battered Tempura style but the sweetness of the onion was quite prominent. The Thin Fries ($3.5) sounds boring as hell but was actually really well made. Thin indeed, perfectly fried, and had a nice touch of salt to it. May not have conquered Mc'Donald's fries but definitely up there. The Sweet Potato Fries ($4) was decent. All in all, dinner was quite pleasant and everything went smoothly. The ambiance at this location as compared to the Hollywood location was much more relaxed and simple. We sat on the outside patio and the weather could not have been any more Southern Cali perfect. From what I recall at the Hollywood site, it was very trendy and hip there whereas I didn't have that feeling at this one. For all that and great service, I wouldn't mind driving a little West to eat at this La Brea Umami Burger. It shall no longer be considered an overrated burger joint in my books.

GREAT BURGERS. I recommend the truffle burger. The only downside is the place is way too small and there's often a longish wait (20-45 mins) to get a little table. Can't blame the place for being popular, just for being too small.

The burgers are amazing, but not that big for the price you pay. I would come here more often if the price was a little bit lower and came with a side. By the time you have a burger and fries, you are paying about 16 bucks for your meal. It's def worth trying, esp if you want to splurge and have a gourmet burger.

Their burgers are so rich and flavorful that I think the size is the perfect amount. Some people may complain that the burgers are too small but perhaps that is why this country continues up the scale in obesity rates. But political/health debates aside, this place clogs my arteries in just the right ways. Try the Port and Stilton if you love blue cheese and you must try the Truffle burger at least once. The Umami burger is ok. They also have cheese filled tater tots that are pretty good but I do wish they were cheesier. Being the silly people that we are, we drove to MILK which is a couple of blocks down from UMAMI to order their ice cream macaron sandwiches. We completely overlooked the fact that UMAMI actually serves these exact same dessert items FROM MILK at the restaurant....oops....so make sure to try these delicious ice cream macaron sandwiches from MILK not at MILK but at UMAMI after you eat a port & stilton or the truffle burger, not the UMAMI burger...got it?

Don't think of this as a typical burger place like I did. My friend told me this, "Alan you'll love this place. You'll bite into the burger and eat it all and then you'll be like 'What??! Where did my burger go!'" True enough, I took my first bite into the umami burger and I instantly fell in love with it. I wanted more, but it was gone before I could say "This is AMAZING!" What's the best way to describe this place? It's small, compacted, but AMAZING! Valet parking is $2.50 in a small lot. I came in when there wasn't alot of people and so my friends and I were situated within 3 minutes. The dining environment is one of a kind. If you've ever been to Boiling Crab you'll notice that instead of table covers they use paper covers with their logo stamped on each paper. I found it interesting along with the table plant and a small tv looking thing for the customers to check out. Best part I think is knowing that if you are artistic and you draw something they'll mount it on their dining wall. My friends and I all ordered Umami burgers and we shared different sides. The sides we chose were: Onion Rings, Sweet Potato Fries, and Potato Tots. They were all amazing and fresh. Don't forget to ask for extra sauce as they'll gladly give you more sauce to feast on those side orders. Overall the place is small and fairly expensive, but hey you get what you pay for. Great service, gourmet burgers that aren't like In-N-Out or Islands, and the dining atmosphere is nice and cozy. So the next time you want a burger be sure to check this place out! I'll be coming back here when I come back to LA to visit LACMA in the near future.

Hands down, best burger in LA!   Had the great pleasure of trying the Umami truffle burger last night.  The burger itself was thick, juicy, and rare.  I was completely blown away!  After trying all the major burger joints in LA, I have to say Umami is my favorite, by far!! The cheesy tater tots were also crunchy, crispy and delicious.   The onion rings ok.  The service was great!  Would definitely go again, again and again...

I first thought it was a Japanese burger joint when I heard the name: "Umami". Expecting to see some kind of teriyaki burgers and fresh Japanese style salads on the side, but I was totally wrong... Very meaty, greasy and "Umami" it was: umami [oo-mah-mee]   noun a strong meaty taste imparted by glutamate and certain other amino acids: often considered to be one of the basic taste sensations along with sweet, sour, bitter, and salty. There you go! For those of you who didn't know what "umami" meant. :) Since it was my first visit, I wanted to try their signature "Umami Burger" ($11... I know. For this kind of price you can order 3 double-double hamburgers at In-N-Out, but for adventure sake, it's not too bad), but I see a lot of fellow yelpers recommending Triple Pork or Truffle, maybe next time. Umami burger was so tender, juicy and flavorful and I especially like the buns. Very tasty and soft! Mexican coke was my choice of drink and it went so well with the burger. After having full of meaty taste in my mouth, in order to balance the ph level in my mouth, I had to have some sort of sweets, so I ordered Ice Cream Sandwich. I was in heaven. Total satisfaction. No regrets, nothing was holding me back, I was ready to move on to the next step in my life.

I finally tried this place and don't understand what all the rave is about. It was good but I have definitely had better! I had the Umami. Truffle chip and shitake mushroom was a unique touch and flavor. Meat was flavorless. I understand that the other ingredients are there to provide the excitement for taste buds but getting a bite  of bland hamburger was less than enjoyable. The onion rings were absolutely wonderful! Light and fluffy, easily the best part of the meal. Strawberry lemonade was refreshing but pretty standard. It tastes like the one at Mendocino Farms. 2 burgers, 2 onion rings and 2 drinks = $40+...not worth it!

Umami: a taste sensation that is meaty or savory and is produced by several amino acids and nucleotides (as aspartate, inosinate, and glutamate) and THAT is exactly what you will get here. I've heard about this place for a couple years now and I finally got around to trying it before going to the Roxy for a concert. First impression was the parking (I hate paying for parking but we were lucky to find a spot on the street). Second DAMN this place is small and the burgers are slightly bigger than sliders. Third impression: HOLY WOW THIS THING IS GOOD! Went with 3 other people and we all got a burger and shared it. We got the Umami, Truffle, Manly, and Steak In order of favorites: 1. Truffle (most popular) 2. Manly (mmm bacon) 3. Steak (fried anchovies, garlic, cheese) 4. Umami  (not a fan of sweet burgers) Our sides: Cheese tator tots (AMAZING!) Tempura onion rings (really does taste like tempura, kind of pricey) Steak fries THE JALAPENO RANCH IS ALSO A MUST TRY! Basically about $20 a person but worth trying.

I have officially ate the best burger I have ever eaten.  The truffle burger is hands down the Best Burger I have eaten in my life so far. It melts in your mouth!! It has a hint of wine dressing to go with the melted cheese that indulges the perfect patty.  My favorite type of fries is shoestring ones, and they won my heart with theirs! Only sad part of this Umami burger that did have me bummed is that they do not have any alcohol.  I would have really loved a good beer with my burger! Other then that everything was heavenly, not to mention their homemade ketchup too!

I had  a wonderful experience at Umami Burger. The food was delicious. We went on a Saturday afternoon so the place wasn't over crowded. I can imagine how it may get in the evenings. The place is pretty small but was able to comfortably accommodate our party of 6. I may try another location because of the space but the service was good and I will visiting again.

Sooner or later I was bound to try this place because I can't resist a good burger and I want to say "yeah, I've tried umami." This place is easy to miss..the parking was a lil hard to find cuz i didn't valet..but next time i prob will cuz it's only $2.50 which isn't that bad. Umami is so hi-tech!! We were seated and there was electronic device where we could look at the menu, pics, and place our order and even pay on that device too! crazy cool! and while we waited for our food they gave us 2 free games to play haha I got the Port and Stilton burger which has blue cheese and port-caramelized onions. The burger was very juicy but greasy...I don't know how they cook the meat but it def oozes oil. AND it didn't come with any type of greens so I felt even more oily...I also ordered a side of onion rings which were too heavy for my taste. Nice thick cut onion rings but I felt gross I would have to say the burger at Father's office is still my fav.

Guess the crazy hype that went around kind of had me expecting a lot more than I received. Pretty crowded considering we were having a (very) early dinner (4 PM to be exact... I guess you can say it was our late lunch) and we were seated at a totally random table in this separate room surrounded by counters. Felt kind of awkward so we asked to move. Anyway, the boyfriend and I ordered the Umami burger (beef) and the Greenbird burger (turkey with avocado and "green cheese" = ricotta and some thing green. it's not that bad). Also got an order of their smushed potatos... it's basically baby golden potatos that were squashed or something. Came with Aioli sauce, which was good, but next time I think I'd stick with traditional fries or get the sweet potato fries, the "smushes" were too filling for me, even if the burger itself was smaller than other places. Sorry Jason Bentley, but I don't think I share the same enthusiasm for the place as you do! BUT I am willing to go back again and give it another shot :)

Totally overrated IMHO.  Good, but not great and really not worth the wait.  No booze at this location. :-/ I dislike that you cannot alter their burgers either.  I'd get that if they were fast with the service and serving, but they really aren't. Flavors were pretty good, but I like The Counter so much better.  Way more bang for the buck and I sure as hell can have it my way there!!

Tried Truffle Burger and Umami burger.. they are both VERY tasty.. Janey liked "Truffle" burger much more.. and she's not a burger eater.. very rarely she will touch one.. but she really enjoyed it. I too liked both burgers... They come just buns, and meat.. and some stuff.. mushrooms and such.  but no usual suspects such as lettuce, tomatoes, onions and pickles..  you have to pay extra.. Now.. let's talk about the price.  Each burger costs over $11 bucks!! And EVERYTHING is extra.  I mean EVERYTHING.  fries, condiments, drinks.. I would have give 4+ stars for the taste but overall, burgers are way too expensive..

Had my first experience here before all the hype and people started coming in droves. Maybe a year or two ago. I tried to forget the experience. First off the burgers are pretty good. But the service is the worst I ever experienced in any restaurant period. We waited almost 20 minutes before they took our order and the place only had 8 other customers. On top of that it took another 20 minutes before we got half our food and by the time the other half was at the table the recipients of the first half finished their burgers and fries. Ordering ketchup took 10 minutes. The burgers are small and over priced. I'm not asking for fast food but food at a reasonable time. On top of that they were not consistent with their lack of service as the table next to us sat down 5 minutes after us and got their food, ate and paid by The time we got the first half of the food ordered There were 4 people in our party. I gave them too much of my time. A high end burger is no excuse for the lack of service they offer. I have frequented fathers office and a few other high end burger places and get treated better easily and by a long ways.

This review is specifically regarding Umami's "Earth Burger," their vegetarian option, eaten during a visit yesterday. I've been to Umami in the past, liked their offering, and had both good & bad experiences over the years. But their Earth Burger is just a nasty slimy piece of garbage. I don't know what's in the patty, but the consistency and color were like a molded lump of mushroom pate. Even just cutting in half through the soft bun, the patty squished and spooged out the sides of the bun. When biting into the burger, the situation got even worse as the patty is too soft and squishy and just gets squeezed all over. It doesn't really taste like anything. There's no sear that would bring out more dimensional taste and texture. Just some sorry ass tiny veggies that don't compliment or help the sorry excuse for a $12 burger. Did I mention that all of that bad costs $12? Service was subpar and took forever. Two other people in my group that had the Earth Burger had the same impression. Fleischman, the owner, is a dick who thinks his shit doesn't stink. We battled years ago over what was a sorry excuse for french fries in their early days. After telling me that they were perfect, they changed the fries and the price less than two weeks later. I'm sure he'll react the same to this. Prove him wrong. Tell Umami they need to step up their veg offering and make it at least appetizing if they're gonna charge $12.

The best burger I've ever had. I don't live in California, but I would move out here just to be close to this burger. I don't like the traffic in California, but I'd deal with it just for this burger. No one can drive in California, (coming from an NYC, Northern (fist pumpin') NJ guy) but I'd happily take a swerving, merging, Prius pushing driver because of this burger. I dislike the fact that everything is so far in California, but at least there are Umami burger joints spread out. This burger makes things better. that's what food should do, it should make a bad day better, it should make a place feel special, it should transcend my stomach and affect my life. Oh, Umami burger in NYC in 2012 ?? Goodlife!

4.5 stars This place has great burgers at good prices. I remember coming here thinking that it was in the middle of no where. I'm glad I trusted my friend and her judgment because when we finally got there, what seemed like a rather large herd of people were already there getting pumped for dinner. It was a long wait, but those willing leave with a satisfying experience. I had the SoCal Burger which comes with butter lettuce, an oven-roasted tomato, american cheese, caramelized onions, and their house spread. My friend got the Port & Stilton Burger, blue cheese with port-caramelized onions. They were beautiful burgers-the meat juicy and delectable- on crispy, soft, buttery buns! We shared sweet potato fries and thin fries with Umami ketchup and roasted garlic aioli. I don't quite remember why I didn't get the hand-cut fries which are really thick. I think I would've loved them. Totally my style. But anyway, we both LOVED our burgers. I think out of all the gourmet burger and fries combinations I've had (and I've had A LOT), this combo may be the best of them. I'm rating a 4.5 because although I appreciate their small menu, I would love to see a burger on there with a fried egg or avocado. Their turkey burger has avocado... but that ain't really my style. I look forward to trying more burgers here. I don't know why I didn't try or even ask about their signature burger. I can't even tell what comes on it when looking at pictures, except that parmesan crisp. Anyway, this restaurant is intriguing. And I can't wait to come back.

Yes, them burgers are as good as almost any I've had elsewhere. The most pleasant surprise, however, were the onion rings - these were by far the best I've had anywhere. After you try their onion rings and a order of their scrumptous decadent fries, you will agree with me that their claim to fame should be their sides instead of burgers. Their burgers were good, ok I would even say they were really good but a small burger is almost like buying a hot rod and finding out it only has a 4 banger engine. I've always said the burger is the working mans gourmet lunch, so treat it as such. Give me a big juicy two handed burger and charge me a price that a working stiff can afford. Places like Umami, where the price and size of the meat heads in opposite and wrong directions, in addition to charging customers for valet parking, I just can't appreciate. Next time? I've tried it once, ok, maybe I will have a hankering for some onion rings.

LOTS OF PEOPLE ABSOLUTELY LOVE UMAMI BURGER. I'm not so sure I'm one of those people. Sorry, but I just don't fall into the "holy shit this place is awesome" category of patron. I'd call it solid, a bit pricey, and certainly crowded depending on where/when you go. We stopped in randomly to the La Brea ave location at about 2:30pm on a Saturday, a good time with no lines. I got the Truffle burger, she got the veggie burger mush pie. The Truffle burger was... basically, a nice burger. Solid, but not worth the hype I'd heard. The lady had the veggie burger which was, basically, a mush pie made of edamame, mushrooms and other things I can't remember. I wouldn't recommend it. The sweet potato fries: worth it, absolutely and the highlight of the meal for me. Recommendation: if you like scenes, go to Umami. If you want an incredible LA burger, I'd check out (in no particular order): The Apple Pan, The Counter, Ford's Filling Station, and other joints.

The first time I saw the word "Umami" was on my box of Ajinomoto MSG which described itself as the essence of umami. As an Asian man I am well aware that MSG is delicious so I had high hopes when finally going to LA to try Umami Burger! First Impressions: Awful parking, long lines, relatively small location. These things usually point to a good dining experience. Dining Environment: I actually really liked the look of this place. Clean, nothing too fancy or distracting. The wall by the kitchen had a bunch of umami man and similar drawings. Each table had a little potted plant and a tablet.  The tablet had the menu on there complete with pictures and everything. Ordering through the tablet was not functional, but it would be a pretty neat concept. Appetizers: We got the cheesy tater tots, tempura onion rings and the steak fries. The tots were delicious but the fries were pretty underwhelming. They were cut really small and you really don't get that many for how much you're paying. The house ketchup was alright, but ask your waiter for the jalapeno ranch! It's really good. The tempura onion rings were good too, they actually tasted like tempura. Burgers: At our table we got four burgers and had a taste of each. We got the Manly Burger, Umami Burger, Truffle Burger, and the STINK Burger which was the special of the night. They were all cooked medium rare which is just the way I like it. The patties were juicy and flavorful. The burgers were a little on the small side and way pricey, but they're good. I think my favorite had to be the truffle burger although the stink burger was close. Overall I thought that Umami Burger was quite the experience! I wouldn't eat here that often because it's pretty overpriced, but trying it out was definitely worth it.

Umaaaami what's your name! Dined at Umami Burger on a Saturday night and all I can say is WOW. I wasn't really expecting much because the burgers looked kinda small and they were a bit on the pricey side but they were probably the most savory burgers I ever had. Service was excellent, our waiter was friendly and told us about the specials they had that night. They also have these tablets where you can view the burgers, sides, drinks and it even had games on it. Umami OS? FOOD was also excellent, went with 3 of my cousins and we split the burger to sample each one. One burger isn't really filling but after ordering some sides we were good.  I tried the Manly burger, Truffle burger,Umami burger and the Steak burger(special) and they were all deeelicious. The one that stood out the most was the steak burger, it had a bunch of weird sounding ingredients but they worked well and created a unique flavor. Our waiter said his favorite was the triple pork burger, ill be trying that next time. For sides we ordered tempura battered onion rings, steak fries and tater tots. Steak fries were meh, nothing special, replace it with onion rings another side. All the sides came with their Umami ketchup, it has this unique taste right when you taste it, it was addictive. Oh and for sides order the jalapeno ranch, these made the sides taste even better. Overall I really enjoyed Umami Burger. The food was more on the savory side rather than the quantity side.

The burgers here are pretty awesome! Every other restaurant will have a new take on the "gourmet burger". But this place. Wow, I can not put my feelings into one sentence, so instead, let me paint you a picture with my personal experience here. Being a foodie, I've wanted to try Umami Burger for the past YEAR. but for some reason I always ended up passing on it. Maybe it's because I just don't know how much better a burger can get since I tried In-N-Out.....I was wrong. Not hate for In-N-Out at all, in fact that's still my go-to burger joint. But if I'm feeling fancy or craving a non-beef burger, I will be making a stop at Umami. Came in last Sunday with the boyfriend for the first time. Gotta say, not the most clean place. The whole time we were seating down there were flies flying around, almost landing on our food many times. But I'm not here to talk about insects, I'm here to talk food. Tatoo guy took our orders, he didn't seem rude at all, I don't know why there's all the comments about the waiters' here being rude.... We ordered the sweet potato fries, iced green tea, Ahi Tuna Burger (off-menu), Manly Burger and Umami Burger. Did the boyfriend order two burgers? You may ask. The answer is: No, no he didn't. I did. So The Ahi Tuna Burger was my first burger. At first I thought it was a seared ahi steak, but it turned out to be chopped up ahi (or grounded?) ahi that was then turned into a patty and seared. The downside of it not being an Ahi steak is that once I took a bite out of the burger, it started falling apart. Mind, you, it was an awesome and messy falling apart. I ended up with a big chunk of the patty with I picked up and dipped in the guacamole (which also fell from the burger) and ate it with the pickled carrots (yes carrots, not just radishes) that also fell from the burger. The burgers are pretty small. It was indeed like a big slider, like some of the other yelpers mentioned. After downing first burger, I did not feel completely satisfied, so I thought I would try their signature Umami Burger. Meanwhile, the boyfriend is only half way through his manly burger. The Umami Burger came and straight away I was impressed by the efforts put into a single burger: roasted tomato slice? Grilled onions? Parmasan slice? Shiitaki Mushroom?? It was truly a vision, on my eyes and on my taste buds. The beef patty was super juicy and perfectly pink on the insdie. I felt like the parmasan was a bit too hard to bite into and did not blend in great with the other flavors between the bun. But that could be just me. So after two burgers I was happy! I'm not greatly impressed with the sweet potato fries, I've had better at many other places. And the green tea: why does it not taste like tea, and why is it sweet? It's a bit too heavy on the Fusion and not enough on the Asian for my taste. The bill was a bit shocking. The Ahi burger was $15 dollars! That's a lot of money for a burger! Although I have to admit it was pretty damn delicious. The bill came to about $50 for the both of us. Pretty expensive I must say, especially when the burgers aren't that big This is the kind of place that will keep me coming back until I've tried every burger on their menu. Which is a pretty achievable goal for me, seeing as I will be ordering two different ones every time I visit :P

So I will always remember the first time I went to Umami Burger, for it was the same day UBL went to swim with the fishes, May 1, 2011. We were en-route when I heard news over the radio. Coincidence? I think not, the stars were crossed for this meal to be eaten today.   I was ready to try some Umami Burger after hearing raves of how quality this place is. So I ordered the Umami burger, with a beer - Matilda. Burgers and beer should always go together if not solely for the heart healthy attributes of having a beer a day, but also for balancing a burger with a perfectly brewed beverage. The Matilda itself lived up to it's Goose Island Brewery hype and was a great compliment to the meal. Everything at Umami was fantastic.  The place was busy since it was a Sunday night yet for a table of 2 we were seated within 20 minutes, maybe 15. And to compliment the food, the service was attentive and upbeat - I have no complaints. I had a side of thin fries with the Umami ketchup to go along. I did not need another side of the "ketchup sauce" but maybe the 50cent price-tag for a refill stopped me. In any case it did taste good and fresh-er, like hand made ketchup would. It was pleasing and different. So cheers to Umami Burger for doing what they do!

After living right by Umami for over a year, I finally ventured over one night to check out what makes this place so popular. We tried out 3 burgers: Umami burger, pork burger and the truffle burger and the sweet potato fries. Umami burger - surprisingly, this was our least favorite burger and after the fact, we were thankful we didn't order 2 of these (since this was the namesake, we assumed this would be the best but decided to take the risk to try out more burgers instead).  The burger was good overall but nothing spectacular.  We ordered this medium. Pork burger - oh my goodness... so delicious. The pork patty had so much flavor and with the bacon and cheese... oh it was pretty phenomenal.  i will definitely order this one again. Truffle burger - yum another winner. just the smell of the truffle made my mouth water.  we also ordered this medium and the patty came out a perfect medium, great flavor and juices. delicious. all the burgers come in the same type of bun, which i loved and feel is worth mentioning because the buns did not fall apart in your hands and tasted so fresh and delightful.   Sweet potato fries - typical sweet potato fries which went well with the burgers and i especially liked it after i got the jalapeno ranch to go with it. will i be back? yes indeed but not when there is a long wait. the burgers are a bit more pricey (over $10) and the size is a bit on the daintier side (do not expect to have leftovers) but i think its worth the splurge every once in awhile.

No thanks. Over priced.  I am totally cool with an over-priced burger because I prefer thick quality patties over skimpy patties made with 80% fat and 20% beef. But not from here. I have had three different burgers from here, and all three of them just did not satisfy me. Will not return.

I was excited to try out this place after seeing it on Yelp. But don't expect to just walk right in and be able to get a table. I came here around 8 or 8:30 pm on a Sunday, expecting the restaurant to be relatively empty, but my family had to wait half an hour for our name to be called. However this wasn't too bad considering the popularity of the place. Everyone ordered the Umami Burger (because it had Umami in the name, so we reasoned that it must be good), except for my little brother, who ordered the Manly Burger (because he's sooo manly--NOT). The burgers were all cooked medium rare and were very juicy and flavorful and had a complex meaty taste that tasted different from other burgers I've had. I didn't get a chance to try my brother's burger; he seemed to like it, but looked like he was about to pass out from a food coma afterwards. It must have been the beer-cheddar cheese and all those bacon lardons. The sides we ordered--regular fries, sweet potato fries, and onion rings--were just okay (the sweet potato fries had an interesting cinnamon-y taste though!), so I will probably pass on them next time and just get a burger. Next time I really want to try the SoCal burger, which I've heard tastes like a fancier version of In-N-Out, my one true love. We got lucky with parking and were able to find a spot out front, but in general it seems pretty hard to find parking unless you do valet. Looking forward to coming back and trying more things!

This place does not look like much. It's in a dingy neighborhood and it's tiny but the decor is nice, the presentation of the dishes is great, and the burger itself (as well as the sauces and fries) is delish! I was expecting a lot and I got a lot so needless to say, I'm happy to recommend this place. Will be back. Honto ni umai!

Went here two or three times just to try it out. Unless you like your burgers still mooing, I suggest you tell them to cook it more. Both times I've been here I ordered out, so I wasn't able to take a bite of the burger beforehand. The first time it was alright, nothing special. The second time I essentially received a raw meat burger. Never came back after that. The fries are good, the ketchup, if I can call it that, is disgusting. Way too expensive for what it is--a below average burger joint.

I love tryin' places that are hyped up to the extreme. I go in with really low expectation and sometimes I'm pleasantly surprised and sometimes I just say to myself....... "Yeeeah..... I knew it".  Umami was definitely somewhere inbetween. Location: La Brea and right before Wilshire Parking: 2.50 for Valet or if you're not feelin' like a lazy fuck you can just park on the street like me which is around the corner. Just look at the signs. I was almost swindled into payin' for Valet but 2.50 is still 2.50.... It's the principle. I hate payin' for valet when I can just walk. Decor: It's nice. Didn't eat inside and ate on the outside patio but when I walked in to drop the kids off at the pool I like the swankiness of the joint. Burger: The bigggest thing I didn't like about the Burger is how small it was............. Like it's a tiny burger. Don't let the pictures on the side fool you. I'm not a fat-ass who needs to eat 20 things to fill up.  Maybe in college but when I think about eatin' like that again I think of it like the HOLOCAUST. NEVER AGAIN. It's about the size of maybe a Cheeseburger at In-n-out. I was still hungry after I finished my burger but still..... It's a great burger............. * I ordered the "Hatch" burger. It's legit. Got some green chilli peppers in there and it just sparkled in my mouth when I ate it. It's not spicy at all but it gives it a little kick which I like. Their other big ones are the Truffle and the OG umami. But Trust. Get the Hatch burger. Sides: Really good sides. They have great french fries Get the SMUSHED POTATOES. BOMB DIGGITY YO. Employees: Cool. Friendly. Price: It's a bit pricy... But it's LA. * If you made the hamburger a bit bigger I would come here a lot more.. Though, for now I gotta say 38 Degrees burger is better. But Umami is definitely worth checkin' out. Price

Day: Sunday Time: 1 pm A local brought me here to taste Umami, the 5th taste. I was hungry as hell and the Truffle Burger + cheesy tots hit the spot. The bun was lightly toasted, and buttered with a hint of garlic. I loved the truffled cheese and burger as well! The cheesy tots were not how I expected (read: regular tots with cheese melted above them). Instead, the cheese and potato mixture were combined, then fried making the tots appear regular on the outside. Our server was nice, and she reccommended the Three Chile burger. I will try this next time. PS- Read about the relationship between Umami and MSG!

I came here during the Summer of '11.  It was total spur of the moment and we didn't know what to expect, except that the burgers were supposed to be good.   I had a Manly Burger which was very good two bites into it.  That's when I started to taste the Dijon Mustard.  I loathe Dijon.  I wanted to give up on it and just give to my b/f.  However, I really liked the rest of the burger.  I tried scrapping off the dijon but knowing that it had been on my burger just made the process of eating it very uncomfortable.  I didn't wanna be one of those a-holes who sends back food either. I ate the most I could and the rest went to my b/f.  Next time, I'll be sure to order without the Dijon. The fries:  They were pretty good.  They didn't overpower the burger and they tasted great with their "ketchup".  We also had some jalapenio ranch on the side and it was the best!  I loved it.  (I even tried putting it on my burger to overpower the dijon.  Didn't work.) Now that I've reviewed it, I wanna go back.  Also, the La Brea location is really cute.  The waitress was super nice and responsive.  The crowd was diverse.  The restaurant was even full on a Saturday afternoon.   OH! They have "Mexican Coca-Cola".

Must get TRUFFLE BURGER! It's the best burger at Umami. Sweet potato fries are good too! This location is small. There's not a lot of seating and limited parking. Parking is valet too unless you're lucky enough to find street parking. No alcohol at this location too.

Very juicy burger. Always cooked medium rare. It's definitely over-hyped, but I can see why with all the unique ingredients. The burger was a bit small for me and it's pricer than other places. The lemonade was also served in a smaller than normal-sized cup, which I'm not too fond of. To be honest, I like Apple Pan better, but if I'm in the area to celebrate a birthday I might come here again. Interior is small. Lot's of packed seating with small tables and chairs. There were several workers, but I felt like it took awhile to get my food, especially since the burger is medium rare. Only valet parking or street parking. Lucky, we got there when they opened and found street parking.

I thought I would add an update to the new location: Umami Studio City: Decor is great and there usually tends to be bar seating opening if you don't want to wait.  The restaurant isn't really roomy.  It seems everyone is sitting elbow to elbow in their dining area.   Because there are other locations of Umami Burger and with The Counter and Laurel Tavern nearby, I don't feel it's worth 45 minutes for a burger as some people do.  But their food has been fairly consistent every time we are there.   Same favorites as last review. New trend: a "U" stamp on your bun.

I have experienced better... At the Santa Monica location. This one is extremely tiny with limited parking. However, valet is only 2.50 which is nice. So I guess you're supposed to wait outside to be seated. I can see why since it's so small but it would've been nice if they indicated that. We were seated at a counter facing a wall. This pissed me off because we passed three empty tables on our way to being seated and I would have much preferred that. However, we were in a hurry that day so we took the counter. The seats are too high for the counter so it's really uncomfortable, so i highly recommend waiting for a table. My husband ordered a diet coke and they brought him an eight once bottle of coke. Really?! It was comical how small it was. I didn't even know they made them that small unless it was for a mixer or something. Anyway, the burger: delicious. The truffle burger is out of this world. If you don't mind the pushy service (i thought i was being  herded through my meal) then go to this location. Personally, I really liked the Santa Monica location inside Fred Segal. They were a lot nicer and I at least got to sit at a table that my legs fit under.

I heard a lot about this place, but since I live in the inland empire, it was never convenient to try these burgers until recently. Its a hole in the wall place, so you have to keep your eyes open to find it. When you pull into the 10 car parking lot, its valet only. Ugh. I hate that. I don't like anybody driving my car, let alone having to pay someone to park it right where I would have parked it anyways. That is one of the ONLY parts about this place I didn't like. Anyways Its a small place, but we were seated right away. There is an electronic menu you can browse with about 8 different burgers. I chose the truffle burger for about $12.00. Yea, its a little pricey - a side of sweet potato fries is $4.00. Ok, so on to tasting the actual food. The burger's bun was soft and toasty, then taking the first bite of that burger I instantly knew this was the best burger I've ever had - no question. It was juicy, so flavorful with the truffle oil and marinade dripping out of it. I really wasn't thinking about how pricey it was anymore. I was thinking about getting another just because I was getting depressed seeing my burger get smaller after each bite. Yes - it was that good. The sweet potato fries were just as amazing as the burger - crisp, soft inside, packed with flavor and they were crusted with brown sugar. The best sweet potato fries ever? yep. Now, if they only replaced their strawberry lemonades with the same ones from Red Robyn, it would have topped it all off perfectly. Despite my strawberry lemonade not being a 10, and the parking situation with the valet being a total headache, there's no way I could give these burgers and fries less than 5 stars. I only wish I allowed myself to eat burgers on a regular basis, and I'd also wish this place was in the inland empire. You can't pass up Umami Burger.

My boyfriend and I visited Umami just to taste their vegetarian items...not bad! I had their earth burger: a flavorful burger with a smushy patty, literally. The burger is probably a few centimeters larger than the palm of your hand. In addition to the burgers, we ordered a side of sweet potato fries, iced tea, passionfruit something something...the experience was great, regardless, though I don't think I would splurge on another $11 burger again anytime soon. Parking is horrendous unless you take on their valet parking (which pretty much is obligatory).

Had the truffle burger.   Not disappointed by my decision to try Umami burger by any means, but nothing stellar to talk about.  Definitely overhyped. On the plus, service was great.   Umami ketchup was super good.  Onion rings were tasty, but too oily.  I felt like I had to wash my face right after.   Ultimately, a Father's Office burger is the better burger

Damn you gourmet burgers for being so delicious. I finally got around to trying Umami Burger on a day trip around L.A. with friends. Atmosphere: Valet parking for $2.50 or street parking around the area (if you're lucky). This location is rather small, but we came in around 1:30 on a Wednesday and we beat the rush. Food: I ordered the Truffle Burger ($12) while my friend ordered the Umami Burger ($10) and we cut them in half and traded. The Truffle Burger was really good - the meat was juicy and the truffle oil added a really interesting but satisfying taste to the pallet. I really liked the Umami Burger as well. We also shared sweet potato fries, which were average, and the Umami Ketchup really just tasted like regular ketchup. The size of the burgers may look small, but I was full and satisfied with them, and I was hungry. Service: Our waitress was nice and attentive. It's good and worth a try. Maybe I'll try the Santa Monica location the next time I'm around the area.

The staff are friendly & knowledgeable about the menu. Clarissa & I came here based on the fact that it was hyyped up on  Cooking Channel show. They have this salad....VERY YUM! Cucumbers, tomatoes, fresh mozzarella & this amazing  dressing! I had the "Manly Burger" w/c had lardon & fried onion straws... Altho the patty was tender... the burger was just a burger. No wait!

Amazing burger! One of the (if not thee) best. Super soft brioche, well-seasoned meat, great flavors and more. A few complaints holding back the 5th star are price, service and space. It's a bit pricey, but given the location and hype, it is expected. The service is pretty crappy, and the space is tight (although I've never had a problem getting a table within a reasonable amount of time). In any case, I drive 30 miles whenever I get the craving. The truffle burger is freakin' insane good.

My GF wanted to have lunch here, so I reluctantly decided to try it again. I must admit, Umami wasn't quite as bad as I had previously thought. The burgers were a bit tastier (still not that great though) and the buns were normal (see previous review). However, the fries came out lukewarm (this was quickly fixed) and the onion rings were seriously dripping with oil. Still not a fan. About 2.5 stars now

Ok the burgers are fantastic! The spicy turkey burger (not on the menu) is amazing! And Thy have ice cream sandwhiches from MILK! But, the attitude of the staff and all their" policies" are anti-customer. I came in at 5:30. Not a full house. 3 two top tables available and 2 four tops plus back room. They were real fussy about seating me in a two top. Who wants to sit at the counter in their dark back hole of a room staring At the wall? So in the end, I fought for my two top but not without getting the stinkeye from the host the whole time. Well atleast the server was nice and I ordered a ton of stuff just to prove that single diners are deserving of a well lit table. One more LAME policy is that they dont allow substitutions or modifications to their burgers.

My boyfriend and I had a great experience at this Umami location yesterday. It was my boyfriend's first Umami experience so I am glad that the service was great along with the delicious meal. My go-to burger is the Truffle Burger. So, so, so good! My boyfriend had the Umami Burger and that was good too. I love how the Truffle Burger doesn't have any garnishes on it but I do miss the veggies on top. The Umami Burger had the perfect veggie garnishes. My boyfriend loved my Truffle Burger so much that he ordered a second one. Our waitress was awesome and as I said, so relieved to have gotten great service after all the Yelp horror stories from this location. I believe her name was Kelly. She was patient and gladly recited the list of sodas and ice cream sandwiches flavors that they had available. Make sure to ask for her if you want good service :)

There's a lot of things to cover here, so I'll try to make it as concise as possible! Burgers - Although they were a little on the small side (I just have a big appetite), I was very pleased with my Manly Burger. Yes, for $11 it might seem expensive for many people and you could get a burger, fries and drink for the same price at In-n-Out, but the quality of beef used here is definitely worth it. It literally melts in our mouth. Substitutions - sorry folks, if you like your burgers well done, don't bother coming here. In all honesty, you don't deserve to eat here if you like your burgers cooked above medium. Why would you pay $10 to burn meat? Also, you can take things OFF of your burger but you cannot make any additions. Yes, the policy is a little weird, but get over it. Rules are rules. Sides - I thought the sweet potato fries were AMAZING! They sprinkled them with brown sugar and the homemade ketchup was bomb diggity. The tempura onion rings were also very tasty, but there is only about 6-7 per order. Handcut fries were alright. Dessert - yes, they do offer desserts from Milk, but why bother when that place is just 5 minutes up the road and they offer more choices. That's EXACTLY what we did!! Umami then Milk! Parking - can be a pain in the arse, but they offer valet for $2.50. Misc - indoor and outdoor seating. All drinks are served in bottles (not fountain drinks, so not worth the money in my opinion). They have tablets at the tables that allow you to split your check and have each person pay individually. I thought that was pretty cool!!

It's a burger joint. Get over yourself.   My guy friends like their burgers a lot. You need a spoon to eat the Earth Burger. (This is the third time I've tried it, trying to give it yet another chance not to be hot pudding on a bun.) The staff is rude and really snobby. Stingy with catsup. The Presto (handheld computer/menu/game thingy) is cool at the table but for the wait time you shouldn't have to pay $1.95 to play more than 2 games. Especially when 2 burgers, fries, and 2 cokes was over $35 not including tip.  I am officially over it. The Los Feliz location was much better al the way around.

Ordered the Umami Burger. Delicious! I would've liked more lettuce (I got ONE piece of lettuce!!), but I think that's just me. Most people would probably enjoy the measly one piece of lettuce... haha. We also ordered onion rings, and sweet potato fries of which I devoured! I also like that you would order your own dipping sauces that come in little spoons. What a cute concept! Overall, I could see why people stand in line and wait for these delicioso Umami Burgers. I would hope to visit more of their locations in Los Angeles in the near future.

Pretty tasty but not worth the price to me! plenty of places in LA now where they can serve an equivalent burger for a cheaper price, everything has its hype in LA and this place is one of them. Ok customer service, sometimes it feels like if they have an arrogant touch in their tones.... which I hate with a passion.

I think a lot of people hyped this place up. And when that happens, your taste buds change for some reason and what you eat is not as good... Well... THAT WASN'T FOR ME!!! I had the umami burger and I was blown away! I'm not even a huge fan of burgers, but I still liked it. I liked how they have different types of ice cream sandwiches too! I had the Thai tea one, it was yummy :)

Tasty but *GASP*!!!!!!!! overhyped. I like gourmet burgers as much as the next fella but can't honestly help feeling that the concept of turning a burger into a fancy dish is...well, silly. True, I haven't tried the famous "Father's Office" but at it's core a burger is a burger is a burger? Buns and a patty and whatever condiments or sides you please for in between. I mean, dressing up a street rat with expensive robes will not turn him into a prince. Be who you truly damn are, burger! I still tried this place because curiosity will inevitably kill all the cats. It's urban and cool inside, plus the burgers are indeed...tasty, though small and pricey. Had the Umami and Truffle burger. Truffle: recommended by a friend. It was good but super, super rich I'm sure I gained a pound with each small bite. Also, all of the meat juices were totally drenching the bottom bun to squishy death... Umami: Less meat-juicy but less messy and tastier in my opinion because it actually included veggies. Would recommend for the curious foodie, just because I might not have that refined taste palette, boohoo.

Quick update that I should've made months ago.  After my first review, I went back to this Umami Burger with a couple friends.  In addition to the Umami Burger, we tried the SoCal and the Manly, and both were excellent little burgers.  The SoCal was like a fancy In-N-Out burger with its house spread and caramelized onions, and I loved the roasted tomato on top.  The Manly was just that, a rather hearty burger with its puck of meat topped with beer-cheddar cheese, smoked-salt onion strings, and bacon lardons.  It was great for sharing, but otherwise it probably wanted something to lighten it up. Speaking of sharing.  When our server brought our burgers, my friend asked him if we could get them cut, as we were sharing.  We wouldn't have cared if he'd declined politely, but he pointed at my friend's place setting with his chin and said, "There's a knife." I still like Umami, as that was a minor incident, but I will never forget that disdainful tone of voice.  If Umami is the fifth taste, then the sixth could be the bad aftertaste one unpleasant encounter can leave in your mouth.

I have a good man. He doesn't bat an eye when I ask if we can drive from the O.C. to L.A., just to try out a burger joint that I saw Giada rave about on TV. I mean, here's this itsy bitsy thing telling me on national TV that her hometown favorite is a burger joint. It was worth the drive, IMO, even though hubs did the actual driving.  I also convinced the kids we were going to The Grove, so that I could justify trying out Umami Burger on the way. Was it worth it? To me, yes! Here's what we tried: the umami burger, port and stilton burger, and triple pork burger, with fries and onion rings on the side. Lets start with the fries. These were special! They were super crispy leading me to believe they had been baked then fried then probably baked again, or something along those lines, bc they weren't at all greasy.  The onion rings were good too although the fries were clearly the star. Out of all 3 burgers, I liked the signature umami burger best although the stilton burger and triple pork burger were close seconds -- the latter was especially flavorful. What makes the umami burger special?  The parmesan crisp and roasted tomato slice. I later tried to copy the same concept at home but failed miserably - there's no comparison to what I had here. The ketchup was overrated and tasted like...ketchup! The prices are a bit steep for burgers ($10+ per burger).  One big complaint I routinely hear is that the burgers are smaller than what you would expect.  On the other hand, if you want to play the glass-half-full card, some might say these are ginormous sliders!

I have 2 very hot, very young girlfriends that are still at that stage where they can eat whatever, whenever, however, they want.  So, when I have a meeting in this part of town I try to hook up with them to talk about fashion, boys and the newest, hottest craze.  They always want to meet here.  Luckily, we meet at off times, around 3pm.  So, getting a seat is never an issue.   Yes, the burgers are small but they are absolutely delicious.  Put a slab of high grade beef in between warm, soft brioche and you've reached orgasm.  The triple pork burger is my favorite.  I highly recommend getting the pickle platter.  Comes with pickled okra, beets, cucumbers and even kim chee (which was my least favorite).  The fries are... well... fries.  Nothing I haven't had better at other spots. Yes, do you feel like you can eat 10 of these after you've finished?  Most definitely.  But, I bet 90% of the times you eat those huge ass burgers that are usual for most joints, you walk out feeling like you're either going to die of a heart attack or pleading to God to have one.  At Umami  you walk out feeling satisfied without the gorge. Stop your gluttonous whining and eat like a normal person for God sake. P.S.  Order an iced green tea.

Went there yesterday night with my girlfriend. We ordered the umami burger, truffle burger, and tempura onion rings. I was expecting a line or some kind of wait, since everyone here has said they needed to wait. Luckily, when we went there I didn't have to wait. However, they gave us one of those dining style seats instead of a table. I wish the waitress could have asked us what we wanted, but she didn't. It wasn't a big deal though. Other than that, the service wasn't too bad. There was always a person looking to see if we had water and if we were doing good. The first item I took a bite of was the tempura onion rings. These were absolutely fantastic. The crispiness on the outside and the warm and soft onion on the inside was on point. These onion rings were definitely better than the average one. It was also interesting that they only gave a small amount of ketchup on a spoon for you to use. Any extra sauce costs extra... The umami burger was really flavorful, just as my girlfriend and I expected. It had a sweeter and a more savory taste than a regular burger. It was different, but different in a good way. The truffle burger was really good too. I felt that the truffle sauce in the burger really brought out the meaty taste of the meat. It went well together. In fact, I think I was more surprised about how good this truffle burger tasted than the umami burger. Both burgers had a great bun and were cooked just the way we like it. If you want a more meaty taste go for the truffle burger. If you want a more unique taste go for the umami burger. If you have two people, get both and split them, you won't regret it. Overall great food, but a little too pricey for me. They're definitely delicious, but the burgers are minute in size. $10 for a burger thats smaller than my fist. $3 for 5 onions rings, with the amount of ketchup equal to one sauce packet at mcdonalds. Still worth a try though, just won't be going here all the time.

We choose Umami Burger as a part of a foodie LA adventure because it was featured on Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate. Definitely deserves to be on Food Network! I chose the Socal Burger and my boyfriend chose the Umami Burger. Juicy beef, great house sauce and not soggy bun! Most burger joints that give a lot of meat usually have soggy buns but this bun was PERFECT. Not soggy, not too much bread and just enough for the amount of beef. The amount of beef was not too heavy either. The Umami Burger lives up to being the house favorite.   I LOOOOVEEEEED the house sauce!!! I am a SAUCE person and this sauce was bomb. We also had the recommended special of the day - cheese fries with truffle oil. NOM-licious. I was full after my meal but not obesely disgusting. If I lived in LA, I would go every other week for a quality burger fix. Chill place, pretty good service. Worth a pit stop!

Mexican Coke and Water. Love me some sugar caned Mexican Coke. They also have really distinct water glasses, they're super thin... Japanese Caprese Salad. Burrata Cheese, Baby Heirloom Tomatoes, Cucumbers with Mustard Dashi Dressing. This was very nommy. I liked how it was a different, fusiony take on the traditional Italian Caprese Salad. The cheese was very fragrant and cheesey, Nommy! Truffle Burger. House-made Truffle Cheese and Hamburger Patty with Truffle Glaze. This was pretty fragrant, but a bit disappointing since it's pretty much just a bun with meat and cheese. However, I did enjoy the truffle fragrance on my burger. I also liked how they stamp a "U" on their buns, pretty cool branding. Umami Burger. Shiitake Mushroom, Carmelized Onions, Roasted Tomatoes, Parmesan Crisp with Umami Ketchup. This was alright, more underwhelming than the Truffle Burger since this pretty much tasted like a normal burger with mushrooms, nothing too special aside from the "U" stamped on the bun. It's a bit overhyped and not as great as I expected. And though the truffle burger had a really good truffle essence to it, I've definitely had a better, fresher tasting burger patty elsewhere.

This was a good burger. A really good burger. A burger that I honestly devoured in about four minutes. This leaves me with a problem. Not a pickle, because the Manly burger comes with no pickle, but a problem. If I eat one burger, I'm not quite satisfied. If I eat two, that makes me a greedy little piggy piggy. I could go with the sides though. But that's the other problem. The french fries were decent at best.  Nothing outstanding, but a good amount for the money. Which is disappointing... if they can make a burger that good, the fries should be too. The onion rings on the other hand... Bad Umami. Bad! the coating? flavorless. The portion? Puny. Five rings and a crumble. Sing it with me people! Fiiiiiiiive onion rings Four person table Three bite burger (Too small for me) And an ok rating on Yelp.

Very small, casual restaurant, so it's not good for groups. If you come in a group, expect to wait awhile. I've been trying to check this place out because so many people I know recommended it, so I was pretty excited when I came here, but the whole experience was a FAIL. Umami burger is a pretentious place where they give you small portions neatly presented and hike up the prices. Food: LA: home of the food hype. Again, I found another place that didn't live up to the hype. Burger Fail. Although the the beef was juicy and cooked well, the burger, as a whole, didn't taste unique as most people indicated because it tasted like there was no seasoning. In addition, the bun was too greasy. I paid over $10 for a tiny burger with no sides. The sweet potato fries were decent, but for pretty much $5. I didn't get very much. Not worth it. Service: Mediocre. Rarely checked on us. What do I have to do just to get some service and a refill of water?!?! Parking: Try to find street parking, which is limited. Valet is ridiculous. Overall: Overpriced, mediocre food, small portions, terrible parking situation, felt claustrophobic. You could find much better-tasting burgers around LA for cheaper and bigger portions.

***Umami Burger is definitely tasty with juicier meat than Father's Office, but it is also quite greasy so it will probably turn off some*** After receiving several strong recommendations for Umami Burger, I decided to head back to give it another try.  After my first visit, I felt the food was way too greasy.  After this second visit, I feel the same. This Umami Burger (on La Brea) is the original location.  It is a small place with both indoor and outdoor seating (I caught a glimpse of the outdoor seating as I was leaving--outdoor seating here consists of tables on the side as well as a patio; the patio seemed bigger than I was expecting). The inside is straightforward and functional but also clean and comfortable.  The servers gave off a casual, everyday vibe (fitting with the atmosphere and menu) though service was not rude or indifferent.  My waitress was friendly, welcoming and attentive.  Food came out at quick pace. I went with the truffle burger and it was a soft bun filled with truffle cheese and a juicy and meaty beef patty topped with a truffle glaze.  The meat here is much juicier than what you will find at Father's Office.  Also, though the truffle flavor was appropriately distinct, it did not overwhelm the flavor of the burger.  The beefiness of the burger still came through bright and clear. The burger was so greasy though.  I can definitely see why people like this burger because it is very tasty.  I just can't handle the greasiness. I also had the smushed Yellow Creamers and those were good. The insides of the potatoes were soft and slightly creamy while the outsides were nicely crisp.  The potatoes were served over garlic aioli, which was perfectly fine, but I would have more preferred a more interesting flavor combination. For dessert, Umami Burger features sweets from Milk and Cake Monkey.  A long time ago, I had a freshly made and just out of the oven Cake Monkey cookie (chocolate cookie, pecans, marshmallow fluff, and caramel) and it was one of the best cookies I've ever had.  Ever since that experience, my Cake Monkey desserts have lacked that just-out-of-the-oven quality and the desserts have not been as good. That being said, I did try the Cake Monkey apple pie here and it was a strongly reduced sour apple filling with a crust that was dusted in thick sugar crystals.  The crust was great.  It was very flavorful and the sugar was nicely toasted so it provided a good crispy and satisfying texture without being overly sweet.  Unfortunately, the sour apple filling was way too strong and intense. The vanilla ice cream did provide a much needed contrast to the strong apple filling. With Umami Burger, it is all about preferences.  I could see people really liking the burgers here (even though they may be a tad small and overpriced for some).  I'm okay with the price, but the greasiness of it outweighs the tastiness and will probably keep me from giving them another try. Parking is available on the street by meter.

Finally got to eat here with Janette after everyone kept talking about it and I kept thinking about it for over the past year and a half or 2 years. Truffle Burger - brioche bun sandwiching a nice ground beef patty with truffle cheese, and truffle sauce, this burger was very simple. I asked for it medium rare but it came out medium. The patty was slightly too salty which slightly masked the truffle. However, the bun was amazing... lightly grilled brioche which was just sweet enough. This absorbed all the juices nicely. I feel like the burger would have been better if it was more rare for me. Umami Burger - also came out slightly overcooked (medium but ordered as medium rare). Parmesean crisp, grilled onions, mushrooms and tomato almost gave it a nice egg plant parmesean and marinara taste to the burger. Again, slightly salty on the patty, but the sweetness from the tomatoes and umami flavoring from the grilled onions created something nice that somehow worked. Smushed Potatoes - fried potatoes that are smushed then fried again and seasoned with salt and pepper... I would compare these to Kettle Chips Salt and Pepper flavor. They were really good, and priced pretty cheap (4.5 i believe). Easy to fill up on to I might add, so split this with someone like what Janette and I did. Overall, this is still 2nd to my #1 (Father's Office). The buns were probably the best buns ever. I feel that if they hit it medium rare, I would give them a higher rating as well, but they didn't, which is important to me since I like good quality meats rare and good quality hamburgers medium rare. The drive is kind of far, so I don't know if I would really drive out to eat here again, but if I'm in the area, hey why not, versus FO which I would drive to if I'm within 45min (sorry janette haha).

Today I got the chance to eat lunch at Umami Burger. I've heard about it over the years, and I was eager to try it. My uncle took me, my brother, and my little cousin and we ordered more than just the burgers: Umami burger: Everyone at our table ordered this. It was delicious! It's definitely something you have to slowly chew and savor to get the maximum goodness out of it. I loved how juicy the meat was and I also especially loved the mushrooms. I can't compare the Umami burger to In-N-Out or Five Guys burgers...I feel like they're all totally different things, and all delicious in their own right. Anyways, the Umami burger is amazing and I would order this again the next time I come back. Tempura onion rings: Definitely one of the best onion rings I've ever had. I think it's definitely because of the batter they use. Crispy yet not over-the-top deep fried. Smushed potatoes: My uncle recommended this side dish. Little golden potato nuggets served with a mayonnaise and black pepper dip. Crispy on the outside, soft and mealy on the inside. Simply delicious with the dip. Ice cream sandwiches (red velvet & rocky road): We ordered two of their ice cream sandwiches. My brother and I love red velvet cake, so we really wanted to try the red velvet ice cream sandwich, while my cousin loves anything chocolate. I had a bite from each and I have to say that although the dessert certainly had red velvet colors, it didn't really taste like red velvet...it was more like macarons with vanilla ice cream. But it was still yummy. As for the the rocky road sandwich, very chocolate-y, exactly what you'd expect. Overall, I was really satisfied with my meal here, and I would love to come back, but I probably won't come back too soon because I do think the prices are a little more expensive than they should be. That's the only downer of the place. But if you haven't tried Umami Burger before, you should definitely give it a try!

It's not bad. I'd rather walk a few blocks down the road and eat at the Counter, hell, probably even the iHop. It's way too expensive for it's own good, and it's way too overplayed in the media. NO "REFILL" SODAS, their drinks come in bottles...tiny 8oz bottles, and at $3 a pop, you're better off ordering water. Not only that, THEY WERE EXPIRED. They've figured this into the equation when making their food, too seasoned, and too salty. I felt like I dragged my tongue across the Sahara Desert, or deep throated the sandman. The food is... well, let's just say I don't understand why the super salty cuisine is voted some of the best in the U.S... There are A LOT of spices, the burger tasted like an armenian sausage (Sujouk). I had the truffle burger, and my friend had the Umami Burger, and we both noticed the sausage-y taste. You have to order the fries separately, and that's another $3.50, on top of the $12 burger, plus the $3 drink... If you take your date here, you better hope she's putting out. It was OK, but I wouldn't eat here again. If I were to come back, it would be for the condiments. I ate the food three hours ago, and it's still sitting halfway between my esophagus and stomach. And you have to pay for parking, Valet parking... And it's a tiny place. Not worth the hassle.

An essential item on the foodie bucket list.  We went here at 5:30 on a Monday evening and the waitress was prompt and knowledgeable.  She recommended the umami burger and the truffle burger.  Both were nothing like any kind of burger I have ever tasted.  There's no comparison to a fast food burger.   The fries.   The sweet potato fries are totally better than the counter's.  They're topped with what seemed to be cinnamon sugar and when dipped in the umami ketchup or garlic aioli they are unbeatable!  I don't like ketchup normally but the umami ketchup was something else...somewhere in between ketchup and barbecue sauce (in a good way).   Would I recommend it?  YES.

Tried Umami today, and the only good thing about the experience is that I'll never have to come here again. Service is bad.  Waitress forgot our order of pickles. We had to remind her and instead of apologizing, she gave a lame excuse, and said something stupid about the "refreshing pickles cleansing our palates." Also, since we were seated in the sun, we asked to be moved into the shade when the table cleared up.  After we placed our order, the table cleared up so we moved over (Our waitress didn't help us move our stuff, which is fine - it's a burger joint, I get it).   While we were still moving (some ppl in my group hadn't sat down yet), an older Latino wait person comes by, angrily accuses us of moving, and then plops our food down on the table. Lastly, when someone asked why her veggie burger looked blood red (and pretty unappetizing for any vegetarian) he snapped that it was duh, beets and that beets are red. Some people can forgive all bad service if the food is good, but in this case, the burger was not good enough to make up for the crap service.  I ordered the scallop and bacon burger which costs $15. The scallops didn't taste fresh to me and the pork belly on top was flavorless and slimy. The blood red veggie burger was mushy-soft, kind of like predigested store bought tofu, only dyed a horrible raw-meat color.  But since the earth burger costs $12, of course the vegetarian ate the whole damn thing. We also tried to truffle burger, umami burger, sweet potato fries w/ umami ketchup (Heinz 57 plus apple sauce?), and the pickle plate. Good, but not crazy delicious. Actually, the pickle plate wasn't very good. Thanks, Umami - the only sense I'm experiencing is disgust.  zing!

I think the burgers are fantastic.  Really good ingredients, and when you bite into the burger no flavor overtakes another.  Very balanced.  I got the manly burger (basically a bacon cheeseburger). If it was just based on the burgers it would be a five star, but I have to ding them a star for the sides. The dipping sauces were "eh, OK," and though the sides were decent (we got the smashed potatoes and the onion rings), they were not salty enough for me, yet there was no salt at the tables to fix it :/ For everyone who thinks the burgers are not big enough: On one hand, it's understandable to want more of a really delicious burger.  But on the other, I wish people would stop being so effing American, wanting everything MEGA SUPER DUPER sized for dirt cheap. No wonder why there's an obesity epidemic. The burgers are more expensive because they use great ingredients. I consider myself to have a healthy appetite, and the burger was big enough for me, especially with the side dishes.

To be honest, I think it's meh.  I compare all burger joints to In-n-Out as in "would I have rather just gone to ino?" Everything was good, but extremely overpriced.  The fries were $3.50 and it was only a handful (less than at In-n-out for sure!).  I shared them with my friends, and I guess I should have just gotten my own batch.  I just didn't want to spend 13+ on burgers and fries :/. The burgers were cute and plated really nicely, but they were small.   I went with the Unami Burger cuz after all, that's what the restaurant is named after.  The burger was good.  I like that they leave a little red in the middle.  Our server was whatever.  Food runner was a little rude, but it's probably because our server wasn't helping him much.  We were seated outside.  It was a hot day and there were a lot of flies everywhere. bleh.  However, if I had to judge just on the taste of the burger (sans everything else), I would go back and say it was good.

I would shy away from calling what I ate a burger. It's more like some fantastic meat, veggie, and bread concoction that just happens to be shaped like a sandwich with round bread. I liked the sweet potato fries, and their umami ketchup is something you will absolutely fall in love with. All the great things about ketchup, but with this extra little sweet/savory kick. The garlic aioli was pretty standard fare, but still good. Now I ended up getting the Triple Pork Burger, which I think was my best decision of the day. pork, chorizo, and bacon all ground up into a delicious patty. You can get beef burgers EVERYWHERE, but I have definitely never had a pork burger, and my was it amazing. Surprisingly, it wasn't greasy, but kind of dry... which is WEIRD for pork, but so amazing! The cheese and sauce melting around the patty gave it a perfect texture and flavor for the burger. I also tried some of my friend's umami burger, which was good, but a bit too standard for me. I came here for savory umami msg-style overload! The umami burger gets there, but barely, and it's nothing new. I will return some day, and try their other fare. But in the meantime, I will have to make do with the memory of that savory and succulent pork burger, delicious ketchup, and wonderful sweet potato fries. Thank goodness for umami.

Umami Burgers are one of the most delicious burgers I have ever eaten. The beef patties are perfectly tender and the sauce is like a party in your mouth. You almost don't want to swallow each bite just so you can enjoy the deliciousness. And even better than their mouth watering burgers, their service is exceptional. Kelly was very pleasant and wonderfully helpful. I look forward to being a regular return customer.

Looking at the menu, I was concerned to see there were only about 10 items on the menu and each item only listed three or four ingredients... but upon ordering I realized, why mess with perfection? The burgers were absolutely delicious! I went with my parents and we ate everything on the table, down to the brown sugar seasoning on the sweet potato fries. The special for this week was cheesy tots and when my dad ordered them I was expecting nacho cheese on tots. Wrong. Cheese was mixed into the potatoes before it cooked and each bite was filled with the perfect mix of tot and cheese. I am a huge fan of the manly burger (with onion strings and bacon) but was excited to see they have a few vegetarian options on the menu, as well. I left more than satisfied and will definitely be back!!

Burgers were good but too expensive for the amount given compared to other chain burgers restaurant.  The burger that stood out was the truffle burger but heard from the waiter that the best is the Port & Stiliton burger.  The service was impeccable.  Too bad they charge money just to play some silly games on that tablet of theirs.

Landed here when looking for a patio lunch spot on a lovely LA afternoon. I have dined at the Space 15 Twenty location on Cahuenga many a time and the combination of gourmet burgers and Leffe has never disappointed me. I was a little teary-eyed to find out the La Brea venue doesn't serve alcohol but you know what? Maybe they are looking out for my liver even if I'm not! I had actually never had the OG Umami, so upon the recommendation of the lovely Tiffany N, we decided to split that, a side of regular fries, and the truffle beet salad. It was a threesome of delight. We didn't feel the need to gorge ourselves silly and the beet salad was a nice compliment to the hearty burger. I didn't particularly fall in love with the burger, but I did fall in love with the truffle dressing on the salad. That little truffle wuffle made my day. Take advantage of the patio dining on a bright day. You won't regret it. Unless you like beer, then you will.

Not a bad place to get a burger, but doesn't live up to the hype.. All the burgers are special burgers so not very many options for your burgers but maybe thats to ensure the whole "umami" thing they are going for... Ordered: - cheesy tots- off the menu, these were good (cant go wrong w/ cheese + potato!) but sounded better than they were - fries- just regular fries but comes w/ housemade ketchup which was just ok - umami burger- parm crisp, shitake mushroom, roasted tomato, cheese - socal burger- fancy in and out burger - ice cream sandwiches from Milk :-) - pickle platter- don't think I'd order this again but was pretty fun to eat once Burgers are all medium-rare, although I asked for mine medium which they said was ok but it still came out pretty red. Taste was good but it got soggy pretty fast...Got close to 1/2 my burger and I could barely eat it w/ my hands anymore, so eat fast! Wait wasn't too bad (20 min for 4 ppl at 8pm on Sat night- but we did end up sitting in the outside patio) and service was good. Definitely recommend trying Umami at least once, even if just for comparisons sake ;-)!

Get Ready For The Rudest Manager in LA. Holy shit. What is wrong with that guy? Abi? Avi? I don't know. He was too afraid to even tell me his name. He was plenty brave to snarl, literally snarl, at my group for being in his way of the door. And plenty brave to shout, literally shout, that he didn't need our "attitude" when we objected to being snarled at by someone we are about to be served by an $11 burger from. I seriously thought this guy was going to physically fight us. I've never experienced anything remotely like this in a restaurant, ever. Great food, we all know that. But Jesus. Is it worth it? There are other burger places in LA. I'm not a complainer, but I will never be back.

The place is small - half of it is taken up by the bar and "kitchen", so there's frequently a queue to get in.   Once inside, the place is crowded, and it sort of felt like I was sitting on my neighbor's lap.  Side note - Sharon Tay (http://losangeles.cbsloc…) and Rick Garcia (http://losangeles.cbsloc…) from CBS & KCAL were there.  She's VERY skinny.  I think she ate something green - like a salad. ;) Also, the waiter *tried* to be attentive.  I say 'tried' because when he was there he was very attentive.  Unfortunately, he wasn't around much.  I asked for Ketchup and only got it when I was almost done with the burger. I had to ask for it *three times.*  When I wanted a second 'Mexican Coke', I had to crane around the room for several minutes before spotting him, and then had to get his attention - no small feat. The tempura onion rings were very greasy, which isn't such a bad thing, but a bit of blotting wouldn't have hurt.  The oil literally dripped off the ring.  The fries were good, but not as good as "In-N-Out".  I believe I read another review that said they are frozen.  In a place that positions itself as a 'premium' burger joint, frozen fries are a clear failure. I got the "Manly Burger".  That IS a tasty burger!   The burger was very good, but not as good as some others I've had (ie - Lunchbox Laboratory in Seattle).  Tasty and satisfying, but I don't know that it's worth the hassle necessitated by this small location on busy Ventura Blvd.

After a looong day of shopping.. we stopped by Umami Burger to grab a late lunch since we were around the area. I've had Umami bookmarked for the longest.. and wanted to get rid of it asap.. + my bf had their burgers twice before (without me! bastard... :P) and he said "they're not bad." So.. we drove down La Brea.. and saw the parking lot packed with cars waiting to be parked.. so we made a left at the next street and found free parking. hehe. When we got to the entrance, there were 2 other parties in front of us but there was no wait.. so we were seated right away.. and holy hell! this place is TINY!! anyway.. everything/anything tastes good when you're starving right? WRONG!! We had: - Umami burger ($10) - I was asked how I wanted my meat cooked.. asked for medium well since I hate bloody meat :P but it came out medium/medium rare.. the blood made my buns all soggy.. I ate half the already-tiny-burger and gave the other half to my bf. The only yummy stuff on this burger was the parmesan crisp thing. - triple pork burger ($11) - my bf had this one. It was soooo greasy.. when I tried to take a bite out of it.. about a whole tablespoon of grease dropped on my plate.. EUW.. but my bf liked it.. it's pork.. so it's ok to be greasy.. x] and we asked for their aioli (very bland) on the side which they forgot.. so we had to ask for it again. - tempura onion rings ($3) - 5-6 onion rings?! These just tasted like oil and we had it with umami ketchup.. our server recommended their umami ketchup.. and omg that ketchup was nasty (like they added too much worcestershire sauce or vinegar or something).. and it's 'housemade'... uhm.. yeah.. - Mexican coke ($3) - the bottled ones.. Total: around $33 So not worth it.

Strike one: We ran out of iced tea. After a brief skim of the reviews here, I realized this is a common occurrence. Do they even carry iced tea? WTF. You know what they DO carry? Mexican coke. I know, how fucking pretentious. Sure I'd love to add a $2.50 bottle of overly sweet cane sugar coke to my order that will not get refilled. I overheard a waiter telling another table about their amazing variety of sodas that only contain cane sugar - grape soda, orange soda, fuck you AND your sodas. You know why corn syrup is used? Cuz it's delicious. You know what's healthy? Water. You know what's not? Soda and burgers you fat ass. Strike two: 6 fries for three dollars. WTFSides. Even as I was eating, I mentioned. I bet some dumb ass on yelp is going to rave about how "cute" these sides are and how "cute" and "amazing" the condiments are served in asian soup spoons. Let me clarify it for you. There's nothing "cute" about fat fries that look like baby cocks. NOTHING. How about cutting your potatos into ummm. thinner portions instead of four thick ass pieces if you want to be cheap and only put 6 in a basket. There's nothing cute about the garlic aioli which tasted like garlic salt in a slab of butter. And there is nothing cute about tempura onion rings especially when your tempura batter is caked on. I'm sure some asian fetish couple will enjoy the novelty. Strike 3: WTFBurger. WTFPortions. WTFPrices. We got the Truffle Burger and Manly Burger. Both roughly the size of a man fist. The Truffle Burger supposedly had some truffle essence in the cheese but I can bet you if they labeled it something different, the word truffle would not even cross your mind. The Manly Burger had onion bits, smoked bacon, and cheddar cheese. Both were decent. It's not OMG delicious but it's not McDonald's. But the problem here is that for $10 and more, it's not worth it. The portions are skimpy. It's good, not great. You have to order sides separately. I'm not even sure if I'd come back if it was $6.75 and comes with fries. It's forgettable to say the least. (On the bright side, service was crazy attentive. We got asked "Is everything OK?" probably six times in the course of 30 minutes. There is zero wait for a table on a Friday night @ 8PM.) But it's never a good sign when you leave an establishment feeling ripped off and discussing alternate ways you could have spent 37 dollars.

This review is for: - Truffle burger - UMAMI KETCHUP - Onion rings - Sweet potato fries - Skinny fries ALLL WWW.BOMB.COM/ORGASMINMYMOUTH I read some reviews before eating here and I already had the idea of it being overrated and hyped up so my expectations were pretty low. It seems like whenever I have low expectations, I get blown away. And Umami was no exception. I also tried the manly burger....just, no. Stick with the Umami burger or the Truffle burger. I like tasting the meat and not all of that sauce. *WINK* I would totally Truffle Shuffle for the Truffle Burger. *Dies and goes to Umami Burger Heaven*

I've heard and read about this place and have been wanting to try it.  I went there for the first time last weekend and ordered the Umami burger and skinny fries to go.  The only good thing I have to say about this place is that the food tasted decent (not extraordinary but not bad).   The customer service was terrible.  The girl at the register that took my order had a snippy attitude and was not very pleasant.  After I ordered, she told me she would bring my order outside to me when it was ready.  So, I went outside and waited....and waited....and waited.....and waited some more until I finally asked the hostess that was outside if she could please check if my order was ready.  She came out immediately with my bag which, on top of my fries being cold by the time I got home (about 10 min away) made me wonder how long my order had been sitting there.   The food tasted good but the portion size was tiny.  For $15, I would have expected A LOT more.  I could have gone to In N Out for a fraction of the price and had a delicious burger and left full. (Not to mention Best Burger on Western, Louie's on Manchester, A-1 on Vernon....all of which have DELICIOUS burgers for 1/3 of the price).   I won't be going back.  I went to the one on LaBrea in a, somewhat, hip location which, I think, is why it gets the hype it does.  Don't believe the hype.

Burger #126: Over Hyped Burger Fail Being me has its many perks, one of which is getting emailed anytime anyone hears anything that has to do with anything burger related. This wealth of unsolicited information comes at a price; almost every day I have someone asking me what I think about Umami Burger, have I tried it yet, what do I think, oh it's so great, I'll love it. Never for any other burger have I gotten so many hits. So I have finally tried it, and here's my review. Meh, I've had better. The entire experience was a letdown, start to finish. To avoid the completely unnecessary valet parking, we parked 30 feet away on the street. Once inside, we sat, ordered and waited... and waited... and waited some more. After a bit they brought us a plate of pickled items to apologize for the wait. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… All of it tasted the same, as if all the items were pickled in the same solution. The only standout was the translucent one on the bottom left. Turned out to be pickled watermelon rind and it was pretty good. After a little while more, our burgers came out. I had the manly burger with fries and the girl had the SoCal burger with the spicy sweet potato salad. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Instantly I knew what the hype was about, the texture of the meat. It was the lone point of excellence of the meal. It was loosely packed, perfectly cooked juicy beef, which was a complete waste since they didn't season the meat at all. To make things worse, the ultra greased, super soft bun provided zero textural contrast to the mush-fest in my mouth. The large chunks of super chewy pork bits in my burger didn't go over well either. Why would I want to chew on the burger for half a second to only end up chewing on over cooked pork for the next minute? The sides were the next epic fail of Umami. The fries were unseasoned blocks of fried mashed potatoes, bland as all could be. I was very sad that there was no salt and pepper, those two lovers could have salvaged this mess. $3 for 10 fries was one of the biggest rip-offs in recent memory. The "ketchup" they serve is flat out gross, no reason to serve crap like that. The "spicy" sweet potato salad was even worse! This tasted like they somehow removed some of the natural flavor of the veggies, making it even blander! There was zero spice to the undercooked potatoes. It was just really bad. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… The meal ended up being $30+ for two, not including tip. For that kind of money, I could have had a better burger from a number of spots all over LA. You people need to stop hyping meh food.

I am officially allowed 2 burgers per year.  Just like I'm allowed mac & cheese once a year.  So when I select which burger I choose to eat, it is with very careful decision making. Typically, one burger out of the above burger quota involves In& Out.  Even my parents very much like it,  as I do not count my Grilled Cheese from there as part of quota, if and when this craving occurs on their end when I'm visting them. So quota one this year was where I made my buddy split a Fathers Office Burger on Montana Ave.  I actually made him get up again and order its sweet potato fries as well.  So Umami is where we went since I was craving burger quota two for the year. He actually insists that you really should allow yourself a burger a quarter, I kind of beg to differ.  He's a bit thinner than me, I think. So we both had ordered the classic Umami... Nice!  These are Japo small portions, which I completely appreciate!  I'd asked for it well done, but when I cut it down the middle, it was a bit pink inside.  Dismiss, since I didn"t want to create a scene... really not a big deal.  Esp since the burger was filled with shiitake, parmesan crisp and tomato!!  Loved the bun as well. Side dishes, we ordered the fries and tempura onion rings which were gooood... If you're gonna attack your arteries anyway, then go for the whole shebang. As your resident condiment whore, they are totally chincy with their dipping sauces, as they annoyingly serve it in Chinese soup spoons.  I say throw Tapatio in your handbag if possible.   My friend kept eyeing the housemade ding dongs at the counter...I said no thank you, as I was really stuffed, but encouraged him to take it to go. But no beer at  a gourmet burger place?  That's just wrong...  Next year, I'll stuff a bottle of red in my handbag since there's no corkage!

Ladies and Gentlemen, I now present, for your consideration, my 100th review. Let me begin by saying how much I thoroughly enjoy eating with other yelpers. They have discriminating palates, they share food, and if someone suggests trying a new place, they're all for it. Such was the case when I wanted to go to Umami Burger and 4 other brave souls decided to make it a dinner outing on Friday night. This is a small restaurant, like, really small. But you know what they say, good things come in small packages. They initally told us it would take 2 hours for the 5 of us to be seated, and though the wait was long, it wasn't that long. Parking is a big problem. Their parking lot is small so you may have to double or triple park and then have to get up in the middle of dinner to move your car to let some poor soul out of the parking gridlock. Street parking is not really an option because it's all permit only. I was told there was some across the street on 9th, but I didn't see any. Now for the good stuff... It's BYOB, so our resident alcohol connoisseur brought two bottles of zinfandel to accompany our meal. Corkage was only $5 and if you bring beer, I don't think you get charged...ask Ms. Mini Keg. They offer various other retro-type specialty beverages, but BYOB is better. They offer specials-of the day, and when we went, the specials were a scallop burger and yucca fries. The Yucca fries were delicious, especially with the housemade ketchup and garlic aioli. Sadly, no one was able to try the scallop burger, but our dining neighbors told us that it was delicious. I ordered the Umami burger, which was a medium rare burger with an oven roasted tomato, parmesan crisp, portabella mushrooms, and grilled onions on a soft, buttery bun. Perfection. All the makings of a perfect burger...it reminded me of an episode of "How I Met Your Mother.." where Marshall searches all around NYC for the perfect burger, and Regis Philbin is involved, and....you know what, just hulu it.  I heard from reliable sources that the Hatch Burger, So Cal Burger, and Pork Burger were incredible as well. The fries were great, thick cut and crispy on the outside while still being soft on the inside, the way I like 'em. The malt liquor beer battered onion rings were seasoned just right, but a bit too oily. If you ask for any of their housemade condiments, it will come in a tablespoon so ask for a few. The portions may look small, but they're actually the perfect size. You will definitely leave feeling full, but not overstuffed to where you will need to ask your dining companions to gently roll you out of the door. After two bottles of wine, yucca fries, french fries, and onion rings, we were too full to attempt the ice cream sandwiches or cake monkey desserts, but I see a second trip in the near future. The service was good, and they didn't make us feel rushed even though there was a line outside of poor saps salivating at our meals. The overall consensus at the table was a solid 4 stars. Will I return? Most definitely Was it worth my 100th review? Absolutely.

I just got a facebook, again, (many thanks Karey R) and I noticed someone dear to me posted the below on Wednesday, "I would pay good money to never again hear/read the word "epic," "fail" or any insanely clever combination of the two." So Hugo C...this ones for you! I'm going EPIC FAIL on this review update. Our server Skidamarink-a-dink-a-dink was pretty awful. He was very ho-hum, semi cocky, snarky, tried to be funny and cheeky but failed miserably. Him alone, ruined this experience for me. So my girl Shannon R. just got an ROTD for the joint a few weeks ago talking about how awesome their Earth (veggie) Burger was. You all know my love for the pig but I trust Shannon and her veggie bunny eating ways and if she said it's the best veggie burger then it probably is the best and I want to try it. Before arriving I knew in advance what I wanted to get. The Greenbird (smashed avocado, green cheese, sprouts, butter lettuce) but sans turkey patty and substitute earth burger patty. I was super excited to order my creation but was shot down in no time by scoot scoot. Scooter informed me that you CAN NOT substitute items. You can remove items but not add anything in addition. So no veggie patty in place of the cow or turkey and forget about adding bacon lardons to your So Cal burger. WEAK! When did Umami go all Father's Office on us? Don't even get me started how skeet scoot forgot one of our burgers saying "the kitchen didn't see it on the ticket". Umm the kitchen didn't see it bc YOU DIDN'T RING IT IN!!!! Their pricey for the portion small sides are mediocre at best. Skinny fries were overly salted and really Umami, you use frozen fries. Sweet po's were good and the jalapeno ranch, once he brought it, was even better. I'm not a fan of their grease filled o-rings at all and the smashed potato things were tasty once we were provided utensils to eat them with. YES WE HAD TO ASK FOR UTENSILS. I will return but only with Shannon as she promised me an Earth Burger date night Togo style, sunsets and the tar pits.

Oh my god, that Earth Burger was FANTASTIC!!!  One of the best veggie burgers I've ever had, honestly, because it was....wait for it....JUICY.  Well, kind of.  Enough so that I was impressed.  How do you make mushrooms and edamame so....meaty?  I'm going out on a limb and guessing magical elves.  It was ridiculously messy, falling all over the place, but I'd gotten take-out and generally have no shame.  Thus, hardly a problem for me. The tempura onion rings were one of a kind.  The onion isn't fried to goo, it's very present and full of flavor.  You only get about 6 or so rings per order, which makes the $3 price tag steep, but it's so worth it. Take-out burgers with sides came to a little less than $15 per person.  Not bad for a full, gourmet meal!

If I were naming this burger joint it would be called Mmmmami. Okay, I know that's kind of cheesy, but cheese and rice, these burgers are excellent! Sir Nicholas and I stopped by the La Brea Umami after a day of shopping when our appetites had been whetted and we were going to do some eating damage. There was (of course) a wait, but it wasn't bad - about 25 minutes on a Saturday night. As we sat down our server came over immediately and shared all the novelty sodas they served with us. Naturally I had to try one so I ordered up a black cheery soda and Nick got himself a ginger beer. We might have been tempted to try real beer, but this location doesn't appear to have any alcohol. Oh well, black cherry soda is delicious anyway. Then came the main course. Well, actually first came a pickle course. Yes, we ordered the pickle plate and while all the pickles were enjoyable I'm not sure I'd order it again. It's just odd to have pickles as an appetizer to burgers I think. Nick and I decided to order two burgers and go halvsies. Since it was our first time we had to get the signature umami burger. Our other choice was the hatch burger. The hatch was quite delicious with its four types of green chiles and house made cheese, but the umami burger stole the show. And I think this was all because of that dang Parmesan crisp. It was like the icing on a cupcake - transforming a burger into a delectable treat. Nick and I also shared sweet potato fries and the skinny cut fries, both excellent accompaniments to the burgers. My only disappointment was that I hear tater tots are sometimes served here as a side, but the night I came they weren't on the specials. Ah well, I have a reason to come back again now!

WHY DO I DO IT???? Why do I ever read anybody's reviews on places.  Well, because I actually do care what people think...no matter what I say.  But it was a lot of yelpers, some who I respect, who have led me astray when it comes to Umami.  Haters I tell you...straight up HATERS! This place is unbelievable!  It is easily one of the tastiest burgers...HOLD UP.  It is easily one of the tastiest DISHES I have had.  Screw burgers!   These burgers deserve to be in a league of their own.  I could go on and on explaining the burger but why, just go and try it yourself.  And not just one, try all of them.   I have had three different kinds.  The Umami burger is your standard lovliness but the Pork Belly burger, oh my god that PORK BELLY burger is straight grub.  And finally...the Truffle Burger is my favorite.  I tried it the last time I went and I have no use for any other. The burgers are not big at all, which I kind of like.  They don't need to be these huge sloppy messes which only add flavor by adding hundreds of toppings that don't allow you to even hold your burger.  These are perfect masterpieces!  Each bite is outstanding The fries are huge.  Yeah, you only get like 8 but still they are the biggest damn fries Iv ever had.  Get two orders if you want more. The Malt Liquor Tempora Battered onion rings are great too if your looking for a different option. ...And just in case you weren't sold yet let me go over a few other gems -Mexican Coke -Hard to find sodas.  (Ginger Ale & Ginger Beer) -Also Real Sodas -Ice Cream Sandwiches from MILK -Cake Monkey Desserts -LA Mill Coffee -House Pickles -Besides what comes on burgers you can also get one of the following for free: Their Umami Ketchup, Dijon Mustard, House Spread. Roasted Garlic Aioli or House Relish (all are great) Okay, so what the HELL can you say is bad about this place? Valet Parking?  Okay, park down the street and walk, your going to need it after your meal anyways Location/Crowds?  Its in one of the most un-popular parts of La Brea.  So that is good with me!  And I have never had to wait.  Especially now that there is going to be another one opening where the old Cobras & Matadors was in Los Feliz, this one should become even less crowded. Service?  Has always been fast, friendly and helpful.  But even if it wasn't, how many places have great service when they first open?  Doesnt really matter though since I pick up every time now. Cost?  Okay, well you may have me on that one, but please take me to a gourmet burger spot under 8 bucks and Ill re-write this entire review. I know a lot of people think a burger is a burger and for the most part...they are, but these aren't burgers.  The chef has taken time to find his perfect combination of ingredients and for that, I take my hat off to him! Thank you Umami!!!! Although I doubt you will ever hear me calling my fifth taste Umami, I'm definitely calling you every time I'm hungry. __________________________________________________­______ Update:  Although I love this spot, I now go to the Umami on Hollywood.  They serve alchohol and I can't resist a nice beer with my burger.  I suggest you do the same.

The Fifth Taste. What I will give this place is marketing. They have it down. They've thought through all of the angles, they've executed it to a T and the food they are serving is tasty. All of these get high marks, but where Umami fails me is in two elements: Price and Speed. I have paid a pretty penny for a deelish burger in my day. Deep down, I know that it's just meat and a bun, but I am always thrilled to see what people do with this simple concept to make it shine. In Umami's case they took a burger, put a "Manly" spin on it and delivered a yummy, decent sized burger that included beer-cheddar cheese (yum, and good since they have no liquor here, gotta get your beer somewhere), smoked salt onion rings (um, yes!) and of course, my favorite, bacon lardons. I don't even know what the hell a lardon is besides putting more "lard on" my ass after eating, but hot damn, totally delicious. But here's where it gets sad. We sat down, ordered, waited, chomped on onion rings, finished our burgers, had a bill delivered and were standing back out at valet in 16.3 minutes. What the hell? This was date night with a guy I actually really like and want to be on a date with. How did that experience whooosh by so damn fast?! Our guess is that the place doesn't really set the tone for a leisurely dinner. The lighting is really bright, the music fast and loud, the service quick, but does it need to be that quick? The place is also really tiny so you are pretty much on top of the next table and can hear everything they are saying. So basically, if you want to drop a pretty penny and be out the door before you know what hit you, then have at it. We figured after leaving that for what we paid, we would have rather tacked on $20 more dollars and been given an extra hour of dinner time and atmosphere instead of the serve em and get rid of em approach. Again, this will either be a plus or a minus depending on what kind of experience you are looking for, but that's what I took away, so there ya have it.

Allegedly, as per the chalkboard above the counter, Umami is Japanese for "tasty".  However, based on my experience here this weekend I've got a few different takes. Umami: it's Japanese for "decent burger, sub-par sides, and bland aoli". Umami: it's Japanese for "we're out of iced tea". Umami: it's Japanese for "someone will interrupt your meal and ask you how everything is every 3 minutes". Umami: it's Japanese for "you will pay almost $20 per person for mediocre food and still be hungry afterwards". I wanted to like this spot because the food sounds great on paper, it's super close to my apartment, and the people working here are nice and genuinely want you to enjoy the food and experience.  Sadly though, I just can't justify a $37 bill for two, tax and tip included, for an ok burger (tried both the truffle and manly) and sides that were disappointing in both quantity and taste.  Umami may mean tasty in Japanese, but in English it clearly translates to big on hype, small on substance.

I came armed with an AtCost coupon for $20 worth of food and drinks. Let's eat! Truffle Burger($11): I loved this burger. It was cooked to a tender medium rare, then topped with truffle glaze and a slice of Italian truffle cheese. It easily beat the signature Umami Burger. Savory and mouthwatering good! Triple Pork Burger($11): A Tex-Mex twist on the standard burger. A patty filled with three pork meats (ground pork, chorizo, and bacon), then topped with manchego cheese and a pimento aioli sauce. Yum! The downside was that my bun was partially burnt and gave a few bites a bitter taste. I also didn't taste the bacon, mainly chorizo. Sweet Potato Fries ($4): Simple and crispy. I wished it came with more Umami Ketchup. One spoonful was not enough for my love of ketchup. Raspberry Red Velvet Cake ($4): This mini dessert was made by online bakery, Cake Monkey. Originally wrapped in tin foil, our waitress thankfully unwrapped, cut, and presented the cake on a plate for us. The red velvet cake texture was a bit dry, but with sweet raspberry whip cream in the middle, I enjoyed it. It was rich despite the size and after eating the burgers, I was overly full. Diet Coke ($3): Named "Real Sodas" on the menu, it was served old school style in original glass Coca-Cola bottles. Valet parking was $2.50. We could have driven around for street parking, but I didn't mind paying $2.50 and we could watch the car. Also, this location no longer allows BYOB. Check out the other locations for beers and burgers.

Awesome customer service...yes! Unique contemporary decor....yes! Unique menu...yes! Freshness...yes! Food...just ok.... I know I know...I'm probably breaking a few hearts, but the burgers were just eh for me.  Everything tasted fresh and good, but it didn't leave me with any type of wow factor to it.  The one thing that left me wanting more was there smash potatoes with cracked paper and sea salt.  Those were deliciously made with their own dipping sauce.  A return to Umami isn't quite in the cards for me, but I'll return if others want to try it.

There's something about LA and their donuts & hamburgers. Everyone seems to be fit in this city but how can that be when there's a burger and donut joint at every corner. I love burger joints that gives you several different options of toppings and sauces to choose from. I got the truffle burger and my friend ordered the kombu meal #3 which included the hatch burger (different types of green chilies, house cheese), came with the tempura battered onion rings (yummy) and a hoegarrden: $15. They had a pretty extensive burger menu that included cocktails and different types of beers. Umami is all about the perfectly sized burger with the juiciest meat, ever. Bonus: most burgers are under $10. I could eat a unami everyday if it weren't for the pounds that I'd rack on or the health issues that I'd later develop.

GQ rated this place burger of the year for 2010. If GQ given Umami burger that distinction, I had to check it out. I almost didn't make it out to Umami burger but I had some spare time and made it! I only had a limited amount of time but the hostess was able to seat me quickly and the server was able to get my food and bill just as fast. I ordered their signature Umami Burger and side order of thin cut fries. It is cooked medium rare, has parmesan cheese frico (it's like cripsy cheese), roasted tomato, carmelized onions, grilled shitake mushroom on a Portuguese style bun. The burger itself was pretty good. Biting into it and tasting it, it gave you the "Umami" taste (sweet, sour, bitter, salty). The burger tasted like it was beer marinated and the crispy cheese gave it a nice crunchy taste that paired well with the overall taste/experience. The bun was crisp on the outside and soft inside. The thin cut fries were good. Is it worthy of burger of the year for 2010 or the best burger I ever had? Nope it wasn't. It was good but it wasn't the best. I have to say that Atlanta's Holeman & Finch Burger is tastier.

May 2nd, 2009 in the evening we came to this place. I saw Smith Cho, http://www.nbc.com/Knigh…, sitting across from where our small group was. I was excited that I was invited to this PYE and to try these talked about burgers. Laura B. did mention this place was small but it is very small. My living room is bigger than this whole place and my driveway is probably able to accommodate all the parked cars as well. That just makes it that much more of an intimate group. I even invited Santi who was visiting from Hawaii to join us. With a small corkage fee, you are able to bring bottles of wine and surprisingly bottles of Belgium beer Vinh brought too. What I'm really interested in was reading the description of the Umami Burger. Fantastic combination of flavors. We were then recited the specials where the "manly" burger caught my attention when it was described as their version of a bacon double cheese burger. SOLD, I'll take one of those specials with a side of the sweet potato salad. When the orders came out, the sweet potato salad was described to have some spicy flavors to it. Served cold as a salad should I guess, it was good but missing something. It would have been better as sweet potato fries as the group mentioned. I really really liked this "manly" burger with the most interesting flavor in there besides the bacon and cheese I taste. It's something about the sauce that isn't just BBQ sauce. I couldn't stop eating until it was completely gone. Not to be out-done, I heard Austin ordering a second burger, Vinh already beat us to it by ordering two right off the bat. I would like to try the Umami burger this time. Santi explained to us in Japanese, Umami means 5 flavors which I can see and taste. Roasted bell peppers, mushrooms, parmesan cheese melted into a slice like it was American cheese, the sauce and the meat of the burger. This was good but I should have started with this and ended with the "manly" burger instead. Jackie G. and Katrina S. said they loved the "SoCal" burger. If any of you decide to go here again, please do not forget about me. I will bring a bottle of wine for you but I will eat two again. Thank you for inviting me, I appreciate it.

I have to go against the grain here and say this was not the best burger ever. It was damn good, but not the best. We arrived on a Sunday afternoon and the place was pretty packed. It took about 5 minutes for them to seat us and I felt a bit cramped, but hey, the more the merrier right? So, we sit down and wait another 5 minutes to get menus. I notice that the waiter seems to be a bit cranky or maybe he is just feeling stressed out. I felt the service was a bit lacking, almost lackadaisical. He seemed to be annoyed. Perusing over the menu, my eyes immediately went to the Truffle Burger. Yummmy. I love truffle anything! I picked that and my boy had the Triple Pork Burger. Dang. We also got 3 order of fries and 2 onion rings for the 3 of us. My kid opted to not get a burger. Food arrives approximately 10-15 minutes later. Hot damn! My burger was very simple, just a beef patty topped with truffle cheese and finished off with truffle oil on the bun. I took a bite and was like damn, this is really good. Then, I saw that the meat was medium rare. Umm.. yeah.. not a fan. I don't want my food MOOO-ing at me. But, my boy assured me that is how a burger should be cooked. Kiddo asked for a bite since she saw that it had no veggies. What is up with kids not eating their vegetables?! She liked it as well. Boy took a bite too and loved it.  He ended up ordering one because his pork burger wasn't that good. Hahaha.. dat's right. When in doubt, go with truffles! Fries were fat, decent, nothing special. I liked the aioli sauce you get to pick to dip them. Personally, I'm more into the skinny fries myself. It gives me an impression that eating fries makes me thin. Yeah. Right. Onion rings were good! Crispy with just a touch of greasiness. Can't complain. Portions here are on the small size. At $11 for the truffle burger, I wish it were bigger, but I was stuffed after eating half of that and some fries. Fries were $3 and onion rings were $2.50. Pork burger was $9, but don't get it if you are craving a real burger. Total for 3 people- $50 before tax and tip. Overall, I'm glad I came here. But, they should step up the service, or maybe that's just how they are over there. pix- http://pandaliciousforme…

This review has been a long time coming.... Sorry! 3.5 stars for the food 5 stars for the cool Yelpers!! If you know me well, I rarely eat red meat and consuming a burger is is like seeing Haley's comet. What brought me to a burger joint was definitely the company. I ordered the Hatch Burger ($9) which had four types of green chili on top of the beef patty and ate 1/3 of the burger. It was so tasty and spicy. I reserved the rest of my meal to my bruddah who really enjoyed it. Honestly, I should have, could have, would have finished the whole thing to experience the fifth sense of taste. Good things about this place is the semi-private back room, reasonable corkage fee and the spicy sweet potato salad. The parking could be hectic but they have a valet service as a last resort. The service was good and the owner was definitely a businessman- all about the bottom line. Thank you so much Tim C for the invite and introducing me to all these wonderful Yelpers! Meeting all of you was the best part of the evening!! Rain check on the karaoke, okay?!? Mahalo!!

I'm glad I returned. :) The Casablanca burger* (that used to be an off-the-menu special) was just what I wanted. It's now permanently on their menu. Hoorah to that. A very texture and flavor balanced burger. I tried my friend's Port and Stilton burger and it was one of the juciest burgers ever. I kinda sorta really really wish they had delicious sweet potato fries on their menu. That would put that one last happy star on my review. ---- *Casablanca Burger: Lamb, pickled apricots, tender greens and pomegranate aioli

I finally went to check out Umami Burger after reading all the hype.  I went here with my ex husband, his son and our daughter.  We drove out of our way to try this place. My ex husband's son liked his Umami burger.  I tasted a bit of it.  It was okay, but not $10 okay.  Our daughter ordered the So Cal Burger.  I tried a little.  I didn't like the flavor, but my daughter said it was okay.  Again, not $11 okay. I ordered the beets salad, which was excellent.  I really enjoyed it.  The onion rings, however, were nothing special. The service was rather slow and inattentive.  I realize that the die hard burger fans (which I'm not) would disagree with me, but I just thought it was an overpriced faddish place.  I don't plan on returning.

This fancy burger joint has been hotter than Megan Fox on the Yelp charts for the last two months. My foodie friend from NY came down a month ago and had read all about this place (even across the country), so we decided to come down on a Friday and grab lunch. Down the 10 and off on La Brea and.. there it is!  Just past the giant stuffed tiger shop on the right.  I turn into their parking lot and there's just absolutely nowhere to go, so this helpful Korean lady from the copy shop comes out to help us double park behind another car.  Thanks!  I hope you know we're not here to come to your store. Already I'm a little peeved because of the traffic and hard parking.  I'm thinking to myself, why would I come back here?  This place isn't even big enough for all the hype.  And then, after a wait, comes the food... UMAMI!  It is a Japanese word used to describe taste.  While it has no direct English translation, it's reserved for things tasty and great.  The Japanese also have another word "umai", which means delicious.  They're so close, that both would be acceptable to use in this restaurant. We split three burgers in two: Socal Burger, Umami Burger, and the Blue Cheese. I had the Socal burger, and at first bite, i thought it tastes very similar to an In-N-Out cheeseburger.  It has all the ingredients--3/4 pound patty, lettuce, cheese, a thousand island dressing based sauce, and all sandwiched by fresh buns.  Each ingredient is a major upgrade from In-N-Out.  Their cheese is all made in-house.  Their burger patties are incredibly savory and tasty.  Their buns toasted slightly crispy on the edges but soft and spongy throughout.  In fact, my friend could not stop raving about their buns. The Umami burger was probably my favorite.  Grilled mushrooms and tomatoes lend some sweetness to complement the savory meat.  And the two contrasting tastes are divided by a crispy cheese chip.  It's like a ref holding two boxers back in the ring known as your mouth as they battle each other for taste supremacy. Blue cheese can be overpowering, so unless you're a huuuge fan of blue cheese and are eating with someone that doesn't mind the smell of it, I would try a different burger. For sides, the onion rings were fantastic.  We skipped the fries from all the reviews saying they just don't give you enough. Unfortunately they were out of the pork burger that day (which seems to happen alot), so I made a separate trip to get one to go later on.  It is just as marvelous as their beef burgers.  Oh, that makes another note... given that their parking sucks and the store is small, I highly recommend just getting your burger to go and eat it at the beach, park, or even your cubicle.  I brought it back to my office in Hollywood and EVERYONE hated me. This is the best burger I have had in my short time in LA, and probably deserves a spot in the perpetual debate of burger supremacy.  Everyone should come here and try it at least once. pics and post: http://myweekendpassport…

Sink those carnivorous teeth into that fluffy, fluffy bun, and chomp through that thick beef patty.  The meat is cooked perfectly medium.  Let the burgers beefy juices squirt all over your face and all over your shirt and table because there is nothing sexier.  Take a minute to wipe off that excess drippage and move on to take another bite.  Enjoy, savor, let all the flavors unite in holy (unholy?) matrimony and ignore the people you came with, because, I mean, who cares about them for now.  There is nothing that will rip you apart from this perfect moment of burger bliss.  Close your eyes, let that feeling sink in, relish the flavors of the sauce, marvel at how the shittake shrooms help to heighten the sensation, experience how the cheesy chip adds a refreshing crispy layer. Ooooohh mammmi--- that's what she'll have anyone saying. I'm already begging for more.

Umami gets docked one star alone for NOT serving alcohol. What a joke?! How can you have a burger without a beer? The server says to us, "but we have 15 sodas on the menu and I can read them off to you." Yea, Dude... Whatever. We ordered the Umami burger and the Manly burger. The Umami burger was better than the Manly burger. However, both burgers were over cooked when asked for medium rare. And the manly burger tasted like my dad could have cooked in the backyard and both were very over buttered. As for sides we ordered the truffle french fries and the onion rings. The fries were good but the onion rings were soggy.  I am not sure if the ketchup we got was the umami ketchup but it just tasted like ketchup. Overall the burgers were expensive and somewhat disappointing. At least the wait isn't long because NO one is drinking. Father's Office RULES! :P 2 1/2 Stars

Goddamn, I have no idea how to rate this place because I was simply too distracted during the meal to concentrate on the burgers. Let's just say the food is a 3 but atmosphere and service is 4 so I'm just going to say it's a 3.5. I met the vivacious Namella K at Umami last night. I found street parking but they have a $2 valet. She utilized this as she had her little doggie in the car and the valet guy was very nice about it. Everyone we encountered at Umami was super nice. Various people helped us throughout the night including the guy who wedged something under the table to keep it from moving (side note, why do restaurant tables always wobble?) to the hot guy who opened our wine and described desserts to us. We ordered the Triple Pork and Stilton burgers along with the house spread and garlic aioli spreads. We also got french fries and onion rings. The Triple Pork was way too chorizo-y for me. I was kind of bummed out the bacon was barely discernible. I would not order this again but others might like the flavor. I did enjoy the Stilton burger with the onions. But like I said, I was a bit distracted. I was listening to Namella expound on life and love and every now and then, some brilliant flash of FLAVOR would explode through my mouth. Ah, good burger. As for the size of them being too small. They're not. However, they're not huge like regular American burgers but I would say they're just a bit smaller than 8 oz's burgers. We split the burgers and I was quite full. I ate the bulk of the sides though and we did have dessert. The fries were fine. I liked them better than the onion rings which were very greasy. They left a pool of oil in the bowl they were in. Of the dipping sauces, I liked the house spread best then the garlic aioli. The Umami ketchup was too sweet and vaguely Asian-y. Namella said it was better the first time she had it. Last night compared it to canned tomato sauce a la Chef Boyardee.  Hmm. Since I don't eat ketchup anyway, I was happy to skip this other than the first taste. For dessert, we had the two Cake Monkey cakes available; Raspberry Red Velvet and the Chocolate Peanut Marshmallow. Both went really well with the Barolo wine I brought in. The restaurant is fairly small and they don't take reservations. Luckily, we beat the rush and I would recommend going in smaller groups as it would be hard to get a table for a large party. There's only one unisex restroom which seemed to be constantly occupied. Umami is close to Little Bar so it might be a fun burger and wine bar night.

Don't pay heed to the haters out there. This ish is goooood. I, too, was a skeptic. What the heck?! $9 for a hamburger and no fries! Bitchy waitresses! Not another trend out here in LA! Nu uh oh no. I finally gave in. Ever since my burger at Mesa Grill in Las Vegas, I've been on the hunt for the best burger. This was the closest option since it is walking distance from my place. Umami must have read some of these Yelp reviews because everything is now different. Yes, it is still pricey with small portions. We ordered the Umami Burger - reg & veggie, No. 5 Burger, Turkey Miso Burger, Malt Liquor Tempura Onion, and Pearl Couscous Salad. All flavorful...really it is. I'm salivating just thinking of it. It is better than a Big Mac and large fries at half the price. Hmm quantity or quality? Up to you - wallet and appetite. All I can say is that this place is definitely worth a try at least ONCE.

This burger looks tiny, but it is actually quite filling! I ordered an umami burger, and it was delicious! I wasn't too impressed with it the first few bites because I wasn't expecting it to taste sweet. But I must admit, it grew on me. The meat was sooo tender and juicy! The flavors went well together, though on the sweeter side. If you're looking for something more savory, I'd say try one of the other burgers. The one thing I didn't like too much was the parmesan crisp in the burger because it was a little bland and tasted more hardened than crisp. But overall, it was tasty! We also had some sweet potato fries, but they were topped with cinnamon. Again, a little sweeter than I liked since my burger was already sweet, but still good!

I'm just gonna say it... despite what the critics or media say, if you think this is the best burger in LA, SoCal, your life, etc., then you really haven't been around LA. I can't even remember what it was like having Umami Burger for the first time awhile back (yea, it was that unmemorable). All I remember was that the "5th taste" is really just MSG. I recently went again this weekend with friends since they've been wanting to try it, except I ordered the Port & Stilton Burger. We all ordered 3 different burgers with 3 different sides and were very unsatisfied with all of them... like we've all just been robbed of our precious Friday-night-appetites. My Port & Stilton (bleu cheese, onions) was not bad for a bad burger, but it was for being $9! It's dressed up like a typical gastropub burger, but tasted nothing like one! The top bun came stamped with what looks like a vulva & the bottom bun was almost completely soggy, which made the burger even smaller than it already is and it felt like I was eating mush. Same as the Umami Burger... NOT WORTH IT. Don't bother expecting any of the sides to save the day either, especially the oil-drenched onion rings (see photo). Everybody! Stop depriving your taste buds with this mysterious "5th taste" (which, again, is MSG) & go to The Golden State, Father's Office, or 8oz. Burger Bar! Way better in quality, ingredients, flavor, and they won't try to trick you into eating their food because of a "5th taste" either. (Refer to my Burger List) Umami also doesn't have their own desserts, they serve Cake Monkey desserts, which you can easily buy from the Sweets Truck, and Ice Cream Sandwiches from Milk, which you can easily buy from Milk right down the street. Therefore... I won't miss anything & you won't either!

An incredible burger. Thats how a burger should be, tender meat and juicy!! "Umami" in Japanese means "tasty" and it sure is. The owner Adam is a fantastic guy. They are suppose to open up the patio for dining soon. Perfect for the summer. I've been there about 4 times so far with a variety selection of burgers and these were what I tried: Umami Burger (Tried it twice and was juicy and mouth watering. Wanted another one right after I finished) Triple Pork Burger (Wanted to try something different as pork in a burger sounded interesting. Very tender pork with a special sauce. It was unique.) Port & Stilten Burger (Recommended by the owner my 4th time there. Was delicious. Tender and Juicy as always and the blue cheese was a great compliment to the taste. Waiting to go back to try the other ones.

So there's been lots of buzz about this place and I'm a burger fanatic. As soon as I read the reviews I was determined to immediately check this place out. I called the girls and we were ready to burger down. Even though the parking lot is pretty small, it's relatively easy to find street parking on La Brea or on 9th. I found parking on La Brea, directly across the street from Umami. We arrived early on a Friday night -- 7ish. We were seated immediately. I wouldn't say the decor is upscale, but it's uber nice. Upscale for sure for a burger joint. Absolutely the kind of place you could take someone on a date (unless he or she is money impressed whore). The menu is simple, I appreciate that. They literally only serve burgers and sides (fries, chips) and cool sodas. My Mexican girl got the Mexican Coke -- I've never heard of such thing, but it's heavenly sweet. Sugary goodness. We ordered 2 spicy chili pepper burgers, 1 pork burger, onion rings, fries and sweet potato chips. Burgers were $9 each and the sides were $2.50 or $3. Chili pepper burger: I enjoyed my burger, but it didn't taste like a beefy meaty burger. I generally don't like my burger on the pinkish side, but it didn't bother me. It was soft -- the burger that is. There was a delicate essence to the burger. My bun was equally soft and pleasantly sweet. The chili peppers were actually quite nice and spicy. But here's the thing, I was so not full after eating this burger. And I don't consider myself a hippo that needs to stuff her face. But I was definitely still starving. Triple Pork Burger: My girl loves pork, I mean loves it. I took a bite of it and it was really rich. Not in a good way. She felt ill afterwards. But there are tons of people who are super into very fatty pork, but that's not me. Onion Rings: It's tempura style and crazy greasy. I wasn't a fan. Fries: Yeah, there's not that many. But here's the thing, they're triple fried and heavy. Ya really don't need that much. Crispy and nice and salty. The grease factor didn't bother me, the fries absorbed the grease well. The fries are awesome. Sweet Potato Chips: Save your money. They're not anything special at all. Blah.

I don't see what the hype is about this place... I got a Umami and a side of Onion Rings and my bf got a Manly burger with a side of fries and garlic aioli sauce... Umami Burger ($10) Tasted ok, but it was just so messy, greasy, and the bun was soaked in juice and oil... Onion Rings($3) was horrible... No flavor, just battered and all I can taste is the oil. Manly Burger ($10) was too salty, also messy, greasy and wet buns :(  My boyfriend described it as Carl's Jr's wester bacon cheese burger with better quality meat. French Fries ($3.50) tasted like old Carl's Jr. Fries, and the garlic aioli tasted like mayo with garlic powder... So the meat was cooked perfectly Medium/ medium rare, just the way I like it, but everything else just didn't put the burger together like how a good burger sould be... I don't think I would be coming back here again.

Back to the scene of the crime....2 weeks later....with bf and awesome fellow Yelper Ciara G.!! Even though the group waiting at the 2:00 hour on this Sunday looked daunting, we got a table in FIVE MINUTES, woohoo!  Based on my last visit and this one, I still consider myself ruined for any other burger because of this place! Why: The SoCal Burger ($9.00): ended up being my FAVE today!  The unctuous oven roasted tomato and spread and cheese made this a slippery, sexy, deliciously messy experience of a burger today - in all the right ways! The Port & Stilton Burger ($9.00): still super, with its blue-cheesy, caramelized oniony yumminess.  But for some reason hit my tastebuds in a more explosive way the first time.  Was it me or them?  I'll have to do more research to confirm this, heehee.  This was still bf's fave. The Hatch Burger ($9.00): for a non-Jalapeno lover, I thought this was a really yummy one too!  The tender pieces of mild Jalapenos were partying in a cheesy sauce-y topping on this burger.  Messy, not overly spicy, pretty good! The Umami Burger ($10.00): we cut the burgers in fourths, so perhaps the piece I got was missing part of the mushroom or didn't have enough of the cheese crisp on it, I dunno.  It was good, but just not as good as the others.  Definitely needs more future research... The Triple Pork Burger ($11.00): cooked all the way through (bc it's pork) and flecked with little green onion pieces, this patty was flavorful but not my fave.  I guess I like my meat rarer than pork can go. Tempura Onion Rings ($11.00): OOOOH, light and crispy, greasy breading with tender onion in the middle, these rings would be the death of me if I let myself get them as much as I'd really like to! Not so skinny fries ($3.50): crispy on the outside and meaty on the inside, skinnier than a thick steak fry but not their skinny fries - a little too salty for me. The only sadness of the day was VERY SAD for me:  they were OUT OF the Truffle Burger!!!  =O   I guess that means we HAVE to come back for it.....sigh.......such a chore, such a chore : P. Umami Burger, it's starting to look serious between us.

Solid burger with size issues. Each burger I've tried was impressive and delicious, but made me want more.  One time they had a special burger with home made siracha which blew my mind. Never plan to come here since friends from out of time usually ask me to take them

I hate writing a review for something I didn't try, but I just need to let y'all know that even though their website says that they are open from 11 am to 10 pm, this is apparently NOT TRUE.   We came here today (Saturday) at around 3:45 pm, and the waiter told us that they were not accepting any more customers because they were closing the kitchen and preparing for dinner time.  WHAT?! I was so disappointed.  They wouldn't even let us do take-out.  I went out of my way to try Umami today.  It'll probably be the last time I do so.

YUMMY YUMMYYYY UMAAAAAMIIIII!!!! I was so excited to try this place after all the hype! I came in today for lunch with a couple friends. My first impression of the place was bad because they ran out of Diet Coke! What an atrocity!! So I reluctantly ordered a Coke. However, they made up for it because they sold it in those cute glass bottles! Ooh~ I was starting to like the place! Now for the EXCITING part! I got the SoCal burger which had butter lettuce, oven dried tomato, caramelized onions,  american cheese, and their delicious spread. The buns were perfectlyyy toasted and the meat was oooozing with juices!! I was in love after the first bite! I also tried a bite of my friends' Umami Burger and Triple Pork burger. I personally liked my SoCal burger the best because I'm not a personal fan of mushrooms which the Umami burger has a lot of, and the Triple Pork burger was a little TOO crazy flavorful for me. Definitely has a fiery KICK! The burgers are a little on the smaller side but I thought it was the perfect portion! I felt pretty dang full afterwards. Guys, on the other hand might wanna order two! Burgers range from $9-11 so it's a tad bit on the pricey side. We also shared a side of their malt liquor battered onion rings which came with a side of ketchup. I expected this to taste a lot better but unfortunately, it wasn't as crunchy as I would have liked it to be, and the taste wasn't really there either. Meh. Disappointment! As for parking, there is a small teeny little parking lot in front and the spaces are kinda hard to get into and out of especially if it's crowded. But despite that, I would definitely come back again! :)

Coming off the plane from my vacation being cut short, I figured what better way to celebrate by having lunch at Umami Burger with fellow homie and Yelper Steve N.  We make our way through the LAX traffic and within minutes await for Umami to open for lunch service. Getting there early enough allowed is to snag parking across the street. Going inside it's a bit tight (can only fit about 20+ people on a busy night as Steve noted). We got our orders which is the following: -1 Umami Burger -1 Truffle Burger -1 Side of Malt Liquor Tempura Onion Rings -1 Side of Smushed potatoes w/ Aioli All pictured here; photo courtesy of Steve N.:(http://www.yelp.com/user…). Let's start with the smushed potatoes. Is it a chicken nugget that's really a potato? A lazy way to cook up some spuds? I don't know, it was moist and piping hot coming out of the kitchen. Texture wise, it was a bit mushy for me. Definitely a nice touch with the aioli, wish we had more though considering I can be a condiment whore once in a while. The onion rings were perfect being light and crispy. With the accompanying barbeque sauce it made for a perfect side dish. Now onto the burgers: it all becomes preferential. Steve enjoyed the umami version better, a bit more stacked in flavor and texture.  I also believe the umami has a bit of tanginess in aftertaste. Whereas the truffle burger was just rich, super rich but I love this kind of cooking especially coming home to California. Truffle glaze and cheese melted together to become a symphony for savory. I should have ordered seconds of the burgers and onion rings. Spent about $37.00 plus tax and tip. Customer service was decent and friendly. I need to try the rest of the burgers before giving it a perfect score. I guess there's a reason why this is one of the best burgers in LA. Overhype or not, just bring me more. Cheers.

This review has languished in the "unfinished review" pile for a long time.  I think its because I really wanted to like Umami Burger.  I wanted to have a good experience and eat something delicious , but alas, the universe had a different plan for me. I took a couple of girlfriends to Umami Burger to check out the hype.  I like the idea of harnessing umami-ness.  I'm a truffle craving, meat eating, salty lusty-flavors loving girl.  Umami Burger sounded like just the ticket, but the overall experience was just disappointing. The triple pork burger I ordered was juicy and flavorful, albeit a tad over salted.  I still enjoyed the burger, I happily munched away thinking, "Getting this burger took forever, but its ok, but its so good."  Then I realized my two dining partners had stopped eating their burgers.  They stopped eating their burgers because the burgers were raw in the middle. RAW.  Not medium-rare (red but cooked), these burgers were straight up raw in the middle.  So raw the meat was falling apart.  When someone came to check on us, we mentioned that the burgers seemed a tad undercooked. At this point, the whole experience can really tip either way. I love that they have real sugar sodas, I loved the malty onion rings and my triple pork burger was porktastic.  However, the manager/owner(?) did not deal with the raw burger situation well.  He insisted that the burgers were medium rare, that the kitchen takes the temperature of every single  burger the kitchen fires and also informed us if we wanted "well done" burger we should have specified our wishes.  Who said we wanted well done burgers?  We all happily eat medium rare burgers, which would have been fine.  This burger was not cooked.  I'm posting pictures.  Please notice how super red the inside of the burger is, ie raw.   I felt so bad for my friends, maybe because my burger was good, I paid for the whole meal as quickly as possible and took off asap.   Why were they turning people away at nine when they're supposed to close at 9?  Why is the rude dude we dealt with tearing out of the parking lot right behind us at 10:10.  Seriously, homie if you want a job where you punch a clock, get out of the restaurant business.  If you want people to come back to your place of business, don't talk to them like they're idiots who don't know the difference between ad raw and cooked meat.  I don't know if I'll ever go back to Umami Burger.  Even though I enjoyed my own burger, the bad customer service left a nasty aftertaste.

Yum!!  Umami burger is delicious.  I drove by and got a truffle burger to go and was totally excited to try it and it was so savory.  Later that week I took my co-workers here and had a delicious lunch with the So Cal.  I recommend lunch, so that you can park on the residential streets in back (before 3pm).   My favorite burger is the SoCal burger, because of the butter lettuce and the sweet tomato.  The portions are overall a bit small, but its a fancy burger restaurant not fast food.  I liked the onion rings and the fries, since we had 5 people, they gave us one of each sauce.   Minus 1 star because they made us wait at our table for 20 minutes before we could order.  We saw tables after us, get served and finish eating.

Virginia D.'s timeline of food addiction Date: June 2006 - June 2007 Addiction: Pinkberry Description:  Waited in line for 30 minutes and paid $4 something for a cup of small yogurt at the OG pinkberry shop on Melrose, then went back 3 times that week!   Ate Pinkberry once a week for almost a year! Date: July 2007 -  September 2007 Addiction: Nazi Chef Sushi (Aka Sushi Restaurants that serve Omakase) Description:  Drained my wallet for $$$$$ sushi- Tried Sushi Yotsuya, Nozawa, Echigo, Sushi Zo, Hiko, and others in the span of 3 months Date: October 2007 - January 2008 Addiction: Cupcakes Description: Went on weekly cupcake runs + brought cupcakes for everyone for every occasion.  Happy Tuesday?!  It's cupcake day! Date: May 2009 - TBD Addiction: Umami Burger Description: Went to Umami Burger last Wednesday, went back on Saturday and I want to go back NOW! ----------------------- When I find something I like I start craving it all the time!  I get these uncontrollable urges and have to eat it at that moment!! I'm a foodaholic. I know. It's a problem.  I've been doing better. I'm taking baby steps and It's been 30 days since my last cupcake. I thought I was cured of my food addictions and then I took a bite of the Umami Burger and sadly I can feel it's starting happening again..... I went to Umami Burger for the first time last Wednesday.  Umami Burger is in a quiet strip of La Brea. I've passed by it multiple times and never noticed it. We arrived at approx. 8 pm and waited 20 minutes to be seated.  Umami Burger is not your typical hole-in-the-wall burger stand. The space is modern and sleek, filled with black tables and chairs, ceiling high windows, and Asian inspired fixtures.  It is a hybrid of a fast-food stand and sit-down restaurant. The tables are covered in white paper with the Umami logo.  Waiters take your order, but then place the order number on your table, so other servers know where to deliver your burger. I waited about 30 minutes for my burger and by that point even the table covers started looking tasty! Can I at least have the fries to munch on? I ordered the Umami Burger.  It came with caramelized onions, roasted and marinated tomato, Parmesan crisp, grilled shiitake mushroom, homemade ketchup and a medium rare meat patty on a sweat brioche bun. I was knocked out by the complexity of the flavors by the first bite. Flavors of salty, bitter, sweet, sour and Umami in conjunction with the churchly, soft, chewy, texture and a well seasoned, perfectly cooked and packed meat patty created an amazing tasting burger.  Loved it!  Can I have seconds please? We also ate: Triple Pork Burger: Packed with so much goodness in the meat patty. It was a burst of flavors. Hand Cut Fries: Aiight. I prefer skinny crispy fries.  It was good for steak fries. Ketchup: I did not enjoy the ketchup. Please just give me the Heinz! Malt Liquor Tempura Onion Rings:  It was like tempura at a Japanese restaurant, except WAY too oily after only 10 minutes On Saturday I ate: Port and Stilton Burger (Blue Cheese, Port Caramelized Onions) with a glass of Charamba Douro 2005 purchased at the neighborhood liquor store down the street.  It was recommended by Umami Burger. Loved the BYOB and the $5 corkage fee.   I loved the burger, but do not recommend the wine with this Burger. The wine is too over powering for a burger that also has really strong flavors. For my 3rd burger, I want to try the Truffle Burger.  Truffle + Burger? Sold!   I now have an Umami Burger Addiction. I need to go back for a 3rd visit!  Gotta go, gotta go, go go go! Anyone game? Rating: 4.5 (took off  1/2 a star for waiting a long time for my burger )

During my most recent visit, I got to try the Truffle Burger & the Triple Pork Burger. The truffle burger is fairly simple;  it only comes with italian truffle cheese and truffle gaze. And, that is all you need. This little burger is oozing with so much wonderful earthy flavor. The truffle really made the burger seem "meatier," which I absolutely loved. It made the burger seem bigger than what it actually was. The Triple Pork Burger with chipotle had a Southwestern flavor profile. The burger was juicy and full of flavor, if you love pork you must get this! Out of all the burgers I've had, I have to say my favorites are the Umami Burger and the Truffle Burger. The fat fries are STILL not good, but the skinny ones are deilcious. We also ordered a toffee ice cream sandwich. The toffee ice cream was delicious and the sandwich part was reminiscent of a macaron!

I've been waiting for an establishment to challenge the monopoly Father's Office has on the Westside on gourmet burgers. Looks like Umami Burger has answered that challenge. I am loath to admit I found out about this place through Thrillist. 99% of their emails I consider spam, but every once in a while, they let me know about a restaurant that I might be interested in. So when they announced that Umami was having a soft opening a few days ago, it piqued my interest. I drove by the place on Saturday night, but they were already closed. Today I called them around noon and someone answered stating they would be open between 5 PM and 10 PM. I arrived around 6:30 PM. The parking lot is tiny. If you can't find a spot, perhaps you could try using the valet service of the neighboring restaurant. Or take your chance with the meter maid on La Brea (its free to park after 7 PM) or permit only neighboring streets. Or try parking at the Car wash across the street when its closed. Like the parking lot, the restaurant is small. It can maybe seat 30 people tops. It took over a lease from a Korean restaurant that didn't make it. I kind of chuckle at comparing this place to Father's Office (FO). FO is founded by a guy of Korean descent that modeled his establishment on 1950's Anglo Father's Knows Best type of genre. Umami is founded by a white guy who who went for the Asian genre instead. The owner is Adam Fleischman, who sold Bottlerocket in Culver City a year or two ago. Umami is his latest love child with his biz partners. For those of you that don't know what Umami means, its basically the Japanese word for savory. For those of you that love booze with your burgers, sorry but this place isn't a gastropub. Its strictly a burger joint with a straightforward menu. There are several burgers you can choose from, most of them in the $8 range, which is actually a very good price for a gourmet burger. Most gourmet burgers tend to cost $12 or up in other establishments. They also have a few side dishes. One major plus is that they serve Mexican Coke, which is made with cane sugar instead of the acidic tasting corn syrup. I took pics and close-ups of the menu, so all the names of the burgers, side dishes, etc. have their pricing included. I ordered the house specialty Umami Burger, the roasted garlic potato salad and a Mexican Coke. Total damage was $12.45. Not bad. I thought it was interesting that the Umami was the only burger on the menu where the contents weren't listed on the menu. If my memory serves me correctly, it has the following: oven roasted tomatoes (which is very similar to sun dried tomatoes, just a bit more moister), shitaki mushrooms, oven roasted Parmesan cheese (almost like fried cheese), Umami ketchup, and the burger itself. So how does it taste? Really good. Its a juicy burger. I couldn't taste the mushrooms though - their taste was overpowered by the oven roasted tomatoes. I will point out that though I found the burger to be filling, the heavy eaters (you know who you are) out there probably won't be satisfied unless they eat 2 burgers. What was disappointing was the garlic roasted potato salad. I really wanted to like it since I love the Russian blue potatoes. But the potatoes were barely cooked. Some of it tasted like I was eating a raw potato. I think steaming the potatoes would be much better in preparing them. I saw some neighboring diners order the fries and it just looked very skimpy in portion. I understand they are trying to get that Zen like ambiance you get at sushi restaurant, but for heaven's sake, this is a burger joint. Then again, its great if you are on a diet. Overall, I liked Umami burger I had that I want to try their other offerings. I'll probably come back with my foodie friends in a week or two so that we could order everything in the menu in one sitting. The only problem with meeting here in a group is the tight parking, which I pointed out earlier. I would recommend a party no larger than 8 people, and carpool if you can. The place also currently has limited hours. They are open for lunch and for dinner, but its not continuous between the two. Your best bet is to call ahead to make sure they are open when you plan to dine there.

Ok I agree on the weird number of fries they give you, it's kinda like, being on a date with a really attractive dude and finding out he has a small...intellect. In any case, I'm a convert to Umami Burger! Best blue cheese burger ever. The bun they use is from a local bakery -- not that crappy sesame, but soft almost heavenly bread. Burgers are HUGE. Size matters. The price may seem a lot at first, but your total meal for you and your favorite burger buddy will be less than 25 bucks! I say that's good for gourmet burger style. Problems this place has? Few mostly because they are only 10 or so days old. Service is inconsistent, though the waiters are super super nice. But I think they're just figuring out their traffic flow. Also, this place is going to be epic. I mean...epic. And the building size is just not going to cut it. They need to find a way to maximize the size more -- whether through some new table arranging...or if they want to expand next door. The parking is also kind of weak sauce...I had to park down the street and around the corner. It's free parking so I guess I see why. Oh free parking, stop teasing me with those sexy lines and open spaces. You heard it here. Umami burger --- EPIC.

Opened just recently by Adam Fleischman, who also owns Bottle Rock and Vinoteque, the whole concept behind Umami Burger is simply to focus on foods that have a high umami taste index and you certainly can't get more "meaty" or "savory" than having burgers on the menu. Something also worth mentioning is that Adam does all the meat grinding in-house, which means that he can definitely pay attention to quality control. Hearing all the buzz, Robert, one of the Assistant Organizers of my dining group, Pleasure Palate, decided to set up an informal Burger Tasting there. Safe to say that 8 people, 16 burgers (2 of each 8 varieties, cut in quarters), various sides, Mexican cola with real sugar and Cake Monkey desserts made for a fun and filling culinary experience. Before I start talking about the burgers, let's talk sides first. Of the three we got, my absolute favorite and the favorite of the table was the Malt Tempura Onion Rings, which were light, non-greasy and crispy. If you're into onion rings, these are a must order. Soon, the first 4 of our 8 burgers arrived. The one I gravitated to first was the Sea-Mami Burger, an open face scallop burger with nori and meyer lemon on a toasted bun. This was by far my favorite burger of the night. The scallops were tender and delicate and the nori added the right amount of saltiness. Next was the Triple Pork Burger, with a patty made of fresh ground pork spiced with chorizo, cob-smoked bacon, aged manchego and pimenton aioli. Spices from the chorizo and the smokiness from the bacon really gave an oomph to this burger. This was also the first time I got to sample both top and bottom of the bun and let me tell you, the bun at Umami Burger is sheer perfection. I loved the fact that it was soft, pillowy and even just a tad sweet. That sweetness balanced well with all the "umami-like" ingredients in the burgers. Lamb also made it on the menu in the form of their Mideast Burger. Made of sonoma lamb with honey-harissa sauce, it was a good burger, but it needed something else. There was a vibrancy in taste that was missing, especially when compared to the first two burgers we had. The last burger of that initial quartet was the SoCal Burger with butter lettuce, oven dried tomato, spread, house made processed cheese and caramelized onions. The SoCal Burger is a take on the In-N-Out Burger. So was the SoCal Burger better than the In-N-Out Burger? Taste-wise, I'd say Yes. Would I drive 45 minutes from my house just to get the SoCal Burger? No, especially if In-N-Out was just 10 minutes away. However, I would make the trek for other burgers on Umami's menu. After a little rest, the rest of our burgers started arriving.  The first one to do so was the Pork and Stilton Burger with blue cheese and port-caramelized onions. This was actually my second favorite burger of the night. It was just so meaty and rich with strong, intense flavors coming from the blue cheese and the port. Absolutely delicious! Following the Pork and Stilton Burger came the Truffle Burger with Italian truffle cheese and truffle glaze. The meat itself was excellent, but somehow, the truffle flavors were too subtle for my palate. I was expecting something more earthy, more woodsy, but didn't get that or perhaps, I'm just missing the boat entirely about what the truffles were supposed to contribute to this burger. Second to last was the self-titled Umami Burger with grilled onions, fried Parmesan cheese, grilled shiitake mushrooms and an oven dried tomato. Considering that this the was signature burger of the restaurant, I was expecting to be wowed by it, but ended up thinking it was just okay. The flavor of the mushrooms didn't really pull through and the too tart-sourness of the tomato overwhelmed the burger in general. The last burger that we sampled was the Hi-End Chili Burger with Grated Artisan Cheddar. I think most of fellow diners were underwhelmed by this particular Umami offering, but I liked it alot. The chili was excellent. It had good flavor, it didn't have beans and it wasn't oily. The one thing I would have done differently would be to actually amp up the chili with more heat. Believe it or not, we still had dessert after all that food. We ended up sharing Cake Monkey Desserts, which included Ho Ho's and Red Velvet and Peanut Butter "Ding Dongs." The Peanut Butter "Ding Dong" tasted too artificial, if that makes sense, but the Ho-Ho's and the Red Velvet "Ding Dong" were the perfect sweet ending. Overall, I really enjoyed almost everything we ate that evening. What I really appreciate about Umami Burger is that it's obvious that they care about using quality ingredients for their food and with such a creative variety of burger offerings on their menu, I really think that Umami is destined to be one of LA's go-to places for delicious gourmet burgers.

After having this place bookmarked for months I finally made my way there last night because it was the only time I could have gone. So disappointed. So, so disappointed... (I seem like the odd woman out with the one star, so just hear me out.) The entire experience was crappy. I'm not usually someone who has bad luck with this stuff. My boyfriend and I have always had great experiences when going out to eat. We ended up just sucking it up and doing the "valet" for $2.50 because for some reason everyone and their dog were occupying parking spots around the immediate streets. I don't mind walking, but after a mile I say forget it. We were seated immediately, which was strange because there were like 10 people waiting outside. We must have been the only couple going into eat, otherwise that'd seem really odd to me. First of all, we were sat down at one of the tiny tables they have inside. It's very, very close quarters which doesn't bother me, but the two girls at the table next to us were obviously really mad we got seated next to them. Listen, I'm about 8 inches away from your face. I can hear you talking. SUCK IT UP. I should also mention I had a mini-can of Coke with me, and I had it set on the table. It was empty and I was planning on getting a drink, but this huge guy (who clearly must have been some sort of manager) walked up to me, and in an extremely condescending voice said, "We -don't- allow outside beverages so you're going to have to-" and before he could even finish what he was saying, I handed the can to him and EVERYONE in the room was looking at me because he was SO LOUD. Jeebus, tell everyone about it, why don't you? For what it's worth, I have absolutely no problem if that's your policy, but listen, don't fracking talk to me like that. I'm a paying customer. [/end rant] The wait time here is incredible (not in a good way). I think I saw about six different waiters/waitresses walking around and it took 30 minutes to get our order taken. I had the truffle burger and my boyfriend had the Umami burger. The texture and flavor of the meat is what this place has going for them. Definitely nothing fancy for $11. The truffle sauce was DELICIOUS, I will admit. I wish the burger was bigger. I suppose it was a tasty little snack. I finished it in all of four bites and I felt kind of awkward, because everyone else in the entire restaurant was eating theirs with a fork and knife. Um... yeah... who are you people? We had ordered thin fries and onion rings along with dijon mustard and garlic aioli for the sides. We were served thick fries, a whole ten of them! Wowzers! Catch the sarcasm? We were also served the onion rings but both came with ketchup. I asked the next waiter walking by if I could have it corrected (like, um, now, because you all take so long) and he ended up correcting it. Came back 10 minutes later with thin fries (a whole 30 of them! Wowzers!), my mustard, and aioli. The onion rings were decent but the fries tasted like a bunch of nothin'. While we were waiting to pay our expensive bill (For $35 we can go to 25 Degrees or a slew of other burger places in the area and have money left), I noticed the couple seated to the right of me got a free ice cream sandwich because only half the order ever got to the table. They ordered two burgers, and they had ordered before we ever sat down. The guy got his burger, she never got hers. The same guy who took my Coke can told her that her burger came out wrong the first time, and the second time it came out, they dropped it, and they "forgot" about it because the "kitchen was so backed up." Whilst that is going on, the two guys to the left of me are trying to order, and he wants iced tea. They are out of iced tea. He wants the triple pork burger, they are out of it. Then they ordered and the waiter came back out to tell them they were out of something else but I was leaving so I didn't catch it. Plus two of the waiters were on their cell phones and kept walking back and forth, so that was awfully distracting. If you're on your break, go outside and talk. Unprofessional much? Look, your food isn't good. You have 10 tables in the entire restaurant and as far as I know, three of them either couldn't get what they wanted or had a messed up order. Seriously? Think I'm over-reacting? If you look at my reviews, I don't give less than three stars very often. Almost never. Think you're so high and mighty with your 1200+ reviews of people who obviously like being treated like crap? After trying to call them that same week to complain without anyone picking up, decided to send an e-mail. For what it's worth, it didn't sound like this review. I nicely explained what happened and didn't even get a "sorry," just "you waited too long to file a claim, can't do anything about it now." Fuck you. Umami, you are the epitome of FAIL. Oh, and the valet guy lost the car. Took forever to find it on a neighboring street. Meh.

Cliff notes version: Truffle burger = Best burger in town. There's enough talk about this place on Yelp so I'll make this short and sweet. If you set aside the wanna-be foodie snobbery and high expectations, you'll LOVE the Truffle burger. Or the Umami Burger. Or any burger here, really. My fave, that I will always order is the Truffle burger. This petite burger is epitome of umami - the meat is so full-flavored, and just melts in your mouth. The brioche bun is just a touch sweet, and so fluffy. This aint ranked #10 Top LA Yelp Eatery for nothin'. Tips: * The waits are killer at all Umami's -- be prepared to wait, or even be prepared to drive off to another location if the waits are super unbearable. * Just order water or a beer, because the sodas are extremely overpriced and teeny-tiny. It's smaller than an aluminum can!!! Me, the diet coke lover have learned it the hard way * The smashed potatoes are BOMB!

Okay. Tons of hype over this place - so I decided to check it out. First off, the parking was really annoying. Even though the lot was empty, we had to valet. The parking attendant was this young guy that was too busy shooting the shit with a waitress that was on break. Second, the servers was standing around behind the counter. We sat down and they almost seemed reluctant to ... serve. They just wanted to stand around and chit-chat while wearing their matching t-shirts. Lame. Third and probably the most important point -- the burger sucked. I ordered the Umami Burger it was sooooooo rare that it was bloody. It didn't come with fries, so I had to order some on the side - and they were horrible. The burger itself was pretty much sitting alone on a large plate. I had to lift the bun because I wasn't sure what all the hype was about. Ugh.. I'm getting annoyed just thinking about that $10 burger and the horrible service that I don't even feel like finishing this review. What a waste. I could have bought 10+ In-N-Out burgers with that money.

I had to see what the hype of this burger place was because I've heard that OBO is a better burger place, but still I had to try it for myself. Umami has small yet filling burgers. Don't let the size of that sucker fool you. I had ordered the umami burger and my fiance ordered the truffle burger. Both good, tender, but their house pickled dish was interesting. Definitely had that umami taste, but I wouldn't recommend getting it. my overall opinion? good, but i've had better.

Calm down everyone. It's not that awesome. The burgers are really good... tried three of them. But everything else was lame. I saw some people get the pickles -- man I would have been pissed if I paid three bucks for a few slices of pickle. It's a freaking condiment for goodness sake. And you don't even need all your fingers to count the fries in one order. Is this the Weight Watcher's menu? Can we get some more fries please? Potatoes are cheap! And the space is terrible -- on a busy night, you might think it's a night club with the all the people standing outside trying to get in. There's like 5 tables in there and 5 parking spaces. Tips: If there's no parking, then just keep on driving. You can come back in a couple months when the hype dies.

****HOW TO GET FREE SWEET POTATO FRIES AT UMAMI BURGER!!**** STEP 1:  Phone in your order and be sure to add the Sweet Potato Fries (I got my burger with lettuce wrap, no buns) STEP 2:  Get in your car, go pick it up, pay $15.37 (for a burger and fries), get back in your car and go home. STEP 3:  Once home, open your bag and pull out the dripping wax paper that is wrapped around your 6oz burger.  Open the wax paper and find your burger to be wrapped with a single thin piece of lettuce and zero toppings (yup, no tomato, mushrooms, ketchup, onions...NOTHING).  Just a plain burger with a piece of dripping lettuce.   Step 4:  Curse Step 5:  Call Umami burger to tell them what happened.  Let them tell you to come back and they'll "make it right."  Hint:  Leave the fries at home!! Step 6:  Get back in your car and drive to Umami burger. Step 7:  Take your burger to the counter and have them hand you a new one.  Then they'll say to you, "Alright man, you're all set to go!!" Step 8:  ASK FOR A REFUND.   Step 9:  Let the worker SNATCH THE BAG right out of your hands and tell you, "Um...sure...where's your receipt?"   Step 10:  Wait for your refund receipt and walk out without a burger.  BUT....YOU HAVE FREE SWEET POTATO FRIES WAITING FOR YOU AT HOME!!!  YAY!   Dear Umami Burger, Maybe next time you ask a customer to actually return back to the restaurant to correct an order, you might want to OFFER a refund first thing and then comp the burger.  You may get repeat customers that way...but thats just my humble opinion.  Good luck! *****************BUYER BEWARE!!***************************

I've been here before and try to avoid coming here despite the publicity and the "good food".  I hate to be forced to Valet park. When we went to get a table, they thought it would be a fun idea to sit us in the only table in the back room, right at butt level of the other patrons sitting in the room at the bar on the side.  The table wasn't to our liking in the already walk-in closet of a burger joint.  So instead preparing another empty table for us, there were 3. She proceeded to sit 2 other parties then come back to us. We were already over it, so we left. The energy in the place wasn't friendly, nor was the staff.  Not going back unless they have a big parking lot and smiles when I walk in there. HA! that won't ever happen.

4th time back! My visits seem to be spaced out enough where every time I return, it's like I'm back for the first time again. Had dinner with a friend at about 7pmish on a Thursday night--no problems getting a table or getting great service. The burger was just as amazing as I remembered it, still better than any other burger joint I've been to thus far, INCLUDING FATHER'S OFFICE. That's right, lynch me if you want you FO lovers. 1st time here: Truffle Burger 2nd time here: Umami Burger 3rd time here: Manly Burger This time: Port & Stilton Burger It was A-MAZING. I hate blue cheese! And blue cheese is a main ingredient in this burger. I repeat, I HATE blue cheese and this burger was amazing. Hmm, come to think of it, maybe I actually LOVE blue cheese and just never had good blue cheese. The Casablanca Burger my friend ordered was good too and slightly sweet. Also got the classic tempura battered onion rings, which I always get in place of the fries since I've come to accept the fact that I think their fries aren't tasty/salted enough, which I was denying for the longest time. Can't wait for trip number 5!

Unummie. 4.5 stars, but I rounded up due to its truly unique flavor! This place is pretty small and quaint.  Luckily there was no wait for us to be seated.  This place has a small menu, but it's items are packed w/flavor.  Don't forget to check out their specials menu propped outside.  When we went there were cheesy tots, ahi burger, something curry, and lamb. Being a noob, I had to fight the urge to try the other tempting burgers on the menu to try their original Umami burger.  My friends of course are awesome and we decide to order a whole bunch of sides to try out.  We had the tempura onion rings (good concept, I'm just not an onion ring nut), skinny fries (tasty, normal fries), sweet potato fries (sweet w/lots of brown sugar, not bad but also not a sweet potato nut), cheesy tots (huge, crunchy n good, could use some more cheesy goodness though!  Gooey would be key) Now onto the main event:  I'm at a loss to describe this burger's taste.. named rightfully so, the umami burger is a different flavor that's hard to explain.. you can definitely taste the mushroom they put between the buns, you can taste the sauteed onions and sweet stewed tomatoes, you can taste that amazing disc of overcooked cheese (love!).  They don't muddle the flavor up w/raw onions, lettuce or tomatoes, so all you taste is juicy flavor.  The meat's cooked medium raw (beware, it is red in the center) which I don't mind at all.  Great texture, nice and juicy.  Truly unlike any flavor you've experienced before!  The bun is puffy and good as well.   While some people do complain the burger's a little on the smalls side, I think based on its strong, unique flavor, my taste buds were overwhelmed after awhile and I felt the last bite was a good ending to the experience.. didn't need more burger for myself.  Honestly, it was a little on the sweet side and that was too much after awhile.. I wonder if I could ask them to hold off on the sweet tomatoes next time.. You get a side dip and I chose garlic aioli.. which wasn't very strong.. I think it was too much mayo Lemonade (not shown on menu) is a must have!! So delicious and refreshing and free refills!  There's also beer on the menu but I really didn't want a strong tasting drink cause I wanted my taste buds solely focused on the burger.   Wait time, there was definitely some of that going on.  Had to flag a waiter down to get a refill of lemonade.  Cups are awesome, you'll see what I mean when you come visit. Notes:  There can be a wait, there's $2.50 valet

I have to give a special thanks to the wonderful company I had the pleasure of dining with this night (Melissa G., her friend Shaun, Ron, Linden and Amy K). This was my first dining experience at Umami and it was truly an exceptional and memorable one.   Food consumed: Fries ~ I'm a shoestring fries kinda girl but your aioli paste is wonderful.  ~ Replaceable. Truffle Burger - with truffle cheese and truffle glaze.  Perfect in everyway, the truffle oil wasn't too overpowering, yet the taste lingered in my mouth for just a little bit longer..I'm in love. Port & Stilton Burger - with blue cheese and port-caramelized onions.  Came so close to being my favorite burger of the night.  The strong and rich flavor of blue cheese and port made this absolutely delicious and intense.  I'm in love.   Hatch Burger - with 4 types of green chiles.  Hot..Spicy..and Juicy...what more can you want from a coveted piece of meat.  I'm in love. Manly Burger - with bacon lardons and aged cheese.  This was succulent and memorable...Calling all carnivores...MANLY! (period)!!!  I'm in love. Lobster Burger - My #1 favorite burger of the night.  A great burger to end your night with...two words...DIVINE BUTTERNESS... Whoever says they don't like Ho's and Ding Dongs in their mouth is lying!! The Cake Monkeys were a delight ~ Ho Ho's, Raspberry Red Velvet Ding Dongs, and Peanut Butter Ding Dongs...~~~Dreamy. I still think of UMAMI...and their creative twist in their burgers...I can't wait to come back...I now understand that frenzy that is Umami.  I love you. **quick note** The place is quite small...you might have to wait a bit if you do decide to visit.  BYOB!!!

4.5 stars This place is super TINY!! Arrived about 30 minutes before closing, and only one open table.  I would hate to be here during rush hour. Had the famed truffle burger..  Was worried it might come overcooked when the server didn't ask how I wanted it cooked.  I was happy when it arrived medium-rareish pink, and juicy. It was damn good.. but not as good as Father's Office.  Still, better than 25 degrees, and bouches bistro, and others. I'd give it a solid 4.5 stars.   The bun was very soft, and good.  The meat was high quality, and the cheese and sauce gave it good flavor.   One of the best burgers I can remember other than FO. It is something you might crave..!! The fries were thick, and were slightly above average. 3.5 stars here. The cokes are Mexican style, just like Father's Office. 5 stars! Mandatory Valet.  $2 charge, and street parking is pretty hard to find.

Last night we went here after eating a pretty filling dinner. Why? i don't know neither but i was craving for it... I know i liked their burger but i forgot that i only gave them 3 stars. The only thing that sucks is that they close early, we got here around 9:30 and they only allow to go orders. So we just have to get it that way. We got the Umami Burger and Pork Burger. its just freaking good!!! i swear i ate it when i got home even though its cold already its still tastes good!!! Next time i'm coming early!!!

Though most people don't associate burger joints with Japanese food, this restaurant has a few Japanese characteristics.   1. The restaurant is tiny!  (I'm glad we came in the mid-afternoon because during a busy time I'm sure that it would be an excrutiating wait.) 2. The food is very artfully prepared. ( i.e. Everything neatly fits on the bun, which is branded with a "U" for Umami.) I had the namesake Umami burger.  It was definitely interesting: a fried cheese circle instead of a slice of cheese was the biggest distinction. Also a big fan of sugar Coke in a bottle.  I didn't try the fries, but they looked great. I don't know if I'd make a special trip, but next time I'm heading down La Brea, I might stop by.

The first thing you must do before you go to this place is throw stinginess and conventionalism out the window.  If you don't, you'll constantly have thoughts of "what the hell is this?"  Umami is a little pricey and kinda fruity.  So get ready for a burger experience that's a little different, and dare I say gourmet. IT'S A SIT DOWN RESTAURANT That's right, it's not a burger joint, but a burger restaurant.  Waiters, menus, and clean tables.  very unorthodox. THE PARKING LOT IS VALET ONLY What the fuck?!  Although the parking lot might be able to hold 8 cars or so, you have to pay $2 to have some loser park your car.  I'm thinking it's because the valet double parks the cars so you don't have to worry about waiting for a spot.  It's still lame. THE PLACE IS TINY Better not come here when it's busy because there's only a handful of tables, and a lot of people come by.  It's not a good idea to have more than 4 people.  Although the place is small, it's not cramped. THE FOOD IS A LITTLE PRICEY The burgers start at $9 and they are similar in size to a fatburger with thicker bun.  $3 for 9 french fries (steak fries) stacked jenga style (that's what I meant by fruity).  Another $3 bucks for a small drink that doesn't get refills.  Add tax, tip, and parking, and you're walking out about $20+ down for a freaking burger.  One nice thing is that they give an assortment of pickles for free (if they're not, then my friends are sneaky bastards).  It was my first time having a mushroom pickle. THEY HAVE A SECRET MENU Unless you ask, they won't tell.  The secret stuff is usually better than what's on the menu.  For example, they have a bacon and cheese burger and iced green tea with freshly squeezed watermelon juice.  So definitely ask what they have off the menu. EVERYTHING IS VERY DAMN TASTY Fear not, whatever it is you order, you'll get your money's worth.  Can't find a six dollar burger that tastes this good.  The bun has taste, and is crispy inside, and the meat is fresh, and cooked well.  Whatever else is in the burger, it doesn't matter, it'll be good.  What I don't like is that the bun might get a little soggy if you eat it too slow.  Even the fries are pretty awesome.  They're steak fries with a crispy outside.  I never had fries like that.  Ask for their garlic sauce, it makes the fries taste that much better.  Honestly, if you can't decide on what you want, just close your eyes and point to a damn burger. THE FOOD IS GREASY AS SHIT A great solution for this is eating the free pickles.  The only thing that I didn't like was the onion rings.  They are ridiculously greasy, and not very flavorful.  You can actually see oil dripping off them.  In the end, you will have some fucking shiny hands.  Might as well take shots of wesson. GREAT PLACE TO BRING A DATE It's quaint, super clean, and very designer looking.  Umami is the perfect excuse to get a burger on a date.  Tip from the master, face the girl inward, and not towards the window.  The view outside sucks and she'll think the environment inside is pretty.  It'll keep her in a good mood (assuming you're not a weird dork much like myself).  Probably won't get you laid, but it's better having a satisfied girl than adding a bitch who just downed a tub of lard to that $40 burger tab. If you want to frivolously spend a little cash on burgers, this is the place to be.  If the burgers tasted ordinary, not good or bad, but ordinary, this place would only get a single star.  Everything about this place seems kinda weird or disappointing for a burger place, but the shit is delicious son!   If you're still reading this, there's better things to do, like typing long ass reviews on yelp.

In the US economy, there are two types of people: the winners and the losers. That's capitalism. At Umami, everyone deserves a good burger, fries and decent service. We each pay the same amount, don't we? Everyone puts in the same amount and everyone walks out happy, the way society should be. Seems that so far, people have been pleased with this burger utopia joint, thus the hype and rising fame. Well, I don't think so. The guy at the front listing names has to work on his attitude. And eyesight. He called our name once. We responded. We walked towards him. He yelled again. As we approached him. "Does anyone have a group of 3 that wants to..." "Hello, we're here. We're standing right in front of you." "Oh, you need to be faster." Yea, uh huh. "You need better eyes." He sat us in the small room, at the bar. Ok, we'll do that. The table behind us had just left and were setting it up for a group of 3. We hadn't even been greeted by a waiter yet so we asked if we could move to it. "Nope. Another group is coming in." WHAT THE. Why not us? And 3 big dudes come walking in. Ok, I'll let it slide since they probably won't fit at the bar. The seats are really high up and fat thighs won't fit. We ordered our burgers and because we didn't want to face the ugly brown wall, we turned our backs watching the big dudes settle down and talk about the burgers they wanted. 15 minutes later, they ordered. Try fitting a group of 3 at a bar; it's really hard to talk to each other especially with so much background noise and 3 loud dudes loudly talking about their pets. We basically had to play telephone to carry on a decent conversation. My sister played a good middle woman. 30 minutes later, the waiter brings out potato hash brown balls for the 3 dudes. Meanwhile, I'm thinking "What about our onion rings and fries?" But no biggie, maybe their balls take less time to cook. 45 minutes later, the waiter brings out 3 great looking burgers. We move our chairs aside so he could get through. But he plops them right in front of the 3 dudes. WHAT THE. I've never been so blatantly treated as a 2nd class citizen before. Right before my eyes. In the land of freedom and equal opportunity for all and pursuit of happiness! Where I'm dishing out $40 for burgers!! BURGERS! My sister goes up and asks, "Where are our burgers? We ordered about 15 minutes before that other table." "We'll check on it." 2 seconds later, they bring out everything. As if they've been holding out on us until we complained. "All burgers are cooked medium rare" is what it says on the menu. All of our were pretty well, no juiciness. Still, we ate without complaining. They're good burgers, no doubt. The garlic aioli sauce is really good. The sweet potato fries with cinnamon are the best I've fried. But those memories won't stick. Oh, are there mushrooms in the Umami burger? Because one had mushrooms and the other didn't. And they're supposed to bring out the dip in cute Asian spoons. Ours came out in ugly plastic things. And never once did they ask if we needed extra water or anything. We waited 10 minutes to get the check and didn't get it. We decided to walk over to the counter to pay. My sister and I left the restaurant; her bf stayed back to pay. "How was your experience?" "It tasted good." Yea, it tastes good but that's about it. We could've played dine and ditch, but that would be illegal. But discrimination is illegal, or at least it should be. Work on caring for people please. As my friend says "fatties," whether truly fat or not, "deserve a chance too."

There is really no point in reviewing a place with over a thousand reviews, but I've done it before and now I'm going to do it again. Umami Burger has been on my "must eat" list for a while, and unfortunately my first experience here left me unimpressed. An expensive veggie burger I can handle, and having to order fries separately is not too shocking, but small portions and lackluster service in combination with those things is pretty disappointing. Our waiter seemed way more interested in being laid-back and charming than in being effective. Food didn't come out on time for everyone and nothing was said about that. Orders were forgotten and nothing was mentioned. For a meal that was supposed to impress me and make me forsake all over burger joints, this place was a disappointment. My omnivore friends were equally unenthusiastic about our experience, which was a shame because they were also excited about finally trying this place out. We agree: this place has nothing on The Counter.

Like others, I really wanted to love the fare here. While there's no denying the great flavors that burst forth from my Truffle burger, there was also no denying the greasy oiliness, too. Drip, drip, drip -- all over my fingers and plate. While tasty, every bite was so grease-laden, something that didn't sit well with my stomach after the meal at all, ugh. Was the bun sprayed down with oil, too?  I felt the kind of gross you can only feel if one chugged a quart of Mazola. It might have helped to offer some greens/lettuce and tomato to help cut the richness of the burger but it was just slick meat and slick bun. I can understand and appreciate the concept of elevating this lowkey American staple into a fancier version of itself with some unique flavor twists, but at $9-$11 a burger and $3 for a side of fries and just one free condiment -- it's a bit insulting when you have to pay $2 to park too. Like, really? I don't mind paying for great food, but this time, didn't feel the meal justified the near $40 tab. Glad I got to try it -- again, enjoyed the flavors (the guy liked his Hatch burger with the four kinds of chilies, though it didn't pack much heat at all) ... and the onion rings were OK, as were the very scant but pretty steak fries. But factor in all the grease & the tab and we probably won't be back.

Multiple reasons why Umami Burger failed to impress: 1) limited seating.. this place is tiny! which also means, 2) ONE co-ed bathroom.. how inconvenient 3) our server informed us that the burgers here are cooked only medium rare or medium well. WHAT?? I asked if there was any way they could cook it just *medium* and he straight up said no with a stern look on his face. I personally don't like bloody burgers (although pink is fine! just not dripping in blood) so we opted for medium well.. 4) our truffle burger (which was honestly the size of my palm) was CHARRED to practically well done. refer to picture. 5) sweet potato fries were sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar.. and served with their Umami ketchup. SPF = thumbs down. Umami ketchup = thumbs up. Finally they got something right. 6) total bill for ONE burger and ONE order of fries plus tip = $20. epic FAIL.

One word. Yum! Ok..I have a few more words than that. This place has awesome flavor. It isn't heavy or greasy, but is just right. I've tried the Umami and Manly burger. The bread, the meat and the toppings were great. The quality was superb. I also had the cherry pie with cheese in the crust. Which, sounds weird, but it was perfect. It had a tart center and sweet crust. On top of the great food. The service was good and the atmosphere was right up my alley. And to top it off, the price is reasonable.

The burgers were tasty but small.  The sodas were sweet made with pure cane sugar. The fries were so and the onion rings were a little soggy.  Service was so so-no water refills and more concerned with socializing than customer service. So why 2 stars...for 10 bucks, I expect a much more substantial burger.  The taste of my manly burger was unique and tasty but for 10 bucks I expect a MANLY burger.  These burgers are oversized gourmet sliders.  We tried both the thick cut steak fries and the skinny fries.  The thick fries were mushy while the shoestrings tasted ore-ida.  For what they charge, these should be fresh cut fries cooked to perfection. Bottom line...if you like frou-frou burgers, go here and spend $40 on 2 burgers, fries, and soda..plus tip.  Me-I'll take  In n Out.

Been hearing good things and wanting to check this place out, but it took an invitation from an old friend to prompt my visit tonight after work. Definitely worth the wait. The burger was top-notch, the tempura onion rings every bit as good as I'd heard, and my friend's sweet potato fries have rivaled the best I've eaten. People say the portions aren't huge but honestly, I'm a 210 lb. male and it filled me up. It's not like a triple-triple at In-N-Out, but do you really need two lbs. of sandwich? I think not. Smaller location, so come early or wait half an hour like we did.

We ordered several burgers and shared, but the only one I feel the need to write about is the truffle burger.  The seasoning is definitely tasty and the bread is delicious, but it's the truffle oil that makes all the difference.  Yummm ... They also have really good cheddar tater tots and iced green tea.  It's very rare that someone writes about something as basic as iced tea, but this one was definitely worth mentioning - not too sweet or strong.

My first time at Umami and it's to go =( At least now I know it's very good and can come back =P Umami Burger - There is no description on the menu but this thing is delicious! Get it!

I loved the service here, everyone who worked here was actually friendly and helpful. In fact, I was kind of surprised by that! Anyways, the only thing I really disliked about this place was the RULES. 1. You cannot add anything to any burger, only subtract, and no substitutions. 2. They can only split the bill on two cards 3. You only get 1 condiment per order Other than that (rules that I can understand, but we are just used to getting our way) the burgers here are pretty tasty, living up to their "umami" name. The favorite all around was the umami burger, followed by the truffle burger. I had the earth burger (vegetarian), which everyone thought tasted more meaty than the actual burgers! The ricotta cheese added a creaminess to the overall taste, and the truffle oil made my mouth salivate every time the burger came close to my nose. The best part about their burgers was the BUN. It was pillowly soft, light and eggy...complimented the rest of the burger perfectly. Fries were OK, the house fries were way too big, which did not allow them to be cooked to perfection. They were basically huge chunks of potato, and tasted like it too. The thin fries were decent, the right size and cooked so that they were crunchy on the outside and soft inside. Paired with the garlic aioli or jalapeno ranch, they were quite tasty. The house ketchup didn't make me do any dances, but it was good. The house dressing had a cucumber taste, and it was a lot less rich than I anticipated, since it basically looked like thousand island. I actually liked the onion rings a lot too. Yes, they were a little greasy, but the tempura batter in lieu of the usual onion ring batter was perfect. It gave the rings a light crunch, and the overall effect was a much less heavy onion ring. Yummilicious Factor = A-

First of all YAY!!!!! for dependably good burgers!!!  And yay for winning boyfriend's approval!! He is no longer a Umami virgin and is LOVING IT!!! (as you can see from the pictures, will will be posted soon). But I must say... booooo on reducing the size of your hand-cut fries. =( Seriously, I have pretty short fingers and all of the hand-cut fries were shorter than my fingers.  That, and they don't do the cool jenga-block stack with them anymore... probably because the fries are so short.  But, they are still super crispy for being such thick cut fries, and it's almost like eating the lovechild between french fries and tater tots. Mmm tater tots... Still a good treat once in a while, and the service is very attentive, but I might try other Umami's next time.

A group of us came here for a farewell dinner for one of my close coworkers who was moving away, and I wish I could recall it as an awesome fete with an abundance of great food and drinks to cap off some great relationships, but there was definitely an atmosphere of extreme lacking at this venue. You can see that everyone has major reservations about the tiny size of these burgers, which is a completely valid and supportable reason for not liking this place, but at the heart of it, I just don't like going to dinner at a place where I'm going to hear repeatedly the word "can't" or "We charge extra for that." It just puts a bad taste in your mouth before you chomp into your 4-bite-max burger. Other than the measly portions and lack of sides to the burgers, the taste was extremely unimpressive too. I had the manly burger with cheese and bacon on it, and I left Umami with some disappointed taste buds. For one thing, the burger was just extremely dry. Second, HOW DO YOU MESS UP A BURGER WITH BACON IN IT??? Their motto apparently is, "Just so you know...we grind all our own meat, process our own cheese, and pickle our own veggies...because we care." So why doesn't it taste like you care?? And why won't you give me ketchup for free if you care about your customers so much?! I'd give three stars for just being "meh," but I'm docking another star for overcharging.

I suppose I'm in the minority here but I'm not terribly impressed by Umami. My mom and I were on our way home from Union Station (she likes the train, go figure) and in a hurry to get back to the West Side, so I suggested we take out. She'd been blown away by Umami when she first went there and had been insisting I try it. My mom's natural tendency is to LOVE a place upon first visit, like it the second time, then never want to go there again after the third. It's a rare restaurant that makes it past the 3rd visit with Mumsy. Anyway, this was time #2 for her at Umami. True to form, the shine's off the apple - and it's no wonder from where I stand. Walked in there and immediately felt NOT at home. The host guy behind the register and then the waitress kind of looked at us like we were from Mars - perhaps thinking we may have been, gulp, romantically involved (Ugh! No Oedipus I!) but whatever. The ambiance is pretty much nil other than the particularly nice shades that covered the late afternoon windows, oh, and the fact that the forks are placed at an ANGLE on the napkins (super nice touch, Umami!). So we sat there and waited for our food: $30 for two burgers, fries and onion rings. I'll mention that again: $30 for two burgers, fries and onion rings. One more time: $30 for two burgers, fries and onion rings. WTF!!???? My mom insisted it was worth it for this "delicate" and "scrumptious" experience. Right. Well, I bid farewell to the waitress, whom I tipped $3 for handing me a bag (she did not respond, by the way) and we left. Got home and opened things up. There were 12 French fries and 9 onion rings. Again, this time with particulars: $30 for two burgers, 12 fries and 9 onion rings. The burger I'd ordered (Truffle Burger) was about the size, bunwise, of a regular McDonald's hamburger. I must say that there was a goodly amount of meat between the two buns. Chaw #1 of my Truffle Burger ($11) yielded an explosion of flavor: Yes, delicate and, indeed, scrumptious, but this meat had more than just a few serious and important pieces of gristle in it, necessitating several finger trips to the mouth. The taste, to be fair, was quite engaging, but over all too soon. This is a five-bite burger, max. I can think of many, many a-burger around town that is just as good and lasts twice as long in the eating. Umami's much vaunted catsup, for which one has to PAY after a single, precious allotment plopped in a super fancy plastic container much akin to a dentist's rinse cup, had a flavor I did not like to it, so, being only steps from Mom's well-appointed fridge, I trotted out the old, reliable Heinz. The French fires, though very thick - the way I like 'em - were not even good. Hard to put my (then) greasy (for grease is Umami's strong point) finger on it, I just did not care for them. The one shining moment of the meal, once I made the catsup adjustment, was the onion rings. These are terrific and lend themselves, in character, more towards the tempura-esque than to traditional, California-style onion rings: light, crispy (but not TOO crispy) without a hint of the bread crumb filler that less imaginative onion ring purveyors rely upon. Quite delightful! And not worth the $30 spent. I'd have given the place 3 stars but the waitress did not say good-bye and her male counterpart there bore an expression just this side of contempt. My mother and I are not slovenly bum-asses bent on kyping a free repast. We are über presentable and eat at the finest restaurants in town, nearly always being taken care of and, at times, fawned over, by professional and/or alacritous staffs. What's with THESE hipsters? Yeah, all right, so they're lucky enough (for now) to work at a new, hot restaurant (see the L.A. Times dribble all over its slowly rotting corpse in praise). This is NO reason for the rudeness and, perhaps even, disdain. Wait a few months and Umami will have been cast aside like other "enduring L.A. favorites" that have been left at low tide at the capricious whim of Tinsel Town diners. By my count, there are 338 burgers that are every bit as good as those found at Umami and all but 3 of them cost far less than $11 a burger. I'm sure there's one near you.

yo this place is wack! I don't mind waiting half an hour for good food but this is why this place is getting 1 star from me and i'm clicking NO waiter service for a reason: my cousins and i waited and decided to check this place out. keep in mind there are 4 of us. i specifically ordered the umami burger and a side of onion rings so one of my cousins tells the waiter "i'll have the same". when the food comes out, we're short one burger and 2 side orders of onion rings. i ask the waiter to repeat what he wrote down and he's looking at me like why?? we realize that the waiter thinks he's going to share with me?? does anyone else think "i'll have the same" means i'll be sharing with the last person's order? retarded.... the waiter tries to play it off and tells my cousin that he's going to bring it right out. my cousin tells him that if it's going to take another 40 minutes just to get a burger, then to forget about it. this guy comes back at him with an attitude "no it's not going to take 40 MINUTES! i'll fire it up right now..." basically he's going to take someone else's umami burger and bring that out to cover his behind. well...the burger comes out alive...literally uncooked in the center. fed up with the service, my cousin decides not to eat anymore and the rest of us decide not to come back. finally he attempts to make things all better by saying "dessert is on me". we don't want your f*@!'n desserts man...to add insult to injury, they added an extra burger on our bill which was over $65 freakin dollars!!! may i add that the burgers were the size of mcdonald's double cheeseburger?? NEVER GOIN BACK...PEACE UMAMI...u guys are wack...

This is your destination if you're looking for juicy, finely chopped meats, great toppings and awesome sauce burger. I may not be a big fan of burger, but the burger meat was so fine that it didn't feel heavy at all. I went with some peeps who left out for their first Umami trip, this definitely made up for it!!! The server were kind enough to let us know that they only have 3 fries left, so we can place the order before anyone else takes it. Ouh yes, the fries, heavenly, I'm telling you, I dunno how they cooked this, but fries hardly tasted this good when it's cooked so big (each fries portion is those giant ones). Yumm.... It's BYOB and my friends took with them some wines, however, I still don't quite get it why we got charged corkage fee, I wonder. I ordered Mexican coke, okay the sweetness I have to agree not the same as the regular coke here. I like the Mexicoke a Lot, of course it's a little pricey compared to the Mexicoke that you pay at the taco truck. We were in quite a big group so they put us like in this one corner where they have bar table and 1 square table in the middle. It's just perfect, maybe they accomodate us so well cause we're yelper, I wonder about that too. Overall verdict, always ask for their specials, that time, there's manly burger, everyone who ordered loves it, I ordered Umami burger, I luv everything, except the fact that I think the mushroom doesn't belong there at all... the Gals love the Socal burger and I think the only complain  was only from Truffle burger as the truffle wasn't put enuf into that burger. Parking definitely hectic, place is small, there's a valet, but again the valet spots are so small too. I would suggest not to come in the big crowd as the place is quite tiny. In the end, I can simply just say, the burgers rock!!!

I always wondered when a place is located mid-city, do they give it to West LA or East LA?  I guess it general it doesn't matter, but since Yelp is broken up like that, I wonder who get to claim Umami on La Brea.  And this is not the kid picked last, instead this is one of the top picks for teams.  If there was a "food draft" for West LA and East LA, Umami definitely deserves to be one of the top picks for either side. Overall, I think the taste lived up to the hype.  Umami Burger was amazing.... patty for sure was succulent and juicy.  As for the rest of the toppings, all the menu said was x6, and so I have no clue what they were.  But there was this crunchy thing on the burger that was unique and went perfect with the tender taste of the patty.  Definitely enjoyed the food. However!  Location is a pain, Umami is on a main street, and parking in the lot costs $2+.  Otherwise you have to scour the streets.  In addition, its like a sitdown restaurant, so that means additional costs for service, a tip.  And the signature umami burger was $10.  Therefore, for all services rendered, that's a $15 burger... now my friend, its up to you to decide if Umami is worth a taste.

Most overrated burger in Los Angeles. The simple and no-fuss (no substitution) menu is cute at first, but the food doesn't hold up to it's hype-blog reputation and I was left unbelievably unsatisfied. Headed to the La Brea location wanting the holy trinity of a well-made burger, fries, and a drink only to find out that they don't "do alcohol." After our apathetic waiter took our order, I was at least hoping that the food would be decent as this is one of the most talked-about burgers in town. We ordered their hand-cut fries, which definitely did not seem hand-cut at all.Hand-cut by a machine that spits out identically sized pieces, perhaps, but I've definitely had more authentic looking fries at In N Out.  They were starchy and awkward and for the price you pay, you'd think you'd get enough to share. The burgers themselves were downright disappointments. I ordered the :manly" burger, which came out less than medium-rare. I am a medium-well done person, but I understand when a place has a policy to make their burgers medium-medium rare. This however, was a bloody, disgusting mess, and it was difficult for my palate to identify ANY of it's supposedly delicious toppings. For dessert we shared ONE order of Cake Monkey Yo-Hos which was really one yo-ho cut into four tiny pieces. I live next to a Cake Monkey vendor and these little guys should never be priced more than $3, which is why I was appalled to see Umami charge $4.25 for ONE little cake half the size of a normal cupcake. Two burgers, one order of fries, two Mexican bottled cokes, and a dessert clocking in at over $40? WHAT A RIP-OFF! We could have definitely done better but we wanted to see for ourselves. Probably not coming back any time soon. Notes: They accept NO substitutions, they do not serve alcohol, they only have valet parking in their lots, their hostesses are pretentious, seating indoors is tight and a little limited, waiters seem to have a hard time grasping the concept of giving their customers water, and nothing on their menu is listed as being organic, local, or sustainable, which for a newer hipster burger joint, is something I begin to expect.

1. Skip the valet. Read the signs before you park on the street 2. The host will not seat you without complete party 3. First time? Try their Umami burger first. 4. Share the side dish bc they're pretty big. Unless you're in fatty mode. 5. The mustard is spicy- wasabi spicy.

Awesome burgers!!! I was a bit worried coming here after hearing about bad service but in my experience, we had great food and great service! Arriving here, we put our name down and they told us it would be about a 25 minute wait for 4 people.  I don't think we waited a full 25 minute but it was pretty fast! We were seated and we looked over the menu.  The boyfriend and I already knew what we were going to get! The umami and the manly burger!  Another person in the group got the manly burger and another got the turkey miso burger! We also got one side of the fat fries and the onion rings. Omgoodness! My favorite was the manly burger!!  So deeee-licious!  The little thick chunks of bacon was the perfect touch! Mmmmm goood!!!! The umami burger was good too and the turkey miso was light!  But I'm more of a beef person! The onion rings were so good along with the fries!  We did get the garlic aioli which was meh.  But whatever! The burger! mmmmmm the burger!!!!  The onion rings! MMMM the onion rings!! Definitely a go to place again! Our waters were constantly being refilled when asked. It wasn't hard to get a server at all.  The guy wasn't the friendliest but he wasn't rude either. Mmmmm Manly burger!~

Just a quick update. SERVICE, friendly but not all together efficient.  It takes a really really long time when it is busy.  Do not come here expecting quick service.  Just prepare to wait.  And good luck with the parking lot too.   BUT I STILL LOVE THE BURGERS and SIDES here!  Even got a free dessert for our patience today.   The pork burger, STILL AMAZING AS THE FIRST TIME.  And a new offering since my first time, the MANLY BURGER with beer cheddar, fried onions and lardons.  Delicious.  The triple cooked fries were actually really good and much more plentiful than the first time ordered.  The onion rings were great again as well, with their tempura batter cooked to a perfect crispness.     I am willing to overlook the service hiccups cause your burgers and sides make me go, DAMN, that's GOOD!

I had been cravinggg Umami (and Milk) for quite some time. I had kinda been sick of food and eating (I know I can't believe I just said that either). But I guess I just needed some amazing food to make me want to eat again! I finally decided to switch it up and went for the Truffle Burger and not the Hatch. Wow definitely amazing! Our waitress was super nice and her favourites were the Truffle & Hatch- just like me now! For our side, we got the House Pickles. I expected like 4 pickles, but nope it was a wide variety of different types of pickles including kimchi! I actually really liked it. I'm not a huge fan of the fries/onion rings here, so it was a good side since it was also not as fattening. Granted I didn't keep to the "healthiness" at Umami and I got the Coffee Toffee Milk macaron sandwich. Sad they ran out of Cookies & Cream! I feel like they always do when I'm here :(

I just walked out of Umami Burger. I was by myself and they sat me at the "bar-" a depressing dark little cramped room where you sit facing a dark blank wall.  Not my idea of atmosphere, so I walked back out and asked the guy behind the counter if it was okay if I sat outside, and he replied very snottily "I'm helping another customer, I'll be right with you." So I left and no one there seemed to care. I'm tired of these trendy gimmicky places in LA that are so successful they feel like they can treat their customers as if they are lucky to be there.  Well, Umami, you should feel lucky to have me because now I'll tell all my friends and all of yelp what jerks you have working there. For my money, I'll go somewhere without the attitude.

I have absolutely no complaints. We were promptly seated and served, the chef seated us and the two other wait staff were very nice and polite. I ordered the Port and Stilton burger, which had carmelized onions and bleu cheese crumbles. It was a bit rare, but absolutely delicious.  Perfectly portioned, I actually finished the whole thing and was comfortably full afterwards. This place is small, and maybe seats about 20-25 including outside.  So if you're here on a busy day, be prepared to wait for your food.

I came to Umami kicking and screaming, I wanted to go somewhere else but my boyfriend and I compromised and came here instead. I hoped that I would hate this place and therefore get the green light to give my boyfriend shit about it. But instead I LOVED IT!!! Honestly this is my new favorite burger place. Umami is rather small with six-seven tables in the main dining room. It gets a bit crowded at times but I think this is what makes Umami charming. We ended up having the SoCal & Manly burger with a side of thick fries and tempura onion rings. Honestly words cannot describe how lip-smacking good my SoCal burger was. I wasn't much of a fan of the Manly burger mainly because it has horseradish. The sides on the other hand were delicious, my favorite was the tempura onion rings, there's something amazing that happens when you soak onion rings in malt liquor and then fry them. But honestly what made my visit even more amazing was our server: who was out of this world hilarious. I walked out amazed by "The fifth taste" and completely in love with my server.

Ever since I started yelping, I always wanted to try UMAMI burger. Did it live up to the hype? Yes, I think so. Is it worth the price? Maybe... My friend and I got the Umami and the Truffle burger and decided to eat half of each. He didn't really like the place, and kept saying that burgers from "The Counter" (Santa Monica) were way better. As for me, I liked it. But I can't imagine how anyone can be picky with burgers...The buns were nice and so was the patty. But the burger itself was pretty empty (no vegetables). I guess that's what makes it unique (Umami style). The fries were pretty good too, and I really liked their ketchup. The portions aren't really that small. I was extremely full after eating a burger and some fries (but I guess it wouldn't be too filling for guys). Nonetheless, you have to try this place. Anywhere with over a 1000 reviews on yelp is a must and you'll always want to try it anyway :)

I really reserve final judgment til they get their act together and have the actual veggie burger on the menu, but the Umami Burger sans-meat was incredibly tasty, the fries are truly fantastic, the onion rings lovely and crunchy, and the pickle platter is unreal.  So many amazing flavors, textures.  It's really a home run.  And Cake Monkey treats!   The day they have their veggie burger on the menu is the next day I'll be there, with a nice bottle in order to take advantage of the BYOB.  Incredibly promising, nicer decor than it needs to be, really friendly and intelligent staff, a little out of the way but definitely worth it.

Second only to the fathers office burger in LA  Umami was the last stop on a food marathon throughout LA a friend and I did one night.  We started with Ethiopian, followed that by pizza, followed that by dessert at MILK, followed by Umami's Casablanca burger.   Umami's best attribute is their bun, it's oily in a good way and melts in your mouth.  It compliments the burger rather then drawing your attention to it.  The meat of the Casablanca was tender and moist as well, but didn't come close to the gaminess of the meat at fathers office.   I also don't like that I can't bring a bottle of wine, and they don't serve wine or beer.  A burger without a good glass of wine or a beer is just not a burger. Maybe they've fixed this as we went over a month ago.

For those of you who are HIMYM fans, remember the episode where Marshall went from joint to joint in search of reuniting with "the best burger" in town, but was disappointed every time? Well...that's slightly how I felt about Umami Burger. Don't get me wrong, it was pretty darn delicious, but...just not exactly what makes me go, "MMMMMMM. We gotta come back here soon!" LOCATION: My friend and I met up after his basketball game on Sunday to check out this Umami epidemic. WARNING: This place is easily missed. A small and quaint burger joint located next to a copy/printing store, I almost didn't recognize Umami if it wasn't for their burger insignia. (The parking lot is only for a few vehicles, so your best bet is to do street parking.)  We got there around 2 and waited about 15 minutes before we were seated. BURGERS: A friend of mine recommended that I try the Pork burger, but while looking at the menu, I was drawn to the SoCal burger for their tomato spread & caramelized onions. My buddy decided to try the signature Umami burger. We traded halves and I was much more content with the Umami burger. The SoCal burger was okay, but just not as tasty and flavorful as the Umami. I liked the SoCal for the delicious caramelized onions, but that was about it. The Umami had a nice thin baked slice of shredded cheese, giving the burger a much more robust zing to it. SIDES: I ordered a side of the hand cut fries while my friend ordered the malt liquor tempura onion rings. The fries were pretty good, thicker than your usual burger joint fries. It was soft and fluffy on the inside and slightly crispy and golden on the outside. I wasn't to keen on the onion rings because they were quite oily (which wasn't very appetizing on top of the already greasy burgers.) Overall, Umami was a good experience. But price and lack of full contentment will force me to keep on looking for the 'best.' *Side note: The burgers are served medium rare.  So if you're not into the red, be sure to make your request!

Holy hell, this is one amazing burger. I split a manly and truffle burger and my goodness, I wanted both of more. They were both amazing, I think I'm going to have to give it to the truffle burger though. The glaze that was on it made it extremely juicy. Yes, that's right. A burger named a manly burger. It seemed like a fancy bacon western cheeseburger. so it was a pretty good thing. But still didn't touch the truffle burger. That was a delicious burger. Both of which were done perfectly. So it helps that they were both made med-rare. Still a little bleeding. Mmmmm mmmm good. They also gave us a couple of samples of side. some churizo aioli that was pretty damn amazing and some garlic aioli that I want to dunk just about everything in. If you're here for the Iced Tea, GTFO. Seriously, if the fact that they're out of Iced Tea when you have the option of drinking Coke Lite or even enjoy a Mexican coke, then you're better off going to Carl's Jr. for the endless refills of the jug of iced tea. I consider HFCS sodas to be a waste. You're getting enough corn in all the different shit you eat every day. No reason to add in corn syrup into your daily intake. If it wasn't for trade embargo's, pure cane sugar makes the world go around. At least other countries. Thank you big corporations and embargos on other countries that make the cost of pure cane sugar so high, but that's the way a soda taste the best. Some would say this is overstepping it, but that's like calling a place pretentious for using 100% whole beef. Some nerve of them for not putting tofu in their burgers!, right? Exactly. You're paying for quality. Even when it comes to the sodas.So I'm thankful that they offer Pure Cane sugar sodas. Coke Lite.. GRAND! The fries were a little thick but then again, they'd have to be to stand up and survive being triple fried. Which did make them very tasty. Though they were still a little to thick to begin with. So you sort of have to triple fry them.   The onion rings, which are battered in malt liquor.. which I would venture a guess to Colt 45, cause if it was Mad dog 20/20, it would have had some bite, was very light. I mean, they were like biting into air. I enjoyed them though I know some will have a problem with it and it doesn't really taste like it was battered in malt liquor. But who knows. Portion sizes aren't going to thrill most folks. You're not getting a bucket of fries nor are you getting a huge burger. But the meal will fill you up when all is said and done. And if you go with the truffle burger, you will be please with it all. If you want to super size it, go to McDonalds. You're not here for a huge pile of food. You're here for a right amount of food that is made deliciously and is priced pretty ok for what you're getting.

Before I talk about the food, let me gripe about how horrible LA's public transportation is. What takes 15 minutes to drive took me a whole freaking HOUR. Yes, my friend and I actually braved the lousy LA metro bus system to get a taste of LA's famous Umami Burger. Yes, we rode an hour's worth of horrible public transportation just to get a damn burger. And holy cow, it was freaking worth it. I looked it up, and Umami is a Japanese term referring to "a pleasant savoury taste imparted by glutamate, a type of amino acid, and ribonucleotides, including inosinate and guanylate, which occur naturally in many foods including meat, fish, vegetables and dairy products." Huh? Let me simplify it for you: Umami is the freaking amazing 5th sense of taste that makes you salivate like crazy when you chomp on a good savory dish. Think: MSG. Ahhh. And that's exactly the sensation we got when we chomped into our burger. We ordered two burgers and split them both to share. One was the original Umami burger, which had a meaty beef burger, roasted tomato, mushroom, Parmesan chip, caramelized onion, and spread on a toasted Portuguese bun. Umami...x6!!! The other was the Turkey Miso Burger: Turkey burger with Asian BBQ sauce and avocado relish on Portuguese bun. Holy Freaking Sensation! Words cannot describe how amazing these burgers were. Literally, my mouth was watering as it chewed on this burger. I was wondering how the burger cold be so freaking juicy, and it turns out half the juice was from my own saliva! The service was a bit hatter-batter, and all over the place, but I didn't care. The food was seriously amazing. Plus, the servers wore these cute Umami shirt. I want an Umami shirt! I'll definitely, most certainly be back. But until I return again, I shall refrain from all thoughts on Umami. Homer goes "Mmm...Donuts..." and I go "Mmm...Umami...". Okay, okay, I'll stop.

Umami was on my brother's list of places to try on his last visit home, but he almost didn't get to go because he thought he wouldn't have time.  Lucky for him, his older brother refused to let him go back to Chicago without having one of those delicious burgers. The night before his flight, we had dinner w/ our family.  Immediately following that dinner, we called up a friend to go to Umami with us. I ordered the Truffle Burger and my brother got the Port & Stilton.  I forgot what my friend got, but his was my least favorite of the three, so it doesn't really matter.  We also got a side of onion rings and cheesy tots, both of which were good.  I'm just not a fan of any of their condiments. The Truffle Burger was so simple-looking, but it was so good.  The truffle is a bit subtle, but the flavor is just strong enough for you to be able to taste and enjoy it fully.  It doesn't overpower the burger and that's a good thing. I had already tried the Port & Stilton and it was as good this time around as it was last time.   Needless to say, my brother came away a huge fan of Umami.  The burgers are cooked perfectly (medium-rare) and are packed with flavor.  Yes, they're a bit small, especially for the price, but I still think they're worth it. If I had to pick my favorite burger (out of a total of 100), Umami would get 49.99 to Father's Office's 50.01.  It's that close.   4.5 stars

Umami Burger seems well on its way to becoming one of the most overrated burger joints in LA. People, a moment of clarity please. It's a good burger. For the price, it might even be a very good burger. But it's not a great burger. Some elements were very good (cooked tomato). Other elements were not so good (the undercooked Jenga-style french fries). When I met my wife, I forgot about all the other women in the world. Umami Burger, you're OK, but you didn't make me forget about all the other burgers in LA.

4 stars for flavor 3 stars for size I like this place for the flavor, but can't they make it a bit bigger since it cost so much. I was still hungry afterward.

I wanted to like this place, I did.  It's a great concept.  But I've had upscale burgers elsewhere that were just as good. I had the signature burger and found it decent but uninspiring - certainly not worth nearly 10 dollars.  My wife's mushroom burger was a bit better, but again, not all that great.  The So Cal burger we got for our son was inedible to him due to the overpowering Gruyere.  And hey, he's 4 years old, that's not the restaurant's fault, but when I tried it I couldn't blame him.  You couldn't taste anything but the cheese, and it was just strong, not good.  So much for the much-vaunted balance of ingredients. There were other problems as well.  One thing that seems to be a theme with other reviewers is "they were out of stuff."  It must be very common.  Surely it can't be that hard to buy a few more potatoes for Friday and Saturday nights?  In any case, it happened to us as well - they must have gotten down to their last few fries. Now again, hey, these things happen.  But instead of telling us "we're down to the last order of fries, here it is," they split it onto two plates and tried to pretend that four fries each was a full order.  Mind you, we could *plainly see* the big stacks they'd just brought to the table next to us.  It takes some pretty serious gall to charge us for two orders.  I just paid the bill and left, I didn't want to argue it.  But... c'mon.  How stupid do you think your customers are to try to pull an obvious con job like that?  Especially when you're charging 3 dollars extra for the fries in the first place? Although maybe I should have been happy, as the fries weren't all that good.  Triple-fried is great, but how about doing it twice and leaving them in longer each time until they're... y'know, done?  The garlic aioli they brought as a condiment was, sadly, really bad.  It tasted off.  Not quite rancid, but almost.  I had to drink half my Mexican coke to get the taste out of my mouth.  I mean how do you make garlic aioli taste bad? Possibly some of these problems were due to the fact that the kitchen and staff were preoccupied with the next table, who appeared to be friends of the owner, or staff, or whatever.  That's always a good way to keep new customers:  Ignore them in favor of your buddies. Here's the lowdown:  The food is decent, but not worth the price.  And unless they start acting like they want to keep customers, Umami Burger is shortly not going to have any.   Frankly, save yourself the money and hassle, and just go to your local In-N-Out.  You'll get a tastier burger for a quarter of the price.

Oh just thinking about this place is starting to make my mouth water. The staff is super nice and knowledgable about the menu. I went to this spot with my boyfried for dinner a while ago and it left quite an impression on me. I even took my mother there for on mothers day for lunch because we had been at LACMA on the miracle mile all morning and were looking for something good and not outrageously crowded. +One million gold stars! It was just like I remembered it. The burgers are magnefic *kiss my enclosed fingers* The meat is tender and juicy and their in house condiments are palatable. I've had the umami burger and the truffle burger, the fries and the onion rings. Each item was equally as tasty as the others. The prices are a little more then your average charbroiled patty they range from $12-$17 each but you get what you pay for and I have no complaints. At each table they even provide you with a tablet with the digital version of their menu on it and you can even play games on it with who ever you come with. Yay for games! (only first game is free so choose wisely or pay $1.99 for more games) So yes if you haven't tried it by all means get yourself some Umami! Major nom factor! The only reason that I gave it one less star then perfect is because the location does not have free parking. I'm like what?! Valet for such a ridiculously tiny spot and the street parking has a lot of time restrictions to avoid tickets. No surprise in LA but then all the more reason for their lot to be free no?!

It's been years since we've gone out to eat on Valentine's Day weekend: long waits, high prices and less than ideal results have always kept us away but this year we were already out with friends and far from home so we decided a hamburger joint, even a gourmet one, would be a decent choice on Cupid's big day. Turns out it was a good decision. It's not a date place so there were no rose vendors or slurpy couples to ignore. There is certainly a proliferation of high class burger palaces these days, and in some ways most are quite similar. Umami has a number of variations to choose from which is a nice change of pace from the dictatorship at Nazi regimes such as Father's Office. It wouldn't mean much if they didn't pass muster, but each of the four versions we tried were different and good. They aren't quite as perfect as the Father's Office version, although the Umami burger is close, but the variety makes them each worthwhile and delightfully different. The Hatch burger with four green chilis is tasty, although not nearly as spicy as one would think. In fact it's not spicy at all, which may disappoint some. The Manly burger was fittingly titled, and although each of the burgers is on the smaller side, it's quite filling and had substantial flavor. We also tried a turkey version that was much better than it sounded, while it was my least favorite it was different and had an interesting texture. The Umami burger is the signature dish, and was the best. Nothing like Father's Office but equally good in it's own right. Favorite of the bunch. There are many complaints regarding the fries and onion rings, so we were mildly surprised that they weren't bad at all. Certainly not the best ever, but serviceable and rounded out the meal nicely. They have Mexican coke here, which for some reason goes well with the burgers and they have some very sweet cupcakes and ice cream bars to end the meal on. Nothing fancy but quite a pleasant place for a quick bite. The service was really nice, they made room for our toddler without complaint and catered to our every need. Decor is minimal but quietly tasteful and there is a nice patio for additional seating. Best Plates: Umami Burger, Hatch Burger, Manly Burger, Mexican Coke Food - A- Ambience - B+ Service - A- Value - A-

Umami Burger sent me into a state of multiple foodgasms and I had a foodie afterglow that lasted for hours.   Parking does suck.  Valet is $2.50.  This place isn't good for groups as I saw a group of 7 try to get in.  The line was long but because it was just the two of us we got in within 6 min.   They serve Coke products in bottles.  We started with the pickle plate that had pickled okra, bread and butter pickles, dill and two others that were really good but I can't think of the names at present.  Then my burger came out with thick salty delish fries.  I ordered the spicy mustard on the side and it had a fantastic wasabi kick to it.  My friend got the pork burger and insisted that we shared by giving each other a half of our burgers.  I was reluctant because my burger was better than his and I'm not a big fan of pork.  The Umami Burger has the salty, sweet, bitter, sour thing going.  The Pork Burger was tasty and had a bit of a taco meat flavor going on.   This burger left me more satisfied than 82% of my past relationships.

Models eat. Well, at least ex-models do. How do I know this? We saw Tyra Banks here. She walked in and said "this time, I'm back with my mom!" I didn't notice her (I have a tendency not to notice celebrities even when they're standing RIGHT NEXT to me and even when we make eye contact) but I did notice the fabulous necklace she was wearing. My bf had to loudly whisper "IS THAT TYRA BANKS SITTING NEXT TO US?" and I had to do the awkward "I'm trying to look at something else" stare and then realized, it was her. The burgers are juicy and delicious (can get a bit messy) and the first time I went, the fries were horrible but they weren't actually too bad this time! I don't know what they do to their burgers but the meat and buns work together so well and makes you want to do a happy dance. Don't go during lunch hour, you'll probably wait too long, get mediocre service, etc. The bf and I usually go on a weekend and we're the only ones there and the service is great.

2.5 stars in my book but I'll round up. I was underwhelmed by this place.  Maybe it's because it had been hyped for so long, or maybe it's because I ordered the triple pork burger instead of beef, but I just wasn't that excited by it.  There three types of pork but you couldn't distinguish between them since they were all ground together into a single patty.  The burger was small the the topping was minimal.  It's not that it tasted bad, it was just OK.  Fries were also OK but nothing to write home about. I don't crave this place the way I crave other burger joints but I'll return if someone else suggests it.

#2 on the Burger Train: Out of all the places I had been hearing about since announcing my plans for the burger blog, Umami is the one that kept popping up in conversation no matter who I was speaking with. My Burger Buddy (BB) Annabella G. and I headed to Umami one evening to put these words to the test. And for the first time in our burger adventure, the hype had lived up to the expectation! AG went for the SoCal Burger, and since I'm a purist at heart, I had the Umami burger. We also split an order of cheesy tots, which no longer appears on the menu but can still be ordered "off the menu". The burger was scrumptious. Perfectly cooked, with the right amount condiments. I'm no food critic, so I can't make these elegant, yet long winded analogies about the lettuce and the onions coming together in perfect harmony, but recognize, son: the burger did just that!! For the first time since I came to LA, I had a burger that I finally felt is worth the heftier price tag that comes with it. Do yourself, and screw those other crappy "IT" burger places that have been popping around the city. Stick with the people who do burgers right! It's all about Umami...and those cheese tots. Parking here is valet, but the lot can fill up pretty quick, especially on a busy night and you do not want to be left to the mercy of street parking around here. The seating inside is limited, and most tables won't fit more than two people, but all of this does not take away from the joyful experience here. Just put down whatever crap sammich or whatever excuse for a burger you were about to eat, and head over to La Brea and educate yourself.

*****NOTE 3.5 STARS ***** After hearing so many  things about this place my bf and I decided to give it a try, my brother kept insisting it was the greatest thing ever. Valet parking here for $2.50, no complaints whatsoever, that's really inexpensive. A host is there to immediately take your names down as she told us the wait would be 10 minutes. There's outdoor seating along side of the windows of the restaurant so we hung out there. Finally called and drinks and orders were taken with suggestions and and explanations given. Our waitress was extremely friend and very attentive with us. Umami Burger - I believe the buns used here were brioche, medium rare cooked patty which is perfect for me, that's how I prefer it, tomatoes, house-made ketchup, parmesan crisp, and shitake mushrooms. The burger was cooked perfect, but personally to me the parmesan crisp just didn't give enough saltiness to the burger. It was good, but not great. Manly Burger - Babes got this, I actually wanted this but I just had to see what the big hype was all about with the umami. This came with I believe also brioche buns, beer-cheese, bacon lardons, & smoked salt onion rings. Now this burger was pretty damn good, I'd definitely come back here for this. Flavors all married together perfect. Patty cooked medium rare to perfection. 3 x Cooked Hand Fries - These were claimed to be triple cooked fries, but to be honest the crisp level wasn't there, larger mini cuts of fries, personally to be it lacked in a flavor a bit and I just wasn't a fan. Tempura Onion Rings - These were good, not great, but my issue with this was by the time the onion rings got to our table, it pretty much went soggy already so I was really disappointed. Overall, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here, okay I lied, maybe for the manly burger and that would be it. I see a lot of complaints about the size of the burger but I personally thought the portion was a good size. I also see people stating that the burgers here are over-priced, I guess people just don't understand the quality put into these burgers. It's not krafts individual cheese slices placed on top with regular buns. If you want to cry about the price then goto the market and make it yourself. Great service but the food was okay.

Next to Copy City on the east side of La Brea. Tiny parking lot. Prefer he Umami Burger over the Truffle burger.  Burgers are better than 8oz, but my #1 gourmet burgers are still 25 Degrees. Prefer the Roasted Garlic Potato Salad over the Hand Cut Fries. p.s. As noted on Thrillist, it's BYOB!

Seriously this place fulfills my craving for meat; just the kind after a 2 hour hike in 95 degree weather and a massive tequila hangover from the night before.

Damn that was a small restaurant! The food takes forever. They only serve soda and water. And I'm not even really a burger person... but this place is pretty freaking AWESOME. Why awesome? they let you BRING YOUR OWN DRINKS:) ...which i wish i knew before i got there!!  I saw this 40 something year old white guy with a 40 ounce!! Which was not only funny to watch, but I was sooo jealous!! Anyway their burgers make anti-burger people like myself forget that i hate burgers. The burgers look small but theyre really filling. My bf got the umami burger & i started eating his burger for him. I got the special burger... like a turkey burger with goat cheese & it was gooooood. The sides kinda suck because they're small & way overpriced!! Also now that I think about it, don't park in that pay lot! there's street parking (metered) on la brea. If I had to sum up my description of this place... it's like a blonde yoga instructor who banged mr miyagi from happy days = umami burger. ta-da!

3.25 stars Came here on a date the other day and had mixed feelings about it overall. The burger I had was the port and stilton, medium rare. It was definitely excellent but kind of fell apart. Umami Burger - you need to apply that old M&M slogan. 'Melts in your mouth, not in your hand!'. My date had the umami burger, which, for the most part, met the extremely high expectations he had for this place. Our onion rings, on the side, with the place's homemade ketchup were not something you write home about. They were kind of large and doughy and just...lacking. And the ketchup tasted oddly of fish sauce. The service, much like the burger, was good but had issues of structure. One person seated us, another took drink orders, and two more came to take our orders. My head was spinning - do they not have sections at this place? The multi-person service continued throughout the meal. In addition, we were read two entirely different dessert lists by two different servers, leaving me to wonder whether the list was some kind of exercise in original oratory or impromptu menu stylings or if only one of them had the 'true' dessert menu. Ahh yes, mysteries abound. Either way, I'll probably be back to see how the other burger options pan out.

Alright, hands down. One of the best burgers in Los Angeles. The fact is that you don't have to add any ketchup, mustard, mayo or aioli to enjoy this delicious melt-in-your-mouth beef patty (which the best buns ever) because the flavor of the meat is so overwhelming (and that's a good thing). Minus one star because sorry, their fries and onion rings are such a disappointment. I love me some tempura batter, but not when you're looking to taste something crispy and salty between bites of a delicious, savory burger. I've never been so disappointed in between burger bites before. Even their homemade ketchup doesn't really help. It just added to the blandness. Also, it's good to arrive RIGHT AT 7PM so you can take advantage of the street parking along La Brea and also beat the dinner crowd by 15 minutes.

I want to give this place a 2.5-3 star. I was REALLY excited about trying this place out (and I probably had really ridiculous expectations) but I was really hoping that Umami Burger would surpass my expectations far and away. Umami Burger offers about 6 burgers, a few sides, and no alcoholic drinks. I ordered the Truffle Burger and the Umami Burger. While the meat was cooked perfectly on both burgers, the person who prepared the dish seemed to have a heavy hand with the salt. At first I thought it was just my truffle burger- but then I tried my friend's burger and it was also really salty. The truffle burger had a really great flavor to it, but the flavor was really inconsistent because of the salt. Also, I think I'm more a veggie type of person. the truffle burger came only with meat, truffle glaze, and truffle cheese. I wished there was something more for a textural difference or more complexity. The burger itself was a bit greasy and the bread got very soggy after a few bites. The Umami burger was VERY salty. the whole burger was just so overpowered by salt, the only saving grace was the shitake mushroom. I swear- I have no idea what Giada was talking about.....she lost a lot of cred from me... We also had a side of their home made fries. These were TERRIBLE. No salt- (surprisingly, right???) and they tasted stale- but I think that just how its supposed to be. Also the ketchup was just ok, so we asked for a side of their garlic aioli (which our server said was "hands down the best side ever") omg. how can one screw up garlic aioli?? It had no garlic flavor AT ALL, and seriously just tasted like mayo (which REALLY pissed me off). Here's my thought about places like Umami Burger. If you're going to offer 10 items ONLY on your menu- you better make damn sure that all those items are impeccable and executed perfectly.  Not only executed perfectly, but the items themselves have to be deliciously sinful. I'm really not quite sure why this place is so popular....I don't think I'll be coming back. And I've decided to give it 2 stars...

Umami burger seems like a nice neighborhood type of joint and I think people are over-hyping it a bit.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed my burger while reminding myself quality over quantity... but when I looked around everyone seemed just as disappointed with their eight fries on their plate.   I think the onion rings are a better bet, with a nice malt tempura taste.  The burger was decent and had a good bun... my burger wasn't rare like the other reviewers, but I tend to like the middle of my paddy to be a lil pink. Their house made ketchup was interesting, it tastes a bit like the Vietnamese beef stew (thit bo kho)... but their garlic aoli was a huge let down especially when we had to wait fifteen minutes for it (we were all pretty much done with our burgers and our fries/onion rings were cold by that time).   I don't think I'll be driving out of my way to come here, but I wouldn't mind dropping by if I was in the area. PROS:  decent burger, cute ambiance, would be a good relatively inexpensive casual date, extra points for the sugar cane soda and no corkage fee CONS: stingy fries/onion rings, garlic aoli tastes and looks like crap

I came here with a friend on a Tuesday night at around 7, so it wasn't crowded at all.  Got parking in the residential area to save on valet service, but it took a while to find a spot. Umami has great decor, and the service was not bad.  The chairs outside are kind of really close to each other, so it's a bit annoying navigating around the maze of people, and having to hear other people's conversations. The food was delicious.  I had the umami burger and my friend had the triple pork burger. The umami burger was composed of a rare beef patty, a crispy cheese slice, mushroom, peppers, onions, ketchup, and a sweet bun.  Delicious, but I am glad that I LOVE rare meat, because otherwise I would have been horrified by the fact that the waitservice did not even ask if I wanted it medium or well-done.  Also there was too much ketchup in the burger, although there were perfect portions of everything else. The triple pork burger was also very good, though the aioli overwhelmed the entire burger, and I could not taste the bacon nor the chorizo.  I personally liked the umami burger more because I love the meaty taste, but I would recommend southern sauce lovers to pick up this one instead. The price was too high for the quality and quantity food I was getting, but overall good experience here.

Seriously, overrated! I ordered the EARTH BURGER despite all the nasty reviews on it. Honestly, I didn't think it was too bad although the patty color did look a bit awkward(see picture). The taste was interesting..it says the patty is made of edamame & mushroom but it didn't hold a distinct taste of either ingredient -- disappointing! I think what really made the burger was the white soy aioli + truffle ricotta. (my favorite veggie burger is still at islands). One of my friends ordered the UMAMI BURGER with the POROBELLO MUSHROOM SUBSTITUTE it looked like a big hot mushy mess that completely fell apart on her -_- SIDE ORDERS: 1.) Skinny Fries: Nothing special here. I'd pick fast food fries like Mcds/in-n-out over these! 2.) Sweet Potato Fries: They were okay..I've definitely had better though. 3.) Onion Rings: We ordered these on a whim due to all the great comments it got on yelp. I was SO DISGUSTED on my first bite. Seriously, avoid these! Every bite is a mouth full of GREASE! I felt so nauseous that i picked off all the batter. CONDIMENTS: Umami Ketchup: It tastes like tomato sauce and ketchup mixed together Jalapeno Ranch: Meh..it was okay..not spicy or anything Garlic Aioli: Best one out of all three! Overall, service was fast and efficient, but the food was only mediocre. P.S: VALET your car for $2.50! It's easier that way.

I'm dropping down my review of Umami for now. This particular location has been disappointing me lately. The past few times I've visited the service has been incredibly slow, whether they are busy or not, the orders have been coming out wrong, and (as I former hostess and server I hate to do this, but) there is one hostess in particular who is incredibly unfriendly. I can forgive a lot of things in the service industry if someone is showing effort and someone is showing compassion. Shit happens. Most of it's not the staff's fault, and I'm one of those people who actually realizes that, but all customer service 101 will tell you to be nice to people. Or at the very least, not straight up rude. Come on.

I'm tethering between a 3 and 3.5 stars, but in any case, worth a visit, but not sure if it's worth repeated visits.   Came here for lunch, right when it opened at 11am.  After reading about the service complaints on yelp, I wanted to avoid it as much as possible, so when my friend and I arrived, we were the only customers there.   I gave the menu a quick glance, but I already knew what I wanted to order.  One $11 Truffle Burger please.  My friend ordered their Umami Burger and we shared a side of Triple Cut fries. The triple cut fries ... you can skip.  They're just steak fries w/ a tablespoon of some sort of ketchup based dipping sauce.  Can you say... rip off?   When my Truffle Burger first came, I immediately thought of the burger at Pie N' Burger in Pasadena.  It was... simple, ordinary and well ...  small, or maybe my plate was just too big.  There was no tomato, no lettuce, just a simple juicy meat between soft buns.  For such a simple burger, the flavor was definitely BIG.  It might be the truffle that gave it such a memorable taste, in any case, it was definitely a flavor that lingered in a way, it makes my taste buds salivate at the memory.

So I'm not a burger fan, ok, but with all the hype about this place I thought it might change my mind. They have a very imaginative palette of taste for burgers I must say, so the average "burger lover" might think this place is awesome but it just didn't do it for me. I ordered the Port & Stilton and expected a shit load of bleu cheese and got a costco sample of cheese. Is this some kind of sick joke? Anyway, the diet coke I got was the size of my thumb and I drank it in almost one gulp. The plus side to this place was that the tempura onion rings were quite heavenly and valet was cheap. My burger was bleeding everywhere and my burger got soggy. I didn't care for it too much but like I said originally, I'm not a burger fanatic. They didn't ask how I wanted my burger so perhaps I should've elaborated a little better? I'm not sure. It was worth a shot.

Sometimes, you look at a girl and realize you can get away with taking her to a monster truck rally, dive bar, or the backseat of your car. Other girls require a night at the theatre, a bottle of vintage wine, and thousand thread count sheets. Some girls throw on a pair of jeans, a sweatshirt, flip flops and are set to go. Others match their socks to their shirt to their underwear to their hair ties before they can check the mail. I'm not saying one type is better than the other, they're just different. The burgers at Umami Burger definitely fall into the latter camp. They're the kind of burgers I have to put a pair of khakis on for. What I'm trying to say is that the burgers here are fancy burgers. I'm not saying these burgers are snooty, inaccessible, or stuck up. No, these burgers can be enjoyed by all in any situation. What I am saying is these burgers are impeccably designed and crafted so that the flavors are balanced and complementary. Ingredients aren't just haphazardly thrown together, it was clear from my first bite of the Umami Burger that great care was put into what I was putting into my mouth. The bun was buttery and sturdy. The patty was full of juicy flavor, topped with sauteed mushrooms, caramelized onions, and a cheese crisp. The cheese crisp added an enjoyable texture contrast to the soft bun and juicy patty as well as a nice saltiness. What really made the burger, I think, was the caramelized onions, with their sweet/savory flavor that went beyond anything I could get out of my onions at home. I also got to try the Umami ketchup, dijon mustard, house spread, and garlic aioli. I tried putting each on my burger and as soon as that aioli hit that meat, it was a done deal. We also ordered up the fries and onion rings which were underwhelming. Next time I will just order a side of burger to go with my burger. The wait to get seated was only about 10 minutes for our party of 2. The reason this place doesn't get 5 stars was the room we were seated in. It was adjacent to the main dining room, was probably a pantry or closet in a past life and, acoustically, reminded me of a bank vault. Talk about an echo. And, when full, I think they cram up to 8 people in there. I'd rather sit outside and listen to the beautiful sounds of La Brea traffic.

Wow, their burgers here are really that good. Great flavors. Their fries ARE NOT worth the $3 price tag. You get 9 short and fat fries stacked like Lincoln Logs on your plate. The onion rings looked amazing though, will get those next time. Not a huge fan of their homemade ketchup, there is something simple and wonderful about good old fashioned heinz. This place was slammed today. The J Gold review brought everyone and their mother out. Food probably took about 20-30 min to come out. They were starting to run out of things so we settled on the umami and triple pork burger. Both were delicious. It's hard to pick a favorite. Their burgers come very rare, if you want it cooked differently be sure to mention it. They don't ask you. They were so busy they had to close up shop so they could restock for the dinner rush. I feel sorry for the couple who walked up as we left. Hopefully they come back and give it another shot.

Yet another joint that I drive past every day to work. Didn't realize how many people have rated this place. They receive three stars for being little bitches with the serving of their fries. I pulled in the parking lot and didn't see any parking spots available. People made their own spots blocking others in and so I followed. as soon as I exited my car, I could've sworn Jackie Chan and his clan surrounded me. Just kidding. One Asian lady approached and I asked If I was blocking her car. She acknowledged me and I told her I would be ordering take out. The place is a bit small. I placed my order, triple pork burger(with Chorizo) and an order of hand cut fries. The fries had been advertised as being triple cooked. During my wait there I took the opp. to take pictures for this review and witness a few exchanges over parking. But hey, this is LA. Ten minutes later, I received my order and they forgot to put my drink inside of the bag. I noticed a big bulge wrapped in paper and a smaller one. I thought, " Did they forget the fries, too?" They assured me they didn't. Check my picture on the disgraceful serving of fries I received for $5.00. The missing drink and the fries cost them some valuable stars, here. I drove a few blocks away to enjoy my meal. I can't even begin to describe my disgust when I opened the package containing my fries. The burger was just outstanding! It was juicy, a little greasy, but just right. Oh, and that Asian lady was just a sweetheart helping me get out of that parking lot disaster. She actually walked onto La Brea Blvd. to make sure I got out safely. She was awesome!

I'm the lucky 360th person to review this joint, so I'm going to tell you about ALL 8 of their current burger offerings, as it seems they change the menu when new ideas pop up.   I was at a Pleasure Palate event and we each got 1/4 of each burger. I put these in order of my arbitrary favorites, although there are only two burgers I would never ask for again. We started with Scallop Fritters which are not on the regular menu, but if they have them when you go GET THEM. 1. Top of the list is the Truffle Burger. The delicate sophisticated flavors blend so well you taste the meat, cheese and toasted bread in all their glory. 2. Umami Burger has a great textural event with a Parmesan crisp. 3. Pork Belly Burger of fresh ground pork and bacon with spicy aioli is one unique great combo not found at any other burger joint. 4. The Hatch Burger might be your favorite with four kinds of green chiles with cheese making love in your mouth. 5. The Manly Burger with cheddar and bacon rises leaps and bounds above the Carl's Jr version. 6. SoCal burger is lacking in umami compared to the other offerings. 7. Port and Stilton Burger is overpowered by the cheese so why have high quality meat if you can't taste it? 8. The Turkey Miso burger is disgusting. One bite was too many. I found the buns to be so delicious.  The fresh ground meat is highlighted by their cooking them medium rare.  If you can only eat your burger well-done, this may not be the place for you. Tempura Onion rings and Hand cut Fries are crispy and tasty but a little too salty for my palate.  I'm also not a fan of Umami Ketchup, but I don't eat anything with ketchup except fish sticks. Skip the Cake Monkey dessert and stop at Ralph's for a box of Yodels. It's the same thing. Valet is only $2 and you can probably find neighborhood parking before 6pm. Sure the burgers are pricier than a fast food joint, but this place has the magical mix of flavors and ambiance that will get me back in the door. PS- the owner says BYOB is still cool if you're sitting on the patio but not in the dining room. PPS - New locations opening soon in Silverlake and Santa Monica

3 and 1/2 stars total for this place?! Are you mofos kidding me? "I ordered the Unicorn burger with chunks of white truffles and a side of french fried black pearls. It was okay... 2 stars because my water glass got below half full and the server's breasts were only a mere B cup as opposed to the elusive 34 D." Man... I know food websites raise the bar for restaurants in general, but have we raised it TOO high, I wonder? Okay, okay. Onto my review. I admit, I am skeptical of places like Umami that have gotten a lot of hype, especially when they require me travel west.  But, last night, Joe D. and I decided, what the hell, we just got paid and we just exercised, so why not give Umami Burger a go? As usual, we bypassed the valet parking for a free spot on the street about 50 yards south. There were Umami employees in the parking lot who greeted us and let us know there'd be a wait of just a couple minutes. They were really cool and in a fun, ball-busting kind of way, not in a super service, plastic smile kind of way. Joe and I were seated within about 5 minutes. What we ordered: - House salad. It was good. No goopy dressing, very fresh greens and tomatoes. - Malt liquor tempura onion rings. Holy balls, these were good. Very flavorful batter, nice and crispy. We dipped them in the garlic aioli. Hot damn! - The classic Umami burger. It came with some toppings on it - I didn't ask, so I'll just tell you, it was damn tasty. We each took a bite and went "Oh wow..." - The pork belly burger. I saved this for last for a reason. This thing was so incredibly rich, juicy, and full of amazing flavors. It was smokey, and porky, with bits of bacon and avocado on top and a slightly spicy sauce inside. Joe's eyes practically rolled back in his head. I can honestly say, this is one of the best things I have ever tasted. - Ice cream sandwiches. The ice cream came between these two soft, thin cookies that reminded me of French macarons. Overall, I was expecting the bill to be a lot higher than it was, and I thought that for being a place that is riding a trend of gourmet burgers, they did what they did very well. I will definitely come back.

The quality of the meat is a 3 maybe even a 4 but the overall experience is a 2. $30 bucks for 2 smallish burgers and a pathethic order of fries is a little ridiculous if you ask me. I think a small fry from mc d's is bigger then theirs!  And that homemade ketchup? Nasty, I think it's just watered down Hunt's. The bun is really good, kinda sweet like a brioche. But it gets soggy from the meat and I don't like my bun to get doughy from the juice. The guy at the counter wasn't exactly friendly, in fact I'd call him downright snatchy. I'd much rather go to Golden State or 8oz burger bar if I want a gourmet burger or Apple Pan for a regular one. Better yet, I'd rather go to Huntington Meats and get Nancy Silverton's ground beef blend and make an outstanding burger at home... I wanted to like Umami, I really did but it just didn't do it for me!

Today I stumbled across Alan Richman's article "Is This The Best Burger In America?" on yahoo.  In the article, our critic goes on raving about the elements of their signature burger, as if to imply it was indeed deserving of that title.  "It's half beef and half beyond belief."  My response to that... it's NOT THE BEST!  It's not even the best in L.A.! Even though the Umami Burger is the not best, it is indeed a great tasting burger.  Thanks to Giada on an old "The Best I Ever Ate" episode... I had to try out this signature burger from Umami.  The egg bun was soft but not enough density to sop up all the juices.  It had a beautiful contrast of juiciness and crispiness (from the cheese chip).  The sweetness of the roasted tomatoes and mushrooms complimented to the savoriness of the fresh ground meat.  It was also cooked medium rare, something most restaurants won't dare to do.  That in itself adds to the "juicy" factor.   Now the reason for the lack of stars... service was bad.  Took about 5 minutes for our server to show up.  Constantly, we had to flag our server down.  Not once did he ever ask us if we needed anything.  Never got our drinks refilled.   Other reasons were limited seating.  My girlfriend's truffle burger was lackluster and nothing to gloat about.  And their burgers are waaaay too small. So who's the best?  It's all difference of opinion.  So far, Father's Office is the current champion.

I read an article about Umami Burger possibly being the best burger in America. The people I know that have tried it, agree it's good but they always mention the bun. So, okay.. I need to try this burger. This location has valet, indoor and outdoor seating. Each table had tablets you can play with that have games and Umami burger things like the menu, locations, etc. They serve water in clear plastic that you can easily mistaken for glass by just looking at it. I thought it was and picked it up to find it flimsy. The menu had several different burgers, sides, salads, and untraditional condiments like their own Umami Ketchup, Kombu Relish, etc. On top of that they had other burgers for specials. Being my first time and many of the burgers looking tasty by description, I tried the Umami Burger. I thought I should go with the namesake. The bun, yeah.. I see why people mention the bun. They even mark it with a 'U' on top. But, this Umami Burger.. wasn't that great to me and I wished I had tried something else. There was a strong herb like fennel in it that I didn't like. I also tried the Malt Liquor Tempura Onion Rings.. really good. It came with a Chinese soup spoon full of ketchup. I wanted to try their other condiments ($$) with it and the Jalapeño Ranch was also pretty good. I should have strayed away from the namesake Umami Burger and went for something else.. I probably would have liked it more.

I've never felt more uncomfortable in dining experience. We were sat at the " bar" which had no booze and was just us facing wall.  This is not my kind of burger place. I really wanted to like unami and i dont care about spending good money on a good burger. This burger had no wow factor, the service was awful, fries were awful, the waiter was a sarcastic hipster, and there was no beer served. Go find the grill em all truck if you want a good LA burger.

Bestbestbestbest. Fun little place with the best tasting burger and onion rings I've had. My friend and I split the truffle & umami burger. Both mouth wateringly good, but the former slightly edged out the latter for obvious reasons (hi, truffle cheese AND truffle glaze). Though, I did love the roasted tomato on the latter because it tasted like just really amazing catsup. Thank you. I love you Umami. Oh, they forgot my salad but I count this as a blessing because sharing halves of these two rich burgers and 2 onion rings was totally enough.

You know...I'll admit.  My Turkey burger was good. The tempura onion rings were nice and fattening.  My tastebuds were happy. So why two stars, you may ask.... Service was terrible.  I don't appreciate being treated like a 2nd class citizen...ever.  We walk in expecting to be greeted with a "Hi, Hello, welcome to Umami burger."  but instead the asshole just points to a table with a "duh" face on.  We then order a round of waters and the waiter (another guy) is apparently mad that we ask for just water or some BS like that or is mad that we're asking him to do something for us.  He then comes back with 4 plastic cups of water.  What's so wrong about plastic cups?  Only the fact that everyone else in the tiny ass restaurant had nice glass cups of water on their tables.  Did they think we were going to drop them or steal them?  geez. ok, now time to order.  Being that its our first time here, we have a couple questions about what's on the menu.  Instead of just nicely answering the questions and being helpful, like a professional in the service industry would do...our waiter decided to treat us like we're retarded/wasting his time/not speaking english/etc. and make us feel stupid for bothering him with legit questions. wow.  i should just stop now before i get really mad. 2 stars only because the food was actually pretty good.

Just got back from having lunch there and was not impressed. We arrived at noon, when they opened, and the place was already filled and had a 20 minute wait.  Put our name on the list and was told to wait outside.  30 minutes later, I went in to see where we were at, and was told, "We already called your name." I told them I was sitting where they told me and heard nothing. We were then seated in what looked to be an old bathroom.  One table in the middle of the room as well as a shelf around the room to eat off of.  It was noisy and crowded. We ordered the Umami Burger and the Truffle burger, sweet potato fries and onion rings. The burgers were under cooked (except for the outside of mine which was blackened and tasted like it), and there were a total of 5 onion rings which were greasy and tasted awful.  I spit it out. Filled with snotty Hollywood types that seem to think the screenplay they were working on required loud grunts of agreement.  I hate to tell you, but your computer can't understand you. Tiny portions.  Overpriced.  Don't believe the hype.

Tried to eat here for the first time one hour ago at 3pm on a Friday afternoon. All I wanted was a good burger, some A/C, and forty-five minutes to glance at my book. Immediately, a hostess with a clipboard informed me I was not allowed to sit at one of the several empty two-person tables. They were reserved for two people only, not solo diners. I had two options: (1) sit in a gloomy side room at a narrow counter facing a wall, or (2) sit outside on a patio. I come from the South where we learned fifty years ago it isn't fair to discriminate against certain diners by seating them separately. When I protested, a faceless manager who never turned around and never addressed my concern told the hostess I could sit at the one table in the gloomy side room all alone, sequestered from the other patrons. I took one last look at the empty tables for two in the main room, and imagined the rush of customers who would be flocking there in the next hour... and then I left never to return. I should have taken a cue from the pretentious name. I should have taken a clue from the $2.50 valet charge. But it's more than clear this establishment suffers from delusions of grandeur and an inflated sense of ego. Someone should remind them they are serving a grilled meat patty on bread, now matter how many extra senses it pleases. Umami has many delicious competitors who are happy to seat and serve parties of one. I will give those other places my business from now on.

Some of the best burgers around.  Seriously, these are damn tasty.  Be warned, they do come out more rare than usual, so if you are lame and like well done beef you'd better say so.  Their standard is very medium rare, but perfect for me and delicious.  Crowded, but worth the wait. Damn, I want one RIGHT NOW.

We really enjoyed the burgers, but the condiments were even better. We ordered four (4) burgers and all the condiments like ketchup, aioli, relish, spicy mustard, and a side of pickles. The pickle plate came with okra, two (2) types of pickles, hearts of palm all really tasty. What I liked about my burger was the taste of the grilled sirloin, you tasted meat and it was cooked to perfection. What I didn't like about my burger was no lettuce,tomato,onions just green chili. I should of read the description of the hatch burger it was meat and green chili's. The g/f got the Umami burger and was happy as a little clam in a shell, the burger disappeared in under 10 minutes.We downed two burgers and we all had hand cut fries, thin fries, sweet potato fries and onion rings. All very tasty and cooked to perfection. After finishing the burgers we moved on to the Cake Monkey desserts, pretty damn good. We had several cookies and individual cakes. Going to order more of those darn desserts through the mail soon.

What is this?! Is this supposed to be a slider? Where's the other 2 that's supposed to come with this mini-burger?? Okay, I know I'm in LA, but just because Kate Moss gets full off of this, doesn't mean regular people will. Horrible portions for the price. I literally was hungry as soon as I stepped out of the restaurant. I ordered the Umami Burger and it was pretty good. I just learned recently what "umami" is -- from what I remember, it's the oily, buttery, meaty, hearty taste from foods like cooked tomatoes, thick portabello mushrooms, and chicken stock. Now that I know that, I know that the Umami Burger definitely had a lot of "umami." It was rich, oily, meaty, and hearty. But it wasn't -- what's the word? -- TASTY. Don't get me wrong -- it was good in the way that I think eating cream cheese is good. It's fulfilling in that sense. But honestly, it really doesn't have much flavor -- it's not tangy, it's not sweet, it's not creamy, it's not bursting with really anything other than... "umami". So yeah, it was good -- but it definitely wasn't memorable. I also hated the "homemade" ketchup they had -- I vote that all pretentious "gourmet" burger joints all keep a bottle of Heinz ketchup on deck, in case somebody doesn't want to dip their french fry in a strange organic red paste. I also tried the beet salad w/ truffle oil & aged cheese and that was pretty good. Beets? Good. Truffle Oil? Good. Cheese? Good. Can't really go wrong there. I'm also happy that they have Sarsaparilla root beer which is awesome. All in all, this place really is nothing to rave about. The famous Umami Burger was a huge let-down, in taste and in size.

We ate here a year ago and forgot to write this review. i do remember the ketchup which was my favorite thing. The fries were tasty but a little soggy, the onion rings were crispy and the tater tots were really good. The burger was juicy and delicious. Dripping with flavor, literally. I ordered my burger medium well and it was the way I liked it. We didn't have to wait for our table but there was a line after we ate. Get there early.

Thank you to the God of Greasy Goodness for Umami Burger! After walking past this place several times on our way to Urban Outfitters, the boyfriend and I finally decided to try this place out. We had friends tell us... best... burger... ever and boy were they right! The menu is quite different for a hamburger joint, but this isn't your regular hamburger joint! Unique ingredients and a fresh style of preparation. We each had the Hatch Burger. Being from New Mexico any time I see green chilis on a menu I get really excited. Four different types of hatch green chili's. AHmazing! We also enjoyed the sweet potato fries and the cheesey totts. The totts aren't quite what you would expect... the cheese was baked inside! Different and yet amazing! Not as messy as regular cheesy totts would be, BUT the burger makes up in that department! I would suggest getting extra napkins cause these burgers can be a mess! But a darn good mess! :-) I will agree with fellow Yelpers in the fact that this place is a little pricey for a burger, which doesn't at least come with fries... so expect to throw down at least $15 per person for burger, fries and a soda pop. I will admit though... I am already thinking about my next trip to Umami! Gonna try the signature burger. There's something about a grilled tomato and parmasian crisp that screams, "TRY ME!"

I can't believe it's taken this long for me to try this place. We got the root-beer float, the onion rings, the sweet potato fries, the umami ketchup and the garlic aoili sauce. None of these were why we came, and none of these are worth coming back for. The rings were too fried, the sweet potatoes were too limp, the "special" ketchup tasted exactly like regular ketchup, the aoili was not nearly garlicky enough, and the root-beer float was a bunch of ice-cream with not enough root-beer on it, and should properly have been called a root-beer ice-cream sundae. But like I said, those are all distractions. We came for the burger. And the burgers were worthwhile. I tried both the Umami burger and the Manly Burger (because I'm a man!). Both burgers had solid buns that didn't fall apart of feel flaky. Good chunks of meat without feeling too meaty (well, the manly burger was pretty meaty), and a good blend of the toppings, rather than just being thrown on. I preferred the manly burger and the girl liked the lighter (relative term) umami burger, but both were really good. Definitely would come back for the burgers, maybe ignore the rest of the stuff. The valet is only a couple bucks, so might as well get it and save yourself the headache.

We didn't think Umami Burger was very "umai". Ketchup: no big deal; kind of on the sweet side. Fries: steakfries on steroids. These puppies are cut big & thick, and their size reminded me of polenta sticks. Tempura Onion Rings: greasey I ordered the port and stilton burger and my wife got the signature Umami burger. Maybe I expected too much, but I was underwhelmed by both the taste and the texture of my burger, as a whole. I didn't mind the small size of the burger, but the experience of biting into its mushy consistency did not endear itself to me. I also didn't get to taste much of the meat, as the other flavors sort of raped, pillaged and plundered the flavor of my patty; overall it was on the salty-savory side, but what I did taste of the patty towards the end of my burger was pretty good. Just one caveat: they cook their burgers a bit on the medium side, which means you'll get a bit of the juicy-juice, which is okay if you get all sparkly in the sunshine, but my wife had them take it back to the grill and cook it some more. The waitress (who was very nice, by the way) looked at her like she was cuckoo. I'm assuming that they use high-quality ingredients, so I wasn't worried about a visit to the local ER. The dining space itself is nice, but a little cramped; we shared a counter in a nook with several other people, tucked away from the main dining space. Parking is in a small valet lot, which can be a little hairy since you have to make the turn off of busy La Brea Avenue. Umami, one day I will return and give you another chance...

On a Sunday around 1pm, this place was packed with burger whores.  Street parked it easily enough.   Our group of 8 waited a little over an hour for a table.  Space seemed to clear up a little by 3pm.  It's hard to find a great place for big groups these days.  Found out that shamelessly staring through the windows to get people to leave earlier doesn't work hahaha.   I had the Pork Chorizo Burger and the Truffle Burger and both were bursting with mouth-watering finger-licking flavors and juices.  First time a burger ever spit back at me after I took a bite mmMMmm.  I wish the burger was a little bigger...  Why are gourmet burgers always that same puny size?  Live on the wild side and cook up some 1 pounder gourmet style burgers!!!   They ran out of Mexican coke as well, which would've topped it off for me.  Sorry, but being popular isn't an excuse to run out of things on the menu.  4 stars w/potential to be 5.

Like if this place needs any more reviews. I will just write about what I am doing this very second. Earlier I fixed the speaker so the radio in my car can work so I had to pry open my door panel and in the process broke off small pieces of door, but at least I have music in my car now. Had a smoke and am now reading 2 awesome comics I just caught up on KICK-ASS and halfways through with Scott Pilgrim books and I will now have another smoke and after watch the tv. or read more comics, p.s. the Hatch burger at this joint is amazing.

We were starving when we got to Umami burger. I was really excited to try this place out after my girlfriend told me that the yelp reviews had said they made a mean burger. When we got seated, we ordered the Umami Burger and a side order of onion rings.  We only got one burger cause we figured a $10 Burger would be pretty decent in size. 5 minutes later we got the burger, cut it in half and 3 bites later it was already gone... dang that was a small ass burger!  The burger itself was ok.  The best way to describe it would be a slider with spaghetti sauce on it.  Not one of the best burgers in LA like people rave it to be. It took quite some time for our onion rings to come out.  Honestly, by then we didn't even want the onion rings cause we had already finished the burger.  For dessert, we had ordered a coffee toffee ice cream sandwich.  It was definitely the highlight of the meal.  It was like a macaron with ice cream filling!  We asked how they made them and the waiter told us they actually get them from a place called MILK. After we heard that, we thought it was funny that the one thing we really liked about Umami Burger was something that they didn't even make. In the end, we were left starving... but bookmarked MILK :)

I should of ordered the Port & Stilton like my son, or the Truffle burger. But instead, I took the waiter's advice and got the stupid Triple Pork burger. I hate him. Just kidding, it's more like a strong dislike... It was Chorizo, Bacon, and ground pork, but it doesn't tell you that it is all ground up together. It was no bueno. I've made 50/50 burgers at home that were better. The seasoning was not right. The other burgers were good. Phenomenal? eh, not really.... good, yes. Cheesy Tater Tots - good, all six of them. Tempura Onion Rings - good. Root Beer Floats - good, exotic choices of Root Beer. $3 Mexican Diet Coke?? why?? it doesn't even have sugar in it... The back patio is decent and not as stuffy or claustrophobic as the indoor seating. Valet to get burgers... only in LA.

I'm too lazy to actually review anything on yelp anymore, but I had to say something since this place deserves higher ratings than it has. They make the best hamburger ever...end of story. That's all I have to say.

I ordered the burger with the truffle sauce. The food came quickly and the service was great. As for the food: The meat was of great quality and i can say i quite enjoyed the burger. The burger was about $16 and it did not come with anything on the side and i guess that and the fact it was not as big as one hope for when they pay such price. If you go to it just expect to pay ups of $25 for a burger, fries and a drink and if you are okay with that then you will definitely have a great experience. the survice was great and the place was very clean and the turn around was quick which is great because the place is not big and i believe only had like 10 tables.

Always make a point of coming here when I am visiting LA. They have healthier and gluten free options as well (just FYI). I am not a fan of super raw meat, so be warned that they are typically pretty raw, I usually ask for them to be a medium rare and that is perfect. They take specifications on your order. Prepare for a bit of a wait, pretty much any night of the week and especially right around meal times. This location has a set up valet. Outdoor seating available. I wouldn't come with a group of over 4 or 5, might be hard to be seated and it is pretty busy and loud.

Ordered the Umami Burger and Truffle Burger. We cut them both in half and shared. The Umami burger was absolutely incredible, delicious and frightening (a burger can be this good?! scary!). Then the Truffle burger, so good. so good it put me in a FINISH HIM daze for a good minute. And its fatality...AMAZING. Will have to say its the best burger i've had.

After hearing about Umami Burger for a while, i finally got around to trying it.  People always talk about it being the "best burger".   I can't DISAGREE more.   The Service: First off, the wait was 45 mins.  After finally getting seated, we put in our order immediately.  We knew our waiter was a straight-up idiot.  He brought us a root beer float when we ordered an orange soda.   30 mins later, we asked about our food and he said they were plating it right now and it'll be out in 2 mins (we're pretty sure he forgot to put in our order at this point). Another 10 mins after, we flag him down again, he goes to the back for 5 mins to hide, comes out and avoids our table.  So far it'd been 45 mins since we ordered.  People were getting seated after us and getting their food before us. 7 mins later, the BURGERS FINALLY ARRIVE, but not the sides.  A few minutes later, the sides are out, but missing one order of fries.  We asked for an extra plate, he didn't bring one; we asked for garlic aioli, he forgot that too. My buddy ended up drawing this awesome picture on their table paper: http://www.yelp.com/biz_… The Food: My truffle burger finally came and it looked delicious.  The patty was still dripping and moist and the brioche bun looks fresh.  But what's up with the size of the burgers?  I'm paying $11 for this and it's not even going to fill me up?  Immediately you think "this better be a really special burger for this price".   NOPE!  It literally tastes like you use a fattier ground beef, shape it into a perfectly round 1/2 inch patty, cook it on a flat-top with garlic infused oil, add some MSG to boost the flavor, put it on the brioche bun (which tastes too buttery), and add a bit of their garlic aioli, which in my opinion was missing the garlic and just tasted like mayonnaise with lemon and a touch of mustard. The onion rings were ok, a bit too thickly battered, and they only give you 6.  The sweet potato fries came out luke warm and didn't even compare to Father's Office.  Their regular fries were fine. Overall: The service was terrible the food mediocre at best.  Parking is a nightmare too, and I'm not about to valet at a burger place.  I'd rather go to Father's Office, Golden State, or In & Out.  Those 3 pretty much cover the best of 3 styles of burgers (Gourmet Burger, Solid Restaurant Burger, and Fast Food Burger) in my opinion.  I know this review won't stop you from going to eat here, but don't say I didn't warn you.

Went to this spot because of my school. I was in class and we were discussing umami flavor profiles and history...anyways. someone brought up this joint and I was really enticed by it. So a month later my girl and i were in the area and we went. The place is urban and the decor is modern. Small kitchen, i swear if they had more than five employees in the back it would look like a sweatshop. back to the restaurant, the food hahem...burgers. well they were amazing as my girlfriend so eloquently put it...and seriously they were! full of flavor!!!! They were a healthy portion filled me up enough for me to go home and make a little more to top it off. So.. if like everyone else has said, their burgers are 5/5 hands down. Some of the best burgers I have ever had! unfortunately i have to give this spot a 3!!!! Man their service was not all that great. Menu was tiny! not much variety... well with that tiny ass kitchen one more item on the menu and the kitchen would not suffice. Now...  for the piece d' resistance we ordered a side of fries for three bucks and we got six... literally SIX, 6, seis, zes, sechs! that means each fry was 50 cents!!!WT* that thing must have been blanchedto cook them through and deep fried in truffle oil(which would not be smart) to make them crispy which they were not. and salted with the most expensice flur de sel in the world! Anyways, go there for the burgers and thats it!

yummmm~I am in love with burgers again!  Being turned off by the usual, slighlty dry 'beef' pattys fast food chains call "burgers", I have embraced this new- found rich cultural intoxicating burst of flavors that occurs with a single bite into this juicy piece of art! As each morsel pops & dances upon my tongue, I am drawn yet again to another scrumptious bite, only to find, to my dismay, that I have almost finished my love....l mean burger....left to lick the crumbs off of the porcelain plate and yes! fingers....... I ordered the OG umami burger with mushrooms and it was quite an experience....Customer service was A++++++ as well, with one glance towards the server, before even raising a hand, they were by the table to attend our needs....I heart Umami! slighlty pricy but it was worth it.  every bite.

A few weeks ago, some friends and I met at Golden State, but they were randomly closed on a Wednesday, and the apologized profusely on the note duct-taped to their door. I was bummed then, but after this meal at Umami, I resepct the decision to close down for the night rather than do this to paying customers: waiter: can I get you something to drink? us: beer? waiter: it's BYOB. there's a liquor store across the street. us: ok then, diet coke. waiter: we don't have diet. us: ... iced tea? waiter: we're out of it, but it's sweetened anyway, so.... us:...can we have some water then? waiter: sure! Why ask us what we want to drink, if you don't have anything to offer but water? Just bring it. Then we are informed that they are out of the turkey burger (fine, that's the choice of burger pussies anyway) but GET THIS: they are out of fries. FRIES.  Because the "food is delivered on Monday." Well, I know a magical place where they have potatoes on a Sunday night, and that place is called Ralph's - over the rainbow field of carbs and through a dense forest of tuber faeries, lies a brightly lit wonderland where a cook can procure a king's ransom in potatoes for a few shillings. We ordered the port stilton with the "free" aioli condiment (aioli never arrived) and the eponymous Umami burger with Umami ketchup (which is Ragu spaghetti sauce, sub-room temperature, served in a chinese soup spoon). The burgers are actually quite tasty, but on the smallish side, but filling all the same. And tasty, did I mention that.  Our tiny onion rings arrived piled in a bowl when other tables had giant rings arranged artfully in a row BY SIZE. And our market salad never made an appearance, except on the bill. Oh, and we sat at "the bar" which is a small shelf-lined room where diners can sit on high stools facing the wall. An opportunity to upsell people into more food or dessert completely missed. As my brother the chef would say, good service can sometimes save bad food, but the reverse is never true.  It's a shame, because they're pretty damn good burgers. I'm going to check out Golden State tomorrow.

Overall:  A tasty burger, BUT I have issues with this place: 1.  TOO RIGID.  They believe their burgers are perfect the way they are, so you cannot add or swap ingredients/sauces.  You can only take-away ingredients.  Picky eaters beware.  This was a hard concept for some in my group to understand and it was very awkward. 2.  TOO SLOW.  And too many excuses for being slow.  Just figure it out and get it right.  You only make burgers. 3.  TOO EXPENSIVE.  $10 burger + all those little sides + drinks + sauces add up REAL quick.  Plus $2.50 valet + tip.   4.  TOO LOUD.  We sat outside which was a bummer (never even saw inside).  Big trucks roaring down La Brea, cars honking non-stop, road construction right next to us on the side street.   5.  AS FOR THE BURGER:  It was pretty tasty, but I asked for it medium well and the thing was bloody.  Apparently THEY like it rare, so that's how I got it.  The onion rings were good but VERY salty. I won't be back. My vote for best burger in LA is still In-N-Out.  That's what a hamburger is all about.  Not all the other BS you get at Umami.

Umami Burger was just ok to me. There is a belief I have that burgers should come with fries. Period.  I don't appreciate a $12 burger that doesn't automatically come with a side of fries. The menu was very limited and there was no option to create your own burger. I actually felt self conscious about asking for no onions, and I never hesitate to make special requests.  I had the Earth burger because I wasn't in the mood for the real thing.  It was pretty good, nice flavors in the mix.  The bun was very good.  My boyfriend had the Umami burger and said it was ok but he didn't like the strange fried cheese concept. He prefers Apple Pan's burgers.  The burger was cooked properly as "medium-rare," the only way they serve their burgers. The fries were very standard. I don't like any ketchup other than Heinz, but theirs was so far from standard ketchup that it was acceptable as an alternative sauce.  I would still offer the real stuff if I were Umami.They also had four other sauces for 50c each and they're served in these soup spoons, so it's not like you get a whole lot of sauce.  At least the ketchup was free. The food took FOREVER to come out and we were sitting in this weird little room that I didn't like.  Two sodas, one veggie burger, one regular burger, and one order of fries came out to $40 including tip.  I won't be going back... I wouldn't say DONT GO, but I also wouldn't suggest it.

Been hearing a ton of buzz about this place.. and with the advent of the new fine burger trend; I had to dust of my burger tasting tour hat from a couple summers ago to check these places out. Burger: Good.  Had the Umami Burger. The crispy parmesan was a great touch to combine the cheese/crispy texture.  Ovendried tomato was a nice flair from the regular tomato.  The shitake mushroom added a unique asian flair and flavor.  Bun was well done too. Where did this burger fall?  The beef could've been a little more well seasoned; but more importantly, this burger could've definitely used a better sear.  At first bite, this burger just spills and leak precious beef juice allllll over your plate!  The right sear could keep this from happening; kept the bun dry; and your plate clean. My 2nd gripe: The fries.  Don't get me wrong..these were verrrry well crafted fries.  I would put these fries up in the tops of my fries love bracket.  They are boiled (to get some of the starch out), and then fried, and then friend again.  Technique is top notch.  So what's wrong?   It's always wrong when I can count the number of fries served... and when that number is about the number of fingers you have?  Even more wrong!  I don't mind coming to a place like this and paying a premium for an experience, but when the potato is such a cheap commodity (what, not more than a dime or two?)... HOOK IT UP!  I don't need a mountain; but maybe enough for me to pace through my burger would be nice? On the plus side-- I do want to report that there is no corkage fee; so booze it up! Conclusion:  Ehhhh... good, but didn't knock my socks off.  I might come back if I was around the area, but probably not specifically for this place.

I'm not the biggest burger connoisseur, but I def don't mind grabbing one at Umami. One of the few places I get cravings for regularly. My favorite has to be the truffle burger. Seating is limited and the venue is quite small. So expect some wait time. You can opt to valet or just find street parking. Haven't had a problem thus far finding something in the street.

Simply put - this place has a damn good burger.  The Truffle Burger is amazing, plus it's not super heavy, so you don't feel gross afterwards.  Sweet potato fries and onion rings were good too, plus you can't skip the dipping sauces. This particular restaurant doesn't have liquor but a good assortment of other beverages. We had room to split their ice cream sandwich which was yummy and not super heavy. Good portion sizes. Great staff!!!  Plus the wait on a Sat night was only 15 mins - nice!

I debated on whether or not I should give this a 4 or a 3, but honestly, this place was good to me. My first visit here, I didn't expect a lot considering I've ready what my other yelpers have said about this place. I had to try it any ways! There is plenty of parking in the street within walking distance because the only way to park next to Umami is valet. I think it's only $2.50 for valet. As we walked to the front we were greeted by the hostess. We were seated right away, and our waiter was quite nice. She seemed new, so I tried my best not to give her a hard time :). Since I've never been there before I did ask her which burger was the best, and then I realized that she just started working there. I had to go with my inner instincts and ordered the Triple Pork burger. The bestie ordered the Port Burger. We also ordered the Market pickles as an appetizer. If you do not like pickles do not order this. If you are a fan like me, then this is your opportunity to experience spicy pickles, tangy pickles, bitter pickles, minty pickles, and savory pickles! My burger was a really good choice. The triple pork added so much layer of flavor. To add on to that the bacon and chorizo also added about a million more! My burger was done medium rare, and unlike the other reviews, mine was not bloody at all. The Port according to the best was quite delicious! I took one small bite, and I had to completely agree with him. The beer batter onion rings were also quite delicious! The Umami Ketchip was DELICIOUS! All they did was add truffle oil with the ketchup and you get tomato heaven!! I did not have enough stomach space for dessert, so I will leave it to those that have made it that far! The food was quite delicious considering I had small expectations. The service was as a good as it gets for a new employee. The place inside was small, but the outside had enough space for more! They do not serve alcohol unlike the other location. This isn't as good as the other gourmet burgers I've had, but I did give it an extra star for proving my expectations wrong. Port Burger and Triple Pork is the way to go!!

Finally got a chance to try Umami and see what the hype was all about. We went on a Sunday afternoon around 3 and even around that time, the place was packed.  We were lucky that there are those single seater bar stool spots open so we didn't have to wait.   So for my first Umami experience, decided to try the Manly Burger, which comes with beer-cheddar cheese, smoked-salt onion strings, and bacon lardon.  The onion string is a great topping.  They do need to add more bacon though since the piece of bacon was quite small. The burger patty itself was cooked to a nice pink and it was juicy but I didn't really get what was so special about it.  Figured that I must try the orignal Umami to figure out since all the toppings on the Manly burger probably covered. Which is exactly what Leonard W got so I took a bite of the Umami burger.  He swore that the burger itself had so much flavor but I still couldn't really taste the amazingness.  However, it's still a damn good burger because that cheese crisp that comes with the burger is the boss.  Salty, cheesy, and fun to eat. Also got to try the sweet potato fries and the tempura onion rings.  The sweet potato fries are just your average sweet potato fries, nothing too crazy about it but the tempura onion rings are some of the best onion rings I've had anywhere.  The tempura batter is great and it didn't have that greasy feel when you bite into it. Food's great but I just wish there's a little more food.  For the prices, I was deeply shocked to see that there's only about 5-6 onion rings, and the burgers itself aren't big.  After I finished it I thought about ordering another since I finished it so fast and I probably would've if it wasn't around $10 for a burger haha. All in all, good spot for a good burger.  There's a few more on the menu I must go back and try out but for now, Umami is a solid burger spot for me, but not a must!

My favorite burger of all time (so far!) The Umami burger, the triple pork, the truffle burger. I love them all. the burger's presentation is superb: simple and clean. You lift the bun and find a beautiful and juicy patty that's loaded with flavor. Umami burger must ground their own beef because their beef is probably the most flavorful I've ever had. The sweet potato fries are great and the ketchup is a chipotle-style ketchup(?). I like that they don't have the typical "seasoning" on these fries, instead having a cinnamon like seasoning that meshes perfectly with the sweet potato fries. I think it's a little pricey for the size of the burger (i literally spent half an hour in there, with probably 10 minutes of eating), but I'm a quality over quantity type guy anyway so this doesn't really bother me. Service is great. They have one of those tablets to keep your table entertained. It's free for two games and totally worth trying out. I especially like "Tough Call" because it involves two situations that's bound to make both you and your friend to question which is "better."

One word: Overrated. Umami burger lacked umami. The Greenbird (turkey) same thing. The good: The homemade ketchup and the roasted garlic aioli sauce. As for service...There were only 3 tables that were filled, yet they wouldn't let one guy sit out in the main area because "those are reserved for 2 people or more". The girl sent him into the little room with seats that faced the wall. How DEPRESSING is that? Ridiculous. Good thing he came out and just sat in a 2-seater. She didn't have guts to tell him to go back and sit in the dungeon. {Side Note: Go to Flemings's for their $6 happy hour burger. SOOO GOOD!}

Middle of the week, middle of the day and the place was packed. We waited about twenty minutes for a space at the bar, a table would have been longer.  No biggie. The menu, as you've probably heard, is small and simple.  You get a choice of several burgers.  For my first visit I went for the namesake: The Umami Burger.  It was really good.  Cooked perfectly, seasoned just right. Prices are not cheap for a burger so maybe that's why I ate mine slowly and delicately.  It was a good thing because I was able to enjoy the subtle flavors of the burger and the spices that supposedly make this place such a draw. Everything here is a la carte.  We shared onion rings and fries.  Both very good.   Would I race back here, probably not... but I'm glad I've experienced the mysteries of the Umami Burger.

Oh Umami....the 5th taste...the much debated and argued... Are you truly the nation's BEST burger? The moment I pulled up to Umami I knew this place was "hipster". I ordered the SoCal burger with sweet potato fries ($9, $4). This is not your traditional burger...so get that through your head before walking in. While I do think the burger was good..it wasn't life changing. I could tell that the burger's ingredients were fresh and that a lot of thought went into crafting the flavors of the burger...but that a nation's best burger does not make. I like my burgers with lots of lettuce so it has that distinct CRUNCH when you bite into it. But I guess this place is too good for that... The burgers here are more like sliders than burgers if you catch my drift (no obvious lettuce/tomatoes). Also..the sweet potato fries were average. Tasty it was...but I'm on the fence about its worth and the tons of accolades it gets. Anyway..if I'm paying $10 for just a burger..I expect to not have to pay for EVERY little thing. Valet parking...really? Paying for extra sauces? REALLY? Its small things about this place annoy me. It's kind of....pretentious. I know this place isn't my favorite burger because as I sit here typing..I'm not getting any cravings for their burger. In fact...I can hardly remember what it tasted like!

Have been meaning to come here for months now! Finally decided to head into LA for the much-hyped Umami burger last night with some buds. At this particular location, there was $2.50 for valet parking. I'm not too sure about the other Umami Burger locations. We really wanted to try the Diablo pastrami truffle fries special that night; unfortunately, they were all out of the truffle fries. So we ended up splitting an order of sweet potato fries and each of us got an Umami Burger. The burger didn't look quite as good as the pictures posted, which was kind of disappointing. It wasn't far off, but it definitely wasn't as impressive. Peeling off the top bun, I could see a small round object the size of sliced pickle from any fast food joint. It was small and laid across the parmesan crisp; after comparing it with the photos and descriptions, I ended with the conclusion that this was the mushroom AND roasted tomato. That was the disappointment; that this small chunk of red-and-black was actually two ingredients and they looked nothing like the images on Yelp. So my first two bites were mostly just bun, patty, and some parm crisp. After my first few bites, I hit the tomato and it was just delicious with the underlying caramelized onions. A few bites more, though, and I was back to just the bun, patty, and parm crisp. It was such a short experience of the 'full' burger. I wish the ingredients were placed a little more liberally. I mean, come on, this is a $10 burger we're talking about! That doesn't come with any sides! Burger wasn't uniformly delicious. Nonetheless, a good burger experience. Quantity is just not up there for a $10 burger; the big bucks should buy some great food. I'd rather get an equally delicious burger elsewhere for a few bucks less(and probably without valet, too).

The Umami burger left me totally confused.  It's so weird.  There is some odd sweetness too it that didn't agree with me which held it back from being one of the greatest of great burgers.  On the other hand the patty was spectacular.  The bun was good too, but there is too much butter on it (or whatever the greasy shiny coating is).  The thick butter taste is a crutch this burger doesn't need, and it ends up detracting from it.  I had to go with the namesake burger since this was my first trip, and I probably won't get it again.  Next time I plan on trying the port-stilton burger, which I think will be more up my alley.  It's easy to tell they have the ability to make an incredible burger, but this is a tenuous 4 stars right now.  My next burger will push it to either a 5 or a 3. The tempura onion rings are ok, but why not have all the tempura veggies then if you're making tempura?  The tempura is about the same as any Japanese restaurant would serve.  On their web page it looks like they cost $25, but it's really only $2.50. Boo for being out of the veggie burger (gf's need to eat too!) Yay for selling Cake Monkey Yay for incredible quality meat Boo for too much butter Boo for crappy sauce (ketchup?) with the onion rings Yay for fast pick up ordering compared to the horror stories of dining in. Yay for a different, thoughtful burger with its own distinct taste. Boo for the price (I'm a cheapskate). Yay for my gf picking up the food even though she didn't order anything because they were out of veggie burgers, all so I could watch the Red Sox beat the Yankees on ESPN. Verdict:  Not as good as Father's Office, but could be.

Finally made it out to try Umami with my girl Sarah last night, and I can say with enthusiasm that we were absolutely not disappointed. Don't go expecting a nice date atmosphere type place - this is a cool looking joint, but it's still just a burger joint. We were rushed to order, but the menu is small and I'm sure most people aren't there trying to have a heart to heart and not even thinking about the menu, so we had to let them know a couple of times to give us a minute. Once we decided on splitting the Umami Burger and the Hatch Burger, an order of rings and an order of fries, a Mexican coke and an Abita root beer, everything moved really fast. There's something to be said for mouthwatering food being table-side quickly. The verdict: The Umami Burger: really good, but I won't order it next time. The Hatch Burger: Sooooo good. Want another one already. Fries: don't bother. They are mealy and under-fried, and just not good. I wished we'd just gotten 2 orders of the... Onion Rings: yummmmm. We also had the red velvet-raspberry ding dong for dessert, which was great, but did not compare to Nickel Diner. Also, for an area with only permit parking in the neighborhoods nearby, $2 for valet seems reasonable. can't wait to go back. the hatch is calling my name. (sounds like a LOST reference...)

GF and I went back for a return engagement at Umami Burger yesterday along with fellow Yelper Ciara G.  After touting the wonders of this place Ciara had to see what all the hubbub was about.  GF and I were all too happy to find another excuse to go back.   We showed up and the line was out the door, however, since there were three of us we got seated right away at a nook near the front entrance.  Score! We opted to get five burgers and cut them into quarters so we could all sample.  Yelping at its finest! I rank them in order as follows: 1) Port and Stilton Burger ($9) - Still the culinary King of House Umami.  Port and Stilton Cheese plus carmelized onions.  A juicy explosion o' flavor.  This one makes me think of English pubs.  For some reason this one wasn't as good this time around as it was the first time.   2) The Umami Burger ($10) - A very close 2nd to the Port and Stilton.  Mushrooms plus a Parmesan crisp and a tomatoey sauce.  All I can say is...Umami?  Ooo, Mommy!   3) The SoCal Burger ($9) - This was again GF's fave.  A gooey mess of oven roasted tomatoes and cheese.   4) The Hatch Burger ($9) - Suggested by our apparently very stoned waiter in lieu of the Truffle Burger, which he said they were out of.  We figured that stoners know the best munchy foods so we gave it a go.    This one came with chopped cooked Jalapeno peppers and cheese. 5) Triple Pork Burger ($11) - Chorizo, pork and green onion diced in.  Not as good as it sounds.  Pork is more well done and drier, and doesn't go all that well with the bun and the other fixings as the beef burgers do. The girls also got two sides, the fries and the beer battered onion rings, which were decent but not great.  I'm not a big fried food guy so maybe it's just me, dunno.     This time around some of the magic wore off for me.  I'll explain. The service this time around was mediocre.  While they brought us our food quickly, we had to flag people down twice for refills on our water glasses before we got any and our waiter never brought the sauces we asked for.  Also, no Truffle burger this time around--what, was there a truffle shortage or something?  We went specifically for this burger so that was a major disappointment.   Parking at this location is always a pain unless you want to pay for the Valet service.  GF and I had to park two blocks away in a two hour limit residential parking area on a sidestreet and hoof it back and forth.   Portion sizes are also on the small side.  The Umami Burger is in between a slider and a typical Whopper-sized burger.  For an average of $10 per burger I expect more.   Hopefully the so-so service and the truffle shortage was an anomaly.  I also think Umami Burger while good is on the expensive side ($60+ for five smallish burgers plus two sides is quite pricey) so I'm inclined to hold them to a higher standard, thus the loss of a star.

It's hard to live up to such a huge reputation, but I think Umami did a pretty darn good job at that. I loved the Umami burger, and the Hatch burger. The 3rd time I went, I tried some things off the "secret" menu, like the cheesy tots, and the spicy turkey burger. The cheesy tots were yummy, and the spicy turkey burger was good, but I wouldn't order it again. I love the fact that they serve the only kind of soda's I will drink, mexican soda's from the bottle made with pure cane sugar. Now that I have been a few times, I wouldn't go out of my way to go... But if I know I am going to be right near a location for something, and it happens to be lunch time, then I will definitely show up. Oh yeah, also had fun playing games at the table with the new little tablet they have sitting there. Tried to pay my bill with it, and almost paid for the table next to me.

Oh Umami Burger, where have you been all my life?  I'm disappointed that I didn't come across this place earlier.  We ordered the umami burger, and the patty was succulent, juicy, and just plain perfectly cooked -- it was like a smorgasbord of delicious flavors hitting your taste buds all at once.  The hamburger had a slight asian touch to it, which was interesting.  I would've taken pictures, but I was pretty much done by the time I even thought about taking pictures!   We also ordered the regular thin fries as well as the sweet potato fries served with little wonton spoons filled with their version of ketchup.  They are absolutely delicious.  The sweet potato fries were served with brown sugar sprinkled on top (genius! I would never have thought of this.) I've been two times, and both times I've been, I've gone on a Friday night around 9 and I've never had to wait, and the staff is super friendly. negatives: onion rings are bleh and parking is $3 or so if you do the valet service that's right in front of the door -- it's difficult to find parking in the immediate area bc unless you have a pass, you can't park on the streets from 6 p.m. - 8 a.m. Also, if you go when I went (9 ish), the valet guy will walk in, ask if you did valet, tell you to pay, and give you your keys b/c he has to get to his other job.  hmm... time to get another valet guy? Why is there even a valet service? lame.

I'm not too sure what all the hype about this place is. I've been here and was not impressed whatsoever, I'd say everything was mediocre at best. Food was cooked well yet it lacked seasoning and flavor. Not worth the money imo, since I've had much better elsewhere.

This place is small and there can be huge lines for this place. Don't expect to bring huge parties here because they won't fit, but you could sit outside. The parking here like the rest of LA sucks, either valet or get lucky on the street. On to the food. I went with my friends advice and did not order the umami burger and went on ahead to order what the waiter thought was good there, which was the Kauai burger; medium well cooked beef, chopped red & green peppers, chopped pinapple pieces and a slice of bacon. This is one juicy burger, I tried a bite of the truffle burger my friend ordered and it tasted the same, the meat tasted the same as my burger, the truffle most have been hidden in the middle. Since the burger is juicy, the toasted bun will soak it up, so if you don't like soggy burgers, eat this thing quick...which also makes you sad because the burger isn't all that big.

I first heard about Umami from from Good Food from KCRW. Almost anything that Evan Kleiman and Jonathan Gold says, I would almost want to try. In addition, I admit i was intrigued with the idea of anything remotely Japanese and with Burgers (though I am not suppose to eat too much red meat - more on that later). Umami is the 5th taste, translated from Japanese and from their website. The four other tastes are bitter, sour, sweet, and salty. Umami is neither any of those, yet is most similar to salt. Salt merely enhances the taste of umami. From what I understand of tasting it and reading about it on wikipedia - Umami is like a natural MSG flavor. Some foods that naturally have the Umami flavor include mushrooms. At this Umami Burger, open sometime last year, I had to try their signature Burger - naturally called the Umami Burger. Looking like a $10 gourmet burger, it did look quite delicious. The bun was quite big and seemed to hold it quite well. After biting into the burger, I realized the taste of umami. It was sort of bland, yet subtle with flavor. You could feel the texture of the mushrooms and meat blending together. Japanese people are know to eat with their eyes, rather than their mouths. In addition, they like the subtle flavors of food, rather than spicy hearty foods. This 5th taste might be intriguing to the most discerning palates. Their fries and onion rings are really good and compliment each of the burgers. I did get a chance to try the pork burger - which I enjoyed a bit more than the Umami one. i would go back to Umami to have the other burgers, not necessarily the umami one. In Los Angeles, we are fortunate to have some many gourmet burgers.

Eh. I don't see what all the hype is about. I left the joint feeling hungry and wanting; however, I could not justify spending anymore money on such measly portions. I'll admit the burger was decent, I just wish it wasn't so bite size. Don't sliders usually come in groups of two or more? Next time I'll save myself the trouble and get a microwave pack of white castle fish burgers. If you want a legit burger/veggie burger go to BluLA Cafe.

ATTN: VEGETARIANS The Earth burger is one of, if not THE, most delicious vegetarian burgers I've ever had, and I've been a veg for 15 years.  The mushroom and edemame patty melts in your mouth - a perfectly moist, delectable consistency, full of flavor.  Condiments are not just condiments, they're truffle ricotta, white soy aioli, slow roasted tomato... geez louise...the taste, the pleasure, and it never overwhelms.  Adding ketchup, as I normally do, would have ruined it. The bun is also very moist, reminded me of krispy kreme in texture, kinda greasy on top, in a good way.  I wasn't eating for my health.   The malt liquor tempura onion rings were just a bit too salty to be great, but they were good.  Sweet potato fries were very good, served crisp.  My favorite condiment for the onion rings was the jalapeno ranch, my favorite for the sweet potato fries the roasted garlic aioli.  I wish we'd ordered the dijon mustard instead of the house spread, which simply tasted like thousand island.  Not so great.   Finally, we shared a rocky road ice cream sandwich, made by "Milk"...it was kick ass. Our waiter was cool, service was efficient and pleasant.   My lunchmates loved their burgers, but felt it heavy in their stomachs afterwards, one had heartburn...  This place is a treat, an indulgence.  I loved it but I have to pass out now.

This place is freaking delicious.  They had run out of a couple items on the menu (it was lateish on Friday night), so I got the burger w stilton and carmelized onions.  Juicy, delicious, YUMMMM!!  Seriously, it was one of the tastiest burgers I have ever eaten.  So good in fact, that hours later, I was regretting the fact that I had left a couple bites on the plate.  Stupid stupid stupid. The sides are good.  They were out of fries, so I had the potato salad, which I usually don't like bc it's often mayo laden.  This one was good.  So were the sweet potato chips that I tried.  Didn't get to try all the homemade condiments. It's BYOB and no corkage.  Liquor store down the street.  They serve Mexican coke, which I love.  And surprisingly, they have good coffee.  The desserts are prepackaged yumminess.  I had something w marshmallows in it...not sure what else bc it was devoured pretty quickly.   Did I mention that I was really hungry before this dinner?   Regardless, amazing burger....been thinking about eating another one ever since...can't wait to go back...   OH!  Almost forgot to mention the DJs!!  Fun house music setup in a little alcove.  Nice fun touch.  :)

Umami? I say, U-Damn Good. WOW. The burger left me speechless. To quote my bf, "it makes The Counter (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…) look like they don't know what they're doing." 4realz. It's that good. I shared the signature Umami Burger as well as the Hatch Burger which comes with 4 different types of chiles "to spice up my life". I started with the Umami which completely blew me away. The patty was perfectly cooked, pink on the inside, loosely formed, far from a hockey puck, and with just enough jus on my plate after I halved the burger that I gladly mopped it up. Waste not, want not, baby! I didn't bother taking too much time to dissect each ingredient; I just couldn't wait to taste another bite and let the fifth taste consume me. It was pure heaven. As someone who stopped eating beef for 8 yrs after the mad cow scare, if this is the way to go, then hallelujah, praise the Lord! The Portuguese buns made me wonder if I should pick up baking or at least plan a pilgrimage to Portugal. Between burgers, I had some Malt Liquor Tempura Onion Rings. It was interesting but frankly, I came for the burger, and I was ready to conquer the Hatch. Even with the freshly diced, perfectly squared cubes of chiles, I must confess that I did take advantage of the homemade condiments for additional flavor. If I had the burgers in reverse order, I might have given both the same grade. But since the Unami Burger required no enhancement, I give it an A+ and an A for the Hatch. Finally, I've been reading reviews after reviews and blogs after blogs about Umami Burger ad nausem that it felt like a déjà vu. It definitely lived up to my expectation, and it's namesake. It's so mmm, mmm, mmm... good. It's Umami good. http://bellygasm.typepad…

This is the worst dining experience I've had in a while. Firstly, they put us in the corner table when there were plenty of other tables around--when we politely asked if we could have a different table, we were told no, they are trying to "even it out." Ooook.... I had the veggie burger. I'm a vegetarian, so I've had quite a few of these. The first problem was that it didn't stick together. Half of it fell out when I tried to take my first bite. The bun was greasy (the entire thing was really greasy). And the taste of the patty itself was just...too sweet and not appetizing. The potato products (sweet potato fries and cheesy tater tots) were great! Only thing I enjoyed there. The worst part of the whole experience was the service. RUUUUDE. Our server was snotty about us ordering more condiments, brought the wrong order and was condescending when we asked for the right assortment of dipping sauces. I had to ask for a fork twice (because my veggie burger quickly became not a burger), Every time you finished something, the busboy would swoop in on a mission and take it away literally the second you put down your fork. Uncomfortable. We had been there for 50 minutes, ordered four burgers and 3 orders of fries, (it's not like we weren't spending money there...) paid our bill, etc. and were sitting and talking. Less than a minute after we got our cards back we were asked to leave!! "Can you do me a favor because there's another group who is waiting for a table and leave?" in the snottiest tone of voice...ugh. So awkward. Worst dining experience ever. I felt like I was as processed as their beef probably is... through a factory.  Never going back.

It's been a few years since I've been here.  Burgers are still expensive and somewhat small.  Service was ok.  The outside patio needs another overhead cover so that the entire area could be shaded.  There's a car wash next door and busy La Brea street on the other side so it gets noisy and you're breathing in car exhaust while eating.  Ice cream sandwiches are pretty good.  I would rather have the chocolate hazelnut ice cream on double chocolate cookie though.  Cheesy tator tots weren't very cheesy.  Sweet potato fries were ok.

Truffle burger, cheesy tater tots, sweet potato fries. GOOD LAWD! Everyone in LA should have heard of Umami so I won't spend too much time talking about their food. The burger doesn't look THAT appetizing, but man.. never judge a book by its cover.  Amazingly tasty burger.  Their sides are awesome too. The location is interesting.  They have parking available (valet I believe), but I went out of my way and found free street parking and just walked over a block.  Got there around mid afternoon - no lines, not packed, and found that the interior was easy on the eyes.  The servers were helpful and cheerful - always a plus.  Other than the price (a bit pricey but not absurd considering the quality), my Umami experience was nothing but good.

I'm not a big hamburger person, but after Alex C and Alex C raved about Umami Burger and Ely L set up a group outing, how could i say no?  Boy am I glad I headed out to try these tasty little burgers.  We had a large group of 11 which was not optimal for such a small joint.  We ended up sitting 5 and 6. On my table most people ordered the Umami burger.  My boyfriend and I decided to split three burgers.  We got the Umami, Port & Stinson, and Truffle.  I started with the truffle burger.  Man that was good.  So hard to describe what it was like, but if i had to... I would say it was heavenly.  It was soo good that I had to save half of my half for later to ensure the last thing I ate was awesome.  Next I went for the infamous umami burger and I must say I was not impressed.  It was strangely sweet and there was something about it that I just didn't enjoy that much.  One of my friends later said it kind of reminder her of a pizza with the oven dried tomatoes and mushroom.  haha.  Lastly the Port and Stinson.  I thought it was pretty good.  Blue cheese is a very aquired taste and eatting half a burger is probably fine, but i don't know if I could handle a whole one. Verdict? Hands down, pay the extra for the truffle burger! Oh and we got onion rings which were very tempura like, but also very oily.  I was not impressed.  Service was slow, like all the other reviews mentioned. I will be back to horde the truffle burger all to myself and bring a bottle of wine to enjoy with it. =]

Came back here after about a year. The burgers are still very tasty and great, but maybe my tastes have changed? This time, I split one Umami Burger, a Port & Stilton Burger, and the fries. I like the Port burger a lot more (maybe it was more savory from the blue cheese) but felt it needed to be a bit more balanced with some type of vegetable (blame it on Father's Office influence). I still love the fries though, especially with Umami's ketchup that has a pungent kick. For dessert, I was glad to see they still had Milk's ice cream sandwiches (oooo love). We had the grasshopper (mint ice cream). My only complaint is that we went later in the day, and the mint was our 3rd choice of ice cream (the server had to go back twice to check what they had left). Regardless, the service was friendly and pretty attentive. Still a good experience. :)

One word: Burgasm.... Preface: I love Father's Office burgers  So much so, that I'm ashamed i haven't done a review for them.  When people said that this place might even be superior, i scoffed at them. Upon recommendation I had the truffle burger.  The bun was the perfect texture and held the burger nicely (physically and taste wise). The burger patty a rich indulgent culmination of quality beef and seasoning.  The truffle oil (so good on everything right?) just enhanced the burger that much more!  Every bite i got sad b/c I knew i was getting closer to not having another bite! LOL The Sweet Potato fries - excellent The Onion Rings - amazing tempura style batter! If you want a burger that is unique and rich in flavors associated with good seasoning (the cheese and sauce) go to Fathers Office. If you want a minimalist/traditional burger done to perfection, then you come here.  There's just no better burger for ~$10. Can I give them 6 stars? =X

Recently, my friend B and I had a conversation about Transformers 2.  It went like this: - B: It's going to be awesome! - me: I don't know about that... I want to hear your review after you see the movie. - B: I already know my review.  Awesome x Awesome! So, after the movie, I asked B what he thought.  The dejected answer was Awful x Awful Why this long and pointless seeming story you ask?  Especially for a place that doesn't need reviews?  Well, because so often, I fall for the hype.  I hear about awesomeness or perceive that something should be awesome, but then when the actual thing rolls around, it just isn't.   Umami Burger lived up to the hype.  The burgers were juicy and light.  I love how the patty is not densely packed together, but instead almost fluffy seeming.  The bun seems almost Hawaiin bread like in it's lightness and sweetness.  All the burgers are good, but I especially liked the Manly burger, with its chunks of bacon and crispy fried onions. French fries are thick-cut, not my preferred variety, but these were delicious.  Onion rings are decent as well.  Plus, they serve Margo's Bark root beer, which not only tastes delicious, but was created by a 7-year old boy who donates all the proceeds to animal rescues.   Go, your review will not be Awful x Awful

Giving this place anything less than a 4 is absurd!! Seriously, I think it's THE burger place in Southern California. It's just above all the rest and has no comparison. It's also not just your typical burger. It has such unique flavors and it's oh so juicy. I love when the bread gets a bit soggy from all its juices. MMMM bon appetite indeed!! I recently brought my boyfriend Hao L. here and my cousin and they are also both in love with Umami's burgers. We've tried Kalbi burgers and they weren't bad but Umami just hit a homerun with us. I've tried Shake Shack and Burger Joint in NYC and those were pretty good too but I think Umami even surpasses them! I love to get the traditional Umami burger. It kinda has an Asian flavor to it and I'm not sure how to describe it properly. You just have to go and taste it yourself. My boyfriend got some pastrami burger and that was delicious too. Their truffle burger is also yummy! Dang you just can't go wrong with any burger you get there. They also serve ONLY mexican coke which is basically glass bottled Coke. They have cheesed tater tots and fries as well as ice cream sandwiches from MILK. Parking is valet only of $2.50. Parking is tight! So either it's valet or park on the street. Seating is just as tight. Reminds me of all the small restaurants in NYC. But they have additional seating outside so that kind of helps. This place is always packed so prepared for some wait time unless you come during non peak hours. It's such a yummy burger and you really must check it out and try it for yourself!

I really liked this place. The burger was really, really good. However, just a little expensive for me. I mean, worth it but still... Parking was interesting but we made it, whew. The restaurant looked sleek, natural, and an open vibe. My husband had the Unami burger and I had the Truffle Burger. We started off with these corn hushpuppies, fritter like things. They were really good.  The burgers were juicy but not greasy and I loved the way the truffle added but was not overpowering on mine and my husband loved his as well. The burgers were so full of flavor and may well have been the best meat I've ever had in a restaurant burger.  Now, I have to try a burger with Bacon next time- The Manly Burger. The  ROASTED GARLIC Aloi- Yum! It was soo good.  And I think they make their own ketchup there too. Now I would have given them a five star it was that good, but rather than get one small bottle of soda, I would have rather get a glass and refills. Oh and if you like beer with your burger, they have some good choices. Dear Unami Burger People , Please get a location in Orange County- NORTH Orange County. Thank you

After all the hype and reading all the reviews (positive and negative) we still went into Umami Burger with an open mind. The wait on a Sunday night was less than 30 minutes for dinner, which wasn't too bad, given that we came right during the rush hour. We found street parking easily, skipping the insanely cramped valet parking lot onsite. Here's what went down: the first two burgers I was interested in (the Sea-Mami and triple pork burger) weren't available. They were also out of all soft drinks. Hmmmmmmm, too difficult to make that run to Ralph's, eh? But we gamely placed our orders and settled in for the wait. The food came quickly, I'll give them that. But it was just...okay. As in, I can see where they were aiming with the taste and texture, but they just didn't get there. Onion rings--great batter over big, sweet onions, but the egg should've been seasoned as well as the coating. Fries, thick cut--needed to be crispier, and better seasoned. Ketchup--the house blend was awful. Garlic aioli--needed a touch more salt. Port & Stilton--okay. Umami--okay. A bit of a mess. We saw nothing wrong with the size of the burgers (they're not large, but they're not anything to get upset over), and the waitress was responsive even if the host acted a little as though he were doing us a favor. And after all this, the experience would have been acceptable, but the fact is--the food is presented as a gourmet experience but is actually shockingly unremarkable, and way way overpriced for what it is. We don't mind spending a lot on a good burger, but this didn't qualify on any counts. There are better places to get a burger all over the country--and even Howard's or In-N-Out win over this place anytime.

Okay, if I were giving this place a rating based SOLELY on their burger quality, this would be a 5-star review. BUT, I have some qualms about other qualities of this restaurant. Burger Quality: 5/5. I can honestly say this is the best, tastiest, most flavorful burger I have ever had. I sampled the Umami, SoCal, and Hatch burgers. All 3 were amazing, but Umami was without a doubt my favorite. This is THE burger that I would crave if I were ever in the mood. Side note: Onion rings were great - you could definitely taste the malt liquor in the batter. Portion Size: 4/5. One burger was the perfect portion size for me. My brother on the other hand, who apparently has a limitless stomach, needed 2 burgers, fries, and onion rings to fill him up. The burger was so good though that I literally devoured it in 3-4 bites. Price: 4/5. Normally, my idea of a higher-priced burger corresponds with a bigger burger. Not the case at Umami. Each burger was $9, and trust me, it is SMALL for a $9 burger. If you're looking for a big burger to fill you up, you're better off getting 9 burgers off the dollar menu at McD's. If you want something DELICIOUS that'll get your taste buds firing (and you have some extra fluff in your wallet), this is a good place to go. I'm still not quite used to the LA mentality of paying more for less (food). Other comments: Staff is very friendly. Relaxed and chill atmosphere. Restaurant is relatively small and cozy. Crowd consisted of both young and old. Valet parking is $2.50.

I've been in search of what thought would be the "best burger" in LA county. Umami burger was featured on Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate. I ordered the Umami burger. The size  wasn't worth it's price. It was good but not the best. It didnt have the bang for the buck. I did enjoy the onion rings, but the skinny fries tasted like any other fast food joint. My friends, boyfriend, and I weren't completely full yet. I think we could of eaten 2 burgers each. We  even searched for a food truck in LA to fill in that void.

The food is always good at Umami but the service dropped this review to one star. I went to this particular Umami burger tonight and it was one of the worse customer service experiences I've ever had. This is the 2nd time I've gone to this one and the first time there wasn't a problem. However, this time, the staff was just rude. Yes, it was busy but that is no excuse for having a bad attitude. We waited over 40 minutes to get a table and the girl who was cleaning the tables was really apologetic for how long we were waiting. We weren't complaining. Trust me, we understand! I was a barback & a bartender and I also was a waitress. I know, how it is when a place gets slammed but don't show your unhappiness to your customers. First, when we finally got seated, we had no napkins or utensils and when the guy came to put them out, he just dumped them on the table. You could see he was just annoyed that he had to do that. Then, no one checked on us and glasses were sitting near empty for quite awhile. And when we did as for a refill of drinks, you could see that it was just a hassle for the wait staff. They also rushed us through our order and you could see that explaining the menu (some of our group had never even been to Umami) was another hassle. I understand you are trying to move people through but seriously, we waited over 40 minutes and no one gave a menu while we waited so we didn't know what we wanted. Then when they brought out the food, instead of putting the plate on the table, the wait person just handed it to people. The person would start putting it down but then it would just hover in your face until you took it. It was just such a disappointment. Luckily, it didn't damper my friends' birthdays. But I know, I'll never go to this Umami again.

Brett Schulte says: Found this great place on Yelp, I'm a new enthusiastic customer!  Have to start by disagreeing with the negative review I read from Max W...there's nothing sweet on the burger, I even asked the waiter because you scared me.  The sweetest thing is the grilled tomato.  Also, the bun wasn't greasy at all, though it's brushed with clarified butter it didn't stand out to me. I'm a burger geek, and I loved the place, instantly in my top five (though my current favorite is the Kobe sliders at Provecho downtown). But I digress... Everything was excellent here, burger, fries and onion rings.  No beer, but you can bring it in from the liquor store across the street for a $5 corkage fee... "unless it's cheap beer like Bud Light - then no charge".  Um... OK? There are only two waiters (it's a small place) that share tables but they both were knowledgeable and friendly.  Way better than the Father's Office attitude. Only down side is the "bar" seating in their tiny side dining room.  Picture a small bedroom, with four tables, then add to that seating facing the wall.  Crowded, uncomfortable, and even the staff hates it.  Dumb... fix it guys, oh and open that back patio! EDIT:  Second visit 5/19, different waiters, not liking them as much.  Still thinking about stealing their cool salt shaker (they really only have one?).  Tried the Port & Stilton burger (yum), the 3 Pork burger (still yum), but the fries were portioned too small and tasted under cooked.  Place needs music.

A friend of mine flashed this special blog link on her Facebook.  The blog is a, surprise!, food blog but the restaurants featured on it were out of the ordinary places; the type that is so different that you would have only heard of it in LA, land of the eccentric fusion.  One in entry in particular that caught my attention is this tiny burger joint off La Brea.  According to the reviewer, she was pleasantly surprised as I was too - this is some high ass presentation for just a burger joint. Indeed, it is a burger joint.  Like a hole in the wall Johnie Rockets, but personally this is one of those pseudo fusion joints that makes LA places one of a kind.  The Japanese influence in this place is apparent through the pretty food presentation (simple translation: eating fast food off a sushi plate) but the taste is simply high quality burgers at a sit down restaurant.  A bite off the Umami burger is rich and flavorful as the carcass and seasonings melt in your mouth.  Supposedly, their tagline defines "Umami" as the fifth element of flavor.  To me, it's just a hook to attract the otherwise fickle pretentious LA crowd to have some really good burgers. For meat lovers, this another place to call home, but for the cautious (read: afraid of rare bloody meat) you may want to steer clear of the Umami burger.  The meat is cooked rare, in a borderline tartare style.  While the flavor is in tact the sight of looking at you just bit into may be overwhelming if the sight of blood makes you self conscious.  The triple pork sandwich may prove to be a good alternative as it is cooked with chorizo and alioli.  Not as good as the Umami in my opinion but it still hits the spot as much. The sides leave a lot less imagination.  The fries are just fries presented like an edible jenga puzzle.  It's kind of hard to mess that up.  They also have "Mexican Coke" which uses 'real' sugar.  I did taste the slight difference but it's still coke overall to me, and served in an original glass bottle to add.   Overall, I'd definitely come back to this place again, this time to try out the tempura onion rings and whichever burger they have.  Seriously these burgers are a step above those restaurant burgers you find at a Chilis or TGI Fridays, but the hype and presentation is kind of blowing it up too much for a regular food goer to appreciate the food itself.  These are definitely above average gourmet burgers, no more, no less.

This is one of my top three burger places in LA! and i think i have had them ALL by now.  Some people complain about the portion sizes but for me, it is the PERFECT size.  I finish the burger completely satisfied, but not feeling like a complete fat a**.  The parking and wait may be a little annoying, so I like to go during non-peak hours or order to go.   I've tried almost all the burger varieties here, but I always come back to the original Umami burger.  The succulent Portobello mushroom lends a unique & bold taste you won't soon forget! You MUST also try their cheesy tater tots with their special in-house ketchup.  It will make you feel giddy like a kid.

0 stars for the burger, 4 stars for their sweet potato fries, 5 stars for their in house ketchup...That's 9 stars for the fried and Ketchup! oh my god that ketchup was GOOD!  I asked the waitress if I can just buy the ketchup...nope..."not yet", apparently they are in the works of selling bottles of it. On to why I gave the low ratings, it all comes down to expectation. This place has some phenomenal ratings by you fellow yelpers and I was just expecting the best of the best, it was supposed to taste like heaven on a bun, but instead it was just a burger, but it wasn't even a flavorful burger, it was too rare for my liking. I generally do not like it when my beef needs a band-aid. I have no idea how you "real men" like your steak bloody, blood just does not taste good for non-vampire like as myself. I like mine pink but not dripping blood. What you would call a "juicy" burger I call a bloody burger. The topping was fresh and delicious, but that meat needed some seasoning. Will I be back? MOST DEFINITELY, just not too sure I would bet a burger even if it is a burger joint though.

After much anticipation and many missed opportunities, my boyfriend and I FINALLY got to see what the hype was about at Umami. Marc and I made sure to leave OC for an early lunch and beat as much LA traffic possible. We were starving when we got here-- good thing there was no line & we were seated immediately. I ordered the Truffle Burger (recommended by the waitress), Marc got the Umami Burger, and we split a side of Smushed Potatoes. Truffle Burger- Crazy rich combination of the juicy beef patty, melted cheese, truffle oil & buttery toasted brioche bun. This wasn't a stand out "OMG I die" burger, but it was definitely something to savor. Very simple, but surprisingly flavorful. Umami Burger- Again, a nicely portioned flavorful burger. The parmesan crisp was a nice contrast to the savory beef patty & grilled onions & sauteed mushrooms. I love how busy this burger was and the few initial bites were pretty delicious, however the taste started to remind me of spaghetti shortly after. The toasted brioche bun really stood out again and give the burger that extra star. Smushed Potatoes- WHOA BUDDY! We were pretty surprised at how awesome double fried potatoes taste...especially when topped with salt & crack pepper. Great side! The aioli was a great compliment & provided a rich creaminess to the hot, crisp potatoes. Loved this. Overall, good experience, great service & good food. The burgers didn't knock my socks off or surpass the hype, but it also didn't suck or meet the hype. I'm in limbo with Umami. I'm willing to give it another go...when in LA...

Their burgers make my stomach very unhappy. Their fries are terrible. Their lines are long. Their potato things on their side menu are greasy and gross. I dont understand why this place is so popular. For those who say its they best burger they've ever had, clearly have been eating at McDonalds all their lives.

not as great as it's hyped up to be. The taste is just not there.  I expected the meat to be oozing with flavor and the bun to be toasted to perfection.  I especially was expecting great things for their nicely plated sauces. But nothing really stood out to me in terms of taste. Unfortunately, thoroughly disappointed.

Port Stilton = if you love something simple, this is your burger. I love the simplicity of this burger with just the bleu cheese and caramelized onions. ($9) SoCal Burger = skip it. Maybe it was because I ate a half of the Stilton before I tried this one, but there was no taste. It was a bit sweet, but I thought this burger was trying to be a fancier version of an In-N-Out burger. Nothing special. ($9) Fries = Very thick, decent. I love fries you can eat without any condiments. Fries here are OKAY. ($3) Onion rings = I really love the batter on the rings, but there was no seasoning. Pretty bland. ($2.5) Sauces: -Umami ketchup tasted weird. They make all their houses in house, except for dijon mustard. To me, ketchup tasted like it had a chipotle kick, which is something I did not want. -Garlic Ailoi was okay. Nothing special. -"Spicy" sauce was nothing special. -House spread is exactly like In-N-Out. *You get one free condiment with a side. Drinks: -The strawberry lemonade was good! Conclusion: This place is definitely for their burgers. However, I'm beginning to think 9 bucks is a bit much for the size of the burger, not to mention it doesn't come with a free side. It's worth a try but I don't think I'm going to come back.

I have mixed feelings about this place. The taste was really good, but service was spotty and my truffle burger was charred. Read on for more details. My friend and I get there, we park on the street cause we didn't want to do valet at a burger place. Plus we went on Sunday night round 6:30. Put down our name, and wait outside. Atmosphere here is okay. It's a small place so if its full it gets loud since its echoey. The decor is nice though, simple but with enough touches. They had these little plants in pots on each table, cept for the one I sat at. Order up!!! Truffle Burger-First bite was just super dry and charred. I tried a 2nd bite hoping maybe my taste buds had gone awry, nope. Checked the patty, lil layer of charness. Funny thing is that I only had half the burger, the other half my friend was eating and said it was great. But my half was burnt...so I showed the waiter and he said two choices, give you another half burger, or free dessert. Well considering the fact that their portions arent that big, I went for the burger again. They actually gave me a whole burger not a half actually. So points for that. 2nd try, burger not charred at all, super juicy, but a bit too raw for me in the middle, but the flavor was really good and I could actually taste it. Yum, but I had half and gave the rest away cause of the rawness. Triple Pork Burger-great flavor!!!! This was a nice blend of spices and is a more unusual burger since its all pork! Yummy...almost perfect cept the pork was a bit dry Tempura Onion Rings-yummy but super oily Fries-nice fried fat fries, would prefer them to be a bit thinner since fatter fries get soggier faster, good flavor to them Umami ketchup and garlic aioli-tasty So well, their burgers arent big, pretty small in comparison to other burger places, an pricier too, but I have to say the flavor was really good. If only they cooked it well it would've been perfect. Actually a note, they don't ask you how you want it cooked, they just do it. Which is fine with me if it comes out nicely. I left satisfied, but not  quite full. Their buns are a bit oily, which I think was a little odd, I'd prefer it not to be. Service here was okay. They were really busy, so it really seemed like they could really have used another server. There were basically 3 people floating around, one server, one cashier, and one guy who looked like he just did all. It took us some time to get seated, even though there was an open table in front of us, we did get our food quickly enough, but then no one came near enough for a bit to flag down to show them my burger. Buttttt....they were nice when I showed them the charness, and they did come by at the end to ask if it was better, but never came by after delivering the first one. So I didn't quite have the perfect time, but my friend thought the truffle burger was the best tasting burger he's had in a long time. So, I guess if I didn't get the burnt half my experience would've been better. Its definitely pricier than most burger joints, but should definitely try this place at least once.

Came here for dinner on a Friday night around 6:30pm. Parking around here is tough (mostly permit) but they do offer valet for $2.50. It was crowded (keep in mind it is a small place to begin with) but we were seated without a wait. The menu is small and they have a few burgers that are great. Very unique combination of ingredients. I had the Umami burger which was average. They did not ask how you want your meat cooked and so it came out with lots of pink and some blood. If you are not down with this, you may want to say something when you order. We got an order of thin fries to share and chose the garlic aoli dipping sauce in addition to the ketchup provided. Total bill for 2 people was $40, and I think I can find better ways to spend $40 for a burger dinner.

***Very good Triple Pork Burger and Milk® cookies & cream ice cream sandwich.*** First time I came here I was STARVING and they had just closed! It broke my stomach's heart, but the owner?manager? (not sure) Rick kindly took the phone and called their sister store so they'd put an order for take out for me; but I really didn't want to hurry, and being the first time, I didn't know what I wanted to order, so I just said I'd drop by some other time. And so I did, today Sunday afternoon! The staff was very friendly and chatty. The waitress and hostess were great. The Triple Pork Burger with chorizo sausage, applewood bacon, manchego cheese & pimento aioli was very good! Very savory, and supposedly spicy, but not at all to me, and I'm not crazy about spice other than in Thai food. It was just right. The Tempura Onion Rings were super crispy and one of the best I've had. They carry Milk® brand ice cream sandwiches, and I finally tried them! The cookies n' cream ice cream sandwich was sooo good. The fries and sauces didn't drive me crazy, though. The Hand Cut Fries are thick fries, although not soggy, were not crispy. The Thousand Island and Garlic Aioli sauces were a little flavorless for my taste. If you mix the Garlic Aioli with their House Ketchup, it's much nicer, though. It's a little on the pricy side. My burger was $11, fries $3.50, onion rings $3 and they don't have fountain soda -- they only have bottled Coca Cola @ $3 for a small bottle. With tax, my food total was $22.50. Add $4 for tip (15% tip was $3.50) and $3 for valet parking, and that's $29.50. I guess you're also paying for the contemporary décor and un-fast-foody experience. They say the valet parking is done because it tends to get very crowded and it's a mess if you leave it up to people to park their cars, which I can understand; but it's not always busy, so maybe they could have valet some days only? Overall great experience. It's a little like Golden State, but the staff is MUCH friendlier, the food is more flavorful and the place is cuter. Would definitely return.

I prefer the flaky type crusty...guess I like crusty shet that taste good! Ambiance = Crowded. Wait time. Hungry ass people! However, I dined with very nice friends...so it didn't bother me. Downer = No drinks.  Just hit up the bar afterward or go get wings and a brewsky  =) Bathroom = Unisex and flush-able Overall, I'll give this place a 3.5...wha wha wha!

UMAMI burger was DELISH!! The parm crisp gave nice texture. I loved the BUN and a LOT of burger places lack on the bun. Patty was juicy and cooked perfectly. Sweet potato fries were ok. They put sugar on it I think which makes it kind of overpowering. The house-made ketchup was DELISH though. Way better than the house-made ketchup at Haven Gastropub. The Greenbird was pretty good- def healthy and had sprouts and avocado in it. Valet parking---$2.50, the parking dude didn't even know how to use my friend's car (stick shift) so he had to park it himself. Lame. Overall, I loved the UMAMI burger-- everything else was just ok in comparison. Oh, and I love their water 'glasses'- they are plastic and malleable. Super awesome and I need to find where to get me some!

I am not a burger person,but I will have to admit that I was totally falling in love with Umami. The place is kinda small,but it has enough parking space right outside the restaurant. We ordered Umami burger and truffle burger,both of them are just beyond delicious (although I prefer Umami burger a bit more). Even the sweet potato fries tasted better than other places. However,I give 4 stars here because the unbalance between the price and the portion. It is like half of the burger size from father's office,but the price is definitely not cheap for burger. We had two burgers and one portion of sweet potato fries,it cost us $34.

Umami always fulfills my burger cravings. If you want a cheap delicious fast burger, go for In N Out. But if you're looking for something different and that oozes a gourmet-esque [yes it's made up] aura then look no further! I've tried almost all the burgers on the menu and the truffle is by far my favorite. I have never been disappointed with it! All the burgers are cooked medium rare and they frown upon additions but will let you take things out. The skinny fries and sweet potato fries also hit the spot with some garlic aioli. Don't forget all the sodas they have and even if you get a water, they have these eco-friendly cups with a nice little dent for your thumb. We definitely appreciate the small things Umami! There is valet parking but it's expensive and useless unless you have a super special nice car or don't want to waste time looking for a spot. However, there's always street parking across the restaurant and behind it in the neighborhoods. Save the $2 you'd spend for valet and order yourself a soda or some fries.

Good value, but it doesn't rise to the level of some other burgers.  The wife and I split a truffle burger and the umami burger.  The umami burger was tasty and well composed, but underwhelming, and the bun was a disappointment.  The Truffle burger was a let down with too many rich flavors, too soggy a bun, and too much butter.  This is from a person who will eat seared fois gras with a spoon.  The food was good, but not great, and with all the hype, the poor service, and the middling quality, I give it a 3. you'll notice that many of the 4-5 star reviews for this place are from "not a burger lover" people.  The food was good, but the overall experience was not there, and the burger didn't rise to the level of a top LA burger. umami burger: 6 on the absolute burger scale truffle burger: 4-5 on the absolute burger scale

Okay, this is the best burger in LA, for sure.  At least so far, but I'm willing to keep an open mind, of course. My sister and I stopped by for a quick bite.  I don't recall what she had exactly, but it was sweet and savory.  My burger...my burger was a PORK burger!  Fantastic design guys!  Everyone should try something outside of the box.  Mine came in a bowl.  Eat it.

The moment we walked in, we were greeted by a very enthusiastic host / waiter.  We were off to a good start.  Immediately after the greeting, we were seated... and soon after, our drinks were on our table: Mexican Coke and Black Cherry soda. The waiter was ultra friendly and gave all sorts of recommendations for us first timers.  We boiled it down to two, and ordered a side of smushed potatoes. Umami Burger (Cooked medium) -Amazingly juicy patty, wonderful seasoning with a slight tangy kick halfway into the bite.  This burger is what put this burger joint on the map. Truffle Burger (Cooked medium) -Personally, I consider this the winner of the two.  The truffle oil / glaze, and truffle cheese just make this even more mouthwatering than the Umami Burger... then again, I've always been a truffle fan.  When biting into it, the taste is drawn back by the dripping truffle juices... only to catch up during mid-chew.  At this point, you realize that there is now an sudden influx of flavor in your mouth. Smushed Potatoes -Sitting atop a bed of garlic aioli, these fries / potatoes are soft, moist, and very dip friendly with their homemade ranch and ketchup. While I have to say that Umami Burger is in the top tier of burger quality, it does not hold up to the likes of Golden State and some other burger joints I've mentioned from the Bay Area... but I do have to say that the homemade ketchup is quite tasty, far superior to that of Hole in the Wall's.  It has a more ketchup'y essence to it, whereas in Hole in the Wall, it almost tastes like a salsa of sorts. Regardless, the superior service mixed with an incredible burger experience most certain earns this spot 5 Stars in my book. 4 Stars for burger taste +1 Star for stellar service. Thank you Scooter!

I've been to this one and the one in Santa Monica, and they both have the same awesome burgers and sides. The Truffle burger was by far my favorite and practically melts in your mouth. Also loved the smushed potatoes. The fries were just plain fries, not very impressed. I liked the atmosphere of this place better than the one in Santa Monica and our waiter was really friendly and attentive. The restaurant is very small however and there was valet parking for a small lot? Why??? I wouldn't go with more than a group of 4 because they probably couldn't accomodate the size. Also, this location doesn't have beer and wine like the other location. Either way, I'd go back. The food was that good.

After my boyfriend pestered me, over and over and over, I finally said, "Dang. FINE. Pick up dinner at Umami Burger." It's like back off Burger Whore. You know I'm not really a burger eater. You want a burger from there so bad? Go with one of your guy friends. ANYYYYWAAAAYS. He wore me down. The first time? I ordered the Manly Burger + onion rings. Biggest problem? Super greasy. They wrap everything in white paper, so you can even see the grease oozing out. Kind of gross. Like I felt my arteries clogging just looking at it. But once I got past the greasiness, I have to say: pretty tasty. The onion rings are tempura battered. Sort of light and crunchy. They only give you a few. But along with the burger, it was enough for me. Sadly, I think like anything fried, they lose a little something on the way home. One of those things that probably needs to be eaten there, fresh out of the kitchen, for the best experience. Now, as for the burger? Like I said, I'm not a big burger person. So I don't have a lot to compare it to. But I liked it. The Manly burger is packed with bacon lardon (fancy word for bacon cubes, don't let the word 'LARD' scare you), little crispy onion string thingies and cheddar cheese. Good classic flavors. We gave it another try yesterday. Except this time, remembering the greasiness of the onion rings, I asked him to get me the steak fries. I have the same complaint as others: portion is on the smallish side. But I wasn't starving, so it seemed okay. They are little rectangular yummy bits of fried goodness. But best of all? I love that they add salt to them. Lately it seems like every time I get french fries, from anywhere, they don't add salt. Being the dirty Fry Whore that I AM, I must always sample fries in the car on the way home. And Every. Single. Time: Damn IT. NO salt. Forgot to ask for a few salt packets and I've already driven away. The key to a perfect french fry is the right amount of salt and ketchup. Unless you're old and beaten down and your doctor has put you on a No-Salt Diet, which sucks for YOU. 'Cause really? Fries without salt? HELL no. But I digress... Thank the Baby Jesus, Umami Burger adds salt to their fries and you don't need to ask. Got a side of the Umami Ketchup. Really loved that. Not sure what they add to it, but definitely had an unusual zinginess to it. Had the same burger as before, the Manly. It was better this time. Less greasy. If you're a burger fanatic? Definitely give it a try. And from what I've read, the La Brea location is best. Boyfriend says the service is awesome. No complaints. Since it's such a small spot, they'll ask you to wait outside for your order, but they bring it to you. p.s. the Boyfriend also says, "the Truffle Burger is the Goddess of Burgers."

The venue was small but cozy. Burgers were made of Kobe beef (or so they say...) but even so, 9-11 bucks for a McMuffin sized burger is still a little over priced. Besides the sweet burger buns (think Hawaiian bread) and the juicy patty, Arthur and I decided that The Counter gives you way more bang for your buck. What was cool was the seed bombs that were sold outside in a little vending machine thing for a buck. Was tempted to buy and try one, but didn't have the quarters to spare!

Umami...the fifth taste. Dude, I had no idea what umami was until Kikkoman forced it down my throat with those darn commercials with the big collagen lipped white lady whispering it seductively on the side view tip. What is a umami burger then? Well it's a delicious marriage of good old fashioned hamburger with Asian ingredients thrown in for originality sake. It wins! Traditional burger is ground beef patty, lettuce, pickles, onions, tomatoes, mustard, mayo, ketchup, relish, etc. Umami burger is...(and I am guessing) ground premium beef peppered with red chili flakes, a touch of garlic, soy- that's just the patty. Then they layer it on with home made ketchup (yummy), shitake mushrooms, carmelized onions, pan fried cheese (you know, when it gets bubbly and kinda hard/crunchy), and something else I couldn't quite put a finger on. The bun was soft, light and perfect- not too much bun, not too little. It was good. Ok, it's better than good. It's great! I had high hopes and they delivered. It was a homerun but it wasn't like a grand slam. I got the burger with fries- thick cut chimney stacked- ask for the garlic aioli- it's more like garlic buttah... Get the ice tea. It's green tea with some exotic fruit note- lychee? Refreshing! Parking is valet or you can park for an hour on La Brea for freeeeeee. I'll be back for more. I saw the triple pork burger and politely declined. It's challenge to me will be answered on my own terms.

Umami Burger is delicious! Their signature burger sets itself apart with big pieces of shiitake mushroom that really surprised me. On top of that, there's a paper-thin crisp of fried cheese hidden in there, which is very nice. Those two distinguishing ingredients make the Umami Burger unique to me. I've read that people complain about the bun, but I think it suits the signature burger. As far as sides go, I went with the tempura onion rings and dipped them in garlic aioli. Super greasy...but I liked them! Let's not split hairs and argue about what the best burger in LA is. There's room for more than just one burger in this city, don't you think? All in all, Umami Burger offers a good burger that I will definitely come back for. Props!

Less is more. Something I sometimes fail to understand. It is so hard to hedge your bets on just a few items rather than 10-15 quasi-right things. Umami's philosophy is very zen in this way. The Truffle Burger's crowning glory was a spatter of truffle cheese and the patty was covered in truffle glaze. It wasn't huge, and we got a total of five onion rings in our order, but what was on the plate was executed in a superb fashion. Like a Rothko at MoMA, there's not a lot going on, but everything seems to be in balance - and it works. I docked off a star though because I felt the menu could be a bit more daring for what they are trying to do. Also, we felt rushed coming in and out of the place. Other than that, this place is a great place to come try some gourmet burgers in LA if you're FO'd out.

Oh Umami...you've made me so sad! Came in for a long-anticipated second visit last week, and was so disappointed. The Port & Stilton burger was good, but definitely didn't have that umami taste to it, and the Manly Burger was somehow also boring and umamiless as well, despite being laden with lardons, bacon and onion strings. My eager taste buds didn't just  yawn...they went into hibernation. Much more disappointing, though, was the service.  I blame the annoying hostess?/general manager? spazz lady who banished us to her evil cave lair of a back room. Most annoyingly, she made us get out of our seats mid-bite and mid-conversation TWICE in order to move the same chair in and out of the space, because she just couldn't decide whether she wanted the chair in the main room. is it me, or is it totally rude to uproot your customers right in the middle of their meal, only because you can't make up your mind about a chair?? She also entertained a (non-paying?) friend in that back room, and brought her buckets of food and wine, while we waited forever to place our order for two burgers and a side. She was happy to stand around chatting, eating and cackling away, but when we flagged her down to politely ask for some mustard, she glared at us and told us to ask our server (who was nowhere to be found...probably cowering in fear), and then told us they didn't have any more. No more mustard?? REALLY?? And since when is it ok for restaurant workers to be eating on the job?? The straw that broke the camel's back was that, although bringing customers mustard was completely beneath her, she had no shame about watching our check like a hawk and swooping down on it as soon as I brought out my credit card. "Let me take that for you," she snapped. The door definitely hit us on the way out.

I don't see what all the fuss is about, sorry. There was something awkward or confusing about going in, I don't remember why, but they pretty much made us sit at this little side bar room which was freezing cold and had TVs playing sports, ugh. The meat (I got lamb) was so salty that was the only discernible flavor, and my burger and bun were so dripping with grease I could barely hold onto it. Fries...did we have fries? I think I blocked them out of memory - fat, flavorless slabs of anemic potato, and a snobby little saucespoon of their homemade ketchup (which you have to pay for more of!) is completely flavorless - like pureed tomato with no salt or seasonings. Onion rings, same deal, dipped in a tempura batter that is totally bland. I was having an awful day and only went because I knew they had beer, which my favorite close-to-home burger place, The Fix, doesn't have, and we were boycotting 8 Oz. at the time. I might be willing to give it another chance (if someone else is paying - yikes!), because possibly my mood colored my impression...but I don't really think so.

I still love the burgers.  However, I am not that in love with the service.  The other day my buddy and I had lunch here.  Our burgers were great (as they usually are) but it was the service that left us with a bad taste. 1) My friend asked for a ginger beer and then our server mistakenly brought ginger ale and when he was corrected he said, "you told me ginger ale".  First of all, I don't care if that is what he said (which it was not),  YOU NEVER tell a paying customer what he/she told you!  It is not a customer service minded attitude. 2)  I asked for garlic aioli for my fries.  When I was down to my last three fries and it was brought to your attention, with an attitude you said, "well, would you like it to go?"   What I would like, queen with the Skecher body-shapers and the tattoo on your calf, is for you to keep your nasty attitude out of Umami and stay in W. Hollywood where you belong.  YOU are service and I am the customer.  While you are flitting about Umami, you might want to keep that in mind!!

UM AMAZING!? I had the Ahi Tuna Burger and it hit the spot. It was delicious, light, but ENOUGH. The piece of tuna was HUGE. I got the sweet potato fries, which were the best I have ever tasted. You can't change or modify your order, which is cool with me. I believe that's how it should be. If you're picky, eat at home! Best burgers, best sides, best sauces. TRY the DIABLO sauce! So spicy and yum! I think I can go to this joint every week and try a new burger each time. It's pricey but so worth it!

The Japanese have this annoying habit of taking things other countries have invented or developed and making them better.  Some examples would include vending machines, home electronics, and sexual deviance.   I can also speak from experience, as I'm half Korean and half Japanese; Korean girls think I'm interesting, not only because my last name is multisyllabic, but also because half of my ancestors raped, pillaged, and murdered the other half of my ancestors, and this gives me an excuse to be moody and dangerous.  Also, I excel at sexual deviance. Unfortunately, I couldn't, with good conscience, entirely believe this theory would be supported by Japan's best efforts to reproduce that staple of American obesity, the hamburger.  I mean, let's face it: aside from Kobayashi and the odd sumo wrestler, the Japanese aren't particularly known for their voracious appetites or corporeal girth.  What the hell would they know about some burgers and fries and junk? Wow, was I ever almost sorta wrong, in a way, kind of!!  I reluctantly ventured into this random burger joint with two of my coworker friends (Jen, a fellow kamikaze, and Alex, of Vietnamese heritage and therefore not unfamiliar with the ways of rape, pillage, and murder himself) who had previously talked up the place.  Being that it was my first time there, I decided I'd go with the traditional Umami Burger, which Jen also ordered, and Alex compensated for his effeminate charms by going with the Manly Burger. I was also thrilled by the availability of Mexican Coke on the menu.  Till then, I'd only had Mexican heroin and Mexican weed, and maybe a little of the meth my roommate Troy cooks up in his closet.  And true to Japanese ingenuity, Umami took it one step further by serving it in liquid form. The burger itself was pretty tasty, I'll grant it that.  Very juicy, pretty flavorful, and the strange, toasted cheese waffle they included in place of normal cheese probably would have made a good snack on its own; someone needs to call the Frito Lay people. Unfortunately, I have to deduct points for the fact that the burger came with no sides.  We didn't even bother with the Jenga-block fries, but we did order a side of pickles, which took some time to arrive because the staff had to "make" them, as we were told, and when they arrived, we discovered that they weren't delicious kosher dills but a sampling of various... pickled things.  They weren't bad, but the whole thing seemed a bit unnecessarily fancy, like the sequins on my pajamas.  The food was also a bit overpriced, in my opinion, for what it was.  Come on, $9 for a burger, a la carte?  Next you'll tell me they sell trucker hats and "vintage" t-shirts for fifty bones apiece at Nordstrom, and people will actually pay for it.  Wait... Speaking of trucker hats, vintage tees, and sequined pajamas, I dipped into the Goodwill across the street and picked up a partially opened bag of second-hand pork rinds for 25 cents, and that helped to satisfy my need for American junk food.  So here's a tip for you: unless you're interested in paying $20 for a meal that should cost about $8, go ahead and make the 2-minute walk to Goodwill instead, and you can still look like a douchebag, but for much less money. The burger was pretty decent though.

Holy hipsters batman. I felt like I was at Loz Feliz Village or Sunset Junction! We showed up for dinner for two at about 9:10pm Saturday. The waiters and busers were overwhelmed by a full house and a short line. We gave our name then sat at an outside cafe table and watched the middle-aged Latinos and Koreans coming-and-going from their nightclub and restaurants, respectively. There was no service at the three outdoor seats. There was also no service at this indoor wall of counter-style seats - I wondered if they were short-staffed... but didn't ask about it. We later moved around to near the front of the line when we noticed the right number of tables had cleared to put us at the top of the list. That's when the list dude realized we weren't on it. He seated us next. Thanks list dude! (All the staff were friendly.) The place *smells* heavenly. We brought our own wine and weren't told of the $5 corkage but didn't care too much. Of course it was twist-top that we opened ourselves. And my glass was dirty on the outside. I noticed some people got plastic cups and others got glasses. Our glasses were hot from the washer and we waited till they reached room temp before pouring our chilled white. I'm guessing the kitchen was a bit overwhelmed too... We ordered the stilton burger and the umami burger, plus onion rings. The burgers were *slightly* too salty. Not like when you eat and at first the item seems very flavorful and later you realize that the heavy salt makes it un-finishable. Thank goodness, because we cleaned our plates! These were definitely fork-and knife burgers as the buns seemed about as supportive as a sheet of paper. The onion rings (I think there were 8, including two tiny ones, for $2.50) had been lightly salted after being removed from the fryer. I couldn't tell if that was great or good. It was one or the other. When we left the restaurant around 10:30pm our bottle of wine was empty and we were the last to leave. The people behind us in line must have eaten fast! All in all, a great addition to the already fantastic LA burger scene. $16ish out the door. These days In-n-Out is $7.50 for burger, animal fries, and a medium drink. So $9 for a fantastic burger and $1.25 each for shared onion rings, and $2.50 each for shared corkage fee, plus tax and $3 each for tip seemed quite alright. I'll definitely go back to try the pork burger and sweet potato chips.

If I could rate individual items, I would give the truffle burger five stars.  It was simple and flavorful and I finished the entire burger (which is pretty uncommon for me).   Everything else, meh.  The fries and onion rings were meh.  My fiance' said his umami burger was meh. I will go back here for the truffle burger alone.

Currently my favorite burger place. Even though I consider myself an adventurous foodie, at the end of the day, there is absolutely nothing that can compare to a cheeseburger and fries. Umami is boutique style, cute, unpretentious. Lovelovelove how the meat is cooked to medium-rare perfection and the extra-crispy fries reminiscent of well-done in n out but in steak fry form. Some may complain that the portion is too small, but I say that sometimes less is more.

I went to Umami Burger due to the high twitter-praise Mr. Dan Trachtenberg gave it.  As I was driving there, I had an idea in my mind for what this place would be like.   It was nothing like I had imagined.  What we got was easily the most uncomfortable dining experience we've ever experienced. While waiting for a table, we decided to just eat at the "bar", which faced a wall: bad idea.  With stools that were too high and a counter that was too low, we eventually managed to sit down.  We place our orders:  Port and Stilton, Umami Burger, SoCal Burger, and the Triple Pork Burger, along with the sides: Hand Cut Fries and Malt Liquor Tempura Onion Rings.   They waiters were all kind of distant and seemed upset at us for no reason. Heads up: we all were quite surprised at the redness of the meat; medium-rare, I believe.  One of us actually couldn't take it and after one bite he had to send it back to have it re-cooked.  They dismantled the burger, put the patty back on the grill and re-assembled the burger once it was done.   "Really, dude?" At any other burger place we've been to, if we would send it back for being undercooked, we would get a whole new burger.  Man-handling and nearly ruining the original burger was extremely disappointing.   I'm not going to lie, while small, the burgers are solid; it's hard to mess up a burger.  Once we finally got around to eating, it seemed like everyone enjoyed their food.   I had the Port and Stilton burger and, judging by everyone else's reactions, I enjoyed my burger the least out of our group.  It was slightly sweet and slightly tart and they pretty much just canceled each other out.   The buns were probably the highlight of the burger: fluffy, tasty and... shiny.   I had one fry, which was more potato than fry; I wouldn't recommend them... all six of them. There's just nothing here that justifies the prices.  It's all just "okay".  The second I stepped foot inside, I had an urge to leave; I wish I had.

Umami totally exceeded my expectations! Good portions...bold flavors. It's definitely categorized as one of those beloved specialty burger places. Pricier than fastfood, but not as expensive as some restaurant burgers. In other words, reasonable! I ordered the Triple Pork Burger and boyfriend had the special Manly Burger [their version of a bacon cheeseburger]. We split them and were both uber satisfied with our orders. Each burger was delicious in its own way and the bacon in the Manly Burger was to die for. The fluffy, buttery bun was so light and was crispy in the right spots. Next time - and there WILL be a next time - we'll give the signature Umami burger a try. My only qualms about this place are that parking isn't too great and the establishment itself isn't very huge. They have this random bar-like room where you can eat but it seems kind of awkward to me. Oh yeah, I'm not a fan of steak fries, so along with the Umami burger, I'd like to try their onion rings. Overall: goooooooooooood!

Tucked away on a busy part of La Brea almost right across from "Leonida's Dancing Cocktails Club," that place looks all kinds of shady by the way, but that's neither here nor there. Once you find Umami Burger you'll notice there's no street parking and they make you valet park ($2.50) if you want to park in their lot. So what is a person to do? Either pay up or drive around until you find some street parking but mind the signs, most of the residential parking is restricted. The second you enter, you'll wonder if you're in the right place, what with the simply designed interior but wait a minute and the aroma will hit you like a ton of properly seasoned beef, a variety of cheeses and a grilled onions! Yeah, you're just where you should be. Order the Truffle Burger, you won't regret it. It's rich, it's savory, it's mouthwatering, it's glorious, but yes, it's a burger, go figure! The Umami Burger is good as well but the ketchup takes away from the overall experience for me, despite it being "umami" homemade ketchup. While I appreciate the wonderfully thoughtful combination of ingredients, the truffle burger ranks supreme in my book, hands down!! If you like burgers and think you've tasted the best-TRY THIS PLACE! If you think In N Out is the best burger ever-TRY THIS PLACE!! If you think (heaven forbid) Carl's or McDonalds is the best burger-TRY THIS PLACE!!! GET THE TRUFFLE BURGER! IT'S A STAFF FAVORITE AS WELL! The thick cut fries were under seasoned and desperately in need some kind of sauce and anything that relies on sauce to make it good cannot be great. But the thin cut fries were stellar!

Lately I have a thing for burger and been trying out different burger joints in town so Umami burger was one of them. The place was small but clean. Its kinda easy to miss even though it on La Brea. I always bypass the area but never notice this restaurant until I discovered on yelp.  There're valet guys for this restaurant, Wow! The meat was cooked to perfection and the meat was definitely FRESH. Mushrooms, Tomatoes  and Grilled Cheese all worked perfectly with the burger itself.  The vinaigrette also enhance the beef patty's taste. Their fries are pretty good too.  I ordered the big chunky steak fries but next time I will try their regular fries. I realized many people visiting here are the first timers and been recommended by yelp.  My only gripe for this place is that the portion is quite small for the price that we are paying.

Umami Burger reminds me of why I like meat and why my belly folds over the waist of my pantaloons creating a phenomenal muffin top. We were in and out in no time. Service was direct and to the point. The menu was very much the same. I have enough decisions to make in my life, I like that they keep it simple and worry free. Had a sampling of the signature umami burger, the hatch burger and the triple pork burger. Sides included sweet potato fries, thick cut fries and the tempura onion rings. The meat patties were well seasoned, tender, juicy, savory and quite decadent. A larger burger would have been a bit much. The serving size is actually quite perfect, it even satisfied the voracious appetite of my ogre friend. Really liked all the burgers, the Umami is an excellent signature selection and should be seriously considered if you're a virginal visitor to Umami Burger. The triple pork was uber-meaty and had a slightly heftier quality. I wasn't a big fan of the thick cut fries, kinda tasted like raw potato to me. Overall, a fairly delightful experience. Probably about $15 per person and money well spent. Bravo Umami, you have successfully lived up to your name and exceeded my expectations.

I came with a large party so I was fortunate enough to try everything. The absolute must is of course, the Umami burger. It's unique enough to be the "it" burger of Umami-- I really liked the mushroom and the parmesan crisp. Everything else was not necessarily special, but decent nonetheless. I liked the fries, sweet potato fries, the onion rings, and the smushed potatoes. The best would be the smushed potatoes, which are apparently fried twice, making them different from everywhere else. Service brought the experience down for me. Our server tried to be fun and joke around with us, which was fine, but he failed to deliver on his promises. He said that he would bring out extra condiments for the whole table, which he never did, and a order of onion rings came out moments before the bill. I really wanted to try the house-made sauces but never got to do so. Also, I felt iffy about Umami's presentation. It seems really sad to have such an interesting burger unceremoniously plated on a white rectangular plate. To make matters worse, the plate is too big for the burger, which makes the burger seem every tinier. They should either wrap the burger (even In-n-out style would suffice), or add some pickles/ condiments on the side. Come on people! Probably wouldn't come back again just because of the sheer number of burger places around LA.

Of all the gourmet burger places I've tried, Umami stands dead last. Their burgers are very small. My bf got two burgers and was still not full. Their fries are just okay. Their sweet potato fries were served cold to us. The best part of this side was that their sauce was served on a cute spoon. Way too pricey for a itty bitty burger and mediocre sides. I tried their Veggie burger and it was just mediocre and not too flavorful. I liked the texture of the beans and that it tasted healthy but it was on the mushy side. For an hour wait, I expected much better food. Try Umami if you must but don't expect much.

Came in on a Wednesday night with my sister, and there was a 10-15 minute wait, so not too bad. Ordered the truffle burger - SOO GOOD. So noms. Also ordered the malt liquor onion rings. They're pretty good, but really, only 5 rings per order? That's not really much of an appetizer. Didn't know that burgers should be medium rare to get the full flavor, so that's definitely one thing I learned. And w00t for Mexican coke! I just like different beverages. The seating area is kinda awkward, it's like a coffee bar setting with a random table in the middle. That's cool, I guess. (What is it with these type of restaurant, with interesting and pricey items, not a lot of food in these small places? Very LA...)

Friends took me here one day after work and I have to say I'm really thankful! =). I love burgers, often I crave burgers more than steak. So here is the breakdown: These burgers are some of the best around, they are expensive but you truly get what you pay for. --If you want a cheap good burger than go to In N' Out. --If you want a good burger with dry-aged beef and a delicious mixture of toppings to give it a mix-up of flavors then go to Father's Office. --If you want one of the purest tasting burgers where you can truly taste the meat instead of it getting lost in the toppings then come here and get the Truffle Burger. The other stuff on the menu are nice, but the Truffle Burger is truly what makes this place special and unique and makes me happy that there are plenty of cows around.

I was really craving Umami Burger after watching Giada from the Foodnet Work raving about how tasty their signature burger is. So, came here the very next day. The restaurant's small and cozy, but luckily we didn't have to wait. Ordered the Umami Burger($9) and Skinny Fries($3.5). The burger was juicy and flavorful, the buns were soft and buttery, the fries were nothing special. The portions were kinda small, so personally I consider this as a snack. For the prices, portions, distance and valet, I probably won't be coming back here too often.

My last post on Yelp was over two years ago but I can't help recounting this complete and utter FAIL. I've been curious about Umami Burger for some time now, but being from Orange County my friend and I rarely find ourselves in LA for lunch.  Since we were in the area, we couldn't pass up the opportunity to finally sit down and see what all the hype was about.   12:45 - Sat down and ordered drinks 12:50 - Drinks arrived and placed food order 1:15 - After being left alone for 20 minutes we finally get our waitress' attention to ask about the delay to which her response was "the kitchen is busy" and that our food will come "soon" Personally I suspect our waitress forgot to put in our order.  I would have been less upset had she just admitted to the mistake and gave us an updated wait time.  Instead no apologies and a completely unsatisfactory explanation for the delay.  Of course the kitchen was busy, it was lunchtime.  Does this mean service times go to hell in a hand basket on a daily basis at this time? 1:20 - Table next to us who arrived ten minutes after we did gets their order Now we get fed some line about how the ordering system sometimes prints tickets out of order.  I might have bought that had their order been placed around the same time as ours rather than 10 minutes later. 1:25 - Time to cut our losses and head back to work Again, no apology when I ask our waitress to cancel the order, just an indifferent shrug. In the end we were reduced to picking up some Carl's Jr before heading back to work.  I doubt I'll be trying Umami burger for a good long time if ever after this experience.

I wish I could give this place 3.5 stars. Last week I got to try Umami, after a failed attempt a couple of months back (They don't take rezzis). While waiting to be seated, we practically molested other diners, drooling over their burgers and onion rings. Watching other people eat made me even hungrier! What didn't make me hungry, though, were the thick fries. I mean, I'd never had them, but they did NOT look good. We ended up ordering them anyway... (thinner cut ones though) What I had: 1. SoCal Burger: Amazing. Perfectly cooked and the perfect size. The bread was slightly sweet. The one con was that burger was so effing greasy, it made the bun soggy towards the end and I felt like I'd straight up soaked my fingers in tub of oil. But then again, that kinda defines a good burger, so... 2. Malt Liquor Tempura Onion Rings: The first ring is amazing, then it's downhill from there. They are just so damn greasy. 3. Hand Cut Fries: Eh. As tasty as it looks. This place was definitely worth trying. The burger was great, but I've had better onion rings and fries. Skipped dessert because a friend said it wasn't that great, and got my fix at Yogurtland. Yeah-Yuhhh!

I love Umami burger!  Whenever I come here, I realize how American I've become because seriously...WHERE'S THE SUPER SIZE OPTION?  I really wish that their burgers came a bit larger, and their sides with bigger servings. My other gripe: even fast food chains give me as much condiments as I'd like...how do you expect me to dip my sweet potato fries in a SPOONFUL worth of sauce?  It's cruelty I tell you... I prefer this La Brea location over Hollywood because it's much more convenient to park.  If you want to avoid the crowds, show up soon as they open!

For me, the quest for the best burger in Los Angeles has stopped here at Umami Burger. I have a lot of burgers in this town and this is the best. I had half a Umami burger and half of the truffle burger and liked the latter much better. The truffle burger is so rich that after a bite I thought I was done. But I kept going and going through this juicy, flavorful burger til sadly there was nothing left. The Umami burger is equally cooked and season to perfection and I liked the parmesean crisp that gave it a surprising crunch. Also had the fries which were thick and fried 3 times so the edges have a nice crisp while the insides are nice and moist. And the beet salad was something that is a meal onto itself. The sodas are all sugar cane based so no corn syrup and you can taste the difference. It was a nice treat to head into this place and I plan to back again and again.

Ugh. Worst burger I have ever had, and I LOVE burgers. First of all, it was really small and cost over $9. No sides or anything either. $9 for a TINY hamburger you guys. So that part sucked, then the burgers came and mine was so rare that the sides of the burger patty were red and blood was dripping out. The bottom bun was completely soaked with grease and blood. I had to send it back to the kitchen to have it actually cooked and they brought it back out on the same nasty wet soggy bun! The blood bun! Really???? I attempted to eat my burger and when I picked it up the soggy bottom bun just flopped over. I ate the meat and left the disgusting blood bread on the plate. The meat was pretty good after it was cooked but I will never go back. We also ordered some sides, (this location does NOT have the sweet potato fries so they lose points for that). We got regular old fries (they were fine, not spectacular) which came with "Umami Ketchup", which was just ketchup with soy sauce in it and it was gross. If you want extra ketchup, you get CHARGED...for ketchup, seriously. We also ordered the Onion Rings and they were so oily and bland. It is hard to eff up an onion ring so CONGRATS UMAMI BURGER! YOU DID IT! Also, it is in a tiny little shopping center with about 2 other shops I think and there is a tiny parking lot of about 20 spots, but you HAVE TO VALET. You can see your car about 15 yards away while you are sitting in the restaurant, but when you want to go leave, you have to stand there and watch the valet boy find your keys then walk 5 yards and get your car, which you would have been able to do yourself and not have had to wait for the boy and not have had to pay $3 for that. The whole experience was just completely stupid. Why do people think this place is good??? Because those people fall into the trap that is TREND.

Stopped Sunday at dusk after my makeover at Sephora. Obviously a good spot because there was a bit of a wait. It was my first time so I did not know there was Vallet parking so I parked up the street. I ordered the Hatch burger recommended by Jeff.  Great suggestion! Green Chili & the house cheese (reminded me of pepper jack). The buns were original. I usually only eat half of the bun but this was good. No skimping on the cheese here, but at 10$ I would hope not. Worth the money. Juicy burger great flavor. Maybe next I will try a side or some fries. Not this time though. Friendly and Clean. Excellent service. I would go again if I were in the neighborhood.

3.5 rating. Tried it for the first time after hearing about it. 11-12 dollars for a burger that is smaller than a Big Mac?? I'm not so sure I'd like to pay for that in the future. $3.50 for reg fries? Umm, don't think I would want to pay for that again either. Other than the prices, I'd say to burger wasn't that bad. I had the Turkey Avocado burger. Pretty tasty, I felt a little healthier by choosing the turkey meat over the pork or beef. Definitely less greasier than the others I tried. I think if the pricing was better for the size of the burger, I'd give it a better rating. 4 stars for taste - .5 star for price = 3.5 overall

If you love burgers and you've never been to Umami- hurry up and get in here!!  Umami is perhaps my favorite burger spot in LA.  Seriously every burger is totally delicious, and they often carry specials not featured on their regular menu. Being the creature of habit that I am, I always order the Hatch Burger and hope my companion offers me a bite of theirs to try, which actually never happens now that I think about it...   They have the yummiest salads!  The truffle beet  salad or Japanese Caprese salad is the perfect starter to share.  Plus its somewhat  healthy as to take some of the guilt off of the amazing burger I'm about to inhale.   I should mention Umami carries ice cream sandwiches from Milk.  I have to recommend you finish this gourmet happy meal with an ice cream sandwich... because if your gonna fall off your diet, well, it might as well be for Umami.   * Mental note: Wait is often crazy long, but always worth it...

The first thing that came to mind when coming here was, "oooOOOOooo! FANCY BURGER JOINT!'' I came here on a rainy romantic date with my 'boy toy', and upon ordering, i notice that sides aren't included with the burger. I thought; "CHEAP ASSES!!!!" Lucky for them i wasn't that hungry so i only order the onion rings. My Boy toy orders the Portabello burger and he wanted to substitute some of the items for veggies, the waiter said; "Sorry at this time we aren't allowing substitutions''. WTF?? WHY NOT??? IF A BURGER COST $10 BUCKS... THROW SOME GOLD IN THERE! its the least they could do. So we order fries, onion rings, and the burger. Once we get the food i wonder, why the hell it shrunk in the process. I tried the onion rings, and the batter that they use is good but i feel it retains too much grease. (YES, I DO UNDERSTAND ITS DEEP FRIED) but still. I had a bite of the burger and it was really yummy, but really greasy. At the end of the night my tummy was all gassy from too much grease, NO BUENO! :( I liked the food, but... it wasn't filling and it wasn't great. For $20 bucks... we didn't walk out full, because apparently they only give you 5 onion rings in 1 order! Yes, i know I'm a fatty :(

My husband and I don't usually go out on Saturday night.  We would rather go on a Tuesday night when everyone else is at home. But this Saturday we found ourselves out...and hungry.  So after the Culver City art crawl, Umami Burger popped into my head and we headed down Venice Blvd to La Brea. 10 minutes later we were greeted by a nice enough guy who sat us, "over here" or "over here".  There was DJ.  And after about 5 minutes of sitting before anyone brought us a menu (there were only 2 other tables in there at the time) my man says, "I think I would prefer a 2nd server over the DJ."  But, alas, they've just opened and I think they are still working out some kinks.   Now to the food, apart from being out of the French Fries (what?!) the food was good.  We tried 4 of the burgers.  We're pigs.  My fave was the Umami Burger, but the Port & Blue and Pork burger were a close second.  The Cali Burger was not as good - but maybe after a certain amount of Umami the palate is dulled.  The pickles were AWESOME!  You have to ask for them though. When we ordered our second round of burgers the guys there seemed to think we were a lot cooler than when arrived. It's a cool joint.  If you like restaurant burgers, try it.  I'm sure we'll be back.

**** 2.5 Stars **** I swear I thought I made a review for this place..Odd. To make it short. It's not worth the price, it's good, but very "LA HYPE". It's extremely expensive - and believe me, I'm not cheap. The fries were overpriced, the waiter was apathetic, but the bartender was very nice at the location I went to. The burger does have flavor, it is savory, and they make the portion very small you know ...It looked like those attempts to look "Fancy" with those psuedo, post-modern plates and shit trying to amp it up more than what it really was. It's not like GOOD burgers are hard to come by. Go for the experience, and realize it's mediocre. That's how it was for me. There's a lot more places to go to for the money.

I heard so much hype about this place that I had to check it out. Loved the truffle burger! Very juicy and oozing with garlicky goodness and the sweet bun was delicious! Tried the tempura beer battered onion rings. Also yummy but for $3 you only get 5 rings...and they were extremely oiley that I needed TWO napkins for my meal. I couldn't skip dessert so we ordered one of Milk's ice cream sandwiches. It was made of two red velvet macarons with vanilla ice cream in the middle dipped in white chocolate!!! Woweee!! French macarons alone are my fave but this combo was enough to keep me coming back!

Umami burger! Finally... what can I say? I'm not a big fan of mushrooms so their classic Umami burger, is a big no no for me.  So I decided to try the Truffle Burger cause a friend recommended it to me. OMG it was quite tasteful and delicious! The fact that the meat is medium-rare, it was super juicy and with the cheese ooozing out, was glorious.  Their sweet potato fries were "ok" and fries were good (can't go wrong with that).  I'd come here again for that Truffle burger... Note: Its valet parking and long waits if you come during peak hours.  So make sure to ask the valet guy how long the wait is, before you park for valet service! Also, there is NO ALCOHOL served at this location. Just a heads up!

Umami is very solid but the burgers really need to be bigger.  These are like little appetizers.  That being said, they ARE delicious so it's tough to rate this any lower than 4 stars.  You can always fill up on the little side dishes they have and you should absolutely try the ice-cream cookie sandwich.  Pretty strong...although not sure how you can screw that one up.  Oh yeah - this place's food is better than 8oz burger...but at least 8 oz burger has a full bar.   Finally...you gotta love the cups they serve their drinks in.  They are plastic, circular and have a thumb indentation spot that is pretty exciting.  I know that has nothing to do with the food - but if you can't get excited about plastic cups with thumb indentations...there is something wrong with you.   Definitely go to Umami burger...but order two burgers unless you are a ninny.

Best burger in LA?.... Hardly! Came here on aSaturday night and the wait wasn't too bad--about half an hour.  I had the umami burger which comes with mushrooms and what tasted like sundried tomatoes (not my fav) my husband aka Skitty had the manly burger and judging by the size of it it was more like a sissy burger. Out of the two the sis-manly burger was the better tasting one. Like other yelpers have said the sweet potato fries are the standout here. The brown sugar and cinnamon they put on top really bring out the flavor. They paired the fries with a red sauce that tasted weird to me-kinda like a cocktail sauce of sorts. Try dipping them in the jalapeño ranch sauce instead. Oh and if you order the diet coke it come in a kiddie sized bottle which apperantly is the only size the diet comes in. This is also the only umami location that does not serve alcohol. As a side note, parking can be tough in the area but valet here is only 2.50, which beats driving around endlessly trying to find that one spot.

i dont know what happened but i was blown away by the manly burger during my 2nd visit to umami (the first time i went, i wasnt very impressed at all but i ordered the umami burger then). the sweetness of the bread combined with the cripsy onion rings was delicious! i'm not a huge mustard fan so i got that on the side. definitely order the sweet potato fries,it was fried to the perfect texture and sprinkled with brown sugar :p i went on a monday night and waited 20 minutes for a table for 5. the place is on the smaller side so call ahead to see what the wait looks like.

So many reviews for this place, Eh? Let's make this short and simple. Parking here really stinks. Lines are long. Service is mediocre. How about the burgers!? After my first bite of the umami burger (I kept calling it the unami burger but no one corrected me on this) I was speechless. It wasn't bad. But it wasn't good. It was A-OK. I was expecting to be totally mind f*cked BLEEP woops, but it wasn't like that at all. This burger is something my mother would make if she did make burgers. It has this Asian, tomato-like soupy taste to it. But I guess it's one of the things you should at least try once, you know, so you can yelp about it!

Hmm came here on a whim cause we were in the area.. Waited mm 15 minutes for seating.. A little hard to find considering it was tucked in a store area.. Nonetheless we sat down outside. Ordered beer and my usual drink.. It was alrite.. My drink was not worth the money :( Ok so the food. I had the traditional Unami burger and cheesy taters. My bf had the manly burger and sweet potato fries. The food came quickly and so we split the two burgers.. O M G the manly burger had onions and I ate them and I hateeeeee onions!! The burgers were pretty small but it was definately delicious :) definitely coming back!!

Gourmet burgers are just about as common as fast food joints these days. What to expect? Quality meat , great buns, and bursting flavors/toppings. This place gets 3 1/2 stars. The Umami burger was good, no complaints there, but the SoCal burger needs more flavor and less grease. The sweet potato fries were ok. Ten bucks each, depending on the mood most may still opt for In N' Out. But worth a try or two...

Finally get to take this one off my bookmark list! I had high expectations for this place coming in, so I was really surprised that I wasn't disappointed (make sense?) I ordered the manly burger and the boyfriend ordered the Umami burger. At first he wanted to switch (must be that machismo), but it didn't matter anyway because we cut them in half and switched. All of the other tables around us had the same idea so I suggest doing the same if you want to try more of the burgers. The Umami burger was definitely the winner with its dripping juices from the patty being absorbed into the bun (might be gross for some, but worked with this burger), a thin layer of crispy cheese that I was skeptical about, but the crunch definitely complemented the rest of the burger's mushiness. The manly burger was not as juicy and the bacon pieces were too chunky for my liking. I would have preferred thin bacon slices. Its redeeming factor was the traditional melted cheddar cheese, and I loooove cheesy burgers. These burgers are more filling than they look. Well portioned: get a burger and share a side with someone and you will be satisfied but not overly stuffed. The onion rings were good, but everyone else seemed to have ordered the hand-cut fries so uhh, I say get those. Probably will not be back. This is more of a one-time experience.

UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUmami!!!  Ooooh, I'm telling your mommy you came here and didn't bring her!!!   First timers better try the Umami burger as I did this past weekend!  The bun sets it apart from other burgers, as well as, the array of unique flavors which tingle your taste buds!!  I also tried the Manly burger and a bite of the Truffle burger; Umami takes the lead in my book!  One of the servers said his fav was the Hatch burger with 4 different types of green chili!  Oooh, I gotta try that one since I love me some spice!!  We also had the fries, tater-tots and onion rings - they were ok.  The different dipping sauces they brought out were cool, loved the garlic one!   I didn't mind the 1.5 hour wait, we did have a party of 12!   It was generous of them to bring out heaters since we were freezing our as*!# off outside!   Ok, Umami, time to open up OC locations!!

Okay. I guess I just missed the boat on this one. Being from Chicago, I'm a burger kind of guy and always find myself casting a suspicious eye on anything that slaps the modifier "gourmet" on itself, which usually translates to less food for more dough. LA is littered with these "chic" restaurants and bars that seem to be selling more an image than actual good food or service, and I'm afraid that's what experience  at Umami turned out to be. It doesn't help  when the group I was with kept calling Umami "The BEST BURGER IN THE WORLD" which is dangerous hyperbole for a kid who grew up in one of the greasy food capitals of the world. It took 45 minutes to get a seat and when we did the service was fleeting at best. The menu was simple enough, which was refreshing, but nothing really jumped out at me and when I ordered the SoCal burger I found the server kept pushing me  to order the slightly more expensive Truffle Burger, which I refused but the rest of my party agreed to do. It's a personal thing, but I'm not a fan of members of the wait staff "pushing something" unless directly asked. The biggest let down was when the burgers came, for a double digit price tag, you'd just expect more. Yet, it's okay, you figure that it's small but probably packs a wallop in flavor, which was strike number two cause it tasted just like any other burger, just with a lot of shit stuffed in it, plus they also over did my patty. It was somewhere after the fifth time I had to ask for more water that I decided I probably wouldn't be returning, but judging from the size of the patronage and the line going out in the street and blocking traffic, I don't think they'll be missing my business. I suggest that if you're ready and willing to drop $12 bucks on a "chic" burger I highly recommend either Father's Office or the Counter, both of which not only meet burger expectations but exceed them... And let's never forget, this is the land of In-N-Out.

My friend Evan put it perfectly: "Food wins, Service loses. Did I get a amazing burger? Yes! Did my server huff glue before approaching our table? Probably. WIll I go back? Yes." 4.5 for awesomely tasty & unique burgers. -2 for service. ALL IN ALL: Awesome food, shitty service (so far...only been once) If you're onn/near La Brea. Go. Service: really, really bad. Yes it was semi-packed, but yes there are 8 tables, between 3 people. on a Sunday. It's not hard to check in with us every 15 minutes, or maybe get us water after you ask us what we want to drink. both servers were very inefficient and out of it. even with the manager(owner?) there. Ambiance: nothing special- not bad, just nothing fancy. simple. decent bathroom. Food: awesome. such succulent burgers. the MANLY BURGER is what I got, and what you should DEFINITELY try when you go. so awesome. just so filling (for ingredients check out someone else's post, it's been posted a bunch of times). And how is it VS. 25 Degrees you ask? 25 is a little pricier but all in all I'd rather go to 25 degrees- though it depends on the situation. Umami is a lot less frills in terms of environment, and not 24 hrs. Foods about the same quality, maybe a little bit better ingredients at umami, but not as much variation. TIPS: -so even though you're like, how can i survive off of 8-10 fries? the burgers are so filling, that you really don't need much more. 3 girls and I shared one thing of onion rings and one thing of fries and we were all very satisfied. -you might want to bring your own ketchup & bbq sauce. their ketchup is sort of weird, albeit homemade -there's no diet coke. so uh, byodc? too. -there's a liquor store caddy corner to it- so if you forget to bring booze, there is a booze outlet conveniently placed.

So they are new - here are the pros and cons... Pros: Creative and yummy burgers  - a break from the norm/uber gourmet burger. Decent Prices Mexican coke! BYOB w/NO corkage Cons: Disorganized - our table was given away once, making us wait 30 more minutes for a table - almost given away twice. They def need a host. Tiny. Almost as small as Osteria La Buca when they first opened. They don't write your order down - I had to ask for water 5 times (finally got it) and pickles 6 times (never did get those pickles) Little to no parking. All in all, yummy food but not worth all the hassle. 2 stars.

Minus the fact that we had to wait far too long for a table (this place is NOT the best plan for groups bigger than oh... 2...), the friendly staff and tasty food made me forget those 30 minutes of idleness.  The onion rings (battered in beer tempura,  I believe), fries, and California burger were delicious, and the bun was inexplicably awesome.  Coke from Mexico with no corn syrup?  Yes,  please!  Delicious cream soda (a brand I'd never heard of)? Holy cow -- freakin' good.  And don't forget the Umami-made ketchup... I don't really know how you vary this condiment but they've done it. I'll venture to say that this is really the best burger I've had in LA.  Better than The Counter, Apple Pan, or Father's Office.

Best burger ever! Gotta try the truffle or umami burger and the tater tots. Omnomnom... I've been back to Umami more times in the past 6 months than any other burger place (in & out included) and  i am always blown away. You can't go wrong with the Umami Burger. The Manly burger is pretty impressive, but i'd opt for some of the other options. The Umami Square is flat out crazyness and the truffle burger will rock your mouth with flavor. It will change your world.

Just a heads up:  Umami Burger is no longer BYOB.  Went there a few weeks ago and was told they're "not allowed to" anymore.  So if you're saving that delicious bottle of Cabernet for a night out at Umami, you're out of luck. For what it's worth, I like this place well enough.  It's in my neighborhood and the burgers are good.  But I still can't get over how their side dishes fall flat: The onion rings are always too greasy for me, the fries too mealy and thick (I mean, In-n-Out runs circles around these fries!  In-n-Out!).  And at about $10/burger, without the added value of BYOB, I'm not sure I'll come back here all that often now.

Soooo Gooood! Service - Got there at 6:30pm on a Sunday.  Parked on La Brea walked in seated for 2 right away at the table in the weird side room.  Service was friendly and quick.  5 Stars for service, but I could totally see this place being a zoo on other days, as I got lucky with timing. Food - Soooo Good.  Umami has locked itself  in my Top 5 (could possibly be #1 on some days).  I will never claim any burger in a LA to be my favorite as there are different burgers for different moods and days.  I like Father's Office, but that got the boot to my 6-10 range along with FatBurger after this meal.  Just so you can gauge my taste, here is my top 5 in no order: Umami, 25 Degrees, In N Out, Laurel Tavern and Carneys/Tommys (They count as one to me).  Between the 2 of us we order the following to split each: -Umami Burger -Manly Burger -Pork Belly -Lamb Special Burger -Tempura Onion Rings I can't even pick a favorite as they were all soo good from the buttery Challah-like bun to the most juicy and flavorful patty and quality toppings.  The burgers are a little small if you are going there to get one burger, which makes the place pricey.  But on a cost to taste ratio the price is definitely worth it.  I don't know what they do, but there is something special and unique about these burger, while still being a semi traditional burger.  I definitely recommend going with friends and splitting burgers so you can get a good variety.  I split 4 between 2 people, but I think a normal person would be good splitting 3 between 2 people. This place has only been open for 7 months and is already an LA staple.  Word is they are expanding around LA.  Look out for an Umami near you.  Once again, "Soooo Good".

In a word- Overpriced. I did take-out and am glad I did.  I can't see eating in here.  There is no ambiance.  There is one tiny room when you walk in, with the cash register at the far end.  Very brightly lit.  There is a second room with one table for two and a counter around the wall with chairs.  It's way too dark in there.   I tried the Port & Stilton burger.  Great meat, medium-rare.  There are no other garnishes on the burger save for the cheese & onions.   It could have more cheese, IMO.  I wasn't crazy about the buns. The onion rings were okay.  Slightly oily, but not too heavy on the batter.  You get four large-sized rings for $2.50.  Deal?  Or no deal? Finally, desserts by Cake Monkey.  Yes, a red velvet take on a Ring Ding is a great concept.  And it tasted delicious.  But $4 for a two-bite cake?   Yes, it was good, but I don't know if it's worth another visit. One tip: get there right at 7:00 pm on weekdays and you should be able to find parking on La Brea.  That's when the rush hour lane closes and you can pull up almost in front of the place.

Went here for dinner on a Saturday night and the place was definitely not crowded at all--got seated immediately and ordered the umami burger, truffle burger, and sweet potato fries with a side of roasted garlic aioli sauce, and received our food a few minutes later. First of all, their soft and round hamburger buns are so cute. haha - Umami burger- Meh. I wasn't feeling the sweet sauce and didn't find it special at all. - Truffle burger with Italian truffle cheese and truffle glaze- YUM! Definitely recommend getting this one instead. It's something about the truffles....like crack... - Sweet potato fries- Normal. Nothing special but nothing bad. The garlic aioli was a nice compliment but I felt kinda gross afterward because it was pretty much straight butter haha Total: $32 inc tax & tip Over all, glad I tried it and next time I'm back I'll try the earth burger (mushroom and edemame patty, white soy and truffle aioli, ricotta cheese..ok must stop drooling).

Wow, so inferior to my last Umami burger experience.  This is a different location than my previous review and the food was average, a little greasy.  The burgers lacked the perfection of the other location, instead arriving larger, greasier and sloppier than the other place.   The staff have an air about them like a defeated prizefighter, cocky but depressed - although nice, for sure.  We sat in the cryogenic suspension corner.  Much like the delicacy in which our food was prepared, so too were we handled in the creature comfort department.  Cramped into a cold corner with expensive hamburgers and no beer.  Too bad.  Shame on you, Umami

REALLY enjoyed my burger (and also many bites of my friend's burger). sorry, can't remember which we ordered, just that they're both really good. also, had an ice cream sandwich for dessert (which they bring in from Milk). they get extra points for bringing in one of my favorite desserts. while eating: this 15 year old kid was in there ordering food to-go. as he was getting rung up, he in a smart-a**-sort-of-way said to the waiter "online everyone's saying how crappy your service is here"- presumably referring to yelp. then chuckled and kind of wandered off. the dude ringing him up, laughed uncomfortably and told him to "get outta here". it was pretty funny to witness. service IS a bit slow/bumpy, and the owner (or whoever, who was a total john fauvre look-alike) was there and seemed nervous and overbearing. mostly, i enjoyed my burger/food/dining experience. wish the place were bigger. can't wait to go again.

Perfectly small portion and as juicy as it gets!   I don't eat burgers.  I don't eat red meat.  But I'll get their umami burger for $10 any day!   The thick meat patty burger has grilled tomatoes and thinly sliced deep fried cheese.  And that's all you need to get this burger going.  They'll introduce you to their special Kawaiian burger and whatnot but don't listen to them!  If this is your first time, just go and get their umami burger.  Period.   They're also known for their pickled plate that came with 4 different types of pickles, sweet radish and kimchi.  Not a pickle fan either but even their pickles were delicious!  But eh, their kimchi sucks.   We also got their sweet potato fries and french fries that came with a spoon of home-made ketchup.  It was good.   Valet parking - $2.50.   Service - fast and friendly! I totally recommend this place to everyone!

Is it good. Yes? But best burger in America, GQ Magazine? Don't be silly. The first time I went I had the Umami Burger. I didn't know that the sauce on the Umami Burger was sweet and I generally stray away from sweet things on my savory foods, so it was doomed from the beginning. I chalk this one up to my bad though and since it wasn't that, I decided to give it another try. The second time I went I had the Hatch burger. Call me crazy but I think if you advertise that a burger has chilis on it, you should put enough on there so that people can taste it. Frankly alll I tasted was cheese and the burger. The beef was quality but seriously can anyone say with a straight face that this burger (and I mean just the meat) is more juicy than say the Father's Office? I can't. I'll say the bun was good though. Nice crisp on the bottom and pillowy throughout the rest.

After reading so many glowing yelp reports on the burgers at Umami my husband and I were really looking forward to having dinner there. First things first, the burgers we were eventually served, were delicious. Cooked to perfection, simple yet tasty and very juicy.  However, the service was so bad we felt like asking where the cameras were hidden! The two anti-waiters working there will forever be know to us as Simple Simon and bitchy camp dude. After a 30-minute wait outside, which we used to ponder the menu we were seated. We both wanted to try the restaurant's signature burger because of the rave reviews it's been getting and of course the onion rings and fries. It would have been nice, before we'd set our sights on those things to be told that out of those 3 items, they only had the onion rings. Our waiter, bitchy camp dude informed us of this news and somehow made it seems as though we were nuts for even wanting fries in a hamburger joint. Anyway, after ordering the Truffle Burger and the Port and Stilton Burger we then waited 40-minutes for the food to arrive. During that time we witnessed multiple order screw-ups by simple Simon and rudeness to customers by bitchy camp dude. Tables were free and people weren't being seated and at least 7 customers gave up waiting.   By the time the burgers arrived there was too much pressure for them to be out of this world - to make up for the shocking service. They were good, very good but tainted by the uncomfortable atmosphere created by so many disgruntled patrons. Yummy burgers but not worth the wait ...unless you get a kick out of watching crap waiters at work.

For a so called "Best Burger Place in Town", this place falls miles short of that. I went there with a party of 4, and we had to wait outside in the parking lot for about 30 minutes before they attended us. Once they did, the burger selection was very small. They had about 4-5 types of burgers to choose from. We all specifically ordered the meat a certain way done (well, medium, well done, etc. ). The waiter seemed very slow and unsure what to do. It also took long for service to arrive at our table. So after a long wait to get them back, we all had our meat cooked the same way. It was disappointing. Burgers are sold separate from the fries and they do not serve alcohol. This place is very over priced and most of all, over hyped. Its location is the only "trendy" thing about it. One visit is enough.

As a burger guy who has taken on several challenging burgers this place is not for me. The price is ridiculous for the size of burger. I will not name drop other places, but you can surely get the same taste in a bigger portion for the same price somewhere else, and the size of plate doesn't help the cause. It was so bad, that my group left hungry and wanting to go one of the food stands nearby. I will definitely stick to my instincts and stay away from places like these. However, if you like chic and trendy places this is definitely your spot. Don't have a big apetite and like to over pay for food then this is the spot. Only thing I'll give them was the smushed potatoes, thats all.

Everyone that I've spoke to about Umami Burger says that they love it, and if they've never been they've only heard great things about it and want to eat there. And this place really is a place that people go to just to say you've eaten here. While we were waiting for our food, there was another couple who only went because of word of mouth. So I thought I'd try it out for myself and see what the hype was all about... Here's what I thought: The Negatives: - Small parking lot (It's valet $2 weekdays), but there is street parking 1 hour meter free on the Umami Side after a certain time... - Small restaurant (with a small patio outside) Maybe total 50 peeps, so there is waiting involved. The Positives: - Burgers (It's not all the hype, but still good, it compares to Father's Office) - Take out (A great alternative to waiting for seats when it's busy.. hey my car is as comfortable as their chairs) - Service (apologetic to the fact that there was a 20 minute wait @ 9:30Pm for seating for 2 because they were waiting for a group of 6.... wait don't they close at 10PM?) I will say though the pluses on their burger was that it was perfectly cooked medium rare and the toppings were a great addition to their beef. Total price for two people: 2 Burgers ($18), 1 order of Tempura Onion Rings ($2.50), telling people you've been to Umami Burger: Priceless. Stop by just to stop by, but I don't think I'll go again unless I've on that side of the neighborhood. Or if I'm on my way to Lucy's :D Enjoy!

I had an appointment on Wilshire this afternoon and decided to stop by Umami Burger on my way home.  Lucky it was an off hour because their parking lot is very small and it is shared with other businesses. I ordered the signature Umami Burger for $9 and the Manly Burger for $10.  When I got home and tried both of them, I thought they were both very tasty even though they are on the small side.  The Umami Burger is definitely very unique.  I enjoyed both burgers more than the ones at Father's Office and 8 oz. Burger Bar. In short, I would come back when I'm in the area and try some of Umami's other burgers.  I think the hype is justified...

How often do you hear "___ has the BEST burger!  you MUST try it!"?  Well, I seem to hear it all the time.  In fact, I think I've tried almost every burger joint between LA and NY after hearing those encouraging words.  In LA, you hear about Father's Office and 8oz Burgers, and once upon a time we even had Burger 90210.  Well, I must admit that I have finally tried the best burger in LA.  Yes, it's true...Umami Burger officially has taken the top spot in LA for having the most delicious, juicy, and perfectly stupendous burger. Umami is defined as being the 5th flavor profile...if that flavor is awesomeness.  My god, the burger was cooked to perfection...slightly juicy, and with just the right amount of pink, carefully prepared with the grilled onion, umami ketchup, parmesan crisp, and the mushrooms.  Let's also not forget about the thrice cooked fries, which apparently are blanched, baked, then fried to perfection and sprinkled with some truffle salt.  So moist yet crisp. If you haven't been to Umami yet, then you need to clear your calendar and get your ass in there.  Also, I would suggest trying the Umami Burger for your first try, then venture onto the other selections on the menu.  Also, don't forget the fries.

I honestly don't know how to accurately and properly describe my Umami burger experience. Boss took us there for lunch--and Oyee-voy-indeed did I get my Umami experience :D It has to be by far one of the best burgers I've had--topping The Counter by far. I had the Umami burger, and the meat was perfect, altho juicy so it does get messy, and just the sauce! whatever it is a great mix of tomato, mushroom, crispy layer of something, pickles? I actually have no idea what they put in there, but it sure was good ! We had to share: thick fries, thin fries, and onion rings - and I'm stuck on their thick fries. Yum yum! I hear they make their own ketchup - and whatever extra ingredient they put it, works for me. I'm defintely sold. Will return for a SoCal burger :) They also do desserts--getting their cookies from MILK and other--so next trip, I'm saving some space for some sweets as well. Valet is $2.50 - not toooo bad. There wasn't a line when we got there (Monday 12pm) but I did see people waiting outside for a table by the time we were done.

Umami.  Some believe it's the fifth taste. Others refer to it as a savory flavor.  I say that's where to go for the best burger in Los Angeles.  There are a few locations scattered around LA, and soon the Valley will be getting our very own.  I've been to the Umami Burger on La Brea a few times now, and each time I have a consistent, and delicious experience.  It's in a tiny strip mall with barely 4-5 parking spots.  Later in the day, they offer valet, which is usually you're only choice.  The dining area is small, though impeccably clean and zen-like. Menu options are great and accommodate both meat eaters and vegetarians.  Whichever way you swing, be sure to get fries!  You get a free condiment that will enhance them even more. What we get: Umami Burger $10- it has a parmesan crisp and mushroom on top of the meat patty that takes this burger to a whole new level.  The meat is SOOO juicy and the brioche bun is like a fluffy pillow that melts in your mouth.  Everything tastes very fresh and high quality. This is my fave. Fries (thick, hand-cut) $3.50-  the texture has just enough crisp to it, and inside is fluffy and delicious. Umami Ketchup- tastes like it's been spiked with truffle and I think it needs to be bottled and sold. A++ Triple Pork Burger $11- Smoky, savory and meaty goodness.... And there's bacon.  Need I say more? Especially for these prices, the value is great.  I'm a huge fan.

Umami Burger? Or, Ooh, Mami-that's-expensive- Burger! For $10 and a bit of a wait, you get decent service and a lone hamburger on a large plate.  If you ask me, burgers should just "come with" friends, like our ol' pal French fries, new pal Sweet Potato Fries or distant Cousin Onion Rings.   Me and the beau made our first visit here; parallel parked down the street and walked a few feet past the tiny valet lot to get in.  There was a wait, but lucky for us, it was around 9ish on a Friday night and we were seated within 5 minutes. Our server was friendly; explained some things and then we ordered a Manly Burger for me and a GreenBird for the beau, who prefers turkey and a side of onion rings to share.   I won't lie; the burger was good.  Cheddar? good. Bacon? good. Size? bigger than the other non-manly burgers.  Being the lardy I am, I took a bite of the Greenbird.  It tasted really.... healthy.  Mmm, health. That's what I paid $10 for, right? Wrong!  I know some people probably like the way it tastes... lighter... less juicy... alfalfa... ehh... but for $10 a burger ($11, for the Greenbird), I think that Umami should be able to make a tiny mod.  Specifically, the mod of swapping turkey for the beef.  I know beau would have enjoyed his Greenbird if it were Manly, but alas, they rejected our request.  Really, though - why not?  How come you can swap beef for portabello on the Umami Burger, but not turkey?   And another thing - if i'm going to get onion rings, I expect more than 4 of them; i don't care if they are stacked in ascending order like the colored donut-ring toss game for children .  What is that, like $1 a ring and you get one free?  Puh-lease. I know this is an "artisan" burger, but just cuz you use square plates and sell stuff a la carte doesn't mean it's really worth it.  I'm just sayin... it was kinda disappointing. Eating is not believing.  I still can't believe the price for what we got here and they charge for condiments if you want more than one.   Next time I want a fancy burger, I think I'll try Juicy Burger...

In typical LA cool guy fashion, this place charges serious dough for a burger. Burger - Delicious but tiny as hell. The grom next to me eating with his momma had to get two just to satisfy his hungo pains. For me one didn't cut it, but with the sides of fried goodies, i left content. The burger i had was seasonal, pork patty with pork belly/bacon and the usual toppings. Like i said, delicious. A great burger but i could do without the oil/butter on the bun. My buns stay grease-free, thank you very much. Fries - triple fried is triple awesome, thick cut (.75" x .75") is the new accordion fry. Well seasoned and when combined with the homemade ketchup, these are some of the best I've had. Just enough crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Superb. Malt battered onion rings - good but way greezy - there was a pool of oil at the bottom of the bowl. Not so attractive, let that thing drain in the back or power someones DeLorean with it. And there's a ton of free parking - just not anywhere near this place. The lot is a joke, you'd have better luck finding oxygen on the moon. No beer?!? Get on it Umami burger, i want beer with my burger and fries. Shame shame. And while I'm not too keen on the idea of paying as much as they charge for a burger, gourmet or not, it is worth trying at least once.

there was only valet parking which was fine with us bec we dont like parking on the busy street. coming here for the first time actually made my burger craving satisfied. our waiter was suggesting his favorites but not being biased as to referring the 'priciest' selection. desert time - he suggested the apple pie and saig it was his all time fave - ofcorse we took his advice bec well - the burger he suggested hit the spot for us so might aswell desert too - but it kinda failed. we didnt like it bec it was just on the salty side. not my type of desert i guess - so in the end - our bill came and he saw the applepie barely eaten then he asked what was wrong - so i told him it just didnt satisfy my sweet craving as for a desert - next thing u know when our bill came he didnt charge us for he pie. i know it wasnt that much a diff price wise but just the gesture really impressed us. kudos to that waiter. he got a good tip :)

Nice concept.  Smooth looking place. A burger, fries, and a mexican coke will set you back about $20 all in. On the expensive side but not a problem if its worth it. I thought the signature umami burger was good but not excellent and certainly not worth driving across town for.  Meat was medium rare or so, perhaps a tiny touch over. The ketchup was not tasty and the fries were oversized and not good.  Skip the fries completely. I hope to try the truffle cheese one next time - but if its not good then I will say sayonara to umami burger.

#144 I can sum up my first experience at Umami in three words: "Way too salty!" I can appreciate the innovation and variety on the menu, but the execution was absolutely terrible. If the kitchen were less heavy handed on the NaCl, I think the food would have tasted just fine. From reading other reviews, it doesn't sound like this is the norm. What disturbs me the most is that this happened on a Friday evening - when your best crew should be working. Valet parking is available, but I'd just look for metered street parking on La Brea. Looking at the dining area, this restaurant is made for tables of two, and they are really packed in close together. Sure enough, that was the magic number on this Friday and we only waited about ten minutes to be seated. Service was average - nothing great, nothing terrible. On to the food: Port & Stilton Burger ($9) - blue cheese, poças port-carmelized onions I'm a fan of blue cheese, but this blue cheese in combination with the burger was ridiculously salty. The carmelized onions did help to add some texture. However, I was expecting a larger burger for $9. Fat Fries ($3 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) Honestly, these were horrific. This was really the only thing that wasn't salty ... but they had a distinct doughy flavor and seemed as if they were frozen as opposed to hand cut and triple cooked, as described on the menu. Tater Tots ($3 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) I'll admit that the Tater Tots were pretty good, but the salt eventually got to me. They were pretty large, at least relative to the ones I used to eat in grade school. Malt Liquor Tempura Onion Rings ($3 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) Again, we ran into the salt issue. I later found out from our server that these can be requested without salt. Sans salt, these would have been terrific. Their Mexican Coke is a 12oz glass bottle. However, their other sodas such as Dr Pepper and Diet Coke come in 8oz bottles. When it comes down to it, I cannot get past the salt. I hate to give a two star review, but I can't go any higher for now. I'm willing to understand that this might have been a one-time thing, but as I have said before, the majority of yelp reviews are based upon a one-time experience. I'll have to return and give them another try.

Sure i'll go again and pony up..... im dumb like that.   Perhaps it was a busy sat. nite, but it was a tad tinier than i anticipated.  At least a 1/3 of a lb or just something more woulda been perfect.   Ooooo-FREAKIN-MOMMY........ so EFFFING GOOD......

I've been here only twice since it's opened - and I got the same thing both times - The Manly Burger with the Tempura Onion Rings. Holy Delicious Batman - it's pure holy deliciousness in a bun. Sure - it's simple in idea, but the execution is simply delicious. I would try and find parking around on the street - if you can avoid the valet, I would. Things are already expensive enough, I'm not going to pay for someone to park my car too. I'm not sure what else can be said about the Manly Burger than hasn't already been said. It's Very Delicious - but it's also a buger that you need to run afterwards. But I don't care, if I'm going to eat a burger this good, I don't want to be right. :) Oh - this location also has Chai Soda - very delicious!

Last Saturday, my friend suggested we grab a bite at Umami Burger before heading downtown for some beats and booze at the Doheny. He'd been to Umami twice already, and guaranteed I'd like it. When we arrived around 9pm, the small lot was full, so I added our name while he looked for street parking. The wait was twenty minutes, but that was OK since it gave us time to pick up a couple of tall Asahis at the Food Mart down the street. We found out later it'll be BYOB for some time; Umami won't be getting their beer and wine license for months. We each ordered an Umami Burger, and split a Hatch Burger. The Umami definitely lives up to the hype, a delicious blend of ingredients that really achieves that elusive fifth taste (aka "umami") that the owner strives for. The Hatch was perfectly spicy, topped with various chopped and roasted chiles. It's good but not at the level of the signature Umami. We weren't asked how we wanted the meat cooked, but the burgers came out medium rare, just the way I like 'em. The fries were more of an afterthought, nothing special. The homemade ketchup wasn't all that, either. My friend later told me the sweet potato chips were good. Naturally he didn't say anything *before* I got the fries; thanks, dude. I can't wait to go back and try the other burgers: the Truffle, the Triple Pork, or maybe the Seared Ahi special if it's available. We overheard several guests say "this is the best burger in L.A.," and at the moment it's hard to disagree. The much-needed patio should be open any day now, so those of you who've put off visiting because you don't want to wait, get on down there!

I think this is a great burger place.  It's not a place where people gorge on lots of meat and big portions, but is a place to enjoy a well put together burger that has explosive flavors and juices.  The decor is modern and welcoming, definitely no complaints there. The sides are OK, nothing to write home about.  They are also very small, and do not expect much food when you order.  However, for 2-3 dollars depending on the side, it's also not expensive.  The fries we're ok.  The cold soba noodles were terrible.  The onion rings are actually really delicious and tasty.  I could have gone without the first 2 sides, but I'd definitely avoid the noodles altogether.  On the condiments side, I'd recommend the house spread.  It's a thousand island dressing with a lot more mayo and a lot more garlic.  The house spread is really an explosive orgy of garlic aioli and thousand island on your taste buds. Their saving grace (and it should be) are their burgers.  I had the pork burger, and the patty was completely filled with flavor.  It was an absolutely delicious meat patty, one that i had never experienced in a burger form before.  Also, the bread is great, it's a bit chewy and spongy at the same time.  I really enjoyed the ease of biting into the burger.  Also they implement some type of sun dried tomato instead of ketchup.  It works really well and really marries the flavors together with a bit of welcome tang.  I also was given a taste of the port burger.  This was delicious as well.  There's something very well marinated with the beef.  I can't put my finger on exactly what, but it enjoyed it. The only thing keeping this place from a 5, is it's not exactly the most value you'll get for your meal.  In the end, you're paying well into the 20 dollar category for a full meal, but a full meal you'll definitely enjoy. I dare say it...for the sheer different tastes i found in these burgers...i rate it above the Office Burger.

i was driving through LA with Brian R. when I saw the tiny little sign for this place out of the corner of my eye. I recognized the name from O O's review and insisted we stop for lunch. what a lucky coincidence that i was HUNGRY!!! Brian and I shared the port and stilton burger and the pork burger. BOTH WERE SO GOOD. the size was perfect considering the richness of the meat and cheeses and i loved that the buns were not too bready. i thought the burger with blue cheese was going to be my fave but i ended up liking the pork burger more. i was so impressed with the combination of flavors and the juiciness of the meat. the fries: i'll probably skip them next time. they were a little mealy. and i didn't think the spoonful of ketchup was enough considering the mealiness. i can't wait to go back and try all the other burgers!

I ordered the SoCal burger, my friend orders the Umami burger.  We split our dishes as well as sweet potato fries (thumbs up here) and regular triple-cooked fries (I wonder if that means triple the cholesterol). Flavorful - cheeses, house ketchup and alioli, and caramelized onions go with your thick, soft patty of beef in a sweet hamburger roll. Best burger in town. Also - if you are dying for a burger and you're with a date, bring the date here - not as cattle-call as In-N-Out, and not the middle-of-the-road fare of Islands.

My Bestie DblJ took me here after a movie. The name of the movie and the movie theater I dont remember. Mind you this was only a few weeks ago. My new schedule has hampered my review time. Anyway, I really liked my Manly Burger. Bacon always sets a burger off. The burgers are small but quite delish!! The thick fries were very thick so not as crispy as I like hence the one star off. Also the place is small so you are up close and personal with folk. Coke in a bottle from Mexico was great and the place has atmosphere. I had no choice but to dock a point for no alcohol, other than that its a cute spot. Sadly I did not get to taste those awesome looking desserts. I will go back to try those.

I must say I am normally not a fan of trendy places, they are more hype than qaulity. This is probably one of the best trendy places I've been to. We came here for lunch on a weekend a few weeks back. We decided to each order a separate burger and split them. We ordered both the Manly Burger and the Port and Stilton burger, plus onion rings to split. Both burgers were perfectly cooked to a nice medium rare pink center. The onion rings were great, lots of flavor, nice and crispy and perfectly cooked. One drawback was the Port and Stilton Burger, there wasn't a lot of Port flavor to be found. Burger size is another issue, the price is a bit steep for the size of the burger. I felt like a few more ounces of meat would make the meal more satisfying to the pallet as well as the pocketbook.

I recently went here with some old friends.  I had heard good reviews from others about this place so I definitely had to check it out. I had the Manly Burger, thin fries, malt liquor tempura onion rings, and house pickles.  It was all very good and tasty, but nothing out of this world as others had attested.  I finished it off with an ice cream sandwich (from Milk) - yum! My friend would complain that they wouldn't allow her to add cheese to her particular burger.  The manager Rick was kind enough to come out and explain that the chef was particular and they weren't allowed to add items to the burgers.  They could take things out but no additions as it might change the taste.  A little OCD if you ask me, but then again I'm no chef. Parking lot is limited to valet and is small.  The interior seating is very limited as well, but they do have a nice back patio.  They also don't allow you to split more than 2 credit cards which sucked since there were 6 of us. All in all, I would recommend this place, but I would recommend 8 Oz on Melrose over this.

WOW! This burger took my breath away - no seriously, I was stuffing my face and at one point I choked because I couldn't stop eating everything at once. The sweet potato fires with sprinkles of brown sugar, the Umami Burger, the regular fries, homemade ketchup, and Hogarden disappeared within I think 10 minutes. Okay, and if that wasn't enough, I was SCREAMING for the different ice cream sandwiches, peanut butter, salty caramel chocolate, oreo, mint ... heaven! Burgers are cooked to perfection and the flavors are thought out well. If you're in the LA area, do yourself a favor and get an Umami, because frankly, your pallet will LOVE you for it. One disclaimer: even with a reservation, you may have to wait, but it's well worth it!

The burgers were OK, but just OK. Better than fast food and unique, but not too-die-for delicious. For $10 or so, I doubt I'll be back. I had the truffle burger and I love truffles. Unfortunately, I could barely taste anything truffle-y about this burger. My friend had one of the burgers with an unusual cheese and felt the same way. Good, yummy, but not great. Nice modern decor and very good service. By the time we were done on a Wednesday night about 7;30 pm, the line was out the door -- and I just don't get it. Sorry, Unami. I wanted to give yah some love, but just can't do it.

Let's keep it real. The burgers here are good -- not large, but good. If you want a massive burger, then take your ass to ClaimJumpers (do those stilll even exist?)! If you want a different but extremely flavorful burger, then come to Umami. I tried the traditional Umami and a friend ordered the truffle burger -- both were awesome. The smushed potatoes are as fun to say as they are to eat. No need for thinly sliced fries when you can have a smushed potato! Plus, the ketchip has a little kick to it -- it put some curve in my swerve! Yes, there's probably going to be a bit of a wait when you get there. If you want your food fast, go to McDonalds and get their measly attempt at a burger. If you want a burger done right, come to Umami.

I wasn't happy at all with this location. I've eaten at the other ones plenty of times and I thought this would be just as great. One thing I didn't like was that we were given the option to choose where we wanted to sit. So we picked a place against the wall, but then they quickly tell us we could only sit on the opposite side since they were just about to clean it. Then why offer the open seating? They took our drink orders shortly after, and when they came, one of the cups was cracked on the side. We brought it to their attention and the server examined the glass then said in a scoffing tone "It's not that bad, but I can get you another one." At that point, we were just over dining there, so we paid for our beverages and left.

I'm writing this review as I still have the lingering delicious aftertaste of garlic aioli. You know a burger place is serious when the only utensil they give you is a knife, to possibly split it with other people, and with easily swapped out paper as your table cloth, and when they hand you extra napkins without saying a word, you know its going to be messy. These burgers are tasty...hands down. I love that they cook it medium rare, without asking you how they want it. This is how burgers should be enjoyed!  And by FAR, the best meat-to-bun ratio I've encountered. I had half a truffle burger, and half an umami burger. The truffle burger was buttery goodness. the meat dripped juices and it was desperately difficult not to scarf this baby down, because it was that delicious, that savory, that umami. The Umami burger has a slightly sweeter flavor, and the mushrooms give it a bit of an earthy taste - but not in a bad way, by any means. The flavors were clean, and really came through. In terms of sides, I had the french fries and the onion rings. TBH, nothing special. The tempura onion rings...dripped with oil, there was a pool in the bottom of the bowl it came in. The french fries were good. I'm all about thick cut fries. With thick cut fries, I really want them to be soft, but these ones have a nice crunch. However, I know a lot of people like it so I'm not going to dock them any points for that. And let's try not to complain too much about the size of the portions, people, okay? Sure it's not a huge hulking burger, but it leaves you satiated.  You don't have to leave every place FULL. Overall, this is a great. For 2 burgers and 2 sides it came out to $28.00.  Plus the $2.00 validation, and it was a solid meal, a solid experience, and a tasty burger.

FINALLY got to try this place out over the weekend.  I hear this is their 2nd location (on Hollywood Blvd).  The decor gives you a "loft" feel, not as homey as their other location (so they say). Onto the real deal...My friend & I ordered: -Sweet Potato Fries -Original Fries (not the skinny ones) -Tempura Onion Rings -Umami Burger -No. 5 Burger -Hitachino Nest Beer (Amber Ale) -Hitachino Nest Beer (White Ale) Breakdown, the Sweet Potato Fries were a little too sweet for my taste buds.  Felt like they sprinkled some sugar on them for that "extra sweet" taste...didn't go well with me. But I do favor their Tempura Onion Rings (yummy fluffy batter), as well as their fries (steak cuts).  Definitely order a side of their ketchup, it's definitely not Heinz or Del Monte flavor.  Tastes like they put in some siracha or something along the lines of that. Umami Burger was DELISH - but I don't know if I liked staring at how raw the beef was.  The No. 5 burger was delish as well, the spices they put in with the pork was memorable and lingers in your mouth  (YUM!).  The buns that surrounds the burger was delicately toasted to give that nice crisp texture when you sink your teeth into the burger. Washed it all down with two types of beer.  I personally enjoyed the Amber Ale.  It had a fuller body flavor, compared to its white ale counterpart. I really enjoyed the experience, definitely will come back!!

I'm still on my quest for LA's Best Burger Ever, and after hearing about this hyped-up place for months from the blogosphere I finally got to try it! We found street parking on the street right before the little Umami Burger plaza since the little lot was valet only for $2.50, and it was like a 30 second walk. Interior was small and cute and pretty cozy, and the staff was really friendly when we asked them what was inside the burger. The food: I got the Umami Burger without mushrooms since I'm not a fan of mushrooms, and my friend got the SoCal burger. Both are basically the same except the cheese (mine had parmesan crisp) and hers had butter lettuce in it. Cooked to medium rare, the burger was SO JUICY and tender and perfectly cooked, with the oven-dried tomato, the Umami ketchup and the deliciously soft and buttery bun complementing every bite. We got a side of skinny fries and shared those, and when the burger first came out I thought it was really small but after all of that and the fries, I was pretty stuffed. Overall, a realllllly good place. Prices are $9/burger and like $3 for the fries so cost is reasonable and quality is great! I will definitely be coming back again for a burger fix. And you should too =)

If you're starving - this is not the place to go unless you're willing to spend a lot.  Its without a doubt delicious though.  This is a place where you'll get a really juicy gourmet burger, but its a small burger. Most of us had the Umami Burger. which is absolutely perfect.  They always cook the meat medium rare.  I usually like my burgers cooked closer on the well side, but they cook it perfectly.  Its very evenly cooked and slightly medium rare on the inside so you get all the juices of the burger.  The Umami Burger also comes with a very interesting style of cheese - its almost like a crispy cheese.  Very good. Their skinny fries and tempura onion rings are great!  I didn't seem eager to try their regular fries because the other reviews mentioned them being bland.  I saw some other people who had ordered them and they did look bland.  The skinny fries, on the other hand, were perfectly seasoned.  (FYI: Skinny fries are size of McDonalds fries.)  My group of friends all loved the tempura onion rings.  Absolutely delicious. The La Brea spot is small, so seating is a bit tight.  They do have outdoor seating with heat lamps, so you have that option if you want to get seated quickly. The waiters are all friendly. It does take some time for your food to come out, so like I said, if you're starving, this is not the place to go.  But if you're looking for a place to just have a delicious burger, check it out. Oh and no alcohol served here.  They only serve bottled soda like Mexican Cola. PS: Its valet - $2.50.  Might as well do that because I got a ticket for misreading the parking sign on the street.

This location straight up sucks. Since the last time I went, service and food quality went wayyyyy down. We waited about 30 min on a Sat. afternoon, which is expected. But the "host" dude w/ sunglasses and "i'm too cool for you" attitude (dude, you're old and have a belly), was rude and annoying. He calls us, and we get up and are walking towards him waving our hands. He keeps calling our name and says "going once, going twice" when we are at arms length distance from him, yelling "WE are HEREEEE!" Get some real glasses dude. He sat us down at the counter in the back room facing the wall. I wouldn't mind if it was just two of us, but we had three people, which made conversations tough. The small table set for three people behind us was ready, and we asked if we could sit there, but the sunglass guy says "no, i have to flow with the momentum" or something dumb like that. Then he goes outside and calls in 3 guys. What?! So we order, and the guy is pretty nice. I get the hash burger (jalapenos, cheese, and more goodness)...my companions get the Umami, with an order of onion rings. We wait, and wait, and wait...the 3 guys that were seated at least 15 minutes after us get their food...and we're still waiting...i try to wave down a guy, they ignore me. SOOOO I get up and walk up to one of the guys and ask him, "WHERE's MY FOOOD?" He says he'll check. Within a minute, our entire meal comes out...weird. As if they just wanted me to get angry first. Then, we start eating, and find that all our burgers were cooked well done. Mine had suffered some burns as well. The menu says ALL BURGERS ARE COOKED MEDIUM RARE...A LIE!!!! UGH, we wanted to just dine and dash, cuz we were tired to waiting for the check. No tip. My uncle, a chef, said we were too nice. We should have raised hell... Next time I will raise HELL!! If there is even a next time that is... Oh Umami, why did you have to go mess up a great thing you had going?!

In summary the food here is very good, however portions will not fill you up, unless you are a really light eater. I left only half full after dropping fifteen bucks for an unami burger and sharing potato fries and onion rings with two others. breakdown: food: 5/5 the burger patty was cooked to perfection, all patties are medium rare. I also had the onion rings which were perfectly crisp and  and well seasoned. potato fries (off the menu) I don't think you can ever do these wrong. One thing that bothered me though is the fact that you have to not only buy condiments if you want more than one per side, but you also get so little, it's basically a large soup spoons worth. The garlic ascilia sauce is basically butter garlic and unami ketchup is just ketchup dont be fooled! Setting: 2.5/5 This place is so cramped! my party and I were squeezed between this tight wall and window. we were isolated from the rest of the restaurant so our waiter never saw us so we were completely disregarded. Avoid this table if possible the one with the big siddartha/hindu looking painting. Parking is 2.50 outside not that bad I guess... Service: 3/5 really fast service we were lucky enough to get a table, and food relatively quickly. However, for the rest of the stay we were completely ignored. It took forever to get the bill and to get our missed extra condiment order. overall: 2.5-3ish I would probably come here again because the unami burger rocks, but the combination of how much the food cost, how big the portions are, and how mediocre the service is t it wouldn't be my first choice.

I've come here at least 3 times, but forgot to write a review about it. I always order the Umami Burger to be safe. LOVE IT!! I love mushrooms in my burgers and they put really thin fried parmesan cheese slice in the burger. I LOVE parmesan cheese...so that was a PLUS. The only thing I wish is the burger to be a littler bigger. If I'm paying 9-10 bucks for a burger, I want it to be filling, but its not enough. That's why you have to order a side. Their regular fries are good and so are the sweet potato fries! the garlic aioli with the fries is decent. The waiters are friendly and if its your first time there, they go into detail about the menu. Parking is valet. or streets. I want to be more adventurous and try the other burgers the next time I come.

So Ryan Seacrest and Ellen Kay were raving about Umami Burger one day on the radio. So my friends and I decide that if they loved it so much, the burgers must be pretty amazing. First off, the restaurant is quite small. Luckily, we came in on a slow Sunday night. But expect a wait if you come in during peak days/hours. The service was excellent. My server as well as the rest of the staff were extremely courteous and efficient in getting us what we needed. As for the burgers, they were good but nothing special I would go out of my way for again. We order the Hatch, Umami Burger, and the Truffle. My fave was the hatch. The fries are delicious but I've had better onion rings. Point of this review: don't expect an over extraordinary burger. Expect good burgers , but don't expect the "Wow".

Umami known as the 5th taste, hahaha, on the drive here, i was thinking who are youuu to call yourself the UMAMI burger. lol i quickly bowed to the chef, and im craving it now as im typing this review. okay the Umami burger is a must order. someone between your friends needs to order this, and the TRUFFLE burger is also a must, especially if you love truffle, youll love this! the ahi tuna burger special is good when your on a diet, but if your  gonna be bad, then id just go wild and order the two i just recommended.   The tator tots are super yummy as a side, with the jalepeno ranch!  This place is tiny and there might always be a lil wait, but its worth it guys!!! check it out!!!

Their Truffle Burger is delicious! It's small, but cheesy and full of flavor. It gets a bit greasy, so have those napkins handy! The Manly Burger is quite tasty as well, but there's a hint of wasabi in it that I felt took a lot of the burger flavor away. I love their thin fries and sweet potato fries. Perfect for sharing around the table. They're great with the roasted garlic aioli. You also have to try an ice cream sandwich. They're so good! Yes, the burgers are packed with flavor, but it can be a bit pricey, especially when you add the sides, drinks and dessert. I take my visiting relatives here to get a taste of "Hollywood" but they always say they expected bigger portions for the price. That may also be because they're used to the $6 Carl's Jr. burgers!

I can have a $30-$40 dollar lunch anywhere (2 burgers, a side, drink and tip), so I can really do without the arrogant slackers that work there and the ever so important owner / manager (Adam) who hides from customer concerns.

Yummy food, hip spot, friendly service... The sweet potato fries were good, but I liked the thin fries better.  Nonetheless, I'll still probably order both again.  And the condiments were pretty cool.  Both the umami ketchup and aioli were good choices.  Even the truffled beet salad was really good.  But the burgers were awesome.  All 3 we tried were great, but the best was the Truffle Burger, followed by the Umami Burger, then the Triple Pork Burger.   Stuff that in with some iced green tea, and you're set. The staff members were all really nice and let us enjoy our meal, even though there was a growing crowd outside.  I never felt rushed.  I had my baby with me and he started to get fussy toward the end of the meal, but they were really cool about it and even thoughtfully offered us ice cream sandwiches to go as we were trying to wrap up our lunch.  I'll definitely go back when I'm in town again.

So like everyone else, I've been told over and over again Umami is the best burger in town. I studied a little about this hidden tastebud Ive been neglecting all these years, Umami was the answer to my boring food conquests, yes this was my day. Got there around 8. First off this place has no parking. I don't like valeting when I don't have to but I didn't like this neighborhood very much either. Meters were all taken and this is the opposite side of La brea, like the dark and ghetto-y part across olympic. Ended up near some residential area and walked 3-4 blocks. Next is the line. I dread lines especially when Im hungry. Put my name down and waited....and waited. My hunger overcame my sensibilities and I asked to place my order for take out. And waited some more. Umami, the space itself is pretty small. There is an outdoor seating area behind the restaurant but I didnt get a chance to see it. I ordered the Umami burger. I tasted the Umami, it hit me on the back of my tongue. Very enjoyable and interesting. The burger was great in terms of food palette playfulness but the portions left much to be desired. My burger seemed small especially for what I paid. I also figured out their secret ingredient is their ketchup. I'm not sure whats in it but my god the fries tasted better, my burger tasted better,  I couldnt stop eating it. At some point I really thought it had to be MSG or something LOL. So why 3 stars? I break it down like this: 5 stars for food! -1 small portions -1 for small space and scary area -1 for wait and no parking +1 for delicous ketchup! total = 3 stars. For burgers, I'll stick to my fav local joiint Kalbi burger. That plus the Umami on sunset is much nicer in comparison.

Came here before the craze about 5 years ago and never came back. The waiter spilled and entire bowl of ketchup over my velvet jacket! :( It seemed very difficult to spill ketchup directly all over a customer's arm and hair like how he did... and he didn't seem to be overly apologetic to match his flamboyance. Furthermore, he didn't even comp our meal and gave me the impression it was my fault.. huh? That has never happened to me before or again since this place. Not worth another visit.

Bangin' burgers. That's what Umami serves. Saw a nice review in the Times (sorry Yelp) and decided to hit it up. Parking sucks rocks, especially at night. There's a small lot with permit-only parking in the immediate vicinity, but I lucked out and found a spot next to a "parking attendant" (AKA a homeless guy) on La Brea & Wilshire. There was a considerable wait, but the staff was amiable, attentive and apologetic for the delay. We even were given water for our trouble as we waited. The menu is simple and the priciest item on the menu is the $11 Truffle Burger. I initially chose the signature Umami Burger for a reasonable $8 and settled on the Turkey Confit Burger when I found out the Umami Burger was sold out. My friend went with the Port & Stilton Burger. Both were awesome! Juicy and flavorful, these two burgers alone blew anything I've ever had at Father's Office out of the water. Seriously. Some complained about burger size, but I didn't find them to be too small. There a decent selection of sides. I went with the hand cut fries, but the sweet potato chips looked tasty as well. The total bill clocked in under $30 including tip. What a deal, right? With such a simple menu, you could conceivably try everything on it within 3-4 visits if you share with friends. Speaking of friends, seating is limited. I saw four-tops and maybe a sixer in the back, but that was about it. This *not* the spot for big groups. If you can brave the parking sitch, grab a bud and head over.

I ran 12 miles Sunday and decided that I was DEFINITELY treating myself to an Umami burger! I mean, shoot, what's the point of running if i can't load myself up with tons and tons of juicy fatty calories, right? I had the Hatch burger which included 3 different types of chilies and lots of cheese. On first bite, I'll admit, I thought i was biting into a slice of pizza... something with the peppers and cheese, but after that... of all good things hamburgery and tasty!!!! The meat was perfect! Juicy and tasty and the perfect texture. The burger itself was really good. I really didn't care for the fries. Sure it was cut and stacked kind of cute in a geometric way, but honestly they were soggy and I regretted ordering it. Skip it and try the onion rings. They looked better. I'll definitely come back and try their other burgers though... can't wait!

My friend and I tried this place during a brief lunch hour bonding session. The place has a mod kind of atmosphere, a sort of Asian-inspired Zen-ness. We both ordered the Umami burger, which foodies have raved about in newspapers and blogs; the menu touts it as "the one you will crave." Writing about it now, I don't disagree with that statement. It has an odd mixture of all four tastes (salty, sweet, slightly sour/tangy, not so much bitter, thank goodness) and that elusive fifth taste, umami. Didn't order sides or dessert, as we were pressed for time, but I'd love to go back and try those... as well as the other burgers on the menu. On the whole, it was a great dining experience. Nine bucks is a little pricey to pay for a burger that I won't dare to compare to an In-N-Out cheeseburger. However, if you're in the mood for a curiously different burger, this is the place.

I ate here for dinner last night. I must say I enjoyed it! There was absolutely no wait. We walked in and sat down, however it was a Monday night. Parking sucks donkey balls. I parked on 8th which is one block up but it's okay because I needed the exercise if I was going to eat this burger! I got the MANLY burger, My friend had the Truffle burger and we split french fries and Onion Rings. The service was great! Our waiter met all of our needs and was very polite and involved with his job. The manly burger was good. It has cheese bacon and Onion strings and like dijon mustard. I will say it was Slightly Salty. The bacon was like full on chunks-o-meat.  That was a bit too much so I picked it out. The French Fries were okay not the best I had but certainly not the worst. An order of french fries is basically a whole potato cut up into THICK strips.  The onion rings were OUTSTANDING. Really tasty they made me happy. Now some reviewers have complained about the burger size and the price. I would not expect for this burger to be any cheaper. The beef was obviously high quality. The bacon was the biggest chuncks of bacon I have ever seen and the Bun was THE best bun I have ever had on a burger. The meat/bun proportion was perfect. I left satisfied and I ain't no skinny mini who gets full off of a bite! I would suggest this place to anyone who would like an experience like they have never had before.

Yes, you will be served by hipsters. Yes, you are basically forced to use the valet because street parking on this stretch of La Brea is miserable. Yes, the burgers are tiny and a bit overpriced for the size that you get. Look, Umami Burger has its faults and if you're looking for a giant, classic American cheeseburger served out of a greasy, classic American burger shack, you shouldn't be heading to Umami. Come to Umami if you want to try something new. Come to Umami if you're tired of the classic American cheeseburger and want your tastebuds to be surprised. And come to Umami if you're looking to fall in love with a burger again. To love Umami's burgers is akin to cheating on that classic American cheeseburger, but damn, does it feel good. At this particular location, I'm partial to the Manly Burger and the Port & Stilton. The Manly is a twist on the familiar bacon cheeseburger, using a beer-tinged cheddar, fried onion strings and crunchy, fatty bacon lardons. I love a good stinky cheese on my burger, so the Port & Stilton with blue cheese and caramelized onions satisfies that craving. Don't waste your money on a side of fries.... they're ok, but you get a very small stack of them, and for $3 it's just not worth it. Instead, try one of the ice cream sandwiches for dessert.  Brought in from Milk on Beverly Blvd, these little wheels of ice cream are sandwiched between two macarons.... simple, playful, delicious.

A solid 4 star burger.  I ordered the Umami. The description of it is not listed, but I think it was mushroom, parmesan crisp, roasted tomato.  I took out the tomato because I thought it tasted like tomato sauce... didn't like that part.  My husband ordered the manly burger with crisp bacon lardon pieces, and a friend ordered the truffle burger.  I think I liked the saltiness of the manly burger the most.  The truffle burger was a little too rich and sweet for my liking.  Every burger had a juicy medium rare patty though, and soft, buttery bread.. it was fantastic! As for the fries.. eh.. 2 stars.  The triple fried regular umami fries are deceiving.  When something says it's triple fried, I think of a nice crisp fry.  wrong.  big chunks of potato, that almost seem undercooked.  I would go for the skinny fries next time.  Or better yet, I ordered the truffle and beet salad.. and that was delicious!  (baby arugula, toasted almonds, light colored beet slices, truffle oil, and i think a scoop of ricotta... it was very creamy and complemented well with the spicy arugula). Came with a group of 8, and was asked twice by the hostess if our whole party was here.  Does she think we're stupid and didn't answer honestly the first time we said yes?  She was a bit of a snot.. didn't appreciate her attitude.   Luckily, our waiter made up for her condescending attitude.  He was great!  It was our first time, so he was very patient and answered all of our questions.   Quality patty, delicious buns, and nice waiter.. I would come back.

I got the classic Umami Burger which was perrrrfectly cooked medium rare. I already heard so much hype about the burger but I was impressed regardless. What I wasn't expecting was how DELICIOUS the fries were!!!! Omygoodness they were the BEST fries I've ever had. Imagine chunky steak fries  that are soft on the inside but golden crispy on the outside. The ketchup is hand made as well and I wanted to come back the next day just to order this again! Quick comment on the menu, the burger menu changes so if there is a special burger (like the lamb one) that you really like, you'd better enjoy it while you can. Valet parking available as well

There is one word I like to describe Umami, small. The restaurant is small, the burgers are small, and the sauces for the sides are small. However that doesn't deviate me from giving this place a high rating. Burgers are quite juicy, where the juices will start squirting outta your burger and into someone's eyes or clothes. Beware though as these burgers will result in an orgasm that will make your significant other quite jealous. The burgers are so scrumptious that vegetables are not needed to be included in this heart attack concoction. Sides such as the fries and onion rings are quite the delectable addition to your burger meal. However, be sure to choose the right sauce to go with your side as there is an extra charge of 50 cents for each additional sauce you choose. On occasion, you might spot a famous celebrity eating at this location. Just be sure not to squirt your burger on their clothes if you happen to eat next to them. Likes: +Juicy Burgers such as the Truffle burger, Manly burger, and Port & Stilton +Fries and Onion Rings +Celebrity sightings Dislikes: -Small sauces -Extra charge on small sauces -Small burger but the tastiness of them makes up for it

PROS: - super TASTY 5 star burgers (and i don't even like burgers!) - my bf got the Pastrami Special, SOOOO GOOD! (thick pieces of pastrami) - i had the greenbird - DELICIOUS - order the tater tots and onion rings (so YUMMY!) CONS: - extremely slow wait (there wasn't even a crowd) - inattentive service (many sides didn't come out until the very end) - no alcohol - pretty small portions and only one sauce per side - don't get the regular fries (taste like cold McDonald's)

I have been curious about this place since it opened up in the hood several months ago. I took the ladies here after seeing so much yelp traffic. In case anyone was wondering, they do, in fact, have a high chair for your young'un and will gladly accommodate you no matter how busy or short-staffed they might be. Our waiter was apologetic for our wait outside and, though he did not bring us a menu right away, mostly made up for it with attentive and friendly service. With all the love for the 3 x pork burger, we both could not resist ordering one. Lucky for us that we got the last two that evening. Praise and respect for this burger was unanimous. The size is right and the sauce complements the pig well. I do advise eating it quickly and/or carefully though to prevent the chorizo juice from completely soaking through the bun. They were out of the eggplant fries, so we did not get to try them :-(. The tempura onion rings sound great on paper, but were unremarkable. Also, as many have pointed out, you don't really get that many. The sweet potato chips were sweet, not very salty, and a hit all-around, particularly with the little one.   Do yourself a favor and park on La Brea (avoid the adjacent lot) and don't forget to BYO Booze. We'll definitely be back to try the other burger varieties, but we'll likely opt for takeout since we live right near by.

Outstanding Burger, once we got everything situated a bit. First off, tiny dining room. They planted us at the high counter in the side room. This was bad. The stools were so close to the underside of the counter that we couldn't even sit up to it. When you eat something that could quite possibly drip on your lap, this is not a good position to be in. A bit of musical chairs later, and we ended up at the low counter (same room). This was much better. They were quick to take our order, and the food came out pretty fast. The waiter dropped the burgers in front of us and the onion rings in the middle. We started with the tempura onion rings. Nice and tasty. The onions are sliced a bit thick for my liking, but still good. Not the best onion rings I've ever had, though. Then I bite into the burger in front of me. I ordered the hatch, which is touted as being spicy. For some reason my burger was not at all spicy. I kept eating it, though. It was great! Then my wife says "Hey, I think they mixed up our burgers. Mine is all full of green chiles."  Oops... I was eating her Port & Stilton. We swapped burgers. So my Hatch burger was completely red all the way through. I don't mean rare, I mean like I'm looking to catch something or I'm a wild animal. I couldn't eat that. I sent it back and there was some confusion for a while. 5 minutes later I was asked, "You got your burger, right?" I explained about the raw meat and he ran off. A few more minutes passes, my wife is finished with her burger and the onion rings are long gone. Waiter comes running out with a super hot Hatch burger for me. I bit into it and it's still pretty rare, but at least dead. Still more rare than my wife's was, but I assume that's due to them hurrying. I went ahead and ate it. WOW this is a good burger. All the problems were suddenly forgotten once I bit into the chiles and the cheese, that huge piece of beef, and that amazing bun. Wow. I've never had a burger like this. This was worth every bit of the $9.00 they charge. The chiles were all caramelized, and the cheese fully melted. I can't explain how much better that is than just tossing some cold veggies on a hot burger. In hindsight, we realized we didn't need the onion rings. They weren't something to write home about, and the burgers are so good you must finish them. Next time we're going to order just the burgers. Oh, and my wife liked the Hatch I ordered a lot better than the Port & Stilton. That one was just too mild, and the blue cheese is a little odd. Still great if you're hungry and not sure what you ordered though. Haha

At the insistence of my MOTHER, the hubby and I came here for dinner last week. Apparently my mom had been here a few times with her friends and they all said the same thing... es ist gut! And so we trekked the jungle that is the 101 freeway hoping for a decent dinner, but our hearts were broken for they don't serve beer! Huuuu-what, no beer?!  That's probably why my mom hangs out here. I ordered the truffle burger, sweet potato fries, root beer float and that tomato/arugula salad that is not worth mentioning (why did I even order a salad?!). My husband had TWO umami burgers, block of fries and Mexican coke (?).  The medium rare meat and the bun were delicious, I was waiting for that indefinable moment but it never came, there was hardly any fifth taste.  The sweet potato fries were awesome and so is the ketchup.  I will definitely come back for the truffle burger. The crowd ranges from MOTHERS to oldies to gym-goers and so on... there was a waiting period but not for more than 15 minutes.

This place is like the chic burger join in LA. It is a nice place and they do use a good quality beef in the burger and there bun is great, but its just small and sorry but even gourmet burgers should not be petite. great truffle fries. They don't serve alcohol so no beer with your burger.

I'm not a big burger person, but I've heard so many people rave about their burgers that I was excited when I had the chance to try their burgers. Maybe it's because I had high expectations (or because I'm not a burger person), but I wasn't all that impressed. Don't get me wrong.. they DO have burgers that are delicious, but I think you can get more for your bucks at other gourmet burger places. The La Brea location is a bit small, so you feel a bit cramped. The staff are nice, friendly, and attentive. One thing I do like about Umami is that their burgers are sized just right. It's not too small or too big- it's big enough that you feel content.

On food alone, this place gets 6 stars.  The burgers are insanely flavorful and perfectly sized.  The market salad is phenomenal, and the onion rings alone are worthy of summoning "the fifth taste."  The owner has a profound understanding of simple high-quality food. Being picky, the sides are a little small, the prices a little steep, and the service a little slow and seemingly confused.  Move this place to a more friendly block a little further north, into a larger space, with slightly larger sides and slightly lower prices, and you have a near-perfect lunch spot.

The Umami Burger is absolutely one of my favorite burgers EVER!  The flavors work so well together and each layer of the concoction is amazing on its own. I'd also recommend the Port & Stilton Burger... but have to say I liked the Umami better. The onion rings are crispy and light and delicious.  We also liked the regular and sweet potato fries.   I'm not a Ketchup person, but their homemade ketchup was great.... and their Roasted Garlic Aioli is to die for.  We also really enjoyed the House Relish. The bonus is the Cake Monkey Desserts they carry.  Gotta love those!!!

Alright, so the burger was tasty and the tempura onion rings were pretty awesome. But, here's the thing: The burger is actually pretty small (think 1.5x the size of a slider). I know, I know... they grind their own meat or something. I don't care! If I'm paying $12 for a burger, I'd better be screaming for mercy by the time I cram the last bit of beef in my mouth. I mean, if I'm gonna get e. coli and high cholesterol then I want it to be worth it. Also, why did my soda cost me $3 and come in an itty-bitty bottle with no refills? Not cool, dudes.

The food was very good, but DO NOT PARK IN THE VALET.  The guy was pissed off the whole time, driving cars 90mph in a 20'x30' lot when there weren't even people waiting for their cars.  He hit the mirror of my brand new black car on the white car next to it leaving a large white scratch and then denied it.  The steering wheel was covered in a sticky mess when we got back in, and he gave me some nasty looks after not tipping him.  You do not deserve a tip after mangling my car.  Slow down and next time I'll give you something...at least man up to scratching my car and apologize. Enough ranting, the burgers here are always tasty, but they need to serve booze at this location like their other locations.

Super awesome potential here. I look forward to going back and trying their other burgers. The meal: http://static.px.yelp.co… I got the Mid-East Burger, which was super tasty. Lamb with some great spices and, I discovered, slices of cucumber between the meat and the bottom bun. It was an interesting surprise and definitely well complimented the flavor. That said,  I might be hard pressed to call it a burger. The meat was in the form of what seemed like two small sausages, sans casings. Though the flavor was great, the coherency left some to be desired. In addition to not being a single patty, the meat did not stay together very well. Still, quite tasty. And then there are the much remarked upon fries. I have to say my first thought upon seeing them was, "Aw, they're so cute!" And they were. And tasty as well, just the right amount of crispiness and salt. But... I am not Rain Man. I really should not be able to glance at my plate and know the exact number of fries I have. Sorry guys. I dug the plating, but if we're gonna go jenga style, at least give me a good tower to work with. The beer was quite tasty, still frosty from my fridge, though there is also a market kitty corner that one can pick up a bottle of something if you so desire. There is even dessert: little cakes from the lovely people at Cake Monkey. Definitely no complaints there. I had a "homemade ding dong" with raspberry mousse creme between two layers of red velvet cake and dipped in dark chocolate. A wonderful light way to end the meal. Overall: Taste: Great! Portions: Style is wonderful guys, but filling my belly is why I came. Atmosphere: Modern, relaxed. Would make a good 2nd or 3rd date spot. Definitely go, but if you're holding off try again in 6 months or so when they hopefully have refined things even more.

Umami Burger is in a relatively non-de-script location at La Brea and 9th, which also happens to house many other good restaurants and cafes. The restaurant offers valet service, which is a Godsend in an area known for its impossible parking. My husband and I purchased the Stilton/Port burger and So-Cal burger, which were both superb. The beauty of the burgers is that they are light and airy -- not too heavy, so you don't feel guilty after your meal. But the flavor is there, and the restaurant does an excellent job at balancing out flavors, and doesn't glop toppings so that the beef is overwhelmed. The So-Cal's sun dried tomatoes are definitely worth the hype -- they are like nothing I've tasted before. Their beer tempura onion rings are delicious, but the portions are a bit small (6 onion rings for two people). The restaurant also serves Mexican Coke, which is just regular Coke made with cane sugar, not high fructose corn syrup. It tastes cleaner, and  even comes in an old-timey glass bottle. For dessert, we had the "monkey cakes," which look like and are packaged like Hostess Ding-Dongs. We ordered the raspberry red velvet variety, which was the perfect complement to the meal. Rich, creamy and flavorful. To sum it up: Pros- great flavors, good prices, good parking Cons- small portions, buns a bit soggy

I'm sort of disappointed in all the 1 and 2 star reviews!  I vote 3.75...ish I really liked the burger I got!  I didn't think it was small (who said it was a 5-bite burger?  Those must be some big freakin' bites!) but just the right size.  The bun was quite fantastic. I ordered the Hatch burger, and my friend ordered the Port/Stilton.  We both agreed the Hatch was much better.  The combination of meaty and spicy was ideal with some exciting flavors playing out, rather than just blind spicy heat.  The Port and Stilton was also terrific; perfect for the cool evening.  I love that there's a place where you can actually get a burger medium rare as a default, and not medium well.  :)  We didn't add any toppings, opting to let the burgers, as they were constructed, speak for themselves.   I think this worked out best.  I'm not a big condiment person, anyway.  The flavors should speak for themselves.  The prices seemed quite reasonable.  Most of them were around the $10 price point, which, for the quality and the flavor and the amazing bun, seemed appropriate to me. I ordered pickles as a side.  Interesting.  not amazing.  Only one of the pickle choices really rocked my socks, but there were three little slices of that.   A little pricey for pickles, I think.  Also, the hearts of palm just tasted like...hearts of palm from the Bristol Farms salad bar. The iced tea was amazing. It was some floral ridiculous delicious tea that I now crave.   I love that sides are a la carte.  That was terrific. A little small and cramped, but cozy and the crowd was friendly so being on top of people wasn't really problematic.  Service was super friendly.  I'll definitely be back!

Just treated myself to a long awaited lunch at Umami. There's one in my neighborhood and I finally had the afternoon to go indulge. The menu is small, not like going to The Counter or anything like that. They just have 5 or 6 burgers and a few sides to choose from. Fine with me - keep the menu small if everything is AMAZING, right? I ordered the Port & Stilton burger - I die for blue cheese on a burger. It's one of my favorite things in the world when it's done right. And when my plate was put in front of me, it was shockingly spare and looked a little... dingy. The blue cheese was an odd shade of grey and not even on the burger - it was clumsily scooped into a plastic spoon on the side of the plate. Ok fine, even though I am paying $10 for this burger, I'll go ahead and do the work myself I guess and put the blue cheese on the blue cheese burger that I ordered. When I took off the top bun, the small portion of carmelized onions looked a bit dismal too. But hey, maybe presentation isn't their thing and it's all going to taste DELICIOUS! First bite - yum. Second bite - wait, what happened? Oh.. the bun got soggy instantly, the blue cheese flavor vanished and the whole thing just kind of, flopped. So much for delicious. I also ordered some Malt Liquor Tempura Onion Rings and eagerly chomped on that hoping for something more exciting than my kind of bland and soggy burger. No.. wrong again. Such a fancy name for such boring onion rings. I think they make they're own ketchup. It was bland too. And then I spilled it on myself - admittedly not their fault - but STILL.  I almost asked for salt, but I was afraid they might charge me for it. Did I mention that you're allowed to have one condiment served with your side dish, but anything more than that they charge. So if you like ketchup AND mustard, that's going to cost you $1.50. I'd like to say that my adorable Diet Coke in a mini glass bottle was the best part. But when I finished it and realized how small it was, it dawned on me that I'd have to pay another $3 if I wanted more Coke. By the end of the meal, I was seventeen dollars deep and didn't even want to bother with dessert. I'm full and I did eat the whole burger. It's not like it's not edible.. it's just.. underwhelming. And for that amount of money, I can go to Comme Ca and get the best burger in LA - or I can just go enjoy an In & Out because it tastes just as good as Umami. I think that people that really believe this is the "best burger ever" need to stop eating at Burger King and go try some real food for a change. It gets better than this. A lot better.

I had to try this place-especially because all the mixed reviews. One of my friends claims it is better than Father's Office! :o I really needed to try it after hearing that! And the verdict? It's good. I got the umami burger. I thought the bread was great!! Really worked well with the burger. The flavors were also good. Didn't blow my mind, but it was good. Is it better than Father's Office? I don't think the two are comparable. But I definitely don't think it's better. Just different. My gf got the beet salad and it was surprisingly good. I almost wished I got her salad instead. haha.

Service was quick, friendly and the place had a nice vibe. But the lights were on full blast so the atmosphere was a little meh for a Friday night at 7pm. The burger itself is not very big. But, not too small. It's the perfect size for a European, which I incidentally am not. So, I think the burger should be slightly bigger. If not bigger, at least dressed a little fuller. However, the real issue with my food was not the size, it was everything else. When you specialize in only burgers, the burgers should be excellent. Mine was the worst I've had in recent memory. The flavor of the meat was very unappetizing. It had a gaminess to it. And, despite the meat being cooked at a medium rare temperature, it was tough, rubbery and chewy which could maybe explain why the patty didn't stick together. The meat seemed to separate off into its own little individual patties by clumping up in little balls and leaping from the bun to the plate as an act of patty suicide. And, the bottom half of my bun had soaked up all of the grease and blood and by the time I took a bite it was no longer a bun, it was now a soaking wet blood/grease sponge. So, I ended up going home and making a box of mac and cheese, proof I'm not European.

I've been wanting to see what the hype was all about at Umami. I finally got the chance last week when some friends planned to meet up and have dinner there. Unfortunately, I wasn't as impressed as I expected to be. I did do my research beforehand. I knew that if we came at 7, it's usually quick seating, but if we come at 8, it would be busy. Sadly, my friends couldn't make it until 8, so we had to deal with it. I thought that if I came early enough, I could put our names down so that we wouldn't have to wait that long when the rest of us arrive. When I got there at 7:45, the hostess told me that she couldn't put our names down until everyone in the party was present. We ended up waiting outside until 8:30 to be seated. Once seated, service was really fast. I ordered the Port & Stilton burger, which was tasty, but not worth $10. However, the best part came when we ordered fries and were given 3 different types of dips, one of which is the umami ketchup. That ketchup is AMAZING -- I ended up pouring it over everything I ate! Overall, I'm glad I tried it out, but I wouldn't go back unless a friend really wants to go. I'd also head over earlier or later than 8 so that I wouldn't wait so long.

Great burger joint. I had the SoCal burger w sweet potato fries and a yummy root beer (no liquor license)  It was all delicious.  Although it may be helpful to pat down your bun with your paper napkin as it's a tad greasy, yet great. My friend ordered tempura onion rings and wow! they were delicious. Our server, Nick, was attentive, friendly, and accommodating. NOTE:   if you are dining alone, sit in the 'closet' room to the left of the dining room (1 table for 2 & bar stools that face a wall) Otherwise sit outside or inside (outside the closet)

I am certain I wrote a review of this place already. Went with a large group to try these much hyped burgers and we were mostly disappointed. I have heard some locations vary but I dont think its unusual for their burgers to be soggy. I always order my burgers medium rare at places where I think the meat will be better quality. So somehow only this place does not know how to cook the burger without having a pool of blood soaking the entire bun and the plate. It was so soggy the parmesan crisp was mush. The cheesy tots sounded great  but i think the potatoes were not cooked enough. disappointing and not filling. Had it not been as soggy I think it still would have been a 3. My friends have liked their specialty burgers with pork in them...i just had the standard. The service was a bit odd...like he was trying to be cool and sassy but it just came across a little offensive to some people in the group. I was ok with it but 2 of my guy friends will start a mini rant about the food/waiter if you bring it up.

I'm finally was able to try Umami Burgers after i miss out the last time i was in LA. Mission accomplish!! The So Cal Burger for $10 was very well worth it. The butter lettuce,slow-roasted tomato,american cheese (house made) and the caramelized onions with the freshly made bun is a complex combination of ingredients that works well in eating a extraordinary burger!! The malt liquor tempura onion rings were also the ultimate one can ever eat and with 4 large rings that satisfy. I finish all this with a local favorite dessert called CakeMonkey, Chocolate cover peanut butter and marshmallow cakewich , "Heaven". Total billed was a respectable $18.66 Very highly must go for Burgers!!!! ( I think this beats out Burger Bar in Las Vegas!!)

So so so tasty. I got the namesake burger and it was really a revelation. The cooked tomatoes, the parmesan cheese, the sweet sauce. It was truly a gourmet burger. The tempura onion rings were good, but the smushed potatoes were a bit boring. Also, this place won't fill you up, but it's good anyway.

How come no one is mentioning the truffle burger here?? Let me try and describe the first bite of this wonderful beast of a burger as best as possible:  Each flavor hit at a different time. First was the soft, yet perfectly toasted and slightly sweet bun, then was the charred outer crust of the burger itself, smoky with charcoal, then the saltiness of the truffle oil and truffle cheese somewhere in there and an intangible garlickiness that suffused the entire bite. Wait, wait what was that? ... A flavor orgasm? Oh my, oh yes (shudder, shudder) I think that's what that was. Perfectly seasoned, soft and pink and juicy and just so gosh-damn tasty ... Put up with the parking and the crowds and the spotty service and the high prices and ridiculous corkage fee ... Believe the hype. Just go to Umami and take a bite, even just one, of their burgers. You WILL savor the experience, I promise.

So the burgers definitely get 4 stars. The Umami Burger is good, very unique and different than your average burger (I like the focus on umami flavors); the Truffle Burger was really excellent probably my favorite; the Hatch is also great nice spicy flavor but not so spicy as to cover up the other tastes; the Port and Stilton was probably my least favorite of the 4 I tried but was still really good, the Stilton was good and not overpowering like some blue-cheese burgers, the only reason I say it is my least favorite is because the other 3 were extraordinary and the Stilton was just a good blue-cheese burger (and not as good as the directly comparable Fathers Office burger). Now the less than 4 stars parts... They were out of fries (also veggie burgers, and cake monkey deserts) which was disappointing because I wanted to try them. They also didn't have some of the things I wanted to try even listed on the menu (mideast burger and sweat potato chips) even though those are on their online menu. I am hoping they just rotate stuff and they will be back soon! I was also not impressed with the onion rings, and the sweet potato salad was just ok. Parking there is valet which is lame, though pretty much the norm for that area. I had no problem finding free street parking close by (though it was a Sunday evening). The wait was long even though it wasn't that busy, mostly due to the wait staff. Their service was definitely inattentive, slow, and forgetful. It would be nice if it was better, but I was there to enjoy the burgers (which were fantastic), so that is what I focus on.

My cousin has been talking about this joint for awhile now so I took my curiosity over to La Brea to see what the fuss was all about. I went on an off time so there was no one in the restaurant when I got seated.  I was welcomed by the waiter and was asked what type of beverage I wanted.  He offered "Mexican coke."  I was hesitant and asked what that was and he explained that they used real sugar unlike the ones that are distributed in the US.  Being that I'm from the Philippines, I ordered one to see if it tasted like the one in the motherland.  YUP.  Exact same taste.   The menu is pretty small, which I like it.  Since it was my first time, I went with the Staple which is the Umami Burger.  It has mushroom and tomatoes.  I also got an order of fries to share.   We got the burgers within a 10 minute span so the wait wasn't long at all.  The burgers are regular sized, probably a little on the smaller side.  I took a bite into mine and it was tender and juicy.  A little warning for people that don't like their burger medium rare.  You would probably have to request for your order to be cooked more if you don't.  I personally love medium rare and it was divine.  It's one of the juiciest burgers that I've ever tasted.  At $9 a burger, it had to be good, especially at the size of the burger. I was pretty happy with my burger, which didn't spill into the sides.  I ordered a side of fries.  When we got our fries, it came in a little cup with a teaspoon of ketchup.  I get it, this place is a little more upscale that your average burger spot but roughly $3 or so for 8 fries?  A little overkill if you ask me. All in all, I'd definitely come back for the burger.  It was cooked to perfection in my opinion.  I'll be sure to try out a different side hoping to get more bang for my buck.

Ooh, goodness. I went to Umami super skeptical. I had the impression that we would have to wait a long time, the service would be lacking, and the burgers wouldn't be all that amazing. I love it when I'm wrong! For a table for 4 at 6pm on a Friday, we waited 5-10 minutes at a table outside the restaurant. Service was really attentive and friendly; our server even repeated the flavors of the ice cream sandwiches 3 or 4 times without an attitude. The burgers, though they took a little while to get to the table, were phenomenal. I cannot stress enough how amazing each and every one of our burgers were. I was the first to take a bite of my SoCal burger, was knocked over by its delicious powers, and then watched each one of my dining companions get floored by the sheer joy of eating their burgers (two umami burgers and one manly burger). Amazing. The pickles, thin fries, and onion rings were all fantastic, the latter two served with ketchup infused with truffle oil. Mmmm... We topped it off with ice cream sandwiches from Milk... which apparently are ice cream filled macarons. I want more!

I love love love the MANLY BURGER.  A tender, juicy beef patty, beer-cheddar cheese, smoked salt onion strings and bacon lardons.  But what the heck is a lardon?  And does it matter?  For me it did because you can't spell lardon without lard!  I had to look it up. Thanks to Wikipedia, I now know a lardon is a small strip or cube of pork fat used in a wide variety of cuisines to flavor savory foods and salads.  So it's basically a chunk of lard.  Translation?  Like every pork byproduct, it taste absolutely delicious when added to anything! Unfortunately, the Manly Burger and it's glorious lardons are all that I love about Umami Burger.  I didn't care for the parking (valet for this place is silly-- find street parking), the wait (always a line for dinner), the prices (a bit overpriced for the size of the burger-- I could probably eat 2 of them), the regular fries (meh), the sweet potato fries (sweet meh) or the onion rings (onion meh).  I also wasn't blown away by the classic Umami Burger when I tried it.  It's just not as good as Father's Office.  Yup, I said it. Long review short, even though Umami Burger is a lot of hype, their burgers and pretty good, especially the Manly Burger.  But Father's Office is still better bang for your buck and your taste buds. 3.5 stars

The burgers were okay. I have had better burgers in LA. I did not like the Umami Burger. I did like the Manly Burger but there was nothing too unique about. I felt like I had this burger before. The best thing I ate were the onion rings. It was seasoned well and had a great texture. It is a small space and you are pretty close to the tables next to you. You can easily over hear conversations. You can even hear them chew if they don't chew with their mouth closed. For the price, I did expect much better.

I'm not a fan of burgers, but this Triple Pork Burger was pretty good. We tried smushed potatoes - nothing special. Fries was great. We loved their ketchup. They have a nice staff there. They were very quick and friendly. What I didn't like is dirty patio furniture! Table was sticky, chairs were dusty... and these pigeons were almost under our table. We enjoyed the food, but not the place. Will try Umami in the Valley..  and we'll see...

OK the life of THIS carnivore sadly coming to an end.  I am slowly losing the need to eat and the love for meat.  That being said, in the next several weeks/months I am hitting all the places that I've been wanting to visit before I nix the flesh for good. This place was recommended to me by a foodie friend so I HAD to go.  Miss SJ doesn't disappoint, and she was dead on with this place. I had the Umami Burger and the Malt Liquor Tempura Onion Rings which is what your first experience with Umami should be. This could easily qualify as my last meal on Earth.  The onion rings were fried just enough to make the batter crispy, leaving the onions inside semi raw with an awesome bite.  If you don't like raw onions, these may not be for you but they may be the best I've ever had. OK now for the awesomeness.  This burger defies all laws of all 11 dimensions of existence.  I'm still not exactly sure what all was on it, but I know there was some cheese in there...really, it doesn't matter because the first bite made me cry.  The burger was perfect.  The bun was slightly grilled and buttery/oiled.  It took me nearly a half an hour to eat because I savored every bite.  The world around me was completely tuned out.  All that existed for me at the moment was the meal. Burgers for me are like pizza.  I don't have a favorite because they are all so different that I love them for all different reasons.  Umami is like that although nothing comes close to this. My goal is to try everything on the menu before I swear off animal flesh. Service was nice and friendly and they openly expressed their own opinions on the food.  Happy happy.  I go back!

Had the pleasure to finally check out Umami Burger, and sadly to say I was not all that impressed with the burger. The portion as mentioned are not worthy of the premium price, and I was not very impressed with the oily onion rings and fries. The Asian ketchup was subpar as well. Too sweet and it reminded me of Prego spaghetti sauce. I will admit that my truffle burger was tasty, however just not as great as everyone made it out to be. Service was descent, but nothing noteworthy to speak about. Unfortunately, this place was forgettable for me. I was still hungry after my $15 burger and fries and I don't even eat large portions. One word to sum up my experience--- Oily.

Ninja, please. Overrated and overpriced...Unless you want to empty your wallets on oily, small-portioned $9-12 burgers, and kill off more trees with lots of napkins, then by all means, help yourself! Umami burger (#1 on the simple menu) = 2 stars. Too oily and too darn small. The fried piece of cheese was cute and the meat was kind of flavorful at first, until you take more bites.  Even though the patty was thicker than your average hamburger patty, it was very much drenched in heart-clogging oil and fat. Now I'm no die-hard dieter nor am I even health-conscious at all, but this was too much for me. Lots of people seemed to think the burger's very juicy. It's not juice; it's oil. Not even the tomatoes and the lettuce could add much to the flavoring of the burger. I had to use tons of napkins to wipe my hands while eating, not just afterward. The onion rings = 3 stars. Not bad, but I definitely have had better beer-battered ones at other establishments, e.g. Tops in Pasadena. Again, too oily. I forgot which burger my eating companion ordered even though I tried a piece of it, so that's saying something. I'd suggest you try Umami once. It's one of those "OMG-gotta-check-this-off-on-my-bucket-list" sort of experience. But would I come back? Most likely not.

Slow Service. Burger is pretty good.  Cramped space.  Douchebag hollywood clientele.  I'd be interesting to trying the rest of the burgers but seriously, it took 45 minutes to prepare.  Had the Umami burger which had a "lot of things on it". Too bad I don't know what they are since they didn't really describe it. It was good though, and odd.  The tempura onion rings were tasty, the fries less so.   Won't come back.  The waiting around twiddling my thumbs is just too mind-numbing.

It's a thrill just to tell people I went to a restaurant named Umami burger.  Oh yeah.

Is it illegal to have sex with a burger? Cuz after eatin at this place, I now suffer from Umamiphilia... and I'm about to do some autoerotic asphixiation with an Umami Burger in my mouth!  Well... I probably won't go that far, but I'm definitely comin back regularly. My favorite burger joint was Lucky Devils in Hollywood... but I like the taste of this a little bit better. The bread, meat and all the other ingredients mix together and just savor in your mouth.  The Original Umami Burger & The SoCal Burger are crazy good.  Can't go wrong with those options.  The onion rings are awesome and the fries are okay. They have this homemade ketchup that like puss... oops, I mean crushed tomatoes!  Pretty tasty! I should give this place 4 stars because it's small as hell, valet only and there's a long wait to eat.  But since they let you BYOB (bring you own beer) I'm givin it a 5!  So if you want a 5 star experience like me... walk across the street to A&G Food Mart and buy a 40 oz, crack it open and eat that Umami Burger like it was yo last meal!

We had a great server who was super accommodating even though we were the last table to arrive. Read some reviews about getting jive from the waitstaff, but that was not an issue for us! Everyone was awesome. That being said, they're super, super busy so cut them a bit of slack if they seem harried, I say. I also have seen some people complaining that it's expensive? $9 burger + $3 dollar fries = $12 entree-- Where else in LA are you going to get a $12 red-meat entree at dinner?! Yes, I know it's a burger. But it's a burger loaded with tons of top notch ingredients, super high quality meat that's never been frozen, and made from scratch condiments. Quit being a cheapskate, if you want it cheaper than that, go to in n out and stop whining. These guys mean business that the kitchen closes at 9pm on Sunday, so don't show up ten minutes to 9 and be a jerk about it.

Ambiance:  It was small and packed inside the restaurant and since it was still nice weather (though the end of December) we decided to eat in the patio outback.  It was quite tranquil and comfortable (some noise from the street but the heaters kept it nice). Service:  Our waitress was upbeat and personable. Food:  My favorite thing I got was the Mexican Coke (which sounds like an insult because they obviously did not make it, but I just really liked the coke).  I got the Umami burger because it was the signature (so it has to be amazing, right?) and was disappointed.  The fancy cheese doiley was hard and flavorless (undoubtedly prepared hours if not days in advance).  The mushroom on top pulled out of the sandwich after a few bites.  The burger was good, but nothing amazing.  The fries were something I was super excited for - but they were too mashed potato-y on the inside.  I was expected more crunch and was a bit disappointed.  Definitely ask for the garlic aioli instead of the ketchup - super garlicky and super delicious!  Instead of fries you should opt for the onion rings like my dining mate did - best onion rings ever!  They had a light crispy batter that was fried to perfection. Overall:  Recommended if you want to try a different burger joint - but you can probably find similarly (if not more yummy) burgers at another place where it is easier to get a seat or the price is lower.  I would go again and perhaps try another burger...maybe.

The way to one's heart is through the stomach. Sorry Umami Burger, but you didn't win my heart.   I really wanted to like Umami Burger, but I thought it was just overrated.  Yes, the burger is good... but it's definitely not the best burger I've ever had, especially if it's a $10+ burger.  And it's not something I'd feel like going out of my way of to eat at either. We were a group of 6 having lunch on a Thursday.  Street parking was easy to find on the adjacent 9th Street.  Otherwise, there's valet for $2.50.  The wait wasn't bad... the restaurant was busy, but it wasn't packed.  We just had to wait for a group to leave after having already paid for their bill... finally got seated within 15 minutes. Started out with side of their malt-liquored tempura onion rings, thin fries, and hand-cut fries.  Their onion rings were good, but extremely greasy.  My napkin was nearly see-through after I wiped my fingers clean from handling just ONE onion ring!  Their thin fries are more like regular sized fries and the hand-cut fries are more like really cubish looking steak fries.  They all come with umami ketchup, which I must say was not a favorite.  I can't say much about it... I am a ketchup fiend and I am very partial towards Heinz! We got condiments on the side: dijon mustard, house spread, and roasted garlic aioli.  Mustard had that wasabi spice to it, house spread was okay, and the garlic aioli was too much mayo, not enough garlic. Then came the burgers.  I got their new vegetarian Earth Burger, which comes with a mushroom-edamame patty with lettuce, tomato, and cheese.  It was good, but the patty was undercooked because I would've liked something crispier.  The mushy patty just fell apart as I was eating the burger and would keep squeezing out the sides and onto my plate.  The bun, however, was awesomely good.  It's perfectly toasted and keeps that nice crunch throughout eating. My friends got the Umami Burger, Hatch Burger, and SoCal Burger.  They all agreed that the meat patty was really juicy, but perhaps a bit too juicy because it just soaked up in the bun.  It seems like they might be undercooking their patties one notch below as requested... as all medium rare burgers were too rare, and the medium well was probably medium rare.   The burgers are deceivingly small looking, but my friends were pretty satisfied for their fill.  My New Mexican friend didn't like his Hatch Burger... didn't seem like he could taste the chiles at all.   Overall, I think Umami would've probably fared better with me if it weren't for the prices.  For that value, I would've expected more punch in taste and texture.  But alas, I still prefer The Counter for burgers in Southern California.

I've bumped this place up to 5 stars.  The acoustics seem to be just as bad in the main room, but there seem to be viable alternatives now.  It's way better at the "counter"--a room with counters up against 3 walls.  Apparently there's seating in the back with heat lamps too.  That might be a to-go dining area since I didn't see waiters going over there. The burgers are delicious, just like last time.  I shared an umami burger and a triple pork burger with someone.  The umami burger is pretty good, but the triple pork is like it's hotter, more successful sister--at the end of the day I'd just rather put my lips on her.  Really though, to say it's flavorful is an understatement.  It's like the first bite was an earthquake of taste in my mouth and then there were successive aftershocks of flavor.  Layers upon layers.  I may be unable to go here again and NOT order the triple pork.

I was twiddling my thumbs at the car wash next door and thought, "Sh*t, now's a great time to try Umami Burger!" At first I was like, "I paid $30 for this?!!!" After waiting 10 more minutes than was estimated, the takeout bag felt light and I felt really ripped off.  This feeling lasted only until I bit into the burger -- I stepped back a couple of steps, bowed my head and said, "Okay, I get it." The $30 was for a SoCal burger (I salivate just remembering it), thick fries (play Stonehenge with them), and for my wife, an order of sweet potato fries (standard, nothing special) and pickles (1 tiny quarter sliver of a cucumber pickle and like a bunch of pickled vegetables like carrots, onions, blech -- $5? -- pass.) Now despite its ridiculously amazing taste, the burger had three flaws: (1) There was a wad of wax paper or some other kind of paper in the actual burger which I found in my mouth whilst chewing it (turn off); (2) The bun is unusually wrinkly and on the fally-aparty side; and (3) Slightly too small to warrant the $9 cost (especially when they're not including fries or pickles with it.)  My suggestion: make it a bit bigger, include the fries -- charge $14 for the burger and fries and call it a day. I will definitely return but please, no wads of paper this time.  Thank you.

If Jules came into your house looking for Marcellus Wallace's brief case today, you better hope you have some Umami Burger sitting on your table.  Umami prides itself in being the so called fifth taste, and I think Umami Burger has found a way to use it and give everyone a tasty burger. Sure this may be my third review for the same place, but hell, I love Umami burger.  In fact, I have to thank my friend for introducing me to sweet potato fries.  I tried some of her's and I was just blown away.  Now some of you may know that I prefer onion rings over fries, and Umami's tempura onion rings are the sole reason why I prefer them over fries.   Now I have never been to this particular location, but that doesn't stop a guy like me.  Parking is the same as it has always been for LA, you either find a place where you can walk from far far away or you pay for valet.  So we paid for valet.   Now my group came about an hour and a half before closing, but they were still allowing people to come in.  It may have seemed full, but our hostess assured us we get a table in 20 minutes or less.  And we did.  But since we were a group of seven, they put us in a room with stools and high tables, with one ground table in the middle.  It was a little awkward for us, but we made it work.   The only problem with that kind of situation was that they had to hand you the burgers.  But then again, it isn't really that big of a problem.  Just something that kinda bugs you.   As usual their burgers are spectacular, filling, and  their service is equal to that if not surpassing it.   I still have to visit two more Umami locations before I can call myself a true Umami burger fan.

Finally tried an Umami Burger today and you know what?... it was good. A hamburger is a hamburger. Quality depends on type of beef, flavor and freshness. It had all 3. The price wasn't too bad either. Seating is a pain, I don't think they realized that they were going to be such a huge hit in LA. (thank you GQ) I had the Manly Burger (yes, I felt manlier after I ate it) the meat was juicy and the bacon bits were thick. The skinny fries were good served with cocktail sauce I think. We also split a pickled dish that came with a variety of pickled items. A good idea if you want some form of appetizer to split.

I was intrigued about this place just from the name alone... Umami Burger which is named after the 5th sense of taste (aside from bitter, salty, sour, and sweet) discovered by Dr. Kikunae Ikeda in the early 1900s in Japan.  He also goes on to discover MSG ... and some mild headaches.  But it wasnt until the 1980s, that umami became widely recognized as a 5th sense of taste.  For more, read on:  http://www.umamiinfo.com… Fast forward to LA, 2009... Umami Burger. This restaurant tries to emphasize unique flavors in everything they offer.  Take for example the coke from Mexico (... the soda... not the white powder). They offer coke from Mexico because it's flavored with real sugar, and not the corn syrup we're used to here.  It's subtly different.  That said... rumor has it that the burgers are so good, people make it a point not to even drink soda here so that they don't fill up on the bubbles, and have more room in their bellies to eat more burgers instead. I went with a posse the other day.  We got to share 6 different kinds of burgers: Umami Burger - w/ beef Seamami Burger - w/ scallops Truffle Burger - w/ beef and truffle flavored cheese Triple Pork Pot Roast Burger and some chile spice Burger I thought all of them had something unique to offer.  But my top 3 faves in order are the Pot Roast Burger (which is head and shoulders above anything else here), the Umami Burger, and the Truffle Burger.  If you can only try one burger, GET THE POT ROAST BURGER if you can.  It was on the specials, so hopefully they'll make it a regular item.  If you can't get that, then you won't go wrong with the Umami Burger. I thought the Pork Burger was too salty for me and the Seamami made with furikake would've been better with rice... not a bun.  (But I'm conservatively Asian like that.)   The staff was pretty friendly.  I probably would've like to have tried dessert here, but one of our friends steered us away to Milk instead... while keeping our server in suspense for our dessert order.  He appropriately gave us the stink eye for that.  Please... We should not cock tease those who only offer to give us delicious pleasure. Sorry pal.  I'll make it up to you next time.  I'll definitely be back.

I'm between three and four stars here, but I do have to say that Umami burger does make a ridiculously tasty burger, with a semi-reasonable price, given the atmosphere. The restaurant itself is extremely tiny and very trendy, with cold, modern decorations and hipster-y waiters.  Everything about this place is sparse: the tiny potted plant on the table, the number of tables in the restaurant, and the lonely burger on its white plate.  The entire experience was a little off-putting, to tell the truth: for such a casual place (we took about 25 minutes to order and eat our burgers), it feels hyped up.  I honestly don't think I would have a good time eating here with a big group of friends. Why the four stars then?  Well, the burger was simply delicious, and any number of willies was well worth it.  I ordered the umami burger, which had a truly delicious combination of flavors and textures, with a perfectly rare, juicy patty, which wasn't too greasy.  The combination of  fancy flavors (mushroom, tomato, asiago) with the perfectly cooked meat was, simply, heaven.  Sigh... I shall definitely be back. Service was fine, could have been a bit friendlier.  There is plenty of street parking, although valet is only $2.  We came around 7 pm on a week night and were seated immediately, although by the time we left, there was a crowd waiting outside the door.

I've been to almost every gourmet burger joint in LA and a few in OC, and as of this moment I believe Umami Burger makes the best burger. I've read reviews of poor service.  But my experience was the service was just fine.  In fact, I was a bit surprised at how quickly the burgers came out after ordering them.  It actually concerned me.  "Was this burger meat pre-cooked and hanging out under a heat lamp?" I wondered as I saw the waiter bringing it over to me.  But the first bite was nirvana...and so was the last one. Maybe the fact that I was there at an off-hour had something to do with it.  I was there at 4:00 PM last Saturday, which should be a slow time, but the place was full.  So if you're a little weary of poor service from the reviews you've read, perhaps try visiting at an off hour and you definitely won't be disappointed.

The definition of the signature Umami Burger: MELT. That is all. No, but really, it's one of the best burgers I've ever had. The onion rings are fabulous too, except they give you exactly 5 onion rings for $2.50 which amounts to them being 50cents each... but they're damn good. The ice cream sandwiches on their dessert menu are from MILK but they're on the pricey side ($4.50 each). You must go. YOU MUST GO.

Good gawd this place is good. I honestly think that their sides suck just because they know that their burgers are off the charts. It would be overkill if they were to have sweet potato fries akin to Father's Office combined with burgers this good. If you can't decide on which burger to order, going with the classic Umami burger is not only a safe bet, but the BEST bet. The sauce is great, the meat is tender and marinated in yummy goodness, and sinking your teeth into the bun is like falling onto a bed of heavenly feathers (bad analogy but you catch my drift). Get a side of garlic aioli to dip it in and it's golden. Fries and tempura onion rings are only needed if you feel you just need something else to munch on. You'll get a jenga-esque stack of only 9 fries and the organic ketchup tastes almost non-existence it just adds moisture. I've gotten approvals from everyone I've taken here. The ambiance is nice but thumbs down on the "art work." Just go and enjoy a burger!

Very very good burgers. Not really burgers actually, but a class of their own. Shouldn't be considered a burger joint. They're that good. However, it's quite expensive for a small-sized burger. The onion rings and fries, while good, is a very small portion. Good tasting food, but don't expect to get full on what you'd normally pay at other burger places.

Came to this place obviously to get my gourmet burger fix. Place was a bit smaller than I had expected. Packed as usual during lunch hours. Parking is limited and you may have to resort on street parking. Food review wise, I tried their Umami Burger and it tasted good rare! You will notice that the bun is glistening, I'm assuming it's the butter/oil effect. I made a mess eating this burger. The hand-cut fries were addicting. You can request to be served all kinds of sauces and condiments. The Cake Monkey Desserts were too rich for my taste. Above-all, being that it's gourmet and sit down service, expect to pay for it! Would I come back?  Maybe. I'd still drive down to any In-n-Out Burger at any given day!

Okay, a bit of a disclaimer: the food easily gets 5 stars, but some of the servers have been less than friendly the two times I've eaten at this location. So why does this place deserve an overall 5 star rating in my opinion: in a word, "Rick." Who is Rick, you ask? He's the manager of the place, and he R-O-C-K-S. Apparently, he started this location and was brought back to beef (no pun intended) up the quality again. In a city where restaurants are perpetually staffed by wanabe actors, Rick is a man who was born for (and apparently relishes) working in the hospitality industry. From a meal recommendation, to remembering customers from prior visits, to letting you stay just a bit late after the official closing time, Rick is the man you need to know. Sadly, word on the street is that he's so gifted that he will be shipped off to open/run the Studio City location in a matter of months.

2.50 for a "valet." I use quotations, because we had already parked our car, when he found us, asked for the keys, charged us, and then moved the turned the car around in the same spot. A bit ridiculous, if you ask me. ...and, $10 for a mushroom burger to go...not to mention, the $5 for a bottle of coke? Quickly found myself eating an, admittedly, very delicious $20 burger.

i had really high hopes for Umami and they did me no good. The burger is fine gourmet burger, nothing more, nothing less. It was not the flavor party I was expecting and not particularly well-constructed. The sweet potato fries were pretty good. Go earlyish if you want to avoid the wait. Or just go to Father's Office (where you'll wait too) if you want a far better burger.

Lives up to the hype for me! I am a burger critic and rarely like the ones that come recommended. I LOVED Umami. I've had the Hatch and the Umami. The wait wasn't so bad, maybe around 30 minutes on a Sunday afternoon. I loved the sweet potato fries although they were a tad soggy. Everyone else loved the tater tots. I just can't convince myself to be a tater tot fan although they were better than most I've tried. I loved the jalapeno ranch dipping sauce!

Most disgusting thing I've eaten (partially) in a very long time. This is the actual description of the burger from Umami's menu: "beer-cheddar cheese, smoked-salt onion strings, bacon lardons". Question: Do you see mustard-horseradish sauce listed? Do you? I don't. But guess what, it's on the burger! Now, other items on the menu list lettuce and onions as toppings....things that every burger eater would expect on a burger. But what person expects to have horseradish-mustard? Not a damn one! Here's why.... First, horseradish is one of the most bitter herbs on earth. Jews use it at passover to describe 450 years of slavery and suffering. So when you put it on a burger, you should probably tell the customer...but alas, they did not. Moreover, this bitter herb is part of a mustard, which is also not very well liked. Oh, and the burger is undercooked. All this for $11.00. Then a bottle of soda and regular ole thin cut fries add another $8.00 to the price. Really? This what everyone seems to love so much? I am so pissed off about this. I have been trying to get to Umami for months, but timing and schedules have never worked out. And the one other time I actually had time, the door dude told me 20 minutes, but after 45 minutes, I just left. What made it even worse is that Yahoo! just listed Umami as one of the best burger places in the entire U.S. Me:  I hated it and will never ever even consider going back.

If I were to leave LA, the one thing I can honestly say I'll miss is the Hatch Burger offered at Umami. YES! It's just that good and memorable :) I've been to the SM location and just came here tonight. Service was decent and the food came out quickly. They had there hand made large cheese tots, which were also uber delicious, and then the hatch burger came out and made my night. Why you say? Because with a few simple ingredients it gets your mouth singing soprano! It's juicy, meaty, spicy, cheesy and dripping with goodness. Love love love it!

Prices went up to 9 bucks a burger... Umami Burger Was ok...Liked everything except the mushroom on it... Also had the 4 chilis Burger...that was ok also but on the salty side.. The 6 fries they gave for 3 bucks were very good and the Umami Ketchup was a nice change up to the usual Heintz.... The Sweet Potato Chips were surprisingly super tasty...not a lot of crunch but very good spices on them... We were very disappointed that the Roasted Garlic Potato Salad isn't on the menu anymore...We were looking forward to trying them cause of the positive reviews on here...

Eating here was pretty much a mistake all around. I guess the best method of reviewing is to list all of the experience in a chronological fashion, so here we go: The parking is horrible and minimal at best. One tiny parking lot shared amongst several businesses means trying to visit Unami Burger by car will be a difficult experience. The size of the restaurant is absolutely tiny, much like the parking. Because of the small capacity, you will no-doubt be waiting a significant period of time just to get a table. Their menus are strangely lacking in detail. They give you the name of a burger and tell you you'll like it, but don't describe what's on it/in it. Despite this, I ordered the titular Unami Burger, being promised I'd "crave this one." I ordered it well-done. They don't have any typical "fountain drinks" or iced tea. All beverages come in bottles, meaning if you want more than what amounts to one glass of Coke you'll have to pay for another bottle. It took nearly 40 minutes for my party to receive its food. Mind you, we only ordered burgers and some simple sides. Nothing special, here. Upon receiving the burgers, mine was NOT well done like I'd asked. So what I got was an undercooked burger that was tasteless and overly greasy. I also had ordered the Tempura Onion Rings, which were somehow even greasier than the burger. I'm not an idiot, and I get that frying food results in grease. It's just that this food seemed to have had extra grease added to the batch! Since I work in LA, myself and my coworkers had to scurry out of here as quickly as possible to get back to the office on time. This whole burger-eating experience had already taken an hour, but our waiter didn't seem to be in a hurry. He hardly showed up during the entire experience, and when we especially need him (so we can pay and leave) he's especially absent. The food is also expensive when you consider it's rather tasteless and sure to give you indigestion. I had a burger, onion rings, and a mexican coke. $18. Lame. I'm never coming back here. (Also, the waiter said he couldn't split the bill in any way apart from half. Like, their technology didn't support it.)

I actually give this 3.5 stars. If you are into the whole gourmet burger thing, this is for you. They have a good variety of burgers, some with goat cheese as well. The burger is small, but a good size for me because I have a small appetite. I think for me, I could only go there once in a great while, because of the price and just because I don't think it's something that I would crave that often. When I want a burger, Hamburger Habit often satisfies my craving because it's a good old fashioned burger. Umami is good, still keeps the greasiness of a regular burger, but doesn't quite satisfy my burger craving because, well, it doesn't taste like an old fashioned burger. It's more gourmet and is pretty rich, and definitely tastes different. I give them props for creating a taste that I've never had before, that's for sure! I wish the fry portion was bigger though, they were fat fries, but about 8-9 in the entire serving! Sorry if this is vague, I'm having a hard time describing this place, haha! I think what it comes down to is, if I want my burger craving, I go to Tommy's/Hamburger Habit, etc. I don't think I'll go here that often only because I'm not really gonna crave it that often.

There was a time when the place first opened that I went literally twice a week. After a month or two, I kinda just got sick of the place and haven't really gone back since... but that's not their fault. I've tried every burger, and must say, each have their strengths. Regardless, their best burger remains to be the Truffle burger. The delicious juices that gooze out of this meat patty is to die for. The sides? Not the greatest offerings in the world. If anyone has had double battered Belgium fries, they must have thought... triple battered!? SHIEETT! They give you 9 fries, albiet fat, that taste single battered and gross. It's the onion rings that actually taste amazing. Try that with their garlic aioli. All this coupled with a bottle of Mexican Coke makes for a great meal. I agree with everyone else... the parking is the absolute worst.

I was in the neighborhood and decided to stop by since a friend said this was probably better than Father's Office. Arrived at 11:20AM and there was just one couple dining in. Parking sucks, they're located in a plaza with 3-4 other shops with a total of 8 parking spots, 2 of which are handicap and an additional 2 which are 15min parking only. Anyhow, upon entry I had reached the register before I was greeted by the host/waiter. I was seated immediately of course since there was an abundance of vacant seats. I wouldn't say the service was bad, but it wasn't exactly great either. The waiter did check on me periodically to see if i needed anything. On to the burger and fries. Umami burger - 9 dollars. Side of hand cut fries - 3 dollars with a table spoon of ketchup. Apparently the ketchup is self made and you're allowed one free serving per order. Although the ketchup is self made, I don't agree with charging for ketchup. It's kind of ridiculous?! Anyhow, the fries are triple cooked or something and I did enjoy it. As well as the burger. As mentioned in other reviews, the burger was a bit soggy but that's from the juices of a perfectly cooked medium rare patty. The burger was topped with tomatoes, mushroom, and something crispy. This burger was awesome and would definitely recommend this place. Too bad this joint is so far from home. Umami burger, I miss you already.

Ok, so a 2.50 valet charge to move my car literally 20 feet. Then the guy comes inside and tells me he is leaving. Why did I just give you 2.50? French Fries did not come with enough sauce nor were they seasoned extremely well. I did however enjoy them. Silly to me to serve the ketchup in a spoon and then bring me the garlic aioli in a plastic cup? Port Stilton burger was very good, I especially liked the bun. There was a lot of juice and it was pleasant at medium rare. I was not asked a temperature which I thought was bad form. The burger comes on a white plate with no garnish, and is on the small side. The service was good, and knowledgeable. Gave good recommendations. Food was out quickly and hot, I went at 4 pm on a Thursday so I would hope so. I will return but I'm not ranting and raving.

This place is so simple, yet really great! It's small so be prepared for a wait. I came on a Monday and didn't have to wait for a table, but soon after we arrived, the place got packed. I ordered the "Umami Burger"($10) which I was told was the most popular. The meat is cooked medium rare for all burgers which was perfect. I loved the Umami Burger which has mushrooms, tomato, onion, this great sauce, and probably some other stuff. I'm going to try the Miso burger next time. Sides: - Thick french fries - Cheese tots (this is off the menu & they do not always have them available but you need to try these!) - Sweet potato fries (delish as always) All the sides come with a few condiments such as garlic mayonnaise, thousand island, and ketchup.

So my sister was nonstop talking about this place so she finally took me and her boyfriend here today for an early dinner. They have a small parking lot but it wasn't packed. There was 1 customer when we went and then 2 people ordering carry out. I ordered the Triple Pork Burger (fresh ground pork, chorizo, bacon, pimento aioli and, manchego cheese) It was delicious I absolutely loved the fluffy bun. It may look small but it is definitely filling! I also ordered a side of thin fries which came out perfectly crispy. Their ketchup however isn't ordinary ketchup it had a sweet taste to it and the texture was a bit thinner than usual ketchup. I'm definitely coming back here! YUM!

I heard  of the Umami Burger and had to see what all the hype was about. Some magazine called this the best burger in so cal. Now that's a mighty bold statement and although it's a damn good burger I wouldn't call it the best. Don't get me wrong, it's a good burger but my expectation was too high. In n out is still At the top of the list for me. I didn't like the extra charge for ketchup (whats that about) and it was not even good. Keep the Unami out of the ketchup and let me enjoy my fries.

Thumbs Up! I vouch I didn't want to change my review, but my hand was forced the other night.  I still vouch for the So Cal Burger and fries,  the flavors are all solid.  However, they're still figuring out simple logistics, like handing me my to go order on its side, not flat, and having my burger rare.  If you don't want your burger rare make sure you mention this while ordering.

Went for lunch today.  What a lovely, clean, friendly environment.  Ordered the Umami burger without cheese & fries.  The burger was like butter, really good and BIG.  I think most people are used to getting baskets of fries and they give you like 8 big handcut fries and that's really all you need, it's a nice change.  They make their own ketchup so you won't find any bottles of Heinz in this joint.  It's different but really good, you can really taste all the different spices and the fresh tomatoes. I will be back again soon!

Delicious Umami burger. Mexican coke.  Horrifically long wait to dine in.  20-30 minutes for take-out.  However, your patience is worth the flavor. Was hanging out at Little Bar when the hunger pangs struck and I realized Umami was only a block away. Rather than call and place my order, I wandered over with a friend and we placed our orders in person. It might be better to call ahead with this place for take out. In the future, if I want to dine in I plan on going at 4:30 on a Tuesday. They are far too understaffed to handle the overwhelming popularity at the moment for any kind of reasonable dining hour.

To me, there is just something wrong with the picture of $10 burgers and Lexus-filled valet parking lots next to laundromats and cheap video rental stores. That is the picture painted to me by Umami burger.  The dad and I stopped by for a late lunch and this tiny restaurant was still jam-packed with hipsters and their boisterous children.  We had the Umami burger and was going to order the Manly burger but they ran out of bacon. (Not very manly, is that?) So we settled for the Hatch burger which sounded very spicy with its four types of chiles but actually wasn't. We also ordered some coke to go with our burgers because those two are a match made in heaven.  We did skip out on the fries though, thinking the burgers may fill us up enough. (At least, it should, for $10 a pop.) The burgers came and their simplicity is quite pleasing to the eyes.  The umami burger was savory, with the mushrooms, little piece of fried chip looking thing, meat and buns meshing together in a distinct, pleasurable taste.  Though it was gone in four bites, half of the thing already began to fill me up. The hatch burger was so-so. It contained too much cheese, in my opinion- and that drowned out the actual meat and bread part of the burger: the most essential parts. But half of that filled me up so I wasn't complaining cause my belly's full. The coke was in those vintage bottles and disappeared with a gulp.  Nonetheless, it was a necessary complement to our burgers.   The bill came out pretty steep and I think I much appreciate In N Out's fresh meals to this one.  Nonetheless, I felt very at peace in the serene environment of the burger joint if not a little cramped.

I am amazed how big of a misfire this place was.  Even before the food arrived and we were still excited about being there, one of the first things that became obvious was how proud of itself this place is.  Everything is so manufactured-cute with the result being that the biggest thing they succeed at impressing you with is how hard they are trying to impress.  The real problem with this though is that each thing they are trying so hard with ends up being a downfall:  mini cokes in glass bottles that just end up being affected, overpriced and small; condiments in Asian soup spoons that just end up holding almost nothing, being awkward and about as LA ridiculous as you can get for something to stick fries into; pride in their meat that they cook medium rare by default ends up being WAY undercooked, greasy, gamey and honestly just plain odd. The wait staff was pretty universally obnoxious with a failed-hipness that reminded me of  bad Apple Store employees - overly proud ones.   Three burgers, two cokes, a single side of fries and a water was $50 before the tip - these guys are high thinking they are delivering the goods to match.

This burger joint rocks! I ordered the Hatch Burger which was so juicy and flavorful. They cook it medium-rare to medium. No veggies on here just cheese and green chilies. The bun is buttered and slightly toasted so it has great flavor. Can you say greasy goodness. Another must have is the onion rings. The tempura batter makes it crispy and light. Make you wanna slap yo mama goodness! Only downside is that it's pricey and on the smallish side but so damn tasty. I WILL come again and again and again! I guess you can say i'm a fan so deal with it.

Went with a few friends and we got several burgers to share.  We thought getting 5 burgers for 4 people was good since the burgers weren't too wide.  However, we didn't factor in how thick each of them were, and turned out to be very full. Here's what we got (in order of my favorite): -Umami burger: hands down the best one.  If you only have one get this one.  Look at the pictures.  Delicious. -Truffle burger (we got 2 of these): Delicious as well, but more subtle in flavor.  Can definitely taste the truffle. -Triple pork burger: Very good, though not so memorable. -Manly burger: didn't like it too much.  The bacon was really just chunks of ham. We also had the following sides: -Pickle selection: this was good.  Spicy pickle slices were my favorite. -Sweet potato fries: didn't like these.  Sweet potato fries are good as is.  Why is it necessary to add sugar and cinnamon?  A little too much if you ask me. It's a shame they don't serve beer here.  My group had an order of the chai cola (tastes exactly like how you imagine it would) and the mango soda (very sweet). If debating between here and Father's Office, FO's burger has a certain quality to it that just leaves you more satisfied (the way I feel about Zachary's vs. Little Star, quality on the Zachary's side) than Umami.  Plus FO has beer.  But in general, I like the Umami burger better strictly for the taste/flavor (I'm not a huge bleu cheese fan, which is what FO puts in their burgers). Definitely going back.

Tried Umami Burger a while back. I got the blue cheese one, and my friend got *The* Umami Burger; and we shared them. We also split an order of the pickles, onion rings and fries. While I can't deny the taste -- you WILL 'savor the flavor' -- the burgers and especially the sides are on the smallish-side (i.e, 2 people on 1 order of fries...uh-uh...you'll be FIGHTING over the nibs -- LOL). Plus, you get the smallest dollop of condiment per order, then had to pay for extra. Really?!? I would give it 5-Stars for food quality, but factoring in the UNgenerous Price:Portion ratio brings it down to @3+.

Ode on a Greasy Bun - by John Eats What a great little discovery.   Nestled in a random mini-mall on LaBrea, I probably had driven by Umami 50 times without noticing it.  Or, if I did notice it I probably thought it was a sushi place.   This is certainly no sushi place. This IS certainly one of the best burger places in L.A.   It all starts with the bun.  I really do not want to know the calorie count of that bun, because the way it melts in your mouth reminds me of Hawaiian Sweet Bread buns that have are insanely high in calories.   I'd rather pretend that the bun was in someway a healthy choice, but no matter - that is one fine bun.   I've had the Umami Burger and the Port & Stilton Burger and both were excellent, but if I had to choose I'd go with the signature Umami burger.  The meat is of very high quality, and what I notice about it is that it hasn't been overhandled like many burgers are.   A good burger should just barely hold together.   I've heard some people complain about the size of the sides, and they do seem small when you first see them.  But I have never left hungry, so I have to assume that it isn't that Umami gives too little, it is that most places give too much! Props also are earned for their collection of "real sodas".  Personally, I go for the Abita Root Beer.   The vibe inside is great, and it looks like they might already be expanding.  Parking can be a hassle, but no worse than most places.

Truffle burger 4.5 pts-By far the best, unfortunately I was the only one at the table that did not order one. port & stilton burger 4 pts Lamb burger  3.5 pts pork maple bacon 3pts Fries and onion rings 3pts (very average) salad 3 pts sauces for fries 2 pts (have to pay for them) service 4 pts prices 2pts Walked out of here at $40/person. Yeah, I had 2 glasses of wine at $6 a glass, but how did the bill get so high at a burger joint? A burger and a half, some fries and onion rings (shared with 3 others). Quality of the burger is good but the portions are disappointing. If you are a person with a moderate appetite be prepared to order 2 burgers, and at about $10 a pop, you'll see what I mean about the bill.

I had been wanting to go to Umami Burger since I saw it featured on the Food Network.  I went on a Sunday night and the wait was about 30 minutes.  Not too long, but it was chilly and the place is tiny, so there is no room to wait inside. I was seated at the counter and ordered an Umami burger and thick-cut fries.  The server seemed like he wanted to be anywhere else, but there and the counter was weird- you faced the wall with wood paneling and nothing else to look at unless you turned around. The food arrived and it was between good and great.  Portion of the burger was on the small side, but very flavorful with a sun-dried tomato and mushroom. The burger was cooked great- on the rare side- and it was very juicy!  I also liked that they toasted the bun. The fries were also really good- they reminded me of fries you get at the fair.  :)   When I asked about dessert, the server mentioned two with ice-cream and then said "And, we have a gross cookie".  What? Really? Basically, it was a cookie he thought was dry and so he didn't want to recommend it to anyone.  Good to know! I passed on dessert. Overall, a fun experience, but I'm not really in a big hurry to go back anytime soon.  I didn't leave with that "WOW" feeling.

I've been hearing amazing things about this place.  For example, I recall a Yahoo article saying this place had the "best hamburger ever."  Quite a tall statement.  I've tried Father's Office, which this place was often compared to in terms of quality (and people have said this was better).   Well, I tried it out today.  I went to the one in La Brea, which is actually very small.  The interior is compact and clean.  Because this is a small place, a group of 2-4 would be preferred.  It is a sit-down restaurant.  The burgers cost about $10--and that's not counting the sides.   Well, my friends and I ordered the Umami burger, with some onion rings, sweet potato fries, and regular fries.  The burger itself looks small.  The meat, though, is where the magic happens.  I did't notice it at first, but it does feel kind of heavy afterwards, which is a good thing, given the size.  The burger is very good quality and "tastes" gourmet.  As hamburgers go, this is a good hamburger.  The price is still on the steep side for hamburger, I have to admit, but it's quite tasty.  The onion rings are thick and amazing.  The sweet potato fries are excellent and perfectly seasoned.  The regular fries are good quality.   The fries go for about $3 or so.   They don't serve beer here unlike the other Umami places (but there are many bars nearby if you want a beer afterwards).  There is a small lot for valet parking for $2.50.  The place's overall capacity is for about 50 people, thus you may be standing outside for a bit to get a seat.  The bathroom is unisex.     Now, was Yahoo correct about its assessment that this place has the best hamburger ever?  Well, I wouldn't go that far, but the hamburger patty is excellent--it's soft but not overly juicy.  Almost like filet mignon.   As hamburgers go, this is really good hamburger.   Does it beat Father's Office?   Well, it's different--I like Father's Office because its hamburger is almost NOT a hamburger (doesn't particularly look like a burger) and it almost challenges what a hamburger should taste like in flavor and texture--it was very novel.  Umami burger tastes like a high quality hamburger, which makes it, frankly, that.

Decided to try this out while a couple friends and I waited for a concert that was later that night.  I've never been in the area to try it out, but I decided, "Hey, why not?" This place was smaller than anticipated, and was surprisingly small.  As soon as we walked in, we were greeted and told to sit wherever we preferred.  Their menu is quite small, so it doesn't really take long to decide what to order.  I wasn't that hungry, and neither was one of my friends, so we decided to just get an order of fries and the Umami burger and split it.  Boy, that was a mistake.  Their burgers are quite small.  We split the burger in half, and we were pretty much done with the half in about three bites. The fries are good, not great.   And as we got the food, the server placed this weird sauce on the table, never said one word, and walked away.  As she passed by, I said, "Excuse me, what is this?" And she went into this lengthy response about some kind of sauce for the fries that creates an added "kick." I tried it out, it was good.  But wouldn't you want to tell everyone that when you first set it down? Especially people that have never been to this place before.  The Umami ketchup is alright, but I think I prefer regular ketchup.   All in all, this place is meh.  I'll stick to my In-N-Out that's a lot closer to my house, a lot cheaper, and a lot better.

I thought it'd be fitting to use the wise words of Bill the Butcher: "Whoopsy-Daisy!" In Short -- Umami is a great idea off to a horrible start. 5:00PM. Something went terribly wrong on the eve I ate at Umami. The place was just opening. A seemingly attentive staff waits, excited to impress. We "sit anywhere," as we are invited in and promptly order two tasty beverages. 5:10PM. It's like time itself stopped. My theory is, whoever knew how to cook and manage the seemingly attentive staff never showed up for work. 5:30PM We were served our garnishes (sliced pickles and ketchup). Really? Just garnishes...many minutes pass. Ketchup and sliced pickes do not make for good appetizers. 6:00PM. Extremely frustrated, I ask for an ETA hoping for some sign of reason. The two hamburgers we got finally arrived. One of them was too raw to eat. The had some good taste, but fell apart, crumbling out of the bun. It's one thing to make moist, juicy hambugers...but they can't fall apart. It's kind of the point -- and dare I say, art to making them. The staff tried to make up for the excrutiating wait after, comp'ing one burger at my request and throwing in some baked treats at the counter from Cake Monkey. A nice though -- but the staff needed to be on top of this situation about 45 minutes sooner. Leaving us in a starving mystery was very poor form. I only enjoyed the triple-fried french fries, which -- by the way -- needed the garlic aioli I was never served. Whoopsy. Daisy.

First off, this place may have the best tasting and best quality burger I've had in LA.   Service - I went there this past Saturday at about 3:00pm with 3 other friends.  One was a girl and she didn't really eat much, so I'm going to base this review on 3 people eating.  That being said, there was almost no one there so getting a seat and good service was easy.  I agree with Scott R. that the service quality could change if you eat there during peak hours.  Burgers came out pretty quickly without any ordering mishaps and I was pleased with that.   Food - We ordered the Umami burger, the hatchet, the pork belly and the pork stilton burger.  We also got the onion rings and fries.  The Umami was good, but the pork belly and hatch were two of the best burgers I've ever had.  Extremely juicy, good quality buttery buns and the right amount of toppings.  Not expecting there to be too much kick to a peppery burger, the Hatch was a pleasant surprise.  A lot of spice and flavor - couldn't ask for more.  The fries I could do without - too thick and not that much flavor.  The onion rings were great, however a very small serving.  We ended the meal with a coffee/toffee ice cream sandwich, which was extremely flavorful.   Overall, I would suggest planning to eat about 1.5-2 burgers if you have a healthy appetite.  Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good burger experience.  I plan on trying the Manly, Socal and truffle burger next time.

No wait when we arrived-- score! Food however, was just okay.  My friend and I split the truffle burger and the Umami burger with a side of the cheesy tater tots and onion rings.  The only thing I really liked was the truffle burger.  The truffle oil infused with the pattie gave the burger a hint of sweetness that I really enjoyed.  The Umami burger was good, but nothing exciting.   The sides were what dissappointed me though.  The cheesy tater tots were only OK.  Honestly, I think fast food joint tater tots taste better. /:  Both my friend and I agreed that the onion rings weren't that great.  He said the batter was too thick, and I completely agree. I'd still come back though, but perhaps I'll stick with regular or sweet potato fries.

I don't understand the hype over this place. The service is slow and horrible at times and the burgers are dripping in grease. It's a heart attack waiting to happen! Went here twice and will probably never go again. The first time we ate at the restaurant was at off peak lunch time. The wait was semi long, but was ok. Once seated we waited forever for the server to come and take our order. Once we ordered it took forever to get our order. We ordered the regular Umami burger, the one with the truffles, and the tempura onion rings. It was so greasy! If I rubbed it on my face, pimples would have instantly appeared!  The aoili for the onion rings was pretty good though. The second time I really was reluctant to order anything from there, but since my mom had never had it and wanted to try it we ordered from there. This time though we ordered our burgers to go.  We ordered the hatch burger and one other that I can't remember, and fries. When we brought everything home they forget to put in our fries! We called and let them know and they said we could come and pick them up. It's not like I live in the neighborhood, and the amount of gas used to get me there would have been a big waste. Def not worth it. With that being said, you're just paying THEM to clog your arteries with an attitude.

Went here on the way home from work to see what was all the hub-bub about. I've been wanting to try this place for a while seeing how it was featured on ThrillList, and the NPR Podcast of Good Food. The place is off of 9th and La Brea. They have a lot you can park in, but I recommend to park off of 9th in the neighborhoods. The place is nicely decorated  and I heard they have a live DJ on weekends. The service is very cordial and they were very fast. I went there at 3:00 p.m. on a Thursday so there was no one there. I'm sure at night and on the weekends it's totally hopping. Bought a Truffle Burger. 11 bucks with no fries, but since i'm a nurse the recession doesn't exist to me so I bought that, fries, onion rings and a Diet Coke. The burger WAS SO LEGENDARY. I like them almost more than I like Father's Office or Barney's Burgers in Brentwood! The bun was soft and the meat was moist. Most people say it's too salty, but honestly I think it's the flavor of "umami" that they were going for. The homemade ketchup was "Meh" to me. I'd rather have regular Heintz. Their garlic aioli was creamy and wonderful. Their fries were tasty and crispy, but yeah, they should include more fries or just include the handful with the burger. I also ordered their malt-liquor onion rings, but I found them too oily. The waiter was very nice and forgot to charge me and bring me my Coke and just gave me a freebie! All in all, the food is awesome here. Definitely not the healthiest, but worth giving it a try. Needs a liquor license.

I want to give this place 5 stars but their fries prevent me from doing that. While the fries are cheap they kinda suck. The onion rings were okay. I also didn't like their portion controlled ketchup on a soup spoon thing. I don't like it when restaurants limit my ketchup/ french fry dipping sauce intake. Anywhoo on to the burger. we got the port and stilton burger and no dry edges. weee. It was delicious from the slightly red/pink middle to the brown edges. I forget the details since it's been awhile since I've had it but all I remember is how moist the meat was and how I would love to have more moist meat. I'd rather have Umami than Father's Office.

Went back to the Umami for the first time since my initial take out experience. The good news is the burger are still ridiculously delish. The bad news is   the service sucks and they are overcrowded. THE GOOD: Tried the truffle burger. Amazing. The Italian cheese with a cream sauce was heaven. Even better than the Port and Stilton. The bun is still the tastiest I think in all of LA. Soft and flavorful. THE BAD: We had to do the name on the list thing which I am totally fine with. But they gaffed it up and skipped over us serving people who just came a few times. 45 minutes of waiting. Our waiter was a total DB and continuously messed up our order. No aioli sauce for our fries and onion rings, no water, etc. They also said they weren't serving outside, then they were, then they weren't. They basically are not running an efficient set up and could seriously use a good restaurant manager. They also authorized my card for what appears for another person's table in the amount of like 60 bucks. WTF? Now I have to keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't turn into a charge. The have a valet for $2 in a parking lot that needs no valet. ---- I've noticed some posts regarding the size of the burger as small. It is true that they are 'euro portions' but that is one of the reasons I like this place. You leave feeling satisfied instead of full. Which is how you really should eat. If you want to get stuffed head to 25 Degrees. That being said I still think the #1 burger experience still rests with 25 but Umami is my #2. With a better service they could contend in the future! But I look forward to going back to try the other burgers.

What? I haven't reviewed this place yet? Doh! The food - Frufru burger!!! haha Yes, but it does taste pretty good and it is unique - well at least the Umami one is. It's savoy yet...a tad sweet - MSG! I'd definitely recommend trying this place at least once. The meat is also very melt in your mouth tender. I wouldn't recommend ordering the fries since they're basically steak fries (but you only get a few sticks). The price - It's pretty expensive for a small burger - $9.50 or more. But hey, worth a try ...again the Umami! Don't get persuaded by the other burgers like my fiance did! They taste like a normal burger. Oh, and skip the fries. =) The ambiance- It's a very small place, so don't bring your massive posse over unless you're willing to do take out (not even sure if they do that) or wait a while for a room in the back. It's very ideal for a date place or small hang out. Not much to look at though, and not much outside to look at either. The service - Good. They serve you in a timely manner and your drinks get refilled. =) Go for the umami burger and skip the rest =) I'll only go back on a special occasion or if my blood is feeling particularly rich. =p

It's not your ordinary burger place. Period. I came here on Saturday to taste what everyone's been talking about. I came here 6pm and it was almost completely full, except for that really dark room where they have a bar and one table, which was occupied. I don't even understand why they have that room. It's so dimly lit! As for the rest of the restaurant, it's kind of small but well-lit and the door is somewhat contemporary. They also have an outdoor patio that was empty when I arrived. However, during my meal, the restaurant, except for that dark room, was completely filled and the patio was also filling up to the point where they were making a waitlist. If you want to go during the busy times, I wouldn't go with more than 4 people in your party. It might be difficult to get a table. Since I was the only person in my party, I was invited to sit in the really dark room at the bar and after going in there, I declined and asked for a table. I actually would like to see what I'm eating especially since it was my first time there. Luckily some people did leave when I came in so they cleared that table for me. I ordered an Umami burger, the onion rings, and a Mexican coke. Service was pretty prompt and attentive. As for the food--wow. I have never had a burger was so tasty. It wasn't like anything that I had before. The onion rings were perfect too. Both of those with a Mexican coke--amazing. Despite a lot of reviews on here, I thought the burger was well-sized. The burger, onion rings, and coke was very filling for me. The food itself is 5 stars. Parking. I didn't valet my car. I just parked a couple blocks away in the neighborhood. Saved me $2.50. As for the rest of my experience there, it was just ok. There is a pretentious and stuffy vibe to the place. As much as I enjoyed the food, I would rather order out than eat-in.

After all the hype I had to try Unami.  The place was about half full of patrons. After ordering it took about 25 minutes to get our burgers. It came out luke warm and medium rare. Since we needed to go to an appoinment there was not enough time to return it . The waitress said that is the way  this chef happens to make them and they will come out different if another chef made them. To me that is B S. They should ask the customer how they want them.   About 5 minutes after receiving the burgers we got the sweet potato fries that we ordered. They were good but they should come out with the burgers.  Overall it is overpriced for what you get and the food left a lot to be desired.

This place, these reviews, are all a gag, right? Everyone in the world, at least the burger blogosphere world, has been talking about this burger for over a year. It wasn't referred to in muted tones like the 2nd coming, but quickly became the 3rd, 4th, and 5th coming as Umami spread its wings across L.A. One usually knows what's coming when a restaurant expands this fast. I wanted to come away from popping my Umami cherry with OOOOOOOOOOh. Ahhhhhhh. Or at least with "Umami?" YOUR MAMA! Something clever. Los Angeles Burger Reporter Larry the Lawyer and I went to explore a couple places today, when I told him of this upcoming tour, I suggested he pick one that is 'massively popular', and one or two that he liked personally. Umami was the massively popular pick, with the runner up being The Foundry. The Foundry wasn't open for lunch today, so we waddled into Umami and sample their wares. We were at the original location, which is smallish, but large enough for valet parking. We ordered the signature burger, @ $10, and a side of hand cut fries (triple cooked the menu says), and a side of rings ("Malt Liquor Tempura Onion Rings") $3. (3.50 for the fries). Larry had a mexican coke, and me in my nightshirt, and he in his cap, I had plain old tap h2o. So what IS umami? The fifth "taste" in our lives, following the four horsemen of the taste apocalypse: sweet, sour, salty, bitter. Some call umami "savory" and believe it belongs with the other four. For a further explanation of this (IF you must have one, refer to Umami Burger's treatise here. For a kinder, gentler explanation, see Wikipedia's entry. So the story goes, some guys, somewhere, one day, were sitting around and came up with the whole umami thing and decided to exploit it via the perfect umami vehicle, hamburgers. In checking our vast world-wide network of sources, one of our investigators turned up a transcript of that first session, we reprint it here, without permission of the participants: (Fade in, two men sitting in a booth at a nondescript diner) George: You have to taste this burger, Jerry, it's most excellent. Really SAVORY. Jerry: Why the heck isn't savory one of the four "tastes' anyhow? It really gets a bump rap. George: No foolin'. Even Steinbrenner would agree with that. Jerry: I think it needs a name, a definition, something unique. George: Youmama it does! Jerry: No, that's not quite right (furrowed brow, thinking). We'll think of something, and we should open our own diner featuring this new flavor. George: That would be difficult, since this flavor isn't really defined. You know, it's really NOTHING. Jerry: Yep, we should have a diner that features NOTHING as a flavor. We'll make millions! And the rest is history, as they say. We were served our umami burger, cut it in half to share, it was topped with some condiments, indistinguishable, and a smidgen of mushroom and slice of tomato, both of which appeared to have come thru a half hour in the microwave. The menu says all beef burgers are cooked "medium rare", but that's subjective, isn't it? Everyone has their own definition of cooking stages, as we were to learn later in the day. Anyway, a bite....two. And a collective WTF? Really folks, this is the emporer's new clothes of burgers. It's about NOTHING. Truly. Get over it. The onion rings could have been from anywhere, and while the beer flavor comes through, Umami also gives new definition to the concept of "tempura," leaning towards way too thick of a batter.  Don't even get me started on the fries.  Boys, if you wanna try this kind of thing, go check out "potato souffles" in New Orleans. Damage? $22 for food and drink, $4 for parking. Save your money folks, move on...these aren't the droids you are looking for.  Apologies if there are typos.... I was still laughing as I wrote this.

I remember the FIRST week this place opened. I went there while they were still figuring out their menu, and I honestly STILL get the amazing burgers since.. I do miss living 3 blocks away from this location, but I'll always say this one had the best staff + kitchen. I absolutely love their Manly Burger, and I must go back to have it. A+!!!!!!!!!

I've tried a lot of burger places by now.. Father's Office, Hole in the Wall, Truxton's, The Counter, Blue Dog Beer Tavern... Maybe I shouldn't be admitting to this outright lack of willpower... Oh well maybe these reviews will help you decide how to effectively "place" your caloric intake, no? I came to Umami around 6:30PM on a weekday. Totally empty. Actually it was quite funny because when we were walking by, the workers staired at us intently. When we actually opened the door, they all cheered! On to the food. Nothing to write home about. But apparently something to write on yelp about. I first heard a lot of hype about this place from a friend from U$C. She said she had converted to Umami. Basically it was a must-try. So it was a big letdown. Too greasy and too small for my liking. I didn't like how their buns were even oily.. I'd recommend FO for an uppity burger and an uppity beer. Truxton's and Hole in the Wall are a close tie for straight up manly burger tastiness. No homo.

Okay, I am not going to lie, I enjoyed my burger, It was good. I had the Hatch Burger and My friend tried their signature Umami Burger, which i took a bite of. The Hatch is smothered in cheese and is complemented well with peppers that add a mellow but welcomed spice. The Umami has that bit of grilled cheese that was on the girl a little to long so its a bit hard, but is a welcomed textured in  the burger. The best part of both of them was the patty. It's juicy and rich and delicious, other burgers dream about having that patty's flavor Those were the pro's now here are the buts. 1) I mentioned I took a bite of my friends burger, and I was worried I was going to eat all of it. They are kinda small. They are a little bigger than sliders.  I mean I understand I am paying a little more for better ingredients (both burgers were $10), but i would have liked a little more there. 2) Fries and other sides must be purchased separately, nuff said. 3) this venue was a little bit too small and the patio outside felt a bit crowded almost like an after thought to the initial restaurant. In closing, is it worth the hype? no, but is it a tasty burger, yeah. Give it a shot.

Alright...so maybe this isn't the fairest of reviews considering I had burgers delivered by a friend who was stuck in traffic for a good bit before they arrived.   BUT...I will say...I didn't think the burgers lived up to the hype.  I was in the minority in my group, but I don't mind being a rebel.  I went with the SoCal burger with butter lettuce, slow-roasted tomato, house spread, house-made american cheese, & carmelized onions.   I just couldn't get past the bun; I just thought the bun was really funky; the flavor was very sweet...I dunno.  I had a couple bites of the Umami Burger which I thought was better but still I was hung-up on the bun.  The onion rings were extremely greasy so no matter how good the condiments they still couldn't be saved. Plus if you get a drink, burger, and side it could set you back $20...

They have good burgers. They are the perfect size too. the truffle burger is delicious. The umami burger has a piece of fried cheese. It looked cool. The twice mashed potatoes are really good with the garlic aoili sauce. They have sodas in glass bottles! It sucks that its valet parking. Or you can park on the streets but its only 1 hour limit

I'm giving it 4 stars, but the price is a little high and since I consider price as one of my rating measurements, it should be 3.5 stars. First we'll look at location and this isn't the greatest location. Second we'll look at decor and dining experience, which was good, very stylish and modern, but the seating for singles or one person, is not the greatest. They stick you in a box room on a bench that faces the wall, so it's not an inviting eating experience, unless you're with another party. Third the Umami Burger is great if you don't mind dropping $23 with tip for Burger, Fries and a drink. Taste was great and the consistency was great. I'm not sure I'll go back unless it's to treat myself on payday :) I found it interesting that there was waiters and waitresses also, for such a small place. It seems they would make more money with a counter to order, then a lobby cleaner / hostess. Overall it was a good meal, enjoyable and a nice place, but a tad expensive for a burger joint IMO.

One of my best friends from college and his mother trekked down to LA bound for Redlands to pick up the little one from college.  They happened to be in the Mid-LA district and called me up for dinner and decided to choose Umami Burger for dinner.  I have heard about this restaurant many a times, and it has been on my list of places that I had to visit.  Needless to say, I was wholeheartedly satisfied with my visit! The Setting Located on La Brea between Wilshire and Pico, it's situated on a busy street.  Parking isn't so bad--did valet at $2.50--fast and worth the money.  The dining area is fairly small and compact--wished it was a bigger restaurant b/c the small tables make the dining experience a bit un-relaxing, but it's easy enough to make a conversation with your friends. The Service Throughout the Dining Experience The reason I gave my rating 4/5 stars is because of the 1 star that knocks down the service.  I'd have to say 90% of the time, the service was excellent--the waiter knew the ingredients of each dish VERY well and occasionally cracked a few jokes.  VERY friendly and upbeat guy, however did not get our orders correct a few times.  Another gripe would be serving appetizers AFTER our main dishes are served--aren't they supposed to be served BEFORE the main dish? Hrmmm Taste of the Food I ordered the Umami Burger.  Danng, it was freaken delicious.  I don't know what the trick is but seriously, it's THE best burger I've had (excluding all fast food--not in the same category).  The meat was tender and the bun was crisp.  My friends ordered the garlic fries and those were just as delicious.  You just have to go there for the food for sure. Price Very fair price and well worth every dollar.  Not terribly expensive. Overall I'd go back there any minute.  I just hope service will be a tad better next time.

I changed my mind. After starting my search for the best burger in town, this has to be one of the better burgers! I was blinded by the determination how much I didn't like the "foo-foo-ness" made out of this man-meal. Not the best, but a close second for sure!

Eats: Truffled Poutine Burger Let's get this straight: Umami burger is heavily hyped by as many people as those who wonder what umami even means. Regardless, hype brought me in to this place. Like many other LA establishments, it looked like Umami was converted from a tiny storefront. It did not look like space and capacity would suit this location, but I cannot comment since while the dining room was full, there was a vacant equally sized outdoor patio. Thankfully I got a spot underneath 2 heaters, but I could not say the same for most other seats in the patio. The Truffled Poutine Burger that I ate wasn't a normal menued item at Umami. The limited edition item was a bunless medium rare patty, truffled cheese, sprinkling of shiitake, covered in truffled gravy, and served over fries. Almost low carb, till you get to the bottom. It was a tasty meal with much of the flavor coming from the truffled gravy. I didn't get the same truffle sensation as I get eating other truffle fried goodies (like tator tots!), so it was a bit of a let down. I was pretty intrigued by the amount of dipping sauces, but I did limit myself to just the garlic aioli. I'd like to try the jalapeno ranch next time as I usually have ranch with my fries. This place will be revisited, and when I do, I'll have the namesake Umami Burger.

I really, really want to give Umami 5 but I just can't!  My friend had been raving about Umami for days, weeks before my visit and I was so, so excited to take my first bite. Beforehand, we stocked up on 3 bottles of vino for the BYOB.  We were disappointed to be told that they were no longer BYOB nor did they have a liquor license and did not serve any alcohol at all.  I swear, I heard hearts shatter and livers jumping for joy.  My friends were bummed x 219032. Fun LA fact: BYOB restaurants are sparse unlike in Chicago (where they are a dime a dozen).  So this is a real treat for the Californians. We sat down and ordered onion rings to start.  Food consoles the soul.  I eat my feelings.  The onion rings were yums; however, only 6 come in an order?  Not enough to satisfy.  I proceeded with the Truffle Burger (Italian Truffle Cheese and Truffle Glaze) and an order of big, fat hand-cut fries. MMM yeah.  The burger was cooked to perfection.  The meat seriously just melted in muh mouth.  It was a damn good burger. I'd go back to Umami.  In a heartbeat.  But I'd love a reason to give it the 5th star...  something was missing and I'm not quite sure what it was.  Man, I sound like a John Mayer song right about now.  I'll end it now.

A perfectly cooked burger is one of the most pleasurable foods and Umami delivers!  You only have 2 options when it comes to doneness here, well or medium-rare and being the bloody carnivore I am I could only go with medium-rare.  The location is very small and the parking situation looked like a nightmare so I opted to pay for the valet (not too bad at $2.50).  M and I managed to get there about five minutes before the big rush and were seated in the front area, the table were a little cramped together but the music did a good job of droning out other conversations. Lets dish on the dishes: Sides:  M & I both started with the house salad ($4) and it was nice to have a simple mixed green salad not slathered in extra ingredients.  The dressing had a salty undertone which complimented the natural bitterness of the spring greens and the cooks dressed the salad perfectly as well.  I would definitely order it again.  Next, we split an order of the malt tempura onion rings ($2.5).  These were good as well but a little pricey for just 6 rings.  The batter was very light and the rings were only slightly greasy but still tasted very fresh.  No comment on the side ketchup, very unmemorable. Burgers:  I ordered the Hatch Burger, medium-rare.  The burger was cooked perfectly and came out very hot (+++ in my book).  The peppers complimented the cheese and spread giving a very umami-ish taste.  I loved the bun and wish I could buy them for my own burgers!  M ordered the So-Cal Burger, medium-rare with the garlic spread on the side.  This burger was good too, but I preferred mine more.   In summary, I would definitely come to Umami again but would be more willing to try FO or Golden State first.  And I want to get my hands on that scallop burger in the future!

Fine burgers at its best! So glad that there are more places that are actually taking time to improve such an easy menu and make it their own! You will never have burgers with flavor like this anywhere! My husband and I went 4 times in the first few weeks we tried it! Its best to get to or three (depending on your appetite) and split them up so you can try their awesome fusions of flavor! Man as far as favorites go its a hard tie with the port/stilton and the truffle! Ok I do have to agree with many the parking 'issue' is a pain, but this is La Brea people, you have to anticipate a certain amount of this! Its like the beach area always an issue. Need to check out the other location to see what that one is about!!

Don't let the three stars fool you. It's not that mediocre. The burgers are actually really good. Who these days will really cook your burger rare when you ask for rare. I cannot not count how many times I had to send burgers back because it's overcooked. I want mine rare, and rare is how i will have it. The burgers are perfectly cooked and juicy to boot. The portion size is not too big or too small but just filling. Enough to satiate your burger frenzy cravings. (or maybe I'm the only one who experiences this) The perfectly cooked burger patties, with the crispy / greasy buns, and semi interesting toppings... nice! BUT this is where they fall through. Learn to make your fries like Wurstkouche or Father's office. The fat fries are flavorless and it definitely needs the aiolis. The ketchup... needs something. Spicy ketchup? Curry Ketchup? something? jump on the band wagon and spruce up your ketchup if your fries are going to be just a fat piece of potato. Onions rings taste just like onion tempura... bland. No flavor whatsoever. I ended up using that as a means to taste the different aiolis I asked for. The pickle platter was rather interesting and offered something different to be consumed with the burger.... and finally the desserts. It was from Milk and somewhere else, but dingdongs and ice cream sandwiches... it's good. But I wish they would come up with something of their own and make things a little bit more interesting. All in all, the small space, long waits, bland sides, and PAPER table covers (which I Dread), the burgers are one of the best. I would rank the Father's office and the Spotted Pig above here, but it was def. better than the Counter, Apple Pan and such. Stick with the Umami, Stilton and Truffle is my reccomendation.

Umami burger is good, maybe great... but I don't know. You're going to pay at least $10 a burger then add a drink, add fries or onion rings, etc. Ehhhh.... Not that big of a fan, it was a great burger but to be honest I would have rather had a Grill Em All truck burger. I tried 3 burgers, the Umami burger, the Manly burger and the Diablo. Umami burger was good but standard, kind of lacking, the F.O. burger is better in my opinion and has more flavor. Manly burger was it, this was the shit. It has like cheese, bacon, and maybe a sauce on it, and it was the best thing I had. The diablo is not on the menu it's supposed to be a hot & spicy burger but it was really a let down, it has blue cheese, peppers and some diablo sauce... not impressed and to be honest it tasted weird.. All in all I would come back to Umami but I wasn't that thrilled, better burgers to be had and found.

This restaurant was one of the recommended restaurants from a book called "eat shop los angeles", so I gave it a try. I am not a big fan of burgers but I really liked their Umami burger! http://www.yelp.com/user… Their beef is ground in house & served medium rare.  Umami is a loanword from Japanese meaning "good flavor" or "good taste". It was little hard for me to look for a parking space because of restricted street parking. But it is only $2.50 to valet so that's what I did. Great music selection, too!

I never have considered burgers classy and sexy until now. I tried the umami and the hatch burger and all I can say is JUICYYY. The umami burger was so succulent and the hatch burger had juice spicy and then juice. MMMMMM. But a couple things that I really liked weren't the burgers! (Go figure.) The sweet potato fries and the onion rings are delish. Everything is super crispy and not very oily surprisingly! But the one thing I LOVED about the onion rings is... well you know when you can bite into an onion ring and then you don't bite it down enough so the whole onion comes out of the tempura part when you pull? Yeah, that doesn't happen with umami's onion rings! They're so tender and delicate! I was thoroughly pleased. I also really enjoyed the different sauces that they offer. I would recommend the garlic aioli, the jalapeno ranch, and the umami ketchup! But, aren't a fan of burgers, fries, and overall delish mouthgasms? Well UMAMI still offers something worth your visit! So umami has these cups.... BUT THEY AREN'T JUST ANY CUPS. They are these transparent plastic cups that bend! It really is interesting if you love design. Also, the cup has this indention for your thumb so it's easier to hold! MUAHAHA. I loved it. I almost stole it. Maybe next time... Next timeeeeeeee. Tip: Find street parking. Once you turn into the small valet lot next to the restaurant, it's game over. You ARE going to do valet. It's so small that it's hard to back out into the street safely...So much ppl just do valet once they turn in. Tricky tricky you, Umami! So find street parkin' and unbutton your pants. :)

Upgrading to 5 stars because I'm seriously addicted to the Hatch Burger and must eat it once a week. I'm detoxing for 2 weeks and the fact that the only thing about the burger I can eat during that time are the chilis is killing me. Also, a lot of people bitch about the small condiment portions. I usually get my food to go from this location, but they have resolved the issue at the Cahuenga location. Last time I ate there, they gave my brother and me as much as we wanted and charged us for one ketchup.

Wow...talk about overyhped. I went to this place and we had to wait 1 hour to sit. When we did finally sit, it was at a counter that was still dirty from the previous occupants with ants crawling on the side. We ordered our 10 dollar burgers and ate it. Now, the burger is actually quite good. Meat was juicy and fill with spice. The bun didn't break apart, so that was good. However, I was able to finish the burger in about 4 bites. It was pretty small for a 10 dollar burger. I left hungry and actually went somewhere else to eat. If you don't mind paying 10 dollars for a good burger that won't fill you up, go here. However, the burger isn't so good that it's worth the price and portion.

Please note: I don't eat red meat so this is a review of the non-red-meat items on the menu (the few but great) I had the umami burger (with portabello instead of meat) and the Greenbird (turkey burger), as well as the side special, the cheesy tator tots.  No, I didn't eat all of that by myself, I shared :)  Let me just say.. YUM. The turkey patty was so flavorful and moist; each bite was full of flavor.  The portabello was also amazing, and a good complement to the other two things.  The burgers are sized perfectly for me; I went in pretty hungry and walked out quite full.. but I can see how a guy with a big appetite might need two, or at least one and a half.  Total bill after tip came to $16 each, which to me is only one dollar sign. I guess for those with a larger appetite who need to order more food, it can be a bit pricey. We had to wait about 30 minutes for a table, but that's to be expected on a Friday night. Please note that this place is pretty small, so don't come with a big group or you'll be waiting forever. The burger my friend had looked like it was pretty rare for medium-rare. But then again, I don't eat red meat so what do I know :) I can see how others have complained about this, though. Tip: You can't park on the sidestreets on the same side of the street as the restaurant after 6pm, but I found parking on one of the sidestreets on the other side of La Brea.  Valet is only $2.50 though.

Okay, I'm a sucker for new-age hamburger-like contraptions, honestly. I love places that offer me a hamburger in ways I would've never even conceived of (pardon my preposition). Umami is awesome. We got the Triple Pork Burger and the Truffle. I can say that the Triple Pork one was friggin' delicious but I wished I had personally gotten an actual beef burger, especially after I tasted my friend's! The meat was wonderful! And all the burgers were really unique. The downside is that they're rather small. I would gladly eat a pound-size hamburger if it was put in front of me, so that was a little disappointing--but it's so unique and rich that it was okay. Also, sweet potato fries and umami ketchup--all I can say to that is "hell yes". I love sweet potato fries by default, but the special ketchup made it even more delicious. Random plus side: There's a little electronic thing (a Presto, I think it was called) that you can use to a) view the menu, b) pay, c) play games, etc. Made for a nice little bonus to the meal. Only real down sides: Pricey ($10-11 for standalone burger), and the burgers are rather small. Definitely hit it up if you like unique takes on hamburgers. Parking-wise, there's some street parking available after 7 and also $2.50 valet service right next to the restaurant.

Decided to come here as my boyfriend is a complete carnivore and had been recommended this place.  We didn't make a reservation so when we got there we had to wait about 15-20 mins for a table.  There wasn't a bar to wait at so we waited outside and it was pretty cold outside that night (made me a bit grumpy as I have no ability to tolerate the cold whatsoever!) Anyways, we placed out orders.  I got the signature Umami burger - and I have to say I was a little disappointed.  The burger was cooked very well and the waitress was very helpful.  I dunno though, that something special was just missing though, and to be honest that 'umami' taste was just a bit strange.   I wouldn't rule out coming here again though, the food is good, but not as great as it's made out it to be in my opinion.

I loved the burgers.  DO NOT get me wrong.  This place is amazing.  The food is uber-delicious.  I loved my truffle burger and my boyfriend loved his Umami burger.  Straight up reminds me of Shake Shack in New York City. HOWEVER THE SERVICE IS TERRIBLE.  I understand that they are busy but Jesus Christ.  We ordered water.  Never came.  Napkins had to be asked for.  We ordered a sweet potato salad that just never came.  They ran out of fries and just gave me onion rings assuming that I would be okay with that (not really - I am more of a fry person).  Everything had to be asked for twice.  That's ANNOYING regardless of how yummy the food is. I will likely go back soon HOWEVER I would like to get it TO GO.

Hello hype, I know you. You fucked over my childhood in the eighties with your promises of bliss through overpriced toys portrayed bursting through walls amid backlit plumes of smoke and screeching guitar riffs. You made me terrorize my parents for those things, and warped my expectations of satisfaction. This place would have gotten an extra star if not for their shameless self-promotion; which involves a claim to have violated the physiological laws governing our taste buds. I refer to the "fifth taste" -- the eponymous "umami" -- touted to reside solely in their signature burger. I burdened my friend's conscience with the threat that I'd karate chop an endangered tortoise if she failed to join me experiencing the antineutrino of the flavor spectrum. O, consumerism. O, great hype. You tosser. To be honest, I expected this chimeric flavor to be MSG. Heaps of it. But it wasn't even that. It joins perpetual motion and cold fusion in the bone yards of bullshit. I want one fifth of my money back; a refund on the missing fifth flavor. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad burger at all. It's tender and juicy, served on a nice chewy roll with a weird fried cheese snowflake thing. In fact, the people seated at the next table went for another round immediately following their first. But while that means it's tasty enough, it also implicates it as a small burger. And this Amurrica, n'we don't cotton to that shit. Actually, it's fine, I'm just being an ass. Sadly, no booze for sale. If I'd known in advance it was BYOB, I'd've BMOB. But they do have an annoyingly long list of sodas that are pretty good, and the staff is friendly and attentive.

Three words.  De-li-cious.  A tiny hole in the wall with no more than 7 to 8 tables.  I really enjoy restaurants that stay true to a limited menu and know how to cook it well.  Or should I say medium rare?  Joking aside this place has some kick ass burgers.   What I ordered: Hatch Burger: 4 types of green chiles plus I'd say about a half pound of meat. (Most restaurants that serve a spicy item on the menu are tame by my standards, but this was a pleasant surprise.  Not only were the chilies spicy, but the burger was very flavorful.  I would have gobbled this down sooner had it not been for the sides or onion rings and fries.) Hand Cut Fries: $3 (Delicious is the word for this review.  ) Malt Liquor Tempura Onion Rings: $2.5 (Delicious)     Dips: Umami Ketchup( More like marinara sauce, not my fave), Garlic Aoli (tasty) In summary, a great place to get a fantastic burger at reasonable prices.  I'm planning to go again and if its a winner twice this review goes to 5 stars.   Decor:3 Food:4 Service:4 Would I go back?  You bet your pastrami I would!

Umami was mm mmm yummy!! Visited Umami with my BFF last night for a quick dinner. It looked a bit crowded but we were immediately seated in a small back counter section. We were promptly greeted and our orders were taken. Doing my research on Yelp first I knew exactly what I wanted...the Truffle Burger with a side of fries! The burger was served pipping hot, juicy and on a delicious brioche type bun. The burger wasn't too heavy, tender but could've used a bit more cheese :)  The french fries were great! In the pictures they look like the standard steak fries but they are definitely not! The fries are solid pieces of potato- cripsy cooked and served with their Umami Ketchup (which I really didn't think was all that different from regular ketchup). Now I've seen the reviews with service issues but that wasn't the case for us. From the host to the server to the valet- everyone was super nice and friendly. I was a bit nervous sitting in that back room that we would be neglected (even though the place is super tiny) but that wasn't the case. Our drinks and food were brought out promptly and our server had been back and forth checking on us as well as others in the room. The service wasn't spectatular but it was far from bad.

This is how not to do a burger: Take a really soft, no depth bun. Top said bun with some ingredients that sound really good when you describe it-- like parmesan crisp, mushrooms, house ketchup.. Tell me that the burgers are made medium-rare and make me believe this will make the burger taste better. Add the meat + the well-described toppings to the sad bun. Have the blood from the mooing burger totally soak into the bun making it soggy and gross and rendering it impossible to eat. Make me so concerned about how I can't eat this burger that I completely forget to try to enjoy it and when, I stop to do so, realize the toppings aren't a wow factor. Also, tell me about how the sweet potato fries are on a special and get me so excited but then have them taste like crap. --- Yes, It's cute and charming but I make better burgers in my backyard.

favorite burger(s) ever. I recommend going with a few friends and ordering at least one or two more burgers than people at the table just so you can taste everything. If they have the lamb burger, you must order it - the seasoning and texture are outstanding. Only wish they had a liquor license like the Hollywood location.

Oooh mami! This place brings me back to Yelp. Take a bite into this thick, juicy, raw meat patty, crispy cheddar, caramelized onions and sauteed shitaki mushrooms all nestled between two soft, round and fluffy buns. Now repeat this descriptions in your low and sexy voice, I call this the sexy burger. Yummy!!! Who knew eating a burger could be so hot! Oops, wrong website! Back to business, this restaurant is good for groups, mainly because you can share the entire selection of burgers there. My favorite came out to be the House Burger. It had just the right amount of seasonings that satisfied both your sweet and salty palettes. Umami also serves sodas in old school glass bottles and have super delicious root beer floats with rich and creamy vanilla ice creams. Overall, awesome experience and great food that will leave you licking your fingers at the end.

Honestly I was disappointed in this place. I initially heard this place through a friend on facebook who's status claimed she had experienced a "mouth orgasm" from the burgers here. "Sounds pretty good" I thought to myself and so I proceed to do a little more research eg. look up this very page. Reviews were mostly positive so I thought I'd try it. The place is small and the decor was pretty modern and stylish, the menu was simple. The first burger was the original and stated "You will crave this burger." Okay lets put it to the test. The burger came by its lonesome self, placed on a large white plate with no distractions. Obviously I was supposed to focus on the burger with no other tastes to take away from it. The patty was a fair size but the toppings were completely hidden between the patty and the bun. There was a single tomato slice, a single mushroom, and some other stuff-  it looked like McDonalds the way the toppings were squished down like that- the point is the toppings were lacking. I was hungry. My first bite was quite delicious. The patty itself was cooked perfectly and quite juicy. I moved through it though and the ingredients just didnt seem to blend quite well in my mouth. At the end there was a slight sour taste that I wasn't quite happy with. The sweet potato fries were pretty good and it was interesting that they put cinnamon and brown sugar on it. It wasn't any thing spectacular. Overall I feel the place was a little over hyped and my expectations were set quite high. It was a good burger but just not worth the hype that everything made it out to be. Perhaps I will return to try their other offerings but for now my review stands 3 stars. Oh and I do not really crave the umami burger. Sorry.

I came here on a Sunday in the afternoon, and it was packed. The parking lot was awfully crowded. We waited for 45 minutes for a table for 2. Anyway, we were already there and we wanted to give it a try. I had their ahi tuna burger and my boyfriend had their umami burger. They came out in very small portions, and fries were not even included :(. My burger was relatively healthy, but my boyfriend's burger was really greasy and soggy - overall, both were really small. The service was friendly, you just have to be patient when there's that many people in such a crowded space. Anyway, for the price, there are better burger joints out there. But, definitely is worth a try.

OK So here's the sad but true story folks, I have to tell it like it is or I wouldn't be an honest reviewer like I promised I am in my profile. The burgers are OUT OF SIGHT! Unreasonably good! I mean, you shouldn't be allowed to just publicly order a burger this good for no reason whatsoever practically whenever you want, it's just morally unconscionable. OK. So the burgers, don't tell me you're a vegetarian and if you are I hope you are good at faking pleasant, agreeable smiles. I always order my burgers as blue (aka to novices = bloody) as possible. One pitfall with ordering blue here is that the meat is already so tender, so marinated and so loaded with other equally insanely tasty ingredients, that you end up with a creation that is now so goopy it's practically an Umami  Burger Bowl*. But oh my, what an "umami bowl" it is, if that's the mistake I made!  (*I don't think there is such a thing) So Lesli, you ask, waddup with only 3 stars then. Because I come from a civil place where people are nice to each other. I'm not going to waste my good mood this afternoon on negativity, but people, why, oh why, the snooty, snotty, attitude? The customer service really lacked the night we were there, and it was all coming from the attitude department. It tainted my memory of the place strongly enough that I have not returned since that first visit. Too bad, Owner People -- there would have been dozens since that first visit already. But I vote with my dollar; and rudeness, attitude and meanness to innocent, enthusiastic and paying customers do not fit in my world and I therefore do not contribute to it. (What is the concept for that anyway, does it help command the high prices you are getting for burgers in the armpit that has become Hollywood?) Well let's all cross our fingers that the Umami team read A Christmas Carol last month and their entire staff is now miraculously transformed into loving, genuinely caring people and we can all go back and get our mega-fixes on now. Good luck and love, all.

Tasty, brothy, meaty, savory (thanks, Wikipedia)--everything "umami" is, these burgers are. At Umami, you might find the best burger you have ever had, in LA at least.  I had the self-titled Umami Burger, which included a giant slice of shitaki mushroom.  There was just the right about of juice, height, and diversity in each bite.  For dessert, the ice cream sandwiches were equally well crafted (although delivered from another LA joint). The restaurant is small, but the waiters attentive.  Like us, you might have to wait a bit for seating and wait some more for your order to arrive.  Your burger, however, will be beaming with lotsa original TLC from the grill! Skip In-n-Out for a night and try this.

Heard good things about the burgers, so we went today for lunch. Hmmm...OK...the burger was good (we got the umami burger)...but the service stank.  Not that it was unfriendly, but just flaky and disorganized. It took them twenty minutes to realize they'd lost our order, and only because we were about the only occupied table there...our waiter was pretty nice about it, giving us a free order of pickles and dessert (the desserts are from Monkey Bakery and Milk [which is a better response than at Baby Blues BBQ in Hollywood, which served us rock hard cornbread and then said, "That's unusual" when we complained]). So...the restaurant is called Umami, and umami means that savory flavor you get from things like Parmesan and miso, but I wasn't getting much umami from the food. Pretty much everything we tasted, from the burgers to the onion rings to the homemade ketchup lacked depth of flavor and could have really used more salt (and I don't even like salty things). And I thought the portions were pretty small for the price. Burgers begin at $9 and the pickle platter was $4...for that you get a chi chi platter of about half a dozen tiny batons of carrots, two okras, four slices of cucumber pickles and a spoonful of relish.   The best thing about the burger? The buns, which are tops! I love onion rings, so I was pretty happy to see it on the menu, especially since it was beer battered.  But while the beer flavor really came through, it needed more salt and was greasy. They also gave us about three tablespoons of ketchup. Come on.  If you want to scrimp on the homemade ketchup, just serve up a bottle of Heinz! Which leads me to wonder about the restaurant itself. I guess they're going for the gourmet thing, with the chi chi look and the decor (the room reminded me of a hotel lobby, you know, the kind of hotel that wants to look like it spent bucks but didn't really), but how about focusing on the basics like service, cooking and getting the seasonings better balanced? Greasy onion rings means the cooks don't understand how to deep-fry (it's all about the correct temp of the oil). And on the topic of the basics, the menu could be revamped. Like the description for the Umami Burger just says it's their specialty. That's it.  No mention that it's topped with mushrooms and fried parmesan, etc. What's with that? Especially because they describe the other burgers in detail. Anyway, we both got indigestion after the meal, so next time, we'll probably go to the new Counter that opened up in Studio City. Or go to Lucky Devils.

* Caveat: this review is about service - not really about food * I had five people visiting from Europe, and thought it would be fun to take them to Umami. My wife arrived before us, and took position in the waiting list. We then all waited a bit, and started to see people going in before us, who had arrived after us. While inquiring why they had dispatched people the way they did (as they had seated people in a way that would not allow us to be seated in a close future), they said it was a mistake from the Chef (who should then stay in his kitchen), but that they would not move four people for us. No apologies, they only suggested we could order to go. Thumbs up - they compete with Burger King. If they can't be bothered taking reservation, they should be smart handling people on the fly. Not the case. When your food is good but not exceptional, I don't think you can afford this attitude. They will either have to change once they are not infatuated by the induced novelty effect, or just become a has-been place. Go to Golden State! :-) http://www.yelp.com/biz/…

I saw this place on "The Best Thing I Ever Ate" as a hometown favorite. This place is definitely LA. My wife and I walked here for dinner one Friday night. There were a ton of people there and it was a 20 minute wait for two people to sit outside. The valet parking was patroned by Hondas and Jags. All very LA. Once we were finally seated we shared the beet salad, umami burger, and the port and stilton burger. The food was okay. But pricey. Also very LA. In the end, I would go back only if accompanied by someone who really wanted to check it out. But for me, I can think of much better burgers I can get for $11.

I'm an absolute burger fanatic. Like no joke, my burger standards living in LA are so high now I don't even eat In N Out anymore unless it's with friends who drag me there. I heard great things about Umami Burger from a friend who went there a while back, and after listening to him rave about the Triple Pork Burger, I knew I had to come try it out. I was absolutely STUNNED how amazing the TPB was. Tender, juicy, flavorful, and well-spiced... and paired along with the soft supple bun... everything was top notch. Pair your burger with some legit mexican cane sugar Coke and an order of onion rings and THICK french fries, and you're good to go! Since then, I have also tried the Umami Burger, which was also delectable, but I'll definitely be back more often to try every single burger. Service is excellent and attentive, and parking (valet) is scarce, so you may have to try street parking. The wait time for my party of three was always around 15 minutes, so not a very long wait at all.

I heard so much good things about this place but I was a bit disappointed. I was really hoping to like this place... The burgers were just OK, I liked my So Cal Burger more than my fiancee's Umami Burger, the concept was unique but it just lacked flavor. The thick cut fries weren't crispy, a little on the raw side and the onion rings everyone raved about was really oily and soggy. Their version of ketchup was a bit runny, not much flavor. It was almost like canned crushed tomatoes? Maybe we needed to try the other dipping sauces. I'm glad I finally checked it out but I guess it just wasn't what my taste buds like. The staff was very nice and attentive. Valet parking for $2.50 available but we found plenty of street parking around.

Okay maybe I'm being a bit hard on Umami Burger because I saw Giada go ga-ga over it on The best Thing I ever Ate. I'd just mastered Parmesan tuille (which tops the signature burger along with Heirloom tomatoes, caramelized onions and house made ketchup) I ordered it to go for my BF who LOVES LOVES LOVES burgers, and asked me to go pick him up one. I got a few brownie points with him since we talk about wanting to try that burger a couple times EVERY week when we drive past the one in Mid City. He made a point to praise me for thoughtfulness... but.... He wouldn't eat it. I ate it - with the help of my doggie - just not to waste the 14 yes - FOURTEEN - dollars I'd spent on an Umami Burger and an order of fries (Which tasted like good MacDonald's' fries to me) The Parmesan Tuille gets lost among the overly-sweet sauce and the too-thick slices of tomato. The burger waaaay tooo rare for my liking (I'd asked for medium and got warm tar-tar) and had no seasoning on it. No salt, no pepper, nothin. I WANT to like this place. Nice concept. Beautiful, but friendly and not haughty staff, quality ingredients, and they even think green - packing my order in paper only. Somehow that little folded paper packet kept the fries warm AND crisp on the drive home. Unlike other readers,  I did not find this burger too small.  it is like a 1/3 lb hand-shaped patty on a good dense-but-not-doughey roll. I just did not enjoy this burger. My dog did ;)

First I want to start off by saying I screamed at my MacBook monitor when I saw that someone could be speaking ill of the the best burger that my mouth has ever tasted. I mean... How could you feed this beautiful yet delicious creation to your dog? That's nonsense! These people are being absolutely cantankerous and ridiculous! Now let my review begin.... This time I had the truffle burger. I did request that it was medium. I usually eat my burgers medium-well but I was feeling very adventurous on this day. The burger came out and it was a little pink. I got a little bit of anxiety. I told myself to shut up and I ate it. I am SO GLAD I made myself eat it. It was the most amazing thing I have ever tasted. I mean I could eat another one right now even though I'm full. My full order was: 1 truffle burger 1 umami burger for my friend 1 order of hand cut fries (that do NOT taste like Mc Donald's fries) 1 lemonade 1 vanilla bean Milk Ice cream sandwich The bill was 35 dollars which was completely reasonable in my eyes. I crave these burgers non stop. If you haven't been to umami burger and you live in LA... Shame on you! What are you waiting for? GET YOUR ASS UP AND GO!! NOW!!!! You won't regret it. Truffle burger I want to have your baby.

The only downside about this place is that the burgers are a little small which meant that I ended up getting two once when I was starving. Luckily I did because I got to try the Triple Pork ($11) which is now by far my favorite. Not only is it their largest burger but it's the juiciest and an explosion of flavor. I can't wait to try the Hatch burger next time with the green chili!

I understand the concept they're trying to present. Small, hip & trendy fashionable burger joint. You see it in the dishware, the white paper table covering and of course the prices. Would I normally pay $10 for a burger? And a small one at that? No. But chalk this one up to curiosity. Don't get me wrong, the meat was tasty. It was moist and tender. But too fatty for my tastes. I ordered the SoCal which had lettuce, tomato and cheese. It had the right amount of melted cheese but only one dinky piece of lettuce. I also had their sweet potato fries. Those were good. I believe they make their own ketchup. But when you factor in parking (if you valet) that's close to $20 for a burger lunch which is not my idea of a fun time. Maybe I'm not sophisticated enough or I'm just simply low-brow but I'll take an Island's burger or In-N-Out anyday over this anyday.

Whenever I meet someone who doesn't like Umami - I worry about their taste in general.  Yes, the burgers are very flavorful and savory so you can't eat more than one...but why would you? The burgers are to die for - the hatch, truffle and umami are my favorites.  It's the perfect kind of burger to treat yourself to every month or so and it never fails to hit the spot!  Speaking of...I'm due for a trip back. Love the Umami burger!!

I wanted to check out what all the hype was about after seeing this place on a bunch of Top 10 Burger lists.  Went on a Sunday afternoon around 12 PM, no problem finding street parking and no waiting for a table, but we were seated in the outdoor patio area. My bf  and I split the Umami Burger, SoCal Burger and sweet potato fries. The Umami was definitely cooked to juicy perfection and had a more complex taste than your average burger, but that taste reminded me of a sweet pepperoni pizza. It was good, but didn't knock my socks off. The SoCal Burger was quite bland and nothing about it really stood out. On the plus side, the ingredients tasted very fresh and I liked the consistency of the beef. I feel like it's hard to go wrong with sweet potato fries, but the brown sugar sprinkled on top was a bit of a turn off. I wish they had used less, it was sugar overkill, especially while eating them with the accompanying ketchup and/or Umami Burger. I'd recommend switching out the ketchup for a more savory dipping sauce. Our meal + an iced green tea + friendly service came to almost $40. I'm not really sure where they can justify charging $10+ for a lone burger. I hope the beef is made with 100% certified organic, grass fed, free range, golden egg laying cows for that price. Glad I tried this place at least once, but for now, Father's Office is still my favorite fancy burger joint.

I love Umami Burger! I'd never been to this location and it didn't really stack up to the Santa Monica location in comparison. We came around mid-day (430?) and had a party of 8. This location is really small and the manager seemed really flustered about our semi-large party. After at least 30 minutes of deliberating and coming back and forth with options for us, they seated us in the "Alcove", a side room which has bar seating facing 3 walls and a table in the middle. A mother-daughter was already eating at the center table and I felt like we probably disturbed their meal with our large party. The seating was also very awkward because we didn't face each other so we were all turned around in our chairs just to make conversation. Onto the food: I was really excited when I saw the lamb burger listed among the specials. The Lamb Burger at the Santa Monica location was one of the best burgers I've ever had: juicy lamb, goat cheese, arugula, and a spicy-sweet aioli of some kind. The Lamb Burger i was served here was a MAJOR let down. It was just lamb with some onions on it, not much else. The lamb was tender and tasty but overall it was really underwhelming and I wish I had ordered something else. Our sides came out very quickly, and the smushed potatoes were great as usual. In addition, the waitress brought out a tray with each of the sauces on them for those that ordered fries: at the other location they charge you per sauce, these were free! Overall it was good, as it always is, but it definitely doesn't compare to the Santa Monica location.

Tried the famous Umami Burger for the first time while waiting for my car to get washed and figured I could come in and get an emulsion burger to go really quickly. This day they had a gigantic catering order and it took them 50 minutes to make the burger that I had ordered. While the food was absolutely delicious the wait was unbearable and the tensions where high. When I went in for my food I was told to back off and that the order wasn't mine. A semi pleasant experience will probably have me stopping back but with hesitation. The next burger should be a golden flaked one. Service 1 star food 5 stars = 3 stars (thats fair).

I came here with my friends back in June. I got the Triple Pork burger and we split a side of warm, crunchy tater tots which was one of the specials for the day. By our luck, it happened to be that our table claimed the last available order of tater tots (I'm not sure if it was for the rest of the lunch period or what?). The table next to us was definitely doing a good deal of staring at our crunchy balls of potato. I felt bad. Kind of. Not really. Everything was deee-licious and I'd most likely come back here to try out their other burgers, but it's more expensive than I'd like to pay at a burger joint. Also, who charges extra for condiments? I mean, sure it's "only" $.50 and they may make it themselves, but I didn't even think their Umami Ketchup was all that great. I'd personally rather have my classic "bottle-of-ketchup-on-the-table" than this upscale-ish "tablespoon-of-house-ketchup-in-a-dish". But I tend to consume more ketchup than the average foodie, so maybe my take on ketchup availability is worth a grain of salt. There's valet and street parking (if you're lucky). The place itself is a little small so the possibility of a wait is likely. The service was pretty decent and friendly. I'd probably come back here again out of curiosity for the rest of the burgers and their sweet potato fries. I'm a sucker for sweet potato fries. I kick myself every time I remember that I didn't order them the first time. Sweet potato fries, we will meet soon. (soon = the next time I come back home from college) P.S. You want a classic burger joint? Try Bartley's Burger Cottage in Cambridge, MA. 'Nuff said.

Honestly for a burger place this place is a hit. It is not an exotic burger joint, backyard burger nor is it really an infused burger. At $11 average for a burger its not a fast food priced burger such as in-and-out but it isn't expensive as a exotic burger place such as father's office. Umami burger fit right between and I am a fan of this place. I ordered the umami signature burger and I would recommend this because it had multiple layers that worked together real well. The truffle burger was boring and it lacked texture when compared to but it was still really good. The tempura onion rings are AMAZING! The shoe string fries are mediocre. It comes with a horseradish and ketchup sauce, but as for the extra sauces because they are way better! The aoili and infused ranch! Parking can stink but valet is $2.50.

$2 valet in a tiny lot. $9 umami burger - this was good. Although it tasted like something from a Jollibee (Filipino fast food chain). $11 truffle cheese burger - where was the truffle cheese?  All I saw and tasted was oil... maybe it was truffle oil, but I couldn't tell. $4 fries - 8 lonely fries in a nice bowl.  The ketchup that came with the ketchup is slightly sweet and tangy.   I would say overall the food was ok but definitely overpriced.

These burgers are no joke. That being said, most of the staff needs a crotch punch.  I've never seen so much attitude from guys who ... flip burgers. Umami's figured out that the smaller the burger the better.  One, it tastes better, and Two, people are getting too damn fat, so let's do what we can. The fries suck, they try too hard here.  I'd recommend the 'market' salad, but I swear they've made it 4 different ways for me, one time loaded up w/ sickening beets.   If you're looking for a great burger or just someone to fight, I definitely recommend.

Really REALLY good burger! cool restaurant, good environment, and cool attentive staff.   I really enjoyed the burger and the desserts.  The burger was very juicy and had great flavor.  It was a bit more done than I ordered but was good enough for me not to want to send it back.  The burger had a really nice char and cheese was perfectly melted.  The bun was really soft and seemed homemade.  The only thing I wasn't a fan of were the thick cut fries.  At about 3/4 of an inch...they're really thick.   I'll get the skinny fries next time. The onion rings were good though! This place is great and I look forward to going back!

This could easily become one of my favorite restaurants in Los Angeles. First, avoid the valet and park on 9th. Then, if you have a small party, sit at the bar and there will likely be no wait. As for the food, I couldn't resist the Manly Burger, along with their signature onion rings and a house-made rootbeer. Everything was divine. The burger had an incredibly unique and satisyfing combination of flavors, and while it was smaller than your average burger, I actaully liked that it about it. I was still completely full, and finishing it without over-stuffing gave me a great feeling of accomplishment. The onion rings simply must be ordered; they're unlike any you've had before. All in all, a great environment, reasonable prices, and delicious food. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a good burger.

The burgers are ok. Don't really understand the whole umami thing. Or I do, I just don't get it in the burger. The onion rings are good. Really not much to say. I wouldn't go here unless friends suggest it or Leonard W. makes me go. For 9 dollars or so a burger......ehh   Really wasn't that amazed. Although when I went I did see that one white actor in Walking Tall   (the movie where the Rock was a sheriff ex football guy) The white guy that was the owner of the big truck that got effed up and was in jail. That made it more worth it. That guy is a big boy, as in fit and buff, not fat. But ok back to umami burger... ehh Try it and see what you think. I didn't think much.

I'm not a meat-eater but I'm always up for a veggie burger.  If you're looking for a meat review, please skip me (but my friends thoroughly enjoyed their burgers).   As a vegetarian, I was sorely disappointed.  The burger fell apart on contact and was flavorless.  I've had infinitely better veggie burgers at Barney's.

"This IS a tasty Burger!" Those immortal, albeit borrowed, words justly describe the burgers here. These dripping ground beef creations are delicious, juicy, savory, and served up rare on a bun so cloudlike that it resembles a toasted King's Hawaiian roll. The Truffle Burger is an exquisite flavor explosion and an absolute must. It has no lettuce nor tomatoes nor onions to distract from the homemade truffle oil/cheese glaze. The Manly Burger, Pork Burger, and the classic Umami Burger also seem to be well-cherished favorites. I also recommend the smushed potatoes. These are creamy fried dutch taters with just enough sea salt/pepper spice blend. I'd get these over their fries anytime, which is not to criticize their fries but rather an observation that a superior burger should also deserve a superior potato sidekick. -The Beef Baron

Yes, the small pricey gourmet burgers are flavorful - but the real reason to go is dessert!  I give the dessert portion of my meal 5 stars.  The ice cream sandwiches by MILK are amazing. The ice cream is sandwiched in between two giant french macarons...heaven!   Oh wait, who am I writing about again?  Oh yes..Umami Burger.  Parking is not the best, they have a very small lot that is manned by a valet...other than that I think you have to park on the street...so points subtracted for that.  Service was pretty slow, and since we managed to beat the rush and be the 1st customers there...points subtracted again.  The Umami burger itself is delicious and would give it 3.5 stars. Ok, so my mind keeps going back to those ice cream sandwiches...I guess I should just head to MILK on Beverly!  Here is a link to their site: http://www.themilkshop.c…

Umami has been my favourite gourmet burger by far, but the La Brea location is probably my fave L.A. Umami spot (Santa Monica is #1 for me). The servers here are great, and I like the decor at this one for some reason. Oh, and it's the one where you can draw on the tables! and they sometimes feature your artwork on the 'wall of Umami drawings' at the front. Yes, I'm a child at heart :D Parking is a total bummer near most of the Umami spots (except for Santa Monica), but this La Brea spot has a convenient $2 valet right in front. My last visit to Umami was at this location with a friend, and I tried the Turkey burger and by George, it has now become my favourite Umami burger. I like that you can get some Dr. Pepper and other soda pop drinks in bottles, and Cheese Tots are always a bonus if you can get 'em.

I'll keep this short and sweet. I enjoyed the food. Great flavor. The only drawbacks are that the burgers and the portions of the sides are small, especially for the price. I enjoyed the food, but I didn't feel complete when it was all over. I'd go again, but not of my own volition...

"Uh want to try a delicious yet tiny&expensive burger?" "uhhh sure....  as long as their meat don't smell..." So Umami as soon as I arrive there's a line and valet ($2.50) for parking.  You better be worth it.  Tables are small, interior is clean and nice, one bathroom, once again it's clean, simple, chic.  Now gimme a menu so I can look, see, &eat! -Mexican Coke $3 yum.  my favey.  chug a lug. -Umami Burger $10: fresh patty, non stinky meat (stinky meat freaks me out a lot...), u could tell the quality of meat and the care by looking at the core of the patty once you've bitten into it, a slice of roasted tomato, a portobello mushroom, umami ketchup, toasted bun.  One bite- melttttttt in your mouth good, crispy cheeez! -Sweet potato fries $3 or 4 crissssspy, sweet, with a spoon of umami ketchup NOM NOM NOM! -Manly Burger ~$12?  Bacon chunks- deliciossoooo -Tempura Onion rings $3-4 about 8 pieces or so.  Onion is juicy, tempura coating is crisp, jalepeno ranch greatttt. Service- mediocre.  They're busy and not too many servers.  There was like 4 servers for the whole joint. Not gonna lie, the hype is not just a hype.  Quality, atmosphere, taste.  Yum yum yum...  Next time I'm off to try their truffle burger!

It's a decent place for what it is. Ok tasting and quality meat for the burger but nothing really too exciting. But for $10-$12 for a burger, it's something not too spectacular. The sides are extra for $3-$7. Add everything up with a drink and tip the bill can be a staggering $20 plus over for one person. For two people that's more than $40 over, it certainly is not worth it. It's nothing too impressive. I have to say it taste more like a $7 burger, not a $12 burger. Plus they charge extra for condiments that's just not cool. They could do better than that, seriously, it's over priced burgers. They are charging Langer's prices for something at Apple Pan level. There are so much better place to eat in LA that are better proportion, tastier and not charge for condiments.

My boyfriend and I found out about this place form the Los Angeles Magazine, it was listed amongst the best cheap eats in LA so we gave it a shot...and we were not disapointed at all, in fact we were very pleased with it. The place was kinda small but it doesn't really matter since the turnaround is pretty quick so the wait is not so bad. I ordered the Port and stilton Burger and my bf got the Umami Burger, both of them were so delicious. The quality of the meat was great and it was nice and juicy, the bun (which is an important part of the burger) was perfect... Also they had Mexican Coke in a bottle...Yummyyy!! We would definitely go back...!!

This is an amended review. What I originally wrote is below. Although the original Umami's were exceptional the quality has gone a little downhill with so many being opened and with the owner not on premise very often with other business concerns. Still a great burger but far more inconsistent than it used to be. New Ratings: Burgers - 7 Onion Rings - 8 Fries - 6 Pickles - 6 Deserts - 7 Service - 7 Original Review: This is a damn good burger. Hands down has to be included on any list of L.A. greats. Whether you are a fan of Father's Office or Fatburger or anywhere in between you must at least try any of the burgers at Umami. For some reason the staff are nowhere near as sharp as they could be although the owner has a presence and checks in on tables often which is cool. Burgers - 10 Onion Rings - 10 Fries - 5 Pickles - 8 Deserts - 8 Service - 6

OK, I'm giving these guys a hopeful 2 stars with an opportunity for a revision, but fellas... you need to get your S*it together.   To quote Eames "The details aren't details. They are everything" First off, why does my date get a nice glass, and I get a crappy plastic cup?  Plastic is an environmental problem.  Use it when you have to.  Why does she arbitrarily get water and I don't? Moving on.  How about giving us menus within 15 minutes? They don't ask how you would like it cooked.  I eat steak tartare regularly.  I'm a fan of a proper medium rare in a burger.  This was cooked blue, (which is Illegal in places like Canada & England).   It was messy and nauseating, and my bun was literally blood soaked.  I politely sent it back asked for a for a medium rare.  I'm not big on waste, but if it were my restaurant and a customer sent back a mayo covered burger, I would make them a new one.   They re grilled mine and cooked it til it was a little black rock this time.  Oddly, the flavor was good, which may or may not bring me back.  BTW, the three guys next to us were murmuring "Is yours raw? Yeah, mine too". They were polite kids and ate their food, but clearly were underwhelmed. 2 burgers. 2 sodas, split order of onion rings.   $30.00.   OK, I'm not going back.   Too many restaurants breaking their backs to stay alive.

Checklist minus one! Another one bites the dust. I finally came here after wanting to go eat here for over a year. And friend and I had just came back from the Fairfax HS flea market and I was STARVING. I was about to pass it by trying to think of a place to breeze through that wasn't a Micky D's. I abruptly turned onto the street for parking and asked my friend if she was hungry. SCORE!! So she ordered the Triple Pork burger and I got the Truffle burger. We both plan to go back to try the original Umami, but that's for next time. I liked my burger, it came out like I sometimes like my burgers, with nothing on it but the meat and cheese, so what if I'm a minimalist. She seemed to really like her's too, although I didn't try it. The sweet potato fries were decent, a little too crispy and smallish, and not quite salty enough for me. At the end, I was stuffed, I don't think it needs to be any bigger in size, but my bun did start to get soggy on the side when I was almost done. Probably because my juicy burger was spilling all over the place! I want to come back and try a couple of the other burgers, and see what's really up. But from what I had, it's really good.

I've been to this place once before (about a year ago) and loved it. After this visit, I will not return. We were sat immediately, which was great. Both of our burgers were undercooked. They were both rare although we ordered medium rare and medium. Both of our burgers were lacking the tomatos and onions that are supposed to be on them. When I asked the server, she checked with the kitchen who informed her that they had run out of tomatos (really?) and forgot the onions (double-really?) She offered to have the stuff added or have them re-made. When I requested a remake, she said, "Well, it's kinda hard since its-half eaten." I had taken 3 bites but since the burgers are so small, it did look half-eaten. Regardless, it was a faux paus on her part and in her defense, she spent the rest of the time trying to make up for it. I passed but my date did not. Her 2nd burger was equally under-cooked but she gave up and ate it. The sweet potato fries were old. Bottled sodas cost $3. I've recently eaten at The Counter on both La Brea and on Sunset. The Counter BLOWS AWAY Umami - bigger burgers, sweet potato fries that melt in your mouth, tons of choices... I won't be back to Umami but am a fan of The Counter.

I loved the burgers. The burgers seem small, however they the meat patties are very thick. You even get to choose how cooked you want your burgers to be. I highly recommend the Manly burger ($10) and the Unami ($10) burger. Out of the appetizers, we ordered the sweet potato fries and the cheesy fries. I recommend the cheesy fries. I absolutely loved the decor of the restaurant. Highly recommend this place.

The restaurant is larger than it appears. As are the burgers! Aside from that fact that I got unexpectedly full, I was extremely unimpressed with Umami burger. The port & stilton burger had flavors that were so strong that I couldn't enjoy the meat of the burger. The Umami burger was better, but still nothing worth drooling over. The special Umami ketchup made it pleasantly sweet. The sweet potato fries were average. The tempura onion rings were the best part of the meal! Dip the onion rings in a bit of roasted garlic aioli mixed with their special ketchup...yum! They gave us too much ketchup. I ate/drank the rest by itself it's that good! And I'm not usually a ketchup fan! Theirs is sweet with a more tomatoey consistency. I can honestly say the ketchup is the only thing I crave from Umami Burger. Don't order to-go. Waited for more than half an hour for our food. And by the time we got it, it clearly wasn't fresh; the burger bun was much soggier than it should have been and so were the sweet potato fries. Also, please don't park valet. There's free street parking right on 9th maybe 20 steps away.

I don't mind paying that but I want to b wowed and unfortunately we were not ...my mother wanted to try it soooo bad. With 3 star over all rating I kinda knew I wasn't gonna b wowed.

Heard so many great things about this place, so I had to give it a try. Went on a Wednesday night and had to valet park the car (only option).  Place is pretty small, but we got one of the last tables right away.  They've got these little notepad computers that you can use to look at the menu and apparently also order and pay.  I hear these things are getting more popular, but it's the first time I've encountered them.  With a room that small, though, it seems kind of ridiculous.  At any rate, in a few minutes a server came with paper menus and for the rest of the evening was very attentive, helpful and friendly. I got the signature Umami Burger, which came with shiitake mushroom, caramelized onions, roasted tomato, parmesan crisp, and "umami ketchup."  The lady got the Green Bird, which was a turkey burger with avocado, green cheese, butter lettuce, sprouts, and green goddess dressing. To accompany our burgers, we got the Smushed Potatoes and the onion rings.  The rings were great - a crisp tempura batter on the outside, with firmly textured onions on the inside.  The potatoes were a nice surprise - twice-fried little potatoes seasoned well so they were savory, but retaining a good potato flavor. Her burger had a good taste and wasn't dry like turkey patties can get.  However, she got jealous when she had a bite of mine.  The Umami Burger was very flavorful and very juicy, but although it left her with what she called "burger envy," I was disappointed.  Although it tasted good, the umami ketchup mostly overpowered everything else, especially the beef.  The patty was cooked a perfect medium rare - when I cut it in half, it was a beautiful brown on the outside, red on the inside.  Unfortunately, I just couldn't taste any of it.  So while the Umami Burger was a tasty sandwich, it just wasn't a good burger. If I go back, I'll either try one of their other burgers, or just ask them to leave the ketchup off.

I had the truffle burger. It was delicious, juicy, mouth-watering good. The server was good. She was very accommodating with my late party arrivals. The place isn't very big so expect it to be a bit crowded during busy hours. The burgers are small, but imo, it's a good size. American portions are rather too large for me usually. There won't be any leftovers, but every bite you get is a quality one. This was my first time and it had been hyped up so much by friends and online reviews, yet I wasn't disappointed. Next time I go to L.A. I'd visit again.

Way overpriced. I kept hearing of the place and maybe I had too high of expectations because I was really disappointed. The burger was good but it was not incredible or anything spectacular. Their beet salad was a mix of different salads that were good separated but not mixed together. Quality of the food overall was OK. The personal was nice, their shirts were cute but the place was loud and the music were just blah... Thankfully we didn't have to wait in line! Definitely a no go for me.

I loved Umami! I brought my coworker and he loved Umami too! I was torn between their Thai Curry Shrimp burger and their traditional Earth Burger.  I wanted to have a true Umami experience so I went with the Earth Burger.  Good Choice! The blend of the mushroom patty and the ricotta cheese was superb.   Danny ordered a regular burger (the one with the butter lettuce).  He really enjoyed it and said it was super juicy.  We also shared fries that were terrific.  The ketchup is a bit different and we both liked it a lot. Their buns are delish too!  I would definitely go back, especially to try the seared Ahi burger.  Good Service too!

Umami, ay papi!  I can't even count the number of people who told me about Umami and said I was crazy for not trying it. A friend of mine came into town and was told that SHE HAD to try Umami before she left Los Angeles.  So we headed over to Umami burger, hoping to have burger bliss! We were so hungry that we ordered the pickle plate hoping it would hold us over before our burgers came.  They were all very tasty and pickle-y.  Our waitress seemed to be completely and utterly overwhelmed.  She was getting everything mixed up and was running around our outside seating section like a crazy woman.  I felt kinda bad for her. Anywho, I ordered the Umami burger, I figured that it would be amazing since it's their signature burger.  I have to say that I was underwhelmed.  The flavors are okay, but my burger was kind of soggy and a mess.  I honestly would have preferred an In-N-Out burger instead. The fries were yummy with the garlic aioli.  One friend ordered the SoCal Burger and the other got the Truffle Burger.  Everyone agreed that the burgers were tasty, but not AMAZING. I think Umami might be like Pink's hot dogs in the sense that it's a tourist-y place people should try, but I don't think it's all that special.  No thanks papi. OH!  If you want to get your car washed at the place next door, you can also leave your car at the wash until you're done eating.  Otherwise they have valet parking, or you can try for street or metered spots.

Decided to check this place to see what the hype was about. We waited for 20+ minutes to be seated, which was unusual because the seats we eventually sat in were opened the whole time. They have a unique way of sitting people, but seems to us they were just being lazy. We both had the umami burgers which at first didnt taste that bad. After halfway the meat began to fall apart and the burger were soaked. The onions rings and fries we EXTREMELY bland. Overall Id rather go somewhere else to grab a $9+ burger and bland poor tasting fries. Not really anticipating to go back again.

Tiny lil burgers, but they are pretty good and filling. Our waiter seem stoned, but that's O.K.  Our busser/waiter sucked though, typical pompous LA attitude. The condiments are served with spoons. ketchup is ragu sauce, they need to get real ketchup. They ran out of soda and sweet potato fries while we were there. The place is really cramped, so don't expect any elbow room. I got the manly burger, it was good. Seems like this just built this place real fast, tried to make it all cute and zen.

I went to Umami burger for the first time today and was really excited but ended up underwhelmed.  The only thing that kept it from getting 1 star is the burger was pretty good...when it eventually came. It took almost an hour after we ordered for 2 burgers and onion rings to come out, with no apology for the wait and one attempt to refill our empty drinks.  They didn't seem understaffed and the place really isn't that big.  The burger was good, but I finished it in about 4 bites and spent the rest of the time wondering why I was giving these people $35. There are lots of places to get a great burger in LA for 1/2 the price and 1/6th of the wait, so I won't be returning.

Delicious food, and our waiter was extremely courteous; however, some of the policies seem a little problematic. For one, large groups are not allowed to divide the bill, and only two credit cards are allowed; therefore, we ended up having to make emergency B of A ATM runs. Secondly, the waiter informed us that he himself would have to purchase any accidental customer purchases, which, frankly, seems a bit like unethical business practices for this progressive. I know these guys are in expansion mode, but I can get my gourmet burger fix elsewhere.

Yes, yes, like everyone said valet parking is $2.50 which is a total ripoff, and the customer service is not that great... but the main thing I don't understand is why everybody says umami burgers are the best. Everything I ever order here is too sweet for my taste. Even the fries come with some kind of sweet ketchup. I've tried the umami burger twice - although it looks really cute (like a krabby patty), the portion of the burger is tiny for what you pay for! ($10-14ish) The bun in my opinion is what sets this burger apart from many others because of it's sweetness. I wish they could add a burger salad to the menu. Last time I tried the special, a truffle burger without the bun on top of a bed of fries. It was pretty good, but I felt sick towards the end because of the sweetness of the meat! I don't mind coming here because I know a lot of people who really like this place, but I would never choose to come here by myself. Another thing about this restaurant - you have to pay $2 if you want to play one of their little games on their tablets. I'm sorry, but with the abundance of smartphones in this generation, nobody should be willing to pay that.

There has been so much buzz about this place, including having the best burgers, so I was looking forward to trying it.  The burgers were perfectly cooked.  I'm not crazy about rare meat, but it had to be cooked medium rare to retain its juiciness -- and that's pretty much the only way they'll cook it.  We had the big man and chile & cheese burgers, onion rings, sweet potato fries and salad.   I have to say, I now know that I am not a fan of the much-raved umami taste.  As they say, it's kind of earthy.  But it was pretty strong and overwhelming and permeated everything, which kind of made everything taste the same.  I think the problem was that they make their own "umami ketchup," (which doesn't take at all like ketchup) so if it's in your burger and you eat it with the onion ring or fries, it all tastes the same.  Even the salad tasted the same.  The chile & cheese burger was really good -- probably because there was no evidence of the umami flavor.   Umami?  Um no yummy.  I'll pass...

This place is fantastic. First off, the portions are perfect and I do mean perfect. You will finish everything on your plate and feel full but not too full. Know what I mean? Second, the meat is so tender and tasty it'll just melt in your mouth. Last but not least, the onion rings are quite possibly the tastiest I have ever encountered. The restaurant is tiny but nice, so call up your favorite person and go now! Oh and for those of you wondering what umami means, it's one of the five tastes. It comes from japanese and means  savory - as in sweet, salty, bitter, sour and umami.

I was early meeting a friend here -- arrived at 6:40 to meet at 7 -- and the host asked me to "wait outside."  To be honest, I almost left after this it felt so rude.  It's admittedly a small space they have, but there were maybe 20% of their tables seated at most.   Friend arrived a few minutes early and we were seated immediately.  Service was fine after that.  The Umami Burger was excellent, as were the onion rings.  Portion size (as other reviewers have mentioned) was smallish, but I kind of don't mind that. It did feel like they are suffering from the "we're hot right now so we don't need to be nice to be busy" disease.  Not awful, but just didn't feel like they needed to try that hard either.  There should be a name for that... Overall though I will give it another try, maybe it was just a bad day. UPDATE:  Visited again, service was even worse, smarmy and terse.  Sorry for the accidental rhyme.  Twice in a row poor service is not acceptable.  Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. I'm downgrading my star rating, as I not only can't recommend this place I would recommend finding an alternative.   Whoever owns or manages this place should take heed that this is not just my independent experience, I am hearing these reports form others and it's eventually going to outweigh the buzz about your interesting burgers, I'm sorry to say.

Street parking is quite difficult during popular meal times, buttttt... I will definitely come back here again! I might visit the other Umami restaurants just to check out the different vibes and explore more of Los Angeles. My friend and I debated between the Original, Truffle (because we didn't know such a thing as truffle cheese existed and we were so used to hearing truffle chocolates), and The Manly Burger (purely for the cool name). We ended up ordering the Original Umami -- can't go wrong with the signature burger. For our side, we ordered the smushed fries! Our waiter, Raul, was incredibly nice! He presented our water cups and I was a little taken aback by the plastic and flexibility of the cups. The thumb ridge in the middle of the cup is a cool design though. This burger is the best gourmet burger I have ever tasted. The beef is tender and the bread reminds me of the sweet Hawaiian bread, my favorite. The smushed fries have the perfect hint of salt and pepper. They were layered in what seems to be garlic aoili sauce/flavoring. Whatever it was, I like it. Thanks for a positive experience, Umami Burger. See you next time!

It is very difficult to weigh the deliciousness of the burgers with the crowds, valet, rushed service, and difficulty of paying. Even though I don't like mushrooms, I decided to go all the way and get the full umami burger. It was indeed scrumptious. The aioli and other dips for the french fries are a little stingy but very tasty. As everyone will attest, it is very crowded and the wait time and accommodations are frustrating but the clientele is easy on the eyes, which makes everything seem better. It is a very LA place and is worth it if only as an experience for tourists and other outsiders. Frustrating but delicious and enjoyable burger find.

DELICIOUS!! I was VERY skeptical when I heard it was a fusion burger place but when I took that first bite.. ORGASM IN MY MOUTH, FORREAL. I ordered the MANLY burger, which in my opinion, BEATS the umami burger that my sister always gets. It's made with beer cheese and delicious bacon and fried onion rings! yums! Their french fries are SO amazing too! Both their regular AND sweet potato fries! I guarantee you'll INHALE your food!

Juicy, delicious morsel of food.  Socal burger and Umami burger are the best.  Tempurar Onion Rings and Fries are soft and fluffy.  The marinara ketchup has just the right amount of flavor to complement the fries.  Looks small initially, but is very filling. Stop complaning about the price.  It just means you don't make enough money.

A bit disappointed with the burgers here...I've always heard mixed reviews for this place - either you love it...or you don't. Flew down to LA for a quick weekend adventure and decided to pick up a few burgers and fries to share for a light dinner since we were going to be eating/drinking again in a few hours.  I was surprised the location was so tiny.  We ordered 4 burgers + 2 orders of fries to share between 5 people TO GO. Good news is that - there was enough, but on the other hand it might of been leftovers b/c it wasn't that great.  I will admit that it did sit in a 20 min car ride before we got to take our first bites.  So I would be willing to give it another try. However, when I think I would of still really enjoyed a 20 min old In-n-Out burger and it would not change my opinion about it. We got two Umami Burger (signature) , one Truffle Burger (house-made truffle cheese, truffle glaze) and one Port + Silton (blue cheese, port-caramelized onions).  Honestly, for a $10+ burger I was totally not impressed.  The only one that I somewhat enjoyed was the Truffle and that's b/c you can't go wrong w/ truffle oil.  Anything with truffle oil taste delish! And how come they don't ask how you want your meat cooked? our burgers were pretty rare inside.   Also got a side of thin fries and sweet potato fries. They have special sauces - we got the garlic aioli and the jalapeno ranch - once again nothing spectacular. Our above order cost about $55. I think I would rather go to In-N-out for 1/3 of the price and walk out a lot happier.  I do admit that my review can be updated if I go again and eat it there.  But if I'm going to pay over $10 for my burger, I rather go to Father's Office or the Counter so I can customize it to my liking.

Bad burger, bad bad burger.  Very simply when the ONLY thing you serve is hamburgers they better be good.  And when the ONLY thing you serve is burgers the service better be efficient.   Their signature burger is gross.  Very SWEET, sugary sweet.  It is also very soft- there is no texture to this thing at all. The service:  After 45 minutes from the time of ordering NO BURGERS TO BE SEEN.  I think that is a crazy wait for a lightly filled restaurant on a Wednesday night.  I asked for them to be packed "to go" after 35 minutes, and it took another 15 minutes still to see the food.  At that point the food should have been comp'd, but instead they gave me a free homemade dingdong.   Seriously, you F'd up my date, took $50 of my money, wasted an hour of my time, and remedy it with a kids snack!?  Maybe whenever you screw up you should offer tokens to the Vermont Arcade or complimentary tickets to  Twilight New Moon. To the owners of this establishment:  TRY HARDER.  YOU WILL NOT MAKE-IT ACTING UP LIKE THIS.  Ask your customers regularly what they think about things.  Have an anonymous comment box by the exit and truly encourage patrons to fill it out after every meal.  Fix your kitchen & service.  NO RESTAURANT COULD BE EASIER TO RUN THAN A BURGER JOINT.  Clean up your act and expect much better success in your business. And Im not the only one to have this story, Deion K., describes the EXACT same story, and the managers remedy... free ding-dongs!!

Veggie burger was good. Really filling though. It's not something I can eat on a regular basis. I felt like I gained 5 lbs after I finished the burger. My boyfriend had the Umami Burger and he said it was really greasy. Nothing compare to the Father's Office burger. A friend of mine also agreed. Father's Office's burger is by far the tastiest burger in LA.

i had high expectations for this place and i felt it ALMOST delivered.   the menu looks delicious, the menu system is digital and super cool, the games on it are lame as balls.   we ordered the onion rings and sweet potato fries.  while both good, it was the ketchup that really made me say wow, this is awesome.  it's sweet, but got a little tang to it.   for the burgers, my friend ordered the truffle poutine burger and i ordered the manly burger.  the manly burger was delicious, although the bacon pieces were a bit dry.  the truffle poutine, which i didn't tell my friend, but i felt was only medicore.  i mean the flavor was decent, but it just didn't feel like a burger without a bun.   i know it was supposed to be poutine so served on a serving of fries, but what happened to the cheese curds then?  also, i guess because of price, there wasn't any real truffles, just truffle sauce/oil?  overall, it just seemed like a lame attempt to add a gourmet/unique item to the menu.   but overall, it's decent.  i'd recommend it because it's pretty unique and the menu does read very tasty.  i'd try it again to get the other burgers.  only other thing though is the burger meat was average, so you meat connoisseurs out there, just avoid this place altogether.

The burgers are one of a kind here. I ordered the So cal burger and it was great, but what even more tasty were the sweet fries. The season them with cinnamon which gives them a unique taste. Customer service can improve a bit and the parking situation is a bit complicated but overall the food was great!

I got the Umami burger and fries. The triple-fried fries are strange- really really crispy and cut very large. I like them, but was sad I only got like 8. The burger is also a bit smaller then I'm used to. The bun was buttery and soft. The burger.....  I was expecting lettuce and tomatoes, I got a parmesan crisp, a shittake mushroom and roasted tomatoes. It tasted good (although the flavor lingered in my mouth for several hours after the meal), but it's not the type of burger I normally would crave. It was interesting, but not my kind of burger. It's definitely worth a try though! Onion rings were soooo greasy and there were like 5 to a order.

My boyfriend and I were feeling trendy this weekend, so we decided to head out and see what all the Umami Burger hoopla was about. Keeping in mind that hype tends to gravitate around otherwise very mediocre restaurants, we went to Umami Burger with managed expectations-- thereby avoiding devastating disappointment when the burgers failed to blow us away. Upon reflection: The burgers were delicious. Very juicy and actually cooked to order (you know how some restaurants tend to think that by rare, you mean medium). There was a diverse selection, which of course made me want to try everything. We settled on the Umami Burger and the Truffle Burger. Both were good burgers (the truffle more than the Umami) but not necessarily outstanding. There were a couple of key problems with them, such as: -the meat fell apart -the burgers were slightly on the greasy side -the two factors above made for one very soggy bun Umami must be the fifth taste in disguise, because I sure couldn't tell the difference between that and a regular burger. The truffle cheese was to die for, but I'm pretty sure you could throw truffle cheese on any burger and it would be good... it doesn't really prove you're a good burger joint. I like that they made their own Ketchup but admittedly, I prefer Heinz (gasp!). That aside, the sweet potato fries were amazing! I haven't read through the reviews, but Umami Burger may have some complaints about their portion sizes. The burgers are much smaller than normal restaurant or pub style. I actually like this, though. I found it oddly pleasing to leave Umami satisfied but not at all stuffed. Anyway, overall, Umami gets 3 stars for cooking up very good, but very average burgers. For something so simple to stand out, it's gotta be extraordinary, and Umami just wasn't that.

I have hear RAVE reviews for Umami Buger and I've been having a total craving for burgers so I was SOOOOO excited to try this place out... sadly, I can't say it was a 5 star, but it's definitely good and I am open to coming back to try the Truffle burger. I had the Field of Greens? (The Turkey Burger) and the green sauce is amazing.  I also tried the Umami Burger because I had to try their signature. I split 1/2 of each burger with a friend and found myself able to eat more even though we got a side of sweet potato fries, onion rings, tater tots, thick fries, and skinny fries for a table of 8. Pros: Burgers are neat and flavorful Cons: You can't add anything to any of the burgers. :( Burgers are small.  I'm one of those girls that always orders too much and can't finish it, but here at Umami, I was able to eat a whole burger and still hungry to eat more, not just because it was good but because I wasn't full :( Anyway, worth checking out at least once in your life.

Take a look thru the picture gallery and you won't need much explanation as to why this place deserves 5 stars.   But...because I like to talk (write) I'll just say say a few words here.  These burgers are crazy juicy.  How can you describe one of the best burgers you've ever had? I can't. Go. Go have some. Now.   And while you're there...get the fries, the tater tots, and onion rings.

If you're going to have the truffle burger, don't order the truffle beet salad to start with because its truffle dressing will overpower the burger's essence~   That being said... the truffle beet salad was surprisingly good!!!  It's odd to have a salty salad, but it worked well; didn't care for whatever the cheese was (ricotta maybe? i forget) but the truffle dressing, atop the argula and sliced almonds and beets... yum and yum! Umami burger - whoa? a very flavorful, juicy burger. Truffle burger - it was a good burger, but i think it was lacking in truffleness... it comes with truffled cheese and truffle glaze but the truffleness was not nearly as strong as it was in the truffle beet salad. Smushed/Smashed potatoes - mediocre.  Probably want to try the tater tots or sweet potato fries next time.   Can't wait to try more on the menu; probably going with the Hatch next.  Yay, I am a fan~! Oh, and I didn't bother with the $2.50 valet because there was plenty of street parking nearby.   20 minute wait for a party of 2 on a Sunday afternoon, at around 2pm. that's a lot of 2's :D

Burgers- Best patties Ive tasted! It has that fresh beef patty taste, not the typical frozen, greasy fried patty taste. The buns are to die for! Remind me of Portuguese sweet bread or Hawaiian bread with that hint of sweetness and fluffy texture. I got the normal Umami burger with no onions (didn't want the funky breath w/ my bf around). I also heard that getting the grilled onions almost made the burger too sweet and that it didn't fulfill that burger salty cravings bc it masked it too much. Burger Size - Be warned, you will be surprised with the small looking burger, but once you're 1/2 through eating it, you'll realize how rich and thick the patty is. It will fill up the average Joe. If you have a HUGE appetite, throw in a side order. Ambiance - very casual but definitely not a fast food place. A nice place to bring a friend when they're visiting LA and want to grab a quick lunch somewhere. Not that romantic if you're looking to bring someone on a date. Customer Service - Great service from the parking attendant to the waitress. They were close to closing but they decided to take us in.

The service and food here were great but next time I will ask for no brown sugar on the sweet potato fries.  The turkey burger, flavorful and perfectly cooked.  THE HATCH burger so spiced just right and theManly burger was soooo tasty with the bacon lardons.  And I have to say that the size of the burger was the best!   I hate to see gargantuan burgers!  Mmmmmm  we will be back!

These days it seems that everyone is doing "burger". So I am always ready to try a new place. I had heard mixed reviews about Umami. The meat: cooked perfect, juicy and seasoned well. The bread: sad to say, but it was dry and the ratio of bread to meat was not good. The toppings: not bad. The joint: a little to stiff and unwelcoming (not the people, they are cool) I am speaking about the layout. I will go back in a few months. I hate writing bad reviews and always feel that they get more than 1 chance. See ya soon Umami

This location has no freakin' charm whatsoever, but holy mother of holiness is the SoCal Burger tasty. It's totally greasy, loaded with calories, and probably going to be my downfall. Now that I know they have a location walking distance from the Arclight, I will set up my burger alter there. And then I will dream about going back. Again. And again. And probably again. Get thee to a gym, tout suite! (Because then you can have another burger.) Yowza.

Umami is one of the five basic tastes sensed by specialized receptor cells present on the human tongue. Umami is a loanword from Japanese meaning roughly "tasty", although "brothy", "meaty", or "savory" (Wiki) This is the fourth time I've been to Umami and I still love it.  There are a few kinks that they haven't ironed out yet, so here i go... 1.  They've stopped making my favorite burger - CHILI Burger! Come on! 2.  Umami allows BYOB - BRILLIANT!   3.  Kind greasy on the fried stuff.  Not straining enough or something, cause our eggplant fries AND tempura onion rings were way too greasy.   Good concept but way too much oil.  NO FLAVOR IN THE KETCHUP??? 4.  Had the Lamb Burger and it was so delicious! It came with a spicy honey yogurt sauce that was beautiful.   5.  The meat is amazing here.  That I do give them that.  Very umami. 6.  They should give comment cards with the checks, so they can get feedback about favorite burgers, etc.   Our waiter seemed a bit lost.  Another waiter started serving us and gave us our check.  Not knowing we paid already our original waiter asked if we wanted dessert.  Since we declined he said he'll give us our check.  Twice? Funny actually.   I heart this place very much but it needs a woman't touch or something to smooth out the rough edges.   Music is great but the speakers suck and sucky speaker with hard surfaces don't sound so great.   Parking isn't that great and people park like assholes here.  Oblivious to others and not considerate about the way they park.  I see valet happening here pretty soon...

Umami Burger = Belly Bomb (but in a good way...sort of) I went for lunch and got there right at noon before the big lunch rush so was seated right away.   What I ordered: 1) The So Cal Burger - I thought the meat was really good, seasoned and cooked well.  A bit messy but when is it ever bad to have hamburger grease dripping down your hands.  The brioche bun was very buttery and I was surprised at how well it complemented the meat. 2) Onion Rings - These were really good but be sure to eat them while they're hot.  Once they get cold, you definitely taste the oil. Overall, the burger and onion rings were really good as I was eating them. But near the end, I definitely felt the pit of oil sitting in my stomach.  Let's just say that I'm planning on having clear broth for dinner.   I would come back but probably not for another 6 months or so...need time to recover.

After reading many reviews of Umami Burger, M & I finally lost our UB virginity on Tuesday evening. Luckily we made it there about 7pm and found parking in the VERY small lot and grabbed a table before the dinner rush. I had the Port & Stilton burger and M ordered the special which was the MAN burger. I usually HATE HATE HATE onions in any shape or form. The P & S burger came with blue cheese and caramelized onions. Oh my god, this burger was a messy, drippy bastion of goodness. YUM YUM YUM M's MAN burger had Bass Ale drunken bacon and smoked cheddar cheese - I took a taste ... ohmigod.. very good Make sure to order a side of fries with the Garlic Aioli Dipping sauce which comes very sweetly on a Japanese spoon. DON'T"T plan to share an order as there are about 7 or 8 thick cut fries only.. and i could not imagine sharing only 7 or 8! Oh yeah, they also carry old school bottled sodas so I got to have Bubble Up for the first time since 1981... maybe 1982... We ordered the Cake Monkey desserts to go - Red Velvet ding dong and Peanut Butter Marshmallow ding dongs.. i have to say for as MUCH as i love red velvet cake... the Peanut Butter one was better.. I would definitely go back there for a burger - your stomach deserves to try it at least once!

This is one of the smallest restaurants I've been to. With that being said you might eavesdrop on some conversations from people around you. My friends and I were lovely greeted with a woman next to us talking to her friends about her 'clit piercing' and how she cleans the va jay jay. I'm sorry but the last thing I want to hear about is a vivid description of your clit while eating a delicious burger.  It makes the meal less appetizing.   The food itself was really tasty and flavorful.  I ordered the signature Umami Burger which had caramelized onions, Parmesan crumble and other ingredients I have forgotten on top of a juicy burger patty.  It was small but it was pretty filling surprisingly.  As a side dish I ordered sweet potato fries which were topped with brown sugar and a side of garlic aoli sauce.  The brown sugar added a unique flavor and these fries were probably one of the best out of all the variety of fries I have tasted and by far my favorite sweet potato fries.   Overall my experience was an enjoyable one minus the women with the clit tales and my friends unexpected parking ticket outside it was a good time PS.  The water plastic glasses were very cool.

Had the veggie burger (whatever its fancy name is, but there's only one). It was good but a bit too greasy (how do you make a veggie burger greasy?). Ditto to the earlier ketchup comment (really, just let Heinz do its thing). They ran out of ice (c'mon, it's frozen water, people!). Service was friendly (but awkwardly a bit TOO friendly; there's no need for attempted witticisms to overheard comments while refilling my water). Sweet potato fries were delish (transporting me back to the ATL, circa 1994)

I heard about this place for a long time. Finally, I ate there last week with friends. Service was exceptional!! Fast and Super Friendly!! Food was served Hot, all our sides orders came out the same time and all our burgers too. Cooked Perfect!! We started out with some recommended drinks from the huge selection of Pops. Our server recommanded me to tried the new drink Waialua Lilikoi. It was awesome!! It goes well with my middle-rare Umami Signature Burger!! We ordered a bunch of Sides such as Hand Cut Fries (Sweet Potatos), Tuffle Beet Salad, Malt Liquor Tempura Onion Rings, House Pickles, and Thin Fries (Potato Tots). My friends and I each ordered their custom burgers, 3 had Umami, 1 had Manly and 1 had Earth Burgers. We all were so amazed by the size of the burger. Not to sound like a pig, but I literally finish eating my middle-rare Umami Burger in 6 bites. At first I couldn't figure how to bite it since it was stack so high. I cutted in half and took my first bite. It hit the spot!! The bun was not soggy, the beef was cooked to perfection sooooooo..... juicy, and the whole presentation of it just tops over  what was once my favorite Vegas - Burger Bar now became #2 on my list when it comes to eating burger. We ended with 2 Ice Cream Sandwishes by Milk and had Coffee & Mint Chips Chocolate cut intos fours shared by 5 people. It was definitely one of my most memorial dining experiences shared with great companies. Everyone their was so happy after the meal. Not one felt over priced! Plus, valet was only $2.50! What a steal?!!! In fact, I truly feel their burger and all our dishes was exceptional, worth every dollar!! I love it!!

theres not much to mention about the restaurant decor, just a normal setting. I think its difficult to survive in LA w/o unique internal design...Umami thinks otherwise!! a joint to dare call themselves the 5th basic taste (sweet, sour, salty,bitter) has a lot to live up to... Umami hits the spot...you will not be disappointed!!! all the burgers are fabulous.. Its lacking the 5th star in taste category b/c the bread they use is too simple.  I know a lot of people enjoy the soft texture and fluffiness of the bun, but i still expected more.

The truffle burger and the triple pork burger are to die for. But the entire menu is delicious! Sweet potato fries and the iced tea are my go to's to compliment my burger. This isn't your typical well done, tomato, lettuce, onion, ketchup and mustard type burger. The meat is medium rare, the overall size seems small but it's very filling, so rich in flavor even though the burgers are so simple. I've been here many many times but lately, I've ordered my food for pick up as opposed to dining in. The first handful of times I visited Umami, I wasn't excited about the service. They get so busy and sort of forget about you and don't know how to efficiently balance their tasks. Having to get up to ask for my tab, getting up again to have them run the card, getting up to ask a busser for an iced tea refill, things like that. I still give them 5 stars because I order for take out now. The phone service is very friendly and the order is always ready when I arrive to pick up. Random thought: when I first started coming here, they had regular ketchup. What other kind is there? Their ketchup now looks like a blended tart-like cocktail sauce/ketchup mixture... not sure how I feel about it. Actually, I just can't get used to it. Just tastes weird when one is used to "regular ketchup". Parking: there's a tiny valet lot that costs $2-3 bucks. I park in the neighborhood behind the restaurant for free - especially now that I only oder to go.

Umami burger was really good but the pork belly burger was so so SO saltly.  I think they may have messed up my burger in particular so I won't be too critical.   The fries were just OK and they totally skimp on the sauce. It's pretty pricey and the environment is cramped but overall, I thought it was good.

On my way home from Umami I was thinking of how I could describe my lunch experience.  I started to think, Ok Fathers Office is definitely better, but then I thought to myself, shoot, In & Out Burger is better than this place! One word comes to mind when I think of Umami Burger...WHY?  I can't understand why there is so much hype for this "regular" and "not-special" "fancy burger joint".  I had the Kombu Meal #1 which comes with the "signature" Umami burger, a side of fries and a Thai beer.  Let's just say the best part of the meal were the french fries. When we arrived there were plenty of tables so wait time was not a problem.  The food however took about 25 minutes to arrive.  Um...why!  It's just burgers and the restaurant was literally only 60 percent full.   Here's a breakdown of the meal my buddy and I had: 1 x SoCal Burger - $9.00 (Not bad but nothing spectacular...very gourmet in a big mac sort of way). 1 x Kombu Meal #1 - $14.00 (Burger was way overcooked and flavor was not very good, Thai Beer was the worst I've ever had period.) 1 x House Pickles - $5.00 (What a joke!  The size of the plate that this item came on was about 8" x 12" and it included some shredded pickled carrots - about 8 pieces(think shredded carrots in a salad), 1 pickled pearl onion - the size of half a ping pong ball; conveniently sliced into 4 pieces in case the whole thing was too big for you to eat, 5 slices of regular kimchee flavored pickles, 2 pieces of pickled okra; conveniently sliced in half to think you're getting "value", and 4 pieces of thinly sliced peppercorn infused pickles. 1 x Thin Fries - $3.50 (probably the highlight of the meal) 1 x Mex Coke - $3.00 To say the least, this place sucked.  They're lucky to even have 1 star from me.

I wanted to like it, because I really love burgers, but it came up short. I had the signature Umami Burger and it was good, but not great.  The beef was juicy, but they must have used around 80 or 85% beef.  It was dripping in grease, enough to make the bun soggy and fall apart.  Also, umami is supposed to mean the sense of savoriness, but the cook must have mistook it for saltiness.  With the natural saltiness of the shiitake mushroom and roasted tomato, the beef should have been much less seasoned than it was.  A better balance of salt, and a better bun, would have made it a great burger. Strike one. For fries, I was offered the choice of thick or thin cut.  To my regret, I chose the thin cut.  I received fries that looked and tasted EXACTLY like frozen Ore-Ida fries that were baked (not deep fried) on a pan in mom's oven.  McDonalds makes a much better fry.  Strike two. Required valet parking for a burger joint, especially when your car is parked literally 40 feet from the entrance?  Really, the attendant got behind the wheel of my car, turned the wheel to the left and pulled into a stall.  Strike three. In retrospect, I would have had a better burger, and saved some cash, if I had gone to someplace like In-N-Out, Fatburger or Red Robin.  Umami Burger is a good example of a hipster LA eatery that gets mocked by sensible people who are not from LA.

You can only church up a burger so much before it becomes ridiculous. I had the original Umami burger. It was good, but not "$10 for just a burger" good. The malt liquor onion rings were awesome. You could actually taste the malt liquor and the onion didn't slide out of the batter on the first bite. Also, Faygo soda was readily available for all you juggalo types. In summation: I'm going to open a high end hotdog restaurant and call it Haute-Dawg.

Blew my taste buds away! #1 on my list. Drove all the way from torrance because the stupid White Rabbit Truck ran out of the meat we wanted.  I guess this being Plan B worked out perfectly. I, of course, went for the Umami Burger.  Just simply the best burger I have ever had.  Yes, it was a bit pricey for a burger, but definitely worth it.  This is definitely what I would call a gourmet burger.  Even the way they served the burger on a plate, such a clean presentation with the focus on the burger.  Reminded me of eating at a fine Steakhouse where they serve the steak on a plate with nothing else, like Ruth's Chris. A term that I came up with when I was eating my Umami Burger, and a bite from the Triple Pork Burger, "Controlled Taste".  It just seems for each of the burger, they were successful at focusing on the theme of the burger and bringing out exactly that perfect taste.  The thick and juicy burger patties cooked by default at medium rare was just perfect.  My buddy had the Manly Burger and It totally left him wanting a second one.  Next time I go back, I will definitely try the Manly Burger. As for a side dish, they had a special which was not on the menu, Cheesy Tots. The flavor was amazing, but I wish it had a little more gooey cheesy side. I would love to give Umami 5 stars, but I just feel that it is slightly over priced.  I mean its still a burger and paying 10bucks for a burger is still a little over board.  But... its something I really don't mind paying for once in awhile.

YUM! this place is delicious! Yes, the umami burger is liek $10 but everything is cooked to perfection. But all things considered I think its a relatively small burger. Good for smaller eaters- not for those who have a bigger appetite. We also got the hand cut fries, the sweet potato fries, and the onion rings. The onion rings were kinda too greasy and actually kinda fueled our food coma along with that umami burger which was also pretty greasy too. Next time i'm getting the turkey burger. that sounds delicious. Bad side though my friend found a hair in her burger. She didn't have to pay for it but still kinda offsetting for me. Also the iced tea is kinda gross. personal opinion.

Love it. Best veg burger I've ever had. The place is a little "high on itself". That is the only annoying thing. Last time I went to the La Brea location, there was a guy acting as a bouncer out front. Get over yourself! It's a fancy burger joint. Anyways, the food is so good that stuff doesn't take my rating down too much.

The big secret about Umami is that the signature burger is not made for people who love burgers. It is the burger-hater's burger - a post-modernist frankenwich that ditches everything essential and true. The cheese is crispy, fer chrissakes. Move around the menu. Get the Hatch or the SoCal (or the truffle if you reeeeeeally love truffles). Try the pickles, along with the fries. Come to terms that this is not a burger as you've known it, but a $10+ meat sandwich in some ways familiar, but mostly not. And do order it medium rare.

Nom nom nom!! I had to come here even though I was already stuffed from the weekend. The signature Umami Burger is delicious--incredibly savory and juicy w/ the extra mushroom flavor. My bf's Manly burger was even better! It came w/ cheese melted all over and these delicious bacon lardons that were so tasty and meaty that they almost overshadowed the patty. Yummm...too bad he scarfed it all down.. The sweet potato fries are also very good and I love that they sprinkle brown sugar all over them. Major points! Can't wait to go again next time I'm in LA...or I hear they might be opening one up in SF?!

Hmm... the umami burger is pretty tasty.  Albeit about the size of my left testicle.   Second time I went i I had the truffle burger, and maybe it was the meat flavor overriding the truffle flavor, but I couldn't taste it.   Don't get me wrong, its still a good burger, but for the price, I'd rather get a father's office burger.   And for some freakin reason both times I've gone they forgot my spoon full of aoli side dipping sauce.  WTF?

This Aint Your Dad's burger... Given, its well cooked, good bread, and so forth, but...if I'm paying $10 for a burger?...the fries are a side item? not included? I'm I still in America? Where am I?   A bit over priced since that's the only thing on the menu...I mean this burger ain't Kobe brother, and only Kobe(Bryant) could afford these lavish post-modern American originals. Def worth a taste...but make sure u drop by the ATM before coming here, or pull that AMEX out. You'll need it!

It's been a while so my memory may be a tad fuzzy but the sweet succulent taste of the magical Umami Burger - and damn, it was delicious. As I recall, it was a hot Saturday lunchtime and a friend and I were going to grab some lunch and then hit up LACMA afterwards. So, after about a 20 min walk in the hot Cali sun, we were hungry, tired and excited to try out the famous Umami Burger - plus, the line of people waiting outside this little "shake" helped fuel the anticipation. What I Liked: The Food + Presentation For those who haven't been, it's a small, cute, rather hipster-like "burger joint," but not really. It's has a rather casual-classy feeling to it. It has a very clean, Southern California / beach-esque feel to it. It was refreshing. It was delicious. It was clean. It was many things - even now, I find it difficult to put a label to the wonderful experience. Well, the food is amazing. Sure, $10 for the signature Umami Burger is perhaps a somewhat steep for "a burger" but for those who have tried here, it really isn't, just patty-stuffed-in-bread. It was different. The meat patty was cooked to perfection - not too rare, not too well done. The bread was great. Just enough grease and sauce to go with it. While this may not be "the best burger" in LA, it's definitely up there. What really caught my taste buds were the "Smushed Potatoes." The description in itself sounded appetizing - "dutch yellow creamers, double fried" - simple, classy, to the point. Really, it's like potato mashed wedges. There's something about that, a sense of simple creativity, that really separates Umami Burger from the Islands and other burger restaurants. For a better idea of what these Smushed delicacies are really like, see the pictures. They don't disappoint, I promise! Other thoughts: Next time, I really want to try the Ice Cream sandwiches. I saw other customers eating them and man, if I could have fit one into my stomach that day, I would have done so. Cheers.

I love a good burger, but to me good refers to quality of taste, not portion size. If you are looking for a huge burger, you'd better try somewhere else. The burgers are rich, so the size is not an issue for me here (I have two hollow legs, so consider what I'm saying). The Port and Stilton is my favorite by far. The Umami is delicious, and the others I've had a bite of were good, I'd say above average but not amazing. The buns are soft and tasty, and I appreciate the wide variety of bottled, non-high fructose corn syrup sodas. Yum. If you enjoy eating something and trying to pick out all of the flavors, the bouquet of yum that is Umami might do it for you. I've had hit and miss service. Always pleasant, but the level of friendliness has varied. Once when they first opened, the owner/manager guy was really warm and fun with my party. Another time (with a slightly smaller group) he acted like we were peasants and he was doing us a favor by letting us in out of the cold. I don't expect a hug or anything, but polite manners are free...

Best burger I've had, very greasy hands down. Yes the portions are smaller, but this isn't McDonald's you should go in knowing you're getting a gourmet burger and you're going to be spending a little more but it's worth it. My fav is the Manly Burger, so incredibly amazing. I highly prefer Umami over 8oz. or Father's Office. I'd suggest the Onion Rings over the Fries which are large cut, unless you like really potato-y fries. The restaurant may be small but it's so worth it. Did I mention they have Coke Light?!?!

I came here with high-ish expectations. I had rave reviews coming from my friends, then all these warnings I read from yelp, so I walked in with the attitude of hope for the best, expect a let down. It was a let down, but not a total one. The food: Defiantly not bad, but not worth the hype at all in my opinion. I think it is very easy for you to get a better, and cheaper burger in LA without too much work. I got the Turkey Miso burger and it was very tasty. The fries were quite good as well, make sure you ask for extra ketchup! The service: Oh man, everything I read on here about the service was right. They sat us outside on the side of the building, and for their sake, I hope that is the root of the bad service. We waited 25 minutes for 2 burgers and 2 fries to come out. Maybe they forgot about us? We were about to leave when they brought out the food. The waiter was not very pleasant and acted like he had better things to do than what we were paying him to do, his job! Over all, a let down for me, but I still wanted to try it for myself. I suggest you don't, unless you are very hungry and are walking by. Luckily I was with a friend so we had a good time regardless, but I warn the weary Yelper, go at your own risk.

Ordered the Truffle Burger (with truffle cheese and truffle glaze) and the Triple Pork (with a ground pork patty, chorizo and bacon.)  Both were soooo good and juicy.  I couldn't choose between the two.  From my friends that ordered the Manly Burger and the Umami Burger, they weren't as excited as the rest of us who ordered the Truffle and Triple Pork. The sides: I like the thin-cut fries and sweet potato fries.  The thick fries are good too if you like steak fries. And don't forget dessert here.  The Ding Dongs are okay, but the item that you'll be bragging about to your friends is the homemade ice cream sandwich with macaroons as the cookie.  It's in my top three all-time of favorite desserts, maybe even my favorite. There's no alcohol at this location, but the waiter said the others have alcohol.  Wait was 30 minutes, not too long for a really great meal.

I drove all the way down there just to try the burger, because I saw it on Food Network. And this burger did not disappoint. Absolutely amazing flavor. This was probably the best burger I've ever had. Unfortunately, I had to stop by Carl's Jr. for a Western Bacon Cheeseburger on the way home. the burgers in this place are tiny! I mean tiny! The burgers, as good as they are, are over-priced. They cost about $15/each & they're not much bigger than sliders. And when you order a soda, you get an 8 ounce bottle. If I could afford to go spend $100 for lunch, this would be the place I'd go. So I'm currently saving for another trip. If you do go, try the one with truffles! OMG!!! 5 stars for quality! I really want to give this place 5 stars, but they lose one for the high prices, the tiny portions, and the crappy parking situation. Only in LA would a place like this do good business

Here's how you know Umami's overrated. Your hipster retard friend swears by it. It's full to overflowing with student douchebags. Your burger, fries and parking will set you back $40 for two. The burger will arrive cold. They'll bring you the wrong fries. You won't be able to hear yourself think because of the douchebags either side of you. And the wait staff think they're too cool for school. Oh and the valet will take a fucking lifetime. Umami: don't believe the hype. You want a great burger, try Foundry, try burger bar. Try harder.

I ended up here by coincidence as I was running errands in the area. The tiny non-descript location on La Brea is kinda easy to miss, but when I stumbled across it, an even found parking in the microscopic lot, I figured I should give it a try. I tried the Umami burger but, really, it was nothing to write home about; small, dripping in grease, and soggy.  Oh, my arteries!  But was was even more puzzling to me was the overly sweet ketchup sauce used. I suppose if you like your hamburgers greasy and super-sweet but rather bland in flavor, this place might work for you. I found it to be a disappointment, and an expensive one, to boot. I'm back to trusty ol'  In N' Out. You really can't beat In N' Out.

The first time I went here the burgers were awesome! This time the burgers were undercooked for 3 out of the 4 that we ordered. There was no heating in the place (yes the place was cold). We had to pay for parking. The waitress forgot to bring us our sauces (even after we reminded her). There were great onion rings and sweet potato fries though. It is sad to write this because I LOVED this place the first time I went. Maybe they let their reputation go to their heads!

Not hugely impressed with Umami. The widely raved-about burger seems to be mostly bun, the bottom of which became super soggy after sitting on the plate for milliseconds. Or because I was currently on a low carb diet and decided to cheat, it just seemed like a tiny burger that was way too much carby bun. The hipster ambience was kinda fun and I could pretend for a moment that I would decorate my living room one day the same way they have crated bookshelves high on the walls with debris from various yard sales. Or so it appeared.

I visited this place about a month ago although I do remember the experience in my mouth oh so well. We came here on a Tues night and it was rainy outside so maybe that's why we only waited 5 minutes for a table for 2. Parking is a couple bucks which I didn't mind since they have their own parking. As my gf mentioned after her first bite, "it was an explosion in her mouth". I would have to agree 100%. I'll get straight to the point... My gf had the Umami burger and I had the Truffle burger but the plan was to split each in half so we can both get a full experience. OMG, the burgers were very juicy and not greasy. The bread was soft and I do prefer crunchy but it did work with this burger. The truffle burger was good but the Umami was LEGIT!!! Every bite you can taste each of flavors. Not like a little cheese here and a little mushroom over here. NOOO!!! Every bite you get a PARTY in your mouth. Wow. I've also had a Father's Office and I do believe that this burger has much MORE flavor. I want to come back here already and try more of the other burgers. Worst thing about this place, the portion. The burger is TOO SMALL for the price but if you balance the flavor then it's totally worth it. Flavor is exceptional but portion is small but let's face it, they leave you wanting more. I felt like the burger was almost a tease. I might order 2 next time. I'm deducting 1/2 star for the size. Overall, 4.5 stars but I'm rounding up so they get a 5.

I don't know...this location is so convenient for us but the more and more we go the more lackluster the experience. Time before last, I noticed their burgers came out pretty bloody for my taste (and trust me, 'med rare' is usually the perfect temp for me). So this past time, I was that girl and asked if they could maybe make it med well for me. She said no prob, and my burger came out much better than last time. My boyfriend, however...agreed that maybe he should have done the same, as I could see the blood soaking into the bun of his burger (same with the table next to us I noticed). You'd think service would be hard to screw up in a place with such a straightforward menu but our server well, sucked. Forgot the few things we asked for so we found ourselves having to ask again and again. Avoided us for most of the meal, didn't care to check in on us on at any point except to drop off the check. I'm just saying...Umami is overrated.  Especially when you can get a solid gourmet burger practically anywhere in LA.

The food I give 4 stars. The service I give 4 stars. The pricing I give 3 stars. The portion I give 3 stars. Overall, this is three but that's good.  So it's a 3.5 in my book.  I'm not a huge fan so I can't say four stars.  ANYWAYS, the food was great!  The five of us got different burgers including the original umami, the truffle, the pork one, a turkey one, and a portobello one.  I heard the truffle burger was amazing, and yes it is.  The bun has a fun fluffliness to it, the patty was juicy.  Now the pork one was delicious.  It was a thicker patty compared to the truffle obivously.  Also has the green tea, tasty but seemed watery.  Maybe that's how they prepare it.  The service at this particular location was very hospitable and friendly.  Thank goodness valet was also fairly easy.  A bit crowded so make sure you get there early.   However the portion seemed a bit small, at least by comparison to another burger joint that I currently love in San Diego.   OVERALL, it's a great first time experience for a burger that sells itself differently from other burger joints, unfortunately there is not enough for me at Umami Burger to keep me running back for more.

Umami has such a reputation by now. Took me a while to try their burger, and I'm impressed. The selection is surprisingly large, and there are some real differences between burger choices here. They are all, however, delicious. The place can be a bit noisy, and there's still a bit of a wait.

Just went there a few days ago and it was good. Not as good as I expected but I didn't order the right thing. I kept reading how the waitresses are rude and stuff but mine was nice and the service wasn't bad, just a little slow. The food: I ordered a triple pork burger and it was decent. I wasn't sure to get that or the signature Umami burger but the waitress said she liked the pork better, just because she doesn't like mushrooms. I should have gotten the Umami because it just didn't seem to have any sauce on it. I mean, it was good but didn't quite satisfy me like I thought. My dad ordered the Manly burger and that was my favorite of the four we got. It had crispy onion ring things and the bacon strip things were the best part. It was juicy, the largest of the four, and the bacon was just so delicious. I loved it and was upset I didn't order it. My brother ordered the truffle burger and this was my second favorite. It was somewhat simple and so juicy. The juiciest and we were told it was a sort of mushroom sauce but I couldn't tell what it was it just tasted amazing. My mom got the Socal burger which was normal basically but it had carmelized onions. The one thing I remember most from that one bite I took was how sweet the onions were. Different but sweet and very good. I would rate them: Manly and Truffle very close but Manly gets the edge, then Socal, and finally my Triple Pork Burger. If the Pork had some more sauce or their amazing house ketchup it would be up to par with the others I just like saucy burgers and it wasn't it. We also got sweet potato fries that were very tasty. We got garlic aoli which was good but the house ketchup was a lot better. And the onion rings were decent but not amazing like the rest. I tried the pineapple soda since they were out of mango and it was good, kind of like sparkling apple cider. Overall, I thought it was good. Worth the price? No, but definately worth a try. I will definately be going back for that signature Umami Burger I should have ordered. And although the burger doesn't look so big just eat one and a few fries and it will fill you up for the day guaranteed.

One of the best burgers I've ever had! But at $15 that should be expected. Got there at 6:30 on a sunday, wait was about 35 mins. Service was pretty good and fast. I had the scallop, bacon, pork belly burger that was the daily special, and I must say it's pretty d--- amazing. The scallop, the pork, the sauce, tastes like heaven. Even the bun was fluffy and crisp. We also ordered the sweet potato fries which were good, but not great, and the ketchup that comes with it is kinda funky... Even though the portions are a little on the small side, we still left feeling full, satisfied and happy ^_^

Had Umami burger. So good. The patty was so juicy and the buns were so soft. I didn't ask for extra ketchup or Tabasco b/c it's perfectly seasoned. I also ordered market salad. The dressing was a little too salty for my liking. Nothing to rave about. Just another simple salad. The sweet potato fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Tasted a lot better than the one you got at the Counter. Plus, they were not too greasy. Definitely recommending this side. For $10+ (a bit steep for a burger) that doesn't include any sides, I only wish the burger was a little bigger. After the salad and burger, I left the place still hungry. What can I say, I'm a girl with a big appetite. Lol For parking, don't bother with valet parking around noon on Sundays. Plenty of FREE street parkings and you could use a few dollars you save from not doing valet parking to buy more food elsewhere. :)

Woohoo! This place is really as good as it gets! I cannot fathom to understand why anyone would give this place one star; those people need to have their taste buds replaced- they got a bum deal. The manly and umami burger are divine- fatty, yes, but never greasy. The ground beef patty is as good as any hamburger meat I've ever had! And the ketchup will keep you coming back again and again. Oh, and they serve real Mexican coke! Delicioso!

Umami.  Love the name.   Love the fact that the gentleman was so patient and described practically the whole menu when I called for take out.   $8 burgers?  Great deal and makes perfect sense during these hard times!  We got the umami and socal burgers:  moist meat patties and very flavorful.  They don't skimp on the meat.  The bun was good, almost like hawaiian bread, but a little too doughy for me.  My husband devoured his and the rest of mine. Don't forget the homemade pickles which are absolutely delicious.  It's a nice little touch and you kind of wonder why other's don't do it.  Fries are thick and crunchy and wonderful when dipped in the homemade ketchup.  Yum! Thanks Umami for opening in the neighborhood.  You were much needed.  I look forward to trying all your burgers (especially the truffle and pork) soon!!

My co-worker had recommended this place saying everybody and their moms really liked it. The YeIp pictures made it look really good too... so I went and was thoroughly disappointed. Parking was difficult, even though they had a tiny lot. The place was trendy cool, but so small and packed. I liked that they had BYOB. The wait was a bit, but it did not matter as long as the burger was worth it. WELL! The staff was not very accomodating. It took forever to get our waters and even our order taken! Hadn't we waited long enough? The Umami Burger was meh. I loved the bread because they used chinese roasted bbq pork-type bread, so it was really soft and had a sweetness to it. But everything else in between did not stand out--it just kinda mushed together without strong flavors to accent it. I was really excited about the parmesan crisp cheese, but it gets really lost in the mush that you forgot there was even any cheese. The french fries were fat and few with an odd ketchup. If you love ketchup and the original foundation of it, you would not care to experience this. It tasted very different without any hint of tang or tomato. The potato salad had the most flavor of them all, very garlicy and creamy, and it was also a nice dish to look at. The sweet potato chips gave the meal a nice crunch but didn't really do anything else. The beet salad was good, but it was just a normal salad. For what you get and the taste, everything was a tad over-priced. The only redeeming quality about this place besides the bun, is that it's a smaller portion. Good for those looking for a light meal. If you want a better burger, go to McCormmick and Schmidt's Happy Hour. $2 restaurant burger after 9pm!

When I first joined Yelp this place started popping up on my intro screen constantly.  Every time I logged in to review some restaurant, there it was, Umami Burger, staring me in the face.  It was love at first sight and I knew that I had to try it. I was finally able to go.  We went on a weekday for a late dinner (~8:30pm) and we were able to get a seat within 5-10 minutes.  If you have a larger party, expect to wait because this place is crowded and relatively small. It's has a very modern, hip feel in the front of the restaurant with the floor-to-ceiling windows.  Unfortunately, we were seated in the backroom which is pretty small, crowded, and doesn't have any windows.  It was like eating in a closet that was converted into a place for a few stools and a small table.  When I eat, I'd prefer not to have to look at the wall. Fortunately, the food was excellent.  I had the Truffle Burger which bordered on the divine.  Despite being ridiculously greasy it still felt relatively light eating it.  I have no idea how that happens -- magic probably.  The bun was light and airy and just everything was delicious.  The burger is cooked pretty rare so when you bite into it, it's juices and grease everywhere.  So good.  And maybe even, that's what she said. The burgers aren't loaded with lots of condiments, but you get a selection of topping -- one per burger, but you can request more if you'd like (prob at an extra cost). We shared the malt liquor tempura onion rings and the fries.  I have a feeling it was the malt liquor or the tempura, or both, but those onion rings were fantastic.  This is getting me hungry. I'm not totally sure, but I suspect this place is BYOB as I saw some people sippin' gin and beers at their table.  Another bonus,

maybe i should give it 4 stars cause it is BYOB, but that probably works out to be cheaper anyways. I had the blue cheese burger (Port & Stilton), it was amazing!! big juicy salty and delicious. everything a burger should be! the onion rings and fries are great as well, not too greasy.  I left feeling satisfied not stuffed. word to the wise, make reservations, this place is tiny!!

I think this might be my favorite burger in LA. Husband had the umami x6 and was underwhelmed (I have to agree). I had the port stilton and thought it was perfection - and replaces my previous fave, the FO burger. I have to admit those are fighting words but the simpleness of the burger combined with the sponginess of the brioche led to lots of happiness. Also had the israeli couscous salad (fairly good) and the onion rings, which were GREAT (esp with the house spread, which is like crack for onion rings). The french fries were only okay (but were aesthetically quite pleasing - they were giant and rectangular and kind of looked like toys). Can't believe it has taken me so long to come here. Will have to frequent it often now.

I'm not a fan, I have to say, but I'll try the one in Hollywood...may be that'll be more enjoyable. Don't get me wrong - I like the choice of burgers (I got the juicy lamb burger), and the sides (I got the double-fried chips/fries and a friend got the plate of pickles...seemed hardly like a half portion! The onion rings seemed a better choice, but I'm the guy who'll take pickles our of my burger.) Here's what I didn't like about Umami. Since we were a group we were sat at the back in the outdoor area. It was cold. And not having any booze kinda took the wind out of my sails. Being offered Mexican cola didn't really replace the need for a beer! The desserts also seemed like a mis-match to a burger joint. So may be I'm being harsh, since the burger was actually good (although not like the first time I had a F.O. burger)...it's just the other stuff about Umami annoyed me. Not even seeing DJ Daedalus dining here could save this review ;) Umami doesn't need my custom, but I'm hoping my comments will be more upgraded after a visit to the Hollywood spot.

It's a $9 burger. When they first bring them out, I immediately thought, "That's it?" They're small, they're plain looking, and the $9 is ONLY the burger; no sides. But the burger is excellent. We ordered six for our table (party of 6), and cut them up with everyone trying some. They all tasted great. The fries left something to be desired. I wouldn't order those again. But the burgers were great. And, although small, very filling.

Also, we didn't realize they lock the parking lot early. After some friendly taunting, we did get back just in time to get our cars out. WHEW! Close call! You're warned!

I got the signature Umami Burger and my fellow diner and I split an order of fries and an order of onion rings.  The burger was yummy, though I was rather turned off by how greasy it was.  Even the bun had an oily sheen to it...not visually appealing by any standards.  But, tasty?  Very tasty.  I'm torn!  The fries and rings were both underdone in my opinion.  There wasn't much of a 'crunch' to either, which is necessary for a good onion ring especially. Final decision?  I may go back, because the burger WAS really good, but I probably wouldn't go too far out of my way for it.

A little expensive, a lot good. Very good. I read a lot of reviews. Ranging from amazing to meh. This was good today. So so so good. I went during lunch on a weekday, It was PACKED. The bad: - Watch out for lunchtime, long wait. Be prepared for it. - Valet is a few bucks. Lot is small. Street parking is everywhere though. - A little pricey. The good: - The place has a great small menu. - The food makes up for the price. - Service was very polite. I had the SoCal burger. The meat was perfect. The roasted tomato was sweet and tasted well with the greens and the bun. I had the skinny fries which had sea salt on them I think. I had the ketchup which reminded me of the soy sauce ketchup I would mix together. Still, good. Overall, I would totally come back. I just heard they opened one near my place in Hollywood. YAY! While the price is debated, the portion is perfect. I felt like I was full, but not stuffed. Very satisfying. 4.5 stars

Cute little spot in the middle of some sort of industrial complex turned shopping nook. I got the burger with the green chiles on it and sweet potato fries, everything was tasty and priced right.

I have mixed feelings about this place. The Umami burger was delicious, the meat was extremely tasty and the bun was soft, but still great.  I'd imagine their other offerings like the port & stilton would be even better.  I didn't think the burger was too small at all. The onion rings were amazing, the skinny fries were fine.  Portions were small.  The umami ketchup just didn't taste that good, it's a mix of ketchup and hot sauce, and it's given in tiny portions, which was just weird.  On the other hand, the garlic aioli was quite good, and the small portion was fine considering how heavy it was. They have Mexican Coke (made with real cane sugar) and other delicious sodas made with real sugar, which is a nice touch.  The desserts looked great (we didn't try one). Service was great, our waiter was nice and made good suggestions.  Otherwise the ambiance sucks, it's a small and cramped location, I'd probably rather take-out. Yes, it is somewhat overpriced when compared to some of the city's other gourmet burger offerings, but the burger was great and the rest of the food was still pretty good.

If I have to pick one word to describe Umami's burgers, I'd have to say "Tasty!" I've tried Truffle and Hatch burgers. I love both of them. In general, each burger's patty is a crispy around the edges, but so-very-extremely juicy on the inside. The buns are also a bit crispy around the edges, but very moist & soft everywhere else. Each burger is rich in taste.  My favorite condiments: garlic aioli. I'm not too crazy about the sides and definitely hate the ketchup (why can't they serve regular ketchups?!?!) Their sides are also so-so at best (McD has much better fries than Umami). What you should know before going there: 1. Parking SUCKS! Lot is tiny, almost non-existent. Some street parking, but good luck finding it without getting honked at on busy La Brea. Sure they have valet, but they're not there all the time, and I don't trust valet service (have you seen what those valet guys do to customers's cars?) So - carpool, people. It's better for the environment & your pocket anyway. 2.  Food is greasy, especially the burger patty. Their food is definitely not for those on low-fat diet. 3. Patty is cooked medium rare - might be too bloody for some people. I can handle beef sashimi, so this is not a big deal for me. 4. Unless you love waiting in line, come during odd hours (between lunch & dinner).

Definitely try it once so you can say you did...is it the best burger I've ever had? Absolutely not. I had the signature Umami burger - delicious but my main contention is that it wasn't cooked to order. I asked for medium well (yeah, yeah I know) and it came all bloody and pink, no outer well crispiness. I hate it when I pay a pretty penny for a burger and it is not prepared the way I requested it. This has also happened at FO's. Minus another star for the very oily onion rings. The rings were nice and thick but way too oily...I could feel and taste it.

For the past month, all my LA friends have been raving about Umami burger so I felt compelled to try it out when I was in town to see the Pee Wee Show. We arrived a bit before noon so we had no problem getting a table. I had the Turkey -Miso burger with roasted garlic and baba ganosh. I also tried the unique veggie burger, made out of soy beans, mushrooms and feta. The food was indeed delicious, very flavorful and very very rich. Even though the burgers are small, they're quite dense. As good as it was, I really can't see myself spending $20 on a burger, fries and a coke on a regular basis.

Umami was recommended to my by a fellow Yelper after my review on FO.....so I ended up here with a group of friends for lunch on a Sunday. To start you may need valet parking if you don't find any on the street but I found parking no problem. The place is very samll about the size of my apartment but the place looks warm and welcoming. Now to the most important part....the food. I got the Umami burger with salad plus a bottle of Dr.Pepper in a glass bottle made from real suger (it was amazing) which tasted nothing like Dr.Pep you get at Vons. The burger was excellent, cooked perfectly and full of flavor. Its almost as good as the FO burger but unlike the FO you have many to choose from. My friends got fries and onion rings as sides and were very happy with their choices. I ended up with the salad and was little more then let down, it was bland and not worth $4. After all that we got some ice cream sandwiches which finished the meal perfectly....so check Umami out you won't be disappointed, just don't get the salad.

Burgers are damned good. Not that big-- a trifle smaller than I would like-- but damned good. Are they better than the usual places? I don't know. You get whatever's on the menu-- which is quite a decent selection, really-- and no other choices. Meat's well seasoned, and mmmmmm it's GOOD. But better than my very favorite spots? I'm not sure. One offers more customization, the other's just straight up awesome, etc. The hand cut fries are interesting. Good if you like thick fries, but only after you give 'em 5 minutes or so so the insides cool down from ZOMG BURNING HOT. The onion rings are DELICIOUS. Lightly battered-- among the only I've found in LA that are lightly battered-- and oh so tasty. Rootbeer float also looked good-- my friend devoured hers before I could even think about taking a sip. I was too busy eating my burger. The wait at 9pm on a Wednesday night was longer than expected, the valet was a necessity (no street parking) and pretty cheap at $2.50, and no alcohol was a surprise, but that's okay. This is definitely a tasty burger, although I'm not sure I would beat my way through a crowd to come back.

1. Portions are a complete rip-off. I needed 2 $13 burgers just to fill me up with an amount of food that would be comparable to one in-n-out double double. Also, when you order their "fat-fries", you LITERALLY GET 8-10 FRIES ONLY!!! Make sure you don't get these to share, as you will only get about 5 steak fries each for $4 bucks.... what a rip off... 2. It's a burger, bottom line. Ya, it's tasty, but with such a weak portion size, and it being no tastier than Red Robin, you basically are paying double what it is worth just to eat in a "hip" LA spot. Good if you like getting ripped off and paying a lot more than food is worth for no reason. Last time I checked you can get a fatburger for half the price only a few blocks up on wilshire that tastes just as good. Seriously people, do not waste your money here just so you can feel LA hip... Be smarter than that...

Me and a girlfriend came here for our very first time and in that time there were definite moments which I can't seem to forget: the luck we had in finding street parking just a few yards away; the luck we had in securing a table for 2 rather quickly (despite the number of groups waiting outside to be seated ***this doesn't appear to be a very good place to host large parties, since the place itself is tiny***), & my first bite into an Umami Burger: wow. We each both ordered Umami burgers and a side of fries with the garlic aioli to share. Our orders came out and I was a bit disappointed with the size of the burger.  While it looked appetizing, it didn't look like it was going to fill me up, which meant I'd have to throw down another $10 for an extra order.  Anyway, I bit into my burger and was taken aback at how this somewhat small burger packed a damn punch full of flavor, texture, and juciness all in one bite. The parmesan crisp was a delightful surprise :) However, I was mindful of the fact that I didn't want to shell out another $10 and did my best to eat sloooooowly eat and put the burger down in between bites to chat with my friend and snack on the fries.  It worked cuz by the time I finished off the burger and handful of fries, I was nicely satisfied.

2 stars = "Meh. I've experienced better"  I read about Umami Burger from some newsletter.  "Gourmet burgers" and "creative" were the phrases they used.  Overpriced and pretentious are phrases I would use.  Almost every burger had caramelized onions, which I don't like, so I asked for regular raw onions.  No substitutions.  Sauces cost extra and they only give you about a spoon full amount.  Really?  I know the economy isn't good but $10 for a small burger and spoon size sauces that costs extra.  If the burger tasted good at all, I would have given it another star but it didn't taste good, it was small, and prices. For a burger place, parking is valet and they have a hostess that seats you.  The decoration was nice and the service was good but that's not enough for me to go back to it.

Oh hello amazingness! FINALLY tried Umami burger after months of wanting to go. We went around 530 on a Sunday afternoon and got seated right away, +1. The four of us shared one order of reg. fries and one order of sweet potato. Delicious. The girls thought the sweet potato fries tasted like donuts, and the salt on the reg. fries was simply delightful, +1. I got the Hatch Burger (+1, as the waitress said it was her fav, and my friends had raved about it) and it was quite delicious. I had a bite of a friend's Umami burger (+2!) and that was so good. But, she still says her fav. is the Manly  Burger. I MUST TRY THAT NEXT! So, so, so, so good. Someone asked me to compare Umami to a Father's Office burger..but I just can't. They are both REALLY tasty and worth trying. I can't, I won't...just eat both. :) YUM!

Burger gets 5 glowing stars, but other aspects (sub-par fries, LA prices) caused me to settle on a 4-star rating. The Umami burger patty is packed with juicy flavor, the condiments and toppings--crispy fried cheese, roasted tomato, and an other-worldly sauce are the only ones I had time to identify--meld together perfectly. Sides are average. They have a nice beet salad for $6 with fresh arugala. I'd go so far to say that the fries are below average. You can't be a 5-star burger joint and not have good fries. I found the selection of beverages to be interesting. All sodas are made from cane juice, including the coke which is imported from Mexico. As for the prices, well, you're in LA, trick. You won't get out of here without spending $15 per person. On burgers and fries. Kinda steep in my book. My recommendation: order a burger and stop at In-and-Out on your way home for fries.

I'm a fan. You know, I don't typically eat red meat and I don't go for burgers a lot. I guess you can call me a burger snob because I figure if you're gonna put something like that in your body, better make it WORTH it! So I've been dining at some higher-end burger joints recently (not HIGH end, I'm not rich here, people). LA seems to have a lot of them. Heard so much from friends and co-workers about this place and I used to drive by every day on my way to work. It doesn't look like much from the outside but the interior is really cute! I got the Umami Burger and my friend got the SoCal Burger. We split thin cut fries and had the mint choco chip ice cream sandwich for dessert. Burgers - Small but filling and amazing. I LOVED the parmesan crisp on my burger. Great attention to detail, not overpriced, and not greasy. My friend also enjoyed their burger. Seriously... this is my new favorite burger. Beats 8oz Burger on Melrose which used to be my favorite until now. Fries - Tasty. Typical. Worth it. I'd like to try the onion rings next time. Ice Cream Sandwich - AMAZING. These come from the store Milk which I've been dying to try so I killed 2 birds with one stone. The "cookie' on the outside was different but so delicious. Not overly sweet and a perfect serving for 2 people. I am salivating just thinking about this meal. It was as close to perfect lunch as it gets. If you love burgers, go here. Experience was nice as well. Service was typical and decent, nothing out of the ordinary.

My friend told me about this place in LA, and i was meeting up with a few friends I havent seen in awhile, so I suggested this place. The main reason I'm giving it only 3 stars is bc the service was not great. Not very friendly, not very accommodating. (they don't seat for your party until you are all there. My 4th friend came late, after we had ordered food, and they basically told her to sit separately, and that since we had already ordered they couldn't sign us up on the wait list for another table, until after a little arguing (i HAD told them it was a party of 4 after all!!), they finally got us another chair) I ordered the Truffle Burger, and my friends got the Umami Burger. The meat was thick, juicy, and quite savory (a little greasy, but guiltily good) as it mixed with the melted truffle cheese. My friends enjoyed their burgers, and the cheese was a little different. (I'm not really sure how to describe it, but it was in a thin crisp) They only had the thin fries and sweet potato fries. we ordered the sweet potato fries, which were good, nothing special. The coke is $3.00, a little expensive for my taste, but it does come in a cute glass coca-cola bottle. I'd go again, but nothing to be ecstatic about in my opinion. :)

I love Umami Burger... this is the family friendly location.  If you have kids, they'll give you crayons to draw on the tables... if you're not a kid... just ask for the crayons :P  They also don't serve all the yummy and fun cocktails that some of their other locations serve. The standard Umami Burger is awesome! I can gobble it up in no time!  Actually, I'm sure I can eat more than one if I didn't feel so guilty. I enjoyed the port stilton burger, but my friend didn't. Also... don't try to do take-out and drive 25 miles in the rain for over an hour to eat it at home, these babies taste the best when they are fresh, the burgers get soggy and you pretty much torture yourself during the drive.  But beware, you feel a little thirsty after you eat one of these burgers... hidden MSG?

Strangers, waiting, up and down the boulevard Their shadows searching in the night Streetlight people, living just to find emotion Hiding somewhere in the night...at UMAMI BURGER! Kinda hard to come here with more than 2 ppl as seating is limited already but if u come during non-busy hours its totally fine. I do like the atmosphere though, comfortable and not presumptuous! I got the umami burger and the it was pretty - almost too pretty to eat! I rarely eat burgers rare but their default cooking method is medium rare and i would say it was "rare" for me to see blood coming outta my burger LOL! the fries apparently were triple cooked, but it tasted more like tater tots than fries - still good but the onions rings were a better bang if you were to choose from the two. I like this place, but keep in mind they don't serve alcohol and you might have to wait as seating in this location is.

Umami. One of the new food trends, right next to putting açaí berries and pomegranate in EVERYTHING. OK, umami just refers to savoriness. Things that are high in glutamic acid register as rich, savory and delicious. It's thought to be one of the primary flavors along with salty, sweet, bitter and sour. The idea behind this burger joint is to combine lots of ingredients that register as savory. And, in the case of their burgers, this works quite well. Their Umami Burger comes with mushroom, spiced ketchup and parmesan cheese. The flavor is, like you'd expect, rich and savory. It's basically a good burger (cooked medium-rare unless specified otherwise) with plenty of that oomph that causes us to crave a thick. juicy steak or a ripe, red tomato. While the burger is good and flavorful, the bun, while also tasty, does tend to get a little sodden with juices and eventually falls apart. I've had a few of their sides, including the sweet potato fries with garlic aioli. The fries were nicely crisp on the outside and very tasty. I'm a fan. I can't speak for the cheesy tater tots myself, but my dining partner seemed to enjoy them. The burgers are typically around 10 or 12 dollars without sides. Now, the burgers are good, but not soooo delicious that the price doesn't seem a trifle high. If you order a side and beverage, expect to pay around 20 dollars or more for a meal. The menu did offer a few "combos", but I was disappointed that none of them included soft drinks, only beers. As I don't really drink, this was a little annoying. Finally, while I understand offering drinks like "Mexican Coke" by the bottle, I thought it was pretty ridiculous to be brought a tiny bottle of Diet Coke for 3 dollars. Could you just invest in a soda fountain please? I've been here twice and both times the service was a  bit on the slow side..and I've been here both during the dinner rush on the weekend and during off hours during the week. So, good food, attractive decor (though wish I didn't have to basically exit the building to use the men's room), but a little full of themselves. And a bit pricey for what you get. Worth a visit, though.

Back again. This time i ordered the SoCal burger which in my opinion is WAY better than the Umami original burger. My friends ordered the Pork Belly Burger and the Port & Stilton Burger. If i ever go back I'd order the Pork Belly Burger it was pretty delicious. - avocado, pork belly yum! The sweet potato fries this time around weren't as good as I remembered not as salty/sweet mixture but still good. The onion rings were over battered I wouldn't order them again. They also had cheesy tater tot special - but to me they were more like cheesy potato balls.. larger and less tater tot like... they were okay.

I'm surprised Umami Burger (as of August 2010) only averages about 3.5 stars right now. Many of my friends swear by Umami, so I expected at least a four! I went in with very high expectations, so it only impressed me to a 3. I ordered the triple meat something burger. (The one that looked like it was for dudes.) It was good, satisfying, the perfect size with a side. Yes, their burgers are tiny. So if you're a big guy wanting to feel satisfied, this is probably not the place for you. Most people we saw their were hip and cool 20-somethings that seemed to craving exactly what they got. (Not very exciting) The burger, like I said, was good. Nothing amazingly special. The texture was different, and my patty was a pink/orange fake-crab colored blob of meat, but I didn't judge, and it tasted good. Somehow familiar, but not really placeable. I tried a bite of my friend's umami burger, which was much saltier, much more "flavor," but I'm not that big of a fan of overwhelming flat flavors, so... yes. Umami is essentially the taste of MSG, and that's what the burger tasted like. As if they marinated everything with soy sauce or something. Not to hate on soy sauce (I'm Asian!) but a bit too much for me. The sweet potato fries - I was really really excited to try them, because I am a sweet po fry lover. But they were just alright. Even The Counter has better sweet potato fries. The garlic aioli was probably the best thing there. Special. Everything a garlic aioli should be. So in the end, I guess I wasn't that impressed. But I'm kind of spoiled when it comes to burgers - only the best for my growing belly. Oh, also, we got here early (right before 6:30) so we didn't have to wait and our party of 6 was seated almost immediately (they don't take reservations). But as we were served our burgers, we noticed a long line outside already. Instead of waiting half an hour for Umami for not very creative burgers, I'd definitely recommend 25 Degrees in Hollywood for HUGEASS deliciousness burgers. Plus, their sweet potato fries are to die for.

I was really looking forward to trying the Umami burger based on the positive reviews and all the yummy looking user photos provided here. Here's what we got: Started with the sliced pickles ($5.00).  Not what I expected.  I thought it would be Japanese style sliced pickle cucumbers in a rice wine vinaigrette.  Instead it was a long plate with a few long strips of pickled beet, two pickled black mushrooms, a few slices of pickle, a few strips of pickled carrot, two pickled okras, and what looked like 2 Vlasic stackers (but I can't prove it).  Would not order this again. Original Umami burger ($10.00) - the meat was delicious, high quality and perfectly cooked; the bun was soft and delicious.   What I didn't like so much was that they didn't have a traditional all-American option with iceberg lettuce, slice of tomato, raw onion and a pickle slice.  I know they want to do their own upscale sort of thing but I don't see what the harm would be in also offering a traditional option for those who want it.  I would have liked it better than the one I got (comes with a black mushroom, carmelized grilled onions and a parmesan cheese crisp). They have some different choices of fries.  We chose the "Hand Cut Fries" and it says underneath them on the menu "Triple Cooked" so I assumed that meant they'd be crispy and well done.  Not.  They were very thick steak fries, very rare, not crispy at all. ($3.50) Their ketchup is homemade.  It's nice that they make it themselves but my tastebuds are so attuned to regular ketchup that this tasted flat by comparison.  It probably has a lot less salt in it but I have to say I just wanted regular ketchup for my fries.  Also, if you want more than the small amount that they bring you in a miso soup type of spoon, they charge you $0.50. There is no beer or wine, not even fountain sodas.  If you want soda it comes in a small bottle ($3.00, I think). For dessert we had the ice cream sandwich from Milk.  There are several flavor choices.  We went for the cookies and cream ice cream sandwiched between two chocolate macaroon cookies.  This was scrumptious and I would definitely go back to Milk for it again. ($4.50) Valet parking ($2.50) Our server was very nice, by the way, so no complaints there. So total with tax, tip and valet for two people was around $55.00.  If it was the most delicious burger and fries ever, I wouldn't complain.  Since I wasn't in love with the accompaniments (on the burger) nor the fries, I don't think I'll rush back.  As I said, it was a delicious piece of meat, just not my style of burger trappings.  I think I'll try The Counter next since you have a lot more lattitude as to what's on the burger.

Meh, I've experienced better is the perfect phrase for this Umami Burger. I'm just glad that I got an AtCost coupon for my meal, because at their prices, I would have been pretty mad!! $10 for a teeny tiny burger? I hope you're not hungry when you get here because the portions are quite small. Had the umami burger, meh had better! The flavor was good, but I don't know. It wasn't spectacular... it was ok. The onion rings were GREASY. The ketchup tasted like ketchup, I know it's their signature. But meh. And the garlic aioli was laughable, just tasted like mayo. The sweet potato fries were meh. had better. I would have been happier at FO.!! :P I'm not sure if we looked like people who didn't want to pay or what, because I swear we were scooted out immediately and even if we wanted to sit and talk longer. I put the last bite in my mouth, and immediately someone came by to take my plate away. WTF? are you serious? And As soon as the clipboard came down on my bills the waiter came by and took it. F-U. And they kept putting people next to our teeny tiny table, when there were plenty of other tables around and available for seating. FAIL I won't be returning. And save your money valet-ing. Unless you plan on going between 4pm and 7pm where you can't park on the streets, but even then there are plenty of free parking around.

If you are a gluttonous portion size is everything humpback whale, head back to the bargain waters of W**mart, these burgers are NOT to be wasted upon you.   Seriously, just like a developed educated wine connoisseur you need to appreciate quality and detail for the burgers presented by Umami.  I wouldn't open a 1963 Fonseca Port for someone who only enjoys commercial beer, they won't get it.  Know yourself and don't demand that this jewel drop down any level.   Over the past year we have returned 5 times.  The burgers are served medium rare, seared to a firm texture that will hold back the moisture until your first bite.  The soft textured bun is designed to soak up the juices and isn't a sugared fast food handle.  The Umami has a Parmesan cracker with mushroom topping. Start here if you are trying to learn/understand what the taste of umami is supposed to be.  If you enjoy luxury graduate to the Truffle burger, the Port & Stilton offers a little sweetness.  The hatch chilies open your pallet to more salivation and you can take in more of the taste sensations.   The fries and onion rings have always been a side dish that you can appreciate as an interruption from the massive burger tastes.  The pickle tray offers a wide assortment of cucumbers, mushrooms and chilies that have all had different pickling recipes.  Again allow yourself the time to appreciate each taste difference.   The service has always been swift and friendly.

I went to Umami for the first time today- even though I work right by it. I was not disappointed. The selection for non-red meat eaters isn't spectacular. (one measly turkey burger) but I can't complain, I've gotten used to my red-meat handicap. The sweet potato fries were good. The food was brought to us quickly and cooked fresh. The server was quick and nice. An all-around win for Umami on this occasion. Sadly, because of their menu, i don't think I will be making too many repeat appearances. But all you meat eaters can go and enjoy it :)

I had heard that this place was AMAZING, so instead of kbbq (which we should've gotten instead for how much we paid at this place), we made our way over to Umami. Split the Umami Burger and the special (Pastrami Melt) and cheesy tater tots (also the special) with a guava jarrito.  The tater tots were really good, but they're not even on the regular menu! The Pastrami Melt was also good, but the burgers were so juicy that the blood from the medium-rare patties (still yum) soaked into everything and made it kind of hard to eat.  Roasted Garlic Aioli was kind of bland, but the ketchup was really cold and delicious (isn't that sad? that my best comment is about the ketchup?). It's decent, but I don't think it was worth the price ($25 for burger, cheesy tater tots, a drink, tip, and tax).  Will most likely not return -- ranks at the bottom of my gastropub crawl list.

I had heard about this place but quickly forgot about it...until my brother brought it up saying he was told it was better than FO's. A quick word about FO....the first time I had the burger in the Santa Monica location, I was convinced it was the world's most perfect food. But subsequent visits and the Culver City location caused me to decide it would never be as delicious as the original one. So even though I wanted to try everything on the Umami Burger menu (The waiter recommended everything but the signature Umami Burger which surprised me), I got the Port & Stilton to compare with that first FO burger. WOW. Delicious. I appreciate the Japanese thought on umami in mushrooms and beef and other savory things....and I was worried that Umami Burger would overwhelmingly use MSG to emphasize the umami flavor in the beef patty and cheese. BUT...it was so yummy. I gobbled it up due to its tastiness while also trying to slowly savor it...so difficult!! The meat itself was cooked perfectly and extremely juicy. The bun, lightly toasted. The onions were grilled down to a sweet mess so as to compliment the burger. I tried the garlic aioli which was delicious but am so curious to try the Umami Ketchup next time. I also ordered the pickle plate and was delighted with the spread of pickles: pickled okra (i loved this), dill pickled with fennel, sweet Asian style pickles (very crispy), and tart German style pickles (classic). Yum! I'm so excited to come back and will drag my husband here so I can try different items here.

So I have always heard about Umami Burger, and was curious about it. Because usually after basketball I'd ask the guys to eat there, but they like no man you need to at least dress decent before you go. I was ignorant and thought it was a fastfood joint but boy was I wrong. After a Clipper game, me and Duke C. decide to eat our sorrows away and go to Umami. At this point i was dying to go, because the latest GQ had an article about it and i was amped (plus the ScarJo spread was so amazing the image burned into my retina) We get there and its a decent showing, pretty packed but the side alcove was open so we got seated and were given the menu. So here is the order: Umami Burger, Sweet Potato Fries w/ ketchup, Tempura Onion Rings w/ House Special Sauce. The sweet potato fries come out first and they are actually nothing special, the ketchup was their umami version and it was good, a lil diff, more of a tangy tomato then regular ketchup. Next up was the onion rings. HOLY COW, these are the best onion rings i've ever had. They were crispy, huge, and had excellent flavor. Just when I thought it couldn't get better, I decided to use the House special sauce on it, and wow just wow. The house special sauce taste liks in'n'out spread on crack and just has this monster freshness to it.  I was commenting on how these onion rings would blow shrimp tempura away in a heartbeat. Just too delicious. Next up is the Umami Burger. It looked amazing. The ingredients were all present and the parmesan crisp just sets it apart. Here is the hard part....explaining how good it was. There was like a flavor fiesta in my mouth partying like it was cinco de mayo. It was just so good. The meat was perfect, a nice medium rare, cooked and juicy. I ate that burger so fast that I couldnt believe how good it was. Was debating on trying another one, but was poor so decided to wait for the next time. Overall this place is a 4.5 as of now, I wont give it a 5 until I go back and get amazed again, and this time ill take notes and try to put into words the awesomeness I have tasted. But i'll just say its very umami (lol)

I just want to say that I was going in under the guise of months of hype so it would have taken a lot to live up to what I wanted. I really want to give it 3.5 stars but it is definitely not 4 so I had to back down. That being said... It was just ok. We found street parking on a Saturday night - yay! We were seated immediately, which rocked cuz it was raining. The waiter was friendly and nice - offered us info since we hadn't been there before. We started with the Truffled Beet Salad and it was absolutely perfect. Beets, arugula and ricotta with toasted almonds and some kind of dressing. It was exquisite. We both loved it and got really excited for everything else that was to come. I ordered the Manly Burger (bacon, cheese, onion strings) and hubby got the Umami burger. My burger was heavenly. Medium rare and juicy and delicious. I really did like ti a lot. The Umami burger was weird. I know it is supposed to be original and everything but we werent fans. It was also put together so that you did not get everything in one bite and you kind of ended up with 2 different burgers, depending on which side you ate from. It really knocked down the experience. Now, what really sealed the lack of stars were the sides. We ordered the hand cut fries (um, potato blocks?) and the malt beverage battered onion rings (nothing special). Maybe we should have ordered other stuff but they were so unremarkable. I also wish the waiter had explained what the fires were like - they were seriously blocks of potato. The sauces were just eh, also. The jalapeno ranch was actually not very good at all. And the garlic aioli barely had any flavor. Maybe we were missing something, I don't know, but we've done it and we're good. Now we don't have to wonder anymore. I would go back for the Manly Burger, to be honest. Or the Beet salad. But I most likely won't.

Put all your money on the Earth Burger. Yes, I know, it has no meat... so it can't be a real burger right? Wrong, and this is all made possible by Umami Burger! They concoct a patty out of mushroom and edamame, and pair it with white soy aioli, cipollini onions, roasted tomato, and voilaaaa you have in front of you the most tasteful, delicious, piece of non-meat that ever melted in your mouth. I also tasted the Umami Signature Burger, but I wasn't as impressed with the balance of flavors, texture and harmony of ingredients as I was with the Earth Burger. It might have been the parmesan cheese in it that didn't rest well with me. R+D or Burger Kitchen still holds the place in my heart for the best classic, juiciest, freshest burger in LA =) The sweet potato fries fell a bit short for me, and the variety in the House Pickle Plate was good if you're feeling adventurous. (I hate pickles. Tony loves pickles. The ordering of this, my friends, was the result of a compromise.) Loved the space, loved the servers and the fast service; the vibe was more-so a place to bring a small, fun group of people because the tables are so close together, I almost felt uncomfortable hearing the conversation between the couple next to us. Other than that, I most likely will frequent this place until I taste everything on the menu, including the desserts! Note? 5 hours later, I was STILL full from. That's coming from someone who eats 5 or 6 times a day.

Had my first Umami Burger experience at this very location about... a year ago?  Less than a year ago?  I forget when, but I didn't forget how delicious it was. Came here with my girlfriend & her BFFL, HO SHO, FO SHO and each tried a different burger!  I got the Manly Burger, my lady got the So Cal Burger, and our friend got the signature Umami Burger.  We also got an order of tempura onion rings & their triple fried steak fries. The place looks swank, but don't let that put you down from using your hands to eat this thing!  It's a freakin burger, so use your hands!  What are you? CHICKEN? WHY I OUGHTA! The bun gets a little soggy from the perfectly cooked medium rare burger, so be prepared to use a napkin or 2.  All 3 burgers had a very unique, and delicious, taste to them, and so did our sides!   Seeing that we were way too full for dessert, and that their dessert was from a place called "Milk", we decided to wait on it and try it at the actual place. If you're into HUGE burgers, this might not be your place.  I've heard complaints about its size, but we totally overlooked it and enjoyed it for it's beautiful taste.  That, and with the sides, we were pretty damn full.  I'm a big guy too, so that should say something. Parked down the street because I didn't feel like valet... but if you're fine with that, then valet by all means!

My family and I have been in search for the "best burger" and we've been hearing a lot about this place and saw all the reviews so we knew had to try this place out. I had the hatch burger. My burger was really good i really liked it. It had great flavor and i love the chili's on the burger and the sauce. The burger wasn't too big and wasn't too small. For sides I got The cheese tater tots; were the highlight of my meal though Love TATER TOTS and add cheese to that equals amazing! Some of the other burgers that my family got were not that great though. This place was good but it could be a hit or miss depending on what burger you get. For instance the manly burger had a disgustingly overwhelming taste of beer...maybe that's the point but the beer taste was way too overpowering that it tasted really gross. My family were pretty whatevers with their burgers.

omg if i was a vegetarian and said "cows are friends" then i would be a cannibal because of this place.  DEEEELICIOUS!  I got the SoCal burger, which by all means sounded probably the "plainest" on the menu, but it was so succulent and scrumptious.  My husby got the Hatch Burger, all of the little chilies burst with flavor.  The fries we great and ketchup terrific, but the smashed potato fries were AMAZING.  We also tried the house pickles, didn't do it for us, (although i thought the pickled beets were great)   As a testament to this place, my son does not eat meat.  He will occasionally eat sashimi or if i REALLY HIDE the meat in something, but he had NO PROBLEM eating half of my burger.  This was his first burger he took a bite of EVER in his almost three years-------- and then immediately said "YUMMY!"   The meat is so incredibly tender it melted in my mouth before i could even chew.   PRO:  everything CON: small and cramped and busy... but who the eff cares.

I've been to umami a million times. literally. Have had pretty much everything on the menu, but definitely have a few favorites. On most occasions I would give Umami 5 stars without a doubt because I friggin LOVE their burgers. I have to say though that a couple are hit or miss depending on your tastes (ex. hatch burger, not spicy at allll which is what I was expecting..maybe that's my fault?). BUT that being said, I'm a die hard fan of the Port and Stilton burger. It just screams mouthgasm and is oh so satisfying for those who want juicy, sweet, tangy, all together umami flavor. Because I love Umami so much I always spread the word to my friends and last weekend I was able to introduce them to it. Unfortunately, the experience wasn't as great as all of the numerous times that I've been there. First of all, the waitress was RUDE. Usually the waiters are really chill, artsy people, but noo not this time. While my friends were trying to decide she just was really impatient, and didn't even wait for my friend to figure out what side she wanted. After that though, I was still pretty pumped for my p and s. Then, the food came. I ordered my usual with a side of the smushed potatoes. I took a bite and.....I wasn't satisfied. :(. My burger wasn't hot enough, and it was a little charred on the outside. My burger love failed me. My bf had the manly burger which is also a sure mouthgasm, but the bacon lardons weren't melt in your mouth delicious, and there were some chewy meat remnants left which i wasn't a fan of. On the otherhand, the smushed potatoes were BOMB. I wish some of them were a little crispier on the outside, but the aioli/pepper combo with the potatoes were super good. Overall, my friends didn't really like Umami, which makes me so sad because I love them. In their defense tho, it was a bad night and I wish the service had been better. I give them four stars still because I LOVE Umami

Is Umami really the fifth taste?  Is it truly the next coming of the burger?  I think that most people that ride the hype that has been created of Umami Burger might come away disappointed, but if you come with just the want to be pleased by a rather unique burger/place, you will be fairly pleased.   The best thing about the Umami Burger...is the Umami Burger.  It's small size is going to be the first big shock but take a nice taste of it and be immersed in a unique combination of flavors.  The burger is cooked in a combination of what seems to be a Sloppy Joe-like patty but stuck together and cooked like a normal burger along with a delicious soft bun...which all makes for one heck of a burger.   Add in the delicious sweet potato fries and even the slightly tangy ketchup; the nice, simple decor and set-up; and it all adds up to an experience that is pretty satisfying and a nice addition to the great burger places available in SoCal.   Its pricier than the average burger, the quantity is smaller than you might expect, and perhaps is slightly over-hyped but I'm not going to lie, a good burger joint is a good burger joint.

Yes indeedy it is trendy, hyped (possibly overly so) and way too busy for my taste but darnit, these Umami folks can sure make a tasty burger! I was raised in the midwest, so burgers on the grill were a weekly occurrence in my home.  About as "gourmet" as they got was mixing up the sauce (teriyaki on a burger WHAT?!  what creativity!).  The point of this joint is to give you an out-of-the-ordinary burger experience, and they deliver. The first time I went (two, maybe three years ago?) my only complaint (beyond the wait time) was that they were too small.  I've been back twice since then and now have no idea what I was smoking, but it must've been strong to make me need a bigger burger than Umami delivers.  The serving size is plenty... not ridiculous over-the-top huge burgers, but a nice size and definitely enough for the average eater. The only complaint I've heard from a friend is that they're on the oily side.  I like to think of it as "juicy," but I can see what he means. The Truffle and namesake Umami burgers are my fave, and what keep me going back.

My bf and I decided to check this place out and finally check this place off our list of restaurant to try. Place was packed but there were counter space in the back and we took it. Ordered Truffle burgers and it was delicious, until I reached a very salty middle! However, meat was cooked perfectly and the bottom break was nice and crunchy on the edge which I thought was very nice. Bf ordered Umami burger with no onions and he said it was good but had better. Small fries weren't all the spectacular either.

I found it hard to yelp about this place because they do somethings right and alot of things so wrong and most of those are things people don't yelp about. Valet parking sucks, the guy was unkempt, rude and has a terrible memory. You walk in and the place is tiny so we belly up to the bar, place our order and viola 20 minutes later get our first side, but no utensils/napkins/drinks. Another 10 minutes and we get 2 more sides and again we have to ask for utensils, no idea who our server is, but there are 4 people running around. The sauces come in spoons and are really only ok and not worth  $.50 additional charge Smush potatoes were pretty good, ecvellent plating sauce and the sweet potato and skinny fries were just ok. Ketchup is unique in that is closer to Jufran a banana ketchup than the heavy vinegar based your used to. Your still excited because the burgers sound great and the flavors have potential greatness. The socal uses butter lettuce, caramelized onions. My burger meat is perfectly cooked and very tasty, thick and juicy, but they used what tasted like a stewed tomato that killed the taste and the onions they used were yellow and not white. The butter lettuce didn't go well at all, basically you take all the condiments and it's a great burger. I don't know who made their menu, but it wasn't tested very extensively in my opinion. The soda's are not your typical pepsi, coke, but the mexican coke and tons of fresh  flavors found south of the border like black cherry, lime, orange and not just the fanta kind, just wish the menu showed it so i didn't have to ask. Ikea furniture and poor craftsmanship of the decorations. So how to rate  this place. 2.5 stars for service, 3 star appetizers, 5 star burger, 3 star overall. So much wasted potential here. Some new staff, a revamped kitchen and a new valet would get that 4th star.

oHHhh-Mami! These hipster burger places make me want to wear tight jeans and a vintage blazer. I ordered the Umami burger with a side of sweet potato fries and thin fries. (I know, I'm a fatty).   Fries were alright... but the sauces are what made my meal.  Honestly, the fries were just dipping tools for the aioli and ketchup. The umami burger.  Petite and perfect.  What's in between the buns other than the meat? Shiitake mushroom, caramelized onions, roasted tomato, parmesan crisp, umami ketchup.  It's a petite portion of parmesan perfection. Minus one star for this location because they don't serve alcohol.  *Gasp!* "What do you mean no beer with my burger!? You should call yourselves NOmami."  Also, it's a small restaurant and your conversations are in earshot of those around you.  So keep it PG, folks. Well, I hope my cheesiness is not a reason for you to miss out on this parmesan goodness.  It really is good.

I went to the La Brea Umami Burger with much anticipation.   I heard great reviews about this place.  I ordered the SoCal Burger with Thin Fries  the packaging was great!  But.........  alas, I am very disappointed.  The burger was forgettable and the flavor profile was confusing?  The burger looked messy and old,  I dont think i will waste my money for their lackluster burgers or there fast food resembling fries.  I could have had a V8 too make matters worse the woman placing my togo order asked me if i wanted my change?????  uh! yes! I DO!!  I dont appreciate forced togo tipping!

Umami Burger was quite an interesting experience. Upon arriving I didn't think the location would be so small, but it held quite a few people comfortably. Valet only, unless street parking is available. Want to eat healthy... not here haha I ordered the Umami Burger with Cheesy Tater Tots on the side and my date had ordered some Hawaiian burger with onion rings and an assorted pickle plate. The Pickle plate was the most unique plate consisting of a mix of (if i can remember correctly) 2 types of pickles, relish, okra, kimchi, and some sort of pickled radish and carrots. The burgers were delicious; however, a bit on the greasy side, and the lower bun was actually soggy when the food arrived. The sides of cheesy tater tots and onion rings were very good, but very deep fried to the point where i knew we shouldn't finish all of them. They had a fun gadget on the table which allows you to look at the menu, play some games (most were unavailable because they were not paid for), and PAY for your check! I thought that was interesting. Servers were very kind and helpful. This is somewhere I personally would not come too often, but if I felt like pigging out on a burger, a sure place to consider.

Umami lives up to its name. Their are tasty, I usually go to the Cahuenga/Sunset location as they have lots more space to sit. This La Brea location is convenient for take out orders, the Valet parking will allow you to park inside to pick up your order. The Ahi Tuna burger is beyond good! the ginger gives the burgers a very distinct taste. The Casablanca (Lamb) is FREAKING awesome! please try it if you like lamb, your taste buds will go insane. The Green Bird (Turkey) is a favorite of mine, always good and healthy. If you like HOT sauce, ask for the Diablo sauce but do take precautions as it is very hot! I love dipping my Sweet Potatoes or Tempura Onion Rings into it. Some people complaint about the rare cook meat, well the only and simples solution is to ask your server to have your burger cook well as simple as that.

I'm really into big burgers with tons of flavor (My favorite burger is probably Hodad's in Ocean Beach, San Diego). This place however does pack a lot of flavor into a small burger and their sides are really good too. I visited this place on a father's day outing and was pretty satisfied with the food, though the environment is not as nice as their prices would suggest The Manly Burger was manly indeed with bacon chunks about a half-inch think! The patty was good but it was a bit crumbly. I know they grind their own beef and therefore make fresh patties but I think they can figure out a way to keep it from falling apart. Again, though, LOTS of flavor in this medium size burger. People complain about the size of these burgers but I think it's worth the flavor and you can just order yourself up a side of their Sweet Potato Fries. With a bit of cinnamon sugar, how can you not fall in love with these??!!! I'm not crazy about their home cocktail sauce but whatever, you can eat all the food without it and it's still freakin tasty! Oh, try to avoid getting sat in that closet corner room. It sucks

Yes, yelpers--yes.   Umami is the cutest, tastiest burger find in Los Angeles.  After seeing this place not only on the Food Channel but the Travel Channel, I had to put this on my food trip list.  I wanted to know for sure if that original umami burger they sell is worth all the hype.  We get to Umami, which is easy to find, and found a table inside.  There's outside seating as well, but it was pretty chilly. First off, they have valet, and as ridiculous as that may sound to some of you, try finding a parking space on the street yourself!  It's worth the $2.50. We valet parked, got our table and didn't take any time to order.  It only took 15 minutes to get our burger and I was happily surprised. The burger is the right portion size and served on this nice burger bun.  That cheese twill and the onion relish with the mushrooms and whatever else goes in it was HEAVEN in my mouth.  The contrasting textures and the serious umami flavor was awesome.  I can't say that this burger is mind-blowing, but it's damn good.  My husband is one who doesn't take to a burger easy, and when he finished picking the small bits of meat that fell on his plate he said to me "it's not often that I find a burger that I like, honey.  I like this.  A lot."  With those killer sweet potato fries that we shared, our lunch was complete.  It was the best burger meal I've had anywhere, including the Burger Bar in Vegas. Love it, and I will definitely eat here over and over again when I come back into town.  This is a beautiful thing, but not beautiful enough to NOT eat.  :)

Came here on a Sunday for an early lunch and the place was near empty. I love that the people could draw on their place mats and you could see some of the art on the walls. The owner is a nice guy and helpful with suggestions. The size of the burgers are between a big mac and an Island's burger, with the average price being on the expensive side. *Umami Burger - this is an amazing burger. DEFINITELY get this one. *Triple Pork Burger - Good burger, not the highlight though. *Smushed Potatoes - Must have, extra-seasoned balance of soft and crispy. *Onion Rings - good rings, average caliber. They have a cool dispenser outside where you get a gum-ball sized ball and throw it in a random crack or nook. There are seeds in there that will germinate and make the world a little bit greener.

I'd been dying to try Umami Burger.  Picked up takeout on a Saturday afternoon and our food was ready just 10 minutes after we called in the order.  It was quick and easy to get in and out.  I ordered the SoCal Burger, which comes with a tomato spread and carmelized onions.  It was good!  As the other reviews have mentioned, the burger was definitely greasy, but not in a way I found unappealing.  My husband ordered the Turkey Confit Burger, which he enjoyed.  He said that he's had better turkey burgers, but this one had some unique flavors that were memorable.  We both especially liked the onion rings.  They had a wonderful flavor and were big, crispy and delicious. The burgers were definitely good, but not in an OMG, I need to have another one NOW kind of way.  I would eat at Umami Burger again, but I don't think I'll be craving it on a regular basis. Price point seems a bit high, but those burgers are dense and will really fill you up.  I don't think I needed dinner that night.

I don't eat  burgers and I don't like burgers, but this place made me fell in love with their burgers and my bf had to take me to the counter for a little comparison, but I still love Umami Burger more! I stumbled into the Hollywood Umami Burger on a girls night out with one of my gf. Our intention was to have paella and tapas (the predecessor at that location was Cobra and Matador). Since we didn't have much of a choice around that area and just valet the car, we decided to give it a try. We waited an hour for our tables because it was their first weekend, but then we saw a couple ordering food at the bar so we managed to somehow squeeze ourselves through the crowd and got our seats there. We started off with Bordeaux Red and a plate of sweet potatoe fries.. ohhh those fries are to die for! Crispy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside.. it definitely beats Veggie Grills garlic sweet potatoe fries! I ordered the Leg of Lamb burger and my friend ordered the Truffle burger and they were equally delicious! Their portions are small, but remember that this is after all a $12 gourmet burger. We didn't have enough, but we decided to skip to dessert that the bar tendner suggested to us. It was Cake Monkey's raspberry red velvet ho hos and ding dongs dipped in dark chocolate...mmmm HEAVEN!   I went back again, but to the La Brea location for lunch and glad to say we didn't have to wait. I had the Truffle burger and my friend ordered the Hatch burger and a side order of sweet potatoe fries.. oOo they were equally delicious as the first time I had them. I haven't been in LA for awhile, but I'll have to hit this burger joint again soon.. it has been too long (and this is coming from someone who used to not eat burgers)~

Didn't know what to try since everyone seems to like the various types of burgers here.  So went with their namesake Umami burger.  Came out lookin' small but the patty was pretty thick & juicy.  Odd thing was some bites were slightly saltier than the rest - on purpose or the chef has a stutter in his hand?  Or is this supposed to help with the 5 taste flavor sense thingy? Tried sides of onion rings & sweet potato fries (not on menu but got heads up from here).  Both were yum!  Kinda disappointed in the dipping sauces (1 per order or you have to pay extra... for ketchup?  Boooo!)  Ketchup is ketchup - garlic aioli was a mayo-ie whatevers - the Oinkster's garlic aioli was waaaaay better (but that's all that was good at Oinksters)! Servers were nice but standoffish - as if we were supposed to know what to order - but hey - four 1st timers went together - give us a break! I'm interested enough that I'll go back again to try the other burgers.

As a native Angelino foodie, coming back to LA meant an Umami trial.  Umami and truffle burgers were tasty and well-balanced.  Tempura'd onion rings light, though better in concept than in practice.  Amazing homemade pickle assortment.  Mint ice cream sandwiches from Milk, which were to die for.   Spectacular servers, who were knowledgeable about food and extremely nice  Doesn't this just make the food taste better?!?   And Lenny Kravitz was there...for what that's worth.   4.5 star food with service and a comfortable environment to eat well-thought-out, concept food at an affordable price

We had really high hopes for this burger.  It was pretty empty on a Thursday afternoon.  The space is simple with some random Asian accents, and the tables are mostly for 2-4 people each, though I think you can push some together.  There's also another room in the back with some counter space, as well. There's a small parking lot that it shares with the copy place, and the spots are at weird angles, but at least there's a lot. I wish I had planned ahead because it's BYOB, since they don't have a liquor license.  They have some interesting sodas including Mexican coke (no high fructose corn syrup). I was disappointed that they no longer had the sea-mami burger (open faced scallop burger), which I saw pictures of on another review. We wanted to try the signature umami burger.  I was surprised they didn't ask how we wanted it cooked.  The burger was juicy enough, and the bun wasn't too buttery.  I liked the combination of shiitake mushrooms and oven roasted tomato, which was a unique blend of savory and sweet, but I wish there were more tomato.  The cheese was definitely masked by everything else, and I couldn't taste it at all.  I have a smaller appetite, so it was definitely enough for me, but I could see how the size of it would leave a starving diner hungry.   Eggplant fries: they come stacked like the regular fries and cost $3.  They have a light dusting of sea salt on them, but they weren't crispy.  The batter was thin and got soggy quickly, and the eggplant was impossible to bite.  The eggplant was cooked through but not tender, and the fries basically had to be eaten whole. The deli mustard was good, but the umami ketchup was nothing special. It wasn't a bad burger, but nothing I didn't feel like I could do at home.  I guess I just don't see what all the hype is about.

I love my neighborhood, and I love it even more now that there are some hip eateries within walking distance. Umami is a perfect neighborhood joint with a small but well executed menu of 2009's favorite food - hamburgers. Reminiscent of a SF or NY hole in the wall, the space is small, well designed, and non pretentious in a, we-really-are-better-than-most-of-our-competitors kind of way. The Umami burger is fantastic with perfectly marinated mushrooms, an oven roasted tomato, and parmesan crisp.  The port and stilton burger is unctuous, if sometimes a little light on the port glaze.  The Socal burger is their riff on the In-and-Out burger, but the standout oddly enough is the triple pork burger with chorizo, bacon, and pork.  Incredible!  Sides include the meager but decadent thrice fried french fries, malt liquor onion rings, and pickles, which change almost everyday, and are not to be missed.  And they feature an interesting assortment of sodas, which together with a no corkage fee makes up for not providing alcohol. Recently they have added an outdoor patio to accommodate more people, and make it a perfect spot for those summer nights.  Bring your own six pack of beer and friends and it makes a great option for those of us who don't have a grill in our backyard. I've been here several times, and there remains two constant shortcomings: 1.  Inconsistent availability of key ingredients.  Just about every time I  go, there is something they don't have on the menu because they have run out of a key ingredient.  Such as the oven roasted tomato integral to their signature Umami burger. 2. The service.  They are all super friendly stoners, and their passion for the group owned restaurant shows, but they are obviously taking a few too many "smoke" breaks if you know what I mean, and their attention to drink orders, forgotten sides, and other insignificant things is obvious only to the diners.  Again, they are totally cool, and I'm not the type to get up in arms over a side of pickles that only arrives after the 3rd mention, but it's worth noting if that kind of thing offends you. I split my time between Umami and 8oz.Burger Bar depending on my mood.

note to self and  to anyone reading this: do NOT go in right before closing (9:45 to be exact---they close at 10pm). My 2nd experience was such a disappointment. - the hamburgers were just a tad warm. Must have been leftovers from the day?!? - I  was hoping to try the pork burger, but they were out of it. - the onion rings: mushy and greasy---blah! - service was still great. - Umami Burger: although, it's their signature burger---I found nothing special about this burger nor will I be "craving it"---as claimed. - Hatch burger: 4 types of green chiles, however, I didn't taste any spice in it whatsoever. But between the two burgers we ordered, the Hatch was the most flavorful. - real soda (gingerale)---tasted like potpourri (yuck) - La Mill cappucino--- too bitter p.s. the meat is cooked medium RARE(pink almost red) in the middle. p.p.s Umami---i'm not over you yet. Give me a few months to get over this experience b/c... i'll definitely be back! ('',)

Went to Umami Burger last night before a concert at Greek Theatre. Nice little place inside, but I do mean very little. Probably could fit 20-30 people. My girlfriend and I were seated right away. No long line as many others had to deal with. I had always wanted to try Umami burger, but had never had the chance until last night. I must have looked at the menu quite awhile ago, which sparked my initial interest. It was a tough choice between the Manly Burger and the Triple Pork Burger. I was really leaning towards the Triple Pork Burger, but thought it would be best to a more "traditional" beef burger my first time at Umami. On paper, it sounded like my perfect burger(except for some bbq sauche). However it turned out to be anything but that. I'll break it down by ingredient: Meat:  TERRIBLY undercooked. I usually like my meat medium well, but on burgers I know medium is best, however this was pink. Seriously, I thought I was going to get food poisoning. (Girlfriend's burger was looked MUCH better with a nice brown burger with a bit of pink inside) Bun: Bun looked great! However, it was a different story on first bite. I think it was a combination of the juicynesss of the semi-uncooked burger and the sauce(more on the later), but it was straight up SOGGY. The bottom of the bun was almost non existant because of the juices. Beer-cheddar cheese: Sounded awesome. Beer+Cheddar? However, it had almost no flavor and was way to creamy. Bad mouthfeel. Smoked salt onion strings: These were not bad. I could barely taste them when I took a bite of the burger as a whole, but individually, they were quite tasty. The sauce and juices however took away their crispness, which I was not happy about. Sauce: Just not my cup of tea. Wasn't terrible, but I'd much rather have some BBQ sauce for a Manly burger. Bacon Lardons: The saving grace of the burger. Delicious little nuggets of bacon. I could have devoured a sandwich made of just these. So over, a very sub-par burger experience. I was very excited about Umami burger too. Skinny fries were delicious. My girlfriend however LOVED her Umami signature burger, so I know its not all bad. I will be back to try the Triple Pork Burger and update the review. I will

Really really great burger!  I got the manly burger which has thinly sliced, crispy fried onions along with GIANT chunks of fatty bacon (aka bacon lardon) on top with a spicy mustard coating the top bun and a thin ketchup lining the bottom bun.  It is deceptively small because although halfway through (and a ravenous pregnant lady to boot), I was getting close to being full.   We went at around 11:30am, so we managed to miss any lunch time crowd (and got great street parking) and ordered to-go.  Quick, simple and totally tasty.

We had the Umami and Hatch burgers with the Onion rings. It was oh so good. The onion rings was the perfect partner to a quality meat I have been looking for all my life. If your ever in the area. Go ahead and try it for yourself. You will not be disappointed. Can't wait to try the other burgers in the menu on my next visit.

I decided to see what the rave about Umami, after all it's does have a good ring to it. The burgers here are definitely worth it, each one packs a certain explosion of flavor every bite you take.   What I won't suggest you get are their fries and onion rings, that was a completely downfall for a burger joint. It's like how do you eat a sandwich without chips?  They really need to step up their fries here, not worth it in my opinion. I've came here several times with a good girlfriend of mine and we always have a tough choice deciding which burger to get.  So be adventurous, try their specials and you won't be disappointed.  Gotta love their non-corn syrup sodas, it's amazing! =)

Came here randomly one night with a few friends, one of them said it was a good burger restaurant so why not sample a taste of LA? -Interior A small restaurant overall, seating indoors maybe for 30 and another 30 outdoors. They have valet parking for $2 or you can try to find street parking. Can't comment much more on the decor inside because we sat outside, which on that night was on the sidewalk. -Service Supposedly bad service here but my experience here wasn't bad, considering we sat outdoors, out of sight of the workers. Throughout the night they kept wandering about to make sure everything was alright. We didn't wait too long for our food to come out, the side orders also came out at the same time, we had to ask for the side sauce you get when you order a burger though. -Food I got the manly burger which was delicious and very oily, you can see it glistening on the bun. I thoroughly enjoyed each bite knowing that it's going to come back to haunt me at the gym. We each got the side order of fries but I wouldn't say it was worth it, steak cut fries in a small bowl with a spoon full of ketchup. The side sauce I got was the spicy one, which tasted like something you would find at an Asian restaurant that has those jalapeno and pepper condiments. If you don't mind having stinky breath for the rest of the night I would recommend the garlic aioli. Overall I would recommend this place to a friend who was in the area and wanted to try a good burger, kind of pricey but it's worth a try. If you're extremely hungry then you might want to skip this place because the burger isn't big since they go quality over quantity here.

*Ahhh*  I finally had Umami! Umami is a Japanese word with many meanings. The easiest definition would be savoriness or flavor from an elevated combination of sweet, sour, salty and bitter. Dinner on a Saturday night at this location was packed. The wait for a party of 2 was 25 minutes when we arrived around 8:30pm. Once inside we already knew what to order since we checked out the menu while waiting. 01. UMAMI BURGER ($9) A must order since it's their signature burger. The burger was filled with parmesan cheese cracker, sautee onions, shiitake mushroom, Umami ketchup, and oven roasted tomato. The flavors melted together deliciously. I could tast every flavor.   02. HATCH BURGER ($9) They were out of the Triple Pork Burger, so we got the Hatch Burger. This burger has four types of green chilis and house cheese. It wasn't spicy at all. The flavor combo was okay, sort of bland. The Umami burger is better. 03. HAND CUT FRIES ($3) It was triple cooked since the fries were thick cut and rectangular. The outside was crispy and the inside was potatoey and soft. 04. MEXICAN COKE ($3) Sweeter than the regular coke. It just taste better with natural sugar. All burgers are cooked medium rare. The meat patties were slightly charred and packed loosely -- not dense at all. Soft toasted broiche buns were used for all burgers. The size of the burgers are good, not too big or small. Everything tasted fresh and not heavy. I'd come back to try the SoCal and Triple Pork burger. Cost for party of 2: $25 w/o tax and tip.

The burger can't be beat. Period. (My personal favorite happens to be the Truffle Burger). The wait can sometimes be long, but it is well worth it. The sides and desserts I can live without, but the burger is delicious. I have to say, some close compatibles for me are Father's Office & 8oz Burger Bar, but Umami takes it for me. Enjoy the burger!

OH WOW!!! I thought nothing can compete with In-N-Out especially if you're been brought up in So Cali. This one might beat the punch out of In-N-Out. Stopped by here for lunch on a Saturday. Had the Kaui Burger. Added some onion rings and "skinny" fries (community share) with two people with me. The other two people with me split the Truffle burger which both of them pretty much fell in love with it and was down to come back for dinner The burger couldn't have been cooked any more perfect. Juicy and full of flavor. Nice balance with the sauteed chopped pineapple pieces. Onion ring and fries weren't spectacular to rave about. Lacked any flavor besides the deep fried goodness. Their homemade ketchup attempted to make up for it. Service-wise was pretty decent. Placed our orders in after about 5 minutes to contemplate on what to to get. Our orders arrived about 15-20 mins. Ambiance had a modern contemporary decor and furniture. A bit "quaint" / small in size for a restaurant.  Parking was a pretty much valet ($2) in the small private lot next to it. Expect a 15-20 min wait on average if not more as this place seems to be at full capacity every time I passed by before coming here. Definitely would come back here for another dose of Unami!

My cousin realllllly wanted to try this place. I think I'm kind of over the gourmet burger joints already (because lets be real, I'm just as happy with an In N' Out burger versus these $8 ones). However, I still decided to give it a try. My cousin ordered the Umami Burger. It was pretty good I thought. I ordered the Turkey Confit burger. Not so good. The Umami was better. Ordered a side of fries (really 5 fries?!) and sweet potato chips. The sides were just eh. So why am I giving this place 4 stars when I sound less than enthused? Because its BYOB no corkage fee. How freaking awesome is that? The fact that we were able to bring a bottle of wine with no corkage fee to go with our burgers was awesome. The service was also pretty good. So pretty much if/when I come back, I will have a bottle of wine in hand.

This is an extremely popular upscale gourmet hamburger restaurant.  One clear trend reported in some of the reviews that I noticed was the very good, friendly and helpful service.  The service really deserves 5 stars. French Fry review: The "hand cut" fries here are quite unique.  They are the fattest fries I can remember having and you only get a small number for $3.  In general, fat fries are only slightly crispy and turn to mush in the middle.  These fries are a remarkable exception to this norm.  They retain pretty good potato flavor and texture inside while managing to have a nice crispy outside.  For fat fries, these are some of the best and certainly the most unusual.  Unfortunately, they have no skin and are somewhat bland but the creative sauces available for the burgers in this restaurant have the potential to be used as a dipping sauce to improve on these fries. Ice Cream Review: They sell ice cream sandwiches here that are freshly made daily with regular changes in what flavors are available.  The ice cream used is very good but not outstanding quality.  the standout feature of these ice cream sandwiches is the delicious and chewy macaroon that they use to create the sandwich, excellent!.

I'm all good with this place.  Burgers weren't huge but they were super tasty and juicy.  Onion rings were scrumptious!!  Truly truly Scrumptious!   Can't wait to going again!

Came to this place a while back, had heard all the hype and decided to give it a try. The main thing that got me there was a few people saying it was "better than Father's Office" - had to find out for myself. So I'm not sure if its still that way, but they don't serve alcohol, so you can feel free to bring your own and there's a corkage fee - kind of neat. The burger itself was very delicious, can't quite say it was as good as Father's Office, but it was definitely up there. Second best burger I've ever had? maaaybe. The fries were very "whatever", they were definitely trying too hard. The place is casual, nice tables/chairs, but cramped, really small location. All in all, you gotta try it, great burgers!

There is nothing ew about umami burger. Only go to this restaurant if you would like to be in a food coma of pure happiness. The onion rings were so good, light, and crisp. I loved their katsup, as well as the garlic aioli. You have to get their side fries instead of having the thick fries. I don't know why they would even have them besides the fact that they may look cool to some people. Those would be my worst nightmare of french fries, so I'll stick with the thinner option. The burger is all the best flavors combined into one burger. I mean who puts frico on a burger?! It's fricking amazing! I kill for savory and this is the epitome of savory. They also have a great selection of pop. I had their ginger ale which was just amazing and it went perfect with the burger. They also had a cherry soda that was so good. I can't even explain. I'm giving them four stars because the service wasn't really up to par with what I expected. We got our burgers before the fries came out. We had to remind the waiter twice that we had ordered them. It would have been nice if the waiter had been a bit more attentive, but other than the service the food is amazing. So if you can put up with a little of that, you've got a great meal.

BEWARE: NO ALCOHOL AT THE LA BREA LOCATION. Started with the TRUFFLE BEET SALAD! Served with wild arugula, fluffy ricotta cheese, shredded almonds, and an incredible truffle dressing! Then I had the TRUFFLE BURGER! If you like truffles, both are a must-have at Umami Burger. My wife had the TURKEY MISO 2.0 BURGER. It was OK and probably not worth trying. For sides, we had the MALT LIQUOR BATTER ONION RINGS with garlic aoli. Very thick and doesn't fall apart after biting into it. For drinks, my wife had the ice tea/ lemonade aka arnold palmer. It was refreshingly unique with some very organic elements to it. Try the LEMONADE! EVERYTHING WAS OILY! But pretty tasty, thanks to the truffle stuff.

Deliciousness has a name, and it's Umami Burger. The first bite of the SoCal Burger was extraordinary. Having the perfectly cooked burger hitting all aspects of the palate makes the mouth instantly drool for more. The butter lettuce, oven dried tomato, American cheese, caramelized onions, and the spread complimented every succulent mouthful of beef and bun. Ah... Uh, anyway...we must have come right at the beginning of the lunch rush. We waited for about five minutes for our party of five and after we left, the wait seemed much longer. Valet parking is the only way to go here so if you want to save some money, try to find parking on the street, though it may be a bit of a challenge. I was not a fan of the Truffle Burger. The flavors of the Italian truffle cheese and truffle glaze were not there. The burger just tasted overcooked and a bit bland. What a disappointment. The fat fries were tasty and the onion rings had a light tempura batter that didn't overpower the natural sweetness of the onion. I love fries and/or onion rings with my burger but the flavor of the two seemed to overpower the flavors of the burger, not compliment it. I washed this all down with a bottle of Chai Cola. I'm not a fan of Chai tea but I enjoyed the Chai Cola. It is an interesting twist to my favorite soda. Good: SoCal Burger...drool... Bad: The Truffle Burger disappoints. Final: For a great burger, Umami is the place to go.

The portions are really fair. Yes, it's $10 for a burger that doesn't seem that large, but I'll be damned if I didn't feel HELLA full at the end of the meal! I got home and legit knocked out on my bed for four hours. I had the Umami burger, which was absolutely delicious. It had carmelized onions and shiitake mushrooms with their special house spread, plus this parmesan crisp for the cheese slice...so good. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I also had their malt tempura batter onion rings, which are good for the first few bites/first two onion rings, and then I just got full because they're so heavily battered. Portions are a bit small but definitely filling. I also had an ice cream sandwich for dessert--they sell ice cream sandwiches from Milk in the restaurant! (For those who don't know, Milk = bougie ice cream spot a few miles away, near the Beverly Center) Service was pretty good, we came in on a Monday at 4pm so it wasn't very busy. Cool fact: they have something like 15 kinds of soda! :) I ordered their strawberry lemonade, good compliment to my burger. Also, this is random, but they have this really cool plastic glass for your drinks with a little notch that acts as a thumbrest.  I was very intrigued by it :)

The burgers are actually really really good but I think for what you are paying its pretty over-priced and their service is SUPER Pretentious. I have news for the owners-just because you are popular now doesnt mean you wont have steep competition later so be a little nicer to your patrons. The servers and people behind the cash register are all really snooty like they dont have the time of day for you and that they dont need to answer any questions because their food is just THAT good. Also I had a problem with the bathroom and I flagged I believe one of the managers and excuse me but he was such a D*ck! I told him the bathroom wasnt locking and I felt uncomfortable since this is the only bathroom for the restaurant and it's just a single so anyone could open the door on me.. He looked at me like i was crazy and was so annoyed (actually refused at first to fix it)  he had to fix the lock situation. RUDE! Anyway on to the burger, it was really good and unlike any other burger I have tried but because we couldn't ask how we wanted it cooked mine was too bloody inside. I am starting to like my burgers medium but I dont like when the bread gets drenched in blood... it grosses me out. The burger was small but filling since the ingredients they put in the meat are all really rich and the bread is really buttery and good.  I felt extremely heavy and bogged down after I ate the burger though. Also the onion tempura rings just SUCK, I dont know why people like them. There is no flavor and they are extremely over battered. Plus you get what, like two onion rings? Like i said, this burger was unlike others i have had before because there is something that makes the burger super rich tasting like truffle oil (btw both burgers we had tasted similar i got the umami and i think the california burger) so thats why I am giving this place a 4 star rating because it was so unique but the bogged down feeling i had after (maybe also because it was also really undercooked) plus the snooty service from the waiter and MANAGEMENT and the price makes me question if i would come back. Glad I tried it though to see what the hype was about....

Juices running all over the plate, the aroma of medium cooked beef mixed with all the right toppings and our hunger eating away at my stomach in anticipation of it all... yeah, the burgers were definitely good. Especially since I was just watching MVF at home and they kept showing burgers!!! So with a party of four, the wait wasn't too bad during a weekday evening and we were able to order almost half the menu... can we say, burger buffet!!! Expect it wasn't all you can eat... that saddens me. Anyway, I will say the two favorites were definitely the Umami burger and the truffle cheese burger. I didn't like the one with the blue cheese too much and the other burger we got, the swine burger was just okay. Sides were a bit small but hey, they were only like $3/each so can't really complain. The pickle plate was good. And yes, you should definitely top it all off with dessert. Limited selection on that so might as well get everything... haha. Service was extremely friendly. Would repeat.

Hmmm... I would love to give this place a better review but I just feel the burgers are a bit over priced! I had the truffle burger... it was a bit small, not enough truffle to see if it had truffles in it... but in fairness, it was pretty decent and the meat was cooked exactly right... just not mind-blowing! I recommend the tempura onion rings! Its great! Perfectly cooked! Also, the sweet potato fries... sprinkled with cinnamon... yummy! Parking sucks in this hood though... don't bother trying! They do offer valet parking...

The veggie burger was delicious. Was it worth $10? Probably not; but I would still come back for another one. Umm... the hand cut fries. I don't know why that is the name for these. They should be called "potato bricks." They are like huge chunks of potatoes. Not my thing; I will try the skinny fries next time. The cakester dessert thing... I don't know how much it was I didn't look at the receipt but those things were pretty good.

Completely overrated.  I ordered the "Manly Burger" and fries; the skinny ones. I can't believe these burgers cost $10 average. Rip off like a mofo.   It's only like a 6 oz patty.  If you're looking at pictures in the album and catch yourself saying "Those burgers look small".  It's because they ARE small.  Don't get me wrong, the burger is "good", at best, but NOT $10 good! Also, the fries are $3.50 and honestly, they taste like frozen fries.  That's some bull$*^t.  If I'm paying $3.50 for fries they better not only BE fresh they better TASTE fresh.  NOT FROZEN.   Decor is cool, the help is okay, but just not worth spending $14 for a burger and fries.  Not memorable at all. Completely forgettable.  Another note, if you order water, it comes in wannabe PLASTIC stemless wine glass with a thumb grip.  Plastic for Dine In??? C'mon!!!!! Get a Father's Office burger.  You'll enjoy your money spent there.

yummy! The atmosphere of this place is really nice. It's rustic and dim but has a cozy and warm feeling to it with giant gold framed mirrors on the wall and wood accents everywhere with dark wood furniture. I love the random neon signs saying chow mien, if I remember correctly, and what not. I came here with some girl friends and we all ordered a different burger on the menu, I ordered this veggie burger, I don't remember the name I think it was like earthen burger or something along those lines haha, they had which is not on their physical menu but was one of the specials on the huge chalk board they have that has changing specials and stuff and it was really good! It was not dry at all and super moist and flavorful that it dripped juices haha mmmmm. I love the buns they used, it was airy but heavy with fluff at the same time, so yummy. The burgers only look tiny on those big square plates but they really fill you up. For our sides we ordered 4 sides: hand cut fries, onion rings, sweet potato fries, and thin fries which was perfect amount for us 5 girls. The hand cut fries were really interesting, they were thick bricks of fries, just imagine the jenga blocks but fries haha it was pretty interesing, nothing special just the way they prepared them. The sweet potato fries were yummy and the thin fries were good too but nothing special. the onions rings were good, I really liked them because it was tempura styled and the onion retained their moisture and were super big. They also had a selection of draft beer but we didn't order any. They have wine and other beverages as well. I thought the "mexican coke" was really interesting on the menu, it's just coke in its original glass bottles. I never knew that's what they were called haha. For your sides you get to chose condiments too and we chose: umami ketchup, dijon mustard, house spread, and roasted garlic aioli which was our favorite. The ketchup had a really familiar taste to us but we all sat there tasting it and still couldn't think of what it was but we knew we tasted that somewhere before haha so if any one knows! And we didn't really like the dijon mustard, has a strong mustard taste for people who like that, like a strong mustard spice. This place is definitely worth a try! Recommend to burger lovers! You'll have one hell of a burger.

I got onion rings and the Earth Burger. I was a little hesitant to get the burger because the patty is made of mushroom and edemame.   When I saw my food, my first thought was "Hmm, it looks kinda small, will it fill me up?"  And I must say it did satisfy my hunger.  THEIR PORTIONS ARE VERY SMALL!  So if you have a big appetite don't come here, you won't be happy.   Unlike the other Umami locations this place doesn't have beer or combo meals.  Their service, wait time for food,  and taste of food was great.  They do valet for $2.50 or street parking.

God, I love the burgers here.   Well, I've actually only had one burger, but had it both times I've been.  The Manly Burger.  Cheesy, bacony, beefy goodness.   It's so good that you get angry about other burgers you've had. It IS true that the burgers aren't huge, but I think they're still excellent...and I wouldn't say that they are small.  They're normal size (probably around 1/3 of a pound). Two mini gripes  First, the fries.  I don't know...I just think they're okay.  Then the sauces they give you are so tiny.  I mean, really really small.  Even the ketchup (which I think they make there) is hardly enough for one order of fries.   It's maybe enough to use on about 4 fries...then its gone. But, I'll be back...Manly Burger!

Everything was salty and yummy, esp the Manly Burger (onion-bacon-cheeseburger), cheesy tater tots, and sweet potato fries. Even the plastic cups looked awesome! The Manly Burger was pretty salty, since my idea of umami is soy sauce, Maggi, or miso, Umami doesn't really live up to its name. Saltiness aside... the bun was fresh + soft without being soggy (unlike Kalbi Burger's soggy but tough buns) and the meat was cooked just right (medium). The Earth Burger, however, was disgusting. I thought they brought me a raw meat burger, but it turned out the mushroom + edamame patty was a purple pink disc. I ate most of it seeing how it cost 11 bucks, but NEVER AGAIN. Even the waitress didn't know why it was such unappetizing color and had a hard to finding something to compliment about it. If only she gave me that look BEFORE I ordered! Also, we came during Friday lunch hour, noisy as hell. Otherwise, very cute place to dine for couples or SMALL groups.

Ahem.... So Umami Burger..... What can i yelp about you... I got recommended to try this place by my fellow co worker. She says she heard about it from that food network channel - "The Best Thing I Ever Ate"... Well sorry to break it to yah but this WASN'T the best thing I!! ever ate lawl.... it's The Worse Thing I Ever Ate (HEY!! there should be a tv show on that!!) My bad but, it was pretty disappointing....  I wasn't impressed by the burger and the fries... and the ketchup.... Burger: I ordered their specialty burger the "Umami Burger" which consisted of a hamburger bun i believe it was like around 1/3 ish along with some mushrooms, cheese?!, etc etc idk i didnt' care to look. I was basically diving into this burger w/o knowing what was in it... (the menu doesn't list it out...) At least if i knew what was in it... I wouldn't of been as surprised....  Also my burger was definitely undercooked it was way too pink to be medium well and it just broke apart i felt like a vaccum trying to eat this thing. I mean this thing was like RAW inside and they just burned the heck out fo the meat outside to make it look like it's been cooke dawhile... AND! the bun?! i couldn't recognize the bun it was charred as well.... fail #1 Fries: I ordered their hand cut 3x fried french fries.... the french fries fail #2. I tried it w/ and w/o the Umami ketchup (fail 3) but we'll get to the ketchup later. But anyways... I dont know how to describe it.... I took one bite stared at it for a good min and didnt look back... it just seems like a neatly cut potato wedges more than fries.... this thing is a bit big to give it the name french fries.... (skip the fries.... ) Ketchup: What is this? Salsa? ketchup? both? the aroma that kicks in when you taste it makes me feel a bit nauseous.... Iono maybe bc i'm sick but i've been sick for awhile and nothing came close to how i felt when i tasted their ketchup.... the ketchup looks like its been watered down or something.... i feel like i'm dipping my "french fries" in salsa dipping more than ketchup... I get this weird after taste even coke and coffee doesn't get rid of.... Waitstaff: I called in to place and order and right away i sensed some attitude... (lose it. I got enough shit to deal with i dont need to take on yours) it's not my fault you only went to HS and ended up working at a fast food restaurant... He started talking to me like he's friends with me calling me "honey" uh excuse me?! Ahem... Newais... I came into pay and the place is pretty empty considering it was lunch hour i was surprised but after my experience... not so much... Idk maybe it's an aquired taste and you need to get used to it or you dont... But i wasn't really impressed by it enough to recommend it to other yelpers... Sorry Umami but your burgers weren't worth my 14 dollars.... I could of walked across the street and gone to the counter... instead of driving 5-10 min for this mediocre burger.... Umami has failed at Umami Burger...

TRUFFLE!!! TRUFFLE!! TRUFFLE!!!!!!! This burger was juicy, tasty and 100% awesome. I have never tasted anything like this. The bun was soooooo soft and almost buttery. I fries were okay. My diet coke was in a bottle, a small bottle at that, for $3.00. Back to the good stuff...This burger, although it was $11.00 it was the best money towards a burger that I have spent. Whoever said In n Out was the best burger?! DISAGREE! This is delicious and beyond bombskies. The workers here were helpful and the place was small. These are all just minor details. GO GET THIS BURGER!!!

Burgers & More Burgers, so many to Rate and soooo little time! Umami is considered a "Gourmet" burger, so no defense to it's own that alone puts it in a tough "put up your dukes" crowd. The #1 spot and a KNOCK OUT punch for a "Gourmet" Burger goes to Father's Office hands down! Umami skates in just above Counter Burger but a few rungs down the latter from Fathers Office. Hmm sometimes bad things happen to those that put too many links in the chain, I hope Umami can hold it's own in the VERY tough burger battlefield -

One of the best thing's I've eaten in my life thus far... 1) Get it medium rare, that's the way it's intended to be and adds to the unique beefy experience. 2) Start off with the Umami burger, common sense huh?  Expand to the others later but Umami first and foremost. 3) Tempura battered onion rings with the special ketchup is a must, nuff said. 4) Be glad there are multiple locations for this truly unique gourmet burger! 5) Stop bitching about the wait times, it's busy for reason, deal with it.  This is a destination place so plan accordingly or get carry out.

While this burger may be good by LA standards, it is far from the best burger. Anyone with any travel experience knows one thing - Bartley's Burger Cottage in Harvard Square sets the bar for all burgers anywhere in the country, or world for that matter. I have been fortunate to live all over the world, so I speak from experience. After living in NYC for 3 years, I was able to try every burger place from the OVERHYPED Old Homestead (supposedly one of the most expensive burgers in the US), 21 Club (about $40), and cool 'burger joints' like - The Burger Joint hidden in the back of the Parker Meridien Hotel without any signs or anything. NOT EVEN CLOSE to Bartley's Burger Cottage! So while Umami is ok, everyone needs to take a trip back east so they have a real comparison! Umami is very LA/pretentious with the presentation, and stuff that doesn't belong on a real burger. Not to mention very expensive for the size of the burger. Plus, the service matches the hype - Very pretentious! I mean after all, how many REAL burger places have valet?! C'mon... Cali needs a lesson in burgers because In-n-Out, Fatburger and Umami may be good, but compared to what?!

Seriously, I think they sprinkle a little crack on these burgers. They're so good and addictive. Other gourmet burgers cost about the same or more, yet are not nearly as juicy. The only thing is that the burgers tend to be a little bit greasy for my taste...but I don't mind! And the venue is very small, but it's intimate. You just have to know what time to go which is not during rush hour. If you go there hungry during rush hour, you'll suffer! The aroma will only torture you. I like this location better than the Fred Sigel one in Santa Monica. Don't get me wrong! They're still good, too; Maybe I'm just attached to the La Brea location. ;)

Okay, so I FINALLY got to try Umami Burger after a few people recommended it. We both ordered the popular umami burger, cheesy tater tots and tempura onion rings.  The burger was juicy and pretty flavorful.  Would I crave it and make a special trip to order it again?  Not really.  It was good, but it wasn't spectacular.  Maybe my expectations were too high.  The tater tots were okay.  It had a tanginess I didn't really care for and the tempura onion rings were way too greasy and the batter was too heavy.  When the crispiness wore off it turned gummy.   It was a fun place to try out and I might return, but unfortunately it didn't make a big impression on me.

Pretty good, I got the truffle burger and thin fries and ranch. Good flavor but the bun on the bottom was pretty soggy, not sure if it was from oil or what but kinda turned me off texturally.

We experienced slow service and a long wait at 630pm. The Earth burger was flavorless. The worst part was how the waitress treated me when I said I was vegetarian ("I don't know what's good for vegetarians, I eat meat!!") and then the Earth burger flavorless. The Earth Burger (edamame and mushroom) was so bland a plain bun would have been better (the bun is nice). It was surely not worth the price and really not a good place - skip it. Everyone in my group agreed this place is pretentious - no descriptions on some items on the menu, snotty attitude, this place thinks it is great. Sorry to say.

More like 3.5 stars  Had the truffle burger which was very tasty. Mmmm yummy. The smashed potatoes were good as well with the pepper and aioli dressing which matched well. The meat tends to be cooked more raw then what is ordered. So if you want a medium rare, better order a medium. Would definitely go back and try some of their other burgers.

If I was to rate the experience on the burger alone, instant 5 stars. Umami burger and truffle burger were outrageously good. Lamb came in next and Ahi was a major fail.  Fries were just ok, onion rings were too far and few, and the home made pickes were not tart enough with no bite or crunch. No alcohol was the first reason for this place loosing one star.  We were told that all their other locations had their alcohol license except for this one, wth?  Going back to Fathers Office where I can get my burger fix and have my choice of brew from the extensive list of craft beers. Second loss of a star was for the small bathroom which I stood in front waiting for 10 minutes while and employee took his precious time.  I saw our table's bill get delivered, come back to the register, and go back to the table again. They should have chose a better location with better parking and built another bathroom.  Combine this with a long wait, small place, and no alcohol for me to wash down my burger, i'm not coming back.

I've waited so long to review the Umami burger, but I was not as amazed by it like others have been. I loved the cheese crisp in the middle - just like the cheese that drizzles out of a grilled cheese onto a hot griddle. YUM! But everything else in the burger didn't stand out. I didn't even know it was there until I looked....lo and behold! there's actually stuff on top of my burger! About six bites later, I was done with my burger and moved on to the beer battered onion rings. These were the best rings one can get (except maybe an engagement ring). Golden (not golden brown, but golden), crisp, light and airy batter. The salt(?) wasn't plain salt - maybe sea salt...or umami salt if it exists. Parking is a pain for this spot though there's street parking after 7 and after 6 several blocks away in the neighborhood behind Umami.

It was my first time eating Umami Burger & I've been dying to go for the longest time & I finally went! Arrived there with a friend of mine who also wanted to try, and the parking there is horrible... It's a small place with a valet, and I really didn't want to take up the valet, but after circling around the neighborhood, I just gave in. Valet was $1.50 (I don't remember) Got there, got our name down on the list and the wait was about 15 min. That day was very windy so I told the guy who took our name down that I was going to be in my car waiting so when my turn comes up, he knows where I am. About 25 minutes went by, and they still didn't come & got us.. So I went out and asked when our turn was going to be up, turns out they completely skipped us! They changed the person holding the waiting list, so the new person wasn't informed that we were waiting in our car! So we had to wait another 15 min and guess what? we were skipped again! (mind you, my car was right in front of the restaurant..) Frustrated, I reminded them again, & thankfully they didn't make us wait another 15 min for a table. Our server was really nice & friendly. My friend & I ordered the Hatch burger and Truffle burger. It was delicious! I was a bit disappointed in the size of the burger for the price of it... But nonetheless it was good. 4 stars because the size of the burger for the price of it & the whole parking situation got deducted. Overall the burgers are delicious. If you do decide to come to this location, be aware of the parking struggle...

Yes, the burgers are delicious. No question. Yet little things bug me.  It's a burger place, yet one can only order the full blown adult burgers-- no smaller sized/priced versions for kids.  I love my 9-year-old son a lot and he loved the food (especially the fries), but $10-12 is a lot when one can never count on kids to actually eat their food (plus sides are additional). I ordered a Diet Coke, and it was one of those little mini versions (which I find annoying when any restaurant does that), but at the table next to us the guy was drinking regular sugary coke, and it was a large bottle. Hmmm... Really good food, decent service. I'll go again when passing by, but will only take the little guy if I know he's really hungry to warrant the price.

GREAT BURGER JOINT! here is what i ordered: 1) truffle burger i got my burger medium (juicier the better ,right?) and there was truffle sauce on top. it definitely not your ordinary in&out burger. and the burger was a perfect size. 2) tempera battered onion rings & skinny fries make sure you get their ketchup! MADE BY THEM! i tried the jalapeno ranch, which was not so shabby, but the ketchup went well. service: the servers are very "homey" love to talk to you and make sure you are well taken cared of. if it was not so far from me, i would definitely drop by this place more often!

I went to this place last summer and I was quite disappointed. I hadn't eaten hamburgers in over 4 years because of my no red meat diet so I decided to give this place a shot after I started eating hamburgers again. When I tried my hamburger it honestly tasted like sewage. The smell of the meat made be gag and the only positive aspect to this place was the great tasting ketchup. I've had way better hamburgers at other places and for half the price. The only reason I give it 2 stars, instead of one because I'd be willing to try this place again because the day I went could have been a bad day for the kitchen.

6pm Arrival Valet Parking - 2.50 Seated immediately Wait Staff was extremely nice and helpful.  She asked us if it was our first time there (this was her spiel for everyone), recommended burgers for us.  I had the MANLY. My girlfriend had the Port & Stilton.  We enjoyed our burgers so much that we were heavily contemplating having a second round.  The burgers were not very big.  We could have easily scarfed down another round.  We decided to opt for dessert instead; delicious toffee/coffee ice cream sandwiches.  These are the Manny Pacquiao of burgers; A reigning Champion in a small package!  I'm going back in 2 days! It was the best $50 I've spent on dinner in a log time!

I just went back to Umami for round 2...ordered the pork burger AGAIN...couldn't pass that up.  We split it, and then ordered the Umami burger which the waiter said that the pork burger was 2nd to.  Personally, I think that nothing surpasses the pork burger.  I have yet to try the middle eastern lamb burger...that's next on the list, but the pork burger is the stuff that cravings are made of.  Still crazy juicy, crazy tasty, perfect bun, perfect toppings, and the perfect tempura onion rings that were perfectly salted. Will write again after round 3.

This is more like a 2.5 rating. Parking, as many others have mentioned, is available in a small adjacent parking lot but there is plenty of parking on La Brea and side streets.  No complaints. The food.  I began my meal with the pickles which is a small platter with a taste of 4 pickles:  carrot slivers, quartered mushrooms, a relish and several slices of green pickles.  I found a couple of these quite interesting [the carrots for instance] but not sure if I'd order this again.  Regardless, it was only $3.00. As the Triple Pork burger was sold out, I opted for the Pork and Stilton burger [$9.00].  The bun was soft and tasty, the meat flavorful and appeared to be chopped meat, tasty.  The problem though is that these burgers are either greasy or juicy ... let's say "juicy".   So much so that the bun is soggy even at the first bite.  I wondered if they even drain the burgers to avoid this problem. The Tempura Onion Rings at $2.50 were okay but, again, greasy.  The onion rings were stacked next to the burger, a Chinese soup spoon was placed on the plate with a couple of tablespoons of ketchup [I'm guessing homemade].  But I don't like ketchup at all, either on my burger or fries or onion rings.  This seems like a "purist" place so I was hesitant to ask for mayonnaise.  I would like to try the Eggplant Fries next time. In fact, as I look at the menu now I see that they mention "condiments" and name them at the bottom of the menu.  Just as they did not inquire as to how I'd like the meat cooked on my burger, they also did not ask if I wanted condiments. Service was attentive with 10 other diners there at the same time.  I liked the server but he seemed not familiar with some items.  Another gentleman came around and spoke briefly with each table.   I hesitate to call what they serve "burgers" and if I had a hankering for a hamburger, I would not come here.  The whole thing seemed like someone's vision or an experiment.  Not necessarily a bad, and maybe even a very good aspect.  I expect to come back for dinner to try burgers not listed on the lunch menu.

Had... Umami burger, diet coke from the Netherlands, onion rings, fries To the health-conscious people, this place is not for you. The burgers are definitely on the greasy juicy end, but hey, who wants a burger that's dry and tasteless (definitely not me!). We got their rather early, I think it was around 6pm or so.  We got seated pretty quick at the wrap-around counter thingy in the small room at the corner, but plenty of seats were available outside as well (it was kinda chilly that day though).  I don't care for the $2 valet, because $2 is rather cheap compared to some other places in Downtown or the Westside. Service was alright.  I think the owner had some family and friends in the same room we were in, and that was a bit annoying as they seemed to treat said room as a private banquet ish event, without concern for others (=us).  But that's almost a non-issue as we got outta there rather quick.  Server was cool, food came pretty quick, prices are fine ($10 burgers are fine to me...The Counter, Father's Office, etc. are in the same range anyway). The Umami burger was tender, juicy, cooked medium-ish.  I personally think the burger is a good size, and the burger and bun meshed well.  Fries were average at best, and the onion rings were basically Onion Tempura to me (being the Japanese person I am...) But overall, the food's pretty good.  If I were to rate the burger alone, I'd say this is the second-best burger I had in LA behind Blue Dahlia.  The Counter is a whole other experience as that's up to your creativity, but I like Umami better than Father's Office for sure.   I'd definitely give it another try when I'm in the area.

The best things come in small packages.  It definitely holds true for Umami Burger...burgers!  These little burgers are savory, juicy, and just a party in your mouth!  The only thing is...it's quite little...and when you're paying $10 bucks for like 5 bites, it kinda sucks.  (Yes, I'm a petite girl, but that doesn't mean petite burgers satisfy me.) I had the socal burger and it was awesome, as was the umami burger my bf had.  However, we were both veryyyyy disappointed with the fries!  We are fries lovers and they gave us unsalted, bland potato wedges.  Bleh.   My advice:  at $10/5 bites (or $2/1 bite), make Umami Burger more of a special every so often "treat."  I definitely can't afford this like I can afford In-n-out!

Burgers were Legit.  They were on point and delicious.   However, for some reason, I think that the best thing they had there were the Onion Rings...I was more suprised about the Onion Rings more-so than the Burger. Don't get me wrong...they were both great, and if I had either or of them in front of me right now, i'd make love to it. But on the serious note, I did not like their french fries.  Besides that, it was pretty cool that they allowed you to BYOB.  So we went across the street and grabbed some tall cans and bottles and brown bagged it on the side walk.  LEGIT!

I went here this evening with my dad.  I never realized how close this was to me!  Great burgers and the onion rings are a must.  The fries though are a failed attempt to be different.  I had the "Manly Burger" and it was pretty tastey, they use thick bacon and it happens to get stuck in your teeth and the don't provide toothpicks... bummer. I would give this place a 5 stars if it wasn't quite as expensive. Go here now.

Well, I did take my co-workers to Umami and not a single one liked it. I felt really bad actually. Everyone complained about how overpriced everything was for what they got. I was very upset this second time too. The service was really slow. The servers had no personality, well, except the guy who told me that their baked goods were made by monkeys. I'm sure Cake Monkey Bakery would be upset if they knew the Umami staff was falsifying their baked goods. The cool cups are no longer being used either! They switched to glass. Overall, everything I first liked about the place was opposite on my next visit. I guess the only constant was the flavor of the over-priced burgers. For that, I gave this review that second star!

The first time I went to UMAMI BURGER I was pleasantly surprised. I walked away full and chatting nonstop about the four different burgers our table had tried. I brought Umami up in conversation and urged friends to stop by. The second time -- not so much. "Overrated" sprung to mind. And with my own hype, no less. Hate it when that happens. We tried to order the pickle platter. I say "tried" because the conversation went somewhat like this (or exactly like this since I like to convey conversations verbatim): Us: We'd like the pickle platter. [Pointing to the table next to us who have just received one.] Them: Uh...we're not serving those right now. [We turn to and look at the platter at the table next to us.] Them: Yeah, I let them order those because they don't really eat anything else. [Uh, ok. Maybe they're vegans who wandered into a burger place?]...and we only have, like, three of them left. [Three servings? Three pickles? Unclear.] Ten minutes later as we get our sides, the table next to us gets their meat burgers, a side of fries and a side of onion rings. So, I guess they weren't vegans who couldn't eat anything else. Still unclear exactly what happened. But, let's say I look past that nonsensical incident. All the plates and bowls were chipped. Not just the one with the beet salad. All of them. The two bowls of fries, all three burger plates. In case you're counting -- that's 6 total. Tip to aspiring restaurateurs- get real plates before you open your second outpost. Seriously. I could go on, but then I'd have to get into the comments on the size of the burger, why we weren't ask how we wanted them cooked, blah, blah, blah. Who needs that? I think you've had enough. I have.

Umammmmmmmmmmmmmmi burger is mmm-mmmm, good.  Limited menu, meh atmosphere, but hey, when you're good at what you do, what more fluff do you need?  Delish burgers elicit mouth-watering dreams and the meat sweats - yes, I said it.  Heads up to guys that 1 burger is probably not quite enough, but 2 might be too much.  I suggest ordering an extra burger and splitting it, but that's just me and my bottomless stomach talking.   I will go back, oh yes, I will...

A true sign if I like a restaurant: I tell my parents about it. They're not quite foodies, but they love trying new and different things and take reccs from people all the time. I called my mom right away and said GET TO UMAMI - and let me know when you do since I'm down the street! My girlfriend and I went Monday after hearing good things about it (the bad: "that hipster place on LaBrea - Who the eff cares?). We were greeted and seated immediately - it wasn't packed at all, but that's probably because we went to dinner around 6:45pm. I ordered the Truffle Burger and was in heaven when, 8 minutes later, the plate arrived. DEEE-LISH! I never finish my food, and I left nothing on the plate. I even sopped up the juicy juices with my nearly-whole potato fries.   I can't wait to try the other offerings!

Classic bottle of coke [check] Oil drippin' onion rings [check] Succulent, juicy, meaty gourmet burgers [check] Greasy everything [check] Small portion, overpriced burgers [check] Slow service [check] Well, I have to say Umami Burgers might be a love & hate thing for me. I love how the truffle burger gave me a foodgasmic experience. The buttery soft fresh buns and meat-packing juicy succulent patty with a slice of cheese made it the best burger I've ever enjoyed in my life. But the best thing in life comes in a price of its own - $11 and Oh don't get me started on how greasy every single thing they serve here. The oil drippin from the buns, patties, and even onion rings was a major turn off. Prepare for extra napkins! Umami definitely brings a manly side of me to eat burgers like a real man! And I suggest every vegetarian not to get near this place as Umami Burger might swift your taste buds.

So I decided to bring my girlfriend to try this place out and I wanted to try some different items on the menu. Took lots of pictures this time so check out the pictures. I've never been here at night but I guess at night its valet only? They didn't charge us anything for valet and the guy was friendly so we tipped him well. He's also a frequent patron of Umami himself so if you're not sure what to order, talk to him before you go in since the waiters opinions are sometimes skewed. So the place was running at full capacity like usual and we were seated at the "bar". I understand that the place is little and they're trying to make use of the space as best as possible but the room is poorly lit compared to the rest of the restaurant, there is a table in the middle with the surround "bar" in a U shape around the middle table. We were seated right in the middle of the bar behind the middle table which made it extremely cramp being how we couldn't really move our chairs otherwise we would hit the people sitting at the middle table. The high chairs for the "bar" is a big TOO HIGH. Thankfully my thigh isn't that large but even still it was a squeeze to fit my legs under the "bar top". I must recommend to refuse to sit in here whether its busy or not. Anyway, on to the food. I ordered the Hatch Burger since I've recently been eating spicy food and the description just sounded tasty. Christina ordered the Truffle Burger being how she's a big fan of truffle. Unfortunately the Truffle Burger was a disappointment but since we decided to share halves of our burgers, Christina still had a decent experience. The Hatch Burger on the other hand is absolutely delicious and I will probably order that from now on. It was a little sweet, a little salty and packed a mild spice kick with it. For our sides, once again I ordered the Malt Liquor Tempura Onion Rings and their newly added Sweet Potato Fries. I guess last time I didn't have very many onion rings and didn't realize this but they are quite oily and once you've had a few it kind of makes you ill. Definitely something you want to share. Unfortunately Christina didn't really like it so she had half of one and the rest of the order was mine to finish. The sweet potato fries need a bit of work. Somewhat soggy, and not enough salt to give it that signature sweet/salty taste. Thankfully I love their Roasted Garlic Aioli so I dipped the fries in there which made it much better. Overall i think my opinion has changed quite a bit about this place from this past visit. The burgers are definitely good as long as you order the right thing. Service is impressive for a burger joint although average for a restaurant. Good thing we were already in the area doing something else prior otherwise making a trip to L.A. from Anaheim Hills just wouldn't have been worth the trip.

I've had the Umami, SoCal, Manly, and Turkey burgers on several occasions.  Consistency seems to be a recurring issue as with many of these "boutique" burger joints, but all in all, when done right and high price aside, it's good stuff. EDIT: I was very forgiving on the lack of consistency as I didn't think any burger joint could be exceptionally consistent.  Sadly, Stout has proved me wrong and I am revising my review for Umami down to three stars.

I love Umami Burger-La Brea. I've had the Umami Burger and the Truffle Burger from their menu. The Umami Burger was a bit salty for my taste but the Truffle Burger was heavenly. The malt liquor tempura onion rings are good but not the best fries/rings that I've ever had. They are a bit addicting however. A few cons: It's always busy. The right lane on La Brea is usually blocked with Umami Burger- directed traffic. It's small and usually very crowded. Mandatory valet. On the up side: I've always gotten Umami Burger-La Brea for takeout. It's easy to call in and then pick up your order. And they take Visa which is a plus that makes check out quicker. If you know the neighborhood, street parking around the corner is easy to find.

I had the Truffle burger, which was disappointing to me.  I didn't taste the truffles at all!  It tasted like a normal burger (a tad on the overdone side for my taste) with cheese.  I wish it had more flavor, and that the server asked me how I wanted my burger prepared.  I want my burgers medium-rare, not medium bordering well-done! The Umami burger on the other hand looked pretty interesting.  There was a hint of some Asian spice (anise?) which I didn't care for.   Overall, the burgers were ok, but not great.

As the name suggests, the only thing you can order here is a burger.  And I still haven't figured out what "umami" is, but it makes for a delicious, delicious burger.  This isn't a huge hunk of ground beef burger.  It's more gourmet, though definitely not dainty.  I'm also not sure if the burger is 100 percent beef, or a meat mix.  The burger is maybe a little oily, but if it is the bun soaks it up well enough so you don't mind. I ordered the Socal Burger, which was great with butter lettuce, spread and house made American cheese.  The other varieties looked just as good, and I had a hard time choosing.  The french fries, onion rings and the dipping sauces you can order with them (umami ketchup, roast garlic aioli, house spread, etc.) are also super tasty.   This place is popular, so the wait can be annoying.  But, it's  a fun, casual environment.  Nice beer selection too.  For what it does, I really want to give Umami five stars, but I haven't been to Father's Office or Golden State yet, so I think I need to hold out until I can do a proper comparison.

I'm not really a burger person, but if I have to eat one, I prefer gourmet burger over Mickey D's. I've tried Father's Office and I was not impressed, so I decided to give Umami Burger a try. I would have to say, it is better than the Father's Office in terms of taste, and the sweet potato fries are simply delish. The umami burger seems to have an Asian flavor to it, although unique, but still not good enough to deserve 4 stars. I have not tried their other burgers yet, maybe I'll change my opinion when I do.

There seems to be some expectations from a gourmet burger. Some are valid but the reviewers here expected to be blown away. Well, if you are particular (aka: picky) about what you want on a burger, go to Fuddruckers. There you have a plethora of toppings that you can overload your sandwich with. Much like 8 oz Burger Bar on Melrose, gourmet burgers are higher quality. The beef will have clean flavors (not gamey overcooked 'meat' patty ala McD's) and most other things will be homemade, like the ketchup. You don't need to have a refined palate to enjoy a good burger, but don't complain that it's pricey when they put shitake mushrooms instead of canned mushrooms in your food. To me I rather have something made fresh in house than settle for a frozen patty topped with Heinz and iceberg. To add, I'll probably go back and try the other items on the menu like the Manly burger or maybe the turkey burger. The Umami number was a little sweet for me (I don't like ketchup in my burgers) but the onion rings were right on the money. And their iced tea was really refreshing. Parking is easy when you go before 6pm. I had no problem finding a spot in the neighborhood, but then again Sunday afternoon does help.

YUMMM. Newly obsessed. Came here on a busy Friday night only 45 minutes before a LACMA screening, so we were pretty anxious to eat and run. In fact, given our faraway parking spot, we were worried we wouldn't make it! But I'm happy to let everyone know that our order was taken within 5 minutes of being seated, and our burgers served within 15 minutes - pretty good for a full restaurant, I think. I wish that we had more time to enjoy our meal - I had the truffle burger, and I don't know what was in it (mushrooms? some crunchy thing? I scarfed that ish down) but it was seriously droolworthy. It was perfectly juicy, and despite its small size, definitely got you full. I also tried the sweet potato fries, which were pretty good... though I'm biased towards The Counter fries. Definitely coming back soon to try more burger options with the Milk ice cream sandwiches... which, strangely enough, sound like a great combination.

Wow, $$$.   I appreciate the freshly grounded meat but the truffle burger and fries just didn't do it for me.  If the portions are small and the burger is bank, I expect it to taste phenomenal and it was nothing beyond okay.  The bun was nice and the truffle flavor was there but the burger just didn't shine... and I noticed that my friend's truffle burger was somewhat medium rare and mine was fairly well done; although this wasn't a big deal for me since it is a burger, preparation should have been more uniform especially considering the price tag. Nice concept and it may appease your senses but it wasn't enough to get me coming back for seconds.

3.5 stars more likely. Burgers are delicious but it wasn't something I would crave. The fries and onion rings were cooked with tempura batter which made it lighter than the usual fries. It is definitely something you should try at least once, but for the price I wouldn't go too often.

The burgers here are just fantastic. You get a very high quality burger experience for a modest $10. $10 sounds like a lot for a burger, but if you can appreciate the cookery that goes into this, as well as the taste then you will quickly realize that is a fair price to pay. I also am not a fan of well-done fries, but my closest friends are. I snuck a taste of my buddy's fries when we went here and changed my opinion on well done fries. Umami makes these triple-fried fries that are excellent. I would compare their consistency to that of fried yuca sticks you find at a Brazilian BBQ, except with a softer center. Brilliant food here.

Finally tried this place after living down the street from it for more than a year...and was pleasantly surprised. The burgers were juicy, with great condiments. I had the Earth burger and the patty was very moist. Loved the cheese and oven roasted tomatoes in the burger, and the buns were soft and fresh. My bf had the Umami burger, even though he thinks the Office burger is still better, this comes as a close second! We also had sweet potato fries, which had a certain sweetness to it that was very enticing. The only thing we would critic on was the fact that they didn't serve beer...I mean afterall it is a burger place, it should serve some kind of beer! Yeah, there are tons of soda to choose from...but that's just not the same. Overall would recommend it to others, and I would go back again. Decently priced too!

My favorite part of this restaurant is that they dont even ask you how you want your burger cooked. They cook the burger exactly medium rare, and if you want to murder the burger by getting it well done, they basically tell you to get the heck out of the restaurant. I was worried at first when I realized the waitress didnt even bother to ask me how i wanted my burger. But, I was just concerned for no reason cause the meat was top notch and they actually cook it exactly the way you would dream that a medium rare burger be cooked. The fries were just average but the onion rings were bomb. They call it tempura onion rings so it matches the japanese like name of Umami, but the beer in the batter is what really makes it so good. The decor and patio seeting for this place is bomb. If you are coming by yourself, they also have bar seating. Its not a legit bar like Father's Office, but it is a high chair with a countertop that is always open when they are busy.

How have I not reviewed Umami Burger? I really like the food here.  The burgers are great, and definitely unique compared to some of the other fancy burgers out there in this city.  The burgers are not huge, but they are rich and flavorful and will leave you satisfied.  Also, these onion rings are perhaps the best I've ever had.  Pretty decently priced I think, compared to the other pricey burger joints that have popped up around the LA area. The service and space is so-so. The biggest hassle:  parking.  Be ready to pay for valet, because street parking is a nightmare here.

Umami has great style, cheap cups, and great burgers. I loved their Hatch Burger it was yummy with the right amount of cheese and green peppers. I also got the try to the manly burger which was very similar to a regular burger that you may find in a Carl's Junior. Lastly, I ordered their sweet potato fries.  My favorite part about these fries were that they were sprinkled with cinnamon to give it a sweeter taste. Overall, I can definitely tell the difference between a fast food burger and a gourmet burger at Umami but the overall taste can be more exciting for such a small menu.

-Meat is tasty but if you like your meat medium well or well done, forget it.   -Small portions -For lunch, expect to spend $20 with tip just for yourself with drink and fries. -Atmosphere is ok. -Service is ok. Would I go back...prob not.

Um, in my humble opinion, this place serves some of the best burgers I've ever eaten. (But I'm not a huge burger eater, so just take my opinion as me saying that I think it's really really good). Maybe my hunger was also a factor in that - my two friends and I were running a little late for lunch and I had skipped breakfast and I was hunnnnngry! We were seated quite quickly, to my excitement. Between the three of us, we each ordered a different one (Umami Burger, Manly Burger, Truffle Burger) so we could all try a little of each. Oh my gosh soooo yummy!!!!! I loved the bread and I especially loved that the patty, which was quite a generous size, was cooked medium rare instead of well done so the meat was juicy. The bread was soft and the different ingredients in each of the burgers added even more to the deliciousness, such as the parmesan crisp in the umami burger. I would definitely recommend this place and return whenever I'm in the LA area and looking for a nice sit-down place for a quick and yummy meal. Heheheheh the Umami Burger looks like those lipstick kisses injected with Botox. :P

My sister was telling me that Umami burgers was one of the places she intended to try. So when I was in the area with my boyfriend we decided to stop by. We were hungry and eager to try this joint especially because the place was packed! After being seated, we decided to order their... salad with beet dressing- nice and light and not too sweet umami burger- which was good but too sweet for my taste so cal burger- which was divine and juicy! thin cut fries-  they were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, just the way i like 'em cheese tater tots- which i still can't stop thinking about! it's a must get kinda thing! and you just have to dip it in their garlic aioli  sauce! and i also ordered their cappuccino which i also enjoyed! I love this place. It's not your typical greasy burger joint. The quality of their burgers is obvious. Even their buns are fresh and delicious. You just have to try this place out! By the way, the service there is excellent also! Very friendly and helpful if you have any questions about the menu! With such great service and food, you just can't go wrong here.

I was a little (ok, a LOT) late jumping on the Umami-train.  But I finally got around to trying it last night.....and good lawd, I am so happy I did. VERDICT:  yes, yes, yes, and YES (said in a Harry Met Sally kinda way). Let's discuss in detail... + HEIRLOOM TOMATO / BURRATA / ARUGULA SALAD which was placed atop delicious corn pudding:  It was flavorful and very good. The salad had the right amount of dressing, there was a good amount of burrata, the tomatoes were juicy and the corn pudding was sweet. Not holy hell good, but very, very good. + TRUFFLE BURGER: The bun was incredibly soft, the meat was thick and juicy, the cheese was oozy / gooey / yummy, and the burger was just bursting with truffle flavor.  I could've eaten two, but i didn't want to scare my dinner date (who eats like a bird) or the people around me. Plus, I wanted to not hate myself the next day (which I did anyway). + CHEEZY TATER TOTS: (special of the day) - I imagined the cheezy tater tots to be a bit cheezier, and a bit more reminiscent of the tater tots from grade school in terms of texture and shape - so I was (slightly) disappointed....but not enough to keep me from throwing them down like tic tacs. + TEMPURA ONION RINGS: Fab. Just the way I like them - juicy, cut thick, with a chewy/crunchy tempura batter.  Then again, you could tempura batter my gym sneaker and I'd probably think it was a culinary masterpiece. I was sad to discover there was no alcohol at this location - and apparently the beer / wine selection featured in the online menu is specific to the Hollywood location.  Sigh.  So, to fill my beer/wine void, we proceeded to order the... + SALTED CARAMEL ICE CREAM SANDWICH:  I'm not a huge fan of ice cream, but I managed to down my half of the ice cream sandwich in 2.5 seconds.  I wasn't a huge fan of the salted caramel (wish I had gotten the vanilla bean or mint chip instead) but the French macaron cookie crust that sandwiches the ice cream was chewy, sweet and divine.

Don't judge me for being a woman as I eat the Manly Burger (medium rare, please).  SO good - I was expecting an over hyped burger, but everything about it...well except that it got a lil soggy near the end...was goooood.  I had to de-masculinize (is that a term?) my burger by adding some oh-so-yummy sweet potato fries.  I think they added some sort of cinnamon sugar, cuz it tasted like a carnival in my mouth!  The ketchup was different too...not sure what it was, but I'm not complaining :) Gotta go back and try a different burger!

Not bad, but still ranks behind 25 Degrees, The Bowery, and The Counter. Had the Manly Burger, and it wasn't bad -- it was cooked to the right temp, the onion straws weren't bad, and the cheese was nice and gooey, but if it wasn't for the bacon, it would be just your run of the mill cheese burger; Good and forgettable.  That bacon lardon though is AMAZING!  I'd almost take that over the burger. My girlfriend had the Umami Burger, which she felt was just OK.  The bite I had was good, but nothing that stuck out and said "Wow! this is a damn good burger!" We each got a side item: I had the onion rings and she had the hand cut fries.  The onion rings were hovering on the average bar.  Very, very oily, and not real crispy.  The hand cut fries were really good - nice and thick, and perfectly salted. The place is pretty quaint, but has a nice friendly vibe.  Our waiter was courteous, friendly and right on top of things. Didn't do anything to make me avoid the place, but wasn't anything that begged me to come back.

On my quest to try every burger possible and the road has lead me to Umami Burger. Let's begin with the fact that the La Brea location does not serve beer. No negative stars earned but it would have been nice to enjoy a frosty beer with the burger. It was a very good burger but very much over hyped and too much buzzed. We started with the House Pickles. It was a sampler platter of 2 different pickles, pickled carrots, pickled mushrooms, pickled beets and a pickled pepper. My personal preference is for salty pickling and these were all sweet pickles so really not to my palette. The pickled chili pepper was really good, not hot due to the sweet pickling but good. Next I had the original Umami Burger. Good burger topped with roasted tomatoes, mushrooms, parmesan cheese and secret sauce. So again, it was good but way too over hyped! At $10 fairly priced but don't go into it thinking it's a mind blowing burger. It's really just a good hamburger with some "Asian" flavoring due to the mushrooms and seasonings. We also enjoyed the hand cut fries and the sweet potatoes fries. Both of them were good but nothing standout. Their ketchup, which note, I'm a mustard fan not a ketchup fan, but it was super sweet and I really enjoyed it. Finally, I have to say I found a stand out on the menu. The ice cream cookies!!! I had the coffee/toffee flavor. The ice cream was rich flavored, milky and not overly frozen. The cookie was awesome! Slightly crunchy but sort of candy sticky once you bit into it. Really great! Make sure to save room for one! Service was perfect and no issues there.

I went there around 2p.m. on Sunday.  It wasn't hard to find a parking on a street.  We had to wait for 10 minutes to get seated, but once we sat down, everything went pretty fast. I ordered Umami burger and onion rings, and my husband ordered Port & Stilton burger and thin fries.  (Sweet potato fries  were sold out!!)  I loved my onion rings!!  Umami ketchup came with it and it is really good as well! His fries were just ordinary fries with too much salt. Flavors of both hamburgers were pretty good, but one thing it bothered me was that patty was too undercooked for me.  I almost felt like eating raw meat.  Is it safe to eat for me as a pregnant woman?

The first few bites of the burger were great, but then the patty and crunchy cheese got a little soggy and everything just kind of blended together. Sweet potato fries were yummy but the garlie aioli dipping sauce was a little bland for me. The fries were cooked to the perfect consistency though. Service was a little lackluster. Felt a little neglected on the back patio, despite how cozy it was to sit there.

Parking: Street parking or valet.  Parking permit is required if your looking for street parking. Food: I had the umami burger with thick cut fries.  The burger is about the size of your palm, not very big.  On a toasted bun with beef patty, cheese, tomato, parm crisp.  bacon, caramelized onions, and mushrooms. The beef was great.  Nice and juicy and cooked to medium rare.  The parm crisp was unique.  It gave it a crisp texture.  The unami flavor was present.     Unami means tasty.  To me, tasty means out of this world.  The ingredients were there, but the taste was not.  Don't get me wrong, it does taste good but something was lacking.  The burger was sitting in grease, which i'm not a fan of.   The thick fries were not very good.  The surface had a slight crispness to them but the inside was mushy.  They need to be cooking just a lil longer.  Forget about the sauces.  None of the sauces were inspiring.  The ketchup had a slight vinegar taste to them.  Regular ketchup would have been better. Service:  Quick and fast.   I would recommend that you at least try this place once.  It is better than 5guys.  My friends would recommend the other burgers over the umami burger.

The portabello mushroom "burger" is the best thing ever! I'm vegan, but I even cheated and left that lacy, crispy cheese thing on the burger. As I said to my fella as we were eating "if my taste buds could have sex, this would be it..." The sweet potato fries and inion rings were just ok and I'm sad that this umami outpost doesn't have a liquor license, but the burger ALWAYS more than makes up for it!

Yum! I ordered their signature Umami Burger, and it was FIVE stars! Though the burger was SMALL for $10 and didn't fill me up, taste wise it was perfect. Very good, juicy, cooked perfectly and the cheese was very yummy.  The side of fries and dipping sauce were equally good.   So why 3 stars and not 5? What kind of burger joint doesn't serve beer?? When I pointed to the displayed bottles to inquire I was told they sold fancy soda. I thought he was joking, but he wasn't.   Buzz kill!!  It would have been perfect to wash down the delicious burger with a cold beer.   Service was... ok.  The restaurant was empty and they attempted to squeeze the 3 of us on to a two top facing the wall.  We asked to be moved to a 4 top and they were nice about it ("you mean you don't want to face the wall? haha....")  ... It's a super small joint so I guess they try to save their 4 tops?  Either way... it was awkward. We asked if we could do a half order of regular fries and half order of sweet potato fries, and they wouldn't accommodate this.  O well! Not a big deal. $3 for valet when the plaza was dead.  Valet would have been worth it if I was going to chill out over some drinks... but we were there maybe 30 minutes. The lack of alcohol was the killer for me.   Maybe I will find the other location that isn't 1) dead 2) serves beer.  Otherwise I would have returned.  Burgers rocked though.

The umami burger was delicious.  Tiny, yet one of the best burgers I've had.  It's the size of an In-N-Out burger, but taller.  $9.  That's almost 5 In-N-Out cheeseburgers.  I would actually feel better if the price tag was actually a few bucks more and the burger was bigger because then I'd feel like I actually had a meal as oppose to a snack.  Sweet potato fries were good, but they only let you choose 1 condiment or something like that.  We didn't even know that because the waiter didn't bother asking us what we wanted.  Because we had 2 orders of fries, he just  brought us a bottle of ketchup and 2 spoons of aioli.  I thought the spoons were ultra stingy of them cause it doesn't hold a lot of sauce and I wouldn't want to pay an extra charge just to get more sauce..  The ketchup was yummy, it didn't taste like your regular ketchup. This place is casual and kinda small.  You can't see it on the street because there isn't a storefront.  But there is a billboard with an arrow pointing down to where it is.

Umami Burger ruined me for life, as far as burgers go.   I understand all the complaints about service not asking you about the condiments, the burgers being on the small side, parking, wait time, running out of certain items (like the Cheesy Tots), etc.  These things do peeve me until I start shoving the burger into my face, then everything else becomes irrelevant. Umami gets 5 stars because my burgers now must be dripping blood or else I can't eat it.  Sick but true.  The bars have risen, and that's thanks to Umami burger. FYI: You can ask Umami to cook the burgers well-done, but I like to ask for mine to be medium rare (aka rare).  For vegetarians out there, go somewhere else or the Umami on Hollywood has tasty veggie burgers (according to my friend - I wouldn't know anything about that).

I've been dying to try to place for a long time.  Everyone that I've talked to raves about Umami, and you see that crazed look in their eyes.  I mean, how much more convincing do I need when friends have a crazy look of "must have Umami burger" in their eyes.   I arrived with some friends on a Friday night and waited for our table.  It was a decent wait, not too long.  Our waiter was super nice ... BUT he was screwing things up left and right.   1) 2 out of 3 of us got our burgers (triple pork and truffle).  Waiting .... waiting ...  staring at the burger getting cold. Cheese starting to harden, juices dripping from the burger no longer have that "this is friggen tasty" appeal.  We finally had to stop him and ask for the 3rd order.   After walking away from us you can hear the server and the food delivery guy debating over how to write the ticket and that is why the food was not at our table. 2) Upon receiving the 3rd burger (umami), we reminded the server that we had ordered 4 sides. btw -- i'm a really slow eater and my friends are fast 3)  half through my burger, 1 side arrived (smushed potatoes) 4) 3/4 through my burger, the 2nd side arrives (onion rings).  We have to remind the server again that we ordered 5 condiments.  That actually came fast. 5) with only 2 bites left, we get the last 2 sides (thin fries and sweet potato fries). This was friendliest, confused, annoying server ever.  He's lucky he was so nice or we may have went to town on him. 6) we get our bill and it has 2 extra burgers that we never ordered!  Really ... are you going to seriously screw every part of our umami experience? 7) valet brings my car around and it smells like cigarettes!!!  that was really annoying.  i doubt the guy smoked in my car, I really hope he didn't, but who knows because my car was parked around the corner on the street. maybe he smoked on the way to my car, but c'mon ... smoke travels and embeds itself into spaces and materials, I get it, but don't bring it into MY car! As for the food, I had a taste of my friend's burgers.  I have to say I love the triple pork most, it is really good, very juicy, and full of flavor.  A few extra leaves of butter lettuce would be nice.  The smushed potatoes were ok as were the onion rings, but my friend loved it.  The batter was light and tasty, but i don't care for the thicker rings.  Thin fries, nothing special. Sweet potato fries, I think they add cinnamon after it's out of the fryer, so it's a tad sweeter than we were use to, not bad.  Over all, I wouldn't particularly crave the sides, they are good, but not a must have or I'll die emotion to it.   Condiments, we ordered:  Umami ketchup (sweet, ok), house spread (spicy!!  doesn't hit hard, lingers a long time), kombu relish (we all agreed that it was 1000 island with pickeled seaweed), jalapeno ranch (good), and garlic aioli (good). Will I return?  Maybe.  I'll probably try a different location. Will I crave it?  Probably not Did I enjoy the food?  Sure, but not head over heels for it.  Perhaps it was the bad service that accompanied the food.

I came here yesterday with my friends and I wasn't completely mind blown honestly. I guess you would say that this place is definitely overrated. I mean it's not nasty...it's just okay. I would just say that its weird how this place is designed to be like a semi-fancy restaurant. Honestly it was just weird when they give such a large plate for one burger I got. There was so many empty space around the burger that I don't see where they are trying to go with this. Anyway I tried the Umami burger and i also get to try the onions rings,sweet potato fries, fries , and the double fried potato(i forgot the name). The burger was okay. It didn't exactly ruined my life that I can't eat any other burgers anymore. It's definitely different but I won't say its the best burger i have tried. I like how there is the shitake mushroom inside the burger along with the nice little chip. The meat was cooked at medium rare and it was pretty good and you can tell that the quality of the meat is legit. Personally though, I would like my burger to be a bit more hot and maybe that would help make it more delicious. Out of all the appetizers, I would say I love the sweet potato fries and the double fried potato. The tempura-oil onion rings was honestly nothing special and its mostly just powder. The fries are fries...you don't expect them to be WHOA THIS IS SOOO GOOD...so its up to you if you want to come here and get the fries. Anyway I really like the double fried potato because it was delicious. It was hot and the taste was perfect. I liked it a lot. The sweet potato fries was a bit different because they added cinnamon on top of it and I literally wanted to lick the whole plate because it went along with it perfectly.

If you're in the mood for a burger that's more glammed up than your average meat, lettuce, & bun usual then Umami is the place to go.  Actually, if you're in the mood for any type of burger, Umami is the place to go.  You won't be disappointed with their delectable creations and oh-so-juicy burgers.  The burgers are creative, the ingredients fresh, and the flavors really POP in your mouth (at least they pop pop in mine!).   I usually get their signature Umami burger and I love the usage of the parmesan/cheddar(?) tuile instead of your average joe slice of cheese.  I've also tried their Socal burger, which is the closest thing to a regular burger, but this one is at least ten times better.  The bf has gotten the Port & Stilton and Hatch burgers and prefers the Hatch. Although the burgers are the perfect size for me, the bf feels the need to get two, which can get pretty pricey when all we wanted was a low key burger dinner.   Umami is definitely unique in what they offer and this can even be seen in their sauces, which are made from scratch.  I'm not a fan of their ketchup, which I think tastes too much like a weak marinara sauce, but I like that they make it themselves.  The garlic aioli, on the other hand, I can dip just about anything in.  I've also tried their triple-cooked hand cut fries, sweet potato fries, malt liquor tempura onion rings, and market salad.  I think the triple-cooked fries should have stopped being cooked the second time around because they seem too well done and I'm not a crazy fan of their tempura onion rings either because I feel that there is just too much batter on them.  However, the sweet potato fries and salad were tasty in my opinion.   I always end my meals with the Cake Monkey desserts that they offer and they are so good.  The Li'l Merri's, which is an oatmeal cream pie sandwich cookie filled with maple vanilla buttercream, is like crack (not that I know what actual crack is like, but I can imagine that the delicious sugar high I get from these cookies come close to it)!  I also treat myself to the Peanut Butter & Marshmallow Cakewich, which is a yellow cake sandwich filled with peanut buttercream and marshmallow, and then coated with bittersweet chocolate.  Ahh, p-nut buttaaa melt-in-my-mouth deliciousnesssssssss.   Even though I love their burgers and desserts, I can't give them any more than 4 stars due to the steep prices, small portions, so-so service, tight seating, and the fact that it's valet parking.

I came here with a friend because she said it was Justin Timberlake's favorite burger place and supposedly it had really good reviews. There was a long line and wait to be seated. This got us pretty excited. My friend and I both ordered the umami burger and sweet potato fries. The burgers were juicy, but also VERY oily. It did not live up to the hype because they seemed very plain. After we left, my friend's stomach started hurting from the burger. I don't know, overall it was just it wasn't what I expected. I don't get the hype, but I guess it was good to experience. The interior design was cute and had cute plastic cups - which we took with us because they were cute! Just a little too pricey for what it's worth.....

I resisted typing this review so early because my fingers were so greased up. It was a wait to get seated a wait to get our food. Like really a wait. We pretty much had to set aside 2.5 hours for this experience.The signature burger was disappointing. it was a bit more savory but then what else was there. I dont usually like any tomatoes but the sundried tomato saved this burger. And they didnt really ask us how our burger is to be cooked which i found it really weird. I wish i had tried the other burgers because maybe this is why it gets bad reviews. just change the signature burger. duhhh The onion rings were lacking. Like it was lacking a few rings. and the sweet potato fries were mushy. Our sauces came in plastic containers that i couldnt even fit my onion ring into. Will n I were disappointed in this experience but really. C'mon. Imma drive 80 miles to Back Abbey at this rate. Til next time Umami Burger. I must try the truffle.

DISCLAIMER: The food is worth 4 stars, but the service easily negates this down to below 1 star if I could give this review such a rating. I won't take the time to harp too much praise on the quality and taste of the burgers and sides at Umami Burger. It obviously has the number of reviews on Yelp that it does for a good reason. My personal favorite is the Truffle Burger with some Beer Battered Onion Rings with their Garlic Aioli and top it off with a Mexican Coke Vanilla Float. BUT, aside from this, I find it more and more compelling to visit this establishment less and less. The reason being the absolutely atrocious and unprofessional service that seems to be a recurring theme amongst numerous "employees" / uneducated 3rd grade drop outs. On several occasions when I have decided to place a take-out order to avoid the wait for a table, I have encountered incredible sloth and laziness from the cashier. If you don't pay with card and use cash, the cashier may shortchange you. One blonde petite girl in one instance, and one brunette Latina another instance opted not to give me my full change on a takeout order. Granted, I am not on food stamps and am not pan handling outside Umami to make ends meet. But maybe some Umami employees are or should consider it! Regardless, it is simply unprofessional and irritating to give a customer a self-righteous scoff at why they are requesting their full change. Whether it is a dime one time or a full $0.64 cents the other time, it is not up to the fucking math-failing dropout to determine what the customer is or is not willing to look past. It ain't goin in your tip jar, that's for sure sunshine. Nickel and diming customers in front of their face is hugely rude and to top it off, asking the question, "You really want that dime?" is a blatant slap to the face of customer appreciation. I don't fucking care if it was a god damn penny, if you have the audacity to throw a $10 bill in change on a $40 tender off $29.90, and claim you "don't have that dime for you" then I'm going to call you out. It's a matter of taking a key and opening a register. Get off your ass and do your god damn job which is 1) serve me my food 2) shut the fuck up 3) smile I have not been a patron of the other Umami locations, but the one on La Brea seems to have spotty (a generous adjective) customer service.

LOVE their burgers. Went there around 1pm on a Sunday and there was no wait. I ordered the Umami Burger and it was definitely the tastiest burger I have ever had! I also tried the Hatch Burger and it was as yummy and juicy as the Umami Burger but with a spicy kick. The sweet potato fries were good too! Kind of pricey for burgers but definitely worth it!

Truffle burger FTW! This is by far the BEST burger I've had so far. Also ordered a side of the Roasted garlic aioli to mix with ketchup as a dip for the thin fries. They lose a star bc we came around 4pm on a Sunday. There wasn't a line yet we were directed to wait at the bar to be seated. We ordered a beer and a glass of wine which totaled $15 and observed all the empty tables yet we still had to wait to be seated. Total for truffle burger and fries was $17

oh yum! Totally my fav burger joint in LA. Since coming here, I've hit up Father's Office and the Counter. Nothing compares to the Port n' Stilton burger with a side of sweet potato fries (garlic aioli sauce please!). That really is the ideal meal here. This last time, I thought I'd try the Truffle Burger, which was fairly good. Still no port n' stilton, but it was decent. B/f got the Triple Pork (he thought it was ok, but I liked it). We did get our sweet potato fries that had their brown sugar, which was still tasty. We saw cheesy tots on their special menu, though, and had to try. HUMONGOUS tator tots, filled with cheese. mmmmm! They went pretty well with the jalapeno ranch OR the garlic aioli (or just alone).  All in all a great experience. And although the burger seems small, that will fill you plenty. (I actually thought they seemed bigger this time... so maybe I remember wrong?). Either way, I always come away happy. I love Umami!

An absolutely amazing burger! BETTER than In-n-out, Shake Shack and 5 guys. But then at a 9 dollar price, it should be better.  Go for the burger than comes with a parmesan crisp. The fries are uniformly excellent as are the onion rings.

a few weeks ago, i came here to eat lunch with the boyfriend. when we got there we noticed there was a huge crowd, but once we entered we were seated right away. we ordered the tempura onion rings, sweet potato fries, and we split the Port and Stilton burger since they were all listed under the highlight review section on yelp. okay i thought father's office sweet potato fries were good, but umami is even better! they were nice and crispy with either brown sugar or some kind of sugar on it but anywhoooo... it was SOOOOO good. i get the craving for it once in awhile. their tempura onion rings were really good too! the price is pretty reasonable for the amount of food you get. as for the burger, it was tender and melted in your mouth except the blue cheese was VERY overwhelming. i love blue cheese, but there was too much in this burger. i'd come here again, but order a different burger.

Three of us ate dinner here and we all had somewhat different impressions.   I ordered the chorizo burger and wasn't really feeling it.  The .gif ordered a turkey burger (the non-spicy one) and thought it was the best turkey burger she had ever had- she was admittedly starving though. The sweet potato fries were flavorful- I think I detected some pumpkin pie spices in there.  We also ordered thick cut fries (a special,) that looked cool but were way too salty.  I LOVED the Umami ketchup, but like everything else, they were pretty tight-fisted with it, even going so far as to charge you if you want more than the 2 or so tablespoons you get per side. For $10+ a burger  I expect to get more than just a (somewhat small) burger by itself on a plate.  Give me SOMETHING- a pickle on the side maybe!?  Somehow for three bugers, three sodas, and two orders of fries we spent over $60 and I felt ripped off.

First of all, i'd like to say i'm pretty critical about burgers. So to say that I thoroughly enjoyed my burger here is damn good. Amazing. The entire experience was truely a treat! I came here with about 10 friends, this location is a tad small (only because it was the first of its kind) but they accommodated us pretty quick and as best as they could. The servers were very acknowledging of our needs and went above and beyond our expectations by getting us a sample of all of their signature condiments. My favorite condiments were the jalapeno ranch and diablo sauce. I got the Firebird which was a very delicious spicy turkey burger with their diablo sauce. DELISH. If you like spicy, you'll love that burger. Everyone else seemed to love their truffle burger. My boyfriend got the umami burger, and it wasn't as good as the truffle burger. One thing people need to understand about umami is that these types of burgers are definitely to stimulate the sense of taste. You have to savor these burgers. And every bite is truely AMAZING. we also got to try their cheese tator tots, tempura onion rings, smush potatoes, and truffle fries, they were all delicious appetizers! All in all, great experience.  I would definitely come back =)

Look at the photo I just posted.  My burger today was RAW!   After many attempts at trying to achieve the same greatness I got the first time I tried the truffle burger... I throw my hat in.   One time I went there and the burger was burnt, the next too salty, the next it was RAW.  I'm not a vampire. Thanks Cole for the credit back to my card.  My dogs did enjoy the meat.

Okay,we went to this place a couple days ago with a friend visiting from out of town.  To be honest we went there to eat Korean Tacos, the place it used to be but I guess they closed down.  We were going to leave but we decided to stay and try them out.  The hospitality was a top 10 and the 2 guys, I believe the owners were very informative about which burger was the best and what was in it to the smallest detail, my mouth salavates just thinking about it... lol.    I gotta say I was pleasantly shocked by my burger!  I'm not a major burger conneseaur but HOLY COW (no pun intended)  it was the best burger I have EVER had!  It's a premium burger in every sense and the price is very affordable.  I would say $9 to $11 a burger.  We're not talking Carl's Jr folks! If your'e looking for a great place, GREAT food, a great vibe and friendly staff, this is the place to check out.  Also, did I mention is BYOB????  What the heck!  That's awesome!  My goal is to try every burger there.  I would reccomend grab a 12 pack or a couple bottles of wine and a party of 5 and head there for dinner.  I went there during the day but it would be a fun place to have dinner and drinks before heading out to party!

I'm a bit obsessed with finding a good burger (I even have a burger club that meets regularly to sample burgers everywhere) so it was with much anticipation that I headed to Umami. My verdict is that the burger was decent, especially the patty, but the bun could be better. My biggest complaint is that the sides were a huge let-down. The skimpy portioned fries, onion rings and sweet potato chips all fell FLAT. The patty was perfectly cooked medium rare and had the right texture (good toppings too) but alas, the bread and disappointing sides made it merely an above-average -- not great -- burger experience. I still think Houston's has the best burger (the CA burger with arugula, avocado and red onions) even though I haven't found a place in LA that has a great burger AND fries. I go to French bistros for fantastic fries. I would go early for dinner because a line starts forming around 7:30-8. Maybe it was the JGold effect. I'd return but it needs to work on the sides big time. And what's with corkage fee? Fix at Silver Lake doesn't do that?! Or at least didn't when I went a few months ago. here's a full review w/photos: http://njeats.blogspot.c…

Just to clarify an earlier comment, it's the Port & Stilton Burger, not Pork & Stilton. On my visit, this is what I ate and I've been thinking about it for the past week. It was perfectly prepared (although hard to say if they're consistent based on some reviews I've read) and I enjoyed my last bite as much as my first. I'm hoping to be back soon, but hoping more that the skinny a-hole waiter with the stick up his a$$ is gone when I get there. Please fire him.

The umami burger was solid. There was another burger with bleu cheese. Or blue cheese. Regardless, there was too much of it. This other burger had peppers on it? Jalapenos, maybe. It was good, too. But I'd only get the umami burger again. They had fat fries and this interesting ketchup. But you only get like, five fries per order. Disappointing. I got the onion rings because the menu said they had malt liquor in them. Mickey's, they claim. I couldn't taste it. (That's either a good or a bad thing. For a man such as myself, it's a bad thing.) Mexican coke. Ice cream sandwich was wack. I'd go back again, but I wouldn't go out of my way. The umami burger is worth trying.

That is a tasty burger. Had the port and stilton burger for lunch today. The bun is steamed, the onions are not too sweet, the stilton gives that nice blue cheese bite to round out the flavor and the meat is beefalicious. Will have to come back in evening to try daily special burgers including scallop and tuna. Also want to return with some byob and enjoy a tasty burger with some craft beers or wine, it's like a homemade happy hour, if only they could add a TV with some games to watch.

My brother in law took us here last week and I have been craving it everyday after that.  It is hands down the best $9 burger I have ever tasted...Period. It literally melts in your mouth and so very flavorful.  The burger is on the med-rare side so if you cant handle red in your burger, let them know. I enjoyed their onion rings alot more than the fries and their sauce is great too.  This place is pretty far away from me (thank God because I would go here everyday and they would have to pick me off the floor when I have a heart attack) but I would go here if I wanted a really good Burger. Their service is an A as well.  The only thing I would complain about would be the portions of side orders are a bit too small in my opinion. (Come on guys...6 fries is just ridiculous)

It was a good burger. I got the Umami burger which was great. The size unfortunately was a bit on the small side. It seems like a dainty delicate type restaurant the manly burger my friend order was good too, but again it took him like 15 secs to finish it lol. I'm a big guy so it's understandable but just a forewarning about the size. The burger itself is very flavorful extremely tasty i sorta wish the seating arrangement was better because it's really tight in there as well. I sat outside next to the busy La brea street. The service was on sub-par. We walked in and they were like staring at us but didn't really say anything we started pointing and asking if it was cool for us to take these seats etc.. and we kinda got a response but it was kinda snooty. But it wasn't downright horrible service just short and not sweet. Anyways this is my 2nd place in top burgers in L.A. 25 degrees Umami The Counter fat burger Update!! As of now all the matadors changed to umami? so now there is 1 next to my pad on sunset and vermont. It's a lot better not as tight spaced and the service a lot better! The size of portion still a bit on the small size so I keep the 4 stars . But it is delicious!

The best thing here are the onions rings. They are the lightest, crispiest rings you'll ever have. The fries are in the Belgian style. They are crispy, but kinda dense. Still, they are very good. (Though I wish the serving was big enough to share.) They offer Coke with real sugar. They've thought of everything. Now the burgers... they are excellent. The size is perfect with the right amount of bun (brioche in this case). The default is to get it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. It's different from other burgers because of the heavy Umami focus, but you'll appreciate the originality. Parking sucks and it gets crowded. The service didn't go out of their way to check on us, but it was very efficient.

Honestly, I'm not a huge burger eatin' girl. I like a good burger but I just have to be in the mood to dig into some ground beef. This burger was so juicy and the layers of the burgers melted perfectly into one another. I hate it when a burger is mindless filled with ingredients that don't really make sense texturally or taste-urally (sorry I couldn't think of the word). I don't want soggy lettuce and a bunch of condiments and veggies crammed into my burger! Anyway, the point is, Umami doesn't do that. They are super aware of each layer and how it affects your tastebuds. All I know is this: it tastes very good. I'm not a fan of thick cut fries but these are very crispy and interesting. Would still rather have in-n-out or McDonald's fries (sorry, I'm gross).

Friends and I hit up Umami's the weekend of July 4th. Perhaps, that's why there was relatively no wait for us to get a table. I figured most everyone already got their fill of burgers. Lucky us~ I love burgers. Not just any burgers, but GOURMET burgers. Hm. Actually, I like McDonald's burgers too. Ok. I LIKE ALL BURGERS. And Umami has got some tasty ones. Friend and I split 3 burgers. Truffle burger was the best. There was a great taste to them. The Hatch burger was our second favorite. We like our food spicy. And then the Umami burger came in 3rd. 2 things surprised me. 1 - they grind their own meat in the kitchen. You can see them grinding away right past the curtains to the kitchen. 2. The portions are a little on the small side... therefore my friend and I had to split 3 of them instead of 2. The fries are great (although, again sort of on the small portion side). Friend's onion rings also looked great (again small portion). But! In the age of "Supersize me", diabetes, childhood obesity, maybe the smaller portion is fine. The burgers are generally served medium rare. We asked for them medium and thought they were perfect. Still juicy, tender and scrumptious. Oh yummo. They also had amazing desserts -- good ice cream sandwiches and some red velvet dingdong looking thing. Food = B+ (strictly a burger joint) Staff = B Environment = C (on the too small side) Overall = B A must eat place for burger folks.

I was visiting LA, and my friend decided to take me out and eat.  He recommended that we come here and try their burgers because he said they were REALLLY good.  There were three of us. When we got in there, the place seemed a little too dim for my liking, especially because it was the afternoon...I like it nice and bright. The menu isn't very big, probably about 8-10 different burgers and a few sides.  I am used to a wide selection of food, so when I saw that there weren't that many choices, I was a bit disappointed. My friend who lives in LA has tried if not all, almost all the burgers and he knew what to recommend and he already knew what he was going to order.  My other friend and I decided to order two different burgers and split it so we can get a taste of both burgers! I ordered the PORT AND STILTON BURGER and my friend ordered the TRUFFLE BURGER.  I wanted a regular arnold palmer, but they didn't have it and so the waiter recommended the GREEN TEA ARNOLD PALMER. When my drink came out, I tried it and I didn't really like it maybe because I was not used to having GREEN tea mixed with lemonade. THEN...our burgers came out, and i thought to myself "Where's the lettuce, tomatoes and pickles that usually come with the burger." At that point I did not understand how this burger place could be ALL THAT GOOD. BUT when I took a bite into the burger...I REALIZEDDD... we didn't need all the other stuff because the burger was perfect the way it was.  The meat was cooked medium and was full of flavor. It was juicy, fresh, flavorful and filling.  I enjoyed both the burgers but I liked the PORT AND STILTON more. They also serve their sides in cute little bowls with spoons filled with katchup.  It was presented very nicely. I would definitely recommend others to give it a shot and go there again when I have the chance.  SERIOUSLY one of the BEST burgers I've had!!!! YUMMMM

So on Thrusday Nites, I roll with my buddies to try different restaurants every single week. We roll up to this place with 5 guys tightly packed in this 2 door Honda Accord and see this massive line of people waiting outside like it was the Max on Saved by The Bell... We went inside and decided to sit at the "bar" because the wait was like 15 hours and no wait for the "bar"... If I waited that long, my pubes would have turned gray... too late. Their "bar" was located in this little room that sits on the left side of this already small ass restaurant... If the room was any smaller, I would be able to better understand how my family members came to the United States in a boat and a truck. All of us ordered the Umami burger and waited for about 10 hrs to get it.. bastards. We waited some more and the waiter comes with our burgers... we examined them, nod, and dig in. After that... I heard the largest explosion of genitalia. The burger was F*ckin' AWESOME! The only down side to this burger is how small it was... looked liked an older brother of the mini sirloin burger.... but the meat was cooked well. I wonder what they marinate the meat in... perhaps a stick of butter, spices, and young children. What Sucked: Wait time for small ass burgers french fries (I understand it suppose to be trendy and gourmet... but I think I got a total of like 5 fries and they sucked more than a stripper) Onion Rings (as good as getting diarrhea when you're driving). I would like to go back and try the other burgers. Overall, not bad.

This review is based on two visits, once with just the Port/Stilton Burger, the other with Umami Burger with Fries. I really enjoyed the Port/Stilton Burger. Probably because I am a huge fan of both Port and Stilton. However, I must give credits to the patty's juiciness. I guess some people might find it a bit greasy, but the Brioche bun sucked up all the good juices in my opinion. My one criticism would be the somewhat subtle taste of Port. Oh and I kind of wish they would put some forms of pears as well. The Umami Burger was what disappointed me. Everything about this burger screamed umami: sauteed shiitake, oven dried tomatoes, beef patty, and Parmesan crisp. However, I didn't really get the shiitake, and that Parmesan crisp was not crispy. I would describe the texture of the crisp to be Sphaghetti that's about 1-2 minutes undercooked. The oven dried tomato was probably the best addition to the burger, despite my usual distaste to the fruit. Oh and I have to use another paragraph to talk about their fries. Their fries, first of all, were ginormous, and execution wise it was really good. Very crunchy on the outside, very soft and creamy in the inside. However, THE FRIES WERE NOT SEASONED. I DID NOT SEE ANY FLAKES OF SALT, NO NOTHING. A friend tried to justify by saying "Well it's all about their sauces." But NO, FRENCH FRIES NEED SALT. It needs at least a little bit. Plus I wasn't impressed with the homemade ketchup. I didn't really remember what it tasted like (shows how mediocre it was) but I think it had a smoky flavor to it. Meh. In terms of sweets, I was really annoyed when I found out the Cookie Sandwiches were like $6. I remember getting the exact same thing at a sample sale at the California Market Center for like $3. Not worth it. Also, the Ginger Ale they served sucked. Very, very bland. They should find another supplier.

Best burger I think I've ever had. I wished I could gave eaten another one the moment I was finished and too stuffed to actually accomplish that feat. The mere thoughts of which one to try next time around even though I was currently stuffed are a testament to the yummy nature of the Umami. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because after all is said and done, $20 per person for lunch at a burger joint, even such a happening one, is a little ridic. So how come I'm going again next week and breaking my once monthly red meat limit? Simply put, the buttery, succulent, Rib-eye burger. Just try the so cal burger. The mix of melt in your mouth cheese and slight sweetness of the roasted tomato will have you staring into the center of your new best friend, thinking dreamily "hello lover"...

Best burger I've ever had. My friens almost had an intervention because I've been going back so often. I've stopped telling them when I go. There is some kind of beautiful magic happening in the Umami kitchen. They are ridiculous -  soft, tasty, sweet, savory, airy, buttery burgers of goodness. For first-timers I highly recommend getting the original Umami burger. If you go with a partner I'd suggest getting the Truffle Burger and splitting the two. Thank you for being Umami. Thank you.

My girlfriend and I like to think of ourselves as foodies - specifically, burger connoisseurs.   Up until recently, our burger find had been The Counter in Studio City.   About a week ago we tried 8 oz Burger (review coming soon) and today we were fortunate enough to be invited by our dear friend's Heidi and Miles to Umami Burger.  When I originally received the invite I immediately responded that any place with the word "burger" in it is all good to me.   My girlfriend, however knowing my picky tendencies had viewed the website and sent me an email forewarning me of the "interesting" combination choices on the menu. I checked out the menu, and was a little weirded out by the offerings.  But, it was burgers after all so I reluctantly moved forward with an open mind. We arrived around 1:30pm on a Saturday afternoon and had a 10 minute wait.  The place is pretty small and was packed.  We sat down and I already knew that I wanted to try the Manly Burger.  The burger came with beer cheddar cheese, onions, smoked salt onion rings and bacon lardons.  I had previously googled bacon lardons and still wasn't 100% sure what I was getting myself into. Also ordered: Umami Burger and the SoCal Burger, fries and onion rings.   I am not a fan of onions and I asked the waiter if it would be sacrilegious to order the burger with modifications.  He said he would not suggest any changes as the burgers are put together to create a particular taste.  He said he would put the onions on the side for me so that I could try them. This ended up being a good call because the onions were delicious! The burgers were deceptively small.  Turns out for me they were a perfect size.  I usually cannot finish the 1/3 lb burger at The Counter.  I did observe quite a few other customers eating 2 burgers.  The first bite I knew I was in heaven.  The lardons were little chunks of salty, fatty, chewy, bacony goodness.  Two of us at the table had ordered the Manly Burger and were very satisfied.  My girlfriend who had the Umami Burger said hers was too sweet and that she did not like the french fries.  My friend Heidi had the So Cal burger.  On her previous visit she ordered the Turkey Confit Burger which she said was much better than the So Cal Burger. For dessert we ordered all of the different little mini cakes that they had and we split them.  There was a total of three: raspberry red velvet cake, peanut butter chocolate and chocolate.  The Peanut butter one was a hit at the table.  Our bill ran about $70 for 4 people I didn't think that was too pricey.  Everyone, except my girlfriend was very satisfied with their food.  That is why they are getting a 4 instead of a 5.   Service was great, the atmosphere was nice, and parking was fine.  One negative I can say is the tiny bit of ketchup that they give you with the food.  I personally ate 3 of them and still could have used another one.  But, all in all that was the worst of it.  8oz Burger is my favorite but Umami definitely runs a close second. YUMMY!

Stop everything you are doing. Go here immediately. After much anticipation, I went yesterday to Umami Burger. There were so many tasty choice on the menu but  I ordered the SoCal burger and ate every last bite. It comes with an oven dried tomato that adds a really distinct and great flavor. Mmm. Just thinking about it now is making hungry! I also had the skinny fries with the garlic aioli, yum. Next to the burger my favorite thing was dessert. I had the mint chocolate chip ice cream sandwich. Think gourmet Girl Scout Thin Mints in ice cream sandwich form. Everything was a perfect size, I left feeling satisfied and remained so the rest of the day. The place has cheap valet service ($2) which makes the trek out from the Westside a little easier.

A tasty burger at a gourmet price. I came here with a friend on a visit to LA and had a hankering for my first cheeseburger of 2010. We got to the parking lot and I was a little taken aback at the fact that they charge $2.50 to park. Truly, I thought, there must be something special inside. We were able to get a table immediately (not bad for 1:30pm on a Saturday) and were greeted by very simple menus. I chose the Umami burger with Umami ketchup. The waiter informed me that the burger was cooked medium rare, which is quite unusual as most places insist on cooking to medium to destroy E.Coli bacteria. I threw caution to the wind and got it medium rare anyway. We also split an order of onion rings. The burger itself is rather professionally assembled with not a thing out of place. I found the actual taste of the burger was excellent, but because it was small it was over far too soon. The onion rings were equally excellent, but a little oilier than I would like. Overall, a very good buger, but if you're hungry, you might need a few, and go broke in the process.

The wait for this place wasn't too bad.  Although there were a lot of parties waiting outside, we got to sit down in 30 minutes or less....not too bad.  They also have patio/outdoor seating.  I got their signature Umami Burger.  I thought the burger was pretty good overall...and if you order an appetizer and a burger, I think it's a good size to fill you up.  The prices are also reasonably priced. However, the service was a little slow and the parking is a small valet lot.  I recommend parking on the street.

The burger here is certainly something different. A good different, but not worth the hype. The onion rings ARE amazing. On the other hand, the pickle plate is disappointing and the fries come with a bad homemade ketchup (yuk). If you want to spend ~$20 a person for an above-average burger, then this is the spot. Otherwise, if you want a superior burger you should head to Fathers Office or the Apple Pan.

So so good. My husband and I both got the Umami burger and a side of fries with garlic aioli. Nothing but deliciousness was served. Alot of other reviewers noted the size of burger. Yes they are small relative to the burgers you can get that are the size of your head that make you feel like you want to die 30 minutes after eating it. If you see the quality of the meat, it is top notch. You can tell this from the cooked burger as well as the top sirloin they grind up to make the burger patties. You're paying for quality. The burgers come out a little rare, with some dripping blood while you eat, which I'm a big fan of. If that's not your thing, let them know. The parmesan crisp, tomatoes and mushrooms are a great compliment. Plus, Mexican coke!

The juicy burgers at Umami, Make my girl scream, "Aye papi!" I don't get jealous of the food, Because the grease lubes my mood. Although the grease drips down my fingers, The taste in my mouth still now lingers. Their signature burger and tempura onion rings, Were a party in my mouth making my stomach sing. Tomorrow morning sitting in the WC, I'll be thinking of how Unami burger was was good to me.

You know that feeling you get when you bite into something and suddenly your eyes roll back, your lids close and your mouth goes into salivation overload and all you can do is say, "Mmmmmmmm!"?  THAT was my reaction to my first bite of the signature Umami Burger! What is "umami"?  I was never quite sure, but after tasting this burger, I think I understand.  The signature burger is shiitake mushroom, roasted tomato, caramelized onions, house ketchup and a yummy parmesan crisp.  All the ingredients in this burger complement each other and allow the meat itself to shine through.  This burger is so moist and perfectly cooked it just melts in your mouth.  I know the burger meat is freshly made because I saw them grinding beautiful looking steaks into ground beef in the kitchen!  (Also saw them slicing up fresh slabs of bacon!) No fuss.  No muss.  Just simply a GREAT burger.   Now, why am I raving and only giving 4 stars?  That is because not all the burgers are as perfect.  While the meat is the same, the others my party tried didn't get quite the same reaction.  The So Cal Burger was good, but there was something about the spread that was a bit overwhelming.  And my friend said the Manly Burger wasn't all that special and tasted typical.   The Triple Pork Burger, however, was Amazing!  So juicy and flavorful, BUT it's pork, and not a true hamburger so I have to leave it in a separate category.  It tops my pork list, though.  Love me some pork...mmm.  Oops, let me get back on track...           The sides we tried:   Hand Cut Fries - Has a nice crisp and is soft and fluffy inside, but very thick. Sweet Potato Fries - If you like sweet potato fries, you'll like these.  Very similar to Father's Office. Tempura Onion Rings - Like fluffy clouds with a gentle crisp.  Very lightly seasoned so may seem a bit bland to some. House Pickles - a tray of pickled okra, carrots, cucumbers and slivered pickles.  (Yea, I thought aren't pickles cucumbers?  But that's what the waitress said so that's how I'm describing it) One thing that bothered me was that everything came with ketchup.  There was a list of sauces on the menu that you had to ask for and weren't even suggested to us.  Quite the opposite of Father's Office no ketchup snobbery. Oh, and no alcohol.  Not even BYO.  Bummer.  Just an array of specialty bottled sodas.   If you read my yelp profile, my last meal on earth is a burger and onion rings... and to date, that meal would be the Umami Burger (but the onion rings from Yard House~sorry!).

About a month ago I was in the Los Angeles area and Yelp recommended I try Umami Burger. I really enjoy a good gourmet burger, but after reading some of the reviews about it not being worth the price, we decided on another option. The following week I was watching "The Best Thing I Ever Ate" on Food Network and Giada DeLaurentis was raving about how the Umami Burger was so delicious at Umami Burger. It was then that I regretted not going. But as fate would have it, I was in the area on Monday evening and I asked my husband if we could try it for dinner. After all, Giada recommended it! When we arrived at 7pm there was no wait. The restaurant is really hip and spacious with a lot of young indie diners. There is a bar to the left of the entrance, which was pretty full, so I'm guessing they have a good happy hour. We perused the menu and ordered an Umami burger, truffle burger, onion rings, root beer float and coke. Our waiter dropped off my husband's coke, which was in an original coke bottle - very cute. Next came our onion rings. These were tempura battered and served with their special Umami ketchup. Very crisp and light. I wanted to ask for more ketchup, but I think they charge for it. The ketchup is special because they make it with Chinese 5 spice and soy sauce, so it has a bit of an asian flavor, but is not too overwhelming. I don't think I would have even noticed the difference. At this point, I was wondering where my root beer float was. I guess our waiter forgot. Next came our burgers. The Umami burger is constructed with an oven roasted tomato, grilled onions, parmesan cheese, sauteed mushrooms and the Umami ketchup. The truffle burger is made from a truffled cheese and the meat has a truffle oil in it. We ordered the burgers to be cooked medium since I'm pregnant and can't really eat meat that's too raw. When we took our first bites, the meat was REALLY pink on the inside. I mean, medium rare pink. So, when our waiter came by I made a comment and he said there would be no problem re-firing them. I also reminded him I was waiting on my root beer float. I used to work in a few restaurants and whenever something it not made the right way for a customer the whole thing is thrown away and the meal is cooked all over again. I'm assuming it's to prevent contamination, because why would you take a burger patty that's been bitten into and has someone's saliva on it and place it back on the grill where everyone else's food is cooking? So, it was a surprise when the exact same burgers, bite marks and all, came back to our table. Hmmmm. But whatever, I was pregnant and starving! So, we continued to consume our burgers. I liked the brioche bun on my burger and I can tell why Giada must have liked it so much. The flavor was somewhat reminiscent of pizza.  Giada = Italian = pizza. That's probably why she loved it so much. I just thought it was okay. I've definitely had better. My husband felt the same about his truffle burger. It was just okay. Maybe if they had thrown some mushrooms in there, it would have felt more like a mushroom burger? I washed it all down with my root beer float, which was vanilla ice cream served with a bottle of Sparks root beer. I've never tried this root beer before, and the spices were unique to me, so I liked it. I asked the waiter for glass of ice water as he cleared our dishes. He also forgot to bring that.  He did remember to give us the check, which was $36. I didn't want to bother him anymore. He was one of those waiters that pretends he cares, but really, he doesn't.  By the time we left, the place was crackin' and there were a few people waiting for tables. I don't think I would recommend this place or come back here though. I'm just as happy going to Red Robin and getting unlimited french fries!

I heard some bad things about Umami Burger's service but I believe they are referring to the 2 other locations because the 4 times I went to the LaBrea location - it was awesome. Can't get enough of the Umami Burger and the Triple Pork Burger. The rest of the burgers can't compare to these two. French fries are my favorite food in the world and they are cooked 3 times. Mmmmm steak fries. Chai coke was very different. It was up my alley because I like chai but my husband wasn't a fan. $10 per burger, it is well worth it to me. If you are going to eat more than one burger ask them to bring them out one at a time. Because the patty is thick, the juicies from the patty will make the bun soggy if you let it sit there. On my top 5 list of the best burgers in Los Angeles. I would say the Umami Burger is almost burger perfection. CONFESSIONAL: We ate here two days in a row. After the first time at dinner, we went back the very next day for lunch. Also it is not far from where I was staying. BTW I am not a fan of Father's Office or The Counter. This burger blows both of them out of the water.

I've heard all about the recent burger crave in Los Angeles since recently moving here from San Francisco and Umami Burger was one of the consistent restaurants coming up in conversations. I finally tried this joint out about 3 weeks ago (S. La Brea Location). I have to admit that I am the king at eying down other peoples food as it is brought through the restaurant and presented to the guests. So while we were waiting for a table to open up, I was checking out the burgers that were coming out of the kitchen. To be honest, at first sight, these things didn't look all that impressive! When I hear of great burger joints, I think of gigantic, condiments flowing out of the bun style burgers. To me, these looked just OK. We were seated after about a wait of 20min...not bad...and presented with a small front/back simple menu. I ordered a "Mexican Coke", coke in a glass bottle, tempura battered onion rings, sweet potato fries, and the Umami Burger (as is). Talk about a mouth watering meal....it was insanely delicious!!!! The portions were a bit small but to be honest, it was all I needed and filled me up. Of course I would recommend getting several sides to dip those fries in as they have a few different sides and they come in small quantities! The burger was so delicious and left me wanting more. Being that the portions were not overwhelmingly large, I had a little room for desert and I'm glad I did. They serve Ice Cream Sandwiches which are made by "MILK" on Beverly Blvd. Talk about a great way to end the meal! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that wants a simple, delicious, mouth watering meal at a reasonable price! I can't wait to go back.

Oh Umami Burger. You are delish. You devil you. It was my first time at Umami and definitely will not be my last. I was meeting a friend here and had I known that Valet was only $2.50 - I would have just done that versus driving around for days. I was nervous about parking in the neighborhood because of the street signs, but it turns out, that would have been fine. Umami is a tiny restaurant - I went last Saturday and it was so nice outside, so my friend and I sat on the patio. I had the Umami burger.....but I really want to go back and try the truffle burger. We had the really thick fries and onion rings. I normally hate steak fries. I'm not a fan, but these thick fries weren't bad. I didn't care for the onion rings....I think they needed to be cooked a little longer. The burger was delish. The mushrooms just worked with the rest of the burger and it was scrumptious. We decided to get dessert (normally I wouldn't do) but they had ice cream sandwiches! We ordered the toffee coffee ice cream sandwich and it came on two home-baked cookies (at least they looked home-baked to me). It was the perfect end after a delicious burger on a nice warm Saturday.

For the taste of the signature burger.. i give this place an A+. but for the value it gets a D.. I don't mind shellin out to eat.. but i mean.. i could get 3-4 cheeseburgers at in and out for the same price as 1 burger at this place... I came here to eat with a few friends.. we each had a burger.. and we ordered fries and/or onion rings for everyone.. After we finished.. we walked across the street to this new mexican restaurant that was having wednesday taco specials... That's how bad the portions are.. The fries are good.. but dude.. its like 6 fries per order... same goes for the rings... where do u get off charging $0.50 a fry... Overall i'm glad i tried this place.. but as for return business.. not likely.. i'll file it under..  good but overrated

An excellent burger!  Juicy, not overcooked, really flavorful and great tasting.     Went on a Wednesday night at 8, it was busy but our service was pretty quick.   2- Umami Burgers and thin fries.    You can get thick or thin fries, onion rings, etc. I'd warn the burger is on the smaller side, enough for a lady, but I went with my teenage son and he could have eaten 2. If you love burgers, its a must try!

Unami on La Brea, first time tonight. Very popular place. People are waiting outside for a table. Did not have to wait too long, 10 minutes tops. We sat in the back room; it was a tiny wee too noisy but that is caused by the tiles on the walls. Next time I prefer to sit "in the restaurant", this had a bathroom feeling to it. Service is good, fast and attentive. We ordered Unami signature burger and the truffle burger with cut fries. I loved my Unami burger, medium rare topped with parmegiano, mushroom and a sundried tomato, a feast of flavours yet nothing too overpowering.  From now on I only want brioche buns for hamburgers. My husband had the truffle burger which he thought was a little too greasy, I tried it and thought it was fine, very subtle truffle flavour. I will be back, for sure. Great spot.

I've been to a whole lot of burger places in my time, and this place, while unique, is one of those places I take people to who've never tried it.  That being said, I've tried nearly everything on that menu.  What people like in burgers is quite subjective.  Personally, I like the bread to meat ratio and the way they prepare the meat.  My issue here is the sheer cost of it all. For those big eaters out there, be prepared to be spending a lot of money.  Everything here is sold separately and the portions are quite small.  Most of the big guys I've brought have spent around $30 for a meal here.  Each burger is about $10 and they don't come with any sides or drinks. The food here is great, and it's something worth trying.  As mentioned earlier, the only issue I have is when I take a step back and look at the big picture...  I just spent $30 on a burger joint just for myself.  Something just doesn't feel right about that.  Anyhow, go try it.  Hopefully the juice is worth the squeeze for y'all.

$10 for 6oz. burger.  Add about $3.50 for fries and $3 for a drink. Good, yes.  Unforgettable, no. Worth trying so at least you can say you tried it. If you're a guy with a regular appetite...the portions are too small. For me, the portion was perfect.

I'd ignore the naysayers. We went last night (Friday) at 8:45 after deciding against the 2+ hour wait (for the bar) at Animal.   I had the Umami Burger, the hubs had the Manly Burger and we got the thin fries and the onion rings. I wanted some of the Cheezy tots, but they ran out. Boo.   Anyway, I found the burger amazing. Tasty, cooked a-ok and on a wonderfully delightful bun. Oh boy oh boy. Yeah. it's the burger that all burgers will be judged by.  I can't wait to go back!

Kept hearing about how great Umami Burger was, decided to give it a try, and was decidedly disappointed. I ordered the original Umami Burger without mushrooms, which was ten bucks and not at all worth it. I don't mind shelling out for a good burger but this certainly was not. The burger itself was fine, but what really killed it for me was the sauce. It was smothered in a house-made ketchup which tasted strongly of licorice. While I am not a huge fan of licorice or anise it can sometimes be quite pleasant, but not in this case. The sauce completely overpowered the meat and all the other ingredients and made the bread soggy and wet. I also found the sweet potato fries to be a tad too sweet. My friends ordered the Port & Stilton Burger, which apparently tasted like nothing more than meat and bread, and The Green Bird which everyone agreed was the best but was really nothing special. There motto is "The fifth taste: sweet, salty, sour, bitter, umami," and I am completely satisfied with leaving umami out.

OK, OK It deserves 3.5 stars but I couldn't give it a four.  Sorry people.   We went here today after the LA car show and I had high but not crazy hopes for this place.   We drove past some awesome looking local food joints to go to a possibly over rated Burger joint.  We were right, because it is a little over hyped.   Well the place is small but it was OK.  We found parking in the neighborhood so we didn't have to valet.  the hostess and waitress were both very nice and I would give the service 4 stars.   For the food.  I ordered the Umami burger and my husband ordered the pork burger.  We also ordered Sweet potato fries and onion rings with the ketchup, jalapeno ranch and the garlic aioli.   The size of the burger was not too big but I think it is a normal and decent size.  The burgers are pretty darn rich so you really don't or at least need anything too much bigger with the sides.  I had high hopes for the Umami burger and thought it was good but nothing special at all.  The flavors kind of just mushed together.  The burgers were cooked perfect though.  My husbands pork burger was good but again not the best pork burger I have had.  I might be a little biased because my man makes a pretty mean burger and it is cheaper and much tastier  than Umami.   The sides were just OK not even really good.  The onion rings looked amazing but they were pretty oily just like the other reviews say.  the SP fries were OK but kind of flavorless. Overall it was not bad, but it wasn't what I would call "The best thing I ever ate" worthy.  I am glad I tried it.  I probably will keep trying other places before I venture back though.

So I went here with a friend with the same name a while back. He highly recommended it and said "it's one of the best !@#$ing burgers you'll ever have." So I'm expecting a good burger, but I have no idea what kind of restaurant it is, and I half expected it to be a hole-in-the-wall kind of place, and I wasn't half wrong. The restaurant is located on La Brea, not particularly a pleasant neighborhood, but not at all uncomfortable. But the restaurant is kind of a shining glimmer in an otherwise dismal looking street. The restaurant itself is very small, so I expect there would be a line during peak hours. But the ambiance and decor is very warm and inviting. We were seated and given a menu, which was very simple. Burgers ($9-11) and sides (French fries, onion rings, etc.) and drinks. There's no alcohol here, which is pretty neat. It prevents lingering patrons and keep the  kitchen moving. It's a great idea. The drinks are almost all bottled, and moderately priced. They have Mexican coke there, which is always a pleasant surprise at any dining establishment. I ordered the Umami Burger and wow it was damn good. The bun was one of those over-sized ones that you would get at a high-end bar. And they were toasted to a perfect crisp on the outside, while maintaining that soft doughy consistency. And the produce was all generously given. We shared an order of the onion rings, which were jumbo sized and pretty filling. The condiments are apparently one of the staples of Umami. They make it in house? I'm not quite sure, but they're a little stingy with it, which leads me to believe that it's superb or something... well at least with the onion rings, it wasn't anything special. Perhaps they use it in their burgers, because that burger was so good that I kind of didn't want to eat any onion rings until I had finished, as to prevent the taste from mixing. Overall, the expeience was great. And the food was bomb. It's a little pricey, but not unbearable. I would definitely come back for a special occasion of some sort. Or perhaps if Pink's (down the street) has a line 2 blocks up La Brea.

I kept hearing about this place so I decided to check it out.  My experience here wasn't the best, but it wasn't the worst either.  I ordered the umami burger and it was very delicious! :)   The downside to this place is that they have such small portions.  I was nowhere near content when I finished my burger.  I definitely could have eaten at least another one.   We also ordered sweet potato fries and onion rings.  It comes with their homemade umami ketchup, which I didn't really care for.  I think I'd prefer regular ketchup over theirs. I don't regret coming here, but I wouldn't say that I'm dying to come back.

I went here a few months ago for a birthday. The wait is long and reservations are recommended. The menu is simple, and the burgers are very good and unique, however I don't think its worth $12-15 for a burger. The sides and drinks are also extra. If you're looking for a good burger with poor-boy prices, look to In-n-Out and just add your own fried cheese on top. hahaha.

Disappointed, to be honest.  Been wanting to try this place for like a year and finally made it after a Laker game.  The place wasn't too busy at 3 p.m. on a Sunday, but there's not many tables (maybe 10), so you probably would have to wait during a weekend dinner hour. I tried half of a Umami Burger and half of a Manly Burger.   They weren't bad, but nothing special and not overly flavorful.  I liked the Manly Burger better but if I go again I'll probably give the SoCal a shot. Definitely not a terrible burger but not worth the price.

To sum it up, it was way better than my first time. I got the Earth burger, and the cheesy totes. Both were amazing with lots of flavor. =)........ I wold definitely come back to get myself some more of this mouth-watering burger. i also prefer the Santa monica location over the La brea one because its way bigger and the service is great.

I had the Manly burger, which has beer-cheddar cheese, smoked-salt onion strings and bacon lardons.  The bacon lardons were huge chunks and pretty flavorful.  The burger was really juicy but it was really greasy. The sweet potato fries were pretty normal.  Nothing special about them. The smushed potatoes were pretty amazing.  They have a nice crunch to them since they are double fried and it was perfectly seasoned

This place is AMAZING, literally the best burger in LA...no, more like the best burger I've ever had ever! I had the Truffle Burger which was decadent and delicious. My friends and I split several sides: the thin fries, sweet potatoe fries, the smushed potatoes and the cheesy tots (carb overload) They were all equally  impressive. I even got Diet Coke in a glass bottle! Usually those are only offered to my full calorie soda drinking friends. The wait was about an hour and we were in a hurry so we got the food to go which was quick and painless. I just wish they had a bigger seating area. Bottom Line: TRY UMAMI BURGER!

This place is really good! I think that it is a little better then father's office that is suppose to have the best burgers in LA.   The burgers are small but they are still filling. Also if you go you have to get the cheesy tots, THEY ARE SO GOOD!   Don't get the onion rings they are more batter then onion, and are not worth it when you can get the fries, or did I mention the tots.  I got the original and it was yummy yum yum.     Also save room for desert, it is so good. Also the staff is super nice, and all of them are good looking.

I was very disappointed by umami burger. It is one of those places that try to be unique and different, gourmet and out of the box, modern and hip, but really don't know what the hell they are doing. Even though I saw the mediocre reviews on yelp, one l.a. Magazine raved about the veggie burger, so I took myself and family to go try it out since I am vegetarian. When we came, I was surprised to see it was not that crowded. First warning. We ordered the ominously titled "house pickles", which turned out to be tons of little tidbits of weirdly pickled different veggies I did not ask for. I wanted pickles! The pickles however were very tasty, the actual cucumber pickles that is.  After that the burgers came, and at first sight I was dissapiointed by the one peice of thin lettuce in my burger. If they are going to put lettuce in a burger, they need to put an amount you can actually taste. Plus, no one eats the extra shards of lettuce pertruding out of the bun when the size of the burger is was smaller than the lettuce. Cut your pieces in half!!! I kept my hopes up high, because I liked that the veggie burger looked like a real patty from the outside. My brother got the Cali burger, which also looked good. First bite was fine I thought. But that was psychological, either because I was starving, or because I really wanted it to live up to my expectations. By the second bite it was established the burger was gross. It was supposed to be made of mushrooms and edemame, but it tastes like bland paste. Then to my demise, the onions were potently seasoned with anise, which gave it a very unusual taste, the bad unusual. As I predicted, the little peice of butter lettuce was tasteless. But the butter I did taste was the butter smothered on the insides of the overly sweet bun, and on the patty. Not exactly the health level I expected from a veggie patty. After I couldn't take the suffering of eating that pasty burger that was beginning to slop out of the sides, I decided to try my brothers cali burger. It was so bad I gagged and had to spit it out on a napkin. The anise was overpowering the entire burger, and to put it lightly, it tasted so freakishly bad. I lost my appetite after that, and I was glad I did. On top of that, the burgers were ridiculously expensive for what they are, and they don't even come with a side, which are also expensive. I am now in the car on the way home and I feel like throwing up! Do not go here no matter how good things you hear about it! I got fooled!

My first visit was the Hollywood location. I love the Burgers so I had to eat it again when I was in the area .  My bf and I decided to go to the La Bear location since it was more closer to where we were at.  But then again I regret visiting this location since it made a bad impression on me. Usually I don't write much and not a complainer but this location suck ass. When I got there it was small compare to the Hollywood location with arts of paper of Umami burger people design on the back of the register. We sat next to the register . Our server Bree was nice a casual when she greeted my bf and I. She took our drink orders and when we were ready she took our order. I order a Port & Stilton and my bf couldn't decide a So Cal Burger with anything else so he just went down the left of menu and the Truffle Burger was recommend since the So Cal burger was described as a typical All American Burger. Usually for the Beef patties the server should ask how you like the meat to be cooked since she ask that to her customers next to us and the other location ask that too. For our sides we order a Sweet Potato Fries & since this location didn't have the chili cheese fries we tried the Cheesy Tots since she recommended that. We also got the Umami Ketchup When we receive our burger the the Buns were burnt and the burgers were very greasy.   Both of the meat look burnt and like the grill hasn't been clean since the burnt grease was stuck onto the meat .The Truffle burger and the Port & Stilton looks similar by taste very different. My Port & Stilton was salty. I think because of the blue cheese. I didn't really enjoy. My bf didn't like his burger either since all the grease was dripping I like the Sweet potato fries it was pretty good, but the cheesy tots was not crispy and very salty. It's just tots combine with cheese and fried. Didn't  like it. I had to throw my left over away when i got home since I couldn't eat more that 2.  Both sides didn't go well with the Umami Ketchup. The ketchup was watery and didn't taste that great. After we got our meal and ate it, our server never came back to check on us. I understand she was busy, but the place wasn't big to be that busy. I know because I was a server too and If i can handle a big restaurant doing two departments then I think she can handle 4 tables. Anyways, I had to ask the bus boy to give me a box for left overs of the side and waited 5 -10mins to request for a check and water refills. As I took my card out to pay. I waited another 5-10 mins till my server got done helping others and bringing orders to her other customers, but instead when she was done with all that.  i look at the register and see my server talking to her co-worker while im still sitting and waiting. I had to just hand the co worker( Erin) my check over the counter while sitting down. Overall I wouldn't go back to this location. Service sucks and food wasn't that great.

All I can say about a Umami burger is that it's like putting lipstick on a pig.  Venue is super small and modern looking.  I came with a party of 5.  There were no tables left to accommodate us so we were sent to the back area with bar stools.  First of all, one of the walls where we were seated at was shared with the restroom.  Every flush was heard.  It was kind of disgusting.  The sweet potato fries were nothing special.  I don't understand the hype and the rest of the party concurred.  I ordered the 12 dollar truffle burger but couldn't really taste the truffle.  The buns were super oily and the burger patty was thin and raw (I'm exaggerating a bit but it pretty much was extra rare).  They must have a kick ass PR rep to be doing so well.  It's just one of those places that are overrated.

Im going to give a pretty detailed review about the place. I went in on a weekday at around 3pm. Surprisingly it wasn't that busy considering all the traffic outside. Wasn't expecting valet service, but it wasn't a big deal considering it only cost me $2.50, not including tip. The valet was nice, but onto the food. The menu was simple and easy to read, they could do a better job on making me salivate. Overall the menu was great. I ordered the Truffle Burger which was $12 and some sweet potato fries which were $3. The wait time wasn't bad, mostly at around 10 minutes. I had my friends to keep me company and the interesting Hollywood atmosphere. The burger had finally arrived and it was surprisingly small. Im used to large burgers typically prepared at family BBQ's and IN-N-OUT. The burger itself was pretty delicious, I must say. The fries might be an acquired taste, but they were filling. The UMAMI ketchup was pretty unique too. I like how this eating establishment tried to make everything its own. Im 5'11" and at around 175 pounds, so I look lean and athletic, which I am. Overall the food was delicious and service was great. The staff was kind and nice and gave great recommendations. Our waiter was cute too ;). The only problem was the price. It was a bit too much to pay $12 for a burger. Its not like I'm going to come in here everyday though. Great idea, and was not disappointed by it.

Their burgers are great: Deal with it. Trust me, I can empathize with the contrarian impulse we all harbor inside for a place that's gotten grotesquely popular, but it's not just smoke and mirrors that has people lined up outside the door. The proof is between the buns. The fact that's it's not a hole-in-the-wall-hidden-gem-priced-for-college-­students sorta place doesn't mean it doesn't justify its existence. The fries get a bad rap too, especially when you order them covered in truffle cheese. The truffle burger is, unassailably, one of the world's delights. Service is adequate-to-good.

The atmosphere was amazing. Really. I don't drink but probably a great place to drink and have a burger. That being said. The burgers were good, I would not say great. I've had better off gourmet trucks. I felt the prices were a buck or two to high. They do not have diet coke. They have the Mexican import coke Light which is not at all diet coke tasting. Parking is great at least during the day. There is nice stores around there so you can make a evening around there if you like. I think you have to get a burger here at least once to see the place. It's up to you.

This place got a review on the front page of Yahoo! And boy was I disappointed. I can see how people who think this place is that great but it's just ok. My GF had the umami burger and I had the triple pork burger. Taste was great bun was nice, but that's about it. The couple next to us had a truffle burger, which I could smell, but I've had friends who ordered it and said that the burger taste drowns out the truffle. The wait wasn't too bad and we beat out the crowd by going at 630. They have all bottle/canned drinks, which made it unique (Mexican coca cola is awesome), but other than that it was just ok. I had a side of the sweet potato fries and these were pretty good. They were sprinkled with brown sugar and had a umami ketchup served with them. I'll go back for a second try but only if the lines are short. I can't see myself waiting more than 30 minutes for this place. The parking is crazy and always packed. You can try to find street parking but its LA so beware of parking enforcement.

The last time I went was actually several months ago, but I've been too lazy to write a review. First of all, the food is good but not really as good for how much it costs. The fries have some unique name.. but it's just fries... the onion rings were not good at all (at least when we got them). The batter was not fried long enough or something. It was just mushy and ... just not very good. We also got the pickle plate thing ( I don't know why...).. It was nice to have pickles on the table with our food, but it's once again, not worth it. You have to pay extra for extra sauce.. LAME... and the amount of sauce they give is really not enough for the bland onion rings.... In essence, burgers are good. Nothing else is really worth it. Long lines because this location is a really small (I think it was the original?) and parking is horrid.

Honestly for how good your product is, you have the worst service and staffing at both your locations Ive been to, but that hasnt stopped me from going to the one on 5th+broadway but the other day I went here with my girlfriend, coworker and another friend as soon as I walked in to put my name down the chubby hispanic hostess just pointed outside looking straight at us, I said I was just trying to put my name down, she was extremely rude and unprofessional, finishing up her text message before writing down my name....anyways definitely will not return ever to this location even though it is a lot closer than the other one.

Food was great.  I got the earth burger.  The truffles in the burger were a nice touch.  It wasn't the best veggie burger I've had, but it was definitely above average.  My husband got the umami burger and loved it.   What sold me on this place were their fries.  I had the skinny fries, potato smush, and the onion rings.  My husband and I ate ALL of it between the two of us.   I really wish they had real glass cups for water though.  The clear plastic cups were flimsy and felt bad against my lips.

I went out to lunch at Umami with a few co-workers knowing that this place had a bit of a buzz surrounding it.  For my meat-loving, burger eating friends that like a nicer ambiance compared to The Counter or even In & Out, this place is for you.   Umami makes a handful of different burgers (none vegetarian, of course) such as Pork, Turkey, and even a lamb burger.  I truly enjoyed their Port and Stilton burger and give props to the Umami and the Triple Pork burger.  Each burger is delicately crafted almost like it's ready for a photo-shoot and each burger tastes as delicious as it looks.  Wash it down with some sodas made with real sugar such as Mexican Coke, Sparky Root Beer, etc. My only negative comment here is that Umami is a very small place with only a few people on staff so it does take a little longer for them to get the food out quickly or things run out quickly on the menu.

There are many things that go into making a restaurant good, like decor, service, and of course, the food. This place has the food down for the most part.  The burgers are good/very good, with unique types, like a truffle burger, which was delish.They chose to have buns similar to Lucky Devil's, which are very good.  Like all the other reviews say, the fries are good, but come on, 8 fries/$3? That was ridiculous.   The decor had a definite style.  I didn't love it, but hey, at least they were trying.  The layout of the tables was a bit inefficient and awkward, so sitting at one of the counters was really clunky and uncomfortable. So why the 2 Stars?  Because the owner acted like a jerk for 75% of the meal, with odd, inappropriately snarky attitude.  If you can't deal with people and can only do food, then stay in the kitchen, my friend.   Also, the parking situation is a nightmare.  They should spring for a valet or someone to manage it as opposed to creating unneeded stress. I am reluctant to be so harsh, because I believe in food-oriented places like this, but treat people who are giving you money and exposure with basic respect, instead of with contempt.  For a place that gets the food-focus right, and manages to be pretty nice too, check out Animal.

I'm a big fan of the Umami burger.  I happen to work nearby and have been 3 times in the last couple of weeks.  I think they have a great start, with some minor kinks that I would expect in any new restaurant.   The burgers are top-notch and beautifully prepared but. In the hope that the owners read this, here are some recommended improvements. Food 1) Onion Rings are great, followed by the eggplant fries.  I strongly recommend that you also offer some skinny frites (seasoned with truffle salt perhaps) as a counterpoint to the rich burgers.  The thick fries with the thick juicy burger is a bit overwhelming. Presentation/Service 1) Ditch the condiments served in Chinese spoons.  First, this is outdated by about 5 years.  Second, and more importantly, they're a pain in the ass to use, especially when you're sharing because you can knock them over.  Just use small cups or dishes instead. 2) Provide a fork.  It's cute that you just have a knife and napkin, but the burgers are messy and you're going to want to scoop up the burger shrapnel with something other than fingers. 3) Coach your servers.  My last server had the aloof/disinterested vibe of an Apple store employee and didn't seem to have handle on basic server skills.  My friend and I gave our order, then the server decided he should write it down so we had to repeat it.   Anyway, small issues really.  Keep up the good work.

Good to try once The Umami burger was tasty but I doubt I will be craving it again. The fries were not bad but not $2.50 good. For a place of this size -  about 10 2 seater tables - you would think the service would be better but this wasn't the case. It's nothing special.

Why I have never thought of putting my favorite fruit and drink together beats me! I could drink 10 gallons of that stuff!! Fries- 3 stars only cause they were so damn good but there is so little :( Monkey cake- 5 stars! Chocolate. Red. Velvet. Cake. 'nuff said. Price- 2 stars :( $40 inc. Tax and tip... Overpriced sir. Wait- 1 star. 20 min to get a table. 30 min to get the food. 10 min to devour. It does not make mathematical sense!!

I've been here a couple of times with friends and have tried the Umami burger, the one with green chilis, and truffle burger. The best for sure is the one with green chilis. It's definitely a good burger, but it is a bit overpriced. I really like the soft bun that lets you taste the meat. The tempura battered onion rings are good and fries are ok. The portions are a bit small though. Definitely worth trying if you want a good burger.

I probably could have typed this on my phone while I was waiting, it took soooooo dang long to get my food. I got there on a tuesday just after one, it was crowded but I was seated right away.   My waitress might have ben new and I think she probably forgot to put my order in, because it took, no exaggeration here.... wait for it.... 50 MINUTES to get my one burger. no burger and fries, and salad.  No large party with lots of requests to complicate the order. I got the Socal Burger straight up, and it took 50 freakin minutes to get to me. 2 people who were sat when I got there, got their food, ate it and left a good 20 minutes before I got mine.  Also a party of THREE who arrived about 25 minutes after me, sat, ordered and got fed before I did. So basically the service stinks at this place.  Another customer complained as I was paying as well, and they said "everything is made to order... we're small... " but 50 minutes is unacceptable for a single burger. My theory is that they like you to order in bulk, maybe that's gets faster service. OR work for Dreamworks, since a couple who sat down behind me were served within 10minutes of getting there.  The owner chatted them up as they regaled him with tales of filming Gladiator with Ridley Scott. How was the burger?  Great.  Very tender and juicy.  I agree with all the other comments about dripping grease.  The cheese was excellent as well.  However the burgers are pretty small, just a few ounces after cooking.   One review mentioned The Counter and having eaten there a few times, 1 counter burger is the size of probably 3 Umamis, and they're about $1 less. Good burger. Yeah.  Worth $9.88 for it and a 50 minute wait?  Definitely not. It is a cool place and I'm willing to give them another shot, but if this slow service is their hallmark... forget it. And, honestly, who cares that there's Mexican Coke?  oooh woweeee, Mexican Coke - made with real sugar! So cool! So much better for me than regular coke... If you're actually a soda connoisseur, you're probably not someone worth taking food advice from. Peeeeeeeeeaaaaace!

My husband picked this place so I wasn't sure what to expect since I hadn't read or heard anything about it, but I've never had such a good burger in my life!  The restaurant itself is kind of small and cramped but that's fine with me.  There's also street parking available if the parking lot is full. When we went it was the lunch rush, but we only waited for about a minute before we were seated.  We ordered the following: - Iced Green Tea (Tasty, but I don't think they give refills.) - Chai Soda (Strange, but I liked it.  If you don't like Chai Tea, you probably won't like this.) - Umami Burger  (Hubby said it was very good.) - Casablanca Burger (I usually don't eat lamb, but this was AMAZING!) - Fat Fries - Onion Rings Everything was seriously so good.  When we were in the car, driving to our next destination, I kept on saying, "Wow, that's the best meal I ever had.  EVERYTHING tasted good."  There wasn't one bad thing I could think of. Pricewise, it's not cheap, but I'm fine with that.  For the two of us, it was about $34 for the aforementioned items, prior to tip. If you're a burger lover, I'd definitely check this place out.

CALL BEFORE YOU GO HERE.  they may be closed.... I guess the Umami made some serious $$$$ by franchising this place.  They no longer need to work.  They may decide to take the day or week off at random.   Don't trust any note you find posted to the door.  They don't know the difference between December and November (ESL?)  - so who knows what other mistakes they are prone to make.  just call first.

Nothing special here to justify the press. If you're looking for the 'it' burger, stick with either the latest (Fathers Office Burger) or the greatest (Double Double) The beef itself was great, and the charred cheese is a nice touch, but the stewed tomatoes tasted canned, like Manwich.

The burgers were incredible.  I split a truffle and pork burger with a friend and both were great.  The truffle burger was slightly better, but that is a matter of mere percentage points.  The large cut fries were also pretty darn tasty.  The burgers are coated with a shine (probably butter) meshing well with the excellent meat patty. My only suggestion is that you ask for a little more ketchup with your fries right when you order.   If the place is packed and the server is busy, getting more will be a bit of a struggle.

I got takeout from here with a friend because normally the place is crazy on a Friday night.  People were friendly and everything looked delicious so we were really excited!  When we got home we were disappointed to see that our burgers (SoCal and Umami) were pretty small for what we paid and our order of fries was about 10 fries and they gave us the wrong dip sauce (their ketchup-ish dip instead of garlic aioli).  Needless to say, we were ready to never go back...until we took our first bites. Honestly, I have no idea what was actually on or in my burger and I cannot describe the taste effectively but it was SO GOOD.  We downed the burger and fried the dip they gave us was very good even if it wasn't what we ordered.  We want to go back and eat there to get the fresh taste instead of cooler takeout one and get the right dip sauce but we will certainly be returning! Parking does look like a pain (we walked) and I know it gets busy but as a converted skeptic I say it's all worth it!

Listen this isn't your Grandfathers Burger joint, but the Best Burger in Town if you ax me. I have not had a burger I did not like, although the Hatch Burger is my fav.... They grind all of their meat right there in the back ev day, and the burgers come out perfect medium rare, PERFECT!! Make sure you try the Tempura Onion Rings (just don't eat more than 2 of them, cause it will fillllll you up!) They have a couple other locations in town including the newest in Santa Monica (in the Fred Siegal) which has beer and wine....

I went here this weekend with a friend.  She suggested it after visiting a photog. exhibit.  I've always passed by this place going to The Grove and wondered what all the group / fuss was about.....and know I know why.  Probably one of THE best burgers I've had in a long time.  Price was a little up there but for the service AND the food...well worth it.  I came here on a Saturday night, very small and quaint place.  It was a litlte busy, waited about 10 minutes or so for a seat.   The place is very modern looking, utensil

Not much to say..gf had the truffle burger, I had the hatch...both were amazing...the chilies in the hatch were very mild and contributed to the overall...truffle was not overpowering...both burgers were perfect creations with incredibly balanced flavors...some of the best we have had...maybe because of the amazing buns! Usually the bun is an afterthought, these are high quality, soft brioche buns. We also got them medium- they were still really juicy, would recommend medium. the rings and thin fries were also amazing.

Being that I've been to the Silverlake Umami Burger, then to this one twice, I must say I was rather disappointed, relatively. Waitstaff unattentive upon your entry, as well as during your meal. It's a bunch of hurried dudes chatting with each other. The Umami burger was also a tad too rare on my second visit to this Umami. Quite the torrent of red/clear juice sopping my bun. That being said, be sure to taste the delicious Milk ice cream sandwiches! Coffee Toffee is my fave, when available.

Went to Umami on a Sunday afternoon.  Pulled into the valet but my friend yelled at me not to park there because parking was easy to find in the neighborhood.  And it was! Sat outside on the patio, which was small and packed with tables.  But there weren't too many people and weather was nice, so it was great. My friend is vegetarian and I don't eat beef or pork, so we didn't have much choice in what to order.  When I asked if I could get the Hatch Burger with a turkey patty, I was told that they don't do any substitutions or changes to the burgers.  I dunno about you, but if I'm paying $10+ for a burger-no-sides then it would be nice to have some leeway.   Whatever!  So I ordered the Turkey Miso and my friend got the veggie burger.  I actually really liked mine, but hers was a very strange texture and kept falling apart.  She said the flavor was good, but she's had way better.  (Sorry, but our beef-eating friend flaked!) Tried the fries and onion rings.  Onion rings were much better than the fries.  The table next to us really seemed to enjoy their sweet potato fries.  We also split the mint chip ice cream sandwich, which I would go back to eat on its own.  Hence the 3 stars, rather than only 2.   Great to try, but wouldn't be on my main go-to burger list.

The juiciest burger I have ever tasted in my life! I had the Triple Pork Burger and even though I am probably that much closer to dying from a heart attack...it was worth it! The meat pretty much melted in my mouth. Though you may think the portion is small, the patty is fairly large. Both my friend and I were completely stuffed by the end of the meal. Though they didn't have it on the menu, the waitress let us know they were whipping up some sweet potato fries (which I HAD to order) which she recommended with the roasted garlic aoili. The crunchiness of the sweet potato which was sprinkled with a little cinnamon sugar was well complimented by the smooth sweetness of the roasted garlic aoili. I am looking to try more burgers and some of their other locations, which I found out they had as I was trying to find their menu. so many choices! :)

Less story, more review Tried: Truffle Burger and Triple Pork Burger (1/2 of each), rocky road ice cream sandwich Verdict: arguably the best burgers I've had on the West Coast. In the same league as Father's Office and one notch above The Counter. Great service during my visit (though that seems hit or miss depending on the time of the day). $9-11 for a medium sized burger (a bit bigger than a Double Double from In&Out) Recommendation: I thought the juice was worth the squeeze. I suggest you see for yourself. I wouldn't hesitate to come back

Umami means "good flavor" in Japanese, and their burgers definitely have it. I ordered the Umami Burger which had Shitake Mushrooms, Fried Parmesan Cheese Slice Thing. The patty was so juicy and "Umami" like, you don't need much on it to enjoy. You also have the option to order French Fries, Sweet Potato Fries and TATER TOTS. Yea, we ordered the Tater Tots. These aren't your normal 3rd Grade Cafeteria Tots, these actually taste fresh and homemade..Very Good! The tater tots are served with a side of Umami's special Ketchup. When ever I'm in the mood for a burger fix and don't want to feel like shit afterwards...Im def' coming back to Umami!

i REALLY don't get it. I was sooo hyped to finally try the much-talked about... UMAMI BURGER!!! (said in deep, almighty voice over PA speakers). and when i did, it wasn't delicious. it didn't live up to the hype. i don't wanna say it's bad, because it's not. but seriously, it's not that great. the UMAMI BURGER!!! tasted bland. i ordered the regular umami burger with onion rings. the bf had his manly burger. the manly burger tasted much better than the umami burger, but still not worth dumping in-n-out for. the best part about this place is the onion rings. the tempura batter makes the onion rings melt in ur mouth. my bf and i both agreed--best onion rings we've ever had. if you've never had an UMAMI BURGER!!! then go ahead and scratch your curiosity itch, because everyone's talking about how great it is and you don't wanna be left out of the convo like a loner. waste $10 for a burger (that in-n-out can easily $#!t on) and be part of the SoCal in-crowd. so next time you're at a party, you'll be even cooler by saying what everyone else are thinking (umami burger is crap), while they're all pretending to love it.

Came here last night for the first time with my boyfriend and was not disappointed.  We sat outside in their side patio area and loved the heaters. We were a little surprised by how small the burgers were but we were definitely satisfied.  Both of our burgers were so tender and juicy.  They just melted in your mouth.  We started off with their new salad.  I can't remember the name of it but it was really good.  I had the Hatch Burger which had the perfect kick to it.  My bf had the Manly Burger and loved the thick pieces of bacon in it.  We also had a side of sweet potatoe fries.

O.M.to the G. these burgers are bangin'! Umami in my tummy. The burgers are Great. Very Juicy Very Tender Very Yummy. The hand cut fries are good they get an 8 out of 10. Im sure their sweet potato fries cure cancer. I can almost bet Jesus touched those S.P Fries. The place is a bit small. Not good for groups bigger than 4.

I wan't  impressed. I decided to try the Umami because it's so close to my house and I had read that it  was great. I love a good burger, but I didn't really find my burger to be very good (Socal Burger). It was over sauced, over salted and greasy, honestly it tasted like someone dropped about half a bottle of Worcestershire sauce on the thing. The onion rings had a good flavor but about half were a bit soggy, they would have been much better with a crisper coating. What's worse are  the people working there. Not only do they seem rude, but one worker in particular felt it was appropriate to have a very loud conversation with his co-worker about pissing off another customer right in front of me and some others. For the price ($14 for a burger and onion rings) I would expect a higher caliber of service.  Fast food chains have  better service. BTW, it cost $3 to park in their parking lot. Kind of lame in my opinion. I would suggest going to The Counter or Father's Office over this place.

Went to the one on La Brea. A bit crowded but were sat pretty quickly. So far so good. Once inside, noticed that one of the dudes behind the register was a tad bit sweaty.. perhaps too close to the kitchen. Our table was rocking back and forth, which was not the best experience but I was still trying to be patient with them. We got our orders in but while waiting for the food, noticed sweaty dude (maybe the manager) running around the place, head drenched in sweat. Not a sight I want to see when I'm eating. After a good 5-10 minutes of this, my bf finally asked our server to have the dude clean up- mercifully before our food came. It'd have been pretty disgusting watching this as I dined. Finally, he came out from the back looking rather refreshed. I still wonder why he never thought to do so, or why none of the other employees mentioned it to him without having to wait for a customer to do so. FOOD: The signature burger is juicy but tiny and unremarkable, the Pork burger was very tasty. Overall, pretty underwhelming experience.

Yes...I said Spoonful. Burgers are medium rare, which is how I like my burgers. A bit on the pricey side, however very delicious and flavorful . loved the parmesan crisp on the burger mos def going back. Cons- *no beer *only valet *hostess was a pain *they charge for sauce, even ketchup

Lot of hype around this place. Was in town for All-Star weekend, and my buddy took me to Umami on Saturday on the way to the dunk contest. Lenny Kravitz was also there waiting to be seated, which was kind of funny. So, with the various sides, sauces, etc., they are what they are. But I'll say that I very much enjoyed the umami ketchup with fries. I'm convinced that they put truffle oil in the ketchup... Anyhow, the 5 stars are specifically for the Umami Burger. As hyped as it is, it really was that good. I never knew what Umami really was, but I was taught. Great Burger.

I enjoy and envy Los Angeles's food selection. Among the many great places I've been to, Umami is insanely delicious- and for a smallburger 10$+  IT BETTER BE. Figuring it to be all hype I wanted to try it out and I'll tell you, it is no wonder that their burgers are ranked #1 in the nation. Due to its popularity it was busy on a Thursday night with the wait being close to 30 minutes. Parking is hit or miss on the street if you don't want to pay for valet. I ordered the Truffle while my sis got the Umami, and at first bite you just can't put it down. I practically inhaled the entire thing pausing only to shovel in sweet potato fries. I recommend ordering take out if you don't want to wait so long for your meal. This is due to the fact that after sitting down it takes about another 10-20 min for the food to come out since there's just too many heads. If you're into eating healthy I would advise you save that for another day, as the savory buns and juicy patties overwhelm practically every sense of your body. Five guys? In-n-out? Please, this is what a real burger tastes like.

It's a good burger. But overpriced. And the fries (over-salted and arriving with a spoon of very sweet ketchup) weren't even included in the price. The ambience is fairly mediocre too-- small, with a thick crowd of loud 18-25 year olds. You're basically paying more for the hip self-satisfaction of the gourmet semi-fusion hamburger than for the actual quality of the food. The plates are rectangular, the walls have exposed brick, and you can go home feeling satisfied because you know what "umami" means, and you are pretty sure it must have applied to your burger. I've had a better hamburger at the truck "Neri's Curbside Cravings." A better, more creative hamburger for less than half the price. And there's something a just a little bit charming about eating a messy Filipino hamburger out of a carton on the side of the road.

We've been here a few times and generally enjoyed ourselves. I've had the Umami Burger both times and enjoyed it. The sweet potato fries are good. Not sure what the hype is about though. Also not sure why they need valet parking when the spaces are 20 feet from the front door. I recommend trying the place if you haven't been before. Also try saving yourself the trouble and parking on the street.

Delicious burgers.  I've tried The Umami Burger and the So Cal burger - both were great.  My favorite is the Port & Stilton - great flavor, ultra tender, nice textures and a perfect portion.   The sides are just ok.  I like the creativity in stacked presentation of the fries, which were the thickest fries I've had. Great selection of root beers and cream sodas. They even have Mexican bottled Coke. I read a few reviews knocking the service... and I'd have to agree with them.  I had to ask for our pickles and aioli 3 times (both times I've been to the restaurant!), but its not the type of place you expect high level service anyway.  Regardless, I enjoyed the food and I'd definitely return.

This place is small, but a good find if you like burgers. Kinda pricey for some ($3 for 9 french fries), but the burgers have amazing taste. I tried the SoCal Burger on a recent afternoon and yum yum yum. I loved it. You can tell that a lot work has gone into the prep of it. A server even shared that they make the cheese in house. It's fun because they also carry nostalgic soda. It's comfy and intimate. I would definitely return to try their chef's other concoctions. It's a new spot so go check it out!

We went here last night to grab a quick bite to eat a little before 10, thinking we might not make it because the website says they close at 10 pm.  But I guess that's the best time to go because we got good parking and we got our food right away. My husband ordered the umami burger and i had the truffle burger.  We both liked the truffle burger better.  Next time, I definitely need to order it well done. I loved having Real Coke (cane sugar) with it too.   It's different and I understand why a lot of people like it but if this is how you like your burger you should try the hamburgesa frita at Felix Continental Cafe in Old Town Orange...it's cheaper.

It was tasty no doubt. I got the Manly Burger with bacon lardons and fried onion strings. The beef patty was substantial and perfectly cooked to medium. I dig the idea of the bacon lardons as they distribute the bacon evenly over the burger, you don't lose that whole strip of bacon on your first bite wishing there was more to go around. I asked for the roasted garlic aioli but it didn't come on my burger. Instead it had a bit of dijon mustard, which on a burger isn't really my favorite thing. I also got the tempura onion rings with my order which were just as you would think but nothing I haven't had before. I appreciate the fact that they have real sugar soda's as a Mexican Coke is just about the perfect accompaniment to a burger and fried goods. So food was just fine but they lost a star due to service. Not inattentive but just rough around the edges. They would just dash over to your table and get you in and out. I've driven by and noticed that this place is quite busy but I came off hours and there weren't many in the restaurant. At least crack a bit of a smile and exchange some pleasantries would be nice.  I was also sitting by the register and almost all I could hear was someone complaining about not wanting to work that day. Would come back again for the burger just don't know if it's worth the wait during the more hectic hours of the day.

I had the special of the day that I went and it was DELICIOUS. The burger was cooked perfectly, the toppings were delicious, the bun was chewy. It is probably one of the best burgers I have had in LA. The service was great, almost to the point of being too attentive, and the side items were a little hit and miss. They had delicious iced green tea and onion rings, but I was not a big fan of their french fries as they were just big rectangular strips of potato that were not very crispy.

Umami's got some of the best burgers in town if you're willing to shell out $8-11 which is steep by my burger standards.  However the key is in their treatment of the meat.  The triple pork burger is by far my favorite here with its rich pork exterior and savory chorizo center.  They grind all their own meats using high grade beef and pork products for the patties.   The pickle plate is excellent and seasonal.  Last time I had a plate with pickled watermelon rind as one of the choices.  Both juicy and mildly sour, it definitely agreed with my palette.  The onion rings are tasty as well if you don't mind the pool of grease at the bottom of the bowl.  Well if you're eating a burger already, that shouldn't bother you. Check it out if you get a chance, the truffle burger is also another great choice

Umami Burger = delicious. The cheese disc thing that's inside is my favorite part. I haven't tried any of the other burgers yet because I really like the Umami one. The side dishes aren't too exciting - stick to the burgers. BYOB = cool. Service = nice, but slow. No immediate sense of a seating system. If you don't go inside and say something to the waiters, you're liable to sit outside waiting for a long time.

Don't go on Mondays... their meat supplier's delivery schedule tends to be hit or miss, so they didn't have any pork for lunch today.  AND I went specifically for their pork burger.   And now the main points: I had the Port and Stilton burger.  The meat was cooked perfectly, and was juicy and delicious.  The bun was soft and buttery.  The blue cheese and caramelized onions really tied the whole burger together in a subtle, but flavorful way.  Nothing was overpowering and the burger really had a great flavor.   I'd say the size of the burgers were decent.  But some with larger appetites may leave hungry if you go sans side orders... which leads me to my next few points. Skip the side orders... at least the fries and the onion rings.  The fries are pretty thick, but short.  And you only get about 8 or 9 pieces.  Fries are nothing worth writing home about.  The onion rings were even less memorable.  The tempura batter was light, but not so much flakey.  The batter had a hard time staying on the onion ring itself.  And think I only got about 4 medium sized rings.  And both the fries and onion rings were kinda bland too.  You could bath them in ketchup or other condiments, but read on... And now, the condiments that come with your side orders... one per side order?  Really?  You're gonna charge $3 for 8 fries and then limit me to one condiment per side order?  What's with the nickel and diming?  And can I please get my condiments in a small saucer or something?  They bring them to you on those plastic soup spoons you find at asian restaurants.   And the ketchup sucks.  They have their own twist on ketchup that adds spices and what not, but just because you add stuff to something, it doesn't necessarily make it better.  That's the case with the Umami Ketchup- the seasoning in the ketchup didn't work well together.  At first I was like "Wow, that's different.  Lots of flavors are in the ketchup... but it really doesn't taste that good... and it was watery!"  I'm sorry, but ketchup needs to be thick and viscous so they can stick to your fries- Heinz had it right in their commericals.  I'd suggest the Garlic Aioli over their ketchup. The green ice tea was way too sweet... wish they would have told me it was sweetened before I ordered it.  Really, who sweetens green tea?  Limited selection of soft drinks and soda as well. The parking is so-so, but the place is small.  Luckily, there wasn't much of a crowd when I went, so seating and parking wasn't an issue. All in all, the burger itself was awesome, everything else not so much...

Depending on the time you go to Umami, you could end up waiting hours to get seated. I suggest if you do wait to go in at normal dinner/lunch time you should definately BYOB and drink while you wait. That's the lovely thing about Umami, they are more than happy with you bringing your own alcoholic beverages. They don't serve any and therefore if you bring your own bottle of wine or 6 pack of beer they have no issues. But they do have regular drinks such as diet coke & they also serve Mexcian coke. Moving on, they have a good variation of burgers. I have to admit that the Hatch burger was probably one of the best burgers I've ever tasted. It has the green chiles that were spicy but not too much. The meat itself is top choice and is always cooked perfectly. I've also had the Truffle Burger which is something you could never find anywhere else. Their onion rings are battered in tempura mix so they are actually a little less greasy than the normal onion ring. They also are always the perfect circle and taste great with their ketchup and or their aiole sauce. Their fries are quite delicious as well. I definately recommend this place to whoever loves burgers.

I went here for lunch today and was not that impressed for a few reasons: 1.) the woman sitting next to me found a piece of brillo pad in her burger. 2.) The burger tasted like it was seasoned with MSG + Worcestershire sauce. Makes total sense though considering MSG is an Umami taste.

Umami gets points just for the creativity of their burgers.  The parmesan crisp in the Umami burger really makes it tasty, and the SoCal burger is definitely one to remember (although it doesn't have the magic of an in-n-out burger...can anything really compare?).   The portions are a little small for a $10 burger, but the taste is worth it.  Of course, I tried their Casablanca burger (a lamb burger with a bunch of ish in it - apricots, pomegranate something or other) and it was okay, but not great.  I'm still meaning to go back and get the Port and Stilton burger, but I'm sure that one will be good, because stilton cheese is way too tasty to not work. Onion rings are bomb, french fries are okay.  And Mexican coke!  How can you say no?

t's almost as if Owner Adam Fleischman wanted to open a sushi restaurant...then suddenly the day before opening he realized he couldn't get fish, so scrambling he got meat, so he opened a burger restaurant with an Asian theme. From the look alone it feels like you've entered an Americanized sushi bar. This feeling is further confirmed when they offer you Iced Green Tea and when you see they serve their sauces in Asian Soup Spoons.  Maybe I just don't get it, but this was totally impractical.  Not enough sauce can fit into the spoon so when you awkwardly dip a lot of the over filled sauce spills over the side onto the table. The menu's are rectangular like a sushi list. There are 8 burger options that range from $9 to $11. Seven of the burgers are a combination of some kind of beef.  Our server either did not know the cuts of beef in the grind or simply refused to tell us. All he kept saying is that the beef is a combination of a bunch of meats with Skirt Steak for the fat.  So we're thinking Skirt Steak ground with unnamed beef parts...doesn't sound appetizing. Besides beef, they do a pork burger, No. 5 Burger, and they also serve a Turkey Confit Burger.  Both might be good options if you wanna stay away from those unnamed beef parts. We took our chances. We ordered the Manley Burger, rare.  It includes, beer cheddar cheese, smoked salt onion "stringd" and bacon lardons".  We also ordered the Umami Burger, rare which comes with "umami x6 - our signature burger you will crave this one."  We also went with an order of  the Hand Cut Fries and the Malt Liquor Tempora Onion Rings. First came the Iced Green Tea which was delicious and surprisingly sweet. It tasted like it was sweetened by Agave Nectar or Honey, which kept it sweet but not over whelming like Sugar. The Burgers followed in about 10 minutes. Both burgers were tall, but not huge, maybe 4 inches in high but only about 3.5 inches in diameter, like a Double Double.  And to me $10 bucks is too much to pay for a double double.  I want a burger that's made for a man.  Something that looks intimidating and I probably won't finish.  This is not Umami. The Manley Burger was cooked perfectly at Medium Rare, which is why I ordered it rare...everyone seems to over shoot the cooking temperatures. The meat had a great flavor but crumbled inside the bun upon biting into it. This is a product of either not packing the meat tightly enough or grinding it too thin. The toppings were tasty and the bun was good and held together.  However it was a bit too greasy. The Umami Burger was cooked to medium well. When we told the server he said "OK" walked away and never came back. He never apologized nor did he tell Owner Adam who was wandering around the restaurant. The Fries were super thick, under cooked and served in a miso soup bowl. They were well seasoned, however were more like smooth long tater tots than french fries. Not to my liking.  The Onion Rings were delicious, very salty but I say that in a good way. The Garlic Aioli was great!  The Umami Ketchup, which they make themselves, was too thin and wasn't as good as regular Heinz Ketchup. I wanted the Heinz... Umami Burger is ok, it's not great and it's surely not the best in LA, but if you're in the area and there is nothing else I guess it's fine, if you want to pay a lot for a tiny burger.

Very small inside, so going during lunch can be a challenge.  It wasn't too long of a wait though.  Inside is nothing to write home (or in a review) about. Since this was  my first visit, I just stuck with the standard Umami burger and didn't branch out.   The burger was delicious, if slightly pinker than I'd normally go.  Fries were really good too.  Service was adequate.  Paying $2.50 for valet to move your car 20' is a bit absurd, but there is no parking and that is pretty cheap. Price for the burger, fries, diet coke, and a desert was about $18.  The burger itself was $9. Overall, very enjoyable and very tasty burger.  I still like 8oz better as you have more options for your burger and better ambiance.

This place is a joke. Way overpriced  for the food. I had the Umami burger and onion rings and both are below average in terms of taste. Don't get me started on the umami ketchup.... If you want a good burger go to Father's Office. Or even In N Out.... or even McD....

I have been searching for a burger comparable to those found in NYC at places like Minetta Tavern, etc...AND THIS IS IT! The beef is very high quality and dense.  The crust on the meat is fantastic.  The bun is soft and shiny.  Condiments were perfect. I ordered the standard Umami burger which came with a cheese crisp, portobello mushroom, and carmelized onions.  It was about 6 oz patty, but more than enough to fill the tank.  Very rich, flavorful, memorable. THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO!

Round 1- Honestly, even though it tasted great and was cooked medium rare to perfection, I expected a little more from the original Umami Burger. I also love washing down a good burger n fries with a icy cold beer but they don't serve alcoholic beverages. Definitely will come back tho to try the other burgers on the menu. http://www.avocadoLA.com

I adore Umami Burger.  The taste is amazing, the prices are not too bad, and though the burger is small, by the time I'm done with one burger and half an order of fries, I'm actually pretty damn sated. The only thing I can add onto the pile of everyone else's reviews is my personal preference, which is the Truffle Burger, mmmm.  I normally prefer my burgers more elaborate and piled high with good stuff, but the first time I ever came here, I ordered this one accidentally (really.) and even after trying a few of their other burgers, this simple but luxe burger is the one I can't quit! The other thing I'd add, which is what keeps this from being a full-on five-star review: every so often, something really annoying happens at this location.  The first time was when I tried to bring my mom here on a Sunday night at 8pm -- when we pulled into the parking, the valet ran out to tell us that, for REAL, they have "run out of food."  I mean, I appreciate that they tell us this before we get inside, but I've never heard of a restaurant straight up running out of food!  This was pretty soon after they had opened, so hopefully that kink is worked out. The other time was last night though: for once, we weren't able to find street parking, and so we pulled into the lot to valet.  Again, the valet (the poor bearers of bad news!) came out to ask us if we were getting take-out.  When we said, confused, "no... eat in?" he stated that they were closed, except for take-out.  It was about 9:15pm, and when I noted that the website (but really, I meant the Yelp page) said they closed at 10pm, he offered, "ohh, they're working on changing that. But we're really closed."  It was a sad sad situation, especially when you can look in and see others enjoying their burgers. So, please learn from my mistake!  If you're craving their luscious goodness on a Sunday night, they close at 9pm, not 10pm!  And maybe call first to make sure they still have food.

Despite the 1 hour wait (there were 4 of us, so it's understandable), the food was totally worth it!! I had the Turkey Miso burger (roasted baba ganoush, toasted garlic & fresh ground turkey) accompanied by malt liquor tempura onion rings w/ roasted garlic aioli dipping sauce. OMG... HEAVEN!!! Seriously, the BEST turkey burger I've EVER had in my entire life. I'll definitely be returning again!!!

Definitely not cheap, but the burgers are worth the money.   My dad and I went in for a burger after a review of it had been on my bedroom wall for more than a year.  The servers were incredibly personable and immediately make you feel at home.  The menu is very simple, but they do allow for some customization.  My dad ordered the truffle burger ($11) and I ordered the soy veggie burger ($9 or $10) without the aloli (it's like sophisticated mayonnaise).  We also got the malt onion rings and the hand cut fries.  For drinks, the place has about a dozen real cane sugar sodas that come in glass bottles for around $3.   My burger tasted great, but the patty didn't really have much of a solid consistency.  Upon cutting or handling it, the patty just fell apart, sadly, making it hard to eat.  But it still tasted pretty good.  My dad's burger, on the other hand, was absolutely delicious.  Maybe it's just because I have a thing for truffles, but I had a piece and it was amazing.  The sides were both good as well.  If you have to choose one, though, I'd go with the malt onion rings.

After hearing all the hype about it, my friends and I are excited to try umami burger.  Service was great when we got there: polite and efficient. We were seated almost immediately. The waiter was friendly.  The beet salad we ordered arrived first and it was extraordinary ... at least for me. I love beet. And this beet salad was amazing ! Sliced like slivers of meat, with arugula and a fresh heap of gorgonzola cheese and finished with truffle oil and a sprinkle of roasted nuts. Easily my favorite dish of the night. The truffle burger I ordered was good. Not mind blowing good... but it was good.  You can really taste and smell the truffle (oil).  The umami that my friend had was really good. Really good primarily because it tastes so unique with its layers of tastes and flavors. It's slightly sweet and tangy.  A little crispy. Very interesting. The onion rings were light and crispy. I liked it.  The sweet potato fries were good ( you can't really go wrong with sweet potato fries ). The hand-cut fries was the disappointment of the night for me. It was too thick i thought. I guess it's good for those who like the taste of potatoes rather than crunchy fries.   My only gripe is the lack of condiments. 1 spoonful of ketchup per order of sides !!! Seriously ! no choice of aoli, ranch, honey mustard etc.  But overall, it was a decent meal.  Maybe not quite all the hype but still a good meal.

I really don't see what the hype  is about. I tried the so-cal burger and while it's a decent burger, it's nowhere close to the best burger I've ever had. really overpriced. the onion rings and sweet potato were pretty good tho. worth it to try, but don't really see myself wanting to go back anytime soon.

Located conveniently off of Wilshire, it's a prime location for a lot of the employees in the high rise buildings along the main street, and is within walking distance of where I work. If you can, I would suggest walking in lieu of driving to the restaurant as it's valet parking only at the La Brea lot (it's only $2.00, but still), and when it's busy it's impossible to find street parking. The first time I went to Umami I was with a group of four and we arrived at around 6:30, a reasonable dinner hour that we had assumed wouldn't have the place too crowded. We were wrong, unfortunately, and so we were seated at the bar in this teeny tiny room with a counter top running along the walls with high stools. Ideal if you were by yourself or with one other friend, awkward when you're trying to talk to three other people. The waiter wasn't particularly accommodating when we asked about available tables for four people, and in the end we just decided to stay at the bar. I ordered an Umami Burger, the classic, and I tried a bit of my friend's Port & Stilton. Both were great. I loved the Parmesan crisp on the Umami Burger, and the patty was cooked a perfect medium-rare so it was juicy and tender. The Port & Stilton was very rich, could be mistaken for being too heavy, but I loved the flavor combination of the buttery cheese and the hearty beef patty. The sweet potato fries were alright, pretty standard fare, but I liked the onion rings a lot more. They were a bit difficult to eat because they were so large and so I ended up using a knife and fork. The dessert, however, is what stole the show, and it isn't even made at the restaurant. Ice cream sandwiches from Milk in toffee coffee and red velvet were split between four people, along with a homemade Ding Dong dessert cake from Cake Monkey. The sandwiches were so DE-LICIOUS that I ended up paying a visit directly to the source not long after. My second experience was better on the service, not as great on the food. I feel like eating at a venue sized like Umami on La Brea is better suited to a meal for two, which is exactly what I had when I grabbed lunch with a coworker. We were seated immediately despite the lunch rush at about 12:30, and our waitress was very attentive throughout our meal and promptly refilled our drinks as soon as they were nearing half-full. I ordered a Turkey Miso Burger for a little variety and then ended up wishing I had stuck to the classic Umami. It was WAY too salty, even for something infused with miso; I had to keep sipping at my water and had it refilled quite often. The saltiness overpowered the flavor of the entire patty so much that I couldn't even taste the garlic garnish, and while I was kind of let down, I rallied with an ice cream sandwich which redeemed the burger to some extent. As a note, don't feel scandalized by the portion size of the burger when you first see it. It may look small but with a side order of fries or some dessert, you WILL get full.

U is for Umami Umami is a quaint little burger joint located on S La Brea Blvd and Wilshire Blvd.  This one particular location was pretty small although the décor is very polished and modern.  (Unlike the Hollywood location which is HUGE and has a full bar inside; and the Cahuenga location which is a location more prone to relaxing and people watching.  But alas, all Umami locations look aesthetically pleasing, so you pretty much can't go wrong).  Unfortunately, this location did not have a bar, ergo no alcohol and no happy hour, which is exactly what my friend and I were looking for.   My friend and I decided to go to Umami during a Friday night rush hour, so as typical with Los Angeles traffic, expect to wait in front of red lights aplenty.  Additionally, parking around the area requires a permit, so the best option would be to go valet at a 2.50 surcharge per vehicle (which isn't bad).  No reservations, no wait and no dress code; considering it was 6pm, our timing was perfect.  Open until 10pm except Sunday (9pm).  No outside seating (unlike the Hollywood location) This chain is definitely kid-friendly although their palates probably wouldn't be fond of the various flavors of the burgers.  This location didn't strike me as fancy, considering the décor was very modern.  However, it felt a little cramped because this location in particular was relatively small.  It's a trendy spot I should say, not too loud and not quiet.   Umami burger is home to a good variety of burgers ranging from Truffle Burgers to Sriracha Burgers (the 'El Diablo'), to Mushroom Burgers, and Plain 'Umami' Burgers.  They're known for their burgers so it goes without saying, get one.  As for their sides, they have fries, onion rings, and tater tots.  And their drink selection was actually quite impressive.  They have Mexican Coke (in which it uses real sugar instead of High Fructose Corn Syrup), Real Sodas (old-skool glass bottle type sodas), and your typical fountain drinks.  And for dessert, from what I recall, there were ice cream sandwiches courtesy of Milk ('See my previous 'Milk' review'), among a few others which I can't remember. I ordered the El Diablo (Medium Rare burger with fried onions, bleu cheese, and sriracha. Yum!) and my friend got the Truffle Burger (Medium Well burger with [some type of white] cheese and truffle oil.  Hint of garlic flavor.  Yum! Again!].  Since it was my friends first time at Umami, I suggested to try something more flavorful instead of the signature Umami burger (the Umami is good but just too plain for my tastes).  She loved it.  The Truffle Burger, cooked medium well, was dripping with truffle oil and a layer of melted cheese was icing on the cake.  I've gotten this burger before and it never disappoints.  If you've got an appetite for garlic flavored meats, get this one. SIDENOTE: Please try not to get a burger cooked other than medium rare, because that's how Umami burgers are meant to be eaten.  It even says so on the fine print in the menu. I got the El Diablo, which is a special on rotation a few times a year, and every time they have it on special, I pounce on it.  I love sriracha on almost everything and topped with their medium rare patties?  It goes great.  At first I was put off with the blue cheese and onions because I thought it was a weird combination, but it works surprisingly well.  If you're adventurous try this out (if it's available, of course) We also got the tempura onion rings with Umami ketchup.  The onion rings are just your average, run-of-the-mill, onion rings, but there was more tempura batter, so don't expect a thick 'crunch'.  The ketchup was very tasty, but .50 for extra ones. After our delicious burgers, which we wolfed down in a matter of seconds (more on this later), we ordered the Milk Ice Cream Sandwiches, Mint-Choco Chip to be exact.  I needn't repeat my review of Milk, but let's just say, it was the perfect way to top off an astoundingly delicious meal. Fortunately, the service here is top notch (much like the other locations) and the staff was very warm and friendly.  Bonus!  The wait wasn't long and they were very friendly. Now, unfortunately, here come the rants.  Unfortunately, the burgers tend to run a bit steep, ranging from 10 to 13 dollars for only ONE burger.  And since the burger is just delicious (Yes, I went there), customers tend to gobble it within a few seconds.  Needless to say, unfortunately, you don't really get your money's worth.  The burgers are pretty expensive.  The ice cream sandwich however was the same price at Milk, so no arguing there.  The bill came out to 40 dollars (plus tax), for two burgers, tempura onion rings, a soda, and an Ice-cream sandwich.  Very expensive indeed.   But don't let the price steer you clear from some amazing burgers.  I actually consider Umami Burger one of the top three burgers in Los Angeles, so please, give it a shot.  It will not disappoint.  (But the price and difficulty of parking, will)

First time here and had the umami & truffle burger... O M F G!!! It's like I've been missing out all this time!! The best burger for me hands down! And don't forget to order sides. We had the tater tots (special off the menu)--it's a like a flavor explosion in your mouth!  Dip it with either the dijon mustard or the ketchup (which i understand is house-made) and fantastical food fireworks go off in your mouth! Personally hyperbole annoys me so you gotta taste it for yourself.

I have heard all the hype for this place, but actually never read any of the reviews here on yelp. I wished I had. My friends and I stopped at this location on a whim as we were trying to kill time before an event we were attending. We wanted to eat light so we shared a burger among the three of us. We simply got the Umami burger, cheesy tator tots, and sweet potato fries. The fries were average. The cheesy tator tots were AMAZING. I would go there just for the cheesy tator tots! Haha. But I wouldn't go here just for the burger. Perhaps it was because we went with the normal Umami Burger. or perhaps it was because one of my friends didn't like very bloody things so we just got medium. The burger was good, but  was NOT AMAZING. I also want to add that just because the burger is optimally supposed to be consumed at medium rare, that does not mean a patty cooked at medium should not taste good either. I'd been to plenty of places where the patty would taste fine (e.g., Father's Office). I would have given the place 4 stars; however, two major minuses come to mind. 1) the location is plain awkward. We sat outside on the patio. But the patio is behind a fence and near the busy street. I understand we chose to sit outside, but we wished we hadn't. It's just an observation that I think they shouldn't have an outside area right on the corner of the street. They should just not give customers the choice. It doesn't feel like a restaurant's outside eating area with the loud traffic. At times, I felt like a car was going to barrel into our table at any minute. 2) In addition to that, the service was pretty awful. The hostess was very nice and friendly. But the server was not that great. He took our order just fine. But then it took forever for the food to come out.  Two tables who ordered AFTER us received their food first AND he really rushed us. He cleared the plates before we were done eating (we were still working on the fries and tator tots!). so he took our burger plates. Fine. Then, he took the fries without asking if we were done! Then he dropped off the check as I picked up the last tator tot right when he started taking it away. It was so rude. It wasn't like the restaurant was busy either. In fact, there were just 3 tables filled outside and the inside seemed very empty too - like a handful of customers. Pfft.

A friend took me to Unami claiming it was the best burger he's ever had. When someone makes such a bold claim about anything, it usually results in a huge disappointment. Nothing different about this one. We wanted to try all the burgers because each seemed interesting. Between the four of us, we ordered: 1) Unami Burger 2) Truffle Burger 3) Socal Burger 4) Port & Stilton Burger 5) Hatch Burger 6) Onion Rings 7) Fries 8) Ice Cream Sandwich Burger patties were juicy and had a decent flavor but could have used a little more texture. Other than the Socal burger, none of the flavors meshed well. I guess some things are just not meant to be... truffle and ground beef? The sides were okay, nothing special. Condiments were horrible. If you're going to make your own ketchup, make sure it taste good before you start serving it to your customers. Seriously, for a place that serves burgers and fries, good ketchup is is pretty dang important. Tip to Management - call Heinz and set up an account. I'm sure they'll give you a good deal. The actual restaurant itself was comfortable enough with ample spacing. It was a bit dark, but got use to it after 10 minutes. Servers were friendly. Food was not worth it. Island's is much better and cost less. If you want to splurge on a burger, go to Tantalum in Long Beach for their Kobe Burger ($18).

You HAVE to try this place! The burgers are SO good, I had the standard burger and my bf had the truffle burger. After a couple of "mmm"s there was complete silence as we gobbled down the deliciousness. The sweet potato fries should be sold by the bucket, because they were amazingly sweet, crispy, literally the best fries I have ever had the pleasure of eating. It was reasonably priced, about $8-$10 a burger. I have seen reviews saying that the burgers are two small and they are not very large, but the whole idea behind umami is that it gives a meatiness or fullness to the dish. We both felt full but not gross, a feeling that has been well sought after in my food excursions. The only reason I do not give Umami Burger 5 stars is because of dessert. I paid $4 for what is called a red velvet and raspberry cake monkey, which turned out to be a ding-dong with red velvet cake and raspberry frosting. Definitely not worth my four dollars! We will be coming back here many times over, but we just won't order dessert. :]

The second time I came, I ordered the Umami Burger and it was just ok. I think that the Hatch Burger had so many flavors, the chilies and the house cheeses had so much flavor that the Umami Burger just didn't seem to jump off. I also ordered the fry's and the fry's were great, but the house ketchup tasted more like tomato paste. It could have been off that day, but after I hyped up this place and took my wife she was disappointed. I gave this place 4 stars because the Hatch Burger was so great.

Didn't realize there were so many, but I went to this location, so I'll review this location. Hopefully I can sum up the many reviews into 1 helpful "overall" review: Parking: sucks, and adds $$$ to the already fairly high bill Service: fine - friendly; no issues. Sent burger back for being cold, and they were very cool about it. Taste: veggie burger was on of the weirdest I've had, but it was good in its different-ness. Coworker had SoCal Burger and said to enjoy it, as well. Sides were good - SP fries were solid, and the cheese tater tots were good, as well. Price/Value: what potentially sinks this place. Over $40 for two withOUT parking figured in yet?  No sides with the $11 small-ish burger?  A bit harsh... ...but, to try once to "test the hype," it's a fairly safe call for a restaurant choice.  Just be prepared for a fairly expensive, small-ish meal, and you won't be as frustrated post-meal as some.   Hey - - it's a trendy place in a trendy town, so just keep that in mind.

The menu is simple, but EVERYTHING is delicious. Don't mess with their burger concoctions, they are created thoughtfully and perfectly balanced. It's not the size of the burgers that makes them great. If you are looking for a big, greasy burger, go someplace else. The quality of the ingredients and the preparation is why you should check this place out. While it's not on the menu, there is a veggie burger called the Earth burger. It is totally why I am writing this review. Instead of the dry and bland frozen patty that I can't seem to get away from at other restaurants, this is a moist juicy homemade burger that is so juicy and meaty I had to double and triple check that I wasn't accidentally served the wrong burger. Don't mess with the toppings, it all goes perfectly together. This place is just what I want a burger place to be, great burgers, fries and specialty sodas, not to mention the Milk ice cream sandwiches. Love, love, love this place.

I really love the burgers here! They are excellent! Came here 3 or 4 times in the first 2 months of living here in LA. I want to try every burger here. The Umami is their signature burger and is very tasty! I have also had the Triple Pork Burger which was good but I don't think I would ever get it again. Not a fan of the Chorizo that was in it. The Manly Burger is pretty good. But I still would go for the Umami. But I think once I get try the Truffle Burger my opinion will change. It was sold out the last 2 times I was there. Their Fries and Onion Rings are really good too so don't forget to try those as well. I also liked the different bottled sodas they have.

I've tried Umami burger twice now and had mixed feelings about it. The first time I tried the Umami burger with fat fries and the second time I had the Socal Burger with onion rings. The Umami burger was flavorful and seemed very soft and lush biting into it. Both in the Umami burger and in the ketchup served with the fries there seemed to be a hint of vinegar. Although this taste seemed to complement others in the burger, in the ketchup it seemed to be overwhelming making it hard to enjoy the fries. With this meal I also had mexican coke which is of course delicious and made with real sugar. I enjoyed the Socal burger more so than the Umami burger. It had more flavor, the same lush texture, and was a bit more traditional. The onion rings had a very tasty batter on them however I was put off a little because they were dripping with excessive grease and in fact they were resting in a rather substantial puddle of grease in the tray they were served in. The ketchup served with the onion rings seemed more mild than the ketchup I experienced the first time so perhaps someone simply put too much vinegar in the batch I had on my first visit. I would give this restaurant 3 1/2 stars if I could. There are many good things about it and it is definitely worth a try however it is a tad expensive for burgers, the valet parking is kind of ridiculous, and small details kept this place from impressing me as much as I hoped.

Okay... So... We started with pickled veggies (beets were the best of the bunch). Then we moved on to the truffle burger and the umami burger and some sweet tater fries. Truffle burger was the bomb! Umami fell a little flat to us. Perhaps expectations were too high? Burgers were yummy by all means but on a 3.5 scale. They seemed a little pricey for the quantity.

Heard for awhile that this may be the best burger in the west. Took my girl and my nephews to wilshire district to try it. Liked the Asian flair design! My servers were slow, and less attentive than I would have liked. Especially that I spent $80 for burgers. The burger, were really good though! Parking was easy and I liked the k-town crowd. The phones never stopped ringing for deliveries and pick-ups Bathrooms were clean, I changed the 3 year olds diaper in the spacious, yet out of hand towels!!, bathroom I might return with a side date

The umami burger I ordered was so juicy that the juice actually made the bun soggy. I'm not sure if that's the intent. The side dishes were tasty! Cheesy tots, sweet potatoes fries, and onion rings.

The beef in the burger was amazing, the bun was ok not great. the original umami burger did not have much flavor just a bit tangy and the beef was super tender which is good i guess for a burger.  If you hate chewing this is the place to go. Still prefer burger lounge

I dream about these burgers in my mouth... They are all delicious and succulent in their own unique way.  Perfect texture and amount of juiciness.  I am partial to the Truffle, Hatch, and Turkey burgers myself.  They are pricey little mfers but are in the same price range as all the other competing high end burgers.  They are also a little on the smaller side - which I think actually optimizes the affect because it leaves you with just enough room left in the tummy craving for more and not leaving you feeling like a gluttonous piglet.   The sides (fries, onion rings, sweet potato fries, pickles) are decent and good for sharing and come with the option of different yummy dipping sauces.  For me, it's all about the burger at Umami, and would more often order 2 burgers and skip the sides.

Ordered the truffle burger cooked medium. Simple and so full of flavor. Slightly (and I emphasize the word slightly) on the salty side. Tried the Umami burger ordered by my friend but the truffle burger was definitely better. Did anyone notice a hint of black licorice/root beer flavor in the umami burger? It was distinct and surprisingly melded well all throughout. Not the best burger i've had but up there on my list of top 5 burger joints. Will return. It's better to street park.

My friend and I got to the restaurant around 8.  The restaurant was busy but it wasn't full, we were seated right away.  It is a fairly small space. We ordered Umami burger, truffle burger, and truffle cheese fries. The truffle fries is really good! It's thin cut so it's more than just 5 or 6 sticks and it was pretty flavorful. I think Umami burger is better than truffle burger, just by a little bit~ They r both good though except Umami burger has more ingredients in there (tomato, crispy cheese, portebello) so it created more layers to the taste.  Unlike truffle burger, which only has cheese and the patty. The downside of the burger is that the portion is really small. Probably only good for a girl's appetite.  It might take 2 burgers to fill a guy's stomache.

My classmate recommended Umami burger to me and after I saw that article on Yahoo about it I had to try it. Let's just say Umami Burger did not disappoint. The burger was so JUICY and SO GOOD! The Umami burger blended perfectly together, the bun is also unique and quite good. The side are good too. I like Smushed Potatoes(yes, that's right, Smushed Potatoes) and the sweet potato fries. The Onion Rings were alright. I also have had the manly burger and it was also TOO GOOD! I have to try the hash burger because my friend got it last time and just thinking about it right now is making me hungry!!!!!!

YES for fries and sweet potato fries and onion rings Service is friendly. Valet parking available, but there's plenty street spot for a small walk.

A mouth-watering orgasmic experience, but if you're a big eater like me... one burger will only fill 1/3 of your stomach. The burger size is about 1/3 lb. cooked medium rare with buns that have been trademarked with their logo that resembles a burger or even a lip...  Being that this was my first time, I fell for the obvious which was getting the signature Umami Burger.  Usually, I am a slow eater as I like to take the time to salivate my food and hone in on my taste buds but this was so good to the point where I actually finished my meal before my other friends.  I would like to make a note though that if you don't like any sweetness with your burger, I would not recommend this.  The sweet sensation comes from the caramelized onions integrated with ketchup so beware if you not likely in your burger patty.  If you do not get this, the other popular hit is definitely the truffle burger.  In regards to the sides, we got an order of the pickled platter, sweet potato fires, and cheesy tots (their special that night).  For the pickled platter, don't be fooled by the title as it was more than just your share of pickles... it consisted of beets, mushrooms, kimchi, and tomatoes.  Also, it is a definite must and should be made into law that you compliment your tots with the garlic aioli sauce.. word4lyfe. Overall, I would definitely come back... my only sad note to add would be the price...  although the burger was sex in my mouth... the size of it hinders me from shelling out another 11 dollars, but then again... I am a young and foolish person who is looking to take advantage of my fast metabolism.

Omgsh, omgsh, omgsh! My 3 nights stay in LA and this was def. my fav! Food: We sat down outside.  My friends ordered this pickle platter and I'm not much of a pickle fan but they did have an assortment of pickled veggies you can munch on. It ranged from actual pickles to kimchi. So if you're a pickle lover, I def. would recommend it! I ordered the TRUFFLE BURGER! which had a yummy truffle cheese along with truffle aioli sauce. SO YUMMY! you know the kind of food where you never ever want it to end cause it's so delicious? well...this was it! The buns were a brioche bun which is def. my fav bread! My friends ordered the umami burger (it's what their most famous burgers is).  My friend told me to take a bite of hers and it was def. really good (coming from a girl who doesn't like mushrooms).  We also ordered sweet potato fries along with their cheesy tots? i believe that's what it's called.  It's basically like a fried mashed potato.  It came with ketchup and i would rec. people to ask for this mayo aioli sauce to dip those yummy suckers.  The sweet potato fries were really good too but i'm not much of a fan. We also got the dessert! We got an ice cream sandwich (i know....people prob. wonder why the heck would we order an ice cream sandwich of all things).  The "bread" part of the sandwich was AWESOME! It kinda reminded me of a thinner macaron.  They had various flavors of ice cream and the toffee was chosen. Service: Our waitress was awesome! Super friendly and really knew the menu well.  The most impressive thing was when she listed the ice creams they had for their sandwiches.  We had to have her repeat it a couple of times because it was soo much! Hah.  When we were sitting outside, it got a little chilly cause the heater wasn't doing much for me since i was sitting further away from it.  She told us we could move the tables closer to the heating lamps (which in general...people wouldn't care..but she was nice enough to suggest it). Ambiance:  It was very nice sitting outside. A wee bit chilly but tolerable.

I came in hungry and left starving! Does that make sense? It was more of an appetizer than an actual meal. It was just SO small. The burger itself was good but not exceptional; it was very juicy. For $10 a burger, it was definitely not worth it. I'd rather be full. 3 stars for taste. Service, on the other hand, was pretty bad. It was hard to get their attention, and when i asked for sauce for my fries, it took forever. Bad all around. The only reason I would ever go back is cause my girlfriend loves this place.

Small location and spare service. Like their original a lot more. The Greenbird is excellent if a little too greasy for my taste. Sides are expensive but I still think umami takes the bun for most creative burgers in town. That said, it's a very unique burger menu that I don't find myself craving too often just because it's out there. But I always enjoy the taste when we do go.

What a gourmet burger should be: inventive, perfectly executed and worthy of the hype. A friend and I split three burgers: the traditional Umami Burger, the Triple Pork (ground pork, chorizo and bacon) and the Hatch (green chilies and cheese). All were served medium rare on a soft bun that had the perfect combination of size and strength. The burgers had a richness and decadence that you don't experience very often. Ever, really. Every burger I tried was my favorite, until I went to the next one. Some people probably can't handle the rareness and savory flavors, but it was all up my alley. We got a side order of fries (hot, crispy and delicious) served with umami ketchup that was unique and addictive. We also got the sweet potato fries that were pretty average, accompanied by the jalapeno ranch which was forgettable. All in all, I'm a fan. If you live in LA, there are probably a million great places to eat all the time. if you're just in town for a few days, like I was, make this a lunchtime spot and you probably won't regret it.

Umami burger tastes good, but overall overpriced and the portions are too small.   I ordered an umami burger and I tasted some of the bleu cheese burger, and I liked the umami burger, but I could easily have eaten 3 of them.  I would not recommend this place if you're hungry.  Maybe if you want something light, but even then, at $10/burger, there are better deals out there.  You pay less for a bigger and equally as tasty burger at the counter so I'd say pass on this place.   The wait time for a seat seemed to be awhile, and the service was ok.  On the positive side, the sweet potato fries were great.

so, i finally got to try umami after amazing reviews from my friends! i had a little date with my mother and it was pretty good! i ended up getting the UMAMI burger because everyone talks about it and it was DEFINITELY the right choice. the burger buns are fluffy and yummy and the beef was amazinggggg! you can taste the difference here. and so i decided to be greedy and i got myself the sweet potato fries AND onion rings.......BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE! they're made to perfection and it's so crispy and delicious! one thing that kind of ticked me off was that they charge a little more for their sauces =/ bleh. and their assortment of pickles is SO delish, it complimented the burger sososo well! it definitely wasn't a waste paying $3 or $4 more on the meal. i'm definitely going back for some more when i have the time!!

I skipped over to Umami Burger for the first time with a few friends a few weeks ago.  Yes, the burgers are good.  Yes, the sauce is good.  Yes, the ambiance is nice. No, the beer selection is not great.  I'll elaborate... While the burgers do taste great, and thankfully are not over cooked, if you compare them in size/taste to say Father's Office or the York, you won't be satisfied.  That being said, the burger was still much better than your average restaurant burger, but plan on getting a side to satisfy your appetite. Everyone raves about the sauce at Umami, because it is a secret recipe and they use it in lieu of ketchup.  I really enjoyed something being used instead of ketchup, and I think the sauce pairs really well with their fries.  Now, I know the recipe is secret, but It would have been nice if the waiter didn't act like the sauce was a controlled substance.  We were barely given enough for our fries, and when we asked for more the waiter looked like he would have to ask his boss. If you're not allergic to hipsters, or have a good allergy medication, you'll like the ambiance at Umami.  There were a few times where the hipster vibe was a little over the top, but it was very casual and enjoyable. The beer.  If you're like me you like to experiment by pairing new beers with burgers.  It would seem Umami likes to control what beers are paired with their food, and therefor keep their selection slim.  I think they could do with adding some lesser known micro-brews to their menu for people to sample. All in all, a good place!

My review is long overdue.... I know people are are skeptical of Umami.. it's a pricey and on the smaller size burger, but Umami uses high quality ingredients in their food, which you can taste.  I've had the Umami burger, Manly burger, sweet potato fries, cheesy tater tots, and smashed potatoes.  All very very yummy things to try! Try not to get there during peak hours... it gets very busy and the wait is ridiculous.  If you haven't tried Umami it's a must stop at least once so you can have your own opinions about it.

Umami burger seems like they're off to a good, a welcome addition to the neighborhood and to LA's gourmet burger scene. The pros:  the triple pork burger is a work of genius.  Porky, smokey and juicy, with a perfect char on the outside for a touch of crispness.  My world is a better place with this burger in it.   Also, the space is attractive in a minimalist way, the staff is very friendly and the prices are quite reasonable. The cons:  they're clearly still working the kinks out, which is only naturally for a business in its first few weeks.  Service can be a bit slow.  At 7:30 on a Saturday night, I snagged their last portion of fries.  It seemed a little early in the evening for a burger joint to run out.   I may have been better off without them.  They're lovely to look at but devoid of much flavor aside from salt.  A more traditional belgian "frites" would make a better accompaniment for their excellent burger.  Neither the house-made ketchup nor the garlic aioli helped much. Still, the pros more than outweighed the cons.  I look forward to going back soon and tasting my way through more of their menu.

I ate at Umami Burger tonight, it was absolutely delicious and take it from me, I normally don't eat beef or pork and usually only do on a special occasion.  We arrived at 8:30, I ordered the Umami and my friend had the Pork, we split a side of onion rings and fries as well as the house pickles and 2 tasty root beers.  By the way I don't drink soda either but these root beers are yummy. The food was served in a timely manner and was absolutely delicious, every bit of it, including dessert and drinks.  It was also the perfect amount of food for me and I appreciate the precision in that respect.  Great presentation, friendly staff, nice atmosphere and very reasonable prices!  I even tried a bite of my friends Pork Burger and that was a tasty and spicy beast!  I'll definitely be back soon to try another item on the menu.  Oh yes, very simple and easy menu to help you make a fast decision for those of us who can never decide what we want and waffle with the waiter or waitress for half an hour, peppering him or her with questions about this and that.  But I digress...  :) Hats off to the Chef, a tasty Burger is much appreciated by someone who normally doesn't eat beef, so thank you!

Because there was SO much hype surrounding Umami, I tried it out the other night to see for myself. It's NOT worth the hype. NOT one of those eateries where you get the most for your buck. $3 for fries - all 6 of them. $9 for Umami burger -  very delicious, I must say, but not worth $9. Organic ketchup wasn't tasty - Trader Joe's has better. The food was good, but I left feeling like I spent too much for something that was ok. Trust me, I'm a foodie, and have spent a pretty penny or a good meal.

FOOD: We tried to order the Chili Burger but couldn't because they "ran out of chili" so we decided on the Umami and Triple Pork Burgers with fries and onion rings. The burgers were both enjoyable but far from spectacular. Albeit they were moist and juicy, they surely did not live up to all of the yelp hype or justify the prices. 9 two inch fries for $3 is a joke. Although they are good, their thickness prevents them from being crispy. The 5 onion rings for $2.5 aren't anything to brag about either. The homemade ketchup aka canned tomato paste and vinegar wasn't enough to make them notable. SERVICE: A-W-F-U-L! Visited on a Saturday afternoon and had to wait 15 minutes just to order. The wait wouldn't have been so bad if the restaurant wasn't so awkwardly laid out so you can't help but to feel in the way wherever you stand. After we ordered we then had to wait an additional 45 minutes before our food arrived. 45 minutes for two burgers?!?!? That is plain ridiculous. During our wait we were also told that they ran out of onion rings and offered no substitution. However, when we asked for our money back they decided that they could make more. WTF people?!? Are you kidding me? My favorite part is that when we were finished with our meal, around 2 PM, we overheard the waiter informing the table next to us that they were going to have to close because they had just run out of meat. Umami Burger, I hope for your own sake that you have gotten better since our visit back in March. Otherwise, shame on LA for calling you one of the new hip and trendy hot spots.

This is one of the rare situations in which I'm giving a place 3 stars, but at the same time will almost certainly go back... Why?  My burger was really great!  I ordered the SoCal burger which has lettuce, tomato, home-made American cheese, and some kind of sundried tomato spread.  The meat was extremely juicy and fresh, and the bun was fluffy and delicious.   So why am I only giving this joint 3 stars?  Several reasons: 1) $9 for a little burger is pretty steep. 2) My friend asked for his burger medium-well, and it was medium rare.  Seriously, mine was medium rare (which I asked for), but his looked more rare if anything. 4) They don't have anything good to go with the burger.  The fries and onion rings looked crappy and are tiny portions. 3) The service was pretty mediocre (not that I really care) They should really just serve these burgers in a 'walk up and order' setting and dispense with the whole trendy/fancy restaurant/bad service thing.  Still coming back for more burgers though...just don't expect a big tip...

amazing gourmet burgers, special fries, tempura onion rings (that melt in your mouth), and assorted pickle trays.  The service was great, and we ate outside with our own beer. We all had amazing burgers, which are a nice smaller size, with the freshest meat.  I had a truffle cheese burger with truffle spread, and the pickle tray included amazing watermelon rind, okra, and hearts of palm.  The portions are small but the highest quality, and they also offer ice cream from MILK.

Initial observations: Interesting decor- not really sure what the designer was thinking. Very different ambiance- in a good way. Friendly service, kind of soft-spoken. Food: Smaller than your average burger, but wayyyy more attention to detail. High flavor content. Super greasy. All of the burgers on the menu are very different, so really I would probably pick whatever goes along the lines of your tastes. Conclusion: Higher price burger suggests higher quality burger, and it seems to hold true based on Truffle (liked alot) and Umami Burger (not my type, tastes like Italian- maybe like a fancy meatball sub). Afterthought: Would probably not eat here often in the interest of living longer, but it was worth the day or two of shortening of my life. Go workout after this one if you can resist the food coma. If I went back I'd probably want to try the bacon cheddar. For more reviews visit: http://www.sixtaste.com

For bare-bones burgers Pie 'N Burger is the best in LA.  For unique burgers Umami is the best in LA. Food: The Manly Burger - these guys aren't afraid to season...in a really great way.  Flavors are really balanced and the beef tastes...beefy!  All burgers are on the small side, but because they are perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, and juicy they're worth the sticker price.  They're also nicely constructed: not too thick or too thin.  The manly burger has bacon "lardons," fried onion strings, and cheddar.  Great flavor and tons of Umami. The Umami x6 - Even though I'm a huge pork (bacon) person I actually liked this burger the best.  I can't seem to remember all the ingredients, but what stood out the most were the parmesan crisp, the portabello mushroom, and oven roasted tomatoes.  The combo of all the ingredients (although independently pedestrian) really took the burger to a different level.  Great balance, of flavors and textures. The SoCal - I like my Cali burgers like Pie 'N Burger and In-N-Out.  As an independent burger it's just fine, but relative to Pie 'N Burger or an In-N-Out double double animal...it's hits about avg. Fries - I'm not a huge fan of thick fries in general b/c I like my fries crispy.  Shockingly they were crispy and not too starchy.  Also, the first time I had them they were aggressively seasoned throughout...which I love.  The last time I had them they weren't as seasoned, which is unfortunate.  The portion is on the small-side, like the burgers. Sauces - All the burgers and the fries are boldly flavored and seasoned, all the sauces are relatively tame.  Maybe it's the juxtaposition of all the aggressive flavors next to the sauces that make them seem tame by comparison.  But overall I felt they were lacking in either sweetness, acidity, saltiness,...or umami. Service is professional and friendly.

I can safely say that Umami Burger is one of my new favorite Los Angeles eateries - despite the fact that: (A) I've only eaten there once and (B) the experience was influenced (positively) by a fluke bit of luck - namely: our waiter mistakenly bringing us an un-ordered burger and then offering it to us for free - which could, I realize, be construed as a strike against their service, but I digress. My lunch date and I tried the Truffle Burger (delicious), Pork Belly Burger (winsome) and the eponymous Umami Burger (adequate), along with side orders of their triple-cooked steak fries (forgettable) and malt liquor tempura onion rings (killer). The long and short of it is: the food - though modestly portioned - makes the place worthy of a second and third visit so long as you know that its richness and absolute lack of regard for caloric frugality will have you feeling the rumblings of a minor cardiac event immediately thereafter. But if you don't mind that - and I don't - you should absolutely give Umami Burger a try.

But if you want to call it  gourmet you'd expect to pay the price. 3) Always crowded..... Go after rush hour lunch time. Or you would be waiting  for a while for a table. 4) Truffle Burger!! 5) I'm not keen on the fries. Portion is small to me and I'm not into the fat , under cooked fries. I like the crispy McDonald's type fries =) Plus what's up on the Ketchup???? Can we say CHEAP??? Otherwise, you got to try Umami at least once .

There stuff is usually awesome, but I have to note...the last 3 times I've been here, the food has been VERY inconsistent.  way overcooked meat (ie dark in the center), overcooked fries, fries and burger way saltier than i ever remember, and more GREASY then i remember. the bun especially has been extra greasy....on the top.  i dont know if i bun should be that shiny. regardless it still tastes ok for the most part.   however, im thinking umami isnt as great as i thought it was/worth my money, so im looking for a better burger. sorry umami, you had my heart once :(

YUM-OHHHH! Despite the long-ish wait, my mood was lifted once I bit into my delicious Truffle Burger at Umami. But wait, the zenith hadn't been reached yet: my spirits got even higher when trying a bite from my boyfriend's Umami burger! Whoa - so many flavours, so much joy! What is Umami? Who cares! It is amazing. AND, the portion is small enough, yet hearty enough, so yes, just the perfect size for a lovely meal that creates memories that will make your mouth water. oh and try the chai cola! Fun!

Amazingly this was pretty good, including the vegi burgers. We ordered the turkey burger, mushroom burger, truffle burger and truffle fries! Their burgers are delicious! The portions looked small, but actually, it's quite filling. It's definitely a place to try.

Always seem to be in the area, so I've come here a lot for their burgers.  I've tried several of their different burgers (lamb, pork, mushroom, etc), but I would only give a 4 stars to their Truffle Burger.  I acutally avoided it for a while because I thought it would be too rich and complex taste for a burger.  But the truffle glaze works really well with the burger meat they use.  The rest of the burgers that I've tried there I would only give 2.5 - 3 stars.  I appreciate the fact that they like to try out new burgers, and I usually find myself ordering their newest one.  But each time I end up wishing that I just stuck with the Truffle Burger. My only other real complaint would be the size of the food.  I'm an average sized guy, so their burgers don't ever fill me up.  And I guess their sides of onion rings or fries are just as small, so as not to emphasize the petite size of the burgers.

Both my umami burger and my boyfriend's (hatch burger) were too rich without enough bright flavors to cut through the grease. I was expecting to be wowed based on the hype, but my burger disappointed me. It was nice, however, that the portions weren't too huge. Tempura onion rings were great with tasty house-made ketchup and some other dipping sauce. Also enjoyed drinking grape Crush out of the bottle. Overall impression was that Umami Burger is a bit gimmicky without packing the actual flavor punch it promises. I'd rather visit the trusty old Apple Pan any day!

What was ordered: 1 umami burger, 2 truffle burgers, 1 So-cal burger, 2 hand cut fries, 1 sweet potato fries, 1 onion ring, two root beers, 1 beet salad, 1 root beer float... 4 people. It was a great meal. Out of that list: Must order - TRUFFLE BURGER!!! Get two for yourself. Hand cut fries (order two as well). Root beer... hella goot. So-so order - Onion rings NO order - So-Cal burger, Umami burger, sweet potato fries, beet salad. Or just figure it out yourself like I did... it's a lot more exciting that way. Note: everything was quite salty so drink lots of water. UMA-ME Again in a couple weeks.

I was skeptical about this place because of the hype--I shouldn't have been. The burger was tasty, juicy and distinctive. I tried the Umami burger  and the Triple Pork burger (pork, bacon & chorizo).  The Triple Pork was good but the Umami burger was excellent. I would give it 5 stars if not for the $10 dollar price tag, 2.50 valet and the fact that they don't sell alcohol.

I pass by this umami burger almost everyday around 7pm and it's always packed. so I decided to try it out at an earlier hour, 5, the other day and it was a great experience ! The server there was funny, and knew everything on the menu and off the menu. They have like 20 different bottled sodas, which he just blurped out quickly. I caught that they have like four different types of root beer. lovely. My friend ordered the regular umami burger, I got the truffle burger, and shared an order of onion ring. Everything was delicious. we were so full that we couldn't finish the onion ring. Though umami burger is their original burger, I really recommend their truffle burger. Smells and tastes veeeeery delicious. Over all a good experience, I'll go back when I am meeting with a friend to have a casual talk.

Honestly, Umami Burger didn't really impress me.  The burger was "good," but not "great," and if I'm going to pay over $10 for a burger then it really needs to be "great."   In my opinion, The Counter is a better place for burgers.  Sorry, Umami.

Umami Burger???  Yes, please! So I heard about this restaurant a few months prior and was dying to try it.  So one day when I was in the area, I decided to stop by for lunch with a friend.  It was delicious!  Wasn't too pricey for a gourmet type of burger and definitely worth the money. I got the Umami Burger, which was their special.  I thought this burger was super tasty.  I really liked the parmesan chip that they had inside the burger, gave it a nice touch and a little bite!  The mushroom in the burger also gave it a nice finish as well.  The only thing I could definitely have gone without was the excess of ketchup in my burger.  Although, this is definitely a personal preference.  I just don't really like my burgers drenched in ketchup. My lunch date ordered the White Truffle Burger and that was DELICIOUS!  We actually split each burger in half so we could try a little bit of both.  I think I enjoyed this burger more for sure.  There was such a strong truffle flavor in the burger that definitely made it melt in your both. Both burgers were good and cooked to perfection.   We also ordered the fat french fries and onion rings.  Their onion rings are good!  Battered up, fried and served with the dipping sauce of your choice! Yummy! I definitely recommend this place.  Service was pretty decent too. Only bad thing:  The restaurant is SUPER small.  So if you're going during a lunch or dinner rush, be prepared to wait a while.  This was kind of a bummer... but it was worth the wait. Don't forget to get the little cake things they have at the register on your way out!  They had this cake with peanut butter, chocolate and marshmallow.  It tasted like a ding dong with peanut butter inside!  SO GOOD!!!

I'm thinking more 3.5, but since I had to choose between 3 and 4 stars, I rounded down: the fries (at least the larger, "hand-cut" ones I ordered) were not great...sort of starchy and didn't feel properly cooked. Still the truffle burger was very tasty, (though small).  Don't come hungry, unless you're planning on ordering two burgers, or at least getting one and splitting another with a buddy.  [There was a man behind me who ordered four or five for himself!]  Their burgers are more to be savored than devoured in hopes of achieving that stuffed sensation. Parking here was not great...there is valet, but if you don't want to pay extra for that (because, honestly, $11 for a smallish hamburger is one thing but to add valet + tip in this economy isn't appareling), you need to find parking across the street in a residential area.  (I.e. you're coming in a group, carpool is a good idea.) My friends all enjoyed their burgers (including the Manly burger, Umami burger, and Port $ Stilton.)   Anyway, I'd say it's worth a try with friends if you're somewhere in the greater Los Angeles area.

4 Stars for the Burgers and 1 Star for the Hand Cut French Fries.  Do Not Order those fries, they are nasty blocks of undercooked potato.  They also ration the ketchup here like it's liquid gold. So if you like lots of ketchup, you'll have to pay extra. I ordered the Portabello Burger, which was very tasty, but if you don't eat it fast enough, your bun will get soggy. As a vegetarian, I will definitely return to try the Earth Burger. I just wish the portions were bigger :)

I'm not much of a burger fan but the Truffle burger at this place was amazing! It's not your ordinary in-n-out burger - the patty alone on these burgers are cooked to perfection and although I would be happier for something a bit bigger for what I'm paying, this burger was the best I've tried thus far! & the Malted Onion Rings were absolutely tantalizing. BUT Service was beyond HORRIBLE, I got there a little before closing time and ended up ordering to-go, it took them a good 5-10 minutes before they actually got the order and then another 10 before they got around to billing me; told my group to go wait outside in the freezing cold because they were crowded and didn't bother to let us know that our orders were ready. Overall the food and decor at the restaurant was amazing, but the servers were rude and service was slow.

Hmmm, not bad but not a burger I'm going to be craving anytime soon. Don't get me wrong, Umami has good burgers but I went in with high expectations since they were said to have the "best burgers in Los Angeles". I ordered the Umami burger. The meat was ok, cooked to perfection but wasn't bursting with flavor. The bun was delicious but a bit greasy. I loved the parm crisp that they put in place of a slice of cheese; it added the perfect amount of salt to each bite. The thing I love the most, the thing I wanted to remove from the whole burger and clone so I can eat it everyday was the roasted tomato. It added the ideal amount of sweetness and just a little tang...I still think about it fondly. We also ordered the sweet potato fries and onion rings. We weren't too impressed with either. Both are something you can get anywhere for less money. Overall, I would go back again but less for the actual burger and more for that heavenly roasted tomato!

I tried the umami burger and truffle burger, as well as the sweet potato fries and smushed potatoes. The burgers were very very good, but the smushed potatoes were the most memorable dish of the evening. I'd definitely like to go back and try more on the menu. The indoor space feels small and the tables are close together (one friend called it "cozy" and the other called it "claustrophobic"). Total price for one burger, and order of smushed potatoes, and a Mexican coke was $18 before tip. Unless you valet, finding a decent parking spot is very difficult.

I know this is a much loved burger institution, and I understand the appeal.  However, it didn't live up to the hype. This being said, it's not a bad place. I think the prices are quite reasonable $10 for a fancy burger- about right. It's good, but it didn't blow my mind.  Would I go again? Perhaps, if someone suggested it for lunch, I wouldn't oppose to eating there again.  But I know as a fact that I will not be craving the food and rushing to go back. And here's the breakdown of food: I had the umami burger. It's moist, juicy and nicely done. Can't say it was awful. But personally I thought it was bland and needed salt (and I tend to like foods that are not overly salted). It lacked texture. The bread is very soft, the burger patty soft, the mushrooms soft (sluggish like all mushrooms) and unfortunately the parmesan crisp not crisp at all since it sits between a moist burger patty and the sauteed mushrooms.  It's lacking the bite and texture you get from some sort of green (lettuce etc).  The burger itself is really juicy, but can't really say if it's fat or something else. They don't (or I didn't see) where the meat is coming from etc. My sister had the pork burger and it's definitely more tasty.  I liked it a lot better than the umami burger, but with each subsequent bite, you could see the fat that was dripping off the burger which can be kinda gross at time.  But it is much tastier and had different textures since the patty isn't as soft as the umami burger.  It was yummy The onion rings or tempura onions.  Okay, the batter is very thick and after it sits a while it's just extremely battered onions.  I don't recommend them at all.  Plus it's pricey for 5-6 rings The smushed potatoes I liked a lot.  From what I could tell it was fingerling potatoes that are cooked and smushed before deep frying.  It was delicious.  I would recommend those for sure. I'm not going to go into service, but I did notice that it's come and go.  Some waiter were definitely more attentive than others. Although at times, everyone seems a little clueless as to what's going on. Overall service, not the best but I'm in it for the food... Summary: $10-$12 burger...pretty okay.  Not the best. Would go back, but not crave worthy to say the least. Definitely not worth an hour wait. Worth maybe 30 minute wait if that.

I wish this place had the same feel as the one on La Cahuenga. This one seems like they just don't have the same....size, enthusiasm, feel, anything. It always feels like an ordeal to sit when you come with 4+ people. I love their sweet potato fries and their aioli is amazing. I'll def try this location again because I love their burgers.

First time here the place was small but surprisingly not too crowded for 12:00.  We got the hatch and umami burger with smushed potatoes and onion rings.    My hatch burger was good, moist but slightly salty.  The first bite of the umami burger was unreal such a different taste than you're used to in a burger.  It really lives up to its name and the mushroom pairs well.     The smushed potatoes were great and I liked the tempura style onion rings so light and crispy.  The portion size is good not an enormous burger but did fill me up without feeling sick afterwards.

Excellent burgers. The turkey burger was amazing!! Their house made "veggie burger" is super flavorful and not for someone looking for a traditional gardenburger. My only two suggestions are to have crayons for all that stark white paper they use as a tablecloth. The place is not super kid friendly, but some kids do go there, and adults like to color too right?? Bring your own crayons! Also, they don't ask how you want your burger, which I know is because in the food world, burgers are rare right now, but I took my mid 60's father there and he sent his burger back twice because it wasn't dead enough. I'm not on his side, but if you like a well done burger, make sure you state that!

I have heard so much about Umami maybe it got overhyped for me. The Umami Burger itself is not one of my faves. I didn't like their take on tomatoes in it which were a bit sour and gave the burger a taste like they put pasta sauce in it. I wasn't that into it. The Truffle Burger on the other hand is much more yummy. If you want lettuce, tomatoes, and all the other greens, this isn't the burger for you. It's just a patty of meat and a slice of cheese on top all flavored with awesome truffle oil. It's really delicious and flavorful. We also got fries, sweet potato fries, and the cheese balls. The fries and sweet potato fries were really standard. Pretty good but nothing to write home about. The cheese balls IMO were sort of big tater tots filled with cheese that just melted into the potato. They were good but I just didn't like them that much. Overall, Umami is good but for the prices you pay, I'd say it's A-OK.

I was pretty sad that this place was really small, kind of a place where someone would just pass right by and not even know it was a decent hamburger joint. We were seated at the counter area facing the wall, in which i felt like i was in time out. Service was ok. Not the best, but yet not the worst. BF ordered the Umami burger, and I ordered the truffle burger. I tried his umami burger and it was ok. I liked the truffle burger - it was simple, but very juicy. I just hate the fact that it was greasy. We also ordered the tempura onion rings and it was good. I would go back and order the same truffle burger. :)

Generally, a burger joint  is not the place you want to take a friend, date or visiting family member when dining out but Umami Burger is that rare gem suitable for all three. The Food: Simple Menus of neatly sized burgers that don't spill over in your hands with tasty sharp cut and seasoned fries. Add your aioli sauce and cherry coke and you've been UMAMI'D. Don't forget to grab a cupcake for desert. The Setting: Young, fresh and artistic. There are three dining areas at this location including a very small outdoor area. You are a bit packed in like a coffee stop in New York but it doesn't take away from the Umami experience. Best Time to Go: Before 7pm for sure and generally on a weekday. You'll find parking and seating without the wait.

I've only been here once but I enjoyed my experience.  I got the triple pork burger & thought it was delicious! I also took a bite out of the truffle burger, which was good, but nothing compared to the triple pork in terms of flavor.  I also really liked the variety of sauce options that were available for the fries.  I'd recommend the jalapeno ranch & the roasted garlic aioli.  So, I'd have to say the food here is good but quite pricey for the quantity you receive. I honestly felt like I could've eaten another burger even though I already had 1 burger, fries & a drink...

I normally read yelp reviews BEFORE going somewhere but Umami's reputation precedes it so I went on word of mouth alone. After eating here THEN reading the yelp reviews, I feel perhaps I'm missing something. LA's best burger? multiple 5 star reviews? I absolutely, positively disagree, not even close. To start with, don't go to this location. The decor is not cute. The service was bad to terrible and it's the only Umami location that does not serve alcohol. Next? Parking: Cheap valet but difficult to get in to. I drove by 3 different times trying to get in but there was always a car sitting facing the opposite direction (ie the road, about to leave) and the entrance to this lot IS the exit. Finally found a street spot after 10-12 minutes. The wait for a table was reasonable, about 15 minutes. The interior? I won't bore you but it bored me. But sure, it's a burger joint? Where else would you give a damn about the decor of a burger joint except in LA? I mention it because apparently the other locations, specifically the Los Feliz and Hollywood locations are infinitely nicer. The food. Did I eat the same burger as all of the other reviewers?  Seeing as how it was my first time, I ordered The Umami Burger. It came on a white bun disguised as a brioche bun, lightly basted with what I assume was butter. The beef was truly forgettable, average but not even as good as the burgers my pops whips up on his backyard grill. The "umami" flavor equated to a derivative of sugar and it just ended up tasting like a sweet, average burger. Another reviewer likened it to a sweet pepperoni pizza and I guess I can see that. It had a few additions to it, a piece of portabello mushroom, a few onions and a slice of some fried piece of ...? The umami ketchup delivered on the side was, not surprisingly, sweet. I ordered a side of sweet potato fries. Blech. I adore sweet potato fries and have ordered them all over the place. These were some of the worst. El Pollo Loco just started serving sweet potato fries and theirs are better. No kidding. I got a side of garlic aioli to dip them in and it didn't help. The only really tasty thing of the night were these cheddar cheese infused tater tots. Holy hell, these caused me to pause and close my eyes as I chewed; they were fantastic. So fantastic, I wish I would've skipped 3/4 of the burger and just had another order of the tots. With LA's burger craze, there are so so so so many other places with significantly better burger and some of these places aren't even dedicated burger joints! I think people should go at least once just because "everybody's doing it" and you need to see for yourself. However, after reading some of these reviews, I feel like I should go back and try again. Maybe it was a bad Umami night. Maybe I'm about to start my period. Maybe the stars weren't aligned correctly. I don't know..but as it stands, I would rather have had a bowl of that delicious Trader Joe's maple brown sugar shredded bite size wheat cereal for dinner.

I have a been a patron of Umami Burger since the first month that it opened, 2 years ago. Usually, restaurants lose their touch as they move toward scale in lieu of quality product. However, I assure you Umami has not lost its touch in regards to food. My personal favourite is the Manly Burger. It is beautifully layered in taste, making each bite a perfect progression between different tastes and feelings. One that sticks in my mind is the excellent, robust taste of the lardons that are scattered on top of the burger. While it is no secret that bacon is the key to my heart, its addition on this burger leaves it deserving of its own frontpage article on Yahoo (as the signature Umami burger received). I personally love my burger rare, which I recommend as the taste of the burger meat and the lardon together is what makes this burger a symphony of taste. While my devotion to the cult of the Umami Burger is strong, their side dishes oftentimes leave me with a feeling of loss in comparison to the burger. I got an order of smashed potatoes, which was grossly over salted. While the dish has promise -- as many of their side dishes do -- it does not reach the level necessary to cause me to swoon. Simply enough, lay off the seasoning. The principal reason I do not give Umami full accolades is the service. I am not one to enjoy waiting for 20 minutes to order and then have 15 minutes to wait for a fork. It is a small restaurant with an adequate staff, but for some reason my friend and I were forgotten and lost. While I thought it was something that was uncommon -- a simple mistake -- I noticed other people around me facing the same issue. I am a forgiving person, but I got no apologies from staff for the clearly inordinate amount of time I had to wait. In the end, the burger is delicious. But one must come with the clear mindset that one must be patient and expect little from the service. Nirvana comes solely from the flavours of the burger.

Unami Burger is so good! Manly Burger is pretty good also. First timers get the unami burger. Valet Parking $2.50. Went Monday at 5:30pm. Got a seat right away. Have a touch screen menu with two free games you play while waiting for your food. :)

The only one I've been to is the one in Santa Monica so I was DEEPLY disappointed when this location didn't serve beer. I have an issue when a chain of restaurants don't offer the same selections, esp. when I bring an out of towner (who very much so enjoys alcoholic beverages) to the location that lacks what another has. BUT we had an efficient and patient (told him to come back twice because we were talking instead of reviewing the menu) server who didn't charge us the measly $0.50 for the extra ketchup we ordered. AND I had the truffle burger (tried the Umami burger in SM) which was BOMB (yes, better than their signature burger). When everyone else's burgers came out with many more goodies such as bacon, fried onions, sprouts, etc., I was bummed because mine was just cheese and truffle oil but when I took a bite... I closed my eyes for extra savoring. Because I like to insist on trying what everyone else is having I got to sample the Greenbird and the one with the bacon lardons (I enjoy that word) and my burger was hands down the winner! When I first offered a bite to my boyfriend he declined and said he was going to be too full but I told him he would be missing out if he didn't try it. When he did so reluctantly, his eyebrows went up in simultaneous disbelief and pleasure. At $3 a soda I definitely planned to take the fancy old school glass bottles home (the 7up flavor was called "Bubble Up". How cute is that!) but I forget all three of them :(

On the way to some art galleries I decided to finally check out Umami Burger after hearing so much about it. I arrived at around 11:30am with parking in the small lot available. Only had a few other people in the place so the service was pretty good. I had the triple pork burger, fries, and a black cherry soda. The burger was really great! It had what looked like a roasted tomato on it which I normally would frown upon and remove, but for some reason I tried it and ate every last drop. I also liked the fries, but along with a lot of people on yelp, I wasn't impressed by the amount you actually get and yeah the ketchup is a little off. The burger though made up for it and really the fries were pretty tasty, I would just get the garlic aioli next time and maybe try the onion rings. I also got a raspberry red velvet ding dong from cake monkey that was pretty awesome too. I'll be back very soon!

I am soooo sick of the S@#$*tty service at this place.  The first couple of times, I let it go.  But be prepared to get pissed off at some point during your visit to this place.   Also, FYI - they close at 9pm on Sundays.  My wife and I arrived at 8:40pm last night for a table of two.  They said they were no longer taking tables, although there were several two tops available.  We took our biz elsewhere. Food - small burgers that pack a tasty punch.  Greasy onion rings and fries, but sometimes that is what you need.  Anyway, the food is at least 3 stars, but I'm just frustrated with the service.  Good Luck.

When you can go to "The Counter" and get as good if not a better burger way more food for the money and less hipster bull shit ! Sorry Umami, you wana last in LA you better get your shit together.

I think people who have rated this restaurant low probably have their expectations in the wrong place. This isn't a great "burger joint" this is like a high-brow, delicacy version of a burger. I think you need to approach it the same way... like a wine tasting. This is definitely a gourmet burger. The 'point' of it (hence the name, Umami) is to taste it slowly and savor the combination of flavors -- and in that aspect, it takes the cake. Everything about the flavor mixing is absolutely spot-on. It's rich, it's bold, it's 'fresh', it's inventive: it's delicious! I have eaten here several times and never been disappointed. In fact, I have said that the first bite will make you cry. It's delicious and wonderful... so wonderful in fact, that after your first bite you start to mourn the fact that it will come to an end eventually. It truly is a sad moment! I prefer this location over the others, personally. It's small and intimate (which I enjoy) and the wait staff is all very friendly and funny and the food is very consistent. I have tried every burger on the 'regular' menu, but there are new additions (both in burgers, sides, drinks, and desserts) nearly weekly, so there are probably some I haven't tasted yet. I like that the menu is so simple and that things change frequently... I've gotten to sample some very unsual and delicious things that I might not have otherwise thought to pair with a burger. My favorite thing is the house-made ingredients. I enjoy finding out what the "pickles of the day" are and the ever-changing french fry assortment. The house-made American Cheese is fantastic, but the piece de resistance is the house-made garlic aoili. It's included as a topping on some of the burgers, but also can be requested as a side for the fries. DON'T MISS IT. I don't know how it is so delicious, but it IS. My husband would not eat mayo (or anything like it) for 33 years until he tried this garlic aoili. True story.

Umami Burger is the best burger in town as far as I'm concerned. Granted I haven't tried every burger place in town, including the famous Father's Office, but as far as burgers go, you will not be disappointed! These people know their burgers! I eat there often and every single burger I've had has been super juicy and flavorful! I usually have their thick cut fries and a Mexican coke (the only kind they carry) with my burger. If you are trying Umami out for the first time, try their signature Umami burger. It's designed to be full of that fifth taste that they call "flavor". I believe it's got a burger patty, a whole grilled shitake mushroom, grilled onions(?), and topped with a Parmigiano Reggiano cheese crisp. Not sure if there's tomato in there... What's great about Umami is the focus on their burgers, and so their menu is short and sweet, with a few choices of side and quite a few house-made condiments. Even their ketchup is made in house and may I say, that's one delicious ketchup! Aside from the thick cut fries and onion rings, they also serve crispy fries now. Their crispy fries and onion rings aren't that spectacular. They are not bad, but they don't stand out either. This is where I go when I want a great burger!

Two words: mouth watering! These little burgers are phenomenal. I've ordered the truffle burger (definitely the favorite of the bunch) and also had a few bites their classic Umami Burger and the Manly Burger (?) with bacon. Be prepared for a long wait though. Even by avoiding the regular lunch and dinner crowd, don't count on siting down immediately. Don't be discouraged though! The restaurant is quite small and service moves pretty fast once you're in. Well worth waiting for! Best burgers EVER!

My favorite burger ever: the umami burger. Note: there will be blood. The burger comes medium rare. I like my steaks medium rare but am a little freaked out by a bloody burger. However, the first time I had this burger, I 1) almost wept for joy 2) wanted to lick the plate. Do not fear the blood. I would also say, if you are a burger purist, you may not enjoy it as much. However, if you just like good food and flavors converging in your mouth to organize a festival of delicious...then try the umami burger. If you go with a friend, I would suggest splitting the umami and a truffle so that you can each have a taste. However, for your second burger (and if you are like me, you will begin to consider ordering a second burger about three bites in), you may just want to have umami all over again.

Umami Burger on La Brea, is delicious!!!!! Gourmet Hamburger Joint. For being located in this area, I think pricing is great! Myselff and a Friend ate their last night (cuz he swares by this place!) we both got hamburgers and shared a big thing of fries for $25. I had the Hatch Burger! If you like food with a kick, highly recommended! It was fantastic!! It's a small place, not much to the ambiance, but we had a great time and great food! Service was great too! Seated quickly even though there were a lot of people there, and the waitor was really nice. A++

I have been wanting to try this place for so long and finally got to eat here this past weekend.   So let me cut to the chase.  My friend and I shared two burgers the umami burger which is their signature burger and the socal burger. The meat here is cooked perfectly for me, but there was a girl in our party that didn't eat half her burger because it was too rare for her.  It's more rarer than medium rare here and that's how they are supposed to be.   The only thing about the burgers I didn't like was that there was so little of the condiments inside.  I was expecting more flavors in my mouth, but mostly I tasted the meat and the bread.  The cheese crisp they put inside is too thin for you to really taste.  For a burger that comes with nothing but the burger (no fries included) I thought they could afford to put more of the condiments inside so you could taste all the unique flavors. One more point gets docked off for their fries.  I got an order of fries for $3.50 which comes with about 7-8 fries and it was STALE! Gosh, I would think they would fry up a new batch since it's not like I'm eating at Mcdonalds.  I've had better fries at Mcdonalds.  As for Ketchup, they give you one little spoonful and if you want extra they charge you I think 50 cents.  We also got the garlic aioli and we couldn't even taste the garlic.  Don't get it if you're hoping for a garlic flavor, it's pretty much plain mayo.   I will come back here again to give it another shot.  Don't know if maybe it was because we came here 1hr before they closed and they ran out of the condiments and got lazy to fry up some new fries.  But they do know how to cook the burger perfectly and it was delicious.

Rude! And apparently not very well informed. We were told "there is no such thing as organic beef." Really? Maybe they should check with O!Burger where they serve Organic Beef... and it's tasty. Here's a thought. If you want to be a condescending jerk - get a job at a quality restaurant that serves meat without factory fecal matter in it.. People are more forgiving about lousy attitudes when they're being served good food. If you're looking for Gross Meat and an Annoyingly Hip Burger Staff enjoy Umami Burger... I'm going to O!Burger for Friendly Service and Clean Quality Beef : D

I was extremely excited to finally eat at Umami. I LOVE hamburgers. I've only had one burger in my life that I didn't like (and it was because In-N-Out had an off day, obviously rare). So we got there and the service was amazing. We got a great table, and the onion rings were so delicious I almost cried. Our burgers got there and all my friends liked theirs. However, mine was completely burned on the outside and raw on the inside. The outer layer was entirely black and tasted like ash. There wasn't even cooked meat between the raw part and the burned part. Only black ash and red, dripping, raw meat. Anyways, never going back there again. But a burger sounds good now... off to In-N-Out!

Don't get me wrong...the burger was good. However, it can't call it best restaurant burger that I've ever had. I have to disagree with GQ's assessment. They make tasty burgers, but the portions are relatively small for the price. I also felt the place was a little too geared toward the yuppie and hipster crowd. It doesn't feel as comfortable as a place like The Counter where you can just sit down and enjoy your burger in regular jeans and a t-shirt.

Pros: The burgers ($9-11) are spectacular like mauh! I've had the Manly Burger and the Hatch Burger. They melt into your mouth. The sweet potatoe fries ($4) are excellent and a must have. Super nice service folks and the menu is very simple (but not underwhelming). Cons: It gets packed. If it is packed be prepared to wait because the place is small. If you get seated in the backroom (aka the echo chamber) you're screaming over your food. Never, ever, ever get the pickle dish ($5). I asked if the pickles were deli style, "like Canters" and the server (who was super nice) shook his head furiously yes. It's not -- lots of spicy, odd, extra vinegary, pickled vegetables including some pickles, carrots, mushrooms, okra and something else I can put my finger on. I get that it's supposed to be like Korean BBQ -- but it isn't, its not good. Enough about pickles in this review! In summary it's a little pricey but totally worth it. Burgers are cooked deliciously medium rare so if you want done or well done speak up. Sodas come in mini old school bottles (no refills but the water is free). Valet is $2.50.  There's a seed vending machine outside which is awesome but I didn't have .50 cents which was a bummer. But I had a great meal.

After wanting to try Umami Burger for the longest time, I finally had an excuse to pass by the area today. I came by on a Monday evening, expecting it to be not so busy. As I looked through the window, it seemed pretty full inside, and there were a few people waiting outside. I asked one of the servers what the wait time was, but since I was by myself, he was able to seat me right away.  Everything else wasn't quite as hasty. After I ordered, I waited about half an hour for a burger and sweet potato fries. I don't think it could be blamed on them being busy, since most of the people who were waiting outside were already sitting around me. They couldn't have been understaffed, since I counted about 6 individual servers for that tiny place that night. Finally, cooking the burger couldn't have taken too long since I pretty much drank blood that night. In any case, as soon as my food arrived, I couldn't wait to try it. I forwent the provided knife entirely and just bit straight in. Immediately I thought, overrated. It wasn't so much "juicy" as it was simply "undercooked." The patty was pretty bloody, but that was fine by me. Overall, the burger itself is pretty good, but did not really evoke that umami taste. I was expecting something far more savory. Even though I might be biased since it is my favorite burger, I prefer a Fuddrucker's burger to an Umami burger. It is tasty, but definitely not the best. I've had much better sweet potato fries elsewhere. The "umami ketchup" just tasted like ketchup with a little bit of horseradish mixed in. I almost forgot. I have no idea what that weird cracker on top of my burger was for, but I assume it was the umami part of it. I ate some of it by itself, but it proved kind of bland. Ultimately, this place is definitely overrated, and you will wait for that overratedness. It's good and worth trying, and I do want to try the truffle burger, but maybe another day.

I've been here twice, and sat outside both times. The temperature is fine when the heaters are on and it's nice out anyways! The first time my friend and I ordered the Truffle burger and the SoCal burgers and we split them half and half. The truffle was hands-down the winner! The SoCal was also really good, but if it is supposed to be a take on the In-N-Out burger I'd rather pay $3 for the fast food version. We also ordered a side salad, which was nothing to write home about, and the fat fries (which I don't think are on the menu anymore) that tasted like those dried mashed potatoes you get at the grocery store - aka YUCK! But the Truffle burger definitely made up for this! The second time I went was terrible! The specials for the day were the pineapple teriyaki burger which had a mango salsa on it. I specifically asked the waitress (who was sick and sneezing, sniveling, coughing all night) if there was cilantro in the salsa and she replied "I don't think so, I'll ask the chef to take it off if there is." And what do you know... she completely forgot to ask the chef and I was stuck with disgusting cilantro. I just scraped the salsa off and the burger was fine. My boyfriend ordered another special, the Ahi Tuna Burger. From this, we learned not to order fish at a burger place. It wasn't very good and he didn't finish it, but finished my cilantro-y burger instead. So overall I'd give this place 3 stars for bad service but amazing burgers.

Some friends and I accidentally arrived about 20 minutes until close. The hostess informed us that seating had ended but that they could squeeze us in. We were incredibly grateful since we were starving. Our waiter was awesome and super informed about the menu. He brought us all the different sauces to test out and answered all of our questions. I got the Hatch burger which was out of this world! The meat was cooked to a perfect medium rare. I typically cannot finish a huge burger but I downed this one in about seven minutes. This place is for sure worth it!

I really want to like this place.  I mean, the food is truly spectacular, I've enjoyed everything I've ordered.  But the service here is some of the worst in Los Angeles.  Rude all around, slow, and they make you feel as if you should be grateful that they've allowed you to eat in their restaurant.  They really have a knack for turning what would be a wonderful meal into a negative experience. I haven't tried the other locations, but I've heard that the service at the others is much better.  Get your act together, Umami La Brea!

Heard lots of good things about Umami Burger so definitely had to try. Three words: NOT WORTH IT. Greeted by hostess' that were pretty much a waste, 8 or 9 tables that we could have easily have seated ourselves at. Then we were approached by a nonplussed waiter with absolutely no personality. He prompted us to order immediately after sitting down without a chance to check out the menu. We ordered: Water: came in a crappy plastic cup that should have been thrown away 5 uses ago. Sprite: Without having a chance to check the menu we got a bottle of "bubble-up." 3 for a bottle of soda! The waiter could have been kind enough to make sure we knew we weren't going to get refillable 7-up! Manly Burger: very tasty but small! For $11 I was expecting a burger that I couldn't finish! Triple Pork Burger: had a different taste but was expecting more. Sweet potato fries and tempura onion rings: good portions and came with their spicy ketchup. I don't know why they're so chintzy with the condiments but they bring them out on a tiny spoon enough for about 1/3 or your side. All in all a disappointment. A $40 lunch should leave you stuffed.

The first time I ate here I thought it would be one of those places where if I went to dine again, the experience wouldn't be the same. I was wrong. I came here last night with a group of friends. The wait was 25 minutes which were minutes that were quickly passed. Upon seating, there was an Ipad-like touchscreen device at our table which featured games such as "Would You Rather" and also provided the menu with real life pictures. That made the additional waiting fun. I ordered the hatch burger, medium rare. I appreciated the fact that the hints of peppers were only hints. It was a simple concept, with rich flavors, as with all the other hamburger variations I've tried here. In the past, I've had the truffle burger and a bite of the umami burger. The truffle burger has to be one of my favorites here. I dip this burger with the garlic aioli sauce and it's a hit every time. I am not a fan however, with the sides. I think with the richness of the main dish, the sides should offer less savory flavors and depend on a simple salt and pepper instead of whatever they do to cook it. The thing I liked most about my experience here was the service. When our group had trouble choosing which sauces to try with our sides, our waiter took initiative and offered to bring out one of each. Recommendations: Truffle Burger, Garlic Aioli

My coworker and I came here for a lunch "meeting" (I say meeting so that we could get out of the office for an extended period of time) and little did we expect, we both fell in lust over our OOOOOHHHH MAMMA! burgers. First, were brought skinny fries and smashed potatoes, both were cooked and seasoned to perfection and large enough portions where I recommend sharing them with your table.  Then our beautiful burgers came floating out to us.  I cannot find the correct words to describe how glorious these solidified gems were.  I cut my burger in half and it oozed fresh meat juices of brilliance. The bun was warmed and cooked on the grill, so it had a nice crispy side to accompany the squishiness of the outsides. The tomatoes were baked, just a little, to match the consistency of the burger... which should give you an idea of how tender the meat itself was.  My first bite was incredible, plain and simple, yet it made me extremely excited for my second bite, which followed into the next until there was nothing left.  The smile on my face felt like that of the Grinch Who Stole Christmas, I could feel the corners of my mouth curl up to the corner of my eyes and I was not afraid to show my glory with the rest of the patio peeps. Our server, Kelly, did an incredible job of keeping up with not only our table, but with the rest around us, she literally ran from one end of the restaurant to the other to make sure everything was done in a timely manor. She was on top of her shit! The only "wah wah" moment was when my coworker ordered a root beer float and it had a little string of hair (extra protein) with it. BUT Kelly not only graciously apologized and replaced it, but she took it off the bill, without hesitation.   I love this place, I want to go to every location in LA.... But first, I must return to the LaBrea location to revisit my love, the SoCal Burger (sans onions). Nom Nom Nom!

What do you get when you take a black girl, an Indian girl, an Armenian Latina, a Vietnamese guy and a Chinese/Japanese dude and put them all together?  (Aside from feelings of fear in the hearts of those content in their homogeneous environments?  "Aaaaaabner, quick!  Grab the kids and sell the house, the brownies are coming!").  What you get is five hungry, burger fiends dying to try the place that's been on Yelp's homepage for weeks.  And if they are Yelpers, you also get 4 out of 5 of them pulling out their cameras so fast when the burgers arrive you'd think it was choreographed.  And when they notice the couple at the table next to them photo snapping their food too, the Vietnamese one excitedly says to the black one who's closest, "Ask them if they're yelpers!"  When the black one becomes bashful and refuses, the Vietnamese one can barely contain himself and inquires about the couple's possible online habits.  Alas, they're not yelpers, but they love their burgers.   Umami is more popular than Britney Spears with no panties on.  So many people waiting to get in we could have had a street party in the parking lot.  And the place is small.  Sewed up tighter than Kim Kardashian's jeans.  So this motley crew of burger fiends waited a good 35 minutes for a table.  I could smell the burger waves floating outside and I was almost in heat. I ordered the Umami burger - medium rare beef, portabello mushrooms, carmelized onions, cheese crisp - all on a bun so light it was heavenly.  I am not big on bloody beef, red juices running all down my face, fears of contracting some kind crazy bovine disease running through my head.  But, the burger was so good I think I may have hair on my chest now (sexy!).  It looked small when it arrived, but by the end of the meal, I was stuffed.  I also ordered the fries - triple cooked and of the steak variety.  Crispy and salty, but I did not care for the Umami ketchup.  It tasted like marinara sauce and I kept waiting for calamari to arrive as accompaniment.   Bring your own liquor!  That's right drunks.  It's BYOB at this joint.  You can bring wine if you want to be fancified and many patrons did.  I, however, opted for a more gritty drink - beer.  I'm eating a half-dead cow, I want something raw to wash it down.  Corkage fee is $5 (I think the beer opening is free). The staff was great, Umami manager acted as server, cashier and parking director, squeezing as many cars into the tiny parking lot as possible.  Our server was patient even when a very pushy ruby-faced woman interrupted him mid-order to talk to him about her friend he didn't know.  I'm glad he handled it well 'cause I was about to tell her what's up, burger-blocking heifer.  We waited 35 minutes (I actually waited almost an hour since my companions were late *ahem*) and we're hungry, don't be getting in the way! Ooh mami, I shall return.  I want to try to one of their 6 other kinds of burgers and I'd like to be able to make it to dessert this time.  Red velvet cakewich, here I come.

Caught you lookin' for the same thing It's a new thing - check out this I bring Uh Oh the roll below the level 'Cause I'm livin' low next to the bass, C'mon Turn up the radio Yes, Umami's had more hype than Chuck D and after sinking my teeth into a couple of these babies myself, I gotta say, some of that hype is definitely worth heeding. Yeaaaahhhhh. Believe the hype! For starters, the place is inviting. Small, but modern and chic, not at all what you'd expect from a "burger joint." I especially dig the little room they have off to the side set entirely with counters, stools, and, (I'm guessing from the laptop I saw?), wi-fi. Great textural details everywhere you look from glass mosaic tile to bamboo wall covering to stacked flag stone reminiscent of a 50s stone hearth. It's an interior designer's wet dream in there. Good stuff. Great selection of burgers I can't wait to make my way through (like a truffle burger and pork three ways - bacon, chorizo and piggy - sounds more like an orgy than a three-way), but we went with the signature Umami Burger that had a big ol' just this side of bloody beef patty on it with amazing cheese that looked crisped on a sweet Portuguese style bun and a turkey burger that was moist, well seasoned and served on the same bun with goat cheese and an apple chutney. The flavors melded together nicely and the soft, sweet bun was the perfect accompaniment, though I could have gone for something a bit more substantial and savory with mah beef, if you know what I mean. They were out of the sweet potato salad (curses!) so I ordered some of the house pickles (the okra and ginger carrots - yes) and the beer battered onion rings. The latter were amazing with dipping sauces like a house made ketchup and garlicky garlic aioli, and I wanted more than the half dozen or so that came in our order. I was in with Mister Sicky Pants and our servers were super kind about making our order to-go on the double. My only complaint with the whole shebang was that I was missing the greens. Ya know, those uber basics of burger building like lettuce and tomato? As delish as my meat, bun and condiments were, I wanted more. More, damn it! Maybe they were somewhere else and I was missing something? Was I supposed to ask for them special? Were they hiding in a secret room? Is there a tomato handshake? Who knows, but I'll find out when I go back. I'll definitely be back.

Long story short: Burgers were just as good as the first time.  Still my fave in LA! Long story long: Coming here was an entirely last minute/peer-pressure kind of thing.  We were done with service, and a few of my friends at church got to talking about this place and wanted to go for lunch and decided to go.  I originally was just going to go home and watch some football, but considering I had been wanting to come back here for the longest time, I figured what the heck... Being Sunday, traffic heading over there was absolutely wonderful.  Street parking was a breeze and free too.  Gotta love Sundays.  Upon walking up, the place was packed.  I went inside and put my name down with the guy.  I say "guy" cuz I don't know if he was the manager or whatever.  If I remember, they don't really have a "host".  I told the guy party of 5.  He told me about 15-20 minutes.  Ok, no worries.  All of my other friends were still on their way.  After about 5 minutes, everybody shows up, including a 6th person.  Crap... so I tell the guy it's going to be 6.  Then a 7th shows up.  Dang it... I apologize to the guy and tell him it's going to be 7 now.  He said the tables he's waiting to give to us are taking their sweet time anyway.  After about an additional 20 minutes, I find out there's going to be an 8th.  I tell the guy sorry again and that it's going to be 8, but that's it.  Long story short, we actually ended up waiting a total of close to 45 minutes.  Of course that's partially my fault because I didn't know at first it was going to be 8 people. Out of the 8 of us, I was the only one who had been there before.  First time I came here, I had the triple pork burger and the manly burger.  I had warned them, especially the guys, that these burgers were on the smaller side.  I wanted to get one of the burgers that I got before just to make sure that it's as good as I remember it.  I sold the triple pork burger for a couple of my friends, and myself, I decided to get the manly burger.  My friend next to me got the triple pork burger, but we were both contemplating a 2nd burger, so I compromised with him and convinced him to split a 3rd burger, so it wouldn't be AS MUCH as 2 full burgers, hehehehe.  I suggested we split the truffle burger.  He had no arguments. Funny side note: I had just discovered while we were waiting outside that they serve Mexican coke, but due to them being apparently mentioned on FoodNetwork's *rolls eyes* "Best Thing I Ever Ate" like 2 days prior, they've been crazy busy and were sold out on several things.  Mexican Coke fail...  Another side note, I didn't notice this until later, and I even had told him, but our server reminded me of Alton Brown.  Seriously... same kind of glasses, same kind of balding pattern, but seriously close resemblance.  Yes, I know, I can be mean.  I also ordered the onion rings. After a few minutes, all of our food came out.  There was a little bit of a mix up on a couple of burgers, which kind of bugs me a little.  All of your employees should be able to correctly identify your food.  But whatever, it didn't cause a problem or anything.  I just wanted to point that out.  I cut my burger in half, as I always cut restaurant burgers in half, and dug into the Manly burger first.  For those of you who haven't been to Umami or had the manly burger, it's essentially a bacon cheeseburger, but like, a really good glorified version.  Beer cheddar cheese, smoked salt onion strings and bacon lardons.  Told you, a really good glorified version *handing you napkin to wipe up your drool* It was just as good as I remember it.  Last time, I really liked the Manly burger but loved the triple pork burger more, so I do regret a little not getting that instead, but no matter, because it's not like I never am going to come here again. When my friend and I were ready, I split the truffle burger and dug in.  Goodness, even as you bring it up to your face and are about to take the bite, you catch the scent of truffles and immediately get transported to a remote and secluded forest in Northern Italy or France (depending on the type of truffle) as you participate in a truffle hunt, only to be blindfolded by the hunters when you leave (as well as when you go in) because they don't want anybody to know where their "stash" is.  It's true, or at least what I'm told.  Not that there are any actual truffles in this burger, but with the truffle cheese and truffle glaze, you can definitely pretend like there were.  It was really good.  Near foodgasm good. The onion rings were better than I remember them.  The thrice cooked fries were really good and were perfectly crispy. Oh, I forgot to add... Alton Brown offered us some of their pickles on the house when we had first sat down.  Maybe he knew we were starving.  Either way, bonus points for him. When we were all done, I had asked a couple of my friends, "best burger in LA?" to which they replied "Yes" *fist pump*

Okay, so even though I ate here only once, I couldn't stop thinking about it!!! To this day, I still rave about it and suggest it to anyone who visits LA. If you're worried about portion control, especially since it's a burger joint, this is perfect! I got the original umami burger and it's a perfect size. It's enough to fill you, but not too much to make you feel fat or bloated after. It's seriously a tantalizing experience you should not deprive your taste buds of. The combination of the tomato and shiitake mushroom are so unique and explosive, and the meat is seriously cooked to perfection with the right texture and flavor. The fries are also delish, but I'm more obsessed with the burgers. I definitely canNOT wait to go back again and soon hopefully!!

CLIFF NOTES: Just GO! The burgers here are not for filling up, they are for enjoying!!! Excellent quality. Excellent Selections. Excellent Service. Cake Monkey Treats. BYOB and No Corkage if you book a private party in there outdoor back patio! Super Clean. THE LONG VERSION: People who find the burgers to be too small are: The type of glutinous losers that belong at Hometown Buffet; The type of  chicks who "fake it" for the tool with the big-ass-useless car in order to get into expensive restaurants for free where they'll order the food, pick at it, drink the booze and puke it all up later; The type of lame-ass-guys who really think that size matters but can't get it up because they're thinking about their pool boy while they try to "do" the tart that just puked up the dinner he just bought her. People who enjoy Umami are: Kind, relaxed people who understand that some things need to be savored and enjoyed...not shoved down one's mouth without looking, smelling, touching, slowing chewing and luxuriating in the deliciousness.  People who can enjoy quality over quantity.  People with good taste. I FELL IN LOVE at Umami   It was a Pre-Birthday-Burger-Binge that a friend had arranged for me. I arrived 30 minutes late and the love of my life was there, patiently waiting, looking good enough to eat...mmm. I wasn't sure how good it would be to have him in my mouth for the first time since I had made him wait so long, but he did not disappoint. Mmmm, bringing him to my lips with no expectations, to be surprised by such a seductive scent...oh Manly...even before I really "had" you, I knew I'd be coming back for more! I knew that night you weren't all mine, I had to share you, but I knew that soon I would have you all to myself!  I was sure of it! I must admit, it was kinda exciting having to share you with 6 other people, watching you get passed around, watching everyone's reaction once they had their moment with you. I couldn't stop thinking about you.  Found every reason to have you again and decided that Thursdays would be "our time" together! Wow, our first time alone was spectacular!   You were so good to me on the front seat of my car! I was almost late for the Niketown run because I couldn't keep you out of my mouth.  I knew I had to restrain myself-I couldn't have you all at once. You were patiently sitting in the front seat of my car waiting for me, hours later, even more tempting with the passage of time.   Mmmm, I had to have a little more of you before I could drive home..oh, and I did, and it was good, but I really wanted to have all of you in the privacy of my home...you were so good and I couldn't stop thinking about you for a week! I took more friends to meet you last week, and they loved you too and can't wait to see you again next week. mmmm...I LOVE you MANLY!!! But I must confess, I will be trying the So-Cal next time. Till then...

Good little Burger...but I'm like Wimpy from Popeye, I need a platter full of those bad boys to make me happy. The ingridents were fresh and the bun was super soft. Then the bill came... $32.00 bucks ..."Ohh , exuse me, Can I gladly pay you tuesday for the Hamburgers I just ate today ? "

a word of warning: be sure to close the bathroom door completely and lock. i had the displeasure of seeing a women's full frontal when i opened the bathroom door (and that lady had a nerve to blame me...wtf?! some people seriously lack common sense). you would think i'd have lost my appetite after the incident, but i scarfed 1/2 of my umami burger and 1/3 of the hubby's triple pork burger. to be fair, we were hungry after driving around for half an hour on christmas eve (can you believe nothing was open?), but these burgers were two of the tastiest things i had for dinner in a while. their signature umami burger done in medium had juice flowing from the meat, mushrooms and caramelized onions, and the crispy parmesan chip provided good crunchiness to it. the pork burger had a bit of kick from chorizo and aioli sauce, and was surprisingly tender and moist even at well done. we also shared sweet potato fries which came with the house made ketchup. having had the umami burger ketchup, i am not sure if i can ever go back to heinz :(. the fries were mildly dusted with brown sugar, salt and cinnamon, which made it very sweet, and the texture was tad bit too crunch. i prefer the ones from father's office. i was taken back by the size of the restaurant. it was tiny and would not house more than 30 people, including the bar area in the back. our waiter was really speedy and food came out fast. as good as the burgers were, i have a hard time justifying 5 star rating for umami. they are about $10 each (can buy 2 in-n-out combo meals), they are tiny (will never completely satisfy my hungry stomach), valet parking is an absurd idea (the lot is attached and surely big and easy enough for self parking), and charging $1.50 extra for an additional condiment is a crime.

I've never had a bad meal here. The burgers are great. I feel like some people get so adverse to the hype they write negative notes but what's not to love. Never seen attitude here and the long lines are common at other good restaurants. Including the beloved In and Out so why hate something just because it's popular?

After a great Sunday morning hike at Runyon Canyon with friends, I decided to treat myself to the Umami Burger finally, since I was in the area. It was definitely worth the wait.  I went for the Umami Burger and the thin cut fries.  The burger isn't the biggest burger around...bigger isn't always better in this case.  Don't expect your traditional burger,  cause the Umami is a gourmet burger.  The bun is on a brioche type bun which is grilled.  The Umami has a nice juicy burger, topped with a grilled portobello mushroom, parmesan crisp with Umami ketchup.   The burger was so juicy as I was eating it, the light bun tended to get soggy half way through.  The burger is one tasty juicy piece of beef.  It's excellent!  The Umami ranks up there in the gourmet category burger like the Father's Office burger. I found out from my Mom that the word Umami is Japanese which loosely translates to delicious or savory.  I would definitely agree that the Umami burger is delish and savory! The thin fries comes with one choice of condiment.   I went with the Umami house made ketchup.  It comes in a soup spoon.  So if you like a lot of ketchup with your fries, this will not be satisfying for you.  The menu says that the fries comes with only one free condiment per order, and additional condiments are $1.50 per spoon....what's up with that?  But my waiter did bring another soup spoon without me asking for no additional charge.  The fries were okay.  Had better had worse.  They were crisp, but just seemed like an artificially fried french fry, if there can be such a thing.  I should've went for the tempura onion rings..they looked awesome.  That's what I'll get on my next visit for sure. I had room for dessert and decided to order  the chocolate mint ice cream sandwich.  I love chocolate mint ice cream, but I don't care for the artificial day glow green type chocolate mint ice cream.  Well guess what, not only was the ice cream day glow fluorescent green, but even the sandwich part was too.  After getting past the color and closing my eyes while I ate it, it was a good ice cream sandwich.  The sandwich part was more of a macaroon type sandwich cookie.  Would I order it again?.....that'll be a definite no, because I couldn't get over the day glow fluorescent green color.   My tab with iced tea and tip came out to $21.  Service was attentive and pleasant.  Umami has valet parking.  But you can easily find street parking on La Brea during the day on the weekends.

Umami burger is actually one of my favorite places for burgers... My favorites include the Umami burger and the Manly burger... The only problem is  that I need to get two burgers to fill me up because they are so small... This ends up costing about 30 dollars which is too pricy... this is the reason I don't go very often...

i was gonna give this place 3 stars (rounded up from 2.5), until i reread my review after i wrote it and decided it was more fitting to round it down, despite knowing that i had hyped up expectations about it. how can something so good be so mediocre?! we got the port and stilson buger, and the umami burger. everything tasted really good individually. the onions were carmelized nicely, the cheese was good and melty, the meat was a good texture and cooked right, the mushrooms/tomatoes were sauteed and very flavorful, the bun was buttery and perfect size for the burger. however, when everything came together, it just was too much. everything tasted very... salty. and don't get me wrong, i LOVE salt. i eat my ramen with so little soup that i can taste more of the msg. but that much "umami" doesn't really belong on a burger i think. i think a burger should be more about the synergy of ingredients and less about making it salty and umami. we also got the fries and sweet potato chips. it was very bleh. the fries weren't bad, but that little bunch wasn't worth $3. the condiments were so tiny. i wanted ketchup, but that was barely enough for half of the fries. i also tried the garlic aioli, but i didn't taste the garlic and it just looked like buttery mayo. at the beginning, our service was really good, but then after we ordered, it went downhill. we saw one of the employees asked the other patrons how things were, but we never got asked anything, or got my water refilled, and we looked around to pay for awhile, but no one helped us so we had to go to the counter. i think it's cuz this whole family came in and it was all friends of the restaurant and then they decide to neglect us. the burgers aren't that big. i had 1 half of each of the 2 burgers, but then justin was still full from earlier so i ate the other half of his umami burger. the burgers really aren't BAD, but just not great. so salty! writing this, i still taste how salty it was. i'd recommend trying it once, cuz it's really an interesting take and it makes your burger really savory and totally non-burger like, but skip on the meh sides. i wish i brought some alcohol.

I finally made it to Umami Burger on a lazy Monday afternoon. I invited my brother to come along with me. We shared the Umami Burger and the Triple Pork Burger. Both were delicious but pretty expensive for a burger. When did burgers get to be over $10? There was quite a bit of people eating burgers at 3pm on a Monday. Recession? What recession? Anyway, we weren't hungry enough to get any sides or desserts. Maybe next time. The burgers are flavorful and delicious but the service is a bit cold and the prices are kind of ridiculous for what it is. It's better than The Habit...The Habit is better than In-n-Out...so this place is better than The Habit and In-n-Out but the prices here are higher by double or even triple. So you make the decision.

Went to this place this weekend with my friend and the man in the front was terrible! This was our first time here so I asked a couple of questions...questions that seemed to irritate the man. All I asked for was a slice of tomato in my burger and he said "If the cook is in a good mood they may add one". I thought he was joking but his face expression made it clear to me that he was very serious. I guess they get offended when you try to add things on their burgers. Then I asked if their burgers come with pickles and he said "Yeah, for $5". I was blown away and just said "Can I just have an All American burger please" he said "This isn't your typical BUILD YOUR BURGER place" ...my face expression  =0   I was shocked! I stopped asking and was extremely disappointed with this service. I hope the owners reevaluate the type of staff they hire for the front. I DO NOT recommend this place to anyone! Maybe when they get better staff in the front I'll possibly try it again. I wish we would of just gone to In-N-Out burger instead.

TONS OF tables open.. yet.. we had to wait 5 minutes for a seat.. i don't really understand why.. anywho.. id say this is more of a 3.5..i'm torn on the rating! i got the original umami burger and it was mmm mm tasty buuuuut the fries and onion rings were nothing special and minus a star for the ketchup and sauces... they had an asian flair in all the wrong ways if you know what i mean.. you get one free sauce with your burger and i got the garlic .. it was so werid.. the asian flair again.. but hey you might like it they only sell bottled sodas here because its natural cane sugar overall, that burger DID HIT THE SPOT for the night.. i guess that's why they call it umami

WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!! I've been looking forward to going to this place since I heard about it. Got there around 8:30pm on a Wednesday night with two other friends. The place is small (no big deal), sits about 20 - 25 people. You would think for such a small place, two waiters would not have any trouble serving. Nope. Once I walked in I could tell they had no idea what was going on. We walk in and all the tables are taken so we wait for an open table. BTW, they don't even write your name down so they don't know who came first. I'll get into this later. Standing around, I noticed that  everytime I saw the waiter deliver orders to tables he was immediately sent back because the order was wrong. Not exaggerating. This happened multiple times. One time he delivered 4 burgers to a table with two people. And one time he tried delivering 2 burgers to a table that was paying the bill! Really?!?! So a table finally opens up and we expect to sit since we were the first ones waiting for a table. Wrong, the manager or owner gives it to someone else saying that they were their first. Whatever, we don't make a big deal about it. Another table for two opens up. They say we can sit there or wait for a bigger table so the 3 of us can fit comfortably. We pass on the table for two and tell him we will wait. Finally, (45 minutes after we arrive) a table for 4 opens up. The waiter gives it to another party for two!!!!! We say that we were waiting for the table and that we just gave up another table to wait for the bigger table. The manager tells us that they were there before us! Literally ten minutes after he tried sitting us at another table and after we told him we would wait for the bigger. Did he not remember us from ten minutes ago?!? Did I take crazy pills? WTF is going on? After that we decided that it was time to leave. Didn't eat the burger. Went to Father's Office instead. You can always count on Father's Office. I don't know what is going on at Umami Burger but it is run by a bunch of douchebags. From what I saw, if you go to Umami Burger you will probably experience a long wait and an incompetent staff that will get your order wrong (if you ever get seated and have a chance to order).

Just fucking terrible.  But amusing.  Synopsis:  they had run out of so much food that we were forced into getting what was left.  They ran out of potatoes for their french fries.  They ran out of potatoes in America.  In L.A., around the corner from the farmer's market and across the street from an Albertsons.    They had no drinks left.  No soda, ice tea. No desserts.  The staff was stoned imbeciles grabbing each other's dicks. The layout of the restaurant is awkward, nobody greets you, it's BYOB (and bring your own drinks apparently).  But there's valet so you can get the fuck out quickly to get some real food.   There's a saying in the restaurant business:  good service can save bad food, but bad service will kill even the best food.  Umami has demonstrated this principle in HD clarity. We walk in and take a guess that we should seat ourselves, and find a spot in a renovated janitor's closet with bar-like seating facing the wall.  There was a sad looking small houseplant that looked like it had been shat on.  My dining partner recognized the origin of the art on the wall as coming from the dollar bin at Staples.  Since nobody came to give us menus or take our orders I went to the front counter and grabbed two menus.  The servers seemed...impatient to getting back to screwing around and playing grab-ass.  He came up and asked if we wanted drinks.  I asked for a beer and he told me it was byob.  Fine.  My partner wanted a diet coke.  They were out.  She asked for an iced tea.  They were out as well.  He then saved us some time and told us that they were also out of french fries and one of their burgers.  So we settled on the house specialty burger and some other patty of shit, their onion rings and their "market salad" (this was the complete description).   The burgers come with one special(!) condiment they make in-house.  Their umami ketchup is straight Ragu sauce, and the garlic aioli I asked for never came out.  But when the condiments do come out, they come out on asian ceramic soup spoons - a stingy spoonful.    The onion rings come out in a fucking rice bowl.  There were 6 total.  And the burger is placed in the middle of  a naked white plate, all alone.  My salad never made it which in hindsight was probably a blessing based on the food that had come out. Finally, when I went to pay, the server couldn't work the p.o.s machine and tried to do the bill in his head.  I had to remind him to take off the salad, which he insisted he did.  At this point I had had enough of this ridiculous monkey shit for service and asked for the receipt, told him to get a calculator and do the math.  He looked at me with this goofy ass grin and told me he was terrible at math. There are perhaps three times I can remember intentionally not tipping.  This was the third time.   the highlight of the evening is when you have to run across the street to get your drinks, there's a medicinal marijuana clinic next to the liquor store which is kind of interesting.   Otherwise, this place is a complete joke.  In fact, I am certain that Umami is a social experiment designed to see how bad service can get while still having customers fork over money.  Look for it on the Bravo channel this month. To the owners of this catastrophe - you will be removed from the food scene quickly. To potential customers - if you have any dignity and want some good chow, stay clear of this shithole.

pretty mother effin good. THE ORDER: ASSORTED PICKLES....2.5 stars....while not amazing, there were a couple highlights: the shiitake mushrooms (heaven).....ok just one highlight. The other pickles were just whatever. UMAMI Burger.....4 stars....great meat, beautifully crafted, and such a twist from normalcy. The parmesan crisp was weird, but delightful....the juices flowing were gorgeous and greasy. The only thing I didn't like was the shiitake....dunno why, bc I love mushrooms, but maybe there was just a bit TOO much going on?  .... The BUN!!! The bun is the bomb!! I didnt really notice how much I loved the dense, soft, chewy bun until half-way through....Mmmmm. ONION RINGS...3 stars....nice THICK cuts of onion, which was nice....but I'm not a huge tempura fan..... THICK CUT FRIES....4 stars...i love thick fries. Mmmm. SWEET POTATO FRIES.....3.5 stars....yummy, but I've had better MINT CHIP ICE CREAM SANDWICH....4.5 stars....the freaking cookies were to DIE for....well, since they r from Milk, you know they're good!!!! THE SERVICE: GREAT!! OVERALL...... I dont like the location.....but hell, the food is LEGIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh, and the size of the burger is PERFECTION. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND TO ALL YELPERS!! enjoy!! xo- andrea

i think i've pretty much found my favor "burger joint". i put burger joint in quotes because i don't really care for fast food type burgers but i do enjoy gourmet burgers. a couple of friends and i came down to socal for a mini weekend vacation and hit up a bunch of yummy eats around the city. of course... we heard about this small chain and needed to try their truffle burger!!! we got here around 3 and had to wait no longer than 15 minutes before being seated. our server/waiter was great and since we all knew what we wanted already.... our orders were put in swiftly and were brought out in the same fashion. 3 truffle burgers, cheesy tots with umami ketchup and garlic aoili was delivered to 3 hungry guests. and those 3 hungry guests devoured the entire thing within minutes! i dont really want to go into deep detail and description of the burgers because i don't want to be redundant with what other yelpers are saying... but i just have to say.....FOOD WAS BOMB. i wish the garlic aoili was a little more garlic-y, but that is my only "complaint". i was leaving socal thinking that my taste buds will not be graced with umami burger for while... but then i find out that an UMAMI BURGER just opened up in san francisco that same weekend i went down to socal... what are the odds?! so with that sad.... i will be writing a new review for a new location soon. ....very soon.

i've tried The Counter, Father's Office, and numerous other "best" burger joints and Umami tops them all.  I went there with 2 friends and had a taste of the Umami Burger, Hatch Burger, and Truffle Burger.  Onion Rings and Fat cut fries complimented all the tastes well.  The saddest part was when the food was gone.  I can't decide which burger was the best, because they were all amazing.  I definitely status updated my facebook after this.

After eating here I kept thinking of the story about The Emperor's New Clothes. I think everyone is raving about this place because it's cool right now. But it's nothing special, just over-hyped. My friend and I got seated with no wait. I had an Umami burger and fries. They were very good. The place is tiny (like the burgers) and the seating is claustrophobic. You can't help but listen to the conversations of others because you are two inches away from everyone. And the conversations in the place were not normal, they were "let me talk about something pretentious so it sounds like I'm important" conversations. I said the food was good. A better burger than McDonald's? Yes. But it wasn't better than any burger you'd find at any other gourmet burger joint or even a chain like Red Robin. Would I wait in line to get into this place? Absolutely not. It's no different than Pink's - you hear the hype, you wait in line, but in the end it's just a hot dog (in this case, just a burger).

the lamb burger has been taken off the menu. i repeat, the lamb burger has been taken off the menu. that means that there is now ZERO reason to go here. crappy service from servers who are blatantly stoned, dead flies on your table, uncooked burgers that really are as far from umami as you can get. im so sad. i loved that lamb burger. RIP most delicious thing ive ever eaten.

Good Burgers on both my visits, but the third visit we were met with indifferent service, or rather none as we walked out due to not being acknowledge by staff and we think owner. Plus the A/C was off and it was scorching hot inside. Owner appears arrogant.

this is a tough review for me to right because I expected so much of this place.  the word of mouth and the lines out the door and the reported expansion to two more locations speaks to the fact that these people must be doing something right.  and that said, even after an uneven experience during my first visit, I do think they have gotten right the most important part... the burger patty... whatever their proprietary blend of beef is, as well as the cooking method is just simply brilliant... that said... this is why a place with a 4.5 to 5 star burger patty getting just a 2 star rating for my first visit? 1.  the service was awful.  I know this place is busy, but I felt like we were rushed and that not enough care was taken to make sure the we were happy and our orders got right (which leads to)... 2.  they got my order wrong.  I ordered the "manly burger" and asked for garlic aioli as my spread... instead I got mustard.  now the manly has cheddar cheese on it which is a pretty strong flavor to begin with... to that add a strong, vinegary mustard to the mix, and the flavor of the  "main attraction" (the beef patty) got pretty well muted...   i also wasn't exactly overwhelmed with the portion size, but if everything else had fallen into place i would have happily overlooked the quasi-slider sized sandwich. but the worst part... when I pointed this out to my waiter... he refused to bring me a new burger and told me all he could do is bring me a side of aioli and that I would have to scrape the mustard off myself... excuse me?!?!?!  really?!? well... as you can imagine this put a damper on what was a very, very promising start. a bit of unsolicited advice to the management... I know you are doing well and maybe you are popular enough where you can give your customers the wrong order and basically give them the finger and tell them take it or leave it...maybe i'm old fashioned, but my feeling is that  customer service, good will, and quality control are things to take pride in, and will be things that will be more of a challenge to your operation as you execute your publicized expansion to 2 additional locations.   a great product without a good overall dining experience isn't always enough.... and for me in this case it wasn't... hopefully the next time I give this place a try (and I do plan too) I will have a better overall experience, and if that happens I will be happy to update my review accordingly, but on the basis of my first visit, I can only muster 2-stars for Umami...

Well, if you like burgers give 'em a try sometime. I can't usually get 'em myself because my girlfriend's a vegetarian which pretty much makes me a vegetarian. But I do love the taste of a good burger. Mm-mm-mm... Err sorry, cant convince any woman to be my girlfriend but the rest is pretty much true. God I love Pulp Fiction. Anyways, Unami... This viscerally Asian burger joint on the corner of La Brea and 9th hits the spot for true beef junkies who don't mind a pleasant deviation from the average super sized swill. The physical space is a little cramped and possibly already too small for it's burgeoning popularity but not yet obnoxiously so. Walking into a busy lunch service it isnt clear if you order at the counter or sit and wait but the confused lemmings milling around afforded this yelp educated hombre to grab a menu and present myself at the register ahead of the crowd. Suckers. It took a bit for someone to appear as there were only two guys working front of house but i ordered my burger and found a seat alone in the odd side room.  I felt bad for the table in the middle of the small room surrounded by bar stools on 3 sides but realistically, i got burgers to eat, scootch. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… The Burger showed up pretty quickly but while i was waiting i heard the lady behind me arguing with the server on how the lamb burger was a little pink and you should never serve it like that... i hate people that overcook lamb, it actually is much better pink, ugh. Anyways.  THAT IS A TASTY BURGER. I maintain a good burger is a good burger so in shades of grey it was as good as my other favorite burger spot Delux in AZ.   http://www.yelp.com/biz_… http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Everyone whining about the fries not being enough needs to stop suppersizing and realize that it is a perfect portion of potatoes for one human in one sitting.  Perfect overall, not really, they need to be much crispier/ salted better but obviously they are homemade and still pretty tasty.  I took a star off for having to order sides three times because they are so stingy with the homemade catchup, i got done with two and decided to try the wasabi house spread. Yum! http://www.yelp.com/biz_… After the satisfying meal i realized i had no cash to leave a busser tip so i figured i would grab desert, 4 bucks for a red velvet thing... DAMN. I wasn't going to be a dick and not tip so i grabbed one and left some cash. Eating it walking to my car i thought i had got a dyed red hostess cupcake, completely mediocre and flavorless. What a waste of four bucks but no stars off for another companies crap baking but that went 'in the bin' as Gordon would say. Next time i am trying the gelato espresso thing!

Personal faves: Manly Burger: it is really just that....made for a true man.  I have chest hair and everything!  Their in house cured bacon is simply delectable. Truffle Burger:  Like liquid Godiva mushroom....I want my very own French chateau with a truffle farm, and truffle sniffing pig and all.   Thick sliced fries w/ their amazing home made ketchup Beet salad: That ricotta was so rich I stopped after the arugula was gone. Cake Monkey: gourmet Ding Dongs and Ho-ho's, only in LA MILK ice cream sandwiches: Thai tea, rocky road, cookies n cream are my personal faves...the server will tell you what they have Tempura onion rings: best, EVER.  don't fall apart when you bite in, and you don't drag the whole onion out of the batter that first bite. Coke Lite: OMG, Look at me!!  I've officially turned into one of those chodes who say "they only have this in EUROPE". But they do. And @ Lemonade. Whatever. The following is the rant of all rants.  But opposite.  I am not here to rag on the restaurant.  I am here to rag on the sad excuse for "customers" aka ill-mannered disrespectful people children who make the staff's lives HELL.  I can tell.  I have served for 5+ years and I would have gone postal if anyone did just one of the following things...much less ALL of them..ALL at the SAME time.  Maybe you'll see yourself in this review and see the err of your ways.  MAYBE even learn a little something, but then again, maybe you won't. If it weren't so damn busy all the time, I would come here all the time.  If the burgers weren't around 1,000+ calories each...I would again, come here all the time.  If the other patrons of Umami were such despicable examples of human beings, I would come here even more. You know what's incredibly annoying and outrageous? 1) The fact that I saw 15+ Asians in the 2 hours I was there, AZN as well as straight up Asians (broken English and all) pound water cups on table tops, wave menus in waiter's faces, and simply shout "WATER" like a filthy heathen.  I feel that I am an exemplary example of a dignified Asian.  I am polite, precise, tip well, and use complete Webster approved sentences.  When did it become ok outside of San Diego Wild Animal Park to be so incredibly, disgustingly rude?!  Servers are not slaves or subhuman....I am sometimes so ashamed to be Asian, it isn't even funny.  And it costs me extra because I feel so badly for their behavior, I tip extra on top.   2) When ppl from Santa Monica track in and immediately say "Jesus Christ, you guys are SO FAR, I've never been to the I.E. before...this is the farthest I've been from the coast...I'm basically dry heaving from the desert heat." If you really think it's that far...STAY HOME.  If you're just gonna constantly compare it to The Counter and vocally express it to the service staff constantly as if they are supposed to magically jump on the kitchen line and sprinkle Umami magic....is absolutely nauseating.  If you are that much of a trendster sucking wanna be....but truly don't like it. Stay on the sand, puhlease.  The rest of us true believers will thank you for a shorter wait time. 3) Ridiculous new service standards from surrounding LA venues that allow crazy LA people to just talk to people however the hell they want. Restaurants that have suddenly started bending over and taking all kinds of verbal assaults from people are popping up all over the place. In the city where any "NO" can turn into a "YES" is even taking over the restaurant scene.   When the host/manager tells you it's a 40 minute wait, they aren't lying to you; it's the goshdamn truth.  And pulling that "5 year old kid" routine is aggravating to watch.  As in "it'll be a 40 minute wait", "but WHY?", "because...it's a 40 minute wait."  "BUT WHY!?!?!"  "There's a table right there that's empty."  "Sir....there is a line of 65 people ahead of you..and that table is for 4 of them." "But WHHYY!?! 4) The World Wide Web has been around for about 25 years now...I'm pretty sure everyone except those on skid row have some sort of access to it.  Please use it.  When the service staff is picking up phone call after phone call asking them to read the ENTIRE content of the menu, including the specifications, it kinda takes away from the service that the people who actually are there already, get.  I am also quite sure that those same people have access to either google map, mapquest, the Umami website itself, or a GPS system.  Yes, I understand La Brea is a LARGE STREET.  But the directions clearly say it is between OLYMPIC AND WILSHIRE!!!  Three of the LARGEST streets in Los Angeles County.....when the service staff again, is on the phone with retards that need block numbers, side streets, surrounding businesses then there are those who miraculously received their licenses asking "well...I don't understand those directions; I'm coming from West Hollywood....where do I go".  If you can't get there...you don't deserve to go to,

Had been hearing about this for ages and finally decided to go before I moved out of state. Had the truffle burger. The patty was very tender and overall tasty. Actually ended up having two because I enjoyed my first one, the portions are kind of small, and, hey, I was moving out of state! Maybe it was a mistake to have two in one night though. I came away feeling like, as good as it was, it was still overrated for the following reasons (in no particular order): 1. The wait was too long. 2. While the sweetness of the truffle burger was what made me like it initially, I realized by meal's end that I would have preferred a more delicate balance of flavors.  I still say nothing beats Father's Office, at least in LA. I love the combo of flavors and textures they present in their burger. For that matter, In n Out still beats Umami in my book. 3. I never thought I'd be saying this, but the tenderness of the meat and the way it seems to be...un-densely packed in the patty is a bit disconcerting. Maybe it was my own fault for ordering two of the same kind, but it's something I could easily see myself becoming sick of to the point of it grossing me out. 4. The ratio of price to the size of the burger is high. That being said, I'd go again if someone asked me to. Still debating whether I'd initiate another visit myself. Maybe to give the original Umami burger a chance. 3.5 stars

Call me crazy but this just didn't blow my mind. I had really high expectations because everyone told me these were the best burgers in LA. I ordered the california? Burger. It was good but not great. Definitely not worth $12. It was on the smaller side, and while the meat was good, I would definitely go somewhere else for an equally delicious and larger burger. Kudos on the great decor though. In n out anyone?

Gourmet fast food, that's what Umami offers. When my friend and I walked in, the place kind of struck me as an upscale fast food joint.  There was a counter, but you don't order there. We sat at a table in a room off of the main dining area.   The service was friendly and fast.  We ordered the truffle burger, pork belly burger, and couscous salad to balance out all the meat and carbs.  For the smallish portions, the price is a bit on the high side.  As for the burgers... anything with truffles or bacon are always delish!  The truffle burger was divine!  Not too truffly to overwhelm the beef.  Very juicy! At first I was unimpressed with the bun which is terribly plain, but my friend keenly pointed out how well the bun stood up to the juiciness. It didn't fall apart, holding the meat and fresh ingredients together.  The pork belly burger had a real kick to it, and the crispy bacon made it that much better!  The couscous salad was very simple and so fresh. I'm going to try to replicate at home - lemon juice, mint, eggplant, carrots, tomatoes, and couscous, which had a very nice texture to it - not too mushy.  I also had the strawberry lemonade, which was really good... maybe a little on the too sweet side, but I really liked that it had strawberry pulp. Service was so fast, the waiter was back to ask us how everything was before we even had a chance to bite into our burgers! But we didn't feel rushed at all to leave. In fact, we stuck around for a little more before leaving. I dig the creativity, flavors, and service!

This is a special LA tradition. I've never seen so much attention being paid to the making of a burger. The patties are perfectly placed onto the bun, which is perfectly toasted and branded with a signature U on top of it. This is fine-dining for burgers. It's an interesting approach to changing the social connotation of a food by making it special. It's an experience worth having, and a great get-together location for eating out!

Quick-tip: Umami Burger's "bar" area = awkward walk-in closet seating with no legroom, no alcohol and no bartenders Quick, quick-tip: eat at Golden State! Dear Umami Burger, Why do you think you can treat your costumers like shit just because your burgers are hype? My first and last experience here was a clusterfuck. The absent-minded hostess failed to remember anyone's name and could not seat guests in a timely manner. I could clearly see that the back patio was half empty and the front room had two or three open tables, but no one was being seated. After a 30 minute wait on a Sunday afternoon the hostess finally seated my girlfriend and I at the "bar". Bar = seats in a walk-in closet type room directing facing a wall with no leg room whatsoever. We sat there confused and frustrated with the whole experience so far. The server came out and he was super sarcastic with everything, which didn't help my frustration. At that point we were ready to leave but wanted to suck it up in hopes of redemption through the food. We ordered the Umami Burger, Port & Stilton Burger, onion rings and skinny fries. We also noticed that a party of two who has just arrived at the restaurant when we were being seated got seated promptly after us and they ended up getting their food before us too. Again...very confused and aggravated. When the cook delivered the sides to our table he literally tossed the fries and rings onto the counter-top and trotted away. Our burgers arrived about a minute after the sides and they were on the smallish side. It's about the same size of an In-n-Out burger but the patty is about 3/4-inch thick. The soft bun did not offer much to the burger, taste or texture wise. The medium rare bloody meat would soak through the bun and dye your bread red and get mushy quickly. The blue cheese and meat combo was good, but when is that combo ever bad? It was nothing to rave about. The meat has a funky "Asian supermarket" taste I couldn't get passed. My girlfriend did not like her burger at all. She said the more she ate it the more the flavors were creeping her out. Fries are fried three times so its basically hard chips. Onion rings were there only good thing about the meal. Not the best onion rings ever, but pretty tasty. Overall very disappointing food and service. Don't waste your time and money here. There are tastier options available with workers who actually give a shit.

I had several people tell me Umami makes the best burgers they've *ever* had. I finally took my wife there - both of us with chips on our shoulders, anxious to dissent with our friends' hype. Unfortunately, they were right - Umami makes the best burgers either of us have ever experienced! They are a grade above The Corner. And, to boot, they make the second-best beet salad we've ever had (surprisingly, first place goes to The Cheescake Factory of all places). So why not five stars? Maybe it's just this location, but it is ridiculously cramped, service is inexperienced if well meaning, valet is expensive for this kind of place, and there's always a long line (not just because the food is good, but because they didn't plan enough tables). There's a new location coming to The Grove soon, which is actually closer to us, so hopefully that eliminates most of these issues and it can go to five stars for that one maybe...

I don't get the appeal. I've not had the service issues others have had at either the La Brea or Santa Monica location--well, at SM the server was pretty chilly. But having tried most of their burgers I found them underwhelming. I don't find the flavor profile very appealing and an hour later I feel like I've eaten an anvil. They are unrelentingly greasy and heavy and the umami tastes like soup mix seasoning to me. I've gotten take out from the La Brea location a couple of times and the bag was soaked through with grease when I got home. Bleh.

Heard about this place from thrillist. I should preface this review by saying, other than a few Sweet potato chips, I did not get to eat the food because the owner was rude to my girlfriend, so we left. So this is a service-based review only. Upon entering, the restaurant was full. I went up to the counter to order and the owner promptly said he would be right there. I waited about 5 minutes before another worker finally took my order, all good, it was busy after all. After I placed the order we were told that they were out of french fries and potato salad, but they did give us free drinks to compensate. We waited for about 30 minutes before our food came out. Not so bad, considering the couple next to us was waiting for close to an hour. After looking at her burger, my girlfriend asked to have it cooked a little longer, then the owner came out. He took the plate from her and proceeded to say, "Next time you need to tell us to cook it more when you place the order." We then explained we were never given that option to which he said, "Our burger is served rare." (as if we knew that) These words don't express his condescending tone. The owner brought out a more appropriately cooked burger to my girlfriend, who was still upset by his attitude just a few minutes earlier so she decided to be brutally honest. She told him he was rude and he shouldn't talk to his customers in that manner. His response was, "I will keep that in mind." We proceeded to thank our server, tipped him, and left the food untouched. Too bad because the burgers looked tasty. With the owner's attitude it's no wonder the executive chef walked out on the first weekend of business. Not all was bad though. The shaggy haired server was great. Very nice and attentive. Also the menu looked good and the prices were reasonable, although, I don't know how the food will maintain it's quality without the main chef keeping a watchful eye. Maybe this place will figure itself out after it tweaks the management issues.

Way overhyped in my opinion.  Good beef patty but it's a bit small, I liked the bun, and my truffle burger had only the faintest hint of any truffle. The stilton burger was okay.  What I don't get are the sides.  The fries were disgusting super large cut and soggy.  $3 bucks for like 4 of them.  The onion rings were $2.50 and "aiiite" but we only got 5 in our order.

Omg, why isnt everyone giving 'em 5 star ratings???! What is wrong w/you people? lol Anyhooters, my review for Umami Burger is long overdue, but can be summed up in 3 simple words: Umami is BOSS! Best burger evaaaa. I've been to this location & the SaMo one & I definitely prefer this one; easier to find & the food quality just seemed better. I always get the Truffle Burger cos it's the tastiest one imo. The patty is tender and juicy, the bun is soft yet sturdy even with the burger's natural juices, truffle sauce, & melting cheese. Mmmm! To die for!! Get this one, and don't forget the sweet potatoe fries & onion rings!

We visited here on a Saturday afternoon around 3 o'clock, and Umami was nearly at capacity (very limited capacity - this place is a shoebox!). But there was no wait, the staff were friendly, and the burgers were both gorgeous & tasty! I had the Umami Burger while my husband tried the Manly Burger. We both loved our respective choices, and split an order of fries, which were okay. It is definitely a little pricey, and I wish they had fountain sodas, but overall, I loved Umami and will be returning.

OK, I love Umami Burger--the food. Actually dealing with Umami Burger the restaurant is not so amazing. First, the food. The burgers here are fantastic and interesting. I love the Umami burger and the port and stilton burger, and their veggie burger is also great. My absolute favorite, though, is the truffle burger. It is so decadent and rich with deliciousness, I have carnivore dreams about it. Mmm. Their fries and sweet potato fries are also super tasty, and I really like their homemade ketchup as well as the aioli. Side salad is meh, but my boyfriend is dumb for getting a side salad at a burger place. Oh, and they have Mexican bottled Coke and other tasty interesting sodas. Yay! Now, the experience...This location is absolutely overloaded with people 24/7. I think I have dined here once, and that one time the wait was about 20-30 minutes, not unbearable but not stellar. Every other time I have done take out, which is nearly as chaotic. You have to shove your way into the restaurant to get to the counter to order, shout your order to the distracted (though polite!) staff, and then go back outside to wait with the throngs waiting for a table. And even then you wait at least 15-20 minutes. The worst, one recent Saturday night (how silly of us) my boyfriend and I decided we wanted Umami at around 9pm. He was out and about so I tried to call in our order, and I kept calling for 45 minutes only to get a busy signal, get put on hold and never answered, or to just have the phone ring and ring and ring and have no one pick up. When my boyfriend got there, he couldn't even get in the door, so he turned back. Needless to say, we didn't end up getting Umami that night. Oh, and parking is absolutely horrific. They have a tiny lot that is valet only, and even if you are just stopping in for takeout, they make you pay. There is very little non-permit street parking in the area. I have gotten parking tickets in the area thinking I could pop in and out before parking enforcement found my car, but no luck. So don't even think about it! Get a meter, or park a few blocks away and walk. BUT, if you want the Umami, you have to have the Umami, it is worth the hassle. Because it is sooooooo good.

Alright it was good, I can't deny that one,  but was it the best...Well we went here last night before seeing a show at the El Rey. I ordered the Port & Stilton Burger, which has bleu cheese & onion cooked in Port. Meat was cooked perfect slightly rare and the buns were great, however it wasn't the best. Hubby had the Unami Burger, which had a Parmesan Crisp on top, great touch, also cooked perfect. Fries sucked, we ordered their signature fries, that are cooked 3 times, flavorless. I washed mine down with a Grape Crush & hubby had Orange Crush, all for $33. Would I go back, maybe, I wouldn't mind trying the Manly Burger. Honestly The Counter & Slaters reign supreme in my book

Umami Burger was goood!! Different! This place was simple and straight to the point. The servers were very knowledgable of their product and very quick probably since the place is small and they only had like 10 things on the menu. Overall, the burgers were good, small to medium sized for $10. Sweet Potato Fries is not on their menu but they had it and it was good. We didn't try any of the desserts but I heard good things about them.

After a stressful weekend moving, I decided to cave in and get an actual burger from Umami. I ended up getting the Truffle Burger and oh-my-goodness.... it was AMAZING. I love truffle sauce and flavor on anything and everything but for some reason, on the meat patty- it tasted that much better. It's not an overwhelming amount of truffle oil- it's just the right amount. We also got the sweet potato fries which complimented the burger very well. I would definitely go back for this burger....

I love Umami burger, one of my favorite restaurants. But I feel like this particular location isn't so great. It's been really hit or miss, last time it was a miss... Food took forever, a couple who sat down next to us about 10 minutes after we did, got their food 15 minutes before we did, and don't give me that bull about the "ordering system" because they got the exact same thing as we did aside from the fries? I mean really? I got the manly burger, but my burger was overcooked and dry, and it's safe to say I won't be coming back to this location. Oh, and the server seemed annoyed with us, every time I'd ask him for more ketchup or napkins he'd roll his eyes and it seemed like I was inconveniencing him.  I'll stick to the Umami in Los Feliz from now on.

holy cow.  literally.  these peops rever the cow post mortum as the cow should be revered.  decorated in delectable jewels aplenty, cushioned on a complimentary and supportive throne, heated to a juicy juicy temp (no royal anology on this one)- our burgers were PERFECT. we sat down and started ordering like we had never seen a menu- calling out items as our eyes landed on them.  blue cheese burger, umami burger, so cal burger.  fries, onion rings, sweet potatos and snap pea salad, pickle plate.  as we were waiting, one in our party of 3 wandered to the counter and came back with a tin foil wrapped exploding bite of heaven- a chocolatey peanut butter marshmellow slice of cloud.  went a little bit strange with the pickle plate that arrived first, but no problem.   the pickle plate astounded us.  some of the offerings were so spicy we thought they should have come with a red toothpick flag in them.  a pickled poblano pepper- i think it was.  other things took our taste buds to foreign lands and new realities- specifically- a pickled watermelon rind that has to be tasted to be believed.   as we finished our pickles and chocolate, our burgers arrive with the other sides, in addition to 5 long spoons that held an array of different dipping sauces we must have ordered in our frantic stuccato stream of menu consciousness 10 minutes before. our burgers blew our brains out of our brains.  they were so good, that that first sentence actually means something.  we werent asked how we wanted our meat cooked and that was just fine as the chef knows what he is doing back there.  the umami and the socal had a roasted tomato on it that was incredible.  the umami also had a parmesan crisp on it and soem grilled mushroom.  bombtastic.  the blue cheese burger was the perfect compliment of salty and oozey and was my favorite. we cooled things down with some ice cream sandwhiches that umami imports from MILK on beverly.  a mint chip and a white chocolate rasberry that MILK makes specifically for Umami. the atmosphere is unimportant.  a dozen-ish simple tables in the front and i dont know what was doing in the back.  mod-ish beachy inspired pretty cool large prints on the wall and a hispter waiter or two for good measure.   dont come here for romance, unless of course your definition if romance is mouth and meat.  then this is your sure bet.   freakishy delicious. post meat nap i was ready to come back for dinner.  hot damn.

I really liked Umami, I didn't love it. I enjoyed the Turkey miso more than the umami burger, as i felt my burger lacked seasoning, and i tasted the toppings more than the patty. The turkey was very juicy, which was good because ground turkey can dry out pretty quick. The thick cut fries were solid, although we were just handed ketchup, and i thought we were gonna have options (garlic aioli sounded good.) I would also not call these burgers, but rather jumbo sliders. It was a very good lunch, but i can see this as kind of a light dinner, even for burgers. Had nothing to do with my experience, but my dining companion and i both noticed the compactness of the restaurant versus the spaciousness of the restroom. They could easily fit one or two tables in there, and judging by some of the reviews, certain people would gladly sit in a bathroom to eat these burgers. I am interested to go back and try items such as the triple pork and the port and Stilton, but not a place I would hurry back to.

ok, long review. just look at the pictures I posted and say you didn't think about grabbing your keys and driving there... ------------------- Umami, maui, maim, umi...sorry, I was obsessively playing anagrams on those personal TVs on my flight back to NYC.  Now I think of it, my frantic finger pushing of that touch screen must have bothered the hell out of the person sitting in front of me.   Anyways, UMAMI burger, OH MI MAMI this is one great burger place.  Umami means the 5th sense.  After smell, sight, touch, sound, I guess my 5th sense was best described as...orgasmic.   BUNS!  My dear readers, buns are a very very important item.  I've had a lot of buns in my life...firm and soft, all shapes and sizes.  I thought I had found my favorite (brioche) but these Portuguese/Asian buns proved me so wrong.  Pillowy soft yet firm enough to hold its own, this slightly sweet BURGER bun was a cross between brioche and a coconut bun from a Chinese bakery. My favorite was the So-Cal burger which is like an upscale In-n-out burger, with butter lettuce, a 3 quarter pound beef patty, home made gruyere cheese mixture, tomatoes and their house-made sauce.   The Umami Burger was the essence of a 5th sense.  The juicy beef patty is cut with a crispy parmesan cheese wafer.  Even the tomatoes are grilled, which apparently brings out more flavors.  Oh, and top that with grilled mushroom, which makes everything twice as good, this burger was kick ass. The blue cheese they used was way too overpowering in their blue cheese burger.  And the grilled sweet onions took away too much from the subtle natural beef flavor of the patties.   Finally, if you like onion rings, you cannot miss these golden beauties.  Called tempura onion rings, these are breaded with extremely thin tempura mix and come amazingly crispy and salted with large sea salt.  How come nobody has every thought of salting onion rings?! It's amazing! I was bummed that they sold out of what is supposed their most popular burger, the Triple Pork Burger, with ground pork, chorizo, smoked bacon, aged manchego and pimento aioli!!!  You know where I can be found next time I'm in LA.

I had the triple pork burger, my first pork burger ever and it did not disappoint. Although a bit pricey for only a burger, it was unlike any I have ever tried, definitely not your traditional burger. The chorizo complemented the pork patty and the pimenton aioli was very good. I also tried the manly burger, but I didn't really like it. The beer cheddar cheese was way too over-powering, it was the only thing I could taste on the burger. I also had the onion rings, they were delicious! Something else I really enjoyed were the buns on the burger, they were ultra soft and airy...definitely some of the best buns on a burger I have ever had. I probably wouldn't come here on a frequent basis, but I will go back!

Umami Burger, The Fifth taste. I ponder what that fifth taste is suppose to taste like since most of the flavors was totally over ruled with salty greasiness. The presentation of the dishes are very creative and appealing. But overall I would say I was not highly impressed... Mainly going in with the expectation that this place is suppose to be an AMAZING BURGER JOINT! I tried the Umami Burger and the Turkey Miso. Both the meats were very dry and loaded with salt. The buns were bit soggy, but that's because they choose to use the sweet hawaiian roll breads as the buns, which in my opinion a creative call on the dish but for overall texture could not justify to call it an AMAZING BURGER. The place is small, typical for any eatery in Los Angeles, contemporary, and simple. The rest of the menu is also very limited and also great presentation. Out of all the places for great burger joint, I just find this place to be OK and bit over priced for the quality of food. Would I go there again? Probably for the Umami but could care less for the Turkey. I would need to be treated to go this place again. However, I will say I give kudos for the culinary creatively on the burgers! But would perhaps encourage some improvement on few of the dishes.

I should note coming in that this is not a review of the food.  Because I didn't get a chance to eat any.  Or even look at the menu for that matter.  I should also disclaim, I understand, on a scorching summer Saturday, when half of the restaurant's seating is outdoors, there's gonna be a wait.  But still, there are different ways to handle it.  Now then. I stopped in by myself to finally check the place out, and it was packed.  I was directed to a side/back room: tiny, cramped, with a counter lining 3 walls.  i sat down at the counter.  I had to sit sideways because the counter was too low for my legs to fit underneath.  My back was against the chair of the poor girl at the table behind me; my elbow was not far from the head of the woman sitting around the corner.  Not ideal. I waited for a menu.   I was surprised as I came in that this place was a sit-down.  It feels like it'd be more of an order-at-the-counter setup, but whatever.  Waited a few minutes more, when a party of two at a slightly less uncomfortable spot in this thimble of a room left, seemingly because a table had opened up in the main dining room.  I snagged their spot. I waited for a menu.   Or a glass of water, or any sort of sign that somebody knows that I'm actually there.  None came.  After another few minutes, the party of two came back -- apparently their table didn't happen.  But in that time, someone had taken my original spot.  Oy. This place had the sort of fend-for-yourself feel that's more akin to the waiting area at the DMV than any sit-down restaurant.  It's odd too, because there seemed to be a lot of waitstaff milling around, but it was still chaotic.  Counter dining makes sense if there's a waitress on the other side, or a sushi chef, or at least a window -- but who thought it'd be pleasant to eat facing a wall? So, considering I hadn't gotten any sort of service yet (at least 10 minutes after sitting down), I had no qualms about walking out.  I got back in my car, drove to 8 Oz., was immediately seated at my own table in their spacious, charming dining room, and had myself a delicious burger.

I had no idea what I was getting into but after Jon B. said "beer cheddar cheese and bacon lardon" in a burger, I knew I had to try this place.  Knowing it was a burger chain, I was expecting fast food so imagine my surprise when not only we arrived to find "valet parking" but also a line out the door as this is actually a sit-down restaurant.  Yes, a waiter even comes by and takes your order for food and drinks.  Of course, as it was my first time, I was overwhelmed with both the burger choices and the drink choices.  Ginger beer?  House made lemonade?  And how many burger choices? We finally decided on the Manly burger and on the Triple Pork (chorizo and applewood smoked bacon!!) and a side of sweet potato fries.   After just enough time for us to salivate over your neighbors plate (and the desserts and everything within eyesight), they finally bring out our order.  And as I cut into the Manly burger, I couldn't help but notice that it'd been cooked medium rare (the only way red meat should be cooked).  The Triple Pork on the other hand was cooked through though still rather juicy.  I'm not sure what it was about the Manly burger but there was a hint of horseradish that gave it the slightest hint of spiciness.  With the juiciness of the medium rare meat, I thought this was the winner of the evening.  After two bites of this, I thought it was only fair to switch over to the Triple Pork burger for comparison.  While the Triple Pork is delicious, it's more subtle in taste.  Had I only had the triple Pork by itself, I would have deemed it a fantastic burger.  But next to the Manly burger, it was a tough act to follow.  Even with the applewood smoked bacon. The sweet potato fries were good though after my half of each burger, I was full.  I think sizes are more than fair.  My glass of lemonade was delicious and my sip of the ginger beer left me envious enough to wonder whether I should get one as well..  Oh, well, there's always next time..

who hasn't reviewed umami?  it's just good like that, once you get past the wait, it's delicious.  a nice solid burger experience. i've been there twice and always got  the Umami Burger, b/c it's so juicy, but I always manage to snag a bite of my date's burger.  i've tried i think the port and stilton (i didn't like it so much, but my friend did); and the truffle burger.  I'm not usually impressed by truffle oil,  but wow, the flavor of this one made my umami burger pale in comparison, it was so rich! like... wow, gotta take a gulp of root beer, i could only have 2 bites because it was so mouth-filling and decadent, but they were damn good salty, rich and creamy bites.   Sides - onion rings were good light, not greasy; fries - not good; sweetpotato/snap pea salad - ehh... i could do without it.   The condiments, as much as they try to hype it up, aren't that great.  The curry katsup at Golden State is way better. Is it as good as FO? hmm.. probably not.  Should you try it, yeah, if its convenient and you're up for something new.  why not, life's to short - have fun..

Delicious burgers; crappy service.  To be fair though, I think it was just our server who was terrible because the others seemed to be doing a much better job at other tables.  She never told us the specials- we didn't know there were any until we overheard another server at another table.  Our food took FOREVER to come and she only realized to check on it after 30 minutes had already passed.  When the food finally came we had no place settings and still had to wait... She was terrible. Burgers were juicy and delicious as always; Smushed Potatoes were very tasty, but nothing to rave about for days.  I love their homemade catsup.  Overall, I'd go back if I were craving a thick juicy, original burger and didn't care about the price ($10-12 for just the burger, which isn't huge), but I'd either get take-out or go to another location.

I've been wanting to try this burger joint for a while now and finally had the chance to check it out this past weekend.   Trying to decide between Stilton burger and Truffle Burger, I went with Stilton.  My friend had the turkey burger which she claimed was one of the best ones she's tried in a long time.  My Stilton burger was cooked perfectly and the patty was really fresh.  Onions and cheese melted together well.  Flavor wasn't too bold but perfectly blended.  Bun of the burger was really delicious also.   Size of the burger is pretty small so if you are looking for large all-american burger, order two. We also got onion rings...delicious and fries...which was good but can cut back on the salt.  I didn't really appreciate their ketchup and mustard was bit too strong.   I would definitely come back to this place for some gourmet burger.

The burgers are quite tasty and cooked just right (slightly pink). However, that's about the only positives. The services are consistently bad (long wait, unorganized seating system, long cooking time, zero refills, wrong orders, etc). Try The Golden State for comparable burgers without the attitude.

i really like umami burger for a number of reasons: -the lighting gives my digital camera's macro setting good exposure without having to use the flash so i can snap shots for my food blog. s. -i got good iphone reception there so i could check yelp and other reviews to figure out what to order -the food has a lot of blogofoodie buzzwords like umami (DUH), house-made, cane sugar, aioli, market salad, etc, so i know that when i talk about the place to my online friends, that i'll be able to sound really clued in about modern gourmandism and culinary connoisseurship. - the tables are close enough together so that i can oogle other people's food. in fact, DC (DUH) and I were first seated at the counter around the smaller side dining room...so close to the couple in the one central table that i feared i would be invading their personal space if we stayed there. so we chose to sit outside instead of wait. no space heaters, just traffic noise, exhaust fumes and cold air. OH, the burger. right. yeah. it was good. i can't remember anything specific about it but i'll probably try it again sometime. ok ok ok i'm kidding. the umami burger was good. for some reason it didn't hit me as viscerally as, say a houston's bbq burger, but it was good. i'll go back and try other things on the menu. i think a big part of the experience was the environment, which was pretty spartan and generic, lacking the creature comforts and patina of a more lux place like taylors or the lo-fi charm of a cassell's or apple pan. it had all the charisma of a california chicken cafe. and the onion rings and fries are aiight too. maybe a little under done and too big perhaps. anyway, expect an update. i'll be back.

the bf and i have been wanting to go to umami for a while and finally got a chance. we sat outside which was great because it was such a nice day! :) the waiter suggested the watermelon juice saying "the girls love it *wink wink*" im not sure what he was getting at. hahah it was like eating a fresh slice of watermelon with out the grittiness! i ordered the Port & Stilton Burger (Blue cheese, pocas port-caramalized onions) ohhh eemmmm geee. the bread is so buttery and i think they brushed some more butter on top (shiny). i used to hate blue cheese growing up but im learning to really appreciate it especially with meat. the caramlized onions gave it a sweetness and it all was just so omg delicious. at first glance you'd think wtf its so small im going to still be hungry, but we were pretty full afterwards. Port & Stilton.... best burger i've ever had... by far. the bf got the Umami Burger because it was their "signature burger" even though the waiter had suggested the Hatch which sounded better. plus after working in a restuarant for 3.5 years, i trust the waiter/waitress when i ask them what they recommend/what is the most popular. i digress. anyway, this had a crispy sheet of parmesan cheese (yum by it self!), roasted tomato, shiitake mushroom and the umami ketchup. i think that the roasted tomato and umami ketchup was too much tomato and you couldnt taste the parmesan and i think the shiitake just blunts any taste. this was okay. we got the Handcut Fries. wow i dont know what it was about these fries but wow. it must be because they are triple cooked and maybe it is the oil (?) that they fry them in. actually im not even sure if they fry them, they arent oily at all and barely crispy on the outside. the inside is so tender and so perfectly cooked. its lightly salted but there is some other flavor that we couldnt quite put our finger on. it comes with a side of the umami ketchup. we also got the Malt Liquor Tempura Onion Rings. okay, just the fact that its onion rings made with tempura batter, you can tell it tastes different. it was so light and crispy and the onion is still moist and flavorful. it is especially airy and crispy because of the malt liquor. yowza. also comes with a side of umami ketchup. when you order a burger, you can get an extra side sauce. the roasted garlic aoili was a-may-z-ing! you can totally taste the roasted garlic. the sweetness and char taste. wow. its no joke. the consistency is like mayo. the house sauce was described by the waiter like thousand island/spread. yeah its pretty much like that, but better! i think it might be because it was like it was all blended together so it wasnt really chunky. it had a sweetness to it that you can taste the relish. the aoili tasted awesome with the fries and the house sauce was awesome with the onion rings. i got suckered into dessert with a Pumpkin Ice Cream Sandwich. since its the season, they have pumpkin ice cream sandwiches! (i just realized that they get their ice cream sandwiches from MILK. dang, i guess i have to give MILK another shot =P) anyway, this was awesome. you can actually taste the PUMPKIN, unlike alot of other "pumpkin" flavor things they have now days (i.e. pumpkin ale, pumpkin latte, etc) its like eating a really cold pumpkin pie with little tiny chocolate chips in it in between MILK's Ooey Gooey Chocolate Chip Cookie. hello!

Tell me I am not a connoisseur of "good" food or whatever but I know overrated when I see it.  Honestly?  Not too impressed.  I did love the ketchup that they make on their own and the truffle oil concoctions are to die for, but the umami burger itself?  Meh.  It's not like the beef is extra special or anything.  And this whole "best hamburger" of Socal business is...not cool.  Hello?  In N Out?  How does anyone beat that?  Anyway, like I said, the ketchup is special and ok, I will give them that their Truffle Burger is awesomely delicious, but that's also highly due to the fact that I love mushrooms.  All-in-all, it was good, not bad, but the burgers are small, everything is overpriced and too hyped.  I love you In N Out.

The decision about what to rate Umami burger was a really tough one--harder than usual.  I hadn't heard about it, but happened by around lunchtime, and since I was early for an appointment.  The Umami burger was very good.  But at $8, it didn't come with fries.  They were an additional 3 dollars.  They were good.  But $11?  I don't know.  The garlic potato salad tasted incredible, but the consistency wasn't great.  Maybe because they weren't waxy or red potatoes, but others (including purple) instead.  The "umami" stuff about the burger was good.  But the parmesan cheese wasn't strong enough to hold its own against the meat and portabello.  That said, the place is expensive.  I don't know.  I'd probably come back, next time with booze.  But they really ought to be able to give you a burger and fries, however fancy, for $10.

I don't understand the rave of this place? The burgers are okay. Onion rings... okay. DO NOT have them sit you outside in the back area. That area stinks of old beer bottles that has been left out for days. Do they even serve beer? I can't remember. Overall experience... their garlic sauce was the best they had there, but the gf loved everything there.

Yippity-ky-Ay mini sirloin burger.....oops, wrong place.  Burgers are between $9-$11 and they are small. Sides are small also (picture of fries below is basically what you get for $4). The umami burger had a good taste but definitely did not compare to F.O. standards, dipping sauces were o.k., fries were nice and thick but the serving was micro-size.  I'm not sure why people are giving this place high ratings....maybe the 'cool' factor, who knows. Valet parking for a burger spot....are you kidding? Basically, another over-priced specialty place that left me leaving hungry.....and trust me, I usually don't have a giant appetite. Sorry umami, there's bigger and better burgers in town so I won't be returning.

alright, so after reading an article on yahoo about this place being the best burger in LA. my boyfriend and i knew that it was something that we had to try out. after much debate and serious hesitation [because father's office let me down twice] we finally decided to take the plunge. we got seated fast because there was only two of us. the place is pretty small. street parking is hard to find. there is valet parking. although im not quite sure how much that was because there was no signs. so the couple next to us was finishing up their meal so i had to ask what they ordered. after reading yelp and their inputs we ordered the onion rings, string fries, umami burger, and truffle burger. portions are small. not that much condiments. ketchup tasted home-made because it wasn't like heinz. umami burger wasn't great. it was greasy, oily, and wasn't that appetizing. the truffle burger. now that thing was good! i would highly recommend people to try this burger! its simple but very tasty! onion rings didnt have much batter a bit oily and flakey. string fries weren't bad. my boyfriend liked them a lot. service was pretty good. tables are small. they take CC. it was in deed expensive for a burger but i guess it is the location, they've been featured as the best burger, and so forth therefore they can charge for people for more. if you order a coke its mexican bottle coke. which doesnt taste good until you ask for a glass of ice to pour it into. then you'll taste the fizzle! i left feeling not full so maybe next time i have to get 2 burgers. i did see the couple next to me with an ice cream sandwich and that sucker looked good! try it out for yourself to see if this is a place for you or not. i would say its about half. some ppl love it and some don't.

I'm usually no burger fan, but a co worker of mines told me about this place and that I MUST try because it's just so gOod. Ok, so one Friday night that I didn't have any plans or wanted to go out. My lovely bf and I went all the way to LA to get some burgers.. just to see what this place is all about. We went about 9pm, it was busy but wasn't crazy packed because the place was about to close within an hr or so. We sat and I ordered the Manly Burger (well done because I wasn't feeling the bloody burger) Oh man the burger was DELiSsSsHh! My bf got the signature burger...It was 6x Umami or something like that. He said it was bomb diggity! We also shared sweet potato fries and beer battered onion rings. Geez, the onion rings had more oil than all of our food put together! It's been about a month since I've had Umami and I am craving to return! I say it's a must try and of course skip out on the onion rings! And yes it's about $10 bucks a burger and the prices has gone up about a buck since my co worker last went.

all the burgers in the pictures look bigger and better than what i had. pictures are indeed so deceiving. i was visually disappointed when i saw my small burger sitting on a square white plate. the truffle burger was so greasy from the truffle cheese sauce that when i picked it up, all this liquid dripped and splashed onto my plate. the flavor of the meat patty was good and juicy, the truffle was aromatic, but i left hungry. the fries are ok, served with a small amount of dipping sauce squirted into a chinese soup spoon. can i have more sauce please? no. all in all, the flavor of the burger is good. nice patty, nice ingredients and flavorings, tasty fresh toasted egg bread.

I was really excited about this place. I figured BYOb is pretty cool, though I wish I could order a beer there dince I didnt bring any.  As I looked at the menu, I was already considering what I was going to order when I came back a second time.   Well, thats not going to happen. I started with onion rings and the Triple pork burger: ground pork, spiced witrh chorizo and bacon. Sounds amazing, but it was only so so. Id give it a 3.5 out of 5 stars.  The malt liquor tempura onion rings also sounded pretty exciting, but nothing special.  After all this though, i was still tihnking I would come back to try the Port and Stilton burger. But the first burger wasnt very big so I decided to order a second burger.  Fifteen minutes after the order, they came to tell us our burgers would be out shortly, 15 minutes later, they told us the same thing, and about ten minutes later, the burgers finally came out, but the order was wrong.  They said it would be another 20 minutes before the correct burgers were ready. I took mine as is, my friend just canceled the order. Mine, the port stilton, was pretty good, reminded me of fathers office, but only half as good. The worst of it though was aside from the slow service, the owner was a huge dick. Any time we needed something we seemed to be bothering him.  They didnt seem to have enough silverware or cups for the amount of people in the restaurant.   We got there early and beat the rush but they were still out of onions and apparently they ran out of meat while we were there and thats why the long wait for the second round of burgers.  We asked the owner "whats on the umami burger?"  because the description only described it as being their signature burger. His response; "it has umami on it"  Thanks asshole. Lifes to short for me to go a second time and its too short for you to try it a first time if you havent.  Let my loss be your gain and skip it.  though i will say again, that the food is a 3.5...

Umami Burger ummmm~ makes me want one more lol. The burger here is one of the best burgers in LA.  Its super creative and fresh. It take you to another level of burger. The patty melts in your mouth when you have the first bite. Everything else combines creating a fulfilling sensation =)  This is not just a burger, its a enjoyment of life!  I guarantee you will ask for more after the first burger. Owner Adam is very nice too so are the entire staff. They love to see your satisfied face when you have your first bite. Highly recommended!!

Trendy, cozy and reasonably priced. I was about to try the Earth Burger because the menu description seemed to be stuff with endless amounts of ingredient which instantly sold me. Right when I was about to order it..I realized, when people call it "Earth"-something it has a connotation of being vegetarian..something I'm not (I love my meat!). So instead  I tried the truffle burger and I couldn't have been more happier. I might try the Earth burger eventually, it did sound really good and the fact they use an edemame patty IS intriguing. The thin cut and thick cut fries are a must with any of the burgers. Also try the ice cream sandwich, a group next to us made us drool over it!

The truffle burger is the best burger that I have ever eaten! The manly burger holds a close second place. But even the bottom half of my top ten list at Umami is better than the #1 burger anywhere else. The tempura onion rings & garlic aioli dip are amazing! And the ice cream sandwiches from "Milk", yum!

hype hype hype!  i went to this burger joint over the summer after all the hype about it being an amazing burger.  im not sure if it was the hype but i was disappointed.  the burgers are small for $10+, you can probably get a heartier one at the counter.  it isnt super flavorful like fathers office, i got their namesake burger (the umami burger) and it tasted like two super greased up in n out buns, a bland unseasoned patty and a ton of ketchup inside.  shouldnt the name sake burger be the most delicious? i think their truffle burger is what saved them in that it was very very flavorful.  so stick with that and youll be fine.   skip the onion rings as well.  really oily tasting. theres a separate dark small room in the back where they sat us with really weird acoustics so you could hear everything everyone was saying in that room even if you were whispering.  cramp. tight. dark. no like. otherwise, this place is okay but dont hype it up in your mind like i did. -E

I have mixed feelings regarding this place.  I tried it for the first time last night because a friend of mine lives by it and has been craving it for a while.  The BYOB feature made it all the more compelling.  But it seems to me that the only difference between a normal burger spot in LA and a Fancy burger spot is that at the fancy place, they decorate better, and treat you worse. The place looks nice, but is a little cramped.  When we walked in, there was no one to greet us or let us know who to talk to, and even when we walked to the counter, no one talked to us.  We had to basically grab someone walking by to get any idea of where it was ok to sit.   Turns out the room to the side had some seats available so we sat in there.  The tiny room on the side is designed nice, but it feels like you are in some rich persons shower.  The tile on the wall and no plants or pictures makes the room echo and you can hear everyone else's conversation.  Luckily after a bottle of wine you stop caring. The menu is simple enough and we received our food promptly, but my friend ordered a Triple Pork Burger and none of the stuff that was listed for it on the menu came on it.  But it had all the items that are listed on the So Cal Burger, so we pointed this out to the manager and he explained that we were wrong, everything in the triple pork burger is mixed in the meat.  The problem we had, is first, the menu should have said that, second, if there was going to be additional items on the burger like another burger, why didnt they mention that as well.  it was kind of an insult to our intelligence.  On top of that, my friend asked for her sauce on the side, which they did, but they also still put it on the burger, and getting them to remake the burger was a pain.   This was starting to become a hassle.   We were never bought water or silverware and ended up having to ask three different people to get it.  One of the people we asked was the manager, who told us that it was ok if we just used some of the silverware someone else had left behind.....Are you kidding me.  Really, are you f**cking kidding me???  This just upset me.  I am not using someones left over silverware, i thought this was America.  Then he tells me they don't use forks there....What?  When he was explaining to me why they don't use forks, the waiter brought me a knife and a FORK.  If i wasn't already halfway through a bottle of wine and with some good company that was making me laugh, I would have started to go off on this guy.  Screw the manager at this joint, he is either a moron, or doesn't care, either way, I am over it.  By the way, Iron your shirt buddy, if you are going to be the boss, look like it. Anyways, the only reason this place gets two stars is because the food was decent, not great, but good.  And the waiter was really nice after seeing all that and even brought my friend a free brownie to apologize.  He then explained we should try the spot again and check out their new back patio sometime......I was wondering why no one told us about this patio when we had walked in and asked for a seat....this place is weird. I think I am over trying to have a "fancy" burger in LA.

Really, I give them 3.5 stars. All the food here is really greasy, and by the time you finish your meal, you feel like you just drank a tub of grease. But a pretty fine tasting tub of grease, mind you. The pickles are really good. Onion rings are overrated. Burgers are good, but greasy, like I said. One time I ordered takeout and they forgot to put the pickles in my bag, so when I went back (hey, they're $4 pickles!), the manager threw in all kinds of free desserts for my trouble. Now that's good customer service.

Wow, they serve a pretty fierce burger. I ordered the urmami signature burger and was pleasantly surprised to find a shiitake mushroom next to the grilled tomato hiding under the top bun. i took one more bite, blacked out and woke up to find my hand empty, greasy. the fries, which are double fried to get that crispy crunchy skin, dipped in their own ketchup was also devoured. warning: even if you don't like pickles, i recommend interspersing bites of hamburger with pickles to prevent blackout. you need that sour kick to balance all that meaty goodness.

you should definitely try umami once in your life because it is giada's (from food network) favorite burger.  but the wait is kinda long and it is really expensive.  could get 3 cheeseburgers from in-n-out. i know that umami means savory in japanese but i would like to introduce a korean word that comes to mind, "nuk-gee-hae" which means greasy/heavy.

Mediocre burger. Absolutely horrible service. For some reason we were only handed one menu, my girlfriend had the menu for a minute or two, I had it for like ten seconds. When the waiter gets to us I asked "what's on an umami burger" and the guy  rolls his eyes. Excuse me! You've been open like a month and it doesn't even say what's on it on the menu asswipe. If you don't want that question list what's on the burger on the menu jerk. My burger was okay, my girlfriends undercooked, and the fries were horrible, and you get around six of them for  $3 dollars. I didn't know we were in the middle of another potato famine. While we were eating another couple comes in at around 3pm and the waiter tells them "we need a break we're closing for a couple hours". Oh my God, how do you expect to stay in business if you list your hours as 11am-10pm then just close for nappy poo time you little dweeb. With so many good burgers at places like 25 Degrees, 8 oz., Father's Office, or even the new place Golden State, for roughly the same price, I see no reason to ever go back here again.

It's so sad when poor service completely overwhelms really good food. As you can probably tell on here, either you love the food at Umami or you don't.  I'm in the former category, one of the folks who wonders if they put some crack in everything they serve. However, that 5th Taste comes at a price that has become too steep for me to bear any longer: terrible, terrible attitude.   When I first started coming here, there was a waitress who I loved and was lucky because I always seemed to get her.  Then, when she left, it was a rude awakening to the other experiences I've had since.  The best way I can describe this attitude is being snooty and aloof without any of the professionalism or efficiency that would warrant it. I just can't stand the "you're lucky you get to eat here" vibe I get from the moment I'm "greeted" by a host or hostess here. Today, however, was the final straw.  I came in by myself after getting off work early, prepared for a quiet lunch to ease into the long weekend.  The hostess took me back to the "counter" area.  Now, if you've never been to Umami, this counter is a joke.  It's narrow, it's uncomfortable, it winds around 3 sides of a cramped little room and I'm sorry, but if I'm going to drop $15-20 on a burger and a side, I don't want to be sitting with a wall 18 inches in front of my face. So, I asked if I could have a table instead.  Her first reaction was to look at me as if I were speaking in an alien language.  She then said, "oh, no, we don't have any tables."  I said I'd be willing to wait.  She then said, "no, it's going to be about 25 minutes."  Now, there was no one else waiting, and a few diners had finished their lunch (this was around 3:30, mind you).  Now it was my turn to look puzzled, which she apparently noticed because she quickly said, "well, maybe more like 10."  I said I could wait 10 minutes.  I live walking distance to The Counter, but instead decided to come out to Umami.  I was there, why not wait, right? So, after waiting 10 minutes outside, she came out to tell me she was sorry because they were still having their lunch rush, so she wouldn't be able to seat me at a table.  I just walked away.   Expensive good food, I suppose many think you can get away with mediocre service.  But when the attitude overwhelms the experience, it tips the scales in the opposite direction.  +5 for food, -4 for service.

"Umami "must be japanese for ripoff. I went here with my sister and her boyfriend ready for, not a great american burger, but just a burger that was made differently - since we like to try things that are different. And different it was. I'm the type of guy that LOVES burgers. All types of burgers, what's to hate? Bread? Awesome. Condiments? Fuck yeah. Meat? ZOMG. But the burgers here, made me feel as if I just paid someone 12$ to kick me in the nuts. I had the blue cheese burger, which was, well, could've been really good. I am in love with blue cheese. If blue cheese was a woman I'd marry her and father a million albino kids with disgusting blue varicose veins all over their bodies that were utterly delicious if you could get the courage to eat them. But the quality of the meat that they use here must be somewhere between not-fit-for-consumption and animal-feed. When my burger arrived it was sitting in a pool of grease. And I don't mean, you know, a few drops off grease off the side of the burger like I've seen at the more delicious places. I mean a fucking pool. If hawaii was a burger, the grease would've been the fucking pacific. And no, this was not the juices from the burger, it was grease. When the pool around my burger is so shiny that I can trim my nose hairs in it, yar, that's not juices, it's grease. And when I looked over at the other burgers, you guessed it, they came the same way. Now all this grease, this automatically sends an alarm through my brain. I work in the food industry testing the chemical properties of good meat, and the meat we sell to places like say, safeway. The amount of grease that the food had, ie. fat content, even safeway would've rejected. Yes fat is what makes meat tastes good, but when theres that much of it, think of the difference between, say, eating a slice of bacon cooked just the way you like and eating spoonfuls of bacon grease. Yar. Greasiness aside, the burger did come with a plus side. In this ever growing health conscious world, it came, gasp, rare. And I would've given this place a higher rating if I hadn't known that this was a complete accident caused by utter laziness and incompetence. Now going back to the taste of this atrocious abomination. Yes its greasy. And.. hey, wasn't there supposed to be blue cheese in this? WTF? Yar, I think that all the grease from my burger actually was able to coat my entire tongue and keep me from tasting the most tasty of cheeses. *cartman face* Hey, atleast it was easy to chew. I did try a bite of the manly burger and the truffle burger. The manly burger tasted... well, just like mine. Like grease. The truffle burger on the other hand actually tasted... good. Really good. But reflecting back on it, McDonalds could probably sprinkle some truffles on their double cheeseburgers and it'd taste the same. Truffles are some potent shit. Agreeing with everyone else. Don't get the fries. They're basically the bags of fries that you can buy at ralphs. They're good, but makes you feel like shit when the place only gives you one choice of condiment that comes in a soup spoon (you know, the kind you get with pho) and charges you for extra. Sodas were pretty cool, they had some local stuff. I don't remember the price but I think it was worth it. To match the horribly bad food, I guess the management thought it'd be funny to have equally horrible stafff. The bastards. Our waiter or whatever he was looked like a fatter version of chris farley with the personality of... macaulay culkin in party monster, except with down syndrome. It took every fiber in my body to not just take my soup spoon of ketchup and stab the living shit out of the fucker. Oh god, I'm getting PTSS from having to relive visiting this place so I'll just end the review now as abruptly as I can. Out of a score of OM NOM NOM NOM (caps count as a point XD) I give this place an o (as in "Oh crap, lets get the hell out of here). If hell were a burger joint, it'd be umami.

I was really excited to try this place out but...it's pretty much mediocre. I had the socal burger ordered it well done had a bite and I noticed it was bloody, they took it back and gave me a fresh burger, this time well done. I enjoyed it but for it's worth I think it is too pricey I would rather eat in-and out.  Hubby had the truffle burger and we also shared thin fries and onion rings and a coke, the bill came out to about $38 plus tip over $40...eh not worth going again but worth a try.

I really don't know where to begin as far as what is wrong with this burger joint. Is it poor management? Is it bad hiring? Is it everyone's first time working in the service industry? Does the kitchen manager know how to order product when he is running out? We've been there two times...the first time the service was so bad that we almost walked out but thought we should at the very least stick around to see what the food tasted like, so we did. After waiting around for a waiter that never came and eventually the "Manager" (he looked more confused than any other manager we've seen) came by to take our drink order and he specifically said "can I get your drinks for you?" and then we told him we were actually ready to order (we had fifteen minutes sitting at the table without drinks to think about it....we were kind of ready). He seemed annoyed that he was asked to take our order and reluctantly did so. We ordered the So Cal Burger and the Triple Pork Burger with french fries and onion rings. We sat in the room with the bar chairs which also acts as the managers office. This area is first come first serve but they will never tell you that.  At the end of the meal, I had to get up and go pay the bill. Our bellies were happy because the burgers were delicious and the onion rings were as well. The fries were undercooked but that was just one thing in addition to the terrible service. For us, this was not a dealbreaker and we thought they were just having an "off night."   Please pay attention to the next experience below to realize that this burger joint is missing the BIGGEST ingredient to success in the food industry next to customer service and that is consistency. Second trip, Mother's Day 2009. It was my Mom's first visit to LA and she loves a good burger. She requested it on Mother's Day so we thought...."they were just having an off night tonight will be much better." NOPE.

I'm sure the food is good, but the management is horrible.  Our unfortunate experience began Sunday, April 26th at 2pm.  We sat outside and ordered within 5 minutes.  The place was packed but not fully booked.  All seemed to be going smoothly.  After about 25 minutes, we were still waiting for our salad and fries.  We asked the waiter to please check on our food to which he responded that it was coming.  10 minutes later we asked again and he responded that he put the order in and doesn't understand where the food is.  10 minutes after that another waiter came out to apologize for the now 45 minute wait and said our food was coming out momentarily.  Obviously we were very patient.  Then things started getting worse. 10 minutes later the original waiter brought me out a coke and said this and desert were on the house.  Even though we asked what was happening, our answer was still "food is coming".  By now that response wasn't good enough.  We asked what was going on and that an hour wait is not typical at all.  He said "it's coming".  5 minutes after that, our waiter returned to our table, showed us the ticket order and said although he put the order in at 2:09 pm the owner said that the kitchen closed at 3:00pm and that we were therefore not going to get our food.  I don't know what fight our waiter was having with Adam Fleischman , the owner,  but we clearly didn't understand why we were in the middle.  After waiting patiently for over an hour and ten minutes on a very unpleasant and noisy La Brea Boulevard, we were "not getting our food"?   We went inside to speak to Adam who asked us what the problem was.  We asked him "so after an hour and ten minutes waiting, we're being told we're not getting our food?"  He asked to see our ticket, looked at it and said "we're out of fries, but can give you chips instead".  Clueless!   We turned and left. Whatever happened to "I'm so sorry for the wait.  We had a mix up in the kitchen.  The meal is on us."  As I said, I'm sure the food is good, but give me a break.

was going to come for vdai and they were supposed to close at 10 but they closed at 9:30 ...my boo & i got locked in their parking lot and had to call the cops to get us out...so we went bak the next morning to pik up his kar and ate lunch there...good amount of ppl went for opening hours i'd say im a fan tho not of their burgers...their onion rings w/roasted GARLIC aioli is just so damn good! Tempura Onion Rings $3: mmm...nicely seasoned & perfectly crunchy!   Umami Burger $10: i honestly don't see what the big fuss is about Port & Stilton Burger $9: not a fan of blue cheese but if i were i'm sure i'd like it the portion sizes of the burgers are pretty small for that price...they're not much bigger than a mcD Big Mac but it's still a mouthful... service: great! and they informed us that they just got the beef in and it's organic free range atmosphere: omg it's so kute...they have sketches on the wall and the inside is clean & gives an eco friendly vibe...very small place tho...a lot of the tables are sittin right next to each other parking: private lot

Whoa this burger was kick ass! The juice of my medium rare Umami burger just burst into my mouth. The tempura onion rings are some of the best I have ever eaten. It's not the biggest burger you'll see but it's definitely an amazing burger. Great job! Service was also on point with the place being busy.

so we got to try the Umami Burger, Hatch Burger, and Truffle Burger.  we also ordered regular fries and sweet potato fries. the Umami Burger was ok i guess but too sweet for my tastes.  i think the sweetness from the oven-dried tomatoes and Umami ketchup overwhelmed the whole burger. the Hatch Burger was awesome.  great flavor, with a slight kick from one of the four chiles featured inside.  i would totally have this one again. the Truffle Burger was pretty good too, but to be honest, i don't have a whole lot of experience with truffles because, well, i'm poor.  so i really don't have much of a reason to go and say "wow that's some great truffle flavor in that there burger!" because i really don't know what it's supposed to taste like and i couldn't pick apart the truffle flavor from the cheese and the rest of the burger -_-  anyway, this one was pretty good too. pass on the rectangular potato logs they try to present to you as french fries.  they were ok but they really didn't taste like french fries.  i'm partial to golden, crispy, crinkle cut fries :) hurrah for their delicious sweet potato fries that have a light dusting of brown sugar (and cinnamon?) service inside the joint was quick and snappy!  we were seated immediately, as in literally as i got out of my car. parking is fairly easy with the built-in valet they have for $2.50 which is kind of a bargain around these parts, but boo to the valet dude who looked at us as if he was cheated for not giving him a tip for driving my car 15 feet.  if you're gonna give me attitude for that i'll get my own damn car next time. the verdict: the burgers were pretty good, but kinda pricey and not really the type of burger i would have all the time.  a little....too juicy?  as in, so-juicy-the-part-of-the-bun-touching-the-plate-­is-soggy.  and so the burger journey continues....

A little more high-brow than your typical burger for sure. Fyi, Umami has multiple locations, each with their own variation of the menu. I ordered the Truffle burger with a side of sweet tater fries. The burger itself was really juicy and perfectly pink. The truffle flavor gave it that extra touch. The fries were dusted with a little bit of sugar and cinnamon which made different but good. Admittedly the food here will ring you up more than what you are used to, especially considering the portion, but I would definitely come back here.

Mmmmmm, burger. Went to Umami for the first time a couple of weeks ago.  The last few months, I'd heard a lot of things about this place, both positive and negative.  So, what better way to get the true low down on a joint than to experience Umami for myself. It was a Monday night around 8 or 9pm and I had just picked up some friends from LAX, so there were three of us.  For a weekday night, especially a Monday night, the place was pretty full.  Not sure if that says more about Umami's popularity or that the restaurant itself is rather tiny.  As a result of  the busyness, we were sat in the back of the restaurant in this one room off to the side.  While there was a table in this room, it was already taken, so we were sat at a counter that circles three of the 4 walls in this room.  In retrospect, not the best idea for a party of three.  Considering there was a wall in front of us, the eating experience while sitting at this counter leaves much to be desired.  It's the first time I had seen a seating setup like this, but if you're the owner of a restaurant that has space issues, I guess it can be expected.  Also, I don't think it wouldn't be a problem if you were eating by yourself....eh...on second thought, forget it.  Stay away from the counter.  Sucks eggs. If I remember correctly, all three of us got the Umami Burger.  At 9 bucks a pop, it seems comparable to burgers I've had at The Counter and Golden State...at least price wise.  We also ordered a couple of orders of both fries and onion rings...they were out of the Couscous salad!!!!  The food got to us in a timely manner and it wasn't a minute to soon, as we were all famished. The burger was damn good.  Cooked perfectly with the right amount of seasoning, a perfect sized bun and savory flavor to boot.  While other yelpers have complained about the size of the burger for the money, I thought it was a perfect portion.  I think living in the United States skews people's opinions on what the correct portion size should be.  Considering we live in one of the fatter nations in the world, I'm guessing we're more wrong than we're right.  Everyone IS entitled to their opinion though. The side orders of hand cut fries and tempura onion rings were equally as tasteful.  I'm not usually a big fan of onion rings, but these were out of this world.  Although they were battered in malt liquor, they still remained very light.  The temperature and texture of the rings complimented each other perfectly.  There weren't any left, once the meal was over.  That's always a good sign. Service was friendly, helpful and attentive.  Just the way it should be. Umami Burger easily falls into positive territory with me.  Other than the unconventional seating arrangement we had, I'd be hard pressed to find something else to complain about.

yummmami oh my... tastebuds = happy! filled to the brim on a thursday night, a group of us resorted to seating outside in the patio in  the cold.  with the heat lamps, it wasn't so bad, though my hair was charred to a crisp after but an hour. great cozy nook for conversation though. the burgers were medium sized. think about your avg in-and-out burger and shave an inch off everywhere and there you have your size. as for the taste..oh lala delicious!!  the umami burger had this crispy cheese inside, and the portobello mushrooms were a pleasant surprise.  the patty was so JUICY, and tasty. the sweet potato fries were another plus..with their special ketchup (zingy!), i thought father's office, you've got your competition here. (no ketchup at FO) the truffle burger was apparently delish. my friend thought it was better than the umami burger b/c of its simplicity in taste. i have to try that one next time! the black cherry soda arrived in a bottle, and was also outstanding, and old school cool. our waiter was a riot! chatty but in a good way, comical, and all the while a really good server. watch out hollywood. all in all, the group of us had a blast, while enjoying what we thought was a top-notch burger and well worth the price of about $10.  will venture out again, and try the other burgers!

Only negative things I have to say: If you are self conscious like me, don't sit near the window in the front. Its like being in a fucking fishbowl with douchebags that are waiting for a table tapping on the glass.  It was also cold the night we went and the cold draft is relentless. . Speaking of draft, there's NO alcohol so if that's a must along with your meal, apparently they have a lovely BYOB option. Ok fine, a big negative point that seems impossible not to talk about is the wait. We literally waited 30 minutes for food. I kept track.  Not a wait to get a table, after you order, waiting for the food to arrive.  If you're starving before you get here, you will continue to starve until your breaking point. 2 guys near my table straight up left, unpaid sodas still left on table, because they couldnt take it anymore. Other than those light infractions (well I consider them light) they make excellent food and, of course, one delicious burger. I got the italian truffle burger. No actual truffles unfortunately, truffle cheese. It gave it that light fungus tinge that added itself and boosted  the meat. Yes, it was "cooked to perfection", bloody, lightly dressed, none of that standard onion, tomato, lettuce nonsense...its all about the meat. I like how they dont ask "how do you want that cooked?" It means they know what they're doing and arent gonna compromise their burger-making principles for your ass. One of my companions had an Umami burger. Like my burger, it was all about that perfectly cooked prime beef. Even though it had more accompaniments, I still preferred mine. His was dripping much more than mine as well. The other person had their "special of the night" turkey burger with goat cheese. I wanted it, but she got it first. They had me at confit.  Yes, they apparently confit the patty in duck fat. Fuck yes. She traded me a quarter of her burger for a quarter of mine and even though the initial bites of her burger were mind-altering good, the more I bit, the more I craved my burger more. Although the turkey patty was confit it was still a bit on the drier side. I just wanted my juicy, juicy beef back after eating half of my quarter...   I agree that it is very "Hollywood" in the sense that the portions are on the smaller side (compared to the other gut-busting,"gourmet" burger joints Ive been) But I did walk away quite full.   We didnt get any fries (i know, a sin, right?) Instead, after reading reviews we opted for the tempura onion rings and the sweet potato salad. The rings were good, just well cooked  tempura onions. Nothing more, nothing less. Well, again, couldve given us a bigger portion but its all about quality, not quantity here. The sweet potato salad...dont think "potato salad", just think "salad". Its tender, cubed sweet potato with peas in a miso dressing. Its NOT a thick, gloopy potato salad. Its a salad. Well, I need to lose weight anyway, right? As for beverages, as a bottled soda whore, Im unfortnately not peeing-in-my-pants impressed. The mexican coke is just bottled coke made with cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup. Its good but this isnt a huge selling point for me.  They also have bubble up (basically sprite with real cane sugar) and root beer that tastes homemade but a bit more peppery than I'd like. For dessert is was their mint chip ice cream sandwiches. I was impressed to see those brightly colored macaroon cookie things instead of normal cookies. It was a whole sandwich cut into 4s and served on a long rectangular plate. Half were chocolate dipped, half were not. Although gourmet and delicious I couldnt shake that pesky,"wait, I could do this at home" feeling which took away from feeling impressed. Service was actually pretty good. The waiter did seem a bit insincere but he treated us with respect and was attentive and apologized incessantly for the wait (after the other table near us left). So to me, i was left with an overall good feeling. Prices...if you're pinching your pennies and value quantity over quality for your buck, I wouldnt highly recommend coming here. I personally found the prices to be very fair. We got 3 burgers, 2 sides, 3 sodas and 1 dessert for $50.  We werent completely stuffed but were satisfyingly full. Yes, this review is long. So heres the conclusion: If you want a very well thought-out and well crafted burger and arent all about portions come to Umami Burger. Just bring alcohol, some change for valet and PATIENCE! and you'll have a great time.

Umami is very close to my place and seeing it on the Angeleno recently, I said why not. How naive of me. Wait for a table for 2 would be more than 30 mins said the hostess so I thought I'd rather take it to go. Went in, ordered and I was told to wait outside and I would be called once the order is ready. Meanwhile, I saw there are sooo many tables and seats available, both inside and also on the patio. Whatever. We started waiting. About 30+ minutes later, I went in to use the bathroom and noticed many brown paper bags on the register counter. 5 minutes later, I realized those were the to go orders, mine among them waiting for who knows how long. I picked it up in a fury (I dont want a cold burger!) went home. None of the condiments I asked for were there. There was just ketchup eventhough I didnt ask! Now the burgers: I ordered a medium well port and stilton which came out slightly bloody but I didnt mind it because the burger was delicious regardless. My boyfriend's well done socal came medium, he tried to eat without looking at it :) Onion rings were super greasy and the smushed potatoes werent anything special, I didnt eat more than 3 pieces. 30 dollars for 2 take-out burgers with the sh...iest service? No thanks, not again!

This is a small burger place so when you get here you can expect a 20 to 30 min wait. Parking is valet. As for the burgers, the umami burger and truffle burgers are great. I also enjoy the onion rings, they're very crisp. As for pricing the burgers are reasonably priced compared to other gourmet like burger joints. I would recommend this place to burger fans that want to try a different taste "umami".

it's ok. small place with a larger outdoor patio. had the unami burger, which was better than the port and stilton burger. burgers are fairly small. the regular fries are not that great. the sweet potato fries were pretty good, but i didn't like how they had cinnamon/brown suger(?) sprinkled on them. the different sauces/ketchups are ok. the ketchup does not taste like your regular ketchup. might be an acquired taste. they had these cheese infused tater tots that were ok as well. i dunno, i wouldn't go out of my way to come back. the parking is valet and tight squeezed/inconvenient. staff was friendly.

I'm so full.  Got here around 6 and there were only 2 others in the place.  Ordered the Umami burger, fries, carrot and pea salad, onion rings, and desert.  I had a really purple grape drink in a bottle.  Enjoy food much?  The burger was great, the fries were good, the carrot and pea salad was meh, the onion rings were yummy and desert was like a grown up ding dong.  This place is worth a shot, I would come back and bring someone who will appreciate it.  The service was friendly and non-pretentious.  The 2 dollar valet parking guy is cute and flirty.  What a nice Thursday dinner!

note to self and fellow yelpers: do not arrive to umami burger starving.  arrive just slightly hungry as service is patchy and painfully slow. my friend and i arrived with high expectations and ready to chow down on good burgers.  we waited about ten minutes to be seated and ordered quickly.  as i don't eat four-legged animals, i requested the miso turkey burger. the group next to us were seated just a little before we were, but their meal was served, devoured and paid for before we even saw ours. when our food finally arrived, i was relieved it was worth the wait.  the miso sauce is a genius way to keep the turkey patty properly moist and deliciously marinated.  the burgers are on the more conservative side and i had no problems polishing mine off along with half an order of tempura onion rings (big yum) and french fries (meah) without having to uncinch a belt loop. parking situation: valet for a bargain $2 or street parking on la brea.

Wow, usually I don't like to eat burgers, but this place was so appealing and so close to my apt, I gave it a try.  So glad I did!  I tried the lamb burger once and another time I had the chili burger.  The lamb one was soooooooooooo goood.   I think I would think of it every now and then. *slurp*  The chili one was good but not as good as the lamb.  Service was great too!  I asked for it to be spicy and they gave me this hot sauce they  had.  OMG one of the best hot sauce ever!!!  Can't wait to go again.  I don't what it is, but so damn flavorful, must be UMAMI =)

So my cousin has been talking about this place for quite sometime now and today we were near the area so we finally gave it a try. The first thing i really didnt like was that the only parking was valet an it cost $2.50 to park so we just parked somewhere across the street. When we first walked it i was kind of shocked that the place was sooo small.  I assumed there was a back room where more people are seated but there wasn't.  The room literally held about 20-25 people only.  Also there was no room to wait indoors for our table so we were forced to wait outside in the cold.  It was ok though cause we only waited like 10 minutes.   Now on to the food.  Since there burgers are expensive my cousin and I decided to get to different burgers and we each get half of each.  i ordered the Umami Burger ($9) and it was good.  The meat was such high quality and all the condiments on it tasted fresh.  Im not too sure what was in it but the mushroom definitely tasted great.  My cousin ordered the Manly Burger ($10) and that hamburger definitely hit the spot.  The burger contained beer-cheddar cheese, smoked salt onion, string, and bacon lardons.  It also tasted as if it had a hint of either horse raddish or wasabi.  The one thing about the burgers that we didnt like was that we were only able to order them medium-rare or well done...they didnt let us order medium or medium-well.  We also ordered 2 orders of french fries (one thick and one thin fries) and for some reason it didnt taste like any other french fries ive eaten before.  They actually tasted rich and healthy.   We also got an order of onion rings ($3) which only came with 6 rings and it tasted whatever.  Since they messed up on our order they gave us free ice cream sandwiches which was with vanilla ice cream and gingerbread ice cream which tasted very good.  But it normally cost $4.50 which i dont think is worth it. Before coming here i already knew the burgers would be small and very expensive so we werent expecting to get full.  We came here just for the experience.  I think everyone should experience these burgers...but dont expect to get full tho! These burgers are seriously the size of sliders except the hamburger meat is very thick and very delicious!

I love this place!!! I'm not one to "waste calories" on bar type food unless it's really good and I always pig out at Umami Burger. My favorites are the socal, hatch, and manly burgers. I do think their signature burger is a bit overrated compared to those others. I love the onion rings (great batter) and the fries are good too. I do think it's a little pricey. I do wish the burgers were a little easier to eat (the are kind of messy) and it is a little pricey (but it's LA, so it's not outlandish). I also love how they sell the ice cream sandwiches from milk and they have a great bottled ginger they sell too.

Had their umami burger, iced green tea, and sweet potato fries. The flavor of the burger was quite good. Fresh ingredients and great flavors.. but where's the rest of the burger?! HAHA.. it was an appetizer/teaser portion. If I was REALLY hungry, I could have polished off two (mind you, I came for lunch). Props for having sweet potato fries with a sprinkling of brown sugar, nice touch. No beer, $2.50 valet for parking, crowded interiors, and small portions is just a 3 star, A-OK review for me. I'd come back if I'm in the area but not if I'm super hungry.

Small portions but big flavors. But, I am a big eater usually. One burger is just not enough! I got the truffle burger and the flavor and the meat are just amazing--and it leaves you wanting more. The tempura onion rings are crisp and the fries are even better with the jalapeno ranch. Customer service can be improved. In my opinion, take your time eating and savor the flavor.

If I had to sum it all up In a word: too much.  Okay, that's two words, but that's my point!  Everything was just too much. I had the umami burger, sweet potato fries, and a root beer. The bun, while good, was a bit dense. The meat was juicy and yummy.  However, after eating half of it, the "umami" flavor just got to be a bit overwhelming.  I felt like I needed to clear my tongue from a heavy feeling.  I think the burger could have been better served with some greenery or a bigger tomato. The ketchup was packed with truffle flavor.  Again, the first few tastes was good, but it does not match well with sweet potato fries.  Near the end, I just avoided the ketchup. I agree with others that the burger was small, but the flavor made up for it.  Or should I say over-makes up for it. Overall, it was a decent meal, but I'd rather go elsewhere for a burger if given a choice.

It's always a joy to hit up Umami Burger.  Their truffle burger is by far the best burger I've ever had.  Hands down.  Throw cheesy tots and great dipping sauces - like jalapeno ranch and garlic aioli - into the mix, and I've got myself the very definition of satisfied taste buds.  I also tried a new burger, the kawaii burger, that was so delicious that it tip toed a few spots next to the truffle burger as my favorite.  Bra-freakin'-vo Umami, you done did it again!

A so so burger served up in an American Psycho  "we're so trendy we could care less" restaurant mentality.   Charge extra for "special sauce!?!?"  The stuff was ketchup. Try Kalbi Burger if you want a great burger... just don't ask for it medium rare because their medium/medium well is pretty rare.

In a nutshell: Good experience. Ask for your burger cooked through, otherwise it'll be served bloody. The onion rings are too greasy. I liked the garlic aioli. (I docked a star because they were out of the Port and Stilton AND out of the mint chocolate chip ice cream sandwiches I went there to try.) Parking: 2.50 valet or look for limited parking on the street Experience: I was ready to try the Port and Stilton only to be disappointed to find out that they were sold out for the night, so I went for the Umami burger. They have exotic bottled soda like dark root beer and chai cola. Everyone in the place seemed to be drinking Bubble Up so I ordered that which tasted just like 7-up.  Each entree comes with your choice of dipping sauce and I chose Umami ketchup. I wish the server told me that the fries and onion rings each come with Umami ketchup because I would've been more adventurous in choosing a sauce instead of getting stuck with 3 cups of Umami ketchup. Skip the onion rings, the breading was crunchy but very greasy. The fries were overshadowed by the Umami ketchup but complimented the burger nicely. My date ordered the Manly burger which he didn't specify to cook through. It was hard to ignore the bloodiness of the patty because it drenched the bun. Overall, the burger was tasty and I enjoyed the onion straws that were in the burger far more than the onion rings. Other than that, it was an ordinary burger. The Umami burger was a different story, in fact it was different. I enjoyed it more not just because I asked for the meat to be cooked through but also because the Umami ketchup in the burger completely transformed the burger into a something unique. It was hard to put my finger on it, so I finally asked the server what Umami was. He explained that it was the fifth sense of taste (there's tradionally four: sweet, salty, sour, and bitter). Umami leans toward the savory. Understanding that gave me a new appreciation of the burger and trying to understand the flavors. I doubt that this will be a place I would crave for, but definitely worth trying.

From what I had always heard of Umami, I expected it to be a high priced, stuck up, over-rated burger place. I was HIGHLY mistaken. I came to Umami with a friend of mine. I ordered the Umami Burger (you gotta try the signature burger first, right?) and my friend had the Truffle Burger. Mine was amazing, my friend's on the other hand was beyond brilliant! Quite possibly the best burger I've ever tasted. I can't get this burger out of my head. It was full of flavor. The meat was cooked perfectly. My only complaint is that I'm not eating it right now at this moment. We also had their cheese-filled tater tots, which were huge and amazing, and a mint chocolate chip ice cream sandwich for dessert. Everything was amazing. Wonderful. Brilliant! The staff was friendly. The decor was chill. I can't think of a single thing that I don't like about this place. I will be back and I want to try every burger they have.

More like 3.5 stars, but I'll be generous. Had lunch here the other day, and the wait was pretty bad, but the food was worth it. I had the pastrami burger, the special that day, and it was fantastic.  I was expecting a burger with sliced pastrami, what I got was a burger with huge chunks of hot pastrami on top.  Different, but extremely delicious.  The pastrami was a little fatty, but that just added to the flavor.  If you go, and this is an option, definitely get it. Now on to the bad, and there's a bit.  The wait can be extremely long, and they don't do reservations.  The waitstaff and general demeanor of the place is pretentious.  Our waitress forgot multiple items, and we had to remind her several times for that as well as napkins and utensils.  On the neutral side, their thin fries taste exactly like McDonald's; I love McD's fries, but for a place like this, they should be getting a little more creative.   Overall, this place is worth a shot because some of their burgers really are that good.  Just don't expect good service.  Doesn't seem like they can be bothered.

Honestly, I think if you come in here not expecting some crazy exotic burger and something life changing, you'll really enjoy their burgers. I got their signature Umami Burger (juicy house ground beef, oven roasted tomatoes, caramelized onions, parmesan frico, sauteed shiitake mushroooms, and house made ketchup) and it was really good in my opinion. The portion looks pretty small but I left feeling satisfied and I never got bored or sick of my burger, which usually tends to happen at other places. The malt liquor tempura onion rings were also good, and I liked the sauce it's served with that tastes like a marinara-ketchup combo. It looks like they're donating $1 to the Japan Earthquake & Tsunami Relief Fund today (3/29/2011) for every burger sold, so today would be a good time to try it out and do a little good while you're at it.

I was SO very excited to visit Umami after hearing so many great things. I don't eat beef or pork so I checked out their menu online and contacted the restaurant to make sure they offered a turkey burger. They did! We arrived on a rainy LA day (one of only a few!) and waited for about 30 minutes outside with all the others who were on the waiting list. Our name was called and we got a great seat right next to the windows. Our waiter aproached and asked what we'd like. I asked for the umami burger with a turkey patty. The waiter very rudely said "Not allowed. No substitutions." I stared at him and thought "People skills, much?" I then ordered the burger with the turkey patty on the menu and asked for no sauce, mayo, etc on the burger. My friend ordered the standard Umami burger. And we ordered a side of fries. When the food arrived my burger was covered in a garlic alioli sauce. I asked the waiter to please remake it with no sauce as I had suggested. In his usual way, he was rude and mumbled under his breath as he walked away. I couldn't believe it. My friend's opinion of his burger "eh, Golden State is better." So, after my bland burger and rude waiter, I've decided that Umami serves up a big serving of douche baggery and with a side of "eh" food.

What a paradox.  Good, affordable, innovative food, with an inept wait staff who seem flustered and confused by the most mundane requests.  I've been here twice, and I don't write bad reviews, typically.  But, I have to take a stand on Umami Burger: good food or not, my brain's appeasement means more to me than my taste buds singing.  Besides, The Park and Father's Office both offer a great burger--without the blank stares, forgotten sides, wrong change and complete inflexibility--plus, Father's Office has beer--which I officially needed after attempting to eat at Umami Burger.   In the midst of a totally empty restaurant, (obviously they were anticipating higher paying guests), we were seated in a back room with one, two person table for three people.  The table was wobbly to an almost cartoon-ish degree, and when we asked for a different table a waitress (with a completely straight face) told us "I have nowhere else to put you." We sat for a moment, assessing the burger, which we know to be fantastic, but also took in the too-small table with its gimpy leg and the surplus of vacant tables, and decided to try again: "Can we sit outside?"   They weren't opening outside just yet.  Never once did our waitress say she was sorry, nor did she explain WHY she didn't feel compelled to allow us our outside table or at least a table conducive to the number in our party.  We finally left.  Our entire interaction with her felt a little like trying to keep eye contact with a cat.  Communication just...wasn't in her nature. And this wasn't the first time--incorrect change, the wrong entrees, forgotten side dishes, inattentive service--they've all been long-running jokes between us and our friends as common place at Umami Burger.  I've turned a blind eye, but our last run-in was over the top:  I don't go to hamburger joints to be semi-refused of service and I certainly can't condone paying to be treated poorly.  Good food can only carry you so long.  Please charge a little extra for a burger and hire a non-alien wait staff.  I'm a reasonable person.  I don't always expect prime seating, but I do expect communication and being able to maintain a level blood pressure...at least until after I eat the burger.  Gees.

Yummy but expensive ($9-11/burger). Excellent customer service. Valet is 2.50. While I was there, the valet guy crashed someone's car, so I would be careful. The place is quite small, we felt like packed sardines. I would go back again only if I was in the area and had some money to spend.

A perfect place for people who believe being treated terribly by the staff and chef makes them feel somehow important. "If they treat me with this much contempt, they must know what they're doing, " they think. They don't. A burger advertised on the menu as coming with mushrooms came with a single mushroom the size of a quarter. I'm not kidding. I asked for a slice of tomato for my burger...the waitress informed me with a sneer that the chef does not make changes. These are 'gourmet burgers,' she said, 'we don't make custom burgers.' A slice of tomato was way too much to ask. The fries were cold, the burgers are small and expensive (order two of you don't want to go hungry), the clientele, I gather, must be exceptionally inexperienced to overpay for being treated so shabbily, and did I mention I really hate this place? The meat is of good quality...so I gave it one star. If only the service, clientele and the rest of the meal weren't so awful, I'd go there again if the meal were free and I was starving and had really low self-esteem. When people from out of town say they hate L.A., it's because of restaurants like this.

Triple Pork! 3 types of pork, I had to try it...nom nom nom!!! The chorizo keeps the meat juicy with plenty of drippings to drop on the smushed potatoes. We all ordered different ones, so I was able to try both the veggie and truffle burgers. The were both good, but I definitely recommend the truffle. It's a little pricey, so be prepared! Parking is not good at this location, but they do have affordable valet.

I think Umami is going to be a big hit.  Nice low key space, with good food and reasonable prices in an area that doesn't have a lot of good burgers around.  Went here last Friday with my lady to have some burgers.  We read about the service kinks they were trying to iron out and this seems to still be a little issue.  The BYOB makes eating here very attractive.  We had the california and the umami burger - both very juicy and well cooked.  The bun was like a nice toasty brioche.  Toasted well and very soft.  It was a good compliment.  The fries are different - they serve about 9 of them stacked up like Lincoln logs.  They were fat and big like french toast sticks from BK.  I liked them.  $8 for a burger and $2 for fries.  There were some other yummies that we didn't try but certainly will in the future.  Parking lot if awful but after 7pm La Brea is wide open.

Can you say DELICIOUS? Now for those of you who are unaware, "umami" is your fifth taste bud on your tongue and it picks up on the protein/meat tastes of your foods. Now upon hearing this, you may still be clueless as to what umami tastes like, and if you are one of these people then Umami Burger is DEFINITELY the place to go. A friend of mine took me here claiming this joint to be the best burger joint ever, and it did not disappoint.  The first time I came here, I ordered their signature Umami Burger ($9)--- TO DIE FOR!  The meat is perfectly seasoned, marinated, and served medium rare the way I like it! (Fair warning, ALL of their burgers are served this way. So if you're not a fan of your burgers being served pink on the inside, then ask the waiter to have the chef cook your patty meat longer). The buns are toasty. Mushrooms savory. Cheese crispy (I know, sounds odd, but it works well with the burger). All in all, my tastebuds were thanking me for introducing such a godly taste to my mouth.  My friend had the Seamami Burger (I think $13), which has fresh, real crab meat in the patty.  Watch out for this burger people because 1) it is DAMN delicious 2) it is seasonal only.   Me and my friend split the triple hand-cooked fries ($3).  Beware! While these thick steak-cut fries are pretty damn amazing (extra crispy exterior, soft interior), especially with the delicious tangy sauce they provide for dipping... you only get something like 6 fries! OUCH! My second visit here, I wanted to try something different so I went for the Port & Stilton Burger ($9).  While the bun and burger still did not disappoint me (your welcome tastebuds), I was disappointed that they overdid the blue cheese since it massively overpowered the rest of the burger.  My friend ordered the Hatch Burger ($9) which he said was good but not as good as the Umami Burger.  For those chili lovers though, I did observe they don't skimp on the chilies since his burger was packed with chilies to the point where he had a difficult time keeping them in his burger.  We split the malt liquor tempura onion rings ($2.50) served with the same delicious tangy dipping sauce that they give you for their fries.  Again, BEWARE!... it only comes with 6 rings.  While these onion rings were perfectly battered (not mushy and not overly crispy), I felt that the malt liquor taste was a little much (as in, I couldn't even cover the taste with the dipping sauce). The service is friendly. The restaurant is clean, has cute decor, and is well-lit.  So far, no problem finding seats.  They serve alcoholic (wines and such), non-alcoholic drinks (like Mexican Coke!), or you can BYOB.  One downside is that their parking lot is valet only (small fee of $2) if you cannot find street parking.   Umami Burger can expect me back for sure!

I use to love Umami.. Truffle burger was my favorite.. Last time I went, it was very meh.. not a lot of the wine reduction and the truffled cheese was not truffled enough as it once was.. I guess that is what happens when you grow a lot...  I would still go back and give it a second chance.  The fries are good,  I like their house made ketchup and the price is right..

Waaay over-priced, not to mention stingy with their condiments. Charging extra for KETCHUP? Are you kidding me? It was good ketchup, but seriously...don't charge me for ketchup. I ordered the lamb burger, which was great, but I wouldn't go back for it because of the price, the wait, and the presentation - my burger looked so lonely on the plate.... :( They didn't even dress it up with some lettuce or whatever.

I read about this place first on a food article from Yahoo. It was dubbed the best burger in America. When I found out I was going to Los Angeles for training, I knew I HAD to try this burger joint. Umami tries to class up their restaurant but let's be honest: burgers are burgers. That being said, Umami definitely lives up to it's name. I went with my girlfriend, her sister and her mom. I enjoyed the truffle burger while my gf enjoyed the Umami burger. The truffle burger was definitely my favorite out of the two. It was simple and elegant and there wasn't any other ingredients besides the truffle oil and cheese to get in the way of the flavor of the burger. I've never had truffles really but the flavor was phenomenal. Never mind that the burger was smaller than your average, it more than makes up for it with flavor. If you're looking to get full, I would recommend getting a little extra such as the sweet potato fries, which had a little too much brown sugar for my liking, but still delicious. The Umami burger was good too, just that the other ingredients overwhelmed the flavor of the meat. Even the bun had a special sweet kick to it and I definitely loved the whole package. Definitely worth it. Tips: try to find parking on the street to avoid the valet parking fee. Get there by 6:30 to avoid the line that starts to show up around 7:15. Get crayons and draw your heart out on the paper tablecloth, hell even bring your own paint and colored pencils if you want.

Great burgers. Went on a Sat night. The place is small but the wait for two wasn't too bad. Service was a little slow because they were so busy. Unfortunately, they were out of several items on the menu but it was our first time so we didn't mind trying other things. I would say their burger size isn't huge but that's okay. Really liked their signature Umami burger but the pork stilton was so-so...I guess it would be great if I liked stilton.... The meat was pretty rare...I don't know why they didn't ask how I wanted my meat cooked. Fries were good, onion rings can probably be skipped and market salad was just a salad. They have some interesting drinks but the waiter seemed rushed since it was busy so we just got lemonade....I don't think they have beer but beer would have been great with the burgers. Our bill was under forty for two...don't know if you consider that expensive or not....

I have been wanting to try this place for forever!!  So my friend and I had both gotten new jobs and wanted to celebrate. We decided to go here since I hadn't been and he loves this place.  We came here on a Thursday night at 7, and surprisingly it wasn't that busy yet.  My friends got there first, I was running late.  There were 3 of them but they wouldn't seat them until I arrived. The place is kinda small but had outdoor seating as well. So we get seated inside and order our food.  I wanted to maximize my experience, so me and my friend went halfsies on two burgers - his favorite - the truffle burger and the signature Umami burger, because you have to get the umami burger at Umami rite?  My other friend got the manly burger and his gf whois vegetarian got the earth burger. Options for everyone!  We also ordered sweet potato fries, onion rings and the smushed potatoes.  Came with various dipping sauces - umami ketchup which was just ehh, jalapeno ranch (yum) and garlic aioli (double yum!) Our burgers actually came out fast and before our fries, but the fries and rings came shortly after.  We cut our burgers in half and I made the mistake of trying the truffle burger first because it was so mouth watering deliciousness that it ruined the Umami burger for me, which tasted just okay.  The truffle burger was juicy, cheesy and had just the right amount of truffle, was not too rich or overwhelming. Now, I'm sure the Umami burger is good, but compared to the truffle it was a little bland and boring.  It had shitake mushrooms and a parmesan crisp and was topped with the Umami Ketchup, which could have added to the ehh factor.    I ate that half first so I could savor the truffle.  My friend, who had warned me that the portions were small - in between a slider an an inn and out burger, wanted to split another truffle.  At the time I thought it was a good idea, but my eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach.  The burger for me personally was a good size with the fries and onion rings. It is a bit small for the cost.   Half way through our dinner it started getting really crowded, so we are glad to have come when we did! The second truffle burger came and my friend who got the manly burger offered to eat half of my half. Haha.  So we got that and we were all stuffed.  Then we saw the desserts - beautifully crafted ice cream sandwiches.  My veggie friend who just had one burger wanted dessert so I offered to share some with her.  We ordered the cookies and cream ice cream and it was good, but looked better than it tasted. So overall, pretty damn good truffle burger, decent Umami burger and great sides and dipping sauces.  Small portions for the price but you also get the nice ambiance and friendly service.  I can go either way on the dessert, and having had Diddy Riese, any other ice cream cookie sandwich fails to compare.

Ok i have to admit the burgers are are pretty good.  They reminded me of krispy kreme donuts because the bread was so light and fluffy and the meat was so tender.  Even though they were dripping with oil i didn't feel gross afterwards.  But thats because these burgers are small! They cost around $9-$10 and the small sides are a few more bucks.  For this price, i would rather go to fathers office where the burger is much more satisfying.

Ok, they certainly seem to do burgers right, but overall I was not overly impressed. My Hatch Burger was indeed awesome - exactly the right feel of flame and fat and beef, coated in quintuple smooth jack cheese that melted the way cheese melts in advertisements, but never in real life (until now); the chile relish added some extra interest. My companion opted for the triple pork burger (ground pork, chorizo and bacon) - I had a taste and it was like a gourmet sausage patty, but I didn't think it really made for a good burger.  Neither of us cared much for the sides. The tempura onion rings sounds like a great idea, but in execution they were soggy/heavy/greasy. The triple fried parallelopiped fries were geometrically perfect, but undistinguished. The umami ketchup really didn't do it for me. Sure, kê-chiap may have had its origins as fish sauce, but for me, the less anchovy and oyster sauce in my ketchup the better. Seating is very limited and this location of Umami burger does not serve alcohol (but does have Mexican Coke).  Service was friendly, but really slow; I think when they made my burger, they must have started with a cow.

Went to Umami Burger on a Tuesday night after hearing rave reviews about this place from other friends.  We had a group of 9 people and were seated outside in the patio area.  The wait wasn't too long but we did have to wait until most of our party was there to be seated.   After having read some of the yelp reviews, I was expecting small portions of everything, but I was pleasantly surprised at the sizes. I ordered the Truffle Burger but also tasted the Umami Burger as well.  I would have to say hands down the Truffle Burger was the best.  The meat was juicy and the truffle flavor was just enough.  The meat wasn't too pink or raw ( I ordered medium).  The smushed potatoes and tator tots (which isn't on the menu but u can order it) were delicious!  I had the roasted garlic aioli and jalapeno ranch dipping sauce, which were both very good.   As for drinks, no beer here but they have several other sodas and beverages.  I ordered the sparkling soda water which had a citrus taste but not sweet.  It came in a bottle and was a perfect compliment to my burger.  It wasn't very cold so I had to ask for a cup w/ice. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive so we didn't have any service issues. All in all, Umami is worth trying at least once.  I really did enjoy the Truffle burger.  But if I were to compare it to the burger at Father's Office (my current fav), I'd still say Father's Office burgers are better.

For your everyday burger nothing beats In n out. For your upscale burger, nothing beats Umami. I ordered the Umami burger and ate it all really quickly. I ordered a second one and shared that one with a friend. The grasshopper pie desert was like a mint chip macaroon dipped partially in chocolate. Its really unique and tasty. I hate the parking. You have to pay to valet in their ridiculously small lot. I think it was one or two dollars. That irked me. The fries with all the sauces were really good too. Definitely try this place out if you're reading this review.

The first time I went, I ordered the Socal burger, and I know never to put roasted tomato or parmesan crisp onto my burgers. It doesn't compliment the meat; it overwhelms it, and I ended up leaving extremely disappointed. The thin fries were amazing, but I expected better tempura battered onion rings. It was a bit dense over the onion. I thought their special sauce would taste spectacular, but I don't never remember if it had a taste. The jalapeno ranch is amazing though. I recommend that. Having said that, the second time I went, I ordered the triple pork burger. That's the only burger I recommend. I tasted their burgers, but the pork burger is the best. The smushed potatoes were amazing with lots of cracked black pepper, but the sweet potato fries and thick cut fries they had were fried in a really weird oil and made me feel sick tasting and smelling it. I asked the waitress what kind of oil it was fried in, but she had no clue. It's an experience you enjoy once because it's the famous Umami Burger, but after that, the only reason I'll go back is to take friends who've never been there.

truffle burger + sweet potato fries + valet = $20. (drink not included) Burger itself was a 4. Abit on the heavier side, I felt alil nauseous after I devoured it quickly. I am not a fan of burgers, but I like to try out new joints. Kalbi, Father's office, a whole lotta IN-N-Out, and this place.... anywhere else I should be aware of in LA? It's good, but not OMG! good!

It isn't just the savory richness of the portabello mushroom slices or the sharp, nuttiness of the parmesan crisp or even the sweet tangyness of the oven dried tomato that makes the Umami burger good.  Sure, they do enhance the flavor profile of the overall dish.  However, it's the fact that this place excels in the fundamentals - the two key components that are essential to a well-executed burger.  The juicy, well-seasoned, and flavorful patty (though I would have preferred it a bit less done) is perfectly complemented by a buttery, fluffy, and spongy bun that's been toasted just enough on the insides to meet the challenge of absorbing all the delicious juices AND provide a subtle crispy/crunchy contrast in texture all in one bite.  It's just too bad that their sides are underwhelming.  Still, when it comes to the main event, I'll be coming back for seconds and more.

This little place is A-MAZING!!! From the $2 valet parking to the outstanding hospitality..... My friends and I went one day and were treated to gourmet burgers (a portabello  substitute for me, since I'm vegetarian), fries and onion rings that when the taste hits your mouth, it's like a tsunami of new, exciting flavors ! And the dipping sauces, well... I was kinda disappointed because they served such a small portion in the little spoons (made for Chinese soups) but again....the flavors......so new and exotic and just plain yummy!!  For dessert, we got the not-what-your-Grandma-made ice cream sandwiches... Ice cream in between two French macaroons... Heaven!!!   I'm totally going back!

"Your mommy burger" vs "Your daddy burger"...I'll take "the daddy burger" any day. I'm of course referring to the Umami Burger vs the Fathers Office burger. The "Father's Office" burger itself is a more satisfying, flavorful, beefier combination of ground cow...the cuts/proportions of course are proprietary, but I suspect some short rib in Father's Office gives it the bovine flavor boost I yearn. While I like medium rare burgers (only if meats are fresh ground, as is done at most of the gourmet burger joints/pubs), 2 of the 4 burgers we had ordered were actually raw...and the "E. coli burger" was not even on the menu! Moreover, the innards of the Classic Umami burger were not a compelling combination/addition to me. The "parmesan crisp cow patty", the "soggy portabello mushroom" and the "dry roasted tomato slice" did nothing to give me that "up up and away" 5th Taste Dimension. Fries were just so so ordinary, even with their namesake ketchup. In and Out and Islands fries are so much better. While it was generous of the proprietors to send their onion rings to the Gulf of Mexico to assist in the recent oil spill, it just made for a grease laden product for the consuming public in Los Angeles.  Lucky for me,  the border guards didn't stop the Mexican Coke from coming through, as that was the highlight of my meal. All in all, an overall disappointment, especially in light of Yelp's accolades...definitely, nothing to write home to "U Mommy" about.

Meh... it was fine.  Definitely overhyped and overpriced.   I was seated in the torture chamber, which was depressing - loud, clinical, and uncomfortable.   The basic Umami burger was greasy and not what I'd call "umami delicious" -- certainly not on my list of best burgers.  And the onion rings were just greasy and overwrought. Not sure I'd find a reason to return, but with so many interesting and healthier options in LA, that's OK.

I just dont get it.  The concept is good, but I find everything else lacking.  Sure my burger tasted good, but it is more like a slider than a burger.  I mean for what they charge shouldnt it be more than a few bites?.  The french fries were a joke.  6 french fries?  Really?  6, freakin fries?  Ridiculous, they also werent crispy,  OOOPS!   The onion rings werent much better.  A properly made and cooked onion ring allows you to take a bite out of it.  A poorly made one,  when bitten, has the onion slide out of the crispy goodness.   Note to Umami burger, i want an onion ring, not a cooked onion and some crunchy bits on the side.  By the way how is that $3 soda working out for you? Look up the word umami, see what it means, and figure out how to incorporate that into the food. Dont believe the hype, this place sells overpriced and very very average food in a clean, cool and hip setting.  Its all smoke and mirrors.  At the end of the day its about the food and Umami burger is mediocre at best.

Uh , do not believe the HYPE ! OVER PRICED . Grumpy server .Everything is "extra" (ie: fries , onion rings , salad ) Small burger on a BIG square plate came to the table lookin' lonely and well, kinda pathetic. Burger size was just enough . Perhaps to accompany the burger , a (free) side like a little salad or something? a free pickle? a chip ?cole slaw? At the very LEAST  for presentation purposes ? I mean C'mon guys ! A bag of Russet Potatoes is like 4bux ! Throw in some fries ! $3 for a "real " Mexican coke? Give me a break !  Growing upin Echo Park ( yes , PRE-HIPSTER ) the "real " coke was in every corner store, no big deal . I guess it probably IS a BFD if you did'nt grow up in a diverse part of the city . So get your $3 "real"coke on Or go to La Guadalupana and get a six pack for slightly a little more ! It's funny watching people drinking from the "real coke" bottles looking around. When did a Coke become so hip ? really ?that is some FUNNY shit ! 1/2 star for the good burger meat and the remaining stars to the BEER  ! I guess it WOULD be the best burger joint in town , if all the other ones had closed, got swept away by a flash flood  or burned down or something. Trying waaaaaay too hard ............................. . What a mediocre place . Cheers. (Review was for Sunset location )

The term "gourmet burger" is somewhat of an oxymoron in itself. Burgers are inherently casual, non cloth napkin fare, sometimes meant to be eaten standing up, Tommy's-style. However, after hearing all the hype from friends and family, I decided to try it. This is definitely not your casual drop in after work burger joint. It's also not very comfortable (open stares from hipsters, back to back seating on the tight "patio"). Don't expect standard burger prices of $5 or so. A meal of 2 hamburgers and one order of fries set me and my husband back almost $30. The Umami Burger was delicious. But worth it? No.

THE REVOLVING BURGER DOOR. No, I am not a lunatic for giving them 3 stars. I have no clue how to rate this place. The menu keeps getting changed. I follow Umami on Twitter and they let you know what new burger they're making but they never tell you what burger they discontinue. It kind of sucks when you are out and decide that you need your fix on a triple pork burger only to realize that it has been taken off the menu or that you would like the seamami and that's gone. Wait, how about the onion burger, nope guess again that's gone too. I could try to review the chili burger or the veggie burger but yep they're also gone. So here is what you need to know the only burger that stays on the menu is the Umami burger guess they can't change that. The burger I tried last week was the No. 5 burger. It's their new pork burger but not even close to the original triple pork burger they started with. This one was served to me medium rare and when I asked the server to have it re-cooked he advised me that all burgers are served medium rare.  This was more on the rare side as it was still mushy, The server was a bit upset at me that I didn't tell them when I ordered it.  Well, I have ordered the triple pork burger and it was never served to me medium rare. I do not like my pork medium rare. I'm the one paying for it and eating it so just cook it the way I want. Well, it seems that this is the only review that I can give you on the pork burger but don't hold me to it for all I know they probably no longer serve it. It seems pointless for me to tell you what I ate and show you pictures, then you go there and it's all changed. I know right now the economy is bad but you pay $ 2.50 for 4 onion rings. I know the prices of onions have not gone up by that much.   Why did I give this place a three star rating: inconsistency.

I would have given it 5 stars because the gourmet burgers were really, really good! The location was also really cool. With that said, our server did not ask how I wanted my burger prepared and it came more rare than I usually eat and did not feel well as the night went on. Argh! I know I have some responsibility here since I did not ask, but in the midst of conversation and orders, I had forgotten. Anyway - it is a good gourmet burger and worth a try.

You know what would make this place better? If they didn't make such a big fucking deal out of their burgers. Wouldn't it be nice if you just came in here one day and found out that, hey, these burgers are A-OK? Because all the build-up really leads to confusion, then disappointment. The food is fine. It's not spectacular. And they RAN OUT OF FRIES. What in the world?? On a Sunday afternoon, and not a particularly busy one, mind you. Did they not realize that people were going to order fries with their burgers? Maybe they thought everyone would be too busy with church to eat burgers and fries? We got the fried eggplant instead, which was fine. Like "meh" fine. The condiments were disappointing. I like ketchup, so the soup-spoon's worth (literally served in a ceramic soup spoon) was not enough, and the "aioli" had less taste than plain mayonnaise. They do offer up a few other smarmy sounding dips, so you might have better luck with those. The really annoying thing was the service. The guy who seated us and who ultimately took over as our waiter was pretty decent, but the man-queen inferno who bitched his way through the first part of our meal was really something else. We had this bizarre moment when, after huffily taking our orders, he tried to take our menus and I asked to keep one in case we wanted dessert. He said "Well the desserts aren't on there anyway," and started grabbing my menu. To which I replied by pointing at the ice cream sandwich and mocha something-or-other listed on the back and saying "Are those not desserts?" Then he got really huffy (I mean, you could really see the color rising on his ferrety little face) and said "Well, okay, ONE dessert is on there. But we have others. I mean, I'll TELL you about them. LATER." Anyway, he left the menu there, disappeared long enough for us to have to ask the nice waiter for water, then came back with said waters and slammed them on our table hard enough for backsplash. Then said, "Ok, can I take the menu now???" Go for it dude! I'm sure the 0 new customers really need to see that one particular menu! Do not go out of your way to go here. But hey, if your friends are already there, or if you're stuck in traffic on La Brea and could really go for a burger, by all means. Have the pork burger. The umami burger itself was not that great.

I went to Umami with Kit P.; her review is here, too.  I agree with a lot of what she says, but even though the staff lost our order I thought they made a very genuine effort to put things right.  Also, I guess I liked the Umami burger itself more than she did -- it was really outstanding, with a really nice char on it, and I don't normally even like mushrooms.  Gotta agree that the sides (onion rings, pickles) need a serious tweak.   I really like the _theory_ of this place, and would love it if execution can come closer.

took one of my kids out for dinner.  it was nothing but AWESOME yummy goodness!!!! we ordered umami (me) and truffle (kwonza).  the burgers were cooked medium rare (according to the server), but seemed more like medium.  regardless they were both soooo juicy, flavorful and just oh so yummy!!!  umami had this crispy parmesan cheese which was awesome!  and the truffle burger.  o.m.g.  seriously it was dripping with yumminess. we also ordered tempura onion rings.  very good.  nice crispy tempura shell which had this nutty savoriness that went well with juicy onion's sweetness.  omg.  so good. and also got some salad which was basically a tomato slices with mozzarella cheese with olive oil and bacon bits.  very good. only detractors - super small, no refills on diet coke (they have this tiny tiny tiny little bottle... how am i supposed to get my diet coke fix?!?!), and the parking (the area makes you get their valet parking.  it's only $2, but still) i loved this place.  def going back again and again.  over father's office too! oh yeah, went on a wed night - it was around 7pm.  there were couple of tables open, so we were promptly seated.  also the service was very courteous and prompt.  i dunno who our server was, but he was very nice. when we left, around 730, there was a line out the door.  feels good beating the dinner rush.

This is really a double edged sword here at Umami burger. It is possibly the best burger I have ever stuffed into my pie hole, however, the rest of the experience was not so good. This location on La Brea has a serious parking issue. We waited longer for the valet to get the car than we did eating our burgers. They have a severe shortage of parking spots and they share the lot with 3 other business'. Back to the food. The burger was fantastic, the bun was the best I have ever eaten, and the onion rings were out of this world. The atmosphere leaves a little to be desired. There's ony room for about a dozen tables. Some are right in front of the door,mine was right in the way of the back area where they prep beverages, so I kept getting bumped into by the waitress as she rounded the corner. It's LOUD! It was difficult to talk to my dinner companions above the din from the lousy acoustics. So in a nutshell, great food, poor planning for everything else. I would try another location and see if it's any better. Veni..... Vidi....... Chowici! I came, I saw, I ate! (this is trademarked, so dont' fuck with it)

This past Saturday I went back to Umami on La Brea with tetrad of girl friends.  The dining experience is casual, which is not only apparent by the plastic cups, but also by the clientele, as girls strolled up in raggedy cut-off jean shorts and flourescent bikini straps exposed through flimsy tank tops.  The five of us scooted into a 4-top on the outside patio where constructed slatted panels blocked the visual distraction of La Brea traffic.  I ordered the eponymous UMAMI BURGER which is made with beef (ground in-house), roasted tomatoes, caramelized onions, sauteed shitake mushrooms, and a parmesan frico (which is grated parmesan fried into a thin crisp).  The flavors that emerge from the combination of these ingredients are so explosively savory, it's impossible to imagine without trying it.  The fluffiness of the impeccable Umami bun (cutely stamped with a bold "U"), the softness of the beef, and the juiciness of the tomatoes are then countered by the crunchiness of the parmesan crisp.  There was so much tastiness in a single mouthful, my tastebuds didn't know where to focus.  What results is a bite that goes far beyond the narrow category of a burger.  This is a hearty, flavorful, gourmet burger at its best. Covering all of our bases in the "Sides" department we then ordered SMUSHED POTATOES, THIN FRIES, SWEET POTATO FRIES, and the MARKET SALAD.  The Smushed Potatoes were fried to a crisp on the outside and mushy in the center.  Then they were covered in sea salt and aligned atop a plate of drizzled garlic aioli sauce.  Thinly sliced, the Thin Fries and Sweet Potato Fries were basic but the plethora of dipping sauces spiced them up a bit.  As the sauces were delivered to our table, all of the girls started plucking them up from the table, smelling each one.  My friend Danielle pointed out, "You're smelling the sauces like they're candles!"  Flavors included: ROASTED GARLIC AIOLI, JALAPENO RANCH, HOMEMADE KETCHUP, DIJON MUSTARD, and a spicy DIABLO SAUCE. Umami is now my favorite burger joint in L.A.   In fact, it's so good it can help heartbreak: http://wp.me/p1IEAz-1w

Umami Burger is an interesting experience... first of all, I would like to say, it doesn't really taste like a burger at all... I guess that's the Umami-ness of the experience.  It is good however, and each burger is made with care.  Overall I enjoyed it-- but I'm not sure I'd wait 30 minutes for one, and there will be those that love it and hate it-- the only way to know is to go for yourself.

The burgers here look like those perky little burgers you see on fast food commercials. You know the ones where the bun is perfectly round on top, the lettuce is crisp and green, the tomatoes are plump, and the patty is perfectly seared? I bring this up because Umami's burgers look so inviting you just can't wait to bite into them. And the taste delivers! Two of us shared two burgers. The Umami burger and the Truffle burger. The patties were well-seasoned, maybe even slightly on the salty side. You could definitely taste that they used good quality meat, and it was perfectly cooked. The Truffle burger was AMAZING on the first couple of bites. The meat and cheese and truffle glaze just worked really well together. How to describe it? Tasty! Umami!! I guess that's what they invented that word for... It was really good, but sadly, I kinda got sick of the Truffle burger taste towards the end. Perhaps it was too rich. Also, if you don't eat it quickly enough, the cheese starts looking and tasting congealed and greasy. I guess that's why their burgers are on the smaller side. What about the Umami burger? Well, if you think of the Truffle burger as taking your taste buds on a rollercoaster, then the Umami burger is more of a steady ride. Its good when you start out eating it, and still pretty good at the end. So if I were eating a burger by myself, I'd go with the Umami. While I liked the burgers, I was not impressed with the tempura onion rings. They were tasteless, as if someone had forgotten to salt them. And the Umami ketchup that came with them tasted like watered down ketchup. The friend that I was with said the fries weren't great, so we didn't get them. I feel like if you can make a great burger, it can't be that hard to make good sides too. Comon Umami burger!

Good stuff!   The different locations feature different burgers at different times.  So, don't get your hopes up for a burger they had at La Brea and expect to have it at Santa Monica.   Call first. That said, here goes... Umami burger - you've got to try it sometime.  Delectable. Hatch burger - got a little kick to it.  Love the flavor. Triple pork burger - it was ok, jus' sayin.  Too porky for "me." Earth burger - tasty, but not really a burger...so, what was the point. Manly burger - yes!  A must! SoCal burger - ordinary, but good. Thin fries - ok  (used to have these big fat brick -size fries, they were dry.  Not missing anything.) Sweet potato fries - YUM! Tempura onion rings - meh (too much batter) I think you get 5 of 'em. Truffle beet salad - THE BEST! No alcohol here. Go to SM for beer & wine. Real Mexican Coke :) Cake monkey desserts - homemade ding dongs and ice cream sandwiches are "ok."   La Brea has very few parking spots, valet (always a line) and street (good luck).  Santa Monica's parking is easier and you can check out Fred Segal while you're there.   Servers have always been gracious and knowledgeable.  Don't always go with their recommendation, though.  All in all, love this place.

Skip the valet parking and park on the adjacent streets, very easy to find parking. Restaurant size is kind of small, so be prepared for a wait if you come around peak lunch or dinner hours. We came here for a weekend lunch and for the 3 of us we ordered the Truffle Burger (very disappointed with this one, the truffle flavor was totally missing, so I say, don't order it), hatch burger and triple pork burger (both were yummy) and get the tempura onion rings (delicious! not as good as Biergarten but strong No. 2). Its a great concept for burgers, I just hope that the portion can be a bit bigger and more variety.

This is another case of needing a half star. I'd be more comfortable giving them 3.5 stars rather than 4. Went this Monday night for dinner. I got the Umami and my sister and friend both got the Truffle Burger. We ordered 2 fries and 1 side of onion rings. Service was quick. Helpful with answering our questions. The only problem I had was that our water/lemonade glasses weren't refilled. That is a big thing for me. Not only does it keep the patron happy, it shows that your server is still being attentive. It wasn't crowded, so there was't an excuse for not refilling our drinks. We weren't offered dessert after - which i think should be automatic at all restaurants serving dessert. Portions are not gigantic, but I was satisfied. The Umami burger was delicious. The  burger comes medium rare, which all meat should be (hiss and boo to people who overcook their meat!). The oven roasted tomato and mushrooms really make the burger. Granted, I was burping that tomato all night - but the taste was really worth it. Apparantly, the Umami has a parmesean crisp in it - I didn't taste it, but that didn't stop me from enjoying the hell out of that burger. My two problems with the burger: 1) the buttered bun. It was super tasty, but had to wipe my hands over and over because it was so greasy. I would ask them to toast it just on the inside and keep the butter off the outside to keep my fingers clean 2) The patty was a bit loose. Again, this didn't affect the taste at all - In fact, I enjoyed the chunky texture of the patty. But, it's not fun when your burger falls apart and stains your shirt. Umami could stand to pack their patties a little firmer. Even though I had these problems, the taste of the burger was still very good. Fries and Onion Rings - Boo! For having such a small menu, Umami Burger should be masters at making both fries and onion rings. The fries were bland and very soft. Came with the ketchup, which was nothing special. The onion rings were too large and had an overwhelmingly yeasty flavored batter. I know it says they're beer battered, but the flavor of that batter was overwhelming. The ring size was too big, so you ended up biting into one, pulling out the slimy onion and eating the batter by itself. I am a lover of all onion rings - but these were just not good. Came with the aoili, which was good, but could have been a wee bit thinner. I make my own aoli, with tons of lemon juice so it's less of a mayo than it is a dressing, so that might be personal preference. So overall, the experience was Umami Burger was good. The fact that the burger was so tasty made up for the weak sides.              burger : 4.5 stars fries and rings : 2 stars              service: 3.5 stars

Was expecting to be more dazzled. Got the hatch burger, whose 4 types of chiles i had hoped would provide more of a spicy compliment to  the richness of the burger. I'm not into thick and juicy and bloody so I tried to order on the well done side, but it didn't happen. The flavors they impart on the burgers though are great. I liked the garlic-y thing going on in mine, as well as the parmesan crisp on my companion's standard Umami burger. If I was the type of person that worshiped the juicy-thick-meaty aspect of burgers, then I'd probably give Umami 4 and 1/2 stars.

The Earth Burger has an interesting taste.  The patty was just TOO MUCH.  I had to fork off like half the patty.  The buns are great though and the sauce on the burger was awesome.  It is annoying that they don't do any substitutions or puts things on the side for you.  Also, the fact that you have to pay for extra ketchup is ridiculous.  Also, 3 dollars for a soda is way too much.  It was an interesting experience to go eat at Umami Burger.  I don't know if I would come back.  The bun was the only good part.

Way overrated. Went to this after work, and the waiter was really obnoxious to her and just overall really unattentive during the whole dinner. I must admit that the meat was the best burger meat I've ever had and the bun too was delicious- light and airy; however, even then, it is too tiny for the price. Hmph. I guess the haughty/ pretentious attitude of the waiter ruined it for me. Oh, and the sweet potato fries are not that great either. Disappointed.

Different? Yes. Taste? Good. Price? Not so good...for $10+ the burgers are pretty dang small, and that's all you get...a burger. Fries & drinks cost extra. I do have to say I've never tasted anything like it thus far and I enjoyed it...I just wish the portions were bigger or the prices were lower, especially when they have you paying for valet parking too (who by the way seem to not know what they're doing?) Overall it's a good place to eat with some friends, but if you're really hungry it might not be worth the $ and the hassle.

My bf and I went here last night for dinner after our trip to Target. His co-worker actually recommended us to go here because of an article that he read. There was a 20 minutes wait around 7:30pm on a Sunday, which isn't bad. The host was really nice until she told us we can have a table by the door and then changed her mind when a party of four asked her for the table. I was a little irritated because you shouldn't tell us that we can have the table and then make us wait outside in the cold and sit us in the back room, that's why I subtracted one star for that particular situation. Our waitress was really nice and attentive. Now the food: we ordered the umami burger, hatch burger, sweet potato fries, coffee toffee ice cream sandwich, ice tea, and the mango soda. I liked the umami burger better than the hatch burger because it has more flavor to it. The meat for both burgers were cooked perfectly and the bun has a little sweet flavor to it like the Hawaiian rolls. My only complaint about the hatch burger is that you can't really taste the chillies in there, but my bf liked it. The sweet potato fries were nice and crispy and it was served with ketchup, it's not your typical ketchup either (I can't really explain it, you just have to try it!). The coffee toffee ice cream sandwich were delicious and it had bits and pieces of toffee in it. The ice tea doesn't really taste like ice tea so I wouldn't order it again, but the mango soda was really good. Our bill came out to be $36 something for all that food, it's a little bit pricey but it's not the average burger. Overall, the food was good and we would come back again to try the other burgers out.

I've eaten at the Hollywood locations many times since it opened.  Sadly the last time will also be my last.  They've gone from making their own ketchup to metering out store bought sauce and having the gall to charge extra if you request more.  The burger itself is still a decent burger but way overpriced and I think the restaurant believes its own hype.  The wait staff used to be more personable but seem to have forgotten who or what a customer is.  Simple friendly hospitality goes a long way.  If I want to be served by surly wanna be actors I'd go somewhere else.

Great burgers! Can be a little pircey but well worth it. The combos they have are a good pairing and a little discounted. Cool atmosphere in a good location. Lunch is your best bet as dinner can get pretty busy and cause a long wait, especially on weekends. I ate the manly burger witch was perfect. The smushed fires are great and their house ketchup is addicting.

This was my first time trying Umami Burger. Driving down La Brea Blvd, it was pretty ghetto, so I didn't know what to expect. Umami popped up really quickly on the street and there was valet parking available in the lot for $2.50. The modern and tidy appearance of Umami doesn't quite match up with the surrounding area, so it was a surprise. I didn't know where else to park, but I'm guessing there is parking around the block somewhere for free since I saw a couple groups walking from the side of the building into Umami. I decided to split a umami burger and a truffle burger with a friend. We also split sweet potato fries and an order of onion rings. The sweet potato fries were sprinkled with a mixture of brown sugar, cinnamon, and a bit of salt. As a stand alone, I liked the fries because I like cinnamon a lot, but I didn't feel like the sweetened fries paired too well with the salty burgers or the ketchup that came with them. The Umami burger was well made, but I just was not digging the components. Still pretty good though I must admit. The Malt-Battered Onion Rings were really delicious. I would definitely get those again if I came here. They were perfectly fried to the perfect crunch, and the batter was really tasty. The truffle burger was the best item I tried here. It was like beefy mouthfuls of heaven with each bite. The only gripe I had was that the portion sizes of the burgers were really small, but I guess that's to be expected with a gourmet burger. I'm compelled to give Umami Burger 5 stars for the truffle burger alone. The restaurant really cannot hold large parties. Maybe at most groups of 6 people, but it's designed more so for parties of 2 or 3.

Pretty negative overall experience.  After waiting 90 minutes (!) three of us were crammed into a 2-top.  While the burgers were pretty good, they aren't quite as good as the Counter or Father's Office.  Add in bad service - remember, they're going to pay attention to Brett Ratner, not you. I mean, what's the deal here?  You can't even get a glass of water.  They don't have anything to drink that's not loaded with sugar, so I asked for water. 3 times.  Never came. I had to go up and plead with them to give me water after my meal was served.  "We're running low on glasses" said the owner--total dick, by the way. Your burgers aren't good enough to get away with that kind of attitude (I'm thinking umami must be the Japanese word for heavy on the salt). Just another flavor of the moment, I'm afraid.  PASS.

The burgers are delicious but the whole thing is over priced.  At $20-$30 per person for a burger and fries, you expect the service and environment to be worth the money.  Not the case.  Cramped or outside seating only.  Snotty waitresses with attitude.  I ordered the fried potato wedges... gross btw... and when I told our waitress we did not enjoy them (undercooked) her direct reply was "Well, YOU ordered them!"  As if I expected them to be uneatable when I ordered.  I'm done with Umami.

I have been to Umami about a dozen times, it's always quite good, I love the salads which rotate seasonally and the fries are good as well.I've had a variety of burgers. On almost every visit I would rate Umami a 4 STARS. BUT this trip was exceptional, here's why. TUNA BURGER. Didn't know they had a tuna burger, I understand it's a sometimes special. I'm pretty picky about my Tuna's ( gulfstream being my baseline for all things tuna burger). I grilled ( no pun intended) our server pretty good when she recommended it. Really sounded strange to me and I ordered the wasabi aioli on the side. But she said it was more of a chop than a grind ,which I like, and had some interesting veg on it like gingered carrots. I truly was not expecting to have my socks knocked off. Off they flew! Awesome tuna burger totally Umami, think tunasushi burger. Now what really took us to the moon was the cheesy tots. Home-made tater tots filled with cheese, are you kidding? The old fashioned way.MUST ORDER.Can't believe we didn't know about these.  Totally a salt lick ( so if you don't like salt, don't order an complain) but cheesy potatoey goodness.We sat there trying to decide if we needed a second order. So the good news is that it was a crazy good, 5 star meal. Bad news is I may never go back to Umami unless they have the tuna burger.......

We found out about this place randomly from UrbanSpoon and thought we'd give it a try for lunch.  We went around noon and there was no wait. The burger with blue cheese was amazing, and the fries were good, but the portions of both were disappointingly small.  We paid $29.23 for two burgers with fries, an espresso and a cookie - and walked out wondering why we would pay that much when Fatburger is just a couple of blocks away with good quality food and ample portions at much lower price. We don't plan to go back, but if they want to stay in business I recommend they bring their portion sizes up and prices down in line with their competitors.

If Father's Office is 4 stars, so is this (if only for the burger).  In respect for the great burger wars, we went to Umami and Father's Office on consecutive days.  At Umami, we had both sweet potatoe and regular fries.  Regular wins.  We had the Umami and Triple Pork Burgers - both were very good.  I'd take the Triple Pork over the Umami.  They are both definitely unique in the flavor, ingredients and preparation to the point of fair comparison to Father's Office which is unique in its own right. But in the grand scheme, I'm still taking the Rock n Fish Manhattan Beach burger over all.  I better get back to Manhattan to see if I still feel the same way.

Let me sing a love song to Umami.  Cool Daddy and I live so close to an Umami but had never eaten there.  We entered once but I didn't care for the room and I REALLY wanted a glass of wine.   A few nights ago I was craving a burger.....it had been at least 6 months....so asked Cool Daddy to swing by Umami on his way home. Woweee!!!!!!!  We have now, 3 days later, tried several burgers and sides.  Some might call this an addiction but Charlie Sheen would call it "Winning".   Okay, forget the bad joke.  This food is outstanding....it takes burgers to another level.  They grind their own beef in-house and process their own cheese.  The ingredients are all excellent.  Everything is cooked to perfection.  Fortunately, they do not suggest cooking meat until it's charcoal.   We have now eaten the following: Umami burger with caramelized onions, sauteed shitake mushrooms and Parmesan crisps.  I put their roasted garlic aioli on the wonderful bun.  I don't know what to say except Delicious!  Juicy, flavorful.  The beef was so good it seemed like an excellent ground steak in my mouth.  This burger was paired with thin fries and the yummy Umami ketchup.   The next night brought the 3 pork burger.  Fresh ground pork, chorizo and applewood smoked bacon served with manchego cheese and pimento aioli.  F..k me.  So much yummy pork prepared so well and so juicy.  We paired this with sweet potato fries sprinkled with a cinnamon sugar.  I just don't know what else to say except Bravo! Tonight Cool Daddy picked up more crack, I mean Umami burgers.  The SoCal burger reminds you of a regular burger but, once again I repeat myself, on another level.  This delicious burger was with the excellent house-ground beef with butter lettuce, slow roasted tomato, house-made American cheese and caramelized onions with their own sauce.  We chose the smashed potatoes.....Dutch yellow creamers fried, smashed and refried with a peppery finish.   I don't know how they do it.  These are so inexpensive.   We probably won't eat inside the restaurant.....I like my wine....but burgers are now a regular part of our food plan.  I shall just have to dance even more to justify this but boy Umami makes me want to dance anyway!

Damn. The burgers here are pretty good if you ask me. First thing I saw was valet parking. Ew. My group and I (5 people) were told to wait a bit and that "bit" turned out to be 20 minutes so that was a bit annoying. The restaurant is pretty small with a little back area outside. It's spotless inside (I don't know about the restroom) and feels a bit like a cafe but more tasty! The waiters/waitresses there are a pretty damn motley crew if you ask me. But I liked it. Plus they were all attentive to their customers. We got seated once a couple tables opened up and the service was pretty good. I shared two burgers with a friend and ended up having 1/2 of a Manly Burger and 1/2 of an Umami Burger. We also got sweet potato fries and onion rings. (Each burgers about 10 dollars and each side is around 3-4 dollars so it's not too bad.) Their water actually had a nice thick slice of YELLOW lemon (which I love) instead of the meek ass piece of brown lemon that other places give you. But that's not the point. The Umami Burger was the best one in my opinion compared to the Manly Burger but my friends claimed that the Truffle Burger was the best. All of the burgers were thick and juicy and were not overcooked lumps of rubber. The Umami came with toppings: sun-dried tomato, a parmesan crisp (ooh-wee :D), and some portobello mushrooms I believe. Even with all the toppings, I could taste the flavor of the beef so it was great. However, it was a bit greasy. Other than that, the Umami Burger was fu**ing delicious. Maybe it was because I was a bit hungry but whatever. Oh! I almost forgot. The onion rings are extremely good here. They aren't your typical Burger King onion rings, but tempura batter onion rings. The batters very light but there seemed to be an excess of oil. The sweet potato fries were good but for some reason they added extra sugar and cinnamon on top and it was too sweet. They also give you a spoonful of their Umami Ketchup (like regular ketchup with tomato paste) or a different condiment if you choose. The burgers may not seem much here but they're pretty heavy and filling 'cause of the sides. Don't order too much thinking you can eat a shitload of burgers. Because you can't. I think I'll go back soon. :D

Finally had an Umami experience and had the Truffle burger... - liked that the host met you at your car after valet parking and whisked you off to your table. - liked the info tablet at the table - our server neglected to tell us about any the specials that day as we overheard them from the table next to us after our meal - tempura onion rings, good- just not enough of them - sweet potato fries with brown sugar, very cliche...reminds me of sweet potato casserole all we were missing was marshmallow fluff...would have been much more interesting with some cayenne or chipotle chili powder with the homemade ketchup - and the presentation- seriously, I get that the burger is the highlight- but a small rectangular platter is TOO big, too much negative space...there are other things that are better to present the burger on. BE CREATIVE! - the burger was tasty, service was fair, presentation okay...glad for the experience not sure I would go out of my way to come back.

After hearing so much about this place, I decided to give it a go. My friend and I had about 20-30 min until our table was up so we made a quick run to the liquor store across the street to grab a couple tall cans to down before heading inside. When we got back, our table was already and we had to wait another 45 min to eat, what a buzz kill! When we finally got in, i ordered the triple pork burger and oh boy, it sure was moist! the buns were sweet and very soft, which complimented the meat very well. We ordered the cheesy tots but they were sold out :[ Fries weren't too bad though. Although the meal was good, I probably won't come here too often because I still left kind of hungry! But definitely worth checking out!

For a burger to receive so much media attention, my friends and I wanted to see what the fuss was about. Well to me, I was just highly disappointed. For one of the smallest burger I have ever seen, this burger is way overpriced. The sauce is definitely forgetful because while writing this review I can't remember it. Fries were bleh, but the ketchup that goes with it, was actually pretty good (they make it themselves). The burger itself was a trip. Our server says they come medium rare unless other wise stated. So i asked for medium well, it came out medium close to medium rare. My other friend ordered it medium rare, forgetting to state his preference, and man was that burger red as a tomato. The decor was probably the nicest thing about this place. The service was eh to me, had way better. All in all you are paying way too much for some bad hype.

Food is Great Service is Stupid I woke up craving a burger and beer.  I stumbled upon Umami Burger. Walk in, looking clueless.  Waiting for some one to come and seat me or tell me to sit where ever I like.  Instead I walk in, they look at me and so finally I said "just sit anywhere?"  The waiter did not move from his stance, just pointed to where to sit. I sit down, next to a wall where I am no longer seen.  As I begin to twiddle my thumbs, waiting for them to... oh i dunno, bring a glass of water, or a menu! perhaps?  Nothing.  So I get up and the guy is just standing there and I simply said "umm could I get a menu or something?" he hands me a menu then comes over after I've sat down, asking if I want a drink. Which by the way, if you want a beer with your burger, don't come here!  A girl was shadowing him, I'm not quite sure who was training who.  I ordered the SoCal Burger, which was amazing good.  The ketchep for the fries was different, in a good way.  The service was too scatter brained.  Not once did they come over and ask how everything was or if I needed anything. Again, the food is great.  The service, was just not up to par as far as excellent dining service.  If I am going to have a $20 lunch, I expect the grand service. I probably wouldn't dine here in the future.

just had this today, not to long ago. we came by and did valet parking but it was popping... about 10 - 15 waiting outside. we waited about 20 minutes and then they called us in. the place is small. we sat in the back where there is a like bar table with stools. we looked at the menu and it is very simple about 7 burgers in the front and side dishes, drinks and desserts in the back. my bf got the umami burger it has 6 ingredients which are oven-roasted tomato, a parmesan frico(it is just parmesan grated cheese and it is baked like a thin cookie crisp), caramelized onions, sauteed shitake mushrooms, and house made ketchup. i got the hatch burger it has 4 different green chiles and house cheese which was some kind of white cheese. we then got sweet potato fries and house ketchup with it. (they have different flavored condiments: umami ketchup, dijon mustard, house spread, roasted garlic aioli, kombu relish and jalapeno ranch...you get  one free with purchase so pick a condiment) the umami burger was good, i liked the earthiness taste from the mushrooms and the caramellized onions with the roasted and slight sweetness from the tomato and the tang from the house ketchup. the burgers are cooked medium rare. the burger was so juicy and tender that the meat was like melting in your mouth. i recommend this burger for people that are coming for the first time... this will definitely give you a taste of how the burgers at umami are like. i really loved my burger the chilies in the burger were roasted they were not spicy but gave that roasted taste with the melty cheese and the juiciness of the burger gave a lot of flavors bursting in my mouth... and it was soo juicy the bottom bun soaked all the flavor. the sweet potato fries were nice and hot but i think because of the umami ketchup that had a slight tangy taste it really enhanced the sweet potato fries. overall, i was amazed how light the burger was and that it is a good portion. two burgers and sweet potato fries the bill was about $25. i also liked the plastic cups they gave us with our water because it had a indenture so we can grip it easier. great ambiance and had great seats where we conversated with the walls (sarcasm here). i didn't like how the waitress was rushing us because it was busy.  the food made up for the wait and the waitress. this is definitely my new favorite burger joint, i just wish it wasn't so pricey.

EH talk about overrated. the only thing good about this place is their ketchup, which they are VERY Stingy with. they put them in chinese soup spoons. not really a novel concept and impractical for ketchup! i got the truffle burger. it was flavorful but the meat was weird. it didn't seem like pure ground beef but a mixture of beef and unknown parts of the cow. gross. the bun looked good but was too chewy for my liking we also got the smushed potatoes which the waitress said was SO GOOD but they were EH! just slices of potatoes smushed like it says. NOTHING SPECIAL the onion rings were okay. wouldn't come again

Their umami burger is TONS of delicious, but what i think stands out more is the friendly and impeccable service!  our waiter even gave us a free side of fries to enjoy with our first experience here.  Umami signature burger is composed of ground beef, parmesan crisp cheese, shitake mushrooms, caramelized onions, and a bun brushed with clarified butter.  THANK YOU for the festivities that were happening in my mouth!  the portions were perfect for myself, i did not feel ridiculously full, but just good.  If you are a monster eater, you may need to order more sides, since they are a smaller portion.  The restaurant is small and quaint, not a good place for large parties, but a casual eating experience for maybe 4 max~

Visit this place once, then forget about it because I remember they charge extra for ketchup.  Why not charge for water and napkins too? Burger was great but they were really squeezing you for every penny you got! 5 Stars if they weren't so cheap.

oh hellll yeahh! THIS PLACE WINS. i got the umami burger with malt liquor tempura onion rings. the first bite into the burger was YUM YUMS. the meat is cooked a little less than medium rare so a bunch of JUIIIIIICCCEEEy blood comes drippping out and the bun is super fluuffy. the caramelized onions makes for a sweet mix of taste in the burger. this place f*kin rocks. on to the onion rings, more TASTIES... pretty good and super knocked out with oil but hey, thats what makes it fu#kin delicious. our server was very nice as well so that was cool. she always came by to refill our drinks. the only bad thing was the wait time. we waited around for about 35 minutes before getting a seat. the place is fairly small so everyone pretty much has to deal with that. overall, i was excited to eat here and satisfied with my meal. definately coming back for ya.

I've been hearing so much about this place that i decided to see for myself if this was deserving of the "best burger in la" title. i guess anything trumped up that much is bound to disappoint.  i ordered the umami burger, and while it might not be the Best thing i've ever experienced burger-wise, it definitely wasn't bad.  i liked the bun, and the meat was medium rare and juicy.  I wasn't crazy about the portobello mushroom though.

There were literally 6 parties AFTER us who ended up getting seated before us.  Our group of 9 were just waiting here the whole time. We ended up sitting in the back near the CAUTION tape which was honestly a bit trashy too. The burgers may have great reviews, but if the service sucks, then what's the point of going? I'm not going to pay for a burger that I had to wait over an hour to actually eat. All I know is that all 9 of us aren't going to be coming back.

The burgers are not good enough to justify the condescending service. Period. Got there, lady didnt want to let us sit because are whole party wasnt there yet... they were at the valet, 3 feet away. We were 8, so we waited for them to come over before we could go in. We get seated and my sister is craving pickles. We are told that all burgers are as is, there is NO substitutions, understandable. She asks for pickles and is told no. So the menu has a side dish of pickles, she asks "is that just a side plate of pickles?" "yes" the waiter replys, she orders it. It arrives as a plate of pickled veggies; ocra, carrots, onions, and chili'd pickles. Obviously not what she expected. She takes a bite of the chili'd pickles and discovers the chili. So she asks for it to be taken back, the manager then comes by and asks her if she ordered the plate just so she could have that bite and send it back. WTF? Really? He straight up lied to her, then had the nerve to make her feel bad about it. On top of this incident, another guest at our table had a honey allergy. He was told by the manager that the house made Ketchup had honey in it and to stay away from that. After all our dishes arrived we were short 3 orders of French Fries, the guest with the honey allergy mentioned it to a waiter and the waiter said that everything we ordered came out. Basically saying the customer was a liar. We told him to go double check and we wanted our fries. He came back and threw the fries on the table. The fries come with the dipping sauces in the plate, and they all came with Ketchup. Our friend had JUST been told he was allergic to Ketchup by the manager and then been served a plate with Ketchup in it. On top of the rude waiter saying he never even ordered it (mind that this waiter was not the one who took the order, so he had no idea what he was talking about). The fries are removed to be replaced and come back 2 minutes later with Ketchup again. Our friend at this point is so aggravated that he sends all his food back and refuses to pay. Any other restaurant would have wanted to see our party happy, but these people were so pretentious they didnt care about our business. Honestly, although my order was correct, the sandwich was nothing to write home about. I def did not taste Umami. I would NEVER eat here again. Also, we were here for another friend's birthday. In the end, her birthday dinner was ruined. We went down the street after to the Grill Em All truck and had better Burgers on a street corner. NEVER AGAIN!

Unimpressed. Too much hype perhaps, but if this is the best burger LA has to offer, it's truly disappointing. Got the Manly Burger, and while the beef is quality, I couldn't stand that there was no real bacon on it. Bacon "lardon" tastes basically like ham cubes. The regular fries were EXACT replicas of Burger King fries, the bun has a nifty U scorched into the top, but isn't that impressive beyond that. Turns to mush quickly with the juicy meat. And the ambiance and seating of this location makes me want to slap the designer across the face. If youre like me and need a space bubble to enjoy a meal and have conversation, prepare for an hour of silence and many awkward glances. Won't be going back anytime soon.

I'm a big fan of this place. I've tried every burger on and OFF the menu. I like them all. It just depends what kind of mood I'm in.  You do have to make sure you tell the how you want your burger cooked, I forgot to tell them once and the waitress didn't even ask and it was rare-i don't do rare. The place is very small so you need to wait outside until there's a table and the hostess tends to greet you outside or she comes running out when she sees you trying to go in, yes, it's that small. Lol. I always find street parking around the corner from the place. They also have valet. The time I've gone have been around 3 or so on the weekend and it's not overly crowded. Overall i enjoy the flavors of the burgers (umami and manly are my classic favorites). Ask for CHEESE tots (not on the menu) they're delicious! It's a special item that they occasionally tell you about. I recommend the burgers here and try to go for something other than the "average" burger.

I had the famous Umami burger.  It was a good burger, but nothing stellar.  I was looking forward to the dried tomato, but it was one slice of a roma and took up a seriously small part of the burger. I tried the shoestring fries and onion rings.  The fries were basically McDonald's fries and I was hoping for something better.  The onion rings were lightly fried in a tempura batter.  Unfortunately, being so lightly fried meant that the online wasn't really cooked. Parking was at a premium, but they did have valet.  Not a bad experience, but it isn't something I would rave about.

So the burgers are great, no issues there... But this tiny location on LaBrea leaves something to be desired... I was alone & went there for a quick bite on Saturday afternoon around 2:30pm. Half the tables including the outside ones were empty & i was seated in the back "closet" area which is approximately 8' x 8', has one single two person table in the middle of the room, and a black stone 15" deep countertop that runs along three of the walls.  The walls are tiled in a dark maroon color and there's no decoration up. It's honestly a pretty depressing place to sit... Please punch a window out to open the space, or have guests facing outwards, or do something because this seating location pretty much ruins the eating experience..

Ummmmm...maaaa...mmiii... I'm going to be dreaming about that darn truffle burger I just demolished for nights to come. It's the perfect size and portion for me, since most of the time I walk out of a restaurant with half of my food in a box. This time, I didn't even leave a crumb on the plate. I also had a taste of the turkey burger with apple relish and goat cheese. Can I say, "DAMN!!!"? Never really been into turkey burgers cause most of them cook the turkey meat dry and very little to no seasoning, but this one was really good. I only got to try the malt tempura onion rings sides and they were actually pretty good. They were on the softer side as opposed to those crunchy thickly battered deep-fried onion rings you get at other joints. But I actually prefer it this way, cause it used tempura batter and the onions were sweet, soft and thick cut. It just felt lighter and not as greasy. They do have other healthier options if you're not in the mood for oil and grease. I'll probably try their salads next time. I have to agree with other reviews though, their drink selection was super limited. They had some cool options like the Australian Ginger Beer and some other interesting sodas. But I was in the mood for some juicy red wine with my juicy truffle burger. Sadly, there was no alcohol. However, the waiter told me we could bring our own alcohol in and he didn't mention a corkage fee. So that's what I'm going to do next time. Umami here I come with my bottle of red. Oh btw: Service was great but a little on the slower side on a Tuesday lunch time. I didn't have the 'how's everything' question every 3 minutes. I also didn't have the 'can I refill your water or would you like anything else' question. Parking was tight, mostly double (and triple) parking or using the handicap spot per the restaurant's suggestion as they claim it to be their private lot.

The truffle cheese burger was savory.  Heavy.  Maybe a bit too rich for my tastes.  The umami burger was nothing special.  I expected the namesake to be spectacular but it was pretty standard.  The sides were a FAIL.  Don't even bother.  I'd like this place if they weren't so stingy with sauces and sides.

Burger gets a 5, so I would definitely try it at least once. I tried the Port & Stilton burger and it was very juicy and flavorful. The bun was really good too...very light and moist. It just kills me that these tiny burgers are $8-10 and the fries are about $3 and you only get like...7. Come on. I think for the burger foodies out there it might be worth it, since the focus is on the quality burger patty. However, I'd rather take my $$ to Father's Office. Also, don't bring more than 1 person. This place is TINY.

I know things in LA and in general can be quite pricey, particularly when you're paying for something the hipsters like. But, my $9 burger was far from satisfying, along with my experience at Umami. We arrived around 7, which was good because the rest of the world starts backing the place up around 8. We got a seat at the front, for the rest were taken already. We squeezed in tightly to this table made for the skinny (and I'm not exactly fat). And, it was a cooler November night, but for some reason they had the A/C pumping... directly on us. We asked them to turn it down, but they seemed to keep forgetting and put it on another three times. Freezing! And not so much fun to squeeze into a tiny space and put on a coat while eating... In terms of hospitality, aside from the A/C drama, the servers were quite nice. Perky boys to me with cheesy jokes. The food was less engaging. I ordered the Port and Stilton burger ($9), which had blue cheese and caramelized onions. For an extra $3, I could have added fries, but I'm glad I didn't; the portion size my friend received was quite small (think McDonald's small fries) and more deserving of being on a dollar menu. I thought the burger was a bit small as well, but it was okay. I mean, the first thing I noticed was my blood-stained bun... Um, my masters in public health makes me wonder about that. And, the bun was greasy. To my complaint about the greasiness, my friend said, "It's a burger." But, I argue, there are not only different grades of meat (fat content), but additionally, I think there is no reason that the preparer's greasy gloves need to handle my overly thin and slightly blood-soaked bun making it almost as messy as sloppy joe to eat... Sans fork, which you don't get when you sit down at your paper-covered table. You also don't get ketchup for your burgers without asking... and you only get one side per order of fries (e.g., ketchup, ranch dressing, etc.). Not really my kind of place, overall. I may be a bit controlling, but this place felt OCD and odd. Instead, skip the drama and go to Islands or Norm's.

3.5 - i was ready to be impressed. i mean, it's gotta be special if they tout "umami" no? a certain savoriness of quality and overall good taste if by japanese translations. i think my burger met the standard. i had the truffle burger ($11) with truffle cheese and truffle glaze. it was very truffly. it delivered on its name. what i enjoyed was the size of the meat patty. it was big and thick, juicy and cooked medium rare so that when you take a bite, you still see the pink. that way you know it isn't too tough. you can ask for it however you like of course but i prefer mine this way, and they got it perfectly. the buns were cute and plump but the best part was that they were SMALLER than the patty. i'm a firm believer that the meat should be bigger or at least the same size. i also had a quarter of the umami burger ($10). it seemed bland in comparison to my truffle glaze so honestly i have to say mine was better. * the sweet potato fries ($4) were skinny and crisply fried. mmm. - the tempura onion rings ($3) that most tables seemed to have ordered were a touch disappointing for me. while the batter was nice and light, there wasn't much onion flavor at all. so it begs the question of what you're really eating - basically just tempura batter, which was pretty oily. bleh. * i also had a bottle of their diet coke. it came in glass and in a mini size. waiter told me they were imported from denmark. cute. cool vibe. casual food. friendly staff. not bad.

Overpriced burger that is not worth the price and not worth the drive coming all the way out here.  I fail to see what all the hype is about the burgers at this place.  Yes, the meat is nice and soft and yes so is the bun...but 6oz for $10+ and its not even a Kobe or Toro patty.  Sure it may be worth trying out once, but this is not someplace I would visit frequently even if I lived nearby.

Heard a lot of good things about this place and was excited to finally try it. They have a good choice of different burgers but I wanted to try the most popular and original umami burger. It was very delicious. The burger was moist, juicy and had lots of flavor. The crunchy piece they add in the middle really gives it texture getting a good soft crunchy bite to the burger. The burger itself had this unique different flavor to it which I couldn't put my finger on but it was a good taste. I also got a side of onion rings which was also pretty good. Only complaint is the burger is kind of small and I ate that thing pretty quick. I will have to try the manly burger next time I go there.

OVER-RATED...clap clap clap clap clap... OVER-RATED...clap clap clap clap clap... I sound like i'm in a basketball arena......... On to the REAL review. Honestly, Umami Burger is way too hyped up for what it's worth. Sure, the whole "gourmet burger" craze is sweeping Los Angeles, but i've tried much better gourmet burger places than Umami. First off - Umami's portions are extremely small. A burger can fill a 12 year old's stomach, NOT AN ADULT'S STOMACH. If i'm going to pay $15 for a burger, I expect it to at least be somewhat filling! But it's not. I've tried every single burger on the menu, and all of the portions are meager. In terms of taste, i've had better. The sides (sweet potato fries, regular fries, onion rings) are very chunky and lacks flavor. Sweet potato fries are KEY when I eat at a burger place. The sweet potato fries must be good -- but Umami's are too thick. It takes away from the taste of dipping each sweet potato fry in sauce. I am very disappointed with Umami Burger. It's just a cool hipster place to hang out and chat with friends. Besides that, they need to UP the taste and quality of their food!!!!!!!!!!!!!

it's a 4.5. if not 5... i like hamburgers.  and i've tried a lot of them.  just to give you an idea, i don't care much for in'n'out (what's with the long line? totally not worth it imo), or any of the fast food burgers much.  i do like red robins, five guys, the lamb burger from mustard's grill, and roy's kobe sliders.. we got here on a sunday at 12:30 and waited almost 30 mins.  the girl that works the waiting list isn't very friendly and i was kinda annoyed.  we ended up getting seated right by the door in this tiny little table that was kinda ridiculous for 4 people. all i can say is thank god my friends are skinny.. the waiter was super cool.  with a pretty impressive memory since he recited literally 20 beverage choices from memory.  i wish they had a drink menu because they had some really interesting options (like mango and guava sodas) but i was too hungry to try to figure out what i want. we ordered the "smoosh potatoes" which is this potato smashed and twice fried thing sprinkled with salt and pepper and it was delicious.  the waiter gave us a taste of all of the condiments they offered and they were ALL yummy.  my favorite was the garlic aioli and the jalapeno ranch.  everyone at the table liked the dynamite (hot!) and their house made ketchup. but the highlight of the meal was definitely the BURGERS!!! they were sooooooo juicy and so flavorful.  i had the truffle burger and sampled the umami burger, hatch burger, and the triple pork burger.  i really can't describe them and do them justice so you really should just go and taste them yourself.  they are delicious, creative, innovative, fresh, and make you happy :) they offer valet parking for $2.50 but i just parked on 9th street.  the price isn't exactly cheap (ok, it's super expensive compare to in'n'out but that's like comparing ruth chris to black angus) so i don't know how often i'll return (plus i don't think my cholesterol can handle that either) but i will be dreaming about that juicy bite of burger until then..

Best burger I've had in years. ("Manly burger" - basically bacon, fried onion cheeseburger). Amazing. Was haunting me several hours after - I wanted another. $11, reasonable price. But they couldn't couple up the burger with good fries. How abominable the fries are here! Seemed like they used old fry oil. I know that look and taste. I mean, if I wanted Burger King fries, I could have gotten them for a lot cheaper down the street. I was really disappointed. I hope they read this and make a change. Also, they have one room in this place that is absolutely ridiculously designed. It's a small square room with stools all around it and then one small table in the middle. I can't explain why but it's really awkward - the design has to be changed in there, for sure.

This place was awesome, definitely lived up to its hype. I got the Manly burger and although I got it without the spicy wasabi mustard it was still really good. The burger was cooked perfectly and spiced well. The onion straws were not crunchy but rather soft and flakey. The bread at first looks like too much but then as you attempt to bite into the burger you realize the bread is warm and soft and easily compresses to fit into your mouth. After eating the burger I don't feel uncomfortably full and in pain, I feel rather light for a change. All the sauces were awesome but I preferred the Umami ketchup. I also tried the sweet potato fries which were probably my favorite fries due to its texture and natural sweetness.

I eat the burger. it doesn't really fill me up, but I'm happy because everyone else around me is smiling and enjoying their small burgers. The burger's are good actually, but a bit small. It's the shape of things to come because most of the people their are young. Real men, I notice aren't present. They're eating at Carls or Astro Burger. I won't return, even though the burgers were good. The fries are okay I guess. The service was good. In general, overpriced in my opinion.

I have heard so much about this place & waited along time to finally try these famous hamburgers. Here is what I found.... The Pros: The burgers were awesome; they were cooked to perfection & full of flavor. The onion rings were great, maybe the best I have ever had. The ketchup must be home made, it was awesome. I wanted to take some home but was too embarrassed to ask. They service a variety of vintage style soda bottles, which is pretty cool. The Cons: No hamburger is worth waiting an hour fo. I saw several people try to wait inside & were rudely thrown out.  The place is way too small & seating is very limited. Come on now, valet parking for a hamburger joint? The valet parking is ridiculous, they must of crammed 25 cars into 10 parking spaces, naturally when we were ready to leave they had to move 4 cars which took another 15 minutes. Too many preppy people for me, I can care less about valet parking, people with scarf's & directors hats driving Porches & Mercedes, men in suits & ties for a burger, kids with iPads, etc etc...If I had walked in there with sandals & shorts I would have felt out of place. Way to preppy for me. The prices are ridiculous, especially for such a tiny little hanburger. Come on now.....13 bucks for a hamburger & it doesn't include fries?? That is insane! Expect to pay about 20-25 bucks for a hamburger, fries & coke per person if you plan on having lunch here. Will I return, I very much doubt it. Not worth the hassle.

This place is amazing! The burgers are so juicy and fall apart tender and the onion rings are just ridiculous! Michael W. is a great server, he was fast, efficient and to be honest this is the best service I have ever had. I would drive 1,000 miles to go to this burger joint. Mmmmmmm!

A couple of my friends had claimed that the burgers at  Umami Burger are way better than the revered Father's Office burger. Oh man, a shit storm just went down when I heard that. Previously, I've found FO's burger to be the best burger I've had this side of LA. And so of course, with fighting words, I had to see what the hype was all about by checking this place out. I even called up my 2 buddies to help provide some additional weigh-in support to settle this once and for all. The place itself isn't very big and you would have to glance around twice to find it on the street. But the decors are simple, cozy yet contemporary. And simplicity is where Umami shines. Their menu items of a half dozen or so choice gourmet burgers are tantalizing. As it's our first time and not sure what to expect, we all decided to each order the signature Umami Burger ($9). We also ordered a side of fries and "tempura" onion rings (total $5). The Umami Burger arrived neat and stacked with a thick cut of the good stuff. The fries were thick cut...looked more like french toast sticks you get at BK. And the onion rings look like wearable fried bracelets. Along with the sides, you also get your choice of sauce served in Asian soup spoons. The verdict? The Umami Burger came out very juicy and delicious in every bite. Quite impressive, but still - we all agreed the FO burger still reigns supreme. We admit though, the Umami burger patty was definitely juicier and tenderer than FO's, but for overall taste and satisfaction, the FO burger still came out on top. How could this be? One thing about the Umami burger was that while tasty, the savoryness of the tomato-ish sauce(?) completely drowned out the taste of the beef. I thought I was eating a savory meatball marinara sub at one point - not a bad thing though, just where's the burger? The fries are good but a little on the dry side cause of how tightly packed the potatoes are. You're seriously biting into a candy bar chunk of potato. Soft and good but you'll want to dip it in some sauce. We tried the "Umami" ketchup which is tangy and sweeter than traditional ketchup. But they don't give you a whole lot in that spoon (and they're quite stingy on it too if you ask for more). The tempura onions were good though. Overall, a great place to try something fresh and familiar...with a slight Japanese twist. The food is delicious and light compared to the competition. Don't forget, they also serve the authentic Mexican Coke (the ones with real sugarcane added). Check it out. While my female friends may argue Umami is better than FO, the guys think otherwise. But we all agree both serve excellent burgers in their own special way.

Extremely delicious. Extremely expensive. Has a wide variety of choices and sides. I am a huge fan, their hamburgers are great and so are their sides, I have tried the Manly Burger, Umami Burger, Truffle Burger, and their... Bleu Cheese(?) Burger and they were all great. As for the sides, their cheesy tater tots are out of this world! Definitely worth a shot at least once.

I honestly think IN AND OUT is better than this place. People really overhype this place. There were too many ingredients in the burgers that overpower each other. I think the prices don't fit the product and it was just blahhh to eat. I didn't have the best time eating it because the server was not attentive. I don't think I'll recommend this place or go back anytime soon.

Sadly, the service has been severely lacking on the last several visits. The burgers are still tasty, but Umami doesn't seem worth the hassle between the long lines, poor service, and items on the menu that they've "just run out of". n addition, we've called a few times to do take out orders and they've told us that they will only do takeout if you come in and order it. The time that takes totally defeats the purpose of takeout.

I was in L.A. for a bit and decided to go back for another Umami Burger experience.  Like so many things I have experienced it was nothing like the first time.  I don't know what changed but the burger did not satisfy as well as the first time I ate it.  It was still a good quality burger but I think my taste buds are a bit spoiled from other gourmet burger joints.  The next time I stop by I'll try one of the other selections and see if any of them excite my palate.

i blame it on the hype.  after visiting umami for the first time today, i could only give it three stars.  the burgers were good, and pretty innovative, but i can't say that i'll go out of my way to get another taste of the umami burger.   our trio had the turkey miso burger, the socal burger, and the umami burger.  i thought all three were pretty delicious, but nothing extraordinary.  true, they have some interesting flavors going on there, but i felt like they weren't strong enough to make a lasting impression.  one thing i must say, though, is that the turkey miso burger was pretty damn moist.  if only they had packed in a bit more of the miso flavor, i would have been a BIG fan of it.   the fries were... good.  i've had better.  they weren't bad, but they weren't oh-so-delicious.  besides, i'm more a fan of the skinny rather than the fat, chunky fries.   ooh, one thing that i can highly praise is the LA Mill coffee they serve there.  strong, fresh espresso to finish off your burger?  yes, please! so, in the end, a *good* experience at umami.  nothing to "fan" over, though, so must give it a mere three stars. oh, ps, the place is TEENY TINY!  so, beware of the lunch crowd.

I came here this past Saturday night. The staff was extremely friendly which I appreciated. However, the food was not amazing. Their Umami burger was extremely tasty but for a quarter of the price I prefer In n Out. And thei Truffle fries were very lacking, both in taste and size portion. I had ordered to go and when I opened the bag at home the carton of fries looked pathetic. All in all I would go back to try different menu items but not my favorite place.

not the best burgers i've ever had, but definitely not average.  really moist compared to other burgers.  the umami burger is a tad too salty in my opinion, but it did have more flavor than my turkey burger.  my turkey burger was super moist, but lacked a little bit of... something.  with a name like "turkey miso" and an ingredient of "asian bbq sauce" i thought it would have more of an asian flair.  it did not, it was just a really good plain turkey burger.  fries were just "ok."  the fact that they ration the amount of sauce that comes with your fries is one indicator of how snooty this place is.  now let me tell you about the staff... we got there with 7 people for a party of 8.  they refused to seat us until our entire party was there.  which is fine, but the way the guy barked at us was really uncalled for.  then our 8th showed up and we went in to get a table.  he barked at us again to "go outside and wait!  i need to get the tables ready!"  well excuuuuuuse me, burger nazi! one of our friends asked if they could serve a burger on lettuce instead of a bun b/c he's doing the low carb thing.  the waiter widened his eyes and slowly shook his head back and forth.  you would have thought my friend was growing a second head with that reaction.  finally the waiter said they don't change anything about the burgers.  they could remove the bun, but if my friend wanted lettuce he would have to order a side salad, which he did.  and then his burger came on a bun.   my boyfriend and i ordered 2 sauces (b/c we wanted to try the umami ketchup AND the garlic aioli, god forbid) and they not only forgot one of our sauces they brought our other friend the wrong one completely.   the staff really ruined the experience for me.  while the burgers were good, i left with a bad taste in my mouth.   FYI, if you're in a large group make sure to bring cash.  they will only take 2 credit cards per group.  (also announced with a touch of disdain in their voice) p.s.  seth rogan and friends were there.  is this a celeb hang out?  is that why the staff thinks they can treat us "regular folk" like crap?

finally got to try the umami burger! i had lunch at the new location in los feliz. located at the spot that used to be cobras and matadors. really nice decor inside. kokeshi dolls along one side of the wall and some stuff written in japanese on the walls. why is it not written right to left and up and down? who knows? anyway i got the regular umami burger which was good except for one thing i wasn't really feeling the cheese. its crispy and seems kindof like it was cooked away from the meat and then put back on at the end. its weird, im used to the melty goodness of cheese on meat so the texture kinda put me off. however,  the burger meat was cooked just right and the bun just right also. the house ketchup tastes a little like pasta sauce but its good. great beer selection. we didn't like the umami cockatil because its a bit like a pickle juice cocktail. my sister had the manly burger which she said was probably one of the best bacon burgers she's ever had and i had a bite of the triple pork burger and that was also very tasty. i also recommend the umami pickles, a variety of lightly pickled veg. carrots, mushrooms, cucumber, etc.

So I was in the area and hungry as SH**.  I walk in and damn this place made mah mouf water.  The girl in front of me insisted that I try the The Port & Stilton Burger.  Im not big on blue cheese but im down with grilled onions.   I copped the The Port & Stilton Burger and it was an excellent choice.  Juicy burger very tastey...like I cant really even describe it, you just gotta try it for yourself.  I looked over to my girl to ask her how her how the socal burger was....she had her face buried in the burger and had this glow about her, i take it that was great too.  I was definitely feeling the sweet potato fries, Im for sure going to stop by umami burger again.  DELICIOUS!

i read somewhere to start with the umami burger if you are eating it for the first time then move onto triple pork burger, but i thought, WHY?? heck, i will start with the burger that i should end with, that way i get a maximum experience. it was sunday afternoon, after the gym, i was starving and craving for burger and fries, decided to check out umami. i sat at the bar area by myself and although it was around 2ish, the place was packed. i asked the waitress which one i should get since i'm trying out for the first time, UMAMI or TRIPLE PORK BURGER?? she said, well, it depends, they are very different.. she wasn't much of a help.  then i asked her which fries? i am looking for crispy fries, HAND CUT or THIN FRIES? she said, well, they're both good.. you are really NOT helping whatsoever.  have you ever eaten the food here? i order TPB and it was damn good. i am a huge fan of gourmet burgers, i often go to 8 oz., it was savory and light (i guess i want to say not heavy, but can't think of the antonym at the moment). however i RETURNED the hand cut fries because they were raw inside.  i asked the waitress if i can switch to crispy fries, after a bite i cannot eat it, she was nice enough to replace it. so what's my verdict? ORDER: triple pork burger - if you are in the mood for savory burger thin fries - if you like "crispy" fries SKIP: hand cut fries - unless you are into sort of raw potato cubes. lastly, thought that they could be more generous with ketchup, they did bring more when i asked for it, but come on, only A spoonful of ketchup with the order of fries?   i soon will be back for umami burger so my review, to be continued...

Here are my complaints: Service - Waitstaff was the worst I'd ever encountered.  3 tables around us just about had it from waiting to order w/o anyone approaching for around 7 minutes.  Yet the waiter was continuously around us.  He would take 1 empty glass and bring it to the kitchen while 2 others sat on our table.  Why wouldnt you take all 3?  Your hads are not full, except for the 1 glass.  Why did you tell us you'd come back for our order when you could have taken it along with the glasses?  Then -he went to a table that was already finished w their meal and offered to get them more water.  Is it not common sense to take an order on your way to getting that person a free water?  Ugh, moving on.  My iced tea arrived wo ice.  He said if you want ice i can get it for you.  That was another wasted 10 minutes.  When our food arrived I had to get up and get silverware for myself.  I noticed every table had someone get up and get their own silverware and napkins.  They had lots of servers running around but i swear it had to be everyones first day.  They were totally inefficient. Food- you cannot customize anything.  I found this frustrating.  That aside I ordered the Earth Burger (veggie burger.)  It was complete mush.  You didnt need to chew at all.  My boyfriend took a bite and looked at me immediately as to say - how have you been eating this? Maybe they were just having an off day.  I will not return though and I generally love this kind of place.

Right now it's a tie between the umami burger and 8 oz on melrose. Umami means some kind of delciiousness, it was a made up word or something. The burger was succulent and I've been craving the darn thing since we had it. The fries were good too. Burgers are smaller portions - very unamerican. A good thing so you don't pig out, but there's so good they seem like sliders and you want four!! The place is tiny, clean, not a ton of ambience, kinda rushed service because they were slammed both times we went, but who the hell cares, i could inhale that umami burger every day of the week!! OOOOH mami, me want anotha!

I'd heard such a racket about Umami that I was dying to try it.  We thought it was good but were not overwhelmed.  The burgers were okay and the ambiance was nice for a burger place.  The UFO dessert?  We were so excited but it was terrible.  A deep fried oatmeal raisin cookie with ice cream.  More like a deep fried undercooked mess.  As a sugar junkie, it's a sad day when I put my spoon down after two bites.

you can have burgers, and then you have umami burgers.  the different offerings of burgers on the menu are all to die for and crazy unique.  definitely a little on the heavier/greasy side of burgers, but hey, go big or go home.  Sadly this doesnt apply to the size of their offerings, as my one citicism of the place is that their burgers are a bit small for their high price tag (not sure if its to do with the richness and not wanting to overwhelm customers... probably). if you like burgers, you need to try their truffle burger.  in my opinion this should be their signature offering.

To quote my fave anime drawing posted behind the counter: AYE UMAMI !  Had the turkey burger, which was perfectly cooked and omg so flavorful.  Lady friend had the shrimp burger special, which was tasty...only prob was that the seaweed kinda stole the spotlight, which isn't exactly why one goes around eating burgers.  Sweet potato fries are on point.  No alcohol...le boo.

I ended up at Umami Burger because El Chato wasn't open yet, and it was alright.  There were quite a few people so I though I'd check it out and I got the Umami Burger and sweet potato fries.  The fries were pretty good but the burger was SO small and a little bit salty for my taste.  I really don't think it's worth the price. I know a lot of people who like this place, so I might consider coming back and trying other things but definitely not anytime soon.  It's a bit too expensive and not justified by the taste--it's overrated. Oh, and I found out that they don't serve any alcohol at this location.  So I wouldn't recommend it if that's what you're looking for.

Def a contender with my favorite burger place, Fathers Office.  I will need to eat at both places again to see which one takes the crown.  If you are a burger-loving person, you def have to try this place.   They make/design the burger and its contents and they know what they are doing.  I like places like this and Fathers Office better than those burger joints that let you design a crumby burger than turns out half as good as this place.  I shared the truffle burger and the jalepeno burger, both of which were great.  If you like spicy and jalepenos, get that one, but i would have to recommend the truffle.  I've heard the umami burger is a decent traditional burger, but I opted to try something less plain.  The resto was pretty small, but they had a sizable outdoor seating area.  the service was great and dont forget to ask about items not listed in the normal menu as we love he tator tots. The only thing I didnt like about this place was that the burgers were fairly small and I probably could have eaten 2 on my own

Two little piggies decided to take a road trip to Umami Burger on 8/14/11! I was excited upon arrival after hearing about it on the drive up with my bestie. We got there and valet because there is no parking. We ordered two truffle burgers, cheesy tots, and mashed potatoes. The waitress recommended the burgers medium rare, and boy were they good! My mouth was so happy! Everything meshed so well and the homemade ketchup was so savory. Mmmm Umami. When I'm in the mood to pay for a 12$ burger I'll be back!

Burgers are one of my favorite foods. I have tried the Umami burger, the truffle burger, and the blue cheese burger...and what do i think? I think its just aiite...sorry. I wanted to love it but honestly...nothing very special, not sure what the hype is all about. When i saw Giada on tv saying this was the best burger she ever had,..i was like.."You gotta be kidding me right?" For me, putting high end quality toppings on a burger doesn't make a burger good. Good meat and good bun cooked perfectly makes it good.

I decided to have lunch here the other day with a co-worker after hearing so much about it and the fact that it was right near work. We walked over around 1pm  dreading the lunch crowd and surprisingly there were only a few people. I can see how parking would be a problem, the lot is tiny. We both ordered the signature Umami burger and a side a fries. The jenga tower fries were amusing but like most have said not filling at all. The fries were extra thick and crunchy which was good but not worth the $3. On the other hand, the burger was delicious. It was juicy, full of flavor, and each bite had a hint of sweetness. I tried eating slow to savor the taste but that didn't happen. My next burger craving, I would definitely consider coming here again but probably just for the tasty burger itself.

Visited 5/29/2009 at 9:15 pm and it was busy.  I had the turkey burger and my friend had the Umami burger.  We had a small green salad and two orders of french fries.   The turkey burger was small and the top was dripping in the garlic aioli.  I sent it back and they quickly brought a new burger with a dab of goat cheese (less than a teaspoon).  The fries were cooked to perfection.  I wish they had salt & pepper on the tables.  Their homemade ketchup tasted like tomato sauce with agave nectar (pfst).   The Umami burger has a shitake and roasted tomato flavor that is satisfying.  My friend's complaint was that his burger was very buttery and rich.   The green salad was fresh.  It was tossed with a perfectly balanced vinaigrette.  The service was quick.  The dinning area is modern decorated with glass, metal, wood and concrete.  Any sound made indoors bounces and echos endlessly, so I recommend eating outside.   The photos show voluminous height and bigger burgers.  The actual size of the burger is smaller.  We ordered pickles and it cost $4.00.   So total cost for:  two burgers, two french fries, one salad and two glasses of tap-water came out to $36.00 without tip.

I was disappointed that I could not substitute a veggie burger or the portobello mushroom for any of the choices. The only one they would allow to be vegetarian in option is the Umami speciality burger which comes out to a portobello mushroom with a baked tomato slice on a oil greased bun.  The hamburger comes on a square white plate and is the about 4" in diameter...about the size of a 1$ burger at McDonalds. This burger costs $9.  $9!!! (only the burger) It was tasty but not it was definitely not OMG, *drool, I HAVE to come here again.  However, it was tasty. If you feel like spending more you can add drinks and some other options in appetizers or meal companions like what I ordered...fries and onion rings.  The fries were thick and were neither crispy nor soft ...they were some strange middle ground of a little crispy and kind of sandy soft...sorry I might be losing some of you here.  Anyway, not good. The onion rings are those lightly battered kind that dont completely cover the onion and DRIP with oil. I do admit the garlic aioli sauce tastes pretty good but after too much sauces I want to puke.  Not to mention the guy forgot to bring the sauce. But I guess we give him some slack because when he did bring it he gave us the mustard too. Place is small but comfortable.  Order at the counter for take out or take a seat and they will bring you a menu although there is no sign that tells you this and you might have to stand in line or stand around and be utterly confused of what to do or where to go...  Nice atmosphere. Parking lot can be for about 10 cars max shared with other stores. Too oily in general.

The original, and still the best.  Hatch burger is a must if you don't mind a little heat.  Smooshed potatoes are amazing.  Oh, and try the pickle platter - it's way doper than it sounds (i.e. beets, cauliflower, pickles, chilis..)

not that umami really needs another review... but it's soooooo good i just can't help myself by chime in to say: go try it! been twice... being vegetarian (i know... and i'm yelping about burgers?)... i ordered the umami burger with portobello instead of meat and both times were delish! it's rich, it's hearty, it's a bite that gives me the warm & fuzzies.... you get the point. love the portion size and how well the burger holds up and together until the very last bite! love the parmesan crisp... love the sundried tomato touch. ask for the specials... i would love to try the scallop or the tuna or the veggie burger. it's not on the menu so ask what's going on that day. why 4 stars? both my boyfriend and i don't get their fries & onion rings. is it the oil they use? somehow they are a bit bland... and feel... dirty even though they look fresh. the burgers were the best we've had and we just wished both times... that the sides were comparable. excellent staff & service... laid-back but attentive. great suggestions and they know their stuff. (we've only been there at 5pm before all the madness... so take it for what it's worth).

This place hit the spot! My boyfriend and I split the umami x6 and  the truffle and both were amazingly-yummy good! The burgers were very juicy and tasty! No need for any kind of condiments. The onion rings were to die for, very crispy and melts in your mouth. The portions were just perfect, will fill you up but won't make you feel like you pigged out!

We made the mistake of splitting a burger and a few sides. The burger was delish but the sides were a little disappointing. Though it had a nice miso dressing, a bunch of greens does not a salad make especially for $4. They should go to Trader Joe's and buy a bag-o-salad if they don't want to do the work. The couscous salad was a bit bland but ok.  We were pleased with the burger but wished we had each ordered one as it was a tiny bit tiny. The onion ring order had a nice tempura like batter, and they were a pretty good deal at $2.50 for about 5. Cool set-up inside, tables outside if you don't mind sucking down exhaust from cars on La Brea expressway. Parking is a disaster. Ride your bike if possible.

Don't go out to the westside very often, but was in the area and on the way home, stopped for lunch at Umami Burger on a friend's recommendation, who said this was his favorite burger joint.  I am still looking for the best burger in Los Angeles, and so far don't have a definite winner.  I enjoy burgers at The Counter and Apple Pan and the burger at Father's Office IMHO was good, but not great.  Many I'm sure would disagree.   We got there about 2:40pm this afternoon(Sat), and still had to wait about 20 minutes for tables to clear.  At a little after 3pm, people weren't really having to wait.   I had the Umami Burger and my girlfriend had the Truffle Burger.  We split an order of Onion Rings and French Fries, and tried the ketchup and the aioli.  I had a bite of hers and she had a bite of mine and we agreed that the Umami Burger was a little better than the Truffle Burger.   I preferred the french fries and the garlic aioli was good, but my girlfriend liked the onion rings more.  The burgers were good and the buns are great, just the right amount of softness and the burgers were holding up well, not falling apart.  I had a Coke and they served the bottle with a small glass.  The Coke was from Mexico and had that different taste to it, which was weird. Typical price point for a LA place, about $35 for the meal(with tip).  I enjoyed the lunch, but couldn't see driving out there again to try another burger.  If I lived in the area, I would probably eat there a couple times a year, but the lack of alcohol is also a bummer. Worth a try, but the search will continue.

I was served a completely raw in the middle turkey burger. That's right.  cold to the touch. I took one bite and spit it out. Shocked and disgusted. Thank God it was my burger that was the raw one and not the one served to my 6 year old daughter who would have eaten it not knowing how dangerous and disgusting a RAW turkey burger is and could have had salmonella poisoning or God knows what else. The waiter, who originally was completely indifferent to us,  (Stating during ordering when I asked about substituting a turkey patty for beef, that "We work on the philosophy of subtraction here, not substitution". Translated- they'll take stuff off the burger but not change it in any other way)  was suddenly very alert and quite horrified. Stuttering his apologies.  He brought me a new one - overcooked to the point of being inedible and didn't charge me for it. Um. Yeah. Brought about ten extra servings of ketchup- which is literally a tablespoon each and you are normally charged for any extra that is requested.  See the photo with the ketchup in a japanese soup spoon? That's the entire serving size. Also tastes really weird. Just leave ketchup alone for God's sake. He also brought out a huge plate of cookies and ice cream sandwiches  for free to make up for the burger. He tried his best. My husbands burger was dry and despite all of the supposed ingredients had no flavor. The onion rings were dripping with grease.  The french fries were good. The bill was still $32 even though mine was free and the desserts were free as well.  All three of us had a stomach ache for hours after we got home and my daughter had diarrhea. A trip to the doctor the next day confirmed that it was likely her burger wasn't cooked enough even though it seemed ok by sight. Horrid. Horrid experience.

For the size of the burger and the price...i don't think it really goes hand in hand, but the truffle burger does taste delicious, but I don't know if it's really worth 12 dollars.  It's a little steep in my eyes, but at least I tried it once :)

Umami burger is the best burger place ive been to my boyfriend heard really great reviews for this place so we went and tried it because we are always on the hunt for great restaurants ... and so we went and the first thought was man this burger is small.. but then when we took the first bite it was just a burst of flavorful juices that just trickled down and it was a truly magical experience magical because it was just that good and also magical because of the fact that we were both full after... if you want to try a fantabulous gourmet burger you should def. try Umami YUM!

3.5 for food, rounded up to 4 for quick service. I'm not a big burger eater to begin with but the concept of umami was intriguing enough to join 6 other people and wait outside on a cold LA night for 40 minutes.  The restaurant is SMALL but it doesn't take people long to finish off the smallish burger and serving of fries.   Most of got the Umami as described so often before.  I like my burgers a little more pink than red but surprisingly the meat tasted great with a nice outer char.  The flavors of the parmesan crisp, mushrooms, onions were delicious.  My only complaint was the super soggy bun that didn't hold up too well after a few bites.   Sides: onion rings were amazing so I heard.  Sweet pot fries were eh.  Thin cut good.   Desserts: cake monkey ho ho was teensy tiny.  Root beer float looked good.   Summary: Not sure if it's worth $13 for this meal but I'm glad I tried it once.

It's easy to admire what they're aspiring to at Umami Burger. What's more difficult to applaud are the results. Putting aside the mildly annoying feeling of faddishness with the whole umami movement of the moment, this place is a perfect representation of what happens when someone with aspirations attempts to "elevate" a perfectly good standard food while managing to shoot so far beyond the simple fundamentals that make the original wonderful, it simply becomes a pretentious mess. Seriously, no Wrap ever exceeded (or even truly matched) the simple perfection of a carnitas burrito. Beer aged in wine barrels, mixed with fruit, might make for some interesting quaffage, but in no way satisfies as immediately and gratifyingly as a well made stout. This isn't to say stick with the basics and innovation be damned. For while it's demonstrably possible to spin out interesting and tasty variations over Kraft, there comes a point where cramming too many ultra rich cheeses, lobster, truffles, sichuan peppercorns and god knows what else into the dish doesn't transfigure Macaroni & Cheese, it disfigures it. Or becomes something else entirely. Burgers seem particularly susceptible to these grandiose designs. Which brings us back to La Brea Boulevard. We're told this is amazing. I hoped to experience a savory delight to put every other burger ever eaten, whether a four dollar SoCal walk up basic or a Spotted Pig caliber pub burger masterpiece, in cowering reverence. But here's how it went repeatedly: The first bite's a curiosity; for the most part in a good way. Flavors are coming together, but it's tough to sort them out in that first chew or two, because they're generally not ones you've had together before. At least not like this. (The burger begins annoyingly to fall apart at this point, as the bulbous, stacked umami delivering ingredients begin to topple and slide different directions while the brioche bun disintegrates gooily under too much liquid. Fun.) At bites two and three, a bit of confusion sets in. Some us begin thinking, Am I Actually Enjoying What I'm Tasting? Which is odd, because everything is something you'd like individually, just perhaps not all at the same time. (A friend tapped for a third and final trip not only didn't finish but actually proclaimed faint nausea after, though that may simply have been a matter of palate cleansing. A couple rapidly drunk pints at Village Idiot a short time later seemed to clear up the problem.) Despite all this, the burger isn't horrible; just sloppy, over reaching, and simply not appealing, apparently, to at least some of us. (Perhaps more than care to admit.) Beyond the Umami, the SoCal burger is an uninspiring and overdone version of the In N Out Southern California style. A Wrap version, for sure. Hit In N Out and be happier for it. The Hatch sounds promising, but at this rate, I'll probably never find out. Anyway, some people clearly love this place (see the fawning, nay, fellating, and decidedly prolix review at A Hamburger Today, for example). Probably best to go and make your own call. (As in all things.) But don't say you haven't been warned. ;)

One of the best burgers I've had by far! This place is pretty small but it's nice for a night of romantic burger scarfing. There is no alcohol here though. Something to do with having only one restroom. There, you might've just learned something new. The Umami burger is really good. Hell, all their burgers are good. They're very flavorful and you can pick out the tastes of each ingredient. It's not the average burger place by any means. You have to try it to believe it.

I was taking a bunch of friends from NYC around town and trying to show them some good food. First thing first we hit up In-N-Out right after the airport and then again a day or two later. By any measure of burger consumption we were approaching saturation but everyone was still happy as hell coming out of Umami. I think this is just the place to go though once you're tired of standard burgers. It's just different enough to be fresh and new. I've had the Umami which I stand by, the Triple Pork which I found not to live up to the idea, and was told by my vegetarian friend that the Earth burger was the best veggie burger she's ever had hands down.

As far as restaurant burgers go -- these are the best. While I still may prefer my In-N-Out, these burgers have a unique flavor and quality ingredients which make them well worth the occasional splurge. I tend to stick to the SoCal Burger, but their variety of options makes this place a fun one to visit. My only complaint is on the soda front. I wanted a diet coke with my burger (because who wouldn't want soda?) and was disappointed by the $3 price tag, but even MORE disappointed by the fact that they gave me a tiny 8oz bottle that couldn't have had more than three sips. I feel like if they're going to give that little soda for that much money they could at least have the courtesy to warn their customers. Frankly, a beer would have been cheaper and more enjoyable. Still though the food is good...

Food is great! I ordered the truffle burger and sweet potato fries and both were delicious. Service was great as well. BUT... The portions are small (perfect for me bc I don't eat much but won't fill up guys for sure), they need to keep a bottle of ketchup at the table, and as yummy as the burger was it literally only had the patty and cheese on it. Will def go back to try other burgers tho!

As i continue my quest in search of the perfect burger, or at least one that surpasses the harmonious lusciousness that is the Double Double, we were suggested this place from a number of sources. With four hungry diners, with a healthy buzz flowing, we were quickly seated and the sequence of basic service began.  Straight forward, our orders were taken, with us ordering The Hatch, Signature Umami, and the Triple Pork burgers, with sweet potato & thick cut fries, and onion rings. Let's just say these are different from your average burger.  Can't be compared with the simplicity of In n Out, but these deserve recognition in their own right.  All the beef patties were cooked perfectly with a nice crust on the outside with juicy pink/red interiors.  The Umami burger in particular was more robust than the other burgers in my opinion.  Maybe it was the earthiness of the shitake mushrooms that put it over the top.  My least favorite of the evening was the Triple Pork burger.  Understandably, any processed, raw pork product must be cooked to a higher temp than its beefy compadre.  Having said that, the pork patty was nicely crusty on the outside, but equally dry on the inside.  Not my favorite component to sacrifice when constructing a burger.  Sweet potato fries were okay, with an unusual topping...cinnamon sugar.  I didn't really understand that.  The thick cut fries were another tragedy.  Lightly brown on the exterior, almost baked potato-like in the center....oh and did i mention that they're about a 1/2 inch thick!  IMHO, the crunch can't hold up to the pastiness of the interior mash.  But it seems like a bunch of people like it, so who am i to say anything. I'd come back, suggest it, but it's definitely not on my best burger list.  As a matter of fact, it didn't exceed my expectations.  Maybe it was the hype surrounding it.  IMO, In n Out still takes the cake, with Haven Gastropub in Orange, and Butterfly in SF as my next closest contenders.

There's been a lot talk of Umami Burger, but I was a bit skeptical since I grew up on In-N-Out and have revered them as king of all burgers. However, since we were heading to over to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, we decided to stop by for lunch. Umami was a small joint but felt spacious with their floor to ceiling windows. One look and you can tell that it was definitely not a typical fast food joint, but much closer to a traditional sit down restaurant. Every burger on the menu sounded delicious, so it was pretty hard picking which one to order. I ended up ordering the Umami Burger and my other half ordered the Truffle Burger. The sweet potatoes fries that we ordered was passing. But their home brew ketchup made up for it with its zingy taste. Our mouths were already watering when they brought out our burgers. One bite into my Umami Burger and I already knew that this was truly a gourmet burger. After a second bite, I was convinced that this Umami Burger has surpassed In-N-Out. At this point, I was already satisfied with my meal, but we decided to swap burgers, just to try what the other was eating. BLISS! I didn't think it could get any better than my Umami Burger, but her Truffle Burger was on a whole different level. If the Umami Burger was a gourmet burger, than this Truffle Burger was definitely an artisan burger and show be considered as a masterpiece. It's beauty lie in its simpleness. It just a bun and patty with truffle cheese and truffle glaze. By the time I finish, my mouth was in a state of euphoria. We were tempted to order another, but ended up order dessert instead. Their ice cream sandwich was very sweet and helped end our meal. Go to Umami Burger and try the Umami Burger, but don't order the Truffle Burger until you try everything else first. Otherwise, it will spoil your taste buds and make everything seem pale in comparison. Don't get me wrong, it's to die for, but just don't say I didn't warn you. http://lwehttam.wordpres…

If you're going to advertise that your beef is ground in-house and served medium rare on the menu, you should be able to deliver. We had 4 beef burgers at our table and not one was medium rare, all were cooked way well done. The grind is nice and coarse, and the burgers are packed loosely as they should be, but the inability to cook them to the proper temp is a glaring error. The umami schtick isn't really my thing either, but if you're a fan then hey, enjoy.

I wanted to like this restaurant, I swear!  I had heard about it because I frequently travel to LA, and I also heard there were going to be three moving into the area I live near (bay area, CA).   I went with three other people.  First off, the wait was much longer than the ten minutes we were told.  More like thirty. Not a huge deal, but they need to be a little more realistic next time. We sat and ordered three appetizers: the pickled vegetables, the fried mashed potatoes, and the onion rings.  The pickled vegetables were fun to taste, but not especially great.  The mashed potatoes were amazing and stand out as the best thing at the restaurant.  And the onion rings just didn't have lot of flavor and weren't special. I ordered the Umami Burger, and the other ordered burgers too.  It took much longer than it should've for our burgers to arrive.  One of our party ordered the vegetarian option accidentally, and sent it back.   The burger was just disappointing.  It was overly sweet first off.  The bread is sweet, the meat is sweet, and then there' not enough sour from the cheese to balance it.  Plus it has all of one tomato, no lettuce, and no mustard. The ketchup, Umami ketchup, is pretty tasteless too, not the taste that even Heinz has. It was thoroughly unremarkeable.  Bland and sweet, and very small for the high price and long time it took to make.  I like that they are doing things in a new way, and I could see if maybe I liked sweet things, but it was just not good enough for me. Sorry!

Quick Tip: Get the Truffle or Hatch Burger... THE BEST! On my first visit, I tried the Umami Burger and it was good! Meat is marinated with glory and cooked to perfection. On my second visit, I was determined to try something else, so I tried the Hatch Burger, EVEN BETTER! Less things going on, more simply but with a spicy kick. (Not too spicy). On my third visit, I was inclined to eat my safety foods. But then I thought, maybe there's another burger that's even better. I asked our server and we were recommended the Truffle Burger. To me, this burger stands out the most! Super awesome. Everytime I go back, I vow to try something different, but I always end up saying this order. =/ Be sure to ask for the specials! Sometimes they have secret menu items that only exist that same day!

There is no reason to go anywhere else for a burger! These burgers are juicy and delicious. I have tried a few different versions, even the turkey burger, and they are all great. I think my favorite is the Umami burger which comes with sauteed mushrooms, their special ketchup, a Parmesan crisp and a roasted tomato. The buns are a bit sweet in a good way. My husband loves the hatch burger, which has green chilies for a little kick. The truffle and so-cal burgers are also great. For sides I've tried the sweet potato fries which are good but not the best I've had, the onion rings which are a bit too greasy for my taste and the thin fries which are great. The last time we went the service was a bit slow (and we waited 20 minutes to be seated at 8pm on a Monday night!) but the burger made up for it!

3.75 * cant give it a 4. the service is really slow. prob because its new. and there were a billion people there. to get table service the wait wouldve been 45mins. but we opted to just get it to-go and eat it at the tables outside. there is no table service for the outside tables but we were welcomed to eat our to-go orders there. the umami burger ($8) was good. very light tasting. (w greasy bun, though) no greens. just tomato, mushroom, sauce, caramelized onions. and cheese. the cheese looked and tasted like grated cheese that was melted and peeled off your fry pan.  it was different. the servers were really friendly. the garlic potato salad was good.   the fries were also good, all  8 pieces (3$.) the ketchup tasted like a light marinara. they also have dessert. i got the raspberry red velvet cakewich. it looks like a dingdong.

Are their burger supposed to be super raw? cause mine was dripping .... With the combination of the things on the burger it should've super good butttt it was just ...eh.... I put a quick live cam feed and pictures on my website http://www.Raysonesquejo…  (shameless plug) but if it were up to me i would've went to fuddruckers. Tasty onion rings... i wish there were more than four though... the fries weren't that good in quantity for the price. It's another one of those places that is good but not that good for the price plus the now 9.25% of tax we here in Los Angeles pay =/.

I've been to Umami several times, needless to say that I truly like the burgers there (here, since I am writing this review while waiting to order), so back on the main subject; I come for the burgers and that is about it. The truffle burger to be more specific, bloody and juicy! On the other side, there are some pretty bad "details" which I happen to find quite annoying and of terrible taste. Shall we clarify them? First the table service lags and drags, the guy who runs the place seem to believe that good customer service has gone out of style, he is rude to the bone! So that is it! There u have. Good burgers, the rest... Meh!

Fresh, affordable (cheaper than Lucky Devil's), and delicious. The burgers are a little on the small side, and the french fries, while fresh and hand cut, were nothing to rave about. Nevertheless, the burgers tasted wonderful: strong, bold, decisive flavors.  The meal was filling with a side (a la carte). The service is speedy and affable. The decor is contemporary, crisp and minimalist: dark wood floors, tables, and chairs against decorative wooden, rock and cream-colored walls. Good for dates, friends.

The Umami Burger was outrageously good! The kind of burger you drive a long way for, if need be. Juicy, succulent. And, the bun is kinda like a Hawaiian sweet roll. The combination is so satisfying. One of the top 5 burgers in LA. It's basically just a hamburger joint, with nice, clean, modern inside seating. Don't expect 5 star service; but, it's a burger joint, right? Why 4/5: Fries are boring steak fries, extra condiments cost, and no beer with which to wash burgers down. Will definitely go back!

The burgers are superb -- and beyond that it's all about the house-made pickles (a must have) and the great iced tea.  Occasionally the service can be off, but usually it's wonderful.  I only wish they took reseravations!

The burgers are definitely interesting in terms of the ingredients used but at the same time it didn't necessarily blow me away in terms of taste. I had the truffle burger with the pattie perfectly cooked, plenty of juices, however the portion was ridiculously small. In addition I was not a fan of the bun which had a sweet white bread type taste to it. The fries, while high minded, missed the mark and the onion rings were nothing special. The cost was high and would rather drop my money at Father's Office or The Counter given the choice. With all that said it was still far better made than half the garbage that serves as a burger in this city.

Wow, these guys are on to something huge. The LaBrea place is small place, tables can be hard to come by, park on the street to save the valet. But if you like burgers, there is not a better one being made right now. Also where elce can you get a lamb or a pork burgers made fresh. Go for the skinny fries, skip the onion rings.

I'm so glad that I'm not the only person who feels that Umami leaves a lot to be desired. I knew some of my fellow Yelpers would have my back. My boyfriend likes to venture all around LA with his guy friends and try out every new hip burger joint to see what all the fuss is about. He's been to pretty much every cool burger place in town and recommended that we go to Umami for dinner tonight since I'm always interested in trying the places he so often talks about. First of all the place has 0 ambiance. Granted, it is a burger joint, so I can deal with tables crowded together and bright lighting, but someone could or should have consulted an interior designer or something. The tables in the main TINY little dining room were so close together that people were practically dining shoulder to shoulder with strangers at the next table. Very awkward attempt at some sort of forced communal atmosphere. Weird. Then there's another tiny weird room at the rear of the restaurant with a countertop across all three walls of the room and a table for two placed in the middle (where we were seated). The seats at the counter were also highly awkward, as diners are forced to essentially stare at the wall while they eat and must labor to make eye contact or converse with the rest of their party. I dont know about you guys, but when I go out to dinner with someone or multiple people, I like to be able to look them in the face and have a normal conversation. The table where we sat was placed in the middle of this weird room and we felt like we were center stage but with the audiences back to us. I repeat, it was SUPER WEIRD. My advice, spend some bucks and hire a contractor to knock out the weird walls in there and a restaurant designer to design a new seating plan. STAT. Moving on to the actual food... I ordered the Umami burger minus the mushrooms and the BF ordered the Hatch burger minus the cheese. Other Yelpers have pointed out the weird "we'll remove stuff but not substitute stuff" rule,which did not please me. I am of the opinion that if I want my food a certain way, and I'm paying your ass to make it for me, you should just listen to me. Call me crazy. We also ordered skinny fries and onion rings. The vintage soft drinks in a bottle we're a cute touch but I originally wanted a root beer float, which they were out of....? Like, you didn't stock enough root beer or ice cream...when it's on the menu...? Someone didn't do their job. Here's the bottom line - My burger was pretty much dog food. The patty was in pieces when it arrived at the table, so it wasnt really a patty at all, rather more like a sloppy joe. It was like my patty had fallen on the floor and crumbled to pieces and was re-assembled on the bun and covered with a parmesan crisp to hide its disfigurement. It was also basically raw. Not tasty. So I tried my hardest to be polite and not show my distaste for the situation on my plate but it was impossible. I ate around the edges of the burger because that was the only part that was cooked enough to eat, and the rest basically disintegrated into slop on my plate. The fries were good. Seriously though, how hard is it to fry potatoes? Not hard. Onion rings were not good. Too greasy and lacked seasoning. These people dont even provide salt or pepper for the table. The BF's burger was good and was obviously more cooked than mine and held up nicely. He was bummed about my dissatisfaction so when the waitress came to ask how we were doing he pointed to my plate and said that it was unacceptable. She looked at me for more information and I plainly told her that it looked like dog food on my plate and the longer I had to look at it the more I wanted to vomit. I asked her if she would eat it and she couldnt even answer my question. She responded with an obviously rehearsed response like, "all our burgers are cooked medium rare...so..." NOT medium rare. NOT edible. DOESNT MATTER what the policy is on cooking the meat. BOTTOM LINE - I didnt like it, dont want to pay for it, and want to punch the chef in the face and vomit simultaneously. She couldnt even look me in the eye. So she offered a half-assed attempt at fixing the situation by offering us free ice cream sandwiches. They were delicious. Coffee toffee ice cream sandwiched in between two larger than usual french style coffee macarons. So basically, I ate french fries and ice cream for dinner and my lovely lover still had to fork over $35+ for the meal. NOT KOSHER. Oh, and this supposedly super secret amazing Umami ketchup is freaking weird. These people have major balls, obviously. Like, dont mess with ketchup, first of all. Second of all, just cook your hamburgers like every other restaurant that has to obey the health department. If I wanted steak tartare I would have asked for it. Lastly, the chef needs to leave the ego at the door and recognize that the customer is always right, they know what they like, and what tastes good to them. The end.

Some of my friends rave about this burger joint. So on a Girls' Weekend, Jillian B. and I spent a day in LA and started it off with lunch at Umami Burger. 1. Parking - It is difficult to find free street parking. They do offer valet for $2.50, but the funny part about this, the next driveway (which is literally footsteps away) offers $2 valet parking. 2. Ambiance - Cute. It was a beautiful day on Saturday. We were seated in the patio area. 3. Customer Service - The host was friendly. Instead of us having to look where the host is, he came up to us right away to get our names and handed us menus to look over while we waited 10 minutes for our table. As for our table service, I must say it was slow. Another couple seated after us got their food before us. We even had to remind the server about our condiments. It really didn't seem busy in the patio area, I just don't understand why it took so long to get our food, condiments and refills on our waters. The thing that came the quickest was the check at the end of our meal. 4. Food - The first that comes to mind was how oily/greasy everything was. Our table ordered thick cut fries, onion rings, Manly Burger (for me), and the pulled pork chorizo one (for Jill). The food portions were just right for the not-so-heavy-I'm-so-full-and-I-can't-walk-I-wanna-­take-a-nap feel. So for those who like the big 'ol hearty burger meals, this isn't the place for you. The fries were nothing special. The onion rings were pleasantly good and greasy. The food was greasy enough that you can see it glistening in the sunlight. As for the burgers, it felt like they brushed oil on top of the buns, but they tasted good. The Manly Burger had cheese and bacon, and the other one had pulled pork, manchego cheese, and chorizo. Jill said it was good. As for their condiments, which the the server raved is all made from scratch at the restuarant, they were very blah. Their ketchup was like marinara sauce seasoned with fish sauce. Give me a bottle of Heinz and I would have been much happier. Their garlic aoli, mayonnaise and garlic and call it a day. Yeah, nothing special. If anything, I guess the positive side to this place is quality of their ingredients they use because that's apparent in their burgers. 5. Cost - Burgers only range from $9-$11, and sides range from $2-$4. For the quality of the burgers, it's worth it. Overall, I can't get past the greasiness of everything including the bun. I'm at the border whether I'd come back or not.

Came in here for takeout since we're all not hungry, but decided to stay because we're paying for valet anyways. We seiously came in after a lunch at the Petrossian, then Crepes at the farmer's market. We seiously did maybe an hour stroll at the grove and went straight here. The food was soo good that we actually finished the burgers and sides. The fries and onion rings are actually the highlight of this meal for me. I heart fried foods. The fries were triple fired. But, the onion rings... it felt like your eating pork rinds. It was crunchy fried goodness!

One of the best burgers i've had in a while. The umami burger was juicy slightly bloody  & rare just the way I like em! The thing  Ii loved about this burger was it was complex but still like homecooked in a way?, it took on different notes as a made my way threw it, the Parmesean crisp hits you in one bite, then you get the tangyness from the tomatoes in the next bite, it developed till it was gone in my stomach. I'm going to try every burger on the menu and update each time lol you can quote me on this!!

the first time I wanted to eat at Umami Burger, there was no parking. second time, it was closed (at 11:30am, weird). last night, i really wanted to try it, so i did the best thing I could thing of : order for take out. I was famished anyway and needed it ASAP. Ordered the Umami Burger, which is quite tasty - i don't have anything to compare it with because its not the same as most burgers. i tried to savor it (as my friend advised) but i was too hungry. i did like it, so for sure i'll be back. and i do want to try the truffle burger. btw, WIN for having LAMill coffee.

Still oh-so-good burger!  Meat is juicy and there's something unique about the sauce/parmesan crisp/bun/burger!  Yummy! this time, we got onion rings and they had a special sweet potato fries side.  i prefer FO's sweet potato fries but i definitely prefer Umami's burger over FO's!  Burger is now $10...boo inflation. Still..DELICIOUS!

This was definitely a splurge. $10 for a hamburger is normal for L.A. i just wish that it was all that. I ordered the Umami Burger with triple-fried fries and panko breaded onion rings. I was overwhelmed by flavors and walked out of there stuffed from fat and grease! The burger itself was flavored well, but the added savory sauces, the crisp waffle cheese and tomato were not very tasty. I kept saying there are like 32 flavors on this. Too much? However, the portabello mushroom was really good on it. UB was worth going once- an L.A. original, but on the scale of umami, it was only a 2 for me. Will never pay $30 for burger, fries, and a coke (a Mexican coke $3.0) again for two unless it is fantastic!

I probably like Golden State better, but, for me, Umami beats Father's Office and is definitely in my top 5!

today i was in the mood for a tasty burger... so after some precursory research (by this i mean i googled it), i decided on umami on la brea.  i was sold on their menu and i live for red meat so there i was. i walked in and immediately realized i was in an LA kinda joint.  the lone couple in the place stopped mid-bite and gave me the up and down once over.  i was taken aback at first, but then realized that i was way finer than that broad (no seriously) and that accounted for the stares. but i digress....the point is THOSE kind of people are going to be there, be prepared for that.  no...not ugly people...the self-conscious/overly self-absorbed type. kind of like me, but with bad manners. and then there was meat... i had already decided on the truffle burger after looking at the menu, so i wasted no time ordering from the friendly wait staff.  i ordered fries to go with the  burger, which brings me to one of the drawbacks...nothing comes with the burger, so you have to order a la cart.  and fries are like four dollars.  the fact that they are encrusted with sea salt (in a good way) doesn't quite make up for that. the place quickly filled up while i was eating and all i can really say is...that was a tasty burger.  i would definitely go back.  especially if someone else was paying the tab... all in all...if you don't mind eating your super delicious burger while being looked down on by a 20 year old kid who rolled up in a benz wearing a malcom x shirt and diamond studs that his parents gave him for  his super sweet 16...the get to umami by any means necessary.

It's a cute little place with a nice patio. They even put up lights to make it look a bit nicer since the view itself is ok. The sandwiches are delicious. The pork belly is fatty, yummy. The original Umami burger is also worth a shot. $3 for a small basket of triple fried fries isn't worth it. When I first went there when Umami first opened, I only got 9 fries, I wasn't happy. Now though, they do give you more than that, but it still isn't worth it. They also have real soda made of sugar cane and Scoops ice cream. I only go back for the burgers, because those are yummy. Oh yea, if you go late, keep in mind that they stop seating at 945pm (although it closes at 10pm). But, if they already have a line, seating might end earlier.

I've heard, for a while now, of the Umami Burger.  People have said many a good thing regarding the bun, but I'm not really a bread person.  The top bun was a fluffy and delightful as they say, the bottom bun soaked up the burger quite nicely, but it was what was in the middle that stole the show.  I had the Hatch burger, green chiles and cheese, and, in the words of Sammy Jackson in Pulp Fiction, this is a tasty burger!  Now, the Father's Office is officially my favorite hamburger in all of LA, but this is a close second.  It's cooked to a perfect pink, you don't have any excess cheese or accoutrements (i.e. nothing is really sliding off your burger as you bite in), the bun is delicious but not intrusive or distracting.  My dining partner had the port and stilton, and she wholeheartedly gives it the thumbs up!  We split an order of sweet potato fries, and by the end of the meal I was stuffed. There is valet, or parking across on the west side of La Brea in the residential, beware of the permit only parking in the residential neighborhood on the east side of the street.  The patron saint of parking spaces was on my side, and we scored one just across the street.  We went on a Tuesday after work though, parking will only get worse as the night wears on.  Weekends are probably horrible.  I hate parking in LA.

the order. all natural basic burger (no condiments or cheese) tempura onion rings i'd give this burger a 3.5 star overall but a potential of 4 solid stars; the meat patty is quite delicious and cooked perfect medium. however i wish the burger as a whole wasn't so greasy; the bun was overly buttered up for one my other gripes were that the onion rings were too oily as well and the umami ketchup tasted more like marinara sauce. the burger can easily be a solid four star if their definition of umami wasn't equated to greasy but rather truly savory. i'd come to this place over 25 degrees (if that helps anyone); then again im not a hard core sirloin lover.

I think it's an LA experience, not just a meal. I had the Manly Burger and it was really juicy and yummy. It tastes a little more gamey than a normal burger, and I liked it. The sweet potato fries and salads were also good. I got the ice cream sandwich, which I didn't like. The sandwich tasted like macaroons- good idea in theory but I just wanted a normal ice cream sandwich. It's a cute atmosphere and hip restaurant. We saw Jack Black while my friends and I were there.

The burgers are the juiciest of juicy medium rare.  Fries are sub par.  House ketchup is different in a good way.  I had the umami burger and it was devoured in six bites; used the bit of bread left to soak up the burger juices; far more acceptable than licking the plate.  I will come back and try their other burgers and the sweet potato fries.

If you're looking for a different kind of burger, a gourmet burger, an UNAMI burger is a thing of beauty. Deliciously cooked (though they tend to go on the rarer side), fresh, tasty bun, and only a small number of burgers make for an excellent lunch or dinner. They do tend to get busy on the weekends, but well worth the wait.

there's limited street parking so i had to valet. there's also very limited seating, which means a long wait. i ordered the umami burger. it was only ok. at first glance, it looks pretty small and doesn't come with a side, so i was thinking i needed to get a second dinner afterward. but, it was deceivingly filling. too bad the best parts of the meal were the coffee and dessert. the coffee is from lamill (silverlake) and their dessert was from milk (near the beverly center).

I wish I could take an Umami burger patti, strip it down and rub it all over my genitals, but it would totally waste what amounts to be a freaking FABULOUS burger.  The name of the place is clever, repping the "5th taste receptor".  Umami is the flavor you get from MSG, but without all the health concerns.  I scarfed down a truffle burger, waited a few minutes to see if I would get dizzy from a chemical overdose, realized I was okay, then ordered another one.  The cheezy tots are a throwback to my childhood and a gateway to obesity, and the onion rings are also shit.  Umami FTW!

Ok so the first few times I hit this place it was as amazing as everyone said but sadly the last two times it was just straight up ickers! It's like quality control suddenly went out the window :( First, both my last to-go orders were missing eats, which sucks since I live way too far to have them do anything about it. Second, both orders were dripping in grease, so much so that everyone had to remove the bread from their burgers because they were 100% saturated. Lastly, each of the last orders had burgers severely underdone. Now, I know they like to serve them medium-rare which has been super yummers but I kid you not my last two orders each contained burgers so undercooked they were inedible. One bad order I'd just consider a fluke, but two bad orders makes me think Umami has gotten too busy to keep the quality where it should be which makes me sad because when done right they make the best freaking burgers ever. *Please note this review is just for the La Brea location as I haven't had a chance to hit the new valley Umami that just opened in my hood.

I loved the Umami burger and honestly thought it rivaled Shake Shack's burger in NYC. I'm lucky that this is vacation food, because my waistline would be expanding if this place existed in Houston. Very yummy, highly recommend :)

Let's let memory be a good helping factor. As in... I ate Father's Office (for the 2nd time ever) and now 5 days later I had Umami (for the 2nd time ever). Simply put: Umami trumps Father's Office. - Cheaper (burgers and fries) - No open seating (HATE that about F.O.!!) - More burger options - More flexible hours - You don't have to prove you are old enough to eat a burger (F.O. checks I.D.) - and most importantly, MORE DELICIOUSER. Note: I remembered loving the buns. I was sooo right. 2nd time around just as good. Truffle burger - My fav. Freakin' tasty as a mother. Yes, a little bit small, but so so flavorful. Manly burger - Love that the bacon is 1/2" x 1/2" cubes. Somethin' different! Lil' sweetness to this bad boy. YUMS. Umami burger - If you couldn't tell by the pattern, yep... this one tastes good too. And the cheese is cool! Sweet potato fries - Good. But IMO, almost everywheres' sweet tatuh fries are pretty similar... Thin cut fries - not sure if it's worth the money. Good, but nothing special. Onion rings - pretty unique onion rings! None of that skinny, thinly sliced onion stuff. Batter is very light, so it's fluffy/airy. Still has excellent crispness without being too crunchy. Your heart may hurt after just a couple though. Thems is some oily rings. Love the variety of condiments! The uh-ohs: - Sorry you alcoholics that need a lil somethin' somethin' for EVERY meal. - Parking... a teeny bit tricky 'cause it's on a busy street that has gridlock hours during dinner time. If you don't want to pay valet, park a couple blocks into the residential area. As per usual, check the parking signs! - Food takes a lil' time to come out. And by lil' I mean it takes time for them to put all that happiness into a burger. Add'l notes: - Lunch not too busy - Monday 6:14 pm, we got seated right away, but more and more people did start getting there afterwards. - Seedbombs outside. Cool. Umami's got game.

I came here a couple times and I still don't see what the big deal is.  The burgers are good but they're not "to die for."  I've tried the truffle and umami burgers and of the two, I liked the original better.  But the burger sizes are tiny, so be warned!   On the other hand, I really like the inside/decor!  And I think it's really cute that they brand their logo on everything, including the buns!

I liked Umami, but didn't love it. I'm not even sure why. I had the namesake burger, and it was moist and nicely spiced, but maybe there were just too many toppings going on?? I dunno, next time, I'll be a purist, and try a stripped down version. Or maybe I'll just try In-N-Out instead.

Made the drive from San Diego to LA just to try this place out and yes it was worth it.  Since we wanted to maximize our experience my BF got the Umami burger and I tried the truffle burger.  Although my burger was not bad I was definitely regretting not getting my own Umami burger it was just that much better.  Their onion rings were also very delish.  Wouldn't hesitate to make the drive again, but this time i'll make sure to get my own Umami burger :D

I have to say the burgers are good, but not great. For the price you pay for the burgers, I actually think they're overvalued. If the price of these burgers was about 50% less, I think I'd like this place a lot more. The burgers are similar in size to In N Out. I like the Counter more than this place. Personally, if you gave me a choice, I'd probably pick the In N Out burgers over this place mainly because of cost.

Man, I'd give this place 5 stars, but I've only had the opportunity to eat there once. My pal Kiya from Self Edge took us there after a hard night at the Rose Bowl Flea Market. We tried several of the sides and I ordered the Manly Burger. I thought it looked a little small, but it definitely quenched my appetite. All the other diners at our table had a burger with pastrami on it....I tried and loved too! Can't wait to come back for a second try!

this place is pretty hard to find, its kind of small and the sign is the outline of a burger that sorta looks like lips its pretty new place, and its restaurant setup - one thing i wish was that the burgers were like to go, not like restaurant style where you sit down and order from a menu - the waiter was kind of an ass to us, but whatever im rating the food i ordered the umami burger tasted very good, sorta messy when eating but very savory, yummy, worth it, i wish they wrapped the burger in paper tho haha - my brother ordered the truffle burger, which i gotta admit was very damn delicious, i would probably order that next time, its like 3 more bucks you can get fries, sweet potato chips, and onion rings i dont really recommend any, they dont give much portion of these and they dont taste too good the onion rings are soo damn greasy, just taste alright, nothing great i recommend the place tho if you've never tried, if you're sick of the usual burger joint and want a quality burger, this is the place for you get the umami or the truffle burger~

This place definitely has that casual, neighborhood feel, and you get the impression that if you came to eat more than once or twice, the staff would begin to greet you by name. They back up that comfortable feel with excellent cuisine. The burgers are, quite simply put, scrumptious. And their assortment of drinks (including a selection of root beers) is quite fun. The $2 fries that you can count to nine? Really tasty -- crisp on the outside and soft inside, and just the right thickness and saltiness. But $2 worth of tastiness? Probably not. The $3 spattering of sweet potato chips is no improvement (although they have a nice crunch and cinnamony burst to them). Does that mean you should miss out on one of the best burgers in town? Heck no! Indulge in a burger and wash it down with a beverage -- you didn't need those fried sides anyway.

Wow!  Our burgers were so good that we skipped dessert and shared the Truffle Burger. Loved the BYOB and easy-going service. I'll be back to try the rest of the menu.   I agree that the quantity of fries and onion rings left you wanting more, but the quality was outstanding. I would not suggest this place for a group larger than 4, as there are less than a dozen 2 person tables that they will move together.

The truffle burger was delicious and the fries were pretty good too. They don't have a liquor licence but you can bring in your own beer/wine. Their wait staff is a little off. I felt a mixture of pity and annoyance toward our waiter; he must have dropped 2-3 things on the floor during the hour I was there including a spoonful of ketchup on the girl next to me. I'll go back for sure, hopefully they've worked out the kinks by then.

I ordered the Port & Stilton burger, which is medium rare meat with blue cheese on it (and a mushroom or two).  It was different, though not in a way that made me reconsider everything I knew about the hamburger.  The pickles were good and the table outside was nice enough.  This place won't blow your mind, but if you're in the area, you could do worse.

thank heavens for rich pretentious people, they will never get it right......I'll start out by saying the burger is very good, but only slightly larger than a slider and for the price 9 bucks, it's a pain in the pocket. The fries were made out of real potatoes, so that was a good thing but for 3 bucks I was expecting more than 6 or 7 fries, yeah 3 bucks for 7 french fries and all they had to drink was a bevmo selection of alternative sodas and my total was 15 bucks for a tasty slider, 7 french fries and a soda pop. OK....why I gave them 3 stars, the decor doesn't make scenes, you guys sell burgers, not filet mignon.... the logo is hideous, looks like two slabs of poop and the worst thing was the service, I walked in at 9:30 and the place had a few tables filled with very well dressed yuppie types and I'm at the counter waiting to order and the tool that worked there looked right at me and didn't seem to think that I was there to order, so I had to say.... um I'd like to order something to go and he had the audacity to tell me they are closing, so I sarcastically laughed and said don't you close at 10 and then some other guy shows up and said yeah I can take your order, he was a lame ass too, looked bothered, when he handed me my burger to go he just gave me this weird look....so I look in the bag and see this little burger wrapped and the 7 fries wrapped next to it, no napkins no ketchup etc for the fries, so I had to ask him, do the fries come with ketchup? and he was like yes they do and handed me the ketchup and still no have a great night or anything, very unprofessional..... so I was kinda pissed leaving and noticed they had an out door patio that was nice and private so I ate outside and actually chatted with one of the chef's, he asked me if I liked the burger and was very cool unlike the unfriendly tools inside. well I hope they fix the problem with their staff up front, I might go again, but there are way to many other place to check out.

Food:  4.5 stars Service: .5 star This is one of the most unprofessional staffs I've seen.  They seemed disorganized and confused as to what to do.  They were slow to reseat tables, so three tables would be open while there was a crowd outside.  There was an unused patio with chairs and tables and outside chairs and tables and a counter with chairs, but apparently nobody was allowed to sit there.  Some of their friends came in (lots of hugging and backslapping) and they got seated before everyone else that was waiting, and got served their food immediately while others who had been seated before us still hadn't gotten food.  People were not given menus upon seating.  We never received our condiments.  I had to move my car because my street parking expired before our food even arrived.  The parking lot was atrocious with people blocking other people in and then wandering off so that people couldn't leave (I didn't even attempt to park in the lot, following the advice on Yelp).  An order was delivered wrong and the customer was told it was her fault instead of just taking the burger back and apologizing (she was already irate that it took so long to arrive). The food itself was really good. We ordered the umami burger, the triple pork burger, and the truffle burger.  The truffle burger was my favorite--it was extra truffly.  My friends like the umami burger the best.  The pork burger had a nice spicy sauce on it. The onion rings were divine, some of the best I've ever had.  Fries were okay, cut into small thick pieces.  Homemade pickle was good, especially the carrot.  And the soba was okay, nothing special. I wish the food quality was reflected in the service, 'cause despite the excellent food, I really doubt we'll go back again.

Umami Burger... why are you so delicious??? I wish it weren't so. For the simple reason that your owner sucks. Went on a Saturday night with a group of 5... was completely prepared to wait since the place is tiny, so the wait was not the problem. The problem was being bumped on the waiting list because the owner's buddies showed up and jumped the line (after us waiting 45 mins... then we waited another 20 mins or so). That's cool, whatever, you can treat your friends bc you own the place... but how about a little acknowledgment on your part? The guy totally ignored us the whole night, practically tossed the one burger he deigned to serve at us. But the staff there? AMAZING. Loved them. The hostess and one of the servers really went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of. Thank you! Not sure if I will go back, even though the burgers we all had were very, very good. Sides (french fries and onion rings) leave a LOT to be desired, so don't bother.

Truffle burger was phenomenal... how can you go wrong... its super juicy and the perfect amount of truffle flavor... i had half of my friend's manly burger, not my favorite... he's been there several times and says that was the worst one, he's had almost all of them except for two... if i only had the manly burger i would have never went back, but because of my truffle burger i will be back to try the other ones the onion rings, were good with the house sauce... but i felt like they were lacking a bit of seasoning... not something i would order again...  the fries were good with the garlic aioli.. i thought there were something odd about the umami ketchup but my friend loved the ketchup.... all in all, i think you can pass on the sides, but if you need your burger with something on the side, i recommend the fries...

Pretty expensive for a burger with no cheese but the meat was delicious and perfectly cooked, I had to restrain myself from scarfing the whole thing down in seconds. I was impressed with the buns which seemed to have a sweetness to them, like most people I just think of buns as something there so you dont have to hold the meat with your bare hands, but umami has taught me otherwise. No alcohol but a great selection of root beers that go much better with burgers in my opinion.

My SoCal burger at Umami was definitely juicy...maybe a bit too juicy. I don't know if it was grease or juice from the roasted tomato or oil/butter from the caramelized onions or what, but there was a puddle of juice under my burger after the first time I picked it up, to the point that I couldn't set my burger back down at all. Also, the patty was sort of falling apart. Maybe too rare? They never asked how I wanted it cooked. That said, it was incredibly flavorful...all the ingredients paired well, the bun was super fresh, and the sauce was wonderful. No milkshakes? What's up with that? How can a burger place not have shakes? That's a big no-no in my book. Service was adequate, but the dining room was bothersome. The only thing I can think of worse than sitting in a tiny side enclave room with no windows is sitting at the counters facing the wall. Horrible layout. My burger gets a 4, but limited menu, merely adequate service, and poor dining room layout sadly knock Umami down to 3.

Better than the Counter.  Still not close to Father's Office. Ordered: Umami Burger Hatch Burger Fries Onion Rings Came out to about $30 with tax & tip. The burgers are tasty. Don't get the fries.  They are under seasoned and just taste like a plain potato.  The signature sauces are horrible.  The garlic aioli tastes like they put some garlic in some mayo and didn't do anything else.  And regular ketchup would be better than the Umami ketchup. The onion rings are tasty.  I like the batter and you has a nice taste of the malt liquor. The umami burger was my favorite.  My wife liked the hatch burger because of the heat.  The hatch burger was a little too cheesy gooey for me.  Which in my opinion can mask a weak burger.  So it wasn't bad tasting but didn't make an impression on me. I like the portion sizes.  Small, so you don't get too full so you can try other stuff. Still no where near a Father's Office burger and sweet potato fries.

Love the burgers here, but they're pricey and I've gotten attitude from the service every time I've been there.  Yes, I understand the dinning room is small and that you're always busy and crowded, that doesn't give you the right to be short with your costumers.  But the burgers and sides are worth it so I keep coming back.  I had the Casablanca burger last time (lamb) with the malt liquor onion rings.  Definitely recommended.  They also don't serve alcohol so BYOB

If I could give 3.5 stars, I probably would. We went on a Friday night, and there was no wait.  It's a small restaurant, but service is quick, so there is lots of table turnover.  I got an Umami burger - burger with sauteed mushrooms, roasted tomato, house ketchup, and a Parmesan cheese crisp.  I thought it was really, really delicious - savory, rich, and a delicious balance of flavors.  The meat was of particularly good quality, and it was done nicely - medium to medium rare.  We weren't asked how we wanted the burgers done.  The buns are tasty, and I think the size is actually perfect - I didn't have a meat coma afterward. Fiance had the manly burger, which I actually thought was even tastier than mine.  Next time, I'll get the SoCal burger, which seems like the Umami version of and In n Out burger. I disliked the ketchup - tasted odd.  I prefer regular ol' ketchup.  The fries were okay, but I like crispy ones better.  I found the onion rings disappointing... they were oily, and the onion slipped out of its fried casing too easily.  We got the garlic aoli for dipping, and it was also just okay. Overall, really yummy burgers, eh sides.  Great selection of fun sodas!  I'll be back, but in general, I'd rather hit 25 Degrees, where the sides are as unbelievable as the burgers.

Had the truffle burger.  Would rate that 4 stars but the place has to get 2 stars for a very small menu.  No beer or liquor.  The tables are so close to the door that cold air rushes in when the open the door.  Way overhyped place that doesn't deliver.  Go to 8oz or the Counter for good portions and good drinks.  Oh and the dessert menu sounded like they went to Ralphs and raided the ice cream section.

its a simple menu its a simple place its a simple concept. so ill keep the review simple..

Loved the Manly Burger, the steak fries and the tempura onion rings. I also tried the signature Umami Burger, it was decent but didn't hit the spot like the other items. The Umami ketchup is legit as is the House Dressing. Atmosphere is solid and the service is on point. Only downside is the parking and the proximity of your table to the other guests, otherwise really great spot.

I am disappointed at this place. The burger I had was very dry and the burgers are too small for their prices. I am not a big burger eater and I am very particular about my burger. It needs to very very juicy for me to appreciate it. So I decided to try this what looks like a "gourmet burger" restaurant. But the when the waitress brough out my burger, I was shocked that they would charge $10 bucks for two thick pieces of buns with tiny piece of burger patty. Well, "maybe it tastes really good", I said to myself. But after having a bite of it. I gave up. It was very dry and I needed their garlic mayo to go with my burger so I can finish it. Overall, it's just an average burger restaurant with a hip atmosphere. I think I would driver further to Red Robin's if I ever crave for burger.

There is always a line here. The wait can easily be upwards of an hour. Do yourself a big favor and ask how long the wait is BEFORE you valet your car. And bring someone who likes to chat it up -- it will seriously help the time pass. The menu offers a handful of burgers (Truffle Burger & Port and Stilton are my faves) all around $10, and your choice of condiment. Sides include fries, onion rings, and salad. You really can't go wrong here. As a side note, there is very very little space between the small tables, meaning you can very easily overhear any and all of the conversations around your table. A place for an awkward first date, this is not.

If you haven't been here yet then you are truly missing out. This place is awesome. I have been here twice so far and both times were amazing. First time i came i tried the triple pork burger. Simply divine burger. has to be in my top 3 best burgers of all time. second time i went i had the manly burger. again just blown away by the flavors and just perfection in cooking the meat. They have hand cut fries and some pretty rocking sweet potato fries as well. I have decided that I will come back to try all they have to offer. I highly recommend a trip just to try it.

I went to Umami burger with my wife with high hopes, I always love a good burger place.   This was going to be 4 stars, but things turned sour near the end of the meal. My wife ordered the Umami burger and onion rings and I ordered the Hatch and french fries.   I thought it odd that the menu didn't describe what was in the Umami burger, and when we asked the waitress, she said it quickly enough that we couldn't remember most of it anyway.    We both thought my wife's burger was just sorta "meh"...underseasoned, and lacking in a good crust.   The interior was spot on, so bonus points for not overcooking.   The texture of the meat was excellent, but that parmesan crisp gave it an overall really strange, sorta mealy texture.   Taking that out improved the burger tremendously.   On the other hand, I very much enjoyed my hatch burger, just spicy enough, toppings were tasty, and it was cooked quite well, though again, lacking in a decent crust.   The onion rings were cooked very well and very tasty, but the french fries were, as others have described, somewhat bland and almost seem undercooked, despite having come out at a temperature that the earth's core is jealous of.   I would definitely get the thin, crispy fries next time, they do not appear to be that thin, just thin in relation to the behemoths that the normal fries are. Overall, I thought the burgers were better than The Counter if only because they can actually cook it to order correctly, I've never had The Counter get even remotely close to cooking a burger how I ordered it.   On the other hand, I think the similarly priced Hole in the Wall has burgers that taste better overall, but they don't have nearly the variety of extras. So, the food wasn't bad, but didn't blow me away like I hoped it would.   Then came the strangeness.   Someone came around to refill our waters and, as he poured mine, the plastic cup started sliding across the table with the force of the water.   I caught it, but that warning wasn't enough to stop him from refilling my wife's cup with the same gusto, knocking it over and sending water all over the table.   Thankfully, he offered to clean it up...well, no, actually, he mumbled sorry and walked away.   I later saw him bring drinks to another table but just dump them at the corner of the table, grunt, and walk off. Then we tried to pay, which ended up being about a 15 minute ordeal, it seemed like paying in cash threw them for a loop.   Once we got our change, I got up, and while walking out, the same guy from the water incident came up behind me and shouldered me out of the way.   He wasn't carrying any food, so I'm not entirely clear on what the big rush was, but I can't say I really appreciated being pushed. The guy may have been having a bad day, but from his attitude, it was clear that he wasn't, and he should have been at least taken off the floor until he settled down.   Given that the food wasn't amazing and the rest of the service didn't make up for the anti-service at the end of the meal, I don't see myself going back anytime soon.

Ive been wanting to try this place after I saw it on the food network.  Considering that LA has so many good burger places, ie in and out, fathers office, etc. i went in thinking that it better be good.  And boy was it good.  We got the Burratta salad which was creamy and delicious and we shared an Umami signature burger and it was juicy and so flavorful.  Inside the burger is a parmesan crisp and portabella mushroom - just amazing.  The reason why I give the place 4 stars tho is- the thick cut fries were the only down fall.  They were like cubed potatoes that were not crunchy and slightly undercooked.  Hopefully the thin cut fries are better.  Would definitely without a doubt go back for the burger.

i'm a conquistador of the following: - donuts - ice cream - ....and a good 'ol reliable burger! luckily, umami burger is a quick bike ride/drive from where i work so i've been here a few times for lunch. the burgers are very decadent - rich and full of flavor. while some may complain about the size of the burger, i personally think that it's the perfect portion to satisfy any burger craving, and you still have the ability to return to work without experiencing that after lunch malaise. the sides and soda selections are a winners too! drawback: no beer at this location :( so go! try! don't base your visit on my review!

We've been here before, but this time we brought friends who haven't had the opportunity.  Between the four of us, we got five burgers including the vegetarian, truffle, umami, hatch and the port/stilton.  We also got three appetizers including the pickles, tater tots and sweet potato fries.  Delicious!

Burger was okay, the fries have freaking cinnamon on them, and since i got the order to go they made me wait outside.  Everyone in there was kinda bitchy, they didn't give us condiments, we had to ask specifically for them.  If you eat there maybe you get treated better but if you take it to go, prepare for some shitty ass service.  I've eaten at the one in Santa Monica and it's better.

Ok, so I normally do not eat burgers, however this place is absolutely delicious beyond belief for burgers!! I have gone back countless times, so my suggestion if you like veggies in your burger is to go with the SOCAL BURGER, every bite is soooooo delectable. For the meat lovers out there I would go for either the UMAMI BURGER, or the TRUFFLE BURGER. You can never forget the TATOR TOTTS too! The tator totts are not on the menu you have to ask for it, but its filled with cheesiness. ENJOY!

I came to this place with very high expectations, and although the burger was good, it did not live up to all the hype in my opinion. I had the "manly burger" and split some of the regular and sweet potato fries. The burger was tasty, but I definitely left hungry and with an empty wallet. The sweet potato fries were good, however I still prefer the food at father's office over umami. One thing that annoyed me was that they charged for extra condiments which come in a spoon - probably enough for half a mouthful for $1.50.

I mean yeah it was a good LITTLE burger, however if your order to go you have to stand outside (lame) and for whatever reason I felt this awkward out of place feeling...I order, then my roommate came up to place his order and everyone just...kinda...left the register? The hell is that about? Over all, this place has good ranch and awesome "fun sized" burgers, but their lack of not knowing what well done means and poor service makes this place kinda  ehhh...not really worth it.

Okay.. I was a doubter but I must say that I enjoyed their burgers. Dont read my review and think that I am overly joyous about it. Im just giving props where props are due. They may be small, but they are quite juicy and tasteful. Truffle Burger & Hatch Burger were pretty dang good... Like i said I was a doubter, but I really enjoyed. I put this burger slightly above Father's Office.

hands down the better portion size w flavor. - juicy burger is far too greasy and huge (dont know which is worse, this or cheesecake) -counters is much more conservative in the sense of how the food is prepared, though you cannot really put any blame on them since it, like juicy burger, is a "build-your-own" type. i think umami is the choice because while the other burger competitors are around the same price, umami holds its gourmet seal throughout the menu and especially taste/portion. you will not be disappointed.

i don't get ithe hype....i really don't went twice now...just to be fair tried all 3 types of meat (turkey, beef and pork) burgers. i actually preferred the turkey. was pretty juicy and actually had some flavor. the other 2 were just blah and boring. maybe i'm just not the gourmet burger gal since i prefer the classic burger.....ya know, the lettuce, tomato and onion deal. quality of ingredients must be the hype bc the meat was very fresh. fries...eh.....i'd rather have the fries at a bowling alley. onion rings were good but too damn greasy.   i still prefer the apple pan.

after reading that this is "the best burger in america" i had to taste what the hype was all about. the verdict: TRUE. this is the best burger place i have ever been to. There is valet for like 2 bucks, but you can park around the corner on ninth for free if you want too. it was like a 20 minute wait to get seated. it was like another 25 minute wait to get our food. all definitely worth the wait. The inside is pretty small, but smells delicious, makes you even more hungry. They have an out door area, perfect for a nice day in LA. Now the food..we had the umami burger of course. the burgers are freshly ground in house and you can definitely taste the difference. The bun is freshly made and baked to perfection, even stamped with a "U" on it haha. nice little touch to it. It has a parmesan crisp which adds a nice texture to the burger. the oven roasted tomato almost tastes like a sundried tomato and it goes perfect with the burger. The have fresh mushroom it it also. the truffle burger. now this was my favorite of the 2 to be honest. its got the fresh ground meat cooked medium rare with a housemade truffle cheese. now the truffle cheese just melting away on this burger is so sweet and delicious, and trust me they put a lot of it on there. They have a truffle glaze on there as well which just compliments the truffle cheese without the overpowering the taste of the burger. And thats it, no fluff, meat and cheese (and glaze). note to self tho: it is a little on the greasy side, but hey a little grease never hurts anyone, and it just adds to the flavor in my opinion! Wee had the skinny fries. classic with the burger. get the umami ketchup its soo good! its sweeter than normal ketchup. The garlic aoili is delicious, pure garlic, buttery flavor going on there. We got the malt liquor tempura battered onion rings. it was good, but just only one haha. the tempura is really thick on there, so its really heavy. but it does have good flavor. This is a must try in LA! will definitely come back for more! the other burgers looked yummy too! this is THE BEST BURGER place! hands down

The hype is true! If you're looking for a place that has an above average unique burger this is your place. Very light in your stomach. The best analogy would be to compare this to eating chocolate. Umami burger would be hershey kisses. Light but delicious. Fries were so-so a little like in and out fries just bigger. Wait is about 20-60 minutes so be prepared to sit for awhile. Good place when you want to mix it up and like trying new things.

My friends and I went to this place before going to the OMD concert. We each ordered a different appetizers and burgers so we can taste all of them. The portion of the burger is not very big, but the the quality is amazing. It was very fresh and tasty. I ordered the teriyaki burger and it was excellent. The meat was moist and juicy.

Drove up from San Diego to try this burger and it was definitely worth it. I got the Umami burger and it was cooked perfectly. All the components went together and the bun sealed the deal. Got there at 2pm, plenty of seats and the server was on point. 2.50$ for valet wasnt really a big deal. They need to open one in SD.

A heads up, try to find street parking in the neighborhoods first.  They charge for valet in their lot.  I came here w/ two friends after a job and overall, this place isn't too bad.  The 3 of us got a Umami Burger, Hatch Burger, and Truffle Burger.  All three of them tasted great and the meats were cooked to tender and juicy perfection in contrast to the warm toasted crispy bun.  The sauces they provide are also amazing.  I do however have one major gripe: for the money I paid, the portions were really small.  For around 10 dollars, he burgers are no bigger than say a famous star from carl's jr.  And For 2.50, I had a small glass of iced tea that didn't even amount to one cup.  I actually almost stopped by a Carl's Jr. on my way back since I was still so hungry!  So my advice is definitely check this place out sometime, but make sure it's not during your hungriest hour.

I ordered the triple pork burger...it was super yummy, decadent, and juicy!  This place is super trendy....a given considering the location.   The reason I give it only 3 stars is cause I didn't really feel comfortable...I felt a bit rushed...and usually when I'm eating burgers, I associate it with being comfortable and laid back...this place is definitely a shi shi burger place.  I'd come here again when I feel like dishing out the dough and having a trendy day...def not a come, hang out, and have a burger and some fries kind of place.

I came here with a bunch of friends, this being our first time everyone ate the Umami burger and I had the truffle burger and truffle fries. All the burgers were delicious server was nice, the bread was so soft and cloud like, the steak fries were like lego bricks made of potatoes I wanted to build a fort then eat it. There is a lot of hype over them but by no means were they bad or less than advertised, its L.A. everything there is over hyped anyway.

Tasty unique burgers, kinda pricey, not so good service. Came in here for my last time while having my car washed across the street. Because I was solo I was told I was not allowed to sit in the dining area or on the patio even though there were 4 available 2 seat tables inside and 4 available tables outside. I was told they were saving these seats for party's of 2+, and not serving food in the patio yet. So instead, I was told to sit at "the bar".. which isn't a bar at all. It's a counter in a tiny crammed back room with no windows. The restaurant  was not even busy but I still had to wait 10+ minutes for someone to take my order, and another 15 minutes to get my burger. The burger was sweet and juicy, although a little small and not very filling. For the burger + tax and tip I was looking at a $15 bill. It was good, but not that good and certainly not worth the crappy service. On my way out I noticed that they only filled one of the tables they were saving, and people were eating in the supposedly "off limits" patio. I shan't be returning.

my friend lives down the block from this Umami burger and i have to say i had no clue what i was in for. to be honest i still dont know what umami is, but seriously the burger i got was scrumptious! i devoured that burger in 5-10 minutes and to be honest im not that big of an eater. i mean i like to eat, but compared to many i still got alot tasting to do. ANYWAY, there are a few cons. the particular location is bit a small. epecially for westside eating. we went on a weekday, late afternoon and still had to wait about 20 minutes to sit in a small room, somewhat of a nook, which was awkward to say the least. then theres the pricing.$10 for a burger? heh that usual - if at least it comes with a side order. its a commonl thing to get a side order when you get a burger, right? i mean umami burger are special, but seriously after gourging myself of their umami goodness it just didnt seems enough. overall, i will definitely  to go back to this place and probably check out the hollywood one closer to me.

HEARING ABOUT UMAMI: I'd heard about Umami Burger on the radio a couple months back, so I looked them up on their website. The burgers looked delicious, and the scene looked cool. So, yesterday, while driving through LA, my family and I were going to go to Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles. But, there were too many people. So, we went to Umami instead. PARKING: They offer Valet but it's not because they're too "fancy" (it really isn't), but because there is like no parking on the street. However, my family and I got lucky because there was parking on the street and no reason to vallet. SEATING: We were seated outside because it was a beautiful day. They have stand up patio heaters and beautiful lights set up outside, so I bet it looks beautiful at night. SERVICE: Our seater was VERY nice. She had such a genuine smile and seemed to really care about us. Something about her was just so nice, and made our experience at Umami even better. The food was delivered very fast, and we didn't have to wait to be seated. DRINKS: The drinks are delivered in bottles. They have Mexican coke which you rarely find, which was very unique and well just awesome. We ordered 2 diet cokes, 2 regular cokes, 1 orange crush, and 1 cherry cola thing. They were all very good, and we got refills on them. [They weren't free] FOOD: We ordered 2 truffle burgers, 3 manly burgers (two with just cheese and bacon and one normal), and 1 pastrami burger. I had a bite of my mom's truffle burger: DELICIOUS but not as decked out as thte other burgers. My manly burger was DELICIOUS!!!!!! So juicy, yet crunchy. If you like burgers, YOU'LL LOVE THIS. Then we ordered dessert. That was great too. Food was just wonderful. You won't be disappointed. PRICE: Money really wasn't an object.. but if you want cheap Umami isn't for you. Our bill was about $200. 30% Tip is automatically added to your bill. But our waitress was outstanding so it was cool. OVERALL: If you're willing to spend the money: there are a lot of Umami Burger's throughout Los Angeles, but this one on La Brea really does stand out.

My 5 coworkers and I just got back from lunch at Umami Burger.  We took two cars, the first car got lucky and found a spot in their small lot.  The second car wasn't so lucky, he had to circle around the block and eventually parked down the street. There was one other person eating at the restaurant when we got there so it wasn't too busy.  We placed our orders and sat down and anxiously awaited our food.  This is where the fun starts... 5 of us ordered at the same time, the 6th person ordered a bit after because he was finding parking.  The first 5 burgers did not come out at the same time.  They staggered out about 3-5 minutes apart.  We didn't want the food to get cold, so we didn't wait to eat.  On top of that, they messed up the orders.  They wanted to give our food to the next table and their food to us.  When the chef/owner saw the mix-up with the burgers, he promptly asked to speak with the server in the back.  You could hear as the server was walking out saying "yeah yeah, I got it".  They forgot to deliver my co-worker's salad until after he was done with the burger and had to remind them.  Another coworker didn't get his iced coffee until asking as well.  You would figure they would have their act together considering the restaurant wasn't even busy.   Now to the actual food review... I ordered the triple pork burger with fries which came out to $11.91.  The burger was great - the smokey flavor from the bacon came through with the chorizo.  The biggest element making this burger so good was the bun.  It is lightly toasted to give it a light crunch, but it is soft on the outside with a hint of sweetness through every bite.  I was looking forward to the thick fries that I've seen in the pictures, but I was the victim of a bait and switch.  I got normal skinny fries, nothing special about them at all.  I was really hoping to try those.  The ketchup was very different, it almost tasted like a very light marinara sauce.  So I asked for the garlic aioli and relish, and I got a very rude response.  The menu says "free with purchase" and he says to me "limit of two per person".  I am sitting in a table of six, and you're going to tell me that there is a limit when I'm asking for two people?  I will admit though that the roasted garlic aioli was very good.  You should state that there is a limit of two per person if that's your policy. In summary, the burgers were good (everyone in my group was very happy).  We'll pass on the fries next time since they weren't even the thick variety.  Don't expect good service there, but do expect a very nice burger waiting for you.  I know I'll be back for another burger...

This place is okay. I would not come back though. Father's Office is sooooo much better. The service was meh. My friend and I came in, and awkwardly stood by the door for a couple minutes, wondering whether we had to order at the counter or sit down. There were only about 6 other people there, but it them awhile to get to us when we were seated. When we got our food, the burger was super squishy  because it was super RARE. That was when we came to the realization that they never asked us how we would like our meat done. The onion ring order came with 5 onion rings and the fries order came with 8 fries. Not worth the prices.

lets start with the umami burger.... the meat was perfectly cooked medium. it was juicy and very flavorful yet not too overpowering. it was a nice mixture of sweetness from the mushrooms and sauce and salty from the meat patty. ok, now with the sides.... we ordered the french fries and onion rings. SERIOUSLY? whats up with the 6 pieces of french fries they give you? it's like they charge you $.50 for each fry.  theres a reason why they serve the ketchup in the small spoon... cuz you don't need anymore! i like the fathers office fries and sweet potato fries much better. the tempura onion rings were pretty good but greasy. i would go for the burger but not the sides. plus, the service was good.  so i'll give them a 4.  ;)

I was gonna flame this restaurant in detail, but Claire R. said EVERYTHING I wanted to say. Thanks for stealing my thunder Ms. Claire.  ;-)  (Do read her review. She is spot on.) Like Claire R.'s experience, Bitchy Camp Dude informed us (as she was walking away) that they were out of fries. What? It's a burger joint! Send someone to Ralphs down the street and buy some damn potatoes. The wait for 3 burgers and greeeezzy onion rings topped off at 45 minutes (and no damn fries!) The owner was around, running in and out of the kitchen, frantically putting out fires where he could, but nothing could have saved that night's dinner service.  He really should have gotten his ass behind that grill and flipped his little brainchilds himself and get these patrons fed. Bitchy Camp Dude set the tone from the get-go, and it was all downhill from there. This is a rookie operation, with no warmth, no pride, no heart, and no clue.

FOOD: pretty tasty esp the triple pork burger. SERVICE:  ADAM can go suck it.  First time anyone has made me feel compelled to write a review.  The staff in general is inefficient with poor communication.  One server says you can sit outside, the other server says no you can't.  Servers are easily frazzled when place gets busy.  Being frazzled is excusable.  But this Adam creature...rude, obnoxious, passive aggressive and full of himself.   He is awful enough for me to not want to go back.  Too bad cuz the burgers aren't bad...

Delicious.  A minimalist approach to the burger, which is all the burger really needs.  I had the stilton blue cheese burger, cooked to a perfect medium rare.  It was fantastic.  My friend had the pork belly burger, and I cannot vouch for that b/c I find pork belly disgusting, but he said it was fantastic.  We shared the fries (thick cut, and not overcooked, but still crispy/soft inside) with the aioli (had a hint of tomato- fabulous addition!).  Loved the fries.   The only thing I wish is that they served alcohol.  A good beer would go nicely with these burgers.   Nice that they have valet parking too, so you don't have to worry about finding a spot.   Service was quick, but we did have to ask repeatedly to get the water we ordered.

Def a place to stop if your tired of the in an out fix, gourmet burgers at good prices, burgers are cooked to perfection.thick and juicy! A Mexican coke tops the goodness to remind you to come again, unfortunately the second time around, the service was lacking, waiting 45 minutes for the fries to arrive... still debating if i should go again,

Before I go on, I have to let everyone know my tastes.  I like Picnic outdoor Hamburger. No fancy to my burger, just bun meat lettuce tomatoes pickles etc... and as simple as that can be to make many places do a great job and others don't.  I don't even like the thousand island dressing they put on all the burgers in LA( In and out i forgive you) Umami burger is a different kinda burger.  were they put different things in with they burgers, like sun dried tomatoes instead of regular ones.  The Burger I had was BURSTING with flavors, wow!......Just not my kinda flavor, but tasty all the same.  Favorite part of the burger was the bun. The bun was sooooo good.  The meat it self was wonderful to.  The toppings were not my thing, though that is were most the flavor comes from, and I think many people love those toppings, just not my fav.  I had a burger with mozzarella cheese and sun dried tomatoes (can't remember what else though). Though there burgers have a lot of flavor what i was disappointed in were there fries. They were kinda like stake fries, but there lightly fried (on purpose  i think because they had a light crisp to the outside). I wish they had a lot more crisp to them......and serving them with a ketchup mixed with roster sauce(sriracha hot sauce) served in an asian style spoon doesn't take them to some culinary fancy level in my opinion. Would I eat there again? Yes, if someone else that really likes the place wants to go. I would like to try a different Burger, I might have just picked the one i didn't enjoy.

This place sucks! Basically White Castle burgers at exorbitant prices. The veggie burger is a slice of mushroom. For real. Just a slice. As if that wasn't insulting enough, the service is horrendous.  You will leave hungrier than you were when you arrived, and you will feel abandoned and neglected.  Do not go!

I live in the neighborhood so there wasn't really an excuse not to walk over there.  I ordered the Hatch, which is their spicy burger.  Their burgers are definitely on the small size, but it was the perfect size for me (1/2 an Island's burger fills me up).  The bread was nice and buttery and overall pretty good burger.  Lots of flavor.  I really enjoyed their fries; they had a different take on them and the different sauces were fun.  Best to described this place- quality over quanity.  I think it would do better if they made the burgers bigger or drop the cost.  Wasn't the best burger, but beats any fast food or chained burger.  I would come here again.

so so so overrated. Had the port and stilton burger (because the signature umami burger looks gross to me- I really don't understand the parmesan crisp thing) was almost inedible- undercooked, mushy, the bun was mushy- everything. Tasted vaguely like oil. The only redeeming factor of the meal was the rootbeer float, which is probably the easiest thing to make ever. My bf didn't like the signature umami burger either. And the fries look awful and fake to me. Not a cool vibe inside either.

Best. Burger. Ever. This place has the best hamburger I have tried in both San Francisco and Los Angeles.   My brothers, who live there, have been talkng about this place for a month and when I finally found time to visit, this was the first place they took me to straight from the airport (Glad I did not fill up on Southwest's peanuts, fiesta mix or ginger ale) Not sure if its the parmesean, the mushrooms or the bun or the meat.  The whole package just works here.  Super juicy, full of flavor, deeply satisfying. Another nice aspect is the size of the hamburger -- it is enough to not order a second burger (although, I would not fault you for that) , but modest enough to allow you to enjoy the killer tempura onion rings and ice cream-merengue cookie sandwiches.  Homemade ketchup and mexican coca cola in the bottle doesn't hurt either. You must try it.

I was part of a party of 7. Waited 85 min to sit. Burger was great. They ran out of the salad. Ordered all of the deserts. Only liked the vanilla bean ice cream sandwich, the rest weren't great. Service was fair. I prefer the Hollywood & Hillhurst location. Full bar & great atmosphere. they do, however tend to run out of items.

Umami came highly regarded by a good friend. She recommended the Truffle Burger with Italian truffle cheese and truffle glaze, but seeing as I'm not into truffles that was out. She ordered the Port and Stilton with Pocas port-caramelized onions. They cook all their burgers medium rare so hers was juicy with the sweetness of the onions blending with the creaminess and tang of blue cheese. We shared their Malt Liquor onion rings and sweet potato fries. I ordered the Manly Burger with beer-cheddar cheese, smoked salt onion strings and bacon pardons. Ridiculously good. Make sure to get the Umami ketchup.

food = delicious. make that amazing. make that outstanding. It really is. It's a bitch to get into sometimes, we arrived on Monday night at 745 and waited a half hour. The guy took a group of 4 (we were also 4) that arrived after us because he had messed up the list. He knew right away, but didn't acknowledge it or offer us anything.   Like I said, the food is amazing. Pay attention to where you are in the line though!

The original Umami burger is the best i think. I've had the blue cheese one too and though it was good it wasn't as good as the original. I take a star away because sometimes the wait is RIDICULOUS. the wait to get a table takes forever, and then your food takes forever too. However, i'm the type of person who is willing to wait if the food is awesome. and it is.

Great burger and excellent fries.  I am so impressed that such small portions pack so much flavor!  LA prices but hey, when you want to splurge on a tasty burger then make a stop here!  Old skool sodas that pack extra sugar to keep you talking and eating and eating and talking.  I swear that Dr. Pepper had crank in it!  I am gonna try the Hollywood location to get some beer with my burger next time!  I tried the Turkey with Miso sauce.

Tremendous. Started off with the beet salad. Light, perfectly seasoned with an amazing dressing and what a great portion size. Was really amazed. Next up, the burger. It was the Port and Stilton burger for me. Perfectly cooked, mouth-watering and sensational. How is it that a burger can be just that well made and balanced? Paired with onion rings and the fries (which are very cleverly cut) it was a terrific meal and a joy. The place is on the small side, which makes it fun and intimate. Went on a Sunday afternoon around 5- just before the dinner rush. By them the time the check came there was a line forming for tables. Highly recommend Umami for anyone looking for an excellent burger... you will compare all others to this place.

Had Umami Burger for the first time today and it was wonderful!  I get my car washed across the street and I could have been eating there this whole time.  Scheeez. Had the Umami Burger and sweet potato fries.  Both were wonderful. I told the guy it was my first time so he said that was a good choice and I have to say it was succulent. I've read a lot of reviews on here that say the burgers are small, but I have to say - they weren't that small!  I was definitely full.  You can't really compare this to some other fast food burger because this is definitely a gourmet burger. Worth the price to treat yourself to something really tasty once in a while.

Pretty good burgers but I think they're generally bland. I wish the meat had more flavor. The burgers are definitely tender, actually the most tender I've ever had but they need more flavor. The fries are awesome, triple cooked I think and the sugar-based sodas are a plus. The people are cool but the valet parking thing for that plaza is unnecessary. I don't want to valet for burgers if it isn't in Bev Hills. They should at least make valet free. Overall, the place is pretty good minus 2 stars for lack of flavor in the meat and valet parking.

OK, I've heard the hype, I've had some of the other gourmet burgers around town, so when I found myself near Wilshire and La Brea, famished having not eaten lunch by 230pm on a Thursday, I thought, I will REALLY enjoy this burger right now, and since it is well past lunchtime I should be able to get fed pretty fast. I realize this is not fast food (I haven't had chain fast food in YEARS), but I was extremely disappointed by the service, to the point where I left before being offered a chance to order. yes, it was that bad, I didn't even get to eat there!   I happened upon a parking spot on the nearby street, and was surprised to see VALET PARKING for this burger joint. Hmmm, my price-gouging radar starts to flare up. I enter the small dining room. I look around. somewhat busier than I expected for this time of day, but still, plenty of open tables. No host. . . .Still no host. I slowly approach the "bar" toward the kitchen, I begin speaking to a waiter, saying "hi, it's my first time here, I'd like to order . . . ." and before I can even finish saying as much as I just wrote, the guy turns away, pretending he didn't hear a thing, and disappears into the kitchen. I'm thinking, huh, this guy must be STRESSED. Probably hasn't gotten an acting job in months (years) and is fearing Umami Burger is going to be his only employer this year. His attitude was professional - if you are looking for a professional actor to play a surly and callous villain who is a date-rapist. Professional server, NOT. I don't even know if there is an official host here, but any decent waiter will ACKNOWLEDGE customers and refer them to the host or just go ahead and seat them, or tell them to wait. Nope, I end up glancing around to see who else might be able to explain how one goes about ordering the famous (over-hyped?) Umami Burger, and I move closer to the "bar." there are at least three employees back there, looking busy. too busy to greet customers perhaps. I finally make eye contact with one and he hands me a menu and shows me to a table. No words, no greeting, no "we're really slammed, but your waiter will be with you as soon as possible." So I peruse the menu, decide to order the basic Umami Burger -- thinking, this will be a great way to see what the Umami thing is all about. I am even convincing myself that $10 is a bargain for such high quality. I think about ordering some fries for $4 or so. I've pretty much made up my mind to get the burger and fries now (after about 2 minutes at the table), so I put the menu down and glance around looking for the waiter. I don't want to seem anxious or overly demanding so I chill for a few minutes and then glance around some more. after about 6-7 minutes of this, I realize, I've been here over ten minutes and no one has so much as greeted me. I'm pissed. I'm out of there. (About 5 minutes later I am enjoying some great Korean tacos from BOOL BBQ over on Wilshire. good food, good deal, fast and friendly service - I am happy.) Maybe one day I will return to Umami Burger to give them a second chance. One day when I have more than an hour for lunch and am feeling like spending at least $20 for a burger, fries, drink, tax and tip. Yes, I always tip at least 20%. that is, when there is service at all.

I've lived in the Miracle Mile for about 2 years now, and I've finally managed to make my way over to Umami Burger.  I have heard so many good things about it, I just had to try it.  The whole table decided to go with the flagship burger, Umami x6.  After the first bite, all I can say is... wow.  It was a crazy mix of flavors all put together.  Now I really understand their concept of "umami"!  I can't believe it took me this long to get here, and in a sense, it was a good thing.  I don't know if my waistline could handle it :) The pickle plate was awesome.  I thought they literally meant "pickles" not pickled items.  So it was surprise that we not only got the traditional pickles, but also pickled beets, okra, and mushrooms.  The sauce on the mushroom was really good, and literally our table was fighting to get the last pieces!  French fries were good too, and the dipping sauces they gave us were phenomenal.  I'm not a big fan of mayo type sauces, but my friends seemed to believe they were really good. If you want dessert, go for their ho-ho's and red velvet ding dongs.  Good stuff.  Their ice cream sandwiches look good too, but as I'm lactose intolerant and didn't bring my lactaid pills (dammit) I didn't get to try it.  Once again, my friends tell me it did not disappoint! Oh, Mexican coke anyone??!  None of that HF Corn Syrup for me!

This place is alright, I guess. Was expecting more with all the hype I heard about it. Don't get me wrong, I would eat there again, but it wasn't a GREAT as everyone says. I had the turkey burger which was really good. It was moist unlike a lot of turkey burgers out there. The onion rings were too oily, and the table next to us had to return theirs for that reason. But the fries (skinny) were good. Their home-made ketchup is regular ketchup with truffle oil. Good but expected something different. THE MUST-ORDER from Umami were the ice cream sandwiches! Delicious!!!

We went to Umami Burger and we were disappointed. First, we were seated on the outside patio, which they did not ask whether to sit there or inside and just assumed we were okay with it. When we sat there, half of us were sitting in the sun with flies and pigeons. it wasn't the best atmosphere and it made the food less appetizing. The service was mediocre. They gave us the condiments when were halfway done with our burgers and almost done with our fries. They gave us an additional side of fries when we didn't order it (and they charged  us, but we eat it). Plus, they didn't care about giving us the food, and they just set it down on the table anywhere. They did not offer to refill our water. Although we did think the quality of products were pretty good, the burgers were just okay. I thought they were a bit undercooked. I probably would have given this place three stars if we sat inside, not in the sun and no birds, but we didn't, so I'm giving it two stars. I will most likely not go back.

Had heard rave reviews so decided to try it out.   The burger:  it's okay but overpriced burger. I was not really impressed.  I was kind of grossed out that the juices flowing from the burger was  red/pink.  I had asked for medium to medium well but it looked more like medium-rare.   The side:  the heirloom tomato salad was interesting.  The tempura onion rings are awesome!  But it was quite oily.

Apparently Unami doesn't need my business or my money  or at least that's what they led me to believe. I called three times and no one picked up so I drove to the location to place my order. I was forced to valet and pay for the parking. The guy who took my order told me to wait outside and he would bring it to me. I waited for 25 minutes and then went back to check. My order had been sitting on the counter for a while. The girl who had rung me up just a little while before had already forgotten me. Took the food home annoyed but willing to be wowed. It was cold. The fries were gross. The pork burger was okay but not worth it. I think this is one of those places where the hype and the expansion outgrew the quality of the product.

Decided to try it out given the long lines at Father's Office (and the fact that it's on the way home)....VERY small inside....anyway, the burgers were not bad...wife liked her truffle burger...the meat seemed of decent quality...however, the service is very average (our waitress seemed disinterested)....but would probably go back to a different, bigger location (Hollywood?) if craving an overpriced burger again...(drove by today on the way home and there was a crowd outside at 3 pm...kind of funny when you think about it)....

There is a HUGE problem with this restaurant. It is hyped into outer space. You never realize how much hype and speculation can alter your first experience at Umami burger. With that being said... It is literally the best burger I have ever had in my entire life! I accept that there may be a better burger, perhaps right around the corner, so I am still looking. Whenever I'm at another restaurant, I will without fail change my order to their burger, JUST to confidently say that Umami is number 1. HOWEVER, Umami's entire menu is not all stellar. Gourmet burger joints have the misconception that putting a bunch of high quality crap in a towering stack will make a good burger. Incorrect, smartypants. Why is your burger so tall that I can't get a single bite without making a mess? Umami burgers are of highly manageable size! They fill your nostrils with an imposing aroma! They look beautiful! The Umami Burger and the SoCal burger are highly delicious, but they don't especially stand out from the crowd of gourmet burgers I've had. The Port and stilton burger is top notch, but again, I've had very similar bleu cheese fancified blah blah gourmet burgers. The hatch burger and the truffle burger CAN NOT be beaten. Perfectly plump, greasy bun. Cheese, meat and bread seamlessly flowing into one carefully crafted shape, literally bleeding flavor all over your disbelieving lips. Oh and by the way, I'm 99% certain they put TRUFFLE in their ketchup. I fell out of MY chair too! So if you hipsters go there, eat the signature Umami burger and scoff that it doesn't live up to the hype, just so you can hear yourself say some super alt words, why don't you try the truffle burger? And then say "whatever"

This place is a solid 4 star burger place.  I dont know if i would go out of my way to eat here, but it is pretty good.  Triple Pork burger= pretty good if you are looking for something different.  My favorite is the unami burger... very good with the jalapeno ranch.  The salad was fair but i refuse to rate a burger place based on its salad.  My one complaint is the size, i had to eat about a burger and a half to fill me up.

I have always been a fan of fun food adventures. This spot was inspired by a recent Yahoo! article stating that Umami was the best burger in America! With that kind of claim.. it instantly shot up on my "must try" list. So.. after the Ellen show on Thursday - I drove 20 miles out of the way just to partake in the experience. My restaurant reviews are two fold - based on food and service. Burger: Umami is a Japanese word meaning "savory taste". Their were about 8 different burgers to chose from on the menu. I opted for the Truffle Burger (even though I had no idea what truffle meant - dont judge me- I'm a rookie food reviewer). All I know is my burger did not arrive with a decadent piece of chocolate filled candy.I do now know it has something to do with mushrooms. The burger arrived with a "U" stamped on the tall bun and the patty looked thick and juicy. I was starving - I had after all burned a lot of calories dancing my booty off at Ellen. One bite into the burger and I knew the "U" stood for undercooked! I have never in my life eaten a medium rare hamburger. To be honest, it frightened me and my natural instinct was to send it back and ask them to throw it back on the grill. But I refrained. The flavor of the meat was good and juicy. They also delivered ketchup and a mayonnaise garlic spread in trendy little spoons. I wasn't a fan of the ketchup (sucker for Heinz) but the mayo was delish! However if you exceeded  more than your small spoonful you are charged for additional servings? Really an extra charge for condiments?  I finished the burger but couldn't help but continue to look at the meat.. I think I asked Melissa 10 times if it looked cooked all the way. Her burger was cooked the same. Conclusion: Best Burger in America? NO. Final Grade: B  Side Note: The truffle fries were amazing and I wished we had ordered two servings instead of one. I wanted more. Service: Just because you are a new trendy hot spot and Justin Timberlake claims you are his " favorite burger" doesn't mean you should let the service of your establishment slide. I wasn't impressed. First the joint was small and seemed very inconvenienced with the amount of patrons that were waiting to dine there. There was no room to wait inside - which is normally a big deal to me- but it was raining and only one tiny umbrella for cover. We were seated in about 25 min. (Which didn't seem so bad since we spent most of it browsing through Urban Outfitters across the way) Once seated inside the tables were small and close together. The decor was trendy and the bar was well stocked. However there was only 5 seats at the bar and anyone that tried to stand or wait close to the bar was asked to move to the outside patio (again- it was still raining). They were told they "were in the way of the servers". Classy. Perhaps they would prefer an empty restaurant? Our server arrived and I am pretty sure she just had her lips done THAT DAY (did I mention we were in LA?) She didn't seem to happy to be working there (maybe her lips still hurt)  and was extra annoyed that we didn't order drinks with our meal. It took about 20 minutes to return with our food - which allowed me more time to observe the service going on at the other tables. One party asked if they could move the two empty seats from our table to theirs to accommodate their large party. They were told no, and the entire party was asked to move to the outside rainy patio. Seriously? Big lips finally returned with our food and could not identify which burger was which. In fact she couldnt even tell what kind of burger I ordered. We figured it out on our own and switched plates. Never saw the waitress again until she dropped off the check. Once I signed the receipt she returned promptly (before I had even left the table) to see what I left for a tip. Don't worry sweet cheeks - your lips will get paid for.  Final Grade: D+

Overpriced hipster food. I had the truffle burger, which was good. Not worth the $13 (I think it was 13, not sure) in terms of flavor or portion. I can't speak enough about how small these burgers are. With that said, this place does not deserve a 1-star rating. Their salty caramel ice cream sandwich was good and the waitress was nice. Overall the experience was underwhelming. Probably won't be coming back.

I had a horrible experience last night at Umami, my first time there.  I arrived before my date and asked the hostess if there was any seating because the place looked full.  She informed me that she couldn't seat me until my entire party was here, which was fine--many restaurants do that and I understand why.  But she said once we were all here there was lots of room on the patio (which I couldn't see).   My date pulled up moments later and the hostess asked if my entire party was here, which was strange since I had already told her I was only waiting on one person.  Whatever.  I said yes and she said she couldn't seat us on the patio, but gave no explanation why (no other parties had come in the time I was waiting for my friend).  She said she would have to seat us at the counter seating inside, as there were no tables available. In hindsight we really should pried as to why we would could suddenly no longer sit on the patio, but we said okay.  As we were sitting down I asked if she could please move us to a table when one opened up and she said she only do so if no parties were waiting for a table.  Wow, overbearing seating rule number 3 (they should really post signage to explain all the intracacies) but since it was so late we decided to take our chances and go ahead and sit down.  My date and I ordered water (we were really disappointed that the La Brea location didn't sell beer--our server told us it was because the owner liked having that location not sell beer).  Then 3 tables opened up at the same time, and my date got up to tell her we'd like to switch (no other parties were waiting, at this point was after 8:30 p.m.).  The hostess then told us that she could not move us because our server did not serve that area (which was approximately 6 feet away).  Wow, yet ANOTHER nonsense seating rule that I hadn't been told about when I was seated.  We hadn't even ordered food yet!  In hindsight, I should have stormed out or asked for the manager at that point, as I was very tempted to do.  But my date simply turned to our server and asked if she would serve us at one of the 3 tables that just opened up, and she said yes.  Neither the hostess nor server apologized or seemed at all concerned with how inconvenienced we had been.  The hostess then came over to us after the table had been cleaned and reset and told us that we could in fact move, as if that was a special privilege and we I can't recommend Umami unless you like disinterested staff with ridiculous seating rules.  I also can't recommend the food.  My date and I ordered 2 salads, a burger and fries.  My date also ordered green tea, to which the server responded "I'll see if we have green tea tonight" with no explanation of why they wouldn't since it's on the menu.  She then forgot to bring it until he reminded her.  The food was edible but not particularly good.  I basically ate it so the meal would be over and I could leave. I will say that neither the hostess nor our server were rude or snotty, they both were very neutral in their demeanor, but I swear I thought the hostess was trying to run us off with the way she acted like getting seated there at 8:30 on a Tuesday was a huge privilege and complex hierarchy of rules.

Had lunch here last Sunday.  Perfect day to sit on their patio and lunch with a BFF.  We both had the Port Stilton burger which was delicious, full of flavor but not over bearing.  We also had the tempura onion rings (eh) which i didn't think were that fantastic.  They lack seasoning, just even a bit of salt would have brought out the flavor of the onions more.  Only bummer about this location is they don't server beer.  That would have been the perfect addition to the greasy meal.  I completely understand their prices but $9 for a small burger is not something I'd do often.

Hype. That's all it is. I had the Umami burger and it was okay. I was disappointed that I did not care much for the flavor of the whole burger. My sister wasn't wowed either. And the bun was so greasy! How does that happen? Hubby had the port and stilton burger, though, and he loved it. I think the best thing we had was the sweet potato fries. And the glasses were pretty cool, haha. But I could easily pass on going here again.

My friend is a big fan of here, and she's been telling me how yummy the beef burger here is. However, I ordered the salmon burger, which I thought was healthy. The bread is really good, and the sweet potato chips are delicious. It's just salmon doesn't fit for burger. I should've had the beef burger. The interior environment is cozy and small, good service. Valet parking $2.5. I'll come back and write a follow up review.

Not my favorite dining experience.  It's completely overpriced and overrated.  Sure, the burger was good, the bacon was exceptional, and their special ketchup was really great.  But for prices like that, I expect more than just good food from a restaurant.  Our waitress spent most of her time hanging out and talking with the rest of the staff, which included her twin sister.  When she came to take our order, she neglected to mention any of the daily specials, and would not allow us to make any modifications to the menu items.  When my fiance asked for the Manly burger to be substituted with a turkey patty she said it was not possible.  Any sauce substitutions she said would have to be put on the side.  She then subsequently forgot our sides of sauce when dropping off the food.  When we asked for water, she only brought one to my fiance.  Our other beverages were $3 bottles of coke.  This is twice the cost of a soft drink from most restaurants, for 6 ounces less beverage, without refills.  But it was their interactive touch screen table top menu and gaming device that really demonstrated the company's commercialistic and money-grubbing identity.  The console had many games to enjoy while waiting for your food.  The only issue, is it would only allow you to play 2 free rounds before wanting to charge you to continue playing.  Their tagline for this charge? "Only $1.50!  That's less than a coke!" ... Well, it shouldn't be.

I drove past this place twice today. I wished I wouldn't have found it. It was on the Best Burger in LA Talk, but it won't make my list. Weird experience.It doesn't have the name on the door so it was hard to identify. A woman (not FOH material) in the parking lot that looked like the valet was actually the hostess, outside? She offered me a counter seat in an adjacent little room of the dining area which was cramped and had an ugly tile mosiac that gave me a headache since I had to stare at it. The menu looked good, the specials sounded good.  I ordered the Stilton (cheese) and Port (carmelized onions) Burger with tempura onion rings. When the Burger arrived it was tiny all by itself on a large rectangular plate. It looked like a big slider. The onion rings totalled 5 with a spoon of jalepeno ranch and a spoon of ketchup. They were greasy but otherwise hot and tasty. @ $3 that turns out to be $0.60 per ring = rip off. The Burger was good. My second to last bite tasted phenomenal so I get what the fans are talking about. I guees it took me that long to get over the shock that this burger was about 8 bites. I could eat 3 of these things if not 4. The server Jackie, was very nice and called me love so many times I was getting warm. On the bill she said "Thank" with a :). For a 14 dollar check, she gave me $1 & $5 bill for change. I had to go get change for a tip from the register...thanks love.

As you walk in the store you can smell the freshness of the newly made burgers. At each table there is a device that helps you play games and look at the menu. The food taste amazing, however I am only giving it 4 stars because it's a bit on the pricey side. Valet was $3 as well.

What to order: Truffle Burger - 5 stars Tater Totts w/cheese (on the special menu) - 3 stars Smashed Potatoes - 3 stars Icecream Sandwiches (Coffee Toffee) - 4 stars The burger was really tasty and cooked perfectly. Was it worth the $11? No. Was it good enough for me to come back? Yes. The sides were a notch too salty but tasty nonetheless. I got lucky when I went and only had to wait 15mins. The people after me had to wait about 45mins. I also found street parking. Otherwise it would have been $2.50 for valet.

This place was pretty good for a hamburger joint. I went there for the first time a few days ago and ordered the truffle burger based on the suggestion of a friend. It was delicious and you could definitely taste the truffle, but it wasn't overwhelming. My friends and I also ordered a plate of the truffle fries to share, which were equally amazing. My only complaint is that the burger was too small for the price. I wish that it had been bigger because I was still left feeling hungry afterwards.

This place is good, but not up to the hype.  The burgers have a unique flavor to them.  Can't really describe it, but they don't taste like other burgers - sort of a kobe beef texture to them.  The best way I can put it is that they taste kind of trendy and hollywood which is exactly what this place is all about.  The staff is kind of arrogant - not rude, but you'll remember that you're in Hollywood.  I don't think the burgers are as good as Father's Office, 8 oz, etc., although I think they are good.  I used to come here alot when it first opened, then kind of stopped going when it got more trendy and crowded.

Wow, this is my new favorite burger in LA!  I had the Manly burger with bacon, cheddar cheese, and fried onion strings.  The burger was ridiculously juicy, but a little rare looking for my tastes.  I didn't get sick though, so no problems there.  The burgers aren't grand in scale, but they make for a decent-sized meal.   I also had the onion rings, which were really fresh and extremely tasty.  I usually don't eat ketchup with my fries or onion rings, but I went buckwild on their housemade ketchup.  It was more sweet and less tomato-y which definitely sold me. Umami burger is so money!!!

I had their special, a lamb curry burger, quite delicious. The burger is pretty minimal, and it's kind of tough to shell out $11 for a burger without sauce, but delicious nonetheless. My group ordered fries and the onion rings. The ketchup they serve is delicious, but such a small amount. I really liked the fries, not sure what they fry them in or how they're made. The onion rings were ok, a little too much batter for my taste. I'd go there again, to try their other burgers, but only when I'm not completely starving. For $20 you just don't get that full.

I myself am not a huge burger person, but I know deliciousness when I encounter it!  My burger of choice was the Triple Pork Burger, being the huge swine fan I am.  My friend ordered the Port Stilton and we split the onion rings together.  It did take a little while for our burgers to come out, but nothing a nice catching up while sipping our fun hard-to-find sodas didn't help.   The service was very attentive and friendly so that was nice---no snobbery is rare it LA.  Granted, we avoided the dinner rush on a Thursday night so it was rather quiet.  Decor was clean yet had enough wood to warm/cozy up the setting.  My Chai Cola was quite yummy--something to sip instead gulp down!  The malt liquor tempura battered onion rings....um, I think the name says it all already.  It was great...greasy, yes...but last time I checked onion rings weren't supposed to be the healthiest deep fried appetizers.   The BURGER! We both had to savor the first bite and recover from the melt-in-your-mouth experience with our respective burgers.  My pork burger was intensely flavorful...i can taste the pork shoulder and bacon; baked tomato complimented it perfectly as it wasn't as acidic as raw tomato; the sparingly placed butter lettuce didn't overwhelm the burger unlike other burger joints; the bun was dense, buttery, soft, and slightly contrasting the savory burger and aioli.  My friend at first was worried her port/stilton was too rare, but all doubts vanished once she saw how juicy and flavorful it was.  Of course, my pork burger was not rare...as that would have been a horrible night and morning after for me! Several people seem to have a problem with the size.  Hmmm....and I wonder why America is notorious for obesity rate.  I say, "Quality over quantity!"  and this place lives by it!  However, there are those with (very) healthy appetites and I can see a burger here being just short of satisfying.  I think coming here without having starved, and expecting to satisfy your palates more than your hunger would be a good idea.   Such a stellar review..but why the four stars ey?  Well, just like those who complained about the size..I do have to half-agree because of the higher price tag.  The most inconvenient part about the price (worth every penny though) is that I can't please my palate with their burgers as often as I'd like...since I live a block away as well!  Another reason for the lack of star is the fries.  I'm a huuuge spud fan and deep fried spud at that...and their fries do not seem all that appealing.   Oh......don't even get me started on the ice cream sandwiches they serve from Milk! That's a whole new review...of Milk.  Let me just leave you with this : Grasshopper.ice.cream.sandwich.

I live close by and always see the place packed, so I thought I'd give it a shot. My wife and I ate the following: Umami Burger Hatch Burger Onion Rings Fries Thoughts on Food: as the rating states... "Meh, I've experienced better."  Everything was unnecessarily greasy and the Hatch Burger's chili's weren't spicy nor flavorful.  The Umami burger and catchup both tasted of "umami", but did it taste like a $9 burger?  Definitely not. Fries were good, but inconsistently so.  I'd say about 1/3 of them were undercooked. Onion rings were fair to good. 2 burgers, 2 sides, a couple sodas, tax, tip = $40. In this economy, not a good value.  Even in a good economy, not worth splurging for. Side note: ambiance was just okay.  A little too pretentious for a burger joint.   My advice: give bigger portions and try turning down the music

Umami Burger is certainly not worth the hype. The portions were a tad small, and at about $9-11 a burger, I've certainly had better. I had the Port and Stilton burger which was a bit too rich for my tastes, but still tasty nonetheless. The service there was very mediocore, almost poor. It took forever to receive our food, and while my Mother explicitly ordered an Umami Burger, and had even asked what would be on it, they gave her the wrong burger. They responded to our comment with a very uncaring attitude and simply walked off. Extremely rude. Save your money and get a burger somewhere else.

I've had a burger at Umami (on 9th and La Brea) and I don't remember what it was called but it had cheddar cheese and the most incredible bacon; I think they cut it themselves and if it were in jerky form I could eat a pound of it alone!  Anyway the burger was awesome; two meals worth in one.  Someone said they don't have diet coke but actually they have a European "Coca Cola Light" super cool; little bottle but what a treat.  Well, in my opinion it was worth the trip!

Bought into the hype and tried this place out.  I guess I went during a down time, because the place was pretty empty, but even then the service was pretty slow.  I think the servers were more pre-occupied with stamping the placemats than service. On tastes alone, I'd give it 4.5 stars.  The burgers (Hatch and Umami) were pretty impressive, as well as the sweet potato fries.  The skinny fries tasted like McD's.   The ketchup served on a little soup spoon is absolutely ridiculous.   I'm ok with spending $9 on a burger, but the feeling of being nickled and dimed just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. ...

This place lives up to the hype.  The burger is mouth watering good with its soft and toasty bun along with its rare patty.  The waiter stated their version of well done is equivalent to medium rare at most other places.  If you don't like your meat rare on a burger, this isn't the place for you.   The juicyness of the burger wouldn't be captured correctly if the patty was truly well done.  I had the sweet potato fries and tempura onion rings to accompany my Hatch burger.  The sweet potato fries were no different from any other place, but the onion rings were legit.  They also offer unique condiments per one side.   It should be a free for all on the condiments so you get to at least try them all.  If your on La Brea for any reason, it's a worth a try.

I found this place by mistake after going to Undefeated up the street. When walking in the place is pretty small. The three in my party felt crammed when we got seated in the very front by the door. After giving us our menus the host took off and after 10-15min I finally went up to the counter to ask if we ordered there and the guy rudely said no we have table service we just didn't think you were ready. So finally after ordering we got our food and it was alot smaller than expected and it was quite rare to my liking. The avg for each of us was 15 dollars and I don't think I would want to go back. The burger was good but not worth dealing with the staff and how small the portion was.

What a delicious little treat the Umami Burger is!  Perfect size, perfect taste, perfectly cooked.  My friend and I tried both the Umami Burger, the Port and Stilton Burger, and a serve of thick fries.  While we loved the Umami Burger, we were however disappointed by the Port and Stilton burger - too over powered by the stilton (and I love stilton!) - and the thick fries which we found to be too thick (tasted too much like potato not enough like crispy, fries).  However, we really did love the Umami Burger and I know we'll be back again for that.  It's a tiny place and very busy, we ended up on the side patio which was fine, but a little noisy.

A little pretentious.  Flavors were fine, but I'd rather eat any local hole-in the wall place.  Fries should have been better, being that this place has a lot of hype and it's a goddamn burger place! The burgers were way too small, and accordingly the prices dont' reflect what you are getting.  The seats are whack and the cupware is plastic?

I had their signature Umami burger. The burger was perfectly cooked, flavor of the meat just explode in your mouth. The crisp of the parmasan cheese crisp gives it that extra texture. Carmelized onion gave that savory sweetness all burgers should have. And oven roasted tomato intensified tomato tast matches perfectly with all other ingredients. All this for a burger less than $15, I would go again in a heartbeat  if I don't have to drive over an hour plus to one. Oh! Only reason I gave it 4* is there are many good burger places around, want to leave that star open just in case there is a better a place.

Caution! How good Umami is depends on the location. LaBrea location was A+ (best burger in LA is Manly Burger to me); but Cahuenga location was awful. We ordered three burgers and each of them was almost raw. We threw them away. Attention Umami management - fire the cook at Cahuenga. Give a bounus to the cook at LaBrea.

We have been to all of the Umami locations and this is the best one by far. And they have the fat french fries (so yummy!). You must get the ice cream sandwiches...all of the flavors are good, but the classic vanilla that is dipped in chocolate is my favorite. Service can be a bit lacking, but the food is always worth it.

Went here for the first time Thursday evening.  The burger is good, but I felt kind of gross after eating the whole thing.  I think it's a tad too heavy.  I  know that burgers are heavy, but the cheese tasted like they injected butter into it.  Also, the seating was too limited to be comfortable.

Overrated. I tried it out because everyone talks about it, but was definitely disappointed.  I had the truffle Umami burger with regular fries and a mexican coke. The burger was disappointing and not what I expected at all.  I'll stick to 8 oz.

Good burgers but way too expensive. and way too much attitude. They remind me of 25 degrees burgers but much smaller. Maybe they are a more sensible size but but when I pay $11 for a burger with no fries I expect to be full and more than satisfied and at Umami I was not. The fries we're nothing special and I liked the skinny fries better than their home cut ones. The onion rings were great, best item we had all night. I'm not a big ketchup user so I didn't care that they charge for extra. Also I don't get the hype on the ketchup, they say it's home made but you would never know by the way it tastes, it's regular ass ketchup period, nothing different or special, at least not that you can taste The host and our waiter were both super douche bags, very short and unfriendly. They seemed annoyed to answer our questions about the food, and not special requests, questions like "what is on the "Umami Burger" the menu just says "our signature burger"" every question was met with a sigh and a slow reply

Its a cute little restaurant. Valet for parking. $2.50. Food: I got water= the cup was so cute, i love how modern it looks Root beer= it came in the real glass bottle and the profits goes to a dog shelter, which is a plus Thin fries= they were yummy and it came with little spoons filled with ketchup which was cute Sweet Potatoes Fries= YUMMMY, i say a must try Onion Rings= tempura batter, it was good, some rings were too oily for me though My boyfriend and I shared burgers, we got a Umami Burger and a SoCal Burger: Umami Burger ($10)= not a fan of mushrooms so i took it out, so it was alright, but my boyfriend loved it SoCal Burger ($9)= i liked it more cause it had more sauce, and i like sauce since that equals to more flavor. The burgers reminded me of a Krabby Patty, it was cute and small and the burger was cooked with a circle cutter thing so they came out perfect looking. Overall the food was goo, the restaurant was nice, I would say to come try this place. Its not bad. The bill came out to be around $35/36 I think thats about right for lunch

Went last night to Umami for my first annual birthday burger.  I figured I'd get the self titled burger, and I was not let down one bit.  Super tasty meat, cooked to perfection.  My girl's burger was a little past medium rare, but mine was right on.  Had sweet potato fries, and onion rings.  Yum!  It wasn't a life changing experience, but it was pretty damn good.  I only wish that location had beer.

This place is definitely a new favorite. portion sizes are really small for the price but the flavor almost makes up for it.. i got the triple pork burger it had great flavor but pretty dry ( i think the the cook just had a mishap ) but i also got a Truffle burger and it was freaking amazing!! if it wasnt for the fact that the burgers are literally like 5 bites for me i would give this place a 5stars and id live outside their doors.. even the servers were a pleasure. My server was completely honest as to what wasnt her favorite and even if it was more expensive.. honesty, a quality i love in a server, not just one that tries to up-sale everything for her own gain.

I've tried three of their burgers: Socal burger, truffle burger, umami burger portabella mushroom version. The socal burger tastes like chilli cheese hot dog..not recomended. The portabella mushroom burger has no meat--NO PATTY but the mushroom tastes good. The mushroom was very flavorful with vinegar taste. The truffle burger is potentially awesome. The sauce is sweet and flavorful but NOT ENOUGH. If there was more sauce, it would be awesome. The cheesy tots lack flavor. The onions ring are really good. The salted batter gave it yumminess.

Got the Manly Burger at the Hollywood location and preferred this a lot more than the signature.  The bacon lardons are the key.  If you go to Umami, get this burger.  The only thing that disappointed me was the small size this time around.  It felt like I could've eaten another one.

Really great burgers and fries.  Love the house made ketchup. Love the concept. They need more turkey burger options since the only one on the menu contusions goat cheese and there are no substitutions. The service at this location leaves a lot to be desired. Very unhelpful hostess. We had a terrible server. I've also been to the Santa Monica location which is much nicer.

1) -- To begin, the parking was deceptively difficult. There were 3 open parking spaces and yet they were all blocked by a mini-van. Frustrating, right? There's valet parking for 2.50. F&%^ that. That's like a basket of french fries or 5 "gumballs" at their "gumball" machine. 2) ++ The guy that moved said mini-van in part 1) looked like the main character of "There Will Be Blood." 3) -- They had a gumball machine outside of their restaurant that actually housed small balls of dirt and wild seeds called "seedbombs." I bought one for 50 cents, thinking it was a gourmet chocolate ball, and almost consumed it. Thank god my companion, Janet Anne P., caught me before I ate it. Yikes. 4) ++ Turns out the "seedbomb" I bought in part 3) was actually a community project that helped develop wild horticulture in the concrete city environment of Los Angeles. Way to go Umami... 5) ++ I usually eat dry pasta for dinner and plain bagels for breakfast. Sometimes (I shouldn't be telling you this), I'll have wheat toast, plain, for lunch. So when I tried Umami's "Umami burger," my companion, Janet Anne P., thought I was having a small episode. A lot of unexpected flavor from a hamburger that had like 3 ingredients. All right, I'm impressed. 6) ++ I ordered some tempura onion rings, pretty good. Ordered fries. Pretty good. 7) ++ I can't stress enough how cool it was to be served by the main actor from "There Will Be Blood" - amazing presentation, Umami. Overall, that's like 4 stars right from the ++ and -- system I just made up. Way to go, Umami.

These are some amazing burgers.  The sides and desserts are great as well.   I would give five stars, except that I wasn't informed that the burgers are automatically prepared rare or maybe medium-rare.  I'm not a big fan of rare anything.  I'm not sure if you can request how your burger is cooked. Having said that, the burger was still one of the best I've had.  Don't hesitate to give this place a try.   It's also got very nice and modern decor and wouldn't be a bad choice for date night.

I know Umami Burger is supposed to be the beacon of LA, but I wasn't impressed. I love burgers. Having grown up in Texas, I learned to grill before cook so I'm a big fan of dead cow between two ridiculously large pieces of bread. I ordered the Umami burger as well as regular fries. Both were just ok. Not awful, but I certainly wouldn't drive to La Brea for them. To this day, I cannot even describe either. Uh... meaty for the burger? And, uh, potato-y for the fries? Sure, we'll go with that. Plus parking is a pain. I'm used to parking in LA being the equivalent of finding the Holy Grail, but it also adds another reason that I probably won't be going back.

I just recently went here and I must say, I was pretty disappointed. I have been hearing good words about this place, but my hype was no where near fulfilled when I was done eating. The first problem that annoyed me was my waitress. She was pretty terrible and very indifferent towards my friends and me. When we were ordering our food, she kept hurrying us up. Throughout the meal, she never checked on my table. 1 star for poor service! Now for the food. I got the manly burger, since I love bacon! My excitement went downhill after I took my first bite. I was pretty disappointed. Now, I am not saying that the burger was bad, but it was okay at best. However, their onion rings were amazingly good! For the price I payed, this place actually sucked. My friends, who have been to this place before, said that today was not a good day for them, so I will return back to Umami to give it another try. Hopefully, the service will be better! As for now, In-n-out and Pharo's Burgers are my favorite places to get delicious burgers.

I am a big fan of Travel Channel. I always watch the shows that can introduce me to amazing restaurants. I saw Umami Burger and heard that it was 'THE BEST BURGER IN AMERICA' and had to try it. I went over there last Sunday and was amazed to see how tiny the place was. I had such an amazing feeling about how much I was going to love the place (besides the neighborhood and the size of the place). I loved how there was a little digital menu alongside the paper menu. BUT, the games that were available on it were WITH MONEY? Um, as if the burger & not to mention sodas weren't expensive enough. So anyway, I started off with a THREE dollar diet coke bottle. I hate how they didn't have regular soft drink machines. When my diet coke finally came, I was in total awe! My drink was smaller than my hand. 8 oz. bottle for $3? Amazing, right? Then, I notice that the drink is EXPIRED. Not by a few days or even a week...over a month!! I then complained and got an orange crush instead. Now, I shall discuss the burger. The pictures of the burgers were beyond amazing. My mouth became so watery, I felt like a puppy looking at a juicy bone. I ordered the 'Umami Burger' and was so excited. When my burger came, the first bite was like heaven. As I reached the middle, there was this taste which I despise. The taste was so weird, like a hint of rosemary...or mint...something weird. Not to mention that my burger was pink on the inside. I did not complain though. The fries were so salty, but they were alright. After we left, we walked for a bit and it felt like the food was moving from side to side in my stomach..so weird! The weirdest part was that I was deathly thirsty for hours! It was really unusual. The worst part of all was that I was sick for 3 days. My stomach would not stop hurting, I got food poisoning. I cannot say that it was THE BEST BURGER, or even a good experience. I would not go back. I don't know how this place was rated the best burger in America. Maybe we went on the wrong day, in the wrong location and the wrong time...I don't know. But for right now, I would not go there again.

I was skeptical before going here. I don't like the word or idea of umami being a fifth taste. haha. Anyway, we came at a good time, because we were one of the first 5 tables seated. I was so excited to hear that they had cheesy tots as a special. I've only had those from the Grill Em All truck, and I love them. My party ordered the Truffle Burger (which I hear is a really tasty combo), the special Hawaiian Burger (came topped with a slice of pork belly!) and the Manly Burger. I shared the Manly Burger, and it was so juicy and flavorful. It was topped with beer cheddar cheese, smoked salt onion strings and a chunk of bacon lardon (don't expect your thin crispy piece of bacon - this is a chunk of bacon with fat layers in-between). I think I would have liked a thin strip of crispy bacon more than the lardon (which I dissected the leaner parts out of), but that's just me. The combination was so perfect especially with their soft brioche bun. The burgers are not huge, but for me, I could only handle half of one due to the richness. It's a good size for one person to eat though. The cheesy tots were huge balls of shaved potato and cheese deep-fried and coated with salt. OMG I couldn't stop, so I wound up eating 1 too many and felt sick. We also ordered the thin fries which were good but were left in the shadow of the tots. Next time, I want to try the steak fries since I think those are the Jenga-like fries in all of the pics on Yelp. I heard that the Manly was better than my friend's Hawaiian which had less flavor. It came with what looked like a pineapple salsa rather than a slice of pineapple. That probably didn't add enough to balance out the taste of the pork belly. Would definitely return though. There was a huge line of people waiting by the time we left at 1:30p on a Saturday.

Was driving down La Brea one afternoon and saw the sign for this place. I remember hearing about it from other people and thought, damn, I need to stop and give this place a try. The following day, I returned with 3 other friends and we were not disappointed. Given this location is very small, seating is extremely limited and you cannot be seated until your entire party has arrived. Since my friends are LA late, I had to sit outside in the very cold shade on the street until the group arrived. With that said, make sure you arrive with your friends so you aren't subject to sitting on La Brea hearing cars driving by whistling at you. When we were seated, the wait staff was very nice, accommodating and explained the menu to us very well. I had the Truffle Burger and it was AMAZING. Another person ordered the Manly Burger and didn't like the Bacon Lardons, which is basically chunky bacon fat. If you give bacon, make it bacon, not the fat. We also ordered the onion rings and french fries with Jalapeno Ranch, Homemade Ketchup, and Roasted Garlic Aioli. Each dipping sauce was fabulous and complimented the fries and rings. Next time I'm in LA, I'm definitely going here. The food is fresh and well seasoned. One of the best burgers I've had in a long time.

note to self:  next time, just do the burgers. sweet potato fries did not suit me...im somewhat of an affecionato. they are sprinkled with a type of brown sugar which made them too sweet for my liking. will skip these next time. will also skip the yellow twice cooked potatoes. they were pretty bland but the sauce the dish came with somewhat 'saved' them. more of an uneccesary filler. buuuut the burgers, will be back for these...perfect bun. I had the Umami Burger and the bf had the SoCal Burger. I enjoyed his SoCal Burger more than the Umami, but both were great. Now looking at their menu, they have many more burgers that were offered when we went. Can't wait to try the Hatch & Truffle Burger.

Two gal friends and I decided to go to Umami (finally) after hearing about how amazing the burgers and fries are. We're excited to go and pick the Umami on La Brea for dinner. Thin Fries Onion Rings Umami Burger SoCal Burger The Greenbird Thin fries and onion rings arrive within 10 minutes of us ordering. Then our burgers arrive. The Greenbird looks fine. So does the Umami burger - fine in terms of meat color. I ordered the SoCal Burger. It's like 25% redder than the Umami burger but it doesn't look crazy crazy red so I take a tentative bite. It's still red as I continue eating but getting towards the middle, it's CRAAAAZY red. So I stop eating and ask my friends what they think - do y'all think it's super super red??? They do. So I get up (there were no servers to flag down for the couple minutes I was looking) and head towards the cashier/kitchen area. I spot my server and tell her (politely) that I think my burger's a bit too red (to say it tactfully). It's obviously REALLY red. I ask her if it's possible for them to cook it a bit longer. She looks at it and then says that they're unable to cook it longer (I wonder why but don't question it) and offers to make a totally new burger. I ask her if I'd have to pay for the second one. She says no. And this whole time, she's wonderfully polite. I head back to my table and go, urgh, they're going to have to cook a whole new burger, so you guys might have to wait a little bit for me, as they're finishing their burgers up). Within like a minute, another server comes to the table and says, "Are you the one that wants a new burger?" I reply yes. She then proceeds to call me "darlin" and say that since I had eaten like half of the burger, she was most certainly not going to order me another burger. And continues on to say that if I want another burger, I'll have to pay for it. Her attitude is sharp, rude and condescending. And incredibly uncalled for. I state that my burger is super super red (obviously, as I got to the middle it was too insanely red for me to continue eating it). She responds tartly that it is on the menu that all burgers are cooked medium rare. I respond (still politely) that it looks like my burger is more just rare, not medium rare. She responds that it's Umami Burger's version of "medium rare." So yeah, this would've been a good time to point out that my friend's Umami Burger (which is SIGNIFICANTLY less red than mine is) is not the same red in any way as my burger (if all burgers are cooked medium rare as she pointed out) but I am in no mood to argue with her. So I say that I am most definitely NOT going to be ordering another burger and she goes away, with my half-eaten and very red, RARE burger. I'm like, seriously? Did that just really happen? Our server comes by with our bill and I ask her who that other server was that came by. She said it was "ERI* (whole name not written out of courtesy), the Umami manager." WHAT? In what galaxy would a manager treat customers the way that she just did??! Ok, I was NOT asking for a FREE burger. I asked for them to RE-HEAT my burger so it wouldn't be so RED. Her condescending attitude left me almost speechless. Seriously? You're going to speak that way to a customer in front of OTHER customers, too???! Insanity. What was the point of all that? Did she really think I was fishing for a free hamburger? I would've been MORE than happy if they would have just re-cooked/re-heated my burger. Or worst case scenario if they're unable/unwilling to do that, say they won't/can't politely. And that's it. Don't come by the table after a representative from your establishment (our server) has already OFFERED us a free burger and then RESCIND that offer. Plus that horrible attitude, crazy! Gah. I can't even tell you. Isn't one point of running a business to TRY to satisfy the customers (in a reasonable manner) so that they would hopefully want to return and would bring other (new) customers? This was probably the WORST restaurant experience I have EVER had. Her saving the restaurant the $10 for not making me a new SoCal burger resulted in three highly dissatisfied customers that left with the yuckiest taste in their mouths. And we're (OBVIOUSLY) not going to return to any of the Umami restaurants. People who have not-great experiences tend to tell their other friends about it. Was it really worth it to provide that level of HORRIBLE customer service? I would be appalled if I were the owner of an establishment that hired managers who responded in that manner to customers. A-P-P-A-L-L-E-D.

The Stilton burger was very tasty.  However, I am very partial to the Office Burger at Father's Office.  In my opinion, it just wasn't as good as the Office Burger.  The counter person was very nice.  There were about 4 customers at the time and the owner didn't take the time to greet any of the customers or suggest which burgers to try.  I felt a little put off by it.  I can understand it if the place was packed.  But he seemed indifferent to his customers. I also had heartburn and indigestion after wards.  Which is very unusual since I have an iron stomach.

The burger is pretty damn good, a little greasy though. The Portuguese bun is fantastic. I feel like we got shortchanged on the fries. The proprietor definitely loves what he does. He was happy to talk shop with us and the foodies sitting next to us. They also offer artisan desserts that are upscale versions of ding-dongs and Ho Hos made by the old pastry chef from Grace, I can't remember her name, oh yeah it's "Cake Monkey". Overall it was pretty good. I would certainly recommend it.

Way over-hyped.  We live in the neighborhood, so were excited to be able to walk over.  We'd been hearing so much buzz we decided to meet some friends there at 5:30 pm on a Saturday to beat the crowd. I ordered iced tea and was told they were out.  My partner ordered a Diet Coke and was told they were out.  No explanation, no apologies, no suggestion of another beverage.  How could a restaurant be out of something at 5:30 on a Saturday? When I ordered my burger, I asked for it to be prepared medium and was told they cook them medium rare.  Period.  That was my only choice.  I asked what was on the truffle burger and was told meat, cheese, truffle oil, and bread.  I ordered the truffle burger, and it was tasty, but at $11 for just the burger, I expected a bit more.  The four onion rings I got for an extra $3 were better than the eight french fries my partner got (also for an extra $3).  At the end of the evening, everyone shrugged and came to the same conclusion:  it was good, but... While the food was okay, the overall dining experience was infuriating and disappointing.  I really wanted to like this place, but I won't be back.  There are plenty of burger joints in this town.

I wasn't sure what to expect at Umami given the mix of reviews but my friend and I ventured there anyway on a weekday evening to test out their eats.  One word summarizes their burgers: Wow.   Burgers: My friend and I shared the signature Umami burger and truffle burger.  The Umami burger was amazing.  It was so juicy and flavorful.  Definitely a lot of depth to that burger and compliments on the bun as well because it was particularly perfect.  The truffle burger was also tasty, but less so than the Umami burger.  I guess I was hoping for a stronger truffle taste.  Anyway, I have been dreaming of the delicious Umami Burger ever since... (Burgers get a 5 star) Sides: Fries and onion rings are tasty as well and nice accompaniment to the burgers but similar to the other reviews, they don't give you that many.  However, after the heavy burgers you don't really need a plate full of triple fried fries.  (Sides get a 4 star) Desserts: We each had an ice cream cookie sandwich, which are brought in from Milk up the road.  Honestly I have to say standard.  Cookie was crunchy, ice cream was creamy.  A yummy sweet ending to our meal, but nothing over the top (like the Umami Burger).  (Desserts get a 3.5 star) Service/Space/Parking:  Service was friendly but a little odd at times.  Since we were splitting the burgers, we asked if the kitchen could cut them in half for us.  Our waiter responded by saying "It depends how the kitchen is feeling."  We laughed, thought he was joking, but he was serious.  The burgers came out un-cut.  No biggie, took 30 seconds to do it ourselves but just little weird.  Space is very small.  We got lucky because we went early on a Weds. night and snagged a spot in the lot and quickly got a table.  However, if you came here when it was crowded, parking and waiting for a table could prove to be quite miserable.  (I can't rate this one - too unpredictable) In short - I'm going back.  That Umami burger was heaven on a bun : )

I was surprised this place had a wait to get a table! We ordered almost all of the sides and the truffle burger and the pork w/ chorizo burger. The truffle burger was good but paled in comparison to the pork burger, which was so flavorful. I will definitely want to return for the pork burger, but am only giving this place 3 stars because I was not a fan of the sides. The pickle side is just a plate of carrots, beets, and pickles soaked in sour vinegar, and the fries and onion rings were surprisingly very bland. All the burgers are around $10, not bad at all for the price and I like the bring your own beer or wine policy (wine has a corkage fee).

I had a run of luck with Umami Burger, managing to stop by when they were totally empty and having a nice chat with the counter guy.  But alas, before I could write a review based on those two very pleasant experiences, I got a mouthful of the Attitude Special. I am an omnivore and will eat anything, even order multiple entrees and take them home for later -- that's how much I love food and love trying new things.  My husband, through no fault of his own, has a severe allergic reaction to milk and wheat.  (Gastrointestinal, not anaphylactic, but still nothing you'd want to mess with.) The first two visits to Umami Burger were great - tried the house burger and the Port Stilton special, and loved them both.  Lots of flavor, perfectly cooked, just amazing.  (And I like the Cake Monkey desserts -- really good chocolate, pure butter, yum.) Third visit, I called to check that they would accommodate my fella's allergy - basically, if they would sell us a $9 patty of meat with nothing on it.  Answer: "We don't do substitutions." Yes, well, that's the same answer you get at Father's Office, and even though they're 5 minutes walk from my house, we haven't been there in four years.  I don't care how good your food is, if you can't feed both me and my husband, then you officially suck. Luckily, I gave them one more shot, and they were apologetic about the previous experience, but there's always a chance I'll run into the Attitude Special again, so for now, they get 2 stars and not a prong more.

I can't say enough to describe my disappointment after visiting this burger joint. After hearing people rave about the burgers, I took my gf here last Tuesday. The waitstaff all seemed a little stoned and incompetent. We waited for a while to get a table. They took their time to ring up tables that were finished and even longer to bus empty tables. We thought maybe their bad service could be overlooked if the food was good. We ordered an Umami Burger and a Truffle Burger.  The burgers arrived and I have to say they were at best decent. They weren't great but they weren't terrible. Know before you go that all the burgers come out rare. The fries were also just OK. They come in a small bowl with a spoonful of Umami ketchup sauce. I personally wasn't a fan of the sauce and would have preferred plain ketchup. The one highlight of the night was the dessert. They offer ice cream sandwiches from Milk. The Coffee Toffee was delicious and I highly recommend it. So if you want an over-hyped burger with sub-par service, this is your place. The dessert is recommended, but also available over at Milk.

Everything on the menu are TINY. The burger is good but not awesome!!! I believe they put butter on the buns inside and out, that what makes it good, too greasy though. Plus it is a very tiny burger for the price that we paid, the cheapest is $9. For guys better order 2. The fries and onions ring are wayyyyyy overpriced, and it's not that special, the portion are tiny. This place is good to try, but do not come here often wayyy too expensive.

The menu is small, but they are serious about burgers.  I had the Manly burger, with beer-smoked cheddar cheese and bacon lardons - delicious.  You may think that you won't get full, but I couldn't finish mine and I like to eat.  The onion rings are amazing and they must make the ketchup in-house because it tastes very fresh and fruity, more like a marinara sauce than Heinz.  Parking is an issue, but the food is worth scouting around.  They don't offer refills on drinks other than iced tea.

FUCK Umami Burger. I went in at 8:30 on Sunday evening, while it was still busy but nowhere close to closing time, and I was looking to order a burger to-go.   I've heard so many great things about this place, and It is also in my neighborhood, so I was really looking forward to trying it out.  I go in there and ask to look at the menu for a to-go order, and the girl says "I'm sorry, we aren't doing any more to-go orders tonight," so I said "OK then, I'll sit," to which she said "No, we're not taking any more people tonight, we can't take any more people"  I couldn't believe it -- they couldn't handle one more burger on the grill?  ONE more???  Is this really something a business would say to any prospective customer during this economic climate??? The other thing is, come on, it's not like I was a party of 12 coming in 10 minutes before closing time, I was one dude looking to order a burger.  In my neighborhood.  At a place that I probably would have gone to once a week for however long it was in existence.  And would have recommended to several friends if it was as great as it seems.   As far as I'm concerned, Umami has lost thousands of dollars of mine and my friends and family who come to town. So basically, I walked away from the whole "experience" feeling shunned as if I were some dirty vagrant.  Sorry Umami, you "can't take on any more people?"  Well, I suppose I can't "take on" Umami Burger as a regular local place.   Umami has a great thing going on now, but I know from years of experience in the restaurant industry that no restaurant that treats people like this will ever survive long-term.  I give it two years.

Probably the best Burger I've ever had!!!  Miracle mile is slowly starting to get some great places.  Luna Park and now this?  Luna Park's Burger is also great.  You can build it however you want, which I like (try the Smoked Paprika Onions).   But, Wow!  Umami burgers are sooo tasty.  they don't serve booze though, so maybe stop at Luna Park first, have a few, then walk down to Umami

"Meh" is exactly the word for this place.  It's pricey.  It serves a decent piece of ground beef, but nothing I couldn't make myself.  The burger was FAR too salty, and I like salty food.  The fries were so pathetic, I almost can't stand to remember how much they cost.  (So I won't). I agree with other reviewers about their dumb "special ketchup".  It's probably just regular ketchup dressed up with chili powder, onion powder, sugar, and yes, more salt.  Most foodie patrons could probably figure out the recipe, except why would you want to? To add insult to injury, they have now opened a second location in Los Feliz.  Argh.

My husband brought me to this burger joint because I had a burger craving. It's small and nondescript, but the service was impeccable and the burgers ... well ... the best I've had. The fries were cooked to perfection - crisp & non-greasy.  My spicy burger was scrumptious and so much more than I had anticipated.  Even the valet guy was super friendly. Small, neighborhood joint that knows how to do a burger right.  Definitely be back!

BEST BURGER IN LA hands down! i never understood why people went to Pinks. I personally don't think they are THE BEST or worth the wait. however, I do think that this place is THE BEST and worth the wait. I had the hatch burger. although it wasn't spicy like I was informed and expected, it was still delicious. their buns have this sweet taste to them. a bit oily but it makes the burgers better. fries were ok, nothing special. if you havent tried this place, GO!! it'll be worth your $9!

Everyone has said everything there is to say about the food. It is great. How many ways can that be said. I do, however, want to take a moment to roll over a soap box and preach: The thing I DONT like about this place is the super LA hipster too cool for school vibe it gives off. The vibe place embodies everything that I hate about Los Angeles. I walk in and instantly, it feels like I need to have an iphone, a 5 oclock shadow, a tattoo and yelp account in order for them to serve me. I dont really know where I am going with this. I guess it may be an aesthetic disagreement with whatever designer carved this mold. I just wish it was more genuine. It feels forced. It feels like a place that was custom built to please foodies. I will be back, just not to the la brea one. It is off to silverlake for me. Oh yeah, and the valet parking here is so irritating.

I was very excited about trying Umami Burger once I saw it recommended on the Food Network by Giada.  The burgers looked amazing on my television screen and Giada seemed to love them. So I waited three weeks until I was in LA again so I could go and try this place.  I went to the one on La Brea around 11:30 AM on Monday, Feb 8th.  I was so excited, I told about 4 of my friends how amazing these burgers must be, even before I stepped foot in the place.  Boy, did I eat those words! I'm by myself, and apparently that means I'm also sub-human.  B/c I was immediately escorted out of the main dining room, which had 4 or 5 completely open tables, into the very small, tiled room with no tables.  It's a room with a bunch of chairs facing a wall about 6 inches from your face, with a tiny bar running around its edge.  After sitting down and realizing I would eating my lunch while trying not to chip my teeth on the tile wall, I asked to be moved to one of the open tables.   I was quickly informed that those were reserved for the customers "who were about to come in".  I said, "really, but I'm already here?"  And this manager, who is obviously superior to me in every fashion b/c he runs a burger joint in Koreatown and I'm just a lowly customer, tells me I'm a "single" and have to sit the facing the wall.   Now let me ask you this:  Which is more valuable to you as a business?  The customer who is standing in front of you paying $20 for a burger and fries and a drink (my total was $18.86) OR the "potential" customer who you don't even know for sure is walking through the door or not!!  I'm here......looking at you!  Wanting to sit at a real-person table in your restaurant!  And you're telling me to my face that the mere chance of a future gaggle of customers is more valuable than making this customer happy?!  Tell me that's crazy talk! This is a ludicrous policy.  And that guy is an asshole for enforcing it.  And the guy at the counter folding silverware knew it too!  As soon as the manager walked away, he shook his head in disgust and apologized to me for the other guy's behavior. So I refused to sit where they told me too and I should have walked away then, but I waited all this time to try this thing, so I took my order to go. And this is where it gets worse.  I finally get this burger and in the first bite I find a half-inch long piece of artery, or vein, or whatever right in the middle of the burger patty.  I nearly threw up........What exactly are you putting in this beef that would have pieces of vein in it?  I'm not a butcher, but I still don't think this is normal in any way.  This a premium burger, 10 bucks for ONE!  There's no excuse why this tripe was in my burger.  Did the manager guy put in there to f*ck with me since I complained about my seat?  He did in fact immediately walk into the kitchen after talking to me and stayed there......probably waiting to fix MY burger.  Crap!!  Sooooo disappointed! So to sum up, I was already pissed off before I even got to taste their burger.  I was sick after I bit into it.  And I felt sick most of the rest of the afternoon. My suggestion, skip Giada's recommendation.  This place isn't worth it on every level.   So thank you Umami Burger; you're exactly the reason why people hate eating at stuck-up, I'm-so-f*cking-cool restaurants in LA.  Never again.

First off - Umami is a Japanese word meaning "flavor" or "taste" (noun).[1] In English, however, "brothy", "meaty", or "savory" have been proposed as alternative translations. Came here with some 2 friends and we ordered 4 burgers to cut up and share. It's a small, cosy restaurant with valet parking. Street parking is possible but not easy to get. We ordered the Umami, Turkey Miso, Triple Pork and Truffle Burgers. Size - If you're a regular sized guy, 1 burger isn't gonna fill you up. The size chart kinda goes along the lines of a slider then Umami then a burger Food - JUST WOW, the blends of meaty, savory flavors are unlike any other burger I've tried in LA. Out of the 4, my personal favorite was the Umami, while my 2 friends preferred the Truffle and Triple Pork each. I wanted to order the skinny fries but the 2 votes to 1 said otherwise and the fat fries wasn't anything special. Service - The initial waiter that took our order was kinda nice albeit a bit curt. The waitress that served the food was quite rude and seemed to have an attitude problem. We got our fries and were waiting for the garlic aioli for a while so when we called her over and started to ask about it, she said "You mean this one???", placed it on our table and huffed away. Pshhh, whatever happened to service with a smile? Price - For an undersized burger, it is quite pricey. But the valet parking isn't too bad @ $2.50. Drinks - A cool thing about this place is they serve soft drinks made with real sugar cane which is a healthy alternative, according to this study - http://www.princeton.edu… All in all, it's a great place to experience and to tick off your LA to-do list despite the service and prices.

Since when did gourmet burgers become such an LA thing? I've frequented the various burger joints around town and Umami is really at the top of their game. The Umami burger is to die for. Who would've ever thought to put crispy parmesan in a burger. Yum. Beware of the line. For as long as this place has been open, the line is still off the chain. I find going at odd hours can be helpful.

Very very tasty burgers - the bun is awesome too.  But don't go if you are in a hurry - usually a wait for a table and 20 minutes or so to get your food. The bugers are cooked med to med/rare - so make sure to order well done if that's how you like it (the waitress won't ask you).   Tempura onion rings are really good.  The sweat potato fries were covered in some sugary seasoning - not so good. I'll defintely be back.

The flavor is definitely there! Ate here after seeing Giada on Best Thing... my friend and I are making our way around all the LA restaurants featured on the show. Burgers are small and over priced, and this place is totally overrated. We had to wait outside in the cold for about 30 minutes before we could be sat. I ordered the Truffle Burger, which was juicy and delish tasting. Boyfriend ordered the Triple Pork Burger, which was soo flavorful, however he complained about the texture. It was an odd texture for a burger. I think it scarred him 'cause he doesn't ever want to eat here again. Also, ordered the onion rings, which were good typical onion rings. I can't say if I will return. I don't like leaving dinner still kinda hungry, especially after paying so much. Although, all in all it was great burger flavor.

I could not wait to get there, after hearing so much about it, even on the food network "Best thing I ever ate" show. maybe my expectations were too high? My burger was fine, I got the Umami burger (with a mushroom slice and roasted tomato on it) ordered medium rare. My husband got the SoCal burger, ordered medium rare. Both arrive overcooked, totally medium, but we were on a tight time frame and could not send them back. They were fine, but not "wow" at all. The sweet potato fries were good, a little sweet or nutmeg like or something, pretty good. Our server was very nice. Oh, and got one of the 'cake monkeys to share too, one with banana and peanut butter. Just a glorified ding dong which was very average and cost more than a whole box of ding dongs at the market, skip the cake . Honestly, it was ok but the burger at Food fair by Diego is SO much better it's not even close, 8 oz burger bar on Melrose is better too.

We went to Umami Burger and we were disappointed. First, we were seated on the outside patio, which they did not ask whether to sit there or inside and just assumed we were okay with it. When we sat there, half of us were sitting in the sun with flies and pigeons. it wasn't the best atmosphere and it made the food less appetizing. The service was mediocre. They gave us the condiments when were halfway done with our burgers and almost done with our fries. They gave us an additional side of fries when we didn't order it (and they charged  us, but we eat it). Plus, they didn't care about giving us the food, and they just set it down on the table anywhere. They did not offer to refill our water. Although we did think the quality of products were pretty good, the burgers were just okay and were a bit overpriced. We will most likely not go back.

I have been passing by and seeing the hype surrounding this place with my own eyes for a minute now. I'm talking LINES. Fortunately when I came here the wait was only about ten minutes. But honestly after eating here I believe it would be worth an hour wait. Few things beat a good burger, and that's exactly what Umami provides, a good burger. I had the manly burger and I definitely give it my stamp of approval. Make sure you grab an ice cream sandwich for dessert, they're from Milk down the street and are incredible. On a scale of "good" to "ooooooooeeeeee!," it's a "hot damn! I want that again." Which in case you're wondering, falls somewhere in the middle...but I'll let you decide.

I went here purely on the guise of hearing great things on yelp.  Not gonna lie, the manly burger was very good.  And I'm usually the guy that likes his meat a little more done, but the medium rare burger won me over.  The bread/roll was spongy and delicious as well. However, my girlfriend's umami burger (we split our food) left something to be desired.  It just wasn't very good.   My last few complaints are more personal to me, and if these things don't bother you then don't take them to heart. The burgers weren't very big.  There were no fountain drink options and our waitress wouldn't refill our water for some reason.  I'm a person who likes to drink a lot with their meals, so this was very disappointing.   My biggest gripe was the price.  2 burgers, 1 side of sweet potato fries, 2 drinks: $40.  I'd like to come here again sometime in the future, but the amount of food to dollars spent ratio isn't very high here.

Whenever I hear the word "umami," my heart automatically leaps for joy! It's not just the food, but the entire environment and ambiance, as well. Everything, from food presentation to table arrangement, is so elegantly modern and classy that I feel most like a content Angeleno yuppie here. Burgers: 1) Umami Burger- Yum! Great flavor! My favorite part is the thin slice of hardened cheese in the middle that provides a unique and delicate texture. (I haven't tried this myself, but my food connoisseur roommate recommends adding the roasted garlic aioli to the inside of this burger's bun!) 2) Truffle Burger- AMAZING FLAVOR throughout and definitely a must try! (Warning: The juice in the meat sogs up the bread, which results in a mild mess.) Sides: 3) Sweet Potato Fries- My favorite sweet potato fries in ALL OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. YES, I SAID IT. They're good by themselves, with the ketchup, with the garlic aioli...just in your mouth! Splendid texture, taste and shape. I'd go back any day for them! 4) Tempura Onion Rings- I would pass on these. Not special, no flavor. I actually dreaded finishing the only one I ate. 5) Black and White Ice Cream Sandwich (from Milk)- SO GOOD and I would get this again in a heartbeat. Perfect texture and flavor all around. Everything you'd want in a great ice cream sandwich. I'd normally say a product like this is overpriced (at $4) but it was just so great that a cheaper price would diminish its quality (in my eyes at least.) Sidenote: Their cups for water are AMAZINGLY HIP. Made of clear bendy plastic, they're comfortable to hold and even have an indent as a cozy home for your thumb. GENIUS! Parking is only available through valet ($2.50.) Not bad as the lot is extremely small and I'd be terrified trying to maneuver my way around it. However, I did watch the employee park my car and noticed he drove extremely fast and parked jawbitingly close to the other cars, bringing a few nervous burns to my heart (or maybe that was from the burger.)

Hands down, BEST BURGER I HAVE EVER HAD. I was very very skeptical at first. Our group waited over an hour to get seated (granted it was a Friday night) and I was hangry (hungry+angry) to have this burger that everybody has been raving about. The place was much smaller than I imagined. They had maybe 7ish normal sized tables and a lounge area that didn't seat much more. We sat outside.. Let's just say the awesomeness of this burger still could not compensate for the ambience. But hey, it's a burger joint, so I honestly didn't care. Moving on the the good stuff; I got the classic umami. It was sooo juicy and savory. I was OBSESSED. The roasted tomatoes really made it flavorful, and the meat was just.. again, JUICY. Never had a juicy burger like this, just squeezing it a little made the meat drip. It was awesome. Didn't quite taste the parmesan crisp though. My friend got the "Manly Burger," but she didn't like it. The cheese really did taste like beer, and apparently it had the same icky aftertaste. It is an acquired taste, so for people who don't like beer, you should probably stick to ordering the classic. Sweet potato fries? I had better, but it was still good. The onion rings were really good--above average for sure. Hope this was helpful!!

Of course it's a tough call with local burger spots, but Umami defies the competition. I had this on Saturday, and it was nothing short of extrordinary. The burger was completely juicy and flavorful, and even if I only got like 7 fries, thats ALL you needed. Extremely friendly staff, and the prices are a little high, but damn well worth it. Stop reading, and go have their Umami Burger!

They may have authentic burger but their service is snobby and I did not appreciate that.  They are located behind my house and great to see that their business has been growing rapidly though.  Pricing is TOO MUCH!   The burger joint cross the street had the better burger to be honest (You should try their turkey burger sometimes).  So I realized that name of the restaurant really made difference for many people.  I would good quality grind sirloin steak and make my gourmet burger at home with the type of service.   For fries, you can cut potatoes dip in club soda and corn starch to make the crispy sweet potate fries.

Came to Umami burger for the first time because all my friends talk about it and give it so much Hype for the burgers. Came around 3 on a saturday not knowing anything but hearing that the burgers are amazing. First off parking wasnt really trouble parking in residential. Second i didnt mind waiting about 10 -15 min to sit inside with my friend. But looking at the menu my jaw almost dropped because of all the prices for everything especially everything is priced seperate so no meal. Then i was very displeased that there are no substitutions on the burgers either. Customer service was decent, but only payed attention if he thought we'd need a refill or should i say pay another 3.50 for a glass bottled coke. For what i payed for the burger which was incredibly small for 10$ with fries being 3.00 everything was way overpriced. My burger was dripping small amounts of blood too guess it wasnt as cooked as i thought and i wasnt asked how my burger was cooked. This place is terrible

While the burgers were flavorful, juicy and served rare, I didn't like how the burgers had one overwhelming flavor in them. It didn't have a balance of the five tastes, which I believe all good foods should have. The restaurant's name is Umami,  so I guess they are doing a good job at making sure all their foods exude with its namesake. Even the ketchup was had more umami flavor than sweet or tangy, but I loved it. I went here once, and craved for it again soon. I think I was thinking mostly about the hand cut fries and the ketchup. I also like their onion rings, despite it being oily.  They don't have a liquor license, but I guess that keeps the tables turning, which is good because there is always a wait. They make up for it with a large selection of sodas though.They also have Milk's ice cream sandwiches here, which I personally love. Parking is okay. There is some street parking available, but most of it is restricted. I believe I had to pay for valet.

this place is good, but i dont understand the hype. for what you pay, you get very little to eat. i'm not saying that their food isnt good, just in my opinion, not worth the price.  i came here before i started hearing everyone talk about the place and im left feeling like i missed something? my experience definitely wasnt even close to whatever people are raving about additionally, the service was pretty slow and we had to wait a long time (maybe that added to my disappointment? long waits are supposed to signal amazing food arent they?) They get five stars for creativity though, their burgers certainly are unique

The hipster hype around this place is unbelievable. I really wanted to like this place, I really did but when I finally bit into my first Umami burger the taste of regret quickly hit my tongue. $11 for a small mediocre burger? I've had better burgers at fast food joints. Here's the thing about why Umami is so popular. You grab an idea, like a burger place, you put it in a dirty part of town BUT you raise the price on it, you throw in some imported beers no one has heard of, throw tattoos on your servers and tell them not to ever shower, throw words in your menu like "Organic", and BAM! you got yourself perfect bait for Hipsters. Of course these Hipsters think this is the best burger in the world and start blogging about it and build a hype because they want to be the person who "found" this gem and introduces everyone to it! Sadly when an LA born and LA raised Angelino, who has been here since birth and actually remembers Echo Park being dangerous, not the next big hang out, actually wants to believe the hype and thought that maybe these people are on to something, but then realizes he just spent $50 on two sodas, two burgers, and two orders of fries that are nowhere near the title "The Best Burger Ever"....

so i was so excited to hit this place up after hearing all the hype. i guess i was expecting too much? but got the manly burger, which had onion strings, bacon, and beer cheddar cheese on it, med rare, along with sweet potato fries with garlic aioli. the burger was aiight. i thought it was way too cheesy and there were clumps of bacon that made each bite very uneven in flavor. the sweet potato fries were excellent. also had the peach green tea, which was refreshing. all-in-all, i thought it was ok, but for the price and hype, i was hoping for more. oh well.

One of the best anywhere.  You know it's good when your not even hungry at the time and think still think so.  Memorable chewy bun.  Nice touch with the U stamped on it.  Will come back next time in town or the SF outpost.

The burger was actually very good, but very good isn't $24 for burger, fries, and an un-refillable ice tea.  I'm going to guess it is more for the people that want to fill their egos rather than there appetite.  I'm not knocking it's quality more the actual worth of the meal for it's price.  I got the truffle burger so maybe it had actual truffles in it.  I could have gotten away with a $10 burger I suppose, hehe.  I don't see this as being able to function outside an area where there is a high density of people worried about who you know versus actual worth.  Very smart marketing plan.  Give it a name that sounds Jananeezy and in the back of everyone's mind they'll be thinking there's got to be something Kobe about this beef, haha.  If it was at least a sophisticated restaurant, then maybe you are paying for the ambiance created, but it's really a fast food joint with slow delivery.  I can tell you as someone who knows a little about the restaurant biz, that the difference in price with using top meat doesn't make the hamburger triple in price.  That is only one small part of the total cost of delivering that burger to the table.  Great concept though.  Give the people what they want and they'll keep giving you their money=)

Myself and two friends were eagerly awaiting trying this restaurant, as we have seen umpteen great reviews and were super pumped.  I ordered the Umami burger the way it came, my friend ordered the SoCal burger with skinny fries, and my other veg friend ordered the veggie burger with fat fries.  Here's the summary: this place is a victim of overhype, as having such high hopes resulted in a big letdown.  The "five senses" they speak of basically can be summed up in one: SALTY.  Everything is so sodium-laden, you'll have to drink like 5 glasses of water upon leaving or you'll have serious gut rot (which 2 of us had anyway).  On the Umami burger, there is so much ketchup that you can't taste the meat, and on the SoCal burger there is so much cheese (same result).  Also, the bread is saturated with butter and the burger, in general, is oozing with grease. Note:  you might want to consult your doctor before dining here.

I finally had a chance to try this "world famous" burger place after hearing so much about it.  My first impression was less than stellar because of the service.  The two servers in the outdoor area were having some issues with more challenging customers who were demanding things left and right leaving me in the dust.  When I finally placed my drink order, it took a good 10 min to receive it and to place the food order.  Once the food arrived, my worries were forgotten.  I tried the Greenbird since I don't eat read meat and my bf had the Truffle burger and thin fries.  We also tried the following conditments: Umami Ketchup (too sweet), House Spread (tastes like Thousand Island), Jalapeno Ranch (delicious) and Roasted Garlic Aioli (my 2nd favorite).  We both loved our burgers and thought the fries were ok.  Keep in mind that you are not going to get some huge burger that will leave you belly up for hours even though you are paying an average of $10-12.  Good first impression minus the frazzled staff.

Had to see all the hype about this place and that's all it is. It gets 3 Stars  in my book.  It's true, the meat is fresh and super juicy....it squirted all over the place so be careful!  They give you a good quality napkin because of this...lol.  So although the meat is good and the bun is soft, the overall flavors didn't really cut it for me.  I forgot the correct name for the burgers, but I ordered the green burger and my date ordered the cali burger....he agreed also that the burger's overall flavor combination lacked....and in addition so did the side sauces.  We tried the jalenpeno ranch....not spicy or ranchy at all, their homemade ketchup did not go well with the sweet potato fries which were too sweet for our taste....wayyy to much brown sugar, and the dijon mustard was like wasabi! This aint no sushi joint.  After we left, we went back home and ate some more because the burgers were not filling...and I'm a small girl! 5'1, 95lbs. We would have rather spent that cash at Red Robin with unlimited fries!!!! Probably won't be coming back here, unless I see Topher Grace inside again (: That was the best part of Umami Burger...and my lovely date of course!

Yum, yum, yum, yum! Delicious, juicy, fresh! The bun is super soft and a tad sweet. I had the Triple Pork burger and it was deeeelicious! I wanted another! We ordered a side of onion rings and fries. The server didn't ask us what kind of sauce we wanted and just brought "umami ketchup" and it was bland! French fries.. I don't see the hype. Yes, they are unusually large and take much more prep time to cook but it was super crispy and for 6 pieces of  fries, it didn't seem worth 3 bucks. OH! and they bring the ketchup in a little asian spoon which TOTALLY wasn't enough sauce. The onion rings were good.. but for 5 pieces for $2.50? EH. You have to eat them right away too. If you wait until you finish your burger, they will be soggy by then. My burger had chorizo in it and it was so juicy and had the right amount of spice. The pimento aioli was a good idea but not well executed, it lacked seasoning. LOVED the bun. Beware, the burger, although normal sized, eats very fast! lol. I practically swallowed the thing! My boyfriend had the Port Wine and Stilton burger. Super juicy too. Cooked medium rare. Real stilton. Yum. I think next time we go I'm ordering the pickle plate. It was great! So coming back again! while we were eating, we could see in the crack of the curtain, one of the cooks grinding the whole tenderloins in house. No wonder those burgers are so freaken tasty!

this place is iiiiite.... nice and clean minimalist decor with butcher paper stamped with the umami logo on the tables. When you've had so many burgers, sometimes there's just no way to describe one. It's true for Umami. I can't really describe it. I could tell you that the meat was great. It's a thicker patty cooked to about medium rare by the restaurants standards (although they will cook it to your preference if you ask them). I'm a huge fan of thick cut fries so I don't have any complaints. It's like biting into a fry and getting a baked potato. Umami also serves "real" soda's. Yes they have coke, but coke in a bottle... from mexico, as well as other bottled favorites such as Crush Grape & Orange. I treated my dad to a ding dong (like the hostess cake) made with peanut butter and marshmallow. He said it was great, i'll take his word for it because it sure did smell good. It's a great place to try btw valet is $2 for this place. It tends to get filled up 6/7ish and the wait may be about 5-10 mins for a table to free up. Good to try, but I'm not too big of a fan of burgers for it to be one of my favs.

My daughter in law chose this place for lunch while visiting in LA.  I read the reviews and ordered the Umami Burger cooked medium, minus cheese and catsup (only McDonalds , etc. put catsup on a hamburger. I did ask for mustard and was told they would bring me some, but didn't. The burger was small and overcooked and had more gristle than the chain burgers.  I ordered the tempura fried onion rings because they were raved about by other reviewers and because the french fries were previously frozen (not fresh hand cut) - go figure.  They were greasy, and at least one of them had some of the batter that didn't get cooked.  from what I have read, I will go to In and Out burger if I ever get back to LA.  I certainly will not return to Umami.  This visit confirms my belief that NO BURGER IS WORTH $10.

I crave Umami burgers. They are that good. My favorite on the menu is the Port and Stilton Burger, but I love it when they have off-menu items, such as the Pastrami Burger or the Hawaiian Burger. The burgers are always amazing and very consistent. The sides are great, my favorite are the smushed potatoes and sweet potato fries. If the world were ending tomorrow and I had to choose a last meal, it would def be several Umami Burgers with some potatoes and a Mexican Coke.

Umami burger is good. Plain and simple. It's not, oh-my-god-I have-to-have-this-every-day, but it satisfied my need for burger goodness. I will admit, I'd been wanting to try this place out for a while. Their burgers are cooked to perfection, and need no altering whatsoever. They're just right the way they are and adding anymore sauce or removing a tomato slice from this carefully constructed burger would be sacrilegious. If there's anything to complain about, it's that this place it too uptight. When you walk in, it's impossible not to notice how hard Umami burger is trying to be different. There's a fine line between being intricately unique and being snobbish. They've crossed that line. I'm a simple gal. I don't mind squirting my own ketchup onto my plate in a disorganized blob. I don't need it brought to me in an Asian soup spoon. Just sayin'. The fact that they charge extra for french fries and tempura onion rings (which are delicious by the way) does not impress me. In the end though, it's all part of the experience. I can see why so many people love this place. I wouldn't mind going again.

But-tah. That was the burger. Hot knife. That was my moufff. That's what it felt like to eat a burger at Umami's.  After reading the reviews, I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Oh man fussy was right. I had the triple pork burger, while my partna in crime had the signature umami burger. BTW a great way to get to taste two burgers in one night is to make sure you bring people who are down to share the love. Both burgers were neck-n-neck for the most part, but I think the umami signature burger made a desperate dash at the finishline and took the prize with the shitake mushrooms. Serving size was almost perfect where the burgers weren't huge and sloppy. SERVICE!... was awesome. The staff were friendly, helpful, and enthusiastic about their food, which I love. The place was clean and cozy. We didn't have to yell over other people to talk. They claimed to carry any type of soda we could think of and I believe them. Plus I think I saw a couple of actors and musical artists that I couldn't my finger on, which might add some excitement to your eating experience. 4 Stars Umami!

If you are craving a BURGER - Umami is not the place for you.  Their burgers dont taste like HAMBURGERS, but they are yummy none the less.  I was disappointed that the were out of french fries when we got there and strangely enough they were also out of pickles... even though a table who ordered much later than we did got a nice place of pickles.  Steer clear of the tempura onion rings, greasy greasy.  Dont get me wrong - the "not burgers" were delicious, and the service good.  Go when the wait is less than 45 min...

my bf and i came here on a saturday afternoon after failing to get into the food festival because the line was long enough to circle los angeles three times!! so i pulled out my handy dandy blackberry and yelped some yummy spots around the area. Umami burger popped up as a close destination and next thing ya know! Here we were! the wait was about 15 minutes (not too shabby ) and we weren't quite sure what to expect. the thing that was going through both of our minds, was what is a umami burger anyway? unfortunately we still don't know! haha!! anyway we got seated in the middle of this tiny room (yes im claustrophobic) and I felt really awkward. our server was pretty nice though~ very attentive and a good sense of humor! i ordered the turkey miso burger, which was super juicy and filling but a tad too salty for my taste. My bf got the hatch burger, which was filled with green chilli peppers i think? and he said that it was possibly one of the best burgers he has ever had! wow!! We also got 2 orders of the skinny fries which kind of tasted like Mc donalds fries to me.. By the way, all the burgers are cooked medium rare! Overall I thought the food was A-OK! my boyfriend probably would have gave it 4-5 stars though maybe I should get him to sign up for a yelp account instead of being a freeloading yelper! haha just kidding

Let me start off by saying i love burgers, so I was extremely excited about trying this place. Usually yelpers are right on point with their reviews. Unfortunately, this time the reviews were an epic failure. The bf and i had no problem with the wait or service, as other yelpers have complained. We both ordered umami burgers ( mushrooms, grilled onions, "special house ketchup"), steak fries, beer battered onion rings and pickles. All were disgusting. This is the first time I have spit out my food in a restaurant, twice. The pickles came first. Disgusting. What the heck did they pickle them in? Urine? Then came the burgers. Thank god bc I needed to get the pickle taste out of my mouth. The burger bun was soggy with ketchup. In a desperate attempt to cleanse my pallate, I bit into it. It came right out onto my napkin. An overly sweet combination with soggy bread, rancidness..lastly the fries and onion rings. How can someone possibly mess up fench fries. By forgetting to salt them. The beer battered onions had potential. But were flavorless. I felt like i was eating sponges. To add insult yo injury, our tab was 40 bucks and our sodas were warm. Umami burger FAIL.

Sooooo, after seeing Joan Rivers down at Hollywood Blvd, which I was really excited about, we went to Umami Burgers because apparently, this place is overlyhyped (on yelp). Upon arriving, I wasn't aware that it was an actual restaurant-restaurant! I was imagining a diner, but it instead, it was a modern/contemporary restaurant. I would give this place a 2.5 out 5 stars.  I gave it a full 3 because the customer service was excellent, but I was anticipating a really gooooooood burger. I get it- the burger hits that Umami taste bud, and they claim that its something I will "crave". It was, however, very moist, and my Filipino instinct kicked in when I saw that the beef patty was still pink in the middle. I was terrified and worried I was going to be sick; I was picking out the noticably uncooked parts of the beef. Im aware that its supposed to be like a medium rare, but I'm just not used to it. But, I guess I'll come back. I do like how moist the burger was, and thats basically all I look in a burger.

After hearing much review about this place, i finally check it out. My friend and I went in a lil early before dinner, and there was no line. We order the truffle burger and the umami burger. Both was one of a kind burger. As we begin eating our burger the line outside start to pile up. We were glad we didn't have to deal with that. I would give this place a 5 star, but the water cup they gave me still had a lipstick stain from previous customer, and it wasn't quite enough to fill my stomach. Will i come back? Yes, but not when im starving..

I went there alone today after visiting my chiropractor nearby and wanted a treat after all I've heard.  I was given a seat at the counter which i tested out.  It was a plain walk in closet with no view of anything.  I felt claustrophobic so I asked the hostess to give me a table. Now, this is 12:15pm with 60% of the seats empty. She told me that they get real busy. I left. . I had go to eat up the street and came back 20 minutes later, there were still empty seats.This was only 9/4/2011, so that you folks know who the hostess was at that time. In addition to those who say the food is mediocre, there are so many incredible burger places in L.A., - both joints  and gourmet places - why go to umami?

Ok, so not to offend anyone but this place was just alright. Being a lover of all things burger, I went here with fellow co workers. I am notorious in checking my yelp for helpful reviews. Man it's hit / miss y'all. I order the manly burger - there was nothing manly about this burger- It had the accompanying house sauce. Ugh! Pickle, dill - thousand island- not. I heard the onion rings were good so I got those. The first three were good, the rest tasted of oil.  A friend got the earth burger-  edamame & beet patty- surprisingly tasted better than mines. Annoying .50 charge for extra house ketchup. It was weird, Heinz is alright with me. Next time I'll take the gang to In & Out it's way better and cheaper.

The burgers are good but........no substitutions are a bummer and the most annoying thing is that the waiter brought me my change but did not actually give me any coins back....he said "it is their practice not to give the change back because they don't carry alot of change."  He also said a lot of restaurants do that.... I have to say that has NEVER happened to me even in the most expensive restaurants.  It seems like when a restaurant gets a lot of hype the quality starts to go down...that is certainly the case here.

Meh. Had been wanting to go here for a while since a friend recommended it and I noticed it had been getting lots of coverage here on Yelp. We ordered the Umami burger and the Port/Stilton burger. I preferred the Umami burger - quite flavorful and moist. For me, the Port/Stilton burger was too salty, but if you're a big blue cheese fan, you'd probably like it. The fries weren't bad - they were thick cut and crunchy outside, soft on the inside. But that Umami Ketchup they get served with tastes like canned tomato soup. Would definitely prefer regular old ketchup. I actually quite like the onion rings, although, as mentioned in reviews below, they are big and have a lot of batter on them, but the fact that they're cut thick as well balances out the batter. We brought our own beer and weren't charged a corkage fee. Our waiter was very sweet. It was the first night they were serving on the patio, and I think it may have been our waiter's first night, but he was friendly and helpful - he pushes up the rating 1/2 a star for food that was just ok.

I'm not a fancy burger kinda gal. I thought Father's Office burger didn't live up to all the hype, but I loved the ambience. I prefer In-N-Out over that $13 burger any day. But I just had to try Umami. I love food, and I felt like I was the last person in the world to try an Umami burger. Silly me didn't bother to check whether or not this location had booze. They didn't. GAH! Oh well, if I'm throwing down $15 for burger, it might be best that they didn't serve alcohol. My cousin and I both ordered the Pastrami burger. It's a special, and not on the menu, but our server (who was so damn HOT by the way!) said it was amazing. We also got an order of sweet potato fries and the malt vinegar onion rings. They both came with a side of Umami's own in-house made ketchup. The pastrami burger was INSANE. It's not your normal pastrami, it was pretty lean, but it was thick cut, I'd say about a 1/2 inch piece. With a burger so small, I needed a little bit more meat. Every bite was FANTASTIC. The beef was such great quality, too. And the cheese, wow, it was just perfection. Now I'm not a fan of relish, but I had the burger with the relish so I can get the full effect, and it was, well, perfect. I hate relish! It cost a pretty penny, $15, but most of the burgers are at least $11 anyway, plus ours came with a big ol' piece of pastrami. What up! The fries were so awesome, light and not greasy. Although not a huge fact, they were cut into the tiniest pieces! The onion rings were kind of a rip off, but I LOVED them. It came with like 6 rings, some pieces are large, some were pretty small, but if it came with twice the amount, I'd be much happier with them. The onion rings had just enough malt vinegar taste and were nicely fried, not greasy. Also, the onion was cooked perfectly. Service was great! Food came out so quick and the servers were friendly. Didn't hurt that pretty much everyone who worked there were good-looking. It's a small location, but you have to come early I guess, because by the time we left, around 3, it was getting packed. Valet is a stinkin' $2.50 but it's worth it. No one likes parking their own cars in L.A.

this place is pretty good, but it's no father's office. i came here with a friend a little after one and didn't have to wait too long to get a table. we ordered the cheese tots, and split an umami burger and a manly burger. the umami burger was pretty good, smaller than i thought it would be. the manly burger was ok, but overly salty; i was parched by the time i finished eating it. i thought i would still feel hungry after i ate, but instead i was at the just satisfied point, on the border of overly full. the cheese tots though... tater tots with cheese? genious!

Love their burgers and not to mention their sweet potato fries. I usually get their hatch burger (medium rare). The burger has a kick to it in your mouth and the meat is not fully cook and a little rare. I think that it's important for the texture of the meat be chewy and soft, which Umami brings. If you don't like your meat  70-80% rare then you can probably ask for medium and it'll probabaly be cooked 50-60%. Their sweet potato fries are yummy! It's thin and sprinkled with sugar.. Their regular fries are thicker and spinkled with a little bit of salt. I would def prefer the sweet potato fries over their regular fries. Their ketup is not the typical ketup you get at the grocery store or fast food restaurants. I think they make their own ketup at the restaurant. Their burgers are pretty small but it is def filling. One time when I came to Umami, I noticed that a couple ordered 3 burgers and split one so each one got 1 1/2 burgers to eat. It is pricey (approx. $10 for a burger) but you can't get the flavor that you get here at Umami at home so you pay for that experience. I would def. not recommend Umami to those people who eat alot or who likes their burger certain way. I took one of my friend and her boyfriend here. My friend's BF wanted to add lettuce and tomatoes in his manly burger, but let me tell you.... They will NOT add any ingridient because it will take away the "umami" which is the flavor you get in your mouth. You can't add but you can take away ingridients in your burger. Make sure to bring cash for your valet and don't come too hungry ( you might have to wait 15-30minutes when it's busy ).

Really unfriendly service.  I went there in the spring.  Just wanted to sit and have a quick lunch but because I was alone I wasn't allowed to sit at table for two.  By the way, the room was almost empty.  They were expecting a lunch rush but it hadn't started yet.  But the hostess said that's the rule and that I needed to sit at the counter in a small side room where they had stashed a young couple and a baby.  I didn't want to stare at a wall so I just asked to get my burger to go and while I was waiting they even gave me a hard time about sitting at a table by the counter.  They asked me to go wait outside!   I am a soft spoken single woman but I said politely that I would not sit outside for the five minutes it took to cook the hamburger.   It's disrespectful.  I won't  be going back.

I read the reviews on here and on thrillist about Umami, so I decided to find out for myself.   It's been a min since I've had a really good burger.  The place is small, but my friend and I were seated right away.  I could imagine the line drama for people waiting, especially for parties of 4+.  We went with the Mexican Coke & Root Beer.  I've had the Mex Coke before so I knew it was good, but give the root beer a shot, it's pretty good too. I ordered the fries and they came stacked like a Jenga tower (about 5-6total).  My friend ordered the onion rings and they did tasted like a better pairing.  Ok, now for the burgers.  I ordered the so cal burger.  The patty was seasoned pretty well.  The meat just crumbled with each bite.  It was a little more greasier than what it appeared like after being served.  Half way through the burger, my bottom bread was saturated to the point of non-existence.  I think it could have been cooked better, but I liked it enough to scarf  it down.  My friend ordered the Umami burger and said it was really good.  It looked better than mine, so I believe him!?  2-sodas, 2-burgers, 1-onion ring, 1-fries = $31 (not including tip).  I really want to give them 3.5 stars.

In my opinion the absolute best burger in LA. Soooo flavorful. Yet simple. This is a burger that doesn't need a lot of frills. I've had almost every burger on the menu and I think they are all awesome. Plus, the thick cut fries are amazing. Downside - prepare to wait a good 20 minutes for a table and don't expect to stick around once your done eating. There is definitely a "come, eat, leave" vibe going on here, but I don't care - the food is totally worth it. The restaurant is really small and there aren't a lot of tables - but wait it out. There is another Umami on Hollywood and you may be tempted to go to that one because the restaurant is a lot bigger, looks much cooler and seems good for groups - but for some reason the burgers and fries just aren't as good. So stick out the wait at this location. I've gotten take out from here as well, but I must say the burgers don't travel as well. Definitely eat in.

My wife's burger was served completely RAW inside! When we notified the waiter he said, without even looking at the burger, "It's completely normal, all our burgers are served medium rare.". This burger was not even close to medium rare, it was completely and totally (bright red) raw inside. It became obvious the waitstaff are programmed to say this to customers without even looking at the burgers. Will never return. Stout's burgers are much better..

Father's Office keeps being recommended to me as the best burger. I had it, it was good. The Umami Burger was better. They put some type of seasoning on the meat and some type of mushroom on top of the meat that really adds a subtle flavor that is incredible. The buns are fantastic. If I can find out where they get their buns from, I'll be there.  Very small place, so I'd recommend getting there before noon. Staff was friendly. It's a simple place with little ambiance..I don't think you'd really go there to hang out and have a beer. The food is the highlight., however the crowd was very easy on the eyes. The iced green tea was excellent too. I'd like to try the fries next time-thick cut and looked tasty. Small menu-about 5 burgers. It's a nondescript building, you can  pass by it easily. It's plain on the outside for sure. If I didn't know about their food, I would never think about going there. Valet in their parking lot.

If you want to have a burger with a twist, this is the place. I got the Umami burger and and regular cut fries (they are cut huge!). The burger was cooked perfectly and juicy. We also ordered onion rings and thin fries which were ok. The thick cut fries were pretty good because you can actually really taste the potato...usually fries are just salt and bland, but this was different. I would come here again if someone suggested it but not crazy about it. Definitely different...a must try.

I heard mixed reviews about this place but finally decided to give it a try. Arrived here on a Saturday night and saw a lot of people waiting outside and was a little discouraged. It was almost 9pm and the wait for 2 was going to be 20 minutes. We were seated outside by the heater so I was fine with that. The server came over as we were looking over the menu and asked if we were ready to order yet. I was not ready so he took our drink order. When he returned with our beers we were ready to order. I decided on the Port & Stilton Burger (blue cheese, port-carmamlized onions) and a side of Tempura Onion rings. The bf got the Kombu meal#1 which I thought was a great deal for a burger, fries and beer for $15. The burgers took about 15 minutes before they arrived which was fine with me. I enjoyed my beer. I had the Leffe Blonde. Mmm. The burgers, fries and onion rings arrived. I bit into my burger and it was good. The bun was sweet and the meat was salty so it complimented the burger. I switched with the bf with his burger and his was good too. We were both happy with our burgers. The fries were good too, nothing out of the ordinary. I'm not an onion ring person but there onion rings were good.Would I come back for a burger? Yes I would.

Their burger is good and juicy but too small. What makes their burger juicy is that they serve it practically rare.  Side orders are nothing to talk about.  French fries are macdonalds type, no biggie. Their pickles nothing to talk about.  Their salad sucked.   Their garlic aoili sauce was very week.  We had the Umami and Truffle burger were good.   Next day we went to kalbi burger and made our own burger and asked them to make it rare.  It blew the doors off of this place. The vinegar and sea salt fries were to die for at kalbie and their chili cheese fries were killer. Oh another thing, Kalbi burger is organic and Umami burgers were not.   If you are looking for a yuppie burger then this is it, hehehe

I had the turkey burger and it was amazing! We also got the cheesy tater tots and sweet potato fries as apps and they were good as well. The only reason I would take a star or 2 away is the fact that they got our bill wrong (over charged us) and their condiment holders (spoons) are a little weird and difficult to eat out of.  Also, they got another table's check wrong. Maybe it was their system on that particular night but we almost didn't notice the overcharge until last minute.

So, I tried umami burger for the first time this past Thursday, and it was alright, not bad but not great either. When we first went in, we were rudely herded outside and had to wait 20-30 minutes to be seated. The girl that was taking people's names for tables spent most of her time outside chatting up the valet guys and didn't really pay attention to what was going on inside. We finally got a table, and we got the SoCal, Turkey, Umami, and Hatch burgers along with thin fries and onion rings. The burger was alright; I was expecting more flavor, but it was still pretty good. The burger is pretty small, so if you have a big appetite, you'll probably want to go eat something after. They had their own special ketchup and it was really good with their fries. The onion rings were good and first, but they were too oily and left me feeling nauseated. Price wise, it was a little more than we college students would have liked to spend on a burger, but its okay for a once in a while thing.

I came to this place on high recommendations from two different people, that their burgers are simply the best to be found.  Not only was the burger mediocre, but the wait staff was just snooty.  when I asked if they had any pineapple that I might have on the side, to add to my burger, I was met with attitude.  "All of our burgers come ready to eat, we don't do any substitutions or alterations..."  said the waiter.  I just had a craving for something sweet on my burger man!  I replied with "Well, being a paying customer, Id like to have it my way."  and was met with "If you want it your way, you should go to Burger King."  Can you believe that!?  I don't get upset or give bad reviews often, and most likely can always find something good to say about anything, but that was just rude!  I was about to do just as he suggested, and walk out, but was convinced by my friend that came with me to give them a chance.  I was severely disappointed with the burger I got.  It was definitely not ready to eat, or the best burger I have eaten.  I would be happier at burger king, at least there I can have it my way and don't get any attitude from uppity waiters.

Went with co-workers for lunch. Place wasn't crowded so we got seated and ordered right away. Umami burger is excellent. Juicy hamburger with soft toasted buns. The flavor of the meat mixes very well with the tomatoes, mushrooms, grilled onions and toasted cheese. The fries are a complete rip off though. Nothing special about them and tiny portion for $2. Definitely go back for the burgers!

Why do I always get so excited about Umami burger and then feel so disappointed? Last time I tried to order the truffle burger, but they had run out so I ordered the Port and Stilton burger. It was good, but there was something definitely missing and I believe it was the "umami". My friend that was there with me said her burger was missing flavor, too. Today I tried to give the truffle burger a shot. I got it to go plus onion rings and the complimentary aioli sauce. The waiter apologized because they had run out of aioli sauce which was fine, but I had assumed they had included ketchup or something to go with the onion rings. When I got home, I was uber-disappointed. There was no ketchup, nothing, so I had to bust out the cheap ketchup packets I had saved from fast food excursions. These onion rings have an amazing crunchy texture, but they are completely tasteless so you absolutely have to dip them in something. The burger was the real disappointment. It's called a truffle burger so it should taste like truffle right? I didn't detect an ounce of truffle. All I tasted was garlic and tons of mayo. Come on guys, if you're going to name yourselves "Umami" burger (maybe I'm a little biased because I'm Japanese), you should try living up to those standards, otherwise you might as well call yourselves Grease Burger.

Burgers are delicious although a little underwhelming in terms of presentation. The fries leave a lot to be desired. Waste of money. For dessert, I highly recommend the cookies & cream ice-cream sandwich. Very good indeed. The place itself was empty and minimal. Not exactly a spot to hang with friends. And there's no alcohol served at this location. Burgers and beers should always go together.

I'd have to say the burgers were delicious, but the service was beyond horrible.  Servers were not very attentive or intuitive.  Who brings tea w/out a spoon?  Received our burgers 20 mins after ordering.  Did they have to go out & kill the cow?!  Then waited another 15 mins to get the sweet potato fries, which were hot, but didn't taste very fresh.  No apology was given for having to wait so long.  Wanted to eat the burgers w/ the fries & by that time, the burgers were cold.  Will not eat here again.  Maybe do takeout.

totally over rated....the whole " no substitution" policy is rather irritating. i get that the place is trying to be "cool n hip" maybe, but thats not an excuse for giving me attitude when i simply asked if something can be substituted... i, personally will not be back.  There are plenty of delicious places that have less "yup" and much more tasty food.

This place is way overrated....overpriced and just ok.  If you want a good burger then try father's office.  Even In and Out is better than this place.  Service is bad as they are extremely slow(blond server...did not catch her name).  Maybe they have slow service to keep people in the restaurant to show perception that they are always busy.  Save your time and money and go somewhere else.

Sorely disappointed after all the hype about Umami: both service and food. It took them 35 minutes to seat us, a table of four, as we watched 4 to 5 parties get seated before us. As for the burger, it's overrated and overpriced. The buns had a good flavor with a hint of sweetness but the texture was a little stale. As for the rest of the burger, it was a little bland.There was no kick of flavor that set itself apart. I would have to say even In&Out burgers are better than this.

Tasty tasty food. I was a little surprised not to see a gigantic burger on a plate full of fries, but in the end it was all about quality, not quantity. I definitely didn't leave hungry, and every bite was scrumptous. I had the SoCal burger and my boyfriend had the Umami burger. Neither of us stopped to share a bite of our burgers so I have no idea how his tasted, but apparently it was pretty good. The burger itself was well constructed and the flavors really complimented each other. We went with the server's recommendation and ordered the tater tots side. AWESOME! The best way to describe them is that there were chunky mashed potatoes and cheese inside every crispy bite. Prices were on the high side for a burger joint, and the restaurant is a little too cozy for my taste, but overall a great experience. I'll definitely be back.

Me and three of my friends went the other night and we decided to order 4 different burgers and split them 4 ways so we could try each.  Each and every one we tried was a mind blowing taste explosion so much so that after we finished the first round of burgers we ordered all of the rest of the burgers on the menu...and ate them.  Beyond just having great burgers, our server was exceedingly knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful and the service was excellent.  There wasn't a DJ when we went, but you won't need one because when you taste their burgers the sound track from 300 will start playing in your mind.  The owner was there and personally greeted us, I will be returning often as their menu changes every month or so.  You can't go wrong here, great burgers, great service, very reasonable prices, easy going atmosphere, oh yeah, and free parking.

its a cute local joint. parking sucks and theres a bit of a wait depending when you go and since the place is kind of small. We split the umami, pork and lamb burger. I'd have to say the umami was the best tasting one and pork 2nd. But overall i thought it was just okay altho my other friends really liked it. we did get a nice surprise and saw rose mcgowan or someone that looked like her lol

Food was good - we had the triple pork burger, onion rings, eggplant fries, and umami burger. My girlfriend preferred the pork burger to the umami burger. Both were good in my opinion, the pork burger definitely had a stronger, saltier flavor. The umami burger was more subtle but still very savory - you could taste the flavor of the beef. Onion rings and eggplant fries were not bad, went well with the mexican coke we got. The service sucked, though. We were there at 3:00 on saturday afternoon, it's a small place, and there are maybe three tables besides us. Two servers, and one manager/owner looking dude floated about. One server w/ a mohawk took our order. He was very short with us, and had a thing about our menus. My girlfriend asked to keep the menu because we wanted to look at the deserts. He replied that there were no deserts on the menu, to which my girlfriend responded by reading a couple that were listed there. He seemed offended by this. A little later he reappeared at our table, gesturing and clearing his throat - he was eager for the menu that we insisted on keeping to look at. What, were they short or something at 3 in the afternoon with a 75% empty restaurant and us the last people to have walked in? Also they were out of fries (this seems to be a big problem based on other reviews here). I was engrossed in the menu when he mentioned that to my girlfriend, so he snapped at me when I asked a moment later. The other server, who seemed nicer but was still a bit spacy suggested eggplant fries in lieu of the potato ones. Sounds good! But they weren't on the menu and the first server didn't mention them - doubleyou tee eff? Also we asked for some water later and when he brought them to us, he literally SLAMMED them down. Water glasses remained empty throughout the meal, until we were ready for the check. I did enjoy the food though. I am still full from it.

The Umami burger is REALLY good, but according to one of the cooks is  mostly ribmeat (think McRibwich, only better). Service is awful, but it's worth sitting through at least once for the burgers.

Tried 2 different burgers the HATCH and the UNAMI both BAF (Bland As F@C!)  And the sides oh man ... Its more like a SID you gotta pay extra for the ES. You barely get anything. And the MEXICAN COKE...TOTAL RIP OFF! First of all it was gasless and came opened and bottles were brand new. If you order a coke in Mexico pretty sure its gonna be in a used bottle.

I'd just like to start by saying that this whole gourmet burger trend thing is lame.  Lame! Lame!  Lame!  The burger is the food of the people, and the people want the burger cheap and dirty.  That being said, Umami burger is pretty good.  The Pork Burger with all its lovely delicacies is something to be treasured.   On the other hand, Umami Burger, I suppose you think it's cute to serve french fries in increments of four or five, stacked like little Lincoln Log forts, but it's not, those fries are decent enough for me to want at least eight of them.  As for the ketchup situation I don't know wtf you're thinking, this is America, we don't pay for ketchup here and we never will.  You'd better address this issue, because some day after the Umami glitz and glamour buzz fades, you're just going to be "that place" that charges for ketchup that is good, but tastes oddly like bad marinara.  I feel this situation left unchecked has the potential to bring the whole house down.  In regard to service, I heard a lot about long waits and surly help, that was not my experience.  Yes, our waiter was a skinny pant hipster, but he wasn't too over the top with it, he knew the menu well and was fastidious in his service -- that is all that should be required of a waiter (I get the feeling that some of you yelpers want them to come home with you to fly kites and braid each other's hair).  Anyway, Umami, you would have gotten five stars based solely on your beautiful burger taste, but ended up only getting three on account of all your gourmet silliness. I will come back to you next time my pockets are full and I'm in the mood for plebian fare with the hope that you have shaped up.  And, I promise that if you do, I will become your most loyal patron when the others abandon you.

Star: taste: burgers and onion rings and fries, I'm discounting the bad dessert because everything else was good. Star: originality Star: presentation/atmosphere/t-shirt style Star: keeping it simple and doing what you do well Missing Star: Service - we got attitude on the one hand and strangely personal small-talk on the other... Kim was in the mood for a burger and I wanted to try something new.  We met my brother and his girlfriend here  - it's a tiny place on a dark stretch of La Brea - and waited half an hour for a table.  When we saw a table open and thought we should be next by our own estimation I stepped inside to ask.  Tried to catch the eye of someone and the guy behind the counter became very annoyed with me "what's your name?" he said irritably, picking up a pen.  Deliberately cheerful I said "oh it's already down there!" and then he glanced at the open table and said witheringly "I'm SETTING it." The way I used to say to my mother "I'm GETTING up." Mm-Hm.  I've worked in food service, you get irritated by customers, I understand, but you can learn to master the forced smile and only slightly patronizing patient tone of voice and it helps.  A lot.  I was starving and had been waiting outside in the cold, I certainly didn't feel cheerful and I managed to fake it.  And I wasn't the one getting paid. Our server in the signature brown Umami shirt with "forkless" written across the back (because they don't give you a fork!) was much friendlier - perhaps too friendly - he told us details of his personal life and inquired about us, a little odd, really, but clearly he meant it all in a friendly way. The burgers were yummy (even though bloody rare and one of my mushrooms was still cold so clearly didn't get fully reheated from when it was grilled sometime earlier) - clearly high-quality beef and the toppings were imaginative but not too imaginative.  The buns were greasy-soft and delicious.  The fries were really perfectly done - crisp on outside soft inside and just salty enough.  The onion rings were what onion rings should be - put me in mind of really good fried fish and chips - only with onions. Recommend you skip dessert - the weirdly fancy ice cream bars had been in the freezer too long and tasted like freezer burn. I still prefer 8 oz over all (less attitude, more options, friendlier and easier to get seated) - but if you love burgers you should definitely make sure to give this place a try.

I suggest that if you go in a group, order one per person and share so that you can try more than one. The truffle burger is phenom! but a little much to eat a whole one solo. It's always packed so expect a bit of a wait. I'm also a fan of anywhere that you can opt for a "mexican" coke... (aka - the kind that come in the glass bottle still)

I love the Umami burger and will go back for it, though I'll choose my times carefully. I don't think it's worth a long wait. Other than the cheesy tater tots - when they have them - the sides are just okay, and this is from a girl who never met a potato she didn't like. They do seem to run out of things a lot. And sometimes it would be nice to have a beer with the burger, but this location doesn't serve alcohol.

My entire table had the Umami burger, and we tried out the onion rings, thin and thick fries. The fries are oversalted and the thick-cut fries are almost inedible due to their thickness (bland on the inside, super salty on the outside). The onion rings tasted quite good, and the thin fries were much better than the thick (but still way too salty). As for the burgers, they were good but not very tasty. In fact, they almost tasted bland. The burgers were all cooked medium-rare so they were juicy but lacking in any memorable taste sensations. Not even the crispy cheese could add some zing to the blandness of the burger. I'm not quite sure why the fries were so salty and the meat was so bland - they should have salted and peppered their meat just a little bit more. The buns were good. The service was very poor and inexperienced, and we had the bus boy, the host and the waiter haphazardly come by and assist us with our order. It seems to be a hip place with hip people, but the burgers themselves need to be a little less hip and more tasty. Save your money for Bowery burgers, their meat is better and you get the hipness too.

Why do Americans love greasy food?  Because it tastes good.   Well, not necessarily at Umami Burger.  I was not expecting a healthy fare, I was however, expecting to taste my food without gagging from the grease.  I ordered the truffle burger with a side of smushed potatoes.  My son ordered the So. Cal burger with a side of onion rings.  We both ordered it medium rare.  The food arrived pretty quickly and I have to say the staff was very nice and attentive.  I took a bite of my delicious looking burger and nearly gagged from the squirt of liquid grease that went into my mouth.  I had to open my burger and try to soak a lot of the grease with the napkins.  It was dripping and most of it had been soaked already by the delicious brioche bun.  What a shame.  Not much better with the potatoes or onion rings.  I would dare to say the spoon up the grease and lather it onto the food.  Not good people.  Way greasier than your average fast food joint.

Umami lived up to the hype with excellently flavored, incredibly juicy and unique burgers. The price meets the product at this spot, as the burgers are really unbelievable and worth a trip. The first bite of the Umami burger is so good that you force yourself to take small bites so you can savor the flavor. Juice drips from the burgers, and though they are a little greasy, they are excellent from the bun, to the patties, to the accompaniments, especially the wafer. Sides, including the sweet potato fries, are not all spectacular, but the onion rings still meet the high bar set by the burgers. There is a good selection of drinks, including tasty bottled Mexican coke. The menu has desserts, but I did not make it this deep into the meal because I was so in awe of the Umami burger. This location does not sell alcohol, which can be a shock for some, but it has no effect on the burger which is the star of this show. Clearly I loved this place and really would recommend everyone to go here to get one of the better burgers they will ever eat.

Yes, the burgers are awesome but I'm dealing with something that makes the fifth taste leave a BAD taste in my mouth.   I'm a big fan of this place, there's one a few blocks away from me on La Brea and I usually get to go orders to bring home and eat with my wife.  Lately, they've been super busy (good for them) and when I call I never get an answer.  So, I end up walking there to place my order in person and wait.  Not tonight, after I walked there and got my taste buds ready ,  I was told that they are not doing any more take out orders for the night because they were too busy (it was 8:15 pm)  Okay, so...nobody answers the phone for me (this has happened three times now) and when I get there I can't place an order?  WTF?  How about a tweet or an update on your website on whether or not you are going to take to-go orders.  Does that sound a little extreme for you?  If so, answer your damn phone.  This place deserves all the credit and business they are getting because the food is awesome, but please don't lose us loyal customers because you can't keep up with us.  If you're getting too big for your britches, get bigger britches.  It doesn't take much to fix this problem, hire someone to only work the phones, don't just ignore the calls.

I am an Umami Burger lover.  Officially.  We finally tried this L.A. burger powerhouse, after a couple of years of fierce dedication to Father's Office.  While they win out over Father's Office in variety of burgers, Father's office makes up for it for packing tons of taste into their one amazing burger (add in the deliciously extensive beer menu and you have a tie on your hands).  The Umami burger is delicious, but the parmesean can be a bit overpowering at times.  The pastrami burger was also tasty, but a bit awkward since the pastrami topping was not your typical shaved pastrami, but instead a thick chunk of it.  If you, go you MUST get the Truffle burger, though.  Hands down amazing.  I don't know if I can say with good conscious that it beats out Father's Office, but at the very least it is a tie.  The French fries are perfectly crispy, the smushed potatoes are ridiculously filling and delicious, and you absolutely must go for a rootbeer float.  Parking in this area is so easy.  I've heard the other locations are great as well.  But truly, one of our new favorite places in L.A.  Again, remember:  TRUFFLE BURGER AND ROOTBEER FLOATS.  Beyond delicious. We love Umami and you will too!

Burgers are quite good. Liked the sliders and So Cal burger most. Their signature burger had too much going on for me. Not crazy about a big piece of undercooked mushroom on my patty. But the beef was really flavorful. Total comedy of errors during our visit today. We were told they were out of buns, out of fries, no salad. They managed to find most of these things during our lunch. By the way, took about an hour to get our food AT A BURGER JOINT. C'mon people. But our waiter was adorable and earnest. The owner or the guy I think was the owner seemed really put out though and in a foul mood, maybe because they already lost their chef. All this said, I would totally go back were I in the area and wanted some good red meat. Veggies go elsewhere. Oh, and the sweet potato chips. Not good at all. Place is nice looking.

My friend who is a really great cook recommended it after  we all saw Julie& Julia  well. here is my take...overall I loved it...service was sketchy, ran out of plates and glasses (WEIRD) loved onion rings NOT GREASY, liked the french fries but nothing special, Really liked the pearl couscous, variety of sodas, actually did not miss having alcohol Had the manly burger and it was absolutely delicious, portions are on the small side, but face it folks we need to stop  super sizing everything!  I was full and for a change not bursting at the seams.

This place has the worst service ever with the rudest servers! The nerdy skinny white guy with glasses and brown hair would not seat us because our friend was parking his car.  Okay, I understand this if the place is packed and there are other people waiting for tables.  However, it was not.  There were also two other tables of two sitting at a four-top.  When my husband asked the guy why they were allowed to be seated and we weren't, he said, 'It just matters.  That's why.'  What a loser.  I've heard several other similar stories of the same kind of treatment.  Left and went elsewhere where we were treated in a welcoming manner - ya know, the way most restaurants should treat you when you walk in and you're gonna spend money there.  Seriously, it's just a burger.   Get a grip.

Went on a Wednesday night and it was packed. We waited 15 minutes for a table. We ended up sitting at the bar which was pretty cramped but  I wasn't bothered by it because we were just coming for the famed burgers. I ordered the Manly Burger and my date the 3 Pork Burger and I have to say both were the most juicy, succulent burgers we had ever had. My date loved his so much he wanted to order another one. You can pass on the fries but the onion rings are a must. They are almost savory and sweet. None of their special condiments blew my mind but it didn't matter because the burgers were so good. We were only disappointed by the fact we couldn't get a beer with our dinner so next time I think we will belly up at Little Bar across the street and just have the burgers delivered. Overall, you can take or leave the ambience, but the burger is the best in town if not the best I have ever had!

So weak.  Tasteless, raw burger.  All 5 of our burgers were raw.  Not cooked medium rare, full on seared on the outside like seared ahi and raw throughout.  So if you do want to eat there, make sure you at least tell them to cook it to medium.  Otherwise you will get a bitchy waitress to give you attitude when you want it not raw and cooked to medium (like all burgers should be cooked).  Didn't even finish my Umami burger and i was starving.  Fries are weak (both skinny and fat), onion rings are weak, filled with oil (and you only get 5), house made ketchup was like tomato sauce = weak, aoili was also weak.  I think its cool that they make their ketchup etc but I would take heinz any day over their tomato sauce they claim is ketchup.  I have no idea whats up with this place or how it got more than 2 stars.  Sounds really good but doesn't come through.  Classic case of over promise and under deliver.

Yes, it's expensive and not huge portions.  I enjoy the flavor, quality, menu, and service so I don't really care.  I emphatically recommend everything so I'll only mention what didn't kick-ass: A) Desserts...I'm just not feeling anything I've gotten here.  Plain and simple.  B) Cheesy tater tots...they'll often try to sell you on them, they suck don't bother.  Not cheesy, not tatery.  Starchy mounds.  C) Ask for additional umami ketchup, there's never enough supplied.  Other than that, great.

Got to say I love this place. I'm gonna go as far as saying this place may be better than 8 oz burger in Melrose. Love the thin cut fries. Cant get enough of this place.

It was okay, but was disappointed they didn't ask how I would like to have the burger cooked. As it was, it was far to rare for my tastes and the blood just soaked the bun and made the whole thing fall apart as I ate it. I don't think Umami burger is as good as Kokomo's burger, just up the street on Beverly at Martel.

I've heard about this place for a couple of months and have seen it on TV as well.  I'm a huge burger fan so I had to try this place.  A few of my co-works were up for going so we decided to take a long lunch and give this place a try.  We decided to go early at 11am to miss the crowd.  The place is nice for a burger joint and is very trendy as you would expect in the west hollywood area.  We were the first one there and we got served right away.  From that point forward, our experience was not so good. This place has below average customer service at best.   They are not very accomodating when you want something slightly different or ask for certain condiments on the side.  Also when we order a green tea drink and it tasted awful (dont get it), they didn't offer another option other than "do you want water".  If the burger was good, I could deal with poor customer service. I ordered their Umami Burger since that is their signature burger.  They serve it medium rare unless you ask for it differently.  Make sure you let them know because they do not ask you how you want it prepared.  When my burger came out it looked like a slider :-)....well not much larger than the slider.  The bun was soft and a little burnt on the edges.  The burger was displayed nice and it looked pretty good.  Presentation I give it a 8 out of 10.  When I took my first bite the texture was good but the taste was so overwhelming with the various condiments on the burger I couldn't tell that I was eating a burger.  A good burger needs to taste like a burger and have the condiments complement it.  I couldn't tell I was eating beef.  Too much other stuff going on and not enough of the beef taste.  It left me saying "where's the beef" .  By the time you are close to done, the bun is soggy and you are left disappointed.  My co-workers felt exactly the same way.  They did not like it at all.  Taste I give it a 6 out of 10. In summary, I'm not sure what the hype is.  There are many burger joints that I would recommend, (The Counter, Habit, In & Out, Apple Pan, Fathers Office.....).  For 3 people, we spent 54 dollars, 18 dollars each.  That's for 3 burgers ($10 each),  Fries, onion rings (split those) and 3 drinks plus tip.  I recommend going to the Counter and save your change for a nice dessert and coffee. I won't be going back

Umami is great.  Killer burgers in a low-key atmosphere.

spring break. one year later, and I find myself on Umami's doorstep again.  The burger is as good as I remember it and this time, they have a vegetarian option so my dining partner doesn't just have to sit there and watch me inhale my truffle burger.  I'm glad they added regular fries to the menu too but I do wish that they'd give a little more ketchup with the fries.  The pickle platter was slightly different too and offered several different types of vegetables (zucchini ,cucumber, shiitake, carrot).  I think I preferred the old platter which had 5 different takes on the good old cucumber pickle - way more interesting imho.

can't argue that the burgers are good, but the service is AWFUL, staff is rude, especially if you are ordering to go, cashiers treat you poorly when ordering to go.  why build a place so small if you aren't set up to accomodate your customers?

The most repulsive dining experience I can remember... lousy food, absolutely abysmal service (that came with extremely obnoxious attitude).  We came here for lunch at 2:15 on Sunday.  We waited 45 minutes for our food.  People who came in 20 minutes after us had finished eating before we were served.  We ordered a side of the highly touted "homemade" pickles; they never appeared at our table, though they did appear on the bill.  One of our party got a large square piece of plastic in her burger (we imagine this might have come from the slice of cheese).  The onion rings were undercooked, soggy and greasy.  THE HAMBURGERS WERE RAW, AND NAUSEATING.  One of our party is a vegetarian; he ordered the veggie burger, but the restaurant was out of it.  Our same poor vegetarian friend ordered a cup of coffee, and was then told that the restaurant was "out of coffee cups," and was it okay to be served the coffee in a paper cup?  He said okay, and asked for cream.  The restaurant did not have cream - they did bring some milk.  When we inquired about our food, or, once it had arrived, asked for the several items they had neglected to bring, we were told unpleasantly "we'll be with you in a minute." At the end of the meal we asked to speak to the manager about our many disappointments; he came to the table but was surly, unpleasant and unrepentant.  Honestly, he just didn't care.  You could not pay me enough to return to this terrible place.

I have a new opinion on L.A. trends....if everyone raves about it, and it is served on a square plate....run away! We ordered the Manly and Umami burgers and an onion ring. Both were very oily and not from the cheese as the server suggested, rather from the meat and bun. The bun is like a wheat dinner roll with a brush of egg white on the top to give it a hardness only on the surface and a shine. The buns are coated in either butter or lard and then set on the burner to burn the edges. I do this at home as well with butter, but not to this extreme. The bun was soggy from oil both from the patty and the spread on the bun. I had half of each burger mentioned and removed the bun to lower the grease. The onion rings were the same....heavy on the oil. Tons of little bubbles in the breading filled with oil. The breading is very thin, and the onion was barely there. I had a bite. The only thing going for this place is the sweet ketchup.

Ok.... just ate here. First off, I must say THE SERVICE SUCKED! I was disappointed in the soda situation. I usually like Mexican coke but this bottle was half the size a normal bottle and they charge you $3 for it. I would have preferred fountain soda with my meal. The burger as well was very small it could've almost been offered as an appetizer.  I ordered the Umami Burger and my boyfriend ordered the Truffle burger. I must say I didn't enjoy the after taste of each either. Fries were also not good and would have liked some more ketchup instead of being given a tablespoon of it on my plate. Overall food was not good, but the reason I am giving my first yelp review is because of their service. They have these mini tablets which at first I thought was pretty cool we decided to play a game but saw you have to pay to do so, which is pretty ridiculous. There was a popup on the screen that said 1 free game left so we preceded to play a 1 minute game which charged us $3 with out us knowing and when we asked the waitress she said she can't remove the charge and we get 2 free games even though we didn't get any. She did not come back to help us for the next 10 minutes and when she did come back she said she  couldnt do anything to take it off. She came back finally and said she took it off, which confused me because she said there was no way she could. And I should mention, it is only a few dollars but I dont think its right especially when she even said herself we were suppose to get 2 free games and assumed we did. She also took it upon herself to speak loudly to make everyone around our table aware. Anyways, place sucks ass.

After hearing so many good things about this place, I and my DC decided to try this place out.  It was in the middle of the afternoon but surprisingly there were quite a few people in the establishment.  After glancing at the menu, we were disappointed that they no longer serve the scallop burger, which looked good on someone's review.  Instead we just ordered the umami burger (supposedly their signature burger, $9) and eggplant fries($3, something different, I guess).  I was a little hesitant when the waiter did not ask me how I like my burger done, especially for a $9 burger.  After looking around the rather sterile decor, our food is served.  The umami burger is glistening with probably butter, topped with sauteed portabello mushroom, cheese crisp, and roasted tomato slice, sandwiched between brioche-like buns.  The meat is definitely not dry, cooked medium, but I can't really taste much of anything else except for the sweet and sour taste of roasted tomatoes.   Some people compared their burgers to Father's office's, but I think I would rather the extra $3.  The eggplant was a big flop since the sticks of eggplant were covered with what seemed like soggy flour coating, none of the crispy outside and soft center that I was expecting.    Generally not a very satisfying experience with much to be desired.  Perhaps the triple pork burger would be more promising...

I called in an order on my way home 710pm. When I arrived at 725pm to pick it up I was told my order was almost done and that I could pay and wait outside, I paid and then I was told to wait outside and my food would be brought to me. After waiting outside for 20 minutes I went back to the counter to find out my order was ready and it was in fact the to go order I had seen setting on the counter for 15 minutes. So I was a little irritated and I mentioned the situation to the counter attendant who was the same employee who had told me to wait outside 20 minutes earlier. I was hoping for an apology and to give the employees a heads up that there system of pushing to go customers out the door may not be working. Her response was an eye-rolling apology with the excuse of being busy. There were only three to go orders while I was there waiting. SO when I did get home the food was way past cold and unenjoyable. I know take out food is never piping hot but I lived close enough that it served promptly it would have been warm. So to sum this place up--a fast food quality burger served with the attitude and price which makes most Los Angelean's feel like it they've found a gem. Go to fat burger and save $30.... 5/28/2011

We got there right at closing time (10 p.m.), but they were nice enough to take our orders (for take-out only).  I had the port & stilton burger, and my hubby had the classic umami burger -- we both preferred our respective burgers.  I was expecting the stilton to be overpowering, but was pleasantly surprised by how subtly it combined with the port-caramelized onions (yummmm).  I was afraid that the meat would be cooked too much after I realized they hadn't asked how we wanted our meat cooked.  I sighed with relief and joy when I bit into my burger and saw juicy pink/red goodness -- it was cooked to perfection!  Oh, and the bun is like none other -- slightly sweet and a tad denser than the usual buns that are filled with air pockets.  Plus, the bun-to-meat ratio was great.  I think this place now tops my list of favorite Southern California burger joints, even surpassing Father's Office (caveat: fries are better at FO).  Can't wait to come back here...

I live walking distance from this location, and I always see the crowds outside... I couldn't wait to try... my first time we were seated in a small center room that looked very similar to a tiled shower room... 8 of us crammed into this shower facing the wall... we waited almost 20 minutes for this space... the burgers were pretty good, but nothing special... The steak fries were microwaved and extremely hot... the small side of ketchup mixed with some not so great tasting spice ran out half way through my fries and never did get anymore ... had to ask for salt, and after 3 minutes our waiter came back to collect the salt... Not a good experience at all... but 3 months later and seeing every weekend this place packed, I started to doubt myself and went back to give it another chance... Only a 10 minute wait, and I did not want to be seated in the bathroom again... but we were seated in a tight section just to the left as you enter right next to another couple ... My wife had the view looking out and I got to look at her with a view of a wall... again the burger was good, but not great, skinny fries were better, Ketchup still tasted like crap and was only given a spoon full , no salt or condiments on the table... I understand the whole shi shi concept here, but $29 for two burgers and fries, no drinks ... You can do much better in Los Angeles...

Went to Umami Burger last night. Their website and Yelp's page for this restaurant both say it closes at 10pm. We arrived at 8:45pm. We didn't even get inside. The valet attendant of all people told us that the restaurant is not serving people anymore because the restaurant was full. I told him i didn't mind waiting and he said that was what he was told to tell any more customers, Now, i can understand if the place took reservations (which would then be funny in itself for a burger joint) and was full, but its a burger restaurant! Typically restaurants seat until closing time or close to it, but I've never heard of restaurants gauge  how many more burgers they need to cook in order to close at a certain time. I hope this is not a new trend. So based on my imagination, the burger sucked and the service was terrible. Get there 4 hours before closing time so you pad yourself in case you need to wait or get locked out. Sorry, during these times, customer service is golden. I won't be going back.

This is a good burger if you were just walking down La Brea and stumbled into this place. Is it worth all the hype? In my opinion, no. The first major let down is there is no alcohol served at this establishment. A good burger needs a good beer. Period! To completely size up the burger , the bread was good, the meat was good. Although, with much surprise they did not ask how we would like it cooked. The rest of the burger was a little dull, no kick, leaving me to believe that "Umami" in this case, does not stand on it's own.  But to be fair, it's not bad. What was a complete disgrace to the burger culture were the fries and the pathetic excuse for ketchup. We took one bite and did not return except for curiosities sake.    WTF did they do to the potato? It's been triple dipped in tempura and re fried to the point that any trace of potato is GONE! Give it a try for something different, but don't expect the best burger in town.

why why why are your buns so small? ok, I get it, more meat not more bread....but it NEEDS more of that delicate, soft, melt in your mouth bun for that PERFECT bite. it just begs for more bun. other than that, incredible, and beats out Father's Office... I THINK.

Went and tried Umami Burger on Friday. Ate half an unami burger, half a manly burger (shared so I could taste both) and fries. The manly burger was way too salty, the umami burger had this weird taste from the mushrooms, the fries were ok (but small portion). I don't see why this place is getting such good reviews. It's not all that great. McDonalds has better burgers and anyone can make these burgers at home. The portions are super small (I'm 150 lbs, 5'9" and not a monster eater but even I was still hungry). They make you valet for $2.50 (if you want to drive around forever there is street parking, but you pretty much have to valet). My dinner was $40 for two burgers, one fries, two sodas (no refills), tip and parking. I say if you want to spend that much on a burger place go to The Counter (way better for quality and portions) or Fathers Office. Maybe you can just go to McDs or Dennys. It's the same thing. No wonder the couple next to me was complaining about their food and service. They probably felt the same way that I did. I will never go back and will tell my friends not go waste their time or money there.
