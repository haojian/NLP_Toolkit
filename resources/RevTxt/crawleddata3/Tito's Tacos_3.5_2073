A coworker brought me the shredded beef tacos. I must say, this is SOOOOOO delicious. Shredded beef (and they're not skimpy on that either!) with shredded iceberg lettuce all enveloped by a crunch taco shell. What more could you ask for? Besides for another one. The tomato salsa is good too, it reminds me of Clamato, but fresher.

It is Like My three star rating states; "A-OK" line was long but it moved along quickly. Parking sucks. I had it once before when I first moved to the L.A area but forgot about that time,  (that's how ordinary tasting it was.. it wasn't a moment to remember) I decided to try it a second time since My cousin posted a photo on her FB and It looked incredibly Delicious! I live a mere 35 mins away but with L.A there comes traffic, there was traffic everywhere, IT DELAYED my arrival time by another 35 minutes!! so it took an hour and 20 minutes for us to get here.. I spent about $25 on 9 tacos, medium guac' sauce-NO Drinks included. We drove to McD' down the street and bought a couple $1 dolla' sodas and dined in.. LOL ghetto, but you gotta do what's convenient! Overall the Tacos were Meh' alright.. the salsa tasted too much like tomato's, needed more of a kick, at least make it a bit spicy. the guacamole sauce tasted bland, but together with the SALSA it tasted much BETTER! the tacos had a good crunch to it, and I like how soft the shredded beef was.. good amount of cheese! let's just say I would never drive another hour+ for these again...

Tito's is good. I personally stick to the tacos though and avoid the burritos and everything else. The line is crazy but it's warranted unlike other places in LA :::cough cough PINKS cough cough::: Cash only. But there's an ATM right next to the joint.

I really don't understand the fuss over Tito's.  The price is about what you'd expect and both times I've been here, the chile relleno and enchilada were flavorless and kind of tasted like cafeteria food.  It's okay for a quick bite on the outside tables in the summer but this place gets freezing cold inside in the winter.

Another example of an overrated spot getting big time lines out the door. The business this spot brings in at peak times is legit. Problem is food is not just a business, food has to stand on it's own. The Mexican food doesn't stand on it's own here and to be honest I can find better spots in Connecticut or Turkmenistan. The gringo inspired crunchy tacos are bland and the Masa on the tamale is dense for me. There are so many better Mexican restaurants in the area that deserve bigger lines and more buzz. The type of eater that rates this 4 stars+ is out to lunch and likely to be the same eater that looks at Apple bees as a choice dining spot on a Friday night. If Tito's wasn't packed to the gills and did not have the buzz around it that it does I wouldn't be so harsh on it. A saving grace is their Red Salsa. What it lacks in spice it makes up for in freshness for sure.

Some people glorify this place, and I think that is wrong. The food is decent, but its more of a spot people go to because its "a spot people go to."   Don't go here for fine dining.  In fact, if you're reading yelp looking for somewhere hip and tasty, this probably isn't gonna be your spot.  You'll have a better experience if you just wait until a local invites you along to come here for lunch.

This place is always packed and there's always no parking. The food is awesome and fairly priced. The trick is the salsa and guacamole. I get the tacos with cheese, chile con carne and rice. The salsa and guacamole is the trick for me. I put it on everything.  Hands down a good spot. These aren't street tacos but shredded beef tacos which is OK for me that's what makes this place Titos. I wonder why they haven't opened up another location. Hollywood or West L.A. even downtown.

I can't believe I've never reviewed Titos.  Not that they need more raving fans.  It's in the same category as Phillipe's and Stan's one of those places you are proud to have in Los Angeles.  Keep it simple and order the tacos, with cheese and be sure to get plenty of salsa as well (I often add a small salsa to my order even though a small is included with the order).

UM, YUM! This place always has an insanely long wait but it's worth it. I wouldn't say it's the BEST taco I've ever had but it's right up there. The hard shell is deep fried so it's hot and crunchy. The pics are spot on - they use a LOT of cheese :-) I recommend getting some beans to dip your chips in. The salsa is not too spicey and super fresh. Parking sucks but you can also try the street if the lot's full.

I get it Tito's Tacos, you're a landmark, a staple in the Los Angeles food scene. I went on a random stop on the way to the airport. There was a massive line at 3 PM. This place is cash only, so make sure you don't have to use their very expensive atm. They bring the food up quick, but it just tasted like some tacos. I mean they were good, but were they wait for 40 minutes good? I still like King Taco a little better.

All these years, Titos... I am growing older but you are the same vibrant bloom...  you are a magical creation, please don't change, please outlive me!!! Long after waving the LA area goodbye as home, I cannot stay away from Titos for long.  Titos has caused trips to LA.  Titos has taken me out of my way.  And it's always worth it.   I guess this is a YMMV place.  Some people want modern fusions and the more exotic central and south american takes on la cocina.  I must have a lot of peasant karma in me, because the essential nature of Titos is IT.  The meat and sauce - that hint of cloves that took me 30+ years to figure out - is singular and intoxicating.  Blended with the sinful frijoles refritos and a basic cheddary indulgnence, wrapped in a perfectly textured, steamy, chewy tortilla, the Titos burrito is something manifested from Heaven to the mortal world, just to prove that Heaven does indeed exist. The shredded beef tacos are so simple, and so delicious.  The chips are real, hot, fresh.  Their salsa is a bit watery, but somehow, strangely, it is the perfect complement to the main fare.   Don't let me forget the entertainment value... we always meet friendly people at the communal tables outside... and enjoy the perennial flock of 'taco birds' all around. Writing this has got me thinking of reasons to go through the west LA in the near future...  Titos! Yo te amo!  Ole!

Tito's Tacos has always been really popular with western LA folks and I grew up eating it after school, more out of habit and tradition than of the deliciousness of the food. With that said, their tacos are just okay. Crispy taco shell, salty meat that doesn't look fresh, lettuce and about an extra 50 cents a taco for cheese. It's good cheddar cheese that they give you PLENTY of, enough for two tacos. What really gets me though is the salsa. Their salsa is spicy and good. Though it's really just tomatoes and some chili, they make it well and it definitely kicks up the tacos a notch. Their chips are also pretty good and freshly made. They're really generous with the extra chips and salsa they give you for no charge. I usually ask for extra salsa since it's free. They also sometimes give you this green jalapeno salsa that adds a good spice. Ask for it! Lines are pretty long but go by fairly quickly. Cash only, pay after you get your food. ATM available for a $2.50 charge. Parking in the small lot or street. It's worth a try and a good comfort food when the craving kicks or when needed.

I reeeeeally don't get the hype of this place. The tacos are large and yes it's bulging with ground beef, but shouldn't it be at that price? Hard shelled tacos are alright, but seems to be lacking soul. Okay so I admit I am partial to soft tacos, but I do enjoy the crunch of the hard shell once in a while. But I can't understand why there are lines out the door for these tacos and 65 cents extra for cheese!? The best tacos I've had were out of a truck and one fifth the price. Maybe it's the Westside and rent is more expensive, or that they can feel they can charge that because of lack of competition in the area? :( I do like how they include salsa and chips with your order, free fillers yay. Too bad they tasted so bland, the chips needed more salt and the salsa was just ground up tomato, there was zero spice. It like they made the tacos as bland as possible for the Gringo palate, a stereotype in there inability to handle spice. x_X The rice I ordered was on the hard side, like it needed to be cooked with more water or was left out too long. Spanish rice should be fluffy, but there was some more interesting flavor going on there and was quite edible mixed in with the side order of chill that I got. I know all the die hard fans will cry in outrage when they see this two-star review, but I simply have to stick to my taste buds, "Meh, I have experienced better". Even Del Taco has Del Scorcho, Tito I'm not impressed...

This place's reputation is the definition of drinking the kool-aid. Sure the tacos aren't as bad as the one star I'm giving the restaurant, but they are completely generic. You line up for forty minutes like you're getting on the Indiana Jones ride at Disneyland for a completely average taco you could get at several different places in a mile radius. I guess it's worth going so you can say you've been there, but not worth a return.

How does a taco shack not have any horchata or hibiscus water? Tthat made my lunch even more sad. I wish I had gone to a taco truck instead. Summary: I feel like this place serves a taco bell taco but more evolved like they use better LOOKING ingredients. Its supposedly a LA classic, so I had to atleast try so that YOU DONT HAVE TO because yah, I could get a better meal from a dirty hotdog cart. Cash Only Food: Taco with cheese or with out cheese. Its hard shelled, maybe freshly grated cheese, processed meat, and ice berg lettuce. Beans: tasty, but nothing special. Salsa: watery, probably from a can. PICANTE?? Service: Grumpy. Just grumpy.

I can't stop singing that dang jingle, "I love Tito's Tacos" but never had one until today. It was not as busy as usual, according to other patrons. So, I decided to wait in line and get these famous Tacos. YUCK!. There food is whack. There was not anything special about Tito's Tacos. The salsa looks like pink puke. The tacos are not freshly cooked. Menu is not consistent  (ie: beef burrito had beans inside). The food is below average. The only thing better than a Tito's Taco, is NO TITOS TACOS.

The first time I ever came here, I arrived at around 10:30pm and his place was totally packed.  Which, of course, is a good sign. So I decided on the Tito's Taco with Cheese, which is very popular here.  When my order arrived, I took my first bite and CRUNCH~! The taco were crunchy...I mean, very crunchy...maybe a little too crunchy.  It had a slightly thicker and harder than usual taco shell. The taco shell and the nachos were made of exactly the same thing. In fact, it would be accurate to say that the nachos were basically smaller pieces of the taco shell.  They used shredded beef on the taco the meat quality was decent.  And the taco was totally loaded with cheese, which I liked.  I thought it was a decent taco, but nothing special.  But as my friend noted, "you get a pretty good value for what you pay for", and that, I agree with...for $2.35, I ain't complaining.

Been a fan of Tito's since I was a kid! Dont let the long line intimidate you! People either love or hate this place! My house alone is divided on it! I love it!!!! First, this isn't mexican food! The tacos are greasy, fried, and have cheddar cheese! I once heard a rumor the meat was mixed with mayo (and I hate mayo)!! But you could tell me it's mixed with spit and I would still love these tacos!! Greasy yummy goodness. I'm not a fan of the other stuff but i heard its good from other Tito lovers!  My bf gets a burrito to take to work. Give it a try if you like crunchy tacos and judge for yourself! Free chips an salsa with every order! Ask for the chopped jalapeños! Oh and eat there if possible! Won't taste the same if you get it to go! Good luck with parking! Cash only!!

I am not sure what all of the fuss is about, clearly you love it or hate it. I love because it is NOT like the 10 billion other "authentic" taco joints or stands that are on nearly every corner. If you want a unique experience,  I could do without  the crappy parking lot and somewhat long lines, then Tito's is for you. The salsa is fresh and refreshing  and goes well with the hard shell and once again unique shredded beef, it's almost minced, along with the freshly grated cheese and iceberg lettuce. Count me as a bandwagonner on the plus side. For those who don't get it, not to worry Tito's...... your long line of devoted fans says all you need to know about those who do enjoy your decidedly non authentic and delicious tacos.

Ive been here 3 (three) times This place is an awesome glimpse into what Americanized-Mexican food is. A time capsule of the poor taste that accompanied what "Mexican Food" was all about 35-40 years ago. When you ask your friends of Mexican Heritage where the good Mexican restaurants are, and you get "well nowhere really, except home". Places like Tito's tacos are the reason for that response. Now, as for a place that sells "Gringo Tacos". This place doesn't cut it, There's is a truck called "Gringos Tacos" that makes a pretty nice "Gringo Taco".  Shucks, I'm going all out here but I can get a pretty darn tasty "Gringo Taco" at Del Taco (Macho Taco). I do appreciate how long Tito's Tacos has been around, considering that its very difficult for any small restaurant to stay in business longer than 5 years. I respect that Tito's Tacos has a well earned cult-like following. There will always be armies of people who discover Tito's Tacos for the first time. When I want tacos, I'll keep doing want I've always done and go elsewhere.

I live right down the street and I do like the food here, but maaaan I can't get over how bad the service is! First of all, I had no idea how the lines work when I went in there the first time and when I tried to ask the cashier she straight up disrespectfully ignored me, clearly offended by my apparent lack of taco queue knowledge. That's cool, maybe she's having a bad day. I washed the bad taste out of my mouth with a diet beverage and some greasy tacos. The next time I go I forgot cash since this place is cash only. I go to the ATM after I order and come back to pay, and nooobody will take my money. My neglected tacos cooling on the counter. Had I turned invisible? Did I have spinach in my teeth? I don't know. I finally try to physically wave down one of the ladies and she gives me a death glare reserved for the man that strangled and ate her favorite puppy and walks away. It was harsh. I had to cry myself to sleep that night. To make matters worse, my already prepared food was sitting on the counter for what seemed like days, but there was no way I was dropping my cash and skipping change after that kind of service. I get that you have to deal with drunk idiots every night of the week, but don't take it out on me or my innocent tacos. I can't remember many times where I feel like I've been disrespected while ordering tacos, but this place makes it a habit for me. Aaaanyway. Pretty good tacos, kick-in-the-balls service. Depends how bad you want those tacos I guess.

LA born & raised, love Mexican food, have been eating since I was a little kid both here and in Mexico, live for tacos, there are some amazing places in town for tacos and this place certainly isn't one of them. You come here for one of two reasons: 1) You're a tourist 2) You like pretty bad tacos The tacos are bland, the lines are tragic, the taste of lettuce permeates the flavor of whatever meat/oily greasy shell is around it, just bad tacos.

TITO'S TACOS RATED Yup, you see that above?  That's Tito's Tacos "over" Rated. I think it's a bit overrated as a taco stand. The food is good, but does not live up to the pageantry and hype. I don't not like it, but for me, it's not a place if I move out away from LA that I'd have that nostalgic, "I gotta go visit" places, and during the routine of normal living, I never crave it.  However, in the same breath, of others wanted to go eat here, I'd never balk nor complain about it (unless it's raining or there's a line). The hard shell tacos are no better than the "2 for $0.99" at Jack  in the Box, and for the price, I think you get a more quality one at Chipotle.  I'm not a huge fan of fast food taco's either.  I would venture to take a chance on any local small Mexican restaurant and predict a better taco than at Tito's. They must be great marketers, and that commercial with that catchy jingle must be working since the lines are always long and people seem to like it. Without the hype, and if everyone wasn't raving about it, I'd say it's a good decent taco spot.  Nothing outstanding about it 'tho. I don't not like this nor do I not recommend Tito's, but if you put all of the factors together of the price, the traffic, the long lines, the parking, the lack of seating, and location, if it's not convenient for you I'd say it's not worth a special journey nor a long wait for.

Taco's are crunchy and cheesy - very yummy! I didn't care too much for the tamales and the burrito was just ok. Love their salsa and guacamole sauce. It does throw you off a little that they aren't very specific with labeling their "meat", but I guess that is part of their authenticity. Anyway, would have the tacos again!

Didnt know whether to give Titos 5 stars or 1 star???   I keep going back because the tacos & salsa is like crack....gotta take care of my fix for titos tacos.   Pricing is ok Family of 5 @ Titos is $35-40.   Long lines are no big deal as they move quick. Remember which gal took your order cause she'll come looking for you when its ready.   Have manners...after you place the order... get out of the way until its ready. Everytime I go to Titos, I swear I'm never going back... but I do.   Apparently, the red salsa contains vinegar & make you go to the toilet.

Growing up in WLA, Tito's has been an institution for me.  I remembered being wow'ed after my first visit there with my parents.  Tacos were simple and damn cheap.  As with everything else prices have gone up but the tacos still remain unchanged.  With each order you get some freshly fried tortilla chips along with some of their fresh salsa.  The salsa could use a little kick but damn is it fresh.  Don't let the long lines dissuade you as they move along quickly.

I don't understand the hype. Overly long lines for dull and boring tacos that are mostly filled with lettuce. There's absolutely nothing special about these tacos. The shells taste like store bought shells, and the beef is dry and bland. I had to pour salsa on top in order for the tacos to have flavor. The bean and meat burrito was a little bit better but was still plain and unsavory. The salsa was good, I just wish it was spicy. The guacamole was too watery and didn't taste as fresh as the salsa. The lines here are also confusing. Between people standing around waiting for their food, and the long rows of people waiting to order their food it's hard to figure out where the line begins. Once you figure out where to stand be prepared to stand their for awhile because the lines move really slowly. Granted once you actually order, the food comes out pretty fast. Service here is also not that great. It's very evident that the workers don't care and don't want to be there. Oh well, at least I can now say I gave it a shot. But next time I'll save my money and just scope out a taco truck to get some real tacos.

Where does the hype train end for Tito's? Didn't anyone tell Tito he can't make tacos for shit? Talk about a terrible taco. What you get is some flavorless shredded beef, lettuce and shredded cheddar cheese in a crispy taco shell. Let's break this down since the the restaurant is called Tito's Tacos, after all. The beef is surprisingly bland. What's it lacking to be exact? Salt, spice, and savory flavor, you know, that characteristic that is naturally occurring in pretty much all meat. What the fuck is Tito doing with this meat? He's apparently doing nothing besides boiling some meat and hosing any residual beef flavor off with a pressure washer. What's on the rest of the taco? Iceberg lettuce and shredded cheese. That's it. I'm not even talking about green-ish colored iceberg lettuce, this is white and extra watery. But I've solved the mystery: Tito's may be saving money by stealing the toppings from the Sizzler salad bar. And the cheese? Well, I like cheese as much as anyone else but it's not even melted. Even nuking this thing in the microwave was too much to ask. At $1.75 a taco you'd think they could at least put it near any heat source for a few seconds.   All of these fine ingredients are piled into a shell that is so crispy it's probably been used to shank someone in the exhausting line that's always outside of Tito's. Why is there a line? Are those commercials really selling anyone on this abysmal taco? For future reference you are better off assuming anyone in line is a.) drunk; b.) high or c.) a tourist. Anyone from LA raving about Tito's shouldn't be trusted. A taco from Jack in the Box has more flavor and character in every deep fried, melty, seasoned bite. Someone get Tito out of the fucking kitchen.

What an amazing hidden gem!  And this coming from someone who is usually not a fan of Mexican food!  I split an order of guac, salsa and chips, a bean and cheese burrito and cup of chile.  Everything was very good, but the guac, which was smooth and creamy, not chunky was my favorite.  Will definitely be back to wait in endless lines and fight for table-space if/when I'm back in the area! Very fast service (heard it was faster if you tip) and really good, quality food!  So good, in fact, good luck finding a table inside or parking nearby!  Oh, and its cash only.

This place is one of kind. I marvel at their unwillingness to embrace basic Fordian assembly line efficiency: the person who takes your order also makes your food, gets your drinks, and takes your money when the food is ready. CASH ONLY and apparently 50 cent pieces are still in circulation, because you'll sometimes get them as change here. The guac is not great (kinda watery), the salsa is super fresh (kinda watery!) and I always get a cheese enchilada because YOLO. What happened to the Pac-man machine?!!??! Stay gold Tito.

One if this places that you should eat at once to day you've done it. A west LA tradition, there's always a line outside but IMHO good Mexican in LA can be found in places with a shorter line and better parking. Tito's is just average IMHO, slightly Americanized. It's worth going, just for the LA taco experience that everyone talks about, but I wouldn't call it great Mexican food.

This place does absolutely fantastic business with almost ZERO advertising.  I think I may have only seen 1 or 2 commercials, so it is all word of mouth. Anyway, I don't go out of my way for a Tito's Taco, but if I'm in the area and am not short on time.  Tito's is it.  They are fast, considering the gobs of people waiting in line.  The taco's are deep fried, which is probably why they are so good.  Anyway, they do not skimp on the meat and overload with veggies.  Actually it's a deep fried (chicken, beef, or pork) taco then some lettuce, cheese and tomato on top.  And their salsa.  I don't know.  I think they take some fresh tomatoes, throw them in a blender with some jalapeno's and cilantro. I can't duplicate it, but I get extra salsa so my taco is swimming in them. So if you're in the area, hungry, and have time to spare, this is your spot.  Parking is a premium here so patience will be your friend.

I was pretty disappointed by the lack of the taco sauce; just made everything taste bland... but the salsa they give is good, but it's just not the same. I may come back, but next time, I'll be sure to bring my own hot sauce. :) Oh, and parking is SUCH a pain since it's always so crowded!

Alright, alright. I had Tito's tacos the other day for lunch and I am now upgrading those bad-boy tacos to a whopping 3 stars! My first experience at Tito's wasn't that great for numerous reasons. However, getting free tacos and having them brought to you changes my perspective a little. The tacos were a little bit, just a little bit, better than I remembered and I think that is because it came with different salsas and guacamole this time! Their guacamole isn't anything special . . . its on the watery side, but it does give the dry meat something else. I still wouldn't recommend this place because there are so many inconveniences that come with eating here. However, I will now say that ". . .yeah, sure I'll have a Tito's Taco" if someone goes out on a food run.

See the long lines? That doesn't necessarily indicate quality, or a good deal. See Cinco de Mayo right next door? They probably have no line, or a very short one, and the food is better and cheaper. Tito's is somehow still coasting on a rep it got YEARS ago, when there was little or no competition.

I've been coming to Tito's tacos since I was a little girl, and I love it. Their tacos and burritos is what me and my family always get and they're delicious. Never really gotten any thing else! Yes, the lines can get pretty long, but they go by pretty quick. I also recommend getting someone in your party to find seating while you're ordering because it can get pretty crowded at times. Also make sure to bring a jacket just in case you have to sit outside because it can get pretty chilly.

I hit this place up after a bike ride down venice beach.  Never been to it, but a friend recommended it, as we pulled up parking was hard to come by on a weekend, it had a pretty big line in front of the spot.  Bring cash, its a cash only place.  And it only has one type of meat, another reason why the line moves fairly quickly.  On to the food, really unsure as to why this place is so popular, the tacos are nothing to write home about, its a decent greasy meat taco, cheddar cheese grated on top.  $1.80 a piece so cheap enough as well.  would I come back, highly unlikely.

So someone once said, "I've been a customer for 20 years, what does that tell you?"  That tells me you have god awful taste in tacos.  These are cheap quality taco bell type tacos.  Actually taco bell's are better, and so are jack in the box's, and those are some bad tacos. Not authentic at all, which is not a problem, I couldn't care less if they actually tasted decent.  They don't. Fake shells and fake meat. There are about half a dozen places nearby with great mexican food.  Tito's is a load of hype.

THE PROs: For the price, I think that the food is better than A-OK. In fact its its even closer to as good as it gets. Everything tastes fresh and its always made the second you put your order down. The long lines move fast so don't be fooled by them when you see them. Long lines are sure sign that Titos is doing something right. I loaded up with 6 Tacos and 2 bean cheese burritos and had leftovers for the next day. THE CONs: Its cash only. Not so much a CON but rather an inconvenience. However if you do forget your cash there is an ATM machine by the order window (if your willing to pay the hefty ATM fee). This last CON Ive been mulling over. 1st of all,  I dont think Yelp is a place for anyone to get on their political or social soapbox. But since this is my review Ill just go for it. WTF is up with the painting of the "Sleeping Mexican" at the side of the building!? I find it offensive and in poor taste. Hell Taco Bell got rid of theirs (sleeping Mexican), Sambo's whent down the toilet with their African American character back in the 80's.  Com'on Titos. Its 2012 lets get over these shitty stereotypes. I know...its America...its his business yaddi yadda yadda.  Good job on the tacos though.

"Meh" pretty much sums it up. The tacos are pretty much glorified versions of Taco Bell's.  Straight-from-the-package shells filled with dry beef, shitty iceberg lettuce and flavorless cheese. Today, after seeing them listed on a "Top 10 Bean and Cheese Burritos in LA" blog post, I decided to give them another shot. The burrito was OK, and that's about all I can say for it. It wasn't awful, but it was far from great. Like their tacos, it was pretty bland I guess. I'm not sure who paid for that listing, but it wasn't even in the top 10 burritos I've had on the West Side.

I've been going here for over 20 years, so what does that tell you?  I grew up in the Culver City area and if you never heard of this place, you just don't know what you're missing.  I've known people to drive from Woodland Hills, Buena Park, etc. just for a Tito's fix! So, let me talk about the food.  The tacos as so yummy, crispy, and meaty.  It tastes good with their salsa and if you want to get fancy, guacamole.  Remember, you can't just have one.  The next best thing, if you are a meat eater, is the beef or meat burritos...add some cheese and bam! It's comfort wrapped in a tortilla. The chips that comes with your meals are a must.

Some people drive from 20 miles for the tacos. It's barely worth my 2 mile drive. It's kind of a Mexican place for people who have never had really good Mexican food. Salsas and guacamole is super runny, food is kind of bland, and lines are long. Try a mom and pop taco stand instead.

Tito's Tacos, Disappointment Not Expected A young man's taste of Displeasure By Kyle Diamsay Wednesday, December 5, 2012 I somewhat despise Tito's Tacos. Melissa Wilson's Great Grandfather had a great idea to pursue in a family business, but was it a delicious decision? Mexican food has to be one of the top addicting, delightful chow out there, and most abundant. For some reason a place in Culver City, California by a busy freeway upset the well being of my stomach, Tito's Tacos. As I approach the business I see a range of people from teens to senior citizens crowding to get in the doorway I first think, "This seems to do very well by the looks of the lines." The place itself seems welcoming. The decor is very simple, nice tables and decent chairs, nothing more. By the looks of the place it is as if the customers don't care of the looks they care of the food, well that is what they came for. The menu that I could barely get a glimpse at was very plain. The only thing that popped about it was the bright yellow color of the board. The prices ranged from as low as $2 for a taco to $6 for a burrito. Well, $6 for a burrito is explainable for the size and the ingredients, but the catch is they ONLY ACCEPT CASH. When you hear the name Tito's Tacos you would think the specialty and what they would be known for would be tacos, what is have heard from customers is that the burritos are the way to go. With the advice of a loyal customer of the business I purchase a burrito, the $6 All Beef Burrito w/ Rice and Cheese Burrito. As I lift the box to find this humungous burrito I feel the warmth hit me on this cold night. I bite into the burrito hoping to find what all the other customers are raging about, but instead the beef hits me with this strong taste that I cannot stand! This burrito has been the least favorite of all the burritos I have had. The taste of the beef did not feel right. It was as if it came out of a can. I could not stand it any longer. Tito's Tacos also has tacos and Tamales on their yellow board of cuisine. i taste the Chicken tamale not going near the beef  tamale because I had a feeling the beef in the burritos were the same in the tamales. Tamales are a scrumptious delicacy I look forward to when eating Mexican cuisine. Their chicken tamale was not the best but it stopped me from thinking of the beef. Now to the taco praying it is better than the burrito, and it was. The freshly cooked corn taco shell had the signature crunch of the taco and the flavor was not all that bad. The cheese and iceberg lettuce equalized the taste of the same beef put in the burritos. I expected a great success of the taste but got a slap in the face. Looking at the line growing every minute did not make me feel the place was a failure but just another taco place, nothing more. If you went out to get a bite, maybe, just maybe you should go here if u didn't mind the cash only, then how about it. Personally I would not, I would just go to my friends house for a better meal.  Tito's Tacos may not be a gourmet taco stand, but it is not a complete failure by the looks of all the customers it has been receiving.

I don't get it. I just don't get it. I give Tito's 3 stars because I love crunchy tacos, but they only really deserve 1 or 2. The food is mediocre at best. The meat in the tacos is shredded, and doesn't taste very good. Both the salsa and guacamole taste as if they might once have been made fresh, but then were both watered down to make their product last longer and to get as money as they could from it. And yet there is almost always a line down the street for this place. Is this a landmark taco stand? Is there something I'm missing? Crunchy, bland tacos and everybody loves them. Maybe I do too, because I have a feeling I'll go back just to get a cheap crunchy taco.

Tito's Tacos is an SoCal institution. I am a third generation customer, and I have been eating their food since before I could say the word taco. My father grew up eating there, and my grandfather ate there as well.   Is it Mexican food? Not at all. Hardshell tacos and burritos are American inventions not Mexican ones. If you want Mexican food, go to King Taco or Gallo Giro. If you want delicious non-Mexican food, go to Tito's. I typically order two tacos with cheese and a bean and cheese burrito. It is a lot of food, but I love it. Their tacos are pretty simple, filled with shredded beef, cheddar, and lettuce. While the tacos at Taco Bell and Jack-In-The-Box may have more flavor, unlike the other two, you can actually tell what kind of meat is inside of a Tito's taco.  Their chile colorado, which is cubes of beef slow cooked in a red chile sauce, has a really nice flavor and the meat is very tender.  While the meat is good, their refried beans are better, which is why I opt for the bean and cheese burrito.   In sum, if you can get past Tito's not serving food that in anyway resembles food you would find in Mexico, Tito's will serve you up a meal with just the right balance of meaty, crispy, and greasy.  Perhaps, it is because of my sentimental attachment to Tito's, but Tito's Tacos is true LA comfort food.

A friend took me here because I absolutely had to have a Tito's taco. She was absolutely right. I did have to have a Tito's taco. Since the menu isn't huge it shouldn't take long to order. AKA, you shouldn't have to stand behind someone going , "uhhhhh let me get uhhhhh". I had 2 Tito's tacos with cheese and they came with a heaping amount of fresh tortilla chips and salsa. I wish the salsa was a little more hot, but I'm sure they have hot salsa but the novice in me didn't ask for it. My friend ordered the enchilada and it was tasty looking. I snuck a bite when she went to the bathroom (don't worry, I covered up my bite with cheese and sauce) and it was delicious. The prices are reasonable, but please know they are a cash only establishment. I only knock 1 star off because I couldn't get a chicken taco, but they have chicken tamales. I didn't understand that. It left me wondering if the tamales were outsourced. Park wherever you can, even if it means you have hightail it across the street.

The even distribution of  ratings just about sums it up, and I'm smack in the middle - 3 stars.  This is a de facto institution in Culver City, the West Side of LA, and maybe even the Southland. The lines are long.  The place isn't that great.  The food is decent and the traditional hard shell taco with a lot of cheese is their best item, and also looks like their most popular.  Again, it's good, but not great.  It is certainly better than Taco Bell, but that's not saying much. How people just HAVE to go to Tito's Taco's is beyond me!  I could go twice a year, and be fine with that.  I consider a trip to Bob's Big Boy more important than a trip to Tito's Taco's when I'm back in SoCal.

People seem to LOVE this place based on the lines. It's just tacos and there's nothing special about it. Not sure what all the fuss is about. The lines move pretty slowly and it's cash only. Service is none existent unless you're a regular and they recognize you. The tacos are stuffed with dried out beef, lettuce and cheese if you want it. They don't skimp on the cheese, but it's just too much. 2 tacos will pretty much stuff the average person. Every order comes with chips and salsa.

What a disappointment.... I've driven by Tito's for the last 3 years and was always amazed at the line of people at almost any hour. So yesterday when we drove by there was a very short line and we decided to stop in. There's about 10 items on the menu - tacos, burritos, tamales, typical Mexican fare. Even with the short line it still took about 15 minutes just to order. Their system kinda sucks.... We went for a few tacos and chips, and ate inside. Kind old and crappy, but not too dirty. Well, the tacos were pretty awful... Flavorless shredded beef, lettuce and cheese. Wasted calories, wasted time, and wasted money.....

I don't know if this place is going down hill or if my taste buds just aren't what they used to be. I grew up just a couple blocks away from this place and when I was in HS, Tito's was the spot. Now, a few years later after I've moved away and come back, the food just doesn't taste like I remember. The salsa is bland (ok, blander than I remember),  the chips aren't as salty...the tacos...I don't know it just seems like something is off.

I had heard of this place, but was scared off by some of the reviews for a while. But after three or four local people recommended going here, we tried it out. It was a good experience after all. Not gourmet, not nouveau (in fact quite passe, continuing with French), not authentic, but tasty. I liked the crunchy tacos and the large cup of their mellow, but flavorful salsa that they serve with it. I dipped the whole taco into the cup and it was perfect. I like that they give your order to you in a cardboard box filled with chips. We will come back. Oh, and on the line, it really does move fast.

Guacamole- its like a green soupy oatmeal like stuff, I wouldn't say guacamole. Salsa- it's like someone put a whole tomato, and nothing else in a blender as was like "yes, this is salsa!!!" Chips- they look like something that came out if a bag from smart & final and they quick fried them. They also over charged us, they do the math by hand, no cash register (easier to "claim" on taxes) - do the math yourself before you pay. Don't believe the hype.

I used to love these tacos, and the salsa! BUT the last time I went either the oil used was too old or something didn't go right. I might stop by again another time but not very much motivated to do so. :\ I didn't feel like it was worth my money at all. They spend A LOT on advertising. Maybe they should spend a little more money making the food taste better... One last note, be careful. Even back over ten years ago the area was sketchy. It still is now, if you're not used to it just make sure you lock your purse and any visible valuables in your trunk. Make sure you know where your wallet/phone/etc is at all times.

Get in line, put in your order, and then GET THE F OUT OF THE WAY The reason that the lines in front of this place look so deceptively long is because YOUR ass is blocking the people behind you.  Once you've placed your order, move aside so the next person can go up to the front.  You come back and pay when the lady has your food ready.  I don't even live in LA, and yet I figured out how this terribly complicated system works.  Maybe they should put a sign up The tacos are OK

This place is completely overrated. Maybe it's because I didn't get the cheese in my taco and burrito, but cheese isn't a standard topping, so I felt it should be able to stand alone. The chips/tacos I felt were too overcooked and had a weird after taste. The shredded beef in my taco was dry. The beef in my burrito was good, but it was so messy! Aside from all that, this place is just a zoo with all the people in line and the parking situation (if you try and park in the lot). For tacos, there are much better options around town with King Taco or just a taco truck.

What the shizz... I'm no expert on tacos, but I think I can spot bad food. I was not expecting this sort of food from a taco shop or any shop for that matter. It's not cheap nor is it good. It was rather... disgusting... I ordered two items and a drink off their menu. But man... even the drink tasted funny. 1. Titos taco with cheese: WTH, my taco looked like a Chi,Chi,Chi,Chia pet gone bad. It apparently was starving because it was so thin wrinkled and it  also had mutant orange cheese with discolored green lettuce. Clearly, this poor thing has seen better days. A Very disappointing presentation if I have to use my Chi, Chi, Chi, Chia analogy. The meat complemented the disaster of the taco's appearance with it's own flaws. It was burnt to a complete CRISP on the outside. It was hard and dry on the outside... kinda like dried out driftwood. In fact, the outside was so tough that I could have probably used the tip to keep my chair at home level. I knew it wasn't suppose to be that burnt because once I broke the taco into two and the inside looked totally different from the outside. On the outside it was adobe clay brown and the inside was car grey... Frankly, I think my tacos at home turn out better. And well... let's just say it looked better than it tasted it. 2. Meat burrito: I like how it says meat burrito. I didn't bother to ask what was in it, but as I took a bite then another one, the taste in my mouth began to transform. It was totally weird and gross. Let me also mention that it was pooled in some sort of sauce, but I assure you, it was not pleasant and mostly salty. Will not EVER order this again until I ask what them what the animal of the day is at the restaurant. I hope to never have this experience again..... This could just be an off-day, so maybe I'll come back in a few weeks, as I'm always driving through the area, and give them another try. One positive note: their service was very helpful and considerate. I hate to leave such a nasty review, but I will note that if this restaurants were graded on friendliness their rating would probably not have suffered as much.

Been eating here since the mid-70's.  Nothing much has changed and that is fine by me.  Tacos, burritos, beans, etc.  All are great, but some reviewers decry the lack of authenticity.  Well, there are about 2 million taquerias in the LA/OC region that cook a more "real" Mexican meal.  Back to Tito's - You either get it or you don't.  If you do, then you know that mild red salsa works magic on those simple deep fried tacos with their shredded beef.  Pony up and get cheese on the tacos.  The burritos usually come out so hot, that you should consider wearing asbestos gloves while eating them for fear that some of the sauce might trickle onto your hand, leaving you with a Tito tattoo.  I'm hungry, let's get a taco.

Let me preface this review with the fact that yes, I eat spam, corned beef (from a can), hot dogs, vienne sausages (uncooked from the can, that's right). I eat all these things because...well they were foods I grew up with. I can understand the concept of liking food for nostalgia. I will never understand this for Tito's Tacos. Perhaps it's because I was never brought here as a child. But I have to say one thing. Give an average person a spam musubi and the reaction is "that's pretty good." I'm convinced that with Tito's taco the reaction will probably be more like, "wtf is this?" Overall Tito's tastes...terrible. The tacos are fried and yet STILL DRY! How is this possible?! The lettuce they put into it is minimal; if I didn't see it I wouldn't have even known it was there. The cheese, maybe, is the best part but only because of my associated love of cheese, not because the cheese was actually good. Savvy? Overall final verdict. Dry and tasteless (really I can't describe how it tastes just the texture of the foods). The salsa, if you can call it that, was clearly whirled up in a blender. The frothiness hadn't even left the tomatoes. It was also bland, but it did taste of tomatoes (at least something tastes like it looks like) and grass. Maybe the salsa verde is passable but at this point who cares the rest is uneatable (no that's not a miss spell, it is something one doesn't want to eat not something one cannot eat.) Despite the long lines in front, I question the palates of those who find Tito's tacos enjoyable much less delicious, keep in mind this is from a person who eats spam....regularly.

The BEST ALL MEAT w Cheese OR MEAT BEAN AND CHEESE Burrito's on the west side. Great because it doesn't need all the filler lettuce and rice many places include and the tase is fantastic. Tacos and tostadas are really good too but I go for the burrito's. They are not that big but just right, do not need to overeat!

This place confirms my belief that even though something is popular, it does not mean it's good! I just moved into the area about 4 months ago and always see a line out of this place. People keep mentioning it when I tell them where I live: Oh, by Tito's! Well, don't come here if you're looking for Mexican food. They have a basic menu, almost like In-n-Out. We ordered tacos and enchiladas. I was appalled that they didn't even have horcata! The tacos were decent-sized and had ample meat and lettuce and cheese, which I paid an extra 50 cents for. They only have one salsa and no hot sauce so there is only one way to eat it. The enchilada was even worse. The damn thing tasted liked Chef Boyardee and the filling was indiscernible. The place is packed and dumpy with the cleanliness of a public bathroom; we sat outside just so we didn't have to stare at the depressing interior and the line of people who were about to embark on the same mistake we had just made (or even worse, were doing so knowingly!) Suffice it to say, I left very disappointed and still wanting authentic Mexican food. Sorry Tito's, you may be a historical fixture, but your food is crap.

For my family, Tito's Tacos will always be associated with LAX.  It is always the first thing that comes to mind when we know we have to go to the airport to either pick up or drop someone off.  "Oh, gotta drop off auntie at LAX ... YEAH, and let's get Tito's Tacos afterwards." So I only order two things at Tito's Tacos.  Beef burrito and beef taco.  Both delicious in their own right.  The burrito isn't dry.  It doesn't come with too many fillings like rice or beans.  It's BEEF with sauce.  And a delicious sauce too.  If you're not careful, it might just spill all over you.  This is a sit down and eat burrito.  I usually order mine with cheese, which ups the deliciousness factor up a couple notches.  By the way, if you can't finish the whole thing, it's ok to save it.  It's actually still delicious the next day as well. The taco.  Full of meet, full of veggies, PLUS shredded cheese.  The hard shell doesn't get soggy.  Yeah, let me repeat that.  The shell does not get soggy.  It's a hard shell for a hard taco.  Definitely can withstand a car ride home ... but who wants to do that?  Everyone knows food is best freshly cooked.  Eat it there and enjoy the deliciousness that is Tito's Tacos. They also give you salsa and chips.  The salsa is a bit watery, not spicy, but it's part of the experience anyways.  Slather it on top of your tacos, take a big dip with the complementary chips.  It's SALSA. Word of Warning: Parking sucks,  but it seems that at the best places, that is usually the case. Can't wait until I have to go to the airport again.  Just means another stop at Tito's Tacos!

3:45pm on a Saturday and the line is almost out the door? You would think after seeing how many people are there and the popularity of the place the food would be amazing. Think not. Once I stepped inside and saw two lines, it looked very unorganized. Either people were waiting for food or waiting to order. I had to ask two people if they were waiting to order. Finally when I ordered my food for me, my girlfriend and friend I was not given a receipt or number. How am I supposed to know if my food is ready if they do not bring it out to your table or call your number? Oh that's right, I have to wait with the confusing crowd. After about 10 minutes I made eye contact with the order taker and paid for my food. We ordered 3 tito's tacos with cheese, two beef and bean burrito with cheese and a large drink. I think this was all under 20 bucks if memory serves correct. Once we opened our food, I was a tad disappointed. It looked unappealing. I then took a bite of my burrito which was decent but the damn thing fell apart and had to eat the rest of my meal with a fork. I was not impressed. My girlfriend had the tacos and they were plain and boring. This place may have passed its prime years ago but if you want to get your "Tito's Taco's fix" by all means give it a shot. I'll pass next time. P.S. No Horchata yet you sell MILK??? Seriously?

Atrocious! I give it the award for worst mexican food. they use the lowest quality ingredients. it's that type of beef that is quasi-rotting, so to cover up that fact they dump sugar in it. the cheese is fake-orange, plastic-y. the salsa was the only thing that didn't gag. it was bland- just tomato and onion. bad, but next to the other stuff, i was grateful. Do NOT go here! The people that like it, like it for one reason: nostalgia. "... oh, i remember when my grandma took me here when i was six..."  Get over it!

Every person that gave this a review of 2 or greater needs to have their tongue pulled out for lack of understanding of what good food is.  I went in having very very .... very low expectations and it still couldn't meet those expectations.  People say "oh its fast food but better than taco bell" .. NO!.  I'd much rather eat the crap that comes out of taco bell.   First this is the most unorganized place.. most places would have the sense to adopt a line style type of service, but this place the person that takes your order goes backs and makes it meaning... its complete chaos.  Second, to add the cheapest most terrible quality cheese to anything they charge so much.  If you're going to charge that much for cheese at least increase the quality from taco bell.  Third there is no redeeming quality to any of the meat products.. all terrible.  The salsa and guacamole are terrible.  Save the money go to ralphs and buy your own. The only one good thing is the nachos and shells to the tacos, but I'd eat just about anything deep fried.

Whoever Tito is, he's a marketing genius. Because if you see this taco stand at any time of the day, it's packed. So you assume, it's because they have phenomenal food. I hate to break it to you, but the Mexican food here is just ok. Do I ever crave it? Nope. Would I make a special trip over here to brave the lines? Nope. Will I come here if it's convenient because my friends live nearby and I don't want to pay a visit empty-handed? Why, sure. So, why the long lines? (This is where you'll see the genius) It's because Tito has about 9 or so people inside the shack who each take your order and fulfill your order in one fell swoop. In other words, this place doesn't do the factory line takeout you're used to at any other fast food joint. One person will take down your order and proceed to fill your order until you pay out. Then they go onto the next customer. Thus, you can imagine why there are lines outside because filling an order, especially one that I make because I'll order the whole damn menu, takes forever. This type of service creates a bit of delay and makes it seem like there a hordes waiting for this food; Pink's does this brilliantly as well. Once you actually get a Titos Taco, it doesn't bowl you over. It does satisfy your craving for something crunchy and salty but really, that's about it. The salsa here is watery and barely tomato-y and their poor excuse for guacamole? Well, my chef friend thinks they put in fillers like sour cream or mayonnaise; doesn't matter, it's still watery. The chips are good and solid though. Overall, just MEH. If you happen to be around the neighborhood and want to eat tacos like you first tasted them when you were a kid, then this is for you. As for me, I think I'll choose a taco truck or Tacos Por Favor in Santa Monica over this over-hyped place. But you have to hand it to the business acumen of the owner and that catchy commercial they have on TV. That alone is worth one star.

They have a good and pleasant service which you would not expect from a place with long lines.  Such a huge difference from the next-door Cinco de Mayo!  Cinco de Mayo is usually desolate and yet their service gives you the impression that you are bothering them.  But with Tito's Tacos, they are always full and busy but they have time to have a pleasant demeanor.   What I always order here is a bean-and-cheese-and rice burrito.   It is not on the menu.  My burrito is not fantastic and I bet the rest of their items are also the same--not fantastic.  So I can't explain the long lines.  But I like my burrito a lot.  (BTW their beans are re-fried so that's the only thing that's keeping me from coming here every night.) Back to their menu, their prices are pretty cheap (e.g., my burrito is only about $4.50).  Also every order comes with chips and their signature tasty salsa.

Alright so I've heard of this place before but I hadn't had an occasion to try it. The meat was cooked amazingly and was super tender and very flavorful. I am not necessarily a big fan of hard-shellt tacos, which is what they serve there but it was a very nice meal. The salsa was good, very fresh, mild but tasty. I ate a lot of salsa that day. Its a sidewalk kinda place with some indoor seating and some outdoor seating. We were outside and had a very nice meal. I will go back and try some other things on the menu. Their meat burrito souned interesting. That will be up next.

People seem to LOVE this place based on the lines. It's just tacos and there's nothing special about it. Not sure what all the fuss is about. The lines move pretty slowly and it's cash only. Service is none existent unless you're a regular and they recognize you. The tacos are stuffed with dried out beef, lettuce and cheese if you want it. They don't skimp on the cheese, but it's just too much. 2 tacos will pretty much stuff the average person. Every order comes with chips and salsa.

Can't really compare this to authentic Mexican food because that's simply not what it is.  So I won't do them the injustice. The food is not so bad that I couldn't finish the taco and burrito.  I did finish my food.   It is however, also not good enough for me to have cravings and want it again. I hope whoever came up with that jingle of theirs is making some royalties because he/she deserves it.  I found myself singing the jingle as I was eating.  Makes you less pissed off when you're barely enjoying your food that you just waited 45 minutes for. First and probably my last y'all.

This one of those places living on reputation alone. Yeah, its a great deal for all the food they give you, but I'd rather just go to In N Out at the same price level. The tacos are deep fried, but for some reason aren't as good as Jack n the Box deep fried tacos. They give you a huge amount of chips and salsa. The salsa was probably the only saving grace here. It tasted fresh and had a good healthy vibe to it. The guacamole however was pure shit - definitely store bought and nasty as hell. Everything else on the menu had the same formula - lots of beans and meat smothered in loads of cheese. Their super burrito is ALL MEAT.. no veggies, sour cream, or anything else. Pretty much a long trip to the toilet the day after.

Fine. I'll admit that I was totally wrong about this place. I hate being wrong. Since I live about 5 minutes away from this place, I've always been curious about eating here. After 2 years of living 5 minutes away, and always judging pictures on yelp of the oddly taco-bell looking tacos with horrible looking salsa but hearing rave reviews from friends and other yelpers, my husband and I finally took a shot and gave them a visit. So very wrong. The tacos, although looking very lame and nothing special, are amazingly flavored, not too greasy (this IS mexican food after all), and crispy not stale. The salsa, although also appearing nothing special, is fresh tasting and pairs extremely well with the taco. The beef burrito is a bit much, although with good flavor and tender beef, is very heavy (would definitely recommend sharing). Their chips are a welcome side. This is no traditional mexican food, and of course there are way better joints out east. But for West LA, and for a fast food joint, this place is definitely worth returning to! Minus half a star though for the long long long long long lines. But I understand the lines now at least lol.

I just don't get it! I wouldn't call it Mexican food any more than I would call Taco Bell Mexican food. It sort of looks like it but it must be its own food group. The tacos are bland and seriously avoid the tacos at least the burritos are slightly better. I guess the good thing is that you can eat this stuff if you have a sensitive stomach because there isn't any flavor at all to upset your stomach. I'm guessing that there is a line for this place because there isn't any real Mexican food around only Tito's ultra Americanized wanna be poor excuse for Mexican food. I'm giving it 2 stars because you can fall a little lower AKA the Taco Bells of the world.

So many of my friends, coworkers and acquaintances have recommended Tito's Tacos to me. And so I finally caved in one Friday night. Perhaps that was my mistake... To start off, they do have a parking lot on the corner of Sepulveda and Washington, but it quickly fills up and you'll be looking for street parking soon enough. The line Wow, it took forever just to be able to get to the front of the line to order. It's not true fast food, so they do make your food at the time of your order, which means you'll have to wait behind people making large orders. They do NOT accept credit, so bring cash. And good luck finding a table inside if you plan to eat in. You gotta scout out and grab one asap. The food We had the all-meat burrito, one taco, and a chicken tamale. Nothing stood out. Everything was all just ok. You do have to pay extra to get cheese on anything. While the prices aren't exactly steep, it does make things like tacos seem a little more expensive. And besides, who orders tacos w/o cheese?! Conclusion I say pass. It's not worth the hassle. I rather go to Rubio's honestly Yeah, i said it!

Tito's is one of those places in LA that you just have to try. It's a place where the locals go for lunch. It's a classic. It may not be the best taco in town, it also may not be the most authentic, however if you're down for some greasy street food you'll love it! If you're looking for an authentic, gourmet experience you'll be very disappointed.

Hello Tito :) It was my first time here. Boy was it crowded! Service was quick. I to-go ordered a Tito's Taco with Cheese ($2.35). Within 5 minutes, bam. I got my order in a paper box. The kind that people used to put nice clothes in and give to me for Christmas. Needless to say I was excited. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… The taco came with non-spicy salsa and chips. Verdict? Very crunchy and dry. The tacos tasted pretty healthy. Which was kinda nice actually. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… If you don't like tacos, then at least enjoy their memory game on their website: http://www.titostacos.co…

A nice crowd lined up for lunch... even thought I just ate Ramen I just had to check out Tito's.  A very mixed crowd of mexican, asian and white folks all lined up to order... a good sign that everyone really likes this place.  The counter lady helped me with my order (suggested the taco and very good burrito), made my order and collected my money... from start to finish everyone gets their own waitress :) But honestly the line fooled me... the taco was a bit hard and lacked any kind of flavor... the burrito felt like I was eating into a big fat worm with lots of mush beans inside and a few chunks of beef.  As I sit here I have only eaten half the taco and half the burrito... I'll wait til i'm starving later in the night before finishing off the boring hat is Tito.

With the exception of the Mexican employees scrambling around in the back making your tacos, everything else here screams "GRINGO!"   But I don't care.  One bite of Tito's bean and meat burrito had me throwing everything I learned about real Mexican food from my years in SD out the window. Unseasoned shredded beef? Cheddar cheese? Watered down guac? Tomato puree "salsa"? Put all that in a Tito's taco shell, then deep fry it and I will gladly say "yes peaz!!" Light on the wallet, tantalizing to the taste buds and welcomed by your fat cells - Tito's serves up the best unauthentic Mexican food EVER! ---- Must Have Item: Meat and bean burrito w/ cheese.  It may look small, but boy does it stick to your ribs.

I first was introduced to Tito's tacos back in 2006 by a co-worker. At the time I was working in Redondo Beach and my co-worker would drive from their to Culver City to get the tacos. I thought to myself they must be damn good if she's willing to drive that far on her lunch hour for some tacos. Well, since then I've been a fan of their tacos. They are not the traditional tacos that you would get off a taco truck. They use a hard shell with shredded beef, lettuce and cheese (will cost you extra). The taco's are a pretty good size for what they charge. They also toss in free chips and salsa. Probably more than you'll ever eat, but they come in handy as a midnight snack. One thing to note this place is ALWAYS packed. The only time I didn't see a line is when I showed up 15 minutes before they opened. Parking is always a challenge. I try to steer clear of their parking lot because that's just a cluster f**k waiting to happen. I equate their parking to trying to find parking at a college at 9am on a Monday. Pretty much impossible in that small parking lot. Also I've seen a lot of fender benders happen there because people don't understand the concept of checking their blind spot, but only use their mirrors (do they not teach this in drivers ed anymore?) I usually park nearby on Washington Place and walk over. The lines can also be pretty intimidating, but don't fret. There is a system to the madness. Always pick the line with multiple people taking orders. They move a lot faster than the ones with just one person. Most people go to the lines outside, but I find that going inside can also be a faster method to getting your food as well. I do recommend bring more than one person with you just in case you need to As much as I love Tito's tacos, the parking and line situation can be a deterrent for me going there a lot of the time. I really have to be in the mood to wait in line for their tacos and sometimes my laziness gets the better of me. If you've never been I do recommend going to experience the goodness that is Tito's. I like the tacos, but they could use some advice from the good folks at Disneyland on how to better manage their lines. One last thing to note, this place is Cash only. They do have an ATM stationed outside, but why pay that craptastic fee?

I blame all Non-Latinos in Los Angeles for this one.  Why?  Remember when people used to call them "Roach" coaches, now because of you all...They are now called "Gourmet Trucks".  You MFer's owe me $20 plus gas. Our order: Hard Shell Tacos with Shredded Beef and cheese, Two drinks, and a Bean and Cheese Burrito. Our Story One of my wife's coworker has been raving about Tito's forever.  This and that..Best Tacos...blah blah blah.  I know this guy loves chi chi's because he always at my wife's cubicle asking  "How u been to Tito's yet".  I know guys and guys love boobs. Today, we happen to be in the area.  Small parking but found a spot.  Being the first time, I asked for pollo and al pastor.  Sorry!  only shredded beef.  Mmmm...ok.  Got our food and a table and got started.  Before I go on, let me say, it was like being near a Krispy Kreme donut shop.  People walking around with brown boxes...lots of them! Beef flavor  and the size was good.  Price as good, but the taco itself was kinda plain.  The cheese and lettuce was nothing spectacular.  No sour cream, tomato, or delicious salsa.  The tomatillo or tomato sauce was blended tomatoes.  No salt or chilli added.  Bland overall.  The taco shells were okay, may have been homemade.  Same for the tortilla chips.  On to the burrito...How can u Fup a bean and cheese burrito?  Bland beans and the cheese wasnt salty enough to compensate.  Tortilla looked homemade but good looking Greekican can tell u that they are too thin and have little salt. All of these years, I have been sitting on a gold mine!  I could dig up my Grandmother and Mother (they are both heathy and alive but for the sake of this review, they are unavailable) to help me take over the Hard Shell Taco Business in Los Angeles.   Congratulations to Tito's tacos for hoodwinking Los Angeles into thinking this LA's Best Hard Shell Taco.  Great marketing campaign!  Dont call me a Hater, call me a Congratulator!   And to my wifey's coworker, next time quit BS and just stare at my wife chest from your cubicle.  I am sure she likes the attention, but at $4.75 a gallon I dont like driving from the Eastside to have Mex Food.  Talk about taking Sand to the Fn Beach! Keep on Yelping

Oddly addictive.   When I had my first bite, I wondered what the hype was all about.  This was like a an upgraded  version of Jack in the Box tacos...but that's debatable because I love Jack in the Box tacos.   Then a weird thing happened, I wanted to go back the next day.  I'm not sure what they put in the tacos, but its working. Tito's tacos is the Napolean Dynamite of food.  I remember when I first watched that movie, I was weirded out that they'd make a movie like that.  But then I kept on watching it.... over and over again. That being said, Tito's sounds great right about now.

Pros: The tacos are outstanding, but make sure to get them with cheese (it's crucial).  The bean, meat, and cheese burritos are also very good.  Their salsa is great, and their guacamole is terrific. Cons: Their ordering system is poor and takes way too long.  And although they're worth it, the tacos are pricey.

This place definitely seems like a staple in the area. The line of people waiting definitely tells you that you're in the right place. I am a vegetarian/chicken eater, so I was unable to try the shredded beef that everyone raves about. The friends I was with truly enjoyed the shredded beef tacos and burritos though. I really liked my yummy bean and cheese burrito. It comes with chips and a small thing of salsa. The salsa is not spicy at all but is still very delicious. I am not sure if you can ask for a bigger thing of salsa but I definitely needed more! The prices are decent, the service is hard to judge as you really just order, pick up your food and then sit down but they all seemed very nice. It seems like most people tip the people you order from, and they seem to be expecting it! I think overall the atmosphere and food make it worth the wait in line. Oh yeah, CASH only!

NOT WORTH IT. LIMITED MENU, MEAN EMPLOYEES, TERRIBLE FOOD. I also agree that just because something is popular does not make it good! Kind of like how the Jersey Shore is popular, yet it's a terrible show. The tacos were OK at best. Little flavoring, not much on them, didn't really wow me. The burritos were the worst. No consistency at all! Good luck trying to pick it up and eat it with your hands. It'll without a doubt fall apart by the time you take one bite. Also, re-fried beans? Zero flavor whatsoever. Lastly, the service was terrible. Lines everywhere, the counter women are all rude and there's little to no organization with the lines nor the way food comes out. People just crowd the windows as if it were a soup kitchen, which it might as well be...

Titos....where to start came here on a sunday afternoon and was soooo hungry that looking at the long lines were very discouraging. Pros: tacos are good, not great, but good, a step higher than taco bell. the meat is shredded pork, very tender and also crunchy because it is i think it was fried! otherwise, it was tasty COns: for the quality it is kinda too pricey, 1.85 for tacos but an extra dollar for cheese, Titos Please! i can jus buy a bag of shredded cheese from the store and sprinkle it on top. LONG LINES! i mean i was hoping that waiting 20minutes would deliver GREAT food, not! parking was horrible, but luckily street parking on sunday is free! CASH ONLY Yea the food was alright, nothing life changing, or something to remember. this place is next to tommy's pastrami which is four stars on yelp! i wana try that!

Tito's Taco  REALLY??? I 1st experienced this place with my sister.  She would not stop talking about Tito this & Tito that.  I Reallyyyyyyy wanted to like this place! esp since she is a FAN.  I tried it on several different occasions & the taste was similar to a taco from my childhood.   I later found out that was a GOVERNMENT CHEESE TACO I had in Elementary School.  This is what that Taco reminds me of. I do not like this Taco Period! Pros: Cheap Cute, Catchy Song LA landmark - I suppose Cons: Stale Shell long line ( for this? ) taste like government cheese Sorry Tito - No picture for you.

Oddly enough the tacos were only OK. The are pretty filling, but it is the all-meat burrito and tamale that are the best. I dropped it down from a 4 star because the service is awkward. People seem kind of lost inside. Mostly because no one tells you when you are going to pay or what they are doing.

So one of my good friends had been raving about this place and how flippin good it is so i  decided to join him and see what the fuzz was all about. We were lucky to arrive at a time when it wasnt all that packed (apparenty the line goes outside the door). I ordered a tito tacos and a burrito with meat. I should have known better cuz goddamn was the burrito big and it was made with birria which is a very filling meat. I got to half of my burrito and i was full. Completely satisfied with the deliciousness i had no choice but to suck it up (like the trooper that i am) and eat my taco. I was not let down! both choices were the bees knees! I loved their chips and salsa too. I'm totally coming back for round 2. yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayy!

I'm unimpressed. Many people flock to this place and it's often rated as one of the best taco places in the area. But, it's never really tasted all that great to me. I think the tortilla is too thick, guac isn't always the best, and sometimes the jalapenos dont look fresh either. lines can be crazy, the seating is limited as well. So, I rarely come here anymore. much better tacos in the echo park area.

I stumbled upon this place after visiting Venice Beach just to get a late meal. Seeing as how reviewers of this place have mixed feelings about this place, I guess I can say I agree with some that the taco's that they're known for are only mediocre. Each taco was $1.75 which is slightly over priced for what you get. The shell was nice and crunchy with freshly sliced lettuce but all in all, it was bland mainly because of the meat. However, this place does earn some points with me for their meat and bean burrito with cheese which had quite a bit more flavor than the tacos. Tortilla chips and salsa, both complimentary to the meal, were decent as well. The chips tasted like generic ones and the salsa was just the blended tomatoes type of salsa. Service was prompt; you can watch the whole crew hustling and bustling from the counter right after you place an order. Cleanliness of the seating area wasn't too great but was expected from a sit and go restaurant. Nonetheless, this place gets crowded so apparently some people do enjoy this place. Despite my negative review of Tito's Taco's you might as well take a chance and try this joint for yourself. Cash only! But they provide an ATM at the corner of their building.

There is something about these tacos that for some reason make one want to come back to them!  They are nothing more than a hard shell tortilla, stuffed with shredded beef, and cheese and I think lettuce and other ingredients; typical Mexican taco.  But they taste rather unique and tasty!  Makes you want to have another, and another, and another...LOL. It's always packed so DO NOT GO HUNGRY and go at least an hour before because sometimes the lines are so long that they are easily 10 to 30 people deep in multiple windows. The parking is also way to small for the amount of visitiors they get, but there is nothing that they can do about this because of how it sits and its location.

Everybody loves Tito's Tacos.. I've heard people rave about Tito's for a very long time... So finally I skipped eating at one of my favorite pastrami places next door and decided to give it a try... Holy Disappointment Batman! Being that it was my first time the wife and I like to order a little bit of everything to really get a feel for a place... We ordered: Tacos Meat and bean burrito Beef Enchilada Chicken Tamale Guacamole Today's Secret Word is "Bland" Tacos- hard shell which I prefer, plenty of cheese on top but really bland (Ahhhh!!!) filling... Meat and bean burrito- looks like slop.. again very bland (Ahhh!!!!) Beef Enchilada- the tastiest part of the meal, covered with melted cheese and lots of red sauce... Chicken Tamale- nothing exciting here.. Guacamole- guacamole sauce really... Avocado's all over the world are crying that they are even associated w/ this stuff... watery, bland (ahhhhh!!) and boring... Highlights of the meal were the service which is awesome ... line to the street and they still are very fast to take your order and make your food. And the fact they have Strawberry soda.. Private lot, but still hard to find parking... Cash only, ATM located outside ..

I love Tito's Tacos, granted I have heartburn afterward. But there is something sublime about it all. The Tacos: Get it with cheese, and lots of the salsa on the side. The Salsa: OMG it is so good, it tastes almost organic from the Farmer's market. It's not. But at least I can feel like I'm eating something healthy when I eat it. They also have a green salsa if you need something hotter. The Meat and Bean Burrito: I still have no idea how they stuff it all in that tortilla without it exploding everywhere. Yet, It holds. This is gooey deliciousness. Get it with extra cheese. Again, pour the salsa directly into it. I really love this food, but since joining Weight Watcher's I have to limit myself to special occasions. Be prepared to stand in line.

I just don't get the hype.  My friends have been raving about Tito's since high school.  Heck, i'm pretty sure we came here after my senior prom for some late night mexican.  But I went back a couple months ago to get the famed tacos, and they were just not tasty.   Waiting in line for ages, wrangling to get a seat, and paying next to nothing are all fun if the payoff is worth it.  But it's a mediocre taco.  Sorry.  I'd rather pay 99 cents for a jack in the box taco, and those things are vile.  I will eat my fair share of cheap, nasty food, but these tacos were just too bland and dry.   But you won't listen to me.  If you know/love tito's, you always will.  If you've never heard of tito's and you're wary, you won't get the hype either so you should just go somewhere else.

GREAT FAST FOOD TACO!  Cheap!   This is so LA, and yet, a religious experience for others!  For about a $2.25 a taco, the shells are oversized and the meat (ground beef) is awesome!  Salsa - amazing and fresh.  Chips - great!   [http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Most people order 4 or 6 tacos (and I won't name any names or point any fingers).  Due to the price point, it's hard not to stuff one more down than you normally would.   They have a small menu of other items: enchiladas, burritos, chili...but the name tell's it all, it's really about the tacos.  With nearly 6 windows to order from, there is nearly always a line of 10 people deep...but it moves fairly quick. Ample seating inside, and a little loud...but it's hard to beat this place for TACO's!!

I have been a fan of Tito's Tacos since I was in my mama's womb, honest! My mom said I was the only baby that she could eat Tito's with while preggers and not regret it shortly after. Their salsa and shredded beef tacos are the staples that keep me coming back for more time and again. The simplicity and freshness of the salsa has me drinking it straight form the container like a pig in a trough. They are NOT shy when it comes to drenching their tamales and enchiladas with cheesy sauce goodness. Now that I am older and have a more refined palate, I realize that their ingredients may not be of the highest quality or taste, but they do what they do best- cheap comfort food. I gave Tito's Tacos 4 stars for nostalgia factor and their great salsa and tacos.

These are the best tacos on earth, hands down.  You need to ask for cheese on top.  I always order double cheese.  Their beef and cheese burritos are the best, also.  I order a half dozen and take them home and we eat them over a few days.  I drive all the way from Thousand Oaks to eat here.  We have friends who drive from Santa Barbara and San Diego to eat at Titos. NOTE:  of course you have to wait in line - the lines are sure indicators of how incredibly popular Titos is! PS - This is a taco stand with indoor and outdoor seating - not a restaurant.

Some places live up to the hype. Others do not. When I dine at said establishments, I try really hard to keep an open mind (and stomach!). Unfortunately, Tito's is a pass... Now I'm not a food snob by any means and I definitely wasn't expecting authentic tacos, but everything was quite average or just a notch below it. The salsa had the odd consistency of a puree with air bubbles in it. The beef was better than I expected, but nothing to rave about, and it was more crunchy shell than filling in each bite. Bottom line: greasy, fast food tacos that could use another shake or two of spices! If a friend reeeally wanted to grab a bite here, I would comply but I probably won't ever return on my own. Cash only. $1.75/taco. Cheese is extra. There's always a line, but I like that you have the option to order from the outside counter or eat inside. Park under the 405 tunnel, but don't get hit by oncoming cars as you run across the street against traffic!

Now I can say that my co-workers are just as whacked as Tito's.  I should have just walked out when I asked for soft carne asada tacos and the lady said only shredded beef and crunchy tacos. So, I ordered a beef burrito and her reply was "beef only or you wanna something else in it". I said I want what ever comes inside a burrito. Well, once I got my burrito and ate half of it.  It was the worst burrito I have ever had.  It was very very bland and greasy no flavor at all. I can not believe  people wait in these long lines for this below standard food.  Terrible just terrible.  This is definitely place for tourist and for old people without taste buds.  In closing, sorry I wanted to believe the hype and gave it a fair shot but this is a definite not  good.

I first encountered Titos when I was preggers like 10 years ago. I thought it was the best thing since sliced bread. Fast forward 10 years later I came back at the request of my munchkin. He'd just gotten back from spending the summer with his dad and his lunch request was Tito's. I'd never brought him there so how'd he know? We get there and as expected the lines were long. I didn't realize that it was cash only so after he gave me the puppy dog eyes I decided to retrieve money from the atm that charged me an arm and a leg. Tacos w/Cheese are still pretty good from what I remembered 10 yrs earlier and the burritos were good as well. side note: remember when coming here don't expect authentic mexican food because in all reality it isn't.

I have been coming here since I was a kid and it is still one of my favorite hole in the wall mexican joints. Tito's is by no means gourmet mexican food. The menu is limited, but good. The tacos are a favorite of mine, I like them because they are simple, meat, lettuce and cheese. Yes, they are greasy, but you can't go wrong with the flavor. Their guacamole is not chunky, but almost pureed, but dang its good! I put it on each and every bite of the tacos. I like their tostadas, but haven't had their burritos or enchiladas. I am not a big salsa person, but I do like their sala which is very mild. Just a few bones to pick, it's cash only, which can be annoying from someone like me who doesn't usually carry cash. I also think it's silly to charge for cheese, but the cheese really does make the taco. You can order inside or out, but if you are there during the lunch rush be prepared to wait in line for a bit. Overall, a great place to stop by for a quick lunch if you are craving good, simple mexican food.

I've wanted to try Titos Tacos for the longest time now. I've seen commercials all over the place, and expected great things due to its standing on Jonathon Gold's 99 things to eat in LA. The tacos were okay, but I was a little disappointed that it didn't live up to its hype. They reminded me of a marriage between jack in the box tacos and taco bell tacos. The shell was like that of taco bell, but the fillings were extremely reminiscent of jack in the box tacos. The beef quality may have been better, but not much. If you're in the mood for tacos, I would skip Tito's. Try something else! However, if you're on a mission to try all of the things on Jonathon gold's 99, then maybe grab one taco just to try.

I love Tito's! I was perusing reviews and noticed that a lot of people bash Tito's on Yelp. Wow. The salsa is so good I order the largest extra they will give me every time. It's fresh and mild and tasty, I almost want to drink it. I am a mild salsa fan. The tacos are good, love the generous amount of cheese on everything, as long as you order the food with cheese and pay extra. But the meat and bean and burrito is so unbelievably good! I love that rich red sauce the meat is in, and the beans are fantastic. I am native to Los Angeles and have eaten my share of authentic Mexican food which I love also...but I still get in my car and drive from Long Beach to Tito's when the craving strikes. It's that good! Give me this Gringo food anytime! I prefer to go food from Tito's. I do not recommend eating on site. It's just not comfortable at all. Bring cash, like every other review reminds you to do.

This is a great spot to get full off some great tasting food for cheap! They have a small menu, but everything on it is good. I like to compare Tito's Tacos to In'N'Out, because they have a small menu that they specialize, cheap prices, good food, pay their workers a good wage (with benifits) and its a So-cal classic. The Tacos, get them with cheese, are delicious. The burritos are only meat and beans but they have this simplistic, savory, fulfilling quality that is unmatched. The chips and salsa come free and they are fantastic, get the jalapenos salsa and mix it with the regular salsa - nice n' spicy. Now, I read a couple reviews and I can't believe anyone would give Tito's less than 4 stars, and then compare them to Jack in the Crack's taco - WHICH ISN'T EVEN REAL MEAT - that should tell you all you need to know about these people's taste buds. They want some generic, processed food from Taco Bell - E-coli heaven. These people wouldn't know a good deal, and great tasting food if it smacked them in the face. I can't never get enough Tito's!

To all the Angelinos who rate this place average or below average, you are missing the simplicity of another era of City of the Angeles. Tito's Tacos us a reflection of how this metropolis grew up, simple ethnic Mexican food from the heart of Mexico. Hard shell tacos that are consistent as the the sunrise, salsa made the way salsa was originally envisioned, simple tomato salsa. Tortilla chips that are crunchy, yet not greasy. Burritos and tostadas also available as well. Generous portions will leave you satisfied everytime. The fact that this place is always busy speaks to its formula for success. With reasonable prices and a decor that's a throwback to the 70s (did I say simple again?), this is your place for hearty Mexican food.

I went to school when I was younger not far from Tito's so i've been coming here for a very long time. This isn't full blown mexican food at its finest, but it is Delicious! I don't live in LA anymore, but more than likely everytime i'm in town I always pay Tito's Tacos a visit. 2 tacos, 1 with cheese because it's enough to spread onto the other taco, and 1 meat, bean, and cheese burrito. yum!

It's okay, but not the best I've ever had. Tacos - very crunchy, cheesy, and you definitely should order the side of guac to dip it with Burrito - FULL of meat and pretty much nothing else...very filling Enchiladas - filled with tons and tons of cheese and onions...it was alright, not the best I would come here again if I'm craving really crunchy tacos, but for me it's a bit of a drive. There's parking along the streets and residential areas, but it's VERY crowded. I kind of like King Taco a little bit more and because they offer more variety, but this place isn't bad.

Look, we all know tacos are ... well ... tacos. There is nothing magical about them. Shell, meat, lettuce, cheese, accoutrements can only go so many ways. What can be so special about these tacos? Well, let's start with some of Tito's naysayers and then move on to the tacos. Who the hell goes anywhere in Southern California for "Authentic Mexican Food"? If you want authentic mexican food, go to Tijuana, get a nasty case of "Hershey Squirts", learn your lesson, and come home. Furthermore, if you go to Tito's tacos and order a "burrito" it may be a sign that you are illiterate, which is probably an indication you went to LA Unified. Go to Boris' Burritos or Bills Burritos or Belvedere Burritos for a burrito. Go to Tito's tacos for ... wait for it ... WAIT FOR IT ... TACOS. So, rabbit trail aside, what is the deal with these tacos? Why do they stand out? One, the meat is well seasoned and fresh. It does not come from a bag (cough, cough, Taco Hell). They put enough salt on the meat. I think few people realize the difference in taste that comes from appropriate saltation (yes I made up that word). Not using the right amount of salt on meat is akin to a 10 minute massage. Right when you can start to sense the difference, its all over. Moreover, there is enough meat, which brings us to our next point. The taco does not appear to be a folded up tostada. Don't you hate getting a taco that is basically lettuce and a shell with meat and cheese accidentally sprinkled in!? AHHH ... just charge me the $2 and throw it away!! I'll pay you to not eat it. Not at Tito's. At Tito's there is ENOUGH lettuce, but not too much. Next, the cheese. Cheese? Really? Thats a key ingredient? Yes, the cheese is KEY. I could nearly make an argument that the cheese is the lynch pin in the taco. Here is the magical secret. They shred it fresh that day. No pre-shredded cheese. OH ... MY ... GOSH. If you can't tell the difference between freshly shredded cheese and pre-grated cheese, you should probably just stick to a diet of mush and pine cones, thats good enough for you. Freshly grated cheese is more moist, it bunches, its flavor is MUCH brighter and much more intense. I occasionally wonder if freshly shredded cheese is better than just straight cheese. Its like being a kid and drinking your chocolate milk with a spoon. Theoretically it shouldn't taste any better ... but it does. Finally, the salsa. Now I'm a generous guy, so I'm going to give you an "out" on the salsa. If you like blended salsa, this salsa is second to none. If you like chunky salsa, then you'll like this salsa, but there will be others you like better. I'm willing to bet they make this salsa fresh nearly everyday. The tomato flavor is epic. It tastes so good. So go to Tito's order 37 tacos, chips, salsa and forget everything else. Recap: Authentic Mexican Food should give you the runs. An idiot orders a burrito at a place with "taco" right in the name. The meat is the strong foundation, it isn't a folded tostada, the cheese is ... well ... the cheesiest, and the salsa is the reason chips were invented.

This is the ONLY line in L.A. worth standing in! Simply the best hard shell tacos in L.A.!  Those that disagree are complete donkeys that most likely are used to "Old El Paso" store bought tacos and canned salsa.  If you are one of these donkeys then stay away!  This place is not for you, go eat at Taco Bell. Each Tito Taco is perfectly made with just the right amount of meat and cheese.  They are large, filling, and very satisfying.  Each taco order comes with fresh salsa and chips.  This is some of the best freshly made salsa one will ever encounter!  Such a simple pleasure and literally for pennies.   Tito's Tacos only accepts cash, so all you non cash carrying donkeys (You know who you are....the ones that pay for EVERYTHING with your debit card including .89 cent cups of coffee) STAY AWAY!  This place is not for you!  The lines move fast here partly due to CASH ONLY transactions, they don't have time to wait for donkey debit charging fool's cards to be approved! (Carry at least $20 in cash you cheap bastards).  In addition, their prices are so inexpensive you could almost pay for lunch with change found between the seat cushions of a couch (Donkeys exempt) The bottom line is Tito's Tacos has some of the best tacos in L.A. Yes, there are lines here, but unlike the line at brainwashed "Pink's"....these lines actually move quickly and are not filled with mindless fools with no taste buds.  Tito's Tacos is also your best bang for the buck but is clearly not for everyone.  Enjoy!

So my friend told me about Tito's tacos and how wonderful the are and that the salsa is to die for.... UMMM... the salsa is just blended tomato....no kick what so ever...with what looks like some onion and lil bitty piece of jalapeno...can be drunk with a good size straw... tacos are hard shell with lettuce and cheese and cheese.... Not exactly the best the best taco but not the worst... (leave that to taco bell and del taco) Yes I will admit that I do like these tacos every now and then as they remind me of when my mom made these puffy tacos with ground beef and cheese... so I gave them a 3 cuz of nostalgia... If you love shredded cheddar then this will be taco heaven...  Order a couple and bring a Jalapeno or two to bite in between your tacos... Chips are good though....

First of all i noticed the review stars are pretty average looking for a great place to eat like this. But then i understood why since if you go to this place please just stick to what this place does best. Stick with their popular beef taco with cheese and the chips and salsa you get with your order. THATS IT! I tasted other items and was hugely dissapointed especially their not at all tasty burritos. So tacos salsa and chips and they are worth this 5 star all by themselves but overall i guess it would be like a 3.5.

Tito's Tacos is one of those landmark places in LA. You must give it a try. They only take cash. The lines sometimes look long but they generally move fast. The food here is not high end Mexican but it is all cooked from scratch and seems to have its own flavor I can't find at any other taco stand. Whenever I go past the area my car mysteriously stears to Titos Tacos.....  :) They only use shredded steer meat. No ground hamburger here. One of the great items here is their salsa. They give you generous amounts of it. A very unique flavor. My favs are the tacos with cheese and chili con carne and refined beans. I very often bring home dinner from Titos and that makes my wife happy. And if she is happy, so am I......... Try it, you won't be sorry.

I drive past this place on my way to work every day and I have always wanted to try it. I finally made up my mind last Saturday night, hoping to find the new local mecca of taco flavor in my neighborhood. Boy was i wrong ;) This are NOT tacos tacos, these are tacobell/schoolcafeteria aka fake tacos. First off, the place has a horrible small parking lot, it is dark and dirty and makes you think that you will be stabbed on your way to get tacos. I have ate at several tacos places in Inglewood and never felt as unsafe in a parking lot. Then when you get to the place, surprise surprise they don't take atm or credit card. The ATM is outside in a corner where you can easily be mugged, again second opportunity for you to die before you even get tacos. If you survive either of those inconveniences, the line to get tacos is huge. Here you are in a line full of people that don't know better hoping your wait will be worth it, it def will not be. When you get to the ordering line you will be greeted by a overworked woman who's tired look will tell you that whatever she will hand you is the product of a sweat shop style environment. The place reeks of overused oil, the workers look hot and bothered and the food will not live up to the name of "taco". Rather the label should be changed to fried canned beans inside fried tortilla shell that taco bell rejected. The bean burritos were bland and the tacos were nasty enough to not merit being finished, and if there's something I hate is food bad enough to not be eaten. I made my way back out to the parking lot disappointed that I was fooled into coming when I saw a diner across the lot, I made my way to it only to be disappointed by food as greasy and disgusting as the taco place :(

Oh Tito's tacos, how I adore thee. There's definitely something magical about a Tito's Taco. This isn't your gourmet blah blah LA vendor. Simply, it's a taco with some serious cheese and very good salsa. Sometimes, the simple things are all you need. As for Tito's Tacos, it can't get any better. You'll find yourself eating what's falling over in your box or like me, trying to hold back your cousin from eating your Taco. Wait, that doesn't sound right... Either way, you can't go wrong with a taco or five from Titos. For all you old Power 105.9 schoolers out there....THIS IS TITO, THIS IS TITO.... The Salsa is also Michellin rated. I just made that up. But it does taste like it is.

In the neighborhood, I gave it a solid shot. The salsa tasted like watered down picante.  The guacamole didn't have much of a flavor at all. The chips tasted oily even though they were dried.  The tamale was just okay.  My grandmother isn't even Mexican.  She's Cajun thru-and-thru.  And her tamales destroy these things. I mean I understand that this place is fast food but damn man. Maybe I caught them on a bad day?

The lady in the line in front of us described Tito's as the "Inn-n-out of tacos" when she found out we were noobs.  That's a bold statement because Inn-n-out ranks up there with Star Wars IV, Wham!, and Cherry Coke in my book. The menu is pretty much a joke since it's written on the wall inside of the restaurant.  I fumbled my way through the menu and ordered tacos and burritos like they were going to be my last meal on earth.  I received enclosed recycled boxes that look like the boxes you get your business cards in...and took them back to my patio table.   Overall, a solid taco.  Hard shell only.  No soft tacos at Tito's.  The beef was good, albeit a little chewy.  I happen to be a cheese fan so I loved the fresh grated cheddar cheese that is piled on top of my tacos.  This may not be the most authentic taco you have, but I understand Tito's is like a cultural institution on the West Side.

Tito's Tacos is killing the Mexican fast food game right now! Best food in LA in my opinion if you're looking for Mexican food. Parking is very very limited so don't ever think finding a spot is going to be easy. Seating is very limited as well. You can dine inside or outside but there be at least 100 people lined up outside and in to get this amazing food at a place with the capacity of maybe 40 people. The burritos are http://bomb.com!!! My fam is the meat, cheese, rice, and beans burrito! The tacos go!! They're delicious and addictive so ordering one or two is out of the question lol. Even though this place is always packed, the service is surprisingly fast.

My review from 2009 really hasn't changed. Here's my outlook. Since senior year in high school, I've been enjoying Tito's Tacos. I tried to get snobbish in the 1980s, declaring that Tito's weren't "authentic" Mexican tacos and that they were totally "Americanized". Their tamales certainly aren't gourmet, and their enchiladas are an inelegant mess. But now I'm a real adult, and I realize all those comments were CRAP! If I want authentic, there are a dozen places within 5 minutes of Tito's I could and do go to. But ya know, Tito's just f-ing hits the spot WAY too many times. IT IS WHAT IT IS. And it is CONSISTENT for over 30 years. I don't think the glory days are gone at all.....other than adding a couple of items, I don't think the food has changed at all in my adult life, and it's always that sorta Culver City good. I always order a combination of tacos, tamale (beef or chicken), enchilada, rice, and drink. Funny that you have to order the tacos WITH cheese, even though without is nothing like a real Mexican taco. (Imagine a Taco Bell Al Fresco Taco....no cheese...lower calories). The tacos are always the crunchy hard-shelled variety, deep-fried, and they have that reliable taste. I usually just add the red salsa (it fools ya....looks day-glo, but it does have a little kick), but sometimes the super hot green stuff. The cheese is that shreded cheddar mess, but DAMN, it hits the spot! The tamales are decent, but what I like is that nice reddish-brown sauce on top. I dip my chips in that and love it. I regularly go to Tamara's Tamale a few miles away for SUPERB tamales, but when I just want good heartburn tamales, Tito's does fine. The enchilada? What a friggin' mess, but who cares? Beefy sauce, tortilla, cheese....it hits the spot too.  The rice? Always decent, and I'm licking the container. I tried a burrito only once all these years; Chipotle it ain't. Good old-fashioned sloppy burrito with cheese and tender meat in sauce oozing all over the place. And/or with beans. More ooze. It was good, but don't dare eat it while driving! Tons of chips, and I go through all my salsas and sauces with those chips. I just take the place as it is. Reliable 1970s pop-culture Mexican-American tacos, with reliable side dishes, in a quirky stand that unites all the ethnicities and age groups and income levels of the area. Just like Tommy's, Pinks, Johnnies Pastrami next door, and Disneyland. Stop complaining and just ENJOY it. Certainly better than Taco Bell or Del Taco, without the high-toned organic and clinical perfection of Chipotle. Sit down and eat and watch the people show. And just friggin' ENJOY it.

This place can do no wrong in my heart. I will always have a special place for Tito's simple, yet tasty burritos. Yea yea, I know they are famous for Tacos, but when you get the right combination of meat goop, fresh & thick flour tortilla, guacamole, salsa, japapeno, and chip in the same bite. There is nothing better. You gotta get a little piece of everything to really appreciate it! The wait is long most of the time... but its worth it everytime!

Imagine yourself on the 405 North, just above the 90 and it hits you. The largest poo you ever have to take. And as you come upon the Washington Place Exit you realize that you cannot hold it and you fear you cannot find a place to relieve yourself. But alas! You exit anyways and find yourself headed towards Tito's Tacos. I cannot attest to their food, being a cash only business and me being with only my credit cards. But their bathrooms are magnificent, well... enough for me to be able to use them and be on my merry way. I will eventually go back to try the food and see if they can redeem that extra star which was held back by the in ability to purchase due to an archaic form of monetary transaction. Our paths will cross again Tito... and I will try your Tacos.

How did this place get popular? Im guessing once is the most any one of any amount of mexican descent has ever ate there. The tacos are garbage, the burritos are just as bad. The salsa is crap!

Seriously now, what is the big deal about this place?! The tacos get 1 star from me, they're just not all that. It's dry and has no flavor. Sorry to burst your bubble 5-star givers. Now, the beef they put in the burritos are pretty good, but when you ask for rice, it's either mushy or not evenly cooked. I've bitten into hard grains of rice a couple of times. The salsa is definitely that best thing about this place. BRING CASH!

The sauce for the chips was ok. It had flavor, unlike anything else there. To call it cafeteria food, would be an insult lunch ladies around the globe.

3 stars is right.  Long lines(10-15 minutes), watery salsa, tasteless guacamole and cold chips do not make up for the delicious crunchy tacos.  The beef in the tacos is amazing, but it needs to be layered better, you end up eating one bite lettuce and cheese, and one bite beef.  The taco shells are at least hot unlike the chips.  The burritos are also really good flour tortillas with some sort of mystery meat and gooey beans. The reason for the line to me is clear.  The way that this place operates, your order taker actually goes and gets your food for you.  If they had one person taking orders and one person making each food item, things would move a lot more quickly. Expect to spend about $5-10 here with food and drink.  I recommend going next door to Johnny's Pastrami, that place is actually really good.

I truly don't understand the fascination with Tito's. At my old job it was like a cult following. You couldn't say anything negative about Tito's or you'd get a mouthful from one of the loyal devotees. It's not even real MEXICAN food! Maybe that's my problem... I hear tacos and I think "oh cool, mexican." Such is not the case with Tito's. It's ground beef in a deep fried shell, lettuce, and shredded cheese. Then they give you some watered down "salsa" that is similar to the one you get at El Pollo Loco. I'm not a fan, I don't like coming here. It's overrated. Parking sucks. It's always crowded. It's overhyped. I'm seriously getting irritated just thinking about this place.

I don't get it.  OK I get that it's like "back in the day" but does that mean that they have to use poor quality meat? Waited in long line to see if it's all that I've heard.  I didn't eat half of my taco.  Not good at all.

I have been coming to Tito's ever since I can remember. At least 30+ years! That says a lot! I have always gotten their regular burrito, it's just meat, sauce and beans, no cheese, and the tacos with cheese! Their salsa is tasty, not your usual mexican salsa, but it's good, the guacamole is more of a saucy consistency. I see that the ratings for Tito's runs the gammet from 1 star to 5 stars. To me the longgggg lines outside and inside speak volumes, not to mention the parking situation. This place to me has been my comfort food forever, and no on can make me change my mind...My husband even loves it here...he doesn't mind driving all the way from Torrance to get his taco and burrito fix. This place is an institution in my book and I hope it never goes away!

Had to see what all the "HYPE" was about & was very disappointed. Arrived to find a HUGE line, that made me assume that this place was very good. After waiting inline for about 30 minutes maybe 40 we ordered tacos with cheese & tamales. Lets just say that taco bell is tastier than this place and i HATE fast food chains. El Chato Truck makes this place look like mcdonalds. Now thats a big statement for a food truck. Never coming here again!

Been eating at Tito's since the 70's when it was located where Cinco de Mayo is now.  The food is more nostalgic than anything as time has tempered my tastes for lard, watered down salsa, and glow-in-the-dark cheese.  AND to the young newbie that served me - it's good that you take your job seriously and want to make a good impression BUT!  Don't be sweating customers over a penny.  Yes! Almost didn't get my food because I was penny short!?!? Funny how many pennies came flying over my shoulder onto the counter in disgust.   Burritos are pretty tasty.

So after living in Culver City for almost a year and a half and seeing all those Tito's Tacos commercials, I finally had to try it.  This was just a few months ago, btw.  I was really hungry one night and decided to pass by on my way home.  Luckily there was no line (well not as long of a line as usual) so i pulled in and ordered some food excited that I was finally going to get to try these famous tacos. They were good, but didn't live up to the expectations I that they had been brought up to.  It just seemed like a normal hard shell taco to me, nothing special.  They're not as pricey as some people have commented because these tacos were a pretty decent size, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come back here. I think most people who love this place grew up in the area, so it's more a sense of nostalgia for them. However in my opinion this place is in the same ball park as Pink's, where the food is good, but highly over-rated.

Back in the day...(can I effectively use the term back in the day now that i'm a year short of a quarter century?) there was a Tito's Tacos in Anaheim near my Nana's house where I spent my summer days.  My uncle was friends with the owner and he would always bring home this loaded brown box. I just remember this HUGE burrito coming out with these HUGE tortilla chips and lots of salsa...the crunchy tacos COVERED in the brightest orange cheese I had ever seen. It was a treat. Unfortunately, that Tito's closed years ago, but every once and a while, my dad has a project in Culver City and I get a ring or a text saying "picked up tito's...are you in?". And before I can reply, i'm in my car on my way to the hearty, mexican, deliciousness of Tito's Tacos. It's weird because this place breaks all the rules of mexican food for me (brought to you by the "chicana power" voice inside my head): 1. "Greasy/Cheesy/Crunchy Tacos are never ok": These are greasy, cheesy and crunchy. Not at all authentic, but they're good. Real good. 2. "Burritos are what you make at home when you have leftovers, not something you order at a restaurant": "Yeah, yeah...shut up." The beef and bean burritos are amazing.  The meat's flavor isn't ALL THAT...the beans are delicious, but it's the sauce that makes it.  And that's all it is: beef, beans, sauce, tortilla. delicious. 3. "You don't order tamales unless you've met the abuela or tia who made them first": These tamales make no sense, but again, you pour that sauce all over them and they're so delicious. Their salsas are majorly tasty, too.  I can't really explain why i love it here so much...maybe it's because my childhood is attached to it...maybe it's because it's because i have it so infrequently... or maybe, just maybe it's because it's so wrong--it's right.

"I love Titos Tacos, and you'll love Titos too" (I have the cheesy commercial stuck in my head). So, first off I do not compare Titos to "real" Mexican food because I truly feel they created their own special recipe that is like no other that I've ever tasted. I have been eating Titos over 25 years and the only thing that has changed are their prices :/ Same owner and the same great flavors. Favorites: Taco w/ cheese and meat & cheese burrito. Tips: Parking in the lot can be a hit or miss but there is plenty of parking on the street. Do not park at Johnnie's Pastrami because they will tow. CASH only! ATM machine outside. If the lines outside look long, try inside...in my experience they tend to be shorter. If you are dining in, have someone from your party search for a table while you order...attack like a hawk, regulars know the drill ;) If the order is more than $75 you can call ahead or order online. There is a reason Titos is ALWAYS crowded and has been in business for many decades...and it's not because of the "friendly" staff. I will always be a fan! :)

With Tito's, there is no gray area.  You either love this place like a mother loves her only child, or you despise it with a passion.  I fall into the former, having been weened on this stuff since I was in the womb.  I'm not going to lie and say this is the greatest Mexican food ever.  It's certainly not.  This is Los Angeles after all, and the amount of authentic Mexican would take you a lifetime to get through.  But I don't go to Tito's for authentic, and neither should you.  You should go to for the tacos, with their hard shells and bright orange cheese and, contrary to many of the reviews here, tasty shredded beef.  You should go for the burritos.  I go for the bean and cheese, which are hot and melty and fatty and delicious.  You should go to for the salsa, which pretty much makes any food taste even better.  And you should go for the ambiance, which feels frozen in time, whether that time is the 1960s or the 1980s.  Or, maybe you shouldn't go at all.  I'll be more than happy not to have to wait in line behind and get my Tito's Tacos faster.

Epic. Fucking epic guys... But is it good? Absolutely yes--and not really at the same time. Here's the thing, like many reviews bring up this is not authetic mexican food. It's more like fast food american tex-mex. So if you're coming here for some type of ... culturally enriching experience, well... this probably isn't what you're looking for. Came here and got the following: Tito Taco, Rice, Beans, Gaucamole, Chicken Tamale. All of which were pretty good. The amount of food it turned out to be was out of control. It was literally a huge box of food with a devastatingly absurd mound of chips poured EVERYWHERE. I kinda feel like this place is more about the experience vs. quality of the food--but that being said I really encourage people to go. It's fun and cheap.

Best old school hard shell taco in town. Just like my mom used to try and make in the 1970s. I usually get 2 hardshell tacos - cheese in just one of them. And then I spread the very generous portion of shredded cheese between the two of them. There's just too much cheese otherwise. This all cash place is a great takeaway or a spot to grab a bench and just devour your prey. I used to live 2 blocks away and frequent the joint all the time (too often for my good health honestly). But now that I live a few miles away it's just a rare treat on a late night when I've missed dinner once again. Just be sure to get there before it closes or you're stuck with the sub-par tacos at the 24 hour joint next door.

Delicious relatively cheap mexican food in a very casual atmosphere. I think my favorite part of my Tito's Tacos feast was their delicious salsa, despite not being spicy it is so fresh tasting. I highly recommend the taco's and tostadas (with cheese). After that the tamales are good, but I preferred the seasoning/spices on the chicken tamale over the beef tamale. And finally, the enchilada is cheesy corn tortilla goodness. I got this feast to go, which they did a great job of packaging it all up.

After hearing good things about Tito's, I had to try it. What kind of yelper would I be not to check out a place with 1500+ reviews. Well thank god I took my food to-go because if Tito was watching me eat my taco and and tamale, he would see disappointment written across my face. Taco was flavorless. Even after a good dousing of their over-salty salsa, it was still lacking. I loved their cheese but the meat itself was just bland. And despite the tamale having a good meat to masa ratio, the masa was really dry. Would I ever go back? No. J- walking across the street and going to a cash only place that I order from the street? I think I'll pass.

I was feeling nostalgic about San Diego Mexican food, and had heard that Tito's was legendary for its Mexican food this side of LA. However, what I got was a substandard product. Their taco meat was dry and tasted like cardboard, the cheese was highly generic, and the taco shell was stale. Even the plentiful chips that came with the taco required generous amounts of salsa to be considered palatable. Tito's "meat and bean" burrito was not bad. The "meat" part consisted of a chili-slop that was as greasy and salty as any I've stumbled upon, while the beans were substandard and boring. However, the tortilla was warm and tasty. To top off the bad food, the line was way too long and the ATM out front was over-priced. If, at any time, Tito's tacos was a respectable taco shop, it has lost any semblance of that now.

Tito's Tacos is not your traditional authentic mexican restaurant, how ever the tacos are very yummy. I don't really care for anything else on the menu. They only take cash and FYI, there are TWO lines inside...it's clearly labeled above the cashiers, Line 1, Line 2.

Just as their jingle says, "I love Tito's Tacos! The only thing better than a Tito's taco, is two!" They have the best Tacos and burritos in LA. I love the meat and cheese burrito, it has so much flavor and is very filling. Tito's also has good enchiladas and tamales, but I usually stick with a taco and burrito. Don't let the long lines scare you, they go pretty fast and it is definitely worth the wait. Just remember who took your order so you can be ready to pay when they come back with your food. And another good thing to note is they only take cash, but there is an ATM next to the building. Their salsa is good but pretty milid, but if you ask, you can get a side of chopped jalapenos for free, which I usually do and then mix them in with my salsa. Titos is definitely worth the wait and if you've never been go today! You won't be disappointed.

I went, I stood in line, I ordered, I ate, i conquered. Its Sunday evening and I'm totally over the basic fast food in West La. So lets go to Titos. Call me stupid but the menu confused the hell out of me. So its my turn, " Hi can I have a carne asada burrito ?" UM WE DON'T HAVE ASADE JUST THIS AND POINTS AT DOWN. Apparently they have only shredded beef, cooool good thing that burrito wasn't for me and my boyfriend. So ordered a meat and bean burrito and a taco for him and I had the chicken tamale. They make everything on the spot and monster fill the box with chips, really? thanks. The chicken tamale was sooooo good. Believe it or not it filled me up. The burrito looked gross, but again the boyfriend devoured it. Thank god I'm not a fan of meat because the shredded beef looked like it would have made me sick for days.

Expect that you might have to park on the street, that you have to pay in cash, and you have to wait in line to get your food.  You might not like this but they always have long lines and the their business model seems to be working for them.   The food is delicious.  I'm a bit of a heretic in that I always order the burrito (bean, meat, and cheese) in stead of tacos.  I must be honest, most of my friends think their food is greasy--and their tacos possibly are but their burritos are absolutely delicious with good quality meat.   The place started out as a deli and not a Mexican food restaurant so don't expect them to have authentic dishes.  However, for a unique taste and experience that is head and shoulders above comparably priced Taco Bell and Baja Fresh and I'd say even better than many $10-$14 sit-down Mexican resaurants, this place can't be beaten.

Boy, am I glad to see three stars overall for Tito's. All my friends swear by it, and they are convinced that this is the best taco ever. How 'bout.....it's certainly an upgrade from Taco Bell, but nothing more? Not a fan of the hard-shell tacos that become soggy from the meat. Not a fan of the side of meat juice with which I'm not completely sure what to do. Not a fan of the "salsa" which is just pureed tomatoes. I think these tacos could use some tapatio sauce, but they didn't even have that! They just gave me chopped up carrots/onion/jalapeno mix. Sad panda. At least the tacos taste pretty good. I'm not going to knock that. But really, at the end of the day I crave the traditional double corn tortilla tacos with carnitas/asada/pastor. Seriously. I want to eat them for dinner every night.

Bring CASH. The menu isn't extensive. They have tacos ($1.75...I think), enchiladas, and random a la carte things (guacamole, chili, etc). I heard the tacos were good so I ordered a couple of those and an enchilada. Tacos were delish! They really pack it in and really go overboard on the cheese...just how I like it. Enchilada was too much sauce for me. AND they give you SO MUCH tortilla chips! AND a whole thing of salsa that is actually enough for all the chips that they give you--not in one of those tiny plastic containers ugh. This place must be a big hit cus at 8pm on a Monday night, the place was packed. I'll probably be back to cure my late night munchies because of their late hours and yummm tacos. For under $5, I was satisfied.

By the time I found parking underneath the 405...my LDL had already risen by 42 points. This place is an institution...with one of the most memorable jingles in commercial-land (note: 'memorable' is not always good).  People have been lining up outside of this west side institution for decades. On a related note, human beings have been smoking cigarettes for decades. There's a certain basic instinct within human beings to crave fat...read about it.  It is true, we crave fat because we are hard wired to crave high calorie things that will sustain us. The fat drips off these tacos...literally.  It's kind of like the one time I ordered a monster taco late night at a Jack n the Box in San Diego when I was 21.  I got back to my apartment, fell asleep next to the taco, and when I woke up, I saw something I'd never seen before...a translucent hard taco shell.  The shell was SEE-THROUGH because the fat had soaked right through it.

They make THE BEST tacos. Punto (Period). Their burritos and tamales are okay (their meat is cooked to a nice tenderness), but really - it's the tacos that make it worth it to stand in their ever-long line with people jostling you on every side. The cheese that they pile onto their tacos is amaaaazing - don't even consider getting it w/o the cheese!

I'm surprised to read so many negative reviews - this has always been one of my top junk food spots.  Titos Tacos may not be the most authentic or healthiest tacos around but to me it is ALL about the salsa.  I know I'm not the only one because if you google "Titos tacos salsa recipe" you will find quite a few forum threads of people trying to copycat the goods.  I even found one where someone dumpster-dove through Titos trash trying to sleuth out the ingredients.   Shredded beef tacos with cheese and a large chips and salsa and I'm a happy girl... everything gets covered in salsa. I practically drink it.  I even got my midwestern boyfriend hooked.  There is a reason there is always a line down the block. One complaint - c'mon Titos! It's time to start accepting credit cards.  I'm tired of limiting the amount of tacos I can bring home to how much cash I have in my wallet.  It's never enough. 100% honestly worth the drive from Ventura! EDIT: 8/19/11 I tried one of the copycat recipes last night and it's DAMN close!

One of my old skool favorites! Inexpensive food that is just good. I mean--- it's not going to win a Michelin stars, but it tases damn good! The parking seriously SUCKS!  and it is known to have lines out the door. But it is always worth the wait. We go to Tito's almost every time we are in LA.

They open up at 10 am so you dont have to worry about the lines.  The food is still priced the same from when I was in high school.. hella affordable.  The Chicken Tamale is http://bomb.com!! The staff still barely smiles..lol its cool though, they get my order right every time.

It's just like the song says, "I love Tito's tacos, you love Tito's too!"  I have been waiting forevahhh to come out to this place ever since I moved to the OC.  When I saw that yellow sign getting closer, my heart skipped a beat. I ordered my usual: a cheese taco and a side of rice.  If you think I'm nuts for wanting to come all the way out to LA just to order these 2 items, then you simply don't understand Tito's.  A greasy taco topped with an abundance of noodle sized shredded cheese...  A cup of rice that I drench in Tito's special salsa...and who needs utensils when you can use the tortilla chips to scoop up the salsa rice!  Now do you get it (or did I just disgust you)? The meat and cheese burrito is pretty yummy too (but a bit heavy for me), and the chips and salsa...oh yes, the chips and salsa :9  Hubby likes their tamales too, but I think the rest of the menu items are just okay.  My last soda was a bit watered down as well, so don't expect everything to take you to Fantasy Island (ohhh don't tell me you don't know this show!).

Meat and cheese burrito and a taco with cheese as well as a "large" 20 oz Pepsi to go is a tasty lunch indeed. Line up out front and wait for the friendly ladies to take your order then head back to the kitchen to make your food fresh to order. The collection of 50 cent pieces that they always give out as part of your change clogs up your ashtray like the cheese clogs up your arteries, but the food is hot and fresh, the counter ladies friendly and the food tasty.

Brevity is not my forte, but an impeccable taco speaks for itself. If you time it right, there's no line. Parking's not an issue since my best friend lives a block away and in my West Side days I just rode my bike. If I had to park, it might piss me off during lunch rush. But my attitude rarely gets between myself and my Mexican food. The End.

Pros: - In my opinion, the best hard-shell tacos in LA! - Their salsa is really simple, yet very delicious; I'm absolutely addicted. - You get tons of free chips and salsa with every order. - You get to watch as they make your food. - The menu is fairly small and easy to remember (similar to In-N-Out). Cons: - Long lines (because the food is so good). - Hard to find parking, due to small parking space. - No traditional Mexican drinks (only soda). Where's the horchata??? - Very limited seating. Sometimes you can't even find a place to sit. - They only accept cash. No debit/credit cards. However, they do have an ATM outside. Note: don't let the cons overwhelm you. After all, its the quality/taste of the food that matters most, right? You can't always expect to be treated like royalty everywhere you go. I've been coming to Tito's since I was about five years old. And my parents have been coming here since the early-80's! Yes, it's not 100% authentic Mexican food, but it's still extremely satisfying to my taste buds. I usually only order their tacos, chips, and salsa. But their burritos and all other food items are equally delicious. This place is pretty historic; they've been around since 1959! They know what they're doing. And it definitely shows in their tasty food. Tito's is great for lunch, dinner, or a late-night snack. Just as In-N-Out mastered the burger, Tito's has mastered the hard-shell "gringo" taco. This review has made me very hungry. I think I'll head down to Tito's right now. Tip: to people who have the "dry taco" syndrome, pour some of that tasty salsa or guacamole inside your tacos. Problem solved!

Tito's, this place is ok. I know it has a cult following and it's not bad, but it's not outstanding either. The tacos are good. I like them and the place is always crowded.

MAN, WHAT AN EXPERIENCE!!! Mass produced Taco's for the insatiable masses waiting to devour them = Tito's Taco's. It was recommended to us by friends as a must try during our visit to LA and aside from the long lines both outside and inside... we enjoyed our food very much. Can't say that I will ever wait in line like that again, but if you are familiar with Chicago's Pepe's Taco's, you will likely find this place to taste very similar (just with really hard shells instead of soft). Pricing is great, which is probably why they are so popular. We tried a little of everything and enjoyed all our food. Put them on your 'Must Try' list when visiting the city (along with In n' Out Burger and Phillipe's).

If I could, I would give these guys 6 stars, but since that is not possible I will content myself with a positive review. In short, this place is INSANELY GOOD! Thay have like 10 mexican cooks making crunchy tacos and creamy guacamole salsa so fast their hands get blurry, you just see them running back and forth, and I'm not even sure how they fit them all in there. In any case, the food is sooo good! But don't take it from me, head over there at ten o'clock at night and wait in line for 40 minutes because the line is a block long!

Honestly. How can you not like titos tacos?! I always get a taco and a burrito with meat. So good! The meat is really tender and the cheese is really melty (is that a word?). At first try, the food is quite forgettable, but within a week, you start to crave it. Its weird. The salsa is a little strange since its all blended but its easier to eat it in the tacos and scoop with the chips. I like that. Id definitely recommend that you try this place because it really is good! I dont live near this place so Ill volunteer rides to the airport just so I can be in the neighborhood and come get some titos! Just saying. Note- Parking sucks and its cash only so come prepared! (There is an ATM outside though)

Tito's and i have been best friends for more than 34 years, ever since i was a poor  ucla student  living in palms. In all that time, tito's has not changed their product. Call this stand a historical monument and wrap that buririto! All meat of course, clove scented, chile colorado swimming in a mahogany sauce  nestled in among orange cheese shreds. I know why it's so good...this visit i saw a cook shouldering a 1 x 2 foot block of lard over to the stove and dropping it into the fryer. Yes, we customers watched with mouths agape. The lard was for the chips and tacos, of course, but evidence that tito's is not afraid of fat! Don't eat here if you don't love fat, that colorado is loaded with fatty bits of beef and grease bubbled love sauce.  Turns out meebo, my dog, loves burritos  too! She used some magic and caused the half buritto i was saving for next day's lunch to melt through the plastic dog poo (unused) bag i put it in. Plop, on the sidewalk and wolfed in a moment. I nearly cried while she licked her lips. Oh well, i see a pilgrimage to tito's in my future, again! Once you eat at tito's, sf's mission tacqueries will never satisfy. Forewarned...

Delicious, cheap, and clean. The ladies sometimes are not the nicest but they serve the food quick and fresh. The tacos are my favorite. I suggest you bring your own soda though because they do not give free refills for there $2.00 sodas which are primarily composed of ice. Kind of annoying. But aside from that delicious food, salsa is medium hot.

I dont have an issue with shredded beef but i prefer ground beef. They really load the cheese on there. The Salsa really let me down and i was disappointed. No taste no spice... :-/.

Over-rated, under-flavored. I don't get why people wait in long lines for this. $5 for shredded beef tacos with lettuce, and they charge you extra for cheese. No onions, cilantro, or anything else on them.  No other meat choices for tacos, only beef.  The meat was juicy, but wasn't flavorful.  The cheese was rather bland too.  I'd rather go to Jack in the Box for tacos than these guys.

Tito's is one of those places that you either LOVE or HATE. There's really no middle round to be had. Personally, having grown up with this place, it's become a guilty pleasure for me and remains dear to my heart. The tacos are good and greasy and perfect for those days when you're craving crappy food. Even though I do love the food, I will admit it's gotten somewhat overrated (it wouldn't be my last meal if I had the choice). So, as a local spot, it's amazing, but if you're traveling from far away expecting an experience to rock your socks off, you're probably not going to get it here. It's cash only, parking sucks, and don't expect he service to be overly flowery and welcoming because it's not. Yet despite this, I will continue to frequent this place because I love it even with some of it's flaws.

Who are you kidding?  Huh Tito?  Have you been sued for false advertising, because that thing is not a taco, it is an abomination.  Tito has succeeded in contaminating the collective colon of Culver City.   You could get a better burrito at the LA Unified School District.   I keep waiting for Bobby Flay to show up here and take a big dump in a tortilla, fry it up in a pan, top it with lettuce and low grade cheese and win a taco contest against this place.

You have got to be kidding me... 2 stars because the food stayed in my stomach and didn't come back up as salsa for my razor sharp tortilla chips. Unbelievable. Titos tacos is unquestionably famous on the westside. When I was going to school at Ucla, this was a place that students had on their college bucket-lists as well as a place that RA's would take their floor for socials. The restaurant even has their own jingle! unfortunately the food and fame simply do NOT match up. My order: meat and bean burrito with cheese, chips, and guacamole with a coke. (looking back, I might've had better luck with their tacos... After all, the place isn't called titos burritos). What I got: The first bite revealed meat and beans that were so watery and runny that I couldn't tell each apart from the other. The tortilla tasted like a counter top and the chips were so hard that I was able to cut my burrito in half easily without a knife. If you're looking for good Mexican food, you'll have a better chance of finding it at a taco bell than here at titos tacos.

After seeing the Tito's Taco commercial and having the catchy song stuck in my head, my boyfriend and I came here after months to finally check it out. Came here at 3 in the afternoon and was not much of a line.  The taco's was good but it reminded me of those microwaveable beef taquito meat.    The burrito was way too soggy and just felt like a big mess.  Everything's pretty cheap though so not complaining.  You get what you pay for =)  there's free chips and salsa : ) i like dipping the chips in the salsa and then adding my spillover cheese from the taco on top :) cash only.

After seeing commercials for this place and hearing a lot of hype I decided to give this place a try. I came here on Sunday afternoon and there was a good amount of people here , but I didn't really have to wait too long. Anyways, since this place is called Tito's TACOS i decided to get their tacos...tacos here are $1.75 without cheese and with the addition of cheese is 60 cents per taco...which is a rip off. Salsa and chips come free with it though and I ordered the green salsa which was an additional charge. The tacos tasted very fresh and good. Not spectacular mean it was good, but I would not drive all the way to Culver City just for it...something I would get if I was in the area...maybe... I think I can get comparable or even better crispy tacos from Aribas. So I probably won't go here again.... Oh btw it is CASH ONLY too!

Only thing better than a Tito's Taco is two? I don't really thinks so. After years of hearing rave reviews from friends I hit up Tito's and bought $60 worth of tacos for my kitchen staff. I was first in line for their 10:00 opening and thought the service was great and loved how even though the place is old it was clean. A HUGE line quickly formed behind me increasing my excitement for these legendary tacos. I got the tacos quickly and made the quick 4 mile drive back to my Restaraunt. My guys made rice and beans to go along with the tacos and the chips with salsa they gave us. The anticipation was high for all of us. We picked them up, open wide, and chomped down...on the most average taco I have ever had. At best. THIS IS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA! Next to Mexico itself we have the best Mexican food in the world and this just didn't cut it for me. I give the food a 2 stars rating but bumped my overall to 3 because I loved the service. Save your time and money and just hit one of the hundred back street taco trucks.

Not bad. I had a couple Tito's Tacos w/cheese and a side of rice + beans. The rice and beans were the stars for me. You can tell this food is all homemade (as it should be). The place isn't phenomenal and it's perhaps a little overrated. I'd rather make a trip to Taqueria de Anda in Santa Ana. But whatev's. It's really good. I liked the salsa, too. Kinda El Pollo Loco style (not chunky, very tomato-y). Still very, very good.

There is something dangerous in these tacos. It's compulsive eating, addictive, and you know its terrible for you, but you certainly don't care. Before going to Tito's Tacos, please manage your expectations. It's a taco stand on the corner of a busy intersection in a working class part of town. If you want quality Mexican food--go to Casa Sanchez, El Torito, El Cholo, or better yet drive down to Santa Ana. The tacos are so good, but let's be real...the meat isn't succulent, the vegetables aren't organic, but that's not why I come to Tito's! I come for pretty damn tasty tacos at a decent price! If you want 8 tacos, large salsa, large guacamole, refried beans, soda, and a cornucopia of chips that can feed 2 people for around $20--this is a place to go! Tito's is a classic in LA--a local hot spot and the line is always around the corner. You'll wait 25-30 minutes on the weekend to get your food, and the restaurant is not very clean, and the service isn't overly friendly. But dammit, its cheap, addictive tacos, and its a guilty pleasure! My friends and I can't really explain what it is about these tacos that is so good. But it's like crack. If I have Tito's on a Friday night, on Saturday morning I'm interested in another round..guaranteed. And I feel disgusting, but defiantly I return each and every time. Tito's Tacos...an Angelino tradition!

Now that I don't live in LA anymore, I feel free to tell the truth (without fear of reprisals). Titos is mediocre at best, on a good day. The line outside? No idea why, maybe's it free crack or something. Soggy, floppy, flavorless mystery meat. But hey, it's cheap right?

Classic LA establishment. The food used to be a lot better but recently some things have changed. The chips are now a lot healthier/less greasy, which is a bad thing. I always opt for their tacos but only get cheese on half of my tacos because they give you SO much cheese. Lines can be long and seating is often lacking. The parking lot fills up too. Sundays are usually the busiest day.

I'd heard so much hype about this place, so I finally decided to check it out.  My take: fairly average Mexican food.  They do give generous portions for pretty cheap prices.  They love to put tons of cheese on everything, but IMO there's just not a lot of flavor.  Plus everything is especially greasy.     They only take cash, so bring some. And be prepared to wait 5-10 minutes.  There's always tons of people lined up both inside and outside.  So the big question is why there are constantly so many people here. And I really don't have a good answer for it.  It's only meh.

I used to stop by here back in the day when I lived in LA because every time we passed by Tito's on our way to Costco, we always saw a line. 10am in the morning, 3pm in the afternoon, any time of day really, there was always a hoard of people outside (which got even crazier during meal times). Carrying huge expectations, I finally stopped in with my parents and was extremely disappointed. I think the only reason so many people like these is because they're cheap, since there's absolutely nothing special about these tacos. I've ventured back several times with friends since, but I would never voluntarily come here on my own.

One of the best tacos around, especially for the price.  The shell is nice and crispy, and the shredded meat is flavored just right.  The chips are fresh and the salsa is absolutely delicious.  This place has been around for a long time and there is always a long line.  The only complaint I have is that they charge way too much to add cheese to any order.

I don't know why people rave about this place. Being a native San Diegan, I've had my share of delicious Mexican food and Tito's is just o-k. The classic shredded beef tacos are what they're known for. They're good but not travel-worthy. Eat it once, say you've had it, and go explore elsewhere. Their guacamole is runny and flavorless... not chunky and fresh, the way I like it. But if you get the side of chopped jalapenos and throw them in the guac, it'll give any hot sauce in the world a run for its money.

The tacos are pretty bomb, they are hard shell, shredded beef tacos with lots of cheese and lettuce. They give free chips and salsa... super fresh and yummy! My ultimate favorite hard shell shredded beef tacos are from the Carnitas Michoacan in Sun Valley (it's not on the menu, just ask), but Tito's comes pretty close! I tried the Meat and Bean burrito, I think it has too much beans in it. There is always a line, but it goes fast.

Diarrhea paste... I thought Tito's was disgusting.  I know there are some crazy reviews that are polar opposites on here and I think it all comes down to what type of Mexican food you grew up with and more importantly, if you grew up with Titio's.  I did not, which makes me the L.A. outcast with my some of my L.A. friends.  I just wasn't impressed- the meat was this weird brown goop, which I have called diarrhea paste - mostly because it looks and tastes like diarrhea paste. However, two generous stars for the friendly(ish) staff while handling such a crazy rush of people AND getting our large order right.  I know I'm the odd man out here, but I just couldn't eat there again - I prefer real meat, like McDonalds.

Even though they have big lines most of the time, they go by pretty fast. Expect to wait 10-20 mins to finally get through the line and get your food. I usually get their tacos, or just a bean and cheese burrito. Their tacos come with shredded beef. They do tend to put a lot of beef in there, it kinda gets overwhelming. The beans are very very delicious. I think its their best item.  For some reason, I think their pepsi and all their other fountain drinks taste better than normal. I love how they use crushed ice in their drinks. This place is nice to come if you're really starving and just want something greasy and yummy. Half of the employees hardly speak english but they get what you're saying haa

It's simply the best traditional, hard-shell taco you'll find in these parts, which is saying something. With a usually filling two tacos running under $5, unless you get something to wash it down with, it's one of the better deals too. I've been having these since high school, and sure, some nostalgia may be built into the flavor, but it's good quality comfort food that never fails to disappoint. Biting into one of these babies and hearing the cool rush (or bumper-to-bumper) of the 405 must be what salvation is like after a while. Docking one star only because what was once among L.A.'s worst kept secrets appears to have become only worse of late; as I've cruised down Washington the last few times looking to stop in for a taco, the line seems endlessly, excruciatingly long to even deal with. Might it finally be time to actually franchise out this legend?

Oh boy... this place is deadly... because you want to eat more but it's so bad for you! It's also very confusing... because you don't know to order 3 or 4 or even 5! Dang it Tito... make the best taco's in town! Whenever there's a line, it's a pretty good percentage that it's gonna be pretty darn good! Only complaint is they could be a little more efficient when ordering. The person who takes your order is the person who serves your order. They don't do what most restaurants do... send the order to the back and have the people in the back put together the order. One person takes your order, then they go back to get your order, bring it back... then you pay for it. If they're more efficient, they'd eliminate the line!... but Tito probably wants the line.

Coming from south AZ, I was hesitant to try any kind of "authentic" mexican food west of hollywood, but I was swayed to go here by the reviews. Turns out, this place is a good little spot for some greasy, homemade tacos, beans and rice. Please note- this place was SLAMMED! Packed to the gills with people! No parking, just a lot of waiting in line. Well worth the trip though. Good for a lazy Sunday dinner.

Tito's tacos can't be beat.  I don't know if they're particularly authentic to Mexico, and they're very straightforward:  ground beef, lettuce, tomatoes....cheese is extra (like 20 cents or something funny like that)...so if you're looking for fancy over-priced "street food" you've come to the wrong place.   The chips are solid and taste home-made.  Their salsa is thin and runny but has the best flavor of any salsa ever, IMHO.  I sometimes get a burrito or enchalada, but the tacos really have the crave-factor. I've been going to Tito's as long as I can remember. I have family members who come into town who stop at Tito's on their way out of the airport before they even come over or check into a hotel.  We order Tito's and bring it home for most of our family events--because we LOVE Tito's, not because nobody wants to cook.

Tito's Tacos always hits the spot for me when I'm in the mood for a greasy hard taco!! I always get the tacos with shredded cheese. There's something about the tacos here that are incredibly addicting...whether it's the complimentary chips & salsa that come with your order, or the relatively large size of the hard tacos. PROS: Get the tacos with shredded cheese!! The taco meat here is different than Taco Bell and other authentic places...but it's great! I love it! CONS: Parking, in a word, SUCKS. The parking lot is virtually non-existent (it's basically 2 rows which you have to enter and exit separately (aren't linked up), otherwise you have to find street parking. Plan to budget at least 10-15 minutes to find somewhere to park your car. Also, the wait to actually place your order usually runs at least 15 minutes, and you either have to wait outside or inside (where there isn't A/C; only fans). Grabbing a spot to sit and enjoy your meal can also be difficult during peak hours. Regardless, I can't think of a better place to grab a cheap hard taco on the run!

Not really amazing Mexican food, but this place is cheap and it's good enough you don't mind waiting...and waiting...and waiting sometimes, as there has always been a line whenever I've gone.  It's like a Mexican Pinks, except better food IMHO.  The beef tacos are a must, as is the various burritos.  And when you order a side of chips, you get  plenty.   There are a bunch of tables to sit on outside but they do get filled, but if there is any space just sit with some strangers and talk about the weather.  I've even see people hang out in the parking lot and eat, like a big tailgate. If you're on the West side and got some time, I recommend it.

Such a long line for some hard shell tacos with shredded meat, shredded iceberg, and grated cheddar cheese? Why not just go to Del Taco for a Taco Del Carbon with Shredded Beef in a hard shell? It's almost the same thing...no?...well, without the ridiculous line! Tito's, ahem, Gabacho's Salsa is a joke! Nice puree tomato sauce, Tito! Gabacho's Guacamole...HAHAHA! Good one!

The parking is terrible. The line is ridiculously long. If they could just fix these problems. Maybe a less chaotic service process would work better. A factory line would be much more efficient rather than this dumb system of having combo cashier/waiter/cook/whatever. The food was incredibly lackluster. The taco shells aren't crunchy or crispy but just hard and stale and thick. The burrito has shredded beef that is really stringy and more of a stew in a tortilla. It was seriously salty as well. The flavor is basically salt. The salsa is seriously delicious but they were really stingy with me. I really enjoy a lot of salsa but they were super reluctant to give me a refill. And it took forever to even get someone's attention since cashiers are busy cooking an order forever. I can't really recommend the restaurant. It's unique in a lot of ways but that's not reason enough to visit the place. No thanks on tito's.

If you want to pick your diarrhea hub, try something tastier.  This famed pit brings attracts crowds in droves.  Don't know why.  It doesn't taste good, or feel good.  Maybe if you're a stoner?  Jack in the Box must have ripped these guys off, because their fried tacos are very similar.   By rep, this is the "Pinks Hot Dogs" of Tacos.  Not a compliment.  I'll have a Pinks again if there is no line (that might be never).  Don't feel that you have to go here because everyone else did, there is better nearly anywhere and everywhere.

This is probably one of those places where, if you haven't been eating it all your life, there's a good chance you won't get it. There's also a good chance you your likelihood of having heart disease will diminish, but the less said about that, the better. Yeah, the food is whatever when viewed through an objective lens, but that's not what Tito's is about. Tito's is about grease, waiting in that long line, the $.50 pieces, that weird painting of the kid eating all the food, the ice that is so much fun to chew, the guacamole that is bad and awesome at the same time, the salsa that you can't stop eating, the tacos that are inexplicably delicious, even though your really don't want to know how they got the beef to taste like that. No trip to LAX is complete without a stop here. In fact, Tito's almost makes a trip to the Westside worth it.

This place is an L.A. institution, period.   For those of you expecting some scintillating style "authentic" carne asada taco, this ain't your place. The notion that this is some how a gringo joint, however,or their tacos don't deliver in the flavor department is  ridiculous. Two tacos with cheese are the ticket as they come very simply with a finely shredded beef almost minced, lots of fresh lettuce and freshly grated cheddar cheese in a hard shell made on site. The key is there equally unique salsa, think finely blended pico de gallo, this adds the needed zip to the tacos and fresh chips. They bundle all of this in a nice little to go box with a drink it's about 6 bucks.         They have many other items, like tamales and a beef burrito that has a chunky, almost chili style, flavor. Rice and beans and guacamole too.     There is always a line, from open to close, so that should tell you something. I would say that may be one of the few drawbacks, that and parking can be a pain, especially if the lot is full. An insider tip is to step aside once you have ordered as you don't pay until they bring you your food.   This place is cash only too, so be prepared. This IS the spot for a unique and killer taco that will never be lost  in a sea of "authentic" taco stands. Tito's is one of a kind and for those that just don't get it but too bad for you.

There is a strange culinary hybrid that is native to Southern California generally and Los Angeles in particular but can also be found, in vastly inferior degree at Jack in the Boxes everywhere.  I'm talking about the crap taco. What is the crap taco?  Well, a vaguely mexican dish of horrific nutrition, filling that is recognizable as meat in only the most generous definition and often served in a manner that makes one suspect that all the ingredients were tossed in a tortilla and then the whole shebang deep fried.  Somehow the crap taco manages to be delicious. Tito's is the king of the crap taco.  No question.  There's is an echo in your head crunchy tortilla, filled with the requisite "meat" and topped with fresh lettuce and large gauge grated cheddar.  They're accompanied by some tasty salsa that seems to be onion and tomato and a little jalapeno run through a blender.  It is a mystery of Universal physics why this combination of flavors works. Other menu items include enchiladas with a brownish sauce that also seems unique to this little taco stand.  Good?  Not really, but tasty and filling?  Oh hell yeah! Tell even the most devoted crap taco aficionado that Tito's is your favorite Mexican restaurant and they will know you've taken leave of your senses.  But if you want to try this bizarre culinary bastardization, Tito's is the place.  And I love it.  Occasionally.  And a fat guy could get gut-busting full on under $10.

I am not sure what the big deal is. My wife and I have friends that say this is the best taco shop in LA. We tried it yesterday and the place was packed. Limited choices. If you want a soft shell chicken this is not the place. We had beef tacos in a hard shell because that is what they serve. The food was fresh and the quality was good. I know of many other places that would be a better choice for my taste. The food won't hurt you but perhaps it is a cult thing. I don't get it??

Nostalgic memories of eating Tito's every weekend makes me want to give it five stars, but my most recent visit reminds me that while it's consistent, satiating, and moderately flavorful, it's pretty far from being the best Mexican food I've had. I like their simple approach to food: there isn't anything fancy or complex about the ingredients in their offerings. Most dishes have no more than four or five ingredients. But when a restaurant bets all their money on simplicity, the quality of the ingredients has to shine. This is where Tito's lags; the quality of the ingredients is just mediocre. Also, after experiencing many different Mexican restaurants' signature salsas, I have to say Tito's Tacos' salsa seems watery, bland, and strange in texture. I'm sure I'll come to Tito's many more times in my life, not because I think they'll change (they won't), but because I have a special place in my heart for their warming, reliable food.

WHAT THE SHIT KIND OF MESSED UP PLACE IS THIS? The long ass lines at Titos are NOT indicative of good food. In fact they are merely the result of a disorganized and archaic ordering system that creates unnecessary chaos! With dozens of employees  each helping one customer and only one cashier  no wonder Tito's is always hiring and has long lines! Tito's could really benefit from an "order" window and a "pick up" window. What a novel idea huh? Why not institute a system where you call out a number or name when someone's order is ready? This way when someone is done placing their order they can MOVE OUT OF THE WAY instead of just stand around while the next person behind them has to shout out their order. Seriously, it's not rocket science! All the employees look like stoic depressed robots on the verge of commiting suicide in matching sneakers! What about some smiles people? How about some festive Mariachi music to lighten the mood? Who died at Tito's??? Even the customers in line were all shitty and depressed looking.... I wanted to throw up my hands and shout "CHEER UP YOU MOTHER EFFERS WE'RE IN LINE FOR TACOOOOOOS FOR PETE'S SAKE!" On to the food... people who gave this place five stars... are you for real? Referring to the crapstastic sorry excuse for tacos as "amazing" or any other adjective indicating positive things is utterly misleading. No fish tacos, no al pastor, no soft tacos. STOOOPID! I ordered a taco with cheese (they charge extra for cheese) Can you just tell me WTF kind of effed up shit that's all about? What kind of taco is a hard shell taco if it doesn't have cheese you  bastards? The taco was lame.  The shell came all cracked and cracked even more when I attempted to pick it up. WONDERFUL! The meat wasn't even seasoned GROSS! and all I tasted was watery lettuce FANTASTIC!  (No tapatio? No Cholula?) The beef tamale was offensively bland, no flavor, no salt, I had to DROWN that mo fo in the gross watery salsa. The salsa is only one notch better than the stuff you get at El Pollo Locco and the sauce that they serve with the tamale almost made me gag. I regret wasting my time with this place and to top things off  they gave me my change in the form of a half dollar!!! A HALF DOLLAR!!! bastards!!!!

But one night, the beau and I stopped by for a quick bite before heading home. I ordered the potato tacos. Deep fried potato tacos. I know potatoes aren't supposed to be exciting -- but I kinda waited a long time for something with...pizazz. The taco shell was super hard and crunchy. I even sliced my gum with the first bite. "Ouch!" I didn't eat my food. I know!! SHOCKER!!! But my stomach could not be put through such an ordeal over the revered taco de papa. The only rad thing about Titos was seeing GLEN DANZIG in line.

That is SO not what tacos should be, unless your in college making tacos that have ground beef with powdered seasoning!   As for you Westsiders....come on over to East LA, its not as bad as the stories you've heard.  And its worth it!  Then again, I just had Taco Hell today so who am I to judge?

Mexican food in LA is so delicioso since I can't get the good stuff at home. Recently, I took a Tito's Taco virgin here and we both agreed the food hit a home run. I've been coming here for over 20 years and had such awesome memories eating here and taking it out. This place keeps it real by serving their specialties with the same taste and consistency. Walk up to the counter, tell the ladies your order and she'll return with a brown box filled with your goodies including fresh, thick chips and you pay her cash and walk away with a meal that will satisfy you 100%. It's funny because I always order the all meat burrito (under $5) here because I like the sauce they use. One problem I experienced on this last trip was the lack of salsa. I ended up hogging the whole thing up! Lo siento! So make sure to order extra because it's so good with the chips and entrees. I'm confident I converted my friend to a huge fan of this place.

Twenty two years ago I visited L.A. Upon leaving, on the way to the airport, my local friends stopped and took me to Tito's Tacos for lunch. It was great! I'll admit, I didn't eat the tacos. To this day I still haven't. I don't like hard shell tacos. Sorry. But if you load up a stack of TT's burritos I will keep eating them until I explode! I love the sauce and I love the different flavor of the steer versus cow meat. Now I make it my routine to take everyone to Tito's Tacos on the way from, on the way to, or both ways, when going to LAX.

Just look at the line, there is a good reason people are standing in droves at all hours to get some of this grub, it is delicious.  I could eat this food everyday of my life.  It is classic, and an original that can never be duplicated.  My favorite are the tacos, my best friend adores the burritos.   Amazing Mexican food - love the tostadas too!  Gimmie some of those fantastic fresh chips while your at it,  It is like the commercial with the flying tacos says "The only thing better than a Tito's taco is two." Not advised if you're on a diet as you may order seconds or thirds because you have found food utopia. I love you, Tito's! Stay fabulous * * * * *

there are 2 schools of thought here at Titos, the first one is "the best since forever and like greatest man!" I am not from this school I was intrigued by the long lines, all these people spending so much time waiting for Tito's tacos, you could build a pyramid with all that time. So on a whim I pull over and give them a shot, 30 minutes later, Dude! this is like jack in box with a following! I guess people love Celine Dion too. Not me.

I've been here twice and never again. i don't get it, it's cheap ok, but Del Taco is cheap and has something Tito's lacks, flavor. I've now tried all of the menu and all of it made me sad. i mean, i love food so much and rarely is food so bad for me that i get sad after eating it. but Tito's is that place, i felt like a piece of me died with each bite. all of it each time was bland and offered nothing. I'm not Mexican but i know food should have taste. i wish i could give zero stars.

If you're fan of The Exorcist, you'll love this place. Let me explain. The guacamole is the consistency of young Reagan's spew. The salsa, you can pretty much drink it up with a straw. Salsa, as far as I know, is meant to be eaten, not drank. That is some repugnant shit! Shredded yellow cheese on a taco? Yeah, maybe if I were ordering at Del Taco/Taco Bell. I love the "herd mentality" of this place. People assume that since it's packed it must be good. It reminded me of the stupid people that stand in front of El Cholo when they have their sweet tamales up for grabs. They don't get, that ass still tastes like ass. Oh, and the tacos are cheap too! Uh, yeah, and they're also cheap at any taco truck in L.A. That's not a valid argument. There's nothing redeeming about Tito's.

Twenty bucks buys just about one of every item on the menu with change to spare. Besides bargain-basement prices, the secret to Tito's success is loyal customers with no taste buds (no offense to anyone who loves titos). Seriously I don't know what the hypes all about? Their hard tacos tasted EXACTLY like jack in the cracks tacos: fried, soggy and bleh. Enchiladas are a major disappointment, there was nothing but cheese rolled up inside with some salsa slathered on top. I think I would have had a better meal eating at Taco Del Mar. enuff said. ,

Apparently there is a big difference between Washington PLACE and Washington BLVD: ONE damn street. Parking seemed like a bitch but after I went around one time, my Chinese luck kicked in as I swooped on the # 2 spot. From the looks of it, business is booming. There were massive lines in the front but I decided to order inside instead as the wait line was half the size. Three lines and you walk up to order. I won't lie, it can get pretty cramped as people kept coming from behind or the side for their forgotten salsa or change. The only other time I've eaten Tito's was when a co-worker was nice enough to bring extra to work and that was a while ago. With that in mind, I had no clue what and how much to order so I just went for it... - 8 tacos with cheese (WAY TOO DAMN MUCH) - 2 cheese enchiladas - salsa - chips - 2 drinks The tacos were GOOD. For those of you who speak of this inauthenticity, I have one word for you: DUH! Number one give away is the thick, yellow shredded cheese. The hard shell was the best I've had as it withstood a thirty minute drive from LA to LB without getting soggy. Topped it with salsa and I was enjoying every bite. Portion size is huge so watch out - it was quite the struggle for us. For those of you who live in Long Beach, I would compare these to Baja Sonora's shredded beef tacos (which might be even better). Tsk, tsk, tsk! The enchiladas were DISGUSTING. DO NOT ORDER, I repeat, DO NOT ORDER THE ENCHILADAS if you know what is good for you. The sauce was thick, bland and plain gross. The corn tortilla was stiff and the flavor was overpowering. Just don't order it unless you want to hear me say, 'I told you so.' The salsa wasn't thick but it wasn't too watery either. It was just right. It had more of a tomato taste as opposed to pepper/spice but I still thought it was bomb, especially with the tacos. My honey claimed he didn't like it too much but the fact that he busted it out on that munchie tip proved me otherwise. This time I went all the way to Culver City for Tito's to kill freeway traffic, which worked out perfectly, but I dunno if I would do this on the reg. Maybe if my boy makes a *special request*.

Not impressed at all. The "mush" that they stuff their taco shells with resembles a Jack In The Box taco, which are . They're really greasy, which if the actual taco was good wouldn't matter, but they're not good at all. At $1.70 a taco ($2.20 if you want them to "sprinkle" cheese on the fucking thing) I expect something tasty and worthy of a drive to Culver City. Sadly it doesn't live up to the hipster hype.

I really was disappointed with their tacos. We tried this place based on a referral, so we thought it would be good. The food looked good and the menu was simple. We all got the Tito's Taco and this is what I thought: 1) only one choice hard/crunchy taco, no soft taco - already not liking the limited choices 2) you can get with cheese or without cheese - I opted without and it really didn't matter because I got to try the taco with cheese. they were both not good 3) taco meat was very bland and stringy - no flavor at all and the taco comes with meat, lettuce and cheese (optional) 4) the salsa didn't add any flavor and it wasn't spicy. It could use more limes and cilantro. 5) rice - I think it was under cooked and it was warm when we got it (and we were one of the first customers that day) we all left very disappointed and we are definitely never going back.

i really like taco bell. I really love del taco. In fact, del taco is way superior to taco bell because they use thinner shredded cheese. (but taco bell has the better chicken quesadilla) Tito's is like half way between a fake taco and an 'real' taco. It's like they tried to make the taco bell taco authentic by subbing in a real fried tortilla and 'real' shredded beef. It's like replicating a Guess bag. Ew and why. Frying a tortilla makes it unnaturally hard and I personally enjoy Taco Bell's flavorfull ground beef and the nice thin taco hardshell.   Not to mention Tito's hard shells makes your jaws work. No bueno.

Really??? When my accountant asked if I wanted Mexican today I thought, "cool." When his assistant came back with a Tito's bag I shuttered! From previous experience I knew this was doctored canned dog food. Not one to be rude I bit into my greasy, shredded, shoe leather taco...yuck. It's not so much a taste as a betrayal to Mexicans, Culver City and my palate. I just don't get it! Yes, it's an institution but that doesn't make it good. This watered down Mexican food gives the false impression that Mexican food is equivalent to junior high cafeteria food. Mexican food at it's best is comforting, fresh, and saturated with rich flavors, slow cooked beans and meats. I'm not on yelp to bash any business, matter of fact, I rarely give out 1 and 2 stars. However, it's my duty as a yelp elite to use diplomacy and intelligent wit over crassness and meanness.  That said, this place sucks!

We got: 2 burritos (one with beans & meat w/cheese; one with meat w/cheese) 2 tamales (one chicken & one beef) 2 tacos w/cheese 1 spanish rice total: 31. sigh..what the eff is the hype about this place?!?! shredded beef. same beef used in tamales and tacos and burritos. are you serious? with the tamales the oil from the beef was given for dipping sauce.. (PASS!!!) in the end I was full. but left unsatisfied. the food truck burrito tasted better. and to be honest for almost 5 dollars i would rather go to a food truck where its rice, avocado, juicy beef (NOT SHREDDED), sour cream and other stuff takes place. I understand why this place is in business. they use only 1 type of meat for EVERYTHING. even in the tamales (minus the chicken). The seasoning used for the burrito left me nauseous and wanting for rice. (stood in line for about 10 minutes to order one rice). No, not because they were busy. but because it wasnt my line that the ladies were serving. I understand everyone is stationed at a certain window but when I see 4 different servers serving the window next to me which barely people instead of the line I was in whose line was up to the door does piss me off. for heavens sake! all I want is rice!! I asked and they said no the other line not your line. ok fine. ill wait here till the server of my window pops up. what pissed me off is that some girl pops in hails a server down and asks her if she can get the same thing she ordered and wait and behold that girl didnt have to wait even though the manager said that she had to. how this place stays in business is still a puzzle to me. Chips everywhere beans on the floor. I see some guy there dripping beans on the floor everyone stares and avoids. CLEAN AND SWEEP IT UP!!! god dammit. looks like this place can be the new roach motel. if this is mexican tacos I would stay away. shredded beef for everything *shakes head in disgust*

Remember in high school, when one of the people in your group started hating someone? You all pretty much turned on that person and their life became an endless procession of swirlies, scrawled locker insults and shitty comments whispered in the hallway. I think the same thing has happened with Tito's. It got so much hype that it became uncool, and therefore it's now cool to hate it. All the "in" folks (we'll refer to them as the "Tito's Bullies" from now on) are turning on it, and comparing it to laughable items like Jack-in-the-Box tacos. Riiiight. If a restaurant could be picked up, stuffed in a toilet and flushed, my guess is they'd do it. If you haven't gleaned it by now, I'm somewhat in disagreement. There are days--let's call them "Tito's Days"--when nothing less but their tacos will do. I don't wait in line for anything--not even to get into Hyde. But I dutifully queue up for Tito's with no hesitation. When my brother is in town, he insists on going there no matter how much it screws with his schedule. There's something immensely satisfying about their tacos, so much so that I get three of them with meat and cheese only and flat out go to town. We're talking head down, no talking, food intercourse time. The salsa that comes with it is so-so and the chips are okay, but the tacos are the main attraction here. If you want to hammer Tito's, then go after their watery guacamole. Even I, The Staunch Defender of Beseiged Taco Joints Everywhere, won't touch that runny green stuff. So take the silly taunts of the Tito's Bullies with a shaker full of salt. Maybe it's not cool to eat there, but it sure is good.

I saw a sign-up sheet last night at work saying that a co-worker was going to pick up some food from here. The majority of people ordered the beef taco so I jumped on the bandwagon and got that too. I also ordered a chicken tamale and a side of guacamole. Today I got the food and was utterly disappointed. The taco was just a slight upgrade from the tacos you can get at Jack in the Box. The salsa was like the one you can get from El Pollo Loco, without the slight spice. The guacamole was sooo watered down, what a disaster! The tamale was just OK, decent chunks of chicken but the masa was pretty dry. It came with a sauce but that didn't really add anything to it. Glad I didn't have to wait in a long line for this. I'm never going to waste my time going here.

The food at Tito's Tacos isn't particularly special but it's certainly not terrible. More than anything it's an experience; a swirling mass of chaos, disorder, and tortillas in a dive that's practically sitting under the highway. For the $7 spent, the two tacos and burrito were decent enough but nothing would entice me to go back again.

Why do people love Tito's Tacos so much?? "I love Tito's Tacos, you love Tito's too" Isn't that how it goes? Well I don't really love Tito's Tacos. I like it okay, but I'd much rather get some food from Cinco de Mayo next door. The lines here are always retarded long no matter what time of day or night. It's kind of difficult to figure out who is in line and who has already ordered and is just milling around mucking up the line process. At least there are plenty of places to park - either in the Tito's lot, the Cinco de Mayo lot, the Johnnie's lot, or on the street. I've never had to resort to parking on the street before though. The tacos are hard shell and beef so if you're jonesing for something different, sorry sista. Each taco is only a little more than a dollar and at that price I'll usually get 3 or 4 or 5 or 10 for myself even though I don't particularly love them that much. They give you salsa and chips too (the chips come out of huge trash cans and are sometimes stale). Use the chips as spoons and put that salsa all over your tacos. Mmmmhmmm. It's not very spicy but it adds some flavor and moisture. I keep ordering the side of refried beans and they're good but I still prefer the beans at CdM. The enchiladas and burritos aren't too shabby either but if you go here, I'd seriously consider just sticking to the tacos, it's what they're known for after all. Tito's accepts cash only but they do have an ATM outside (you can wait in line either inside or outside at the windows). Most of the time when you get change you'll receive at least 1 or more Silver Dollars, Andrew Jackson dollar coins, or some other random not often used coinage. I'm not a huge fan of Tito's but sometimes I do get an inexplicable craving for the tacos so I will not rate it as badly as it might deserve.

Well, I knew I was going out to a pigout lunch, but I drove by Tito's at 10.30 a.m. and they were open and so... well, I got me an enchilada! Hadn't been to Tito's since forever, and had never been inside, usually order at the window in the front.  There were two or three lines, I couldn't really tell.  It is not very organized but somehow everyone gets their food. You stand in line and then the server who helps you leaves the counter and goes to pack your order, whatever it is (if it's a long order, everyone else in line in back of you just waits).  So you stand there, or have to move aside if another server comes to the counter and calls the next person.  Very haphazard. But anyway, it didn't take long and I got my unbelievable cheese enchilada.  Wow.  It's not quite the same as the usual restaurant enchilada.  It's an enchilada on steroids. The tortilla it's wrapped in is handmade and tastes thick and chewy and yummy.  But the texture is more like a tamale than a tortilla.  The enchilada is huge and enough for 2 meals, really.  The cheese inside wasn't really melted, but it was plentiful and delicious.  The whole thing is absolutely drowned in a fabulous brown sauce with a nice layer of additional cheese and onions melted on top.  Wow. The smell in this place is incredible and they have the best refried beans.

Ok everyone, we get it. Tito's does not make authentic tacos, they make Tito's tacos. It's not a taco truck... they deep fry the tacos and they're in a hard shell. We get it. Information conveyed. Message sent. It's still damn good though and super cheap. If it's too bland for you then ask for some of their homemade hot sauce. Problem solved. Stop whining that Tito's isn't authentic Mexican food, everyone knows this already.

So weeks before trying this place I had the damn jingle stuck in my head... I love titos tacos... You'll love Tito's taco too... I love Tito's tacos what else can you do?... Are you serious... OMG so annoying right... RIGHT! Yet so damn catchy! haha! It was inevitable... I just had to try it. I do not eat meat other than fish so don't know if I can really comment on the taco's pre se. I got the bean and cheese burrito... Not bad but damn far from GOOD and the cheese enchilada... Eww skip! Tasted like a soggy tortilla with a thick piece of un-melted string cheese inside with hot pasta sauce poured on top.... Can you taste it? Isn't your mouth just watering! The real killer, my friend got 4 tacos and as we leaving I looked into the box and realized that Tito's helpers did not put in my burrito and two of his tacos in the box, yet I was staring at a receipt dumbfounded that showed we paid for food we did not get... Great!  Did we really just get bamboozled... I think we did! Good thing I looked! They fixed it but with a wait time similar as to if we just ordered, which was BS and there was no apology... I had to wait in line just to tell them they messed up my order... Where is the sense of urgency! Would Tito be proud? I think NOT! I dislike Tito's tacos, you'll dislike Tito's too!!! lol I wont be back... What else can I do... (Let me stop)

Is it Overrated yes it is...But is it down right Delicious hell yes! First off this is not your typical taco shop, they do hard shell tacos like taco bell but with shredded beef :) I usually get 5 tacos and 2 burritos... Am I at Fat Ass status hell yea I am but it's totally worth it. The just keep it simple and don't try to hide the flavor of the meat which I like but I wish there salsa was better it's just down right horrible. Would it kill someone to just add a freaking jalapeno or maybe some tomatillos to spice it up. If you hate waiting in line then do what I always do and say I'm gonna puke lol it always clears the line away. It's cash only so bring some green backs and I wish they take debit cause I hate carrying cash. Now go get some Titos!!!

After hearing all the hype, I was definitely underwhelmed by my experience here.  I seriously can't believe everyone stands in line for these tacos!  The tacos are total crap.  An over glorified, overpriced taco bell taco.  The shell was stale and it was filled with unimpressive ground beef and lettuce.  Cheese was 50 cents extra and the salsa was bland.  The chips, like the taco shells, were stale.   I don't know about the rest of the menu as I only tried the taco, but with their signature item being a major fail, I doubt it bodes well for the rest of the menu.  With the abundance of great Mexican food in the area, I definitely won't be back for more disappointment.

Like visiting an old friend I haven't seen in a few years, I was hoping my trip to Tito's  would be like old times.  I've had around 200+ tacos (serious) here over the years and we have a long history.  So, it was time to go again after our 3 year separation. Everything always looks the same and that wonderful scent of the tacos frying in lard welcomed me with open arms.  Man, I was home again and really excited! Ordered a couple of tacos with green salsa plus a bean and cheese burrito.  Got my little box and grabbed a seat.  Took my first bite of the taco and thought it hmmm... not bad, but definitely not as great as I had remembered.  The taco was a bit tough, not that crunchy, the meat tasted ordinary, and even the cheese was rather flat.  The taco wasn't great anymore and it bummed me out all the way home.  Regardless, I'm still going to have tacos here every so often for memories sake. You ever try something you loved as a kid that doesn't taste as good when you're older? Maybe that's it.  Objectively, it's just a plain lard fried taco and there is nothing outstanding or unusual about it.  The shell is cooked in too low of a temp so that makes it's tough and hard.  There's not a lot of greens, and the cheese and salsas are weak.  I am not a taco snob and love all kinds of tacos, but even comparing the pics between my taco here and Mexicatessen (check it out on my pics) you can visually see the difference.  It's a sad day as I have to honestly put my old friend Tito on the lower end of my Taco List.  I hate myself for that as I still love that place like an old girlfriend.  What happened to my Tito's Tacos?  Must be that Global Warming thing....

Was always dying to try this place but usually when I'm grubbing for mexican I don't have the patience to wait. Usually I go to Cinco de Mayo's next door which takes plastic and has no line. One night the line at Tito's wasn't so bad and I had a twenty on me. Finally! A night to try the "best tacos on the west side". Um, am I missing something? I thought the whole point of eating authentic mexican style tacos in LA was to avoid the ortega-like deep fried corn shell with mystery meat and shredded processed cheese. That's the way tacos were on east coast and that's why when I lived on the east coast I never craved me no tacos. When I discovered the GLORY of the well made carne asada taco with its succulently seasoned meat paired so perfectly with two thin white soft corn tortillas and the optional smattering of guacamole, I never again looked back on the Taco Hell-esque american version of the taco. So why are people waiting in a long to get them? They don't even HAVE carne asada tacos here. They only have one kind of taco and there's nothing scrumptious about. I'm not saying it tastes bad or gross but it's quite boring and my toes won't ever curl for that kind of taco. We each had two tacos, an enchilada, and a side of guac with chips. I've had better frozen enchiladas made by Weight Watchers. The overly thick, dry tortilla chew and an unfriendly bitter sauce put me off this enchilada and I didn't eat it. The guac was the cheap bland kind that tastes more like Nickelodeon's mystery slime than avocados..... So, that's my take, people. No harm wished to the proprietors and they surely don't need my business with those lines, but I'm baffled by the popularity and recommendedness (hehe) of this place. If you haven't yet and you live around here, I'd seriously try next door at Cinco de Mayo's if I were you. And it bears repeating that the best carne asada tacos I've come across thus far are at Burrito King up in hipsterland.

Not only is Tito's part of my heritage, being third generation Culver Citizen, but it is one of my favorite addictions. They've changed the recipe for my staple guacamole a couple times I've the years; I like this version, but my favorite was how they made it in the early 1990's. :/ Luckily, they still make the tacos & burritos the same way, which is to say: perfect. Don't come here looking for authentic Mexican food. Come here for Tito's. It's a thing unto itself, & it is delish.

I'm not a crunchy taco girl.  But I believe there's a time and place for everything.  Especially on a date.  The boy was so cute to take me to his "favorite tacos place in the whole world."  It was his parents' favorite place and it got passed on to the kids.  Who am I to argue about fond memories? So, I get two tacos and a drink.  I dab my chips politely in the salsa.  Bleh!  No thank you. The tacos with the mound of thickly shredded cheese were...um, good? I mean, there's lots of meat.  Lots of cheese.  Some things I think are lettuce.  Okay, so they were.  And uh, grease.  Yeah, things that would make a good taco.  Okay, where's the real salsa? I really shouldn't have eaten the second taco.  But the boy paid for two and damn, I didn't want to waste his couple of bucks. Five stars for the date.  But let's get real, the tacos kind of sucked.

"No bueno" - Camellia C. (after eating at Tito's) I'll never understand the allure of Tito's Tacos. I just went last night and I'm still feeling the after effects. Honestly, I'd rather go to Taco Bell and the only time I'll come here is when I have a friend who has never tried Tito's and wants to see what all the fuss is about. I know I'll sound old for this but back in the day Tito's was never this insane.  Waiting in long lines for sub-par Mexican food is not my sort of thing and when I took a Tito's first-timer there she was severely disappointed. Yeah you get a lot of food and yeah it's cheap, but is it any good when you only eat half and then can't stand the sight of the leftovers? Maybe it's because I've been here too many times or maybe it was because I was watching Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate and suddenly that burrito looked less and less appetizing. Maybe it was both. In any event, avoid the lines and the hype and use your pesos elsewhere.

I gotta say - I'm kind of surprised by the lack of love for Tito's! I've eaten there twice now, and I'm totally hooked. I love the Tacos w/cheese, the Beef & Bean Burritos and I love love love their salsas. I don't even care if it's not authentic Mexican food - it's authentically yummy and that, along with the ultra-low prices will keep me coming back for more.

Not sure what all the fuss is about. This place is simply average. The tacos are only available with beef. They are just ok. A notch above Taco Bell. Not stellar at all. And 60 cents extra per taco for some crappy cheese? really? The bean and cheese burrito was actually pretty darn good. I'd go back for it. The chips are good. The salsa is on the bland side. But tasted fresh. And they're free - so can't complain. Definitely not worth standing in a huge line for. I'd go somewhere else for good tacos. Had to try it once though.

This is as "lardy" as food gets. In my pre-veg days I was standing in line here and I saw a gigantic BRICK of lard on the counter behind the order-taking people. How do I know it was lard? Because printed on the side of it was one gigantic word: "LARD." Blah, that even disgusted me THEN, instinctually. Now that I know that lard is the fat of tortured pigs, pigs that are as smart as dogs, I stay away from lard palaces in general and this place specifically.

For those of you that aren't up late in the LA area this is what everyone is singing:  http://www.youtube.com/w… I can't say I love Tito its more like I like Tito.  I enjoy the food but I don't enjoy the difficulty finding a parking spot.  I don't mind the wait as the time goes by but I do like the watery salsa and chips.  I am torn between saying, "All you people are crazy to give this place less then 3 stars!" and "Yeah I can see where you may not like this place."  So what do I do?  Chicken out and go 3 stars... The price is very reasonable and there are the standard options for a Tex/Mex place in SoCal.  The tacos are thick shelled and you have to get cheese on them to fully enjoy the greasy flavor.  I definitely enjoty the tacos and chips and when in the area and have a hankering for something to eat I'll definitely stop by, but its not a place I would go out of my way.  There are so many reviews on Tito's that it should probably sway you to try it if you haven't already, but don't think its that bad from the other reviews, I mean if people are willing to bear the long lines and terrible parking they must be doing something right, right?

Sorry, guys....I had to yelp it. You either love Tito's, or you hate it.  I love to hate how bad it is for me to eat here. But true to form, the most unhealthiest of foods are the best. I was introduced to Tito's years ago, and have been an almost-steady customer ever since.  Over the years, I've noticed one main Tito's Survival Technique to avoid long lines and find parking: Go on an off hour (right when it opens, around 3pm...etc). I know, I know, why divert to a special time frame to eat when you're hungry *now*??  Also, I've seen the parking lot get absolutely crazy, even saw someone almost get a straight up Washington Place Beat Down.  I usually don't even park in the lot, but use the meters on Sepulveda. When I go to Tito's, I always get the same exact thing whether I'm 100% hungry or not: Three tacos with cheese, an order of beans and rice which comes out to $9.45. Because, you see...even if I'm not fully starving I just can't stop eating these tacos. There's crack in them things! As mentioned, the lines can get a bit hairy, I've never noticed a difference between standing outside at key hours vs. standing inside, but I do have an official Tito's pet peeve: When people just stand in front, have already ordered and everyone stands in back of them waiting like ...the hell is going on here??? The line's not advancing!!! -OR-  When there's a super line, and the person in front of you leaves about 5 feet between them and the ordering window, kinda like how you're trying to make a left turn from 4th onto Vermont in downtown LA and the car infront won't scoot UP and you miss the signal completely, yeah...it's like that. At any rate, will I still be coming back to Tito's?  Yes. Was there last night. I noticed Curb Side Assistance. Does that mean we can order online and just simply pull up and avoid the line mess?   I heart you, Tito's.

During my 4 years in high school, all I would hear from the faculty members was "OMG, YOU'RE GETTING TITO'S!? CAN YOU GET ME SOME TACOS!?", and from the students, "LUCKY! OMG TITO'S TACOS ARE SOOO GOOD!".  I never got to try them back in high school though because it was a little out of the way for me. Finally, I decided to go out of my way after hearing all the rave about it. Again, I didn't go on Yelp, and again, I was punished with this 2-star rated food. I expected some quality, authentic Mexican tacos with some juicy carne asada! Well, I parked the car in the already crowded parking lot, and went and waited in the long line for about 15 minutes. I saw other people with their tacos already and didn't see any carne asada--only shredded beef?! WTF?! ok whatever, I calmed down and decided to take the experience for what it was so I could enjoy it. My turn to order...2 Tacos and a soda please!  Got my order within 10 minutes since it was so crowded so this was reasonable enough and they included a large batch of chips and salsa--SCORE! Salsa sucked balls. No lies here. It was pretty bland and I like my stuff spicy. This wasn't gonna cut it. My tacos--well, let's just say I had to eat it because I would've felt terrible throwing away 2 whole tacos and all those chips even though it only costed me less than $5. The shell of the taco was a little too hard for me, the shredded beef just lacked flavor, and I didn't really like that they only topped it with only lettuce and cheddar cheese. I wanted my onions and cilantro but hey, this wasn't one of those types of places so I REALLY tried to just take it for what it was. But honestly, I sat there thinking, "TACO BELL IS 10x better than this!" and that is TRUE LIFE, my friend. If you're a hype-whore, go here. If you like Mexican food that's isn't cooked for Mexican people, then go here. If you're looking for a fairly cheap meal, go here. If you're looking for some authentic Mexican food, go elsewhere. I've think I've done a little too much damage to them already. It wouldn't really matter though, they still have lines going out the door and people all over them. Not me though--noooo thank you.

After hearing so much about this place I was expecting to eat some half decent food. Unfortunately for me I dragged a couple friends along on my food adventure and it's something I'll have to live with for the rest of my life. To be honest... I don't know how this place has so much business. The tacos are in all honesty comparable to Jack in the Box except 3 times the price with an added charge for cheese, the "tostadas" are nothing but beans and lettuce, the beef inside the burritos look like a form of sloppy joe made by Purina, and their "salsa" is merely smashed tomatoes. Of the 2 friends I went with that night, one ended up with a stomach ache and a bad case of the hershey squirts, while the other quit eating her taco halfway saying she couldn't eat anymore. We threw it all in the trash and decided that McDonalds down the street would be a whole lot better than the garbage we were eating here. For anyone here looking for GOOD tacos, save your money and go to Don Antonios in West LA on Wednesdays where they have $1 tacos after 5PM. My friends and I pass by the place all the time since it's off the 405, and I always jokingly state "hey bro wanna hit up Tito's again?" which is always met with an angy/annoyed/disappointed/disgusted face with disapproving head nod. I wouldn't bring my worst enemy to Tito's Tacos.. that would be too cruel.

I'm definitely *not* a fan.  I feel I should give it one star just to slant the vote because it seems too many people are voting on the hype, like a bad movie that no one wants to admit sucks. The tacos were.... eh. um,  I like the Salsa and chips.   But not enough to wait in a 15 person deep line...  that barely moves.  They have the WORST order taking and receiving system.  It's a complete cluster ***k.  People just milling around getting in the way of others trying to place orders.  I bet if they fixed that one problem the lines would vanish. Oh.  And don't plan on driving here.  There's no parking... well, ok.  There's probably about 15 spots.  enough for the people in one line.  But there's seven lines.  There's security patrolling all the neighboring parking lots so don't even think about it. Seriously, this place is not worth the wait. Edit (07/05/07) I just had their Tacos and got another order of Salsa.  I had originally given them 2 starts b/c the salsa was good, but I just downgraded them because it's not good enough to wait 45 minutes on a Monday night for good salsa, it's good, not great.   Almost an hour, and I finally had their tacos Wow, their tacos sucked.  Why do people like this place?

I didn't understand the hype about Tito's the first couple of times I came here.  I live up the street and in L.A., Tito's seemed an odd throwback to 60's Junior League "comida mexicana" (say it like Peggy Hill) parties where the women were well-medicated and the men were all having affairs with their secretaries. But you know what?  I came again.  I observed.  I partook.  And slowly, an epiphanic love for Tito's came to my closed, little dried fig of a heart. Yes, I love Tito's.  Because families and church groups come here, and the staff doesn't give a f*ck if you have to wait because if you didn't want to wait, then why did you come here?!  I love the tacos and the burritos under their meadows of yellow cheese, and I love the strawberry soda, and I love the super fake guacamole.  I like to sit at the tables outside and watch the girls with the booms come in and order food with their Axe-scented boyfriends.  I like to crunch on the chips, listening to traffic whiz by, Sepulveda on one side, the metallic drone of the 405 on the other.  And I think, adrift on a gentle glide of orange grease, life is good.  Tito's is good.

Overly hyped, and the lines, ohh the lines, I couldn't imagine people were lining up for this. I heard so much about it, so I thought, it won't hurt to try since I luv tacos and burritos so much. We lined up and then the order-taker suddenly just disappeared for more than 5 minutes and I realized, there's only 1 type of tacos and it's beef only. Other menus such as burritos, enchilada, tostadas are available, but it's either chicken or beef only. Their sauce, though it looked so fresh, it's so bland, no taste at all. I think they need to season all their stuff, I could barely taste anything. And cheese lovers, forget it, you won't get that for free here, it's 50cents extra. I ordered 3 tacos and I totally regretted it, it only had hard tacos and it's not those nice hard, easy to break taco shell, it's like hard to bite taco shell, and their chips, ayayayya, nasty for me! I'm so sorry, but my overall verdict for this place is really bad. I know they're trying to make like the Mexican In N Out style, with less menu to offer, but not just their menu sucks, their service sucks too. There were people walking around behind the counter saw us, but never took our order at all, just kept passing by. I'm completely disappointed and I really can't see what's so great about this. Parking is hell if you're not lucky, they only have so much space, yet the lines and the guests that kept coming were just non-stop, you could park on the street too if you're lucky. I won't come back unless someone dragged me into this.

Gringo-mex at its finest.  This is not the type of place that you come for authentic Messican fare.  What you will find is a limited menu that focuses heavily on using the same 3-4 fillings with different varieties of tortilla containers.  Sort of like a cash-only Chipotle-esque predecessor. The best thing about Tito's is that they use shredded beef in their tacos instead of ground beef.  Also, their gringo salsa - despite being completely mild and kind of watery - is plentiful and strangely good.  Finally, my wife loves the fact that all of the food here is served at burningly hot temperatures.   What's interesting to me is how many Latinos frequent Tito's Tacos.  Usually, la raza will scoff mightily at any establishment that offers hard shell tacos and neon yellow cheese.  But in fact, a few visits back, through the throngs of people standing in line, I saw Danny "The Mayor" Trejo here.   For those in the know of his impressive body of work (Con-Air, Blood in Blood Out, Desperado, Spy Kids, Anchorman) he's quite possibly the most "Latino" Latino in showbiz today.  And if that's not giving Tito's Taco's some street cred, I don't know what will.

This place sucks so much I don't even know where to begin... I know I'm biased already since I hate hardshell tacos (their only option), but I don't know what the appeal of rock hard fried taco shells are. With flavorless shredded beef and processed shredded cheese? At this point I'd rather go to Taco Bell or something. Service is slow for "fast food," and they aren't the brightest at taking orders. It's dirty inside, and sketchy clientele. Perhaps I'm spoiled by all the plethora of real tasty street tacos, or even something good like Tacos por Favor in Santa Monica. But seriously, to me this wouldn't bother me so much for what it is if it weren't so hyped up. Someone described this to me like the "in-n-out of tacos in la..." to which I nearly keeled over. And I'm glad I don't watch late night tv anymore... because do I love Tito's Tacos? NO! Gross.

I've been eating at Tito's since I was in the womb! :-D Seriously, we lived in Mar Vista until I was 4 and used to come down here often. After we moved, we'd always stop by here when in town. So despite not living here all my life, I've still been eating here all my life. The burritos are big and sloppy, but really yummy. They slow cook the beef for hours and hours until it's completely shredded and it soaks up the sauce. My personal favorite has always been the beef and cheese. The salsa is also pretty soupy (but I love it anyway!). Make sure you get plenty of napkins because you'll definitely need them! Also, Tito's only takes cash. They have an ATM to the side, but it might be easier to be prepared ahead of time. And since it is so popular, expect long lines at any time. Give yourself plenty of time to park as the lot is fairly small. And if you're there with someone else and planning to sit down and eat there, have your friend scout for tables while you wait in line (or vice versa). Finding a table might be the toughest part of all. Tito's may not float everyone's boat, but I've always been a big fan. It's greasy and inexpensive, but I think it's unfair to compare it to any fast food chain out there.  Tito's has it's own unique flavor. It's got a cult following with a lot of repeat business for a great reason. Look at those lines and tell me: how can all of those people be wrong? ;)

This place is "to die for" and by that, I mean you should die before coming here.  This is some of the worst Mexican food I've ever tasted, with the exception of Taco Bell being worse.  Most of my Mexican friends avoid this place like the plague.  All of that being said, I have never seen this place without a gigantic line out onto the sidewalk, so someone must like it. The tacos are small and are made of tasteless ground beef (might be brown cardboard, still awaiting test results), lettuce and shredded cheese.  The cheese comes in two styles: dry edges or overly moist clumps.  I prefer the overly moist, since at least it has some flavor.   The Spanish word salsa translates as soup and that is exactly what you get when you order the salsa at Tito's, a bowl of watery tomato bits with spices.  Mmm, mmm, makes my mouth just water at the thought of it.  I might be okay with it if it was thicker, but it really seems to be just water with tomato bits, cilantro and white onions. There are 56 million other Mexican places in Los Angeles; pick one them, rather than this place.

So I like cheap sit down mexican restaurants.  The food is usually pretty good, there's usually a pitcher of margaritas and service is quick.  Good times with friends for a low hassle free price right?  The only part of that  your going to get here is the cheap price and ok food. The place is a self dellusional institution unto it's self.  There's a really long line so the food must me really good and worth the hassle right.  Wrong !!!  My guess is that way back when, the prices were really cheap compared to everything else and they had somewhat better food so that's how they became such a legend.  Now it's just a cheesy place with a really long line and just ok to so-so food.  But don't take my word for it.  Stand in line for a really long time and find out yourself.  You have lots of free time to kill for a cheap so-so experince right?

The biggest tragedy is that they advertise for Tito's late at night next to those ads for girls gone wild and other sex items. Especially since I can't get my fake hard shell taco fix on at that time. Being off the 405, it would help if it was open that late. Clearly there couldn't be any chance of traffic on the 405 then, right? If anything, I want Tito's to stop advertising. The lines are long enough as it stands. I'll tell you what, the only thing better than a tito's taco, is one I didn't have to wait in line for. On to the food. If you're used to the taco truck/stands form of tacos, this may not be for you. It'll kick back memories of your young school days in the cafeteria when you got this hard shell taco and clump of shredded beef. The orange cheese will match the person waiting in back of you that looks like they spent a couple of hours at the tanning booth. But in the end, it'll be a good taco. I'd say it's leaning towards being a L.A. Landmark by now. It's the east side equivalent of Taco Lita's from Arcadia and just as tasty when it comes to non-Mexican Mexican food. Price isn't terrible. You're paying for some of the experience and getting all of the flavor. It's going to be a toss up for folks. You're going to either wonder why these white wash tacos are so appealing or you're going to scarf them down after a long day at the beach in this summer heat. Also, their classy jingle can burn in hell because it has burned a hole into my head. I LOVE TITO'S TACOS, DO YOU LOVE TITO'S TO! GAAAAAH!! Get it out of my head!

Today I went to Tito's Tacos for the first time ever.  After 8 years of just driving by because the lines were always too long, we finally gave it a shot this afternoon.  And I have to say it - it was a let down.. Here's the skinny: It's a cash only place.  They have an ATM machine outside, but ever since I got my ATM card cloned at a 7-Eleven, I'm wary of any non-bank ATMs. It's SUPER cheap.  We ordered a taco w/ cheese, an enchilada, a beef burrito w/ cheese, a side of rice, a small guacamole, and two large sodas.  Our bill was just under $15. They don't have a lot of options - just what's on their menu board.  There's only one kind of taco (shredded beef), two kinds of burrito (bean or beef), two kinds of tamale (beef or chicken), a tostada, and sides (rice, beans, Chili con Carne, guacamole).  You can also add rice or cheese to the burritos. My taco was ok.  The crispy shell was a little on the hard side and the beef was a bit mushy.  The salsa was good, but it wasn't spicy enough to counteract the blandness of the meat. The burrito was a sloppy wet mess.  As soon as you bit into it, it started to ooze everywhere.  Seriously - it was the soupiest burrito I've ever seen.  Bean soup in an edible wrapper.  I guess the beef burrito is supposed to be Chili con Carne, but I'm accustomed to my chili having more substance than that. The enchilada was unrecognizable.  We took a bite each and then dumped the rest.  It tasted ok, but since my boyfriend lost his appetite, I already had too much food to handle on my own. The guacamole was horrendous.  I know you get what you pay for ($1.20 for a small cup of guac) but it was more like avocado flavored dip.  I guess it had the essence of avocado - but it's hard to say if any actual avocados were used in the end product. I think we ended up eating more chips w/ salsa and our sodas than the actual main dishes.  The salsa was light and refreshing, but I wanted it to have more bite.  The closest comparison I can make is kimchee.  The more kimchee has time to age and marinate, the better it tastes - and this salsa was pretty new kimchee. I would have to be REALLY hungry (or high) to go back here.  And just to clarify - I'm not a food snob.  I've eaten tacos off of roadside stands in Mexico and I'm always down for a bacon wrapped street hot dog.  I just like food that tastes good (or tastes good to me).

Remember the show Unsolved Mysteries, where the ominous host with the preternaturally ominous voice would recount murderous events that, you guessed it, haven't yet been solved? (Although I distinctly remember certain shows where they would go to a commercial break and come back with an "update," releasing new information on the case that may or may not have led to an explanation.) Well, they should have devoted an episode to the unsolved mystery that remains Tito's Tacos. The creepy guy should be talking to the camera in front of Tito's Tacos with the line of 500 people behind him. His narration would go something like this: ::creepy voice imitation:::: "Los Angeles, California. The greater Los Angeles area offers hundreds and hundreds of restaurants devoted to Mexican food that are indisputably superior to Tito's Tacos. The never-ending lines have prompted us to conduct an investigation as to why this is happening. We may have found evidence that Tito puts hypnotizing elements in the salsas that make innocent customers think they like the food. There are no murders in this episode, but we will recreate events that may shed new light on the popularity of Tito's Tacos." We cut to a bad actor playing Tito picking up the hyponitizing powder from another bad actor in the back of an alley with his co-workers. The creepy voicer over starts again: "On the chilly  night of January 15th, 1989, near a tire store in Los Feliz, Mr. Tito was reportedly seen by a kitchen worker on his break picking up two duffel bags of heavy-duty hallucinatory drugs at the back entrance of a pharmaceutical company" "He then sprinkled these drugs over the ingredients in his kitchen to make people think they enjoy his food" "After the commercial break, (creepy music again)Tito's brother, Alex, who is no fan of his cuisine, may have reason to corroborate our story." "Stay tuned...for more Unsolved Mysteries" .

After waiting in line for 20 minutes in a Times Square clusterfuck that would give Pink's penis envy, I managed to order a beef and rice burrito and a taco with cheese.   My burrito "meat" was so hacked to death it may as well have been a cat for all I know.  The taco meat was the same, and the cheese (45 cents extra) on the taco was superfluous garbage.  I tore most of it off, and ultimately threw half my burrito in the trash. The total for both, including free stale tortilla chips and watery salsa, was $6.50.  Tax is magically included in the price! The only explanation I can imagine for the success of Tito's Tacos is either their late-night-TV commercial jingles ("I love Tito's Ta-cos...") or Gustave Le Bon's "The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind."  He pre-dates Tito by about 100 years.

It's somewhat pissy and childish of me to write a review just because I wanted it to be a bad review. Let's face it, Titos sucks. It really does. It's one of those weird LA phenomena that tricks everybody into thinking they are on to something just because the line is long. And the line is long because everybody thinks everyone else in line is on to something. It's a grease pit catch 22. The taco shells are deep fried, the meat is far to greasy and the burritos are not much better than the crap you'd get at the school cafeteria. Has anyone here actually been to Mexico and had an authentic taco?? This isn't even close to that. This is LA late night grease that's made to satisfy and pacify. Stay away from this. If you really need to have the cultural experience...fine, it's worth trying once. Oh yeah...it's cheap.

I can't figure out why there are so many people hating on Tito's Tacos.  I'm not going to stereotype but the lines of brown people out front speak for itself, and since a lot of those people have families/other things to do than write Yelp reviews (I'm clearly not one of them), I'm guessing that's why this place has a 3 star average. I'm also going to go ahead and guess that a lot of these reviewers are the kind of kids who want the most authentic of authentic "insert cuisine" because it will make them a better person. Anywho, a Mexican friend of mine took me here today and Tito's Tacos tacos and burritos are DELICIOUS.  That's all that matters.  Given the ingredients, is the final product yummy?  If they were out to be the most authentic, they probably wouldn't serve what they do.  I think they're in the business of satisfying hunger and I've certainly been full for the last few hours.   The beef and cheese burrito reminded me of eating beef stew with shredded cheddar.  YUM.  And the taco meat was the same consistency and also good.  That was understated.  I LOVED the taco.  I wish I had 2.  Apparently the commercials suggest that as well. Anyway, don't listen to the haters.  If you're hungry and want something tasty and filling, Tito's Tacos is EXCELLENT.  If you're looking for something authentic and complicated, go somewhere else.

I would come here all the time when I used to live a few blocks away. Then I moved to the Valley. Oddly enough, moving to the Valley didn't change the frequency of my visits at all. I would gladly make the trek down the 405 from Woodland Hills to Culver City just to order two (sometimes three) entire boxes of their mouth-watering burritos. No, I wouldn't eat all the burritos in one sitting -- I would eat a couple, refrigerate the rest and reheat them on another day. That's how much I love their burritos. I'm not a taco fan, so I can't comment on them. But their burritos are like no other. The burritos aren't your typical American version (i.e., with salsa, lettuce, sour cream, guacamole, etc.), so don't order their burritos if you like them with all the bells and whistles. I'll be the first to admit, it's not for everyone. They use a more traditional, Mexican recipe (i.e., refried beans, rice and meat are the only fillings). You can ask them to add cheese, if you so desire (but it'll cost a little more). What makes their burritos unique is the tangy sauce they mix together with their meat filling. They're not dry burritos. In fact, when you take a bite, the meat filling oozes out. There will always be long lines, regardless of what time of day it is. However, the lines move fast because the women behind the windows bust their buns to get your orders completed in a timely fashion. So don't let the long lines intimidate you. The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars is because parking is scarce. The parking lot is very small. Oftentimes, I have to circle the block a couple of times to find parking on the street. I live in San Francisco now, but whenever I visit LA, I make it a point to come here. I have yet to find another restaurant that prepares their burritos the way Tito's Tacos does. After living in LA for 8 years, this was (and still is) my favorite place to have burritos.

Oh hell no.  I waited in line for that??  F' this place.  I'm not sure why there's so much love for Tito's, where did you people go to high school?  I only ask because the tacos from my high school cafeteria were better than this and I went to school in MICHIGAN.  That's right, even Old El Paso can school Tito's. The salsa is bland and can't help the taco.  The meat is bland.  The only redeeming factor on the flavor trainwreck is the cheese, and that's only because I've been eating fat free cheese for years and full fat cheese is a treat.  Down with groupthink.  The next time you come to Tito's for a taco, turn west, walk under the 405, and when you hit Sawtelle you'll see Don Felix Meat Market on the NW corner.  Go there, eat a taco, and wash away your Tito sins.

I really want to like this place, they don't take credit cards and no shit from any customers (my kind of place) --  I even ran into my cousin randomly there, who I never see.   Unfortunately, I just think their Tacos suck.  If the name of the place was Tito's Burritos, Tacos, and Fireworks, I could probably forgive them.  But the name is f'ing Tito's Tacos, so you better have some bomb ass mofo tacos, which I don't think is the case.  I mean, I'm no Taco Bell ho, but I was sorta craving a hard shell taco from TB after eating there.  And don't get me started on the salsa, it wasn't pretty.

So, here's the thing... There are some institutions in LA that are worth waiting in line for, however, Tito's is not one of them. Everything is a greasy, over sauced, under seasoned, mess. I've tried on more than once occasion and I don't understand the hype, especially when there is quality Mexican all over southern California. Weird orange cheese, mushy weird salsa, stale chips....why? Don't do it, I'm telling you, listen to reason, stay far far away.

899th Reviewer... Finally gave this place a try with my girlfriend yesterday.  We ordered 2 Beef Tacos (Crunchy), and holler! They were so tasty!  (I've tried them before, but it was a lunch run from the office, and they weren't fresh, so I wasn't too thrilled). You MUST get, the Classic Guacamole, Red Sauce, and the Jalapeno Salsa (yum).  We ordered a side of beans to accompany our tasty sides & chips. My ONLY issue with the Tacos is the shell & the chips, they're SUPER CRUNCHY...and I honestly feel like my mouth gets a serious work-out from all the crunchiness that's happening.  OUCH!...Oh, and the heartburn afterwards.

This place ain't so bad, I was a bit skeptical about it since I am more of a soft taco kind of guy, like the ones that can be purchased at the various taco trucks around town. But upon my first tasting I could see why this place is so popular. The line outside can be a little off putting at first glance, but it moves rather quickly. They definitely have their system down. You order outside, then pick up your food inside, then you sit down and enjoy. They take cash only but Tito has conveniently provided an ATM for his customers. Nice move Tito, you got all the bases covered! I have heard this place compared to Jack-In-The-Box tacos but that's not true, Tito's Tacos are much tastier and I'm sure the meat quality is far better. Plus I have not heard about anybody croaking from eating a Tito's taco. So far I have not ventured away from the tacos but judging from the other reviews here, the burritos sound appetizing.

I like the idea of a little taco place being so old and popular and cheap... but the chips are stale, the salsa is watery, the parking is crazy, the lines are long, it's cash only and the tacos are kinda bland.

Some of my friends love this place... They seriously love Tito's Tacos. For me it's never been awesome, but I thought it was time to give it another visit today. This classic taco joint remains the same: busy, yet average... Got three regular "crunchy" tacos with cheese for just under $7.  It comes with "thick" tortilla chips and a "runny and lumpy" salsa.  The tacos have beef, lettuce, and long strings of cheese.  The tacos were good, but not great because the shells are too thick and the meat has a lack of flavor.  Without the cheese, there really wouldn't be much taste to them. Parking at lunch/dinner times can be a pain, but it was a quick in-and-out today because I went so early.  It opens at 10:00 a.m. Still not quite sure why Tito's Tacos always has a line and is so busy, but I guess, it is because the food is consistent and not dramatic in its flavors so the tacos become kind of a default comfort food.

Tito's is great. I don't want to think about how much is fried, but man I like crunchy things. My usual order: Two tacos with cheese One enchilada Free chips and salsa The tacos are crunchy, loaded with cheddar cheese, and a good portion of shredded beef.  They aren't tiny either. The enchilada is melty and tasty. But mostly I get it so I can supplement my chips and salsa with chips and and enchilada sauce. The salsa isn't terribly spicy, but has good flavor.   The other stuff on the menu isn't worth looking at. Especially don't think about getting a burrito. This is not a burrito joint. The only negative is the line. Depending in when you show, you could be waiting for up to 15-20 minutes. And people try to cut. But hey, find your niche of goodies to get (try what I do), and you'll love Tito's too!

Oh yeah, Tito's Tacos.  I don't even need to write a review, but I figured I had to add to the arsenal.  This is an LA landmark, and if you haven't been then you have to try it. Tito's is cheap, simple, unique, and delicious.  There is almost always a significant line, but it moves pretty quickly.  You can either order inside or outside.  If you look through the windows, you don't see anything fancy... just good old mass quantity food prep.  (Clean) garbage cans filled with tortilla chips, and huge vats containing meat, beans, cheese, lettuce, salsa... you get the picture.  And it's alllll good. I've eaten here countless times, and although I've had everything on the menu (it isn't overly extensive... they have tacos, bean burritos, meat burritos, bean and meat burritos, cheese enchiladas, tamales... and I think that's about it), this is grub at its finest.  I almost always get the same thing... a couple of tacos (if you want chicken, piss off)... meat and lettuce, and add some cheese for a few cents extra please.  And a meat and bean burrito... con queso y mas queso por favor.  The tacos are seriously fried, but with juicy, tender meat inside.  And the burritos are sloppy as all get out... my advice is eat open the top, and scoop out the innards with chips, and that will prevent it from gushing everywhere... once you've cleaned it up a little in this fashion, then you can proceed with housing the rest of it. I can't say enough good things about Tito's except that it is an integral part of the LA experience.  There isn't another taco shop like it out there, whether in LA, Mexico, or anywhere else.  This stuff's the bomb.

I tried the tacos and enchiladas and was NOT impressed. The food was mediocre at best (low quality and under-seasoned meat and processed american cheese, canned enchilada sauce), the service was horrible (20 min wait at a walk up window) and very slow. I really wanted to like this place and had high hopes because there always seems to be a line when I drive by. I can't figure out why this place is popular but there are definitely better options in the area for great Mexican food!

I can understand why people think this place is too hyped up, but they likely fell into the trap of ordering something other than hard shell tacos.  Don't order the burrito, enchilada,  etc- even stay away from the guacamole that has a texture of soup.  As I tell anyone I'm taking who has never been- JUST ORDER THE HARD SHELL TACO. The shells are fried before your eyes and the meat is the equivalent of a filet mignon cooked to perfection.   The lines are long but move pretty quickly.  If you're looking for a standard sit down Mexican restaurant, try something else, but if you're down for some awesome tacos (and nothing more) hit up Tito's.

Big tacos, but the taste doesn't measure up. I don't understand all the hype with this place. I spent the day in LA with a friend of mine who used to work in Culver City and who ate at this joint in the 80s, and she swore up and down they were the best tacos she ever had. Well, I didn't think so. The meat was way too salty, the cheese tasted like it came from a heavily processed block of god knows what, and the guacamole was watery and tasteless. Boo! I mean, this place has been around and making money since the 70s, so enough people obviously like their food, including my friend, but according to my taste-buds these tacos are not worth the calories or the money.

Had the pleasure of coming here who is a taco fan like me. Though I got the chicken tamales ($2.60) and after comparing to Tom's tacos (Here's why I compared it http://chowhound.chow.co…) this was a whole lot better! The lines here reminds me of Costco food court. You just find a line and order.  The ladies write down what you want and you pay when you pick up shortly afterwards. I really don't know why people hate this place? Perhaps its the annoying website? http://www.titostacos.co… Or maybe it's the always full parking lot?  Or maybe its just a pain in the arse to drive out, and out past LAX for a taco? For the price and quality, it's really worth stopping by if you are in the area. BTW, for my  tamales they give you this red meat sauce, it tasted like a kicked up version of meat stew. Not bad. Tom's does not have this on their menu.

I very much so dislike this place. I frequented  this locale a very long time ago...during my college years. Every time,  with the hope that it would be better. I don't understand why there's such a fan base for this restaurant when there are a kajillion and one other mexican restaurants that far surpass the quality of Tito's attempt for tacos. Here is my opinion on the said tacos: 1. Cheese is NASTY, as in watered down cheese nasty. 2. Meat, is that meat? 3. Line is usually long Tito's Tacos is a resounding NO! in my book.

Can we say overrated? Last night I went to Tito's for the first time. My sister who lives pretty close to there was all pumped up about taking me there because she loves to show off her food joints to others. Well I parked, entered the joint, and I could already tell it was westside hype at it's finest. Cops who are tired and hungry, college kids who are broke, and locals who are on a budget and are too lazy to cook, stand in line and are totally salivating. One guy who was standing infront of me rolls up and orders 32 tacos. My sister hyped it up so I was like "Dayum this shit must be good". We ordered tacos and enchiladas, with a side of guacamole.  While the order was prepared quickly, the service was kinda abrupt. I asked the dude what kind of meat was in the burritos and he looked at me like a was a fucken ogre with tutu.  The sign just reads "Burritos, Meat" "Burritos, beans and meat" I think I had the right to ask. Anyhow we get to her place, eat, and the shit was way too tex-mex for my Tijuana ass. The guacamole was watery, the enchiladas were way past soggy, and the salsa had way to much garlic salt in it. The tacos were not all that great either. Mexicans in Mexico do not eat hard shelled tacos. They eat fried tacos with grease dripping from the tacos but not this psuedo Taco Bell stuff. Oh well, one must learn through experience. For good tacos stay in East L.A. Down with Tito's Taco Bell! For shame.

No matter what time you hit Tito's, there's always a hungry crowd on the verge of rioting for tacos; it has the same manic energy as refugees swarming a UN relief truck for water and rice. It's actually an interesting study in herd behavior, but unfortunately it's also the highlight of this experience. This afternoon I gave Tito's a second chance, and almost immediately regretted it. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice...well, shame on you again. It takes a lot of work to make tacos, burritos, and enchiladas this ghastly. Not to mention the effort that it takes to treat your customers with such obvious disdain. It gives me no pleasure to bash hard-working entrepreneurs in this forum, but I have to get this one off my chest. For one thing, nothing short of an act of god could slow the flood of eager diners here. And for another, ten people will post five-star reviews declaring Tito's the best taco in LA within the next hour. Chalk another one up for the herd.

I don't know if I'm really feeling the Tito's Tacos. I think the meat is what kills it... it's kinda nasty and disappointing. This place gets 1 star for the chips and salsa and 1 star for the delicious cheese that they put on the tacos. That cheese is freaking awesome and tastes like I just grated it from a huge block of cheddar. Other than that, not much else going for Tito's. I'm not really into waiting in line. I just feel like there are a million other similar Mexican places that have just as good of food but with less hassle and more selection. Once my friend took me to the place Cinco De Mayo right next door and they have a bomb California burrito that I would take over Tito's any day. Also El Tarasco is way better.

Eat It OR Beat It? **BEAT IT!!** With all due respect, a friend of mine told me to try this place because it was the "Pink's" version of tacos. First of all, Pink's is much tastier than this place and quite frankly more edible. Tito's Tacos has to be one of the worst tacos I have EVER eaten and I am not being unreasonable. I have consulted with my Latin friends, especially my Mexican friends and they all laughed when I used the Pink's analogy and I couldn't agree any more! Beef & Chicken Tacos: Lacks in flavor and overpowering with cheese. Meat was dry and I felt like the meat was used from the previous day, true or not, that's just my experience on that particular day. The tacos simply were horrendous. The salsa was so watered down that I couldn't taste anything besides watered down tomatoes. Sad to say it, but Taco Bell and Del Taco had more flavor than Tito's tacos. First of all, real Mexican tacos are not crunchy, and if you want really good Mexican tacos, you go to those dollar trucks or any other place that has soft corn tortillas and not crunchy tacos! CONCLUSION: Avoid at all costs, honestly.

I think I'd like em even if I wasn't starving. :x There was a burrito somewhere in that box of tortilla chips, and it was dark like chocolate, and I'm not sure if it was chicken or pork or whatever, but I know it tasted nasty.

I was lucky enough to grow up in West Los Angeles and that meant that I got to eat some great grub in my formative years. Tito's, Apple Pan, Johnnies, and Shakeys just to name a few. At Tito's I would stay away from the tacos. Just didn't like the consistency of the meat.. For me it was the all meat burrito with cheese. You get a large cup of salsa, tell them yes you are willing to pay extra and pour the salsa into the burrito as you eat it. The trick is to try to not make it too soggy so that the bottom falls out. If I knew that my time on earth was limited I would make Tito's  one of the stops on the culinary tour.

I don't get this place.  Is this the Pink's of tacos? I waited in line with friends and finally ordered, sat and ate. Excuse me, why did we (and all these other people) wait so long for this grub?  It's good, but nothing that special. I'm not trash talking this place, but really, it is an average place.  I just don't get the hype.  Tacos durado, fried and greasy...not a problem, but the overall taste is not something I have craved again and again... One important note: the tacos are fine, the water guacamole is tolerable, but I will never order a burrito from here ever again...it's just gross (harsh, but it's my true opinion).

This place dates all the way back to when I was a kid. I remember my dad would bring some home for dinner if he was coming back from LA. While the nostalgic feeling is nice and makes me yearn for yesteryear, it's their tacos that make me return. Perfectly crispy shells, piled high with lettuce and cheese. I always get the beef ones. soooooooooooooo freakin good. Makes me want to hop in the car and get some now.

There's a line. Get in it. My mom said my aunt parked the car & they stood in line simply because there was one to try this place. Thank goodness when I went w/ my bff there was no line because it was drizzling & ya'll know how sunny Californians deal w/ rain...they can't... We got a tamal, tacos, burrito and chips & salsa to try the full spectrum. The tamal was greasy, but I have to admit it was pretty tasty. The burrito was average though the meat was melt in your mouth. The tacos were pretty solid. It was probably a very good representation of a taco. Crispy shell, flavorful meat. We didn't realize it already came w/ chips & salsa so we probably could've thrown a mini party with the amount we hoarded. I'd go back for a taco, but I wouldn't wait in line.

I don't care if they only serve their "tacos" and burritos. I just want GOOD food. The meat was all dried and looked like dog food.

As I waiting in line for at least 15 minutes to place my order, I realized there is just one type of taco, I was craving pastor or another type but I just went with it and ordered two.

He always loved the burritos from here while I tended to only get the tacos. Chips with salsa and guacamole were always a must. Years and a few boyfriends later, I no longer can consume a taco from this place. Perhaps my taste buds matured. Or I matured. Whatever it is, the food here is just greasy. The parking is too crazy for me now and I can't stand the lines anymore. I just don't think it's worth the hassle for the grease fest.

I've been back a couple times and had the tacos.  The tacos are comparable to the rest of the food, for the most part.  Their focus is on comfort food for sure.  The yellow cheese on the tacos exemplifies that well.  Again--greasy, cheap, and tasty.

I love Tito's Tacos. There's I've said it. Eating the first taco is like the first day of Spring: birds chirp, the sun's rays seem to surround you and you're completely unshaken in your focus on the taco in your hand like the girl pumping gas in her bikini. Call it love, call it lust. Call it whatever you want. But I've graduated from want to need when it comes to those tacos. My personal record is eight tacos in one sitting. And I wanted to do more...I really did. But I had dinner in an hour and my girlfriend didn't want me to spoil my appetite. Their menu is simple...ordering is even easier. Get any number of tacos you want (you can get enchiladas too but I never have) and it comes with salsa for chip or taco dippin'! Then eat the tacos and fall into your Zen-like state of enlightenment. I know I do...sometimes my eyes even roll into the back of my head. Last time I went, my girlfriend got a upset because I looked "a little too satisfied." They keep it real...I keep it real. But now I'm all hungry...

I used to live a few blocks away on Culver, and would pretty much go here several times a week on the way home from college, and then eventually it become on the way home from work. I had several different roomates at the time who were just as addicted. I can't remember a time when there wasn't at least two empty Tito's boxes stacked next to the trash can in the kitchen. The deal was that if you ordered 4 or more items, they'd give you a large cardboard box for them and fill it up with chips. The boxes were such that they didn't even fit in our trash bin - and being young guys, taking out the trash wasn't a high priority. Get the tacos obviously. The enchiladas and tamales are pretty tasty too. Be sure to ask for the small green hot salsa. You basically mix it into the larger red mild salsa container... sooo good! I still remember the time I tried to warm up a leftover Tito's taco in my toaster oven. BAD IDEA! These tacos are greasy! The taco oil set off a small fire which set off the fire alarm, and caused all the tenants in our building to evacuate their apts. I still haven't gotten a replacement toaster oven :(

This was one of the worst burrito experiences I ever had.   First, they only serve beef, so don't be fooled by "meat" on the menu. They mean they only have one "meat". Supposedly, it's beef, or "beef" as in the weird brown-saucy mess that places like Taco Bell try to pass off as meat. Second, they put your to-go order in a flimsy brown box so when you go out to the parking lot, the box bends and collapses, making you drop all your chips and fork.  And the fork turns out to be the most important part of the whole ordeal, because when you try to pick up your unwrapped burrito, it falls apart in your hands, making it completely un-eatable, oh if only you had a fork, right?  Well, that's on the ground of the dirty parking lot. So, you throw your baby-poo-looking mess of a burrito away and drive down to Yak-in-the-box, where at the very least, they know how to make food that you can hold in your hand. LA staple? Pulease.

Definitely over-rated.  I wasn't a fan of the tacos that I had, but I will caveat this by saying that I'm not a big fan of tacos that are essentially entirely deep-friend.  This isn't your normal taco shop which offers a fresh tortilla with your choice of meat.  Here, your choices are fairly limited as far as the meat -- beef or no beef.  Where's my al pastor or carnitas? There are definitely better taco shops on the Westside and with $1 options at fast food places, I'd rather go to Wendy's or Jack 'N the Box.

"My Boys" used to live down the street from this place, so you bet I went here a lot. These boys swore by it (then again they swore by Dark Age of Camelot also), but my feelings are lukewarm towards Tito's Tacos. The beans are tasty, but what I like best there is the salsa. Here is the secret for getting more salsa with your order: Order more food. That is not to say stock pile on a whole bunch of tacos you don't want to eat; if you're going there with some buddies, with your orders combined, you can get the big salsa container. Two tacos aren't enough. Go for three per order. Also make sure you don't make one BIG order, spread them out...three tacos here, one burrito and two tacos there...these guys had it down to a science.

For me, Tito's is about the experience, rather than the food.  My husband's dearly departed grandparents used to take him there as a child, he introduced me to the place, I got hooked, and every time his parents are in town, they ask to go there.  I like their tacos, mind you, but I know that with a little effort and ingenuity, I could replicate them at home.  In fact, I *have* made that salsa.  I have almost created a passing version of their enchiladas, but why bother when I can roll over to Tito's?  Both my father-in-law and I love dipping their salty, warm chips in the enchilada sauce as though it's salsa. Here's what bothers me about Tito's.  I don't think I should have to ask for cheese as an extra, and then pay what feels like extra for it.  'Cause, then I have to calculate the whole order in my mind, multiply my tacos--which are in the double digits because my husband is a big eater--by the price of the cheese, add that to the total, and then my head hurts by the time I'm at the counter.  And the last time I checked, they only accepted cash, which means I'm a little stressed on top of everything else, wondering if I have enough.  Thanks for putting the ATM out front, but Tito, I'd rather you make it more convenient when I'm standing there in front of your employee, perplexed. That off my chest, even at its busiest times, I can't say that I've stood in line at Tito's for all that long.  Because, for some unknown reason, most people like to stand outside.  Even when it's cold.  How many times have I incredulously walked past people practically stacked on top of each out front, only to walk right up to the counter inside?  It must be the Pink's syndrome or something.

OK, so I'm really confused by Tito's Tacos.  Every time I drive by there is a line out the door.  It's reasonable to assume that when there's that kind of foot traffic on a regular basis it must be good, right?  Yet when I finally stopped in to try it, I thought the food was terrible, the service was crappy and it was filthy dirty on top of that.  So why do people love it so much?   The taco shells were literally soaked in oil.  The meat inside the tacos tasted like low grade dog food and was covered by cheese and this greasy, overly salty brown sauce.  I kept trying to figure out what it was.  Mystery sauce?  Not good!   To use a cartoon analogy, if your typical enchilada sauce is say Speedy Gonzales, then the brown mystery sauce at Tito's would be the equivalent of his lesser cousin, Slowpoke Rodriguez.   It reminded me of those commercials for that dog food "Chuck Wagon", where they would pour some water in the  bowl and make a meaty soup out of it.  Speaking of dog food, the idea of getting on the floor and chowing down next to Fido is more appetizing to me than muscling down another coronary in a crispy corn shell from Tito's.   I don't get you, Tito's Tacos!  Even Del Taco makes better Mexican food than you and I wouldn't feed that to my dog if I had one.   Next time you're jonesing for cheap Mexican food, step on the gas (pun intended), drive right past Tito's and instead hit the taco trucks.  The lines aren't as long and the price is right ($1 tacos).  Your tummy will thank me.

Why do people line up for this food? Or wax poetic? I just don't get it. Tito's specializes in the sort of Mexican food that was popular mid-century. Not a lot of flavor or nuance there. Nothing worth waiting in line for! When forced to go, I'll get a bean and cheese burrito, but I always go home with a tummy ache.

Sitting at the keyboard with day-old, previously unopened Tito's guacamole sauce and red salsa at my side, I can't think of a better time to update my rating on this joint. Everything I've said about it before is true, but I'm starting to relent on their revised tortilla chips (decidedly thinner and possibly cheaper corn flour--if you can't tell the difference, you simply weren't paying attention). They seem to treat you better when you order more, because my people probably spent about $30 and said they got an ample supply of free chips, but they still bought an extra bag.  When I last ordered $12 worth of grub, they only gave me enough free chips for me to pick my teeth with. So, as their jingle SHOULD go, "I'm OK with Tito's Taco's, you're OK with Tito's too."

I love food. I love eating. And I constantly heard the locals speak of Tito's Tacos like it was the second coming of Jesus. Well... after living in Los Angeles for over 20 years I finally tried some last night. I had a taco with cheese, meat and bean burrito with cheese, and chili beans with cheese. I don't know what I expected before I took my first bite... maybe I was expecting too much, like some sort of orgy in my mouth and only Playboy Playmates were invited or something... but after I took my first bite... ...meh... ...instead of said orgy in my mouth is was just a threeway gangbang. And the chicks weren't even hot. I scarfed down all the food since It was about 7pm and I hadn't eaten anything all day and it was a fair amount of food for the price but it wasn't the orgasmic experience to me that people had claimed it to be. The tacos, sadly to say, were "Jack-in-the-Box"esque but with slightly less flavor. The burrito was good, but only after I drenched every bite with a copious amount of the free jalapenos. The chili beans tasted like they came from a can (Hormel maybe?). But with that said, none of the food was offensive in any way, it just wasn't the oral pleasure I expected. Would I eat there again? Sure... but let's get drunk first. Tito's seems to be good drunk food.

Last time I went to Tito's Tacos was about 2 years ago. I left completely underwhelmed and wondering why people wait in such long lines for such bland tacos. Now that I work pretty close by, I gave it another go this afternoon - after all at 11:30 it was early so there wouldn't likely be a huge line. When not having a long line is the best thing going for a place, it's not really a place I wants to be at. I got 3 tacos and a drink. The salsa was more liquid than salsa should ever be and not a thick liquid - it was watery. Same could be said for the "hot sauce" I asked for - it was basically small bits of pickled jalapenos soaked in water giving it pretty much no shot of packing any punch. The tacos were ok: nothing special, quite bland. It's a bad sign in LA if you're at Mexican joint and you look around and there's no Mexicans. Next time I think Tito's, I'm heading to Cinco de Mayo directly next door to it.

The first time I tried Titos, I walked out of there thinking...what's the big deal?  It's kind of like watching the Red Sox sweep the Rockies...you thought it was going to be more exciting. But last night I was dragged to Tito's yet again, and this time around, it wasn't bad.  I mean I got the beef tamale and the beef burrito.  The burrito was really good, with the thick beef broth sauce oozing all over.  The tamale had really dry meat, which is weird considering you typically steam tamales.  I dunno. They took our orders really quickly but getting our food took a while.  Also, parking was a pain.  The chips and salsa were really good. I particularly liked the finely machine mangled salsa.   All in all I'd say the food is...well..."different."

First I want to preface this review by saying I like Tito's and deep fried shredded beef tacos have their origins in Mexico.

Alright, I digs myself some Mexican food. Put me in a dingy-looking Mexican joint and I'm the mayor of Smilesville (and Miss Smilesville '68). So after years of hearing that the only thing better than a Tito's taco was two, I finally had the chance to test this theory. I came here after bowling at AMF Midway Lanes with the UCLA bowling club. It's late night, there's not much else open. I'd heard this place got some long lines, but when we got here it was all clear. I could see for miles, all the way to the back of the place where some beat-up arcade console was beeping to itself in the corner. Now, the ordering is sort of unexpected. It's sort of like a Mexican version of In-N-Out where they only give you a few options and if you don't like it, well you can take your ass somewhere else. So I got myself three beef tacos, and OOH CHILD. The shell is about the consistency pain and tyranny. It takes CRUNCH to maximum levels, without regard to your teeth or any soft tissue in your mouth. Then the meat. It's brown, it's shredded, and it's tough. You'd think with that much attitude, it'd have some flavor, but no. Mild as a kitten (not that I'm saying kittens taste mild). Some salt or any kind of seasoning would help. The worst offense, though, was all the shredded yellow cheese on top. As if they wanted to disguise the bland, anti-flavor of the meat by drowning it in the bland anti-flavor of processed cheese. No amount of the soupy salsa or guacamole drippings could salvage these tacos. Saddest part? I was pretty buzzed when I got here (me bowling=drinking), and I STILL found the food less than decent. So you can have your taco, Tito. In fact, take two and put them together into some hard taco unicycle and ride them right out of here.

1 star - "the only thing you get from Tito's tacos is number two" As a LA native I found this place a little late in life (high school) and after all the hype I had to try it.  I waited in the long line and got my food. I wasn't impressed.  Maybe it was all the authentic food I was raised on, or maybe it was because it had no taste.  I tried a few more times and ended up getting sick a lot and haven't been back since. It seems to be very popular with the out of towners, tourists and film crews.  The film people are the worst because they think they own the place, are jerks and think Tito's is the bomb.  I guess if you have no taste in Hispanic food Tito's is the place for your sorry soul. Disgusting! There always seems to be a traffic jam around this place with people in their big stupid cars buying crates of this crap. Its really ghetto with the tinted windows and sound systems... i guess they have to have somewhere to show off.... what better place than a crappy taco stand under the freeway?

Went here once and that was enough. Was not worth the trip out to this place.  It's much better than Del Taco or Taco Bell, that's for sure. No doubt.  But other than that....this place has been built on a lot of hype.  I don't know where the "HYPE" started  on this place....this place is "OVER-RATED".   Either the people that go here and give it 4-5 stars cuz they don't know any better, but I believe it's because "THEY DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER". Sorry Tito's Tacos....cute jingle on your website... but.just not memorable or up to par on my taste buds.

Madness.  That's how I would describe Tito's.  Lines outside, lines inside.  At least 8 employees taking orders simultaneously... and they all go to the one cashier in the middle to get change.  Does the owner not trust anyone else to handle cash?  It's time to play the efficiency game pal.  Get registers for each line and move the customers along. I liked that the menu was simple, but I thought the tacos were mediocre at best.  In fact, I don't even remember the last time I had a hard shell taco.  Aren't "real" tacos made with small, corn tortillas?  Am I just being a taco snob about this? The enchilada had a lot more flavor so that's probably what I'd get if I ever went back. No free refills on drinks.  Cash only.

I don't understand a portion of the reviews before mine. I am not sure what people are expecting when they come to Tito's. Are they expecting real authentic Mexican food that Mom used to make? Well sorry to break it to you but the food at Tito's is a tad different. Tito's is a staple of the South Bay you either get it or you don't. Any of the people who went to Tito's expecting to sit down at a restaurant and have a waiter or waitress bring you your food you were WRONG and WAY OFF!!!!!!! If you live on the Westside, The Valley or talk about who has the best Taco in Los Angeles then this place is not for you. Tito's has never done me wrong and I have been going since the early 1990's. My girlfriend and I hit up Tito's just about twice a year and order the same thing. We went to Tito's on Superbowl Sunday to find a car sticking out of the side of the building so our Tito's dreams were shot down. We decided to try Tito's again last night during the rain; we walked in and found no line which was a treat because it is usually 10-20 deep. We were in and out within a few minutes. We drove home and had a very good dinner. Parking at Tito's is either hit or miss. The parking lot is a tad confusing getting in and out but there is always additional parking available under the underpass of the 405. PLEASE TIP YOUR SERVER.

I've always got something against these "CASH ONLY" places. I noticed on their menu that it mentions "all items have tax included in the price" yet they manage to duck the tax man by charging us cash only. So, we the consumer pay the taxes but places like Tito's doesn't? Interesting. If I were an IRS agent I would have places like this on lock down. If you're going to charge cash only then the price should reflect that. Onto the food. The meat and bean burrito is fantastic. Delicious flavor just coming out of that flour tortilla after every bite. I even managed to table spoon some salsa into it for maximum flavor. Awesome. Only problem is it's about a half of a pound and costs $5. Wow. The cash only monster strikes back. The tacos were straight up mediocre and they charge for cheese! WTF? What is this place? A burger joint? Who eats tacos without cheese? So, even with the cash only policy, this place still manages to nickel and dime you. Whoa!?! Sure, the tacos are authentically fried which is what I expected. But the real shredded beef had zero seasoning. What exactly am I supposed to taste here? The residue of the cow's recently cured mad cow disease? Ugh. A saving grace would be the "complimentary" chips and salsa. The chips were crunchy, fresh and dense for corn chips and the salsa is up to par with El Pollo Loco's house salsa. Also, the restrooms are moderately clean. Finally, if you love your Mexican food over charged, under flavored, over priced and waiting nearly ten minutes for it, then Tito's Taco's is your place to be! In advertising class, we watched an ad about Tito's Tacos and apparently their slogan was, "The only thing better than a Tito's Taco is two." I'd like to make a new slogan for them, "The only thing better than Tito's Tacos is none." Two stars for the "complimentary" chips and salsa and for the clean restrooms. Everything is forgettable. IRS, get to work.

To me, Tito's was just okay.  I've heard some great things about Tito's but came here to find a pretty average taco (hard shell beef tacos are 1.60 each).  I was definitely surprised to find a hard taco, as I've come to expect soft tacos from just about every taco stand in Los Angeles.  It ended up being pretty bland and just okay.  They also throw in tortilla chips into your box which is rather redundant, because you're just eating more of what is their flavorless taco shells. They do have a parking lot and lines weren't very bad during a weekday afternoon.  Although, judging by their speed, I can see the waits being pretty bad during busy times.  I expected faster with their production line style cooking.  I may come back if I'm in the area, but it's definitely not a destination taco.

Born & raised in Culver City here's what out the out of towner's don't realize about this place,it's the marinaded, boiled meat in the burritos that is all the hype and keeps them coming back for more not the tacos. You want decent tacos? Try the crunchy tacos at El Pollo Loco. You want a mouth watering burrito? Try the "regular burrito with cheese" and you will not be disappointed. Trust me folks, I'be been coming here since the early 70's. It's the burritos, not the tacos that reels them in.

Prepare to feel kind of stupid if you're coming here as a newb with only another newb  companion. The menu doesn't really explain anything, so we ended up holding the line for a few seconds while asking the (unfriendly) lady what our options were: only beef, no soft shell, etc. My roommates go here ALL the time, so I've been dying to try it and had high hopes. I should probably stick to having low expectations instead, so that I'm not sorely disappointed when this supposedly incredible staple of Los Angeles fare ends up not only tasting awful, but making me sick to my stomach the entire day after.

I expected way too much from this place because everytime i drove by, there was always a long line.  But when we got there, we figured out why the line is always long.  The way they take orders and give you your food is so inefficient.  They have multiple windows, but they're all the same.. you go up and place your order, and they'll go cook/get your food, and you just stand there waiting til your food comes out and then you pay - rather than paying right away and going to a different window to pick up your food. There were multiple people who were standing there that told us they weren't in line. On to the food - not good at all really.  I didn't think mexican food could be bad, but it just wasn't good at all. I had two beef tacos and an enchilada.  The tacos were really plain, beef didnt have much flavor - had to use a lot of hot suace.  And the hot sauce wasn't even good either - not hot. The enchilada was too salty. You know a place isn't good when both my friend and i agreed that the best thing we got was the water (which they charged 25 cents for).  Seriously. The salsa for the chips weren't that bad, but still not spicy at all.  And it's cool that they give you free chips w/ each order.   At least now we know this place isn't good even though we see lots of people there all the time. Don't think i'd go back... ever.

I've been here twice, and I won't be back. Their food is not good, regardless of how affordable it is, and pretty darn far from authentic (but I'm sure that's not what their aim is). Food is definitely greasy and not prepared well. I'd much rather go to Taco Bell for lunch or dinner than Tito's. And there's never any parking around.

If it was possible to leave ZERO stars or even NEAGTIVE stars...consider it done.  There is so much hype about this place and it makes no sense. I came here with 5 other people to give it a try and see what the buzz was all about. I ordered beef tacos and chili con carne. If you have ever had the fried tacos from Jack In The Box then you've had a SUPERIOR taco than Tito's tacos. They have similar style but the Tito Taco could not be more bland and lame. The chili was equally as disappointing. The only item I had that wasn't HORRIBLE was the salsa. This place is just trendy. People think it's "cool" to eat here and say they have..,.THAT'S IT!!! Don't believe me....think I'm exaggerating? PLEASE go try it for yourself and if you know anything/nothing about Mexican food...you'll see.

What's better than Tito's Tacos? It's two... We only have their tacos, and guacamole. If you think grease is evil, don't go. If you're a vegetarian, probably avoid the place, if you're not all of the above, then take the time to go have a well done, crunchy, tasty, greasy, awesome taco :) They have also a pretty good guacamole :) It's cash only but it's worth going to the bank before!

If you want to waste your life and money, head on over to Tito's Tacos.   I seriously don't know what the fuss is all about.  Mushy, mystery meat, covered with lettuce and cheese, enveloped in a crispy, greasy tortilla? I've had MUCH better in Mexico from the street vendors and if I knew I'd be wasting $1.80 and a lot of calories on this D rated taco, I would rather have eaten whatever cuisine is offered on Fear Factor, where I'd at least have a shot of gaining something.

I HAVE TO PUT THIS OUT THERE As a native of Culver City I have to say that this place can most definitely be called an ANOMALY. Why does it keep making money? Why can it beat out any single McDonald's restaurant for the hours it's in operation? Its mexican alright, but its so unique in its tastes and textures you either think it's whack Mexican or Gold. For some reason out-of-towners can't understand the spell of Tito's, while most locals do (despite not being able to explain why) I've taken so many people from out of town (or even across town) to Tito's. DO NOT ever expect these people to like Tito's as you do. Most of the time they will think it's either just alright or some whack-ass version of mexican food. THESE people are thinking taco trucks, your neighborhood, full-menu mexican joint, mexico itself, etc.  They won't understand that it's a unique taste you can't get anywhere else in terms of its quality (debatable in grade but not in taste), taste, texture, etc. Like I said, very Mexican indeed, but can be a subversion of Mexican food due to the tastes, ingredients, and textures. But, instead of being birthed and accepted on a mass scale like Tex Mex, this cuisine probably just originated in a Mexican home that improvised intentionally (or to no fault of its own) and came just to Culver to start hooking tongues. Most outsiders aren't down! So it's a local thing?!! Alright, what gets us hooked? What is it that's so good? Is it the meaty viscous con carne sauce and stringy soft meat? the almost perfect combination of their chips and salsa (a crunch you can't replicate and a tanginess and consistency of salsa you could die before trying to make yourself) ? the three chews meat they put in the tacos? (so soft with grease and salt you only need three chews instead of six), the texture and taste of the shredded cheddar and lettuce (something that for some reason your local supermarket can't ever give you)? The familiar taste? The familiar smell?  A shared sense of history and like thought process that could've only been created by the social, ethnic, socio-economic meshing within Culver City and surrounding neighborhoods? Or maybe it's just that these out-of-towners will never appreciate that the same video games have been there since you were a baby ; ) all of it

Tito's Tacos! Oh how I love you so. I love you're tacos, burritos, and especially you're delicious salsa. Just like everyone else said about Pink's being famous for their hot dogs, well Titos is famous for their Tacos! Be warned, that you will have to wait in line a little bit (just like at Pink's), but it is definitely worth it! They have delicious carne asada (my favorite at a Mexican restaurant) and other meats that others might like. Their salsa and chips are amazing. I wish i lived closer to this area so i could come to Tito's more often. P.S. -This place is cash only, so make sure to go to the ATM . Also parking can get difficult.

What a disappointment.   I've been wanting to visit Tito's for quite some time now.  One late evening last month, this wish almost came to fruition, but the line was long and we were cranky, so we drove on.  Apparently, we should have kept on driving. The tacos are cheap.  They're fairly big and therefore satisfying.  However, they were like "meh..."  :(  We tried a tamale, and it was like "eh..."  I ordered a side of guacamole, and it was watery and soupy and more like "eek..." We looked at each other and our thoughts were clear from the expression on our faces: "What the hell?" To repeat, what a disappointment.

Walking in to Tito's, I was encouraged by the MASSIVE line. A line that rivals a line for a disneyland ride on a Saturday during the summer... (The massively INEFFICIENT line, I soon found out. ) But c'mon -- THAT many people in line? It HAD to be good. So, here we are, waiting in line for what seems like an eternity -- my stomach providing a soundtrack of rumbles, anticipating yummy burrito goodness.  My mouth watering... drool collecting at the corners of my mouth... somehow I began to channel Homer Simpson.... We FINALLY reach the window (after standing there for about 15 minutes) I realize why the line was so ridiculous. No you do not order your food, and move out of the way so someone else can order. Nope... you order your food and they make it right there, as you stand there holding up the line. Grrreeatt... So we get our food and I'm not a taco girl -- just because I'm vegetarian, and well.. whatever... So I get a straight-up, simple, bean and cheese burrito. Average. The guac was super runny. Like liquid guac. LIQUID. Though, it tasted okay.. Salsa tasted fresh... bonus. Good enough for a drunk meal -- if you can actually stand up in line for that long without passing out.... but I doubt I'd go back otherwise.

#23 Growing up in West LA, everyone knows about Tito's. A lot of my friends swear by Tito's, but I still can't wrap my mind around what is so spectacular. I could name countless better Mexican places, but my friends end up dragging me here so I guess I can't complain too much. It kind of reminds me of Pink's. It's one of those places you have a try at least once, but neither is great and there is always a line. If you are not set on Mexican food, go to Johnnie's Pastrami around the corner on Sepulveda. Not nearly as cheap, but a better use of your daily calories!

Wow. I went here for the second time last night, totally unsure as to how much food would be appropriate.  As I usually do in such cases, I use cost as the metric to measure how much to buy.  One burrito and three tacos came out to $8.35.   Twenty minutes later, I had finished the beefy and beautiful burrito and one of the tasty tacos and was totally full.  Really?  I coulda gotten away with a $5 meal? Of course, I charged through and finished the other 2 tacos as well, after which I was totally dizzy (f'real). Yesterday was busier than the first time I came here, but it only took about 15 minutes to be on my way.  What more can I ask for? Bonus: both times I've been here, I got a half dollar as part of my change.   Tito's . . . I think I'm falling in like with you.

I'm going to hunt down everyone who told me these were "The best tacos in LA" and shoot them in the dick. Cheddar cheese, hard shells, bland meat, salsa with NO spicy? Bleh.   Even if greasy hard shell restaurant tacos are your thing, these are STILL sub par.   Here's how you can picture it. A greasier version of a taco that a white suburban mother of 4 would make on "Taco Night." The chips were OK. But people saying these are the best tacos, and waiting in line for this... well, that's even more confusing to me than the Pink's Hot Dogs hype.

I sooooo want to love Tito's Tacos.  I know it's is a SoCal cheap eats institiution, a la Pink's, Tommy's, Philippe's, etc. (all of which I love).  But unlike those places, I usually leave Tito's with a feeling of mild disappointment.  I keep trying -- probably eating there 4 or 5 times over the past 10 years -- but it's always the same. Upon first approach, Tito's looks like it will be a great experience.  Lines of folks waiting to order, rows of covered, outdoor tables filled with people eating.  But the food?  Tacos, OK.  Tamales, ehhh.  Burritos?  Well.... You want meat?  Beans?  Cheese?  Those are pretty much your choices.  I was so excited the first time I ordered, I rattled off requests for al pastor, carnitas, and asada, before being pointed to the simmering beef chunks in generic red sauce as the only available meat option. (Admitedly, it's mildly tasty, but people really line up for this?) Again, there's nothing inherently wrong with the food, but nothing remotely special either.  And you'd think that a place with such a limited menu would at least do those few things spectacularly well. But the location is convenient, and once you order, you can usually eat quickly and be on your way.

I decided to try Tito's after hearing all the hype. I gotta say I was disappointed a bit.  I will give them credit for doing crunchy tacos, but that's about it.  The food is BLAND! The meat tastes like canned roast beef. If you're looking for authentic...this ain't the place...if you're looking for good quality food a small step above Del Taco, you've found your spot. I will also add that it's not fair to compare Tito's to places like King Taco...this more on par with El Torito

Ke$ha got this one right: BLAH BLAH BLAH. And these tacos are BLAH BLAH BLAH. My boyfriend Dank K. took me here assuring me of its authenticity and quality. I had high expectations, which grew slightly higher as I saw the long lines. But upon getting my food and watching how it was made, I have to say I was really ... what's the word.... bothered. This is more like cafeteria food than anything else. Everything is slopped into huge metal containers. Nothing about it is authentic. The taste is sub-par, the salsa is bland and I could get more flavor from a taco seasoning packet from Ralphs. And trust me, I've had my fair share of Mexican food in San Diego from the good to the bad to the ugly ... And this, doesn't even hold a flame to other Mexican joints out there. They charge you extra for cheese and guacamole, which I also found unappealing. The burrito didn't even look appetizing. It looked like a dirty diaper. I know this review is slightly harsh but it bothers me when people slop food together and expect others to pay for it. These are supposed to be tacos - delicious, bite-sized, street snacks that make you want to eat 50 of them. I barely finished half. The saddest part? Of the whole meal, I preferred the beans over everything else. Go figure.

Made the drive - waste of time. Tacos? There should be a law against these. They were too hard too dry and totally tasteless. The beans tasted like someone dropped some knock off perfume in the pot *I kid you not.  I kept tasting it for the rest of the day! The chips were nasty and the salsa shouldve been called hunts smashed up tomatos. Like others have said, taco bell and jack in the box are better. All of us who have stood in line look like a bunch of fools. GOD I am kicking myself in the ass for listening to my friends! Or should I say frienemies? You can save yourself people!

TITO's was one of the very first places to do Mexi fast food - the way TACO HELL does today within a corporate structure.   My Dad claims he rolled in here after his prom in 1960 something to grab some late grub back in the day.   I don't think anyone will argue that Tito's is like 'great food' or anything but if you have been coming here once and a while for a good portion of your life - it's nostalgia inside of those tacos and burrito's and fresh 'whatever you call the salsa' and 'avo dip' - yea, it ain't guacamole, but it's good and you acquire a taste for it after a while While I now realize you either LOVE or HATE Tito's - trust me you gotta give it at least 4 times before you pass judgment

I had a hard time deciding which restaurant to give my yelp virginity to, and decided to travel back to my hometown, Culver City. it's rare that I travel to West LA these days, however, when I do, the only place I crave for is Tito's Tacos. I know it's not authentic Mexican food, but the crunchy, oily tacos, with those yummy, crunchy chips and delicious salsa; four words describe it all - YUMMMMMMAY IN MY TUMMAYY! Make sure to add the cheese!! I was very surprised to see that Tito's got such low reviews. I don't know about their business these days, but let me tell you, lines that go around the block ain't no joke. You know they gotta have something good to offer! Maybe it's just something about Tito's that brings me back to the Culver bubble and nostalgia drives my taste buds, because to be honest, most of my out of towner friends don't love Tito's nearly as much as I do. Either way, give it a shot, you might just love it :) Edit: Don't get the burrito - I never liked it, ORDER THE TACOS! It's tito's TACOS :)

It's been many years since I've eaten food from Tito's.  In the past, I think I only had their tacos.  Today, my memory was refreshed...Their tacos are pretty average and nothing that you need to rush back for.  I had a taste of their tamale and enchilada, too.  The tamale isn't very special although I think I liked the enchilada the most out of the three.  The tortilla chips that come with salsa are pretty thick but good. Tito's is probably most worth it if you happen to be in the area and there isn't a long line.

Tito's is located in the Kitch district, Johnny Pastrami is right around the corner.  Don't expect authentic Mexican (where not in Mexico) expect authentic SoCal kitch tacos and darn good ones.  Taco Bell ripped this place off without a doubt.  The quality is much better so comparisons to a mega-corp fast food place are unfair.   They fry their own shells, the beef is slow cooked and shredded, the Chile sauce is homemade and not from a can and out of this world, two kinds of salsa;  tomato spiked with black pepper that is completely addictive and a jalapeno one on request only, that pretty much is Chile escabeche that you would find at an authentic taco stand just chopped up in salsa form,.  They serve food fast and greasy and good. try the tacos w/cheese, all chili burrito and tamale.

This is another one of those places that everyone just raves about, but I simply can't figure out why. Long lines, indifferent service, flies buzzing all over the tables, and their signature dish, the "taco" is this schmutz of brownish pink stuff, a sprinkling of shredded cheddar cheese, and a wad of chopped lettuce on a shell that could have come from an El Paso box. I even pointed this out to the people I went there with, while they defended their anemic tacos, saying they were "awesome", and that I "just didn't get it". Apparently not.

WAY better than Taco Bell, but not really authentic. I love this place because it's one of those places where memories have been formed. Parking sucks during lunch and dinner time. But after 3 shredded beef tacos with cheese, you can't complain. The salsa and chips are good too, kinda watered down and not spicy at all (which can be good or bad depending on your taste). And the enchiladas are greasy! Which is why I stick to the tacos here. Awesome place! Love it! Always satisfying and their Pepsi tastes great!

This place is a LA staple, and after a year and a half in LA I finally made it out.  The name says it all.  It's not called Tito's burritos, so make sure you stick to their tacos.   If you're a vegetarian you're out of luck because there really isn't much of a taco option for vegetarians.  They'll let you get bean and cheese burritos, but it's really not worth it.   The prices are amazing, but the lines are always large and they move pretty damn slow.  So overall I would give this place a 3.5.

I have a love/hate relationship with Tito's Tacos. It goes something like this: My friends, knowing that I absolutely adore Mexican food, took me to Tito's this year for my birthday. I had tacos and the bean and cheese burrito. I felt the tacos were greasy and not worth the hype (although I love the crunch of the shell on the taco), the burrito was super mushy (I love a solid burrito, i.e. Chipotle - http://www.yelp.com/biz/…), and their salsa was watery. Mental note to self: don't come back. So you see the hate side. Here's where it gets complicated. I watch a lot of Food Network. Like, A LOT OF FOOD NETWORK. That channel to me is like porn to straight guys. I will never not watch the Food Network (UNLESS it's Rachel Ray - I hate that woman. But I digress...) The problem with the Food Network is that they show these reviews of local food joints. Sometimes, they have a blurb on Tito's Tacos. And since I'm watching it in the middle of the night, I'm starting to get hungry. And of course, what do I do? I drive my car down to Tito's Tacos to get some food because it's on TV! People rave about it on TV! Maybe I was just wrong that first time. Maybe my taste buds were dead that day. Who knows. So I drive to Tito's Tacos. And I order exactly the same thing as I did before, tacos and a burrito. And again, love the taco shell, but it's still greasy as hell. And the salsa is still watery as hell. The burrito is slightly better since I added rice in it this time but not quite worth the trek to get it. Mental note to self: don't come back.

"CHEEEEESE! Hey, didn't we lock you in a dumpster one time?" "Yeah I got out, thanks." Seriously, I wish someone would have locked up the person making it rain cheese on these tacos more than Fat Joe in the club. The tacos are all right, not mind blowing. My friends RAVED about these and went to pick them up when we came over to their place in West LA before a Saturday night out. I tried both the beef taco and the bean and cheese burrito - honestly I liked the bean and cheese burrito better, but is it really that hard to make a good b&c burrito? This may be a "my neighborhood has the best hole in the wall fast food taco stand" kind of thing - and I like my greasy, fatty, and of questionable origin Mexican food - but I've had better. If you're in the area, try it out for yourself, but I wouldn't drive more than fifteen minutes out of the way.

OK, so I used to really really like Tito's, but I was there two weeks ago with my rent-a-Mexican I got for moving, and he liked the tacos and said they were authentic... but here is my list of reasons I was unimpressed... 1) NO Horchata or other aguas frescas 2) Only beef, I'm a chicken gal 3) Slow moving line for no good reason 4) Cash only (I know it's not a reason to not like a place, but I'm ranting here people). 5) Unfriendly staff 6) Staff that doesn't ask if you want extras like guacamole. 7) The Burritto has 3 options meat, beans, and rice... not very adventurous. 8) They charge for for Salsa. 9) Parking is a bitch, even with the lot 10) It's in the ghetto of Culver City practically under a 405 overpass.

I'm afraid to say that I don't have any love for this place.  I had heard a good rec from my brother-in-law and, since it was just a block away from the Travelodge, we walked over. Things didn't get any better from there...  The line moved pretty quickly - multiple people take orders from the same window - and we got our brown cardboard box of food. The taste was non-existent.  I think Taco Bell tacos have better seasoning.  I had hopes, but they were totally dashed.  And what's up with just beef - how about some chicken, carnitas, or whatever?  No horchata.  No *proper* guacamole (green goo only).  C'mon now!!! So, save your money and go elsewhere.

Ok, this place gets one star for nostalgic value and an extra star for the tacky late-night commercials... come on, you know you've seen them! "I love Tito's Tacos, You love Tito's too!" Cheesy, late-night television aside, this place simply doesn't merit the long lines, awful customer service, screaming obese Angelenos, or the ghetto-ness of my old neighborhood in Culver City. Seriously, the ridiculous amounts of processed cheddar cannot mask the overly greasy, ridiculously salty blah-ness of those tacos. As you drive by that line around the block, and wonder if it's worth stopping, save yourself the trouble and take a trip South of the Border to Taco Bell on Sepulveda, all the while knowing that you're better than all of those heifers-sans-tastebuds.

I've never been to a place that's gotten so much buzz, but have absolutely nothing in terms of a saving grace that i'd call edible. The tacos and burritos are terrible.  I don't even know what else to say about them.  They would have tasted better if they Tito's didn't try to flavor them. The guacamole has the consistency of snot and looks like it too.   I hope no one ever goes to this place.  There are far better places to eat.   TIP: If you go to costco and buy the frozen taquitos.  It tastes better.  I promise.

No chicken here, sir--strictly beef tacos.  Ground zero for the mad cow outbreak.  Regardless, Tito's is the king of crispy tacos.  Putting such lame imitations (like Nick's in SF) to shame.  The shredded beef tacos are so crispy, I almost sliced my gums open on the corn shell. Sure it might not be authentic Mexican and is slightly reminiscent of school lunch, but I dig it. Oh and although the outside looks like a mob scene--walk up window ordering system is surprisingly quick and efficient.  Don't be turned off by the crowds.

Stopped by Tito's for super Tacos. I just love these Tacos compliment with their own version of fresh Salas. Famous for their Tacos like Pinks for their Hot dogs. Always crowed and long lines but doesn't matter for me since I love Tito's Taco. My only recommendation for improvement is simply to come up with "Titos Taco Truck"....

What's up with all the haters on yelp?! Tito's is great, don't listen to the negative reviews. Usually places like Tito's that have hundreds of reviews on yelp have a pretty accurate aggregate rating. With Tito's this is not the case. If Tito's food was only 3 star quality then why would the line be massive at all hours of the day? The food is great and the lines prove it. Tacos are cheap and delicious ($1.75). Burritos are even better, but don't get the all meat, it's a bit too much. The meat and bean is $3.90 including tax or $4.50 with cheese. The side refried beans are great to dip the free chips in. The salsa is also good. Don't get the guacamole, it's kind of watery and weird. Never tried the enchiladas, but I hear they're good too. Anyway don't listen to the negative reviews on Yelp. A place this good has to be tried. OH and bring CAAAASH, but not too much, it's cheap.

Fried tacos. Burritos. Enchiladas. Good. Not great. Really, what is so fantastic about fried tacos. Yes, they are extremely better than Jack n the box, but still. No ambience, always a line, and always a party favorite. Their salsa and chili are made using a new recipe. Very good.

Place is a over rated. I come from the "hood" so I'm used to eating better Mexican food at the outdoor taco vendors. I still decided to try this place to see what all the hype was about (not to mention I've seen the 2a ads numerous amount of times) The food was meh. Nothing special about it. I can see why people like it so much: Its unlike any fancy restaurant Mexican food and no one is down to drive to the hood for the REAL STUFF. Prices seem reasonable and you get TONS of tortialla chips with ANYTHING you buy. What I also found to be a rip off was the cheese price. 50 cents more to add cheese to your taco, WHAT THE HELL!!! Other than that, the salsa is something you have to get used to. Its not the best but its also not the worst If you got balls (and maybe a gun lol), head down to South Central LA after dusk for some REAL Mexican fast food. Go to any taco vendor and you will DEFINITELY taste the difference. The ghetto is nothing to be afraid of people!

I actually kept typing "Tit's Tacos" by mistake to review this place, and was knocked off my feet (at first) that no one had reviewed it. "The Pink Taco" kept turning up instead. Whoops, 831 reviews. This place is a cultural landmark. It is thronging with people every time I have been. It is a mixed crowd, a lot of Spanish spoken, people from all walks of life. Some families, some teens, some 30-something's. The salsa is delicious, and so is the rest of the food - chili con carne, tacos, burritos. It's served in a cardboard box with chips thrown on top, which is charming, in its own way. I don't get the negative reviews at all. Go here every chance I get.

I lived nearby and noticed the lines that are always at Tito's, so I thought "hey how can that many people be wrong?" Well... still not sure how they get so many people to come back but this place just isn't very good. Long lines and horrible parking for greasy tacos. It just doesn't make sense to me since there are so many other better Mexican places in the area.

I've been coming to Tito's practically my whole life.  I'm so addicted to it, I have to eat it at least once a week.  If I've had a bad day, all I have to do is drive to Tito's, get out of the car, and let the scent wave of frying oil hit my nose, and all is well with the world.  It's my comfort food. My order is three tacos with cheese.  In college I used to eat six for dinner three times a week, but I guess I'm getting old.  I also order a regular burrito (beef and bean) with cheese for my lunch the next day. People complain about the lines, but I don't mind.  It's entertaining to stand and people watch.  I love it when guys are trying to impress their friends and are all like, "Dude, I come here all the time," and step up to the window and try to order a chicken taco.  There are no chicken tacos.  There are chicken tamales, but no chicken tacos. Important note on ordering etiquette: stand in line, place your order, and then GET OUT OF THE WAY.  There are some people who are either clueless or self-absorbed (this is LA, after all) that stand in front of the window with their five screaming kids or making out with their girlfriends or boyfriends for 10 minutes, blocking other people from ordering and getting their food.  Just remember who you ordered from and step to the side.  Pay when your food is ready, cash only.  ATM out in front. If the world was about to end, I'd want Tito's as my last meal.

Went to titos  again and it was good I ordered two tacos with cheese and a large drink yum. Like in all orders it comes with chip and salsa witch is to die for.. What I enjoy doing is getting a spoon full of salsa and putting it on the taco before I bite and it takes the flavor to another level The only think that still gets to me is that they don't offer refills  on there drinks.... So Your forced to buy anther one  so your forced to limit on  drinking your own soda  so you will not finish it be for  your meal

Tito's Tacos are disgusting. For 6 years I've been saying that I was going to try the infamous Tito's Tacos, and I did last night. BIG MISTAKE. I couldn't get the nasty taste of their squirrel meat out of mouth. Who only serves beef tacos?? no chicken, carne asada, no al pastor, nothing. Just beef. Squirrel beef with no flavor. In a hard shell. And don't ask for sour cream cause they don't have it. This place was BS and i do not recommend it if you have taste buds and like good food. If you'll eat anything, then you're fine.

"So what does a Tito's taco taste like?" Imagine a Burger King taco... ...but good. Thick, dense, crispy corn shell, well-portioned greasy shredded beef, fresh iceberg lettuce for good measure, and shavings of cheddar cheese. I ate one thinking, this is the Tito's taco?  But alas, the only thing better than a Tito's taco is TWO.  And it's true.  Number two confirmed their goodness.  The third one made me a believer.  And munching on the chips all the way home to Camarillo kept me smiling.

Tito's Tacos If you hear the name, then you know the hype. --Pretty much you like it or you don't-- --For goodness sakes they're TACOS!-- Been here a few times whenever I am in the neighborhood, i.e. leaving LAX! The usual routine-- :Parking: Is ALWAYS packed! So I find that we circle around or just sit and wait for a spot to open up.  But after looking at that line and hearing the tummy sing, we resort to finding parking elsewhere :Lines: People from all over, mostly locals like to stand in the long line for a TACO! (I did it), why not? Pretend you are in line waiting for Mr. Toad's Wild Ride! :Payment: CASH ONLY!  (best form of payment) However, there is an ATM literally next to the front counter.  Why not? There's no excuse for not buying a taco. :Taste: For me, this is where I'm stuck in between, "it is good? do I like it? was it worth it? would I go back?" Those questions pop up in my head as I'm biting, chewing and eventually swallowing the taco. Okay, here goes....yes, they are greasy, but hey its a frigging TACO, right?? What do you expect? I don't get why people complain about that. Ohhh...I forgot we live in LA! The meat is eh, not too bad but I think it could use a tad bit more flavor.  It's basic with the shredded lettuce and cheddar cheese.  I do love cheese.  That's a plus for me =).  The salsa is alright. It's pureed and I did like spooning the salsa onto the taco so every bite was more flavorful.  AND it didn't have cilantro lol. One thing that bugged me is the darn guacamole.  I was like wth is this green goop stuff? It was really runny.  It was the first time I've ever added guacamole with my order. It didn't have much flavor, and wished it had some kick.  It looked like pea soup...eww! I will probably go back when I'm in the neighborhood again and feeling like a taco. And yes, I'll probably go back and wait in that line too. Perhaps when I go back a few more times, my rating will change but for now, i'll just keep it in the middle.  It's useful for late night drunken munchies or whatever.

Whenever I suggest making a food run to Tito's Tacos at work, everyone gets excited.  Overall, I am not too impressed by their tacos, but have to admit that I get a craving for them once in a while.  I do have to mentally re-categorize Tito's food as being Mexican - I refer to it as Mexican themed food just like Del Taco or El Torito. There is always a line so you know that they are catering to an existing demand.  The tacos are the hard shelled kind and are composed of seasoned shredded beef, lettuce and cheese.  Without a doubt I think that they are far better than Del Taco or Taco Bell.  You also get a giant scoop of tortilla chips and their homemade salsa.  This also needs to be redefined.  Their definition of salsa is composed of tomatoes that seem like they have been put through a blender with other spices and ingredients such as cilantro and onions.  It is more like a gazpacho to me.  Their beef burritos are filled with tender meat that is simmering in some sauce.  Not too bad.  The tamales were a different story as is the enchilada.  To sum up the flavor of those items, let's just say that it seems like Tito's and Van de Kamp's share the same recipes.   I think that it is the catchy song on Tito's commercials that keep people coming back.

Hmm.  Do I give Tito's 1 star or 5?  5 stars or 1?  It seems that this little dive in Culver City sends people's opinions to the extremes.  Do I also have to detest or worship the joint? I wasn't expecting authentic and it's not.  What it is is pretty cheap and pretty good.  Four tacos, with cheese, and chips and salsa ran about 9 bucks and was plenty for 2 people. No line because we arrived around 10:30 in the morning.  Greasy tacos for a late breakfast?  Sure, whatever, I can handle it. Were they the best tacos ever?  Of course not.  Were they satisfying?  Definitely.  I liked the fresh, crunchy shells and I even liked the plentiful, nuclear-orange totally inauthentic shredded cheddar cheese all over the place.  The chips were fresh and crunchy, too.  The meat is probably cheap crap but it tasted ok to me as part of the overall taco. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here (perhaps the acid test of a truly great find), but if I were in the area again, and wanted something greasy (in a good way), I would come back.

Sorry Tito's. I grew up eating your tacos. For almost 40 years you were the bomb, the best, PRIMO! But, now I see... that you are *sigh* only mediocre. You arose when flimsy hard shells were all we knew. Those were the time of Pup and Taco, and Taco Bell, when they set our standards of Mexican fast-food. Times have changed food has gotten better, more authentic. The competitors have caught up and you have slipped. I've kept you on top because each bite reminded me of days past. Nostalgia and years memories when you really were the best clouded my eyes (and taste buds). Well, I've finally shed those memories. I tasted your enchilada, taco and all meat burrito once again and finally admitted you are ... Meh. Your salsa is still good, a favorite of mine. Because of it I give you 3 stars, you'd be hard pressed to get that otherwise. It is now the only reason why I return. Sorry Tito's but now I'm off to search for a better Taco on the westside.

This place is awesome!  I loved it so much in that I didn't mind waiting for 40 minutes to get my food.

On my way out home from work, I can usually see people lining up around the corner and jam packed inside.  Good luck in find any sort of table, but who cares!... I ate my tacos on the hood of my car just like many others at the side of the road.  Parking will be tough also. Believe me, it's well worth it.

Tito's Tacos are alright.  Sure, this place seems to generate tons of hype, but ya know what, their Tacos are not bad. Yes, the crowd sucks, the parking sucks, the lack of eating area sucks, but once you get your hands on some of Tito's Tacos, it's worth munching.  But they aren't that cheap, at over $2 a piece.  I mean, nowadays you can get dollar tacos at your local fast food joints I remember seeing one of their TV commercials during late night when I was flipping through the channels.  Haha - it was a cheaply done commercial, but it got the message across that people heart Tito's Tacos, and that the only thing better than Tito's Tacos is Two. Which, I guess, is true.

Not really sure how to review this. I tried this place for lunch because I heard they have the best ever 'American style' hard shell tacos.  I arrived slightly after what should have been the lunch hour rush at around 2 and there were still incredibly long lines. I ordered some tacos (of course) and tried the chili con carne.  So the taco meat is shredded beef which is ok, nothing spectacular. In fact this might be the one time where I would've rather had seasoned ground beef then shredded beef.   I left feeling perplexed as to why this place is so popular.

2.5. Don't be fooled.  Tito's is not Mexican food.  There's a certain magic in the combination of diced onions, cilantro, and hot meat.  You will not, however, find this at Tito's.  Tito's is more like the place you go for tacos and burritos when you're in the same mood you'd to go to Pink's for when in the mood for a hot dog. That is to say that Tito's is to Mexican food like Panda Express is to Chinese food.  Or like MacDonald's is to American fare.  Ah ha, now you get it.  That said, everyone needs a little Tito's once in a while.  And it's not like you're supporting "the man" like you are MacDonald's...Tito's only has one location. Yesterday when I went for lunch, the woman at the table with me said that this was her last meal before she started Weight Watchers.  The other man next to me was skeptical, saying she'd be back for more Tito's in no time.  While I couldn't help that his comments weren't very nice and supportive, I also know that every once in a while...?  I jsut need me some Tito's...

Hard-shelled tacos look like they came right off an El Torito/Acupulco combination plate.  Thumbs up from me though.   I was definitely intrigued before I ate a Tito's taco - what is all the hype about this place?   I love tacos, and I heard that this is the Place    Was out in the neighborhood of the WestCyde this past week so I figured I'd give this place a shot since I've seen their commercial on TV and it was only a block from where i was staying.   Went at 11:30 pm on a Tuesday and there was a line of people extending out through the entrance door.   I wondered:  What is so good about this place?     Stood in line and waited for awhile.  The guy standing behind seemed pretty hyped up about being there.  He was rubbing his hands together and saying things outloud like "yeeea!"     I chat with him for a bit.  He tells me he drove all the way over from Pasadena cause he is fiending to eat these tacos - he 'loves' em.     So now i'm more intrigued:   what is really so good about this place?!    Ordered 1 taco.  It's late and I know I'm about to eat an artery clogger.   The guy behind me states outloud: 'dude, you'll be hurting! you better get more."       Damn, alright.   Ordered 2 tacos.     Get the tacos.  Go back to hotel room.  Unwrap tacos.  what's this El Torito combination plate shit??      Gotta give it up though for Tito though:   that was the freshest, crunchiest shell I've ever bitten into. Comes with some watery salsa - use superflously on every bite.  whoops!  spilled some greasy shredded beef oil all over the Ramada Inn comforter.   oh wells.  Finished tacos.  Question not answered yet.   What is so good about this place anyways?

Why is there always a line out front?? Is this place famous? Oh, the food must be really good. All thoughts that run through my head every time I drive down Washington. Well people, I now have answers. The lines are long because everyone just piles in front of a window and shouts what they want, waiting in the same spot for the food to come out, and then dig for cash while they manually add up your total. Heard of an assembly line? The food is mediocre at best.. taco, eh... enchiladas, eh... tamale, eh... rice, eh... and so on. However, the prices are really cheap. I probably won't come back here and don't think it's worth it but if you're like me, you'll want to try it yourself. At least it won't cost you much.

This place kinda reminds me of In-N-Out.  The first time you go there, you are astonished.  Maybe it's the hype, the menu's simplicity, the ever-long but fast moving lines, the not-that-unique, but somehow satisfying food. You're just so hungry, and it's just so good.  Not great.  Just good.  Hipsters and food-snobs poo-poo it.  But there's something about it.  Maybe they put crack in the food.

I'm sorry Tito's but I am not a fan of your tacos... After a long anticipated date with these infamous taco's, we arrived at this establishment hopeful.  Upon entering the restaurant, i was quite concerned with the health grade here.  Thankfully it was an "A" though it doesn't seem like it by the looks of it. Line was pretty long, full of older white people.  I perused through the seated area just to see what everyone else was eating, mostly the hard shell tacos and what I could make out as chili I think.   Anyway, to get to the point, the meat in the taco's wasn't at all tasty and unflavored. Wayyy too much cheese for me.. I am a huge fan of cheese, but way to much for me.  I felt like I was literally eating a taco shell with cheese since the meat and everything else was not flavorful.  I do like that they give you chips and salsa complimentary.  Oh jesus, and the tamales. Don't get them. It tasted mushy but with no flavor. I guess the good thing is that they probably don't use that much salt, or any other seasoning for that matter.  I'm gonna stick to 99 cent jack in the box taco's from now on.

So supposedly these are some of the best tacos in LA - wrong! I seriously believe that any mom and pop taco joint in the city, even if it's served out of a truck or stand, is way better than the "taco" here. Also, the wait sucks and it's a crowded mofo. The only good thing I remember is the tamales, or were they enchiladas?

Contrary to their catchy song which advertises, "the only thing better than a Tito's tacos is two." I could have gone my whole life without ever eating one of these tacos. Do not get me wrong reader.....I've given Tito's Tacos the old college try at least five times and that's five times too many. So, if you are going to check it out, be aware that parking is limited. You should be able to find parking on Washington Place at the meters with not too much trouble. Be prepared to wait in a long line (like a ride shorter than Disneyland but longer than Knotts Berry Farm) to order your food. Also, be ready to wait for your food. People that eat at Tito's tend to buy tacos in bulk. Though, the food takes less time coming out than you spent waiting in line to order. Speaking of food - the tacos are tasteless. I've tried them time and time again (five times to be exact), hoping that I would see in them what is so amazing and I can't taste it at all. If they didn't have cheese on them, they would be miserable. The chips are just chips and I don't care for their salsa. On one occasion, I did venture out and had a chicken enchilada.

Perhaps I have a naive Nor Cal palate, but I wasn't thoroughly impressed with this place as it was on my way back to SF on a late Sunday night, where we picked this place as it was close to a freeway along with the low prices for decent sized grub. The burritos were decent sized, but heavy on meat and beans, yet light on taste and quality.  Overall, I left full, so that's what mattered the most that night. I will admit this place has it's cult following with a line at their takeout windows still ordering food at 9pm on a Sunday, though my experience didn't echo theirs apparently.

I'm still on what is turning into a never-ending quest to find a good Mexican place in LA near me.  My latest attempt landed me at Tito's Tacos.  Some people, including LA natives, swear Tito's is the place to go.  And they have this wonderful commercial with a catchy song. When I got there, the building looked sufficiently "hole-in-the-wall"-ish and there was a line.  The set up was like a large taco stand.  You went up to a window, placed your order and sat at one of the few picnic style tables outside.  Promising...  I looked around for the menu which turned out to be a large board behind the counter with only a few listings.  Hrm...  I see "burrito" and the only options were beans, meat w/ beans and...that's it?  What sort of meat?  Shredded beef?  No carne asada?!?!?!  Well, damn...there goes my hopes and dreams. I ordered a meat burrito but without the beans; I'm a believer in the carne asada + guacamole + cheese + pico de gallo burrito.  None of that rice n' beans filler stuff.  I want MEAT!   I also ordered 2 tacos for my husband, plain with just meat n' cheese.  Since they only accept cash at Tito's Tacos, I had to make use of the atm machine on the side of the building.   I waited for about 5 minutes before my order was called.  I paid ($9 + change) and got my food which was packaged in a box (think In-n-Out) with a cover. When I got home and opened up the box, I saw a fairly plump burrito, two very sad looking tacos, chips and a cup of salsa. I didn't try the tacos but the husband said they weren't very good and that he would be fine if he never ate them again.  Taco Bell has better. As for the burrito, it was stuffed full of shredded beef and some cheese but it was bland.  I kept throwing more and more Tapatio just to get some flavor.  It really was unappetizing and I had to force myself to finish it ("Thou shalt not waste food...").  The amount of meat in it was...heavy, almost bordering on too much.  It is a filling burrito and if there was something for my taste buds to latch on to, it would have been okay. I guess the best part of the meal were the chips which were a little stale and the very mild salsa.  I should have dumped the salsa into the burrito... I don't understand how people think Tito's Tacos is great.  What am I missing?  This was probably the worst Mexican food I've ever had and I doubt I will return. The fact that I dished out almost $10 for it just adds salt to the wound. For the first time ever, the Catty Critic gives out a hairball rating.  I wish Yelp allowed 0 stars cuz that's what I really want to give Tito's Tacos. Now to convince the husband that, no, we really should move back to San Diego, if only so I can get GOOD Mexican food again...

The only thing worst than a tito's taco, is two! I've been here twice. The first time I came here was to check out what the big deal was all about since I always saw huge lines when I drove by. The 2nd time I came here was to confirm my findings from the first visit, which was that this place is horrible! The tacos here are just bad. The shells have a stale crunch to them and the shredded beef has no flavor. The salsa was basically tomato water. And 50 cents extra for cheese? When did tacos not come automatically equipped with cheese? For the price, I would rather go to Jack in the Box and get 4 times the food with a hundred times the flavor. If you're curious about this place, don't be. There are soo many more great Mexican food joints in the area (Cinco de Mayo next door for one). Wish I could give zero stars...seriously. I know, the one star is for the great jingle. "the only thing better than a tito's Taco, is two" - LIES!

Been eating here since I was 12, that's 28 years!!  It is not your average Mexican food, definitely different from the Americanized Taco Bell.  Ironically, my favorite item here is the meat burrito, not the taco.  Their tacos are just OK.  The meat in the burrito, however, is the star.  I have just started getting their beef chili bowl (carne asada chili bowl I think), which is essentially the meat that is used in the burrito.  Mix in their homemade salsa directly into the chili and use their chips to dip and I'm a happy mamacita. Lines are notoriously long, it's always been that way.  Expect at least 10- to 15 minutes, if not more, to make it to the front of the line. Don't come here if you are in a rush.  Be sure to get an extra-large salsa and an extra order of chips.  The salsa is simple, but very unique to Tito's Tacos, as well as fresh and delicious.

Hey, it's a local place where the food may be different then other mexican restaurants but that's what makes it unique and soooo good. I guess I've been eating here so long that I may be bias but nothing has changed over the years with the quality of the food, still as good and the first time I had all meat burrito and taco with cheese! The quantity however has gotten smaller over the years just like everywhere else so I can't fault them for that.

I'm not sure why people love this place-- perhaps I don't like it much because I've never been a HUGE fan of hard shelled tacos, but even with that, I've tried their burritos before, and haven't been too impressed.  I didn't like the fact that I had to wait on line for ever, when service could definitely be much faster and more efficient.  Seriously not that great... I'd rather try out some of the taco stands in East LA, or even go to Chipotle and get some soft tacos there.  Heck, even chicken soft tacos at Del Taco is a better play with my money.

BF used to live near here and there were tons of people in line when we were driving by so we stopped to try some tacos.  $1.65 per taco.  The lines were really long.  It was like an amusement park.  Parking lot was full.  We had to park at the next block across the street.   I don't know what the big deal is.  The taco shells are like stale tortilla chips and thick too!  Beef was stringy.  Ew.  Would never eat here again.

I've heard about this place, but I've been until today.  I knew that the lines are long here, and there was a decent sized crowd today.  However (from my visit), Tito's Tacos seems well-equipped to handle big crowds.  They have a pretty decent sized parking lot.  In addition, there are a lot of tables inside as well as a few outside.  They have many open cashier windows so lines are short and move fast (unlike the Kogi truck where it is one long, unending line). In terms of their food, it was kind of hard to see their menu.  Their menu was also not that descriptive, but I went with something I heard others get.  I got two beef tacos with cheese (it also includes chips) and a Pepsi for about $6. The beef tacos are served on hard, crunchy corn shells.  The beef is topped with shredded iceberg lettuce and shredded cheddar cheese.  You can also pour their mild salsa on top.  The shredded beef was quite gray (not too appetizing to look at).  It was okay, but it didn't have much character (bland with no kick).  The salsa helped. The corn chips were very thick and hearty.  They were okay.  Overall, the food was cheap, and it sure beats the hard tacos you will find at Taco Bell or Del Taco.  I'm not sure if I'll come back in the future, but I'm glad I came, and Tito's Tacos is not a bad place to go if you are looking for a hard taco fix.

Wow, Tito's appears to be quite the divisive issue!   When I first had Tito's, I hated it.  But I think we got off on the wrong foot.  I was new to the westside, and one of my (Mexican) friends took me to this place that had the "best" tacos.  I was expecting tacos like those from a taco trunk... soft corn tortilla, onions, cilantro, spicy salsa, a selection of meats, and radish & lime on the side.  When I saw the menu, I was horrified.  Cheddar cheese on a taco??  wtf.  and the salsa tasted like blended tomatoes.  If that was my only experience with Tito's, I'd have written a scathing review and that would have been the end of it. But, fortunately, I ate the tacos a few more times over the years because others served them in their homes and I didn't want to be rude.  Once I accepted Tito's for what it is, I really liked it.  It is not authentic Mexican food, so don't expect authentic Mexican food.  I guess I would say to expect a fast food 'version of' Mexican food.  I love drenching the tacos in Tito's "guacamole," which is really a watery avocado sauce that has an appealing flavor, and their salsa, which is mild for my tastes but really fresh. The meat and bean burrito is also really good.  The meat is not carne asada.  Rather it's chunk/shredded beef, like that in chile colorado.  but it's good.  And the flour tortilla is soft and delicious.   that's about all I order from Tito's, and I highly recommend both.  see if they grow on you.  and you won't be settling, you'll just be more open-minded.  lol. ps.  I heard (***possibly a rumor***) that Tito's is not owned/operated by Mexicans.  So don't expect authentic Mexican food!  haha.  no, really. pss.  Tito's is not representative of Mexican food in L.A.  Enough with the regional chest thumping.  Get out and about in L.A. more.

Of course I love Tito's Tacos, and you'll love Tito's too.  I don't know what people expect when they come here but ever since my first bite about 5 years ago I have been a loyal customer! The lines are long, yes. But since the recession the lines have been a teeny bit shorter.  Good for me, but bad for business... ANYWAY The cheese is so delicious and the tacos are nice and crispy.  The salsa is just tomato and some cilantro but it's pureed really well and it's not spicy at all.  They have some jalapeno type salsa too that is also mild but adds a nice flavor.  I love the rice here.  And the beef, bean, and cheese burrito is to die for! I love Tito's Tacos, and you should love Tito's too! Cash only, and pay attention to where you are and who takes your order.  They take your order, prepare your food, and come back to the window for payment.  Go inside for faster service!  And go in pairs or more...have someone scouting out a table while you're waiting in line.  Maybe take your iphone or nintendo DS to have something to do while waiting hahaha

I am not a usual customer but every time I drive by Culver City I have to stop by & get me some taco's. My kids prefer the burritos (which I think are rather good) Now I am Mexican & I can tell you this isnt true mexican food but they are rather good.  The only bad thing is standing in that long line to get your food, but obviously if there are long lines then that tells you they have many fans. The prices are not that cheap, they are not an upgrade from Jack N The Box Tacos, completely different.  Also I dont believe its groundbeef, they are more like shredded beef (cant quite figure it out, scary) but they are good.

We were driving around LA and midway through we decided to stop by Tito's Tacos for lunch. The place was an absolute zoo; there were lines of people waiting both outside and inside, the staff was hectically throwing together all sorts of dishes, and people were pouncing on tables as soon as someone finished their last chip. And, oh man, the parking situation was insane. We had to jump out and wait on line while the driver waited 15 minutes to get a spot. Ouch. Anyway, was it all worth it? I really thought it was. First of all, the food was a steal. It was like $6 or $7 a person for a massive amount of good old fashioned Mexican food. We got the enchilada's and taco's and they threw in some tortilla chips and salsa for free. Everything was great! I wish they had some sort of spicy salsa or something since everything was so mild, but maybe I just missed it in the middle of the madness. Crazy line and parking, but worth the wait for the food.

3 stars you gotta be kidding me?! This place brings be back to the days as a bruin looking for cheap eats around the west side. This place is simple, Mexican food that is fresh and delicious. It's not fancy, but the food is good, it can get crowded, but it's Tito's - you have to expect that. Their salsa is awesome and the chips are great! I usually will get a medium side of chips because they are even great the day after. The price isn't that steep, and the people their are friendly even when the clientele are restless from the lines. Maybe the stars went down because the expectations are so high, but to me the bargain of the food along with the simple great taste keep this place at four stars. Tito's is still one of my favorite taco joints in the LA area.

I dragged my sister and 3-yr old here one day because of the great reviews and decided it sounded like it was worth the line.  i should have known better when the woman in front of me in line, who overheard me saying it was my first time, said, "oh you will love it! it is way better than taco bell!"  if you, like this woman, use Taco Bell as your standard to judge tacos, then stop reading; my review will not be helpful to you. BUT, if you recognize that Taco Bell has no place in a discussion of good tacos, then you might find it helpful for me to report that YOU SHOULD STAY AWAY!  Unsalted and stale hard taco shells, tasteless meat, and bad salsa.  We all left totally confused why this place is so loved....

When I lived down in Santa Monica, I'd constantly hear about Tito's Tacos. People would ask me if I'd been there, did I love it, etc. So I finally ambled down to Culver City, and... eh. The tacos are good, but they're nothing to write home about. In fact, until now, I've never felt the need to write about Tito's Tacos before. I'm most surprised that so many people share my point of view. I thought I was the only one unmoved. So why is there always a long line?

I love Tito' Tacos, you love Titos' too. I love Tito's Tacos, what else can you do? The only thing better than a Tito's Taco is two!! Good tacos.  2 bucks for a beef taco with cheese.  Salsa is super yummy but on the watery side.  The chips are good.  There's something about the beef that is just really, really delicious and distinct. Parking is tough in the little lot so your best bet is to try to find metered parking on the street.  There are plenty of spaces right under the freeway.   The line is super long, but it's quick.  And you get your meal relatively fast too.  Outdoor seating on the patio tables is the best, but there are only 3 tables, and they're usually packed.  You kind of have to be one of those table vultures and swoop in immediately after someone leaves.  The indoor seating isn't as nice.   I recommend it.  I would imagine this place would be particularly yummy after a night or afternoon of drinking.  It's nothing fancy, but surely hits the spot.

Tito's Tacos... Es-Okay, Esé! Many have ranked Tito's Tacos as being the best taco joint in LA, but we fellow Yelper's know better, which is why we've given Tito's a three star average. Tito's Tacos is an over-rated, mediocre taco joint, known for its comforting, but greasy tacos. A deep fried tortilla shell, topped with meat, mounds of cheese and lettuce. Grease oozing from every pore of the taco shell, turning the taco into a soggy mess that you have to quickly ingest  before the shell splits open. Tito's is greasy comfort but I prefer a taqueria or even a Tijuana taco stand that makes you three al pastor corn tortilla tacos. Served with homemade salsa, cilantro, onions and lime juice. Relish the tacos with a radish and I'm good. Give me a cold Corona and I'm even better. Sorry, Tito's, but a dexterous Tijuana taco maker can run circles around your deep fried cheesy tacos. Simón.

1 star. Brutally unsatisfying food and the long lines make Tito's Tacos "all hype and no substance." Often touted as a "L.A. institution" or a "must try" by TV features and fellow yelpers alike, I found nothing remarkable from my visit to Tito's, save perhaps low prices. In fact, the tacos and burritos have an "institutional" taste --much like bad cafeteria food-- and the beans are undistinguishable from made-for-restaurant canned beans. Even with the low prices, why throw money away when there are so many other options around? Verdict: Just not my cup of tea... To each his/her own... Try it if you must, but I honestly cannot recommend.

Crispy delicious taco goodness, more akin to San Antonio style "Puffy Tacos" than the taco truck goodness L.A. is known for.  Shredded beef, cheese , fresh salsa on tacos, yum. Good chili too goes in their burritos for an odd but pleasing combination. The chips and salsa are the icing on this cookie. THe line moves quicker than you's think. Except  during lunch hours. There is always a line. Don't be disuaded. Feel free to share seating with total strangers, few of them will care.

I think it's a conspiracy. This place was made as a diversion to keep all the Gringos away from the good Mexican restaurants. That way people who know where to get good Mexican food won't have to wait in line outside like the lost souls who inhabit this place. Maybe 30 years ago when there weren't a lot of Mexican restaurants around this was probably the place to go. But with so many other  Mexican restaurants around that have much better food to offer I just can't in my right mind understand how this place is so popular.

I just had my second go at Tito's after a 9 year hiatus and now I know why I've never gone back since: The food sucks. The burritos are exactly what you'd find on sale for 10/$10 at Ralphs in the frozen food section, except it's fresh and you waited 45 mins to get it. For all of you who love this place and claim to love Mexican food, shame on you.

Still Good, But It's Glory Days Are Long Past. I really wish I could take half a star back... giving them three stars is a little generous. When I first started going to Tito's back in the late 70's, they also had one in Anaheim. Back in the day, everything was hotter, fresher, the service was fast, all the checkout positions were open. Fortunately, Tito's hasn't gotten as bad as most other joints that earn some presumed and over-rated "cult" following, but if I'm being honest, they are headed that way. Personally speaking, I ust don't think the place is the holy grail that some people want to believe it is. Having said that, I have enjoyed many a lunch or late dinner... usually two tacos and a all-meat burrito, as recently as last week. But where I used to make the trip specifically to go to Tito's every week, I now might make it there once a month or so IF I happen to be in the area. If you take away the hype and take it at face value, there is a good chance you'll like Titos. Otherwise, you may be in for a letdown.

Wow. I felt compelled to write a re-view/commentary/rebutal after reading the few out there. I look at restaurants and movies the same way. I judge the experience based on the genre. When I go to see an action movie, I go to see the action. I don't focus on the plot holes big enough to drive a truck through, or judge the writers use of cliches. (like the one I just used.) When I see a character driven film, I am more deserning and critical. I feel catagories are necessary when comparing. I request when using another restaurant as a point of refrence, use an appropriate and similar comparison. Titos is fast food, yet it is not a franchised chain restaurant.  What are you expecting? If you want authentic Baja style carne asada taco's you are at the wrong place. ( go to the truck parked outside of Von's on Alvarado, just North of Sunset, usually every evening after 7p.m.) And to the reviewer who asked what kind of meat is in their taco? If it's not stated on the menu, I would not ask. I am not saying any of you are wrong or not entitled to your opinion. I would suggest when reviewing a restaurant, adjust your criteria depending on the type of place you are reviewing. Eventhough I ate too much of it as a walking meal when I was a p.a. back in the early 90's shooting at Culver Studios. (Joe Pytka's favorite late night meal, or so it seemed, because we ate it so frequently.)  I like it for what it is, a greasy, Mexican food inspired, Southern California Taco Stand. The chicken tamale, (hold the sauce they serve with it.) and the taco are my favorite with a medium root beer and a side of guacamole please. Oh, and for my fellow Bay Area sister, lettuce on a burrito? I don't think they do that at any burrito place on Mission St.? I pose this question to all my fellow Yelpers. What is your favorite, non-chain deep-fried Taco? Peace in pursuit of tasty food everywhere. (p.s. Johnnies Pastami rocks! Review to follow.)

I've tried the beef tacos, bean cheese burrito, tamales, and chips and salsa.  The best thing was probably the beef tamale and that's not saying too much.  Everything else was...meeehhhh....Greasy and dry.  The shells/chips are too hard for my taste and everything lacked flavor. The salsa looked and tasted more like a blended tomato smoothie. The line is usually out the door.  Not worth it for me though, I've definitely had better.  Any taco truck on a corner or Taco Bell is better.

"Tito's Taco's is a Los Angeles mainstay. Offering a unique, economic and flavorful take on Mexican comfort food. Simply said the food is addictive..." I LOVE TITO'S!!! I have been going here on my way to and from Venice Beach for over 10 years, and have recommended this place dozens of times to my budget minded dining buddies. If you plan on going here with the mindset of experiencing 'fine mexi-cali cuisine' than you're going to the wrong place. But if you are an avid 'comfort foodie' like myself, who is always questing for the next great 'greasy spoon', this is right up your alley. Tito's menu is short and sweet, Tacos, Burritos, Tostadas, and Enchiladas. Sides of Rice and beans are available, along with chips and homemade salsa. The first thing you'll notice (after the line out the door) is the low-to-the-floor prices. You can easily fill up for under $8 and have left overs to boot. The tacos are crispy-fried and filled with shredded beef, lettuce and cheese. Doesn't sound like much for the palate eh? WRONG! The Beef is tender and seasoned nicely, and the hand-grated cheddar and ultra-crispy shell are unlike ANY other taco joint I've eaten at, and there have been many. My personal fave is the Enchilada, I usually order 2 of 'em but can never finish, yes they are that filling. The sauce that smothers these sinful delicacies and the texture of the homemade tortillas and cheese is what leaves a lasting impression. The burritos are also equally memorable, with big pieces of tender beef marinated in a red mole sauce, beans and rice. They are tasty enough to satisfy burrito purists, and big enough to feed the 'bear' in your family. All orders served with Chips and Homemade salsa :) The dining room has been heavily congested nearly every time I've come here, so be prepared for a wait to order. There is outdoor seating and indoor tables, neither offer a very comfortable or immaculate setting, but with this place it's all about THE FOOD! Nay sayers can say 'nay' all they want, that just means one less person in the long line at Tito's Taco's. Thanks! OK Seriously, try it out. It's a legend in the city. Just ask the patrons waiting in line with you, "Is it worth it?"..."Hell yeah!" will most likely be the response. Comer Bien! And Yelp on my friends....

If you like deep fried tacos, (think Jack in the Box only with better cheese) then you'll like this place. Only tasty thing was meat & bean burrito. Rice was bland as was the salsa. Tamales from Trader Joe's freezer section are much better than their beef tamales.

It gets 3 stars for being "an establishment" of LA, but 2 stars for food.  My sister's boyfriend has to have this everytime he comes back to visit, and raves about it.  Then again, he grew up in LA, so I guess it was the late night thing to do when he was a teenager (they're open until 11 or something). The line moves quickly, there's plenty of parking, and it is cheap.  However, the tacos are so-so, and it isn't very good chedder cheese if it is in fact cheese (I'm a stickler for good cheese). Go there once, but no need to go back.

Okay, here's the deal with Tito's. If you're over 25 and didn't grow up eating Tito's Tacos, chances are you're not going to like their food. Don't go there expecting the greatest Mexican food you've ever tasted, and don't try to compare it to any other Mexican restaurant. It's Tito's Tacos -- a food group all by itself. The owner -- not a Mexican, never has been. Just enjoy it for what it is -- a good cheap meal.

Like many others, after hearing people RAVE about the tacos and salsa, and after 2 years of driving past and seeing hoards of people in line, I gave it a shot.  If people are always in line, it must be good.  Right??  Then I found myself in line.   Salsa?  Blended tomatoes and onion.  Worst salsa ever, if you can even call it salsa.  Oily tacos that come with a dose of cheese for an exrta dollar.  I didn't even finish them.  The taco shells tasted like plastic.   But I thought, you know what, maybe the tacos just aren't my thing.  I've gone back 3 times, trying different stuff every time and was even more disappointed.   Worst Enchilada I've ever come across.   Or maybe this is just what "authentic" Mexican food tastes like.  I'll stick with Tortilla Grill for my burritos. ????

I just realized that I had embarked on an "OG Tastes of LA" series of reviews and omitted an LA staple, Tito's Tacos, which is actually right around the corner from another, previously-reviewed establishment, Johnny's Pastrami. Upon your arrival, you will instantly know that you are in the right place because the joint is packed, there are lines at the windows, and parking is a mess.  This is a good sign. I dined there recently after a UCLA basketball game, and let me just say that any restaurant that can bowl you over with something as simple and sinful as a bean and cheese burrito has to be shared!  My recommendation is to go there and try as much stuff as you can, just to get a feel for the place.  The tacos are simple, perhaps more anglicized  than other more authentic places, but they are crunchy pockets of greasy goodness, with just enough shredded lettuce to help you trick yourself that what you are eating isn't really all that bad for you.  It is, but you'll live (at least through a few tacos I would think). In short, Tito's is as much an LA culinary gem as The Apple Pan, Philippe's, or Pie 'n Burger, and while it may not be quite as long-lived as those fine establishments, it fills a comfort food niche that is just as important.

I went to Tito's Taco for the first time and I thought it wasn't too bad. The tacos are fairly priced for their size at $1.75 per taco...60 cents extra if you want cheese on it. The taco honestly reminded me of a Jack-in-the-Box taco, but with real meat instead of taco filling. I also thought the chips that came along with the meal was complementing. All in all, the tacos are pretty much average and is not as good as people deem it to be. It is a  little bit over-hyped and somewhat Americanized if you really want real Mexican tacos. By the way, it's CASH ONLY.

Allot people talk shit about Tito's. There is always a line so some people must like it. I have been eating here for over 25 years. Even though I don't live in the west side anymore anytime that we come back from LAX or traffic isn't bad we go to this Los Angeles institution. They have great tacos and cheese enchiladas. Even though not my favorite, the burritos are also good. It's not authentic Mexican food, but is dam good.

OMG...every time I drive by Tito's and see the long lines I actually feel irritated. Why? Because this is by far the most over-hyped Taco stand I've ever encountered. First of all, ground beef tacos? wtf? Second, where is the chicken? Third, just because it's greasy and drenched in cheese does not mean it's good - well I'm thinking many of you would disagree with that but I'm not going to subject myself to grease without flavor. I came to Tito's when I moved to CC hoping to find that goldmine of a taco joint near home, but was utterly disappointed. That's why I drive 40 mins to get my taco fix at Alerto's in Fountain Valley - yup, for real.

Tito's Tacos has earned a reputation as one of the great landmark eats in Southern California. The Taco itself shouldn't be noted for it's flavor and goodness but rather, for it's authenticity as there is no Taco like it (to my knowledge) in California. Cheap, crunchy, scrumptious and it hits the spot whenever you feel the urge for it. The long line is representative of the success of this glorified Taco Stand. To be fair, my first encounter with this taco hit was not what I expected. The meat was dry, the taco was a tad stale. The side of guacamole wasn't the best I've ever had, nor did this place make me want to go back for more... EVER. However, despite the less than stellar review I have to offer for this place, it is a must go atleast once. You either love it, or you hate it. It's so distinct and unique in creation of a Taco, it's no wonder that Tito added his name in front of it.

Tacos- they use ground beef and ground pork. Tasty and moist. I usually order a "to go" because it's always crowded. Faster to get your food and go to a close park or something. With the tacos is the taco sauce; side guacamole and they give you a handful of tortilla chips as well. Priced right. Clean for the most part and they do have their ordering system down packed. With the many taco stands in the area, this place is worth the hassle to park, wait in line and get your food. (by the way, you can park on the street, Washington Pl, under the freeway viaduct. Much easier than going round and round in the parking area...

I think Titos is a place that Angelenos feel like they have to love, like Pink's Hot Dogs. It almost feels taboo to hate places like these. I'm OK with it being a part of the Los Angeles culture, but I am not OK with people saying that the food is "the best" when it clearly isn't. Besides Tito's corny commercials that no one can ever avert their eyes from, there isn't much to look forward to at Tito's as far as authentic Mexican food. From what I read in previous reviews, Tito's is beginning to take pride in being un-authentic, which makes no sense to me. My theory is, if there IS authentic Mexican food so close-by (Helloooo we live in LA!!!), then why wouldn't you get authentic Mexican food? Some may argue that it's because Tito's is cheap, well, I counter that with "What authentic taco truck or mom & pop Mexican restaurant have you ever been to that is expensive?" $0.80 cent, flame-roasted al pastor tacos con cebollitas down the way guys! Follow me! Anyway, the things I don't like about Tito's is their guacamole that has been injected with an acidic fruit to live longer in the bags they defrosted in, their dry beans, their gorge of un-melted cheddar cheese on top of tacos and their stale tortilla chips. I've been here enough times as well as at normal and odd hours to know that I wasn't there on a bad day. Parking trouble never gives us good start either.

I don't understand how this place only has three stars. I see comments about the tacos consisting of meat, lettuce and cheese...I don't know what you expect, truffle shavings and caviar? Seriously. this place rules. The price is super cheap which is hard to find in LA, there's almost always a line which sucks, but they can't help how popular they are because they offer a great value and delicious food. I was personally wondering why there was such hype behind the place, but I think that it is in the shells and chips, hardest taco I've ever eaten which typically is bad at most restaurants but I loved it here, they just use really thick corn tortillas, I guess and I think it's great. The only thing I do not like about this place is that they don't have coke products, I like a coke with a taco, but they only offer disgusting pepsi, I'd four star it for that reason except that they def don't deserve three stars and so I'm hoping my five stars will help to boost them a bit :)

According to what my parents claim, I've been eating here since before I was born... I know, I know--it's not even close to being authentic Mexican food, but it's different and I like it. In the 27 years of my existence, I still haven't tried everything on their menu... I like to stick with the chips, salsa/guacamole, tacos and burritos (bean & cheese or meat & cheese). One of the many greasy spoons in Los Angeles that everyone must try at least once.

The best tacos ever.  During busy times, you have to circle a lot of find parking and lines are long. But totally worth it! Or go during weekdays. Just get the tacos. The burritos are good too, but the tacos (with or without cheese) are the best. Everything has beef.  Recently they added a chicken tamale, but this place is not for veggies or non-beef eaters.

My brother's family (visiting me in Culver City from Ohio) insisted we go to Tito's (cause, ya know, it's one of Rachel Ray's favorite places). After driving all the way to Los Feliz for Yuca's only to find they were not open, I gave in. Tito's had too many people and not enough selection (if you are a vegetarian and lactose intolerant like me, you can have some beans, but that's about it). I wished I had taken them to Poquito Mas instead (yes, Poquito Mas is Cal-Mex so maybe the comparison is unfair, but Tito just didn't do it for me).

Tito's Tacos are the BEST!!!! That's what I kept hearing. You have to try them! People gushed.... I'd never had the opportunity, was definitely intrigued. So turns out I'm in LA last week. Just got a thai massage and I'm feelin the rumble down under... gotta feed the beast!! But where the hell am I? Culver City???? What's in Culver City?!?!?  Someone mentions Tito's Taco's, I'm so down!!! So we get there and my anticipation beings to build. OMG, EACH of the 3 lines has 20 people in it! Oh the sweet agony! That surely must mean that the taco's are worth it, no? The minutes pass like hours... 20 minutes and we're only halfway there.... Who can complain when the Americanized Pseudo Mexican Crunchy taco goodness awaits? Not I! So, the moment finally arrives and we place our order. My mouth is salivating now... openly... seriously, I'm drooling a little. WHY did the cashier dissappear??? Is it break time??? I need food, now! SWEET HAY SOOS.. thats Jesus for the Nor Cal folk... they finally give me my box of goodness. I Run to the car(cause the seating was non existent) and tear open the box. I grab a taco and take 1 unadorned bite... hmmm.... reminds me of a Jack In the Box taco. Is this what all the fuss was about? Don't get me wrong... I USED to love Jack in the Box tacos, before I got on a health kick. Sure the meat's better than JITB, and so is the cheese, but I see a familiarity there too strong to ignore. I give it 4 stars because I love JITB tacos and i would give them 4 stars. I would actually give Tito's 4.5 stars if I could. And when I use fractions I typically round up or down. The .5 star gets taken awat because nobody should wait that long for a glorified JITB taco. Would I go back? Sure, If it doesn't take me 30 minutes to get there and 40 minutes to wait in line.

Titos Tacos is Ok.  Cheap food that doesn't taste too bad.  The problem is the long wait, which makes eating elsewhere more desirable. Food: Not bad.   You get free chips and salsa with your order. Chips and taco shells are pretty greasy.  But the meat is pretty good.   The taco shells are a bit tough for my teeth.  I would prefer tacos that crumble beautifully into my mouth when i bite into it -- rather than a giant, sharp, hard piece of shell poking my mouth, failing to break under the pressure of my molars.   Price: Very cheap food.  $1.60 for a taco (eat about 2-3 tacos).   Burritos are $4.  You can get enough food for 2 people for $15 bucks. Service: Um.. what service?   The lines move very slow, because fat pudgy women with short legs inch their way around the kitchen gathering your food, inch back to give you the food, then inch back to the cash register, then inch back to you to give you your change.  It's too painful to watch. Seat yourself at a crumby, greasy table, that is.. if you can find one available. Other: The way to order your food is very confusing: 1. Wait in a line, and hope that.. you are actually in line. 2. Read the menu board (that doesn't really look like a menu)  with random prices floating around the board.  I love how the menu does not even indicate what type of meat goes into your food. 3. Make your order to the lady at the counter.   there are always people always hanging around at the counter too. 4. The lady will write down your order and disappear.  You will stand there confused.  Wait on the side with the other people standing by the counter. 5. Then the lady returns, she will miraculously  remember your face (among the crowd of 50 other people) and hand your your food. 6. Hand over your cash (this place is cash only).  The lady will disappear again. 7. Stand around awkward and wait for your change. 8. Good luck finding a seat to eat your food.

Fast.  Decent.  Cheap.   Really, this isn't a place where you should expect a taco miracle to happen, but it is better than Taco Bell, and I think it is actually cheaper or as cheap, so there you go.  The food totally comes in weird little cardboard boxes like little kid meals, and the enchiladas are my favorite - I could do without their tacos, but the enchiladas are drenched in sauce and they're tasty. I go here once in a while when I'm craving really bad-for-me food.

I used to live in Culver City when I went to UCLA back in the late 90s. I remembered Tito's wasn't very good back then, but I thought maybe my tastes have changed. The truth is, Tito's has nothing on Jack in the Box tacos. Which isn't saying much, but I'd rather eat the Jack tacos any day over Tito's. Tito's uses boiled, musty meat in a break your grandfather's teeth shell. It doesn't have good flavor, it doesn't smell good, it doesn't have good texture, it's a failure on all possible fronts. I didn't remember seeing Chili Con Carne back in my days at UCLA so I opted for a cup of it. Tasted like they transferred that musty meat into a sauce of tomato and cumin and tried to pass it off as chili. It came with some tortilla chips that were greasy and hard enough to pry open a jail cell. Also you get a small container of blended salsa, which was actually the only tasty thing in my whole meal. If you appreciate good food, this place will disappoint. If you appreciate food that's completely unauthentic and so poorly done that it tastes great, this place still isn't for you. This is a place for fierce followers like Apple fanatics... I'll just leave it at that.

You know a place is legit when, at any given time, there is a line around the block to get service: Tito's Tacos is such a place. Tito's menu might seem rather paltry, serving only one type of taco, bean or beef burritos, chicken or beef tamales, and one type of enchilada and tostada, but what they serve, they serve well. Not to mention every order is accompanied with a generous helping of chips and fresh salsa. It may not be the fanciest food, it may not be the tastiest food, and it may not be the healthiest food, but oh man, does it always manage to hit the spot! I should also mention Tito's is perhaps the best of the "hole in the wall" style Mexican places I've encountered in Los Angeles, an award I do not give lightly. Also, Tito's Tacos has its own Wikipedia entry... that's legit enough for me!

Obviously, people don't understand the fans of Tito's Tacos. Yes, they only serve tacos, a few types of burritos, tamales, etc. but how many taco establishments have people waiting in line at 9 AM to get tacos?? This just makes it much easier to order, a taco with cheese or with out. The taco is what makes Tito's tacos. It has a hard shell, mild cheddar cheese, lettuce and beef. No big deal, right... There must be crack in these tacos because people such as me keep coming back for more. And of course, each person orders their way. I can only manage 2 tacos, a side of rice, guacamole and Tito's famous salsa, which by the way, I can drink by the cup full. Now, about the place. The restaurant is small and there is seating inside and outside. Finding a place to sit and eat is easier than finding parking. There are no servers, you order your food at a window (inside or outside) and wait as the person helping you pulls your food together. They are pretty quick about it. I would say it is the whole experience that makes it. Remember, I'm 400 miles away from Tito's and I wish that someone would ship some to me overnight. If only the tacos would make it in one piece. :(

No - I don't not love Tito's Tacos - don't tell me what I like and don't like. Seriously, I think Tito's Tacos is trying to be facist - apparently I have NO autonomy when it comes to loving their tacos. All joking aside, I can never figure out why there's always a long line at Tito's Tacos. Everything has NO flavor, and is loaded with cheap lettuce. Don't get me wrong - I loves me some cheap tacos, but for goodness sake, please let there be SOME flavor of any delicious kind?!? Is that too much to ask for? I think when it comes to Tito's Tacos - people will fall into one of two catagories: It's either well loved or well loathed. I'm sorry to say, I'm in the latter catagory. I'm not going to give this place another shot, I'll stick to my Campos Tacos - thank you.

A decent fast food taco place at best. I've been here several times and still I walk away every time disappointed in some way. If it's not the tacos being beyond bland and greasy or the burritos having little to no meat. Tito's is ALL hype and people buy into it. Sure it can be filling if you want to get something on the go but that's about it. The salsa is nothing to go and yell off the highest mountain about. Only good thing about Tito's is the history of the place and Orange bang.

Food: WTF. Though not a huge fan, I can appreciate americanized tacos. But not dogified tacos. Also, what's up with the cardboard shoeboxes - they couldn't offer re-usable trays? Not only is the food awful, they need to fck up the environment as well?!

Tito's Tacos... coming from a native of NorCal (where places like Tito's simply do not exist), you gotta love this place. I went there for the first time a couple years ago and I must say, it was taco-surrealism. The first things I noticed about this place were the long lines (they move fast), and patrons walking away from the place in all directions with boxes full of tacos! When I tried my first Tito's Taco, I wasn't blown away to be honest. Then again I had just eaten somewhere else and wasn't too, too hungry (I tend to do that alot in LA). All of the elements for a good (American-style) taco are there for sure though. Crunchy fried corn tortilla, tasty stewed/braised beef, fresh lettuce, that bright orange grated (cheddar?) cheese, fresh salsa... Sounds pretty good, right? And you know, it took my second visit with some other friends for me to get it. Tito's tacos ARE pretty damned good. Sure the tacos aren't authentic Mexican cuisine, but I don't think Tito's is claiming to be so. Come on, Mexican-American cuisine has been in California forever. How can anyone be so quick to label Tito's as non-authentic Mexican? How can anyone complain about getting three big, tasty tacos and a soda for around six bucks? The ingredients are so fresh at Tito's, it almost seems like you're eating something healthy (okay, that might be a stretch). Plus they give you (a lot of) chips and salsa with every order (the chips are better than at most taquerias too). In addition, there's that weird, neat vibe that comes from the kitchen full of people preparing all that food for the masses of patrons. Bubbling cauldrons of deep red house-made chili, stainless fryers full of taco shell tortillas, the blur of hands filling boxes upon boxes with tacos...  It's a fast-food spectacle. If anyone tells you they've never stopped to watch that kitchen in action for a few minutes, they're lying. Another thing that stands out to me at Tito's is that practically everyone eating there just seems kind of... happy. The first time I went, it was crowded and there was nowhere to sit. Before I knew it, strangers were scooting this way and that to make room at their picnic table (Okay, that was kinda gay, but I'm from the Bay Area where that kind of communal-dining experience doesn't strike... often). I understand why people aren't crazy about Tito's Tacos. I understand why some people think it's all hype. I sometimes think it's not such a great taco, but often enough I think to myself "Damn, I want one of those tacos right now!". And I am DEFINITELY jealous that tens of thousands of Angelinos have childhood memories of going to Tito's!!! Who could argue with that? You COULD argue, but it'd be arguing with one HELL of a lot of people. Just look at the lines at Tito's... Tips for Tito's Tacos: 1.) When it's your turn, place your order and then step aside. You pay once your food is ready. 2.) Ask for the (free) picante green chiles salsa (in addition to, not instead of the red). If you like things spicey, you'll find the red salsa too mild. 3.) Think twice before ordering the Guacamole. It's not what you're craving. 4.) Turn down your speakers on your computer when visiting the Tito's Tacos website!

quick line, cheap, and filling.  I like the salsa, but don't love it and I like the tacos but don't love them. I do love the fact that they put all your items in a box and then fill it to the brim with chips and a cup of salsa. The flavors are pretty bland and they really need some kind of hot sauce. I prefer my local taco truck

I have a warm spot in my heart for these tacos. I especially like the salsa, its not super spicy but really good--so good I could drink it. The all beef burrito is really good. They give you a huge amount of chips, too! Some things to keep in mind: 1. they can be a bit salty at times 2. be prepared to wait in a long line. 3. they are cash only so make sure you have cash(they do have an ATM next to their building)

I finally got around to trying Tito's after four years of living in LA. The wait wasn't too bad (15 minutes) for a Tuesday at around 2pm. I was feeling hungry and ordered 5 tacos with cheese. When I finally took my first bite, I couldn't help but think "THAT'S what all the hype is about?" I thought it may get better if I kept eating but I couldn't help but feel greatly disappointed. The tacos weren't bad but they pretty much tasted like something you could get at Taco Bell. Tito's is definitely not a "must try" like people claim. I will not be going back there any time soon. Plus, not a single one of the employees cracked a single smile. And they tried to charge this guy extra money when he said he hadn't received any salsa. The woman he asked was STONE COLD. Hey Tito's, ¿qué les cuesta una sonrisa?

I spite Tito's Tacos, You spite Tito's too. These are awful tacos. Find a taco truck near you. Give lots of chips to hide the burritos, tacos, enchiladas too... the only thing that's worse than a Tito's Taco, is the queue* I say the best rating that this place deserves, is two. * queue    (kyoo)   n.   A line of waiting people or vehicles.  Rhythms with too.

Yeah, it's about as authentic Mexican as Hawaiian Pizza is authentic Hawaiian, but that is not the point. It's simple: Taco Shell, Shredded Beef (NOT hamburger), lettuce, cheese. No fuss. No Muss. You want to know how good Titos Tacos is? Well, it is before 10am Sunday on a Spring Forward Daylight Savings day (so it's really 9am). They are not even open yet and there are 8 cars in the parking lot. Nuff said. This is not just hype. This is actual proof my friends :-)

Pretty gross. It was recommended to me by a few people, but I just don't get it.  Their "ingredients" are just different vats of colored, greasy liquid. I won't lie, I ate the hell out of it, so I'm compelled to give it at least 2 stars.  But man... Gross.  Not going back.

Titos isn't the authientic taco shop.  I get it.  But sometimes you crave unhealthy, yummy, greasy,  tex-mexish, beefy, cheesy, crunchy tacos....  and boy are they delicious.  AND I like the salsa though liquidy.  It satisfies my cravings and hits the spot.  Take it for what it is folks!   Four (and a half -- if they allowed) stars to one of my favorite guilty pleasure junk foods...  oh how I miss you now that I'm in the bay area...

It seems to me that the bitching and moaning about Tito's misses the point of old school taco eating in Southern California. You don't go there for carnitas or rellenos or variety of any kind. You go there If you want tacos the old way, the way it's been done for the last 40 years by Mexican-Americans in Culver City. You go to Tito's. No, Tito's doesn't serve mind blowing designer tacos. No, its not how they do it in Guadalajara or Oaxaca or any of the "authentic" taco stands around town. Who cares? It's beef my friend, shredded beef,  fried in the shell where it lays, then topped with shredded lettuce and cheese. Simple. unsophisticated like me.  I don't go there for authentic, I go there for reliable, basic, tasty and cheap tacos. You like it or you don't, it's that simple. I have friends on both sides, and some of them are actually voting for Hillary instead of Obama, and that's ok. Simply put, Tito's is reliable grub. If you've just spent half the day in the surf you need this like you needed mother's milk, or Perry's PIzza in Newport Beach growing up. Sure, there is better pizza than Perrys, but is it right there by the pier when you get out of the water. No! You hit Tito's for the same reason. You go because it's old school and you can count on it. If you want more variety with your quality, stop at Gallegos on Venice Blvd., otherwise, just keep sucking down the soft tacos at that new Oaxaca style place on the hipster side of town. I bet it's pretty good.

Do not be fooled, this is not real Mexican food. This place has really bad food. The beef burritos have chili meat in them not carne asada. Yes, cheap over stewed bland chili meat. The chips are all wrong, and the salsa is mostly tomato. Don't go to Tito's.

I think this place is overrated. Best thing about this place is the salsa - fresh and mild. The chips are fried fresh. Yum! I had the beef and bean burrito - eh it was ok. For $3.50, what else would you expect? There were some chunks of beef. Don't get the tamale. Flavorless and doesn't even come w/the husks. Yuck. A cup of water sets you back 25 cents. There is a small lot, but you'll probably end up parking on the street.

The thing with Titos is, you either love it or you hate it. Me and my family have been frequenting Titos since I was very young and I am pretty sure I may have had some in utero! I looked forward to every Sunday after Church when I knew to expect a family dinner to include some yummy Titos Tacos treats. Its not snooty, its not bright and airy, its not pretty shades of blue and orange with eclectic art on the walls and comfy lounge seating, no soft music (in fact, no music)...bottom line, you go to Titos for the food, not for the pretty decor or comfortable seating. Being the puritan that I am, I stick to the basics. I usually order two tacos, with cheese, a small guacamole, small beans, and jalapenos. Okay, maybe it's not that basic. The thing with the tacos is, their naked and yearning to be dressed up. Cheese helps, but what really gives these tacos their boom boom pow is the salsa, guac, beans, and, if your brave, jalapenos. One bite of this combo will send your taste buds soaring!  FYI the salsa, jalapenos, and chips are included - a generous amount of each. As for the other items on the menu, my opinion is that if it's not going to be accompanied by a taco, not worth getting.  The tacos make everything better. Titos is the ultimate comfort food and a definite point of nostalgia for me. Expect a food coma to follow.   I LOVE TITOS TACOS! YOU LIKE TITOS TOO! P.S. BRING CASH.  NO CREDIT CARDS HERE!

Pros: cheap food, a LOT complementary chips & salsa, decent taste There was a HUGE line for the food inside - there are 2 lines. There are lines outside but they were closed at the time that we went. I don't see what the fuss was all about. This is CASH ONLY. The parking situation sucks - there is a lot with tiny spaces that seemed meant more for motorcycles. There is also street parking but I believe it's metered. The food is...whatever. I would never go out of my way to go there again. I've made better food in my own home. Just really...blah.

Been going here since childhood, and everytime I'm back in LA, I go here as often as possible.  Sometimes multiple times in one day...no joke!  These tacos have crack in them or something.  The secret to the perfect tasting taco is, you gotta pour your salsa inside.  Make sure you order cheese (costs extra).  I prefer the double meat burrito over the regular.  The meat is so tender and juicy from simmering all day long!  Yum yum, and for a little extra you can double the tortilla on your burrito.  Some prefer it this way; I think both are great.  Bravo Tito's, you will always have a special place in my stomach!

I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food, but given the enormous line that stretched out the door just ten minutes before closing, I don't doubt the quality or taste of Tito's. I had a delicious meat and beans burrito with shredded beef.  I love that it comes abundantly with great made-on-the-spot tortilla chips, and I really liked the salsa!  It's lighter and more garden tasting (lime and diced tomato) than the heavier salsas (tomato paste based). As for the tacos, I tried one and found the shell to be too crunchy.  I'm with Chris M in that it's rather simple but I found the meat to be fresh-tasting which blended well with the hand-grated cheddar.

While it is far from anything authentic, Tito's does a good job at their Mexican food.  What you get there are reliably good yellow cheese vintage American tacos, tostadas, etc.  Get here early for lunch during the week and expect a crowd during the weekends. Cash only! Tito's has been an icon in Los Angeles for years and will be forever I am sure.

The tacos are super delish! But the fun stops there my friend. While I can dig their tacos and burritos... I must warn that their tamale's are bland and forgettable, and their enchiladas are messy and gross. If your going to Tito's. Stick to the tacos, burritos and chips and salsa. All of which are very delicious and worth every last penny. For fellow Inland Empire residents: don't bother making a special trip. I's not worth it. However, if your out in LA for work/play or to pick someone up at LAX go for it. You have to try it once after seeing those ridiculously mind numbing commercials.

I dont think tito's hispanic... I dont know about you but when I think of a taco, I imagine some carne asada, onions, cilantro and salsa on top of a soft corn tortilla shell. If your looking for that your definitely going to the wrong place because they dont have it. I've given this place a 2nd and even 3rd chance since everyone always seems to rave about it but I really don't see how or why people like it. The first time, I had a burrito. It was HORRIBLE. I mean how bad can it be? Its been awhile but I think it was made out of shredded beef and it was watery. Like it was beef stew wrapped in a flour tortilla. 2nd and 3rd, I realized people come here for the crunchy tacos. I still was not impressed at all. I think the salsa makes or breaks a place and theirs definitely was not good at all either. Great for chips but not for "tacos". If a friend asked me to go again, i'd go with them but I would order from the place next door. Forgot what the place was called but to me that place was a lot better than tito's.

I get the feeling that my review for this place is useless. I too fell for the foot-traffic-trap and went there without reading yelp but I think yelp would have just confused me. The tacos: $1.70 each and with cheese an extra .50. More substance to it then a Jack-in-box taco and about 1/3 less grease which is about 200% too much grease for me. Flavorless. Would prefer Del Taco any day. I got a weird feeling in my stomach and stopped eating my second taco. Now I am eating some fruit and about to hit the tums. The tastado is about 6-8 bites TOPS. Flavorless. The brown sauce adds to the tastado but still meh. $2.70. The cheese in the taco was yummy and tasted like cheddar medium sharp. The chips were almost stale. The salsa that came with it was good but nothing outstanding. If you go there and hate it and come back and see my review, you will be annoyed! So read this review now and forgot Tito's forever.

I don't understand the hype. There are better tacos at Taco Bell. You can make better tacos at home with Ortega. Almost any taco is better than these lumps of meat, cheese, and lettuce on a crunchy tortilla. The meat lacks any kind of seasoning, and the tortilla shells and chips seem like the same kind you can buy at the store. Go next door to Johnny's Pastrami for better food and atmosphere.

You'll either like Tito's Tacos or you'll hate them, and if you're the latter then it just means one less person for their "cult like patrons" to stand behind as they wait for their hard shelled tacos, enchiladas, burritos and tamales. My take on Tito's is that we can't deny the fact that there is almost always a line at this place, and so they must be doing something right not to mention the hundreds of Yelp reviews whether positive or negative. Their tacos are different and if there isn't a line when you drive by, perhaps you should try one or two and judge for yourself.  There are better places for the tamales and the enchiladas.  I wasn't a fan of their burritos as the grease overcame me by the second bite.  Whichever side of the argument you may be on, the reality is they don't look like they'll be going out of business anytime soon.

I LOVE TITOS. The meat is so tasty. That, together with that crunchy taco shell and the fresh salsa, is sooo deelicious to me! I have a particular method of eating Titos Tacos. I order the taco without cheese. I spoon a bit of salsa before every bite. I eat around the top of the taco only first, leaving only that bottom middle part with all the meat! Then I try my best to savor the rest. Again, the hard shell, the meat plus salsa is the best part for me! The taste and texture just reels me. oh goodness, so yummy! Burritos are also pretty good too. Not your typical burrito. Almost like a wet burrito.

Got lucky with parking around the corner, and a pretty swift line move. Some people have complained about about it being a bit chaotic but it was an organized chaos that works as long as you don't hesitate. The tacos are amazing! I really enjoyed the sauce that goes with the tamale as well. I like the tostada but I would rather get another taco next time. The salsa is great and it's awesome the portion size of chips. My friend and I had a splendid lunch and the time in line only helped to excite us and look forward to some good food. Final thoughts: Choose your timing. It's a popular food joint in LA, so it's going to be crowded, accept it. The food is great, cheap and the ice is soft. Definitely going to be a return patron.

Yeah, okay the line can get ridiculous.  And it's just a taco stand, right?  WRONG.  It's a feast of lovableness that makes you happy to be an Angeleno.  Seriously.  A box of tacos that deliver nothing but pure gastronomic delight.  These are the tacos that your father, and his father before him, dreamed you would someday enjoy. Okay, that may be a little over the top, but in all seriousness, they do tacos ... and they do them right.  Nothing super fancy, just plain goodness.  Bring a book, grab a friend, wait in line and dive in!

Greasy-ass, deep fried, expensive tacos piled mountain high with yellow cheddar cheese. The lines are so long you would think they are giving them away (which they are NOT) and the line is filled with ghetto-fabulous people and creepy molester types that are probably eyeing your wallet as you pay and planning how to mug you on the way to the car..... Which brings us to the next problem: parking. It sucks. Just save yourself the body work on your car and park on the street next to the freeway underpass where all the hobos sleep. On the upside, this place proudly has the most inefficient system for ordering food in all of LA. (I challenge anyone to prove me wrong.  Email me. I dare you!). Literally. No Joke. No exaggeration. The same person takes your order, prepares your food, and charges you money! - All on a counter large enough for 2 lines! And did I mention the lines are long? Yep. Long. And how! Their hot sauce.... hold on one second. Let's start over: Their sauce IS NOT HOT! Just blended tomatoes. Mild sauce from Taco Bell is spicier. Seriously. Oh, and good luck finding at table. Bonus points if you can find a clean table. Their food is edible. And I've been there several times, you know I think its at least ok..... and see I gave it 3 stars.... Maybe I'm just trying to do MYSELF a favor and shorten those lines at Tito's. Hmm... PS: 5 tacos w/ cheese, 2 small drinks, and avocado sauce for $18 dollars. Do the math.... kinda pricey.

Titos is very good and inexpensive Mexican food. Its a must go for someone visiting from outta town  trying to experience something completely unique to Los angeles. The beef bean and cheese burrito is my fav thing I get from there... The experience itself is fun as i used to watch the women making the burritos from the window when i wad a young lad. I would suggest you take home a bunch of tacos burritos home with you because believe it or not the food taste really good reheated something also unique to titos tacos. Big fan!

Tito's is polarizing - no doubt about it.  Either you love it or hate it and much debate will rage between the two parties.  I will say that the locals tend to love it, while those not from the area just don't get it.  Whatever - that's one less person to stand in line behind. The best parts?  All-meat burrito with cheese, the chips and unique salsa and the fresh guacamole.  The enchiladas are decent also.  I've actually never been a fan of the tacos. Tito's is also great road trip food.  Since moving to northern California I'll always stop by and get 6 burritos to go - one for the road and five for home.  The salsa travels well, but the guacamole not so much. Tito's is an institution that brings me right back to my childhood and I can't wait until the next trip to get some.

The Guacamole is the one thing I wouldn't necessarily recommend, but who needs it when the salsa is amazing.  Regular burrito with rice and cheese and a taco with cheese is just the most satisfying lunch/dinner you can have.

I know 5 stars sounds crazy...but for what it is, Tito's deserves it for sure. I've been coming here since I was a kid and have always loved it. The burritos are good, but the tacos are the best. I wouldn't consider a trip to culver city complete without a trip to Tito's. Blahblahblah Tito's isn't authentic mexican food...I know, so you might be wondering why I would ever give it 5 stars: Tito's does what it does extremely well. Don't go if you're expecting healthy mexican food, or restaurant food. It's FAST FOOD. Get over it. Expect a line pretty much anytime you get here, and although there's seating both inside and outside, it's best to enjoy your meal at home. This sounds a bit ridiculous but the sodas come with crushed ice which is an added benefit. I think the guacamole is surprisingly good for being from a fast food place...but it isn't for everyone. The guacamole and salsa both go really nicely with the chips or the tacos. Definitely try the guacamole at least once. Whenever I go, I make sure to get an extra taco because someone I'm with always "realizes" they're hungry once I get back with Tito's. The service is good and the line goes pretty quickly. If you speak Spanish you might get VIP treatment. BRING CASH.

Only one thing to say Overrated! Let me further divulge, there is always a wait here, I mean always! When you are a kid growing up/teenager and so forth you are always excited to go there, mob mentality I guess you could say. Kind of like Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles, its just fried chicken and some waffles, but way overpriced.  Anyhow, the tacos here are standard, the enchilidas are ok and the burritos aren't worth noting. This place would have gotten three stars if you didn't go into the place overhyped on expectations, but its such a let down that it gets two stars. Parking is a pain also.

What Pinks did for the Hot Dog, Titos did for the taco.  There's a reason why this place has so many people reviewing it... Simply... the best place in LA for a greesy taco with cheese. The lines are long, so be prepared and just take a friend to chat.  Or don't be surprised if you see someone you know in line for their guilty pleasure.   The tacos are shredded beef in a hard shell, you can add cheese.  It comes with chips, so I recommend that you order extras salsa.  I just love their salsa.  It's kind of pureed tomato with a little kick. Bring cash.  They do not accept cards. Other people I know also like the burritos and enchiladas.  But, to me, this is like ordering a hamburger at Pinks. Definitly, Tito's is an experience for the locals.  And we love it.

Best damn hard tacos I've had in years!! Taste almost as good as Mom used to make. Simple. Shell, lightly seasoned meat, lettuce, tomato, and topped with shredded cheddar cheese. Sometimes less is more, and I usually subscribe to the more is more school of thought. 2 tacos and a drink for under $6. That's my idea of a lunchtime bargain.

Ah the great Tito's Tacos, the place on Washington Blvd that you always see with the super long line and lots of happy faces. . .  well not here my friend; though this place does have some cute aspects. There is ample parking near the building, though try and avoid the lunch rush because those lines that I was talking about are there from 10 - 2PM daily. So I went with my southern loving friend and the missus and we waited in line. As we stood in anticipation I was able to look to see who the cooks were in the stand, and it was 30 little ladies! Well not really 30 cause I think 15 is the max you can pack in there, but they were little mexican ladies! So now I'm pumped for some real home style Mexican food. As I peruse the menu and decide I notice they have a really good selection of foods and entrees and side dishes, on top of the homely feeling of the moms in the kitchen. The service is pleasant but quick 'cause of the rush. So we go quickly. Now here is why I gave it a 2 stars; after I received my order of 3 tacos and an enchilada I noticed the portions were kinda small and my enchilada resembled a large red and yellow slug. There wasn't the aroma of fresh food like I was hoping for and when I was watching them make the food they kinda looked unhappy to be working. Made me kinda  sad. Anyhoo, my southern loving friend (he doesn't love southern people...he loves southern food....you know what I meant!) said that he's had better also and might as well headed over to the local Del Taco for his fix, and he doesn't have to wait in a line. Overall, it's ok, I went once and said that I've been.  But for those of you who like to try new places, it wouldn't hurt to try it once. Enjoy.

If you want cheap and tasty, go to Taco Bell. Or a taco truck. Mmmm taco trucks. But if you want the blandest food in all the land, go here. It is very much an LA institution. Plenty of people have hazy drunken memories of eating here after Dodger/Laker/UCLA/USC games. It falls in the ghetto fabulous category, but people forget that what makes something ghetto fabulous is fabulous food! I don't know they could manage to make refried beans, enchiladas, chili con carne, tamales, and salsa so flavorless, but they managed. Is there a salt or chili pepper shortage?!? Food flavor improved after getting a cup of pickled jalapeno relish, but we needed a ton in order to make the food taste like anything. I think it's because they decided to add water to everything to up the volume. Water to the beans, water to the chili, water to the enchilada sauce, and a ton of water to the pink salsa. Yes it was pink. And ew. At least the taco was decent, but beware! It's only $1.60, but you get a taco without cheese. If you want cheese it's $.50 extra!!! But the cheese is really good here. It tastes hand grated. It's quite mild for cheddar, but still, good fresh grated texture. Also, Tito's Tacos is a Pepsi restaurant. Didn't see any orange bang or horchata so had to settle for the least of Pepsi grossness, rootbeer. So if you absolutely have to come here and try it, I suggest sticking with a taco with cheese. Possibly two if you're really hungry for crunchy blandness.

The food: Please note that I LOVE Mexican food and finding small, fast and inexpensive places to feed my craving. I've heard a lot about Tito's Taco and every time I drive by (no matter the day or time) there is always a swarm of people out front. I decided to try it out for the first time this past Sunday for dinner. I ordered a burrito and my boyfriend ordered a burrito and taco. I liked that we got chips and salsa with the burritos which were very tasty, but as far as the burrito went I was only satisfied. I didn't find the food extra special or better than my other favorite locations. The salsa was okay... I've had better. The location: There is a tiny parking lot that always seems full and some street metered parking under the freeway. When driving, be careful for the jaywalkers who also are having a Tito's craving. The service: I really don't understand their service system. One person is assigned to take your order, prepare the food, collect your money, then give you your order (in that order). I feel that it makes the process so chaotic. Who took my order? Where did she go? Wait... why don't I pay now? You can definitely tell the newbie customers with the look of confusion on their face (yes... that was me on Sunday). I guess I just like the traditional way of ordering... order & pay in one line, then wait for your order number to be called in another line. On the bright side, they had a lot of people working and everyone was busy and made sure the line was moving fast. Final thoughts: I think I might try this place out another night when I am in the area and craving quick Mexican food. I'll probably try out a different item... maybe the enchiladas? I just wasn't that impressed by my first encounter and obviously don't see what everyone is talking about.

Just because Mexican food is inexpensively priced, doesn't make it a good place to go...The food needs to be good. Having just moved to LA, I am on my search for good fast-food taquerias. From what I have heard, Tito's is a historic Mexican fast food institution around LA. And was I ever disappointed! Here are 5 reasons why NOT to go to Tito's: The menu is very limited, consisting of only a few items including burritos, tacos, enchiladas, and tostadas and limited ingredients to add to your meal which are not specified in the menu. Putting aside the menu, the food was tasteless.  Even the salsa had no kick. The service was very rushed. There was no effort to explain what could be added to the burrito which in part lead to the disappointing burrito consisting of two ingredients. Since they didn't have staple ingredients such as sour cream and ingredients they refuse to put inside their burritos such as guacamole, they need to say what is actually available. It felt like the server had an arrogant attitude: as though this is Titos, take it or leave it The atmosphere is terrible. From the paint peeling off the walls, to the homeless guy waddling around, to the person sweeping under our feet as we were eating, it was a terrible experience. Cash only... In today's age, you better be darn good to be cash only. Avoid the ATM on site which supposedly has a high service charge. Parking is very limited. For the first time in the history of my 250+ Yelp reviews, I have nothing positive to say. If only there were a rating lower than 1...

Slightly overrated... I mean, I did like TIto's Tacos; the crispy shell, the tangy yellow cheese, and seasoned beef was a great cure for a hangover.  I'd pretty much devoured all the tacos I had in under a few minutes... oh, and topped with their hot sauce.... it really was an awesome breakfast. Yet awesome?  Isn't that a good thing?  It's just that its not the greatest taco I've ever had... I had my 3 and I was content.  I didn't want more.  So I can't say I think I would ever have a craving for Tito's Tacos... like the kind, oh, let me drive 20 minutes to get some, but if I was in the area, I'd drop by.

It's just one of those things you have to try.  For cheap cheap mexican food.  The place is grungy.  It's basically a taco-truck that found its stand.  But it's ALWAYS packed!  I'm sure it's a great place to eat when you're drunk but I dont think they stay open that late. Parking can be messy on a busy saturday afternoon.   Overall: it'll do.

Thery're right by the 405, convenient when I'm driving back from L.A. There's always a line both inside and out. They offer decently sized tasty tacos at affordable prices. Their tacos are simple and consistently good with cheese. They are not the highest quality, but a greasy guilty pleasure. They also give you lots of chips and salsa. The chips are thick and salty. The salsa is juicy with tomatoes, onions, and cilantro. I usually like my guacamole lumpy and thick. Their guacamole is pureed smooth, but it's still good. Their refried beans with cheese is a lot better than their bean burrito. The filling is the same, but a big tortilla masks the flavor of the beans. If it's your first time and you plan on eating there, grab a table while the other person orders.

I have been coming to Tito's tacos for years! I used to work on the Westside and it was always a something I look forward to. Do I think that their food is perfection? Well, No. These are simple tacos and burritos. I still really like their tacos. I love the amount of cheese they put on them and quite frankly those tacos are filled to the brim with meat, tomato, lettuce and cheese. YES, you do have to pay extra for cheese but it is thick grated cheddar and you get a fair amount. I normally get a side of guacamole (which is a bit thinner than others) which has a lot of flavor. Their salsa is pretty runny. If you like chunky salsa then you will not like theirs. I can take or leave their beans and rice. I have had way better at other places. Bring cash and some patience. The lines might be long but the staff is pretty quick. The other thing is that parking is generally a royal pain. The parking lot is almost always full and the street parking is limited.

This place has pretty good tacos, simply because their ingredients are completely fresh. Their tacos were not greasy like the ones you've had at other Mexican restaurants. Instead, their lettuce was crispy, their tomatoes fresh, their beef tender and cheese freshly grated. Being a small girl, 2 titos tacos are enough to fill me up, especially since it comes with complementary chips and salsa. The salsa is the best part about the meal, also cause its fresh! I can't emphasize how FRESH this place is!!!!!! Parking is a hassle, since the parking lot is small. The seating area is not that big, so I suggest you take it to-go. The wait is not that bad, since it's always packed, it takes 5-10 minutes from the time you order to the time you get your food.

Everyone I know from Los Angeles is obsessed with Tito's Tacos. I'm still trying to figure out why... Nothing I've had at Tito's tastes any better then other Mexican restaurants in LA.

If you're looking for authentic Mexico City street tacos with dual corn tortillas, cabbage, and onions, you're in the wrong spot.  If you're looking for a SoCal Taco loaded with amazing cheese, crunchy shell, and smothered in salsa, heaven awaits. I really can't believe the bad reviews this place has received and it must be because the patrons are expecting something else.  I always get extra cheese and as someone else stated, ALWAYS make sure every bite is loaded with salsa.  God I want one now so bad.

I know you put lard in everything, but you have been with me since I was born - my mother ate you when she was pregnant  - you are a part of me.

Yeah, yeah. Shut up Tito haters. I love Tito's despite it not being really Mexican (I don't think anyone would say it's authentic), nor healthy, it's long lines, no accepting of credit cards, and small ass bathroom. It's just good though and it totally hits the spot. I love the tacos and the meat & bean burrito. I don't dare try the tamales. Tamales fall into two categories: Authentic and Nasty. I don't think Tito's are authentic, so I rather not bother. The chips and salsa are quite pleasing and I can eat that forever. It gets a five in my book bc I just had it a few days ago and I swear I devoured it as if I'd hadn't eaten it days. I was sad when it was all gone too. So yeah, I gave it 5 stars. But do I recommend it? No. Stay the hell out. I could do without the long lines.

Is it amazing? No. Is it authentic? No. Is it cheap? Yes. Is it good? Yes. Would I go back? Sure. Overwhelmed with laziness one night I decided I couldn't be bothered to go any farther than Tito's Tacos. Luckily we scored a spot in the tiny parking lot because parking on the street and walking may have deterred me (I was really, very lazy). Even more luckily, the line was almost non existent. We were able to make our dining decisions and order in under ten minutes. About five minutes after that we were seated (yeah, we found a table!) and enjoying our tacos. Roommates Ryan and Jason both got three cheesy Tito's Tacos. Boyfriend CP and I each had a meat, bean and cheese burrito and one cheesy Tito's Taco. Our order came with chips and (previously frozen?) salsa. I'm not big on hard shell tacos. But, if I was going to have one, Tito's hard shells would be the ones I would go for. The meat inside was awesome, plus they use actual cheddar and not some weird, fake crap; it was good cheese! Throw on some lettuce and you almost have a square meal. The taco of the Tito variety was definitely a win. The burrito on the other hand was not as much. The beans and the aforementioned delicious cheese were more than satisfactory and I venture to guess their bean and cheese burrito is heavenly. Not to mention the tortilla was perfect. Such a good tortilla. But the meat inside the burrito was weird. There was this spice in it that was not right. I'm leaning towards something like cumin or maybe even cinnamon. It was just not right. I ended up taking most of the filling out and just enjoying the scrumptious tortilla. CP had a similar experience with said mystery spice. I just can't tell you what happened. Even though the consistency of the salsa was weird (hence why we deduced it might have been previously frozen) it was really delicious. The flavor was good and the chips were awesome. We brought those home with us and munched later during our viewing of "10 Things I Hate About You." Needless to say we will be back. When I'm paralyzed with laziness and can't be coaxed much farther than the ease and comfort of a Tito's Taco... I'll be back.

First things first, DJ Ganz I challenge you.  I can name 5 places on the top of my head with better hard shell taco's.  But i'll name one.   Don Antonio's. Anyways, this place is probably a favorite for people who look for that american cafeteria style taco.  The tortilla is a bit on the hard side..not crunchy.  The meat has little flavor. And you can't get the full flavor of your taco cause you have to take separate bites up and down the taco.  So, you bite the bottom...all meat.  you bite the middle, all lettuce, you bite the top...all cheese.  I like taking one bite.and having all those flavors in my mouth...not in intervals.   I'm bias'd though cause I prefer the authentic mexican style soft taco. If you come here, try their tamale's and burrito's.  actually,  if you go there, look to your left, and walk to cinco de mayo taco's next door...and have yourself a better taco experience there.

In my experience, good Mexican food has three requisites: must come in big portions, be cheap and available at a hole-in-the-wall.  Tito's fits the bill. The chips and salsa are fresh, the food is not greasy, and it tastes good. There's a reason why there's always a line outside.   Service is fast, and as friendly as can be on limited English. Be warned, it's cash only, and nothing fancy, but that's how they keep the cost down. It's not my favorite Mexican joint, but it comes close. I'll eat here again.

I live up north in San Jose and I make SURE that whenever I'm down in Culver City, I hit Tito's Tacos.  I love how fresh everything tastes and although it's not super authentic, it is not without it's charm.  I love how the food items are packed into the brown boxes and the leftover space is utilized for chips & salsa. Trust me, I'm half Mexican & have spent enough time going to family feasts and eating at the taquerias in the Mission District of San Francisco to know Tito's is NOT the place to go for an authentic Mexican meal.  There are just those times when you want something yummy & greasy (I really don't think Tito's is all that greasy, contrary to what many other reviewers have said) and Tito's does it for me. I like the simplicity of the menu and their prices are hard to beat!  It seems as though Tito's Tacos is one of those places that either you love it or you hate it.  Let mine be one of the voices shouting out my undying love for Tito's!!!

I write this review not to add anything of real substance (how can I after 700+ reviews?), but simply to vent.  I just don't get it ... why is there ALWAYS a line in front of this place?! The tacos are average at best.  The salsa is below average and the chips are nothing to write home about.  Also, the line takes forever because there are invariably people who order 10 to 100 tacos at a time.   Nonetheless, there are two reasons why I will sometimes go to Tito's: (1) it's a 5-minute drive from my place and (2) sometimes I don't feel like eating Taco Bell or Del Taco and want something a bit more authentic tasting. If you're in the neighborhood and happen to pass by Tito's, give it a shot.  But if you're thinking about making a special trip just to try it, I wouldn't waste my time.

These things taste okay, but they are not tacos. Jack and the box also has tasty things in a tortilla shell, but those are not tacos either. Nothing about this place is "authentic Mexican." I think they make the salsa by opening a can of crushed tomatoes, straining the liquid into a Styrofoam cup and handing that cup to you. Its nothing more then red, tomato flavored water. If you like this place, please don't let me stop you from enjoying what you call a Taco. But if you decide you want to experience the best Mexican food outside of  Mexico, i suggest El Taurino. Try it and you might have different feelings about Titos.

My first time there today.  I tried to find the menu which is behind the order window.  I couldn't read it because of the glare.  I had to go up to the window.  The menu was very ambiguous.  Meat burrito --What the hell is in that?  Taco --No choice of chicken, beef or carnitas??  WTF?  When we got up to the window, I quickly I ordered the all meat burrito, thinking salsa could always make it better.  My friend ordered the taco.  They ONLY have beef tacos.  NO chicken, no carnitas and don't ask them if they have chicken quesadilla because that doesn't exist at this Mexican restaurant!   When we got our food, my beef STEW burrito which tasted and looked like canned dog food completely seeped through my thin flour tortilla.  There was no rice, beans, guac, or salsa.  My friend's taco beef was dry.  When I went back to ask for another salsa at the window, the lady behind the counter made a commotion.  She demanded to know if I purchased something and made me point out which lady helped me.  She then told me I had to pay for the salsa, which is pretty much liquid and not even spicy.   I always finish my burritos, even if I can't finish the last 3 bites.  I had to throw this one out half way.  Yuck. The only thing good there was the chips and cheese.

My boyfriend has brought some of Tito's tacos home for dinner once before and at the time, i had thought it wasn't bad. This is my second time eating from there... and I can take it or leave it. I find the food to be a bit on the bland side. There's no seasoning, sauces or anything fancy about these tacos... I do enjoy the crunch factor...but other than that...I feel its a pretty tasteless taco...like Julie A mentioned add .45 cents for cheese. The salsa is watery, just tastes like chopped up tomatoes, the rice looked kind of like it has been sitting in the pot for a while, it's greasy and well i found a soggy chip buried under it when i went to mix up the rice...and just gave up and threw it out. The commercial is funny because of its low budget and that damned jingle ALWAYS gets stuck in my head! I guess you can say it's good drunk food.

Been here before, but I guess I wasnt part of the Yelp family yet. This is my kinda place - cheap, good food, whole in the wall type place. Had the all meat burrito & 1 taco. The burrito is just meat and cheese - and some sort of sauce. Good stuff, and not overly oily. I hate oily food. The taco is just that - its bigger than what you would find at taco bell or del taco. Is this the best Burritos/Tacos - ummm prob not. Dont come here expecting gourmet food, I would best describe it as a step above a taco truck. The lines here speak for themselves. Parking is horrible like others have said - so are the lines.

I have been going to Tito's since I was little. I don't order the tacos...I'm more of an authentic taco girl. Try ordering a bean and cheese burrito (that's right, bean and cheese), with meat sauce. It's delicious. Has the flavor of the meat, without the big chunks. Also, the chili con carne, good to put on top of the chips, plus, the meat is a bit smaller, more shredded. If you want AUTHENTIC mexican food, this is NOT your place.

We live in a world of fast food while being inundated with statistics of obesity  and how the average american practices unhealthy eating habits. Well folks, enter Tito's Tacos, a local family owned business that has got the recipe for success right. What is that recipe you ask? It is the combination of speed, afford-ability, service, taste, and health. And Tito's Tacos nails all of them. With prices like $1.70 for a taco--and we aren't talking a measly sized taco here people, it's decent portions, and delicious--and that is with tax included, how can you go wrong supporting local over a chain like Taco Bell which, let's be honest has rather bland and generic tasting food despite it's gooey cheesey delectableness sometimes (that is how we got into this whole obesity debacle in the first place--COME ON!!)...let's just be honest with ourselves and say that in times of the Great Recession, we gotta stick together and support the l'il dudes. Okay, so the food. The meat is not ground beef, it is carne asada marinated in a wonderful red sauce that makes your taste buds say, "oh, well helloooo" the salsa (which I wish was spicier but, it was fresh and tasty none-the-less) makes a very nice addition to the taco or burrito, or tostada...or anything really. Definitely get the cheese on the tacos, the burrito is also really well sized and super yummy too! I wanted to try the beans and rice but I couldn't fit more into my Tum-Tum after the TWO tacos and burritto...oh yes, it was fresh, it was tasty and it was GOooone! The lines can be long, but the service is speedy and there is actually a very decent amount of seating should you find the desire to stay and eat. Lovely place, and once you go, I have a feeling you'll be back...just be careful because althougth it is local, fresh and way healthier than Taco Bell, if you get 20 tacos (such as one man did while I was there...let's all hope it was for a taco party!) you're just not doing anyone yourself any favors, though you'll definitely be supporting Tito's Tacos in which case...pile on the Tacos!

I went here with my cousin a few years back so when I was in L.A. a few weeks ago and I wanted some Mexican food, I couldn't wait to get back to Tito's. The carne asada burritos and the tostadas were especially good. So, the next time I'm down there I will most likely be back.

I love Tito's! The only thing better than a Tito's Taco is 2! (or, see below :) ) The only things that bug me can easily be fixed if they wanted to gain 5 stars from me. So, why complain when it's just as easy to come up with a solution :) 1) the long lines- a) allow for call ahead! This will be awesome to come up and just pick up food ready to go/eat b)order then pick up, not order and now wait before we take another order. This isn't time useful! 2) smaller/cheaper size for beans/rice - this one size is way too big for us! 3) Cash Only?!? What? Are we stuck in time? People don't usually carry cash nowadays. How about debit/cc machine?? 4) Parking, it's crazy! Try a drive thru service, that would be awesome!! I do have to say the good is soo delicious and worth a drive from San Pedro :)

I give them 4 stars because I don't expect gourmet food when I come here.  I come here for fast, yummy mexican.  I always order the tacos and enchiladas with cheese, and my kids love it.  The salsa is to die for, with a hint of sweetness.  This is a family run restaurant, so everyone inside looks like the just crossed the border.  But no worries, they know how to make good food. My husband loves the beef burritos, I love the rice drinks.  Basically, there is a line outside and inside, and you'll be served at a slow pace, not like McDonalds!  But it's worth it!!

This place rocks.  A staple in the competitive world of mexican fare in LA, Tito's doesn't offer chicken, mariscos, or carnitas.  Shredded Beef Tacos and incredible burritos make this place one of a kind (even though I burn my mouth on their burritos every time).  Their salsa's consistency is something I cannot explain (sounds gross, but it's like they all spit in it or something)...but it's amazing!   Keep up the trabajo bueno, Senor Tito!

This place is for the experience, and not the food. The tacos here remind me of a Jack in The Box taco, on steroids. If you like the greasy shell,  "all you taste is lettuce" filling, watered down salsa, random-ass-who's-who-in-line, no parking, and gross guacamole; then come here. I've seriously never had salsa, or guacamole, that tasted like it was marinated in water. What the hell is that? If you want a taco like this, go to Jack in The Box, shove in more lettuce, and a ton of shredded cheese. Same thing!

Close to home, but far from perfect, Tito's Taco's always has a line in front of it for reasons unknown to me.  While it isn't bad, if time is money, then you may want to start saving by avoiding this stand.  Advice is to park around the corner or across the street on Washington and walk over - the small parking lot is a little hectic when it's busy. I've only tried the taco's, and they've always been pretty good - everything's freshly made to order and hot, but I guess I was just expecting taco's from heaven with the raves I had heard from other people.  While they were good, they weren't heavenly so this place ranks just a-ok to me.

This is not your average taqueria taco, no no no. This is a crispy taco, or crunchy taco, if you will. Also, the beef is not asada, so don't expect that either. Really, don't come here thinking authenticity, because you're not going to get it. And when it's busy, good luck with parking and getting a table. They have a dining room, and a parking lot, but more than likely all spaces have been occupied. If you're able to get over the fact that it's not authentic, and you're able to be guilty free with your food, then you HAVE to like this place. It's affordable, simple, and is surely worth your time. Once again, don't compare this place to your King Taco's of the world, because they are different taco's entirely....and don't compare if you ask me, but hey, different strokes for different folks

Wow, a real love it or leave it group of reviews here.  So basically, I guess if the crunchy tacos suit your flavor, then you'll love it.  If you like "other" types of mexican food other than crunchy tacos, you probably aren't a fan of this place.   Let me first reinforce some things already discussed about Tito's Tacos in Culver City: 1) Cash only 2) Long lines 3) Crowded so not always a place to sit and eat 4) Parking difficult 5) No Coke, just Pepsi 6) Not open late 7) They give you useless JFK 50 cent pieces in change that you can't use in soda machines or parking meters My rules stipulate that any of these points would usually disqualify any taco stand from a return visit.  And yet, despite all this, I keep going back.  And have been for over 20 years.  I know, I'm breaking my own rules, but I guess I'm one of those that likes the tacos here.   Let me also state that I will only speak to the hard shell beef tacos (with cheese) and the salsa and chips here.  That's all I eat, partly because i'm not a big fan of their burritos, their tamales or anything else they have on the menu.  It would get 5 stars but because of their "narrow appeal", overall i have to give it a 4 star rating.   The tacos are crunchy, the shredded beef tender and the cheese sharp and flavorful.  There are no off days in my years of experience, and the tacos are consistently good.  The freshly fried chips are also crisp and the blended salsa is tasty and zesty.   If you've never been, and despite all its negatives, i would say you owe it to yourself to find out if you like Tito's Tacos or not.  Give it a try and then you'll know which side of the fence you sit on.

You hear a lot of hype about a lot of places, but this is one that does not live up to its reputation. The hard-shelled tacos are good, but so are Taco Bell's. The guacamole is good. The burritos however, are just bad. Granted, if you're drunk and hungry, as people often are, the greasy food here will definitely satisfy.

If you were to have asked me to write a review about this place nine years ago, I probably would've given it one star.   I saw the lines and the fuss about it and when I got my food, my response was, we put all this energy into this? It didn't help that I was a vegetarian at the time, so actually all I had were the bean tostadas, in really wasn't a fair evaluation of a taco joint. Years past and I had surrendered myself into the pleasures of flesh consumption and so I returned to see what all the hoopla is about again. Within having tasted the red sauce,  I understood it.  The taco's fried, greasy; the cheese cheap and yellow.  The sauce, a vibrant red and fresh with flavor and while, it might not be natural, it certainly feels like it.  It is the dragon and the tiger fighting forever in harmony. The restuarant  has a similarity  to what Chico's Tacos does for El Paso in the regional pride department.  If I talk to someone and I find out they're from El Paso, I'm fairly sure Chico's Taco's will eventually come into the conversation.  And similarly, I've mentioned that I live in Culver City to some people and they similarly bring up Tito's Tacos. Much like President Bush was in election year, Tito's and Chico's have a very polarized social base.  You either hate them or you love them and if anything, it makes for a good debate if you're bored. Finally, to me it's one of those landmarks that tells me that I'm home.  Tito's was one of the first places we came across when we first moved to LA, and everytime I see that big glowing yellow sign, I know I'm almost home. I wish they'd stay open later though cause that shit's probably good to drink with a buzz.

First of all this place is packed and no parking. I'm going to keep it real, this place is overrated and not worth the time or money. So stop reading, but if you must continue.....The tacos are smothered in cheddar cheese, lettuce and a mix ofground and shredded beef. My girlfriend was nice to say they had good salsa; in my opinion it tasted like water and tomato mixed; an outright insult to salsa. I just don't see the quality other than the cheese.   I think other people's reviews about this growing up in the area and not having any late night taco stands open make this place successful. I encourage you to purchase other food before hand just in case you don't like it, but hey if your mom made you american tacos with ground beef and cheese then it might spawn some memories, but I say you should go somewhere authentic and slap your mom for preparing those kind of tacos. lol j/k

I've been to Titos Tacos through the recommendation of my cousin.  When I first got there, the place was packed!  I suggest getting the food to go because finding seating can be difficult. The food was pretty good.  I ordered the meat burrito, tacos, and a bean & cheese burrito.   I really liked how fresh the chips and salsa that came with our meal was. And the tacos and burritos were absolutely delicious!! My only negative was the cramped parking structure.  But I did like the fact that the parking was free....usually a rarity in the Santa Monica/West LA area...

Scorecard: 3 stars - Good location. - 1 star - Long line. - 2 stars - Cash only (I think). 1 star - Awesome theme song. You can listen to it on their website if you don't have local cable. 1 star - Cheap!! More expensive than Taco Bell, but this place actually has Mexican food. - 1 star - No horchata. 1 star - Root beer! - 1 star - You have to specify that you want cheese so they can charge you more and put cheese on your tacos. 1 star - A taco with cheese is more like cheese with taco. - 2 stars - Awful parking. Sepulveda has meters that are often open, though. 5 stars - Epic childhood memories and knowing you're at THE Tito's Tacos. For those of you not wanting to do the math, that's 5 stars. Also, I wouldn't come here if it's raining. There's an indoor area, but you're more likely to end up in a line out the door and then eat in your car.

Tacos were really crunchy and good, but I felt the salsa was lacking flavor.....unless they have another salsa that you are supposed to ask for that I didn't know about.  Burritos were good and the chips homemade and extra crunchy like I like them. Yeah...the lines are long, but since they have so many windows open...it went really fast and they were very accurate with the orders. I wish I had gotten guacamole since everyone around me had it and it looked really good.

Tito's is one of those places you have to quantify to understand its rating. The good:  low prices offering tasty bits The bad:  long lines and little parking In short:  It's not authentic and it's not the greatest taco ever.  But the shell has a nice crunch as do the chips, and I like the salsa when it's flavorful - again, hit or miss).  It satisfies a craving when I need a yummy salty crunch.  Is it an everyday thing?  Not really.  Would I recommend to all?  Not exactly.  But I enjoy it.

Not a bad place to grab a quick and cheap bite to eat. The lines are usually long, but the turnover is fast so you won't be waiting very long. The tacos actually remind me a lot of the tacos that you can buy off the streets in Tijuana.  It's not pretty or healthy, but it's fairly tasty and dirt cheap.  a-ok. Not the best, but what do you expect when you can have a full lunch for $4? Oh yeah....did I mention it's dirt cheap?

The first time here was not a pleasant experience. The tacos seemed kinda of like Gov't issued tacos. The cheese was had an off taste but there is a  slight distinct sharpness to it. The meat is shredded and the texture is odd. But I think the salsa won me over but it took time.I can look  at the chips are a bonus if anyone would want to put it that way. I always pay extra to upgrade the salsa. I basically drown the tacos in the salsa and if I have extra salsa I scoop it up with the chips. The line is not as bad as it looks. The burritos are pretty good and they enchiladas are ok. The rice is pretty dry. Not a bad alternative to eat out if you don't want to spend the money on sit down Mex food. My sis loves this place. I do not see her reasoning.

Honestly? HONESTLY?? Southern California, a place that has such a plethora of exceptional Mexican and Latin American food and so many people are still eating here? I understand that it's a long time resident of the L.A. area and that deserves the star and the one time visit...but I'll be honest...it barely deserves that. There must be other reasons why people continue to come here....I'll have to look into that. The salsa is very tomato heavy and seems as though it was produced in a blender. There is no subtle kick, no mixture of tasty vegetables and spices. It tastes like someone put too many tomatoes in a blender, added a couple of other ingredients, and pushed FRAPPE. Have some dedication Tito's Tacos...some attention to detail...rather than mass production. Ah HA! I just found out the reason for the deserving of a star. Mass production. They are quick. You pay your dollars and your tacos are on their way. But AYE, THERE'S THE RUB - the tacos and burritos that are given to you are relatively bland and there is no succulent salsa to save them! My short visit to Tito's Tacos has become my last visit. For quick tacos....you know where I'm going. Oh King Taco, where art thou delicious lengua tacos!?

Man... this place is sort of confusing to order from, but delicious. There are two ways to order: Inside, and Outside at the windows. Both take the same amount of time give or take... If you order inside: You get real plates and cutlery- You are "eating in" If you order outside: You get a togo box. So... Now for the food I had Dos Tacos con queso and a drink. Which comes with free chips (freeeee) and a large container of salsa...like enough to feed a family... The tacos taste super fresh, the cheese is worth the 50 cents my friend...trust me. The taco shells are really consistently crunchy and delicious...obviously what you want (as opposed to half cooked half soggy messes that plague Mexican restaurants when they don't know what they are doing). The salsa was really good, kinda sweet for my taste, but still tasty enough to pour on top of the tacos. Decor: I didn't really notice, my face was buried in deliciousness. It looks like a fast food place...cleanish.... Parking: Free lot parking, easy to get spots, but challenging to maneuver into the tiny suckers. Rating 4: Better than your Average taco, would have been a 5 if the salsa was kickin. Conclusion: If you are slightly hungover or are about to be, you have found your destination for delicious tacos.

I really don't get this place. I saw the horrific commercials as well as the massive lines, so I figured it was worth checking out. There's really nothing special about the food - I tried tacos and the burrito, and it was considerably meh compared to the food you can get at some of the really authentic places. Maybe it was unbelievable back in the day, maybe it's a mass hallucination - but there are much better places to go to than Tito's. And Cinco de Mayo is right on the same street, with a much bigger menu and it's open 24 hours! There's no reason to ever pick Tito's.

Don't go expecting Mexican food because you aren't going to find it here. Tacos consist of corn, seemingly processed shells, ground beef, iceberg lettuce, and cheese. You can probably make a tastier taco at home... I have. Don't go out of your way for this place.

I've been here a lot. And there is a reason I come back. There tacos are great. I get 2 or 3 beef tacos that are to die for. Greasy and very unhealthy but sooooo good. Tacos come with chips and a tomato salsa. Food is cheap and quick. This is not gourmet food, it's down and dirty greasy taco. What I love about their tacos is that it tastes different than any other taco place which makes me always crave it 4 or 5 times a year at minimum. Don't get burritos here or really anything else. Stick to the Tacos if you want a foodgasm.

My friends and family have been going to Tito's for as long as I remember and to this day, I still don't know what draws me to this place. The food is as far from authentic as you can get while still labeling it Mexican and comparitively speaking, its not THAT good.  There's a uniqueness to the business and the lines all day every day until closing display the customer loyalty. As bad as it is along with the lowest quality of ingredients, (aside from the freshly graded cheddar cheese) I still get the craving every so often.  There's nothing else like it.  There aren't 1,450+ reviews of Tito's for nothing...

Great place.  Have been going to Tito's since around 1977.  There used to be one in Orange County but that closed many years back. If you are looking for hipster or "healthy" gourmet tacos and burritos forget it.  Tito's is hard shell beef tacos with thick shredded cheese, and huge sloppy burritos.  Chips and salsa are the best, thick and sweet/spicy, respectively.   Get in line, order, get your box and enjoy. Parking is a challenge....don't try the lot; use the street under the freeway overpass.

Everyone talks about the Tacos here, but the real gems are their Tostadas and the Chili Con Carne. I usually walk here because I live so close, but if you're driving I'd recommend getting a meter on the street - their parking lot can be a nightmare. Make sure you get extra chips and plenty of salsa!

Is it just me or do some of you find it odd that Tito's won't sell you just a "rice burrito"???? The reason...are you all ready?............."It's hard to fold"(said one of the lady's that has been working there for 40 years.)  Wow...she must be a real (fill in the blank). For being a "Mexican" joint....this is the most dumbness thing I've ever heard. Go to El Abajeno on Inglewood and Culver Blvd.  REAL Mexican food and if all you want is a rice burrito....honey THEY WILL give you just a rice burrito.  Or just cheese.  Or just sauce.

Although the burritos and enchiladas looked interesting, I stuck to the namesake. Tacos: A much more edible version of Taco Bell; not much more. I think I'll stick to mom's or a taco truck. What was pretty sad is their green salsa, which, as it turns out from the dozens of empty tin cans in the back of the restaurant, seems to be nothing more than chopped up pickeled jalapenos and carrots. Good, but not worth the trip to Culver City.

I used to drive by this place all the time, but never stopped because the lines were always extremely long.  One day I decided to stop and I have loved this place ever since.  Their tacos and burritos taste great and the price is right.  The food always tastes fresh and I always leave with a full belly and a smile on my face.  My wife loves their enchiladas and guacamole. Parking is a bit of a challenge, so scope out street parking under the freeway (405).  Also, remember that this is a cash only establishment.

Their Youtube video was catchy, so i ventured by one night with my girl friend!!! This is probably one of the very few joints I've been to with a tini tiny menu option. Its a very loud place, but people dont seem to mind since they were talking over another !!! I went there at night for dinner, and every time someone walked in, a huge gust of wind shot right towards the customers. :0 But over all Its a two star for me!!! a bit disappointed, One star for delicious chips. It was right out of the back so they were warm to the touch. + Another star for $. But you get what u pay for because I could have had made that burrito myself! Minus one star for cleanliness. my friend had to wipe the table down for us!!! or maybe thats just the way it is at Titos Tacos. Minus another star for poor order-taking-skills. Not only was server soft-spoken, the server (also my chief, yeah every server there makes ur food after they take ur order) assumed I made another order when really, I just asked him a Q about the enchiladas. At least repeat my order before U make everything on the menu next time? Minus one more star for the SUPER salty enchilada!!!! Did I just have a meal with 800g of sodium?

I picked up 2 burritos to go, after years of absence from Tito's.  I forgot that they had the all beef burritos and said "yes" when they asked if I wanted beans and cheese too.  My mistake...  I thought they were okay, but really wanted the all beef burritos.   The good thing was my timing.  I got there around 11am and there was no line to order and I found easy parking.  I will keep that in mind for next time.

The only thing better than a Tito's Taco, is two! I have tried a burrito & didn't care for it much. The tostada looks great, but honestly I'm one of those people that finds something I love & orders the same thing over & over. 2 tacos w chips & salsa for under $5 is a great deal & I love the taste :) Parking is always a joy & the front windows closes about 8pm, so if you prefer standing in the line outside (as I do) make sure to arrive before the 8pm end of line cut off.

Service sucked first of all. There salsa tasted like marinera sauce. The green salsa was chopped up pickled jalapeños. They only have one kind of meat from what I saw on their menu. Shredded beef or horse I think it was or some type of mystery meat...with no flavor. I went with four other coworkers. We all said the same thing. Titos Tacos is weak!

Used to live five blocks up from Tito's (for like 2 and a half years) and I went there every chance I got.  Ate it in the car on the 405 in traffic more times than I can remember. I guess they are still open after that "health code violation" I heard about just after I left LA this time last year.  (FYI, there is only "meat" on the menu, no chicken, no "beef") and from what I hear, it had something to do with horses.  Maybe a rumor, maybe not, but who cares, 1.35 a piece?  I'm still going ever chance I get, horse, rat, whatever, it's so good. I mean, at least they are honest, I've suspected Jack in the Crack and Kentucky Fried for YEARS, but they never come clean about mutant chicken (at least Jack admits that the tacos are a protein-based-meat-substitute).  Jack's Taco Sauce covers it up nicely. Last thought on Tito's: The lines move quick fyi so don't get flustered (I think it's because horse fries up faster than cow, something about the lean protein....sorry, couldn't help it)

Tito's is the answer to the question..."Can't we all just get along?" Located in Culver City not far from Santa Monica and the Westsiders, you'll see people of all colors and social classes enjoying their tacos.   Since this is LA afterall, you can tell a lot about a place from its parking lot.  Here, you'll note that all sorts of people love Tito's! I love how they give you lots of chips and salsa even if you only buy 2 measly tacos.

At places with so many reviews, i wonder if adding my two cents would be worth anything. *shrug* Review #193 I like it, but I don't love it. Tacos are very crispy because the shells are thicker than your typical Taco Bell Connoiseur would be used to. The meat is very oily but it's tasty. Burritos are also packed with meat and very flavourful. A bit drippy but it's fine if you don't mind heavy foods. Don't eat here more than once a year or else you'll die by your third visit. And exercise a lot in between patronages. I've come here on two occassions and was happy with my tacos. I sampled a few of the menu items on my first visit but when I returned, I stuck with the tacos. The salsa is also very nice. Not the best but it's pretty good and it goes well with the food. Enchilada was fine. A bit bland and very heavy with oil. Maybe I just don't like enchiladas. Tamale was also good. Better than the enchilada. Horchata was a fun treat. hee hee. Haven't had one since '99. I'd not make it a point to come back, nor would I make it a point to drop in if I were in the area, but I'm not opposed to coming here again. It's just not on the top of my to-eat list.

This is old school Mexican food, some of the best in LA.  The lines are long, and there's no way around it... you just have to go and wait, but it i totally totally 100% worth it.  Their tacos used to come with cheese, but now they charge, which doesn't suck, but when you're ordering 8 tacos it sucks and then when you order beef tacos on top of that, also adding money for cheese... everything is great though, lovely service, you get to watch them make all the orders.

This place is awful! I don't understand the hype, lines, or other good reviews. This stuff would be considered bad camp food. It is slop that is slapped on. I've had the beef burrito, which is shredded beef, not carne asada and the enchiladas, which require a knife to ge through since the middle is just a log of cheese, and nasty cheese. Of course they don't provide knives, or sour cream, or a handful of other staples by the way. It is cash only and I feel like they should be paying me cash to eat their "food."

Tito's is kinda like the Mexican version of Pink's: a Los Angeles institution that serves up overrated fast food.  That being said, I'd much rather eat something from Tito's than Pink's. I've eaten the tacos and burritos here on multiple occasions.  While they don't serve authentic Mexican, it is a somewhat unique take that I do enjoy.  The beef burritos are especially tasty in a "to hell with healthy food" kind of way. I would rank Tito's somewhere between Taco Bell and your average hole-in-the-wall LA mexican joint.  I won't go out of my way to eat Tito's, but if someone's picking it up I'll place an order.

The older you get, the tougher it is to lose weight, because by then your body and your fat have gotten to be really good friends. I find that as long as I stick with a taco with cheese, I do okay at Tito's. The cheese enchiladas and the beef and bean burritos are just plain gross. Looking for work? They had a sign in their window that indicated that Tito's is hiring.

Sorry Tito, but the tacos didn't do anything for me. Your cheese isn't even melted! You're generous with your salsa but it's not that great either. Have you heard of spices? Eh, I'm told the burritos are much better. Maybe it should be Tito's Burritos--got a little ring to it huh? What I do love about this place, the saving grace if you will is that despite the reviews and the public's general knowledge of "it ain't that good," people still flock here by the masses to get their grub on! Hell, I'll probably be back too. There you go, a flat out institution. Tito, I salute you.

The Carne Burrito with cheese and the tacos with cheese are fantabulous. Make sure you ASK for cheese because they won't add it on automatically.  I'm not a huge fan...scratch that...I don't like their Guacamole because it's watery but that's how they do it in Mexico..sooo...When in Mexico, right?  Anyways... If you're into Mexican food, this is a MUST TRY!  Whenever people come to visit, I take them to In N Out and Titos and I'll usually get a text a week after they've left saying they're craving both!

Hey, for those of you in the great debate over the authenticity or lack thereof, of the tacos...are any of you actually hispanic, or at least raised on the East side of LA? This is EXACTLY how we make tacos. FRIED. Between the tacos and the chili beans I cannot tell the difference between my grandma's, or any of my nine sets of Aunts and Uncles, or their kids cooking and Titos. I'm not saying they're any good mind you..... Go for the entertainment value of the people watching and have something besides a taco.

Been a huge fan of Titos for years. The tacos are greasy but oh so good. I prefer to add the rice to the meat & bean burritos and get one cheese taco. The salsa & chips are the best. Its better if you combine orders, you usually get a bigger portion of chips and salsa. The lines are usually long but the cashiers are quick. If you're ever stuck on the 405, just exit sepulveda. Cheap, tasty, and convenient. One of my guilty pleasures. One more tip: Grab a table while your friend orders oh and check the line inside. Its always shorter.

Authentic mexican food, with the hustle and bustle that outshines any overworked In-N-Out employee. These workers are true heroes. They whip up so many meals in minutes. The line is long, and so is the wait to get the food. But once you get it, and take a huge bite into whatever your order is. The salsa is good. I wonder if they put lard in their beans? that's a mystery. It doesnt taste like they do, but I'm not 100% sure. Their burritos are HUGE... and everything is so so delicious. Parking is crazy... you might have to walk a bit, but it'll burn off all those delicious calories you took in. This is my favorite taco place ever.

One of the best reasons to go to LA other than the hookers. This is how a taco was supposed to be. Not greasy, the shell is crunchy, loads of thick grated cheese, crispy lettuce and succulent shredded beef. The salsa is fresh and tasty. I'm surprised to see it only has 3 stars.

3.5, but I have to bump it down to 3. Why? The food is greasy, the taco shells are a bit hard, it's not the best quality meat, HOWEVER the SALSA is quite tasty (which they serve by the bucket), it's dirt CHEAP and it work well after few cervezas already thrown down your gullet.  And GOOD cheap hard shell taco shacks seem hard to come by on the westside...

This place is as good as my grandma's delicious home cooked meals.  That's quite the compliment! The prices are super cheap, the staff is totally like family when you get there.  Most importantly, they use REAL cheddar cheese.  Lines are always long, at any time of the day.  But it is worth it. Only thing that sucks is they only accept cash.  Yet, its probably better since it helps keep their prices low and it gets those lines moving faster.  It's a bad habit I have of never having cash on me and it's usually when I want to run into line that I'm reminded.

Okay... So my first time here. I'm standing in line with 4 pregnant women talkin about their cravings for Tito's.  While each of them ordered 11 tacos each, I thought to myself... This place should be good since it's in high demand for a fetus! So I have to say that all mexican food pretty much tastes the same to me. No matter how many ways you can manipulate tortillas, meat, beans, cheese and rice... It all pretty much has the same flavor.  I tried the hype this weekend and I must say I was impressed. Their tacos were very good and had a distinct taste.  I also tried the burrito & enchilada too, but it was nothing to orgasm over.  Everything on the menu has their signature beef in it, so don't plan on gettin any chicken with your order (except the tamales). When you come here, just play it safe and get the tacos.  They're awesome!  Don't waste your money on anything else except a drink and chips.  The only reason I'm givin this place 4 stars is because of the long line. Plan to wait about 10 min to place an order!

Lines are long during all parts of the day (I live in the neighborhood and see queues constantly) and the service generally takes a while. I'm not a big fan of the place your order and stand around for 6 minutes before paying and picking up. Admittedly, the tacos are pretty tasty. I've had the beef burritos a couple of times. They give chips and salsa but the salsa is not very flavorful (think watery tomato stuff). As for the cost-- the tacos are cheap but can add up fast -- keep in mind that they charge extra for cheese.

I always get lost trying to find this place.  Maybe because I always get lost!  It could also be because I forget whether it's off of Washington Blvd. or Place.   There's something addicting about these tacos.  What's cool about this place is diversity of the patrons.  I also like eating outside on the benches b/c it's just normal to sit next to a perfect stranger here.  i love this place!

This place is mosty about nostalgia for me.  The food is greasy and the menu limited (especially for vegetarians) but I still come here with my parents when I'm in town.  They've been coming here since I was an infant.  They'd make excuses to drive from the Valley to Culver City for something just to eat at Tito's.  "Pick you up from LAX?  Sure.  We'll stop at Tito's on the way."  They'd get the food to go and eat it in the car.   It was harder for me in my later childhood years to eat here.  I stopped eating red meat and chicken/fish were nowhere to be found.  The tostada (vegetarian) is pretty good and they've recently added a chicken tamale which was decent.   Basically, Tito's is an institution.  It's been here forever.  It's pretty cheap.  It's open late and always packed.  The food is good but you can find similar fare at other places (not a Jack in the Box though.  Come on.  It's better than that.)  I'd still reccomend that people go here at least once just for the experience.

Some of the less than stellar reviews here are certainly because that reviewer didn't like what he or she had for whatever reason. But it's also clear that a number are because the reviewer expected to find what they would at any run of the mill taqueria and that's a misapprehension that might be getting in the way of enjoying something pretty wonderful. Tito's represents a style of food that if you grew up in Southern California used to be a lot more common. It's more Mexican American than straight up Mexican (or Central American), which are represented by the soft tacos of the taquerias so blessedly abundant nowadays. But comparing the two styles and expecting them to be identical is like comparing a cantaloupe to a watermelon. They're both melons, but very different and equally good for being so. Tito's tacos in and of themselves are quite tasty: crispy fried tortilla still holding a nice bit of the fry oil, stewed stringy beef (like machaca) that's nicely seasoned, a sprinkling of lettuce, salsa and a bit of cheese. Kind of a comfort food version of a taco. They're good in a simple and delicious way, but what you're really here for are the burritos. Packed in a stretchy chewy tortilla and oozing that steamy, deliciously spicy beef, these things are mildly volcanic as the beef and the refried beans simmer lavalike under your first bite. Usually it's too hot to chow right through, but fortunately they've dumped a fistful of tortilla chips into your little cardboard box and you can scoop the insides out a crispy bite at a time until it's cool enough to finish off. All of it accompanied (and enhanced) by a surprisingly refreshing watery salsa. And that's it. Take it for what it is. Wonderful and now after all these years almost singular. If a thousand taquerias vanished tomorrow from LA County, we wouldn't register the impact because we're fortunate to have ninety nine thousand more right behind them. But if Tito's went away we'd definitely feel it. Enjoy it while you can.

Got there around 4pm on a Friday and boy was there a line!  As I was parking my car I saw people carrying covered cardboard box trays back to their cars.  Walking inside the restaurant I happened to notice that the menu was very simple and straight to the point.  I went towards the restrooms to go wash my hands before ordering; and as I was walking towards that direction, I had a good opportunity to see what the tacos looked like for the very first time. Stuffed in a crispy shell with lettuce and cheese on top, I wasn't expecting shredded beef to be in there.  Usually when you think of hard shell tacos(much like the ones you find at Toxic Bell) you think of ground beef.  The sight of the shredded beef just made my mouth water, and my mind started to imagine what it was like sinking my teeth into it. After coming back from the bathroom I immediately went to the counter to place my order.  1 Tito Taco and 1 Meat and Bean burrito. When I got the food I noticed they had tossed some chips in the cardboard tray box which was kinda nice.   Also, they give you a small tub of the salsa.  This salsa had a really light taste to it.  It was almost similar to that really light salsa found in Baja Fresh. All in all, the burrito and taco were tasty.  If you can, you should ask for more salsa for your order because that little tub goes quick.  Please take some time to go there and check it out.  Probably one of the most affordable places  to eat thus far that I have been to.  I hope this review helps.

I notice something about Tito's.  It is a place that you crave every so often.  You buy a bunch, pig out and then it will hold you for a couple of years.   Recently I've had one of these cravings.  It was good while it lasted - not great, not the highest of quality but good and it just feels  the craving. Really if I think about it, I can't say any menu item is great or recommend it, yet every few years I find myself going back.  Actually, I usually get another person to pick it up because watching them make it really isn't appetizing.

THEY SERIOUSLY NEED TO OPEN A SECOND LOCATION!!!!!!! THIS PLACE IS WAY TOO CROWDED FOR THEM NOT TO. __________________________________________________­___ The food here is actually good. It is pretty much authentic. The place is always crowded, though. The lines are like those at a stadium's concession stand. They are a big hassle and make you want to avoid going. The service itself is pretty quick. They pull your order as you wait at the counter. Some people obviously go here because they like crowds. I hate crowds!! All the nudging, bumping, breathing in your ear. Does any non-desperate person enjoy that? Move!! I think to date I have tried most of their items. I like burritos, but here the meat is not really to my liking. I was expecting it to be ground beef, instead it is stewed beef in a ruddy  red sauce. They only have two sizes of drinks and no refills. It is good for fast, authentic mexican food, but seriously way too crowded.

Either you love it or hate it. In my case I love Tito's. Been a fan for over 25 years. One of the best Crunchy tacos on the westside.  Though I'm no longer a meat eater this I'll still vouch for Tito's. Plus their chips and salsa is banging. Tito's por vida!

They have good enchiladas and guacamole.  Yeah, yeah it's not "real Mexican" food but who cares.  Taco Bell is awesome and no one's complaining about that.

I'll be nice... ill give 1 star... The woman and I saw Tito's Tacos and I heard of them from a couple of people... I decided to pull in... With a name like "Tito's Taco's" the woman and I decided to get the tacos....  I walked up to the window and asked for 4 tacos and a drink....the guy asked if I wanted cheese, to which i said yes...thats when it all went down hill. 1.) I thought cheese came standard on a hard shell taco...why did I have to pay "extra" for an unextra condiment?  I mean, im all for freshness and being fair, but this cheese wasn't even the gourmet type - this was the mass produced cheddar that you could get by the bulk at Smart and Final or Costco...  Fail and 2.)  Being a hardshell taco, shouldn't the taco be CRISPY?  Apparently prefried/day old/stale taco shells are the norm here....  The only way to remedy this is by putting a bucket load of salsa... Taste wise - the shredded beef was average, but in all honesty - I'd prefer a Jack in the Crack taco ANYDAY I dunno...I guess this is one of those trendy taco spots in a "seedy" part of town which brings to the glory of it all - if that's the case, im not impressed.  I'm from West Side Long Beach! ("Fe Lines represent..) Casa Perez here on my side of town, or even Baja Senora in Bixby is wayyy tastier and wayyy worth the money.  Even the "Seedy" places here in long beach accept Visa Cards...what gives? 4 tacos + a medium pepsi = $10.60?

I love Tito's, I've been coming here since I was a wee lass. Even when I was off in college, my parents would come to my volleyball games (when the games were in the LA area), and bring me a couple of tacos, some chips, and salsa to munch on during the bus ride home.  Love those guys... ANYWAY, taco's here are great in my opinion (shredded beef), and I'm a fan of the all meat burrito with cheese... Downsides?  Cash only and cheese is extra.   "The only thing better than a Tito's Taco is 2"...and an all meat burrito with cheese.

I loved this place. I finally was able to go here for lunch the other day and I thought it was delicious. The tacos are yum and the burritos are amaze-balls. The complementary chips and salsa that comes a long with your order were the best I have had in a really long time. The chips are not greasy at all (I would have liked the salsa to be a little hotter but its all good) and the burritos are a decent size. As in not the size of your head. The tacos weren't greasy either and the meat was really good. They do get really busy but they move through the lines fast. I like their system of the person who takes your order is the one who gets your food. So the same person helps you. Your ticket doesn't get lost among the masses. They are also very inexpensive.  There were three of us, three burritos, and two tacos and it was 20 bucks. That's what I'm talking about! There are two places to order, outside and inside. There are also three places to sit. Outside in the front, inside, and outside in the back. Even with all the seating they get packed so just be patient. People come and go quickly. The parking is a bit tricky because when they are busy there is no where to park because its not that big of a parking lot and each side is one way. Meaning you enter from one side and exit through the other. So be careful you don't come in the wrong way because the space between cars is small. You can park on the side street if you get lucky to find someone leaving. They do have handicap parking if you are in need. I can't wait to go back to this place for some more amazing 'good eats'. I'm drooling already just thinking about it.....

I think what makes Tito's so great is the salsa. Eat a taco, or whatever, with the salsa; then without the salsa. Pretty crappy without. My usual order is a beef and cheese taco, meat and beans burrito, upgrade the salsa to a medium, and a Sierra Mist. Comes out to about $6 or $7. Great food, just don't ever forget eat it with the salsa. One of my westside favorites for 10 years+

My parents fell in love with this place 30 years ago the way I've fallen in love with their tacos and burritos now. If you're looking for authentic Mexican, look elsewhere....God knows there are plenty of other places in the southland. But if you're looking for one of those quintessential LA dive eatery experiences, then this is the place. Stand in the line like everyone else, take in the characters and enjoy some very unique tacos. Super yummy!

Awesome place, a cornerstone of Culver City. I live in the aby area now and people I meet from the West LA area still rave about Tito's Tacos. Great Everything, fresh beans and rice, mild salsa thats more for flavor than spice, fresh cheese you name it. Overall great food. Park in the back , in the lot, on the side or wherever, its one of those places that started out as a hole in the wall and now pretty much has long lines inside and out for most of the lunch and dinner hours, but so worth it.

There was a time when I truly believed that the only thing better than a Tito's taco is two.  Best stoner food ever, right? Kinda.  After a few solid years of loyal taco'ing...  I find myself unable to ignore the voice in my head telling me that this meat is a mystery melange of cheap.  And it's mushy.  And kind of grey. But pass that joint back over here and maybe I'll reconsider.

I'm not really a fan of mexican cuisine and especially tacos but these were GOOOOD. The enchilada not so much (it's like a battle when you try to eat it with a plastic fork, and you don't really know what you're eating anyway coz it's completely drown in a soup) No good. Then they give you comlementary chips and salsa. Chips are hard but good, not oily. Salsa is ok (it's just blended tomato, with nothing else I think; it begs to add something to it). Guacamole is good too. cons: hard to find parking spot very long lines (or just slow service) - we had to wait almost 10min from the time we ordered and paid to get our meal in a box. seems like no one cleans that place during the business day I think I would give it 3 stars overall but let it be 4, coz those tacos were by far the best ones I had tried so far.

Titos tacos is a great place to get burritos, tacos, and enchiladas. When I go to titos, I don't go for the tacos, I go for the BURRITOS!!!! I always get two regular with with rice along with salsa and guacamole. The salsa and guacamole compliment the burrito so well and the chips are great. I try to stay away from burritos with cheese because they always put a mother load(even if you ask for a little) Overall Titos is delicious and I will always love their BURRITOS!!!!

This place is pretty much an institution, it would seem, and I can see why.  Tito's is exactly what it should be.  Cheap, simple, and satisfying. I don't think I understood why I enjoyed Tito's until I actually watched them make their tacos.  Regular corn tortilla, fill with beef, fold, then just deep fry the whole damned thing 'til crispy!  Load with lettuce and cheese (for an extra fee), and done.  What more do you need?  Maybe a strawberry soda, if I'm feeling randy! The parking and the line really are nightmares, but that's only because there's constantly a horde of people inside, and out, trying to get theirs, so they must be doing something right! Tito's is not exactly haute cuisine, and, unfortunately, they've clearly had to raise their prices at some point, but for a good, basic, meaty, beef taco, as long as you are willing to put up with the chaos, it's a fantastic alternative to options like the Bell.

Alright, I'm not rating this place high because it's a scene, or a hot new restaurant. Tito's Tacos is tried and true. Nothing fancy, no gimmicks, no fuss. Yes, the wait is long, but it's never more than 15 min. The tacos are yummy! Simple, but yummy. Lots of meat, lots of lettuce, and lots of cheese. The salsa is delicious, it's almost like they blended everything, and has a nice kick. The guacamole is delicious as well. Honestly, it's all delicious, and VERY, VERY affordable. Cheap & Delicious...can't beat that. The only thing better than a Tito's Taco? Is FOUR (for me).

Don't let anybody fool you. Man, these tacos are great! Let me tell you... the lines are huge, that alone speaks for itself.  Check out their website, their song and their menu at: http://www.titostacos.com This is LA's Taco Mecca, where all taco eaters must travel to. I'm not kidding you... If you say you're from L.A. you better have had a Tito's taco at somepoint in your life because otherwise... you're not truly an L.A. dweller.   The taco doesn't look like much. Sure it's a crispy shell stuffed with greasy shredded beef topped with fresh iceberg lettuce and yellow cheese shavings. But , when you put on their salsa... OMG - Heaven rushes your tastebuds. This is an all time favorite. Now, I only go there every couple of months because they're not healthy for you; but it's definitely a treat.

Ok,  let me be BRUTALLY honest and admit,  the food here sucks.  Yes, it does.  Why then give it 5 stars.  Because I grew up here and can't even begin to add up the number of times I ate here with friends and family (yes, even recently).  It's fast food at its finest.  Fast, and bad for you.  But I love the memories and hey, as Crocodile Dundee said in regards to the roasted Goanna " You could live off it, but it taste's like sh*t."   Those who go here are not looking for cuisine nor do they need it.  They are people looking for a bite to eat.  I want to disagree with one reviewer here and say I would be much happier having Tito's than McDonalds or In N Out as a choice between fast foods. Ohhhh,  and I almost forgot,  Tito's does things the old way which is one of it's many charms.  No you don't get much of a choice on the menu.  Nor did you get a choice at many places back in the day.  They do things the same way today as they have for the last 30+ years.  You want cuisine, you want selection.......here?.........go somewhere else.  You are truly spoiled looking for that in a place like this.

Disaster, Dichotomy, Depressing, Damn I am not usually one to follow the crowd, but when it comes to food, a long line is usually a harbinger of good things to come. Not at Tito's. Why so many people line up for generic, greasy, and gross tacos that have no flavor astounds me. If a restaurant ever displayed signs of suffering from abusive spouse syndrome this one takes it. People must realize how bad the food is, yet they keep coming back. Tito's was at the top of my  "why haven't I ever eaten there" list and after ordering 3 tacos, a chicken tamale and a root beer I was able to cross it off. The tacos have absolutely no flavor and talk about mystery meat, it's more of a paste and shares no resemblance no any meat you'd find in a decent taco. The Salsa is pretty much just pureed tomatoes, I'd rather smother my tacos in V-8 juice. No. gracias.

The key to Tito's success and the devotion it inspires is simple: There's nothing else that tastes like it, and even though finding superior, more robust tacos and burritos is very easy the truth is they can't replicate THAT taste. It's inimitable, it's flavorful, it's comfort food in its purest form. And anyone who's looking to attack Tito's for any perceived lack of "authenticity" needs a whack upside the head. Authentic as relative to what? The long lines, the lack of parking, the vast cross section of people, and the never-been-replicated taste are all authentic in and of themselves. In short, sometimes you don't want it done better. You want it done the way Tito's does it.

You must get it WITH cheese! The tacos here do not come with cheese standard. You have to add it on. A Titos taco without cheese is like train without tracks, cereal without a spoon, or an iphone without a finger. It totally makes the taco, so make sure you add it on.  2 tacos is honestly a minimum order. I've seen people order dozens. Their burritos are good too, but I always opt for the tacos. They put your food in these thin cardboard like In and Out style to go boxes with a top and a bottom. It's really convenient if you're getting it to go. Their salsa is famous in LA. A friend of mine makes a very good replica salsa at home, but it still doesn't compare. Overall, all the food is very good. There are only a few downsides to Titos. VERY hard to find parking. All the nearby businesses specify parking for their business, but if you want to risk it I guess you could.  Second thing is the line. This place is ALWAYS crowded. Be prepared to wait a minimum 20 minutes to get your food.  Third and final issue I have is cash only. There is an ATM right in front, but the fact they don't take cards is kind of a drag. Delicious tacos, cheese is a must, long wait. 4 stars!

People either love or hate this place. Like most things in life the truth is somewhere in between. This place is not fancy, the taco is simple - corn tortilla filled with shredded beef fried then they add lettuce and for a small fee cheese. This taco is not all that special it reminds me of a Jack in the Box taco, the difference being that I can identify the meat in the Tito's taco. The salsa is this watery tomato mess that I don't usually bother with, doesn't have much flavor or spice but if you find that the taco is dry it can help. I used to always get just taco's but I found that I like the burrito much better. I usually go for the all meat, the meat is once again beef but it is in a red chili sauce which is quite tasty. Again it isn't like "wow this is sweet ambrosia" its more of a "that was good I would eat it again" If you haven't been yet and are thinking of going because your friends rave about it, go in with low expectations and you will walk away happy maybe even pleasantly surprised. If you go in expecting pure awesomeness you will more then likely be disappointed maybe even angry. One last tip, since these tacos are fried meat and all they can be a tad greasy they do not travel well. Eat you tacos at the location to maximize your enjoyment.

Good tacos, with REAL shredded cheddar.  You can taste the quality of the cheese. Not a big fan of the shredded meat though.  I like ground beef only on my tacos, which they do not have.  It's a bummer that they only have one type of meat.  Still good though.

One of my biggest complaints about regular old taco places is that they never put enough into the taco.  And when I say regular tacos, I'm talkin good old ground beef tacos with lettuce and cheese.  You can't compare titos to another joint that offers carne asada tacos, because then, it's no comparison.  So you need to compare apples to apples.  Back to my review...I probably wouldnt' say that Titos has "the best" tacos around, but they're definitely good - they absolutely stuff these tacos with meat, cheese and lettuce - and to me, that makes for great tacos!  The enchiladas are a good choice too.   Don't forget the cash only and that it's not open late. As everyone else already said, prepare for long lines and a tough time parking.  I would suggest to park somewhere along Washington, because the parking lot is kinda tight.  It can get a little crowded, so you might be better off grabbing your carboard box stuffed with tacos and go eat somewhere else...there's a park about a mile west of there.

Taco-taco-burrrriiito! I've never had to wait in line for Tito's and I don't know that I would ever wait more than 15 minutes (time before and after placing order). The menu is limited which makes ordering fast and easy! Don't wait in line thinking they're going to be the best tasting, authentic mexican tacos. Tacos are yummy yummy -- basic, quick. Yummy seasoning and so good when fresh! And the refried beans are super scrump. I am 99.9% positive they must use real lard in the beans.

15 years ago i thought these tacos were amazing.  I went back this weekend though and was really unimpressed.  You wait in a long line for tacos stuffed with shredded meat that is unidentifiable, plain cheddar cheese, and watery and spice-less salsa.  I am still in shock at how bad the salsa was.  Maybe last time i covered the tacos in guacamole?  That certainly would have helped.  I know this place has been here forever, and it's one of those places that you should try once, but just be prepared to be disappointed.     The food is cheap, but that isn't enough to make me go back again (maybe in another 15 years).

I don't know what the 1 starers are all hating on. I love this place. I remember sitting on my dad's knee eating a taco, then stopping here whenever we visited my older brother in college and later having him take me here whenever I came in from Detroit. Cash only, but if you're SOL, they have an atm outside. The lines are pretty epic. It's just good old fashioned tacos, wet drippy mild salsa, and good times.

I love their tacos! I and I'm sure most of the people that live near this place have been coming here for years and if you haven't come you, you should. My favorite is their tacos and bean/ cheese burrito that comes with a yummy salsa/ chips and you can add a guacamole (I always do) or another hot green salsa they have. They have indoor outdoor seating, you'll be lucky if you find a parking spot in their lot right away and to the left/ front of them their is street parking. Also just f.y.i. its cash only. They have a small menu with all basic good things... come and Enjoy!

Nick took me here warning me that the tacos weren't that great.  But this place has become a staple in Los Angeles and there are some people who swear by this place he tells me.  So he wanted me to decide. Well, he did warn me. We came on a Sat night right before it closed.  Place was packed and we ordered 8 tacos and a meat burrito.  Cheese is $.50 extra per taco.  WTH?  I've never been to a place where cheese wasn't standard in a hard taco.  This was a first. We waited about 20 min and ordered then another 5-7 min and got our orders.  Glad the chips and salsa are free. Tried the chips and salsa first.  Salsa's pretty good.  Fresh, made that morning or same day-I'm sure.  Right away most Mexican places don't make their own salsa and it ain't fresh.  So I was happy about the chips and salsa. Had my first taco.  Now I was hungry, really hungry so the first taco tasted pretty good to me, but I knew this was my appetite talking.  I figured I'd know how good these tacos were after the 2nd or 3rd one.  Yeah, on the third one I was cursing as I had to finish another 2 tacos.  God, they were awful.  I mean seriously?  People think this is good food?  Nick commented that he thought Taco Bell could possibly taste better.  The only good things about the taco is they have their cooking technique down.  Hard tacos have a tendency to completely fall apart as you bite into them.  These tacos held together strong.  I was impressed by that, but the meat is unseasoned and dry. We split the burrito and it was also terrible.  Similar to something I use to have for school lunch back in elementary school.  Like some kind of Hungry-Man concoction in a tortilla.  Or it was identical to those microwavable burritos.  In fact, that's exactly what it tasted like. Please, please do not come here thinking this is a good representation of tacos.  Please.   And on top, this place is NOT super cheap.  For 8 tacos, a meat burrito with cheese in all of them and two drinks, the meal was more than $20 for the two of us.  $26 if I remember correctly.  That is not super cheap Mexican food.  Super cheap is if all that same food had cost half that amount.

Are you kidding me with the negative reviews?  Come to DC and try what they call "mexican" food here and then tell me what you think. I feel like I grew up here, I've loved this place since I was 19. This is the first place I go to when I get into LA. You step off the plane, drive to Culver City and get tacos.

Stretch out that jaw. Work it out a little bit. Make sure your jaw's in the fittest shape of its LIFE. The tacos & chips here can seriously wear you down when you're chomping for so dang long.  Bring a towel to wipe off that sweat from all the chewing, baby!  For about $2 a taco, you really can't go wrong.  The taste isn't so great, but you can't beat the value.  The shredded beef that they use in the taco isn't TOO flavorful, but I'm not gonna complain for the price I paid.  Be sure to get it with cheese! Chips aren't bad either!  What's super good is their freaking salsa.  WOW dude!  PRO-TIP!  If you want salsa in your taco, use your chips as a spoon.  It'll help out OH SO MUCH.  Burritos look delicious, but I never order one because I'm an idiot.  Maybe next time!  Ughhh THOSE REFRIED BEANS LOOK SO DAMN GOOD.  DAMNIT, I SHOULD'VE ORDERED ONE LAST NIGHT.  HNGHHHHH. If you're lucky to park in the lot, go for it.  If you can parallel park, even better.  Just don't park in the Johnny Pastrami's lot, or the one adjacent to Tito's.  Trust me kid, with the time it takes you to order (oooo those lines), your car will probably be loading up on a tow truck.  ...No bueno. Oh yeah, bring a friend, and have them on their A-game so they can table watch while you order.  You've been warned!

ZOMG. My mouth is watering just THINKING about eating here. Seriously, I can't imagine any place in LA that I'd rather eat at, if only given a few hours in the whole city. First impression: limited parking and lame square building. Don't let either of those bum you out because there's so much magic inside! There are two full counters. One is outside, with a few windows, and the other is inside. Sometimes one will be shorter than the other, so take a friend with you who you can leave in a line as you scope out the movement of the others. Inside there is limited seating, and there are a couple of picnic tables outside. Sit up cozy next to another party, if you want, or just take the whole thing home with you. The large sign inside has all the prices (cheap) and things you can order in very plain type. No pictures, no "dishes", just tacos, burritos, chips, dip, and drink. The burritos are monstrous, delicious, and very filling. But the best thing about them is their tacos. The tacos are corn tortillas that are hardened, add shredded beef, and then deep fried. DEEP FRIED! It gives a flavor to the whole taco that you just can't imagine. They top it with lettuce for you, but I suggest adding cheese. Their chips are also made on site, and are probably my favorite chips ever. I usually get a small side of guacamole (which is much more runny than most people are used to) and dip my chips in it as well as pour some on the tacos. 2.5 tacos and I'm usually done. So delicious. I top it off with an orange soda and my night is made. The bad: The building could do with an expansion, an upgrade in parking, and horchata. I know it's annoying to walk an extra 15 yards in order to get delicious double fried tacos, but believe me when I say it's completely worth it. And when I have a hankering for Tito's *with* horchata, I just pick some up on the way.

I know I'm in the minority group here and all my colleagues and coworkers beg to differ but I went to Tito's for the first time and I was severly disappointed. The meat wasn't as tender and succelent as people claimed and although the salsa was excellent, if the prices aren't especially great and the ambiance isn't unique, I will base food on the actual food, not on condiments that complement the food.  My friends who make a pilgrimage to this place tell me that it takes about three to four times before I become hooked... I'll have to take their word on it. I only tried the tacos so maybe I'm missing something crucial here but I would not come back. I am baffled why so many people continue to frequent this establishment but the owner seems to be a hard working man so I'm glad he has such a steady and loyal clientele.

Sure, this place is rather lame --- the never-available parking, those never-ending, exhausting lines, the non-existent seating most of the time, etc.   But it does attract the widest across-the-board clientele of any "restaurant" I know of, and just standing in line and listening in to the varied conversations and speech patterns is worth it, sometimes. I have to admit that every few months, I get a craving for their beef burrito and head down there to brave the crowds.  Like it or not, there really is no other place I know of that makes a burrito quite like that.  I know, I know, it is not authentic Mexican fare, yada, yada.  But you know what, it doesn't have to be.  There are plenty of authentic Mexican joints out there.  Tito's is its very own, and that has to be admired.  And there is a portion of the local population that grew up on the food and brings their kids and their grandkids there.  But there are others who cannot stand it and question its popularity.  This place is certainly either love or hate. A coupe of times over the years the food did not agree with me the next day, but I still go back.  It is what it is.

I've been to Tito's on several occasions. I'm never dissatisfied except with the fact that they don't accept credit card. It's the 21st century, I feel like we should accept cards almost everywhere now. Other than that the food is good. The atmosphere is okay. It's a pretty small place and parking is pretty limited especially if you come on a busy day (i.e. weekends, holidays, afternoon, night). The tacos are yummy and the salsa they serve with the chips is pretty good! I'd give it a try if you're looking for somewhere casual and yummy.

Some people are crazy about Tito's.  And if you need proof, just check out the line that is perpetually in front of this taco stand.  As for me, I enjoy Tito's from time to time, but not enough to overcome my distaste for the long wait and the chaos around the ordering window.  Also, they insist on giving change with 50-cent pieces.  What the hell are you supposed to do with those? It's worth mentioning that the chili burrito is quite tasty.  However, they are extremely hot - not spicy - HOT...as in temperature.  I don't know what they're trying to prove exactly, but...well, let the thing cool down and you'll save yourself a trip the emergency room.

It's greasy delicious tacos. The enchiladas grease could be drunk with a straw. It's not what you call, "healthy", but it is really tasty, especially the cheese, always get everything with cheese. The chips and salsa are pretty good too, salsa is a little watery, but it's spicy and tasty. At least try it once and complain about how it's not "authentic"!

There is only one in all of the country! You have to experience it for yourself. The tacos, the chips, the salsa...you leave craving more!

Too bad the prices have gone up, but tacos with cheese are still the best.  People are right, this is not your typical steet taco, it's TITO'S TACOS.  Their signature hard shells and chips are poured out of plastic garbage cans and shouldn't be compared.   Just add the salsa and guac, and it can't be beat!!! Long lines, trying to beat people out for a table, and a sketchy bathrooms are the only downsides. P.S: juicy meat = tender and delicious. the one stars must like their steak well done, bleh!

Waited in line for another 5-10mins to order. Waited for another 5-10mins for the tacos that I ordered and, it was nothing special about it... it was rather oily and indeed crispy.  The salsa was not to die for.  So can somebody tell me what the hype is?  I think it is the long line that creates curiosity.   "Not my cup 'o' taco"

Quick note on the tacos: The tacos are fried with corn and the meat is shreded beef only. That being said, they're pretty good for what they are. The meat and cheese burritos are good also.  They're small but filling. The salsa is good too. I usually get a taco with cheese, burrito with cheese, small chips and med salsa to go. My order never changes. I used to come here once a week when I lived in Culver City. They'd get 4 stars if they accepted credit cards and revamped the ordering system. It's too complicated when you're on the go.

The only thing better than 1 titos tacos is.... This place has had a suprising arch in regards to LA love. At first it was an undiscovered charm, then it was foodie favorite, a mainstream iconish sort of place, and now a quitely besmirked taco place ("its not authentic!"). They give you change in silver half dollars. How can that make you mad.

Alright! We get it! If you were born and raised here in Los Angeles, you were raised on Tito's Tacos.  You've developed a taste for it much like Australians and their vegemite.  Doesn't mean it's good!! The food here is awful! What's worse is there will be 100 people in line ahead of you and they all have terrible taste in taco stands. OH! OH! And one of these reviews just reminded me of something!

This is a ying and yang kind of place.  They have a huge following that goes to show you that "taste is in the bud of the beholder".  Thats what is great about restaurant reviews. You get such a wide variety of people and some love a place to death and others hate it.  How can that be?  So you just need to read them and see if you can zone in on if that reviewer is connecting to you and your "buds". So with that , here is my take on Titos. Did you know it was and is owned by a an old Jewish family?  Yes really.  Ahh you say, maybe that explains it's ying and yang thing. For me, the best item is the "meat" burrito.  It has very tender chunks of good quality beef in a very tasty sauce.  Not to spicy but with enough flavor to stay with you for a while and stain your fingers if you get it on you.  I do the meat and cheese.  Side of beans.  That way you get two scoops of meat instead of one.  If you dont want the meat, you can go for a bean and cheese burrito and ask for some "meat sauce" in the burrito. Sometimes they sneer at you, but this way you get a great extra bit of flavor.  And watching the servers make your food and fish around in the giant meat bin for just sauce is always fun.  They also use real cheddar cheese , not the authentic mexican stuff.  Again, remember "Jewish". Their chips are home made and thick and a bit greasy, but the thing I think most people are in love with at Titos is the SALSA.  The mild salsa used to be "help yourself". But to many people were just drinking cups of the stuff, literaly.  It is mild, made fresh with pureed tomatoes, onions and seasonings.  They have a spicy version, but the regular mild version is the winner.  You really can suck back a massive amount of this stuff.  Now again, it is not a "complex"  gourmet salsa that many new places now have.  This is the real basics but with the "basic" food it works.  Again, not for everyone.   The TACOS are in my opinion ok and something to get when you want something more generic or are loaded and dont want to get a burrito all over you.   You can power quite a few of these things down. They use a shredded seasoned beef in them, and some shredded lettuce and cheese if you want.  Top em with a crapload of salsa and it works, but there are many better ones out in the world. Also the guacamole is really a liquid that I find not worth having.  Again,  not authentic, but some people like it.   So go with the notion that it might not be for you, but it is not terrible.  It also is pretty cheap so you cant be pissed about spending a ton of money and having lousy food.   SECRET TIP about the lines.  They are almost always quite long.  You normally will wait about 15 minutes, which isnt too bad.  BUT if you want NO lines, the time to go is at 5:45 pm.  Everyone who has gotten off work at 5pm and stops there is already gone, and the folks who get off at 6pm have not shown up yet.  So if you dont want to wait on line on weekdays, that is when to go! Suck back some salsa my friends!

This place made me fat when i lived in L.A. (along with a couple of other choice restaurants... Versailles, Natalee Thai, or Bay City Deli anyone?!), so that's gotta mean something! LOVE the tacos.  Fresh and crunchy taco shell, tasty seasoned shredded beef, and cool lettuce.  LOVE the salsa.  Could be more thick, but "if it doesn't get all the place...".  LOVE the chips.  The tostadas are okay.  Skip the burritos, though. I always make a stop here whenever I'm in so-cal.

For most people, Titos is the place you had to grow up with or you might take issue with the style of food. Simply put, Tito's can be an acquired taste with deep fried tacos and watered down guacamole that pours from a metal pitcher. That being said, if you're from the Culver City and grew up on Titos, YOU DREAM ABOUT IT - YOU CRAVE IT. I moved from "The heart of screenland" and now live further south, but nearly every time I cruise near Tito's, I jam on the brakes and jump in line to score a box of grub. One thing you'll notice at Tito's is that no matter how long the lines are, everyone's happy. They just can't wait to eat. Tip - If any Tito's fan reads this and lives in Orange County, there's an old Tito's spin off in Anaheim called TOM'S TACOS. The Anaheim Tito's was started there 22 years ago. The guy who runs it now, bought it 12 years ago and changed the name. The original Tito's manager still runs the place, so they have the EXACT SAME FOOD as Culver City, without the lines. Tom's is at the intersection of Beach & Ball Rd. It's just north of the 22 Freeway on Beach.

Yes they are greasy and meaty, guess what? Its MEXICAN food! I am Mexican and I challenge people to name me a dish that isn't greasy, meaty or both! Granted its not "authentic" Mexican, but hey it comes pretty damn close. I think the only thing that makes it not authentic is the abundant use of cheddar cheese. The only CON to this place is parking. Other than that TITOS ROCKS!!!

Humans are strangely attracted to lines. So, I see a 20 - 30 minute queue for a taco stand and simply must stand in it. I was underwhelmed the first time. The second time I was whelmed. By the third time, it was too late, it's crack in a hard shell. I challenge you to eat it 3 times in one month and then try to tell me it's only "all-right."

Let me begin by saying Tito's is an institution. I have been eating there since we moved to the outskirts of Culver City in the mid-80s. If you are expecting authentic Mexican Tacos, with carne asada and chunky salsa you will be very disappointed. Tito's is not in competition with La Huasteca or other sit down Mexican restaurants. Nor will it compare to the Taco trucks that crisscross LA. Tito's has its own style of Mexican fast-food. A few warnings, CASH ONLY! Hard to believe sometimes with the volume of sales, but they really are all cash. Parking is tight, but the turnover is so fast that you should be fine after a few mins of waiting. Don't let the lines fool you, they move very fast whether you are outside or inside. To be honest, after going there for 3 decades I have only tried 3 menu items: All-Meat Burrito - Tasty and juicy. It's basically stewed meat (very tender) in a mole sauce, but not like the mole sauce you see in the market or at Guelagetza. It has much less flavor, but is definitely enough to make it worth having. The beans and rice are nothing spectacular which is why I have always stuck with all-meat. Taco w/cheese - They are generous with the cheese, and they should be for the price. The tacos are oily (greasy implies fried in lard which they are not) but they also have a good crunch. Pour some guacamole and/or salsa and these are really quite tasty. Enchilada - I like the enchiladas, the sauce poured over them has a good flavor and goes great with the chips. Other than that the Salsa is really good. Some would call it watery, and it is that, but it is almost completely tomato which is what really makes it great. Make a little extra effort and scoop out the good stuff from the juice. It's worth it. The Guacamole, I find tasty. It is not chunky, but on the burritos and tacos it works really well. As a contrast to those on here who say it is horrible, it really is not. Just don't think it's going to be great authentic Mexican food, it's a great alternative to Del Taco and Taco Bell, but not a substitute for Paco's. Oh...and if you order a lot of tacos (not sure exactly how many) they give you a large bag of chips and large salsa free. Happy Eating!

So I'm a born and raised California girl. I love Mexican food. Like LOVE Mexican food. But I'm confused as to what Mexican food is as there are so many different Mexican restaurants each with their own recipes. That said, I don't care for Tito's Tacos. Too greasy, not a lot of flavor, definitely a one note flavor. I try everything twice and Tito's is no exception. But I wont be going back for thirds.

Tito's Tacos is one of those spots that you're gonna have to try at least once so people will stop saying "oh my god, you've never been to Tito's Tacos?"  It's a Los Angeles staple.  That being said, I've eaten at dozens of other better Mexican restaurants and taco trucks that I would choose over Tito's on any given day.  The menu is pretty limited and everything on it is very filling and tastes just fine but nothing spectacular that warrants the ravingly positive word of mouth this place gets.  Also, there is always, always a discouragingly long line.  They usually move it pretty quick but on more than one occasion I've given up and just gone to the Mexican restaurant next door.  My wife and I live just down the street so Tito's Tacos is convenient, but if we lived further away I probably wouldn't bother making the trip.

Not a fan of the enchiladas.  But with the word "Tacos" in the name you kinda need to go for the tacos.  Shredded beef, iceburg lettuce, shredded cheddar, and a crispy shell.  They're pretty good.  And the salsa tastes pretty fresh. I was tempted to make this a 3-star but whenever my office-mates go there and offer to bring back some Titos I cannot resist.  So while it may not be the most amazing food there's just a je ne sais quoi - some indescribable force that causes me to say yes to any invitation to eat a Titos Taco.

The Bad: Parking sucks, it is busy (usually), the way you get/ pay for your food is weird, the meat is mysterious. Ok, now the good: The mystery meat is yummy especially when drenched with the salsa, the tacos are different than most tacos in LA, the chips and salsa are yummy and I can eat a whole box of them, the way they box your food up is a nice touch (although I am sure its no good for the environment), and finally, most importantly, they are addictive. Get ready to crave Tito's.

The tacos here are pretty cheap and I find myself craving them often because it's so close-by.  I always order the guacamole (tasty) and free chips come with every order.  The taco shell is pretty thick, and I like it because of the great crunch.  The shredded beef isn't moist, but that's why I always order my tacos with cheese and add guac.  A friend ordered the tamales before and wasn't impressed.  My bf has the burrito and didn't want to order it again -- no carne asada or anything.   If you go during a busy mealtime, there is a long line, but never when I go.  Also, piece of advice:  BRING CASH.  They do not take credit cards and the ATM outside of the restaurant charges $3 or something like that if you use your debit card.

This place sucks balls. How the hell did so much hype ever get built up around such a dump. This is crap that tastes like the stuff college students buy in the frozen food section by the ton. Everyone I know who ever has to travel to or from the west side at some point says, "Hey let's go to titos!" The first time i stood in line for like 25 minutes...These are crap tacos you can buy at any of the cheap restaurants all over LA that serve 1/4 burger specials. If there's ever a get together I attend within an hour of the place, someone will walk in with a bag of this crap, and everyone in the room gets all happy...why?

Meh.... They really do nothing special. Oily everything. Taco's are the most boring, bland... For how much money they probably spend on that really bad commercial they should hire new management.  Anyone who has 5 stars for this place must had sucked on hot coal before tasting this food or your taste buds have died.. The guacamole!!! Are you kidding me!?!?!?!?!?!?! Blahhhhhh! Watered down guac... mmmmm. ( I make a disgusted face every time I think about their guacamole) If you look at any of the pictures people post all you see is CHEESE, CHIPS AND WATERED DOWN SALSA!!

The commercials on tv got me to try it.  What a mistake! I'm not trying to be racist... but when you walk into a place for the first time and see a long line full of old white men at a taco shop, you're probably not getting the most authentic food.   The tacos were bland (even the yellow shredded cheese on top had no flavor, i'm not sure how that is possible). The salsa was bland.  The chili was bland.  The chicken tamale was bland.  Where's Emeril Lagasse to kick it up a notch when ya need him?! Just get two 99 cent tacos at jack in the box. They taste better. If you must go: free parking lot, cash only

Tito's Tacos, are the tacos that I use to rate all others. That simple. If Culver City could only be known for one thing (and lets face it, it really isn't famous for anything, look it up on google) it should be for Tito's. Sure parking can be a pain, but really if you learn how to park on the street, this really isn't an issue. If you are expecting a Taco Bell on a plate experience, go elsewhere. If you are serious about filling a taco craving, prepare to order and gorge. I plan my trips to the LA area with Tito's in mind, with the goal of squeezing in as many visits as possible.

My mom Loves Tito's!!! Is it the best thing since sliced bread probably not. But is it something that I love, it sure is! My mom grew up in LA but no longer lives here so any time she visits my grandpa she goes out her way to make sure that she has a taco from Tito's. It must be a cult thing, because I feel like you either love it or you hate it. I love it and I guess that's all that matters. P.S. I had my encounter with a celebrity here. I wont say exactly who, but Tito's was her and her families first stop when they got back from a tour in London. When they found out they had a long layover back to Utah (after flying into LAX), they rented a car and took the first chance they could to get to Tito's. Pretty cool cause she was standing in line right behind me.

Titos Taco. It's ok, but if there's a line, avoid it at all costs. Although the food is really really cheap, I don't think its worth the wait. I would usually pass this place by it on Washington while I'm riding and sometimes I'll just stop by to grab a bite to eat. Their Taco and Burrito isn't exactly the highest quality but it is certainly cheap. You'll eat very well under $5 which is not bad. But the line can get ridiculously long especially during lunch time. Just remember this is a cash only place and the price includes tax which is not bad. I know exactly how much money to bring without looking around for some change. This is an ok place. Can't say it's the greatest place I had though. Their chips and salsa is pretty good. There so much better places in LA to eat, while not as cheap, but obviously much better quality.

I go here because my husband is a fan of this place.  Food is okay.  Definitely not melt-in-your-mouth or the best mexican food around.  Last time I was here, I squirted hand sanitizer directly into my husband's left eye, and he screamed aloud in pain.  I know my husband will be reading this review so I want to tell him again that I am sorry and it was not intentional.  People, be careful with hand sanitizer.  It was one of those final-destination freaky moment.

I must admit that I am a bit sad to write this review because I grew up just five minutes from this veritable institution of LA culture, and I definitely associate it with home. That being said, the only time I really enjoy the food is after a night (or afternoon) of drinking with buddies who haven't been here before. The meat is often quite bland and most of what they offer is lacking that certain something. Ah yes, flavor. This is definitely not authentic Mexican food and sometimes I feel like it survives on reputation alone and the ignorant (OK...uninformed) people who believe that coming here constitutes obtaining "Authentic" Mexican food. If you want  "Authenticity," there are plenty of other places, several in this area even, that taste much better but may not be "sanitary" enough for your needs.

I think i would of broken a tooth if i had tried to eat more :Q :) haha....Anyways I also didnt like the fact the the cashier apart from taking your order also prepares and expedites the order!

Tito's makes the greatest burrito in the world.  Period.  There is nothing better.  My parents discovered Tito's in the 60s when they were attending UCLA.  We've been going there often every since. They make their burritos using beef brisket and they are not to be missed.  The tacos are really good, too, but I could go on endlessly about the burritos. Tito's is the only thing I actually miss in Southern California, having moved away in 1998.  I always stop in to have a burrito whenever I am passing through SoCal, though. Don't miss it!

We go at 8:30pm, line is out the door. Note: I am not a local, but love mexican food. From the couple in front of us, we were told to get the tacos and burritos and everything must be with the cheese. The service is nothing to write home about, but the prices and fried goodness was good. I give it 4-stars to support a local establishment, but I probably won't go back unless someone else wants to go.

At this point it's been nearly a year since I was lucky enough to consume one of Tito's tacos and I remember it like it was yesterday... (*cue music*) I was a little girl frolicking through the southern California maze of businesses and restaurants just hoping for an excellent taco when Senor Tito said to me, "try my tacos." I said yes and the love affair lasted for nearly two years. Now whenever I'm searching for decent Mexican food on the streets of New York I shout, "Titos!" but, alas, he never answers me.  He had to stay in Culver City while I had to move on. We shall meet again, Mr. Tito, I'm just not sure when. No, but really. All kidding and silly stories aside - I LOVE Tito's Tacos! The line is almost always out to the sidewalk, but it goes fast, so don't worry. Make sure to order your tacos with cheese because they don't come with cheese (an extra .40 cents each, I think?). However, they will come with homemade tortilla chips and salsa. I also recommend the guacamole. You can tell it's homemade, too, because it's always excellent but never exactly the same.

Oh yes. Tito's. I love this place. It's  a MUST for anyone in the LA area or even visiting LA. I'll keep it short, as one or two people have already reviewed this fine eating establishment. First of all, it's not a fine eating establishment. It's a freakin' shack. Second - the employees act like they are indentured slaves. It's awesome. They go through the motions - no hurrying here to get your food. And don't expect a smile. Third - don't question what kind of meat is in your taco. Just enjoy the taco. Fourth - I don't personally get the tacos. I LOVE their burritos. I asked for a rice, bean and cheese burrito today with no meat, and I got meat, rice bean and cheese. It was delicious. The meat in the burrito is much better than in the taco. Fifth - I love their damn frothy salsa The only bad part of Tito's is they serve Pepsi products. I hate Pepsi products. Also, if you are really brave, the enchilada is awesome. Just make sure you have toilet paper in the house the next day. BONUS: You are likely to get a fifty cent piece (fiddy cent, if you will) if you get change at Tito's. FYI - CASH ONLY at Tito's.

I LOVE Titos! Too bad I am now Pescatarian. But before, I would always go. The best thing from Tito's Tacos is ironically TACOS! Lmao. Get a couple tacos with cheese, some chips, and guacamole, and your set for a delicious meal! Just don't expect to be going to have a quick authentic meal. There will be a 10-20 minute line and it's definitely Americanized. But who cares, it's great! The only reason why I can't give Tito's the 5th star is because, it's usually hard to find parking and the wait to order. Other than that, no complaints from me! Go get some tacos!

I went to Tito's Tacos for a little greasy taco goodness and was not let down.  This place is tucked near an overpass in Culver City and is notorious for having long lines. I got lucky - I parked directly in front of the place and only waited maybe 5 or 10 minutes to order. First things first - this is an LA institution, with cheap Mexican food put together by who I'm hoping are Tito's sisters and aunts.  The tacos are tasty - I went with two beef w/cheese.  Anybody that would say no to a mound of cheese on a taco isn't allowed to roll with me.  I liked them - crunchy and good. I also tried a chicken tamale, which wasn't bad and a little dry (sauce to go with it fixed the problem, very nice).  I didn't get guac (what was I thinking?) but I did enjoy the salsa - not blazing hot but definitely had character to match the other food. Is it the best Mexican food in the world? No.  But that isn't why you're there.  You're there because it's a tradition, something that you may have done with your dad, or wished you had.  You'll get better Mexican at a taco truck, I won't argue that, but sitting on a park bench on a sunny day chomping on cheap and decent tacos is legit, y'all. You are at Tito's Tacos because sometimes you are okay with admitting that the fact that it's greasy and bad for you is the part you dig the most about the whole experience.  So I dig Tito's Tacos.  It's not bad, the price is right and it would be wrong to not appreciate at least a little bit the food institutions in the places you live and visit. A word about the complaints about the lard and the grease.  Are you kidding me?  I only understand because it's a stupid and ridiculous California thing.  What the hell do you think people use to cook in Latin America, free-trade organic vegetable based shortening?  If you don't like admittedly greasy food, why are you knowingly going to a place that serves exactly that?  Go get a grip, or a Cobb salad.

I think that Tito's is good for what it is (whatever THAT may be...Americanized Mexican food?). It's like after eating authentic, homemade Vietnamese food day after day, I sometimes want something bastardized like Panda Express. Ya know what I mean, jelly bean? I love the generous heap of shredded cheese (this is the case when too much cheese on the taco is a good thing). It's too bad that they don't have sour cream though...best to eat it at home where I can add it. Parking - horrible Ordering - horrible and confusing. Mr. Big B's suggestion would be good to remember. Also, make sure that you don't mistake a SHE for a HE, or vice versa...it happens.

Ok so after reading some other reviews I would like to say that all you need to do is go to http://www.titostacos.co… and listen to their theme song....how can people hate this place?! The lines are usually long, so all you low rating haters I'm glad you don't like it, more room for me! My dad is a Tito's hater, so for most of my life I had never tasted the joy that is a Tito's taco. You gotta try it, if you hate it you hate, but at least you can say that you tasted a piece of the Angelino experience. You can't come to LA without trying it. Make sure to also get some guacamole, it makes a huge difference. PS tip the staff person helping you, they work their butts off!

Wow, i'm surprised this place doesn't have a higher rating on Yelp. I guess i'm not the only one that realizes what this place is for real and not just listening to the hype. I mean, the food is relatively good and the prices are pretty cheap. The only things i can complain about are: 1. The service - You almost feel like this place is the Mexican version of the soup nazi, or in short, the mexican nazi. There are these ladies sitting behind the counter and you go up and order and ask questions and they pretend they don't know what you're talking about. They don't smile, they don't reply with more than one word... it's kind of intimidating. 2. The order taking - They never seem to get the order right. I said "Meat burrito" and she said "All we have are hard tacos". And i said, "I said burrito" and then she said "Cheese?" then finally i said one more time "Burrrrrrito" and then finally she got it. Then i also ordered a beef enchilada and they ended up giving me a cheese enchilada which was disgusting and i felt my arteries clogging up as i ate some of it. 3. Waste - This place produces waste like no other. I mean, i'm not sure if there some other way to distribute the food but there has to be some way of recycling all the boxes they give out. I mean, the garbage can was filled with boxes and stuff... it was ridiculoso. Overall, the food isn't that great. Don't let the long lines fools you. There are definitely better mexican food restaurants in LA for sure. The only item i would recommend from Tito's is the meat and cheese burrito. It's slimy but good. The enchilada and tamales, not so good. And i'm a fan of soft tacos, not hard shelled like they have there. I think Jack in the Box has equally good tacos for a fraction of the price.

If you're looking for authentic Mexican Tacos, Titos is the place!  Get the original tacos with cheeeeeese. Everything else...was just A-OK.  Nothing I couldn't live without.   Enchilladas were yummy but very salty. All Beef Burrito with Cheese was aiiite Tamale was ok GUAC was terrible. Rice was not great Honestly, I would totally go back and keep going back, but would only order the Tacos with cheese.  THAT I couldn't get enough of.

Eeeshh... I want to give this place a positive review.  I've eaten at Tito's quite often enough as it is.  I was actually introduced by a Mexican friend, who knows good Mexican food, has taken me to great Mexican restaurants, and for some reason she also likes this place.  Look, I'm no snob... I eat Taco Bell on a regular basis and I really like it.  But this place is an overglorified, uber-successful and lower tier version of Taco Bell. The food is... I admit it now... bland.  The burritos are watery.  The meat is soupy and has a weird chewiness to it.  That's not to say I won't eat here.  Everyone should try this place if you happen by it.  I'm just saying that it's a very successful, highly recommended restaurant that serves bad food. Now that you've read this split personality review, you might be confused.  I know I am.  Well, next time I'm in the area, if a buddy wants to get Tito's Tacos... I'm in.

I first heard about this place years ago after watching their catchy commercial on t.v.  The first time I tried Tito's I didn't think it was that good.  The tacos were so-so nothing special, but the place was packed! Since I was in the area, I decided to give them another try.  As it was the first time, it was very busy with no parking in their small lot!  I had to park along one of the side streets and walk around the block.  They had a line inside and outside with both just as long.  I decided to order outside with the line stretching out to the curbside. I ordered 6 Tacos w/Cheese @ $2.35 each and an All Beef Burrito w/Rice & Cheese for $5.90   They also gave me a bag of chips & salsa. The tacos were hard shell with shredded beef filled with lettuce and cheese (.60 extra)  The burrito had a lot of meat and had rice & cheese inside  The meat in the burrito was very salty, but tasted good.  The tacos were better than I remembered.  I liked the shredded cheese on top, it was fresh and made the otherwise bland taco taste okay. I would only come back if I was in the area, I don't like their lack of parking and the huge long lines.

I finally got to visit Titos Tacos for the first time ever..!!!!! My friend Richard had just gotten off of the plane from Aeronautics Flight Academy in Daytona Beach, FL and he and his brother Myke met with me at my office (right next to LAX). We decided to take the street back to Burbank to get away from traffic. But we were starving. Myke suggests, Tito's Tacos, i scream Aaaaayayayayayaaaaahhhhhhhh RRRRRRRaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh..... ahem.... sounds good. So we drive down Sepulveda at 3pm, and we hit traffic. Damn it, it took an hour and a 1/2 to get there. But the tacos were mmm mmm yummy..!!! hahaha i ordered 3 tacos, and 3 tamales ooooh yeah. The Tamales were amazing but the tacos were too crunchy. I guess some like it that way but im more of a taco truck kinda guy. it was cool though, everything there was extra cheesy-gooey which means its extra yummy. I would def recommend this place for the bottomless pit type of eaters with strong teeth and jaw bones........................... who love cheese.

When I first moved out here a friend of mine came up from out of town to visit on his way out of the country.  We needed something late night and didn't know what was open.  My roommate mentioned this place. There was a huge line and the food was all cheap.  The place was a madhouse of people running back and forth.  It's a dive.  I'm not sure why this place is so popular. So we get back after our haul to veg out.  The food is greasy, the chips don't all taste right.. and am hour or so after that we look at each other before running to fight for the bathroom.

Friends and I used to go here when we were students at UCLA.  The food is pretty standard and consistent.  Does everyone like their salsa?  Well, they certainly don't give you enough of it when you take food to go. The location isn't the best as it's close to the Freeway overpass.  It's noisy and you might get mugged so don't park too far away.

Tito, I used to love ya but since you done went and raised prices your tacos are now $2.20 each (seriously, .50 for cheese, and what kind of taco doesn't have cheese).  Your tacos have five star junk food taco flavor but now they are too expensive for what they are, minus one star.  The obese woman working behind the counter that insisted on not serving us next (even though we clearly were) because we were on one side of the railing instead of the other, minus one star.  Still not accepting credit cards, minus one star. To add insult to injury, the kingdom of Culver City has now erected parking meters all around your hut, lame because your parking lot still sucks.  Also, serve Coca-Cola products, Pepsi sucks too.  Grrr!

I'm a fan of Titos because of the taste of the food. I love the crunchiness of their nachos and tacos and the salsa that comes with it. The cheese on top is melted too! I've only tried their beef tacos, so next time I go back I'll try something different. Sometimes my managers at work will order a large batch of tacos and nachos for the entire office, so I've never experienced the long lines. If you order over $75 of food you can put in an order via email; they only ask for 3 hours notice. Put in the order in the morning and pick it up in time for lunch! The one time I have gone to eat at Titos was later in the night; the lines weren't that bad and service was pretty fast. We ate outside since it was a nice night.

I've almost gotten in fistfights in attempts to get at the counter at Tito's.  That's good stuff. Tacos are the best.  Burritos rock.  It's simple, meat and cheese and beans.  The place pulls no punches and it's a winner just for that.

As I said in another review, a Mexican restaurant is only as good as its salsa.  Tito's salsa is bizarrely fantastic.  It's not the freshest.  It's not the thickest (it's actually quite watery).  But for some reason, it really works.  I love dunking my whole taco in it. I see a lot of people hating Tito's for what it's not, rather than enjoying what it is: cheap, greasy, remarkably unhealthy, but oh so delicious. The lines can be long, but, unlike Pink's, they move really fast.   They've got other stuff on the menu, but get:  Tacos.  Salsa.  Soda.  The end.

Tito's I guess is an institution of some sort. Every time I drive by, there are lines and lines of people outside. I wonder why. The best thing about Tito's tacos is that they are cheap and they have a nice tasty salsa. Other than that they are forgettable. The meat is bland and the tacos honestly don't taste very good unless you drown them in salsa. I have tried their burritos too. I at one point thought they were good, but too heavy for my sensitive stomach. The red sauce on the meat was very tasty. So to sum it up, I would only go here if there was no line and I don't have money money to go to Johnnie's Pastrami which is located on the same block.

I've been going to this place since grade school when my mom would take us here to get dinner after school. I'll give you this- their tacos are awesome! They taste pretty fresh compared to other taco spots or street vendors. I also like the fact that you get chips and salsa with anything you order. The bad: Anything else besides their tacos is not-so-good. The burritos and tamales are very runny making the whole thing fall apart after a couple bites. Additionally, there is ALWAYS a line. I don't really have a problem with that, it's more the way that their system works. You wait in line and when your up at the counter you order, and the same person who takes you order, goes and makes your food. I think it would be much more efficient and smooth if they handled this differently. Also, no cards- cash only! Don't expect to give them much (if any) of a tip, because they don't smile and their service is boring. I like Tito's tacos and only their tacos.

It's really good for the "I know it's crispy, deep fried tacos but I'll have it once in a while" type of way.   I'd never wait in line (hubby is the one who goes and waits - who am I to say no?) for this place, but once every couple of months the tacos & soupy enchiladas hit the spot.  I ate at the restaurant once, and surprisingly I still like the food.  That's said because the place doesn't necessarily have that Spring Fresh feel, though they do consistently have an "A" rating so take-home it is.   Hit me baby one more time with a 6-pack of tacos with their runny but somehow perfect combo of salsa and I'm smiling all day.

One word "overrated"! The tacos are good, I've had better, but they are a nice size.  The problem I have with them is that they're real greasy and the meat isn't all that flavorful. The burritos? I haven't had the burritos in years, but I do remember I wasn't very satisfied. This place reminds me of Ramona's, but Ramona's is a lil' better. If you're looking for a quick fix, decent food, and cheap prices...this is your spot.

I've been coming here since I was little boy. The place has not changed a bit. The burritos are the best. Even though the burrito can get messy, it's worth it because just the smell of it makes you not care about cleaning your mouth.  The tacos are also great if you add the salsa on them. The place is always full with customers, but it just shows how many people are loyal to this spot.

I must be missing something. I have heard more than a few people rave about this place but I just don't see what's so special. I went with a friend on a weekend afternoon. There was a huge line and the parking was a little scary because Tito's is right by a freeway overpass. Their mini-lot was packed so I had to park on a residential street and walk over. The cars driving by were obviously in 'freeway' mode and speeding by like they were being pursued by the po-lice. It was like playing human Frogger. Not ideal. We had  their signature cheese tacos, a side of rice, and a chicken tamal. Not bad at all, but nowhere as amazing as it's described. Honestly, I'd rather stick with Jack in the Box or Del Taco tacos for fast food. It's decent, but I wouldn't drive here again just for the food.

I like Titos.  The only thing I ever get is the Meat/ Bean / Cheese burrito...i usually get 2! Yes..because im a pig! The only thing I have ever tried is one of their tamales..but it was very dry!  I felt like I was trying to eat a plate of sand w/o any water around! So ..i'll stick w/ the burritos and their free chips and red salsa which I pour completely over my burritos or if im feeling frisky..I'll dip my burrito in the salsa bowl when no one is looking!  (sounds dirty...doesn't it) Ive only actually been to Titos once myself to order food...I usually jump on the bandwagon when I hear someone is making a Titos Run! Oh yea..the ordering and paying and getting your food is a big mess! So ..i let someone else go get it....lol!

NOT WORTH THE WAIT. my friend and I went on a rainy day thinking that there would be less people in line. Well, we were wrong. Don't get me wrong; when i see long lines I get really excited because I expect the food to be AMAZEBALLS. we waited in clusterf**k of a line for about 15 minutes only to find out they only had one choice of taco. whatever i'll try it! Hold on, let me try to explain to you what the line situation is like there. There are 3 rows of lines. After you order you are supposed to move off to the side and wait for your order and pay. ... BUT THERE'S NO WHERE TO MOVE OFF TO THE SIDE TO. (especially inside) so everyone just ends up standing way too close to each other waiting for their food. We waited probably 10 minutes more for our food and change since there's only ONE REGISTER and about 6 lines. We hurried home and opened the box to be greeted with tacos that suspiciously looked like they were from Jack in the Box. I bit into it... WTF! the tacos from jack in the box are even better than this. the meat sucks. the taco shell sucks. they used disgusting processed cheese. and for those who say "well it's cheap" ALL TACO PLACES ARE CHEAP. i say take you $1.25 and find a different joint cus this place stinks.

Hey, it's Tito's.  Go there. I've been going there for 30 years.  It hasn't changed in any significant way.  How do you improve perfection anyway? Note, non-beef eaters will not find any meat to eat.  Vegetarians will eat rice, beans and cheese only. Not a place for people looking for vegetables.

After posting a review a couple months ago, I have returned for round 2! Why don't all you suckers who give this place 1 star go back under the rock from which you crawled out from! Tito's is a Mexican place that serves taco's, take it for what it is! Only get the tacos! It is not a 5 star fancy restaurant.. Maybe people have different ideas of what "authentic" really means! BUT next time, please look behind the counter and see that there is a short little Mexican lady that cooks the food. This is how a lot of Mexicans cook their tacos. If you only see white people in line, you must be color blind because I see Mexicans in line all the time, including me and my husband! It really doesn't matter in the end though, because just like many of you have noticed...... They are not going out of business anytime soon!  :)

Oh, my I'm going to have to be sacrilegious again--yet another legendary, mythic food spot that everyone always raves about, but, I finally get up there to try it, and well, um....meh. Titos has been around for decades, in fact it used to be next to Johnny's pastrami, but moved to it's present spot, when their original building got turned into a Taco Bell for awhile, and then a Lucy's for awhile (yeah I'm old, and grew up in CC). Somehow I never went there, I liked Lucy's well enough, and growing up my parents liked other local places like Canton Kitchen and Villa Italia, so as a kid without the decision making power I didn't get up there, and as a grown up, I had my set of favorites in the area (I still miss Larry's BBQ on washington, anyone else remember that)? I never tried Tito's mostly because whenever you go by there you see that line. So finally I ventured over (the line by the way moves pretty quick) and ordered some tacos getting ready for an authentic mexica.....oh wtf hard shells? Sigh. Well they smell pretty good....and they were...OK, but for the price...kind of small. As a fat man that loves his food, an important thing to me is the price/to portion/to greasiness level. I like spicy greasy food. I like big portions (because first, I'm usually pretty hungry and second, you can get a couple of meals off that $12 or whatever you just spent). So, the bottom line...it was...OK. Since I stay in the south bay, I would not make a special trip up there. As one person said, for hard shell tacos and blah burritos, there's taco bell (where you can still get a big sack of food and a large drink for like $8, by the way). Not recommended (sorry fans).

Tito's Tacos is one of THOSE joints in L.A. that's famous for who knows what reason. It's not like the food there is stellar, or super authentic, or even a great value. But it's sort of like crack and I love it. Definitely a place to try at least once, and they've been pretty consistent for the past few years I've been eating there. The menu is brief; none of this "chicken or beef or veggie?" kind of deal. It's all just one selection. Anything with their shredded-beef-in-sauce is delicious, like their meat and cheese burritos, which are my favorite in town. The tacos are, of course, delicious, and I'm an especially big fan of the enchiladas, which are made with fat tortillas, and plenty of sauce, cheese, and onions. The onions definitely give it an extra bit of flavor, and as a bonus, the enchiladas heat up fantastically as leftovers. I always get one to save for lunch the next day. Tito's will always give you a box of chips with your order, and they put something on them, because they're like crack. (Actually, they're probably fried in lard, which is why they're so tasty.) And then there is the salsa. It's blended (like, in a blender), and it can throw people off who are expecting some kind of pico de gallo, but despite its watery, foamy look, it's actually pretty delicious. Their guacamole is another thing. It's a watered-down avocado paste, and now they give you a tiny freaking cup of it (guacamole is extra when you order here), so it's not really worth it. The location is less than ideal. There's hardly any parking and people will be dicks and sit in the lot to wait for spots while their buddies go stand in line. There's always a huge line, but it goes relatively fast. And they only take cash. If you forget, there's an ATM right there, but there's always that pesky $3.00 fee. There's also a way to order inside, but I've randomly found it to go slower than the line outside, even if it looks bigger. Despite the random drawbacks, Tito's holds a small, lard-fried place in my heart. If you're looking for an alternative to Del Taco or Taco Bell, try this place. Or if you're in college.

We came by here for dinner after driving by a bunch of times and reading many positive reviews on Yelp. I had 1 chicken taco and 2 beef tacos. I have to say they were inexpensive and pretty tasty. I wasn't a fan of the odd lines but that just comes with the place. I found the taco shells and chips to be way too crunchy for my taste. I'm guessing they were just way too overdone. Seriously, I felt like my teeth were going to break. I'm not by any means an expert on authentic Mexican food, but I won't be in a hurry to come back and break the rest of my teeth on their tacos. I heard their burritos are excellent so I may try those next time I need Mexican food in the area. Parking can be annoying since the place is packed and the lot is small. It may be easier just to park on the street on Sepulveda. They take cash only but have an ATM outside. Seating inside is limited, but they serve food in handy boxes you can take with you back home or to eat in your car if that's your thing.

I don't know what to tell you. A MUST TRY!!!!!!! Tito's Tacos is not only classic and unique, their food is very good. You always get chips and salsa (Mild) with all of your orders. You can place your orders inside the restaurant too. I personally like my burrito ALL MEAT. Their salsa is too mild for my taste so I always under the hot salsa too. The Tacos are hard shell, so don't  expect soft corn or flour tortillas. The Tacos are very unique, believe many people get confused with the tacos. If  you aren't from the L.A. area it will be very hard to understand how good this place is. It would be utterly insane to try to compare Tito's to any other Mexican food or your typical Mexican Tacos. Someone mentioned and try to compare them to King Taco (Hands down best Tacos in L.A.), that is an unfair and stupid analogy as they are two completely kind of tacos, is like trying to compare a hot dog with a sausage.

After newly moving to the Los Angeles area we were asking friends about where to get some great mexican food. The consensus seemed to be GO TO TITOS!. So of course trusting our friends, we did. And oh boy how did we regret that decision... When we first pulled up and parked I had a feeling of uneasiness. It looked dirty. I am all for the little taquerias that have an authentic feel but this was just gross. We look at the menu, which is extremely minimalistic. That should be a good sign as you would expect with so few items they should be really good at execution and taste. Hmmm, not so here. There were so many beans and a disgusting glop of cheese in a tortilla. We asked for sour cream to be added and were told they don't have sour cream. Um ok, WTF?, Then we asked for guac to be put on. They told us we would have to buy a side for like $3. And they wouldn't even put it in the burrito. Needless to say, neither one of us finished and while we were eating I kept thinking how Taco Bell actually makes a better burrito. The only reason this place stays in business is that they have this "hype" built up about them and I think people are so scared of their own images here in LA that they just go along with anything if someone says its cool. Save your money and your tastebuds and  try somewhere like La Cueva in Redondo. Much better burritos. Oh ya and cash only, as in a complete waste of cash.

Tito's is sort of a niche place for Mexican style food. I wouldn't say it's totally authentic (whatever that is) but more of an old CA style Mexican place (whatever that is too LOL). The menu is short and simple but a little confusing in it's layout. I've only ordered the taco, all bean burrito, and meat and bean burritos all without cheese. I'm sort of a "get the same thing every time" kind of guy. I do love their pinto beans and tortillas. The meat is flavorful and typically soft. I've had a couple pieces of beef that were cut really big and had lots of fat that made me want to gag but 90% of the time the meat is great. The lines can sometimes be long and the wait isn't too long for me but I usually go during off peak hours. There was one time that it took 20 minutes for some crazy reason. It's sort of an experience standing in that historic line. I do with they had a fried flour tortilla taco instead of corn (corn allergy that gives me a headache but I still eat one sometimes) but I don't expect to see the menu change at this place ANY time soon. You have to go here at least once. Oh-I guess my mom and the owners daughter were friends back in the early 70's. I wish I could get in contact with her.

UNLESS you really like hardshell tacos.  I don't know any other place that does hardhshell tacos other than Taco Bell and Jack in the Box.   I've tried their other dishes and nothing really jumps out as great.  I would have given Titos an average 3/5 stars if it wasn't for the horrible lines, which drops it down to 2 stars.

Lemme see...I think the very first time I had Tito's was back in the late 90's...although it's not a place I can go too often, (without feeling guilty), when I do crave me some beef burritos (with cheese), this is the only place that'll satisfy. One must weigh at least a couple of pounds, overstuffed with this chunky beef-stew that is heavenly (get lots of napkins). I've cheated on the burrito and have gotten the tostadas one time but have quickly gone back to the burrito and have never cheated since. You've GOT TO try it and I assure you, you'll be hooked. My husband always gets 3 or 4 of their tacos and that's his thing though he's been leaning towards my beefy burritos lately... Don't be turned off by the line outside, there are plenty of efficient people working there, the wait is never that bad. Go hungry and oh, get a small salsa and chunky jalapeno sauce for that extra kick.

I have to say that I am biased.  Everyone has their favorite taco joint... and I'll bet that between your friends, nobody can agree on who's is better. That's what Tito's Taco is like.  I love it... it's on the top of my list.  But it's also because I've been coming here since I was 8.   I remember ordering a few Chili con Carne's and some taco's and going to the Culver City Drive-In.  Those were the days. So what's good there?  It's all good... and I love the way they take their orders at the front window or inside... The place looks the same as I recall as a kid... nothing has change, even down to the chips out of a huge Rubbermaid trash can.  The food is fresh and very simple... but it just tastes so good.   They changed their guacamole recipe... which made me kinda' sad.  I liked their water down version they used to have... but alas, gotta change with the sign of the times. Go early... otherwise expect to wait in line.  And tip the staff there... they deserve it since they work their asses off.

Look bitches, Tito's is the bomb. Delicious crunchy, greasy tacos. Drippy salsa and guacamole, both of  which grew on me after repeated tastings. Truthfully, I don't ever want to eat a taco from anywhere else. Seating is kind of rough, but those in the know, know you should sit out back.  Less people, less trash, less noise. If you hate Tito's, get the hell out of line and eat someplace else.

The burrito melts in your mouth..mmmmm yumm. The trick to a Tito's Burrito handling lies in the Tito's Chips. make sure to have one handy to patch up the spillage. ^_~ I :3 the tacos..and everything else. its not the authenticity of the food. but that it makes for a great munchy, if you catch my drift! the rest is self explanatory.

I just want to state at the outset that anyone who doesn't LOVE Tito's will not get in my pants and, more likely than not, will not be allowed to be my friend.   I have been going to Tito's since my mom first took me when I was 5 years old.  I swear they put heroin in the tacos- they are THAT addictive. The tacos are to DIE for.  The salsa is a perfect match.  For a nice diversion I love the meat and bean burrito. Insider hint:  Always order your food to go.  You'll get more chips and salsa!!  Also, if you are taking it to go, order the lettuce on the side.  That way you can heat the tacos when you get home without heating the lettuce. I would serve this at my wedding!!

There's a line for this place? What the hell? My Los Angeles friends have been raving about this place for the longest time. I finally make it up to Los Angeles to try and I was pretty disappointed. It takes over 15 minutes to find parking and another 15 minutes of waiting in line to put in an order. There's only about 10 items on the menu with the Hard Tacos being the featured food here. Nothing special at all. The hard taco is just a simple tortilla with some mystery meat, lettuce, and cheese. The other items on the menu are simply variations of their hard taco. The food isn't bad, but I don't find it particularly good either. A little about my credentials: I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky, engineering image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian  Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of pastas and dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 8 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I am now an engineer that travels all over the world trying new foods and learning about different cultures.

For all the hype, it is kind of overrated.  If you are in the area and want some decent mexican it can be worth it.  But, it has long lines, there are not many options for customizing your order (tacos and burritos are beef only, although tamales can be chicken), and the food is only slightly above average.  The price is right, but it is cash only.  One of the odd things is that they keep the tortillas in huge trash bins.  Obviously they are clean, but it just looks weird seeing them pull the food you are about to eat out of a trash can.  If you are in the area and want some quick Mexican I would, but otherwise don't bother driving across town.

I'm an addict for this place. When I lived in town I'd go once a week. Now that I'm living on the East Coast, everytime I get back to Los Angeles I make a stop at Tito's. My favorite are the taco's but the chili is tasty and so are the burritos. But... the tacos... ahhh! Heaven! They take the meat and fry it inside the tortilla, then stuff it with lettuce and top if with cheese for .35 cents more. It ends up being about $1.80 a taco but after 2 of them, I'm full. Generally I'll try to stuff a 3rd in my belly but end up on the couch in a coma. Lines are long but go pretty quickly. Don't be discouraged! It's worth the wait.

This place is cool. And I got to see Tito too!! I ordered the bean and cheese burrito. I love bean and cheese burritos, but this was bland and a bit greasy. i tried the enchilada that my brother ordered and it was pretty tasty. BUT, I think the 4 stars for this place goes to the tacos. Their tacos are amazing! Best taco I have tried yet :) The tortilla tastes really yummy, and the meat is shredded, not ground, which I think yields a fresher taste :) With most tacos I have, there is always too much lettuce, but there was a perfect amount of lettuce on this taco. The amount of cheese was good too. Go here! Sneak a peek at Tito and eat some good tacos :)

I have mixed feelings about this place.  I've only been several times.  The first time I went with co-workers and we ate there.  It was okay.   The second time I went with my friend and we picked up.  We get into my car and we start driving.  I'm thinking to myself.  My god what the hell is that smell in my car?  It smells like feet, ass or could it be my friend is farting in my car.  Please note my friend is infamous for letting them out and will admit to it.  I quickly roll down the windows to air the car out.  My friend seems to be unphased by these odors.  So I ask him did you fart?  He says no, why?  I ask him you don't smell that?  He says smell what?  That combination of ass and feet!  He still says no.  When we get home I pull out a taco and give it a good smell.  Hmmmm...it doesn't smell like ass or feet.  WTF?  So to this day I still don't know what the hell that smell is but I'm guessing it could be a combination of Titos and my friend. The food here is okay.  The prices are on the cheap side but the lines and parking stink as bad as my car that day.  The lines are usually long and parking is a fight.  You have to stalk people in the lot to get a spot or circle the block and look for metered parking.

I've been eating Tito's tacos since I was a kid and when I  used to live on the West side, i ate there at least once a week.  LOVE the tacos & burritos and the salsa.  I find the chips to be too thick and crunchy (kind of stale tasting).  I would have given Tito's 5 stars if not for the horrendous lines, difficult parking, cash only (I hardly ever carry cash...atm, baby!!) and the entire ordering process which is a mess.  But the tacos and salsa are worth the hassle and the headache in the long run. VIVA TITO'S!!

I don't know why everyone's got their panties in a bunch, but I didn't think this place was all that bad. I ordered two tacos and a chicken tomale.  The taco's weren't that bad and they were pretty meaty, but I could have gone without the tomale.  Where's the hot sauce by the way?  It was an inexpensive meal. Though, I don't know what could have prompted the huge lines that form outside and inside.  I blame the hard economic times, because it's hard to say no to ~$2.00 tacos.  I mean come on, you're going to complain about ~$2.00 tacos?  Cheap skates!

I really don't get the hype. Tito's Taco is just above average taco's to me. I don't understand the line. I think we've been there total of three times most of times with our friends who had to have it. Other than that, really my husband won't miss a thing if we never go back there again.

Not real mexican tacos. these are the fried tortilla kind. hard shell. My mom makes something similar but ofcourse hers are home made. But taste very similar. The lines for this place are a bit ridiculous. The way they take your order and get served is chaotic. A simple pickup aisle would work wonders for this place instead of standing around were you just payed to get your food. The Tacos are great. at least to me. The put alot of cheese and the meat is tender. The tomato salsa and chips is ok. the tomato salsa is a bit watered down, not spicy at all. Relatively cheap. I have come to this place several times. You will see people of all shapes, colours, and sizes coming to get food here. Many of them get them to go.

Sometimes, you just want some super greasy junk food.  Tito's Tacos can deliver that.  Well, they don't actually deliver like.. pizza deliver.  you know what I mean. :P Is Tito's Tacos a place that serves great tacos?  great Mexican food?  A lot of people here seem to complain that isn't the case. I don't come to Tito's for any of that, though.  I come to Tito's to get my awesome delicious greasy food fix, and for that, it is PERFECT. hates - the salsa.  bleh.  but whatever, it's free. loves - guac - it's quite tasty, worth the extra cash.  chips - free!  nuff said.  oh yeah... the TACOS.

I was really expecting a lot more out of this place. There is so my hype, thats all it is, just hype.  I would not make the drive out here, its not even worth the wait.  The crowd outside is ridiculous!  The tacos are good, very crunchy, just like the chips.  However, nothing really wowed me about them, and the cheese costs extra $0.50, for EACH taco...  what a rip off.  There are many local taco places you can find the same or better quality w/o having to drive here or wait in a super long line.  Probably cheaper too.  I'll just stick to Chano's down the street from my house...

As far removed from mexican food as Tito's is, I still love the place for its' uniqueness. You can always spot when someone is carrying around the brown box. I can list all the things sooooo inexcusably wrong with this place, but, my predecessors have already eloquently done so for me. I will, however, point out the oft cliched question, where are the pigeons out on the patio??? But, I digress. I lean toward the burritos more so than the tacos. I always get a large cup of the salsa, even if I order only  a burrito or 1 taco. That thing must have crack in it. I can honestly say that I can eat that thing all day til I threw up. The quacamole is watered down and I don't believe there's any avocado in it. Its still got a good taste though. Don't be fooled by the long lines. The little ladies behind the counter turn out goods faster than you can run to the bathroom after eating here. Good times!

So I don't like Tito's tacos.  Tried em with and without cheese...not impressed. However, I really dig Tito's burritos :)  The bean and cheese burrito in particular.  I've tried the burrito with the meat, rice, etc. as well, but what it all comes down to in the end is that the beans are stellar (lard-tastic) and the cheese combines to make goodness. I usually get some of the liquid guac and salsa and combine it with the burritos for a little extra flavor, but they are good without too.  The chips are decent, the burritos are definitely messy, the ordering experience is...unique, but the burritos (to me and my wife) are awesome.

I love Tito's... I was introduced to this great little taco stand by my Unlce Denny some years ago. The price is cheap, the food is good, and the staff is friendly.

Okay, so the price is verrry good, no one can argue with that! But... Their burrito lacked something.... What was it...?... Ohh yeah, lettuce, tamatoe, rice, onion, cheese, etc... Ok so maybe your a minamalist and like that they only offer beens and beef in their burritos and tacos. I just like a few more options, maybe chicken? Maybe veggies? It was good though, I would get 2 or 3 tacos instead of a burrito, the shells were fantastic, and anything you get comes with chips and salsa which is very awesome. I just really like holding a fat ass burrito in my hands with all the fixins, they don't got it, just beef and beens.

Like the other reviewers said- they're kinda bland so i bring my own tapatio/cholula and bam! they're freakin awesome. Chips & fresh salsa are good- i put tapatio on them too. lol. My bf and I eat outside in the back and bring our own beers. While I'm waiting in line he goes to the liquor store down the street and grabs us beer. No one really notices so that's  a plus. They charge extra for cheese which is annoying but there's so much on one taco u can spread it around to 3. Its the perfect  place to go on a hot day when u just want some tacos and it's too hot inside ur non-air conditioned apartment.

Ahhh Tito's Taco's a staple of my life as far back as I can remember.  My dad took us there as kids any chance he got.  Living in the Valley, if we were heading south on the 405 we would always take a detour off the Washington exit before hitting our final destination. My father being a New Yorker could not understand his colleagues adulation of the fast food Mexican fare at Tito's.  This was the early 70's and my father was a hot dog kind of guy.  His co-workers insisted they eat at Tito's and my father resisted, until one day a buddy ordered him an all beef burrito with cheese.  From that day he was hooked....and he passed on that same obsession to my and my siblings. I love Tito's for several reasons.  First of all, there is ALWAYS a crowd at both counters inside and out...and the crowd is made up of all kinds of Angeleno's.   Another reason I love Tito's is most importantly the food.  The tacos and burritos are awesome...especially the all beef burritos, think chili Colorado in a flour tortilla with melted oozing yellow cheese.  The sauce the beef is simmered in is incredible!  The tacos are damn good too! Finally, the prices.  Tito's is a pure dive with great food and extremely reasonable prices.  There is a reason there is always a line!

I think with Tito's Tacos, its mainly all hype: 1.  Restaurant: actually a taco stand.  Not much to say...as far as taco stands go, its alright. It does the job I suppose.  Plus side is the menu is simple and hugely plastered on their wall. 2.  Location/Parking:  located in Culver City, my current place of residence...so its good on the convenience end.  It's located right by a relatively busy intersection.  Parking is not too bad.   3.  Food:  I had the classic tacos.  To tell you the truth, I didn't think it was all that special.  I could tell the shell was a bit more unique, more of the home made side kind of deal and I appreciated that...but all in all, it tasted like a taco. lol... 4.  Service:  I never had to wait so long just to get some freakin tacos.  I think my first (and last) time there, I waited for over an hour.  It was ridiculous to say the least. 5.  Price:  cheap and affordable. All and all, my conclusion is: Impartial

I've been coming to this place for years. It's another L.A. institution.  Even for folks who've never dined here, they can tell you that there's always a big line outside the restaurant day or night.  I think it's also a destination at night for folks who were out partying a bit too much and needing a bit of grease to make them feel better. As everyone says, the ordering system is really confusing.  You've got several parallel lines outside and a few inside.  You just sort of pick one and stick to it.  I always get the same thing--two tacos with cheese and a Diet Coke.  Okay, sometimes I get three tacos if I'm starving. The whole order taking process is SO inefficient--the same person takes your order, gets your drinks, make the tacos, collect money, get you change, boxes the food and gives it to you.  It seems like they could leverage economies of scale, but what do I know.  I'm not the one making a fortune selling tacos.  The conspiracy theorist in me says that it's part of a genius marketing ploy to keep the lines long and the demand high. Parking is hard, and tables go for a premium.  One negative that have to throw out there is that this place wastes a tone of those paper trays.  They have to give you two even if you don't want it.  Their trash bins are FILLED with them.  I think they are single-handedly destroying a square mile of the rain forests each day.

It was going to Torrance for a thanksgiving get together with my friends. My friend said, "TITO's tacos is right here!" He had always raved about how good their tacos are. So i told him, "lets go!" Even though we had a huge dinner upon us, I felt like I needed to fulfill my yelp duties to try this place. So there we went. We got lucky with the parking cuz you gotta park on the street. The lines were so long, but good thing they moved very quickly. My first reaction was, this place must have bomb tacos, look at all these people trying to get tacos! As we waited in line, I noticed the prices are really good too! Very cheap for some super hyped up tacos. At this point, my expectation was through the roof! So when I got my tacos...it didnt exactly meet my expectations. Its just that it was set too high. The tacos were good, but not out of this world good. I do like the freshly made taco shells. Would I drive 30 minutes to West LA for these tacos? Nah. I can probably find just as good tacos, if not better around my neck of the woods. But I must say, if im craving for cheap tacos, and is around the west LA area. Titos tacos would definitely be the first on my mind.

Step 1 - YouTube the "Tito's Taco" video...it's probably the only reason I keep coming back to this hole!! Damn catchy song. Step 2 - Realize that this is NOT an authentic Mexican food restaurant  and the food is mediocre/good, but for some damn reason I always come back. It's one of those places that you know isn't all that great but can't seem to get enough of. Step 3 - BRING CASH!! No CC accepted. I usually get a couple tacos (w/ cheese) and a bean, rice and cheese burrito. I really like the beans for some reason and they always put a lot of cheese in the burrito. They give you complimentary chips and "salsa" but in my opinion it's just tomato puree. Not really flavorful but I guess it's better than nothing. I usually take mine home to eat because I can pile on the Cholula I have in the fridge. It's really one of the only Mexican places in the Palms/Culver City area that has decent food and is open till 11pm. Parking can be a pain and the lines get a little crazy during dinner time, but other than that I like this place.  I like to collect the 50 cent pieces they give as change here...kinda quirky but cool at the same time.

I had been hearing about Tito's for a while now from my dear hubby and his best friend. It's a nostalgic place for them. We stopped at Tito's on the way to Griffith Observatory; a group of 5 of us split a couple of meat and bean burritos, tostadas, tacos, and tamales. It was good, warm, and filling, but there are other burrito stands that I prefer. Even my hubby said Tito's is a once a year type of thing; I can handle that.

I found this place to be a decent place to get some hard-shelled tacos, which is difficult to come by, which explains the line out the dinner. Luckily the line moves quite quickly so your in and out in a matter of minutes (especially aas parking is a little scarce even though they have a lot for parking). As for the tacos themselves, well they were okay. I guess what sets them apart is that they are like taco bell hard shelled tacos with a lot of filling inside. As for the taste, well it wasn't bad but nothing out of the ordinary taco though (their refried beans were about the same...). I really like their chili con carne though. Yum, not to salty or oily with chunks and chunks of tenderly stewed beef. That coupled with a taco and refried beans and you got a winner there. Also as an added bonus they give you a lot of salsa and chips to your order, both of which were quite good too. I would recommend that if you are in the area to stop by and try it our to see what all the hype outside is about...but are the same time I wouldn't drive out to the place just to get tacos.

I have been a fan of Tito's since the 70's when the bikers hung out there instead of families and police officers. Since I don't eat meat anymore I can not enjoy the taco's but the bean and cheese burritos and traditional tostada with extra cheese is a treat. The cheese they use is the premium stuff and chips are fresh..always. There is a line etiquette. Please order and move to the side they will remember you and you should remember them. Bring cash and leave a tip. Your 'person' makes your food then and there with care. I love the half dollars they give you for change which my kids love to save. Parking can be hard so bring change just in case you get the front parking spaces on the street. FYI: It is more American Mexican food so nothing spicy exists here. People order 20+ tacos at a time so be ready to wait in a long line.

Cash Only! I came to try the hype.  So many reviews, I had to see for myself why this place is so popular. I ordered a taco and a burrito. The taco is a hard taco.  It is like a better version of a Taco Bell hard taco. The burrito is very good!  The shredded beef just melts in your mouth.   I would go back for the burrito, but not for the tacos.

This is a pretty neat place. It's really cool that it's a family-owned restaurant and that it's been around for a while. Parking is okay; the lot gets filled up really quickly, but there's street parking that's free after 6pm so if you don't mind the walk, just park on the street. The enchiladas were so-so but the sauce they use is amazing. The tacos are the thing to get here, obviously. I love the quality of shredded beef, and adding the cheese on top. I like how you can watch them make your order right in front of you before you pay. Chips and salsa are amazing too!! The salsa's made from scratch and it's fresh! This is a pretty good place, a bit overrated in my opinion, but still good to get once in a while. There's two lines: a to-go line and a for-here line. The for-here line is much faster and there's plenty of indoor seating.

Good, simple, tacos! Tito's is a no frills busy little joint with walk up windows (always a line) in side and out. Tacos are $1.75, you can really only get shredded beef and chicken.  Get the beef.  They also offer tamales, chili and burritos but I didn't get to try those. Your food comes out quick, is cheap, and is very simple.  The tacos are all hard shell, made with the most delicious shredded beef and lettuce and I would highly recommended adding cheese and salsa. I would definitely eat here again.  You know the food is good when there is always a line!

Tito's is an LA institution for basic, simple tacos.  I've been going here regularly for years and love the tacos, the bean and cheese burritos, chips and salsa.   Easier access elsewhere?  Yes Fancier, more options elsewhere?  Yes Healthier food elsewhere?  Yes But if you're looking for good, simple tacos, made fresh to order by the person you place the order with, at a GREAT price, then Tito's is the place.

4 stars: Yay! I'm a fan. Do yourself a favor and go to http://titostacos.com and listen to the theme song before you read this review. You'll be singing it for the next three days. Damn that's a catchy jingle. I used to eat here pretty frequently. Sometimes twice a week. But I don't live around there anymore, so I've had some time to reflect on Tito's and really think about why I like this place even though it has so much going against it. If you park in the lot, it is only a matter of time before your car gets smashed or you get into a fight with someone over a spot, or you find yourself unable to get into your car because some asshole parked right next to your door and it won't open more than 3 inches without hitting his car. Stick to street parking, even if it's under the freeway, or further down the street. Your sanity is worth the walk. The window system is completely asinine. There are outdoor windows, indoor windows, and all kinds of confused tourists both inside and outside who mill about taking up space uncertain as to what to do. Some of the ladies are quick, some of the ladies are slow. You will look over at the longest line and head to window with a shorter line only to be stuck in the same spot, while the long line breezes by, and you curse your bad luck and inability to handicap the windows properly. The ordering system is stupider than the window system. Once you get to a window, you order your food. The same woman who took your order then goes and starts to put together your order, leaving you standing there at the window. Rather than specialize, with dedicated order takers and order assemblers, the management has decided to make things take as long as humanly possible. So your order is now in front of you. Everyone behind you watches earnestly, praying you remembered to hit an ATM on the way over so you can pay for your meal. No plastic accepted here. This is about 80% of the time. Sometimes when they are busy, another lady will show up in the window after you've ordered, and take the person behind you's order. Now there's two of you standing in front of the window getting crushed by the line behind you as you try to figure out where you can stand that isn't directly violating someone else's personal space. Stupid, stupid, stupid system. Hopefully, you've had someone stalk a table for you; either inside at a table or outside at the benches. Otherwise, you'll stand around hopelessly while your cheese congeals and your lettuce wilts, looking for a place to sit. The food isn't particularly cheap. The food isn't particularly authentic. Yet, I really like Tito's. I crave it for reasons unknown. The watery salsa is as refreshing as a perfectly prepared gazpacho. The chips are rarely ever stale. You'll get a big bag of chips with your meal. The chili con carne is satisfyingly meaty. The way the cheese melts in your beef and cheese burrito will make you smile. The tacos are an explosion of different consistencies: greasy, crispy, meaty, cheesy, lettuce-y. The flavors aren't pronounced. The cheese is probably sharper than the meat seasoning is flavorful, and the taco shell is more oily than corny, but it's the way everything works together on the taco that makes it so unique. Tito's is a serious hassle on the weekends, so try and avoid the peak times. Your experience will be much better if you get the food with a minimal hassle. After you've struggled in the parking lot, struggled to order, struggled to find a seat, I wouldn't blame you for giving this place a 1-star rating and calling it a day.

I dont care what all the haters say........Titos still serves the best hard shell beef taco in the world.  It is what it is....a cheap, tasty, mystery meat, deep fried goodness taco. Accept it, embrace it and enjoy it.   It is and always will be delicious and an LA landmark.

Tacos are fairly tasty, though nowhere near the best I've ever had (an that's not even counting home-cooking).  Service is AWFULLY slow & not well set-up.

Yeah, it's not authentic Mexican food, but I still like Panda Express and that's DEFINITELY not Chinese food. The beef burrito was underwhelming, kinda nasty like everyone says, but the shredded meat hard tacos are BOMB! I think the next time I go to Tito's I'll order four of them... The fresh salsa that comes with the meal definitely adds to the flavor, muy fresca. If I lived in this part of town, maybe I'd get tired of it pretty quick, but those tacos sure are tasty!

The idea that greasy tacos before a night of tasting about 14 different whiskeys has a small flaw, you see...you are eating greasy tacos before tasting 14 different whiskeys!!! My gut was not enjoying life at about shot number 10. Titos itself is decent place for tacos. They sort of reminded me of the way that my granny used to make them. They were plenty big and stuffed with meat,lettuce and cheese for days. The salsa was fresh, but lacked any sort of spice. It was more of a tomato puree with a lil bit of  onion. Chips o' plenty. Chili con Carne was certainly meaty. But again lacked much spice. If I'm in the area, I would damn sure return (and bring a bottle of Tapatio). But would not go so far as to make it a gotta go destination.

I like Tito's... you just have to go with some knowledge of what you are getting into. Tito's is basically a mexican food concession stand.  There are no tables inside.  You order from a window and then take the food home, to a nearby park or eat in the car.  They serve everything in shoebox like to-go containers.   It's not the bext mexican food ever... but if you think of it more as fast food-mexican or concession stand mexican you will enjoy it.  I do. Bring cash.

OK, so tonight I was introduced to Tito's Tacos for the first time. This place was described to me as, "The In-N-Out of tacos". They did have a simple and small menu (sorry no "secret" menu here) and very long lines for food that totally isn't worth the wait. As we drove by we saw the massive Friday night crowd waiting in what looked like 10 different lines forming in front of the restaurant and more people in line inside! As a side note, normally when we go to an eatery that has THAT MANY people crowding outside, we don't even bother stopping. In this case we were with a group of people who wanted to eat there, so without complaint, we joined the herd of patrons. After waiting in line for about 35-40 min, we got our food and were lucky enough to get a table inside. I ordered: - 2 tacos - 1 Chicken tamale The tacos were just OK. Personally, I thought the shell was a too hard. It was basically a slightly more attractive cousin of the Jack-In-The-Box taco. Their tortilla chips were equally hard. The chicken tamale, however, was very good. When I unwrapped it I thought it was going to be bland because it was so white in color (usually with savory tamales, more color means more flavor) but despite its ghostly complexion, this tamale was dang tasty! To top it off (literally) they give you a red sauce to smother it in, similar to the stuff they pour over a wet burrito. This was the best part of the meal for me. Not good enough to wait in that crazy long line, though. Bottom line: Tacos get a C- Tamale gets a B+ For me, Tacos Mexico still holds the taco crown!

Love Tito's - first time over the weekend... a quick bite for $5.50 and you're on the road! I was a little unsure when we saw the long lines but they process people soooo quickly it's insane. Let's talk about the meat shall we? The tacos ONLY come in beef - but it's shredded beef not ground (so you don't have to worry about that Taco Bell resemblance). Burritos are a choice between beef or chicken and if you order "to go" it comes with chips and salsa. IMPORTANT TIPS: #1 - CASH ONLY. Please come prepared. (there is an ATM just in case) #2 - Parking isn't ideal so drive up to Tito's armed with a little patience. #3 - the Guac rocks!!! Order a large serving of it cause it goes fast! Do yourself a favor and check it out. Don't let the long lines and parking defeat you. Rise up and discover Tito's for yourself! Your friend on Yelp - Justin T.

From what I have heard and read, it seems that Tito's lovers fall into two categories: those that actually love the food, and those that love the establishment for the sake of sentimentality. As a Tito's outsider coming here for the first time recently, I think the appeal lies somewhere right in the middle. The tacos are greasy and filling. With just 2 tacos, some chips, and salsa, I was feeling adequately full. But at the same time, I'm sure there are plenty of better alternatives elsewhere that don't require you driving down to Culver City for. I parked on a small side street right where one of the lot entrances is. It's a tucked away little cul-de-sac and makes the entire place seem like its own little complex. The line wasn't too bad, and it felt nice being a part of something so storied with everybody else there. Definitely struck me as a necessary Angeleno experience.

Titos is near LAX which makes it a go to place for airport pickup shuttle aka my sister and brother in law. They love this place, for me its okay but then again Titos has 1600+ reviews so its not only my sis and bro in law who enjoy eating here. Dont get me wrong i love the simple menu and the rolled tacos are delicious and not to mention very filling. Titos also has cool outdoor seating if you come during lunch or its a warm LA evening. I wish they did have Horchata which would totally help in washing down these clunkers they call tacos but thats okay too. If your rushing to LAX and need to get a quick decent meal, this place is a good spot to go to.

I'm so torn on so many levels about Tito's. It's a unique place. When I was a kid this is what mexican food was, and, that's what I love about it. It hasn't changed in 30 years (probably more, but I wasn't going before that). The burritos were a wonder when I was a child, "where did they get those huge tortillas?!" I thought to myself, as back then the only ones you could get at the supermarket were about eight inches and crumbly. The burritos are super simple: meat, beans or combo. Meat means all freekin meat. Chili colorado all the way through, while the other ones are self explanatory.   The tacos are old school. No they're not a pile of stuff on a corn tortilla, which is what authentic means these days. It's spiced beef, veggies and cheese in a deep-fried shell. My fave is the chips and salsa though. The salsa is runny and simple: tomatoes, chilis, salt and pepper apparently tossed in a blender, but not like I've found anywhere else, while the chips (included in most orders) are made at the store and full of greasy crispiness. Yea the guacamole basically sucks, but it's what introduced me to guac all those years ago, so it has nostalgia value. I'm deducting a star from this must-do LA place for the constant crowds, full parking lot, and general dirty rundownness of the whole thing. As much as I value every time I go, I don't do it often for these reasons. I usually just go to El Tarasco for about the same price, more variety, less crowds and waiter service.

Interesting phenom, Tito. If you were to equate Taco Bell as authentic Mexican food, then don't come to Tito's. The Taco's are beef ONLY. It's shredded beef, which takes on a mind of it's own. But, they are definitely fresh tacos. The shredded cheese appears that it's the "real deal" as far as cheddar goes, and it looks as if they shred it themselves- vs. it coming shredded in a package. The shells are fried corn tortillas- nice and crispy. Chips are made on premesis (I saw). They are fresh, but lacked the extra grease that can make the salt stick to 'em. This is just my personal opinion- if you are eating at a place like Tito's, you shouldn't have a fear of grease. The salsa- it's fresh. But definitely weak on the spice factor. And I didn't note any other options for salsa. My favorite, was the yellow hat I bought for 12 bucks that say's, "Tito's Tacos". It's pretty obnoxious, but I like it.

The ordering system is a bit confusing, but if you go with the flow you can figure it out. I had only eaten their tacos before, but this time I also ordered a bean & beef burrito. It was fantastic without being authentic Mexican cuisine by any means. A solid 2.5 stars

My dad took my sister and I to Tito's Tacos when we were kids in the 70's and all I could remember is it was next to a freeway overpass. Fast forward many years and I'm still coming here. Tacos aren't for me BUT the burrito....now we're talking. I like mine with beans, meat and A LOT of cheese. Careful though... ate one of these during lunch and just about did a face plant at my desk afterwards from "food coma". LA wouldn't be the same without Tito's and if you're a hater then move along. Yes, the parking can be a pain but park a block away and walk. The crowds are always there but everyone is patient and the staff can handle it. I love Tito's Tacos!! Viva Tito's!

I was visiting for a weekend. "Let's go for a walk," I said, itching to get out of the house. "Where can we walk in my neighborhood?" he asked. "Well, I guess there's Tito's..." A surprisingly short line, ten dollars, ten LA-length blocks, and an hour and a half later, we staggered back up to the house with two shirt-sized cardboard boxes. While I'll never walk to Tito's again, I dream of my next trip to LA, for Tito's enchiladas and the wonderfully large, unfussy painted menu board.

A tad overrated, but still an enjoyable meal.  The tacos are definitely the main attraction.  The meat and the shell get deep fried together, and it gives the taco an almost taquito like texture.  It's a real solid taco, but it's nothing special.  The burritos are average at best.  The tamales are tasty.  Don't bother with what they call guacamole, it's basically avocado juice. The lines are long, and it's hard to find a place to sit.  They have their little Tito's Express service, so try to use that instead so you don't have to wait in those ridiculous, unwarranted lines.

5 STARS! When you grow up on the WESTSIDE Tito's is a staple. Its like an exboyfriend/girlfriend...you reminisce on the good times, think of how good it was and maybe if your in the neighborhood you'll stop by for a lil nibble. Its just straight comfort food for our family and I honestly do like their tacos which is all I ever get and the salsa and guacamole. If you didn't grow up around here then no, you don't get it...but thats ok, cuz you'll make the line shorter. LOL Parking is a mofo, if you can have someone drop you off while you order and wait while they pick up the brewski's. Not FAST food, but its good. Oh, and I would take it home...why sit in the cramped area while everyone bumps you in your head and stares at you while you try to act like you are comfortable in your seat.

Heard this place was really popular so several of us decided to check this place out.  It was right next to the hotel we stayed at.  There is always a long line here. Its a little strange to see the person who takes your order is also the person who makes and prepares your food and takes your money.  There were about 10 employees who does this.  and each serves their customers from begining to end.  perhaps that's why the lines are long due to the inefficiencies. Since i love cheese, this place does a really good job of stacking the tacos with tons of cheese.  that's a plus.  and the complimentary chips and salsa.   Only problem is, there are no taco sauce.  so the tacos are a little dry to me. *see the picture of the tacos i posted

Never knew what the big deal was until I started driving by it on a regular basis. The line is always long, and people always rave about their food. So I figured I'd give it a try and made a visit one weekday evening. We parked on the street just a few yards away. Parking doesn't seem to be much of an issue, unless you come during the weekend evenings or weekday evenings. (Think after work hours.) The line wasn't too long when we got there but once we got our food, we noticed the line was slowly starting to form! Decided to order one carne asada burrito, four tacos, an enchilada, and drinks. Of course the chips come along with. i only tried the taco and enchilada so I can't speak for the burrito. But the taco is delicious! And I'm NOT even a fan of hard tacos either. (I'm more into the soft taco variety.) The enchilada left a little to be desired, though. I suggest you stick with their tacos. The chips were great and their salsa... mmmm, their salsa. Sigh. Can't go wrong with that, either. The whole meal was very cheap and worth every dollar. I would definitely go back. And back. And back again! ;)

I don't get the Tito's love. This is fairly Americanized Mexican food. The beans leave me cold, and that's one of the indicators I use to judge a Mexican kitchen. I've been here twice, ordered different items each time, and left with a hearty "MEH". That goes for the tacos as well. My grandmother could have made better, and she's from Alabama. No more.

I don't get why this place is so popular.  The lines are poorly managed, the food is too salty, and they give half dollars for change.  Who the hell still uses half-dollars?   "But it's SOO cheap!"  In absolute dollars it is cheap.  But in relative value it's an absolute rip-off. Don't drink the Kool-Aid (I guess horchata would be more appropriate) and stay away from this place. If you do go, please don't place an order for your entire office and/or party.  When I did go there, the one thing I hated most of all was someone ordering for 20 people.

I don't understand all of the hate on here. We're talking about hard-shell tacos, not filet mignon. You really can't screw that up and even if you could, Tito's hasn't done it. First, this place is ALWAYS packed. It's like the Pink's of the west side. You will always wait and have problems parking -- that's just how it is. The one downside and the reason for just 4-stars, is because Tito's only accepts cash. I mean what is that? I haven't carried cash on me since 2005. With the amount of customers they get on a daily basis, ol' Tito can afford the $10.00 monthly batch fee for a credit/debit machine. Fortunately, the prices are so cheap and reasonable that one can probably fund a meal based off change found on the floor of your car. Once you brave the crowds and make your way up to the window, then it's time to put your order in. The only things that I have ever ordered here are: (1) tacos and (2) chips and salsa. I suggest that you only order those things too. I can't vouch for the tamales or enchiladas, and frankly, why would you come to a place famous for its tacos and order the fringe items? In Southern California, it's hard to find a place that specializes in hard-shell tacos. The majority of "authentic eats" tends to emphasize the soft carne asada tacos. Tito's uses seasoned shredded beef and freshly grated cheddar cheese. Is this what they eat in Mexico City? I don't know, I've never been there, and I really don't care. The food is tasty, so just enjoy it. For all those naysayers, I associate "hype" with an athlete, sports team or movie. Something that gets built up and loses its novelty within a short time. I don't associate it with a taco stand that has had a consistent wait for decades!

So what, sometimes the lines are long. Ok, so it JUST so happens that a dude from the local EMS just put an order in for the whole unit. WHO CARES, these tacos are the SH*T. By far, the best tacos in the world.  Point me somewhere else and tell me differently. Even if you're not "feeling it" once you walk up and smell the GOODNESS that is Titos, you just gotta get up on SOME. AND YES, you want the tacos WITH cheese, how could you not. The enchiladas and burritos are just as good, but the tacos are the best. Maybe there's cocaine in them? Still, f*cking amazing.  And stupid cheap. Cash only though, heads up.  There is an ATM machine, but why pay the $2-$3 for cash that COULD have been another taco.  Do the smart thing, grab some skrilla before you get there.

The only good thing here are ground beef tacos. Do NOT get a burrito. The ground beef taco comes with a bunch of cheese and lettuce, and this combination is also thrown in their burritos, which doesn't taste right in burrito form.  Oh and bring cash its cash only!! Salsas good, guacamole is meh. It's like very watery. It's not worth the extra price, just stick with salsa. They hook you up with a LOT of chips, yum. No indoor seating area, mostly a place to grab food to go, great food for parties. Those ground beef tacos are quite delicious and VERY filling, I thought I could eat 4 but I filled up on 3.  Tacos are about 2.00 each I believe, that's not exact but its close.

We went there today on the recommendation of my brother-in-law. We are from Anaheim & have many tacos in our lives, but we didn't find Tito's Tacos had any distinct flavor! We ordered 2 tacos with cheese each, decried beans & it comes with chips & salsa. We thought the salsa tasted like crushed tomatoes with no heat to it. We are used to fresh pico de gallo so we were very disappointed. The retried beans were creamy & ok, but again not a lot of distinct flavor. Glad we tried it, but won't go back.

It's amazing how there is a line here all the time. This place does not serve true Mexican tacos. I had their beef burrito which was filled with the base chili sauce and cheese. The beef itself is good, but I didn't like it with the chili sauce at all maybe because I don't like chili at all. I also got their beef tacos, which again, their beef is nice and tender, but if you look at the taco itself - just seemed like I was eating at Taco Bell. Their salsa is fresh and good though. If you like hard shell taco and chili, I would recommend you coming here but if you wanted some true Mexican tacos...don't bother coming here at all.

I've had the tamales, the burritos and the chili-con-carne burritos, but nothing compares to their tacos. The hot ticket here (and what most people go there for) are the tacos. If you're a soft taco fan, don't bother - these babies are hard-shelled jobs.  These lovelies are loaded with ground beef, lettuce, tomato and cheese. Be sure to use some of their (on the mild-side) salsa that adds an extra dimension of flavor. The order usually comes with chips and salsa "in the box". Typical order: 6 tacos split between two people, but you'll walk out full. I used to work about 10 minutes away from this place, and everyone that I've ever brought here for tacos leaves ranting and raving about how good these tacos are. Fall/Winter Sunday "go to" place for Mrs. and me after the football games are over.

The Best Crunchy Beef and Cheese Taco ever.  If your in LA you have to trust me on this spot.  The prices are super cheap and the food tastes like grandma used to make. Everything on the menu is BOMB from the Burritos, Taco's, Tamales, and Tostadas.   Every order comes with crunchy tortilla chips and some bomb salsa which actually pretty mild. The Bay are has nothing on this spot.  There's always a line of people 24/7 but the lines move quick.  Once your order the lady's prepare your food and you pay once she look at you...  ODALEY HOMES TRUST ME

This place is good any time of day...as long as they are open ;) Hard-Shell tacos....yum! pretty good! Some people like it, some people don't. I'm one of them that'll eat them anytime!  A little pricey? Maybe those dam tacos are pretty tasty!  There's other stuff there like burittos and tamales but the tacos is their specialty. The lines do get long, but if you get there at the right time, the wait will be really short.

This place has been a West side staple for many many years. Parking is a pain and there's always long lines inside and outside, but its well worth it. Tito's is my all-time favorite for tacos. I have been eating here for over 25 years. I always order several of their tacos with cheese. I love the crunch of the fried shells, the texture of the beef, and the tang of the cheese. I also love the all-meat burrito. I always get all-meat burritos wherever I go. Save me the fillers like beans, rice, and cheese. The filling is like a stew of beef, the sauce the beef simmers in is nice and delicious. Also comes with a bunch of chips along with some of thier salsa  which is on the thin/watery side but still good. Place takes only cash and if you can send out a scout to get a table while you are waiting in line.

I'm a fan. They are cheap comfort food, plain and simple. They are open late, consistently decent, and there are plenty of places to sit and eat inside and out. They are NOT great food. They are great because it is *simple*, not over-salted, and they have all the standbys. I'm so glad they are around.

I've only ever had the tacos, but the lines are always long and this place is super famous. Greasy, fried tacos with plenty of fried chips to go with it. My boyfriend gets a major stomach ache afterwards (but always suggests going back??). My stomach is perhaps a bit more strong, but man, after 3 tacos I can't eat for the rest of the day. Cheap, good, but you'll have to wait in line no matter what the time.

I used to go here occasionally when I was living on the westside.  I think part of the problem was that this place got so hyped and when I had it I was just disappointed.  I went a couple times to make sure, but I just don't think the tacos are that great.  They're not expensive, except when compared to the price of authentic tacos in Baja California and some other choice locations in SoCal. All in all, I just didn't think they were that good, there were always long lines and it just seemed overhyped.

I can understand why some people don't like Tito's... their salsa is thing, quac can be called "runny", the taco's aren't "authentic"... blah blah blah... maybe its because I've been doing to Tito's for like.. 20 years.. i used to live in Culver city as a kid and have some fond memories of my parents taking me here, but i digress... I've ordered everything you can from Tito's at one time or another, and the food has its flaws, but it has some very high points as well... #1, if your looking for soft mini-tortilla's with a small amount of shredded, chopped, or otherwise meat, this is NOT the place for you, if you want thick chunky salsa/guac, this place is NOT for you There are many viewing windows so you can watch your food being prepared, which is nice. All their chips are made fresh and your order always comes with chips and their standard salsa. I still have not deciphered how they figure it out, but you get a small salsa for lets say up to 3 tacos, and then you get a medium for up to 6 tacos, and so on.. their salsa is a sort of blended type salsa so it may seem "watery" at time, but it is extremely consistent (over the 20 yrs), well flavored salsa. The guac. i would call more an "avocado sauce" is perfect for using a spoon to apply to your taco or tostada, or just for chip dipping. Chili Con Carne: very chunky beef, stewed in a heavily flavored sauce-like liquid. this mixture is also used as the beef in the burritos... a very unique flavor, a lot of spices blended together, probably a little cinnamon, maybe tiny bit of star anise, but it all blends together well. Rice: flavorful when used in a burrito (BRC, beans/rice/cheese) but I'm not a huge fan is it ordered al a carte. Beef and Rice burrito kicks ass too, since the rice helps keep all the chili con carne in line. Beans: Re-fried been, pretty standard, very flavorful and not too many whole beans to be found in it, mostly mashed. Beans are semi-loose in texture but not runny, know what i mean ? Bean and cheese burrito's are a frequently ordered item here. Tacos: my personal fav. non-authentic, (if you want authentic, go to olvera st.) meat is cooked and shredded, then put into a tortilla.. take about 40 of these and put into a deep fryer basket and fry... not only crisping the taco but also crisping the edges of the meat giving 2 different meat textures for your taco munching pleasure. the taco's not only pick up the crispy texture from frying but also, from all the past tacos that have been fried in that same oil. knowing what i know about fryers, oil, temp's, ect.. i have never seen their oil look dirty or been to the smoke point... these taco's may not be for everyone, but for those of us who they are for... thank you Tito's Tito's is a LA classic that has been there as long as i can remember.. its Cash Only but they have an ATM outside, but sometimes its been out of cash(go figure) or just out of service.

It's not the best place in the world, especially if you have to wait a long ass time for a small order, but its worth a try. Personally, I like it. Everything tastes fresh. I don't know any other word to describe it, but it just tastes fresh. I ordered a bean and cheese... how to you make a bean and cheese taste fresh? It's beyond me, but they do it. There is a lack of seating and parking can be rough. Then, they only take cash. How are you going to have commercials, but not afford card transactions. I'm sorry, but these things alone make it not a five star. I don't know what everybody is talking about it not being authentic Mexican food. Maybe its not, but there are definitely Mexicans here and that satisfies my rule of thumb: don't eat food that doesn't attract its own culture.

This place is really really good. But not gourmet good so don't get it confused. This is, just a little over a dollar for a greasy, yet tasty taco good. I am from the SF bay area and my sister in law took my wife and I here. I have been to plenty of real mexican food places. I don't think I would consider this true mexican food but it is soooooo tasty. We just ordered a bunch of tacos, a few drinks and a side of beans and rice. They gave us a butt load of chips and salsa (which were also to die for). Have you napkins ready, everything is greasy and delicious. I could see going to a place like this after a night of heavy drinking. The lines are a bit long but to me it was worth the wait. I can't attest to the other items on the menu but they looked good as well.

Had to kill time due to the Germans designing a crappy VW Beetle and breaking down on a road trip.  We had to choose between two taco shops directly next door to each other, so we chose the one with the line. TITO TACO- Big, hard, thick (that's what she said! BAH-ZING!) shell w/ shredded beef, lettuce and QUESO QUESO QUESO.  All around, tacos were perfect minus the beef.  The beef is your typical shredded lack of any flavor meat.   They give you a grip of the thick fresh tortilla chips (needs more salt) and a bucket of salsa.  The salsa lacks any type of chunks and is bland.  It basically adds wetness to anything you may think is dry. They don't have sour cream at all, not even as an add on. Guac- very tasty, but blended.  No chunks at all. I would definitely go here again if I ever drive a crappy VW Beetle and break down again in the city of Culver.

As someone who grew up in Culver City, Tito's was always nice because it was local, but it is not 5 star cuisine and really shouldn't be treated any more than a dive. First, I am a huge fan of the "Meat" burritos.. I remember once asking for a 'beef burrito", only to be met with "Que?!?". I changed my request to 'meat' only to question if it wasn't beef what is it? With that said, the burrito's have huge chunks of beef that are an adventure to eat. The taco's are pretty much like the taco's your mom used to make. Tortilla + deep fryer = shell, stuffed with taco stuff. All the other reviews about the watery tasteless salsa, and the runny guacamole are true, but it is what it is. The guac if fun being runny because you can dip an enitre taco into it. In fact it is poured out of a pitcher. Don't get me wrong, Tito's is a pain in the ass, but its cheap and relatively good. Parking is HORRIBLE... You may as well not even look. Have someone drive you there, and drive in a circle around the washington / sepulveda / sawtelle block a few times and pick you up. Back when i was a kid they used to do this thing with silver dollars as change.. Cute, but where do you put a silver dollar? They do it still with the half dollars, which is still a pain in the butt but its a novelty. Why 4 stars? If i wanted 'good' mexican food, there are plenty of places in LA, but bad mexican food (i sound insane here) seems to be an attraction also. Almost its own food group.

Its an LA institution...the food is good, not super fantastic...but its the stuff i grew up on, part of my soul and upbringing.  I cant get enough of what they call guacamole...the green runny delicious sauce that i can drink straight.  While were talking about salsa ask for the little container of super hot dyn--o-mite stuff that will shine up an old penny. Remember two things: whatever you order, order with cheese....and keep an eye on who you ordered from so you know when its ready!

I know hardshell tacos aren't authentic, but I love them anyway.  At Tito's, the taco shell is a thick hearty corn tortilla, which to me is the key.  It comes w/ shredded beef (wish they made a chicken taco).  The cheese is some sort of sharp cheddar, which also is important to me.  The only problem is the salsa is v. bland, a lot like the weak stuff you get at El Pollo. I've tried some of the other offerings, like enchiladas and tamales, they're good too. But I don't eat here that often b/c the line usually turns me away.

Always curious about this place as I drive past it on my Westside jobs.  Never not a line. (Is that a real sentence?)  Always with someone waiting. Customers in line can mean only one thing -- good product inside. Stopped by and had two tacos.  Must say -- the window ordering is a bit complicated and their menu is complicated at best.   Got two beef tacos (no chicken for you fake vegetarians) and ordered them sans cheese.  A chap before me got them and it looked like about ten pounds of shredder cheddar.  Not for me, me thought.   Good crunch, meat was a little bland (that's what the ten pounds of cheese is for) but a nice salsa rounded things out. Overall, not as good a Tacos Por Favor -- the best street Mexican on the Westside, but Tito's seems like a great place for late night and post drinking yummies.

I don't know what it is about being near the beach but for some reason I always need to eat some mexican food after. So driving down the 405 after driving around Santa Monica, came here on whim after my friend suggested. Side note: I don't even really like eating mexican food. Never suggest it. Never crave it. But man, I've had MUCH better. We ordered two chicken tamales which were 'alright.' They came with a red meat sauce. That however couldn't make up for the lack chicken and flavor in the tamale itself. Honestly, the sauce didn't have much taste either. The chips are pretty good but pretty standard BUT the salsa leaves you wanting more. It's a watery blend of finely minced tomatoes and all that other salsa stuff [it was cut up so small I couldn't tell] I didn't bother getting the tacos since to my dismay they only have those 'hard shell beef lettuce and cheese' type tacos, but I guess that's my fault for thinking Tito Tacos must have a variety of tacos... Overall, the prices and portions are great. Service is straight to the point and quick. The food is fresh albeit not that tasty. If you like big quantities and standard tasting mexican food you may like this place but if you're willing to pay more for something that can do a mexican hat dance on your tongue than skip this place..

Yum! I'm usually more a fan of mexican food from El Taurino or King Taco, but Tito's Tacos is a different kind of good. I'm used to the salty, very robust flavorful kind of meat but Tito's Taco meat is different- less salty, yet still flavorful and has their own distinctive taste. I ordered the tacos, my boyfriend got the burrito, and it also comes with chips & salsa. I love the tacos (w/ no cheese) and a side order of guacamole. The tacos with a spoonful of their salsa + guacamole = absolutely delicious. The burritos..... my poor boyfriend and his poor choices : ( Well lesson learned and we will never order it! Atmosphere is very local and you can tell they have a lot of returning customers including myself. Yeah, it's a bit shabby looking but it's not a gourmet restaurant or anything and it's good with an even better price. Will be making my regular trips to hit my taco spots!

I am not certain why I am even writing a review for this place because I am sure enough people have raves already!! BUT I LOVE Titos.. once I ate titos each day during a five day week. I always get the bean and cheese burrito and taco with cheese  my mouth is watering even thinking about it). My gets the tamales and loves them. The drawbacks (but I ready know and kinda like the drawbacks) 1. they do not take ATM cards (there is an ATM there). 2. they don't have a lot of alternative items like chicken this and chicken that 3. the soda cups  are too small. They only have a really small size and then a small but larger size 4. People sometimes don't know how to order at the window. You place your order, then step to the side and wait for your finished order to be called. 5. They aren't open 24 hours or late night ( like after midnight) The good stuff 1. The burritos 2. The tacos 3. the staff is cool 4. Basic menu 5. ALWAYS good... I have never had a bad burrito from titios My  final, thought: Titos is the type of place you either LOVE it or really HATE it... there is no in between

I went to Tito's last night, it was my first time visiting the location although I've had their food once before. The tacos are really nothing special, I prefer the shredded beef tacos from Pepe's way more. I split a meat/beans/cheese burrito and it was very yummy right down to the tortilla. The salsa is super yummy as well. Didn't try the guac.   Didn't care for the "cash only" policy (get with the times people) and the line to order is extremely unorganized..I cannot imagine being there during a lunch rush hour! Cashier was not very friendly but I liked her old school hairnet. All in all, the burrito and salsa were good so 4 starts for Tito's Tacos!

It's OKAAAAAAY. Like others, it's not authentic. The lines are long, inside and outside of the place. The menu is simple & not rocket since. The first time I went there, I was expecting a lot since all of my friends have been hyping it up. First bite? Not really impressed. The size of the tacos are huuuuuge and I love the heart clogging deep fried shell. Their house salsa isn't that spicy =( I sometimes have weird & random cravings for Tito's Tacos. It's always an experience to try out new places... especially since it's cheap and they're all about getting your food in your hands ASAP.   Downfall is that they close way too early! Also, cash only. Womp womp.

I have to admit, I don't get why people drive far and wide to eat here. I live walking distance, and rarely partake. Tito's is ok if you are really into a non-authentic, crispy, fried, greesy taco. Good hangover food. But it isn't really all that good. People complain about the line, but it moves so fast, they really shouldn't. I will give them points for making a stand out product. It doesn't really taste like any other tacos I have had, so it does occationally pull you in when you get that bizzare Tito's craving that can't be satisfed by any other taco.

Now this place is a landmark here in LA.  Whenever you come here be expected to see people of all types.  Young, old, rich, poor, famous.  On my last visit there was a transient in front of me ordering food.  (Enriching experience considering she looked and smelled like she played contact football with oscar the grouch)  Then there were two limousines outside as well waiting on their takeout orders.  You have people of all backgrounds here.  Hispanic, Asian, White, Black, you name it everyone comes here.  Quite a following. What about the food?  Well ... it's tacos.  Greasy and piled high with bright yellow mediocre cheddar.  The burritos, not sure if I would call it a burrito, more like a chili wrap.  What is unique and surprisingly outstanding is the guacamole and the salsa. The guac is runny, not thick and chunky and has a uncommon cream green color.  It tastes better then it looks.  The salsa is super liquid like, more so then the guac.  It does not have a strong bold flavor like restaurant and bottled salsa.  It looks like it might be watered down for volume, but nevertheless it goes well with the tacos and chips. The facility itself can make your visit frustrating.  Parking is small and it fills up quick.  The restrooms are shabby.  It gets loud and boisterous especially on weekends and late nights. Some tips that I follow, you might consider 1)  Stick with the tacos 2)  Do not come here during lunch time rush or late night unless you want long waits 3)  The lines inside move faster 4)  CASH ONLY, ATM outside, but $2.50 surcharge! 5)  Tip your order taker especially if you have a large order!  They work hard so share a few bucks. 6)  If you take the salsa or guacamole home, eat it fast because it spoils super quick. So go on in, stand in line, place your order and watch he or she assemble it through the glass.

I can honestly say that Jack In The Box tacos are WAY better than the tacos here. I would give one star, but their all meat burrito was good so that gave it one more star.

I've been coming to Tito's since I was a little kid with my family. It's as much of an LA staple as Pink's Hot Dogs, and definitely one of my favorite spots. It is far from AUTHENTIC Mexican food, but it is yummy, predictable and hits the spot every time! I think I might love their low-budget commercials that run at 2am almost as much as their food LOL!  Be prepared for a wait when you get there, but its worth it. *Tip - If its equally crowded outside as it is inside, go to the inside lines instead - they usually move a bit faster. I love the original taco w/ cheese, re-fried beans, tostada and their yummy guacamole & salsa w/ chips. Don't forget - CASH ONLY!!

I hope my gate security buddies at Gate 7 from Warner Bros don't read this review..... It was highly recommended by them to check this place out once I started my new job at Sony Pictures Entertainment. I finally came here the other night with my cousin. I read the yelp reviews & already sensed that this place was a bit over-hyped. After dining here, Tito's Taco is indeed way over-hyped. I've lived in LA and in the San Gabriel Valley pretty much my entire life and I've had way better tacos and Mexican food. I even think King Taco & Albertos is a lot better tasting than Tito's Tacos& their service surpass Tito's Tacos. There's two order windows, inside and outside. Me and my cousin took some time examining the menu on the wall, price was decent. When placing our order, the  lady at the window was very impatient because we couldn't decide on what we wanted even though we let people go ahead of us, wtf?? My cousin ordered first and gave my cousin attitude cause my cousin decided she wanted cheese in her burrito & i guess she was mad that she had to write that out on the order pad. When it was my turn, I said I wanted the same thing and the b**** gave me attitude cause she was mad that she had to erase the 1 on the paper and write in 2...WTF I wanted to jump over the window and roundhouse kick her in the face. When i paid for the order, the old Asian couple next to me were ordering and another worker seemed to give them attitude too. Ugh wtf is wrong with Tito Tacos worker?? Leave your damn job if you're unhappy, we're in a recession, be freakin grateful to have a damn job. The food:  I was bummed to find out that they only offer hard shell tacos, WTH? We decided to order 2 beef/cheese burritos and 1 taco. Total was less than $5. Our order came with chips and salsa. I actually liked the chips and salsa the best, the chips stayed crunchy and weren't overly oily/greasy, the salsa was okay, not spicy at all. The burritos tasted okay at first but I felt sick after several bites; it was a little too much, needs more ingredients other than just cheese and meat, I barely ate 1/4 of it before tossing it away. The taco was OK, it was pretty much like eating the tortilla chips with meat, cheese, and lettuce, I liked it a little better than the burrito since it had the lettuce, otherwise it just tastes like a taco from Jack In The Box/Taco Bell but less greasy and more crunchy? Meh. I doubt I'll be coming back, mediocre "authentic Mexican food" and crappy service. location seems a bit sketchy. there is a parking lot & available street parking. seating inside and outside. This place is CASH ONLY, they have an ATM outside just in case.

I got home late one evening  half drunk and started watching TV.  Then out of no where some cool melody commercial came on with someone singing "I love Tito's Tacos".  That tune was catchy like crack.   Anyways, the next day I decide to venture to this "Tito's Taco".  I arrive and see a sea of people waiting both inside and outside.  As I wait in line I see that Mr. Tito himself was working the register.  The guy seemed a lot  more friendlier on the commercial as he gave me a dirty stare which almost made me wet myself. So I get up to order and I get two tacos with cheese and a side of rice. The prices were modest and each order came with chips and red juice like salsa.   The rice was pitiful. I wouldn't serve that crap to my worst enemy.  The tacos were okay but nothing special. The appeal of this place is cheap food and fresh cheese for those that like dairy.   Conclusion: The place is overrated. The food is okay and the lines are long.

I like their salsa more than their tacos. It's very plain, has a frothy (whipped)  consistency, and kinda watery. I know, doesn't sound (or look) appetizing but surprisingly it has loads of flavor to it. Not overwhelming but just right. When eaten, I'd describe the taste as light and fresh. It is a great alternative to the chunkier version since it doesn't seem to fill you up as much. The Taco's not bad too. It's different than tacos I would get from a hardcore Mexican restaurant such as El Taco Llama. The way I see it, Titos is the Taco version of In-N-Out. They have the same menu throughout the years, and they keep it consistent. Customers know what to expect and they get it when they go there. Plain and simple...just like the tacos.

I may be giving a biased review, as I grew up eating here, but I still think Tito's deserves the praise it's gotten over the years.  They make traditional Mexican food and the place is a fast-food type eatery, so if you're expecting some magical out-of-body experience, you're likely to be disappointed.  I won't argue that it could be a bit cleaner, but it's hard to penalize this place just for having long lines. Whenever I come to Tito's, I get the tacos with cheese and the meat burrito.  Can't go wrong there.  I'm a lifetime Tito's customer and it's unlikely that will ever change.

I was so disappointed with Tito's. The "taco stand-y feeling" left me convinced I was about to consume authentic Mexican goodness....but alas - I was so wrong. My boyfriend was under the impression that this place would be pretty decent given the following of his colleagues at work, and all of the praises they sing. But what the eff? The guac was so gross even to look at - watery - unnaturally sea foamy green....did I mention - watery? I'm a New Yorker so - my ideal Mexican fast food would have to be Chipotle - and NO ONE can tell me they aren't the shit. I was expecting the same quality of meat, the same options, maybe even some damn sour cream to go with my tasteless tacos overflowing with cheese. Ugh. never again.

Have been here a couple of times in the past. I'm not a fan of their burritos but I do love their tacos, but maybe because I absolutely love cheese and their's seems to be freshly grated... yum! The salsa and chips are the best and are probably the only reason I go back when I can, well besides eating all the cheese....

I picked up Tito's Tacos one night on the way home from work and was pleasantly surprised.  I am strangely picky about my Mexican fast food (usually the greasier the better) and am weary of new places.  However, the constant line at Tito's told me they were doing something right.  And that something: tacos.  Had I only ordered their tacos, they may have squeezed 4 stars out of me.  The hard shell tacos are super cheap and tasty.  Unfortunately, Tall Mexican requested a burrito in addition to his 3 tacos, so I followed suit.  No bueno.  Their bean and cheese burriot was just plain bad. As mentioned in other posts, the parking situation here is unfortunate, but I was lucky enough to grab the last space available so this didn't vex me too much.  Should the need for cheap, greasy tacos arise again, I would definitely consider a return visit to Tito's.

Tito's Tacos is nostalgic for me. Remember the first time you had this thing people were calling tacos? It came in a crunchy yellow shell. It had ground beef. It had lettuce. It had some shredded cheddar cheese and diced tomatoes. It was a generic taco, yes, but it tasted so good. The texture of the whole thing makes me happy. The shell is hard and thicker than usual, but that's to balance out the salsa. And once that salsa soaks into the shell... well... there's truly no other way this texture can be replicated. So, no, it's not authentic Mexican. No, there's no cilantro in sight. But to me, there is beauty in this Americanized taco. I eat here for the same reasons why I go to In-n-Out and order my cheeseburger with ketchup, mustard, pickles, and grilled onions, to recapture those childhood flavors.

I love this place, but it is different from when I was younger. For some reason I thought it was better and bigger when I was a kid. Now that I am all grown I still ove their chips and salsa and their big burritos, but not as good as I remember. Denitely a place to try at least once though. Parking is definitely a pain and the line can be long.

It's all about the all meat burrito, which has shrank considerably in the past years. I ate Tito's growing up and now that I live in San Francisco, I eat Tito's every time I come back. The meat is tender and the tortilla is soft and the whole thing melts in your mouth. There is nothing like it, that's why I wait in the long lines and watch the cashier/food prep people run around like chickens driving bumper cars with patience. My NoCal husband didn't see what the big hype was about as I was bouncing in my seat with burrito in hand. He thought it was like beef stew in a tortilla. I LOVE Tito's and I think it is a taste of LA. Your burrito includes chips and salsa but you should order extra salsa. Small for 2-3 people and large for 4+.

Probably more of a 2.5 stars... It wasn't the worst I have ever had, but I wasn't that impressed. Maybe it is the best on this side of town? With Pepe's in my backyard as my standard for a shredded beef taco, I have a tough time finding one better. I ate two tacos though I ordered three. It wasn't bad...just so-so. So, for all the hype, I was really wanting to adore this place. But, I think it is more of a "we were in the neighborhood, so we ate at Tito's" rather than a destination restaurant.

Let's start with the pros: *fast service *crispiest tortilla I've had *cheap Now the cons: *greasy tacos *bland *having to wait in line Overall, this place is so over-hyped.  I'm still trying to figure out its success.  I think it's the catchy name: Tito's Tacos, and their very crunchy tortilla, and decent sized portions.

Being a local, I can't really hate on Tito's Tacos.  For starters, it's within walking distance of where I live.  It's a step up from Taco Bell if you want to get a more "real" taco.  But it's true, the shells are tough sometimes, the meat is pretty mysterious, the guac a bit watery. Who cares, I just want some tacos!!! 3.5 stars.

Maybe because I've been here since I was a little kid, but despite the reviews I love this place.  True, their salsa is watered down and their lines are long and cash only sucks when you rely on your credit card all the time but someone needs to speak up for this establishment.  You need to keep in mind that this is not a traditional sit down Mexican restaurant - it's fast food. People come here all the time because the food is fresh, hot and cheap.  The decor is lacking but it's always very clean and the service is great.  I haven't sampled everything on their menu since I always order the same thing every time - rice, beans, salsa, chips & tacos.  There are gobs of melted cheese in their beans and their chips are crunchy and fresh.  Their tacos are the hard shell kind but you get plenty of meat, lettuce and cheese.  What more could you want?  You can't help but stuff your face with two tacos and pile on the watery salsa and beg your mom for a quarter so you can play a game of Pac-Man afterward.   Tito's Tacos satisfies a craving for cheap, good Mexican food and it delivers every time.

There's a reason why the line is always insane and the parking is a nightmare - their tacos are cheap and delicious! I never turn down an opportunity to eat there which is saying something because I'm pretty picky when it comes to where I eat.  I'm not saying that this is the best place to get authentic Mexican tacos, but the food is hot, fresh, and tasty.  And it sure beats paying similar prices for crap at Taco Bell or Del Taco.

I am likening Tito's Tacos to McDonalds. The reason for this is because you likely first tried McDs when you were a kid. And if your diet is not too restricted (e.g. veganism, etc.) then you probably still like a Big Mac once in a while, and if you're a vegan you probably still eat the fries when somebody at the market pisses you off and ruins your day. Now, if you tried McDs for the first time in your 30s, you would not at all be impressed. You would find it kind of cheap and gross, and way overrated. Well, this is how Tito's is. I grew up on Titos in Culver City. It is comfort food to us natives, like McDs is to Americans. The tacos are kinda plain, the salsa is ridiculously plain, the guac is awful, the chips are good, the enchiladas like 70s Campos brown-saucy and oniony plain, the rice is pretty much pebble dry. But if you grew up on it, you loved it as a kid when Mexican food was more plain, and you still love it. To summarize, if you heard a lot of hype and never tried it, you won't be impressed at all, unless you have a super midwestern, meat and potatoes, boring palate. If you don't expect too much and want comfort food and ignore the hype, you may enjoy it. If you grew up on Titos then you think it's five stars. FYI, you can place orders of like 70 or 75 bucks or over online, and they will bring it out to the parking lot (an area is allocated) to you. I've done this for office parties. Again, stay away from the rice and guac.

So wrong, yet so right. Don't question the masses, or the grease, or the watery salsa. Just belly up to the counter, order a couple of tacos (with cheese) and enjoy what Tito has to offer. Be sure to get some jalapeños. Don't waste your time with the enchiladas, beans, or rice, however. It's really all about the tacos. Cash only!

Totally overrated. As are many things on the westside.  But i can understand that this taco place is kind of an institution for people who grew up in the area.  So it's more of a nostalgia meal then a, oh my god i gotta go line up for these tacos... I'm not a huge fan of hardshell tacos anyways.. so my opinion might not matter. I prefer my tacos with the double mini corn tortilla dipped in grease, with a nice helping carne asada onions and cilantro.. Also.. the salsa at titos really really sucks... i hate when people make this pureed watered down stuff and try to pass it off.

"I love Tito's Tacos, you'll love Tito's too." Another LA (actually Culver City) icon off the 405 that serves ok food.  Yeah its been around forever but I've had better.  Not "authentic" by any means but decent tacos.  You order through a window and wait.  Salsa is not my favorite; its actually bland.  I wish someone would ask Tito to make a mild and a hot salsa for the folks who like kick.  The tacos are the main thing on the menu but there are other items like burritos and tostadas.  The tacos are shredded beef with cheese and lettuce.  Nothing fancy.  Inside, there's tables but can get packed from time to time.  I'd come back but not very often.

Two of my friends decided that they'd move out to the Santa-Monica-Culver-City-Mar-Vista area together, and they're a nice three-minute walk from Tito's Tacos, so of course we head over one night to try it out. It was a long line, and they're cash only. The tamale was decent, the chips and salsa were adequate. The size of everything was nice for the price you paid (except for the tamale, that was sort of expensive). There's really not much to be said. Or maybe we should've ordered some tacos.

No stars! All I have to say is they should not add a painters bucket of water to the beans and stir it with a shovel in front of the customers.  The meat looks like it was taken from a dirty diaper.  Not quite sure as of why there is always a line.  Scary stuff!

Tito's Tacos has been a staple at family gatherings for as long as I can remember and my relocated aunts have been known to pack burritos to go on the plane. If you like crispy beef tacos with lettuce and cheese - you're ready to go with Tito's. No soft tacos, no chicken tacos, no veggie tacos - just beef tacos. The burritos and tamales are good as well. Tips: Bring cash and make sure you take a minute to enjoy the 50 cent piece you recieve as change. Once you've ordered step aside to let others order and remember who took your order, they'll be bringing back your tacos. no impersonal number system here.

Another one of those places where you see the line and you think "this MUST be good."  Negative. Tito's Taco has huge lines most of the day, so you look at this place, and then you look at Cinco De Mayo down the street, which looks like an empty shack, and you'll obviously choose Tito's. Bad choice.  Long wait, tacos were mediocre, and they have really got to turn on the AC in that place in the summer. I say don't let the line fool you.  Take your business down the street to Cinco De Mayo and you definitely won't be disappointed like I was at Tito's.

Realistically I'd give this place 3.5 stars not a full 4.  But its to no fault of their own really, its just I'm a panzy and don't like to eat hard tacos because its scratches up the roof of my pretty mouth. But based on everything else, if I was a hard taco loving fool like the Ms, then I'd give this place a much higher rating. The service is really quick, the food is pretty good and the jingle I hear on the radio is pretty catchy.  I sing it and it drives my gf crazy, not in the good way.  The menu is kind of limited but not.  You'll get what I mean when you go there yourself. Overall other than parking you should enjoy this place.  I guess I could legitimately give it 4 stars.  If only they served soft tacos and carnitas... Oh yeah! They have Strawberry Soda... =)

I've only had the tacos and they are amazing. They come with salsa and chips. I always get to go because it is crowded inside, but that's to be expected. The taste makes up for the cons: -cash only -busy: parking, seating, long lines -you order and then pay when your food is ready, it's a bit of an odd system. If you frequent Tito's then you know what to expect, and it's worth the wait.

Madre de Dios! This place is a beautiful sanctuary. Shredded beef tacos/tostadas/burritos, for dirt cheap prices! Ok, a few things: it's cash only (but for $20 you could feed a group of 4). The parking sucks most of the time when it's busy, and they close by 7pm. Other than that, if you really just want a plain and simple shredded beef taco or burrito and have $5 on hand, this is a must go-to place. Be warned, you will need a nap after!

I brought my friend to this place so that he could have some local good eats. The tacos that we ordered were pretty good. However, the burritos that were ordered were not the ones that we had asked for. The food in this place is good, but not that great for a taco to be more than two dollars. Nevertheless, it is a popular place for locals and I would probably bring another friend here to taste something local and different.

After a year hearing my friend rave about this place, we finally made a trip to Tito's. Parking is very limited -- you either park on the street or you have to squeeze in between 2 badly parked cars in the parking lot. If it weren't for my friend, I wouldn't have known where to stand and not to stand, as the lines were a mix of people ordering and waiting for their food. It must've been we're-old-people-so-we're-gonna-be-rude night because this lady backed into me, turned around and gave me a dirty look. Umm, wtf?! I was then sandwiched between these 2 old ladies who pretty much yelled into my ear asking what they were gonna order. Alright... So I placed my order, stepped aside and later stepped back into the line to pick up my food. I got myself 2 tacos with mystery meat and the works. Meh. I prefer the mystery meat tacos from Jack in the Box. The only thing I actually enjoyed was the salsa and chips.

Coming to this place brings me back to my UCLA days.  There's nothing like a couple of tacos after class.  Prices have gone up significantly, I  remember when the tacos were $1.15 and their now $1.75.   The salsa in the new containers just don't taste as good as they did in the old styrofoam ones, maybe it's just me.

I always get two tacos w. cheese, a side of guacamole, and extra salsa. Maybe because I've been coming here all my life, and have tried other mexican fast food places, but nothing seems to compare to Titos. This would be one place I'd have to ea att before I die :) and just talking about Titos makes me want some right now! ps, it's always good to go with two people, one to stand in line and the other to save a table because it can get crowded depending on what time you go. i usually park on the street because their parking lot is small.  they only take cash

Has been one of my favorite, got to stop by when I'm in LA, places.  It is very traditional on the mexican...nothing fancy and no texmex aKa Taco bell style here.   Chunky meet in the burritos.  Always packed.  But pretty quick any way.  The last time I visited was just last week and the burritos didn't match my romanticized memory, probably been 5 years or more since I had been there.  They are a little smaller, and doesn't have the same zest.  Still good and still a favorite and if you are in L.A. you need to just swing by for this local tradition that dates back 30 years.....

getting down to the point of this highly overrated establishment: salsa = pinkish puree of foamy watery tomatoes. sorry, but real salsa isn't pink and it typically has a lot more flavor & ingredients than just tomatoes. guacamole = should be renamed as a 'green cold liquid with a hint of avocado flavoring'. tacos = lumpy bland beef mixture topped with hard pre-shredded cheese, which i'm sure is of very low quality. tortilla chips = hard bean/rice/cheese burrito = typical, made in a hurry burrito. nothing special. now, i've eaten here numerous times (not on my own accord) and what i've just described is the norm. they weren't just having an off day. it is cheap, you really do get what you pay for here.

The carne asada, and beans (the 2 main factors of this resturaunt) is always hot and ready to go and the burritos are delicious! So why a 4??

The only thing better than a Tito's Taco is two! Or three, or ten.  I've been going to this place since high school, and even after moving far away from the area, I will make a trip down there at least once a month just to go eat.  The tacos are yummy, but they gotta have cheese.  I recommend the bean and meat burrito with cheese.  YUM. The SALSA is the best around.  Not spicy, just blended and  tomato-y.  Make sure to go there with an open mind.  If you plan on authentic Mexican, skip Tito's.  Its definitely a Mexi-merican hybred.  But, if you crave cheap mexi-merican food, drop by.  Oh, and plan on waiting in line and possibly eating in your car...the lines suck and so does the seating.

The perfect union of taco shell, shredded beef and tomato salsa.  The secret ingredient is the salt and pepper salsa, which is even more addictive than ketchup for your burger and fries.   But Tito's Tacos could very well be named "Tito's Burritos", as the single best item on the menu is their all-meat burrito--a delicious mixture of tender beef nuggets, stewed in a dark brown meat sauce, and tightly wrapped in a flour tortilla.

this place is OKAYYYY.. not the best place to eat taco's but whatever. If you like taco's from del taco and taco bell, then you would really like this place!! but if you're a little authentic mexican eater and like King's taco's and hole in the wall taco places like me, then this is definitely not the place for you! They don't really have a place to eat other then the benches outside of their place. The menu is super big and they have a different variety/combos of taco's to eat here. The crunchy taco's is what everyone makes a big fuss about. I don't personally like it but most people do. There is ALWAYS a big line outside, but like I said if you like taco's that are more americanized like del taco or del taco, then this is the place for you! =)

Uh, I understand the lines were long and the place was packed. That does NOT necessarily mean the food is good. I guess I don't like tacos in the first place. The guacamole tasted like water. The chili con carne was overpriced. They were generous with the chips but the salsa was watery. The tacos were crunchy but whatever kind of meat they were using, it didn't taste fresh. They did NOT have raspberry ice-tea... Their parking lot was tiny... I didn't hate this place. I just didn't like it enough.

It's a LA tradition dude. You gotta love it. The beef burritos are heart stoppers. The tacos are greasy, the beans are ranchero style, and none of it will ever make headlines. But I loved my grandma's cooking, and no one ever wrote headlines about her either! The lines are there because in LA, we love it! I love the fact that whenever I eat there, it's like being at the united nations. You got suits, labor, homeless and everything in between. If you don't like the crowd, then you don't belong anywhere. And the service is crazy mixed up too.

Long lines and massive crowds I thought this must be IT.  You know, one of those places that everyone has to try once.  Well, I tried it once and I'm not thrilled nor disappointed. We were in town for the holidays and my honey's dad couldn't stop talking about Tito's soooo we made the trek down to get some good eats.  I had a taco, tamale, and beans.  I liked everything just fine but I wasn't wowed.  The only item that came close to being fantastic goodness was the salsa.

This is a simple and cheap take-out place with the crunchiest tacos around.  I've been there twice and I love it. Although it's a cash-only place and the way they take your order and prepare it are inefficient, you will find yourself craving their tacos.  The pulled beef (only option) in the taco gives it heartiness.  The combination of crunchy shell, chewy (in a good way) beef, and refreshing lettuce makes for a brilliant texture. A side of chips and salsa is included with your order.  The chips are just as crunchy as the taco shell, and the salsa is extremely liquid.  Even if the salsa seems to be spiced with a combination of jalapeno pepper and black pepper, it's not hot.  The beauty of the liquid salsa is you can safely pour it on top of the taco!

If you like cheap Mexican food that is pretty good for its price then Tito's is your kind of spot. Everything is cheap and comes in cardboard boxes. Its always fairly busy, when you get in line just keep in mind that it moves pretty fast so have your order ready when you get to the window out of respect for the other customers. The menu includes: Burritos, tacos, tamales, tostadas. My favorite is the plain old tacos smoothered with tito's tomato salsa (tastes like tomato puree with salt and pepper in it). I have never been disappointed with tito's and when family flies in from out of town, they often request we get tito's for lunch or dinner.

This is Mexican food the way it was meant to be.  I like to say the taco's are just like mom used to make, but that isn't really true.  My mom isn't Mexican and she never had a deep frier. But if you do have a chance to eat here, try the taco's.  I dream about them every once in a blue moon. They are straight from heaven.  Just make sure you get lots of salsa to throw on top and enjoy.   The food is good any time of day, but is extra good after a night out with the guys.

This place has some kind of secret magnet.. Without fail, whenever I run into traffic taking the 405N back to Westwood, I get off the freeway  and my car automatically goes left on Washington Place.... I don't understand this phenomenon.. The taco's are greasy and delicious (get them with cheese), the guacamole is terrible, and everything else I have tried has been underwhelming... But for Tacos, Tito's is hard to beat! Edit:  Btw, the taco's are by no means authentic mexican food, but for what it is it's really tasty.  In fact, I want one right now.

I understand this place is an institute here in LA. I understand that its very nostalgic for old timers who have been eating here their entire lives. But as an unbiased passer by...I'd have to say...I will not be returning. Here was my basic experience. My boyfriend and I came on a Sunday night...and naturally (given the hype surrounding this place) the place was just PACKED. At first, I thought, "okay, if its really delicious then of course there will be a lot of people, and with a lot of people comes a lot of waiting." But as we stood there in line, dreaming about our tummies full of tacos, I realized something. Wait a minute...every order is taking like 20 minutes to fill...why is this? OH. Its because inside, Tito's is so disorganized that the workers are literally tripping over themselves to accomplish tasks like getting change for a 20, or putting napkins in a to-go container. Ergh! But hey...to be fair I get cranky on an empty stomach, so my rating is NOT based on the service...but on the quality of the food... ...yeah. Really not the best (in my opinion.) The "guacamole" really only resembled real guacamole in color, and not in ANYTHING else. Didn't taste OR feel like avocados...in fact, it didn't taste much like anything besides the watery mess that it was. Redeeming factor - my boyfriend said his burrito was a-okay. So, I'm probably just overreacting...but...just to be on the safe side, don't order the guacamole.

Ok fine. The wait is long, parking can be a little rough if you are impatient, and it's not the most glam joint in the world, but what Tito's is truly about is simple, delicious tacos. You won't find a giant menu here, so if variety is your thing, you may want to try something else. What Tito's offers is amazing, fresh tacos that will capture your taste buds satisfaction in an instant. They are delicious, period. The salsa is probably what really brings all the ingredients together and you will never taste anything like it. I was always being told about Tito's and figured I would be disappointed simply by how hyped up people were making it. I was NOT disappointed, and still find it a treat to make a Tito's run.

Greetings Yelpers! Stopped past Tito's the other day for the first time since the late 80's. I must say the place has changed a bit, Tito's is kind of run down, dirty floors and WE had to clear a table to sit down! Boooo The taco's are not  stuffed like they once were and my favorite (side of beans and rice) would probably be a portion size for a 5 year old kid with a small appetite. The food still tasted good, like any other fast food Mexi spot. Tito's needs some fine tuning. Make that a complete tune-up.

Is this place FOR REAL? I read all these good reviews on this place, so I decided to go & wait in the 45 minute line... What I ended up with was the worst taco's i've ever had in my life!! Who ever would of thought that a taco could be dry??? The meat was painfully dry! Seriously. I had to chew over & over again and drink water to get some moisture mixed in.  Was terrible. Threw out after 1 bite. The salsa also takes like water with crushed dried red peppers mixed in. I was also over charged... and they dont even give you time to show them they messed up bc their system there is so ridiculous & the people handling the cash also make your food!!!! Worst experience!

I love Tito's Tacos! Simplicity, that's what makes this place great. To many Mexican restaurants have a menu the size of an encyclopedia and the food just gets lost in translation. Always better to go with a few items done well than 1000 mediocre/crap ones. Many of the industrial fed automatons that review these tacos as bland, boring, taco bell is better etc...are just clueless, go stick your head back in the dorito bag. Not everything you eat has to punch you in the tongue with waaay to much salt, seasonings and artificial flavors. Tender braised beef, shredded and chopped that taste like....beef! Not a package of chili seasoning! Fresh crunchy corn tortilla, copious amounts of shredded cheddar, crisp shredded lettuce, awesome! It does need a little punch of flavor to kick it up a bit and that's where the salsas come in. The tomato based salsa that comes with the taco's, burritos etc..taste like freshly pureed tomato with a little onion and chile, really nice. Also ask for a side of the spicy salsa that tastes alot like diced pickled jalapeno. Add these two condiments to your taco, burrito whatever and bam, all those great base flavors are boosted to another delicious level.

It's not authentic but it's not "gringo" either. I finally tried this place after all the years I've worked in Culver City. It took me about 4 minutes to get there from work and about 30 minutes to get back in my truck after ordering it. It was packed as expected on a Friday at 11:30 am. I ordered one original Tito's Taco and a Beef Bean and Cheese Burrito. It looked like shredded beef and had a decent sauce. They added an abundant amount of cheese and meat. The burrito wasn't super big but was filling. The taco was also a good size with a favorable amount of cheese and meat. After reading some reviews, I was skeptical about the quality but for the price and where it is located, it wasn't too bad. They only take cash and good luck finding parking on a busy day. I saw some firefighters parking almost against traffic across the street to get to Tito's..

It's all in the salsa as far as I'm concerned. I've only ever ordered tacos from here, never anything else. To me, without the salsa, a Tito's Taco ain't nuttin! The lines are always long, and I always wait in it. That goes to show this place is by no means serving foul tasting food, just maybe a smidge bit over rated. I can't tell you what the beef taste like on its own, I've never paid enough attention to its texture or taste alone. Only combined with shell,cheese and salsa as a taco. I have notice, however, how crunchy the taco shell is. Hurts my teeth. No me gusta. I could probably ask for soft shell though, so I don't fault Tito's.

Really good tacos here, and their guacamole is delicious too. It's not a very well-kept secret though... at any time, there's a really long line either outside or inside.

Ignore the late-night TV commercial though, which is one of the worst commercials I've seen, and actually nudges me into NOT going!

Not your typical taqueria, but still excellent, tasty and fresh. I have been eating at Tito's for the past 35 years and not one thing has changed. I remember having Tito Taco's day at St. Augustine's school down the road. The food, flavors, and the way the serve the food has always remained the same. I think this is a good thing. It looks like the lesser kind reviews do not get what Tito's is about. Tito's is not like the Mexican food that you can find nowadays at your neighborhood taqueria. If you can forgive that then you're half way to bliss. Everytime I visit LA I bring a cooler so I can ice a dozen burritos to take home a freeze for eating later on. (BTW--They reheat in the oven perfectly.) The tacos and burritos with cheese rock. It will be sad day if this place every closes.

I used to LOVE this place during my college days, but I think that I go there more for nostalgic reasons and whenever I need to grab a quick bite (since I live nearby).  Don't get me wrong, I still think the tacos are great, but the "meat" and bean burrito that I used to get doesn't taste the same anymore.  I think that it is great for the $$ but there are a lot of taco restaurants that are better.  (Try Pacos Tacos down the street on Centinela.)  It still has a slight charm that brings me back every so often. The chips and salsa are awesome.

The Mecca of Mexican Food, in the opinion of this Chinese-American kid from San Francisco. For less than $2, you can get a meaty crispy taco with cheese. They pack in the meat, the shell is always fresh and crispy, and they add enough cheese so it spills out. Where else can you get something so delicious for so little dough?!? I can usually engulf 4 tacos, but my last visit I decided to go for 3 and one chicken tamale. Tamale was quite excellent too. They give ample chips on the side too. One could easily spend over $10 for meal here, but you leave satisfied and wanting more. If you are near LA, GO HERE for some of the best tacos on the planet!

I don't think I can claim any Culver City cred until I write up Tito's Tacos.  I just moved to the area, only to discover that Tito's is right around the corner from my new pad.  This was quite the discovery, as many people have been raving about Tito's to me for some time.  I have seen peoples eyes get very wide when I tell them that Tito's is a quick sprint from my new apartment.  Apparently this carries a lot of weight in some circles. I like the tacos - they are cheap, tasty and filling.  They definitely do the trick.  What really gets me about Tito's is how f'ing good the salsa is!!  Seriously, I can't figure out what they make it out of.  It doesn't really matter, as I just can't get enough of it.  It is by far the best salsa I have found at a cheap-ass taco stand.   So there you have it: Tito's - Come for the Tacos, Stay for the Salsa.

This place has become landmark  to LA residents and the food is good for what it is.  I repeat, good for what it is.  This isn't a gourmet restaurant, it's independent fast food.  You won't find the ultimate taco here.  There is nothing creative going on, they're not even serving traditional soft tacos.  In reality, their food isn't high quality, but it is tasty.  As long as your expectations are reasonable, you're going to like it. I rarely stray from the tacos... occasionally I'll throw in a cheese enchilada for variety, but it's all about the tacos (w/ cheese).  Generously pour on some salsa and away you go.  The burritos are mediocre, but like I said, it's all about the tacos (w/ cheese). There will be lines, but don't let them scare you away.

In a city overflowing with burrito joints, it's truly impossible to name one "best." I've been going to Tito's since I was a little lad and I still feel that there is something "special" about the place. Though they have a very limited menu, everything that they do, they do right. The bean/cheese burrito can't be beat. The salsa is simple, yet flavorful. and the enchiladas are TRULY a vegetarian's dream. And judging by the long lines 7-days/week, you know this place is built on a solid love of Mexican eats. Basically, I think Tito's has the best simple burrito for the same reason I think ESSA BAGEL in Manhattan has the best bagel.... simply because they DO. PS: if it's crowded inside, check the much overlooked "back patio" where the workers break and eat.

I once stood outside in the rain to get Tito's Tacos. It's THAT good. I live in Orange County... but every once in a while I just have to drive to Culver City to get some Tito's. They have amazing Tacos. And everything else on the menu is great too! Plus, every meal comes with free chips and salsa! When I go there with friends we barely speak as we inhale our food. Seriously. Parking isn't the best.. but you can usually find a spot up the street under the freeway. The last time I went they were still only accepting CASH... but they do have an ATM available. The lines can be pretty long most of the time... but that's just what you have to deal with when eating at such a great place.  You just wait it out! seating is pretty limited... but strangely enough my friends and i have always found a table. When ordering you must remember who you ordered from so as not to slow down the line when they come back with your food!  I usually follow the person with my eyes.  You definitely don't want to be "that guy." Tito's Tacos is one of my favorite places to eat in L.A.

I loved Tito Tacos -- back in my West LA - UCLA days. They are very simple. CASH ONLY! Lines are always long and parking lot is packed. Yes, there are better taco places out there but on a college budget it was cheap and filing. I think I liked it because of all the cheese and chips. Salsa was good but make sure you ask for the Verde...much better. I think the salsa makes the tacos taste better. Menu is very, very simple kind of reminds me of in & out not very much chooses. If you are in the area, it's worth a try.

One of my favorite meat burrito and taco places. Been going here for years. Whenever I'm in the West side I try to make a stop here. Love their meat burritos, tacos, chips & salsa. It's a welcome change to the taco trucks, Chipotle, Del Taco, and smaller Mexican restaurants near my place. Prices are cheap. Almost the entire menu items are under $5 unless you order more obviously. Some things they lack: sour cream, spicier salsa, fish burritos/tacos, CARNE ASADA FRIES. If they had some of these, it would get that extra star. Introduced some of my friends to the legendary Titos Taco. Most enjoy it while some hate it. If your planning to check this place out, recommend NOT going during peak hours which is during lunch time or when people get off work in the early evening. Long lines. It's a love it or hate it place. And I definitely love it. You can only make up your mind by tasting their awesome food here. You're no longer a newbie to LA, once you've been here. Love it or hate it.

Casual setting, nothing fancy, a basic menu to choose from. What I order is usually the bean and cheese burrito, couple tacos and a regular burrito. Prices are cheap, and the food is really delicious. Just thinking about Titos, makes me wish I was back home. I MISS U CALI!

Tito's is an establishment unto itself. I remember coming here when I was little and being amazed at the lines of people walking away with boxes upon boxes of their famous taco. Now for those expecting a gourmet  or authentic taco, Titos may not be the spot for you. It's greasy, deep fried, cheesy delicious taco, way better than any fast food stand could make. And they give you a boatload of chips and salsa. You can not deny an L.A. tradition.

Love this place! The tacos rock and the beef burrito/chilli are delish. The only reason I can see that people give it poor reviews is that they bought into the hype about Titos. It's a great taco stand...not nirvana.

Great food! Local landmark. Won NBC's "Golden Local" award. The taco's are one of the few reasons i wish i still ate meat. Yes, I'm Veg, and still love this mildly greasy taco place. Tacos, Tostadas, Chips + Salsa, "guacamole"..........all great. Not a huge Tito Burrito fan though. The cheese is freakishly good. I know, random, but still crazy good.

I do NOT know what all the fuss is about.  I lived in close proximity to this place and there's ALWAYS a line.  So I decided to give it a try...bad idea! Shredded Beef Tacos:  fried to perfection but is that really difficult?  Meat dry and flavorless.  Piled high with lettuce as a filler, sprinkle of cheese and splash of tomatoes.  Nothing special. Salsa:  Watery tomato sauce with diced onion.  Blech Did I try the wrong item on the menu??  Maybe growing up in East L.A. has spoiled my taste buds to the likes of El Tepeyac in Boyle Heights or maybe it was the weekend trips to Puerto nuevo for real Mexican food. Maybe I'll give it another try...but def not anytime soon!

So. Tito's seems to be a pretty polarizing topic here on El Yelpo, and I fall squarely into the pro-Tito category. Best menu items: Taco with cheese Tostada with cheese I can eat four items but most people should only order 2 or 3 don't order extra chips because your food will come with chips anyway

Seriously.... anyone giving this place less than 4 starts needs to have their head examined. Yes it's greasy, yes it's not the highest quality meat.... but that's not why people come here... well maybe if they like grease.  Bottom line, it's for people who want a little nostalgia and a damn good cheap taco that will drop a few days off your life expectancy.  This is not the place if you're looking for a fresh organic green salad with a Foo-Foo presentation lunch.  Taco, Grease, Cheese... Smile

Sorry, but I'm just not a fan. I remember ordering a beef and bean burrito; it basically tasted like a piping hot, day-old can of dennison's chili slathered with semi-melted cheese. It's not particularly cheap, they don't take credit cards and the line sucks. AND there's never any place to sit. If someone is making a Tito's run and wants to bring me a taco... sure, I'd eat it... they're not THAT bad. But that's about as far out of my way as I'm willing to go to get my hands on one.

Tito's Tacos is one of those places where no matter what mood I'm in, it's gonna hit the spot. Then again I am quite partial to Mexican food, it's definitely one of the favorites. It might be a little pricey but your tacos, enchiladas, etc. do come with some freshly made salsa and tortilla chips. It's worth the wait. If you're in the area and you're craving from some tacos, this is definitely a place to check out. If you haven't been, you are missing out!

So my girlfriend had said we would discover this place together but she went without me. Oh well The menu is simple either a taco or a burrito. You have to follow your order kinda like Pink's. The tacos were nice and crunchy and I am more of a soft taco person. The burrito really fills you up, I only had half and I was ready to quit. The experience was more awesome because it was a nice rainy night, and the food was major tasty, the one draw back is no credit cards accepted.

So I tried their tacos and wasn't blown away. My friend had told me this place was really good but I still wasn't expecting much. With that said, I wasn't too disappointed. The tacos were okay and they filled me up. The chips were all right (pretty much the same thing as the taco shell) and I didn't enjoy their salsa. I don't think I'd come here again, but I guess it's worth a try if you've never been here. In short: Tacos were okay.

Been going to Tito's my entire life, always a family favorite! Have had everything on the menu. This is a small place. The menu is on the wall, you stand in line inside or outside and place your order. The same person who takes your order makes your food. There is not a lot of seating, some inside and a little outside. Small parking lot. Tito's is always, always busy!! and there is a reason why, is damn good! Tacos are meet, lettuce and cheese (cheese is extra but a must). Tostadas are a corn tortilla beans, lettuce and cheese. Bean and cheese burrito are big and good. The meat burritos are just meat and big and good. The enchiladas are good, the sauce is a little thicker then most. Always get a side of rice. The salsa is a must and delicious! Cash only!

Say what you will about Tito's, but this place at least does what they do the right way. Their tacos are good and their salsa is awesome. I could put that stuff on a shoe and it would taste good. This place does tacos in the fattiest way possible because they fry the meat along with the taco shell so after eating just two you will already start to feel them weighing you down. Nothing fancy, just meat lettuce and cheese (if you want cheese) But boy, when you DO ask for cheese, they do not disappoint. I really like that now you can order their stuff online ahead of time, even if the order minimum is pretty high. But hey, if you're going to get tacos, you might as well go all out. I used their online system around 1 o'clock to place my order for pick up at 7:30 and it worked perfectly! I got about 20 tacos and three burritos, chips, salsa and guacamole. Everything was ready when my boyfriend went to get the order and they seriously hooked us up with chips and salsa. We still have two huge bags to go through. The food was all still warm and fresh when he got home and I couldn't help overindulging just a bit on those tasty tacos. Our whole group enjoyed our fatty feast, and a couple of our friends were actually having Tito's for the first time. So glad I could be the one to bring them to the dark side....mwahahaha! The burritos we got (all meat, meat and cheese and meat, bean&cheese) were good but definitely not what I would recommend getting here (unless you cover it in salsa) While the beef is really good and very tender, the chili sauce is just a little too deep and dark. The complex flavor reminded me of an enchilada sauce, kind of smokey but mellow, very unique for sure. Just not my cup o' tea. If you like simple, yummy, crispy shredded beef tacos (which I do!) fresh salsa and bags of chips bigger than your head, then this is your place. I should probably head to the park and feed the ducks for the next month with all these chips we still have.

The first time I went to Tito's I was underwhelmed.  Then I got Tito's on the brain----I kept thinking about the meal and couldn't wait to go back.  Now it's my favorite taco place.  I love the guacamole. It's a little thin and has an unusual taste, which I love.  So good unusual, not bad unusual.  I love the thicker chips and their salsa is the best.

We were looking for a place to eat near westwood and though this is a bit farther, when my friend brought it up, I was excited to try it. Pulled up into the parking lot and though it's small, we didn't have trouble finding a spot. People are constantly coming and going so I don't think it's too much an issue. I noticed there's another taco place right next to this place but it looked very empty. Here, they have two areas of lines, one outside and one inside. Outside was popping but I went inside and the lines were much shorter. I was prepared to wait awhile but only had to wait like 3 minutes before ordering. You pay and food came out relatively quickly. Again, like the parking lot, we didn't have trouble finding a table to eat at. I didn't believe my friend when he said they only offer two kinds of tacos - one with cheese and one without. These are also hard shell tacos btw. What? - where's the different kind of meats? The only offer "mystery" meat. I couldn't tell if it was beef or pork or maybe a mix of the two but it sure was delicious. I got one of each. They put so much cheese on the cheese one that I just transferred some of the cheese from one taco to the one without cheese. Saves you 60 cents. Now I was starving and these two tacos along with the chips and salsa that comes with it was plenty enough. I contemplated ordering the burrito or tamale when I was ordering but I was glad I didn't. I was stuffed afterwards. I know people complained about the salsa and although it may be watery and not authentic at all, I liked it and thought it was fresh and still had flavor and was not spicy (bc I'm not a spicy fan). We also got a side of guacamole for a little bit extra. And this I lathered on like every bite of my taco. Again it was a bit watery but had a little bit of a kick and ultimately gave a different texture to my pretty much dry taco. This seems like a perfect place to come after a few drinks but alas it's not open late night. And too bad I don't live close enough to be able to bring these bad boys home to enjoy with a beer. Mmm, I def recommend.

A west side institution. The long lines speak to the loyalty of their customer base; in the In-N-Out,  Krispy Kreme category. Tacos are OK but need a little spicing up.  Ask for jalapeños on the side. Parking around there is precious.  And bring cash; there's apparently no word for "plastic" in espanol.

This local taco/burrito place has been around since the beginning of time AND still has generations of tito's tacos followers. Here's another place that doesn't mess with what they're good at - tacos and burritos. Simple menu but who needs a million versions of tacos??? Real beef slow cooked in some kinda oh-so-flavorful spices and shredded for its tacos, chunky for the burritos. Salsa is not chunky that some may have an aversion to. But not to the bajillion of us that are TT's regulars because the spices they use for their salsa has just enough of everything that makes everyone want to pour it onto everything. Their chips and tortilla (corn and flour) are homemade too.  Chips aren't extra $. They come with every order along with the salsa. Tempted yet?

I guess I'm still holding onto the old Tito's I grew up with. After they installed the ATM (it's a cash only place), flat screen security monitors, and got a commercial I feel like they became sell outs when it came to their food. I personally still love their bean and cheese burritos, but it's almost impossible to screw that up. Their salsa is pretty watered down now and the tacos with cheese are way overpriced. But they always have a line in front and a full parking lot, so they must still be doin well for themselves. Helpful hint for orders $75 or more - you can place orders online.

I had to edit from 4 stars to 5 stars.  1 - Cause I just ate their for the second time this week and it was DELICIOUS and 2 - because all these whiny little 1 star people don't get it. It never claims to be authentic and never claims to be gourmet cuisine. Some of these people are SO bitter.  Anyway, read on... OK. It's not authentic and the lines are long and the first time I went I didn't like the tacos OR the chips or the salsa.  But the 2nd time you think "Hmm, it's not that bad."  Then the third time you think "OK. It's not very good but I really like this salsa/ gazpacho stuff"  and by about the 4th time you realize they put crack in their burritos and tacos to make sure you keep coming back. And you're a little sad that you've become a crack addict but you keep going there a few times a week to eat their deep fried tacos WITH CHEESE. ALWAYS WITH CHEESE.  And you not only resign yourself to the fact that you now love their food, but you praise the fact that you can walk there in about 3 minutes. Mmmmm

I drive from Santa Clarita to Culver City 5 days a week for work. If any of you know the 405....then you know that it takes 4 or 5 hours to get anywhere using that damn freeway. However, Titos Tacos makes that all worth it. Its the only saving grace to working here. Personally, everything on the menu is great, because you get exactly what you pay for. Titos doesnt pull any punches. Either you like the taco, or you don't. With that being said, 2 tacos and a drink is THE way to enjoy titos. Don't eat too much, because it will become bland.  Eat too little, and you'll still be hungry. And make sure you get it with cheese, because it melts just enough to keep all of the lettuce in the hard shell. This place is a must for anybody remotely interested in solid, no punches pulled Mexican food.

I don't care how long you have lived in Los Angeles, if you have not had Tito's Taco's, then you are still a tourist in my eyes. This West Side cult restaurant has changed mexican food for me. First and foremost, it's cheap! I don't think there is a thing over $2 on the menu so no matter what your budget is Tito's is always an option. My personal favorites: *Tacos: made with shredded beef and lettuce (cheese optional) these tacos are everything I could ever ask for. *Salsa: Tito's salsa is fresh, not too spicy, and flowing like the salmon of Capistrano. *Beans: Refried, hot and soooo good. I usually add salsa to them and add that to my Taco, it really takes the meal to the next level They also offer, burritos, tamales, tostadas and enchiladas. Everything is simple and delicious. The lines can get long, but they move fast, and (unlike Pinks Hot Dogs) it's well worth the wait. Insider tip, they put a ton of cheese on your taco so if you are getting more then one taco, ask for cheese on one and then spread it on the others to save a buck or two. Speaking of.....it's cash only so be sure to raid your piggy bank before you head down. The only thing better then a Tito's Taco.....is TWO!!

I decided to try Tito, because there are not that many cheap food places around that area. I am a tiny girl and do not eat much, so their chili is enough for my lunch. I like this place, I spent maybe less than $2 for a chili and they provided chips and salsa for free. Enough fulfill my tummy. I cannot rate their burritos, since I only had chili beans and a taco. Taco is ok. but I love their chili beans. So rich, full of meat and beans...yummy.... Really! I LOVE IT!

This place should be called "Tito's Burritos."  The tacos are basically larger version of Del Taco's tacos, with more cheese.  Tacos only come in beef versions.  Not very "authentic" mexican food.  Authentic hardshell tacos are made by frying a corn tortilla so its similar to a chip, not baking it. However, the bean rice and cheese burritos are awesome.  Lots of beans, lots of rice, tons of cheese.  About as filling as a Chipotle burrito, but more Mexican (Chipotle is Cuban food, dammit). Service is damn quick, even when there's a ton of people in line.  You order, then that lady runs back, gets your order together, and then you pay. Cash only, which is kind of a bummer, but there's an ATM outside.

I'm writing this review, because I've been accused of not writing enough yelps. Titos tacos is nasty and salty and greasy and made with lard.  That's why its so damn good.  Yes the salsa IS amazing, the chips are yummy.  The green salsa (you gotta ask for it) is just spicy enough.  The enchiladas are oily but hey... they're enchiladas, not friggin salad. Parking sucks and that costs them 1 star.

Titos Tacos... Not sure why everyone boasts about them. They are not the greatest tacos in the city of Los Angeles. I finally tried their tacos this weekend and I really dig the taste of Shredded Beef instead of Ground Beef in their hard shell tacos. But even with the change in beef, I still don't understand why there are huge lines waiting to get these tacos? I do like how they give you plenty of chips and Salsa although, the salsa taste like it has a bit too much lemon in it...   Overall In my opinion, titos tacos is mediocre... but... If you're in the vicinity and don't mind waiting 5-10 minutes for your order than I say give it a try. Who knows, you may like it...

Food is great if you ask me, but I know a couple of people that thing differently. Honestly, I could eat here every day if I could but I would definitely gain 5 lbs a week or so. The tacos and burritos are the best which goes great with their salsa which isn't spicy at all. If you want some spice on your food, you should ask the person who took your order for a side of Jalapeños which are free. The bad part like all other have mentioned is their parking (-1 star). This can be somewhat a pain in the ass since most of the time (lunch hrs / Friday / Sat / Sun) the parking lot is booked. You'll have to find parking right next to the freeway which is also a pain in the ass since you'll have to jaywalk your way to this place.

Titos is great! Food: Greasy lovely tacos that I have been eating since I was old enough to chew. Chips are ok, but the tacos and the orange soda is what keeps me coming back. By the way, the salsa is runny, get over it. Service: It is a one stop shop. The person that takes your order is the same person that makes it, assembles it and takes your money. Germaphobes need not come and everyone is usually friendly. Wrap it up: Don't bother with the lot, just park on the street and enjoy the succulent tacos! :)

Titos tacos! Titos tacos is good, but it's a little too expensive for the type of tacos being served. The line is just too long, it makes you not want to go just because you will have to face the monster line. The tacos are nothing without out the tomatoe salsa, so make sure you receive it. Eating inside is almost impossible, it's better if you get them to go.

It was worth the drive down the 405 S. I arrived at Tito's Tacos on a Tuesday night around 8:10pm. The restaurant was full and there were endless lines. You can stand in line if you're dining in or you may order through a large window outside for take out. Stood in line outside and 20 minutes later it was my turn. I said to the not so friendly lady at the window, May I please get (2) Tito's Taco with Cheese (cheese is an additional .50 cents) the lady said okay. About 3 minutes later she handed me a box and said total is $4.48. Two delicious hard shell tacos with shredded beef, shredded lettuce and shredded mild cheddar cheese. Complimentary chips and house salsa was so worth it. Pros: good Mexican fast food at reasonable prices Cons: staff not very friendly, CASH Only But I will definitely drive back!! (only have after the traffic rush)

Ok, I have read some of the reviews about Tito's and seen the ratings and for people to rave and claim this is the best place for Mexican tacos, WRONG!!!!! Is it good, yes. Will I go again, sure. But to say it is the best is absurd. First off, real authentic Mexican tacos are not supposed to look like a glorified Jack In the Box taco. The only difference between the two is that Tito's uses a lot more cheese and the beef is better. This is called an American version of the taco. Second the side of guacamole was runny as the salsa. I am not crazy about guac that has been liquified in a blender. The salsa was alright, could have used some more kick, it is very mild. So for all these reasons I give it a 3 rating but it works in a pinch and tasted fine after not eating all day and after a round of golf.

The food is cheap.  This is Tito's claim to fame.  However, the food really isn't that great.  Tito's is more of a feeding station than a restaurant.  They give you ridiculous amounts of chips with whatever you order.  The ingredients are not prepared with care, but feel more like they are from Taco Bell in overdrive. Parking is awful, service is assembly-line, and seating feels like a cafeteria.   If this description excites you, check it out, if not, check out a better Mexican restaurant.

I use to live a few blocks away but b/c the lines is super long I didn't end up going very often.   This place in my mind is kind of like Pinks Taco.  There is no real reason why this place is so busy all the time.  The food is not spectacular.. There is no service.. The atmosphere.. no atmosphere..  But I think that is part of the beauty of this place.  A tourist attraction that you must go and check off your list.   For me I get cravings for their meat and cheese burritos.  It's not that it is really good or anything.  It's just to my likings.  Well the cilantro in the salsa is a good touch as well.   bottom line:  go once to check off the list.  Go again b/c it is cheap and fills your stomach.   check

So, after being told numerous times, I finally checked this place out. I was a bit disappointed.  First, their lines were organized.  I couldn't tell where to stand to order and, then, pick up my food.  It was quite haphazard.  KING TACO has a better system. Their menu's too basic.  They need to be more specific in what you get.  When I ordered my food, I had no idea that it came with chips and salsa. Had I known, I would've ordered guacamole with it. The food, itself, was okay.  It didn't impress me at all.  I don't see why others love it.  It's nice if you want something to fill your stomach.  The salsa I was given was pureed and tasteless. Would I go again?  Nah.  But, should it stay around?  Sure, if others love it, more power to them.

Tito's Tacos was recommended to me by my landlord so I decided to go check it out after work one day. I biked there and was rather horrified at the chaotic mess in front of the store. I had absolutely no idea what to get as I didn't even know where the menu was. I played safe and just asked for a beef burrito. I got it to go and I didn't even know it came with the chips and salsa, which was a pretty good deal I guess, for something that's less than $5. I got home to eat it and the burrito was okay. It was pretty big but it was rather bland. The beef was very well cooked though. The chips were okay and the salsa was interesting. Everything in the salsa was extremely fine, nothing like your regular salsa with chunks of tomatoes or whatever else. It's very watery and the flavor wasn't really my thing. It was pretty sour and wasn't spicy at all. I'll probably try the tacos the next time.

Kinda surprised to see the low reviews for this place.  It's one of my favorite places for Mexican. The only reason to come here is for the tacos.  I've tried most everything else on the menu, and they are all average at best.   The tacos are the main attraction.  And you do have to come here with a few understandings.  These are hard shell tacos.  I believe they deep fry the meat and shell together, so you are getting a oily/heavy taco.  Its a nice alternative to the traditional soft shell taco, and easily 10 times better than the hard shell tacos at Jack in the Box or Taco Bell.  The salsa is pretty watery, but it goes great on the taco or with the chips.

Decent tacos here.  If your in the mood for a good taco try this place.  I left this place PISSED OFF like no other however.  I ordered a few tacos and a drink.  I finished the drink before I took a bite into a taco and they offer no refills.  Tito wants you to pay for another drink entirely at full price.  If I am going to pay for your over priced taco's Mr. Tito, I want something to wash them down with for the entire meal duration.  I am sorry I flipped you off through the windows when I left.  Sometimes the small things in life really get to you.   Advice- Bring your own 2-liter of your personal favorite refreshing beverage or do take out.  Unless of course you enjoy spending over 10.00 on drinks alone for empty cups.  It's the only way I'm going back which I will. "The only thing better than tito's tacos is a beverage to go with them."

I've been here a few times and at the office we have an annul Tito's party. The prices are decent. The food is overall good. The sauce they use for the enchiladas is AWESOME. If it wasn't for that sauce, I'd give them 3 stars. Make sure you bring cash and have the time to wait in the always long lines. The service is always prompt once you do get to the front of the line though.

I had super high expectations coming to Tito's Tacos. They were not met. The meat was probably the only good thing about their tacos. Other than that, I couldn't get over the rock hard tortillas and chips. And despite my friend who probably could've taken a jug of that salsa home, I was not a fan. It was missing a special something. Lime? Cilantro? Who knows. I won't be going back......

The food is not as good as the late night commercial! Been coming here since I was a wee lad and it used to be way better, but  I still crave it and it is still delicioso. I always get a taco with cheese and an all meat burrtito with cheese and a large root beer and I believe it is a nice combination to satisfy an old but still immature lad.

The food at Tito's is above average (but, not too far above)--but, that's not the reason there's always a line.   Tito's is a right of passage.  All tourists visiting Culver need to go here. Don't be afraid of the long lines--they usually move quickly and you can be out in about 5 minutes.  Make sure to bring cash as they don't take anything else.   At $2 or so, the Tostada (basically an open face bean taco with lots of lettuce and cheese) is about the best deal.  You also get a side of salsa and chips with that. Unfortunately they close sort of early--either 10 or 11 PM, and so you can't really use this spot as a drunk 3 AM spot.

When you absolutely positively don't care about your heart, and just want some sloppy, crunchy, cheesy taco goodness, come on down.  The "meat" and beans burrito's are pretty special as well.  What kind of meat?  who know's.  The menu just says "meat."  Who cares?!  Salsa is the one thing that could be much much bettter, but that's my only complaint about Tito's.

This is as good as it gets it you're a local and relish LA landmarks and historical value. I remember living on the east coast and meeting fellow LAers who spoke and dreamed about Tito's tacos. I've been eating here since 1989 when I started drivers ed down the street on weekends and we would walk over to Titos and it was a love affair ever since. I goto Tito's every Sunday and take everyone I know here whether they like it or not. Tito's is not a restaurant or some taco stand.......it's L.A.

I wrote this review on Yahoo back in April, i'm just re-posting it on here now with some additional thoughts:    To pass off the abominations they sell as "tacos" is an insult to tacos and Mexican food. You call those crushed tomatoes in a cup "salsa"? Really????    The food there is bland, bland, bland!!! Bring your own salt packets if your friends con you into thinking that this is a good place to eat. Better yet, save the 2.39 (for one taco!!!!!) and get yourself two Taco Bell tacos from down the street, that food sucks too but at least it is seasoned. The one and only time I went they charged extra for cheese on the taco, LAME!!  I also love the scam of not accepting debit cards but conveniently have an ATM right there to gouge you with a 2.50 fee to get cash, nice!!!! It is obvious that this place knows there's plenty of "sheeple" that will pay whatever price for their over-rated tacos and they take full advantage of that.   Save your cash for some better food next door at Cinco de Mayo. Their tacos have something Tito's has yet to master called "flavor" AND they accept debit cards/credit cards and don't charge extra for cheese on your taco.

This place sucks!!!! Had it the first time, thinking they were true Mexican tacos and was extremely disappointed. I heard from a few people how much they loved it and that you're suppose to go there when you're really hungry. So yes, I gave it another chance and brought a friend with me. I warned her that it is not the typical Mexican tacos we normally get (I'm talking about taco truck tacos from the hood tacos) and to just not expect much from them. Second time around...still sucked. The meat was so dry, I had to soak it with the watery bland salsa that came with it on the side. My friend said she rather have gone to Taco Bell. Don't let the crowd fool you.

Heard a lot about this place and seen the lines driving by, so I was curious to try it.  One day, I went with my brother-in-law and we got some tacos and some taquitos.  They were good....if you like Taco Bell kind of tacos but it wasn't something I would ever be in the mood for.  My brother in law said he liked them a lot but I don't think he ever went back there after that.  In no way am I saying the food is horrible, it's just not my type of mexican food.  Obviously a lot of people like them though.  Just drive by during lunch and you'll see 5 long lines.

Ok, they must come in early and often and put cooked steer beef into semi cooked corn tortillas and freeze them. They have so much volume I assume they have to. The flavor is good if you crave Tito's. It hasn't been crowded at dinnertime lately. Easy to stop recently. The all Meat With Cheese Burritos Are Great. I like to scoop out the filling with some of their chips. Lately a cheese enchilada and one taco have been satisfying my crave. (under $4) People swear by this place. It's fairly close to me and I like it that way. PS People I Know Love Tito's  Salsa. It's Made Fresh Daily Like The Chips.

I came here while on stay in Culver City as it was a block from the hotel I was staying at. I saw the lines and thought, "This place HAS to be good." Well, not so much. It's not that it's bad, just very underwhelming. I went inside to order and found the ordering process to be very confusing. There was no "order" line and "pick-up" line. You just order your food and hang around while the person that took your order makes it for you. Interesting. I ordered two tacos with cheese (I would figure cheese would be standard on a taco) and a side of guacamole. The cashier wandered off for a bit  and took my money with her. She came back about 5 minutes later with a box and some change. I decided to take the food back to the hotel since the place was so crowded. The tacos were OK. They put a fairly generous amount of cheese on although I wish it was the white shredded cheese often found at taquerias. The meat was stringy and slightly gamey which took some getting used to. I finished both tacos without an issue, though. I tried the chips with guacamole and found it to be mediocre. Bland, not-spicy-at-all guacamole. I tried the salsa and almost gagged. Something about it tasted fake, synthetic. I finished the chips with the guac and was left fairly satiated. I really don't understand the fan fare about Tito's. It must be one of those "you either get it or you don't" type place. Seems like it is popular with the locals. Can't say I'm ever going to come here again, but maybe if I was drunk.

Overrated place. I have tried the tacos and burritos here. Nothing to rave about, in fact, frozen burritos from the grocery store to me actually tastes better. The burritos here are loaded with just meat and/or beans, and they are very salty and without much flavor. To this day, I do not know why people line up for this place. Cinco de mayo, which is right down the street, is way better, in my opinion. The only plus here when I visited was the salsa. Great flavor.

I don't live in LA anymore, but every time I come home, Tito's is a MUST. I've been eating Tito's for over 20 years, since I moved on from bottles and babyfood. Aside from the long lines no matter when you go, the lack of available parking, and the fact that they only accept cash, Tito's is always a great idea. Their tacos are unique, i've never had tacos like these anywhere and they are soooo tasty, esp with their amazing salsa which is also different from any other salsa. Actually, everything about Tito's is unique. The chili con carne- mmm,mmm,mmm! The bean and cheese burritos are stuffed to the brim and are delicious too! People are complaining about the menu, but come on- this is a taco stand! and it's super cheap at that! I can eat Tito's for breakfast, lunch, dinner or even the next day, albeit the tacos don't hold up that well in fridge. Oh, and it's the perfect drunk food. Selling Dos Equis is probably the only thing that would make me more excited about Tito's. My mouth was watering just writing this review!

I am sure by now anyone that lives in the Southland has seen the commercial with Tito, made by powerpoint in like 1995 that they still use today, with that catchy jingle, I love Tito's tacos, and you'll love Titos too, etc. Well this definitely is not the place to go if you are looking for an authentic Mexican restaurant but they are good tacos, especially if you like hard shell.  They are a little pricey since they are just regular tacos, but the shredded beef is pretty good, tender and moist and they have a pretty decent salsa as well. I would recommend getting a side of guacamole, and they also have a good tostada and an ok tamale but it's no Lilliana's.  But if you are in Culver City, don't feel like a pastrami dip, feel like waiting in line for several minutes and have cash on you, this is the place to go.

OVERRATED! I don't get why this place is popular... the lines were long and that normally proves that this place has good food but it wasn't at all. The wait for food was long along with the line to order the food. We ordered the tacos, burrito and the tamales and none of them were good, I don't get what's so special about them. The tacos were stale- shredded beef was dry, there's lots of cheese and the salsa was okay. The burrito was flavorless, i had to put a lot of salsa on it so it'll taste edible. The tamales were mediocre.  The place gets packed and finding a place to sit down and eat can be a challenge, there are some big table were you have to share with other people eating. Parking is a pain too, unless you get lucky with street parking. As me and my hubby ate, i was looking around and wondered what people like about this joint... I still don't get why this place is popular. We didn't even finish our food. We felt like we wasted out time and money here. Well, it was an experience but we'll never coming back here again. Not even recommending this place to anyone so yep...Yelpers-- you're not missing out on anything...Better find another place to eat.

When I was a kid my Dad worked in CC and used to bring Tito's home every week or two and it was our favorite! It's still just as good. I literally tell everyone that visits CA to eat here. Best tacos I've ever had, anywhere.

I like Tito's Tacos. I am saying this after trying it a second time. The first time I had it, I think my expectations were too high, and I was distracted by the never ending crowd. The tacos were not what I expected, and I thought the shell was hard. I had a bean and cheese burrito, and took some of it home. It was good, but I think it was too much with the tacos. The second time I tried it I skipped the bean burrito. I ordered 2 tacos (one with cheese and one without). I think  there is enough cheese on one taco to add to the other one. :P I also got a side of guacamole and beans. I wanted the beans to use as a dip for the chips they give you. Their salsa is very mild and watery, but tastes so good! Sometimes I want something that doesn't burn my mouth off, and it goes so good with the tacos! I added guac and salsa to my tacos and they were bomb! I enjoyed every bite! The guac isn't the best, but for some reason it tasted good on the tacos.:) The beans were really tasty and went well with the chips, but I think next time I go I will get the tacos and enjoy each crunchy and chewy bite with that mouth watering salsa! They are not the highest quality tacos I ever had, but good for what they are. One thing my husband ordered that he regretted was the all beef burrito. I tasted it, and must admit it was horrible. The red sauce had a sour taste, and there seemed to be more sauce than meat! Would never order that again. He agreed that his taco was much better! On a next visit (when I don't get tacos) I will try a bean, rice, and cheese burrito:) Some people like Tito's and some want to run from it, but everyone can probably agree that it's one of a kind!!! ;))

I have friends who are obsessed with this place (who will bring these tacos with them all the way back up to the bay area), but I'm not the hugest fan... Although the shredded beef in their tacos is quite tasty and their salsa is delicious, the line is usually long and not worth the wait IMO! Also, they charge extra for cheese and for extra salsa!

Titos is a classic grease factory with long lines. The tacos are pretty good especially when hot out of the fryer. We sometimes skip the cheese and grate some at home. The all meat burritos are hot and distinctly tasty. The enchilada is good too with flavorful brown sauce. The refried beans are a good side but the rice is dry and not worth it. Ask for chips and salsa for the # of people you have (ie 4) and they will give you a better portion. The free salsa is fresh and uniques, but not spicey. The lines are always long and parking in the lot is a hassel. The commercial is evil and subliminal putting Titos in the back of your mind perpetually.

I absolutely love this place, I crave the tacos and guacamole like nothing else and I will wait forever in a long, disorganized line for an hour or whatever it's totally worth it. I will purchase more tacos than I could ever dream of eating in a day because I know I want to eat leftovers, tastes just as good the next day too!

There are so many people lined up outside of here any time I drive by it. The tacos are good, they don't taste Mexican and if you like spices this is not the place for you. Bottom line, try it because it is an LA staple. It isn't bad by any means but there are better tacos out there.

Atmosphere- so my roommates and I just moved to LA and every time we have driven by this place its has been packed, so naturally we wanted to try it despite its poor yelp ratings and let me say that I will never doubt yelp again. So I cant really comment more on the atmosphere because my roommates brought it home. They did say however that they were stuck in the huge line FOREVER. Food- umm, lets just say it feels like its trying to be In N Out burger with its "we only serve shredded beef" and you gotta eat it this way only. Problem is its no wear near as good and really the only thing I liked about the place was its salsa. I had some tacos, a bean and cheese burrito (no redeemable qualities) and the chips & salsa. Sadly the only thing I enjoyed was the salsa. I saved some of it to buy different chips to eat it with. Value- Sorry Tito's Tacos but its a no go for me. If it was dirt cheap I could see it being one of those ... wait I still wouldnt go there.

My hubby and his family LOVE Tito's.  Personally, I don't get it.  I think it's kinda gross and I feel unhealthy after I eat it.  Like, I might have a heart attack any minute after taking a bite of their food.  My brother-in-law claims that if you're from LA and grow up on Tito's, you love it.  I guess you could call it LA comfort food.  To me, it couldn't be more uncomfortable.

Tito's is an experience. I moved here from the Midwest with "taco burgers" being the only Mexican food I had experienced. My husband-to-be's family lived in Culver City, so Tito's was a tradition. The tacos are large, crunchy and delicious (but need salsa or guac) ... Their burritos are amazingly stuffed full of the best shredded meat I have ever tasted. That said, as we started our family, we continued the Tito's tradition and our grown daughters, now scattered across Southern California, all make special trips for Tito's even though we have no family in Culver City any longer.

Yuck! This place sucks.  The day I went there were dozens of UCLA students.  Is there some sort of UCLA discount or maybe they just don't have taste buds? I've eaten plenty of good tacos and Tito's is not the place for one.  The price is too expensive for the nastiness you receive.  Maybe for a $1.25 each I would have put up with it.  But to have to wait in line for those tacos just wasn't worth it.  In my book, Tito's is as overrated as Pink's Hotdogs.

This shit is fucking junk. The salsa is watered-down, blended in a blender for far too long, light pink in color, and doesn't taste like anything. In fact, it doesn't even taste like tomatoes. You must ask for cheese on anything you order. That is extra. The line isn't as long as it looks. There are five people working the windows outside and five people working windows inside. Each line is about three deep. So in reality, no one is waiting in line. This jank place is just designed this way to give you the illusion that this place *might* be as good as Pinks. Pinks also sucks, by the way. But less than Tito's. The tables inside are always dirty and full of screaming kids running around underfoot. What else is under your feet? Splatters of that runny-snot salsa. Tito, I will give you an extra star for thick, crunchy shells and braised beef. And relatively inexpensive prices. For these prices, what I get is exactly what I deserve.

"hate it or love titos tacos is on top and they gone shine until the lines stop give me 3,  ya'll know titos is the MVP" that was taken from the game's latest album called to live and die in LA:  what real gangstas eat. honestly people love to hate on this joint but its a big time LA taco spot.  people love it, i love it, and if you like deep fried tacos filled with shredded beef  then topped with a handful cheddar cheese then you'll love it too. if you havent been here it worth a trip, and if you dont like it you will at least know where you stand. i use to live around the block and this is where i went to grab a hard shell taco.  now if youre looking for real mexican food or are craving some street tacos then head down to don jorge's on venice because its the the bomb dot com!   as far as titos is concerned stick with the tacos and make sure you add the cheese.  its a 35 cent upcharge but its worth it.  the salsa is a bit different from the norm but it seems to work.  its best if you order extra because you'll be drinking it by the end of your meal.  their chili con carne is pretty good too and if you want a little something extra then thats your best bet.  otherwise 2 to 3 tacos will do the job depending on hunger level and appetite, but i have been known to put away 5 or 6 on a good day.

This is one of those sort of "in the know" kind of places. Most people in LA have either driven past it or heard of it but few are willing to actually get it line and wait for their tacos from the shack. But it's a place you should definitely try because the tacos are greasy and delish and the chicken/steak are shredded in a way that you don't usually get at other fast food or even sit down mexican restaurants.

I walk here and pick up an order of two tacos on a semi-regular basis, but the fact of the matter is I don't know why.  The tacos aren't that great, the salsa feels like it was made in a smoothie blender, and the chips are made from the same stuff as the taco shells, only stale. But the fact remains, I keep coming back.  Is it the remarkably cheap price?  Is it the fact it's not a chain run by The Man?  Is it the location, so very close to me?  Do they put crack in their meat?  I have no idea.  It's alright, but I do not understand why it's such an LA staple.  It's edible, I've never gotten sick from it, but if that's the best thing you can say about a place... how spectacular can it be? Maybe I like it because it's reliable.  The folks at Baja Fresh make my burrito different every time I go.  Tito's?  Tito's you can count on to taste exactly the same, good enough to keep you coming back, every time.

Tito's is an institution. Everyone has been there, wants to go or knows someone who has been. I've been a good 20 times myself.  If you're one of the few who hasn't yet been, let me help you out. It's called Tito's Tacos for good reason. That's all you need to order. The burritos are average at best. Their salsa is watery and not one bit spicy. Beans and rice, good but nothing mind blowing. So, stick with the tacos. With cheese. That glorious neon orange cheddar. Greasy but so delicious. We learned early and have only ordered tacos with cheese for years now. And we still keep going back.

my roommate and i are staying away from meat this week for a religious holiday. so when we drove past titos after a fun tango class, starved and craving something filling, i remembered that someone mentioned they made some pretty decent veggie tostadas. two stars for fresh lettuce, soft and plentiful cheddar cheese, a tostada shell that didn't get soggy and LOTS of salsa. however, the salsa was REALLY mild and just didn't do it for me. at the end of the meal, i feel like i ate a bowl of lettuce w/ some beans & cheese. meh. i guess it did the trick, but still. for $2.10 a tostada, i guess i expected more. much more. for $2.10, i can go to King Taco and get a bomb ass carne asada taco. meanwhile, Titos doesn't even SERVE carne asada?? wth?

Long line, totally over rated.  It's not worth it....not even in the slightest.  The food has almost no taste and you can expect to wait 30+ minutes to even order.  There are so many ways they could speed up the process, but I suspect they don't want to so that the line makes them look good.  In any case, if you want to wait a long time for crappy food, then pretend I gave this place 5 stars...if you're a normal person, go somewhere else.

Sorry folks, not a fan.  This is coming from someone who can appreciate street food but this is in a whole different category.  I would classify this place as an art project that is an exposé of the grotesque.  Having been attracted by the infinity line with no end or beginning wrapping under around and inside out of the freeway overpass I had to try it out.  I am surprised the car made it home as the weight of the food alone seemed to defy physics.  The density had exceeded the allowable mass but fortunately for the sake of experience we managed to lug it upstairs then curiously unwrap layers of foil to reveal the mysterious matter that occupied the now sweaty brown box into which the food matter had been stored.  Each bite warned that toxicity levels were being challenged.  However a strange curiosity kept me trying to understand and enjoy this phenomenon until finally I just threw in the towel.  Titos tacos - sustenance fit for the toxic avenger is more suited as waste sludge that slurps from urban sewers of a post apocalyptic nightmare imaginable only in low budget demented futuristic B slasher movies...

I've never seen this place WITHOUT a line going out the door....for what, I'm not so sure. I tried the classic taco and a bean & cheese burrito (the menu isn't very extensive, which is fine) and it was all pretty average. Lots of shredded neon orange cheese, flavor-less iceberg lettuce and shredded beef are all that a taco includes, but the extra side of watery salsa made it slightly more flavorful. It's cheap and tastes good, but I would imagine that the thousand other Mexican joints around it-and around the rest of LA-serve up the same (or better) corn tortillas with meat, beans and cheese. Nice try though, Tito.

I went here on a recommendation that these were the best tacos in town, plus it is a LA staple.  After much hype from my friend and a Trader Joe's checker (why we asked them, I'm not sure), I was extremely disappointed and felt robbed.  I ordered  a couple of tacos, some chips and salsa and guac.  The guac is like a liquidated version of avocados with all the taste extracted.  The tacos very average for the line you wait in.  I would have rather had a taco from Taco Bell!  Save your time and pick up some tacos from a street vendor!

I've been coming here every since I could remember. These hard shell tacos are in my opinion the best hard shells tacos in the world ! Just by thinking about them makes my mouth water. They have a unique taste to them which makes them one of a kind. The meat is just so trend and juice and packed with flavor, and the sauce is so good I drink it like its water. I don't come here often maybe like 5 times a year but when I do you bet I pig out like there is no tomorrow. I order around 4 tacos and a large salsa which I use pour onto my tacos. One thing I don't like though is that its always packed but you can be rest assured that it is worth the wait, and also every table is full. It might alway be packed, but they serve you your food fairly quickly and well done to. Not only do they sell the most amazing hard shell tacos but they also have burritos, tamales, enchiladas, & tostadas. The burritos and packed with juicy, tender meat and a savory sauce you could also add rice and bean in it if you'd like. The tacos and burrito are my favorite when I come down here. I usually share half of my burrito with my brother or dad because they're so big I can't finish my tacos and burrito all by myself so I tend to give my other half. I would recommend anyone to Tito's Taco if you haven't already gone and tasted for yourself how delicious their food is, but don't take my word for it go down to Tito's Tacos and see for yourself how delicious their food is and come back to thank me later.

Puke, this place is worse than McDonald's, and it's at a lower level too. The meat quality is really bad. It's like they blended all the nasty cow parts and maybe some dung, too.

Eh whats the big deal?  If you're looking to save money go to Taco Bell.  If you're looking for tasty tacos go find a taco truck, King Taco or something else.  The lines are long, parking is tough, the food is average at best, the selection of meat is non existent and the salsa is not good.  I don't get all the hoopla and fanfare.  Seriously if somebody can explain the allure of this place I'm all ears.  Tito's Tacos is the Paris Hilton of mexican food - all flash and no substance.  PASS.

Simple taco but DELICIOUS!  The combination of shredded beef, fresh lettuce, and shredded cheese in a non-greasy taco shell....AWESOME GOODNESS!  Their salsa is also to die for, it has the right kick, not too spicy!

Crunchy tacos that aren't very spicy. It's ok, but I find it hard to belive that these are the best tacos in LA...from what the hype says anyway. My friend called them "white boy tacos." They are kind of like an authentic Taco Bell or Jack in the Box style taco. You can't beat the price and I'll eat them again but there are better tacos elsewhere.

IMO, they have the best tacos! This is definately not the place for Vegetarians, with the exception of the bean burrito. Their tacos have shredded beef and about the size of Jack-in-the Box's tacos but packed with more meat and not as greasy as Jack's. Two tacos usually fill me up. When you order tacos they'll give you a handful of baked tortilla chips with salsa. If you happen to be in the Culver City area and you see a bunch of people outside, you'll know its Titos. Right in the cornder of Sepulveda and Washington Place. There are always long lines but they go really fast. Good food and speedy service.

Me and my bro were super hungry while driving back from work on the 405 and he remembered tito's tacos!  All the way there, he kept raving and raving about their fried taco shell.  Well, we finally got there and there were 4 lines with only about 5 people waiting in each line.  Not bad, we waited for like 5-10 minutes and ordered.  50 cents for cheese on EACH item is a little steep in my opinion.  The cheese isn't even that good.  We ordered some tacos and an enchilada.  The enchilada had one piece of meat chunk in it about the size of a square ice cube and the rest was thick corn tortilla dunked in red sauce.  The sauce was good, but the whole dish was just o--k.  I would of liked more meat in my enchilada.   The taco's meat was kinda gross.  It was dry shredded beef.  usually, you know... beef is brown or red when its raw right?  Well the beef in their tacos are off white.  hmm how the heck do their shredded beef turn cream colored?   I will say that their salsa is REALLY good.  I wanted to drink the whole dang cup.  We asked for more and they happily obliged. =) Another good thing is that they have strawberry soda! Now that's hard to come by! Its so good! My favorite tacos with a hard shell are hands down, still.. Taco Lita in Arcadia! Don't forget the special sauce!

I don't care what some of you haters think about Tito's. I grew up eating this "horse meat", as we used to call it in middle school-And I LOVE IT! I mean, I crave it. I find myself stuck in traffic on the 405 twitching to exit on Venice and get me some greasy, florescent cheese goodness! I have even aggressively switched lanes just to feast upon some crunchy, Taconess. I have decided that people who don't like Tito's eat at Taco Bell. THAT IS NOT MEXICAN Food. If you don't like Tito's, you are not a man and your reviews are not to be trusted. THE END.

These Tito's tacos is worth the drive. First of all, seeing this street corner joint was an accident. We missed our exit so we needed to take a different route. While looking around, there were a lot of people lining up, wondering what was the hype about, and took a quick glance and saw the Tito's Tacos sign. I heard about this Mexican joint from my bff. I was a little disappointed that they didn't have fish tacos, but other than that, Tito's tacos made up for it! Take the drive, you won't be disappointed.

Absolutely NO STARS!!!! Sadly to say my friend and I were very dissappointed in the food...we saw that there were tons of people at Tito's Tacos and thought hmmm... maybe this place is poppin. so we check it out and ask a local what we should order and he said the burritos and tacos were the best.  the price was decent but the food tasted nasty...im not sure why there was a crowd outside just for the food here.  the meat was too mushy and poo looking and the taste was similar to leftover stew that was sitting in the frige for a few weeks (trust me that doesn't taste good)! So dont be fooled by the crowd when you pass by Titos Tacos, because its surely not authentic.

So basically, from the gist of the poor reviews I've read here, people thought that the food was disgusting and/or its not authentic Mexican. No offense to those who gave poor reviews, but the massive lines pretty much speak for themselves. You are in the minority. If you have a refined palette, then why the hell are you expecting 4-star quality dining at a cash-only fast-food taco stand?! Of course its not authentic Mexican. It never claims to be! I simply recommend that everyone try a taco of theirs at least once, without expecting the sun to explode and Jesus to arrive once you bite into it (as apparently some Yelpers have done). In conclusion: long lines speak volumes more about a restaurant than the whole Yelp community put together. P.S. -.5 stars for pain-in-the-ass parking, -.5 stars for making burritos smaller than they were before.

I have been going to Tito's for forever! The tacos, and bean cheese burritos are seriously my favorite in all of LA. Oh and the meat, bean, cheese and rice burrito is awesome it's just HUGE! The tamales, etc. are okay not all that but the tacos make up for it! And the salsa is fantastic, guac is good but not chunky at all kinda soupy. If you like spicy make sure you ask for the jalapeno salsa, OMG SO GOOD! The chips are great too! Try the inside line it's much faster!

Everyone on the Westside always talks about Titos Tacos.  Titos Tacos always has long lines that stretch out the door.  This place must be spectacular, right? Wrong.  Tito's is ordinary at best.  Cheap, filling, greasy, but definitely ordinary.  I ordered one shredded beef taco (sorry, hard shell only--albeit a homemade shell far better than the mass produced junk at taco bell) and one bean and cheese burrito.  The taco was bland, slightly dry, and needed an extra dose of the not-so-hot salsa to try to give it more flavor and moisture.  Next, I tried my bean and cheese burrito.  This was better than the taco, and was filled with a gooey, savory combination of cheese and refried beans.  Cheap, yes.  Filling, yes.  Worth the wait and the difficult parking? Probably not.

Meh. I was overpromised and underdelivered! The taco was just a taco, and the chicken tamale was actually kind of gross. The 'Guacamole' was more of a sauce than a dip, but tasted good enough to keep the rest of the meal edible. I'd honestly prefer El Pollo Loco or even Taco Bell (and not because they don't have the lengthy line or cash-only policy like Tito's..)

I was waiting in line at Tito's the other day, and I started thinking to myself "what is so great about this place, and why are so many people waiting in line for this?  The tacos are decent, the tamales are ok, the chips are typically overcooked, the salsa is watery, and the rice is disgusting."  I know a lot of people that rave about this place, but I can't think of a single thing that they have here that is worth raving about.  Most of the food is ok, but it is definitely not worth driving a long distance for.  The only time I ever find myself eating at Tito's is when I am in the area.  There are TONS of great Mexican restaurants in LA that are way better than Tito's.  Overall, I can't say that Tito's is the worst food I have ever had, but I will say that I think it is the most overrated restaurant in all of LA.

I'm at a loss as to why people drive across town, fight for parking and wait in line for tacos and burritos from here.  It's edible, but it's just not there.  Been to plenty of other places that have had better food, including many taco trucks.  And there's plenty of other places to eat around there, both Mex and non-Mex.  People are in a frenzy.  Poor people.

This place is like New Kids On the Block in the 80s, way, way, way to much hype! First off the the taco meat looks and smells similar to Fancy Feast and their salsa looks like one of its main ingredients is saliva.

Let me start by saying I have been going here since I was a child. I cannot remember a trip to Culver City or the Westside without stopping at Tito's. Quite surprise that it has such few stars. Yes the line is always long, but its because its that GOOD. Don't compare it with authentic mexican food, like a friend put it: "its not Mexican, its not American, its Tito's". Not the place for vegetarians but for the rest of us, its so damn good. I've had everything on the menu, my favorites being the tacos, enchiladas and the rice. Make sure you ask for your rice with meat sauce, its not on the menu but it makes the rice so much tastier.

Yay!  I finally got to eat here.  I mean really, who has the energy to drive to culver city in traffic and then washington blvd, in traffic, to not be able to park and then stand in line for an hour?? But if you get past all that, you have delicious tacos awaiting their fate in my tummy. I couldn't stop ordering.  "4 tacos?!" he accused.  "did you order for me too?" No! Don't touch my crispy cheesy tacos!  And I ordered chips, salsa and guacamole.  I wanted to try their enchilada and burrito but enough was enough.  Don't worry I saved some of the tacos for later. It's just that I have been yelping the best tacos in L.A. for quite some time and they all come up soft corn tortillas.  Even as a Mexican, I hate that.  I want crunchy tacos.  And their salsa is pure flippin heaven. I'm not gonna lie, going back may be iffy, the parking is a nightmare.  I cried several times.  But if you are on your way back from LAX you must stop.  And standing in line ain't no bag of roses either, so make a culver city day of it, just not at night.  That shit's scary at night.

(the 1st time someone provided)  So..when we pull up to the spot.. I see this humongous line out front.. so I'm  thinking to myself "this place must be REAL good eh".  So we wait in line for about 30 minutes checking out the menu.. and I'm like "why is it taking so long.. there's only 5 items on the menu".. it was INSANE.  So we finally make it to the front and we order a couple of tacos and what the hell.. a meat burrito also..  So we take the goods back to the car and begin to chow down.  The tacos tasted like Taco Bell tacos and the Meat Burrito was GARBAGE. PURE GARBAGE.  Never again Tito's Tacos!!

Not really sure why everyone's got such a hard-on for this place. Guess you have to chalk that line up to herd mentality... seems like because there's such a long line everyone has convinced themselves the place is great. After you've waited 45 minutes for some C+ tacos you'd rather keep pretending that the Emperor is wearing a great robe than to admit the only thing good about them is the cheese. Which is really great, actually.

Only problem I have with Tito's: the tacos are bad.  They are just bad!  The shells have the taste and texture of some out-of-the box supermarket shells.  The meat is unremarkable.  This place is way, way overrated.  If you want a good taco, go to somewhere like Campos.  If you want to pay for hype, go to Tito's.  Yes, it's cheap.  Here, you get what you pay for.

all i'm going to say is that if you don't like it, it's because you don't know how to eat it. stick to the tacos with cheese and always always always upgrade your salsa to the next level (if it comes with a small size, get the medium.  if it comes with the medium, get the large.  if it comes with the large, get 2.  etc)   every single bite needs to be completely covered in that salsa.  it's what makes that taco...that taco.  trust me.  please.  tito's is freaking good.  don't hate it because it's popular to hate it.  please.  i beg of you.

This review is mainly for the CLEANLINESS and SERVICE of the establishment. Went to Tito's Tacos for the 1st time ever Today, 02-04-12. Went in the afternoon, around 2 pm. I read prevous reviews, so I expected a line and parking to be a nightmare, so I opted to park on the street and walk. FInally made it up to the front of the line and wasn't greeted for 10 min. The employees just all walked around and wouldnt even say hi or welcome me. Finally I was able to take my order, the lady just pulled out an order pad, no smile and wrote down my order dryly and left, without saying what I should do next, ( wait here, she'll return shortly or step out of line to the side so another customer may order etc ) the line was increasing in length, so I didnt want to just lose my spot so I waited at the front , only to be asked by another girl for my order and when I told her I had already ordered, she rolled her eyes and yelled "next" to the person behind me. I'm sorry, but I didn't know a PAYING customer was such an annoyance! The lady who took my order returned wiht my order in a brown box and I was told the total I owed, and I didn't receive a receipt, which I don't like, I prefer to be able to actually SEE what i'm being charged. The lady took my money and left again, saying nothing, so I assumed she went to get my change, another customer's order was brought up and she paid and awaited her change as well. While the two of us were awaiting our change, and keep in mind our food was literally blocking the counter top completely, another employee approaches and yells "next" for another customer to apporach and place an order. They didn't even care that they hadn't completed the transaction with the two custeromers currently standing in front of them; i'm assuming they do this to make people leave and forget their change so they can have a "Tip". That's pretty shaddy behavior for a so-call Professional place of business. The CLEANLINESS WAS AWFUL.  Yes, ALL of the employees wear gloves, BUT, THEY TOUCH MONEY,THEMSELVES, EACHOTHER ( patting eachother on the back), THEIR ORDER PADS AND THE SODA DISPENSER! How is that suppossed to protect the food and the customer? you're touching dirty surfaces and the food??!!! How do they have an "A" rating! Now to the food, the food wasn't that great, not terrible, but not that great, typical LA, where if somehting is over crowded, people assume its good and worth the money, the wait and the poor customer service. I will not be returning!

I've been coming to this shack since I was a little kid and it's still one of my faves. Granted, the tacos are greasy and probably horribly unhealthy, but the crispy shells and yummy shredded beef make me forget all about the heart clogging taking place internally. It's a cash only, ghetto to the max shack, but aren't those usually the best places? You can't beat the cheap prices - definitely check this place out if you want a quick Mexican fix! :)

I live in Hawaii but grew up in the LA area. Every time I fly in to visit family I always stop at Titos. I am shocked to see the ratings in the 3 star mark. This place has only a few things on the menu and they do each one perfectly. There is always a line and plenty people who feel the same way I do. Chili con carne is a winner! Off ourselves tacos are also wonderful. There is a little park a block down the road. We get a few beers, a box of Titos and chill at the park and enjoy a great meal after a long flight.

I go to Tito's Tacos when I'm in the mood for a snack that can be grabbed while I'm passing through the area.  I wouldn't go there during the lunch rush, but if it's off-hours and there's no crazy line, you'll be fine.  Sometimes you just need a taco that isn't fancy or from a chain, but just is exactly how you expect it to be.  It feels like some 70's throwback to how taco stands used to be when they catered to hesitant Anglo eaters.  Fried shells, tame salsa, and day-glo cheddar cheese (if you want it) make this place a safe bet for your Brady Bunch.  It doesn't look like much, but it satisfies the taste buds in a consistent way, and they do give you lots of chips to go with your food.  As long as you go in without someone over-hyping it as some sort of incredible discovery, you'll be fine....

Miss V said I had to go here, so off we went! Crazy long line of people outside, which is usually a good sign. Just a basic taco place where you get the impression every one working there is related somehow. Got some tacos and a bunch of salsa and sat down to chow down. Super tasty tacos! The bonus was the huge amount of cheese on them and the really yummy and fresh salsa. It's not spicy but it's still just incredibly good and flavorful, nearly drank that stuff. Oh! and they give you the really good crushed ice when you get a soda, extra star for that.

one star because I liked the salsa...kind of. I have heard people talk about these tacos for years so now that I moved to the area decided to taste these great tacos. But sad to say....awful. Its just a step up from taco bell! The ground beef is over seasoned....and that makes me wonder how old it must be. It was nothing at all special......Does anyone know where they have real great hard shell tacos?

I grew up eating tito's once a month since the 80's. I love the meat burrito. You can always count on a line outside if they are open, and a half dollar coin in your change.  Its a tasty treat, if you want a prime rib this isn't the spot for you. They make burritos, tacos, and tamales. They hit the spot. If you want an expensive highend Mexican meal, get back on the 405 and head to El Cholo in Santa Monica. Yummy!

If I could have 1 Los Angeles food wish granted it would be for these guys to open a few more locations, like in the mid-city, or the east-side, or the north-east side, or like ANYWHERE except for the twisted labrynth that is Culver City!  The way they run their operation is like a model for how a fast-food joint should be run, and their Mexican food is a dream come true for an individual like myself whom has never cooked a single thing in my entire life.  Big but handle-able without stuff pouring out all over your shirt and pants burritos, perfect tacos with ~WOW~ real visible meat AND cheese!!! not the 90% lettuce or whatever other money saving ingredient places stuff in americanized tacos.  Incredible prices, uniquely cool people which actually now that I think about it seems to be consistent when a place is serving up food that is the real-deal.

Boy was I WRONG!! It was the worst Mexican food I have ever had!!! EVER!!! even jack in the box is better...well barely! I was so repulsed by the tacos i thought well maybe there enchilladas are the way to go...equally as gross! sadly we bought a ton of it so we had leftovers...not even microwave could zap in taste!

Interesting tacos...... Yummy, but not anything traditional in the American or Mexican sense. And you better like HARD shells and I mean HARD shells, they could cut your gums. The thing is that they are worth the risk! A generous portion of chips and salsa come with your order. I can't recommend anything but the tacos, because everything else is lame. If you order anything but the tacos it would be like going to a steak house and ordering fish and expecting it to be the best fish ever, don't be stupid! Order the tacos.

The food was cheap here... but I guess it's because they use less ingredients because it was REALLY bland.  My friend's meat and bean burrito mainly consisted of beans... my enchilada was okay but I've definitely had better.  The tacos were quite upsetting.  I poured the salsa all over that one which kind of helped.

Maybe when a restaurant (or in this case, food shack) has chosen to include something it serves in its title, it means something.  I foolishly opted for a tamale instead, but seeing as how everything on the menu costs approximately one dollar, anyone willing to stand in line can easily have their fill of pretty much everything Tito's has to offer.   The burritos were essentially beef chunks in some type of red sauce, rolled in a tortilla. (Can a bitch get some lettuce? I'm pretty sure beef and/or sauce were the only topping options. though options typically implies optional, eh, can't win em all.)  They do have guacamole, a definition I'll use pretty loosely, as it was more like green puree which may or may not have contained avocados.   Still, as delicious as I've tried to make everything sound, somehow it all was! delicious! ...kind of. If your taste buds are as influenced by hells of cheap prices as mine are, you should enjoy it. Too bad in writing this review I've pretty much talked myself out of ever going back. Those beef chunks were not pretty.

One of the BEST places to grab some tacos.  This place is an LA staple.  Don't go expecting health food or texmex.  This is not that place.  It's a great taco stand.  Period.  I've been coming here since I was born and will probably die with a Tito's taco in my hand.  The lines are hit-or-miss.  Anyone who compares the lines to Pink's doesn't know what they are talking about.  The longest you'll wait is MAYBE ten minutes.  The majority of the time, it's less than five.  The food is fantastic and I'd be glad to wait hours for their tacos.  If you're a vegetarian, you're good too because Tito's has tostadas and cheese enchiladas.  I always bring people new to LA to Titos and they love it.  My out of town friends always want to get to Titos the second they land.  This place will have you hooked from the first bite.  Even their chips and salsa are hands down the best.

I tried Tito's Taco for the first time and I have to say that I am very disappointed. I've been wanting to try this place for the longest time since it got tons of good reviews online. Their famous hard shell taco is just a better version of Taco Bell's taco. It consist of a little shredded beef, lettuce and cheese. To me, rather than Mexican food, it taste a lot more like American fast food. The taco is way to greasy for my taste since it is deep fried. I could still taste the oil after 2 cups of tea after my meal. I have no idea what's with all the hypes. It is definitely not the best taco place in L.A. It is not horrible, I wouldn't mind eating it. However, I would not make special trips for it, nor waiting 45min in line for it.

This place is a classic. Sometimes I think the fact that it's so busy all the time that it automatically tastes better...The only time there is no line is like @ 9 in the morning. The prices are still reasonable even though they have been raised slightly over time. The guacamole (sauce) is tasty, but I personally am not a fan of the salsa. I usually get a bunch of tacos w/o lettuce and drench them with guac! The only downside are the chips...not the taste, but the sharpness of them. They are cut, fried tortillas and sometimes they cut the roof of your mouth! I guess a little blood doesn't hurt for a good meal tho. Take one of the team (that's the stomach talking). The burritos are tasty too. One trip to this place equals one trip to the bathroom soon!

Inspired by Hollywood nightclubs, Tito's perpetually has 50 people in line at any given time.  To be fair, the crunchy tacos and gooey burritos are tasty enough to keep people waiting.  Ignore the rest of the menu--the tamale and enchilada are made by Stouffer's.  A neighborhood monument worth visiting for cheap, reasonably-good mexican food.

Tito's is definitely an acquired taste, but you'll be glad you acquired it - it's such an easy and inexpensive urge to satisfy whether you live in LA or are just passing through.  We always get tacos w/cheese and all meat burritos, but we've come to savor the salsa as the most unique.  It's actually quite an art to make the chips and salsa (after spooning some on the tacos) come out evenly (we've even experimented with splitting up our order to see if we could get two large salsas for free), but you can always order more a la carte.  There's also the excitement of getting a server who will really load up on the meat (okay, I lead a quiet life) which is never skimpy like a Taco Bell for example.  Besides being tasty and not that greasy, for us it's become comfort food - consistent quality, flavor, and freshness.

My life partner John Olmeda from Culver City recommened this place when we were in undergrad 8 years ago.  God damn I'm old.  8 years later I ran into this while dining at Johnny's Pastrami across the parking lot.  Naturally my fatty ass ate a second dinner.  After eating a pastrami sandwich I went to stand in the massive line of titos.   My friends were disgusted watching me order 3 tacos.  I'm fat forgive me. The tacos were good but if I were a college student I would have probably enjoyed these more.  But as a fatty professional eater I have to say it was just ok.  I will come back if I can ever locate this place again.

Please don't get it twisted;  These are unlike any other sissy ass 3 inch round corn tortilla taco's from Mariella's or stale run to the border taco bell types. Theses taco shells are lovingly stuffed with shredded beef and deep friend in lard.  Once delicately plucked fromt he steaming vat, they are stuffed with lettuce and cheese, and further adorned with the most delicious salsa I've ever had the pleasure to taste.  You can watch this miraculous process from the glass window inside the joint while you pay.  Admittedly this is not gourmet, but it has to be the best greasy spoon taco I've ever had.  Despite the consistantly increasing price of the tacos & cheese (last I checked it was 1.50 for the taco and .35 for cheese) It's still worth it.  Just don't eat more than 3 (2 if you're on the small side) and you'll stay out of the woods on the whole indegestion thing.

I wish I'd realized that the only option was a crunchy shell -- in my rushed decision to go visit Tito's, I found myself deeply disappointed by the only available taco shell option. And then came the meat. With out any real guide as to what kind of meat they had, I was left under the impression that all was available was not carne asada or even chicken, but something generically titled "beef". That ended up being somewhat gooey and heavy -- not what I expected and definitely not something that impressed me. I have no idea what all the hype is about.

I ordered 2 tacos ....paid 2.90 I can understand the mixed reviews. Reasons for my rating - i like the free chips and salsa, but two people ordered one taco each. Why didn't  we both get chips? we should have paid separately. Chips are a little thicker than i prefer, but weren't bad. - taco shells are really THICK and hard (not STALE, but with the shell being thick, it overpowers the rest of the taco....go with a thinner shell and you are good to go. - flavor is overpowered by that damn shell. the meat is okay (kind of taste like taquito's from costco) - if a taco is 1.45 and cheese is 40 cents, why would i get it? The cheese is too expensive. Make the taco 155 and cheese 30 cents or something. - If i can get 2 taco's for 99 cents at Jack-in-the-Box, That's a  better value. 2 taco's will still fill me up more than 1 taco @ 1.45 Although, i'm a fan of supporting small/local places, i feel stuck between being cheap and getting food that tastes good. I almost went to don antonio's while in LA, but their pricing is funky too. Don Antonio's menu. A La Carte - ONE (1) CRISPY taco.............. 2.75 Combination - TWO (2) CRISPY taco's.....10.50 (combo gets rice and beans in a combination WHOO HOO) ( note sarcasm) Combination - TWO (2) SOFT taco's .........10.75 A La Carte - ONE (1)  SOFT taco.................  3.00 Let's break it down. for crispy taco's: two would cost  $5.50 .........why does rice & beans cost $5.00 ? for soft taco's: two would cost $6.00 ...why does rice & beans cost $5.25? shouldn't the soft taco combo cost $11 or do you get more rice and beans with the soft tacos? I was tempted to try a taco at 2.75, but didn't want the rediculous combo. Also, why would i want to tip at a place if i'm going for a cheap meal? If i take it to go, they'd get soggy and i would have rated it worse. I opted for Tito's taco's because i figured it'd be a step up in quality and a little more authentic than fast food at Jack-in-the-box. Maybe i shouldn't be so cheap and just get don antonio's tacos. However, i feel that i will be disappointed again and will drop back down to jack-in-the-box for a "value" bottom line: Maybe i should try something else like an enchilada or burrito, but i was advised the taco's are the best (how bad does that make the burrito then?) Maybe i'll try this place again, but i definately wouldn't go out of my way to come here when i visit socal. I'll stick to good food when in socal. SHIN-SEN-GUMI here i come!

I don't understand the hype about this place. OK, I admit, staying up watching late night tv, their commercials are a little amusing because they're so corny, but the food isn't all that great. Cheap, yes it is, but it's hard to sell me on hardshell -gringoized tacos that taste bland compared to tacos you can get at jack in the box, on top of that, when the cheese you use looks like it came pre-shredded in a bag that says KRAFT on it, the ratings go even lower. BTW I hate watery salsa, the salsa here is more like tomato puree. But hey if you're in a bind on cash and you need food... Tito's it is.

Tito's Tacos sucks! Seriously wait 20 minutes in an outdoor line next to a busy road and busy freeway, then get a menu with 4 items on it, all of which are super mediocre and you can get at any other restaurant in the city. Not to mention when I became a vegetarian they stopped serving me the tacos, I asked for a taco with no meat and they kept saying "We only have one menu." WTF is that? I didn't ask if you have another menu! I want a taco! Any chef who's incapable of customizing food in even the slightest way is either an idiot or a narcissist and neither are deserving of the inexplicable attention Tito's Tacos gets. I think it's patronized by people who know nothing else besides Taco Bell or El Torito. I've been to literally hundreds of Mexican restaurants in LA, the only thing that stands out about Tito's Tacos is it's weird cult following. Here's why I think everyone is obsessed with it: There's two major types of Mexican restaurants in LA, the trendy chain restaurant with tv commercials and fancy celebrity chefs that serve $12 burritos that are actually bags of water with tomatoes floating in them. And then there's authentic restaurants that typically serve tacos and burritos for a couple dollars and they range from good to delicious. Tito's Tacos is the latter, it's a normal authentic restaurant. I would rate it somewhere between good and pretty good, nothing amazing. With super egotistical service due to their "celebrity." But a lot of people in LA will not eat at the "authentic" mexican places, seeing them as cheap and dirty, either afraid of the "local" people eating there or the low prices, they prefer the "upscale" expensive and much worse tasting places. But because Tito's Tacos has a funny name and weird architecture, not to mention the word-of-mouth they go there, only to discover normal Mexican food for the first time, and they attribute this amazing new discovery to Tito's itelf, which is wrong.

good tacos! just make sure u add the whole deal..cheese, guacamole and that salsa "wana-b" (sometimes is really good) but yeah they are good...now let me warn you about those TAMALES....they sell...if you have never had REAL tamales...u will think these are the best...but trust me...they are NOT! They give u a "salsa" to dip the tamale in...which by the way makes the tamale taste bad! well of course they are not real tamales.! so please...if you are not mexican...make sure u dont let these people fool you...that is not how the real tamales taste like...! GOING BACK TO TAMALES...another reason why they taste so bad is because the masa (the thing u eat) is a cheap one. Good tamales are made out of good MASA...but of course they are cheap to buy good masa...ok this is all. good luck! p.s. there are good tamales out there...of course the ones my mother makes!!! oh yeah!!! too bad u cant taste them!:P

I don't get it. How can this joke be so popular with Westsiders ? Maybe it's because they are so desperate for something "real" that they think this taco stand from Central Casting is the real deal ? Maybe they are just deprived of Tacos Bell and El Pollo Loco over there because the rents are too high for the cheap chains ? Or maybe most of them are just East Coast transplants who have no clue ? Not that bad for Taco Bell style tacos, but I thought the oh-so-sophisticated and worldly Westside diners would know a real taco when they tasted one ? Fail....

Nothing special here.  Certainly several steps above fast food though.  I guess you have to be from the area to really appreciate Tito's, as it retains a loyal following.  Liked the runny guacamole quite a bit.  Bonus points for not using ground beef swimming in grease, too.

I've seen the commercials on ch 4 late at night thinking to myself that actually looks good not to mention the jingle is catchy. One day my friend asks if I ever ate there I said I hadn't so that same night we made the trip out there. It was pretty packed and the food was pretty bomb there were 3 of us and we all got four tacos to the dome not to mention they threw in a huge side of chips and salsa. I think the best thing about titos is the tacos I've tried the burrittos on other occasions and would rather stick to the tacos they use real cheese and don't skimp on the portions. The only thing i don't like about going to titos is leaving and driving by the taco stand directly next door it's so sad and lonely there I might have to try that one day!!! Meh!!!

I don't get it. This stuff isn't authentic Mexican food and I'm not even Mexican and I know that. I don't know. Just like King Taco, I wasn't impressed. It's like Taco Bell, but a little bit better. I guess it's an institution, but last time I went, it wasn't anything special. It was quite bland. Maybe next time I'm starving to death, I'll give them another try. Otherwise, I know millions of other places I'd rather go. Some of them, don't even have walls.

After getting turned away from the Kogi truck, I decided to stop here. I got the usual Taco with cheese and an All Meat burrito. This may not be the best Mex food in the area, but it will always taste the same from year to year. I think its more of a novelty thing. The red salsa is soo mild, you can just drink it. If you have a big group with a minimum purchase, you can order on-line, then send a couple of people to pickup. Funny thing was about 6 CHP motorcycle officers put up, and a few people got fidgety or worried. Lots of people here, hummmmmmmm, why?

Tons of people here tonight on a hot, summer night.  Since I've moved to Los Angeles two years ago, this was the first Mexican food I had outside of Chipotle (not Mexican, I know), so I figured I should give it a try since I've heard Mexican food in LA is better than what I've had in Nor Cal.  Tito's Tacos seems to be a good place to start, as it looks to be a landmark. $1.50 for a taco, it's pretty good deal.  The meat was flavorful, and the taco shell had a real nice crunch.  Along with the lettuce and a bit of the salsa, it was a good harmony of flavors.  The chips given here was also good.  Big and crunchy, and goes real well with the salsa.  I also had a bit of the meat and cheese burrito here, and it was pretty good, definitely something to try next time here.  Am I a bit harsh by not giving this place 4 stars?  I don't think so.  Tito's Tacos is definitely a place I'll go back to, but it's definitely not the best taco I've had.

Here I am, just another reviewer of Tito's. Its a bit of a tradition, this place, but a worthy one. Everyone has to try Tito's at least once, just like Tommy's and Pink's. I wouldn't call them traditional Mexican, but its traditional Tito's. They do taco's their own wonderful way, and you will often see a line of mouth watering patrons, waiting for their fix. Trust me, they are not Del Taco or Taco Bell. Way better. WAY BETTER!!!!!

Didnt know they only have hard shell tacos, and I'm not a fan of that.  It's pretty much like Taco Bell, but with long lines.  The salsa was watery, it tasted like canned tomato juice.  Same goes for the guacamole.  The chilli had big chunks of beef in it.  That was pretty good, but taste nothing like chilli, more like a beef stew.  They give a nice big to go box, with all the items packed securely in containers.  It helped making my car ride spill proof.

I just don't get why this place is so popular.  I waited in line at this taco stand for ten minutes, not to mention the ordeal finding a parking spot and a table.  I felt like I was being cheated somehow.  Maybe it was their cash only policy, or maybe it was the pushiness of the counter lady.  As a side note, they did not serve any other meat besides beef.  The tacos were good, but nothing special really.  You can do better.

If you're actually perusing the 700+ reviews of Tito's Tacos and debating whether or not to go... I would give more credence to those who gave Tito's 2 or 3 stars. One reviewer wrote that the tacos are glorified versions of Jack in the Box tacos. Sadly, that statement is fairly accurate. Another wondered why so many people would wait in such long lines for the food. I wonder the same thing. Another pointed out that management needs to figure out a way to make things more efficient. No disagreement here. Don't go to Tito's expecting that it will meet the hype that inexplicably accompanies it. You will be disappointed... as I was.

Once on the lips, twice on the hips!  But who cares?  Those darn tacos with queso are about as delicious as tacos can be.  The tamales are quite good as well.  Order extra salsa with your food, and you can really burn your mouth off, and be happy about it!  When I am not worrying about my waistline, this is the fatning treat for South of the border delights.  Don't want to dress up?  You will look better than most of the clientelle, so come as you are.  I saw one girl in slippers and her PJ bottoms one time when they opened up mid morning.  Still, those tacos are good, and I will go there again, and again, because this is about as authentic as it gets.

The only thing you need to know about Culver City is Tito's Tacos. They deep fry their taco's in lard, need I say more! I'm a fan of their enchilada's and their meat burrito's with cheese. A meal is never complete without  a taco with cheese and be sure to order a side of guacamole, it's really saucy but I like it. This is a chow down place. I do suggest a hunt and gather system upon arrival - Someone hunts out a table while the other person stands in line and deals with the order. This is not a date place but more of a we're now a team and are comfortable with each other eating experience. You either love or hate Tito's and I love Tito's for life.

I usually have my co-workers pick me a couple of tacos if they make the Titos run.  I thought that the extra hard shell was due to the fact that the taco had cooled down from the trek back to the office.  I then finally had the time to eat at the site.  The taco shells were still hard.    It isn't authentic and it wasn't unique...it reminds me of the tacos I had for lunch in elementary school. I am not sure why this place is always crowded all times of the day.  The tacos are not that much better than Taco Bell or Del Taco.

I grew up around Tito's so Tito's salsa is practically in my blood.  I seldom travel to this side of town anymore but when I'm in the neighborhood, I have to have my Tito's fix!  I still go to the same dentist not because he's GREAT or anything, he's just close to Tito's and it's an excuse for me to travel into the old 'hood.  I loved it when I was pregnant with my girls, I used my "cravings" as an excuse to send hubby to get my fix.   Love the tacos, but it's the meat (don't know what kind, don't care) burrito that I crave.  It's an art form to try and eat a whole Tito's burrito without having a drop of sauce spill over the wrapping, and, yep, I've perfected that art!  Tito's has a nostalgic/cult following...someone needs to do a documentary film of this Culver City institution.  You either love it or hate it.  I love it!!

Tito's really is only a step or two above Taco Bell.  Don't go looking for gourmet or even truly authentic Mexican.  Tito's is an LA institution and everyone should try once.  I think the food is pretty damn good and I love the guacamole, nice and thin just as it is in Mexico.  Been going here since I was a kid and make a point to stop in every time I am in LA.

I feel bad trashing this place because not only is this place legendary, but also the lady behind the counter and I bonder about her son who didn't eat meat. It reminds me of old LA. And it's surrounded by restaurants of similar fame. But the food just wasn't up to snuff. Maybe because I was sober. The clientele was all over the place, from teens sipping energy drinks to suited middle-aged Mexicans sporting buttons of their favorite politician's face. I'm glad I went, but I secretly feel guilty that the food at Cinco De Mayos might have a little more bang for the drunks and vegetarians.

"I love Tito's Tacos. You'll love Tito's too. The only thing better than a Tito's Taco... is two. The only thing better than a Tito's Taco... is two." If you've ever seen this TV commercial that looks like it was a 6th grader's final project in his media class or something that your friend put together while drunk on iMovie, this is that very Tito's Tacos on the corner of Washington and Sepulveda. I don't really know what it is about Tito's that keeps me coming back. I love it, but I can't really explain why. Maybe it's the freshly fried hard taco shells, or the delicious homemade chips and salsa. Maybe it's the fact that the tacos are so greasy that you can put finger prints on your cardboard box after you get your hands on your $1.50 taco. Maybe it's just the fact that Tito's feels like anything but a chain restaurant in a city filled with commercialized restaurant-age. Whatever it is, Tito's Tacos has some of the best tacos (hard shell) in the L.A. area and they even come with a complimentary unintended, food coma nap! (you will take a nap if you eat four tacos like I do) Ok, some things about Tito's aren't so good. 1) Tostada - No idea why, but the tostadas at Tito's are gross. The tostadas are made of the same delicious shell as the tacos, but in a different shape, but for god knows why, I found it to be completely disgusting. 2) Guacamole: Like the salsa at Tito's, the guacamole is not thick at all. Instead of being a thick guacamole that your White friends make in their beautiful Cusinart food processor before you have them over for a football party, the Tito's guacamole is kind of like the green avocado salsa at La Salsa or Poquito Mas. It's VERY ok. 3) Burritos: I know a lot of people love these, especially the people that get the "All Meat" Burrito, but it's just not my thing there. I know a lot of people love it, so I'm not going to get into it too much, but when I've had a burrito there, it was very ok and I've been to a lot of hole in the wall Mexican places and even a handful of those carts that operate on a generator in random alleys in East L.A. However, it's called Tito's TACOS for a reason. You go there for the tacos, which are delicious in their own unique way. The tacos are simple - meat, cheese, lettuce, yummy and greasy shell, for $1.95 ($1.50 without cheese, but you should get cheese unless you are a lactard - as in your process lactose slowly). These are not those $1.25 baby tacos in soft shells that you get at Del Taco or at your hole in the wall joint that you make you feel like you know "real Mexican food," these are some good sized hard tacos that are pretty unique in taste. Since they are different than most other tacos, I can see why it's a little hit or miss for people, but it's a hit for me. It's definitely not healthy, nor a place that you take a girl to impress her (unless your girlfriend is awesome), as you'll likely order outside and take your boxes of tacos home, but it's just a place with delicious tacos. If you're a guy, get 3 or 4 tacos. Four comes with the nap that I mentioned earlier. If you're a girl, get 1 to 3 tacos. Three comes with the nap as well. To give your tacos that extra kick that is lacking because of the mild salsa, ask your nice taco artist if they can hook you up with the jalapeno salsa, which makes them that much better. One thing: Order correctly and know what you want. It's a neighborhood-like spot, even though it gets a ton of people, but I saw some guy "return" his burritos and everyone looked at him like they wanted to kill him because you just don't do that at Titos.

I don't know, maybe i'm in the minority. I don't think their food is as good as it's hyped up to be. Their tacos are just basically taco shell, meat, then deep fried. You have to pay extra for cheese. Their burritos are alright. Their salsa is watery. I like El Abajeno better.

I won't lie...I just don't get it.  Have you ever been to Jack in the Box and ordered one of their tacos?  It's basically mystery meat in a shell and the whole thing is deep fried.  Now imagine that but bigger, more expensive and a fairly long line.  I'm just not a fan of the deep fried taco.  For years I listened to everyone rave about this place.  I've tried it twice to give it a fair shot but....just not my thang.

Mad overrated.  Skip this place and don't listen to anyone that hypes it up.    I think there's still some grease residue in my intestines from when I last ate there in 2006, and even then the only reason I ate it was because my boy picked up the tab.  I've sat on my couch stoned and watched the commercials and thought to myself "I should really stop eating junk food when I'm stoned".  That's the only positive contribution Tito has made to my life.

Awful quality, oily tacos with very little flavor.  Oily chips and the worst salsa and watery guacamole I've ever had.  If this sounds good to you, check out this place.  When you decide you want great tacos, take the drive to Henry's Tacos in Studio City.

I'm sorry but a restaurant that has been around as long as Tito's has, almost always has a line of people inside and outside, always has a full parking lot and is known by all the locals deserves more than 3 stars!! I give stars based on how well the restaurant rises to the level of expectation it should based on the exterior, convenience, price, and cuisine. Tito's is a 5 star! I grew up around LA and Dad took us to Tito's regularly, when I moved away I hit Tito's up as soon as I flew into LAX (and usually a couple more times during the trip!). I've lived on the west coast, east coast, Texas and Australia and no matter where I go I miss and crave Tito's! Thankfully I live in San Diego now so I make it into LA often. I've had everything on the menu at least once, but for me the Tito's experience is all about a taco with cheese and a bean and cheese burrito. It's awesome! I've taken many people there who frowned at the looks of the place (it has not been updated in years and the same video games have been in the restaurant since I was a kid 20 years ago), the limited menu and the food when it arrives in it's cardboard box. But a few bites in they are all smiles!

Why the long lines? Why? (shaking my head) First off, there is only one type of meat you can choose. No choice of soft tacos with corn or flour tortillas but hard tacos only. Since I am not a big fan of hard tacos, I could care less for it and was highly disappointed when I saw the greasy hard tacos brought out. There was no difference between that and Jack's tacos. As for the burritos, it was all meat and much more filling but again, it was just too bland for me. Nothing stood out of the ordinary. However, despite the usual long lines, the staff is pretty quick to take orders and move the lines. Not much seating so either take it to go, eat in your car or if you are lucky to find a bench around there. Prices are quite reasonable though.

I would call it above average and worthy of a visit.  Its cash only, fast food setup.  The tacos are good and greasy, but a very limited menu.  Don't expect to find any chicken, other meats on the menu.  It is a famous staple/landmark so swing thru it once, but you will not likely be there every week..

If you're ready for some down, dirty, and cheap Mexican food, there's no other place to go than Tito's. Without a doubt it has the best SALSA in the city, be sure to ask for extra, it's that good. Despite some saying the line is long, it goes quickly, however seating is usually a problem.

I totally agree with Julie N on everything except the chips. Giving this place a second chance:  We got there around 10 (parking was ok) looked at the menu board outside, and we were amazed...no lines...not even no person....WRONG!!!  A customer on his way in, informed us that only the inside was only rite then.  So we went inside, there it was, several lines almost out the door. When we finally got over the dumbness (waiting outside for a window to open) we felt....we discussed the menu amongst ourselves....meat and bean burrito, meat burrito, chili bean, beef tamale, chicken tamale, enchilada, tosada, Spanish rice, refried beans with lard....heck NO.... the verdict (to go): 4 tacos w/ cheese-dry and bland, but nice amount of cheese....don't forget the cheese paper after the taco. I should just get a cheese taco next time. 1 meat burrito-sloppy joe mess without any taste:  Tastiest out of everything. 1 chicken tamale (came w/ burrito meat sauce)-needed some kind of over protein to counteract the beefiness: bland and boring, I was expecting corn tamale, it was more flour based. The chicken was dry and tseasoning was mute. Chips: warm and crunchy (probably result of getting there early)..a little to thick for me. I prefer lighter, airy chips.  Same tortilla they use for taco shell...I think. Salsa: Ohhhh..... so that's what it was...I thought it was some sort of soup...hehe. That's the only thing I could have used more of to cleanse my palette after all the beefy blandness. Use a fork to strain out the salsa then drink the rest..if you like it enough. Definitely done with Tito's...no "third times the charm" Bs. The tacos are okay but nothing worth waiting for parking or waiting in line.  Like Julie N, for better taste and price, go to Jack in the Box and pick up some 99cents tacos.

My rating is for the fact it does what it does very well.   I've been going since 1964, and currently must have some Tito's  at least every 5 weeks.  I ignore the tacos and go for beef and bean (yes, the beans help) burritos and the tostada.  Well trimmed and tender beef.  Tostada logistics: eat it with a fork.  Add the good red salsa and runny but tasty guacamole sauce to all.    Lines, yes, much  of the time.   The chips: I've never understood why so many people like them.  Parking lot plus street.  Despite the simplicity, it's the only Mex joint that  I  actually NEED to frequent, thus the rating.

Really? You want to go to Tito's? Can't we find a Taco Bell around here? The first time I went, will also be the last. These tacos remind me of the ones they used to give us in the school cafeteria, only not as good.  I will never understand the hype, or why people find it ok to stand in line for such a long time to eat this stuff. The staff was mean. The patrons were mean.I don't like it when people are mean. I will blacken an eye. C'mon people, just because a place has been around for years, does not mean it is any good. Don't be such suckers! Say no to the Tito's! Stand up for yer tastebuds! I gave this place one star because the drink was cold and refreshing on a hot day.

Ugh, Rachel Ray featured it on her show? No wonder people think it's such a let-down. (It's my firm belief she over-hypes things with all the orgasmic chewing she does...) Look, I was born in Santa Monica; but when we left the hospital I went home to Culver City. Since then, I've lived in Culver City for nearly twenty years now. As such, I grew up with Tito's Tacos. I love their salsa; I'm not a person that loves very spicy anything, so it's awesome in my book.  Also: just because places name themselves after a certain dish doesn't necessarily mean that you should buy it (Tito's burritos rock my world way, way more than the tacos ever have.) Chips, salsa, and a meat-bean-cheese burrito make for a very delicious (though very full-feeling) evening. Another thing I do is get a couple of plain tacos and dip them in the salsa - awesomeness. However, have to agree with another yelper about the guacamole - their's blows like the invisible chunks they don't have in it.

just ate there and it's 10.30p on friday night.  i've been seeing the lines out to there on my way to and fro and said to myself, "self, you must try that place one day.   but first, read the reviews on yelp."  i really don't understand why people are standing in line to eat this stuff.  i must agree with some of the other reviewers that the meat is probably like dog meat. it's unidentifiable in its taste, but reminiscent of beef in it's texture. my frequent dining companion didn't get the hype of this place either, but we tried to look for the positives.  nice crowd. eclectic. family. old, young. black, white, mexican.  i don't understand why any mexicans would eat the food here, though.  i can understand why other people would because they don't know better.  the servers are super sweet.  the food is cheap.  but it's just so not good. i brought the "meat" from my burrito home to feed my dog and my date asked increduously, "you going to feed that to your dog??"  and i said, "what? you don't think i should give the dog, dog meat?"  i was joking.  but really, it's so bad.  go to one of the taco trucks that park on venice blvd at night or la cabana or casablanca or el tarasco,  but don't waste your money here, not even the 8.70 we spent for two (burrito, tostada, guac). if you MUST go there because someone is forcing you, get the tostada (it's vegetarian) with sides of guac and jalepeno sauce, says my special friend.

Tito's is OK but I still do not see the fascination with this place. Tito's had to grow on me before I would start eating it freely. I do like the fact that their approach to food is simple but due to their budget cuts...their portions are being cut slightly and prices were raised slightly. I have tried the burritos before and did not like them. So when I do go I just stick with the tacos. The tacos are the best best there.

I finally went to this place after a friend of mine swore they had the best tacos around. Came here pretty much out of pitty.... Which if you read my other reviews is usually the only reason I go to mediocre places. Of course we had the tacos and my friend didn't say a word the whole time because he was tearing them up and licking his fingers and praising the place. I swear I thought I was eating dog poop half the time. But then I see people waiting in a long line and I think to myself maybe something's wrong with my palate. I mean I can't stand Denny's, I hate tacos Mexico and sizzlers is pretty much the worst restaurant ever made but then I see the patronage at these places and it bewilders me. I tried telling people to try pinches tacos in Santa Monica but everyone thought I was making up the name. Anyways I had the chupa cabra special which came with two tacos a side of rice and extra puto on the side just to give it a kick.!

Came here on a friend's suggestion, and there's initially a few downsides to this place. The parking is very small, and the set-up for getting your food can be a bit confusing - you wait in line, order your food, and wait for the person who served you to get your food, you pay for food, and wait for your chance. Doesn't sound complicated, but with 20+ people standing around the line, it can be a bit of a maze. Other than that the food was pretty good. Each meal comes with a sizable serving of chips and salsa, and the beans and rice are good. I had their beef tamale and it was good enough. I left very full, which is a good sign. If in the area I'd pay here a visit, but I heard that the summertime is the worst time to come because of the ridiculous lines that form. Time your visit right so the masses don't ruin your dining experience.

This place was cool in high school. Where we piled up in one car and drove all the way out from the valley and hooted and hollered all the way down and TITOOOSSSSS TACCOOSSSS was one big party and we barely cared what the food tasted like, especially since we probably smoked a DOOBIE in the parking lot beforehand. I moved it up to 2 stars for the nostalgia and the name and the fun times I've had. As an adult, don't even try it. "Cash Only" was cool and hip for special spots; in the 80s. Now it's just inconvenient. Most importantly, the food is terrible. I don't even know what im eating. Everything seems like one molten microwaved flavorless mess. I don't understand the long lines and crazy reputation this place has. Maybe the owner Tito sold the place and the new guy cut all costs and let it go to hell. Either way, I'm sure the taco shack right next door I have never tried is 10 times as good.

I just love their tacos.  The tortilla chips & salsa that come with your order are very yummy as well.  There seem to be lines there all the time to place an order but it's well worth the wait.  They do have places to sit but it's more of a takeout place.  I always stop by whenever I'm in the area.  They have a very strong word of mouth & deservedly so (I have noticed some very late night commercials on TV recently).  It's a special treat not to be missed.

Thats all there is to it.  Damn good and I loved to go on Friday cause I would smell like tacos until around 3p on Sat.  Great start.  Just get the tacos though.  Enchilada kinda blows.  Tacos only.  Dont mess it up and try to do your own thing.  Tacos only!

Well, it ain't health food and if you're even close to vegan stay away. But if can enjoy some dirty, yummy, cheap food made with years of skillful frying than this is your place. If you've never had a Mexcian Dad make salsa for you then you won't be used to their extra liquid-y recipe. But having grown up on salsa straight from my papa's blender  this taste just like home! The tacos are addictive! The tamales are a brick in your stomach, but a very tasty brick at that! If you stick with chips with a side of guac, beans, and salsa you'll be one happy camper!

I love Titos Tacos...

This place is overwhelming. I had heard about this place forever so I stopped by with a friend for a late night snack. After being confused by the ordering and paying service and not being able to add stuff to my burrito, i was disappointed but hopeful. No spicy salsa, a stomach ache, and a bad shit later and it was confirmed: overrated

I met a friend here for dinner...I think they have the weirdest ordering style.  So...you place an order (with one of the ladies..make sure you remember who took your order)...you don't pay for it yet - and they don't give you a number or anything....5-10 minutes later, you'll hear your order called - by what you ordered (by the person who took your order, so that is why it is important to remember who tool your order)...Once you get your order, then you pay for it...kind of weird.  The tacos are good (they are the crunchy kind)...they do not have much on their menu, it's cash only and their salsa is quite delicious!

Tito's Tacos rocks! I know I am biased as I grew up with Tito's, but everyone I have taken there as an adult is also a fan. It is ALL about the tacos, with cheese, please! They are crunchy, greasy, meaty  goodness. The tacos come with a side of chips and tasty salsa, but  be sure to ask for a side of their neon green guacamole to pour over your tacos.  AAAAAaaaaaaaaugh...just writing this makes me want to go out and get some.

YUM!  The lines are long here for a reason.  It's just GOOD basic, no-frills Mexican food at a good price.  I have mostly stuck to tacos and tostadas, but their enchiladas were pretty good too.  Love the tostadas - just a crispy tortilla, beans, lettuce and cheese, the way tostadas used to be.  They are so used to people ordering $100 worth of food at a time, for a group of people, that when one person orders what one person can eat, their usual response is "is that all?"  I get extra tacos to take home and eat later.

there seems to be an ongoing debate about tito's tacos.  you either love 'em or you hate 'em.  i'm on the love 'em team. this is not the greatest mexican food in l.a. -- far from it.  but it's the experience.  there's something kinda weird about being a part of the never-ending line (which could be avoided if they didn't have their stupid one-person-takes-your-order-makes-your-food-takes-­your-money philosophy).  that being said -- it's kind of like starbucks.  i don't think starbucks has very good coffee, but it's an experience.  same for tito's. tito's is cheap.  their menu is limited.  but they have some of the best beef of any place in the neighborhhood.  the chips are on the hard side, but i really like the salsa.  it's very fresh and not too hot. the all meat burrito is purty good. i'd give 'em five stars, but that weird one-person server thing really irks me.

One of the LA classics.  The best hard tacos in town.  Totally unhealthy, so a perfect treat after yoga.   Don't expect a traditional Mexican restaurant.  Tito's has two or three items in the menu.  They only have hard beef tacos which come with chips and salsa.  So the only question is how many tacos you want, and whether you want cheese or not.  Can be pretty crowded at lunch time.  Now that I wrote my review, let's see how this Beacon thing works :)

I had heard about this place for years, and finally made my way there when I had to be in the area.  It certainly was popular, with the long lines inside and out.  I got a couple of tacos and their chips and salsa.  Excellent salsa, and very fresh tasting.  As to the tacos, I guess they really didn't knock my socks off.  When it comes to hard shell beef tacos, I much prefer the ones at Pepe's in Temple City.  When I told a devotee friend of mine I wasn't thrilled with the tacos at Tito's, he was shocked, and suggested that next time I try a burrito.  I would go back, but only if already in the neighborhood.

When I first started working in LA, people would tell me about this joint. So I went, and was kind of disappointed. The tacos are not bad, don't get me wrong, but you have to understand that I'm used to Taco joints with more variety. They only have shredded beef tacos - again, not bad, but no variety. I'm used to carne asada, carnitas, pollo, etc. This place is always busy, so it's not super-wack. I'll eat there, but again, I expected more.

I'm quite sure my taste buds have been impacted by nostalgia, but I love Tito's Tacos (the tacos specifically) dosed with a heavy helping of their delicious salsa. Always order more salsa than you think you want, and find a park close by to have a nice picnic under the trees. I suggest Vets or Carlson Park.

The tacos are to die for. If there's a better taco, I'd like to eat one. I get my tacos with a side of the enchilada sauce, goes well with the taco. Maybe not the most authentic Mexican food, but it is great quality and the tacos do not drip at all with grease or oil. Don't listen to the negative reviews, there are always some flakes who have to downgrade for the sake of downgrading, just like if someone tells the worlds greatest joke, no matter how funny it is, some people are disappointed, or maybe they were expecting strolling Mariachi band members.   Like Josh F. said, there is a reason for the CONSTANT lines despite the army of workers there. Why do you think that is? Certainly not for the atmosphere, so Tito's must be doing something right.  If you come to Titos looking for margueritas, you'll be bummed,  just expect great tacos and all-meat burritos at an inexpensive price. Remember, Tito's is a taco stand!

I do not understand the hype this place is. All it is is smoke, mirrors and a reputation because the food is nothing spectacular. I am from Mexico City and when I waited in line to get my tacos I was expecting to be blown away. Instead very disappointed by the bad quality and zero taste. I actually tried something at Taco Bell that was better. Please do not waste your time and try a real Mexican place next time. My suggestion is Guelaguetza in Korea town. That is the best Mexican place in my opinion.

Nastiest Mexican Food I have EVER eaten. WAAAYYYYYY over-hyped and not worth the drive nor the time it took to stand in line. I didn't even mention the horrible parking. Tacos were dry (no sauce...... seriously) Shells were overcooked. Beef was bland and way too dry. Meat and bean burrito = disgusting Tamale = disgusting Enchilada=disgusting All of the chicks taking peoples orders NEVER took their plastic gloves off to prepare your food AFTER they had been handling money, pencils, calculators and the bill. I was watching.... they would use the same gloves customer after customer and touch all sorts of things. The health dept. realllllyyy needs to get a look at this place. On a postive note.... I ended up eating an old shoe I found near the parking lot and have to say that IT tasted WAY better than the crap I just paid $26 dollars for.   (my entire family agreed) Save yourself the trouble and the drive and just eat an extra cardboard box you might have sitting around in your garage..... you'll get better flavor AND save yourself time and money.

When I went there last Sunday night and ordered only 8 tacos w/cheese and the bill was $18.80 W.T.F! Seriously $19.00 for 8 tacos, It's no wonder why you don't see any lines out front of Tito's any more! In this economy they need to get a clue before they price themselves out of business.

Sure, this ain't your hole-in-the-wall Mexican spot w/abuela serving up authentic soft corn tortilla tacos, but clearly Tito's has been holding it down on the westside.

Tito's is overrated, plain and simple.  Finding a parking space is a major chore, then the lines are always super long.  It's hardly worth the effort for "just OK" tacos that you can get at just about any of the bazillion other taco joints in the greater Los Angeles area.  But if you happen to be in the area, take a stroll around the corner and get a pastrami sandwich at Johnnie's instead.

I liked the food but just didn't understand why there was such a huge line of people waiting to order. I think its the price of the food.

I just went here yesterday for the first time with 2 other people, and I will agree that the lines/ordering is a bit disorganized, but I think the food made up for it. Between the 3 of us I got to try most of the things on the menu and I will say that the enchilada was average, the guacamole was so-so mainly because it was too runny, the beans and rice were pretty good, and the chips and salsa that automatically came with our order were very tasty. I definitely liked the beef tacos the most because they were larger than normal and also stayed together nicely. Next time I eat here I'll probably get a few tacos and maybe some beans and rice.

I have no idea how they get as many stars as they do. Those who rate them so high, what kind of tacos have you ate before? Point blank, this food is disgusting. I can only rate them on what I ate: a taco a tostada rice guacamole salsa chips The taco was not tasty at all. When I saw the 30 tacos laying in a steel container I figured they were gonna be stale. Sure enough, they were. The meat was scary, looked like it was fried dirty meat. They should not be named after their tacos, its almost funny thinking they named it after the tacos. This is where they gained THE star, the one and only. It was crisp and fresh and the beans were good. Not much else here. I would eat another, if it weren't for the line and the hassle. The rice was not good, it was dry and lacked flavor. Oh so nasty was the guacamole. I'm laughing right now thinking about how they even make it. It's just plain soupy and has no flavor what so ever. Salsa, just like the guacamole, is flavorless, and without heat. I'm actually getting tired of writing about what I ate, but for the chips they were just plain stale. There is no way that this many people wait in line and fight for a table to eat this food. It must be the prices, compared to LA food prices, this has to be something that most can afford. Its a change from the other fast food restaurants that are around. Still I will NOT EAT the tacos again. Period.

The first place I ever ate in Los Angeles, and still one of my favorites.  Not for the faint of heart (or the health conscious), but if you can brave the wait then you won't be disappointed.  I stick mainly to the tacos and an occasional side of guacamole.  No better place for an indulging snack to celebrate that promotion or tax break!

Tito's was listed as the best hard tacos by LA Weekly ( I think). This place is OK. I love tacos durado and wanted to see how they compared to those at Los Grandes (in Santa Ana, on Rait and 5th) It was extremely busy when I went for lunch one day. They basically only sell hard beef tacos. Like I said they were OK. Good flavor but nothing to make me say wow! Haven't been back since and probably won't go back since it's a drive from my house and I'd rather just take the drive to Los Grandes.

I finally figured it out:  You know how there's ALWAYS a line of people here, both inside and out?  It's 'cause they're so slllloooooowwwww with inefficiency, it forces a backup.  And I guess that's smart, 'cause that way, there's ALWAYS a line, and therefore, always an air of mystique about the place for newbies...Plus a justification of the time spent waiting at the window for oldies like me who need their fix: Yes, Tito's makes a taco unique to itself in this universe:  Hard shell, iceberg lettuce, shredded cheddar, and their oddly gamey-tasting, yet somehow beguiling beef.  The burritos are the same meat, all stewed-up in a thin flavorful sauce, with or without refried beans.  The burritos are delicious, but you gotta be careful.  My experience has been that once you bite into it, you have to keep holding it or it'll fall apart into a big wet (and HOT) mess, 'cause there's no rice or other dense stuff in there to keep it held together.  Their salsa is super basic and AWESOME:  Basically just puréed tomatoes with a bit of salt and maybe some vinegar.  Simple as can be, and always fresh and tasty. But yeah:  On the off chance that you visit at a time there's no line, you're gonna wait what seems an eternity for your simple taco:  It'll only be the eight thousandth one they've made that day, and although they could have a staging setup for dozens of ready-made tacos at a time and still keep everything fresh, they have this ritual:  The counter person will take your order...Write it on the ticket...Punch in numbers into a calculator to add it up...Walk away...Put on a pair of foodservice gloves...Make the taco...Make another taco...Make another taco...Make a burrito...Make another burrito...Place chips and salsa in the box with the order...Take off the gloves and throw them away...Bring the box to you...Announce the total...Take your money to the cash register (on a riser in the middle of the kitchen, a very exalted place, it seems)...Then finally will bring you your change and send you on your way.   Multiply this process by some 90 customers an hour, with a total of about 8 people working the line, and you get the Interminable Tyranny of the Tito's®.  But when you want some-a dat Tito's shit, you just gotta have it.

I really like this place.  Feels like LA.  There are little unwritten rules.  Like you should tip the person that takes your order.  You can share the benches with strangers.  There's always a line out there.  I usually get two tacos with cheese (cheese is extra) and a chile con carne burrito.  The burrito is usually piping hot.  But the ingredients are so fresh, it's a taste bud's delight.  The salsa is pretty good and you can get the guac as well if you feel like finishing all the chips they give you.  I always stop by if I'm in the area.

Tito's offers the best tacos in LA.  If you want burritos, enchiladas, carnitas or carne asada tacos, or authentic Mexican food by the plate, go somewhere else  (I recommend the restaurant next door).  But, if you are seeking a really good crunchy shredded beef taco, topped with lots of freshly shredded cheese, and served with a flavorful salsa , this is The Place. The menu  is very short and that is one of the beauties of the place.  They focus on just a few items and do those well.  As I said above, the tacos are the best in LA.  I  don't care for the burritos, but I know people who do. They are made with all meat, no beans or rice, so appear a bit smaller. The tamales are OK if you want something different. The major "down" of Titos is the crowds that it attracts.  The parking situation is a nightmare.  With 3 excellent restaurants on that corner, the line of  vehicles waiting to park snakes through the alley and streets.  Finding a parking spot is an art form and actually  worsened since they added handicapped spots and CalTrans began to remodel the 405.  Once you have parked, ordering your food is another challenge.  Expect long lines.  Also, there is a unique protocol to ordering that can be challenging for a first-timer.   Prices are very reasonable but payment is cash only.  As change, Tito's frequently gives half dollar coins. It can be fun for the coin collector, but I have always suspected that the intent is for you to use it to tip to the person who prepared your order.  Yes, You are expected to tip that person individually; there is no common tip jar. Inside the building there are long tables and benches for those eating on site.  If you choose to eat there expect to share the space with whoever plops down next to you.  The tables are crowded, not always clean, and not at all private.  In the summer it is hot and in the winter it is cold,.  Despite how negative this all sounds, it is one of the charms of the experience.  Somehow it gives a party atmosphere to eating there, although most people order "to go." All of the food is made on site, so it is always fresh.  I have seen them cutting tortillas to fry for chips and stirring vats of beans.  The salsa  is made daily  and you can tell the season by the color of the tomatoes used.  Salsa is deep red in September, at the height of tomato season, but pinkish in off season.  It is dished out by the ladle-full into big cups.  The salsa should be used profusely.  It is not super hot, but a good, basic sauce that can be doctored if you wish to increase the heat level. I have a lot of memories from Tito's.  I have been eating there for 30+ years, beginning when then-Governor Jerry Brown and his girlfriend Linda Ronstandt would drive up to order.  When I lived in Culver City I went there quite regularly.  I now live in The Valley but have been known to drive down there for a taco fix.  The day I got married, after I I had my hair and makeup done, I stopped at Tito's for taco lunch.  I will never forget the stares, as I did look rather out of place.    I served Tito's salsa at a wedding reception and the guests asked, "Where did you get this?" So, YES, the tacos, chips and salsa are totally worth the incredible hassle of parking.  My suggestion to avoid parking is to take someone with you and, drop them off to get the food, while you circle the block.   I you want a big menu, with combo plate, huge burritos, and soft tacos, go somewhere else.  The trick to eating out is to choose the place that specializes in the item you are ordering.  You don't go to a fish place and order the one meat item on the menu.  So don't come to Tito's and complain because they don't offer carne asada tacos.

Titos Tacos is BY FAR the BEST local taco place there is. I've been coming here since I was a little girl and it doesn't get any better than Titos. I've tried other taco places, but nothing compares! Ppl who complain about the grease or standing in line, that's all part of the "Tito Experience" (you deal with it and when your food comes, you understand that's it's authentic mexican food and good mexican food is greasy). I always order two tacos with cheese, extra chips/salsa, and a side of guacamole. It's delicious and CHEAP!!  If you've never been to Titos, you have to go!; it's where all the locals know where to get good tacos :) There are always going to be people to don't like Titos, so if you're reading this, try it for yourself with an open mind.

No, it's not really Authentic Mexican food but does it really matter? Sure their entire concept is odd, you stand in line outside for the most part, for deep fried shells, shredded beef, shredded lettuce, shredded cheddar cheese, a very very odd avocado sauce........but damn, they are so addicting...........I really don't care if it's "real" it just feels right!!!

Its fast food, something Im not big on but for the price and taste, its definately a LA must go to and try. Everyone in LA knows about it, and most people think its pretty good. Stick with the tacos or burritos. The tamales and enchilladas not so bueno. Along with every order you get a bag of chips. Sweet. Im big on beans so order yourself a side of beans and a taco or two and you will be set for a happy tummy and a wallet with only under $6 spent. Not bad!

Titos Tacos is definitely one of the yummiest and most inexpensive places in LA--that's why I'm giving it 5 stars. I found it when driving by and was attracted to it because of the long lines. I like to order two tacos with cheese. It comes with yummy chips and delicious salsa. I usually spurge and get the guacamole sauce too. And, a root beer. Sadly, I think it's Mug rb, not Barqs. The parking, seating and efficiency of the transaction (paying for/getting your food) could use an upgrade, but it's also part of the Tito's Tacos charm i suppose.

This place gets 4 stars only if you go here with the right mentality. You don't come to Tito's to look for a fine dining, authentic food and flavors or charm. Tito's has none of that. What it does have is really great fresh salsa, fine chips, consistency, and delicious tacos for quite a value. Although there are almost always people eating at Tito's, the service is super fast because of the several order windows open. I have been going to Tito's since 2000 and have never had a bad taco or old salsa. Let's put it this way... there is a reason why there is always a line.

What else can I say than it would be my last meal on earth!  I LOVE Tito's.  The tacos and the salsa are my favorite!  The tacos are made with a hard shell and shredded beef and have lettuce and cheese, or you can ask they not add cheese.  The secret is to add the chunky salsa to the taco.  They also have tostadas, burritos tamales and other traditioal Mexican dishes.  But everyone I know who goes there, primarily goes for the Tacos.  The chips and salsa are awesome as well.  I always order extra chips and salsa to take home with me.  I grew up on Tito's.  I've been going there since before I could speak!  I used to live nearby but now I live in the Valley.  But let me tell you that I do make the drive on the 405 to get me some Tito's!  Mmmmm.....

the tacos are great. only if you like tacos one way - shredded beef in a crunchy shell with lettuce and the cheese is optional. the red salsa is kinda bland. but the green salsa more than makes up for it - if you like spicy and flavorful salsa - go green. the guacamole is absolutely dreadful. it's like soup. bland soup at that. how can they absolutely desecrate the wonderful avocado by liquefying it?  no redeeming quality to that guac.  i'm sorry to say that. to their credit, their tortilla used on the burrito is quite good - and again - the beef is good... so the beef & bean burrito is a good option... the lines are long - the food is cheap - the tacos are good.  but that's not enough to get me to come back to culver city.  this evening was the first time i had tito's in 15 years.  perhaps i'll try them again in another 15 if they're still around.  or not.

This place seems to have a cult following, as indicated by the massive crowds lining up to get the simplest damn Mexican food I have ever seen for sale in a restaurant.  Unfortunately, you probably have to be part of the cult to really love it.    The extra ingredients are what make great Mexican great and you'll only get beans cheese and meat here.  However, the tomato salsa they give you for free is a winner as are the tortillas they use to make the burritos.  But the watery supermarket style guac is a  big loser.   In any case, there is something charming about the 1970s-esque hand pained signs, cheapo decor and cash only policy... makes me feel like I should be part of the cult after all.  Or not... go next door to Cinco de Mayo, pay an extra dollar and be happy.

Like many others, I have been eating Tito's since I was a kid.  Maybe that's why I crave it sometimes.  Tito's just is what it is and it's been the same for a long time.  Well, the burritos have shrunk and you can't get all the free salsa you want, but the flavors are still the same.  And I like it a lot.

By the time I get off from work which is 6PM no way I'll make it there on time so I opted for Tito's Tacos.  I'm a bit disappointed. My taste buds were craving for the experience I had while eating Ramona's hard shell beef tacos.  Oh, well it's a quick fix.  Hmm, my hubby likes their burrito of course nothing can replace Ramona's tacos and burritos.

Parking and lines aside, Tito's has grown to be one of the westside staples for me.  They're especially generous with the chips.  The salsa is OK; I wouldn't say it's the greatest, but certainly not mediocre.  As for the tacos themselves, the beef could be a little better.  If you're on a diet of any kind, this place isn't for you.

So everyone and their mom talks about this place.... Personally I dont really get why... the tacos are ultra greasy (and not in a good way) and the location puts you with your taco in the midst of exhaust and dust flying at you from traffic passing by.  The GREAT thing about this place (and the only good thing) is the salsa... it's the really watery kind that seems like it was put in  a blender and it's quite flavorful. so if you want some good chips and salsa (to go) .. that's what I would suggest you get and get your tacos elsewhere.

Delicious! I had heard for years about Titos Tacos and was not disappointed. Flew in from Sacramento, and went directly there from LAX. The tacos are definitely their forte as I had a tamale that was ordinary at best (and expensive compared to everything else). This is not gourmet cuisine but a good solid hole-in-the wall dive, so adjust your expectations accordingly. These are hard-shelled tacos, not to be confused with the small authentic street tacos in Mexico. The side order of beans were great and the rice was run of the mill. Portions are large. Cheap: my wife and I had way too much to eat and it was about $15. Check Titos out!

not authentic by any means, but really tasty stuff ... i had a burrito with meat and cheese and this meat was not the seasoned ground beef crap that you usually get at mexican fast food joints - the beef is chunky and really well spiced (i think i might have even detected a hint of cinnamon?). also, the guacamole was amazing and actually more authentically mexican than a lot of the tremendously chunky stuff you find around here. they even had delicious coffee (a large was served in a soup bowl!), all worth the wait.

there's this one super old guitar ad with eddie van halen in his bedroom and there's a Tito's cup in his room. rad. so, the food is greasy and not that great. the salsa is watery and guacamole a bit soupy. it's awesome. you are SUPPOSED to feel gross after you eat Tito's...just like you've eaten a bunch of greasy food. that's the point and it feels good. Tito's is a legend and i love it.

It WAS very cheap, but my bean and cheese burrito was really mediocre. Not a whole lot of flavor and very soupy, like it's been filled with porridge. There are so many excellent Mexican places in L.A. so why come here? Especially with the lines. Not worth it.

I ordered a tostada, chicken tamale, regular taco, enchilada, complimentary(?) salsa with chips, and small strawberry soda.  It cost $9.45.  None of it was bad, but is just wasn't great.  The salsa was very tasty but almost completely liquified.  I don't think any of it was very healthy, either.  I would rather go to Tacos Por Favor and pay $6ish for a great burrito and chunkier salsa.

Every time I get down to LA I go to Tito's and order at least 12 tacos, 4-5 burritos, 3 tamales (the sauce for these is really good) and extra salsa. It's not that tito's is the most exclusive mexican food around town, it is just its iconic statute that makes you addicted. The tacos are yummy, however they are not so tasty once cold, and that is why i always have the burritos, tamales and salsa to take home. The "dining" area is quite scary for a germaphobe, so i would take the food to go. They only take cash, however there is one of those "non bank affiliated" ATMs outside. I wish there was a Tito's closer to where I live!!

This place may not be authentic mexican food, but it's got the most fucking delicious crunchy tacos you'll ever have! Don't bother with anything else on their 5 item menu, except for maybe the burrito. Good salsa, good jalapenos and the chips are good, warm! You either LOVE it or you don't!

OK, everybody knows this place ain't great. It's not even REAL Mexican food to be honest. But there's something comforting about this food--kind of like the gringo Mexican food mom used to make. When I do decide to go to Tito's and brave the long, disorganized lines at the walk-up windows, trying not to feel guilty about the sheer volume of paper waste that this place contributes to the local landfill, I rarely get the tacos. I prefer the meat burrito. Sometimes the meat can be chewy, but it's stewed in this wonderful clove-flavored colorado sauce. Wait about 5 mins before biting into it, otherwise you'll get a nasty roof-burn-- At the very least, the food is served piping hot--more than can be said about any number of other LA Mexican sit-down restaurants (hot plate/cold food?) if you know what I mean...

I'm not sure what makes Tito's so good, but they are soo addicting. As said in another post, I think they might add some crack to their tacos. When you see the "chefs" (and I use that term lightly) adding the ingredients, it looks like shit lol, but when you do finally  get that first bite in.... it's like heaven. Mile long lines, horrid parking and bathrooms so dirty that you would rather go into a Andy Gump, are things that are just worth dealing with. I'm telling you...crack I tell you!

Wow I was really let down by this place. It was over 8 months ago that I ate here and I still can remember how plain it was. First off the tacos are nothing great to write home about very bland and the salsa they give you with the chips was also very bland. I was expecting more taste and flavor after all the hype this place gets. You want a good crunchy shell taco, go to Birrieria Mexico in Van Nuys.

I always come back to this place whenever I'm in Venice. My mom and pop would bring me and my brothers here on the weekends. At the age of 9 me and my brothers didn't really come for the food but mainly for the arcade in the back and the little chocolate peppermint patties in the front. That has changed of course. I always order big cause I cant go back home smelling like Tito's empty handed. 40 tacos w/ cheese, free chips, guacamole and salsa :Q I don't really bother with anything else but I know that my mother loves the enchiladas and my dad enjoys the tamales. I love the crunch of the taco shell, the heat of the shredded beef and the coolness of the cheese and lettuce.... Don't forget to top it off  with some salsa!!!!!! I love to dunk the taco in the salsa. sooo good! The only downside to Tito's is that I a bit far for me and that it's not open late (enough) The lines and not being able to find parking in the parking lot isn't much of a problem for me. Besides they handle your order pretty quickly.

My father has been coming here since he was in the kid and I've been coming here since I was a kid too hence the 4 stars. Although I believe that there food has gone down hill (really it's about 3 stars) I've gotta kick it another star just for the memories that I've got there. The tacos are really good, crunchy and tasty. I ike that they they freshly shred their cheese. The all meat burritos are waaay too intense for my taste. It really does taste like a stewed beef thats rolled into a burrito. I usually get the meat/bean/with cheese burrito. I feel that the beans help even out the intensity of that meat. The enchiladas there are whatevs, too much cheese if you ask me. The tostadas there are cool but waaay too much lettuce which makes it hard to eat. I still have yet to eat the tamales and rice there. The salsa is good there but towards the end of the day, I find, that it's usually watered down too much and there isn't too many chunks of tomatos and blah blah blah. The guacamole is great, a bit on the liquid side but it's definitely tasty and adds to the flavor of the tacos. The interior of the place is definitely not appealing but the food helps make up for it.

I gotta tell you Tito's is comfort food.  It really aims to please most, and I know a few people who don't care for it.  I on the other hand love the tacos.  I love the simplicity of it.  The tacos are lightly seasoned.  and they give you enough salsa and chips to drown in.

I'd heard amazing things about Tito's, and every time I passed by there were lines out the door - 11am, 4pm, you name the time and people were in line.  So I had to try it out... Sad to say I was not at all impressed.  The tacos weren't bad but I definitely don't think they are worth the fuss.  It was also difficult figuring out when my meal was ready as I wasn't given any order number or instructions for picking up the food.

I've definitely had better Mexican food than Tito's, but that being said, it is worth a look if you are in the area.  My expectations were too high because of the line out the door. I think nostalgia must play a big role in Tito's popularity, but there's nothing wrong with that. It's good, but not great.  Keep that in mind, and you should enjoy it.

Clearly, this place does NOT serve authentic Mexican food. However, the food that it does serve is incredibly good - some of the tastiest tacos that I have ever had in my life. The line can be long sometimes, but I've never waited more then about 15 minutes. Furthermore, it is darn cheap. One taco with cheese costs 2.25 and comes with chips. Two tacos with chips easily fill me up, and only cost 4.50! I highly recommend this place for quick fast food. You won't be getting authentic Mexican tacos, but they will be very tasty nevertheless!

It is what it is.  The memory of Titos... the lines, the heat... the order, wait, pay ritual... the search for a place to sit and eat... the 1957 cal-mex stereotype food... it sits fondly in one's mind going back over time more for the memory of days past than for the quality of the food itself.  The best one can say it that this is throwback food, and as such, an exercise in nostalgia.  One can love it for that, no?

Growing up in Culver City pretty much means you're a Tito's fan. It's a native hot spot. Where else can you get a hearty Mexican meal for under $5 bucks? I love Tito's...cheap, yummy, (definitely nothin' fancy) but a place to run in to old friends, indulge in the signature Tito's salsa, and get a fifty cent piece with your change. They've had the same great servers forever and it's a local iconic walk-up-window restaurant. They could use more parking. Yay Tito's!

I am convinced there is an army of workers in the back that take apart those horrible warmed up frozen taquitos that they fed you in elementary school.  There is a mountain of them in the back and the workers painstakingly unroll them and throw the meat into these tacos in hard shell tortillas and feed them to anyone foolish enough to try them.  I have been schooled: do not go to Tito's tacos.

After all these years of watching that commercial on NBC and getting that damn song stuck in head all the time, we finally took a trip down there. First off, you'll be lucky to find a parking spot without driving around the block for a half hour. Then you wait in very long lines. The exception is that the lines go at a decent pace. I got the tacos the first time. They were good though not great. And the salsa was nasty. I don't know what the hell that was. The enchiladas and burritos are awesome. I highly recommend them. Bottom line: It's a pain in ass but i keep going there every time I'm in the area. I'm a fan.

Explosively popular with the local crowd due to the cheap and filling eats, but your stomach may explode after you eat here, so be careful.  This place is not for the faint of heat, the vegetarian, or someone trying to eat even remotely healthy.  I have an inkling that America's weight problem started at Tito's Tacos.  It's the In-N-Out of Mexican food... cheap, simple menu, and fast.  With that said, Tito's should be on the list of "restaurants you should eat at before you die"... just don't eat too much of it because it may be your last restaurant on that list!

For crunchy tacos, Tito's is the shit.  For beef burrito, Tito's is the WMD. People complain about how not original it is.  Well, screw that because that's not what Tito's is all about.

Prices are very reasonable, may explain the line. The service is pretty quick too. I always get one taco and one burrito. I have never walked away from Tito's Tacos with a smile on my face.

Tito's Tacos is worth going to for the blended salsa alone. Others may say it's bland or watery. I think it's delicious and I like it not spicy. I almost always eat the hard tacos with shredded beef which honestly is average. The chips are a little thick but again they make my favorite salsa and give you a generous cup of it. There is usually a long line but with good service. Tito's has a small parking lot but I have never had a problem finding street parking nearby. I had a chicken tamale once. It was really good, moist and tasty. The beans are really smooth and creamy and need just a little salt but on my last trip yesterday I found out it's made with lard. Still it was very good and topped with a lot of shredded cheese. I've never had a burrito or enchilada because for me one beef taco, the generous amount of chips and salsa and a serving of beans always fills me up. Some people have complained about the price but a hard taco with cheese ($2.70) to me is reasonable, about the same as one carne asada or chicken taco from Baja Fresh. I go to Tito's only a few times a year because of the lines and calories, but I look forward to my infrequent trips.

I am a fan because I grew up on this place. More importantly, although its not the best mexican food, it has a signature to it - their salsa is a bit watery - but thats their style. Their chips are greasy - again, That's their style. The cheese and fried tacos that are always so crunchy and yummy ( if you like fried tacos) and greasy again! Their burrittos are yummi. We grew up on the all meat ones until I grew up and realized you can add to your burrito. Historical Mexican Place in Culver City. LOOONG LIIINES, but it moves quick.

Delicious. I love Tito's tacos, and you'll love Tito's too. It may not be the best taco in LA since there is some steep competition out there, but it is a damn tasty taco. Tito's deep fries their entire taco just  the right amount so that the shell is crunchy yet chewy and the meat is oily yet savory. It is a beautiful thing to see a tray of Tito's tacos, and it is a sad thing to see a box full of only Tito's chips. If you go to Tito's make sure to order cheese with your taco, it costs extra but it's worth it. Tito's is busy all day and all night, so expect to wait in line no matter what time you go there. Yes, I said no matter what time you go, even the wee hours of the morning. Also don't be silly, order the tacos. Don't bother with the burritos. It's Tito's tacos, not Tito's burritos.

In tagalog (filipino language) "tito" means "uncle". And with that said, i really do consider Tito('s) Taco part of my family. haha. I go here maybe twice a year and each time i go i've never been disappointed. It doesn't matter what part of the day it is, there will be a line until closing. The beef taco and the beef burrito are my two favorites to order. The chips and salsa that it comes with is very filling and good.  There are places to eat inisde the restaurant, but you might have to wait a few minutes till you find a place to eat.  There is seating outside but you'll probablly end up sharing a bench with strangers. And I've never parked in the parking lot right next to tito's taco cause its all ways packed, but there are a lot of meters on the street where you can park that are close to the restaurant.  But if you want good mexican food and your in the area STOP BY THIS PLACE!!

Grew up going to this place with my mom and today when I go back when visiting LA, it's exactly the same as it was when I was a little kid.  I still crave it sometimes.  It's just very very basic.  Nothing fancy, not tons of ways to customize your food.  Just tacos, enchiladas, taquitos, tostadas, burritos, and a little more, served hot and fresh, and always mouth watering.  Always crowded, always long lines, but food is served up fast for sit down or take out.  Ahh, what I wouldn't do to get a Tito's in Nashville.

Crunchy tacos! Shredded beef! And best is freshly shredded cheddar cheese! Some people say's it's not worth the hype, and that there are better taco's within the area, but there's something about this. Maybe nostalgia to my early UCLA days. It's cheap though! Just get the tacos. Do stay away from guacamole, too much liquid. I agree that if you have to wait more than 15 minutes, it's not worth it. But it's an experience right?

I always drive by Tito's Tacos and see long lines. I was excited to try the food and bought enough for me and a few friends: meat burritos, tamales and guacamole and salsa with chips.  The guacamole looked like thick green, avocado water and had absolutely no taste. The salsa was thick pink, tomato water and had absolutely no taste. True Mexicans with a decent palate would choose Taco Bell over this place. I've had better food in a homeless clinic on Skid Row. Save your money and drive to King Taco or any of the other fabulous and inexpensive mexican eateries we have in SoCal.

Tito's may not be top notch, but their bean and cheese burrito is Mexican bliss. It oozes with fat and cholesterol and is in a word - delicious. It would be nice if they accepted credit cards, but as my meal is less than $5, shame on me if I don't have the cash for Tito's. There always seems to be a line, day or night, which should speak to the "quality" of this restaurant. There are plenty of Mexican take out joints and roach coaches; they must be doing something right to be so "in demand".

I don't understand what the big deal is. For a long time you get a crunchy taco (not authentic Mexican tacos on little tortilla bread) with some carnitas and a crap load of cheese on it and on top of it all it's dry and flavorless. The salsa is so watery and lacks any flavor or spices. The chips are extremely greasy and the burrito is smothered in a sauce to hide the fact that it's not good.  Parking is horrible and the lines are ridiculously long and seating is limited. Not worth ever coming here again where I can relatively the same type of tacos at Taco Bell.

Having just flown in from back east on an early morning flight, all I wanted was some greasy food.  So bf suggested Tito's Tacos so that I can get my Mexican fix after being almost a week with out it.  I ordered a chicken tamale and a taco.  Both were tasty and satiated my hunger.  But what I really love are their chips and salsa.

I love Tito's Tacos. There's one in Stanton California as well. it's always such a hard decision when I go to eat at Tito's or Jonnie's (they're next door to each other). It's got great greasy mexican food that tastes like it got flown in fresh from Mexico City. Very inexpensive. They make their own chips, which I think it always such a bonus and they have the best salsa I have put in my mouth in months. So good you can drink it. In fact, usually I do. In a big salsa drinking cup. So good.

Tito's Tacos has to be one of the best mexican take-out restaurants in LA.  I crave for their cheese tacos and enchiladas, and the food is fresh.  Besides the health issues and the greasiness of the food, it's freaken good.  Those tacos are great for breakfast too--just microwave them for half a minute.  It still tastes pretty good, unlike other fast foods that taste like crap after microwaving them.

They are quick, but the the taste level for me is a bit bland.  I did really enjoy the enchilada that I got and I enjoy their guacamole.  The bean and cheese burritos are lacking in flavor.  But you can feed a bunch of people, for not a lot of dough.  They get you in and out and they don't really mess up your order!

EW!!! What is the deal with this place?? Every time I drive by there's a huge line. It must be a nostalgia thing, because it isn't a food thing. The food is baaaaad. Went here with my man, who got the famous taco, I don't eat meat, so I got a cheese enchilada. My enchilada was like cheese soup with a tortilla somewhere in it and the taco... gross. It looked like the tacos you got in the elementary school cafeteria, but apparently doesn't taste as good. The cheese is that bright orange, thick shredded stuff, the shell was clearly not handmade. Don't believe the hype. Go next door to Cinco de Mayo. Its yum.

I remember my very first visit to Titos..and I was in love but that was almost 20 years ago. Over time the quality has gone down and so has the taste.  I still enjoy those tacos once in a while, definitely worth it if I'm in the area but I dont make special trips anymore.  The parking is the worst and they only accept cash, although they do have an atm in the fron but I personally do not like paying extra fees the atm charges and my bank too!

I won't go into to much details.. As I know everyone has they're own personal opinion of what "Real Tacos" are supposed to taste like .. but I will say, being born and raised in a city (LA) where Tacos can be found at any street corner.. I was REALLY disappointed today after trying Titos Tacos. I had heard friends (of different ethnicities) rave about this place .. and since I rarely go into the West side of LA.. I had never really made an initiative stop. So my husband and I wanted to try these "famous shredded beef tacos dorados" (Hard shell fried tacos) everyone talked about and we also had a beef burrito.. Not great. they're really bland, like.. I wanted to pull out all the meat and throw it back on the stove and add my own spices kind of bland.. the Burrito i will say was ok. Not the Best.. Certainly not even comparable to King Taco.. So, in my opinion.. Don't wast your time in Line.. the food really aint all that. Ps. Don't Waste your Money on the guacamole.. It sucks too!

I am a huge fan of mexican, hence a HUGE fan of Tito's.. this place has had such good tasting mexican food from day 1. Their burritos are what really get me going tho.. The people giving this spot a mediocre review probably have no idea that you need to order the burritos a certain way for them to be as bomb as possible, so heres the secret: bean & cheese burrito with meat SAUCE only. Parking is sometimes a pain on the downside but definitely worth it to me.

This is the kind of place you love if you think a greasy fast food meal is delicious. It seriously is not better than Taco Bell. The tacos are hard tacos with a dried-out, flavorless mystery meat, and some unflavored shredded plain lettuce - that's it. I got a bean & meat burrito with a whole lotta gooey mystery substance of a disturbing brown color oozing out. There were a few meat chunks in there that were very tender and nicely cooked, but overall the experience was of the "hate myself in the morning, and it wasn't even good" variety. I think they're probably just famous because they're famous. First and last visit ever.

I have an undying love for Titos and always will. As a kid I lived a block away and as poor kids we practically survived off of Titos. We would walk here from our house and stand in the 30 minute long line for 2 crispy tacos and that unbeatable salsa. Its so damn good you can drink it! There is no other place like Titos, it reminds me of a time when there were still drive-in movie theaters in Culver City and we hung out at Fox Hills Mall. I will always love Titos and I hope to keep coming here until I have my own kids and can stuff their faces full of greasy meat tacos too.

How can they have no chicken tacos?? They have chicken tamales...??? Is their food frozen and microwaved that they can't prepare chicken tacos? How can they have no chicken tacos?? I don't get it.

Just doesn't get any better than Titos Tacos!  Had my first taco here when I was 2 years old.  The tacos are the "go to" item here.  They just don't get any better. Very unique and unlike any other tacos you've ever tasted.  Anytime I go to LAX or surf the South Bay, a Titos stop is in order for sure!  Be prepared for the lines as they can get a bit long during peak hours, but are worth every minute.  Guac is unlike any others, but good too.  I would highly recommend Titos Tacos to anyone passing through Culver City. One of my favorites for 32 years now!

Stop... If you are coming for an authentic Mexican taqueria style taco (ala King Taco), that is not what you are going to get and you will be disappointed. This is a place not to be compared to your local taqueria. Tito's is a place where you will see just as many first generation Mexican's eating next to first generation Asians and 6th generation WASPs. What you will get is simple food that comes together to make a meal that together is better than any of it's individual parts. You will get a crispy fried taco (ala authentic Mexican taco Dorado) topped with cheddar cheese. Sure that is not authentic Mexican but it is incredibly tasty and less greasy than any other fried taco you can find. I can't fully explain the meat for the burrito's, but it is a form of chile Colorado. I agree that as much as I love the taco's and burrito's the enchilada's and tamale's are pretty greasy and I don't order them. There are two salsa's that are very simple. 1. red mild, made from blending fresh tomatoes, onions and some form of fresh or pickled chile. 2. spicier green salsa which i think is simply blended pickled jalapenos. My point, and I am sure the point of the other thousands of Tito's Fans is, do not compare to any other place. Judge Tito's by the enjoyment of the Taco's and Burritos. The ordering of food is much simpler now than in the past. After your first visit you will get it and order like a pro. Just wait in one of the lines, either inside or out. A friendly employee will take your order, you step away, they will make your order and you step back and give them your money. They will take your cash and bring it to the one cashier and bring you back your change. They provide chips and red salsa without asking. You can ask for green salsa if you want.

This is not exactly the healthiest fare around, but that's not why you go to Tito's. The tacos are very tasty and crunchy. When you need your fix of greazzy beer food, this is the spot.  The salsa is really good too.  With Tito's you either really like it or you hate it.  I have friends on both sides, but they all agree on it being great beer food.  I wouldn't eat it everyday, but I do need my Tito's fix every so often. TIP: Come early, cause the lines tend to be long, esp at lunch.

this was the worst mexican american food i've ever had! i love fried tacos but they just don't do it right. i think it's the kind of cheese and lack of flavor. it's been a long time or else i'd go into detail. LA needs jimboy's! they do it right!! for those who love mexican american and aren't looking for healthiest that is. wouldn't waste my money here i can wait and go to king taco since it's on my way to my grandpa's.

I kind of don't get what all the f'ing fuss is about, but then again every time I go I eat way more than I should because I have no self control.  Somehow their large container of grated cheese calls me back each time?!  Line outside sucks.  It's always faster if you walk your lazy ass 8 steps through the door.  Now, if only they served Tecate in a can with lime....

Nothing to write home about, the lines are what keep people coming back. I think the beef looks nasty, but it's a cheesy, salty delicious "taco". Go up to Campos on Venice for some steak tacos, but if you're just looking to fill your gut with grease this is your spot.

Tito's has one of the best tacos in Southern California.  And if you're from LA, you know that's saying something.  No matter what time of day I've gone, there is always a huge line.  They have like 5 things on their menu and they do them well (kind of like In-N-Out).  Their shells are fried to perfection, the taco meat is shredded beef that is perfectly marinated and fried.  The only improvements I would make would be to add sour cream & green onions . . . but maybe that would make it too TacoBell-esque.  They also make their own tortilla chips, guacamole and salsa which are excellent as well.   Just make sure you don't end up goign to the taco stand that is right next to Tito's.  That place serves not only tacos, but hamburgers, philly cheese steak, and if I bothered to look more closely I'd probably find that they have chinese food on the menu as well.  If you are standing in front of this stand (which will undoubtedly be deserted) turn around and you'll see the crowd lined up in front of the place you want to be.

Parking is terrible. Seating is terrible. There is almost always a long wait. Tamales are boring. Chips are sometimes good, sometimes stale or overcooked. Tacos are OK, but that is all. I prefer to drive to King Taco on Pico. The time is about the same when the parking and waiting are factored it, but the food is superb. I would give them one more star if I could get there, park, order, and sit down to eat. But that's all, just one more.

Definitely great place that hits the spot if you're craving late night food after the bar or club.  Let's just say it's not because it's just the food, but you definitely can't beat the price either.  When tacos are around 2 bucks, you can't go wrong right?  Also, it seems fresh and the shells are nice and crispy.  Don't order the enchiladas because they aren't as fresh and you can go elsewhere for tastier enchiladas.  Heard of Baja Cantina?  Votes are on the Tacos for sure!

This place was OK. It's like an assembly line for Mexican food. They process it super fast and it seems like everyone that works there can whip up a taco or burrito which makes it efficient.

Authentic? I don't really care. All I have to say is I love their greasy, deep fried, hard shell tacos. Do I come here for anything else? No. My standard order is 6 tacos with cheese and it comes with chips and salsa. It's not the best salsa, but magically goes with the tacos. I'd probably pick up a pack of tacos every time I drive by except it's thankfully cash only. I rarely carry cash. Who uses cash anymore?

Good tacos in terms of the meat inside, you can tell its actually real beef. That being said, I like options with my tacos: sour cream, etc., which they do not offer. Also, when I was there, they had run out of Chicken, but its an experience worth experiencing and the food is good enough.

I'm giving this a 5 star rating because of the burritos. Don't get fooled into buying the tacos (I guess Titos' Burritos name was taken?). The beef burrito is the key. Add cheese and you have a Chili Colorado wrapped in a flour tortilla. Eat these with caution though, as they will squirt out the sides if you do not suck the juice out as you bite. The tacos are OK, the lines kinda suck, but IMHO worth it.

After hearing all the hype that is Tito's Tacos, I finally got to try it about two years ago... to VERY UNDERWHELMING results.  Their menu has no variety, you could call it a Ford T type of menu.  You can get any taco you like, as long as it is a hard shell carnitas.  Which was horrible.  I thought it was just a one-time experience and decided to eat their again to come across the exact disgusting taste I encountered the first time.  Their "burritos" are a slap to the face to anybody who's tasted a burrito.   I do not understand the hype over these hugely overpriced tacos....

Not sure why people are so fascinated by Tito's.  It could be 40 degrees outside at 10pm and you'll see lines of people waiting to order tacos.  Been there a couple times and thought the tacos were ok, but not necessarily that flavorful.  They throw a lot of cheese in there (cheese is extra) and I'm afraid to know how many calories are in each bite.  Personally, I prefer Del Taco's macho tacos over Tito's.

To all of those who complain about the lack of authenticity of Titos - keep your opinions but get out of the line! Even if your friends drag you - step aside and let those who have a deep appreciation for those sticky picnic tables go ahead of you. I have lived in LA since I was born (recently, I've moved to San Francisco, and I miss Titos dearly). There is something about going to the Culver City Ice Rink and then stopping by Titos that holds a very special place in my heart. Add in an orange soda and that crushed ice, and I have become a nostalgic mess. It's one of those greasy, cheap, decently good places that becomes a guilty pleasure. I can't wait to fly home and stop in for my tacos add cheese fix.

Been going to Tito's since 1983. Just went again in Mar 2010 and it was as good as ever. Something about their Coke is unique... maybe it's the crunched up ice that they use. Salsa is good, taco's are good. IT's not gourmet, but it has this certain taste that brings you back forever.

Burritos: super yummy beef, stewed to perfection. Cheese enchiladas: pure heaven. $1.35 tacos?! YES please! So good. Home made taco shells and chips. Even the rice is awesome.

My wife introduced me to this place about five years ago. I get the same thing each time, and it is always made perfect. An all-meat burrito and two taco's with cheese. They give you free chips and salsa. My wife taught me that the secret is to eat the burrito like an open faced sandwich. Simply cut straight down the middle and dip your chips into the meat and sauce. Sounds weird but trust me you'll have the biggest smile on your face once you've tried it. Don''t come here expecting all kinds of fancy side items, huge menu of items, or massive amounts of garnishes. You get a simple, yet high quality item. I would compare Tito's to In-N-Out, a menu with a few items that have been gratefully mastered.

Tito's has been around forever & they are practically a Culver City landmark. I grew up in the Culver City area & have eaten at Tito's for as long as I can remember! It's nothing fancy... It's a taco shack. They have tacos, burritos, chips & salsa... a few other things like tamales and enchiladas. I don't remember what else because I always get the tacos. In any case, you stand in line. When you get to the front, you tell them what you want and then move off to the side... Don't pay yet. And then you listen for your order... Pay attention because they don't ask for your name. If you ordered 5 tacos with cheese and a beef burrito, then that's what they shout out the window. Then you go up, collect your box of food, pay (it's cash only, by the way. But there is an ATM right there, for your convenience) and be on your merry way. The tables are often packed so take it home... or eat in your car... or take it down to the beach & eat it there. The possibilities are endless. So like I said: Nothing fancy. Simple food. They've been doing it the same way forever so they must be doing something right because they're still there & popular as ever. Oh, and as an amusing side note -- I've already mentioned I've been going to Tito's since I was a kid. Apparently, my boyfriend (who grew up close to Culver City) had been going to Tito's for as long as he can remember too. When we first started dating, I casually mentioned Tito's Tacos one day. His eyes widened, amazed I even knew the place existed. (Because most don't unless they're familiar with the area) Realizing we were both Tito's veterans, we immediately drove from Santa Clarita to Culver City, got a box of tacos & went to Santa Monica where we sat on the beach, watched the sunset & chowed down. We're still together.

I'm not sure how to describe Tito's. I thought everyone loved it. I love it, but apparently some do not. It's a simple menu, food is consistently good every time. It's no frills, remember to ask for cheese on your tacos. It's the Apple Pan of tacos. And if you haven't eaten at the Apple Pan up on Pico, you're missing out.

I went b/c a few of my friends were raving about the place...boy was I disappointed!  The tacos were no good, especially given the wait.  The beef wasn't seasoned and dry; the cheese had no taste (it almost tasted artificial).  The salsa was decent, but it wasn't anything special.  I would not have been able to choke down those tacos without the heavy helping of salsa. It's been 5 hours since I had two tacos and it's still sitting my stomach like a lump.  YUCK! Save your money and time...go to King Taco or El Taurino.  If you want a crispy shell, try their sopes.

3 stars is perfect for this place, unless you have some sort of childhood memory here that is irreplaceable. I was forced to try the bean and cheese burrito, which was good, but average. The salsa is also good, but average. I ordered a chicken tamale, which was corny but good and I cant even remember what the other thing I got was.

Like the apple pan is to burgers, raes is to bisquits and gravy, well... tito's is to tacos. Long lines and cash only are part of the challenge, and parking is pretty limited.  Good things are worth fighting for. If you don't love it, then just don't come back...but for god's sakes, stop bitching!!  We don't need you in our lines.  Get yourself to Baja fresh already!!  I'll trek to titos any day of the week.  Grease, cheese, pureed salsa and root beer.  If you're a fan, you're in good company.

I contemplated giving it 2 stars but I decided against it. We love to try new places when we go to soccer or volleyball tourneys. I have heard about Tito's Tacos for years so today we decided to stop. Parking was a pain but figured it was worth the hassle by looking at the lines of people. We waited about 10 minutes in line. I finally get to the front and the woman taking my order was not pleasant or patient. I explained that we had never been there and wanted to know if they serve a different type of meat.....annoyed she answers"just beef". I order and when I tell her that's all she walks away without saying anything. I'm still standing there waiting to pay but she doesn't return. I finally realized that you pay when you get your food. The burritos are mediocre and the tacos are ok. The meat was dry on my first taco and I admit the second taco tasted  a little better. I can now say that I've been to Tito's Tacos but don't think I'll be coming back any time soon.

ok, the only & i mean the ONLY REASON tito's taco's get a 4 star is because of 2 things... 1st - they give you 1/2 dollars for change...!  so if you dont want a fi'ty cent piece, tell em you want 2 quarters back... 2nd - their line is very unorganized, hence, people cutting, which leads to violence... ok, now the food.  alot of these bad reviews are saying the food is this & the food is that.  bottom line is, it isnt a bourghsie (slang for bourgeoisie) establishment... if you're a poser & love that "i gotta wear my G-Star skinny jeans & greyhound bus size shades" atmosphere, check out my mexicali review... back to Tito's - simple & good, best comfort food around.  they have a guacamole sauce that when mixed with the salsa is hella bomb...!  which when you go, you will see peple ordering just chips & salsa with the guacamole...!  i aint lyin...! yeah i know, you're gonna tell me that real mexican tacos dont have lettuce & a hard shell, i know that, but so...? & think about it, if the place sucks, as these elite reviewers have written, why in the hell is it always packed, as they've written too...?   i'll tell you why...  Tito's is, dare i say "landmark"...?  when you go there, you will see every ethnicity of people there in line & do you know why...?  you have generations of families eating here.  a kids grandparents ate there, their parents ate there, now they're eating there & soon their kids will be eating there as well...! like ive said before in my profile, all i do is eat & if the establishment sucks, i'll say it sucks...!  if you read my other reviews, even though im not an "elitest", im also not a poser, that thinks if someone thinks rooster testicles taste good, im still not gonna try it..!   so like i always said, reviews are good, but ya still gotta jump in feet first yourself...! eat well my frenz...

I went here because I was nearby.  Very good hard tacos.  I was raised on hard tacos over soft tacos.  Soft tacos were mainly taco-cart tacos. I liked the corn they used and the cheese was actually good cheese. I liked the tacos very much, but I think the hype over this place is because it is in the Westside, where very few tacos compete with this place.  There is no taco worth a wait in line of more than five minutes.  I am glad I tried them.  Good experience. Try venturing more toward the Eastside and you may find many more taco stands worth your while. The tamale was very sad.  Almost all masa (dough).  For me, that is the cardinal sin in tamale making. The masa was good masa, but it was an impostor as a beef tamale.  I was raised on pork tamales, so I will always be biased in my tamale reviews. Remember, tamales are like women. There are no bad tamales (ugly women), just some better (prettier) than others!   Will Rogers said it best, "I never met a tamale I didn't like." At least I thought he did.  Or was that was my neighbor, Guillermo Rojelio.

I have decided to update my review on this place for a couple of reasons. One I went back there a few days ago and discovered that they do not serve fish tacos. Since I quit eating meat a couple of years back I don't enjoy taco's as much as I use to, so I make up for it by trying out fish tacos. They don't serve them there boo.  When I asked the lady about fish tacos she looked at me like I was crazy, which annoyed me, because clearly the only crazy there was her eyeliner that winged out to her earlobe and Tito himself for not serving fish fricken tacos. I went next door and got a couple of tacos there, which I will review later.  The 2nd reason I wanted to update my review was to confirm that they still have the best salsa in town. Definitely freshly made, with the exact amount of heat, and such a lovely sweet red to the sauce. I love thinner based salsa's that are not super chunky and they really hit the nail on the head with their recipe. So in the end, although you do not serve fish tacos which is a huge disappointment in case you haven't figured it out, your salsa still rocks the house.

It's the burritos that are memorable folks.  I find the tacos are very good, but the real reason to go (and to struggle for parking and wait in the long  lines) is the burritos.  The meat in the burritos is well cooked and the sauce is memorable.  It's unfortunate that the name implies it's the tacos that are particularly special. I really do wish that they'd find a way to accommodate the crowds.  I'd go more often.  But on a late night coming back hungry from LAX, nothing can beat it.

Tito's is one of those places that if you grew up eating there it's amazing; total comfort food.  However, if you try it for the first time as an adult you might be disappointed.  Personally I love it and I think they have the best salsa ever...seriously I could drink it straight, it's that good.

The place is pretty cheap... thats about the only good thing I can say about it.  The place is always busy so expect to wait in line, they only accept cash, the tacos are barely better than Del Taco and parking can be a problem.  But if you really have to go here then I would recommend the All-Meat Burrito as it is pretty juicy and has a ton of sauce (I think its pretty much chile colorado) but not alot of flavor in my opinion.

I went here twice already and both experiences were fun. I would say this place is more of a landmark taco staple rather than a place where you want to get the best tacos in Los Angeles. The menu may be small, but it's pretty good. If you're unsure about what to get, go with the tacos (a must have) and the tamales. Overall, it's good and cheap, a LA must have!

I'be been eating here for 37yrs, Even in my earliest childhood memories I recall the family taking a trip out to Culver City just to eat Tito's. Now I take my own children and every few months we do a "Tito's Run" since it is not local to us. But no matter for us Tito's Tacos with their Guacamole sause is just the BEST... As the fraise goes from some burger joint, "If it doesn't get all over the place it doesn't belong in your face". The same way goes for Titos tacos with their salsa and guacamole dripping onto the paper holders as one finishes the taco you suck up the juices... Damb now I'm in the mood for Titos so I guess I'll just have to make a Titos run tonight.

Titos is one of my favorite places, so much so, that I travel the 33 miles from my house once a week to have their tacos! My husband loves their burritos and always asks for a bean and cheese burrito with meat sauce! it you want something more hearty then just ask for it with meat! For me the tacos are the best because the combination of the tacos, chips and salsa is the greatest and will always keep me coming back for more! everyone I know that lives around titos tacos loves it as much as I do! What is in a Tito's taco? shredded beef, lettuce, cheese (extra), in a hard tortilla shell...Now smother the taco with the salsa and that is the best! Oh one more thing titos always has a line so regardless of what other people might say about it they always have lots of people there!

I have loved Titos for years, and here's why:  tacos with cheese, bean and rice burritos, sides of beans and rice, enchilada, and meat, bean and rice burritos, chips & salsa, and very friendly people.  Here's what you have to put up with for Titos:  long lines, rude people who once they place their order do NOT move aside or step back (please, it takes 3-6 minutes for your food to be prepared so step aside), tough parking at peak times.  I don't care for the runny guacamole and the tostadas are not very flavorful.  Tips:  go at 10-10:15am when they open and it's all yours; park +1 block away at peak times; the inside line is often less crazy; get all of your food "to go" as it's easier to handle; and order a "large" soda as the small/medium are tiny and they are all loaded with ice.  PS-the bean/rice burritos freeze beautifully.  Enjoy!  Steven

I came here with a friend who raved about this place and how fantastic the tacos were... well... I was quite disappointed to bite into a taco that lacked any flavor whatsoever. My friend suggested I eat it with their amazing salsa. Another fail. The salsa is not very flavorful either. Del Taco tacos are better than Tito's Tacos. Why there are always tons of people waiting on line for this when the Del Taco drive-thru only takes 5 minutes is beyond me.

The fact that the overall rating for Tito's Tacos is only 3 stars is absolutely absurd.  Yes, the tacos are greasy...that's what makes them so good!  I usually order two tacos with cheese and a side of rice, but practically everything I've tried there has been delicious.  To be fair, the guacamole is less than ideal; it is soupy as opposed to chunky.  The only other downside I can think of is that parking can be a pain sometimes...but it is totally worth it.  I have lived in Southern California my entire life and Tito's continues to be one of my favorites.

I first tried this place about ten years ago and instantly liked it. I have some friends that have been eating there even longer & love it. The food is not top of the line but it's decent, and for the amount of food you get for what you pay I can't complain. Every now & then I crave their tacos, not many places serve it the same way. The tostada is the size of the paper plate (friggin awesome). Even though the burrito looks small it's actually quite filling. I don't mind the 20-30 min drive just to eat there.

Run, do not walk, to Tito's.   I am stunned and offended that this Los Angeles landmark has fewer than a four star rating.  It deserves five stars on the strength of the tacos, which are absolutely delicious combinations of succulent and flavorful shredded beef, crisp shredded lettuce for texture, and healthy portions of shredded cheese, in a hard tortilla shell, all of which is best enjoyed when dunked into the vat of thin salsa that comes with every order (along with a huge bag of delicious, thick tortilla chips.  Even if nothing else were on the menu, this would be a strong 5-star establishment that is a must for people who live in or visit L.A.   There are a few complaints I have heard, but it's tough to argue with the overall package.  The staff has yet to master the assembly line style of production, so it takes a few minutes to get your food, but the ambience still remains special.  Picnic benches outside that invite communal atmosphere are the perfect symbol of the unifying power of this place.  The other "problem" is that some items on the menu aren't good, most notably the guacamole.  It just isn't good, very thin and more a paste than anything, so just don't order it.  The burritos are unlike many you may have tried before, but they are simple and delicious if that's what you are in the mood for.  Having grown up in L.A., its the first place I take any visitor and rarely is there any disappointment.  Come for the tacos and stay for the charm.  If you are fortunate to need 50 cents in change, you'll leave with a 50 cent piece for your memories.

I have no idea what the hype of this place is all about. Parking is pretty dang bad. Took about 15 minutes to find parking. The lines was pretty long to order your food. Mainly because right after you order the lady who takes your order also prepares your food. There is no one in the back so it takes FOREVER. They need to just have someone in the back to make the food so the lines moves along smoothly. They don't have much to choose from just tacos, burritos, and a couple other things. They don't have much meats to choose from either. I think they only have beef. No chicken taco's or burritos. The sauce sucks here too, so its hard to enjoy your taco's and burritos w/o having any good condiments. The price is around 12 bucks for each person to get filled up. I don't really think the food was all that good and most likely won't return here again. I would prefer del taco over this place any day.

The tacos here are only so-so. Not great. The cheese is not the finely grated variety, which I'm not a fan of, although some might be. The meat burrito is where it's at. You don't just drop the kids off at the pool. You MAKE a brown pool after eating one of these. This gastronomic experience means they're doing it right.

I've been going to Tito's for over 30 years.  I love it!  If you don't mind the lack of parking and long lines, then it's as good as it gets when it comes to tasty, cheap food.  Tacos and beef burritos are my favorites.  Be sure to bring cash and an empty stomach!

The only thing better than a Tito's taco.. Is two.    I saw this commercial, and thought it was so cheesy, that I had to give it a try. I was not disappointed. The shredded beef tacos, and bean and cheese burritos are terrific. Best I've had. The only reason I give it four stars is the awful salsa. I have to carry hot sauce in my car if I know I'm stopping here. Their salsa is so bland. Just chopped tomato as far as I can tell. How about some hot sauce packets?

My nieces and nephews LOVE Titos' so I really wanted to go crazy over it.  I didn't.  The hard shell tacos seem on a par with Taco Bell.  The long lines and atmosphere are nice to experience once but the food doesn't live up to it.  However, the other patrons and workers are all great.  It's a fun place to hang so the 3 star rating.  But remember, it's meant to be FAST food.  Standing in line for 10 minutes to place your order doesn't qualify, IMO.

Recently, the lines seem to be much shorter than in the past...not sure why, but I get my food faster now.  The way they set up their assembly line never made sense to me. The person putting your food together also handles the money, so they have to change gloves with every customer. And they all run around getting in each others way. In any case, while the tacos are good, I find the shell to be too crunchy, so that I can never eat more than 1 taco without my jaw aching. So, I always pair it with a half a burrito. I think I enjoy the burritos more. The enchiladas and tamales are ok, but not great. I'm not a fan of their guacamole. I always get extra salsa.  The parking lot surprisingly has a very fast turnover so you typically don't have to wait long for a spot to open up.

I loooove Tito's. It hasn't changed one bit since I was in high school. Always great, pretty quick once you get to the front of the line and the ladies at the counter are always nice regardless of how crowded it gets. I have stopped here at 10 am on the way out of town and there are lines! If you didn't like it the first time, try it once more and you'll be hooked. That's what happened to me. Bean and cheese burrito, taco, chips and salsa. Doesn't get better than that.

Titos Tacos is one of my favorite spots to eat in LA. Its hard to describe, but i guess you can say its a "ghetto taco spot". Its not your typical mexican food, its a bit white washed, but in a damn good way. People come here for THE TACOS, PERIOD. And when I say the people, i mean you can find every race, religion, sexuality,business attire, beach clothed etc in the world, seriously. I guess food brings everybody together here. The salsa they give you is freakin awesome and compliments the tacos perfectly. It does get extremely crowded here on the weekends, so i usually come here on Monday which is my day off, and its pretty empty. If you come on the weekend, be prepered to eat in your car,as more than likely you wont find a table. My dad's been bringing me here since i could remember, and i will surely carry the tradition along. And forget the location, the hassle finding a parking spot and the long lines because once you take a bite of that DELICIOUS taco, itll all be worth it.

The best taco's in town, but there's really not much else if that's not your thing.  Cheese and salsa makes them a treat, but wish they offered chicken meat taco's like their old Cypress, CA location did.  Chips are hard and heavy with lot's of oil, but salsa is good (but always seems to taste a little too much of pepper)...

I think the people who go there with expectations hate it and the people without high expectations love it. The tacos are good but not the best you will ever have. They are greasy but are tasty. The long lines actually move fast. There is no ryhme or reason to the lines...there's no order to them but they somehow seem to work. The chips are extra crunchy and the salsa isn't spectacular...kinda plain but it's all preference. I agree with the comment about the overweight people in line....Everyone is overweight and sad. I guess I am not the only one who noticed. Don't forget your cash...cash only.

I heart Tito's. I've grown up in the CC most of my life, back in the days when Tito's was the only thing we could brag about. (No Ford's, Akasha, Fraiche, Father's Office, etc.) I don't go as often as I used to, but certain days it's the only thing that hits the spot. In no way is it meant or represented to be "autentico", but s&*%, there really aren't many places that are. I love their salsa, and I always order an XL with an extra order of chips. I've never been a huge fan of their burritos, so I stick to the tacos and/or tamales. In all these years their prices have only risen marginally, God Bless Them for that. There's a reason there are always lines in front of this place. If you're expecting cute dainty little tacos with sumptuous fillings, you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for a little honest-to-goodness heart stopping action for a decent price, this is your place. I grew up on this stuff. I know it's not gourmet. I know it's greasy. But it's a part of my upbringing. I heart Tito's.

Tito's Tacos is the cynical touristy choice of mexican food. What is sad about mexican cuisine in Los Angeles is that there is an idea out here that there has to be some sort of bad gimmick involved to make up for the lack of taste. Some restaurants market themselves on size. Well Tito's Tacos markets themselves on something more cynical: Cheapness. You may wonder why the lines are so long for this place. It caters to the typical east-coast tourist expectations of mexican food similar to many taco shops in Cancun: It must be cheap and not have any bold or spicy flavors. The food here is just bland. The tacos they sell can easily be made at home with have packet of rosarita taco shells and seasoning from your local grocer. Yes, it's that bad. Stay away from this place. Instead, walk down to Johnnie's Pastrami next door. There is usually no wait and the food is great.

I guess if you're a person whose taste buds are best suited for bland flavorless junk food, who enjoys no spice, runny salsa, a really really long wait, who want people who take your order that can't even deal with the easiest tasks and love a dirty eating area, this is the place for you.

If you have grown up on the westside than there is something wrong with you if you have never heard of or been to Tito's. I admit to a new comer it might not be the best tasting food on the planet. But i have been going here for decades and it is like comfort food to me. I just stick with the crispy beef tacos which are giant, and full of cheese and lettuce. I smother it is salsa and guac and put a little bit of the green spicy chilies on top. The chips are good too. If you don't mind a really long line and your food in a paper box than try this place.

Simply the best tacos in L.A.  Don't bother with the burritos, tamales, etc...they're all mediocre.  Stick to what made it a landmark-- the tacos.  It's true that the ordering/payment system is terribly inefficient and almost mind-boggling, but it's all part of the fantastic Tito's experience.  Just go knowing you need to pay cash, that there will be a long line, and that it'll all be worth it.

They SWORE by this place. It was so packed with no seats, so we had to eat in the car and take it to go. The to go tacos came in a box. Okay the box looked like a dozen of donuts box but inside lay a dozen tacos! Loaded with cheddar cheese and shredded beef cooked to perfection. The salsa was tasty and had a bite to it.

Tito's Tacos is a place that really grows on you. The first time I had it I remember thinking what is all the hype around this place. But then after awhile, both my fiancé and I started craving those little crunchy beef tacos, the super fresh salsa (you have to mix in the minced jalapenos) and the bit sweeter than normal Pepsi. I always get the same thing two tacos that come with complimentary chips and salsa. I have tried the other items on the menu (burrito, rice, beans and tamales) and none of them are very good. Overall, great beef crunchy tacos at a fair price.

Titos USED to be a fair priced place for basic Mexican food. I was a patron from 1960 ( when they were on Sepulveda) and no longer go there. For the amount of business they have, their prices are more than El Abajeno a few miles away. The burritos are smaller than before, and they could expanded their menu to include things like Nachos, and quesdillas.  Sadly, they got so bigheaded they forgot about who made them who they are: There customers. Titos is overhyped

im new to Los Angeles and have been looking for a good taco place. I saw the commercial on TV and had to try it. I arrived to see long lines and thought this is a good place. When I got my food, the tacos were good, but I loved the amount of chips and salsa that they give you. I also liked the avocado sauce, I wouldn't call it guacamole, because it's not chunky but more of a sauce. I liked this sauce very much. I will have to go back and try a burrito.

BARF!!!! I wish I could give this place half a star! I've lived in LA for 10 years and have always heard about how great this place is. I've also always been a fan of their cute kitschy commercials and catchy theme song... and that is where my being a fan of Tito's stops. What is all the hype about? The Salsa is bland and tastes like nothing but pureed tomato and onion, where's the heat? Where's the depth of flavor? As for the tacos themselves, 0 flavor!! None! The only saving grace is that since the tacos taste pretty much like cardboard with soggy salty mush the cheddar cheese really stands out, which I am a big fan of on beef tacos. Do yourself a favor NEVER EAT here! Avoid the lines and hit up one of the better taco spots in West LA. Tacomiendo isn't that far away and is WAY better same with El Super Taco.

Great Shredded Beef tacos! My family is obsessed with this place, and any time they are even in the LA area they gotta stop for some tacos. We have learned over the years to stick to the tried and true and only get the tacos. The rest of the menu is average at best. Their salsa and guacamole are different than most, but tasty. The lines can get insanely long here, but every once in a while its worth the wait.

Rest assured no matter what time you are going there will be a line outside and inside. I will say tito's used to be a five star for me, but like many Los Angeles mainstays, they have increased prices and decreased portions. Still affordable and very tastey but it always bothers me when my burrito gets smaller and smaller.

Tito's Taco's what can I say...It's been an institution here in Los Angeles for as long as I can remember. I've lived all over the southbay and have had taco's all over the world but Tito's always keeps me coming back for more. There famous for the taco's but what you really want to get is the Meat, Bean and Cheese Burrito, it's unbelievable!!! It's true parking can be difficult to find and the lines are a bit annoying but once that first bite of burrito with a little guacamole and salsa goes down the hatch I know whatever inconvenience I went through was well worth it.

Not sure why this place has so much cache.  The Tacos are mediocre and everything else I've had was less so.  Salsa is bland.  Pretty much Mexican every other joint in the area can offer as much. Skip this place and go to El Polo Loco.

Simple and cheap tacos and burritos. Deep fried tortillas with shredded beef and cheese is the staple and its just OK. Salsa has little flavor and needs something more to it since they give you so much of it. There are better taco stands in la but none get more famous

OK, I admit it.  All these years I'd walked around not  particularly liking Tito's based on the first time I ever went there (2000 maybe?).  I love Mexican food and I'm a little bit of a snob but, come on, you've got to understand what you're coming here for.  Simple menu, simple food, hard-shell tacos (usually not on my menu).  It's good.  What can I say?  It's got a ton of flavor.  I advise everyone to buy a tamale just to get the sauce that comes with it.  I could drink that stuff by the gallon.  This is like the Westside's answer to Pink's.  Take that however you want to.  Just understand that I like Pink's and that you'll have to stand in a crazy long line at either place.  Also, Tito's is decently cheap.  The prices might seem higher than what you're used to at "more authentic" stands but you'll get a good deal for your cash

I got a burrito. Meat and cheese. It quickly became a pile of mush. Tasty mush, yes, but it wasn't  much better than taco bell, though more expensive. The tortilla was of high quality. But there wasn't much more than that--meat and cheese. Texture was lacking some. Fun place, I guess. Next time I'll get the tacos the commercial lauds. I'm sure I'll have a better experience.

I don't know what the hype is all about. I only went to this place upon my friend's insistence. I saw the long line and thought there might be something to this. Neither the food nor the price lived up to the hype. According to my friend, Paco, the beef in the taco was dry and my Chicken Chimichanga was not at all appetizing. Thank God I can do math because my server could not. My food amounted to $12 and change. She charged me $22 and change. Kids, this is why we tell you to stay in school. Yes, even you Paco.

Like most others say, not a place to drive to just for tacos. But, if like me, you are close- this place is a cheap tasty treat.   Tamale was ok- generous chunks of chicken but heavy on the masa.  cheese enchilada- same. generous sauce & cheese but 1 too many wraps w/the tortilla.   Tacos & salsa were my favorites.  Only 1 type of meat: shredded beef. The In-n-Out of Mexican. Simple, fast food, cheap.

Five stars for the food.  I love everything about it.  Clean, simple, cheap, salty. They also give you a ton of chips and the guacamole is amazing. Minus one star for the parking and the long line that's usually there.  The interior seating also sucks, but, thankfully, I only go here for take-out. I'm surprised that so many people seem to hate this place.  It's some of the best around, especially for the price.  And I'm so tired of people complaining about food not being 'authentic'.  If you want authentic, go to Mexico.   This is an authentic taco dive in Culver City, and it's damn good!

This place was amazing! Although there was no parking in the lot, we found a spot right in front on the street. You can park there for 2 hours with the meter, worked out perfect.. There was a little bit of a line, but the inside was open also, so we ordered in there. I got the all meat (beef) burrito with rice and cheese and my boyfriend got 3 beef tacos with cheese, I got a Strawberry soda and he got an Orange soda. The only reason I really gave it 4 out of 5 is because they don't have Horchata there :( It was beautiful outside so we just ate out front on the benches. I will def. be coming back here everytime I come back to Cali.

I'm a big fan of hard-shell tacos so this is definitely my go-to place. Not too greasy, perfect amount of meat, lettuce and cheese. The shell is not too hard but hard enough for the taco to not fall apart. The salsa is not chunky (which i like) and they have this jalapeno salsa (not sure what it's called) that is sooo good. i was never a big fan of burritos in general but their burrito hits the spot every time! Beware of long lines!

If you live in the 90230/90232 area you've probably seen their commercial at least once.  It still makes me smile and sing along  every time I see it. If you're looking for authentic "traditional" Mexican food, this probably isn't the place for you.  If your looking for delicious, unique Mexican food though, Tito's will hit the spot.   I've been coming here since I was a little kid.  To me, Tito's Tacos is one of a kind.  My favorite burrito in the world is made at this joint.  I usually only like authentic Mexican food and maybe if I hadn't grown up eating at Tito's I would feel differently but I love their shredded beef and their special sauce. Their hard shelled tacos with orange shredded cheese on top is also great.  I also love their salsa and chips. If you come at peak lunch/dinner hours or on a weekend day, be sure to have a few extra minutes on your hands, cause you're gonna have to wait!

Tito's is perfect for that hard-shell taco style of mexican food. Go inside for slightly faster service, don't forget to add cheese to your taco, ask for jalapenos and get the food to go (in the box) even if you're eating there. We get the tacos, burritos and tamales, the other items aren't very interesting. They give you chips and salsa for free - the salsa's not spicy which is why you need to add the jalapenos.  Last tip - only order from a woman, the guys aren't very good at putting your food together, it's always smaller.

A place with so much buzz should have great food.  First, you get hard shell tacos... automatic disqualification from Mexican food.  Second, the tacos are saturated in grated cheddar, and third, it's shredded beef.  I honestly enjoy Taco Bell's Double Deckers more than the tacos at this joint.

This place is my regular comfort food location. The place has always a huge line, and is always consistent in terms of taste. I always eat the same thing: two tito's tacos with cheese I did try the other stuff, never impressed, but the hard shelled tacos are very different than what you would get as a default taco in Los Angeles from taco trucks, etc., I approach it as I would approach "big mac", it is a burger, yet a unique taste that whether you like it or not is always the same wherever in the world you eat it. Tito's Tacos are always consistent with that unique taste. Some may not like it, but I love it. The beef is usually on the dry side and they use the bright orange cheese with it, and the shells are always crunchy (if you are taking home, best if you live very close or you drive very fast, time is not a friend) or safest, just make sure to eat it quickly on site. Even though their guacamole is a bit on the watery side to my taste, it is also a very very natural and pleasant taste and is always consistent in its taste. Same goes for the salsa, very plain taste, but very nice and refreshing. Tito's Tacos is one of those places that you don't want to change at all!

You either get it or you don't.  Stop trying to analyze what makes Tito's what it is.  For all the nay-sayers, stop hating.  I have been going to Tito's since I was a kid and the tacos have always been solid (shredded beef, instead of ground beef -- hard shell, quality cheddar cheese and a lot of it) and awesome salsa!  Yes, not uber-authentic, but inexpensive and a place where the customers obviously keep coming back. On a recent trip, yes...the wait was a little longer than usual, but people in line were friendly and reminiscing on how Tito's has always been a good local place.  Tried the beef and bean burrito and was pleasantly surprised (yes, all the years I have been coming here, I have never tried the burritos).  Nothing fancy, but simple pinto beans and more of that great shredded beef, some enchilada sauce and cheese...nothing more.  Me and the wife sat down at one of the benches and had a great dinner conversation with some other customers. Made for a nice night... Quick tip -- ask of some jalapenos and put it in the salsa -- kicks it up a notch, as the salsa is mild, yet tasty (a tomato, tamatillo blend, not chunky, but oh so addicting).

If you order a combo burrito you will get very little meat nowadays, not like before. Also, they skimp you on the salsa so you have to buy more and it's not a nominal charge either, it's almost $4.00 for their large, which is not that large. A taco at taco bell or del taco or most other places is taco meat, lettuce and cheese. At Tito's you have to pay like an extra $.50 cents more if you want cheese, so just meat and lettuce?  ... Really? I don't mind paying for the cheese but hate it when I see someone loading mounds of cheese for another customer while my server sprinkles my cheese onto my food lol!!!!   No longer consistent!  Still good though!

Okay, so the lines are long. The way you order and get your food is pretty inefficient, and OK the people who take your order are usually looking at you with the are-you-done-yet look. But the tacos are so GOOD! The burritos are delicious, and the guacamole is always fresh.  I know a lot of people aren't fans, and perhaps its an acquired taste for this type of Mexican food, but if you have a chanced, you must go!

Love the Tacos!  What else can you say about a place that always has a line no matter time of day.  And the prices right too.   If you decide to eat there, you need a tag team process - one person orders while other person claims a space/table.  Also, parking is not always available so street parking is encouraged Enjoy:)

The salsa and the tacos are really good.  I have to get at least four everytime I go.  The only thing that sucks is that they used to have bigger containers for their salsa and they downgraded a couple of years ago so you have to pay if you want more salsa.  Also make sure you have cash when you go or else you have to pay the dreaded ATM fee at their ATM.

We moved to LA, living in Culver City, and passed by Tito's Tacos on a daily basis.  Everytime we passed by there was always a line spilling out into the streets!  No matter what time we drove by there was always a mob of people waiting to order. After seeing this for a couple weeks we decided we HAD to try this place. Parking is horrible, so we parked a few blocks away and walked, and then went to go stand in the line.  While we were standing there, this boy next to us told us how great everything is, so 30 minutes later when we finally got to the front of the line we couldn't wait to order. We were so excited to finally get our food and try it out.  It was so disappointing.  Very bland, not very good at all, and definitely not worth all the effort.  Maybe we just didn't order the right thing...I've thought about going back to give it one more try, but I just can't bring myself to do it.

My biggest complaint with Tito's is the price.  I think it used to be a cheap place to eat, but not anymore.  They charge 50 cents extra to put cheese on a taco--who doesn't want cheese on their tacos? By the time you add in the overpriced drink it really is not a cheap taco meal, and really if all you are ordering is a few tacos and a drink it should be a really cheap meal. The food tastes good, although not great, and I can understand why people are fans of the food, especially of the salsa.  I would be a bigger fan if you got more for your money.

I love this place! It's the best Mexican Restaurant I have gone to and never get bored of it! Great Food!!!! My favorite is their Burritos and Tacos. Their salsa, guacamole and their fried beans and cheese are awesome. It's not a fancy restaurant...but if you ask me as long as there is a place to sit and great food..what more do you want. I got to be honest, I have been going to this place for 26 years and it never gets old. The only thing I have to say is that their Burritos have gotten a bit smaller, but nevertheless, they are still the best Burritos. Anytime I am on the 405 freeway...Titos Tacos here I come! This place is soo good, there's always lines..from the time it opens to the time it closes. A few suggestions before going....take plenty of cash because that's all they take, have a little patience because their line structure is a bit different than you may be custom too and have someone with you so they can scout any empty tables, if there's any. Other, than that have a great time, enjoying the tacos and Burritos with their salsa and guacamole. Future hopes, for this place is to finally accept credit cards, do something about their parking.

So overrated. I think the majority of people that come here and write glowing reviews have never had good authentic Mexican food. I've only had the tacos, and hell, when it's part of your name and they aren't very good...well, i'm not too inclined to try anything else. And cash only...on the westside? Really?

I love TIto's. My dad has been taking me here since '92 and he has been coming here since the 70's.  Nothing has changed and that's what makes it so special. One of a kind. Don't compare this place to Taco Bell. It makes you look like a total moron who has no credibility. Absolutely nothing like Taco Bell. Quite frankly its nothing like anything else out there. Simple menu, great tacos, quick and easy. Waiting in line outside makes it the most authentic California-style taco stand! Plus how can you argue with the fact that they've been in business for like 65+ years and NOTHING HAS CHANGED! don't be fooled by cynical people who are looking for a gourmet restaurant and  Tito's didn't meet their requirements. Tito's is all-LA all day, with a line longer than In-N-Out so you know its good.

Titos used to be a great place but something had gone wrong along the line besides the line.  I guess after all the years of supporting them I feel like they have cheated all their original customers.  Down grade in burrito size, higher prices, longer lines, and what the hell still can not accept Credit Cards!!  They dont even cook the food there!!

This is pretty much a love it or hate it place. I'm firmly in the second group. You can get a taco for $1-2 at any taco truck in town - and it'll be better than a taco from Tito's. Probably a lot better. At Tito's you have your choice of beef, or beef. No pork, no chicken. If you opt for enchiladas your meal will be covered in a sauce that tastes exactly like Chef Boyardee spaghetti sauce. Exactly. On top of this will be a blob of day-glo orange cheese oozing out grease like an unclean wound. The chips are stale and flavorless. The salsa is bland. How can this be authentic? It's as if they hired the lunch lady, Mrs. Shulman, from my grade school in Spokane to cook for them. There are a million great Mexican restaurants in LA. Even in West LA. To find a Mexican restaurant better than Tito's just open the phone book to any page and call the first business on the list. Doesn't matter if you landed on Ken's Vacuum Repair. Call Ken and ask him to make you a taco. It will be better Tito's.

UPGRADE YOUR SALSA SIZE.  The number of items you order determines the size of the salsa you are gonna get.  Its never enough, especially since your gonna get some chips as well. I love the salsa.  Even if you don't love it, trust me it pairs perfectly with the crunchy tacos and chips and you're gonna need more of it.  Its a really cheap upgrade. The hardest thing may be getting the order taker to understand what your asking. If it is your first time going here you need to be ordering the tacos.  This restaurant does have menu limitations and shortfalls. If they bother to put Tacos in the restaurants name then you should take that as a strong ordering recommendation.   The cheese is kind of surprisingly pricey. I want to say you save 40 or 50 cents without it. Dont be that cheap. You want it.  Although, on one occasion, I fed a party with their tacos and saved about 20 dollars with Tillamook.

our friend's nickname is tito (short for putito, and please don't look this word up), and even he hates this place.  if you insist on experiencing this place though, get there before 10:30am.  then you might give 1 star for their less than mediocre tacos and 1 star for not hassling over parking, long lines and burned out employees.

I've been going to Tito's since I was a little chubby kid. Fortunately I did not eat it every day else I'd be obese. Tito's has remained the same and still serves the same great tasting food it's been serving for all these years. I rarely stray away from the tacos with cheese topped with chopped jalapeno's and salsa. The been and cheese burrito is also very good. Any time I'm in the area I have to make a stop. The wait in line is worth the wait.

So a friend told me that we HAD to try Tito's Taco's and we were invited to do so on a Friday night. I appreciated the ample parking and the line wasn't really long, we waited less than 5 minutes. I was super excited to try these infamous taco's but was severely disappointed. What is the attraction! they were plain, flavorless and boring, they tasted like the tacos my mom made when I was a kid. Yes, they are cheap, but you could make the same thing for the same price at home! even the salsa was disgusting, seriously it's pureed tomato liquid with this weird foam on the top, nasty! I also tried the gaucamole which must be prepared the same way as the salsa as it is basically straight avacado in liquid form. The bean and beef burrito's I found to be slightly better than the taco's but still not worth returning for. I just don't get it, my friends really love Tito's, maybe I've become too much of a foodie, (damn you yelp!) but I like real Mexican food, with flavor!

Tito's Tacos is the most polarizing Mexican restaurant ever.  You either love it or hate it.  It is the Barry Bonds of Mexican food.  You can put me on the hater side.  When I first moved to LA is asked around to determine what the best Mexican place was.  People said "you have to go to Tito's".  I had it and it was the most disappointing feeling ever.  I don't know what the hype is all about.  One of life's mysteries.

This may very well be the best kept insider secret in all of America's restaurantdom.  The prices are waaay low, the lines are waaay long, and the food is waaay good.  (not everything on the menu is good.)  Their name is about tacos, not tamales or burritos or anything else.  Get the TACOS.  Add cheese.  Maybe get some guacamole (not completely necessary). They will pencil it all down on their waitress pads, then tally the total on a little calculator, and take your CASH.  I love it when the people in front of me order like 6 dozen tacos for their office, then try to use the company card.  HA!  Go to subway.  Anyways, if you order that many tacos, or if you only order two tacos- they give you a mountain of chips and a pint of salsa.  It is very tasty, not spicy, just tasty.  If you eat it for here, get the large root beer, sit on the back patio, and play Ms. Pac-Man. I try to eat there when I drive up the 405.  I hate the 405.

Took a good friend of mine here for her birthday after seeing those ridiculous commercials late at night. I live out near Orange County so just getting here was a pain in the ass. The 405 was under construction so it was more congested than usual, and it was in the middle of the blazing summer in my crappy non air conditioned car. But this would all be worth it, right? These were the famous Tito's tacos after all, and the only thing better than a Tito's taco is two. Well, that's all bullshit. The place was PACKED with white people, we had to park about two blocks away. Being Mexican, you can only imagine how disappointed when I realized these are HARD SHELL TACOS WITH LETTUCE AND CHEESE, WHAT THE HELL? You're telling me I drove like an hour away just to get something I could have gotten for a lot less at a Taco Bell? These were just disgusting, the hard shells were soggy, the meat was dry, the guacamole and salsa were ridiculously watered down. Stay away from this place and go to a Del Taco instead if you're really in the mood for whitewashed Mexican food.

Is LA serious about tacos? This place is a joke and frankly a total disgrace to anyone that likes authentic tacos. If you are a big fan of Jack in the Box, or T-slam then this place might place third on your list of places to visit after powering down about 8 bong hits. After opening the cover from "titos box of horrors" I was surprised to see my "guac" looking a lot like cool whip, and a frothy salsa that was the only saving grace in this entire experience. I don't typically write such negative reviews, but I just wanted to let everyone know before you wait in line at Tito's what you are in for. If I could possibly give this 0 stars I would. If you do decide and check it out for yourself, I would ask that you bring a large bottle of Pepto.

this is a fun place to be and to hang out, especially at nights and weekends. people stand and crowd around outside waiting for tacos. it's decently cheap, not dirt cheap. the food is only ok. the sauce they cook the meat in for the burritos has a really weird/interesting taste to it. it's not bad, just a bit different from what you may expect. i'm a fan of this place but i will say that it's a bit overrated. i think one comes here for the fun of it and it's kind of a local thing, while the food is somewhat secondary...

I don't know much about tacos but I can tell you this... I punctured the upper palette of my mouth with a nacho chip from Tito's yesterday.  I was casually munching along with my friends (we all ordered one taco and one burrito apiece) and before I even got to the burrito, an errantly placed chip cut into the roof of my mouth and I bled terribly for at least 15 minutes.  This had never happened to me before.  I'm not sure if this is Tito's fault but I believe a nacho chip should have some give in this regard.  Nonetheless, before my laceration,  I found the taco to be pretty tasteless, especially the cheese (didn't taste like anything at all -- although it looks nice).  The guacamole was completely liquified and could easily be poured out like milk.  The salsa was runny and watered down.  Pretty disappointing but very cheap. I can see why people have a nostalgic attraction to this place (because it's cheap, open late, the catchy jingle, housed in a shack and always has a huge line cued up) but it wouldn't be my first destination.

You don't go to Tito's for quality, authentic Mexican food. You go for those guilty pleasure regret-it-later oh so greasy and crunchy cheap tacos. There's something about Tito's that just makes you crave it when you haven't had it in a while. It's the perfect place to just order 3 tacos and pig out!!! It's just so satisfying to come here with friends when you're stoned and broke and need a taco fix! It's one of my top places to go eat when I'm back home in L.A. The service is horrible but what do you expect? It's a fucking taco stand! It's so close to Venice that you might as well get come Coronas, a blunt, some Tito's and chill on the beach all day...

i honestly think this place is mainly for ppl that have either left the club drunk, or left the bar drunk, or is on a aspiring model/student budget.its very greasy and has way too much cheese piled on it.i really dont know why ppl stand in line for this food.its not good at all...

Every time I passed by this place there was such a long line. It's not because the food is good it's because it takes forever to get your food. I finally waited in line and after 25 minutes discovered that THEIR FOOD IS GARBAGE. I was expecting something that tasted like mexican food.

ok. i've been going to tito's since as far as i can remember. I believe one reason why people love this place is because of the price. Me and my gf can get what we want for around 12 bucks maybe even less. The burritos are my favorite. the tacos in my opinion are so so. this place is the place to go if you got the munchies and are low on cash. For the price you're paying, you really can't complain.

If you like over-rated, long lines, and food lots of grease and ZERO taste, then you should come to Tito's Tacos! How can this place be famous? Even their salsa is horrible. I should've just gone to Baja Fresh on Venice Blvd. People love this place? I just don't get it.

You have to go to Tito's tacos. There are so many great places that have good mexican food but no other place I have ever been to has ever felt so Mom and Pop's like. They always have a huge line between 1200 and 12:30 pm. This place has been around for ages. They are so simplistic too. They use no cash registers only calculators. I don't know how they do it but they are so quick and always accurate with everyone's order. They serve large portions and the prices are probably the best in LA. a huge yummy burrito is like $1.25 no joke! Try it once and you will be hooked. Excellent staff too.

oh, the memories... being a kid and spilling taco grease down the front of my snorks shirt.  tito's tastes as good today as it did back then.  although now, the salsa could be spicier.  you haven't had a bean and cheese burrito until you've had one from here.  take it home and eat it with some jalapeno hot sauce from trader joe's...SO GOOD.

3-1/2 stars. (Can Yelp figure out a way for Yelppers to enter half stars?) Eating a Tito's taco isn't about judging its authenticity or comparing it to taco truck gastronomy or "the best tacos in L.A." It's more like the so-bad-it's-good category. Like Hostess cupcakes, Kraft macaroni and cheese and America's Next Top Model. Yes, there are a billion other taco joints in L.A. that have far better tacos, but something strange happens when you eat these knowingly sub-par crunchy, greasy numbers: you find yourself wanting more. Maybe it's the Potato Chip Effect -- you know they're junk but once you have one, the serotonin kicks in and you're on the roller coaster to keep your brain chemistry on the level. Add to it the atmosphere of waiting outside in long lines with homegrown Angelenos and barrio brothers, with no hipsters or velvet ropers to wade through. And, as much as I'm down with Tito's tacos, I actually love their tamales more.

This is one of those places that im glad I went to.  It is legendary and considered one of the premier taco places in LA.  I thought it was good.  The value was really good but overall it was just that good.  Not great. Definitly reminds me of Henry's Tacos in Studio City as they are both legendary but somewhat average on taste.  Could come back but wont rush.

I've been going here for at least 30 years now or more. I live in Long Beach so I can only get here occasionally while driving through. I love their all meat burritos with the red sauce oozing out of it. Can someone email me of a similar all meat burrito with sauce like this in the Long Beach or Orange County areas? I've been looking but the only burritos I come across are mainly dry. I don't eat Mexican much because of the fat and etc. but the food here always brings me back. Mexicatessen on Atlantic in Monterey Park about 30-40 years ago had the same food to a "Tee"...childhood memories and the extra salt on the hard shell tacos, yum!  PS. I grew up near East LA so I know authentic Mexican food. But this place still gets my vote.

Not sure what's the big "hoopla" about this place?! It's ah-ight! The line during dinner time was sooooooo long and the way they work the line is sooooooo inefficient. One person is taking care of you at the window, he/she will get your drinks (in the mean time walking all around the kitchen to get you tacos/burritos/chips and dodging 20 other co-workers  in between...so every little thing they're getting you takes about 20 times longer...I mean...really??!! REALLY???!!!  Ever heard of an "assembly line"? So things get done faster and more efficient? Don't get me wrong, people were nice and I felt taken care of ...once I got to the window :(  ...however, with that much hassles...I was expecting a completely flavorful, robust meal with true Mexican flavors...but it was just "OK"! .....so I never really went back. Sorry for all the Tito's fans, we may not agree on this.... I "L-O-V-E" Mexican food, but I've had much better Mexican food elsewhere...like taco truck on Venice/La Brae, on Wester/Fountain, or at the famous "El Taurino" on Hoover ...I mean C'mon!!   : |

Don't remember the first time I had Titos but I am told it was in the mid 1960's at the age of two.  Growing up in Culver City I had Titos very frequently with both family and friends and I always loved it.  I have lived in San Diego for over 20 years and have never found any Mexican food as good as Titos.  When I come up to visit family I wish I could eat at Titos each and every time.  Being someone that does not do well with spicy food I always loved their salsa.  And I find myself still having cravings for a Titos feast.

Tito's Tacos is absolutely awful.  These are the cheapest tacos around, and they make sure you taste the cheapness in every bite.  I would rather have Taco Bell...and I think Taco Bell is pretty bad too.  Also, there is a long line for Titos and parking is not easy...god bless you poor fools, there is NO REASON to stand in line for Titos.  Terrible tacos.

(she's never been to in-and-out, which i find strange.) the other night, i was at a party in culver city and a friend and i stopped here after escaping. we waited, we jumped in the car, we ate on the way up to the palisades. eh. the bean burritos were beany. the chips were greasy. the tamales were exactly what i'd expect out of a place like this. i always question how anyone from a certain culture can cook food in a restaurant representing that culture and be ok with it all tasting like nothing.

Simply horrible food.  I gave this place a second chance and confirmed how bad the food is here.  I had two tacos and a burrito. I felt gross eating this "food."  Not the gross when you eat junk food and I feel sick later feeling but one that as you chew the food, and you wonder why you're eating it.  I ate here first maybe five years ago out of curiosity.  I ate here a second time to find out if I could have been wrong the first time.  No, the food here is bad and I have no idea why almost everyone I know loves this place.  I don't know if it's the "oh the line is long it must be good" or "this place has been around for years and reminds me of my childhood in the Westside" but I really don't understand why people choose to eat here. The first trip, I said their salsa and chips were pretty good...second time, I said to myself, "I should have stuck with the salsa and chips." This definitely is not a good representation of LA's wonderful food scene. Tito's is just one of those wacky things about LA that I will never understand.  We have a great selection of authentic Mexican establishments and food trucks...why would someone want to eat here?  I would give this place "0" stars if I could.

i've been meaning to make a trip to tito's tacos for the longest time.  every time i drive past, i ALWAYS see a bunch of people here so i figured that it must be hella good.  so, after my bf and i finsihed with some errands, i asked him to take me to tito's to get some tacos.  we walked in and the place was already busy.  i already knew i wanted crispy beef tacos with cheese and he wanted a beef burrito with rice and cheese.  ok, so when i took the first bite of my taco, i thought, "hmm..."  i finished my first taco and bit into my second one.  my thought at this time was, "not bad".  by my third taco, my thoughts about tito's tacos were about the same.  in my opinion, "tito's tacos are alright", and NOT "omg!  tito's tacos are hella good!"

I actually saw the Virgin Mary imprinted on a burrito I ate here.  While I dont care much for their meat burrito, their bean & cheese burrito is OUT OF THIS WORLD!  Damn I love this place.  Their "tacos with cheese" are sooo goood - I cant believe anyone would say otherwise.  This place is the BOMB!  LOVE that fresh salsa.  Prices are good - much cheaper than my beloved Taco Lita in Arcadia, but thats a whole different burrito (you can see my review of Taco Lita). Their ingredients are fresh.  In fact, the last time I was there, a woman had actually brought her pot from home to purchase a potfull of beans - I shit you not. Now thats going a bit overboard even for a bean-lover like me, but its true.  Now, for the things I hate about it: I hate their LONG lines.  In fact, I hate their whole concept of a "line."  Its hard to figure out who's placed their order and who's waiting on their order.  Also, they've recently started taking online orders BUT with a $75 MINIMUM.  Puleeze - like I really need 75 bucks worth of tacos. So screw that. So for these offenses, I have to knock off a star. Still, I love Tito's and I know EXACTLY what time to go so I DONT have to wait in line with the rest of those hungry chumps.  But you dont think I'd disclose that on here do you?

Hmmm...no comment about some of the below reviews except to say that criticizing a rooster for not being a peacock is inherently problematic. Let's get down to brass tacks, though: the tacos are just fantastic. Shredded beef (not ground), a pile of lettuce and grated cheddar ensconced in a shell that seems custom deep-fried around the taco contents is just poetic and greasy and delicious. The salsa is what it is; I like it as mostly a condiment of tomatoes and cilantro with just a touch of spice. It sort of refreshes the grease bomb of the taco. Bean and cheese are gooey and good, sorta San Diego-style (not quite Aliberto's (sp?) caliber, to be honest). I would opt for Orange soda to wash all this down and I think they rock that crushed ice that some people I know just weep for. Tito's is NOT to Mexican as Panda is to Chinese though to be sure it's not auténtico. It IS what good Chinese take-out is to Chinese food (I'm sure you all know that's not authentic either). Totally worth hitting up if you are in LA. Ignore the naysayers - the line's longish but you'll live. Don't go there in a big hurry and you'll probably really enjoy this stuff...

I went here once on a Monday around 10:00 am. It wasn't crowded when I was there. But I drove past it once on a Sunday in the afternoon, and there was a line all the way around the block. I thought the food was decent and the prices were very affordable. The salsa just tastes like fresh pureed tomatoes though. Also, I can't figure out why this place is so popular when there are countless Mexican spots throughout the Los Angeles area that seem to be nearly identical in terms of food, atmosphere, and pricing.

I am an LA native and these are the absolute worst tacos you will find in the city.  There is no doubt in my mind.  They are literally swimming in grease, zero flavor, unless you count the taste of lard, and with each bite you will feel one step closer to having a heart attack.  My boyfriend and I were dumbfounded over the length of the line, which is what prompted us to give Tito's a try.  Turns out, most of the people in line stopped for the same reason we did - curiosity over the long line. Although we didn't stick around to ask them what they thought of the tacos.  As for the two of us, we will NEVER be back.  This place is highly overrated.

Tito's is the perfect taco dive.  Crummy parking, questionable neighborhood and lots of traffic.  I've never been here when there hasn't been a long line.  Expect to wait at least 15 minutes to a half an hour.  But the wait is worth it.  The taco with cheese is heaven.  Free chips and salsa with your  purchase.  However, I always buy an extra bag of chips and a pint of salsa for late night munchies.  I love the all meat burrito.  Chili colorado and that's it.     The enchilada is so-so, but everything else I've had there has been great.   Don't be intimidated by the lines or order takers.  Just squeeze in and let them know what you want.

Again, an LA institution I wanted to try and see what the hype was about. Lucky I found parking right away. Lines were long, though. Took about 25 minutes to get my order. My bro and I tried the beef tacos, beef burritos, and chicken enchilada. NO REFILLS FOR SODAS. Tacos and burritos are tasty, beefy, heavy. Additional watery sauce adds some piquant tastes, and their salsa has strong, overwhleming cilantro taste. That's good for me, not my bro. I actually enjoyed it. But why the 2 rating? I value time. Time can never be regained; money can. So for you to waste 20+ minutes in whatever you do, the payoff/return must be exceptional. I can say that many other local Mexican joints can deliver the same taste and quality as Tito's for less and shorter wait. But they are not LA institutions. Mr. Tito was there licking his chops at the suckers who want to hand hm their hard-earned money. Worth it if he organizes his intake and ordering and delivery procedures and stop wasting people's time so much. But he won't. Bottom line: great tourist trap, or for out of town guests, but not a regular place to go. Like I said before, I'll do it once, but I'll be no fool for any kind of food.

Made another pilgrimage to the legendary Titos. In a world of constant change, the most wonderful thing about Titos is that nothing has changed in the last 20 years I have been coming here. The refried beans are just as phenomenal as they were when I was a kid. And in fact, they are served in the same container by (some of) the same people from the same window. The tacos are the same; they may not be the best in the world, but they haven't changed. I love the reliability here and the fact that when all else changes (and often degrades) I can still rely on Titos to server up exactly what I want. I don't live in LA anymore, but when I return, I always go out of my way to come here for a taco and the best refried beans north of the border. Generous amounts of chips and salsa are included (in a box) as they have been since the beginning of (my) time. If you own Titos, please don't change a thing... not a thing (well, except adjustments for inflation... :) You are perfect the way you are.

I wanted to see what all the craze was about this place so I checked it out. First of all, they only have beef as an option for their tacos and burritos. I guess it's a way to slim down the options and I wouldn't have minded if the beef in the tacos wasn't so dry. When I opened up the taco (hard shells, not soft) the shredded beef looked like a huge chunk of meat. And there was way too much cheese on the tacos and not much of anything else. I also got the cheese enchilada, which was too cheesy for me and  the corn tortillas were too thick. I will say that the guacamole was decent, although a little too soupy for me. The free salsa they gave with chips was pretty bland, and could have used a little kick to it (maybe some jalapeños?). My boyfriend got the beef burrito, which was actually tasty and not dry like the taco, but not great enough for me to want to come back there. For a cheap eats place and the long lines I see outside of the place all the time, I was really disappointed.

i LOVE tito's tacos. I have been coming here for about  more than 15 years. I can't really remember the first time I've ever came here because i know i pretty small, I'm now 23 and know that I have come here for a good portion of my life. I rave about it all the time. I have brought friends here who LOVE IT and become addicted just like me and I have friends that really hate it. Those were usually the ones who expected authentic mexican food -- which Tito's ISN'T. I think if you come to Tito's knowing that, you wont be disappointed. Aside from charging 50 cents now for some freakin cheese, I still get tacos and a meat & cheese burrito. I never get anything diffferent, only recently adding cheese to my burrito about two years ago. Yes the parking sucks but if you go into the residential neighborhood across the street you can always find parking, I do. This place is awesome and is always crazy busy because how good it is. I don't know why people hate on this place because the reputation is really good and they dont look like they'll ever go out of business! They need to invest in making t-shirts or bumper stickers because they have so many fans!

This place gets 5 stars from me. My family has been eating here for as long as I can remember. Their food is delicious, by all means. I do not eat meet, but they have a few things that I can order. Its hard for me not to stop and get food if I'm in the neighborhood. I eat here often. I hate to say it, but my brother got food poison from this place last year and it was real bad. He has not eaten there since and won't. Even that is not enough to keep me away. I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys Mexican food. You will find great, authentic and fast food here. Though the lines may be really, really long at times, it is totally worth it. When I had eaten meet, their shreaded beef was mouth watering. They use just enough cheese, they don't short you on it. Each order comes with plenty of chips and a side of salsa, this always is nice to see and taste. You must try their guacamole.

it's not all that tasty at all, but you know what motherfuckers?  that shit's magical.  the salsa is pretty drinkable.  it's special because they're hardshell tacos and the tortilla is nice and thick.  and those commercials..they make so much sense when you're stoned.  tito is a-ok in my book.  points off for not having horchata.  but you know, you can walk over to cinco de mayo on the corner and get yourself a nice horchata.  orale!

the order. regular taco chicken tamale to be frank, im not sure why tito's is so popular. first of all, the beef i got was pretty dry and it was a lumpy mess. the taco shell was borderline stale. the salsa is oversalted. however i will say the chicken tamale i had was mildly seasoned and had a great subtle flavor that combined well with chicken meat. im not a huge fan of tamales but that marinated chicken meat was delicious. to tito's credit, nothingwas underseasoned and i didn't feel like it was a complete waste of money. i just don't understand the hype with the establishment. oh and the mild au jus sauce was delicious. i have never had that before and if they cooked the meat in that, they'd have a winner. all in all, try the tamales, if not for the breading outside, then the meat inside. though i only had the chicken,i suspect the beef tamale would be seasoned as well as the chicken. it can't be worse than the beef in the taco.

For fast mexican food, Titos is the best.  I have been coming here for over 40 years.  The food is simple but addicting and great.  Best are the tacos and burritos.  Every couple weeks I crave Titos and go for my fix.  The salsa is thick and medium spicy.  The guacamole is good but has a thin consistency.  No chicken or pork here just beef.  Just like Saturday Night Live....taco taco taco

Almost every single night i am dragged here by my girlfriend to stand in a long rediculous line for some food thats *%^$, i dont know what the line is for; the food is super bland, the meat is mushy, the guacomle and salsa taste like water, the last time i checked gauc was suppose to be chunky. Also the tito's boxes stinks so bad, i cant say it enough, but if you leave it in your car with the windows rolled up, your gonna need some air freshener ;/ the only thing ok here is the cheese, which you can probably get at home, and whats up with them only having 4 things on the menu. I always ask my friend why in th world does she it this everday," because its simple food" ok i can understand simple, when your not in the mood for real mexican food, or greasy food, or even anything with taste but y do you have to stand in line for 45 minutes(not exaggerating). Plain and simple the ppl that go hear are just going because of the hype that some1 with no-tongue posted. Yuck!

I have no idea why there are always long lines at this joint.  There food is really mediocre.  I went at the recommendation of a former co-worker who swore that it was the best taco joint she had ever had.  So i was obliged to pay a visit.  Man, was I disappointed!  The carnitas tasted watered down.  Their burritos tasted like microwave burritos you get from Costco.  You can get better food from any semi-authentic food truck.  I would even go as far as saying that you would get better food at Taco Bell.  The sitting area was dirty...probably because the place was so under staffed that no one had time to clean it.  I just don't understand why people are so crazy about it.

Loved this place when I lived on the Westside. It's nothing to write home about, or supposed to be authentic, but a good and cheap fix for those craving something crunchy, simple, fried and junky. Basically a greasy spoon Americanized-Mexican food joint, but if you like crunchy deep fried tacos this is your place. The key is they put the shredded beef in the shells before they drop them in the crack infused oil. Salsa is watery and mostly tomato with black pepper (maybe crack too not sure), and packs no heat but is some how delicious with the chips. Hmm love me some crunchy thick cut tortilla chips. It is owned by an old Jewish lady so that may explain the gringo flare but who cares. Haven't ventured out to try the other stuff on the menu except for the rice or bean bowls, which contain greasy goodness (prob pork lard) as well. I also reccomend the place Cinco De Mayo in the front of Tito's for more variety and they have deep fried chicken tacos as well as platano, frijole plates with crema. YUM!

We drive all the way from Valencia just to eat at Tito's! I will warn you... we've brought many family members and friends to Tito's, and a few say, "What's the big deal?" but most love it right along with us. We also love the root beer and crushed ice to go with our meal. Cash only, and be prepared to wait in line. They will refill your salsa cup if you can get up there to the front of the counter to ask.

Every time I drive pass Tito's, there's a long line wrapping around the building.  I figured it was worth checking out.  The crunchy tacos were pretty good, but I don't think they were worth waiting 20+ minutes it took to order.  The enchilada was ok, but I probably wouldn't order it again.  Guacamole and salsa were pretty weak but it's free with the meal so you can't complain.  I'd come back for some cheap tacos, but not if it'll require the long wait time.

Tito's Tacos does not serve comida mexicana so get over it.  Pot roast tacos fried in lard, gaspacho salsa, comodity orange cheese, soggy iceberg lettuce.  It is also the very heart of LA, for some of us a spiritual nexus and the wellspring of true comfort food, way more comforting than chicken soup or meatloaf.  The one place/thing in West LA that has not gotten any better, or any worse, in at least 50 years.

Tito's isn't bad, but it isn't that great either. If you want a lot of tacos and aren't overly concerned about quality this is the place to go. I dislike how the parking lot is always overcrowded, it's cash only, seating is limited and the lines are unusually long. I usually just head up the street to Cinco De Mayo where parking is usually available, they take card and the food is better.

Ok been seeing the commercials and finally had a moment to check it out. I think it's an odd place the ordering system is quick but it throws you off, next I like the menu but it's inside and hard to see, next, i don't dig being being charged for cheese, add it in to the price. So 2.30 for a taco with cheese, I think it's a tad greasy, but the shells are super crunchy, I like that, I like the cheese you do get, I also ordered a beef tamale the outer part was good, but not great like lulu's. But it's only 2.30 the chips and salsa was very good IMO.  6.60 for two tacos and one tamale I think it was good enough not the best I've ever had but good and it did have a unique flavor so a solid 3 stars I'd go if I was in Culver City

I love the vibe, hand-made food, and the cheap price, but I honestly don't find much on the menus impressive.  The tacos are nice and flavorful, but everything else is rather so-so.  I find the salsa too watery, the tamales uninteresting, and the seasoning as a whole is rather bland.

I have been going to Tito's since I was an infant.  And my parents have been going there since before I was born which is before 1982.  We love this place!!  If you are looking for something healthy, you're in the wrong place.  If you're looking for something tasty, you got it!!  My whole family makes a trip down here  whenever we are in Southern Ca.  We live in NorCal now.  The lines speak for themselves.  Obviously people wouldn't be waiting in line if they didn't think the food was awesome.  It is ALWAYS packed!!  Seriously, why don't they create a new Tito's???  We need one in the BAY!!!  Love it!!  I could drink the salsa!!

The lines can be as long as 30 minutes on weekends. Menu is the basics. Taco's have thick tasty corn shells, real fresh grated cheddar cheese, lettuce, shredded beef (or "meat"). You get crunchy chips to compliment the generous cup of salsa which is not hot but is flavorful with fresh tomatos blended smooth. There are other comparably delicious tacos but these are a favorite. The crowd ranges from gardeners to mechanics to yuppies to suits. Everyone is pretty much a fan. Prices are not the cheapest but are a damn good value.

Cheap, delicious tacos and unique salsa (very fresh, ciliantro-y taste), and their bean and cheese burrito is deliciosa.  However, they lose a star because the parking situation is horrible.  Their parking lot is way too small, and there's always a long line.  Sometimes the parking is so bad that I've left and eaten somewhere else.

Tito's Tacos is not worth the wait.  When you drive by and see that long line keep on driving to Pinche's Tacos on Washington Blvd.   I went on a saturday afternoon and the wait was about 20 minutes just to order.   This place is way over rated.   My only guess is people go here for cheap bland tasting food.

The tacos are awesome- hard corn shell, tasty seasoned meat, and with shredded lettuce, tomato, sour cream and cheese, can't be beat.  The other parts of the experience are good too - parking can be tough, the lot is small so you'll probably have to park on the street; the line can be a bit of a wait; the people taking your orders are really cool; and if you want to sit down and eat, space is somewhat limited because the place is popular.  Unfortunately, don''t really like the really greasy chips or watery flavorless salsa.  And I've tried the other items on the menu, like the enchiladas, but the tacos are far and away the best thing going for the place.  Guess that's why it's called Tito's Tacos and not Tito's Enchiladas.  But do go there for the tacos at least once, and you'll see what people are so excited about.  I'll definitely be back.

Yeah i gave this place 5 stars!!! Some of you readers might ask "what in the hell are you thinking"? ...First off, i know this place gets a bad rap because most will argue the food isn't authentic. I agree its not 100% authentic however, i don't give a shit!! When food taste good, that's all that matters! I'm more fond of this place because i grew up around the area and have been going for years. We used to go here as kids and its funny cause now i see friends that are now parents that go here with their little ones. Don't get me wrong, i love authentic Mexican food and will pass Titos tacos up in a second for some home cooking but people need to remember that Titos isn't meant to be authentic! its simply fast food! And in my opinion, if i had a choice between Taco Bell or Titos, I'm choosing Titos!! For those of you who are reading the reviews to decide whether to go or not, just go! Its straight up comfort food at its best! Just beware. Parking sucks and the Lines are always long...Hey maybe that's a good thing! Titos must be doing something right! Go try it out!

Titos Tacos is one of if not my favorite restaurant in A. So simple yet so delicious!! Tacos (always with CHEESE) and their Bean & Cheese Burritos are BOMB!! (Always have to remind them no meat and don't get surprised if they look at you crazy when you say it, thats the norm.) Their salsa, although not always pleasing to the eye, is better than any homemade I have had. Love Titos....the only thing better is TWO ;).... Oh and to the man who said there was no seating, YOUR WRONG There is plenty indoor and outdoor, there is even a mini arcade for the kids!!

Titos Tacos is DEF not a typical authentic Mexican food joint... their tacos have a Tex mex taste, but drench them in the salsa and u are in taco heaven! Their plain bean burritos are the bomb too... but other reviewers are right, you either love it or hate it....  the only place u will find "authentic Mexican food" is prob your momma's kitchen... if she's Mexican of course...

I grew up on Tito's Tacos! No, you're not getting gourmet new age Mexican cuisine; you're getting consistant, family operated, comfort food. A taco is hard to mess up, yeah they're good. But the meat! It's just so delicious! You need those super crunchy chips to scoop some up. Family favorite, a LA eating outting, yum!

Love the food. Wish the line was able to get me & out quicker but after biting into the food, I'm reminded of why I wait. I eat there about once every two weeks. I get a 2-4 tacos with cheese depending how hungry I am. They are very heavy handed with the cheese so I usually order one without cheese & spread it out between them. When I get sick of eating tacos then I switch over to the delicious burritos. Their salsa is amazing, fresh & refreshing. It has a hint of spice which doesn't make it mind numbing like some other places. The food is what keeps their lines always full. There isn't a time of day when they are open that I haven't seen people there.

So much HYPE, and for what? Plain old tacos. I felt like I was in line for a disneyland ride, it was SO long, only to be very disappointed. The tacos were mediocre, the chips were okay, the salsa & guac are an exact imitation of el pollo loco (except the green sauce at el pollo is better), and there was no hot sauce. I always like a little kick in my mexican food and all tito's had to offer me was their mush called salsa and some mushed up jalepenos. Tito's has the look of one of those legit hole-in-the-wall mexican joints, but it's just another beat down version of del taco.

Come on!!  This place is purely bland volume-based fast food.  It's not real Mexican food.  The only positive thing I can say about it is that it's fairly fresh, and a better option than Jack-in-the-Box.  In an area filled with great, cheap Mexican Food (including the pre-trendy roach coach trucks), eating at Tito's reflects a lack of any initiative.  But then, there are people who give high ratings to El Coyote...

utterly dissapointing, greasy and the meat literally has a pissy taste, like its dog meat. I've never taken two bites of a burrito and abandoned it. I'm clueless as to why anyone would go out of their way to hit this. Does the fact that this isn't a chain make people think its somehow more authentic and tasty, sadly the opposite is true, what a waste.

My wife and I were told by two people to try Tito's, so we had high hopes.  We love little hole-in-the-wall, local places.  The place was packed when we were there.  We're not picky eaters, but I must say though, the food is bad, really bad.  I'm not sure how anyone would think this food is good.  The taco is honestly one of the worst we've ever had...same for the enchilada.  The salsa and burrito are maybe average at best.  The meat isn't seasoned, thus making the food taste bland.  In this case, really bland.  I hate to say it, but Taco Bell has better food.  Just about any taco truck in LA has better tacos, hands down.

OK, if you plan to go here I suggest only getting the Tacos.  If they only served those I'd give them 5 stars because I love 'em so much.  I agree that most of the other stuff does not taste like authentic Mexican food or very good for that matter.  However in their defense have had authentic Mexican deep fried tacos which are very similar to their's, thus I they're not completely Americanized.  I'm not a big fan of cheese on any type of tacos, but the kind they offer is really for American tastes.  However I have to restate I really love their tacos and will continue to go back and buy 'em :)

can't believe all the bad reviews here. this place has had a line going out the doors and into the street from open to close for like 30 years. i don't think they get that by serving shitty food. the taste at tito's is unique, i've never had salsa, or a stewed meat burrito back in my meat eating days that tasted like this place. fucking delicious. i don;t think they're trying to be "traditional mexican" here. don't get so sad about it. the ONLY drawback on this place is the shitty parking lot, but you can always find a spot under the freeway. i know it;s such a hassl to pay the meter 50 cents and walk half a block. just like randy's donuts, you'll always get a good snapshot of los angeles folks here. everyone from the honest construction worker, trust fund artist, and shady jew day trader. they're all here. 310 forever and ever...

Don't hate. I have read all the other "reviews" and I think everyone needs to chill....Tito's is the best stoner food you will ever eat!!  You know what I'm talking about.  Why does 7-11 exist? Stoners. You could go to the regular market and get everything cheaper but if you're stoned you go into overload....thus 7-11 was born now generations later we are "Addicted" to 7-11  everything in that store is catered to the state of being stoned. why do you need hot nachos and mountain dew?   cause you are stoned and have mad munchies. right? Now. Imagine being stoned ditching high school and eating a "Tito's Taco" man you are hooked! just like the little kids and the happy meal, you have to admit you actually crave that piece of shit cheeseburger from McDonald's don't you ? You are now hard wired and nobody can tell you it's shit. same thing. some people think its awful and some think it's the bomb!!  or is that "bong"???

I don't get it. Average it best. I really do not understand why there is a line. There are a ton of other similar restaurants in the area which are as good or better. Just off the top of my head, Mrs. Garcia in Culver City is better without the wait and La Playita in Venice is also better, you may have a bit of line though. Eat at Tito's if you don't have to wait in line. If there's a line, Taco Bell is only a couple blocks south.

Tito's opened in 1959 and I've been a regular since then. I now live 2500 miles away but make a beeline for tito's every time I'm in LA. The red salsa is what makes their tacos so special. Love it! They pile on the chips at no charge. Usually long lines but moves fast.

We live close to Tito's so it's convenient.  The food is good-not great, though, despite their reputation. The tacos and burritos are a favorite, but the guacamole is hit or miss.  Sometimes it's actually got pieces of avocado in it, sometimes it's just runny.  When they get it right, it's really good, but there's no consistency to the product.  They have great refried beans, but their rice is on the dry side.  None of these issues keep us from eating there, though!

I honestly never understood the hype about this place, but this place is always packed, long line, no parking. It's okay food for what it is.Tito's Tacos would probably only taste amazing after a night out drinking with friends and your looking for a spot to eat cheap. The salsa is good the tacos are just okay but it's nothing special it seems to be a local favorite for those who grew up around the area. People love it for nostalgic reasons, otherwise it's probably not worth waiting in line for though. Its fast food, without it being fast. I probably would only come here if I was low on cash and really had no where else to go, but there are plenty of good places to eat at in the area so I probably will not be going back there. It's important to know that this is NOT authentic mexican food, so don't go there expecting that, like I said its okay for what it is, but why not just go to del taco or taco bell.

ok let's be real, i am always down for some down and dirty mexican food, will eat street food in 3rd world countries so on and so forth.  tito's is garbage, strait up, the taco shells remind me of taco bell, the burrito was so runny it was like soup, the guac was terrible, and the only saving grace was the salsa which was pretty good at best.  someone told me that this place won some sort of award for best tacos which got me very interested especially in a city with over 50% latinos, i find this very hard to believe, whose balls was the owner rubbing/sucking to win this award?....i actually read a comment that someone challenged anyone to find them a better taco, dude are you kidding me?  do me a favor, grab a dart and a large map on LA county, and throw a dart anywhere between the 110 fwy and the 605 fwy, and south of the 10 fwy, north of the 91 fwy and go to this location and walk to any mexican restaurant closest to this point and that taco that is served there will crush tito's....i realized how stupid the "heard" mentality can actually make people when i saw the HUGE line outside this place....definitely unimpressed and will never eat there again.

My first review, so be kind...  Tito's is an institution in LA's westside.  It's basic, no frills, cheap ($2-3) and delicious Mexican fast food with only about a dozen items on the menu.  I've been going there since I was in elementary school and now that I no longer live in the area I try to go every time I come to LA.  While prices have increased a little, and there are a couple of new menu items that add chicken, not much has changed over the last 20 or so years.  The tacos are deep fried with the shredded beef and lettuce with or without cheese inside; Tito's does not serve soft tacos.  My preference though is their burrito, which you can get either all beef or beef with refried beans.   The beef is stewed to perfection and is super tender, though one must be delicate in handling the burrito or else it'll spill on you.  You'll also get a little cup of tomato salsa (their very finely grated version of pico de gallo) and a jalapenyo salsa (upon request), as well as a side of tortilla chips.  I also like getting their tasty guacamole.  Don't expect the chunky kind, it's kind of a puree.  Other menu items include tostada, enchilada, and tamale.  The diverse clientele lines up particularly during lunch hour.

I went here after my sister, my coworkers, and Mexican friends raved about it.  Brought my cousin from out of town, and I raved about the reviews I heard.  First off, this business is not efficiently run as we can tell by the long wait lines.  We ordered an enchilada and two hard shell tacos (no soft shell tacos here according to the lady who snapped at me at the counter).  So when it came out, we were really excited to see what it's all about.  My first bite was not impressive at all.  The hard-shell taco does not look like it came from out of a box, probably made by the workers, but it didn't live up to my standards.  The hard shell was more stale than having a fresh crunch.  It was also too thick and hard.  The beef inside is nicely flavored, but nothing that blows my mind away.  The sauce is good though.  As for the enchilada, we threw away the other half we didn't finish.  So overall, customer service needs major improvement, ambience - nihil, food - I've had better.  Would I come again?  Probably not.

Going to Titos reminds me of a story I heard about some US soccer players (or whatever sport they played) that thought it would be funny to start a fake line into a locked doorway while they were in Russia for a game.  The Russian people, at that time, had to wait in long lines to buy everything, often not knowing what they were waiting for, just hoping it was something they could use or eat.  Soon, a huge long line formed around the block because the people at the front of the line (soccer players) started passing back false information down the line as to what it was they were waiting for.  The players slowly started to get out of line so that it would move, and soon the huge crowd grew restless.  Finally the soccer players left, so they wouldn't get attacked.  In the end, the people slowly made it to the locked door, only to find there was nothing there, and that they had been fooled, and had wasted the better part of their day.  I felt the same way after eating at Titos.

You know the story " The Emperors New Clothes"? Well, that's what I think of when I see all the fools standing in line at Tito's Tacos. Just because someone says this is the best tacos or Mexican food in L.A. it seems many have bought into this joke and are just going along and not questioning what they are eating. I know LA can do better then this. I was raised in So Cal but now live in AZ and I heard about this great place to eat from family about Tito's so I was really looking forward to eating there as was 6 other family members of mine, all of which LOVE Mexican food. I didn't mind the lines or what I thought where high prices for fast food as this just added to the excitement of trying this incredible food at this well known hot spot, we where about to have this great LA experience. BUT as we all started to eat this CRAP I was dumfounded by what I was eating and all the hype about this place and the hysteria round me. The food was not at all special or unique. The tacos where so so and at $1.75 plus .60 for cheese I sure expected better. Some kind of meat and lettuce was all there was to this taco unless you order the cheese for extra. The crisp shell was fine but the taste bland. The meat burrito was terrible. I know I have had better in LA. All there was is a runny meat in a red sauce that had an odd taste to it, nothing else. BORING! And I love a good burrito so another let down. The only thing about the guacamole that resembled guacamole was the color green, that's it. Not the tastes and not the water down stuff they are passing off as guacamole. The beans where ok but again I have had better. Serving the chips with your food was a plus but that's it. No refills on drinks, again what a joke! I will never eat here again and I just shake my head in wonderment to all the dopes standing in those long lines thinking that they are eating the best that LA has to offer. WAKE UP LA, the Emperors has no clothes and Tito's Tacos are NOTHING special! I know LA can do better.

goodness gracious.  very greasy, flavorless, cheap quality tacos.  as in the primary ingredient is a runny, oily substance much like a bottle of cheap cooking oil one can purchase at any dollar-or-less type store - although rumors abound that there is chicken or beef in there.  and the guacamole -   honestly, isn't guacamole made primarily with avocados?  tito's tacos guacamole "recipe" includes the rda's recommended amount of water.  of course, that might help flush out the bottle of grease one consumes from the tacos.

Personally, I only get the tacos, because when "taco" is in the name, it seems only fitting that you order tacos. the tacos are greasy and good, but the best part is the salsa that comes with. together they create a symphony of greasy, savory flavor that only the culinary masters at Tito's can pull off (also, I have found that ordering in Spanish makes them like you more). obviously, this place is not authentic mexican, but that doesnt mean it isnt good. anyone who gives this place 1 star is just being an elitist jerk who is trying to poo-poo the tastes of the hoards of people who obviously love this place. Think about it, would Tito's consistently have a line out to the street if this place was really only 1 or 2 stars? get over yourselves, foodies. Tito's is an LA establishment and isn't going away because a few douches give it low ratings

as a maven reviewer of reviews and critic of critiques, i am typically most drawn to any institution that garners THIS MANY reviews, THIS DIVERSE of yelpership, THIS WIDE AND EVENLY DISTRIBUTED rating spread, and THIS LEVEL OF FERVENCY in reactions. and the menu only has 6-7 items all told (plus some versions on the same theme)!!  whazzup here?? people are CRAZY about this place. crazy in gastronomic lust. crazy in what's-the-big-fuss fury. but most of all crazy about how they feel about this place. so how to sum up my own humble opinion? i do so through these 2 anecdotes:  1) i have sat on those bird infested picnic benches next to more human beings from other countries  who claim that whenever they have a lay-over at lax, they always make it a point to cab it over to ol' titos more than any other eatery....and guess what: many of these folks were, yes, from latin america, yes, i kid you not (even THEY shrug with bewildered confusion about their addiction to this one of a kind taste);  2) i once sat next to a woman who only ordered a large orange soda and a small carton of skim milk (which she mixed together and relished for a good half hour to my noticeable curiosity)....when i asked her "what's with the....? the?...." she too, shrugged and said, "i just love it here. and everything about it."  end of discussion.
