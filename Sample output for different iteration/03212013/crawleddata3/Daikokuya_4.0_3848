Every time and every moment whenever I meet with The great ramen here I just feel from my heart I will come back here as soon as possible. I think no other food can be so delicious like ramen here and it would be the BEST one all over the world.

This hole in the wall restaurant serves delicious ramen. The bowl of Daikoku ramen ($8.95) or the combination order of small shredded pork bowl & salad with Daikoku ramen ($12.95) are the best options. The portion size of the ramen is very generous; two servings worth. The tonkotsu soup base was creamy & not overly seasoned. There are containers of pureed garlic & pickled ginger on the table but the garlic was what helped complete the flavors I was searching for. The chijire style egg noodles were perfectly cooked. I wasn't a fan of the kurobuta pork belly but then again I've never been a fan of pork belly; this looked like uncooked or boiled bacon. The marinated broiled egg was firm & almost flavorless until you reach the yolk. There was a decent amount of chopped green chives, bamboo shoots, & bean sprouts to finish the flavors & texture of the soup. The cabbage / onion salad was surprisingly delicious only because of the salad dressing. I don't know if it's homemade but the sweet, milky, light flavor was so addicting. My bf loved the shredded pork bowl. The bowl was a little larger than how a side of miso soup is served. It was filled with a bed of white rice topped with grilled pork belly, pickled ginger, green onions, & a sweet glaze. We arrived just before 5pm & only waited 10 min for two seats at the bar but evidently the wait can get quite long. Add your name to the wait list & take a seat if one is open (nine waiting chairs) or wait outside because it's a tight area to stand in the small waiting area. To go orders are not allowed. CASH only. Service was incredibly fast.

Great if you want to carb load on mega noodles.  The wait was stupid long too because the place is tiny and the food is good.  We waited an hour for lunch one Sunday.   Since I am the anti-carb person...sometimes...they have the option of the deconstructed ramen where it comes all separate and then I could eat the brother with the rest of the stuff in it and ditch my noddles on the BF. Service here is--funny.  Go.  You'll see what I mean.  Just don't go starving because of the wait.

The ultimate comparison: Daikokuya vs Ippudo vs Totto (the latter 2 being the most famous ramen places in NYC). Sorry, Daikokuya... you can't beat Totto but you sure serve a damn good bowl of ramen! And for dirt cheap!!! Daikokuya serves AT LEAST twice as much food as Ippudo for $9. You can't get anything at Ippudo for that price.. not even an appetizer!! Enough talk about quantity because what it really comes down to is QUALITY. Daikokuya has both quality and quantity! Delicious noodles served in a yummy broth (although not as delicious as Totto's broth) with a few slices pork that are so tender, they break as you lift them with your chopsticks.

Great place for my ramen-fanatic young children.  They weren't even mad that we waited one hour on a Sunday afternoon.  They saw the menu outside and the pictures of what we were waiting for, and they were hungry, eager and patient.   We ordered the Daikokuya Ramen, which is the *big* bowl of their signature dish, and one Tsukemen, which is pretty much the same ingredients, presented differently: there is a bowl of broth, a plate of ramen noodles, and a plate of bamboo, sprouts, onion, pork belly, and boiled egg.  This was really a treat for my 8-year-old, who did not want to leave, she had so much fun eating it.  My youngest daughter buried her face in the Daikokuya Ramen and ate the boiled eggs from both dishes. I'm not a big ramen fan so I was here to give my kids the experience of a Zagat rated ramen joint.  In my opinion, the ramen was less salty and less flavorful than I expected but, of course, I grew up on cheapo Top Ramen, so go figure.  My assessment is most likely unfair. The service was friendly and efficient.

Daikokuya is hands down my favorite ramen joint in the area. The wait can be long, but usually I feel it's worth the wait. Parking can be tough to find too. Street parking is very limited, so you might have to park a few blocks away or cough up the $7 to park across the street at the structure. I normally just get the Daikoku ramen. I don't really like the egg because the yolk is a bit undercooked for my liking (it's supposed to be cooked that way, but I like my boiled eggs a bit more hard-boiled). This time I tried the spicy miso ramen. It looks like they use the kotteri broth, which is a fattier but more flavorful than the normal broth. It really wasn't spicy, but it did add a nice flavor to the whole thing. I ended up adding more re pepper to make it kind if spicy. The oolong iced tea is good too. Definitely the healthy option if you don't want just water. Free refills too! Cash only! Make sure you have cash. You can put your name on the list then run out to the ATM across the street if you need to.

I don't really know how to explain in words how awesome the ramen is here. It was a Monday night nothing else was busy so I decided to head over to Little Tokyo to check out this spot that I had been hearing about on Yelp. As soon as I got there I noticed a line outside the door, once inside someone greeted me very promptly and I got a number. I looked around and it had this ambiance that you were actually at a restaurant in Japan, was really awesome and every seat was packed my favorite part of the place was the sign that read NO TAKE OUT. So you have two options wait or you don't get to try it, awesome I like that attitude. So after waiting what seemed like 45 minutes on a slow night everywhere else I was seated everyone around me had either been there a bunch of times or knew about the place, it was a great feeling going somewhere where everyone around you loves the food. I ordered the standard combo with a side of pork, some people were saying I should try the rice as well. Anyways I got a salad a few minutes later, let me tell you the salad itself tasted fresh and the dressing was also amazing, right away I knew the rest of the food was going to blow me away. A few minutes after that my food arrived, I took one bite into the side dish looked like a teriyaki style bowl, OMG OMG OMG the meat was sooooooo amazing. I nearly forgot about the giant noodle bowl in front of me that I had yet to try. OK I said I'm going for the main course, this is my impression first of all the meat is a m a z i n g I don't know if they somehow marinate it up in heaven and it falls from the sky but I've never tasted pork that good before in my life. Anyways the broth is this like creamy milky kinda taste not bad either everything else in the bowl also tastes very fresh. At the end of the night I take my leftovers to go and on the way home a homeless person asks about my food, after a long time thinking about it because it was that good I departed with my food thinking about how I gave a homeless person my food, I swear it changed their mood.

With close to 4000 reviews, I have to admit I am a little biased with my reviews. Maybe my ratings should be around 3.5 stars. I came here with my family and we waited for close to 1.5 hours for a seat! All of us have never waited so long in our lives for food! Kotteri Ramen - I am not sure if I fancied the layer of oil lingering around my lips but the broth was surely satisfying. Maybe next time I should go for the regular ramen. The chasu was absolutely a big winner here! Unfortunately there were only two or three thin slices. Spicy Miso Ramen- I almost liked this as much as the Kotteri Ramen! Shredded pork - delicious! Need I say more? I do have another ramen place in mind that I prefer with less waiting time and more stuff in it; however the best part was watching how much my family enjoyed their meal more than I do! I guess they forgot how long we waited! :P

This place used to be good. But now, their ramen is way too salty and greasy. Considering the cost and the wait time in addition to the not-so-savory ramen, this place is no longer THE ramen to go in Little Tokyo. I prefer Shin Sen Gumi or Men Oh over this place.

At the persuasion of a good friend, I decided to finally see what all the hype was about. We were lucky enough to find parking across the street in the parking lot for FREE, and we didn't have to wait to be seated. Hooray for us! I had no clue what to try from the menu so my friend ordered for us both. The waiter brought over two ramen bowls with sides of pork, bacon, sesame seeds, and a few other things I can't recall. I just dumped them all and ate. Not bad, not bad .. I was happily impressed. I'll have to make my way there next time in in the area!

After much waiting and anticipation, I finally got to try this place tonight! The ramen was very good but not as incredible as people made it out to be! Slightly overhyped? Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed the RICH BROTH (Kotteri) along with the Tamago Egg, Marinated Bamboo shoots, and some delicious pork! EXTREMELY FILLING because of the pork fat in the soup! Downsides: Extremely long wait  but the nice thing is you can head to head to OZERO for boba while you are waiting :)  Go with groups of 5 or less people!

Since this place had good reviews, I wanted to see for myself. When we got there when it was supposed to be open, they had a sign outside that said they'll be opening 15 minutes later. So we waited about 20 minutes and finally they opened their doors. Our waitress was terrible! When she finally came to our table, she just took one of our menus and gave it to someone she seemed to know and took his order WTF! I would have walked out, but I was starving and had already paid for parking.  Ok so now I'm getting pissed off. When we finally got our order taken...it took forever to get our meal. The other waitress was very nice, but ours was horrible. She acted like she didn't care at all. Now for the food... The ramen was meh... I've had much better. I was expecting a delicious bowl of ramen. But what we got was just average. I was very disappointed that we took this long trip to try this place. However, the gyozas were quite tasty. The pork side dish was just ok. They poured some type of gooey sauce on it that overpowered the meat. The restaurant itself was pretty dirty and crusty. It didn't seem like cleaning was a priority. They definitely need a serious wash down. Overall, I would not come back. There are so many other really good ramen places popping up all over Los Angeles and Orange County. I would rather eat at those other places than to go to dtla where the parking sucks. People wait in line for this? Seriously? You can get a better bowl of ramen, with free parking, better service and no waiting at other ramen houses.

Yes the ramen here is as good as they say it is. It was delicious. The noodles and the soup were wonderful and the pork just melts in your mouth. I've had ramen at different places before, but this is just the real deal. We were sitting at the counter in front of where the chefs were making the food and I thought, this is what Naruto must have felt like. And now I understand why ramen is so good. The wait is about 30-45 minutes when it's crowded, but it's worth the wait! Best ramen I've had so far.

I love the eggs & it's a generous portion! My boyfriend got the spicy ramen (brand new, worth trying!) The broth wasn't super spicy, but it was just right. He doesn't like eggs so I got his! YAY :) Good location, little Tokyo, perfect to walk around on a nice day. The service is really good because they're really attentive. But, then again they're trying to get you out so they can accomodate new people, who are always coming in. Can't complain. Quick, easy, delicious!

Sometimes I wonder what the point is of writing another review for a place that already has almost 4000, but in the end, I just say screw it. My thoughts going into my dinner: I'm scared of how bad the line is going to be. I hope it's not too crowded. Don't overhype it. It may not be that good. How good can ramen be? Is this place really going to be worth it being on Yelp's list of LA's best restaurants? My thoughts when I got there and got seated: Wow, no wait!...granted it was only 5:30pm or so on a Thursday, but I was prepared for the worst. The menu was pretty small for ramen...there was only the original ramen...I didn't see any other specialty or fancy ramens that other places have these days. I appreciate that...stick to your roots Ramen house. This is a little pricier than I expected for a whole in the wall place ($8.50). I'm used to Hakata Ramen Shinsengumi in Gardena, which is my go-to ramen house...and costs $6.85. Don't get me wrong...I've also had more expensive than $8.50 so I wasn't complaining, so just an observation. My thoughts after the food: I'm glad we ordered the gyoza and the ramen...a respectable spread. Gyoza was some of the better ones I've had. I don't know if I'd say it's the best I've ever had, but it's up there with great gyozas. The broth in the ramen was awesome. It was missing something originally though, but they brought over spicy oil and chili sauce at my request. A few splashes of the oil and squirts of the chili sauce and we had some bomb ramen. Highly recommend that technique, but don't worry...no need to thank me. All in all: great experience. It didn't blow my mind, but about what I expected. I don't think it was a game changer, but I thoroughly enjoyed myself. For a large beer, gyoza, 2 bowls of ramen, the bill was $28 something...so pretty cheap too.

I ended up going before a Laker game, and hit the dinner rush hour. I probably picked one of the worst times to go, so I had to wait about 1.5 hours to be seated. The place is pretty quaint and packed with people. Of course I had to order their ramen! Got the Daikokuya Ramen! The presentation seemed rush, and my bowl had an extra large helping of green onion that kind of masked the flavor of the other items. There were bean sprouts, a soy sauce egg, and chashu. The tonkatsu broth was pretty rich, however, I still feel like it was missing something. The chashu was very tender and fatty. You could tell that they cooked and marinated the chashu for quite some time. My experience here was just mediocre, hence only a 3 star rating. I had good company, but I felt kind of rushed to eat so maybe that's why. Service was just average, and our waitress wasn't too friendly. Pretty abrupt in her responses, and it felt like she just wanted to take our order, have us eat, and then have us leave. Even to this day, I can't say that I really want to go back just to have the ramen. I just don't have the urge to be like "OH man I'm craving some Daikokuya ramen". The food just wasn't that memorable to me. I'll probably have to give this place another try, seeing that that this place almost has 4000 reviews.

Being enticed to come here for $5 ramen during their 11th Anniversary http://www.yelp.com/biz_… is barely an inducement -- the wait to get in is horrendous and free parking is not to be had, not to mention the time and gas just to get here anyway... Fortunately, their kotteri broth is still like liquid gold -- a rich, sweet, not too salty porky goodness that is so good that I bagged it even when I finished everything else.  It makes a terrific snack for later, just reheat it and add a package of ramen noodle cooked separately and relive the goodness.  The wavy noodles at Daikokuya were perfectly al dente, the thinly diced green onions were plentiful, the menma was delightful, the fresh bean sprouts were slightly crunchy,  and the chasiu was tender and savory.  But a shadow was cast over the bowl when I bit into the ajisuke tamago;  it was past soft and edging towards hard, the yoke had set, and worst of all -- it was COLD as in taken out of the refrigerator COLD;  this was something of a surprise because I used to boast of how perfect their eggs were... The broth is still badass, but between the hardness of the egg, the expected wait to get in, and the parking situation, I have to take away a star and admit that although it's worth the hassle, it's still a hassle...

Daikokuya is like the ex you'll never quite get over, despite how much time passes since you last saw him. You hate him for making you wait even though you know he's always going to make you wait. You get apprehensive knowing that even if he calls you over for a quick lunch, there will never been a quick meal when it comes to eating with him. You get annoyed by how popular he is with every other Angeleno who knows about his gig, and slightly irritated that you can't get his attention until he's ready for you. You despise him for choosing a spot in Little Tokyo where there's never any parking available when you need one. And yet, even though there's quiet and friendly Mr. Ramen hanging around a few steps from you, and loud fast-paced Hakata down the block, you just can't seem to leave your first crush Daikokuya behind for good. And when my name was finally called after a 1.5 hour wait for the 11th anniversary special ($5.00 price on regular sized ramen), all that flashed through my head was "relief". It's been a good year since I've been to Daikokuya but the broth is still spot on. So rich and filling, with plenty of carbilicious noodles and melt-in-your-mouth fatty pork goodness... I had almost forgotten how good Daikokuya can be. Add a few pickled ginger slivers, a dash of pepper and and and...  Ladies-- this is the closes to sex-on-your-palate as you'll ever get. Until next time, if there is a next time! Okay I won't lie, there probably will be and I'll probably go through the same anxiety as I always do when I come here for a bowl of ramen. But my god, he's worth it. Doncha think so?

I did enjoy my ramen, but this ain't no Ippudo.  (I may have even preferred Santouka Ramen to this.) The Daikoku Ramen with richer kotteri flavor was rich indeed, and the noodles were at a decent firmness.  (I like my noodles pretty darn firm.)   I did order a Combination, which was probably overkill since I didn't finish all of my food.  I got a tuna sashimi bowl, which I would probably rate as a 3-4 out of 5 stars.  The rice was at a good temperature and well-seasoned with rice vinegar, but the fish wasn't quite the freshest (although who really goes to a ramen shop for sashimi??). I got to the restaurant on a Sunday at about 11:30 AM, and I only had to wait about 5-10 minutes.  After I finished eating, the line seemed to quadruple in size.  The lesson is - get here early.

Whole heartedly agree with the review written by Mike C. from Harbor City. This place is outrageously overrated and totally not worth the ridiculous wait. Folks who love this place and don't mind waiting in line probably have never ventured outside of Little Tokyo for authentic ramen joints. Case in point, plenty of ramen joints in Torrance that are much better than Daikokuya and usually no waiting and no problems with parking. Need a few pointers? Ramen Yamadaya, Santouka Ramen, Hakata Ramen, Ramen Hayatemaru and Umenoya. I once waited 2 hrs here like a jackass to see what the fuss was all about and by the time I sat down and ate, I was like, "that's it?" It's like shooting blanks with massive blue balls, if you know what I mean. Not going to argue that the ramen is good, but if you're gonna wait over an hour to be served, it has got to do better than just "good". The only thing that this place got going is the otaku/gaijin-attracting "Little Tokyo" moniker attached to it (and if you read some of the 5 star reviews, a majority of them do indeed sound like they were written by waiiiiiiii kawaii otaku jackasses who think they're masters of the Japanese culture after watching a couple of subbed Torrent anime in their favorite cosplays all up in their parents basement or attic). Little Tokyo got nothin' on Torrance in terms of authentic Japanese restaurants and shops. By the time you're close to being seated, I'll be done eating at two great ramen joints in Torrance, back in my bed and recovering from a food coma.

Parking is no fun and the line can be ridiculously long. If you're starving and anything like me, come packin' with a snack so you don't get hangry. I'm pretty sure your significant other will appreciate it, I know the BF does. Anyway, if you survive the wait after being tortured by intoxicating aromas of goodness, you'll be able to partake in a bowl of delicious ramen. Good broth, good noodles, good times - even my 2 year old nephew was able to get his slurp on in an appreciative fashion. When I first came here, I ordered the bowl with extra back fat (kotteri). Although a tonkotsu fanatic, I found this to be overwhelming and have stuck with the Daikokuya Ramen, still kicks ass. Fine print: bamboo shoots, beansprouts, chasu, green onions, egg noodle (firmness altered upon request), green onions, & sprinkled with sesame seeds (beware for those of you allergic). Oh yeah, for you egg lovers - it's a marinated boiled egg and pretty sure you'll swoon over the yolky goodness. Don't forget to try out the fried rice, it reads on the higher end of my fried-rice-delicioso meter.  Annnnd if you're serious about chowing down, make your bowl of ramen a combo and add the shredded pork bowl if you want to get porky with it. Ramen is better than Pho. forever.

My friend and her boyfriend were in town from Sydney, Australia, so we met up in LA. Both being big fans of ramen we decided to check out Daikokuya. Parking is a b*tch. We circled round Little Tokyo a few times before we found a tiny space to squeeze my car into. Apparently this place is a Yelp top 10 restaurant and as a result, there were a LOT of people waiting to eat. We put our name down, walked around a bit (although, at night there isn't much to see), and then headed back to wait. The inside of Daikokuya is a little divey, but I liked it: made it feel more homey. Itadakimasu: - Daikoku Ramen ($8.95) I was a little surprised that a place known for it's ramen only has one ramen option. But, I guess, quality over quantity, right? My friend and I decided to split a bowl since this was only to be dinner part 1. We got the Kotteri flavor, soup extracted from the back fat. We both thought the ramen was pretty delicious; however, we also both thought it could have been even richer. The noodles were pretty good, as was the pork. Overall, a pretty tasty bowl of ramen. Reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating: I've had better ramen in the States. That said, Daikokuya is a good place for a solid bowl of ramen, as long as you don't mind the wait.

As most people have been saying, Daikokuya is a must try for all traditional Ramen lovers!... I have tried two other spots Robata and Ramen Jinya. If you like those spots then you will like Daikokuya as well. I cannot say which is better out of the three, because all 3 of those spots are damn good. At Daikokuya I ordered the Gyoza appetizer and the Daikoku Ramen. Both were amazing!!! Oh man, the Gyoza was some of the best I've tried, and the Ramen was AMAZING! The broth was so amazing, and they have this garlic stuff on the table that you can add to the broth, and mix it around. That gives the broth an even more amazing flavor burst. The only down side to Daikokuya is the wait (only if you go during peak lunch/dinner hours. We had to wait an hour for a party of two, and were seated at the bar. The place is very small. They only have about 6 booth style tables, and then bar seating. Either one is comfy, but expect to wait if you go during peak hours. The good part however, is that they have so many stores and bars around, that you can peruse around to kill time. We walked into a few of the surrounding stores, and the wait time flew by. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE TRY DAIKOKUYA ******CASH ONLY******

No doubt already that the ramen is delish.  So creamy and flavorful a broth.  Just learned that you can request a half size, but pssh - ORDER AS IS, people.  Enjoy the large ramen and accompanying appetizers.  You waited at least half an hour, if not a full hour, didn't you?   Waiting so long makes me always want to order the ramen because who waits in line forever and doesn't order the house specialty, but I've heard the rest of the menu is yummy too.  I'll be eager to return. 5 fun stars for the service.  I was set to bring in a boba drink from a different establishment, then spilled it all over the front step of Daikokuya.  The host said "Aw it's all good!  We got this.  Don't worry.  Just go on in."   Don't forget: CASH ONLY.

Ramen is good but I actually think the fried rice is even better. If you have to wait for over an hour for ramen here, I don't recommend this place at all. It's not really worth the wait, everything is average and the waitress and waiters are always in slow mode, unless you have time to kill, please find yourself another option.

Welcome to another Re-Review... because saying how many times you'd return is just as important as how good a place is. For a full explanation of my rating system, please visit my profile. Re-Rating: "A" I award this place a Re-Rating of "A" because I will always come back for more. You have my loyalty. I highly recommend this place. This place deserves a 5-star rating because their specialty ramen is very enjoyable. I have been to Japan and have even been to the Shinyokohama Raumen Museum, and this taste is very similar to ramen enjoyed in Japan. In comparison to Shin Sen Gumi, I prefer that place, but this is definitely the 2nd best ramen in J-Town with Orochon as my 3rd best. First time? Order like me! Specialty Ramen, no additions and drink water so nothing takes away from the taste Tips: Leave your credit cards at home because this is a cash only establishment. The wait time during busy hours can be 30-45 minutes so try to go a little earlier than normal. If you sit at the bar, it's like a free show watching them prepare everything in front of you. There is no parking so go for street meter parking  or go to the Office Depot parking lot and walk a bit. You will, of course, need to get validated by Starbucks or Yogurtland, but it's better to get something instead of just paying for the closest parking lots which may run you $7-$10. The restaurant is in an old building so there is not proper air circulation - you will leave the place smelling like ramen.

Piping hot ramen on a cold day, or so I thought (explanation forthcoming). Decided to hoof it down to Lil Tokyo before catching a matinee performance of "Backbeat" at the Ahmanson Theatre.   I've heard the masses, some partial to Shin Sen Gumi, some partial to Daikokuya.  So here it is - Enter the culinary deathmatch! I arrived around 11am on Saturday, with Daikokuya already being busy.  Seating is minimal, with the bar and a row of booths, with one booth beside the door.  The decor made the place seem like I was transported to Tokyo, with hipsters & businessmen sititng side by side, slurping every last bit of broth.   The wait wasn't too long & I was promptly seated.  Of course, I had to order the Daikokuya Special Ramen Kotteri-style for $8.95- http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Large bowl - check! Egg - check! Pork meat - check! Green onions - check! Piping hot - huh? My bowl of ramen was warm, not hot.  I'm not sure if the noodles absorbed the heat of the broth, but the piping hot goodness was instead a lukewarm, mild goodness.   Naturally, I have to add pickled ginger & garlic.  I just about used all the ginger in the jar & most of the garlic.  Visual evidence (these jars were full before I had my way with them)- http://www.yelp.com/biz_… My ramen was rich, fatty, spicy & quite pleasant to the tastebuds.  Lots of food to put down, even for a pro like me.  Sitting at the bar, I had the chance to chat with a couple seated on my right.  Seeing me take pics, I was asked if I was a blogger, to which I replied "Sorta, I'm on Yelp" :) Now for the comparison - Having now had both Daikokuya & Shin Sen Gumi, I have to give the nod to Shin Sen Gumi.  Reasons are- Customization - Shin Sen Gumi allows for diners to choose their toppings whereas Daikokuya is fixed. Seating - More seating is available at Shin Sen Gumi, which makes it more convenient for large parties. Taste - While Daikokuya was good, I think Shin Sen Gumi was that much more better.  The temperature of the ramen probably played a factor, too. Daikokuya, your food was good, but if I was in the area again, I'd most likely head across the way to Shin Sen Gumi to see if the wait is shorter. NOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOM

They say you never forget your first. After popping my Japanese ramen cherry here about a year ago, no other ramen place comes close. While writing, this place already has 3,800 reviews, so obviously this place is doing something right . The usual: parking is horrendous, inside seating is scant so long wait times (even at 11:45am for lunch), but well worth the wait. My recommendation: I always get the Daikokuya ramen kotteri style. It gives it a thicker, richer broth. My friend tried the spicy ramen and said it was okay. There's a $5 special on their ramen from Feb 20-22 I believe so get it while you can! TLDR: bad parking, long waits, TOTALLY WORTH IT, kotteri style ramen gives richer, thicker, tastier broth in my opinion

Came here to grab a bite to eat before hitting the Ahmanson for a show. When we arrived I noticed the line of people outside the restaurant. So we put our name on the list and chit chatted outside. The wait wasn't too bad maybe 15-20 minutes? Smaller parties are seated more quickly. Since we were only a party of 2 we were seated at the counter which I didn't mind because I got to see the guys working on the deliciousness that I was about to put in my tummy!! I ordered the Chicken Teri Bowl which comes with miso soup and a salad for $7.95. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… http://www.yelp.com/biz_… http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Scott ordered the Daikokuya Ramen for $8.95. Both dishes are large in size and I was not able to finish everything. The chicken teri bowl was very good, large slices of juicy chicken covering a large size bowl of white steamed rice. The teri sauce was not too sweet with the perfect seasoning made my tummy happy. I was able to try the Daikokuya Ramen and I must say the ramen noodles and the flavoring of the broth were de-lish! Bring cash because that's all they accept and be prepared to wait. There is some street parking but only if you are lucky.

I will be extremely quick and efficient with this review! I went to this place quite often for my ramen fix but each time I went I was always disappointed in the soup. I believe they really do take the time to marinate and make awesome their broth but boy is it salty!!! Without fail, every ramen bowl I finished was just so overtly salty I usually finish about 3 cups of water by the end of the meal. Their donburi on the other hand is just this sweet wonderful little thing and I definitely love that but as for ramen, I will have to venture elsewhere as I keep coming back thinking everything's going to rock my socks but it turns out to just be a rock of salt D: Not to mention the long wait and hectic parking, but we in LA can handle that much!

Sesame chili oil = bliss. The ramen, despite my admonitions/pleas/begging to make it "super spicy" fell somewhat flat. I'm not hatin' though; I'm a pale rider and thus most folks of color tend to want to talk me down from the habanero highway. As it is, the broth was creamy and flavorful and with a few tbs of the aforementioned chili oil, the ramen became exceptional. This is oodles better than Top Ramen noodles. If you're reading this and you've never had the real thang, then get here yesterday. The salty, crimped noodles in the astronaut packaging--sealed hermetically for our safety--with the uber sodium insisted upon by pharmaceutical companies (looking to bank on your high blood pressure) have done a disservice to Japan. This is ramen done right.

Best ramen I've had so far (and I've been around quite a few). The broth is perfect without being too oily or heavy. Love the noodles they have (it's kind of wavy?) and it's topped with a hard boiled egg, green onions, bean sprouts, pork slices, and bamboo shoots, whereas, most places will charge you extra for most of that. Quick service so no matter how packed it is, you never have to wait long for your food once you've ordered. Place always gets REEEEALLLY packed, so always assume that  you will be waiting around 30 mins to an hour. Parking blows too. I suggest that once you've circled around the blocks twice, just go pay at a lot. Besides these cons, well worth it :) Note: The fried rice bowl here is also bombsies. Best rice bowl they have.

I have no idea how anyone can really compare this place to Orochon and what I mean by that is that they both offer two different kinds of ramen. I really wont even say they are in the same arena but since they are the high rankers Orochon and Daikokuya I can see how they compete for business. So no comparing here im just going to talk about my experience not in comparison to Orochon. Came here last night for some dinner with my friends and I knew it was going to be a long wait so we put our names down and we went across the street to hang out where theres this little shopping center. We came back about 45  minutes later and we still were not called yet. So expect to at least wait anywhere from 45 - about an hour for any place in this restaurant. But before we actually got seated my wife needed to use the restroom for my son and I immediately got a text message from my wife begging me to change my mind from eating here. When I asked Why through text she told me the womens restroom was horrid and she had this feeling that possibly the food would be too. But I encouraged her to go along with it and lets try this place. After the texting ended surprisingly we got called in after waiting for one hour. We had put down on the sign in sheet that is resting up at the front of the restaurant that we needed a table for a party of 5. We were told we could be seated but we needed to try to squeeze our group of five in a booth that was really for 4 people. We tried and well we really just couldnt do it so we called the waitress over to get a chair and she told us we could not do that for our extra guest. So we were forced to move to another table, but no problem. Finally now we were at our table and we all were ready to order the special. It was really good ramen ! really enjoyed it the flavor was quite good, noodles are not like Orochon but very thin like real ramen. The egg was so rich in flavor, really enjoyed the egg and the pork was also very tasty. Unfortunately it was the service that was really lacking here it seems that the waitress was not coming back to see if we needed anything else. We just got our food and then we constantly needed to flag people down to get there attention for refills or just to get napkins.So with the wait, and the ramen being good but the service being really poor and the dirty restroom and the being forced to sit in a table for 4 when we really had a party for five I would say honestly this place is all hype. The ramen is good ! but its not that good, I probably wont be back unless someone is footing the bill, sorry guys but Daikokuya is well just ok.

I eat here waaaay too much - No joke.  This is my true ramen love.  When I eat at other ramen places, Daikokuya is The Benchmark I use to compare all the others.   I have come to realize that this is the best and I am regularly trying other ramen joints to find one better.  I have yet to find such a place so this is the BEST. What is good here?  The Daikokuya Ramen.  The noodles in the ramen are just the right width and cooked just the right amount of time to deliver a perfect noodle with just the right amount of chewiness.  The broth - words cannot explain the full pork flavors and complex but subtle tastes in a seemingly simple soup base.  It is not easy to make and they have mastered it.  All the other ingredients work well together (although I ask them to go easy on the green onions). The pork rice bowl.  This thing is shredded pork and so the flavor of the sweet soy based sauce works in so well and is just simply delicious.  Save some room in your belly for this worthwhile dish. I hate the long wait and impossible parking but I'll still see you tomorrow or real soon I'm sure.

So worth the wait. The guys running the door do this on a daily basis-trust their estimation on when to come back.  They're typically pretty close to being right on the money.  This place is tiny and holds like maybe 20 people total, so the line can get long. Go and walk around Little Tokyo, window shop inside the many many stores, have a drink at the bar next door and then come back when your time is up and check-in.  And if they end up calling you while you were gone, they'll move you to the top of the list---no worries. Once you start eating that sweet, sweet condensed broth, you'll forget you waited. They aren't stingy on noodles here either. Can't wait to go back.

I came here with a friend for the first time last night at 6pm for their special $5 Ramen promotion in celebration of their 11th anniversary. As I expected, the wait was crazy. We were on the second page of their sign-up sheet, so there were about 50 parties ahead of us. Luckily, we came prepared, anticipated the 1.5-2 hour wait, and went exploring in Little Tokyo as we waited. After snacking on macarons and mochi ice cream, and shopping at nearby anime stores, we returned to the restaurant at 8pm, just in time to be called in for our party of 2. We were seated at the bar right in front of where they cook, which was awesome. The waitress took our order of 2 bowls of ramen right away and we didn't need to wait very long for them to arrive. I came with rather high expectations due to the great Yelp reviews here, and I was not disappointed. The pork broth was so flavorful, the noodles were perfectly chewy. It was heaven in my mouth. I enjoyed the food so much, I felt bad when I could not finish the entire bowl. I asked to take the rest to go and the waiter took it for me. Unfortunately, they were so busy that they lost my bowl of leftover ramen! When the waiter came back, he was so apologetic and polite and gave me full new bowl of ramen to go! BEST SERVICE EVER! Overall, great food + great prices + great service = AMAZING! 2-hour wait? Not sure if I would do that again... but I'll definitely come back again for a 1-hour wait :)

Ok.. so this one is definitely better than the MP location. It's bigger and just tastes better. This place is ALWAYS packed.. and not really sure why. I think there are other ramen places around the area that are equally as good. My last visit was on a weekend at 12am - my sister was hungry. So we trotted down the street and I still had to wait 15-20 mins at night :( so I knocked it down a star for their ridiculous wait times. Anyways, the soup and noodle were really flavorful. Too bad they don't have a REAL SPICY version or something that I can add to give it some heat.. I'd probably like it more if it did.

The first time I ate here it was great. But I was on a date and it was my first time and I think I was blinded by love and the hunger of the wait - and the thousands of good reviews! This time was not so great. I was equally hungry after a 45 minute wait - not as long as I had anticipated. The wait for this place seems to consistently be at least an hour. The soup was salty and bland. Not what I had remembered. They do not let you add random ingredients like some of the other ramen places. The egg was not the same as the last time, it didn't seem like it had been cooked in anything. I did see someone else get the spicy miso soup and that looked like it might taste a little better, but I will not be returning. There are too many other places I love in little tokyo with a less then hour wait. Sorry but no thanks.

YUUUUUUMMY. This place is really good.  The broth is a bit on the heavier side which gave me mad food coma afterward, but that's totally worth it for good food.  For anyone who knows me, I'm obsessed with anything noodle-y.  I went here a few months back with the fiance during my lunch break.  Luckily we got there right before the lunch rush, so our wait wasn't too bad.  I don't know if I would wait here for over an hour to eat the ramen noodles though.  That's got to be a 5 star place for me to do something crazy like that.   This place seemed very traditional and authentic.  I've never been to Japan, but I'd imagine that's what it would be like at a typical Japanese restaurant in Japan lol.  Everything seemed a bit crammed but they seemed to make it work.  The service was relatively good considering how busy it was.

This used to be my favorite ramen in LA, but it seems to have fallen down in my rankings. *Make sure you go to the Little Tokyo location, I feel like the other locations don't make their ramen as well. PARKING: Sucks, hah, being in Little Tokyo you probably have to pay for street or metered parking and walk a bit WAIT: Crazy long. The place is pretty small with only about 5-6 booths and counter space, the list to put your name down is usually at least 10+ people in front of you, even when it just opens.  They try to go by quickly but usually I just put my name down and roam around Little Tokyo until I get called. FOOD: They only have one type of ramen really, the Daikoku ramen, which is basically like Tonkotsu and pretty flavorful.   Soup - You can tell they put a lot of ingredients in their soup base and cook it for a while but on a scale of intense flavor it would only rank around a 6. Noodles - Thinner than I would like, and sometimes it's acceptable if the noodles are chewy but the noodles were kind of flat. Egg - Disappointing, I remember it being more soft boiled but the inside was pretty much like a normal boiled egg. Pork - Fairly tender. ATMOSPHERE: Reminds me of a retro Tokyo bar, with different posters and memorabilia around the restaurant.  The bathrooms were located in the back and the restaurant does have a homey/old feel...I think they got a B or C rating. Overall, this is a good place for people who like good ramen, but I wouldn't say it's the BEST in LA.  The wait can be discouraging, but I'd say it's worth to try at least one for ramen enthusiasts.

The broth was tasty, the noodles were too curly and thick, (for my liking) the gyozas were tasty and so was the fried rice, BUT this place IS FILTHY!!!!!  It was incredibly dirty and dingy. I don't care how good the food is, but if the place is dirty just imagine how they are handling your food.  How gross!!!!!  I don't understand how there are return customers here.  Do they not see how dirty this place is?  The plexi glass that separates the kitchen from the bar (the tilted bar because its barely holding) has caked on grease.  Ewwww...I could not bare to look at it while I ate. I wanted to take a shower right after I left the place, burn my clothes and drink bleach to clean my insides.  Ewwww.....how do you people eat here.....

I am so very sorry my friends for adding to the hype, but something spectacular happened here. I cannot consider myself totally versed in the ramen ways, but I've had my fair share of the SoCal variety. They ain't kidding. The worse part about this place is the wait. On a Thursday night and near closing, there was a 30 minute wait with 5 groups ahead of us. The rules for late night dining is that as long as you sign in before closing time, you will still be seated. I overheard that from a girl working there. -=-Ramen Kotteri + fried rice combo-=- Ordering ramen here is pretty straight forward. This is the single dish that most people order here. You may elect to get it koteri, which adds an extra pool of fatty pork juice (back fat just doesn't sound appealing, but it's goooooooood). The flavor difference is slight but if you want the satisfaction of knowing you got all the ramen flavor you could get, this is the way to do it. The fried rice was pretty heavenly...maybe even more flavorful than the ramen was. I would not come here without ordering the fried rice EVER. Mark those words my friends. http://www.yelp.com/biz_…

My favorite ramen in LA. The rich creamy broth is cooked for over 15 hours. The shoyu soaked egg, firm ramen noodles, and tender chashu are amazing. Tip: - Ask for kotteri. - Its always busy, so expect a little bit of a wait. On the upside, during your wait you can always walk over Fugetsu-Do for mochi or Cafe Dulcea for a roti.

This was the best meal I've had in L.A. and definitely my top ramen experience that I will compare all other ramen experiences to going forward. I went with a buddy on a Saturday night. The 45 minute wait for a couple seats at the bar was well worth it. The staff was very attentive to our needs and I liked being able to watch the cooks do their thing behind the bar. I highly recommend the spicy miso ramen. The broth and noodles were fantastic, and I was stoked with the portion size you get at Daikokuya. It was truly one of those rare experiences where it absolutely met my expectations. I left full, happy and looking forward to my next visit.

I first came to Daikokuya many years ago, when a friend of mine suggested the place. We walked straight in and sat at the counter. There was no wait, no hype it was just another ramen shop in Little Tokyo. At that time I would have considered this place a 3 star establishment. Pros: The broth of the ramen is good. They offer many other items on the menu that isn't ramen. They are open late. Cons: The wait is usually 45-60 minutes. Cash Only. Their ramen options are limited. My biggest gripe is the noodles feel like they came from a packet of top ramen. This is the main reason I don't care for Daikokuya. The noodles are lackluster. Overall I try to avoid Daikokuya as much as possible. There are many, better ramen options without such a wait. If there was no wait, then I wouldn't have a problem going, but if I'm going to wait an hour to be seated for ramen it better be amazing and Daikokuya is not.

Visited tonight with a good friend of mine and were welcomed by a 45 minute wait.  This is what I expected considering the many reviews I'd read about this place.  45 minutes was a small price to pay for what my taste buds and I were about to experience inside.  I ordered the Gyoza and the Daikoku Ramen cooked Kotteri style.   &%#@ing Amazing!!!

Tiny restaurant!   I had to wait in the cold for 1 hour and 20 minutes (yes, I timed it with my iPhone) to get seated in this place, but once I did, the ramen hit the spot and warmed me up.  I don't know if I just wasn't paying attention, but I think they only serve one kind of ramen--not like at Hakata Ramen Shinsengumi in Gardena where you can customize your soup--which was fine with me.  I ordered the combination set of ramen + side bowl (Chicken egg bowl).  The ramen was great but I might not have been satisfied if I solely ordered the chicken egg bowl. The service was pretty good.  The servers were attentive to refilling my cup of refillable iced oolong tea and had no problem exchanging the wrong order they gave us for the right one. Tips?   - My boyfriend and I parked at the Office Max on the corner of E 2nd Street and N Central Ave for a flat rate of $5. - Feel free to wander around the shops on Japanese Village Way.  You can pass the time there without getting too far away from the restaurant. - CASH ONLY PLACE!  No plastic. Final Impression?  Not yet ready to say that this is the best ramen I've ever had--but that's only because I haven't yet been to many ramen places to say so.  Once I've had my fill of ramen places, this review will be ripe for an update.

Lucked into a very short wait today trying out Daikokuya for the first time. The rest of my experience, jammed happily into the end of the bar, can be summed up like this: OM NOM NOM NOM DELICIOUS PORK BROTH NOM NOM NOODLES SPORUTS NOM NOM MORE BROTH NOM NOM CRUNCHY GREEN ONIONS NOM NOM NOM. This is like a whole different dish than what most people think of as ramen. It is worth waiting for, and the cost is minimal for how much porky creamy deliciousness you get in one of those bowls. I couldn't finish the whole bowl, even though I was instantly addicted to it and would have happily bathed in the rich pork broth had the bowl been a little bigger. I'll be back, Daikokuya. I'm simply helpless before your awesomeness.

Favorite Ramen place! It is always packed and have to wait for 20~40minutes but I don't care! You can go to the store near by and get some snack while your waiting if you are really hungry. Service is fast and efficient. Their noodle never over cooked and broth is very flavorful. Very thick and a lot of flavor  'Kotteri" type of broth. Their noodle is the little curly ones. I wish they have the straight noodle, too. Their homemade dumplings "Gyoza" is also very good. Little crunchy on the outside. Can't wait to go back again!

Our small group was wandering around Little Toyko when we started discussing food. We'd eaten an early lunch and it was around 4pm and were starting to get hungry. Our friend wanted ramen so I Yelped the highest-rated place around, and came up with Daikokuya which was only a block away. We went over, put our name in, saw it was Cash Only, walked across the street to the ATM, walked back, waited a few minutes while looking at the menu in the window, and were finally seated. I can only imagine how insane it must get during busy times. But at 4:30 on a Saturday afternoon, it was bustling but not overwhelming. I'd made my mind up right away that I wanted to order the Daikoku Ramen with kotteri flavor which is basically liquid bacon. First off, we ordered a pitcher of Kirin for $11 which was a really good deal as we got about 6 full glasses out of the pitcher and they charge $2.50 per glass otherwise. When my bowl came out I could barely see through the opaque broth but oh man did it smell amazing. I almost cried when I took my first few sips. It was rich but not overwhelming. It was so flavorful and just incredible. I don't even remember how the noodles or meat tasted as I was so fixated on that incredible broth! Our friend had the Shredded Pork Bowl and let me try some. Oh man was it good! If I wasn't so enamored with my pig broth I would've totally ordered that instead. My wife had their spicy tuna rolls and an order of edamame and she wasn't totally in love with her food - but who cares because this is a ramen place, right?? And boy are they excellent at it. Can't wait to go back but can't imagine trying to park on a busy night anywhere nearby.

Parking and wait were horrible, even at about 3 - 4 PM on Friday. About an hour. Had the gyoza and the daikoku combos with the ikura and tempura. The gyoza meat was alright but the wrapping was pretty nice. The ikura was what you would expect, but the tempura was well fried. Got the daikoku ramen with kotteri broth, definitely flavorful and fatty. I liked it more than the normal broth, but both were very good.

With over 3,700 reviews there's not much I can say or suggest that hasn't already been talked about before! We all know the wait time for a table can be ridiculously long! We all know the ramen, gyoza, and those little sausages are delicious! We all know Daikokuya is a cash only establishment! Wait!!!! I just thought of something I can suggest that probably hasn't been suggested in the 3,700+ reviews that came before me! What you do is order their thinly sliced pork belly plate, order a side of hard boiled eggs, place the egg on top of a slice of PB, top that with Sriracha (and if you're OK with being booted out of the bedroom by your significant other, add some chopped garlic), roll the sliced PB around the egg and eat that son of a bitch in one bite. What you get is a huge mouthful of fatty, salty, spicy goodness. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… I knew if I thought hard enough I could come up with something new. If you haven't already, check out Daikokuya. Don't forget to try my pork belly wrapped hard boiled egg appetizer :)

I've been on a ramen kick lately...so I figured the best way to handle this is by hitting the best rated/reviewed spots in Little Tokyo. Apparently I'm not the only one that feels like hitting the best reviewed spots because the wait was over an hour each of the two times I've been there. I have had the house special each time and loved it! I also had a spicy tuna roll and was impressed...they serve a handful of beers (including Asahi) and it is cash only...but they do have a rather interesting ATM machine out in the back.

I'm not a huge ramen fan, so I shall review the other staple here:  The Shredded Pork Bowl. The Shredded Pork Bowl will change your life.  It will take you to a higher place.  It will teach you to read Arabic.  It's just delicious and pretty self explanatory.  If you like rice, pork and green onions, you will go gaga over this bowl bowl. Tips: - The wait is crazy here.  At peak hours, expect to queue up for about an hour (depending on how large your group is).  There are 4 tables here that can sit 4 comfortably.  If you have 5 or 6, expect to cram it in there and they will slap a stool at the end of the table.  This stool seat is rather awkward with people constantly walking around you.  If you are a loser like I am and come here alone all the time, you can usually find a seat at the bar for one even when it's busy. - Cash only, no take out.  If you can't finish your food, they have boxes for you to take your leftover food.  I have not tried just sitting down and ordering and then asking for a box for the food and leaving, but technically I presume this is allowed.  Or you might get yelled at. Caveat Emptor, pal. Practically an institution in Little Tokyo, you won't be disappointed after your meal.

Everyone knows that if you want a good bowl of Daikokuya ramen, you need to go to the one in Little Tokyo. Be aware that free parking is hard to find and you will have to wait. I only come here when I take public transportation or when I'm in the area to do something else. There is pretty much no arguing that their ramen is good. The flavor of the broth is excellent, the noodles are done right, the chashu is tasty, and the bowl is pretty big. The one complaint that I have is that I prefer my bean sprouts to be cooked a bit. They pretty much serve them raw as they as extremely busy and just trying to knock out the bowls as fast as they can. I usually get my bowl as a combination with the ikura rice bowl. Bring cash and your patience. They don't accept credit cards here and the typical wait will be at least an hour. But it is this Yelper's opinion that it is definitely worth the wait!

Heavenly food with a hellish wait. There's not a lot that one can say without mentioning that the wait can be anywhere from half an hour to an hour and a half. That's how popular this place is, and that's how amazing the food is as well. With this much business, it's not like you can't afford to process a credit card. Seriously. This is why I spend most of my money at Orochon or Shinsengumi. Daikokuya's tonkotsu is off the chain, but I'm happier to have a shorter wait and not have to worry about carrying cash around. That being said, I still come here about once a year. Their ramen is absolutely amazing, but the remainder of their dishes are rather lackluster. There's nothing special about them. They're made well, but really, there's no other reason to come here than the ramen. If you aren't a ramen fan, don't waste your time.

I work right down the street so when I want a good combo of  ramen and a small unagi bowl, I make sure to show up right when it opens.  I do this to avoid the crowds and long wait that has gotten to  be ridiculous as this place has gained popularity over the last few years. There is booth seating as well as counter space (where it can get hot due to the proximity of the stove and pots).  You show up, put your name on a list and wait until you are called.  It might be 15 minutes, but it might also be over an hour. I definitely like the broth and the chewiness of the noodles, as well as the aforementioned rice bowls with various toppings, and the gyoza are pretty good too. A good place to have a meal at any time of the day, but I would skip it if you see too many folks snapping their own picture out on the sidewalk, as that is a sure sign its going to be a long long wait.

Since I found the less-clusterfy location in Arcadia, I haven't been back to the original restaurant in Little Tokyo. But a friend was visiting from out of town, so we decided to have her experience the REAL THING. Kotteri broth, as always, freaking savory and delicious. So thick and heavy and nom, amazing. Main reason for updating my review - I want to remember and share that they go through about 20 parties per hour! (Makes sense, assuming each group takes ~30 minutes to eat, and they have seating for about 10 parties inside.) We put our names down (they were calling number 10, we were number 30) at around 11:50am and sat at 1pm.

Definitely my favorite Ramen place of all, this location and in Monterey Park both make it just as delicious. It's a small place but you're not there to party so it shouldn't be a problem, I think. There's a waiting list since it's busy most days. Wait is usually around 30 min even if they say more. Eh, gives you time to explore Little Tokyo shops across the street. Honestly wouldn't choose any other place to have it if I'm the one planning a Ramen night period. I'd rather not be disappointed elsewhere.

If you're looking for a good meal at a decent price in a great location this is your spot !! Daikokuya is probably my favorite place for ramen. A friend recommended this place to me about 6 years ago and I have been coming here ever since then. I've tried other ramen places but so far none of them compare. The wait can get ridiculously long but that just shows how good this place is if people are willing to wait over an hour for it. I usually order the Daikokuya Ramen with Kotteri broth which gives it a richer flavor. It comes with a soft boiled egg, scallions, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, and slices of pork.  For those that are really hungry and want more than just ramen, I suggest ordering a combination meal which comes with a small salad and your choice of rice bowl.

Yeah yeah - I know it's about the noodles - it's about the aromatic broth.  Usually we would state the obvious in this review, but in this case - I'd rather talk about the lowlights.  Two things come to mind: The Kurobuta pork sausage and The Special Fried rice.  Exceptional, Devine and sometimes Misunderstood.  Vegans beware, vegetarians cover your ears this is not for the faint of heart.  These dishes are soo flavorful you would think that they could out shine their older brother (not really).  In all seriousness I'm addicted, there's no stops - no pauses - I continue to consume and chew and consume and chew.  Domo arigato!

The wait can be endless!!! So my sisters told me so much about this place and how great it is, so we waited about an hour and a half until we got seated. First of all, the ramen ranges from $8-5000. [Not literally, but it's about $17 or so]. Beef bowl, or bowls in general are around.. I believe $7-$15. Depending what you get. Their appetizers are very small portions. It'll cost you $5 for what... 4 pieces of dumplings the size of your pinky? Their food is rather tasty, but I'm not crazy about it. Ramen is very creamy and the bamboo shoots have flavor. The Beef bowls are good too. Credit card minimum is $10. DON'T GET DRINKS HERE [other than alcoholic beverages] because the drinks are not worth it. Tasteless, bland and expensive. Service is rather good. You can see the chefs in the kitchen because the place is so cramped, you literally feel like you're eating with everyone in the restaurant as one big happy, ramen eating family on Thanksgiving. The chefs can be scary though, especially when they shout Japanese greetings? or words whenever a customer comes in or leaves. Hahha Overall, I would have to give them a 3 star because a good experience, but it wasn't great.

Alright, so on a rare occasion I wake up at 5 in the morning feeling strongly about a place to write a review about my experience at a food joint, and let me tell you- the taste in my mouth from this place went from sour to a heaving belch, in an eye blink. I see all the good reviews and wonder why does a place like that how so much of a following?  Exactly that- the place is full of FOLLOWERS, your pretentious disgusting LA douchebags and maxipads all in Asian forms.   Ater the 3 hour wait outside with these mongrols- we were seated in a shit hole with beat up furniture and god only knows how clean those utensils were. We ordered the "OH MY GOD THIS IS THE BEST RAMEN IVE HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE" yes it is bitches, because you've been standing in the freezing cold and need some source of heat to warm you up- I would compare this to being pissed on after getting stung by a jellyfish... The ramen was luke warm, boiled eggs were disgustingly cold, and honestly, after really taking it all in, it was nothing compared to the Maruchan and Top Ramen someone could make at home and put their own ingredients in. Chop up some green onions, mushrooms, and garlic people. Come on... cold boiled eggs in luke warm soup?  And the magical broth?  It's water that's been sitting in a pot of old pig bones for days, where it has been deteriorating... you can taste the rotting flesh if you realize what it is. The workers are quick, because they don't want you to realize any of this... So my complaint is not about the service, simply the food and the people you are forced to eat it around... I'm going to be straight forward.  Place is seriously disgusting.  Ramen?  HA.  The atmosphere and people, are the lowest grade you'll find in Los Angeles.  Take your business to Kuraku or some other food joint on that strip.  Don't let these douchebags dictate what you eat and how long you wait for it- trust me, go there once and you'll realize, oh shit, that Yelp guy was right... I'd rather get pissed on. So with all that said, my honest to god, bottom of my heart recommendation to fellow foodies- true foodies, not food truck douchebags- AVOID AVOID AVOID.

Just. Wow. Never have I had such a rich and flavorful broth for my ramen. I wasn't expecting too much from this place because I never was really a fan of japanese ramen. I enjoyed it. But nothing I obsessed over. And I've had Ippudo ramen in NYC and thought it was good at best. The noodles and the broth were a perfect combination. Usually with ramen, I have the noodles tasting like just noodles and the broth tasting like the broth. But here, the daikokuya ramen was a perfect symphony of both broth and noodles. I also had the unagi don which I could not finish (the ramen portion is HUGE) but was just delicious as well. I probably could have just had the unagi don as one meal or half the ramen bowl. One thing I should mention is that the broth, while it is a wonderful and holds the addicting component that keeps on drawing people again and again, can be a little overwhelming after a while. Halfway through the bowl, I started to feel the onset of the feeling of disgust. But worth the hour-ish-long wait. I cry.

My only experience with Raman prior to this place was in the form of dried square packets and cups. Every time I made the stuff I ALWAYS burned my mouth on the damned things. So, I came here with a friend in hopes of having a non-mouth burning experience. Everything I'd heard about this place was it was crowded 7 out of 7 days, and there were always lines and loads of people there. Well, today there was a small crowd outside.  I pushed my way through the cloth-curtain thing in front of the door, and then walked in the front door, to put my name on the list. As I glanced at the list, I noticed that there were only 5 or 6 boxes that hadn't been scratched out. Extra bonus, the person who wrote her name on the list ahead of me gave up on the place and walked away. So with hope in a short wait, I went out to talk with my companion.     After some conversation, we moved inside to wait. It's not a big place, and people are stuffed wall-to-wall. We felt we could hear them call our name easier from there.  After a five-to-ten or so minute wait, the Asian guy screamed out my name, and gestured to two open seats at the "bar" type area. I picked up the menus and handed one to my friend, who took it and we began to flip through it. We had had an opportunity to peruse the menu quickly while waiting for the name calling. I figured their specialty was a good place to start. So I went with the raman specialty bowl. My lunch friend Gloria ordered the Chicken Teri Bowl.  We looked around and observed people to figure out how to eat the things that were going to be delivered to us.      Waitress came over and placed a pair of those slurpee-spoon things in front of us.  Gloria's Teri bowl apparently had a soup and salad portion.  Which she graciously let me try. They were quite tasty.  My Raman bowl arrived as her Teri bowl did. I fiddled with chopsticks for a bit, but I fear I may have hit Gloria with noodle or sauce, as she politely asked the waitress to get me a fork.  I didn't feel so bad about as I saw a family sitting on the other side of the bar eating with forks.     The Raman was far superior to anything I had made on my own. The noodles were soft, the broth was good. There was even a weird lookin egg in it. It was an odd brown color. Gloria suggested it was a duck egg. I tried it and it was OK. As I read the menu, it's a marinated boiled egg. I shared Raman with Gloria, and she shared Chicken Teri with me.  Both were good.      Neither of us could finish our massive servings before us, and we flew the flag of defeat and asked for the check. Two bowls with tax and tip were about twenty bucks.  Not bad at all. Thankfully, I had a $20 in my wallet to pay for it, as this place only takes cash. Their menu was reasonably priced, and had a multitude of things I'd like to go back and try.     All in all I thought the place was a solid okay. The wait, & cash only factors each took off a star in my eyes. If I'm ever back in that area, I'll give it a shot again, depending upon the size of the mob in front of the place. It was pretty good, but certainly not good enough for an hour wait.

Kotteri Daikoku Ramen VS. Regular Daikoku Ramen Kotteri is the clear WINNER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! * Kotteri Daikoku Ramen (5 of 5) - A good broth is so important to a good ramen. In this comparison, I could clearly taste the kotteri texture and the taste truly extended the ramen's potential. Simply having the kotteri to the ramen broth, made it taste so much richer and fattier and flavorful.   * Regular Daikoku Ramen (3 of 5) - The broth was a lot clearer and lacked texture. When eating it with the noodle, it tasted more bland and I truly regretted not ordering TWO kotteri daikoku ramens. * add on fried rice to the ramen $11.50 (3.5 of 5) - My fried rice was tasty, but a little too watery in the rice department. If it was a little drier, than I wouldn't feel like it was so soggy. * add on shredded pork bowl to the ramen $11.95 (4 of 5) - Melt in your mouth shredded pork goodness. Delicious texture and beautiful piece of pulled pork. Too bad the sauce covering it was too sweet and too salty for my taste even with the complimenting rice. None the less, it was beautiful piece of pork shred. Pretty yummy ramen house in LA. Really quite decor and old japanese poster ads at this location. Apparently, there are many locations. I wouldn't mind visiting other locations next time in LA. However, no more regular daikoku ramen for me. Only KOTTERI DAIKOKU RAMEN is the way to go!

This is the place to eat at when its 1. rainy 2. you are going through the first stage of morning after hangover.... I have to say it might be the best cure beside coconut water for your stomach and your head ache...so come here if you feel like eating ramen or just need a cure to your headaches :) There's not many ramen choices to pick from, but the portion is HUGE so get a small bowl if you can;t finish it, cuz the leftover ramen doesnt really taste good the next day. I suggest to try their chicken rice bowl, the rice bowl has all source of stuff,veggie, meat and all those japanese ingredients, Overall it is just delicious. The best location for Daikokuya is the first one in little tokyo, I don't really recommend the one in Monterey park, because it just doesn't taste as good as the one in little tokyo. So if you are trying Daikokuya for the first time, go to the one in little tokyo, there might be a wait but it is definitely worth it! The first time I tried it at little tokyo, I stood in line for 2.5 hours....and it was worth it!

Came here after watching the Lakers dominate the Utah Jazz a few weeks ago. YEAH! Waited about 30 minutes, so I assume it was really good. (It was 10:30 P.M. at night. I'm sure the wait is way longer during lunch or dinner.) It was honestly okay. I wouldn't wait more than 20 or 30 minutes, nor would I come all the way to LA just to eat here. It's a good place to go if you live in LA, but it's definitely not worth waiting for more than 20 minutes or so. I heard some people wait ridiculously long, like 1 or even 2 hours! Please don't. It's not THAT good. I also read that the pork belly is good, but it was also just okay. Nothing very special. Location is small like most ramen places. I always wondered why ramen restaurants are so damn tiny..... I guess it's culture? IDK. Overall, 3 stars. decent ramen, but not worth a trip to LA or waiting long hours.

Best ramen in town.  The egg in the ramen with a spoonful of broth is my favorite bite of the dinner.  Best fried rice in town.   Despite the wait, they get people in and out pretty efficiently, without making anyone feel rushed.  So, if you're willing to stick with them through that wait (you should be willing), you get treated like a paying customer and not a burden once you're sitting down.   Ultimately the food is what earns the grade.

With the extremely long wait times everyday, even on weekdays, you can just tell how good Daikokuya is. I am giving it a five stars based on the fact that it was honestly the best ramen I've tried, but food wise, I've had better food. Although the bf LOVES the tonkusu ramen, I personally favor the miso ramen more and absolutely love the katsudon more (the egg over chicken and rice). There is just something about this that makes it so great. I know I know, it's a ramen place, and I am supposed to be eating ramen instead of a rice bowl, but try it, and you will understand what I am talking about. ITS SO GOOD. The prices are great as well, especially the sets that you can easily share between two people. At around 13-14 dollars, you can get a big down of ramen, with a small chicken/beef/ or eel rice on the side. After trying the chicken and the eel, the chicken is hands down still my all time favorite. I actually dont remember having better tonkatsu elsewhere. Parking and wait is probably the worst part about Daikokuya, and in fact, its a complete nightmare almost. You certainly have to circle around at least 5-6 times to finally find parking, and most likely, it's a bit of a walk. The wait at dinner time is usually at least 40 minutes to an hour even on weekdays, so expect to come here before 6pm if you want to avoid the traffic. Overall, even with the horrendous wait and parking, this restaurant is well worth it. Even in NYC, I havent had ramen better than Daikokuya. True story. FYI: It's cash only!

I'm not sure if this place has been around forever or if they've just decided to go with the flow of the diner feel of the layout, but when I walked in I felt like I'd just gone through a time-warp of some sort.  Red booths, a counter to sit at with stools, a slightly grimy feel, quirky 1950's style signs in Japanese.  I was charmed, even before the meal began.   Their basic daikoku ramen is comforting and creamy in a meaty way.  The fresh noodles in the ramen are chewy and doughy.  I could have gone for a bit stronger pork flavor in the broth so next time I'll order the kotteri version.  The sliced pork meat was very tender--such a rarity for ramen in this town.  I also tried the gyozas.  They were seared perfectly on the outside, and the meat mixture inside had lots of flavor. The habitually long wait at this place makes perfect sense to me.  Cash only.

This was my third visit at Daikokuya and my first review.  If  I reviewed based on my first two visits, it would be higher.  The novelty and hype was great.  All who have rated before me have highlighted what's great about Daikokuya. But, as my taste preferences have changed, I don't enjoy it as much. The reason I knock Daikokuya  is just my personal preference only.   I find the broth too seasoned (salty).  I also find the broth flavor too porky.  The noodles are perfect in texture.  I ordered the ramen combo + chicken egg bowl.  The chicken egg bowl although delicious, I find not very appealing visually.    That's just the way it's prepared I suppose.  Again, not my preference.  The combo is served with a salad which is excellent.  Very simple, its salad dressing and salad.   I'm sure you've heard by now, the wait is lengthy.  You just have to roll the dice and hope when you visit it's no too terrible. I agree, Daikokuya is a must try.  You must experience for yourself.

Can't believe I waited almost an hour for dinner! I'm staying at a hotel around the block from this place so we decided to walk over and check out what this amazing ramen place people from back home and telling me to go to. We wandered around the area for a bit and waited outside for about 50 minutes. Service was friendly, and quick. The food came out really fast. My salad had way too much dressing, but it still tasted okay. I got the spicy miso ramen. It was delicious! The broth wasn't too spicy. It was a pleasant spicy flavor, and it didn't burn my mouth, if that makes sense. The pork fell apart and was super soft and fatty. My friends and I were a little upset that the eggs weren't quite soft-boiled. I'm not sure if they were supposed to be since they were not all the way hard boiled, but they weren't soft either. Other than the egg, I LOVE THIS PLACE. I'm so sad I live in San Jose and won't be able to eat here more often!):

With a good amount of mixed reviews on this place, I came here kind of cautious and prepared to wait. Came on a Saturday afternoon at around 3 pm for a party of 3, and the wait was still at least 45 minutes. The good thing is that this is located right across from Little Tokyo, so we went and ventured around there in the meantime. We all ordered the Daikokuya Ramen kotteri style, per recommendation of the waitress. I LOVED the pork broth! Super flavorful! And they definitely don't skimp on the noodles. My friends, however, weren't quite as in love with it as I was. I think it might just depend on what kind of ramen you normally prefer. I like tonkotsu the best (which is what is served here), but my friend favors tan tan men ramen. Since the Daikokuya ramen is much, much different from the tan tan men style of ramen, which is spicier and meatier, my friend was just not that impressed. So come in with the realization that you are getting an amazing PORK broth ramen, and maybe it'll make a difference in how much you like it! The chashu was delicious. Very tender and full of flavor. The egg, on the otherhand, was a huge disappointment. It was cooked through and there was nothing special about it at all. I prefer soft boiled eggs in my ramen, or if it is gonna be hard boiled, at least be marinated. But while the egg was a disappointment, it didn't hinder me from enjoying my soup! Unlike other ramen places I've been too, there isn't much in your bowl besides the broth, noodles, egg, bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, and green onions. You get more options to add things to your bowl at other restaurants. Not a good thing or a bad thing, just something I noticed. FYI, they serve half size bowls of their ramen, in case you don't think you can finish a whole bowl! It's 2 or 3 dollars less than the regular size. Would definitely come back, even with the ridiculous wait.

I came here on a weekday and the wait was so bad :( I think it's cause we were so hungry. When we were finally seated, we ordered the famous one with the big picture on the menu then inhaled the noodles. I think the food didn't take that long. Broth was really rich. Personally I'm not a ramen person. My sister's been singing about ramen because she watches ramen eating competitions and she's been having ramen cravings for days. She liked it but she's been wanting some spicy ones. Truthfully I don't think I'd go back just for the ramen cause the wait sucks and the restaurants is really tiny but that's because I'm not a ramen enthusiast. Shortly after I tried another ramen spot in Anaheim and I think that place was better cause they had a spicy one to balance out the richness of the broth. But that's just me

I love ramen, I'll eat it pretty much whenever I can.  I'll eat top ramen too...but as far as ramen places go, this is my favorite.  I also really like Santouka in Mitsuwa as well as Tsujita (the tsukemen there is pretty interesting) but of all the ramens, the KOTTERI RAMEN here is the best.  I generally get it on the side, which looks a bit gross but it really adds flavor.  I also add some garlic and shichimi (red powder spice) and it's to die for.  I've been here with friends and by myself.  The wait is a bit unfortunate, but just don't come during peak hours and a table is manageable. I used to live downtown so it was much easier to get to, and I really miss the ramen.  Make sure you get the kotteri!!!! What really makes this ramen delicious is that creamy tonkotsu broth with literally melt in your mouth chashu.  The noodles are cooked well, and the egg is nice and soft.  If you are near this place you must give it a try.  Maybe it's my taste preferences, I love salty, creamy, flavorful ramen - this place is not for the faint of heart (because kotteri will probably give you a heart attack) or those who prefer lighter ramens.

I've been to many Ramen-ya's but this place was ok.  The Gyoza was different; in a good way, the ramen broth was a tad bit on the salty side for me.  Service?  For a small place, they could've been much more attentive.  Since I happened to be around the LA area, thought I'd try this Ramen joint since it had such high reviews.  Ma ma...

After having ramen at Ajisen, Tamaya, Wakasaya, What's Up Men, and Yamadaya, this is my all time, soul-warming ramen experience. The broth is umami made with pork bones and kotteri or pork back fat (so it's rather a milky broth as opposed to a clear broth), egg noodles have great bouncy texture (as opposed to the wheat flour noodles found in most ramen), and ajitsuke tomago or soft-boiled egg is marinated with enough flavor as to distinct itself from the broth even though it's drowning in there. Portions are very generous. I'm never able to finish a bowl to myself even with no sides and on an empty stomach. It's clean and simple, but perfected. All this goodness for $8. The only downfall is waiting in line for up to 1/2 hour depending where you are in line. I think it's plenty worth it; just grab a friend and chat it up under their bright yellow awning. Once you're inside the cozy little shack full of slurpers, you'll forget about everything else.

This is one of my favorite ramen places! Every time I'm in LA I have to come here. The last time I was in LA I stayed at Miyako which is literally right IN FRONT of Daikokuya, so every time I looked out the window I would see the long ass line from the moment they open to the moment they close there is ALWAYS a line. Is it worth the wait? Yes most def! They have the most savory & most flavorful broth ever. Not to mention the BEST ingredients. From the noodles to the pork belly to the egg. The egg was perfect beyond words! I love when the egg is soft boiled. (: My faves. Tip: put your name down, go across the street to the japanese village mall, get some mochilato,, go to mitsuru, or get some macarons at 'lettte as you wait! Dessert before meal, anyone? Oh! & CASH ONLY!

Daikokuya is super hyped in socal. It's definitely a Ramen place you must check out if you're ever in LA. I had the Gyoza to start and the Daikoku Ramen. The Gyoza were pan fried and sooo delicious, I would go back just for these! The Daikoku Ramen consisted of tonkotsu based soup, egg noodles, boiled pork, kurobuta pork belly chashu, marinated boiled egg, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts and green onions. OMG this broth was amazing, so savory and flavorful. I think my final check to see if a broth is good is to wait and see if I get thirsty afterwards... gladly I didn't. The pork belly chashu was so tender, it practically melted in my mouth. The marinated boiled egg tasted like it was soaked in the broth overnight to soak up as much flavor as possible. The ramen here is really something you need to experience for yourself. Try to arrive early in the day, the wait can get pretty long if you come around peak lunch/dinner hours. Don't forget, its CA$H ONLY!

This is going to be simple. Yes, there's a wait, don't get in line if you don't wanna wait. It's some of THE best ramen I've ever had. Every time I've been, the food always came out fast and was delicious.  I usually get Daikoku Ramen with Kotteri and Kattemen(?) and everything, including the egg, is cooked very well. I'm sorry if you've had bad experiences here but I'm sharing my honest experiences about this place, which have so far only been good. All in all, I think everybody should try this place out, even if it's just once!

Do not believe the hype. This place USED to be the best ramen around.. 2-3 years ago. Now it's just completely overcrowded and doesn't have nearly as good a broth as it once did. I just came over from an eye appointment 15 minutes before opening and there was already a line of 2 dozen or so people.. At 11am.. People are waiting for ramen.. That is ridiculous. So I get in, order my dish - Daikoku Ramen +Tuna Sashimi Bowl - And let me tell you, that sashimi was SOOOOO.. average. Average is the perfect word for this place. It's the average amount of quantity sashimi. Average broth. Average everything. ...Ok, not everything; their salad is kind of ridiculously good.. But I'm not here for salad bro's n ho's. I want RAMEN. Bottom Line: If you haven't had the traditional ramen thing before, you'll probably like it. You won't think it's the greatest thing ever, and will probably be pissed by how long you had to wait. P.S. - Take note that this place is cash only and be prepared to bring it over to Fugetsu-Do a few shops over for some white/red bean mochi, because you'll be starving before you even get a seat! But if you want ramen.. and I mean ramen.. Get your chopsticks over to Santouka in Torrance. You'll thank me later. Seriously.

The problem with having to wait for 1.5 hours to eat is that by the time you get a table, you're beyond famished. The problem with eating when you're famished is that you basically inhale your food without really tasting it with an unbiased stomach. So basically it was impossible for Daikokuya to taste bad for me. Since free streetside parking for Daikokuya was impossible, my friends (who thankfully go to school in LA and know their way around parking problems) parked in a plaza close to Daikokuya and had their parking validated by the Starbucks in the plaza whose employees already knew we were in there not for caffeine but for a validated ticket. Visitors to Little Tokyo, I suggest you do the same. After putting our names on Daikokuya's ridiculously long waitlist, my friends and I proceeded to wait in a Japanese convenience store two doors down for 1.5 hours before we got an available table in this ramen joint. Feeling guilty about our Thanksgiving holiday diet, one of my friends and I decided to split a ramen combo (Daikoku Ramen + Small Salmon Roe Bowl). Small Salmon Roe Bowl (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) - I love salmon roe, and Daikokuya heaped that roe on! The roe was perfectly salty and gushed with juicy flavors. I could've eaten a giant bowl of this if I didn't have some ramen to attend to. Daikoku Ramen (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) - I'll admit, this ramen was quite tasty. The tonkotsu broth (which is what I always get if it's available) was thick and full of that fatty, flavorful goodness. The pork melted in my mouth and was very tender. Portions were huge and my friend and I felt extremely full just eating half a bowl of this ramen each. However, I wish the noodles had a chewier texture since I like chewy noodles. But whatever, the broth made up for that shortcoming. So, why do I dock one star off? Honestly, with all that hype surrounding this ramen, I was prepared to taste the best ramen of my life. Don't get me wrong, I liked the Daikoku Ramen very much, but it was simply not worth the wait. Come here only if the wait is 40min or less. Anything more than that decreases the value of the ramen since by 1.5 hours later your starving stomach would find any average ramen spectacular.

The ramen here was ok and not as amazing as I got my hopes up to be. It was delicious on a cold rainy day but it didn't give me goosebumps on how delicious it was. The pork belly was not a generous portion for myself and my ramen wasn't as hot as I wished it would be after such bad weather. The hard boiled egg was extremely cold on the inside after a single bite into the yolk so that was a weird combo for the ramen bowl for myself. The service was awesome. Everyone was so friendly and really worked hard to let us enjoy our meals but at the same time keep the flow of customers moving. We literally came here at 10:30am, 30 minutes before opening and decided to run a quick errand and returned back at the restaurant at 10:58am. There was a line forming already outside the door and so we waited for the restaurant to open at 11:00am in the line. When we shuffled our way inside once it opened, we 55min until we were able to get seated even when coming when it immediately opened. I guess it was a Saturday but I'm still surprise of the wait even when coming right when it opened.

Super delicious! I came here with a friend at about 6pm on New Year's Eve. I wasn't super hungry when I showed up so I put my name down and wandered around for 45 minutes before coming back. We got ourselves a booth and 2 kotteri daikokuya ramen bowls. The kotteri broth is very rich. Noodles are thin wavy noodles, similar to Orenchi in the Bay Area. It came with a soft boiled egg, and I was kind of hoping it would be still liquid on the inside but I'm guessing Daikokuya's style is solid but partially cooked. The pork literally melted in my mouth. Overall, I would say the ramen here is more rich than flavorful, but still pretty good and worth a visit. I still like Orenchi better though!

Now I've never had ramen in Japan, but I have had it all over the world and Daikokuya is the only place I call home. The wait can be long, but it's worth it. FOOD: 5 stars When you have a broth this good (prepared at an "undisclosed location"), there's really no need to offer 3-5 other brothers. If you don't mind a little more fat, ask for the KOTTERI FLAVOR. I did a test between this and the normal broth and it was noticeably richer in flavor. The chashu is soft and tender, the noodles are the right amount of sponginess, the egg is hot on the outside and cool on the inside, and everything just seems as it was meant to be. Last time I also got a side of the new CITRUS STEAK RICE BOWL and it was pretty good. Flavorful with a nice citrus ponzu sauce. SERVICE: 4 stars The Japanese have always been known for their service. Although this place seems kind of like a hole in the wall, I cannot recall every being disappointed or unhappy with the service. Servers are attentive, patient, and cheerful. They are always in a hurry, but they should be when there's a long waiting list anyways. No complaints. AMBIANCE: 3.5 stars The place is full of historic advertisements from Japan around the 1940s and 50s. Westernized Japan. Colorful and culturally. Plus the yellow awning outside is unmistakable. In spite of their small size they managed to squeeze in a small waiting area to go with their booths and counter.

Fantastic. Not much I can add that others have not. The wait was about 1.5 hours, but you can leave once you put down your name. This is useful is you've just arrived to Little Tokyo, a superb area to visit anytime you are in LA and want something different, fun and easy. You can usually find parking between 7 and $10 here. The most you have to walk is 2-4 blocks distance. In the Village, you'll find pastries, boba, tea and coffee, and free entertainment, often. Once you are granted access, the food does not take long. The portions are huge, so come hungry. The ramen here is great, I agree with the consensus. It is not my favorite, preferring Hakata Shin-Sen-Gumi. However, the broth here is wonderful. The noodles were a bit hard for my taste, but I hear you can have them made more tender. The flavor of the broth is very savory, with sesame, pork fat, green onion, and other flavors coming together. The side salad is simply fantastic for such simplicity. The Kotteri was indeed a nice complex melange of flavors. The shredded pork bowl is great, delicious. I prefer the ramen hands-down however and found myself hardly able to eat both. It's a small cramped spot, but well worth it. The wait isn't bad at all. It's cheap. Keep groups to a 4 person minimum. They have beer, just the Japanese regulars.

The hubby and I took an impromptu ride on the Amtrak down to Union Station and strolled over to Little Tokyo in LA.  After walking around and finding unique items in the shops, it was time to have a delicious dinner.  There were so many choices for dinner!  Where was the best place to go?  Then, an idea came to me: CALL ONE OF THE RAMEN MASTERS!!  I decided to text Cathy S. because she is very familiar with the L.A. area.  She responded in a flash with three choices, but Daikokua topped her list.   The eatery filled up fast, and was full by 5:30PM.  We waited for about a half hour, but the flavors were well worth it!  We both got their Special Tonkotsu Ramen.  The noodles were cooked to the perfect texture and the broth was rich, creamy and earthy.  The pork was tender and savory.   http://www.yelp.com/biz_… We shared an order of "Tsukemono" Japanese Pickles that included selections of daikon, cucumber and takuwan radish with shiso leaves.  Very interesting and delicious.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_… I liked that they had shredded garlic available as a condiment at the table.  The service was friendly despite how busy they were.   This Ramen stop is not to be missed on your next visit to L.A.  But please take note, they don't take credit cards!  Cash Only over here.  And they don't accept to-go orders.  Strange, but I figure they get really busy and have limited space, so they concentrate on their dine-in guests.

I really wanted to try this place because people had hyped it up to me as being the best ramen EVER, but it was hard for me to get my Westside friends to trek east to Little Tokyo. One Saturday afternoon, I decided to just go to Daikokuya by myself, and me being a solo diner helped me get a seat easily in this busy restaurant with a small dining area. (If you have a large group, I wouldn't go here.) I got the ramen bowl, and I loved the broth. It was really flavorful. The meat was good too, but I wasn't that impressed by the noodles. I once went to a ramen shop in New York where they made the noodles from scratch, and I suppose I expected similar noodles due to all of the hype. The noodles at Daikokuya tasted like noodles that I could get anywhere else. After I finished my meal, I paid my inexpensive bill (cash only) and I left. My initial reaction was that Daikokuya was overhyped, but after tasting bland ramen bowls at other Japanese restaurants, I realized that Daikokuya really did have something special going on. Their broth was really unique, and I definitely want to go back there for a second try.

Tourist trap.  This is not the best ramen in LA, not even in Little Tokyo. If you had Ippudo NY and want to see what LA has to offer, this is not it.  If you had ramen in Japan and want to relive that wonderful memory, run you fools. The broth lacks the rich pork flavor tonkotsu ramen is known for.  Instead of a thick broth made from boiling pork bones, fat and collagen over a long period of time, the soup is over-compensated with salt and lard.   The noodle is the biggest disappointment.  It is obvious that they source from the same machine manufactured, packaged noodle one can find in Japanese supermarkets.  As a ramen establishment, they really should make their own noodle in house, if not made fresh daily. The portion is generous, the chashu are fatty cuts and have lots of flavor.  The toppings of chashu, bamboo shoots and flavor eggs are better than the broth and noodle.  I would have expect the other way around if I had the choice.  The side dishes, especially the tonkatsu bowl is perhaps the highlight of the menu.   In my humble opinion, the most popular restaurant does not guarantee that it serves the best food.  Most visitors to LA have mistaken that Little Tokyo is the hub of the all the best Japanese restaurants.  I urge you to be skeptical and venture out of downtown LA in search of more authentic Japanese ramen establishments.

After hearing that I've lived in LA for more than 4 years but never been here before, my friends were horrified and decided we needed to go on an adventure to Little Tokyo. We went on a Saturday evening, got there at 5:15pm, and ended up looking for parking for a while. The wait was really long (around an hour and 20 minutes for a party of 3), but I was determined to try their ramen, and boy was it worth it! The food came out super fast once we sat down and ordered. I got the combo meal of Daikoku Ramen (Kotteri flavor all the way!) and shredded pork bowl. The combo also came with some shredded salad that was actually quite refreshing and tasty. The shredded pork bowl came with a sweet and salty sauce with a ton of green onion on top. Nice texture, though the sauce was a bit overwhelming. I only had time to take a few bites of the rice before my ramen arrived though, and what an experience that was! The kotteri broth was rich and fatty (literally--I could see and taste the tiny chunks of pork fat) and absolutely heaven in my mouth. The noodles were tender and chewy, the pork melted in my mouth, and the egg was perfectly cooked. What else can you ask for in a ramen bowl? And all that delicious food for only $13 dollars? So worth the drive and the wait. There was so much food that I ended up taking the shredded pork bowl home. I had it for lunch the next day, and it tasted as good as it did the day before. Definitely the best ramen I've had in LA, hands down. Will come back again, though I'll try to come during a not-so-busy time.

Worth the wait! Although the wait is lengthy you can walk around J-Town and be back in time for yummy ramen. I recommend having the Kotteri flavor added to your soup. It adds such a deeper rich flavor that the regular ramen doesn't have. I also recommend trying the gyoza and fried, very tasty!

My favorite at Daikokuya is the khoteri ramen -- meaning that they put extra pork fat in the broth. It's all warm fatty goodness. The broth is a tad too salty for my taste, but I kinda developed a liking for it. This restaurant is very small and very popular, so expect a long wait at meal times. Plus, it's a little stuffy and hot inside the restaurant, b/c there just so many ppl crammed inside a small space. B/c it's so busy, they don't prefer that you linger over your food, so eat quick and leave. Regardless, Daikokuya is still very trendy, and it will never be not busy at lunch and dinner.

It breaks me a bit to have to write this but Daikokuya's signature Daikoku ramen is not quite the bowl of ramen it used to be, even as its infamously long wait times have not subsided. On BOTH the last couple of times I've visited (both within the same month), I found the once gooey yolk of the ramen bowl's hard boiled egg now fully cooked to its core and even more surprisingly, cold. There is now also less of that excellent creamy Daikoku broth in the bowl but a bit too many bean sprouts than I remember having on many previous visits. I really hope that Daikokuya gets its act together soon....although the Daikoku ramen bowl is still a solid ramen experience, I have to say the diminishing quality of the bowl coupled with the long wait times have dented the value of the ramen you can from this place, especially with new ramen restaurant choices nearby.

Ramen was alright. I really like options for my ramen and this place only does one kind of ramen. (I like going to Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi for ramen because you can choose all kinds of extras for your ramen and can even decide on the strength of the soup base and the amount of oil). On the other hand, the shredded pork bowl and the chicken teriyaki bowl are AWESOME! My bf and I only come here for those bowls and not ramen. Service is prompt. There is usually a wait to be seated because the restaurant is on the smaller end and seating is limited.

This place is small so it gets full fast and is awful for groups. I like it because it is a simple menu but they do it well. The noodles always taste/feel like they have been sitting out. The broth is so flavorful and the hard boiled egg sops it up good. The pork is so tender that it barely holds together. You get this huge bowl and I eat ALL of it so I think it's a great deal. If the quality of noodle sways your choice, then go to Foo Foo Tei.

The first time I tried Daikokuya I was underwhelmed. Every time since, I've been blown away. Daikokuya makes some damn good ramen! The fatty pork broth, the molten egg, the cuts of pork, throw on a large heaping spoonful of garlic from the table and you've got yourself a great meal. Wait might get ridiculously long. Try to go during nonpeak hours. Good luck with parking. Street parking is hard to come by. Might as well fork over a few dollars and park in a lot.

Enjoying a fine sunny day, spontaneously embarking on a foodie adventure, I arrive at the doors of Daikokuya for an amazing lunch! Bringing my friend along, I noticed the thousands of reviews for this place on Yelp, overwhelmingly towering over every other restaurant. Good reviews, lots of customers, and located in the heart of Little Tokyo...I decided to give this place a try. Arriving around 12:30pm, the place was pretty packed for lunch. The interior has a very home-y feeling, with a very authentic Japanese touch. It wasn't too long before we got seated, and ordered some of their specialties. I ordered their Daikoku Ramen, while my friend ordered a bento box with the Chicken Teryaki and Vegetable Tempura. I was surprised that their bowls are pretty large compared to many other ramen houses I've frequented. The Daikoku Ramen was quite good, with a subtle broth, and large slices of pork. The boiled egg was boiled until the yoke was slightly cooked through...so it's like a semi-gooey-mostly-solid yolk. Good stuff! Also, the broth wasn't as salty as other places, so it didn't feel deadly drinking a bunch of it while enjoying the ramen. I would definitely make my way here again. Definitely a solid choice when deciding where to eat in LA!

This is definitely worth the hour+ wait so hang in there. The ramen, the shredded pork and a cold mug of beer will definitely help you forget that you just spent the evening standing on the curb waiting for noodles. It's a must try for Downtown visitors and locals.

extra back fat.  what the heck is that even?? Get the daikoku ramen with extra back fat though. It makes the soup a bit more oily but damn is it good. The flavor that comes out from the broth is insane. The pork belly chasu is one of the best ive had. It was so tender and juicy. The kirin pitcher is decently priced and good for two people. As good as the ramen was, i was slightly disappointed by the fried spicy tuna.It didnt really have much flavor and I was expecting the tuna to be less dry.

So here's the deal people: I am this one chick, who, believes it or not, sometimes complain that her piece of pork is too "porky." Yup. Promise. I wanted to go to Little Tokyo for two reasons: 1. take a picture of my husband's Japanese favorite restaurant from back in the day; 2. have lunch; And I did both, but not in this order. I decided early on that I wanted ramen, because damn it, I love noodles and L.A. is supposed to house some of the best in the country. I pulled out my phone, saw the name "Daikokuya", 3,600+ reviews, 4 stars.. SOLD! On a Friday around 2:30 pm, I had to wait for about 20 minutes to get a seat at the counter. Didn't bother me a bit, I had a book and was entertained anyway by everything that was going on around me. And the smells.... When I sat down, I opened the menu to discover that there was only ONE ramen dish available. With pork. Pork belly. &@&$^!, I thought. And immediately after that, I thought: Oh, who cares?!? I am sure it's going to be delicious. ****for the non-initiated (and I was one of them!)**** The menu states that you are about to devour (trust me, you will) kurobuta pork belly chashu. Say whaaaa? Kurobuta is basically the type of pork; Berkshire in English. Chashu is the type of preparation. Basically, braised until melt-in-your-mouth tender. ****You are welcome.**** Delicious doesn't even begin to make it justice. This bowl of luscious tonkatsu broth, creamy to perfection, was one of the best things I had all week. No, strike that. MONTH. Served with egg noodles, bean sprouts, bamboo shouts, marinated boiled egg, green onions and a sprinkle of sesame seeds, it was so fucking delicious that I forgot I was eating really fatty pork (I know, right? What is wrong with that?) and just slurped away like a maniac. And yes, the meat was porky, but in the most perfect way. I could have eaten another bowl if I had had no manners. Definitely worth the try. If not in Little Tokyo, in one of the other locations.

Pretty good! I love the kitsch Japanese decor. Old Japanese movie & advertisement posters on the walls. Service is fast. Appetizer - Tempura spicy tuna with shiso leaf was good, 3 stars. Raumen soup - was good, the rich broth was delicious, incredibly tender flavorable pork was really good! egg wasn't anything special though. The noodles were decent but I wasn't impressed with the noodles since I have had better in San Jose. Fun place to go for late night feed. I love that part of town.

Daikokuya has the porky porky porkiest broth of all. Be sure to ask for kotteri for extra pork factor. I'm not afraid to say that their broth, which is their signature, is the best I've ever had, but their noodles aren't exactly the best. They're mass-produced. And ultimately have nothing on Shinsengumi. Also, don't be lulled into getting NOT RAMEN. The pictures look great--they're so tempting--but don't do it. Get the ramen. Sure, the fried rice is good, and the shredded pork bowl is...actually not that great...at all...but just don't forget the main event should be ramen. I always get tempted into getting a side and sometimes even get just a totally different entree and I always walk out knowing that I'm an idiot. Don't waste the stomach space.

We have been on a Ramen craze for the last month or so and this was another spot we had to hit up. Before we left LA after our 3 day cruise, we knew we have to stop by this Ramen joint. This place is CASH ONLY...FYI. The restaurant has an authentic feel to it.  From the moment you walk through the door, you are greeted by all of the workers.  We sat down and ordered the specialty Ramen, Daikokya.  The bowl was very flavorful.  The bowl had everything that you need to complete a bowl of Ramen (chashu, egg, bamboo), I added corn because that is one thing I must always have in my ramen.  The broth was rich and thick.  The fatty oils of the broth lingered on your lips and you craved for more.  The flavor was very intense and I enjoyed every bit of it.  However, towards the end of the bowl, it started getting salty and I had to stop eating it.  Also, I didn't care for the noodles, it was too chewy for my preference. I wouldn't say that it was the best bowl of Ramen I ever had, but it definitely was not the worst.  I would definitely eat here again. 3.5 stars... Enjoy.

Did they just raise their prices?  I ate here a few days ago and their infamous Daikoku Ramen is now ($8.95). I'd recommend coming here during a weekday, if possible.  The wait time is significantly cut down from the weekend.  Expect to wait around 20 minutes if you come around 5 or 6pm!!  And the food comes out faster too :D For some reason, the broth tasted saltier this time.  Perhaps the broth isn't intended to be drank like water lol.  Nonetheless, it is so tasty. And NEVER compare ramen at a restaurant like this to ANY sort of dry packaged ramen.  The noodles here are tender, chewy, and have a nice slightly doughy-rameny texture to them. The near by metered parking is $2.00/ hr and if you don't mind walking a bit, you can find metered parking for $1.50/hr a few streets down.  We paid for 1.5 hrs and were able to finish dinner and walk around the Japanese Plaza and eat desserts!

There is always a wait here... but once you taste the porky broth- you will understand why! Located in the heart of Lil Tokyo, its hard to compare all the different ramen places to each other. (My fav is Asa in Gardena). This place wins for the richness but I prefer Shin Sen Gumi around the corner for the lighter ramen and a better shoyu egg. But I love the ambience here over Shin Sen which is too loud for this lil cranky lady! The gyoza here is also excellent. My tip about this place: get your name on the list and walk around the plaza across the way. Also its cash only so don't forget to stop by the atm first. Last tip, don't try the other ramens on this block: just wait, it will be worth it!

This is the most overrated misrepresentation for a  restaurant ever! Came here 3 times and the wait was over an hour long each time so I finally decided to put our name down for a party of two to see what the hype and long line was all about. After promising a table in one hour, It took almost two hours for a table. This place is small, and not very inviting. Hoping that the food would blow me away. It was so disappointing. The ramen was so salty, the noodles were soggy, and it gave both of us upset stomachs for the next few days. If they offered to comped me in the future, I would never go back. Absolutely a mistake........

This place is small and finding a parking space is a challenge in itself, that's why coming here via Metro Rail is worthwhile; it's just down the street from the Little Tokyo/Art District station.  The ramen is good, no complaints, but I think it's not worth the wait when you see lots of people standing outside.

This is a tiny little restaurant, but the ramen is AMAZING. The soup was very flavorful, the noodles were tasty, and the bowl was so big!

Eat It OR Beat It? **EAT IT!!** Late night... cold weather... long lines... and located just outside of Little Tokyo... sounds like Daikokuya! Personally, my favorite ramen is from Santouka, known for their salt ramen. Now, keep in mind, different regions in Japan have different recipes for ramen. The broth isn't as bold as Santouka's salt ramen but it's still delicious. Reminds me of Shin Shen Gumi... but BETTER! The portions are very generous here and my favorite part of my meal was the Japanese fried rice! mmm... oh and order their chicken bowl as well! The orders come in individually or in combos. CONCLUSION: If it's a cold late night and you're craving some ramen, Daikokuya is your spot! I say EAT IT!... but be ready to wait 35+ minutes or so... even at 11pm! Los Angeles = late night eaters!

Arguably the best tasting ramen place I've been. Went there on a Saturday night so the wait was super long--about 30-45 minutes, but it was well worth it. I had the Daikoku ramen and tempura appetizer and they were just heavenly. Even my native Japanese friend said it tasted pretty authentic. They also provide a garlic paste to add to the ramen, which gives it that perfect little boost of flavor. All in all, great tasting food. Only downsides are the wait and tiny interior.

It was a hot and sunny day in LA and guess what my friend and I were craving?! A steamy hot bowl of ramen! I'm so glad I found this place because it was delicious! We had to wait 30 minutes though...and when you're hungry, that is a no bueno.  However, coming from San Francisco and always going to the popular restaurants, I am used to the wait.   Daikokuya cannot be compared to Ramen Dojo, which is my favorite ramen place back in the bay. Daikokuya serves a more traditional ramen with tonkatsu soup base.  It was simple and delicious! I love the texture of the ramen noodles and the slices of chashu just melts in your mouth!   Service was very attentive and friendly! Next time I will try the shredded pork rice bowl as well!

Still my favorite ramen place in CA but taking one star off to reflect: (1) my ugly hard boiled egg for the second time.. with nail marks and chunks torn off like some hasty hands peeled it. (2) the two little slices of pork I got were each half fat. solid fat. Seated immediately at 5:45 on a Friday.. but shortly after the line started to grow!

3.5 stars for Daikokuya.  This place was pretty good, but didn't beat Ramen Dojo in San Mateo.  The plus side of this place is that portions are pretty big and can satisfy two ppl who aren't big eaters.  The broth was pretty tasty, but the meat was on the dry side.  I also thought they skimped a bit on the toppings, which brought this rating down a tad.  All in all, this place is worth going to, but if the wait is longer than 40 minutes..save your time and try something else.

Good food = lots of customers... hence the suuuuuuper long wait. But is it really worth it? Yup. The ramen makes up for it. So does the fried rice! Be sure to combo and get ramen + fried rice. I've heard a lot of people compare daikokuya to shin-sen-gu-mi but the fact is, they come from different areas of Japan. So you can't quite compare the two styles that way. Shinsengumi's seems to have lighter broth and thinner noodles. It just depends on preference, and for me, it depends on mood. Both are great but I must say that depending on what toppings you order with your ramen.

I've eaten ramen before, but I've never understood why anyone made a big deal out of it. Now I understand. This place is operating on a different level. The broth itself could cure me of any sadness, let alone hunger. I hear it's hard to get a seat (I was visiting from the Bay Area), but I came at lunchtime and immediately got a spot at the counter, being just one dude.

Came here for a late lunch on a Sunday, and boy, was the wait forever long. Waited around 40 mins before getting seated. Got the Daikoku ramen which was rich and flavorful (to me it was a little too heavy). I'll admit, it was really good ramen, but not one of the better ones I've tasted. It's a very simple ramen minus the heap of green onions, but I don't mind. I wish there were more bamboo pieces :( I'd love to come back to try their other dishes, but don't know if it's worth the wait. Oh, an cash only...which is kind of errrr...

Hungover.  Tired from the weekend.  Hungry.  Came here to revive with some friends.  Mission accomplished!  So hit the spot.  The ramen there is pretty damn good.  Not too salty, good broth(I added the back fat to the order, yes, back fat).  The only thing i'd have to say is that the noodles are more on the al dente side, which i didn't mind, but rather have it softer.  The amount of food you get was plenty! I'd go back in a heartbeat.

Let me be fair, the Ramen there are obviously superior to all other ramen I have been eaten. And I really love Ramen there. However, the drawbacks are several: 1. Always have to wait in a line, no matter when one comes. Usually, the waiting costs  30 mins-1hour. I'd rather encourage Daikokuya to raise the price up to 20 dollars per bowl of Ramen to make the waiting line much shorter. 2. The atmosphere is okay but kind of dirty 3. The serving staff are always too busy. In Short, great choice for Ramen. But unless ones has time to wait for at least 30 mins, Daikokuya is not a good choice.

Came back.  Waited about an hour for dinner on Friday.  It's helpful to go with one other person if you don't mind sitting at the bar - you'll get in much quicker that way. The ramen was about the same as last time, although the broth did seem to taste a bit richer.  The soft-boiled egg was much better done.   I also tried some of the pork katsu combo rice bowl, but I was disappointed that there was a lot of liquid sitting at the bottom.  Also made the fried layer on the pork soggier. Bottom line:  I stand by my earlier 3 star assessment.  And I really don't think it's worth the one hour wait.

I was in Little Tokyo on a weekday at 11:30am and for the first time ever the line for the place was not completely impassable.   That means that there were only 12 people in line in front of us instead of 30.   And a half an hour wait instead of an hour. Daikokuya is a little hole in the wall retro "ramen diner" which means it's like Cafe 50s but instead of having 1950s American decorations, it has 1950s Japanese decorations and a unique menu, though they are famous for the ramen (and have industrial sized pot behind the counter.     The ramen was pretty great, especially the pork, which was lovely and buttery.  I did find it to be a tad too salty, though.   The place is cash only and prices are reasonable.   With so many menu items to try, I want to say 80% of people were all eating the same thing:  their specialty, the ramen. Would it be worth it's usually wait time?   Possibly, but there are a lot of things to try in Little Tokyo.   To fulfill a ramen carving, you could also hit up nearby Orochan or Shin sen gumi.

This place is awesome. My hubby and I split a ramen & shredded pork bowl combo while rotating through all their appetizers. Their California rolls are surprisingly good. Way less busy for lunch. But always busy. Park at the Judge Aiso parking structure that's around the corner and just across the street. The best thing to do if it's busy is to drop off someone at the restaurant and get your name down.

Is there a conspiracy? Why are there so many reviews calling this the best ramen around?? I was so hyped up about this place having read all the great views from Boston, but after flying 8 hrs, waiting another hour in line, I'm disappointed to say it was not worth it. The ramen was 2 stars at best. There was only one option, their specialty, and it was nowhere near the places I've tried in the East Coast, especially Ippudo in NYC. The broth was not hot enough to my liking, barely luke warm. The egg was still cold in the middle. Ugh. 2 strikes. The pork was bland, the piece of fat was soft and did not taste good. Lastly, the bean sprouts were raw, and the not-so-hot broth was not enough to cook it. Another 2 strikes. The only good part was the noodle. I did like that. It was the right amount of chewiness. The other dishes here were good hence the 3 stars. The gyoza was meaty and delicious. The shredded pork bowl was also very good. That pork was definitely flavorful. If you are looking for delicious ramen, I would not recommend this place. Go to Ippudo if you can. THAT is life changing. If you are from the West Coast, too bad for you. Just kidding, make the trip to Misuwa near Santa Monica for Santouka. That is a lot better. In the end, I'm a little glad this wasn't amazing. Else I'd have to plan for a many cross-country trips to satisfy my craving. As if the frequent ramen runs to NYC aren't time consuming enough.

**This location is by far muuuuch superior in quality and taste and even customer service. So if you are craving Daikokuya, don't bother with anywhere else.*** Sorry Daikokuya, I really wanted to love you like all of my obsessed ramen junky friends...but you were just a solid Good, meaning I'd come back because I love food, but I wouldn't wait more than 15 minutes to eat you.   The Wait. I was on a date here on a random weekday night. Was already eating a late dinner at 8 ( 8 is late for me! For Asian food anyway) the wait was probably 35 minutes, which was all good because it gave me time to chat with him :D But hungry me at 8, was starving and cranky with a hole in her stomach by 8:35. The Food Finally sat down in a booth and ordered, he got a the signature while I ordered the tsukemen - which is the same thing, just with everything on the side, including the ramen- chilled. Ever since falling in love with authentic Italian food, I can't stand soft, soggy noodles, so I like my noodles al dente or with distinct chewyness at least. So I liked my noodles chilled. I'm not a ramen snob, so I can't tell you much about how tasty the soup base is, how you can taste distinct flavors of the pork bone, and fat, and essence, and yadayada. It was good. It tasted good. But I didn't see bright lights that usually indicates you're in heaven. Maybe I'd try something else next time, but... it's a ramen joint, I'm gonna come for the ramen.   Maybe I'm biased, but the noodles they use aren't my favorite, I like my noodles straight, so I'm going to have to say I'd defer to Shinsengumi any day (unless of course, my ramen was being paid for by someone other than myself...)

I can't...even... this ramen = the best I ever had. If you are in LA and anywhere close to the historic Little Tokyo, I am begging you to go to Daikokuya for some of their famous and delicious ramen. Ramen: If this is your first time at the restaurant, order their signature Daikokuya ramen and if you're feeling up to it--order a combo. I promise I won't call you a fatty if you won't call me a fatty. The combo comes with their signature Daikokuya ramen, their signature salad, and a side of your choice (this can be anything from pork-katsu donburi (pork over rice) to chicken and egg over rice to sashimi over rice.) They are all SO good. You will leave feeling full and having spent less than $10. Authenticity: Alright so when I walk to the bathroom at the back of the restaurant, I can literally hear the culture change. It is a Japanese restaurant with Japanese waiters shouting, "Irashaimase!" and making ramen right before your eyes. However, when you walk towards the back, you'll start hearing Spanish music and peering behind the curtain, I saw several non-Japanese workers having a fun time making food (they were literally all-smiles). I didn't feel like this took away from the authenticity-- in fact, I thought it was a fun fact that really showed LA's mix of cultures. Parking: It is hard to find street parking in Little Tokyo. I suggest you park for free in the parking lot in front of Office Depot and walk (very short walk) but you'll have to get validation by purchasing something at the Starbucks, Yogurtland or other shops near that lot. Or you can park for a price in the Plaza. Vibe: Love the vibe in Daikokuya. While you're slurping up your noodles, you forget that you're there with friends..instead all you hear is the clamor of the waiters and dishes in the back, the slurping of the noodles-- you just become caught up in the amazingness of this ramen and the surrounding area. The Wait: This may be one of the only negative things about this place. There is always a line for Daikokuya and they do not take reservations. Even on a Tuesday afternoon, you will see people waiting outside and poking their heads in to see how far they've gone up the waiting list. It will be okay though because you are literally standing in one of the coolest places in LA: Little Tokyo. If you're far down the list and your waiter has told you that it will be an hour (and it can definitely be an hour), walk across the street with your friends and check out the fun shops or the Japanese market. You'll have a lot of things to occupy yourself with before coming back just in time for your name to be called. I try and take all of my friends from out of town to Daikokuya because I know they will leave satisfied. Go now and don't be afraid to be a fatty and get that combo-- it's all worth it. https://twitter.com/ceci…

I think I was a little too hyped up for this place before I arrived because of the long 45 minute wait. I didn't want to wait, but the girlfriend made me. -___- The ramen was pretty good and flavorful. Great? No. Good? Yes. Although, the had the best gyoza I have ever tried in my 26 years on this beautiful earth. I have to give this place a solid 4 stars because of the service. As busy as it was in that place they servers were very attentive and refilled my drink about 3 times which I thought was pretty cool. I didn't even expect the to do it once. The food wasn't cheap but wasn't expensive. It was about $9 for a ramen bowl and $6 for the gyoza. The place is super tiny and dinky. I guess it's what you should expect from Downtown LA. Usually, places that are small like that are tasty. I don't think I would be coming back though, I didn't think the food was really worth the super long wait. I rather just opt out for sushi. I guess I would only come back if I am really craving ramen. Oh yeah, and it is cash only.

I LOVE THIS PLACE! good price for the amount of food you get, I always get the combination with the ramen and shredded pork bowl, it also comes with a salad that i find too be delicious! the wait usually seems longer than it is because everyone is standing outside, but thats because there is only 5 or 6 seats inside. I drive from Long Beach to eat here all the time.

I think I did a couple things right so I didn't land in the "Why is this so overrated" camp like a few of my Elite friends here. 1. I came at 4:00 on a Saturday. It was well before the dinner rush, but I still waited a very manageable 15 minutes. 2. I took the Metro Red Line - it's a short walk from either Civic Center or Union Station. I have no idea where I would have parked had I driven here. 3. Even though I was tempted to go with my boring favorites (e.g. a bento box), I ordered their house specialty, the Daikokuya Ramen. Nothing fancy or crazy, just the dish "that's kept them in business." 4. I came solo. I'm much easier to seat that way, especially in a place like this that seats about 35 max. So not every dining experience is going to be like that, but as a first-try those things made my visit so much easier. The ramen was delicious - a few have complained that something is off with the broth here, but I've felt that way about other hyped ramen places like Santouka down in Orange County. I think maybe the best ramen in the world for me would still be an 8/10, and Daikokuya comes pretty close to that mark. So YES, I'm a fan! BTW, still no A/C here.

My review is probably going to get lost in the massive crowd anyway, but this restaurant has been on my food bucket list (yes, i have a food bucket list) since as long as I can remember and I must finally get my word in! I have the patience of 2 year old baby when it comes to good smelling food and have never mustered up enough to stand in these ridiculous lines, until now... SO. 12:15am on a Friday night, when my boyfriend and I stopped there on the way home to the SGV for a super late dinner, it was perfect. Though there was still a roughly 5-10 minute wait, it was definitely do-able in comparison to the 2 hour wait I once heard of. Conclusive thoughts after getting the ($12.50 Ramen w/ Fatty Broth + Fried Rice combo): 1. This place is dinky! No wonder the wait is always so dang long. 2. Really solid fried rice. Tasted amazing on a cold night. The ramen is solid too. 3. Ramen had a strong peanut-y taste to it. I could see lumps of fat in the fatty broth (a warning to the semi health-conscious) 4. I have never eaten such a perfectly cooked egg. 5. Would I eat it again? yes, if there was a less than 20 minute wait. Otherwise, I much prefer Shinsengumi. PLUS. service is wonderful. the japanese men are so attentive and cheery! :D

This place was definitely something I have been hearing from a lot of people and I thought to myself, I want to try it. It was quite late at 10pm on a saturday night. Me and my friend were so hungry again after eating sushi earlier and after walking around in the cold at Griffith Park. We decided to eat some ramen to warm up our bellies a bit. it was still a bit crowded at night and we had to wait about 15 minutes before being able to be seated. The place is a tiny ramen place and quite small so it wasn't surprising to have a long wait. We finally got seated after the wait which we were used to now. Me and my friend decided to get the simple Daikoku Ramen which is their basic and only ramen. I wish they had more variety but then again I do not how the taste is. We both finally got our bowl of ramen. It smelled really good. The texture and broth was really rich and good. The consistency wasn't too creamy nor too salty. It was right at the medium point. Wish they had more meat but then again the noodles tasted really nice. I overall like the taste and the bowl was a good size for each of us and prices range about the same as other ramen places close by in Little Tokyo. Beware of cash only and parking can be hard to find in that area. Overall recommend eating here if you are new to LA or Little Tokyo and crave some ramen.

One of the most refreshing, light, and comforting bowl of ramen that I've had in a long time. After a fun, yet rainy day at Disneyland, my friends and I were ready for something warm... and thus, a trek to Little Toyko to try the famous Daikokuya. Upon a friend's recommendation my bf and I ordered the Daikoku combination with the chicken egg bowl. We also ordered the handmade gyoza just to try as well. First of all, you don't normally see gyoza serve with a handful of green onions on top so that was interesting. I don't think the green onions did anything in terms of taste for the gyoza. All in all, I didn't find the gyoza that great. Definitely not an item that I would order again. The chicken egg bowl was a nice compliment to the ramen. I was glad to see that the ramen was a nice portion/size but a tad small in terms of price (~9.00).   Overall, I would come back to Daikokuya. There was a 30 min wait for my party on a Saturday night at 11:30pm. The restaurant is very small so I would recommend coming with a small party if possible. Parking in Little Toyko is a hit and miss during peak hours for meters but we had no problem at all that night.

Took almost an hour to get in here but it was worth it on a windy Saturday afternoon.   The best part about the ramen here are the toppings which are quite tasty although my egg was a little more cooked than I wanted it to be.  The broth was also good but it wasn't the best part of the meal.  I really enjoy good thick broth in my ramen so I was a little underwhelmed by the broth.

Quite possibly the best ramen I have ever had. There are multiple locations for this'd place but I think the Little Tokyo location is the best! Umm yum! I ordered the pork (tonkai? i cant remember the name exactly but it wasn't the house special one) ramen combo with a side of tuna sashimi. With a combo you get a side salad which is actually thinly sliced cabbage with a miso dressing. Oh man, so tasty! Next came the piping hot ramen. Juicy pieces of pork, boiled end and bean sprouts. Man, Oklahoma is sure missing a ramen joint!!!! The broth is really the best part! My rice bowl was forgotten about but the waitress quickly retrieved it for me. Everyone there is super enthusiastic and nice. If you're not familiar with the area parking might be sort of a pain, but there are plenty of lots where you pay $7-$10 to park in a parking structure. Important note... It's cash only guys!

The Pros: Let's try and make this review simple.  My first time ever eating Daikokuya was a life changing experience.  I never knew how good ramen really was suppose to taste.  The options here are very simple, and definitely not vegan friendly.  The broth I ordered this time was very rich.  Which is an option you can order off the menu.  When I do go to ramen restaurants I like to order spicy miso.  However, Daikokuya does not offer this kind of option.  But it doesn't matter this place has a delicious creamy soup base and noodles are really good.  Go ahead and order everything on the menu, because all of its worth trying once.  All the ingredients taste fresh and are made to perfection.  Like the half boiled egg, green onions, bean sprouts, pork belly slices, noodles, and the very delicious soup base. The Cons: This place is very hot inside about 90° at all times, with no relief anywhere inside. There might be some kind of ridiculous wait time.  Also, they should have a huge sign in the front letting customers know that this is a CASH ONLY restaurant.  Parking can be somewhat of a nightmare.  If you go during peak hours of operation, be prepared to hopelessly try and find some free parking.  While your stomach starts making noises at you, because you want some of the best ramen offered in L.A.

This is my favorite Ramen spot!! They have another location that's actually down the street from my house but for some reason the one in little tokyo is different to me.  The food is delicious!! I love the feel and the ambiance of the whole place.  Very small and quaint spot situated in Little tokyo.  There usually is a wait here but simply because the food keeps the loyal locals coming.  I love the gyoza and the unagi bowl.  I always order my ramen Koteri style or at least i think that's how you spell it. aha but yes I recommend this spot if your around town and looking for a well worth it ramen spot.

Long wait, worth it. Very comparable to my favorite ramen place in New York Ippudo. Get two daikokuya ramens and bring one home because you can't take-out from this place. If you add the extra fat, then be warned that you will be able to see the fat as a you eat it and as delicious it is, it is pretty artery-clogging. Will be returning!

Don't come here hungry...because you have to wait. A long time. Come here with energy, in fact stop and get Starbucks or a milk tea before coming here, because you have to endure the neverending line. Last time I came here at 3:30pm (specifically planned to avoid the line!!!) and still waited 45 minutes. Everyone else must have had the same idea...or maybe they just got hungry. But, it's worth the wait!!! Best tonkotsu Daikoku ramen. If you want flavor/fat that will knock your socks off, get it with kotteri (floating pork fat chunks...it sounds gross but it's not). Also, the fried rice is surprisingly good (there is crab + egg!). I like ordering my ramen with a side of the fried rice in a combo (even though the ramen is more than filling) in order to mix up the textures. Space is cramped in there and you will likely emerge smelling like pork, but the ramen keeps people coming back.

I've been here before they have the best ramen broth. The miso soup is one of the best. If you want to be really full, I recommend you go with heaviest broth and drink it all. This is one of the best ramen joints in town, plus parking hear is easy to find. Shin shin if you like awesome noodles. Here if you want filling broth. I honestly like this place more. I am no stranger to noodles.

DO NOT LET THE LONG WAIT DISCOURAGE YOU. I've had my fair share of ramen and this place is by far the best overall ramen that I have had to date. Waited about an hour and a half to be seated (sadly I've waited longer for other places that weren't as satisfying). Daikoku Ramen + side salad + side shredded pork bowl: OMG I don't think there have been many instances where $12 got me so much food. But it doesn't stop there. The shredded pork is ridiculously good. It is so tender unlike the way I've typically seen shredded/pulled pork served - super dry and covered in some sauce to compensate. And the pickled ginger compliments it really well. I would definitely order this as a full sized entree next time. But let's get to the main thing - Daikoku Ramen. What everyone raves about. Yes this is one of those things that cannot be killed by the hype created around it. Very rare indeed. Ginormous bowl of ramen for what you're paying for by the way. The broth is definitely one part that sets this place apart from the rest. But this dish is so great because of the pork belly. Like MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH it's so freaking tender. I was stuffed after finishing the side bowls and a quarter of the ramen but I kept going because the pork belly was so goooood. Service was super friendly, but it kind of upset me that they forgot half of my order (they gave me the side bowls and not the ramen), until I finally flagged the waiter down 20 minutes later to learn that they never made it. But again, the pork belly sort of negated that and all the waiting we had to do the moment we walked through the door. Cash only, but fear not they have an ATM in the back! There will be no other ramen place for me.

Long line.  There is always a line.  Not worth it for a 45-min wait, but ok for a 30-min wait.   Their ramen broth isn't the best, but it's pretty darn good. If you're getting ramen in Little Tokyo, then this is the place to go.   Last time I was here I tried their Kotteri tsukemen, and I was really happy with it.  Not as good as Tsujita, but for where I was at (craving Kotteri flavor and tsukemen), it hit the spot right on. Never tried it?  Try it out, but be ready for a long wait (especially if your group is over 4 people).  Prices are reasonable, and it's cash only.  They do have an atm in the back.

absolute pinnacle of specialized restaurant.  they do one thing better than ANYONE in town.  although the line is abit much to deal with, you can clearly taste the difference in the broth which has been simmering for awhile to bring out the chasu richness.  There are other items on the menu (i.e fried rice) which are delightful as well, but it certainly will be an empty trip to the big D to skip out on their traditonal ramen.

I don't consider myself a Ramen expert just yet.  Aspiring, more like.  There are a few places in Chicago that I've tried but nothing to write home about.  Saw that this was the most popular Ramen place in LA and it was suggested by my resident LA cousin.   The wait was 30-45 minutes even at 2pm in the afternoon on Sunday!  The place is cozy and looks like a diner.  After finally being seated the huge bowl arrived in eager anticipation!  The broth is Dynamite!  Literally made from the same ingredients they put in a stick of dynamite.  No, honestly it was really good.  Perfect balance of saltiness and fattiness.  The pork was heaven!  Tender, fatty, melt in your mouth!  The noodles were good, but I was expecting them to be great. Overall, damn great Ramen.  I'm not sure I'd wait in line that long for them again.  I probably would if I were going alone, since there are several bar stools that I'd probably get seated much quicker.

Ah yes, the ever so long wait for ramen.  It shouldn't have to be like this.  Tried both of their signature dishes the regular ramen and the one pretty much ala carte for dipping.  The noodles seemed a bit hard and the broth didn't taste like much.  I do have to commend it on the pork pieces though, tender and juicy.  Was it worth the wait, probably not.  I do like the unlimited ginger on the side, I like to try the ramen for comparison, but then I like to add some ginger for additional taste.

Literally had ramen every day I was in LA while visiting. Daikokuya proved to be the best through our methodical process of scientific trial-and-taste. (HA! more like filling my belly until I couldn't eat anymore, digest, and repeat) While the kotteri ramen (with extra pork fat flavoring) was melt-in-your mouth delicious, I don't think I could have more than a few bites.  I was very happy with my regular pork ramen, but my boyfriend hasn't stopped ranting about the kotteri ramen for months. I'm not sure if other Daikokuya locations are the same, but Daikokuya ramen is a must-go and definitely worth the wait!

Little tip when eating ramen: it's not the noodle necessarily that makes the ramen, it's the broth, and let me tell you... I had been craving ramen all day and decided to finally make my way to Little Tokyo to finally try Daikokuya! The wait was surprisingly not as long as I thought. I think my friend and I waited at most 20 minutes. (Parties of 1 or 2 get seated faster than big groups in here because of limited seating). Once we sat down, we got our menus and of course we were getting the ramen. Within 5 minutes we had two big bowls placed in front of our hungry faces. I went to town! I chowed down on the egg noodles, which were really good, the pork was juicy and tender. I wish they put more green onion in it. The broth, well the broth was probably the best part. It was creamy and flavorful, it didn't feel overwhelmingly fatty but felt light and easy on the stomach. I devoured my bowl in about 10 minutes. I was so full! I wish they could make it spicy, or had the little oil that's spicy, would've added the little pinch of SHAZAAM on the tongue. I also tried the egg in the ramen for the first time! I usually eat around it, avoid it, but I did it, I ate it and I loved it! For two bowls of ramen the total was some cents over $20.

Likes: Daikoku ramen with kotteri flavor, very fast service, short wait for a booth if you go early around when the store opens, decent price Tip: Park in a parking garage.  I noticed parking in Little Tokyo is $3/hr meter parking so if you're going to be there a while, might as well park in one of the parking garages that range from $3 - $7 flat rate all day.

Its worth the drive and its a tiny little place so its a bit of a wait for a table but once you get your food you have no complaints thereafter! The servers WOW they are a hardworking bunch of guys! quick clean up and I mean clean too and then they seat the next group waiting outside.

Best. Ramen. Ever. Broth was just right, not too thick and not too thin and the consistency of the noodles were amaaaazing. Highly recommend as hangover cure. Or just dinner. Portions are huge! You can ask for smaller portions if you want, or to split one. The broth/noodles doesn't get overly salty after broth soaks into the noods, which is really great because soy sauce/miso'd up noodles is why I can't usually finish Japanese ramen. Wait time goes by decently, interior is kitschy and cramped, service is pretty fast for a busy place like here. Definitely go here at least once.

A bit over-hyped in my honest opinion. The ramen was whatever. I was expecting a lot more from this place but it didn't really live up to what my friend's had told me. A major plus was that right outside was a cool Japanese festival. This place was extremely packed. Unfortunately if you have a party of more than 6 they can't seat you altogether. Quite unfortunate but the service was pretty nice.

I've been to several ramen places in NYC but I don't think any place has ramen that beats Daikokuya! The texture is soft yet firm. The meat is SO tender - it just falls apart in your mouth! The wait? Yeah, it's a tad long but this place is a MUST if you're in Little Tokyo! Patience is a virtue, my friends! Everything's decently priced. Just make sure to bring cash since it's cash only!

Not my cup of tea, I'm afraid.  Due to my cursed genes and advanced age, I am a salt-phobe.  Broth way too salty and strong flavored for me.  Plus, I hate crowds.

This is my favorite ramen place in LA.  The broth is outstanding.  I sort of don't even know how to describe it.  There is a subtlety to the flavor that makes you always want another sip - I frequently am full well before I'm done, but nonetheless keep drinking the broth until its gone and I have a stomachache.  I love the mashed garlic on the table, and also always add in the chili powder.  The ramen comes with pork, bean sprouts, onions, bamboo, and a soft-boiled egg.  The egg is always just right - never hard all the way through.  I wish there were more of the delicious pork but, what can you do?  (Well, you could order more pork, actually.) I recommend getting a combo.  It's too much food, but oh, leftover Daikokuya for lunch the next day always makes me happy.  The shredded pork bowl (it's actually tender and flavorful cubes of pork) is very delicious, if a little fatty.  The pork fried rice is also outstanding.  The other combo bowls are good, too (I like the unagi bowl, but the chicken-egg bowl didn't have enough chicken or egg for me).  But, the shredded pork and pork fried rice remain my favorite. By the way, it's very hot in this little place - no air conditioning.  And, there will be a long line almost any time of the day.  (Once, I went on a weekday at 3 p.m. and there was no line - but generally, expect a line during mealtimes on the weekdays, and any time on the weekends.)  Helpfully, both Cosmos and Far Bar are just doors down, where you can enjoy libations during your wait.  (We just put our name in and then periodically send someone back to check on our progress.)

This place screams authenticity. We went here at the opening time on a weekday and even then, there was already a line forming.  I like the look and feel of this place.  The minute you step in to this small ramen house, you are greeted by the waitress who has a japanese-ish english accent and was really nice.  They had alot of good reviews here so i was really excited to eat here.  I had huge expectations because i've heard of LA having the best ramen. I ordered the speciality ramen here and at first glance it looks really plain.  The noodles taste average but the one thing i tasted instantly was how salty this soup was.  The flavor was really good but i was so distracted by the amount of salt that was entering my mouth.  I don't know if we came on a bad batch day or if this is what it normally taste like.  The egg tasted like a boiled egg and the soup was filled with green onions.   The place itself started out as room temperature when they opened but as they started cooking, the room was sooo hot.  Not only was it a warm day and we were eating soup, the heat inside was also irritating.   Another downside is that they only take cash.  We were coming back from a cruise and lost all of our cash on the ship at the casino and we had to find an atm to withdraw.  Luckily, there was a nearby atm at a nearby liquor store. I was disappointed in the ramen and would not go here again.

I heart Daikokuya.  I always only ever get their Daikokuya signature ramen.  Why get anything else?  It is sooooooooooo good.  Perfectly tender pork, a delicious egg... the noodles are sturdy and toothsome.  This is my favorite treat in Little Tokyo by far.   There is also a branch in the mini mall in Baldwin Hills by the Ranch Market.  That one, you are sure to not wait.  If you're heading to Little Tokyo though during a popular dining hour, be prepared to wait up to and hour.   I went for an early lunch the other day (I work downtown) and had no problem getting a seat at the bar.  It was the least crowded I'd ever seen it.  I also saw an amazing thing: women taking ramen to go!  YES! I am going to start doing this too!! Yay.

Well I have only been there once, the ramen is alright, I like shinsengumi more but It comes with all the stuff (egg and etc). It's a plus to not have to pay for every thing I want with the ramen. The best is the chicken and egg bowl and the beef bowl. The salad thing made with cabbage is good too, like my friends would probably only go to eat their salad LOL. It really is good, go try it.

The ramen here is excellent.  However, the wait is proportionally long and this isn't some cheapie instant ramen ($9/bowl).  Take note that your wait and monetary sacrifice is going to be worth it.  This place uses quality ingredients and the chefs here are somewhat perfectionists- I saw the guy who boils noodles throw away a whole box of noodles because they were broken or too dry.  The broth here is amazing and keep in mind the pork is meant to be fatty!!  The standard ramen also includes an egg and some mountain veggies so tell the waiters ahead of time if you're a picky eater.   Lastly, you may be wondering why the 4 stars if this is such an amazing place.  The food is indeed quite good but the cleanliness of this restaurant is a little lacking.

delicious japanese ramen!!!! i'm so glad i found this place coming from New York where all i would eat is ippudo or totto. Their ramen is absolutely delicioussss the broth is not too salty and has great flavor. Chashu is pretty good, but still prefer my ippudo and totto. I would definitely come back here for their ramen even though it takes forever to get seated, but hey, that means the foods good inside right? and that's why nobody wants to leave!!! :) parking is always sucky in los angeles, i don't understand how y'all do it, the one thing i actually like about living in manhattan, you don't have to worry about parking, you just take the subway and walk on over. WHOOP! Anyways!!! absolutely delicious and i HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU COME HERE TO EAT!!!

I used to love Daikokuya.  I don't know why but the ramen didn't taste AS good as I remember it.  The broth was saltier than usual and the noodles weren't my fave.  Portions are enormous though, if you're looking for quantity. The pork pieces were still delicious. Gyoza was dry, overly floury and too thick. Bento box is nice if someone isn't so much a fan of the ramen. I would return but I don't know if I would wait in line for this.

OK, so you have to wait if you don't get there before it opens, but, the ramen is worth it. Personally I'm a fan of the kotteri broth, which is richer and more unctuous the standard broth. The staff and friendly, and it feels like Tokyo (and is closer). Highly recommended.

Never disappointed when I go here. I always get the shredded pork bowl although I did try the ramen with the backfat and can't say I didn't like it. Only sucky part about Daikokuya is that there isn't much space if you plan on going with a big group.

There's usually a ~30 min wait but it's well worth it! Get their specialty (and the reason they're in business) - the daikoku ramen! It's $8.95 for a generous portion. You can also get a half size or large. The broth is flavorful and the noodles are slightly firmer than your average ramen. They also include a whole hard boiled egg in the broth. Every time I'm in Little Tokyo, I always go here. I've never been to their other locations but it may be worth it to try.

Fortunately I went at a later time so it wasn't super crowded. Usually it's always packed with a crowd of people waiting--but that's when you know it's good. I got the Daikokuya Ramen--kotteri flavor--and it was SO good. The brother was flavorful, the noodles were good and the pork was nice and tender. My mouth is watering thinking about it now.  I also tried some of their tonkatsu too and it had a delicious, nice crispy exterior. Would definitely come back here again!

The main attraction here is the Daikoku ramen, and it's terrific. They also do a great job with another of my favorite Japanese food items, tsukemono (pickled vegetables). At most restaurants, all of the items on the tsukemono plate taste more or less the same; they're all obviously pickled more or less the same way. At Daikokuya they have very distinct flavors. The atmosphere here is very casual, but great. The decor includes lots of vintage Japanese ads, posters, signs, and tchotchkes. And the music is heavy on 1977 Pink Lady tracks. Remember that it's cash only, and be prepared for a wait. It's worth it.

There is always a significant wait for the privilege of dining here, but having the opportunity to partake in the most sumptuous bowl of ramen you've ever had is worth every waiting second.  Order the kotteri style broth which is richly laden with extra pork fat -- yes this is pure gluttony and one of the 7 deadly sins, but if you're going to be cast down into hell for it, make this the reason.

Came by to see what the hype was all about... Too crowded, even on odd hours during the day.  Don't come here hungry!! Ramen was good overall, but not great.  The pork was pretty good but Santoukas special pork has it beat.  Heard great things about the unagi bowl, and even that was just soso.

I will say this...I'm a huge fan of Orochon and this ramen tasted better than Orochon's.  The daikoku ramen is less salty and tastes really fresh. The cost of the food was pretty reasonable as well. That being said, I still had to give this place 3 stars for the following reasons: We waited SO long to get into this place. I've always heard that the line for this place is ridiculous, so my friends and I came on a Monday night. We still waited for a good hour, in the cold. CASH only!? Really? The place felt a little dirty. From the "waiting area" on the street, to the tables, to the sticky menus. We ordered some gyoza and it tasted a little bit like fish. Honestly, I'd give this place another shot because of the ramen, but that's all this place has to offer.

Ramen Quest #1: Unreal. 5 Stars. I had the Daikoku Ramen. This place is seriously amazing. I've been wanting to try this place for a LONG time, but there has always been a huge wait. A co-worker and I just happened to be in the neighborhood one afternoon and saw that there was no line, so I kicked her out of the car and she threw our names on the list while I parked. I am new to the whole ramen thing, other than the awful stuff I ate for nearly every meal in college, so I went with the standard specialty ramen. WOW. The broth, the meat, the noodles... everything went together so well, it was perfect. I think since this was my first ramen experience in LA i've ruined my taste buds for any other ramen spot. I downed a large bowl and wanted to lick it clean, but i'm not up to speed on ramen etiquette so I refrained from doing so. My co-worker ended up taking 1/2 of hers home with her and told me that it was just as good cold the next day. Yes, the lines are long but knowing what I know now I totally get it. Don't be afraid, put your name on the list, walk around little tokyo for a while and come back and see where you are, it is totally worth it!

I was shocked to find that this place didn't have five stars from everyone. I've come to this Daikokuya probably 25 times over the past five or six years, and aside from the wait, I have not a bad thing to say about this place. The service is friendly and pretty speedy, the atmosphere is nice and charming, and the food is wonderful. The broth is so rich and delicious, it would be worth the wait just for that. But throw in perfectly cooked noodles and generous portions of amazing pork belly and you've got yourself the ramen from heaven. Even the sprouts, of which I'm not normally fond, are so delicious from the broth that you'll want to drain the bowl. Except don't feel bad if you can't, because they give you so much food! Other entrees, such as the unagi, teriyaki and new citrus steak are also quite delectable, but don't even think of getting them instead of ramen -- no no, the combo with ramen is the way to go. Okay, everybody wants to know about the wait, and to them I say this: Daikokuya opens at 11am, so a few years ago I started planning on an early lunch and getting there about 10:50. Since then I've only missed getting immediate seating once, and I waited no more than 20 extra minutes. The other dozen or so times I was chowing down by 11:10. Or, as others have suggested, Little Tokyo is a great place to wander, so get there and put your name in before you're starving and you won't mind the wait.

Love love LOVE this place! I'll wait in line for an eternity to get myself that little bowl of heaven. They offer a half bowl of ramen which is nice because I can never finish the normal size. They have a bunch menu items, but I've never steered away from the ramen. The gyoza and fried rice are delicious! It is fairly small and the waiting area is pretty packed so waiting outside is pretty much the only option. Parking is HORRIBLE but there's a $5 lot across the street if there aren't any open spots. Overall, great food and great prices!

Another Yelp top 10 restaurant visit. Had to get the richer kotteri flavor ramen.  Tasty but I would've liked it to have been even more richer and thicker (aka fatter) for the ultimate 5/5 rating. For a place known for it's ramen I was really surprised that there was only one type of ramen on their menu.

I never thought that I could find a ramen shop better than Ippudo NY, but I think I've finally found the place. They opened at 11AM, and we came in at 11:30 and it was already a full house! That's when you know a place is THAT good. We waited for about 10 minutes and were sat at the bar. I ordered their tsukemono (pickled vegetables) to start, and the daikoku ramen with the small pork cutlet bowl combination. A big bowl of ramen PLUS a small bowl of rice with meat for only $11.95?! A bowl of ramen by itself was only $8.95. I could hardly believe the prices! The broth is flavorful, they're not skimpy on the noodles, and they give you plenty of toppings inside. I could only finished 1/2 of my bowl and my boyfriend happily agreed to finish it for me. Everybody that works here is Japanese, which is always a plus when you want to know if a place is genuinely authentic. The service here was also great during our meal. You have to rely on finding street parking, but there are also a few lots and garages around the vicinity. There's also a lot of shops in Little Tokyo that are worth stopping by for cute trinkets and souvenirs!

Daikokuya is undoubtedly worth the wait!..  This tiny ramen establishment is simple and makes me feel at home.  There's a ramen bar with a few tables for 'groups' but I wouldn't recommend going in groups more than 2 simply because your wait will probably be longer than it needs to be. They turn tables around pretty quickly and have an efficient process to keep things going.. I don't give 5 stars often, but this was well deserved.  The ramen is hands down the BEST I've had in years - and all the other side dishes are like toppings on a cake; not figuratively though but you know what I mean (we had tempura and tonkatsu which were both delish!).. also - they're CASH ONLY!

Little hole in the wall restaurants are always the best! Especially when the lines just never end. I've waited almost 2 hours before and that really proves how good the ramen is. My boyfriend always gets the small fried rice combo and I get the tuna sashimi combo. I guess the only reason why it doesn't get 5 stars is because the lines do seriously get long. I wish they would expand. But Must try if you are in the area :)

Broth was savery, large portions and I'd say I liked it better than Shin-Sen-Gumi Hakata Ramen that I've been to several times in the past. Also, if you go to the Little Tokyo location, lots of fun stores within walking distance to check out for dessert and souvenirs :)

Really LA??  I don't think you know your ramen. Santouka inside the Mitsuwa grocery store is 10 x's better.  So not worth the wait.  I can't take the 20 minutes of waiting back.. but you can.  Don't do it! Cold egg in my soup.  Broth was not very flavorful.  Measly serving of bamboo shoots and pork in a huge bowl with tons of noodles. Don't waste your time.

Some might say that I'm easily impressed when it comes down to food, and maybe I am, but this place is straight up AMAZING. I don't even need to go out of my way to post a review like this, I could just be greedy and keep the amazingness of this place all to myself, but I can't hold it in anymore. I love this place so much, I drive 30 minutes at least once a month to come here. The wait is worth it, the small dining room is worth it, anything is worth it. If its your first time you have to get the daikoku ramen, its pretty much a huge bowl of the best ramen you can get anywhere outside of Japan. The noodles are perfectly cooked every time, the pork in the soup is just so tender and delicious as well. But nothing beats the broth. You wont taste anything like it. I've been to other popular ramen restaurants like Orochon and Santouka but Daikokuya blows these places out of the water. Its perfect for those days when you're sick, nothing makes you feel better. On a cold or rainy day, that broth makes you feel warmer than the inside of the sun. Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I'm just being ridiculous, but you'll never know unless you try it. Trust me.

#1 reason to come to Shin-Sen-Gumi and NOT Daikokuya: you can ALWAYS get a seat. (the average 1.5 hour long wait at Daikokuya is in part due to the die-hard fans yes...but imho MORE to do with the fact that there is RIDICULOUSLY inefficient seating arrangements AND slow, slow, slow waiters.  i waited in line for 35 minutes and had plenty of time to observe... if you watch them closely, their obsequious-ness and over-politeness slows them down.  they just shuffle, staring at the ground. picking up scraps of food from the floor BY HAND with a dish towel instead of having a bus boy properly do the job with a bus boy cart and/or broom. it's maddening to watch. it's like watching buster keaton and charlie chaplin run the kitchen and floor of a busy restaurant. hilarity ensues... TRUST me, you cannot help but laugh after watching them. we gave up waiting and went to Shin-Sen-Gumi instead and never looked back. sad but true. #2 reason: Shin-Sen-Gumi (unlike Daikokuya) takes CREDIT CARD. it amazes me that businesses still try to operate with "cash only" practices. it makes them look ghetto and it's a total turn off for me as a consumer. it says several things to me as a consumer.. either the owner is a moron and living in another era.... or that the owner cares nothing about facilitating business with me... or that the owner is stubborn... or.. oh who cares, i give up. i now hate Daikokuya after the horrible wait experience. regarding other "cash only" businesses, case(s) in point: johnnie pastrami's - cash only. complete pain in my ass so i started going to Harvey's Pastrami instead. cafe 50's - ho hum, it's just easier to get the same pancakes from norm's or ihops with credit card-O!

Chowhound noted a decline in quality a few years ago, but I think it has substantially stepped up since 2007.   Best ramen I've had yet in LA.  I've eaten around, mostly WLA/Sawtelle/areas closer to home.   Order the richer broth (kotteri), and extra pork.  You won't regret it.  You also won't be able to finish it, and you'll just be disappointed with yourself for not being able to eat more.   The wait was irrelevant.  Worth it.  The noodles were good, nothing stellar.  The pork was fine.  Everything else, acceptable.   The broth?   Go try it.  Kotteri-style.

I chortle when I mistranslate the restaurant's kanji as "Big Black Family." BEST RAMEN EVER. For $8.50, you get a heaping bowl of perfect noodles in the richest broth I've ever had. You don't even need kotteri-styling to get to this level of flavor intensity, and who needs extra back fat anyway (Do pigs even have backs? Isn't it the top? We digress.). It was fun to sit at the counter and watch the dudes fry up the rice and dole out broth from the huge tanker up front. Next time, they'll probably have to restrain me from diving into that broth tank. Pay the extra $3 for the chahan (Japanese fried rice). It has a good char to it and they use kurobuta pork. Huge portions, so we each had a bowl of noodles, split the rice, AND still had enough for a snack the next day. Restaurant has a lot of character too, so plenty to look at while you wait. Just put your name down and go for a little walk in Little Tokyo.

As a carless college student, I usually get to places earlier than I would like to because I take the bus and I would rather be early than forty minutes late. As it turned out, I was going to do a little grocery shopping in Little Tokyo so I took the bus... and got there earlier than I expected. But a few seconds of thinking and I realized... I could potentially get into Daikokuya without having to wait an hour!! So I got there and, though there was a small line outside, it was nothing compared to the horrific waiting lists I have seen at Daikokuya. After about ten minutes, we were let in. I sat at the counter and ordered the classic Daikokuya ramen. Within ten minutes, I got it, added some garlic, broke upon my chopsticks and started to slurp. The broth was nicely savory, the pork MELTED in your mouth, the egg took on the flavor of the broth and was excellent and it was a very satisfying ramen experience. So... why 4 stars? The price. I get it. Apparently this is the stuff of ramen legends here in LA, but as a half-Japanese person who has been to Japan and has had real Japanese ramen, it's alright. Very good for LA but typical for Japan. So charging $10 for a bowl is a little ridiculous in my opinion. But hey, it's Daikokuya, and at least I can now say that I've been there.

EHHH~ TRY IT SO YOU CAN SAY YOU'VE BEEN THERE, BUT DON'T GO BACK. Are you freaking kidding me?  I read all the reviews and I begin to believe in the "hype" that this place has the best noodles in town,  Every time I walk pass this place, its busy, everyone is standing outside waiting to be seated... the wait to get in is AT LEAST a minimum of 40 minutes. I went on a weekday, pretty late at night, so I figured there wouldn't be a line.  Boy, I was wrong: Ryan and I waited for about 45 minutes and by the time we sat down to eat, I take a look at the menu and: THERE WAS ONLY ONE (1) TYPE OF RAMEN.... Really? I was thinking "ok" this ramen must be frekkin amazing, To my disappointment it wasn't what I thought it to be.  Maybe my hopes were too high... The base wasn't special at all.   Broth: was not too thick nor brothy, it had no spicy-ness to it Topping: my egg was cold. Overall, this place was by no means the best ramen house in Little Tokyo.   The lines are way to long, they only take cash (they do have an ATM in the back) and they do not have a variety of toppings (which I'm very fond of).

Good food at a good price. Love the ramen and fried rice. Only drawbacks are long lines (weeknights aren't too bad) and parking. Take the gold line metro if at all possible as it's only a block away. Don't forget its cash only here.

I was told this was the best ramen in LA. When a spot has a reputation for the best ramen, I most definitely need to taste it for myself. We put our names down on a massively long list and ventured out into Little Tokyo to wander and try and get our minds off of our rumbling bellies and came back after 45 minutes to find that there was still a loooong wait. Another half hour later we were finally seated and placed our orders (gyoza to share and a bowl of daikoku ramen for each of us) and the food came out piping hot and amazingly fast. The gyoza were underwhelming; tiny and soggy. The ramen itself was... alright. I have had good ramen and REALLY good ramen and this falls under the former. The broth had enough porky flavour to satisfy my ramen craving, but lacked any sort of real depth or creaminess that I would have expected. The best part was easily the egg that was served in the bowl. If the wait wasn't so long I probably would be more inclined to recommend this place, but with all of the options in the area I can't say that it's worth waiting over an hour for your food. Oh, and it's cash only.

This place often has a line and the wait can be 20-40 minutes long... I've only been here once when there wasn't a wait, the rest of the times there has always been a wait.  Sometimes I hope a bus here from the business district and hope to catch lunch within an hour. The food is OK, the ramen soup is thick and oily just like kotteri should be.  The egg is done just right.  Nothing super great or special, though, just about right.  There are a handful of ramen places here in Southern California, but I suppose not enough, or at least not enough to provide stiff competition.  Still, a decent place, but I'm not sure always worth the wait.

What's with the seemingly random designations of one-way streets in Los Angeles? I hate venturing to downtown because of all the one way streets. More often than not I miss  my destination and I can't simply bust a u turn. I end up having to go all the way around. My gps is always wanky as hell in downtown too. I had a little bit of trouble finding this place, damn you google maps and damn you one way streets. Once I paid for parking all was good. Dakokuya is a small, hole in the wall space that can get packed fairly quickly.  Thank the ramen gods that there was only a small wait when I visted this place. I ordered the Ramen Koterri style. Koterri in a nutshell means they put some "back fat' in the ramen. Damn, I love me some back fat. If back fat is wrong, I don't want to be right. This took the broth to another level. The taste was savory and the ramen was hearty. I must admit, sipping on that the brothy, back fat goodness was comforting as hell.  I also ordered the fried rice to cap of my coma inducing lunch. It was just Icing on the back fat ramen cake. This is a must try for any ramen lovers out there.

I love the ramen here.  I always get their special.  I have brought many people here over the years and they really like it too.  The wait averages about 45 minutes to an hour.  Parking is hard to find and you usually have to walk.  Overall, I prefer Santouka in Mitsuwa. The chasu with green onions is delicious if you can find space in your tummy after eating a gigantic bowl of ramen.   Don't get anything with fresh fish in it.  This a ramen place, after all.

Daiko-wha?!?! I can never pronounce the name right but yet their ramen is The Best!!! When I've noticed this place years ago in Little Tokyo, I always see a crowd outside and It makes me wonder what the buzz is about. Its like a club and you want to join in but Its not all dandy when coming here during long waits to be seated. Normally we would call in to check the line status because sometimes being in that waiting list you could be in for a dreadful wait, because this place is small. I order here most of the times their Combination : a side of Teriyaki Chicken Egg Bowl and their Daikoku Ramen which has an egg, bean sprouts, green onions, I don't know whats their secret in the broth but this ramen is boss! I cannot forget to mention the salad that comes with the combination that Sh*t is good and I ain't vegetarian! There is a small spicy shaker that they leave on the table and l like to overkill it with my salad, ramen and my chicken bowl!! If anybody knows the name of that thing please let me know. The staff here are very friendly they always yell out stuff in Japanese.  Im not sure what they say exactly when you hear them speak their native tongues but I always get a good vibe when they welcome us getting seated and thanking you when you leave. I notice that dude who works here, he's like the loudest one and he sounds funny because they enjoy what they do and they know they serve awesome ramen. It doesn't take a scientist to make good ramen, they do a really good job to keep their ramen home cooked than trying to be all fancy with all sorts of seasoned toppings, like other joints. They even opened other locations but I"ll stick with this location hopefully to get around the big crowds.

I didnt have high expectations going into this place because every bowl of ramen i had thus far was simply delicious. But I was expecting to leave satisfied just as I did everytime I ate at  Katanaya in SF, Ippudo in NYC and even the lesser known ones like Men-kui Tei and Terrakawa in NYC. And even most recent at Men Oh, a new small unknown ramen place in Union City. I was really surprised to find the broth to be unflavorful and the ramen noodles..tasted like won ton noodles, even though they highly advertise it. But one thing to note, their egg was cooked to perfection. Not sure why theres such a huge wait for this place though. Maybe all the other ramen places on the block are subpar.

Perfect -- even moreso at 1:30 a.m. after your friend's wild 30th birthday party. As a native Houstonian, I'm accustomed to eating piping hot Asian soup 365 days a year, so it didn't matter that it was August. This ramen is incredible, and I'd eat it sitting outside in New Orleans in July. It's that good. The noodle serving is generous, which is crucial because you want to finish every drop of the homemade broth. Pork belly was perfectly cooked, and the whole hard-boiled egg was a little weird but the extra protein I needed after a night out in LA.

Please. As if this place needs more reviews. Came in for lunch on Sunday. Free street parking, and we got seated at the bar immediately. Daikoku Ramen - the broth was top. The noodles - yum. The pork was just oh-so tender, and it just melts in your mouth. I wish the egg was sliced in half though..

Awesome ramen. Finally got to try this place after hearing good things about it from friends. Having had Orenchi Ramen in the bay I was pleasantly surprised that the portions were a lot bigger at a lower price. I couldn't finish my ramen even though I wanted to slurp up every last drop of the tasty broth! I got the Daikoku Ramen "kotteri"(sp?) and they had everything I was looking for: chewy noodles, rich broth, soft boiled egg, and melt in your mouth pork. the kotteri basically means they add the back fat to make it extra rich. It was a little bit too much for me, so I'm just going to stick with the regular!  Sooo yummy, definitely coming back here when the weathers colder (: Oh yah, there's usually a wait since the place is pretty small.

Had an amazing date night in Little Tokyo which started with a craving for ramen.  I chose Daikokuya after reading the review of one of my favorite yelpers Roland L. who never steers me wrong and I absolutely loved this spot.  Thanks Rols!  The ramen was absolutely delicious, and not just in your typical comforting hot bowl of soup kind of way.  This was well prepared, well seasoned, mouth watering yumminess.   It was the art of Ramen.  Seriously.  I don't mean to over sell or exaggerate, but I haven't enjoyed a $10 meal this much- EVER, and actually can't wait to get back here... The meal started with the most delicious gyoza I've ever tasted.  Gyoza are Japanese style dumplings and you have to order them if you dine here.  They were authentic, fresh, and delectable.   I have this thing for spicy food so on the recommendation of the waitress, I ordered the Kichi-Men.  It is served in three dishes: a deep bowl of the exquisite hot and sour broth, a plate of cold perfectly cooked noodles topped with savory dry seaweed, and a plate of shredded chashu pork.  You then build your bowl of ramen by dipping the noodles and pork into the hot broth, and when its done you dip more... I enjoyed my ramen like this in like two or three servings.  The Kichi-Men is a new version of their dipping style Tsukemen, for those that have eaten here before.  Anyway, it was absolutely heavenly with just the right kick for my spicy palate.   My meal came with fried rice on the side, or I accidentally ordered it that way, but in any case, it was not necessary.  Even though the rice was delish too, its a lot of food and way to many carbs :-)   My Bichon Ginger got to enjoy the rice when I got home.  She loved it!  If you have a big appetite get the rice, if not, the Ramen is suffice.   Daikokuya is a quaint adorable diner right across from the Village Plaza in J-town.  The Japanese hipsters working here, the general appearance of the crowd waiting for a table, and the Japanese kitschy decor give this joint a cool funky appeal.  It is now one of my favorite spots and definitely a must try next time you are in DTLA.  Trust.   Food: A+ Ambiance: A Service: A Price Point: $$ Perfect place for a a casual lunch or dinner for two.  The space is small so I wouldn't recommend it for groups larger than 4-6... **Cash only!   Tanoshimu!  (means 'enjoy' in Japanese) :-) xo Dre

Salad and sushi okay, but had no clue what a vegetarian is and could not grasp the idea of friend rice without egg or a pork bowl without pork. They didn't even try to understand. 2 stars for services that blew.  whatever I did try was manageable.

Went down to LA this weekend and a friend demeaned that try this place. The 4 of us went to downtown LA around 11am. And there was already a line with about 10 people in front of us. We waited about an hour before we were called. (BTW your WHOLE GROUP must be present for you to be seated.) We were seated at the counter seats in front of the cooks. The place is very small but its roomy enough to not be shoulder to shoulder with the person next to you. There is literally ONE ramen to chose from "Daikoku Ramen", but there were 2 ways it can be served, 1) having all the meat,eggs,noodle,soup in a bowl together or 2) have it all in its separate bowls. And you can have a choice of adding a more meaty flavor to the soup base. (I just ordered the normal base) The soup base was REALLY GOOD! It was PREFECT~! Also it can get pretty WARM, because there isn't AC and its a small place with a lot of people and HOT dishes. I wouldnt say its to DIE for..but none the less it was YUMMY! And very filling. =)

Its crowded...I get it.  Its usually at least a 30-45 minute wait. It's good, but i prefer santouka.   I've learned two new things though.  You can get take out boxes so I don't have to force the food down my throat.  And even better they don't mind if you share, so for 3 people we only ordered 2 combos and it was still wayyyy too much food.  They even gave us extra bowls and stuff without me having to ask which was nice. The workers probably wouldn't like it if we ordered 1 combo for 3 asian people but it probably woulda been enough :) On a side note, the last time i came the egg wasn't runny and it made me sad.  It was fully cooked and that to me is just wrong.

Broth is five stars, but not enough pork plus the wait time knocked Daikokuya's rating down for me.  Personally, I would choose eating at Santouka over Daikokuya, although Daikokuya's ramen is still very good in its own right. Came here pretty late on a random weeknight and was surprised to see how long the wait was for just two people.  It's bad enough that the wait time deters me from eating here as often as I would like (and I'm not a super impatient person).  That aside, service is fine.  Be sure to bring cash, as they do not accept credit cards. I ordered the Daikokuya ramen, kotteri style.  The bowl is huge, and I can't imagine finishing a combo dish (although I hear good things).  The broth was very, very good - probably my favorite for tonkotsu kotteri.  Noodles were OK and the egg was perfectly cooked.  The pork was delicious and fatty; however, I was really disappointed with the amount of pork I got.  Like... I finished that pork real quick, and I was even rationing myself!  I didn't see an option to order extra pork on the menu either, although I might still try to next time.  After I finished all the meat, the ramen just wasn't as good anymore.  Too many noodles left uneaten - not something I like to do with ramen! Overall, I like Daikokuya and would definitely eat here again if I were in Little Tokyo and the wait time were reasonable (under 30 minutes).  However, with so many other great options in LA, dining at Daikokuya is a little too inconvenient for it to be my all-time favorite ramen spot.

This original location blows all other Daikokuyas out of the universe.  I mean, I do not understand how the quality can be so different between the different locations.  Given that, all you need to order is the Daikokuya Ramen with the bean sprouts on the side (gets in the way!).  The broth is packed with flavor yet doesn't coat your mouth with fat like you'd expect from such a rich broth.  The ramen is cooked perfect and the massive amounts of green onion kind of brings this dish together.  Even though your heart tells you NOT to drink all the broth after you're done with the noodles, there's just no turning back.  You either go big, or go home.  5 stars for taste. It's not hard to see why this place ALWAYS has a wait time exceeding 45 minutes...IF you're lucky.

If you want to impress your out of town friends with a bowl of "authentic" ramen, while thinking you're exclusive by waiting in a gigantic line, than take them to Daikokuya. I've tried several times to enjoy this bowl, with extra fat, less fat, etc. Every time I leave here, I ask myself, "why didn't I just drive to Santouka?"

6 booths and about 13 seats at the bar.  I came here about 10 minutes after it opened and wow, there were already about 10 people waiting in front of us! This place has been on my bookmark for a while.  I finally made a trip to LA and definitely wanted to make time to come here.  My friends have been raving about this place.  They were saying that the ramen and fried rice were to die for.   Fried rice: flavorful but greasy.  I like the fatty pork they put in it.   Ramen: It was good...my egg was too cooked and was cold when i bit into it.  I also found myself VERY thirsty during and after my meal.   I'm going to have to agree to disagree with my friends on this joint.

House ramen - $8.95 Alright.  I'll say it.  I loved the broth here.  Probably the best broth I've had - BETTER than my favorite ramen joint (Yukinoya in Rowland Heights).  I had low expectations coming into this place; I've been to Daikokoyua at Hacienda Heights and my experience there was horrible (2/5), but the food at this location was DELICIOUS.  By the end of the meal I downed my entire bowl and was drinking some of my buddies broth lol. Let's make this clear - the broth is not healthy.  It's a heart-attack waiting to happen.  It's thick, fatty, and creamy (it's so thick you can't see the bottom of your bowl).  What makes this bowl stand out from other ramen places are the green onions.  The broth is also DROWNED in green onions (a favorite of mine).  Having said the above, if you don't like green onions, pork broth, and fatty soups (lol), this place is not for you. TIPS: -Expect a long wait time.  We showed up at 10:30 PM and we had a 45 minute wait time.  There's a bar next door called The Far Bar (about 3-4 stores down) that has cheap STIFF drinks ($7-$8) and great selection of microbrews (about $6-$8 a pint).  Prices are reasonable, service & food are good; grab a beer and some wings while you wait.

I've been here a few times and in terms of the ramen itself, I think it's probably the one of the best (if not the best) tasting ramen I've ever had. The broth is rich and savory. The pork chashu is tender and delicious. The noodles were perfectly cooked, not to soggy but not too hard. The only down sides was that it was extremely warm and cramped in there, and the wait could get long during prime hours. I went there in the summer once and there was no air conditioning. I was sweating like crazy and I had to keep asking for refills on ice water because I felt like I was in a sauna. I would definitely recommend this ramen joint to any one looking for legit japenese ramen around the LA area. Come during odd hours!

I gotta admit, I'm not not a big fan of ramen, at all. But this place does have me second guessing myself. Maybe, I should give ramen another chance...I really don't have to say much about the pork ramen here, because the pork broth speaks for itself. If I'm not a believer of ramen, but this place was good to me, it's definitely gonna get an A with all the ramen lovers! Very small, and popular so be prepared to wait a while.

Really!?  I'm getting disappointed with people here.  Unless the quality has gone down significantly on Fridays...  or sporadically, still not an excuse. First of all, gyoza tastes too salty with no real flavor.  The gyoza's texture is like dull gluten.  It was prepared sub-par to most places I've tried.  And I'm really not that picky when it comes to noodle and gyoza.   Talk about ramen.... they put cold cooked egg!  Cheap tricks!  Instead of the well prepared egg that has slight gelatin like appearance in egg yoke, they choose to use cheap method to have to egg cooked way before and put them in frige.  The noodle doesn't stand out and I couldn't taste the broth because gyoza was so salty.

I wait for long time Ramen was oh very good But A/C needs work. A Haiku to sum up my experience at Daikokuya. This famous eatery in Little Tokyo never ceases to have a line of people waiting to chow down on the famous Japanese Ramen. This place is so well known for the ramen that they only have 2 varieties, and that's more than enough honestly. The broth is savory and warms the soul, the noodles are just right, the pork slices are to die for....but I would probably die of heat exhaustion first. This little place, and I mean little, has a real problem with air circulation, and the A/C does little to nothing to help. In winter, I imagine that it's WONDERFUL, but standing outside in 85 degree heat for forty minutes and coming inside to eat hot noodles in an even hotter restaurant, isn't so fun. Alas, the 4-star merit is still well deserved because I'll definitely be back...in December.

The best part of the Daikoku Ramen is the broth....super flavorful with the pork being cooked in it all night!  I got the extra kotteri flavor - my friend got the regular one and didn't notice a significant difference but the kotteri seems to make the broth a tad bit richer and fattier.  You get quite a good portion for lunch (was tempted to order gyoza to start but glad I didn't).   It's a small place and gets very busy so I suggest getting there before noon.  There's counter and table seating so if you don't mind sitting at a counter you might get in faster.  Parking can be challenging but was able to find street parking in front - meter is $3 for 1 hour (max 2 hours) on weekday (not sure what the policy is on weekends).  There was also a structure/lot across the street for $6.

I love Daikokuya.  I would drive four hours to LA just to get Daikokuya.  I have only been to the original location in Downtown LA.  All the other reviews hit the spot, but one thing I would suggest is go early.  They open at 11am, and we got there at 11:45am once, and there was a wait already.  Get there early!  Do not wait until you are starving to go; you might not make it!

As a denizen of Norcal, coming to Daikokuya was an absolute delight. Though we have plenty of good ramen places around the bay, there's just something about Daikokuya's ramen that makes it especially delicious. We were lucky enough to come during off hours (around 3-4pm) with a party of two, so we barely waited ten minutes before being seated at the counter, where we were able to watch the chefs work their magic. The decor may not be classy, but it felt wonderfully Japanese -- enough to invoke nostalgia of long hours spent shooting the breeze at ramen-ya back in Kyoto. Good times! In short: The portions are generous, the ramen is delicious (especially the koteri), and even the side orders aren't bad. We got a combo with a salad, miso soup and mini oyakodon, which was tasty, but ended up having to prioritize our limited stomach space and concentrate on the heavenly, heavenly ramen. Now, if only they would open a branch in the bay area...

Maybe I don't have a great understanding of ramen, because I found the ramen here disappointingly lacking in flavor. After waiting about 45 minutes to get in on a Monday night, I was expecting to have my mind blown. Maybe my expectations were too high? I just got a large bowl of soup that lacked-- savory-ness? There was barely any meat in my bowl, also. I did try my friend's ramen with the kotteri added and found it much tastier. His fried rice was amazing, too, so I'd be willing to go again and just order differently.

4.5/5 stars the ramen was realllly good! i came here with a friend because she was craving japanese ramen. i heard there was  a really good ramen place so i yelped and we found this place. we saw a line so we knew it must be pretty good. we wrote our names on the paper and decided to wait inside because it was cold outside. the wait was about 20-30 mins. its a small restaurant and there were a lot of ppl so it took a while. we were waiting inside and the decor is really cute. i felt like i was in japan waiting to eat ramen. we were finally seated. i kinda wished we got a table but were seated at the bar area. being a girl it was kinda hard to put my stuff- purse, jacket- anywhere. luckily we were at the corner so i just put it against the wall =/ we ordered the famous ramen, i think they only have like 2 kinds with different ways to eat it. and we ordered a spicy tuna roll. the food got to us pretty fast. we started to eat and the ramen was soooo good. it was a lot of food. so glad we didn't order more. the broth was oh so yummy and the pork was oh so tender. the egg wasn't the amazing runny yolk kind i was expecting. the roll was ok. my friend and i totally fell in love with the ramen and want to go again asap! also its cash only!

So I decided to try this place since I work near it. I took my girlfriend and her sister there and the experience wasn't that great. First the wait is long which I understand everyone likes this place or its just the hype that everyones following. The food wasn't that great. It could've been better. The service wasn't OKAY, wasn't great, wasn't bad. I probably would not come back since I prefer Orochon Ramen.

I first tried Daikokuya well over a year ago and I have long since been a huge fan of their food! Their ramen broth is superb. It is rich in flavor, pleasing in texture, and made the ramen. The portion was pretty epic as well. Although Daikokuya is known for its amazing ramen, I am completely in love with their Oyako-don bowl (chicken and egg bowl). It's so simple and delicious and a must try in my opinion. and Their Gyoza is wonderful, my sister went nuts over the ramen and gyoza. Only downsides about Daiko is that it is small, the wait is long, and gets hot quickly (get a table or seat by the door if possible or eat before the rush)

Not the first time I've eaten here, but I just don't get the line at midnight. I've had better ramen. 1.)Sausage made with kurobota pork 2.)Daikokuya Ramen, boiled egg, pork belly, egg noodles, soy sauce broth. 3.)Three sapporo's and two bottles of nigori sake. I enjoy hanging out in Little Tokyo bot the 45 minute wait for Daikokuya is a pain.

Hearing that there are lines at Daikokuya, we arrived at around 10:45am before they opened at 11am.  There was only a few people ahead of us but it definitely was full by the time they opened. Whew smart move!  Parking can be a pain in this area so we just decided to pay $5 for parking.  It is a simple venue with bar stools to eat.  Not quite a hole in the wall. I like how they provide different combinations and appetizers. Ordered: 1. Daikokuya Ramen in the fattier broth of tonkotsu combo with tuna sashimi rice bowl The bowl of ramen itself is bigger than usual! I was very surprised but the egg was delicious. Not as good as orenchi since it wasn't completely medium boiled dripping yolk, just the way I like it. Tuna sashimi, of course, I couldn't expect top notch sashimi. It was alright but you were able to tell it wasn't very fresh. Damnit should of stuck to unagi! I am glad I got to try this place after hearing about it so much!  Definitely would come back here again!

The noodles are delicious! But I don't think I'm going back because I don't think it's worth the wait.. They are yummy, but not so spectacular that I would spend 45 minutes waiting in line.. The ramen has the right consistency, not soggy at all and chewy but not hard! The egg had been marinated in maybe some sweet sauce? and was soft-boiled to perfection. The pork was so good that I felt like it melted in my mouth! I was just not impressed by the broth. It was delicious but a bit plain, nothing exceptional about the broth that makes the ramen different from some good ramen I had before. So, maybe that's why I wouldn't come again because personally the broth is the key ingredient to a successful bowl of ramen! I didn't even bother finishing the soup after done with the ramen.. Too bad. The gyoza was a complete failure! They were deep fried for too long, a bit dark brown on the outside. The skin was not crispy at all and was soaked in oil. Seems like they were fried a few hours ago... I fried better gyoza that come straight from the frozen pack :P The pork cutlet rice was just okay. The yummiest thing was the sweet eggs and onions. The pork itself had a good flavor but wasn't tender enough. Service was excellent! Servers were knowledgeable and attentive. Price was very reasonable as well! $8.95 for a bowl of ramen! It's pretty hot and stuffy in there with the hot food and crowd. Anyway, I would say try different ramen shops to compare with this one. There is no point to keep going back to wait in line if other ramen places are comparable. And given that their ramen is not spectacular, I wouldn't go back. Diakokuya, thanks for the amazing ramen though!

I used to love this place and thought it was the best place EVER for ramen, until I found santoka. Nevertheless, a giant heaping bowl of ramen on a rainy day always hits theeee spot for me. Don't go on weekends. Prepare to wait or try to go early before it opens to miss the lunch crowd or go way way later. Goyza is delightful. so is the fried rice bowl. mmmm ^_^

Hm, more of a 3.5, it's a pretty solid place but it's not perfect. Obviously it's all about the broth here, and it's a very rich version of ramen. True ramen purists, especially those from Japan, may not like it as much - at least that's what I discovered when a friend from the Hakata region visited (she was much happier when we went to Shinsengumi). Sometimes the egg and/or the noodles aren't done perfectly, such as the egg being overdone or the noodles being a little mealy or soggy, but overall it's a filling package. They've expanded to a few other places, like a small stand in Arcadia, but those definitely do not taste as good. This original location in Little Tokyo - I've been a couple of times total, but I feel like it goes down a little every time. First time was the best. Meanwhile the wait and crowds only expand...

my office has been moved to 3 blocks away from this place. finally i got a chance to check out this ramen place which has 3000+ reviews and 4 stars rating on yelp. is it a legendary for a ramen place quite popular like this? but i have to say their ramen disappointed me so did their beef bowl. if you really like ramen, i would suggest you to go santouka in torrance. it's worth to drive a little bit further and you don't have to wait in a 30-45min line to get a ramen.

Everyone is going to have their preference for favorite ramen place. Having tried Shinsengumi, Santouka, Ramen Jinya I have to say Daikokuya offers the best in terms of taste and portion. Let me clarify on taste: If you like a cleaner, less oily broth (albeit a little plain tasting at times) Shinsengumi is the way to go. If you like really bold tasting broth with a slightly thicker consistency (albeit quite oily and fatty), then Santouka or Ramen Jinya is the way to go. Want something in between as a happy medium?...Enter Daikokuya. A bowl of Daikokuya always hits the spot. From the excessive amount of scallions they put in the bowl to the soup done just right, it's as good as it gets. The downside of course will always be the wait. But there's a reason for the wait; and it's worth it!

We arrived by Metro around 12:40 on a Saturday afternoon and were finally seated at around 1:20.  It was near 90's outside, so this was a tough wait, and the waiting area inside is cramped.  I swear we waited longer (number of minutes) than pretty much any party there -- including ones that came after us.  Just bad luck with us being a pair and people taking too long at the bar, I suppose. All the "foodies" waiting in line here were such a turn-off.  One lady walked in like five times in a 15-minute time span to see if she and her man were any closer to being seated.  Uhh, no, ma'am, you were after us.  When we were finally seated at the bar, an obnoxious (loud) guy was taking pictures of everything with his DSLR.  Excusable if you're a tourist, but come on. Anyway, I carefully watched the order in which our orders were taken, and our took longer than everyone else's!  Again, bad luck.  We just had a beer and two ramens -- nothing special.  Having a blazing wok going in front of me was definitely not my preference, also.  When I got my order, I did like my noodles, and the broth was quite good.  I passed along the pork, but the egg was boiled nicely, and the bamboo was definitely authentic. Service was okay... you have to flag the waitresses down to get a water refill, though as soon as it looks like you're done with your ramen, they hand you a check. Overall, the ramen is probably one of the best I've had, but I'm not going to reveal my favorite on here so that the place doesn't get as hyped and crowded as this one.  I would not come back for anything but the ramen... the wait isn't really that worth it.

We were down in L.A and thought, huh, there must be a really good ramen place. So I looked it up and saw the ridiculous raves about Daikokuya - how could you not want to try it? Well first, know that there is at least 1h30 of wait. If they tell you 20min, they mean 2h. Second, there is no place to wait. I think there's 2 lonely chairs, one on each corner of the entrance. So if you're going when it's cold, because that's when ramen is most delicious, then you're waiting outside. We finally get seated and order the Daikokuya special, and a kakuni style appetizer. The appetizer is AMAZING, which is why Daikokuya gets the 3 stars. The sauce, the preparation, the tenderness.... omg. So good. Now the ramen. Meh. The noodles are oh-kay, they're pretty standard, like you would really find at your average ramen place. Really nothing special. The broth is not bad, but not excellent, and that's what kills it. I'm a world of forgiveness to noodles if the brooth is amazing. Well, it's not. Now for the worse sin. The egg. The egg is HARD BOILED. Argggghhhh. So: I ate 1/3 of the bowl and left. Will never return. As for you, look for another place, this is all hype.

Tried it here the other day. I came in and write the place is small and crowded. Must be good right? Order the ramen combo with a side of egg and chicken bowl. The salad that cane with it was okay, just lettuce with spicy mayo. Then came the rice and chicken bowl, which was good better than the ramen which came out next. The ramen broth came out a little flavorless and the egg they put in it was cold. The price was average, honestly I can find better in mitsuwa marketplace back at home. An average experience for an over hyped up place.

Good but not amazing. It is a BIG bowl - no frills. You get your soft boiled egg, thin slices of pork, and a few bamboo shoots, with lots of green onions. I'd eat this again, but wouldn't go out of my way to get it. And def wouldn't wait in a massive line for it.

Lets get this place to 4,000! So, my girlfriend told me about this place being a yelp top 10, and after seeing 3500+ reviews, I figured that the numbers spoke for themselves.  My Diakokuya journey started on tuesday when Ellie made plans to have dinner here.  Unfortunately, they were closed so i was unable to fulfill my ramen cravings.  I figured it was all good because we could go the next day.  Wouldn't you know, as luck would have it, it was closed on wednesday as well.  I was about to flip a table. 2 strikes already.  Luckily, they were open for sure on thursday and we had a green light.  We decided to go there for dinner around 8pm hoping and praying that the line wouldn't be ridiculously long.  Usually the WAIT TIME is about 45 minutes and we waited about 30.  The first thing we had to do though was find parking.  Since both of us were unfamiliar with the area, we drove around a few times until we found parking.  The cheapest place within walking distance that we saw was about $5.   Anyhow, after we parked, we walked over to the restaurant and waited outside.  We had a small group of 4 people.  As we waited, we had a transient (homeless person) come up to us.  This however was no normal bum.  He had some class and some guts.  He didn't simply ask for a hand out.  He introduced himself as a gentleman and greeted us as nice as could be.  He asked us if we could honor him by letting him sing a song to us.  He sang "Don't Leave Me" by The Temptations.  I was impressed, not so much by his singing ability, but more so by his boldness and his courage.  After he finished, the timing was just right and the hostess showed us into the restaurant. I was amazed to say the least.  Within minutes, I went from the feel of being in Little Tokyo in Los Angeles to the feeling of being in a legit Tokyo restaurant.  One of the details I noticed when I walked in was their menu.  It basically apologized for any inconvenience that might have happened because of the wait due to the philosophy they had of keeping the restaurant small so they could maintain a high level of quality service and food.  Two thumbs up. Luckily the wait wasn't 2 hours. As I walked into the quaint little ramen shop, I thought to myself how small it was.  Only a handful of tables and a bar area.  It wasn't long before I ordered my drinks and my ramen.  PRICED at $8.75 for a bowl about a foot in diameter was a win.  Very few times have my girlfriends eyes opened up wide and her jaw dropped in the presence of food, but this was one of those times. I knew immediately it was going to be a 5 Star.  Anyhow, their was green onion galore, with ambrosia like broth with thick, perfectly textured noodle.  Delicious.  My only regret is having a small stomach which couldn't eat any more.   Service was up to par of the food and I left with a full stomach and a great experience. Everyone must go!  Its worth the trouble of the drive and the wait.

If all men were like ramen, then what a warm, happy place this would be. I would take a hearty bowl of this stuff with no hesitation. I don't have a whole lot of experience with ramen but I can tell you that 1st world buck goes a long way here. You may have to wait long but once you're seated you can belly flop right into the stuff and it seems never ending. It's like you immediately come down with a case of hungry eyes! A great Little Tokyo staple.

I have been coming here since my college years. Now I live in Chicago and consistantly have fond memories and cravings. I always visit when I am in LA. The biggest disappointment is that every time I go there I am hopeful that they have dusted and cleaned the place. I hate eating my food with chunks of dust on light fixtures, blinds, and pictures just hanging there waiting to drop into my face. I always sit there hoping that a gust of wind will not blow my way. PLEASE CLEAN YOUR RESTAURANT DAIKOKUYA. This visit was so sad. My egg was ICE COLD! My broth was TOO SALTY! My noodles tasted LESS THAN FRESH! I am looking for a new ramen place to satisfy my cravings and give me peace of mind (cleanliness).

We came all the way from San Jose and decided to try out this hyped up Ramen place. We waited about 40 minutes on a Saturday night, which is not too terrible given how popular this place seems. But since I waited so long, my expecatations were a little high. The place is tiny and the 4 of us sat at the bar. The ramen came out quick and service was good. The ramen itself was okay to me. We each got daikoku ramen (specialty). The first few bites were really good, but as I kept eating it, I noticed how oily the broth seemed and then the saltiness started to build up and I barely got through half my bowl. If you're ever up north, Izakaya Sozai has the best Ritsu Tonkotsu Ramen w/ pork belly in my opinion. Much better than this place. What made me really give it a 3 star was the appetizer that ruined my experience. The tuna sashimi was probably the worst I've ever had. Not even close to fresh at all and it was expensive! Overall, if you like ramen, I think you would enjoy it and should give it a try.

People are not exaggerating. I have been to every ramen place in the South Bay, Hataka is sublime but so is this. The ramen broth is not to be believed in it's rich depth of flavor. The noodles are perfectly cooked and have that wonderful chewiness. The staff was wonderful. We also sampled their eel bowl, and an assortment of sashimi. The fish was so fresh, and the eel was fatty, sweet, and melt in your mouth. If you enjoy ramen, I highly encourage you go there and get a ramen combo. You won't regret it. ****Note**** It's cash only but they have an ATM there.

I moved to LA about a year ago, and I was told by numerous amount of people, the one (if not only) place to eat ramen is in Downtown (Little Tokyo) is a Daikokuya. This place was so hyped up for me that I was so anxious to try it. It was only fitting that it had to be my first meals after moving. So, I did what all my fellow yelpers suggested. Go EARLY that way you don't have to deal with the line. Btw, thanks yelpers!  This has proven most beneficial to enjoy a meal on a hungry tummy. With not much of a wait my friends and I were able to get seated quickly. Service was fairly decent being that the line was steadily building but, being that its a "turn and burn" kind of restaurant my party waited quite a while for our check. Anyways,the ramen came out in good time. But, when I got my ramen it was an -eh- feeling. Let's just say, I wasn't blown away. I think I also had expectations of kotteri ramen, coming from Hawaii with the amazing Tenkaippin Ramen. I ordered: Daikokuya Kotteri Ramen.1/2 order. The noodles had a nice firmness to it, but the broth wasn't spectacular. It was flavorful, a little too fatty for me (yes, I know kotteri is pretty much super collagen rich chicken broth base). I was able to enjoy the tuna wrapped shiso app which I loved mostly because I die over anything shiso. The parking, downtown go figure. And bring cash, It's a cash only joint! Like my profile, I give every place 3 times before I write a review. Upside, they are definitely consistent. And if you are a Daikokuya ramen lover you will not be disappointed. The third time wasn't the charm in this case. I'm just not a Daikokuya fan, To each his own.

I went during the week at around 545pm and we had about  4parties in front of us making our wait time around 25mins from what I remember I ordered the famous ramen with a side of teriyaki chicken it was delicious I really have no complaints on the food or service I'll continue to try different ramen places and update my review

So I'm told the quality of the ramen has decreased a bit. But you're silly if you think that's gonna stop me from going back to this joint. Sure, there's always a wait. Sure, you have to write your name down on a list that NO ONE TELLS YOU ABOUT. And sure, it's a tiny place. But godDAMN if that ramen (and broth) ain't tasty. Add some of the pickled ginger sitting in front of you (yeah, that weird, pink-lookin' stuff) for some vinegary goodness.

I finally got to try the famous Daikokuya, and I'd say it pretty much lives up to the hype. They specialize in a tonkatsu broth, much like Orenchi Ramen in Santa Clara except Daikokuya has the option of Koteri made with back fat. It might not be healthy, but it sure is delicious. However, there were a few things that let me down a bit. First, their soft boiled egg didn't have as runny of a yolk as I'm used to. It was actually more gelatinous than it was runny. Also, I noticed that each bowl was inconsistent in how many Cha Shu slices you got. I only got two measly pieces, but other people in my party got three huge slices. Nonetheless, the bowl is HUGE, so there are no worries about leaving still hungry. Of course, their restaurant is literally a hole in the wall, so expect to wait forever to be seated. It's especially bad when there are some really rude people who love to sit at their tables after having paid their bill, just talking about random things knowing that people are waiting for their table.

YEARS after hearing my friends talk about this place, I finally get to try it!  I had to wait for an hour, which, to be perfectly honest, I don't think is worth it.  But since this was my first time, I didn't mind. Now, when I took my first slurp, I thought, "Okay...it's good.  Nothing it blowing my mind, but it's tasty."  But then I took another slurp, and another, and seven minutes later, I can completed inhaled my meal!  It was like the hour-long-wait was done on purpose to whet my appetite, and the ramen got tastier and tastier as I kept eating!  It occurred to me that the kotteri broth (pork fat) was the closest thing in flavor to my favorite ramen joint IN TOKYO.  If that's not legit, I don't know what is. I was rather surprised at the lack of options; only one soup flavor, and no way to add extra toppings or change the firmness of the noodles, but restaurants with simple menus are usually pretty damn goo.  Make sure you bring your cash (they kindly remind you with signs in the door and at every seating booth), and your empty tummy!  Also, it seems they seat groups of four faster than groups of two, so make it a double date!  We were almost ready to team with up another random couple just so we could get in faster!

Ate there this evening and a funny thing happened.  My bowl of daikoku ramen arrived, I took a bite and thought "it's...okay, maybe even a little bland". But then I kept eating. And eating. And eating. And by the time I ate half the bowl, I realized that it was really good!   I didn't care for the pork belly so much, the broth is pretty mild and the noodles are a little thicker than other ramen I've tried but the green onions and sesame seeds really add a lot to the dish. I also ordered the tsukemono (assorted pickles) and enjoyed those. They weren't too vinegary or salty, the way pickels can be. Things to know:  it's hotter than hades in there.  I got there around 7pm and scored the last seat at the counter. The place was packed w/people waiting out the door and it was just. So. Darn. Hot.  Especially sitting at the counter, in front of stove.  The service is really good. My water was kept filled, everyone was cheerful and the food came out relatively quickly.  And it IS a cash only joint these days. There's a sign as soon as you walk in, there's signage in the booths and on the counters and when I asked if they accecpted credit cards for $10 or more, she said no. Fortunately, there's a Citibank atm right across the street. Now, back to the ramen. Overall, I liked my meal a lot and the bill tallied in around $16, which included tax and a 25% tip. The bowl was the size of my head, I kid you not. It was just enormous. So if I lived around here and ate there regularly, I'd share the ramen with someone. There's defintiely enough for two!

Right off the bat, you can tell Daikokuya is good by the absurdly long line for dinner, even at 11 PM. The ramen is utterly amazing. It is really the best ramen I've had to date. There really are no words to describe how utterly delicious the soup is, how well the noodles compliment the soup, and how the sliced pieces of pork are heaven's little addition to the bowl of pure wonderful. Price is standard 9-12 dollars per bowl, but well worth it. The fried rice is also on par with the ramen. Its seasoned so well and evenly, yet not overly salty as to necessitate a sip of the iced oolong tea (which is great by the way). The only downside is the long, long wait, but it moves pretty quickly. Half an hour for 8 parties ahead isn't too bad. Service: 4 Food: 5 Ambiance:3 Overall, it's about a 4, but the ramen is worth it. It's so worth the pricey parking and the long wait. Do it.

This place is quite possibly the spot with the best ramen around. Ever. There's no denying it once you feasted on their house ramen. At first, you'll notice that it's a very small restaurant with a lot of people crowding around its front doors, but don't let that deceive you. It's crowded, and for a good reason. Their house ramen is served with a healthy serving of pork, bean sprouts, onions, bamboo, egg, and all topped with delicious broth. Seriously. Once you sip the broth, you'll just fall into heaven. Be sure to bring an extra pair of underpants to change into after you're done devouring the broth. It's THAT delicious. It's also conveniently located within walking distance of all the pretty sights of LA as well. I'll definitely be stopping by this place again whenever I'm in the area!

Never a fan of ramen, this place wasn't horrible but it was okay. The service was pretty good like.... most japanese restaurants that I've been to. It doesn't worth the wait in my opinion. I usually get ramen from Santouka ramen in Mitsuwa Market which I think it tastes better. Overall, I wouldn't be coming here again because of the wait.

BEST RAMEN PLACE in L.A.!! Small restaurant, usually a wait (can be up to about an hour, depending on the time when you go there) but well worth it. I usually get their combination which I LOVE: Daikokuya Ramen + small shredded pork bowl (you can select from a variety of bowls or fried rice) + a salad (thinly sliced cabbage with a wonderfully delish dressing)...and a side gyoza. Also, my favorite spot for Hiyashi Chu-Ka (cold noodle) when in season. MmmMmm. Meter parking on the streets or parking structures nearby.

Rich pork fat broth will cure any nasty hangovers. Daikokuya ramen is good for lunch, dinner, or at anytime of the day. I've dined here many many time over several long years.. Always taste great(consistent)!! There are many ramen places here in LA but none that makes me drive out wo my make up and wait in a line like Daikokuya does. Go ahead..Try it!

I'm a little perverse in that I actually love the experience of waiting 2 hours for food.  Is that weird?? Going into this, I thought I was going to be disappointed.  You see, I don't even like ramen all that much and this was supposedly the most hyped-up ramen in LA. Wow...was I wrong. Dear heavenly father, it was a sin to have wronged this place. From this experience on, I have kept an open mind about ramen.

Wooo Daikokuya!  I should really say this place is a tie for best ramen in LA with Shinsengumi in Gardena.  In my mind, I only put it second because the drive is longer, but really, they are equally amazing. The wait is long.  You WILL wait to get ramen here.  There are very few tables and very many people interested in eating here.  Sometimes people get tired and leave and you gain a few minutes!  Huzzah! I recommend visiting the local shopping center and wandering around and periodically have someone from your group check to see if you've moved up at all on the list.  Oh, and don't go in big groups.  No no no no NO.  Unless you want to wait all night. On to the food! The broth does not have any options.  You might complain about this...but you should shut your mouth.  These people know what they are doing and you will eat the broth as its served.  Because it is heaven.  It's like when you go to a really good steakhouse and you can't find the salt and pepper.  It's because you shouldn't (and won't) need them.   The standard order comes with an egg, some pork, bean sprouts, and green onion.  You can recommend that some of these be removed if you'd like.   The gyoza is amazing here.  You should get it. Service is outstanding despite the constant flow of customers.  Enjoy your ramen, sip a beer, and bask in your arrival to ramen paradise.

OK, first off, this is the best ramen I've tried so far. It's so delicious, savory, and flavorful. I've been all over from Orange County to San Francisco tryin different Ramen places, but the Daikokuya in Little Tokyo is the est so far. I've even tried other Daikokuyas, but they don't compare. The soup is rich. The sides are amazing. I enjoy the salad, although I do wish there was a karaage option like in Monterey Park Daikokuya. If you order the soup with kotterri flavoring, you can't go wrong in taste. It's simply delicious, although we'll see how you feel later when your cholesterol goes up. I really do enjoy coming here, and I make the effort when I'm in the area. It's cash only though and the wait can get pretty long. If I lived close by, I'd definitely be here all the time. I took a star off because the place is very small and overcrowded. It breaks my heart to do so, but it does bother me. I do like the new A/C because last summer they didn't have it and I overheated in there.

They keep it simple here. The Berkshire pork or Kubota is what makes the ramen  special. Probably why they only have one type of Ramen on the menu. The BEST RAMEN you will ever taste. Berkshire Pigs are a rare breed of pig originating from Berkshire in England but the pig is also bred in the Kagoshima Prefecture of Japan under the trademarked name Kagoshima Kurobuta. Kurobuta pork is prized for it's juiciness, flavour and tenderness. It is heavily marbled and pink hued. It's high fat content makes it suitable for long cooking and high temperature cooking and that is exactly what they do to it here at Daikokuya. They simmer the pork bones to create a broth for hours in a secret location. Yup it's that serious. Now you know why the Ramen is so good.

OMG B.E.S.T. TONKATSU RAMEN EVER! Despite the 1.5 hour wait at midnight?? If I lived in LA, I would definitely come here really often, but too bad I'm not a local! The broth, ramen, and pork were all perfect! Though some may say that the broth may be too fatty because it tends to solidify by the end of your meal (haha....) But if you're not drinking all of the broth, you should be fine.. for now.

You would think that if a restaurant has over 3300 reviews with 4-star average, it will be amazing. Well, not so. -It is pretty small; -It doesn't take reservations; -It is busy; -It is not very clean; -It has signs like "cash only"; -Okay priced; -It is pretty authentic: most cooks and wait staff are Japanese; -The food is good, but nothing to write home about. I'm glad I went (perhaps I even had the best ramen there, especially given that I don't like ramen), but I don't get the whole hype about this place. It is not a 4-star restaurant in my opinion.

I'm a germophobe, but I like the ramen here so much I'm willing to stomach the dirtiness of this place (Daikokuya has, like, a B health rating) for it! Actually, I lied; my favorite thing about this place is not the ramen (though the ramen is just about as good as ramen gets), but the fried rice. Get it with extra ginger and garlic, and it will be the best fried rice you've ever tasted!

I seriously doubt my review will matter at this point (3000+ reviews?  Seriously?  Only in big cities like LA). Here are some things you need to be aware of when you go to this place: 1.  There is now a new parking structure just north of West 1st street that they built rather recently that charges $1 an hour.  I would definitely take advantage of that. 2.  This place is cash only.  No joke on the $$ sign.  If you are a big eater like me, get ready to pay $10+.  Make sure you bring cash with you or else there is a Chase bank right across the street.  They charge $3 if you don't have a Chase account. 3.  Get ready to wait.  We were there 1:30 PM on a Friday afternoon and we didn't get seated for another 30+ minutes.  If you're hungry while waiting, it's gonna suck to be you.  We left at 4 PM and people were STILL waiting.  No joke. 4.  The fried rice is better than any of the other locations I've ever been to.  SO MUCH better than any other Daikokuya locations.  It's OUTSTANDING! 5.  They still have the big bowl of noodles, none of that silly half paper/plastic bowl crap that some of the other locations have taken up.  The soft boil egg is amazing, the soup is unforgettable, and the noodles were cooked just right.  So so good.... 6.  The service isn't great or horrid.  The head waitress was really nice but our own waitress was mediocre. I definitely will be back.  Make sure you go to the EAST 1st street and not WEST 1st street!!!!  Boy, I hate LA street names!

Daikokuya is a business that runs on what I like to call a "No Bullshit Policy". What's the "No Bullshit Policy" you ask? Well, it's kind of similar to how the Soup Nazi runs his restaurant in that one episode of Seinfeld. Basically, you eat, you pay, you get the fuck out, no bullshit. Anyone who has been here more than once would know that there is an extremely long line to get a table/booth in Daikokuya. And that is the reason why Daikokuya will not take shit from their customers. If you're not present when your name is call, too fucken bad, next group. If you're coming here with a group of more than 4 people, good luck. You can expect to wait possibly hours for a booth. Don't bother calling in for the reservation because they don't take reservation. Someone seriously need to open up a ramen place next to Daikokuya and take their leftover customer. I came here twice, ordered the regular ramen both times. They have generous portions, so expect to be full & satisfy. I love their broth because it's not as salty as Santouka.  I love their soft boiled egg in the ramen... rich creamy golden goodness...  *Homer Simpson drooling sound* I would come here more often for ramen if it wasn't so damn far from the UCLA campus + parking is pretty terrible in Downtown LA. The line here is usually horrendous, so Santouka is a good alternative if you really don't want to wait or drive all the way out to Downtown LA if you're in West Los Angeles. Preparation for Daikokuya: - Tent - Playing Cards - Mahjong Set (including Table and 4 Stools) - Bring a snack

Went here this past Saturday and was so glad we beat the lunch rush since other yelpers have mentioned the 1-2+ hour wait times. Got there right when they opened and scored seats at the bar. Ordered their Daikoku ramen bowl with extra back fat aka "kotteri" flavor. Sounds gross, but was super tasty. Everything about it was fantastic, however I kept comparing it to Santouka. Santouka's broth is much more flavorful! I remember slurping up every single last drop of soup there, while I barely finished half of the broth at Daikokuya. Also, there were only two pieces of meat in my bowl...Santouka gave me a whole plateful of meat. Yum. If I didn't have Santouka to compare this place to, I'd give it 5 stars. The service was good, food came out quick and and it WAS delicious. I tried some of the husband's salad (that dressing is crazy good!!) and his fried rice (WOW! want more now!), which he got as a combo with his ramen. Such a good deal for less than $13 or so. Parking was definitely a nightmare.. We ended up paying $6.50 to park in a nearby lot. It was all day parking though, so we took advantage of that and hung out at Japanese Village.

This is the best Ramen Ive had in CA, really. What makes this unique is the "kotteri" broth. its basically pure Pork fat broth: miso based, with fat bits in every bite. Not only was it good for my hangover, but my complexion was glowing as soon as I left the restaurant. The noodles have a good bite to it, and the cha siu slices are tender and thick in its cut. Huge servings, good service, DAMN GOOD RAMEN. I liked Santouka, I really like Daikokuya. NOTE: Go early otherwise you will have to wait!

Overview - Parking: There's a new parking structure at the intersection of S. San Pedro St. / Judge John Aiso and E. 1st St. (the structure is located at John Aiso) with a sign that says $1 rating for 1st two hours ... however I paid $3 for almost 2 hours, but hey it's better than paying $4 or $5 if you are here just for Ramen. Side street parking also works, but the parking structure is relatively empty.   --- Price: Daikokuya ramen + a bowl of chicken teriyaki combination is $12.50 and one sausage plate (you get 5 sausages) is $5.00 (THIS PLACE IS CASH ONLY) --- Environment: There's always a waiting line - it's typically ranges from 30 min to possibly 1 hour+; but once you are in, you can smell delicious food already ~ --- Food: Daikokuya ramen - broth is not too greasy and not too salty, great ramen, and pork belly is so tender - pure taste of perfection (5/5) Chicken teriyaki bowl - favorite is a bit light, but the chicken itself tasted very good (kinda grilly) (4/5) Sausages - Yummy! The chef sizzled the sausages and all five sausages tasted just as good as Sinbala's sausages (4.5/5) --- Rating: 5/5 for overall experience; the only downside is bad parking, but it's definitely worth it for their food !

Awesome ramen place. However, I think this place is a little overrated and waiting line is always crazy long. The flavor isn't fascinating, but still good enough to create addiction. I always order miso ramen combo with katsudon bowl or shredded pork bowl. They are really good to go with the ramen. Restaurant is pretty small and wait can be long as an hr!! Really? for a freakin ramen? But despite the wait, you won't regret dining here. There are also many side dishes that will fulfill your appetite.

before coming here, i heard that this place was really good, blah blah. the wait to get in and finally get to try it was around 45 mins or so because we had a pretty large group and this place is just ridiculously small.. got their ramen. to be honest, i was extremely disappointed that they only had one type of ramen. it took a while for the ramen to come and by then i was beyond starving and expecting delicious noodles. not what i expected. the ramen i got was warm...yes WARM. not even hot. i assume it is because of the bean sprouts that they put in that made the ramen cold because it seemed like half my bowl was bean sprouts. i also got what seemed like half a cup of chopped green onions, but i wont complain about that because i love green onions. my egg was half cold, half warm and fully cooked yolk, which was weird because my friends who ordered the same ramen had semi raw yolks.... my friend let me have her semi raw yolk egg and i totally regret taking her offer because the egg tasted really funky... it tasted like there was rice wine in it? i cant really explain it but it was just weird overall. the pork was nice and fat, melt in your mouth, but it just lacked taste. the only good thing was the ramen noodles... the soup was average. a bit too salty too actually. also tried the chicken with egg bowl or whatever as a part of the combo. didnt really like the chicken, kept biting chicken tendons. pretty nasty to be honest. the sauce was also too sweet. another thing i tried was the shredded pork with rice. the pork was delicious but there was way too much sauce and it was too salty overall. never again am i coming here.

I came here with my dad and sister who has never tried ramen before. We parked in some lot and paid for parking. It's not very street parking friendly. There are lots that you can pay for. When we arrived, we put our name on the list. It's a very small, casual place. It seems like a popular place for business people to come to lunch (I noticed a lot of working people in suits eating and I overheard conversations regarding business matters) and it also seems like lots of tourists come here to visit. We waited about 20-30 minutes for lunch. We had a bar seating. When I opened the menu, I actually expected more options for the ramen. My dad and sister ordered the Daikoku ramen. My sister got the half size (which is $2 cheaper). I decided to try something different so I went for the kotteri flavor ramen. I am sure you can add for extra ingredients or different ingredients but I wanted toasted seaweed but it comes standard with a marinated boiled egg, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, green onions and chashu. The ramen came in reasonable, fast time. We didn't wait too long for it.  I added garlic and the spicy seasoning to my dish because I love spicy food and food with garlic. I enjoyed my ramen but the presentation wasn't exceptionally pretty or anything. The broth definitely did NOT have msg, it wasn't extremely salty or anything like that. The noodles were perfectly chewy. The broth was definitely rich in flavor. The bamboo shoots was not what I was expecting, they seemed undercooked or crispy enough. Something was off with the bamboo shoots and I love them in my ramen. Overall, it was very filling and it had lots of meat, vegetables and noodles in it. I tried my dad and sister's broth for daikoku, their broth seemed to be more rich in flavor than mine. I can see why people think this place has the best ramen because the broth has good flavor, no msg, simple ingredients. The wait staff is extremely nice but sometimes they might be difficult to understand due to their accent. They try their best to move things quickly across and ensuring people enjoy their ramen.

I was first introduced to Daikokuya at this location but the one in Hacienda Heights has quickly become my favorite and now I know why. Although I have to admit that the ramen here is quite delicious I have to say that the quality has gone down quite a bit. I came here last night with some friends and I think Albert L. would have to agree that the egg is overcooked and cold! All true ramen lovers know that the egg in the soup has to be semi-raw so the delicious golden yolk drips out into the broth. This was definitely not the case last night. Also, this place is just way too hyped up and that is why there is always a 30 min+ line outside the door. I highly suggest you walk down the street to Shin Sen Gumi for better quality ramen.

Love this place, but I hate the wait.  The line is only long because the place is so small and has very limited tables.  Big groups? Definitely stay away. That said, they do have very good raman.  In my opinion, this place definitely beats Ajisen and other raman places around LA/OC.  Warning though, the Daikokuya inside the market on Harbor/Baker does not taste the same and probably is one of the worst raman.  This Daikokuya is 180 degrees different. 1 - 5 (5 being excellen) Service - 4 Raman - 4 Rice Bowls - 3 Parking and accessibility - 1 Price to Value - 4

I have been here numerous times, and each time I'm here there's are loads of people waiting to get seated.  The wait can be anywhere from 15-40 minutes.  I assume it's their trademark to keep all the Daikokuya Ramen houses tiny.   I always order the Daikokuya Koteri Ramen, and sometimes their combo.  The combo consist of the Ramen, a small salad, and a bowl of either fried rice, chicken teriyaki bowl, a chicken teriyaki with egg, or an eel bowl.  It's your choice on what you would like to have with the noodles. I see the cooks and the waitresses always hustling inside.  The whole restaurant is so small that you smell the food being cooked since the kitchen is right in front of the bar top. This J-Town place is a bit divey.  The walls, tables, and floors are a bit sticky from all the cooking and heavy traffic.  So cleanliness is a bit not there.  Hopefully they clean everyday.  They at least have decent food, and it's not that expensive.  This place is always a go for me. If you plan to come, just be ready for the wait.

Unlike the opinion of many other reviewers, I think this place isn't as good as the joints in SF (Katanaya, Dojo, Orenchi), or the ramenya's in NY (Totto, Ippudo). The must try's are the fried rice and shredded pork rice. I love that they are generous with the noodles and the broth unlike most places; I would recommend splitting with someone. BROTH: I got Kotteri (with fat), and man it was fatty. The creaminess reminded me of milk. It was pretty good, but I've had better elsewhere. For fatty broth lovers in NorCal, go to Orenchi. Many claim they use less MSG here, but 30 minutes later I was pretty parched. NOODLES: I usually like this type of squiggly noodle (vs. the thin and straight noodle). It's a bit thicker, and I think egg-based. However, it wasn't very bouncy here, it was just kinda hard. I think they cooked it perfectly al dente, I was just not a fan of the quality of this noodle. TOPPINGS: They soft boil an egg, but because they don't make it to order, the insides are gooey but cold. It's a little gross eating a cold runny egg, but I know many other ramen houses have to do this in order to meet demand. You can't add extra toppings. Some people gripe about how they use too many green onions but I didn't mind it.

The noodle was cooked to perfection! and the soup was good to drink too! and i don't usually drink ramen soup. overall everything was good!

This place is delicious! I'm not really a ramen aficionado, but even I can tell that this place is a top-notch ramen place. In terms of ramen, you only get one choice, their house special ramen but that is seriously the only thing you need--any deviation from this would be a crime. They do offer you the option of putting more pork fat in there; I haven't tried it though because I've heard that it can send the bowl over the top and make you feel really fat haha. However, I've also heard that the back fat is really good, so in the end it just depends on your personal preference. But the ramen without the back fat is good enough! You also have the option of getting their ramen combo, which comes with one rice side dish and a small house salad (shredded cabbage with thousand island). The rice dishes alone are amazing too, and I would totally get a giant dish of their fried rice if the place wasn't so G-darned famous for its ramen! I'm poor so I get the cheapest combo (so fried rice or the pork bowl)...both bowls have the deliciously prepared daikokuya pork in them, so you can't go wrong either way! I usually just choose the fried rice though because it's cheaper (I think) and it has pork along with egg and the Japanese pickled veggies. Beware though, the combo is a lot of food, so most people usually get the rice dish to go or just eat a little bit of it there. I eat both right then and there..wahh. It hurts so good! The combo usually comes out to like $15 tip included, so you get your money's worth. In terms of timing, try to go there for off-hours lunch or really late at night like before closing time, otherwise there may be a 1+ hour wait. Traffic and parking are also a pain in the butt being in the heart of downtown LA, but Daikokuya is definitely worth it ( especially if you haven't tried it yet but are in the area looking for a good meal).

Whether or not Im caught up in the hype of this place I must say that this is some damn good ramen and probably the best I've had. That's an honest answer, more so than people who think its the most amazing thing on earth because everyone else says so, and more so than those who give it lower reviews because they trying to be different from everyone else. Hype or it, great ramen. This place is definitely a lot better than Orochan, the ramen joint known for super spicy ramen and has been shown on the show Man vs. Food. Daikokuya knocks that place out of the park and beats it like a misbehaved child. The gist... High points: Go for the ramen. Why else would you be going here. Low points: Long lines. To avoid the lines try to come right when it opens.

So far, the best ramen yet. why? the broth is hea.rty, though somewhat salty, flavorful. The pork piece was moist and juicy, and the ramens were cooked just right. Their combos are worth it since you only pay $13 for a big bowl of ramen and a good size of rice and chicken and egg. Will totally go here again. If you want to go.. go  on a weekday when they open at 11am... still some line, but not long enough to worry about waiting in a long line. I left here around 12 and it was PACKED. The venus is a bit cramped, smoky and could use a good remodeling service... otherwise a great place for good ramen in Little Tokyo.

What can I say that 3400 people haven't already said? This place is good! The pork broth in the ramen is so rich and flavorful, unlike any broth I have had. The salad is delicious; thinly sliced cabbage with a mayo based dressing. The times we have been here we have gotten the combo, which comes with Ramen, salad, and your choice of something else, we have had the pork bowl, which was quite good, the fried rice- very delicious! The only thing I did not really like was the chicken bowl, kind of bland. The gyoza was good but in my opinion look better than they taste. We have never had to wait too long, but at times I have seen it really packed, it is a little warm in the summer but worth a little sweat. Despite my minor complaints this place is still  5 stars

Just another review to add to the 29304828320398493 existing ones, no big deal. So to repeat what everyone else has already said so that you can just be 101% sure that it is worth the wait... it is. Shouldn't be too hard to choose from the menu - they keep it simple. Daikoku Ramen bowl (if you're a super Ramen enthusiast, you can get it Kotteri style, which means they get the extra fatty parts and the broth is thicker. Fried egg on top is like the cherry on top. Pork belly is scrumptious, flavorful, and melts in your mouth along with all the other flavors / spices that makes up the magical broth. Be prepared for a long wait, but again, it's worth it. And I'm not even a Ramen enthusiast.

Not sure what the raves about, but this place is definitely not worth waiting 45+ minutes. Find some shade or buy an umbrella because you are about to get cooked like a pork belly. Ramen quality is somewhat on the salty side. It decent and not bad at all. But I expect better... Asian lady calling out numbers is very annoying. Her voice drags repeatedly too. In my honest opinion, the ramen at the Mitsuwa restaurant is the best!

You've heard the legends, seen the over 3000 yelp reviews, witnessed the absurdly long lines, what else is there to say? The ramen is absolutely delicious! There's no denying that. Is it really the best in all of LA? Weeeeell, debatable. I remember first getting to the gigantic line and thinking during our 1 and a half hour wait at 9 pm, "This ramen better be so good that I pee out gold tonight". Alas, maybe it was too much to wish for...but it truly was very good. I guess like other non-5 star reviewers, I just wasn't completely blown away. The broth was relatively tasty, the noodles were fairly firm, and the chiaosu pork was nice and tender, and overall, the flavor was good. It just wasn't wait-for-endless-hours good. I'm comparing mostly to my favorite ramen place: Shin-sen gumi and the major difference to me is the customizability. Even without extra charge additions, having the ability to preference the firmness of your noodles to the strength of your broth goes a long way and in my mind, allows a customer to get the full enjoyment out of their bowl. Although, I can understand Daikokuya sticking to their long standing tradition and from what I can tell, there are different styles of ramen so maybe I'm just ignorant. However, as an ignorant customer (which I would assume many people are), I think having options and not waiting a very long time are usually preferable choices. I will say this. The atmosphere of the place is very nice. It's not chaotic (shin-sen gumi) and has a very nice homey feel. The waitstaff is all very friendly and the service is super fast, probably due to the huge demand of hungry customers standing outside. So if you're in town and want to see what all the hype is about, definitely either make early dinner plans or bring a board game to play during your wait; a couple rounds of monopoly or risk should do :)

Do metered parking nearby, get the richer kotteri fat, and avoid peak dinning hours. To Hipsters: Parking is tough, so ride your fixie bikes and lock it to a parking meter. Side Joke: How much does a hipster weigh? ...an Instagram! Never come with more than 4, maybe 5 people. It'll be impossible for them to accommodate and you'll end up eating nearby at Suehiro Cafe because you yelp and it's the closest 4 star. The food here at Daikokuya: Delicious and Savory. The best broth compared to their many competitors nearby.

Best Ramen in LA...hands down.   That is all I am saying is best in LA, not their sushi, not their gyoza's, just their RAMEN.   Come here early when they first open or right before they close or else you will be waiting in line for a loooooong time.   Ordered the Tsukemen ramen which leaves the egg, onion, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, sesame seeds and pork belly out, for you to add in as you wish.  The broth is amazing, especially is you order it KOTTERI style, which uses added soup that has been extracted from the pork back fat.  SOOOO RICH.   Incredible soup, it was like eating a delicious bowl of ramen cooked in nothing but bacon fat, which is basically what it was.  I have dreams of this ramen to this day, my mouth is watering just thinking about it.

DAMN GOOD RAMEN. I heard it gets bizzay, so I came with some pledges like 10:50am for an early lunch/brunch kinda thang. We were already the 3rd party in line. Wowee! We got seated immediately when it opened, and our orders were taken right away. We all got the house special ramen with the back fat (extra fatty) broth. However, they said they didn't have it today, so we were brought regular broth. It was still super rich and good, buttttt then our waitress said they did have it and brought out little bowls with lumpy fatty stuff.... LOL it looked gross, but we mixed it into the broth, and it was great! MOAR FAT!!! MOAR RICHNESS!!! haha Serving size looks decent, but it's actually really filling. It's also really good with the garlic that is available at each table. We just ladled it into the soup. Nommy! Also, I think the egg is the best part! It's soft and like just sweet enough.. idk how they make it, but I wish I could learn to do so! :D Anyway, parking is not the best situation, but we were lucky enough to find street parking like right in front. $2/hr by the meter.. which is .. ok haha

SERVICE/AMBIANCE: -This restaurant is a true hole in the wall. Decorated with tons of signs that say "cash only." There is street parking or you can choose to park in the lot across the street for $5. We came here on a Tuesday night at 11pm hoping that there would be no wait at this time but boy were we wrong! We ended up waiting for about 30 minutes. Be sure to memorize what number you put your name under because they call out your number instead of attempting to pronounce your name. Haha. FOOD: -DAIKOKUYA RAMEN - Santouka has always reigned supreme in my opinion but it is now a close second. The noodles are the perfect consistency and the back fat broth is so delicious. The bowl comes with a soy sauce egg. The egg yolk is slightly undercooked so it's not chalky at all. I normally dont eat egg yolks at all but this one was so good I wanted another one! -FRIED RICE - Delicious! -SHREDDED PORK BOWL - Also delicious! The sauce tasted like what they normally put on an unagi bowl. The chunks of pork were so flavorful.

I've been to the one in Monterey Park and Arcadia, but never this one. This is the one to be at, I was told... and they were right. The ramen here is the right texture with the crinks still in the noodle. The egg is nice and soft but the yolk doesn't leak (where can I find leaking yolk?!) and the pork is just the right amount of fat so that it's tender. The broth is absolutely delicious. I can't say how or why, but it was just right. The one in Monterey Park was not hot enough and the one in Arcadia is usually too salty for me. But this one was perfect. I can't believe how late it's open. My date and I got seated after 5 minutes of waiting (SCORE!), but it was 11pm. There were still people waiting outside when we left!.

Long wait (about 45 min if you go during rush hours). Cash only. But totally worth it! I've been to this place a few times, and hands down, Daikokuya serves the best ramen I've eaten. Opt for a kotteri flavor if you want extra flavor in your broth. I've also had the shredded pork bowl. Equally good. Can't miss this place if you're in the LA area!

Quick tip: If you're a party of one, you can get in and out easily.  Otherwise, expect an (at least) one hour wait for 2 people, add 20 minutes for every additional person. Don't bother coming with over 5.  The ramen experience is best when you are extremely selfish.

Daikokuya was great, but I'm so sure that there is better ramen out there I've decided to give it 4 stars. The wait is ridiculously long and I swear you start to hate the people that are lounging around talking after their meal. I didn't let the wait influence how I viewed the food, though. I had the Daikokuya ramen and the Tuna sashimi over rice. The sashimi bowl wasn't that good and if I were in the midwest, it'd be an average quality sashimi. But this is in the WEST COAST. Serving sashimi this quality is unacceptable. The rice wasn't fantastic either, but what am I expecting, it's just rice. As for the ramen itself, I'm not sure if I've had Japanese ramen like this before, because all the Japanese ramen I've had usually had a very clean-tasting broth. This was more on the heavy side, and had a slight nutty taste to it, which was delightful. I appreciated the fact that there wasn't an overwhelming amount of MSG (at least the taste of it), which is usually what you get with broth everywhere else. The one compliant, if anything, was that the broth wasn't as hot as I had wanted (temperature wise). If it was a lot hotter I'm sure it would have made my day. The noodles were fine, it was exactly the right firmness. The best ingredient in the ramen by far was the pork. I don't know what they did with it but it was flavorful and a tad fatty, which was excellent. Perhaps I should have had the kotteri version, as someone suggested me to do so, but when I asked about "extra fat" to my waitress I don't think she understood a lick of English, so she just smiled and nodded, to which I just replied "nevermind." If I had to come again, I would definitely come when there isn't as many people. It's really good ramen, but maybe not worth waiting an hour or two for.

My roommates and I call it the Daikoke's for short--yeah, that's how often we speak of it. Despite it being in Little Tokyo (which is a bit away from Westwood, where I live), this has got to be my most frequented restaurant during my four years of living in LA. If you've had Japanese ramen before, then you're really going to appreciate the quality of this bowl. If you've never had Japanese ramen, then you're still going to think it's delicious, but you might not be able to appreciate how good Daikokuya actually is. IT'S OKAY THOUGH, give it another try in a couple of weeks or months and let that back fat really sink in next time. Oh yeah, ALWAYS get the back fat (Kotteri) because it makes your ramen that much more savory. The menu is pretty simple. It seems like they are very stringent on the experience they want their customers to have. They offer one bowl of ramen. Everyone gets to eat the same thing and you have the option of adding that back fat (Kotteri) that I mentioned. You can also get a combo meal, which is that bowl of ramen plus another small rice bowl of your choice (i.e. Chicken & Egg, Fried Rice, Eel, and several more). If you order a combo, you also get a small salad bowl as an appetizer. It's pretty much just shredded cabbage with thousand island sauce, but I love it. I would order the combo just to get the appetizer, but that's just me. Now, if you ordered a combo and want to make the most of your meal, I suggest not touching the small rice bowl at all. You will not have room for it! It makes a good breakfast or lunch for the next day and I usually have mine packaged to-go. The only bad thing I have to say about Daikokuya is the wait. It's a tiny place and you should definitely come with a large party. (A party of four is just large enough to avoid getting counter seats, which you might want to avoid.) Expect to wait! It actually makes you hungrier, which makes the ramen taste even better. There is a way around this, though: go right before closing! It closes at 11pm, 12am, or 1am, depending on the day, so get there 15-30 minutes before it closes and the wait will be significantly less (15 minutes vs. the usual 1-2 hours). If you do happen to go during primetime, there's a nice bar just down the street and a good ice cream/mochi place in the village plaza across the street if you're interested. Enjoy!

Meh, I don't see why this place has a crazy wait. My friends and I tried this place on a Thursday night at about 8:30PM. We waited approximately 40 minutes for a table! (You gotta love the inconsiderate kids that sit around and hold conversations of mindless drivel, when they've been done eating for the past 20 minutes, even though they see a ton of people waiting to sit.  Which is actually common for places like this.) Well, I was hoping that the wait would be worth it, but sadly it wasn't. The ramen was good but not 40 minute wait good. I don't like how they put bean sprouts in it and the broth was a tad bit salty for my taste. The noodles were cooked well and the slices of pork and the egg were good additions. The fried rice was good also, so was the sausage. However, after hearing all these great things about the ramen, I came away disappointed. While pretty good, it does not come close to Tsujita and it's not THAT great of a place to make people wait that long.

So these guys have been down in little tokyo doing very good ramen forever.  They've served kurobuta (berkshire pork) since before heritage breeds were a thing.  But I'd heard some talk that they had lost their luster.  Not so! The ramen was fantastic.  I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that I thought the tsukemen was even better.  Case closed. Also:  I showed up at about 5 minutes to 11 on a weekday and almost walked right in (in front of the three or four people waiting - oops!) til they pointed out to me that it hadn't opened yet.  I guess they leave the door open to keep the place cool?  Got a table the minute they opened.  No wait!

Maybe I ordered the wrong dishes but I am quite shocked at the high reviews. We went for lunch on a Friday last month. Parking was awful but after circling around a few times we got lucky and found a meter right in front of the place.  The wait was super long! Every time I've driven by there were tons of people waiting outside so I was super excited to try it. After waiting about an hour we were finally seated at the bar. I ordered the Daikokuya ramen and fried rice combo for $11.50.  Both were below average in my book. I was extremely disappointed. I wonder what everyone else is eating?!? I'm a big fan of Kouraku which is one block over. They have really good ramen and fried rice. I don't think I'll be going back.

"How can you call yourself Yelp Elite if you've never had Daikokuya!?" was being shouted at me the whole time we were walking here, waiting to be seated, after we put in our order, and while we were eating our ramen. My friends really took it hard that I never, ever had Daikokuya before. And how can I blame them? It's the best damn ramen I've ever had. With backfat. We waited a good 45 minutes to be seated and it's small, and very limited in seating. Cash only but quick service! We got our food in about 10 minutes. The salad is pretty good, just shredded cabbage and dressing but somehow it works. I love their shredded pork bowl. But their eel bowl is much much better! Now onto the ramen - it's a hearty hearty broth, especially with the added backfat, but it totally hits the spot. It's filling too. The ramen is such a perfect consistency. However, my only negative feedback is they really go cheap on the pork. Two pieces of pork. That's it. I mean, it's $10 a bowl. But yet, still the best ramen I've had.

Best Ramen broth here.  Got the special Daikokuya ramen, broth was clear, not too salty, pork belly wasn't too fatty.  Also ordered the gyoza like everyone said to.  Best Gyoza ever!  I think one of the reason why the gyoza is so good is that the wrapper is folded like a box around the filling and not crinckled like other pot stickers and I thick this prevents the outside from being so dry.  Beware if you do not like green onions because the gyoza is sprinkled with a lot of it, ask for it without if you don't like them.  Came at 2:30 and we waited for about a half hr.  I think theres always a wait because there aren't actually that many tables.  Cash only and theres a ATM in the back.

Oh my goodness the wait is ridiculous. After circling the block several times we finally found parking. Upon arrival there were already several groups of people waiting in line. We wrote down our name and party number and started waiting. They were at #26 when we wrote our name down. We ended up being number #46...we decided to walk down the block to kill time. We came back and they were still in the 20's. It took us 1.5 hours to get a table! It was ridiculous. We were all quite famish when our name was finally called for a table, we all ordered the combination ramen which included the daikoku ramen with a small side. We had the pork cutley, fried rice, salmon roe, and tempura side dishes. Once we were seated the service was quite fast, we got our food in no time. The ramen was quite delicious but i wouldn't say its utterly amazing. The broth was hearty but could have used a little bit more flavor. They also could have been more generous with the meat considering how big the bowl of ramen was. The pork cutley and fried rice was also good but I didn't find the salmon roe and the tempura to be all that special. I dont know if its just me, but when you have been waiting for 1.5 hours food and you're already starved, anything would taste amazing to you. I wonder if that's the reason why this place has such good reviews. Just a thought =] I would definitely come back again if I'm ever in LA but not if it would mean waiting more than 30 minutes for a table.

The wait is annoying but it was only a half hour when we went at an off lunch hour. We got the gyoza which was the best I've had, and then the standard ramen with the pork fat added in. I enjoyed the ramen but after my trip to LA realize more authentic leaning Japanese food is more bland than I'd prefer. A quote I read on yelp from a korean yelper was "unlike the japanese, [koreans] like flavor in their food." Applies.

On our first full day in LA, we decided to visit Little Tokyo. Finding our way to the destination was a bit difficult. We got a bit lost trying to find a restroom where we can use without having to make a purchase.  It's completely understanding for restaurants not to have a restroom open for anyone else other than patrons since there are some many homeless around. Not the most sanitary bathrooms in Downtown LA. After walking all day, I was really craving some ramen, but my boyfriend was a bit iffy because he is such a big meat eater and not a huge fan of downing a bowl full of carbs. I purposely and strategically walked by ramen places, trying to convince him that ramen would be a good choice for dinner.  Since he has never had authentic ramen, we ended up picking Daikokuya!! We were pre-warned about the long wait and were prepared to wait.  I wrote my name on the list to wait for a table.  There isn't always someone there greeting you so always remember to sign in or you'll be waiting for a table for naught!!  When we arrived, there wasn't a huge line but we still had to wait a good 20 minutes to a half hour. We missed the waitress calling out our name, but thank goodness we were still able to a table at the bar area the moment I asked if we were called.   We both ordered the Daikoku ramen and one teriyaki chicken combination which also comes with a salad for my boyfriend.  What I love about the ramen was that the egg was perfectly boiled where it is still running in the middle. So good!! All of the reman I have tried in NYC comes with boiled egg fully cooked if it even comes with one.  The broth was delicious and rich and not too salty. It comes packed with bean sprouts, scallions, bamboo shoots and a couple of slices of pork.  I was surprisingly very full after finishing up and my boyfriend was content as well.  No need to stop by at another joint to get sashimi as we had originally planned! We definitely enjoyed day at Little Tokyo, although we had a bit of a trek getting there at first.  Great walks through the streets, great shops in the shopping centers and a nice bowl or ramen at the end may it a very enjoyable day of our vacation.

Best ramen in LA? Better than anything NorCal has to offer? Many years ago perhaps. With all the new ramen houses sprouting over California, I don't think Daikokuya holds the top spot anymore. If anything, this place is busier than ever. There is always a line out the door and a wait over 45 minutes is nothing unusual. There is really only one thing to order - their Daikoku ramen. Have it kotteri style unless you are on a crazy diet (in that case you really shouldn't be eating ramen). They have tsukeman and yakisoba but I can't imagine getting those over a staple bowl of tonkotso ramen. The broth was nicely done but didn't impress me like Ippudo in NYC. It was milky, rich and complex. Everything you would expect from a reputable top tier ramen joint (in US). The noodles did not stand out. The chewiness is lacking. Shin-Sen-Gumi's has much better texture even though they were thinner hakata style. The Toppings was average. Chashu was fat enough but no where compares to the buttery ones from Santouka's. The soft boiled egg was good though. Their house made goyza is a must try side dish. I like crisped skin and juicy fillings. Sad to say but I really don't think Daikokuya was worth the long wait. Santouka serves up an overall better bowl and you could save yourself a lot of time.

They have the best gyoza! It was really good and definitely gave me a lightbulb moment of why they call them pot stickers. It was really good! The ramen, I ordered the regular one with the korretti (extra flavor, rich). I thought it was a little too rich, pretty salty from it being rich. Nonetheless, it was really good ramen, one of the better ones I tried. We had ordered 2 appetizers and ramen and they forgot to bring out our ramen for a while. However, the staff was really nice and apologetic once we let them know. It was really good, I would wait the 45 minutes again to eat it. Little Tokyo is right around the corner and across the street so we killed some time before we went back to the restaurant. I would try to regular ramen without the extra koretti.

Came back to try Gyoza again, told the waiter about the previous horrible experience, he said the chef is in and should be no problem. While the truth is the stuffing remains the same taste, but they must have changed the Gyoza skin. Daikokuya you are still my favorite ramen in LA, and this is the only store I go, since the tastes in other locations are failed to compared with.

Everyone else had hyped up this place, I figured I'd try it out on one of my lunch breaks. I got there at 11:20AM, and there were already seven groups ahead of me! The ramen was okay. It is all made fresh, but the soup is HEAVY and full of pork fat, which means I needed a food coma nap, but had to go back to work.

First timer in Los Angeles and stopped by the Japanese Village plaza and decided to stop by Daikokuya since I heard great things about it from yelp and bloggers. The wait was about an hour. I got the combo deal with the ramen and sashimi ($12-15?) and both were very good. The bowl of ramen is HUGE, so if you're small, you may want to share? I didn't finish my bowl but the ramen broth was perfect and the noodles were also good. Sadly though, I would say I've had better ramen (NYC Ippudo)

I am by no means an expert on ramen places but i don't think i need to be to know that this is some of the best food i've ever had.   The ramen special combo (i forgot the exact name) starts off with a very flavorful miso soup and a shredded salad with traditional asian style dressing.  Then comes the side, which in my case was the pork cutlet.   The pork is breaded and fried but not too greasy and served on a bed of rice along side a sunny side up egg which gets cooked as you mix it with the rice.  This little bowl of food is so good you'll think it's the whole meal till you see the ramen that comes out.   The ramen is served in a giant bowl with a soft boiled egg, pork strips and some veggies.  It's times like this i wish i was a cow with two stomachs.. Then there's what my wife got, which if you can imagine was actually the best thing i've had yet.  She got the barbeque pork bowl (once again i forgot the exact name) it sounds simple, just pork and veggies over rice but its Friggen amazing!.  the kicker is the ginger.   Its really hard to describe why this place is so good, you just have to try it.  A word of advice though is to go during off hours, i hear the place can get quite a line out the door.  also its best to park down the street at the paid lot.  and finally if for some reason you get there and it's just way way too busy there's always Mr Ramen which is just a few doors down...  not as good as Daikokuya but they are not at all bad.

My friends went here on a late Wednesday night, we had Ramen and Shredded pork rice. The ramen soup was really tasty. The line wasn't bad at 11 pm, street parking was difficult still in downtown though. The server was helpful and packed some of the left over food nicely.

I've been on a search far and wide for the best ramen in LA. I've been to Japan I've had ramen from Tokyo to Osaka. Daikokuya is good dont get me wrong but it's not worth the 2 hour wait and the dust bunnies! Yes dust bunnies everywhere all over that restaurant don't know how they have an "A" rating; but to the food. The ramen is great and is up there with some of the best ramen places I've eaten at but something is missing. The fried rice, gyoza and salad are good I love the cabbage salad the fact that its shredded to shit with this amazing sauce. The fried rice is good too lots of flavor and good all round texture. The gyoza... Nothing special but it's gyoza I read about people talking about the gyoza, but hey it's just a dumpling and I'm sure most ramen spots don't make their own gyoza, frozen style. Overall this place is great when your in around the neighborhood but I know some closer an better more flavorful ramen joints in the valley; but in LA this is one of my top ramen spots!!

I am a regular at Daikokuya. I've been here so much that I don't need to look at the menu to know what I want, and the guy taking my order already knows what I'm gonna get (gyoza, Daikoku ramen, and a coke). Gyoza: Amazing, with a generous portion of green onions on top. Gyoza sauce is DELICIOUS. One side order of gyoza comes with 5 pieces, which is good for sharing. The ramen: These are my favorite noodles, because they're curly and thick. More green onions. Add garlic sauce, chili oil (you have to ask for it), and ginger. Give the egg to my boyfriend. YUUUUUM!! The wait: It's a really small place. Unless you line up before the place opens, or stop by during a non-peak hour on a weekday, expect to wait. Just write your name down, go to Far Bar, and come back 30 minutes to an hour later, depending on how many people are in front of you. If your name got called while you were gone, they tend to be nice and give you the next available seat.

One of the best ramen I had in a while. I would place it at the top 2 on my personal list next to Monta Ramen in Vegas. My experience could have been better. The table was very sticky. Our waitress forgot about us. Maybe she was busy or we were placed in the corner of the bar. The ramen was absolutely delicious. It was very filling. Three noodles weren't too soggy or too stiff. It kinda sucks that the place is small. Nevertheless it was one of the better ramen I had. Will edit my review if I get the chance to go again

Came here twice during my socal trip last year. The ramen was definitely better than Katana-ya in SF, but still not comparable to Ippudo in NY! The wait was really, realllly long the first time I went, so by the time I started eating, I was in the stage where you're so hungry you don't even feel it anymore.. which made everything taste amazing. Second time allowed me to really savor the taste more. The ramen is decent, but what was mouth-watering delicious was their pork shredded bowl and their fried rice. So good!! We were too full to finish the two sides, since we had demolished our bowls of ramen first. Got them to go, and a few hours later, we ate them on our drive to the beach. The flavor of the green onions were really brought out with the sitting, and the shredded pork was just as delectable as when it first came out of the kitchen. I would come back here just to get the sides!

There is nothing much about this place that really stands out from other ramen places, except it has an authentic feel to it. The wait was about 45 minutes long for 2 people, but that's just how popular this place is. It would be nicer if it was more spacious and the wait was shorter, especially since when you're really hungry, 45 is forever. During the wait, though, you can always go to the shopping center right across the street. When I was here, I typically just had the bowl of ramen. I really enjoyed it, but then again, I always enjoy ramen that isn't the one in the styrofoam cup.

I came to Daikokuya with a friend this past Wednesday and was really dreading the long lines. However, I thought to myself, if we came early enough, there would not be as long of a line and sure enough, that logic paid off. We did notice there was a good line formed outside the restaurant even before it opened at 11am. I was so happy that we were seated immediately upon arriving at the restaurant. The parking situation is still rather chaotic around the restaurant. The parking meters adjacent to the restaurant are $3 an hour. The Little Tokyo Metro Station is also close by for those of you who partake in public transportation. Anyhow, I would recommend getting a combination, particularly the Daikokuya ramen and a little bowl of fried rice. With the combination, it comes with a free salad too. The fried rice was excellent. It was really interesting that when I received my bowl of ramen that the broth was lukewarm again and the noodles were piping hot. Perhaps their logic is that the hot ramen will warm up the broth. Anyhow, regardless, the ramen was very delicious. When I come back here again, I will specifically ask them to make the broth warmer since the past couple of times, it was only lukewarm.

Damn good fried rice and gyoza! I love oyako donburi (chicken& egg bowl)because my favorite auntie used to make it for me as a child. Because of that reason, I am super picky. And it is really yummy here. I asked for extra sauce and it was no problem. Yum! I would come back for each of these but not if I was starving because of the long line. I didn't care for my ramen very much but I have to admit that I am ruined for ramen because I eat at Ramen Yamadaya so much that no other ramen does it for me anymore.  My brother thought it was really good but he got the Kotteri ramen and I got the house ramen, My hubby got the chicken teri bowl and really enjoyed it. Damn good fried rice! I know I already said it but it was so, good. I want it again now.

I think this place is over hyped. Although, not according to most of my friends on yelp and most people who review this place. So my review might not be indicative of what many have echoed.  The wait is ridiculously long.  So for me, being so impatient when it comes to waiting for food, (especially so used to waiting for other noodle joints that have barely any wait if a wait at all)...waiting for about 2 hours in the cold was pretty excruciating. I would not have volunteered to come here, but my friends told us that it was the best ramen ever. So I had high expectations, (then again, you must make sure your friends have the same palate as you do, and in this case I was misled as our taste buds do not coincide). I shared a combo, and it's enough for two.  All I can say is when I looked at my bowl of ramen, first thing I thought was is this a dare to see who gets a heart attack?  The ramen was drowned in fatty soaking cholesterol clogging broth. I wasn't sure if I should have spooned off the fat or not. Mindless to say, I tried to eat the noodles and avoided the broth, even though it was pretty flavorful. I like to eat healthy, and I am not a health nut by any means, but I would not be coming back.

I wish I could give this place 5 stars because it's tasty as hell! I normally get the fried rice (I'll intentionally order more, so I can pack it up and take it home after), but the ramen's pretty good too. There's no take-out, which is a bummer. I'd order take-out all the time if it was available. Why isn't there take-out, Daikokuya?? :( Parking also stinks. There's very limited street parking (metered until 8 pm, I think). There's a lot nearby that has a $4 flat rate fee. We try to find street parking when we can to avoid paying $4. The wait here can get a bit ridiculous. I've waited upwards of 2 hours during dinner rush hour...my stomach practically ate itself at that point. I blame this on the fact that this is a tiny establishment. They should seriously think about buying out the crappy restaurants in Little Tokyo and expanding their business. Owners, if you're reading this, PLEASEEEE expand! I, along with many, many others, don't like waiting hours for your yummy food. :(

I was a bit hesitant to try Daikokuya, just because when over 3,000 people say something good, it sometimes turns out to be all hype, and no good eats. Daikokuya, you are not about the hype. There is something crazy cool about walking into Daikokuya from the bustling (full of drunks on a Saturday night) streets of Little Tokyo.. It's like being taken into a whole different world. Once the door closes behind you, you see that you're in a very small, very authentic, very very humble establishment. And the smell. The place is FILLED with the smell of delicious pork broth. I think I was won over the moment I stepped into the restaurant. Now the ramen: There is not a bad thing to be said about this ramen. I ordered "kotteri" style-- which means the broth is even fattier and richer than in the original. The ramen portions are HUGE- I'm the kind of girl that perseveres through a meal and usually slurps up every last bit of the bowl, but Daikokuya doesn't skimp out on a thing. If you're on a lighter diet, I'd advise ordering the half portion. The portioning of meat, bean sprouts, bamboo, green onion, noodles, and egg were perfect. I didn't have to worry about rationing out my meat like some ramen places. Daikokuya gets you fed. I could go on & on... But my fave parts of the Daikokuya ramen are probably the soft-boil egg & the bean sprouts. In the dozens of ramen places that I've been, Daikokuya is the only one I've ever seen use bean sprouts.. And it works. The light crunch of the sprouts contrasts perfectly with the chewiness of the noodles. Love it. The egg was perfectly cooked. Cut into half, the yolk was still slightly soft and made the ramen even creamier. AHH. Delicious. Unagi don (eel bowl) - nothing bad 'bout this either. The eel is tender and bbq-y sweet, meshed with the perfect round grain Japanese rice. Beautiful combo. Side salad - Like the typical salad you get from many Japanese restaurants, but even this... Brought up onto another level. The cabbage is sliced micro-thin, and the dressing is creamy and tangy on a very refreshing level. NOTES: *Expect a 30-60 minute wait on weekend nights. Don't be intimidated by the waiting list. It goes by quickly & you can walk around outside to kill time. *Ramen noodles are egg based. Similar to Santouka, and the oppositie of Shin Sem Gumi. *CASH ONLY! Okay okay, enough reading, get to eating!! COME TO DAIKOKUYA.

After reading the reviews about this establishment I decided to try it because many users were raving about it. The wait was about 20 minutes which wasn't to bad. There wasn't many options to choose for Ramen. I believe they only had 2. I had the "special". My thoughts for that evening, the Ramen was good but the broth was too salty for my taste buds. The establishment wasn't very clean in side. It was also hot and crowded.

This is my favorite ramen place in Little Tokyo, if not in all of Los Angeles.  I usually order Daikoku Ramen (usually a 1/2 order unless I'm hungry).  Most often than not, there will be a wait and if you want to minimize your wait time it's best to come with no more than two people. The Daikoku Ramen is delicious.  It's good for lunch or dinner (and it would probably be just as good for breakfast).  The broth is the star for me of this place.  It's salty and hearty and I wish I could drink it if it wasn't so sodium laden (probably not the best place for those watching their sodium intake).  I also love the soft boiled egg that comes with the ramen with the perfectly soft golden yolk. For those that need just more than ramen, the gyoza is pretty decent (but oily and come in an unusual rectangular shape) and the fried rice is also delicious as well. Remember it's polite to slurp your noodles!

The wait was not pleasant - 45 minutes around 2:30pm on Friday - but I knew it beforehand.  So far the only thing that stopped me from going here was the unbearable looking line, so when we saw a crowd that was significantly smaller than usual, we decided to try the food even though we were not hungry. Decided to share a bowl of Dailoku ramen with a small bowl of pork cutlet. The pork and egg in ramen were definitely worth the wait. The broth was good also, the noodles tasted fresh.  The pork cutlet was a bit salty for my taste buds but that's almost always the case for me when I eat out, it was still good.

I went to this restaurant recently to satisfy my craving for some Japanese ramen. Unfortunately, Daikokuya didn't turn out to be the 5 star ramen experience that I thought I would get. I was lucky enough to bypass any sort of wait when I ate at this restaurant. The soup is ridiculously fatty and I mean that in the best way possible. The portions are enormous and it is easy to get full from one bowl without any extra noodles or pork. My only problem was with the noodles. Having tried a multitude of other ramen restaurants, I just didn't think that the noodle texture as up to par with so many other restaurants and because of this, I can only rate Daikokuya 3 stars. I need to mention this again. The soup is ridiculously fatty and flavorful. Without a doubt, the best soup base I have ever had with ramen. Unfortunately, the noodles didn't match up with the rich soup.

Their huge ramen bowl is nice, but not the best I've had. Their gyoza is very good, but comes steep at $6. I liked Daikokuya, but I don't think I'd line up for another hour to eat there again. Much of the crowd forms probably because of the buzz from 3000+ Yelpers raving, best ramen ever. But I am convinced that if Ippudo opened a store in SoCal, many would have a change of heart. Daikokuya is a good place for ramen if you're in the area. Their Showa-era decor is very cool, and seeing the cooks at work at the counter is a fun throwback. Still, fans of tonkotsu ramen concur that Santoka is way up there, and you can get that everywhere in LA/OC without circling the block for street parking or waiting outside.

Only been here many times, but actually eating here? Once. Why? Because the wait is ridiculous. It kind of a chore to get to, parking isnt exactly easy to find. Sometimes I wonder why people keep coming back. Don't get me wrong, I love daikokuya's ramen, but its not worth going through all that to get! The MPK locations suits me better. It doesn't taste any different from the original. The service isn't anything to rave about. I get what I want with less effort. And that makes me happy. I had expected a 30min + waiting time. So I quickly looked up a nearby bar to get my drink on(with my yelp app of course!). Found one right across the street. Had a beer and watched some people act a fool with karaoke, I took care of the tab and started to head back to the restaurant. And as expected we came back with 1 name before us. I was amazed at how perfectly everything was timed. Got seated, ordered the ramen with the unagi/roasted ell bowl. And a side of tuna sashimi. The ramen was good as expected. The unagi was spot on. And the tuna was fresh. I did enjoy my meal. Came about to be about $30ish. Not sure if I would come back though. The service at the arcadia location is like 10 times faster than this location, because you dont have to wait to be seated. The MPK location is usually better for the 626 locals for myself who want the more authentic dining experience. And its less crowded than the Little Tokyo location. Unless I was dying to have ramen and was stuck in LT, I wouldnt come to this location.

BEST JAPANESE RAMEN HANDS DOWN. PERIOD. END OF STORY. No one can make the broth the way THIS location makes it. The noodles are always cooked to perfection-- a heaping mound of green onion and the red ginger and you are good to go. Now you can see there are 3000+ reviews. Yes, it is that good, but 1hr wait every freaking day? I don't think so. I usually poke my head in when I'm in the area to see how long the wait is, but honestly I've gotten sick of having to wait hours for a bowl of ramen. Alas, sometimes I get lucky, sometimes I don't, but they will be there forever (or it seems like it anyways) so I'll be ok. ---- Parking: Meters are crazy expensive in this area (Little Tokyo/Downtown). Best deal for parking is on Judge John Aiso street aka San Pedro (I'm not sure why the street name changes at the 1st St. intersection). There is a new parking lot/structure for a very reasonable price. $1 for the first two hours and $3 after that. Flat rate of $3 after 5pm. A much better deal than that sketchy lot across the street.

The hubs was tired and grumpy but after he ate, he was so happy! I don't get to eat ramen like this often, but I think this place is awesome. I wish they had one where I live.

My first time at daikokya was a great experience. I think ramen will always be the same at every ramen restaurant. Apparently, everyone in town loves this place so much. They had decent prices on their ramen. Not bad at all. But the line was that killed it. I wish they had a bigger place. I think they would go great! Nothing can go wrong with their ramen soup. I really enjoyed it. Stay in line, it is actually worth the wait. And hey! You're at lil tokyo. Make it more tradition while your there.

The line was so long. I thought it was going to be in and out. The seating is limited and the owner/management knows about it. They acknowledge and apologize for it in their menu. Hey, if it keeps the ramen this good, I'll take it. Had the Daikoku ramen which as so warm and filling and totally hits the spot and was soooo good on a rainy day. It was seasoned just right (for saltiness). I just had to add a little white pepper to clear the sinuses, you know? The infamous garlic sauce was good; not as spicy as I expected it to be. I thought it was pure ground/blended fresh garlic, but I think not. Hmmm... Cash Only people. Love the pop art on display!

Totally overrated and not worth the trouble. I've been here (and the Monterey Park location) a few times, and I seem to be disappointed every time. Perhaps, this is due to all the hype, but it never seems to live up to my very high expectations. In fact,I prefer the Monterey Park location to the Original since that one is never as crowded! I've had the Tonkatsu and the Kotteri Ramen. The broth is good, but not nearly as AMAZING as everyone said it would be. The hard boiled egg that comes with your ramen is amazing. I'm also a huge fan of the braised pork belly rice. It's really delicious (much better than the Ramen, in my opinion!) However, I do feel that everyone should try this place at least once. It is such a landmark in the LA food scene. Just be prepared to wait. I've never waited less than an hour for a seat.  You can get great ramen at Santouka and Shin sen gumi without having to wait forever to be seated. TIP: Go across the street and wait in the lobby of the hotel :)

Daikokuya makes me wish NorCal was blessed with great ramen places such as this! The spicy ramen from here definitely lives up to its hype.. The broth is just right, the noodles are yummy and made to your own likings, and the EGG... Oh my, the egg is amazing! All of this makes for one heck of soup! It's definitely oily but that's where all the flavors at so I can't complain. The wait can be long as this is a small hole-in-the-wall but they turn over people fairly quickly.. Worth it!

Ramen was awesome. I had over 100 different types of Ramen in the States and Japan, and this place is definitely worth coming. However, I waited for 1.5 hours to get in, and since I can go to Santouka or Jidaiya with no wait, I wouldn't come again. Ramen price is normal, but the combos are overpriced. Come try it if you must, but there are similar qualities with less wait.

We have been to the Monterey Park location several times, this is our first time at the Little Tokyo location. I have to say, that I enjoy ramen, however not the wait. I am still up in the air on whether it is worth the wait or not.   We both had the Tsukemen Ramen. This is where they serve everything separate. The broth is hot while the noodles, green onions, sprouts and cha shu are cool. A good idea for hot weather. The service was good, no complaints. The food was good, no complaints I guess my only complaints were, on a hot day, this location is lacking in air conditioning. Or it may have been the filled booths and counter, plus all the hot ramen being served. AND the wait time (which wasn't too bad, however not sure if I want to wait for a bowl of ramen). Will I go back? Maybe.

4 stars for (1) fried rice (came with miso soup) and (2) shredded pork bowl (came with miso soup and salad)! The rice dishes were really great (definitely lived up to Daikokuya's reputation) - well-defined grains of rice, fragrant and tasty! The shredded pork had a crispy skin - immensely comforting to the soul. Ramen was a big downer! I was so excited to indulge in it - but it tasted really average (maybe slightly better than ramen out of the packet). So 3 stars. Wait was around 30min at 10:30pm on a Thursday.

I'm probably going to get torched for this but the ramen, while good, is nothing to really write home about. I've had better ramen in Tokyo, but that's probably a moot point since we're not in Japan. It's also slightly disappointing that there is only one choice of ramen --no shio, miso, shoyu, or even the option to have extra vegetables kind of induces feelings of "meh." The fact that I felt way sodium'd out afterwards with the side effect of major bloating lasting until the next day doesn't help either. This location is way better than the Arcadia one, however, and it definitely fixes a ramen craving.

The only bad thing about this place is the 1.5 hour wait. No matter what time you go, you have to at least wait 1.5 hours. I would just walk around jtown and kill some time before heading back to see if they called your number. The food is yummy. I usually get the regular ramen + fried rice. I would only recommend getting that if you are really hungry because the portions are ginormous.

Went here with my friend after picking her up from the union station. We went there around noon and we only need to wait for around 10-20minutes(I just visit the mochi shop and anime shop besides daikokuya :p). I don't recommend you to come in a big group cuz the place is really small. I ordered the ramen with the fried rice. It is so delicious especially if you eat the fried rice with the ramen soup.. OHH that's heavennnnn haha.. The soup is really fatty but that what makes it so good haha..

For my 100th Yelp review, I will add my useless review to Daikokuya's collection of well over 3000 reviews. What more can I possibly say about this amazing ramen/restaurant that has not already been said? I can confidently say that I've taken more boys on dates to Daikokuya than to any other restaurant. They have all been impressed by the ramen and by my awesome taste buds. Now, I'm not going to go into too much details on how these dates went, other than that 2 of those dates were also the last ones and one date is currently on limbo status. My conclusion is that Daikokuya should be reserved for the 3rd or latter dates; it's way too intense early on in a relationship, and let's face it - boys are intimidated by girls with good taste in food.

My second time trying Daikokuya, and I must say I am a fan. The worst part about this place is the wait, but you know what they say, if there is a line, it must be good! lol GF and I got the ramen, I ordered a combo with their Ribeye steak bowl. The ramen was as good as I remembered, rich flavorful broth and great perfect noodles. The broth was warm and just so comforting on a cold night. The steak however, was horrible, bland and just meager. I would recommend anyone getting a combo to steer clear from getting the steak, get the fried rice instead, you will be much happier. Remember that its cash only, they do have an ATM on site if you forget, also, get there a minimum of 30 minutes before you want to eat, the wait is long and waiting area inside is non existent IMHO.

Came here through Urbanspoon recommendation.  We sat at the bar with exactly enough surface area for our orders.  The side dishes and appetizers we ordered were good but nothing special; I could find the same appetizers and side dishes at many other restaurants for equal or better price/quality.  But the ramen.  The ramen was the perfect end to the wait.  What a shame that I filled up on appetizers and side dishes, then could not finish my ramen or even take it to go...  I would come back here only for the ramen (not that there's anything wrong with that). Prepare to wait-- grab a snack nearby or plan to kill some time at MOCA/shopping.

Best ramen in LA. The only qualm I have is the 20-30 minute wait for this place. Otherwise the portions are big, noodles are the perfect hardness, broth is great, meat is delicious, comes with tons of green onions and a soft boiled egg. My friend raves about the fatty pork bowl they also serve for combo orders. The wait isn't so bad since you are in the middle of Little Tokyo. I usually just sign the waiting list and walk around the cute stores and go to the mochi store. By the time I return to the store, I'm the next in line for a table/bar seat. Parking in Little Tokyo is pretty difficult though as well. There is no parking lot for Daikokuya. So you might have to circle around a bit. Definitely a place to go for ramen addicts though :) It's open till 2am too if I'm not mistaken, CASH ONLY!

BEST RAMEN EVER! Nice staff, fast service, lines can get long but it moves quickly. BEST ITEMS ON THE MENU: - Daikoku Ramen - SHREDDED PORK BOWL YUM - Fried Rice - Free side salad is also so good - Gyoza You can't go wrong with any of these! I got to Daikokuya at least once a week. It's my favorite restaurant :)

The ramen broth is sOOOOOO good here. Not salty which is def. a plus in my book. I've been to too many ramen houses with just saltwater as their broth sick.The wait was long but It was worth it. This little place is packed. Service is quick and the servers friendly. I had the combo with Daiko ramen and sashmi &i rice. I just picked at the sashimi towards the end of the dinner.Apparentlyt my eyes were bigger than my stomach when I ordered. the bowels that the ramen is served in are HUGE. I'll probably stop by again.. this location was ranked in the top ten restaurants for  2011 according to YELP. Another Check!

There was a wait of about 30 minutes to get seated with 4 parties ahead of me at 9:30pm on a Monday.     The ramen menu is simple.  There's Tonkatsu ramen or the cold noodle ramen.  They come in small, medium, or large sized bowls.   I got the medium sized Kotteri Tonkatsu ramen for about $8.  The broth was very very fatty, as advertised.  The broth was delicious, but was missing something flavor-wise.  The pork melted in my mouth, but there were too few pieces provided.  This is the first time where a ramen restaurant served their par-boiled egg whole.   Interior of restaurant is adorned with various Japanese decorations which made me feel as if I had stepped into from L.A. to Japan.  It's a pretty small restaurant, with no ventilation so it was stuffy and hot.   Cash only and no to-go orders. I'd say Daikokuya would be my favorite ramen spot if Santouka is closed.

Okay came here one random hot Sunday. Little Tokyo was packed! Didn't want to pay for parking so I had to drive around for a long time to find a spot. I eventually found it far far away and had to walk in the sun for 10 min. Hope you're luckier than I. This Daikokuya is MUCH bigger than the one in Monterey Park. They food is just as good. I like to get the combo here but its alot of food. for $11 you get a bowl of ramen and a small bowl of something else that you can choose from a list. I personally like the shredded pork, it tastes like unagi! This time we decided to try the dipping noodles. Though it would be a fun experience and might taste better. I did not like them at all and will not be ordering them again. You get the soup in a bowl and the ingredients come in a separate plate. I did not know what I was doing but my soup got cold very fast since the noodles are cold. Then the whole thing just didn't taste that good. Stick to the regular ramen combos and you're golden =)

OVERALL RATING = 10 / 10 The EATS:     Daikoku ramen = 10     Tempura bowl (small) = 7 The DRINKS:     Chilled Sake = 7     Kirin (Pitcher) = 5     ATMOSPHERE = 8 SERVICE = 7 APPEAL = 10 If you've never been here, and love ramen, the question to ask yourself is: Is this place better than Shin Sen Gumi? I believe both are the most hyped ramen houses in LA. I love ramen and have never visited DKA till now. DKA wins the broth department, but only by a margin. Even though you get to customize the broth at SSG, DKA seems to have a better base for the broth. Or maybe it's a completely different broth and I just happen to prefer DKA more? I dunno. DKA wins the pork slices as well. Maybe that has something to do with the broth being a bit better. Something about that broth.. gets me craving it more. SSG wins all other aspects of the ramen: each of the toppings and, what may be the most important, the noodles. It's probably because you can customize all of it. But again, all of these are marginal differences and both are worthy of your time (long wait times) and your money. Nothing like a hot, steaming bowl of ramen on a cold, winter night!

Last night, CP and I were laying in bed, snuggling and approaching slumber when he whispered, "Can we go back to Daikokuya this weekend?" And he was serious. I have a feeling that just one week after our first trip we will be back at that counter again. We got there around noon and there wasn't too long of a wait. Signed in, ten people ahead of us, and went for a walk. I bought a big Totoro at a nearby shop. We waited for about thirty minutes. Totally reasonable. Next time we'll aim for 11am (opening time) and try to completely skip the wait. Once we were seated we were given waters. The staff was efficient, not overly friendly, but it was packed so I'm not too worried about it. We placed our orders for two ramens (I got kotteri style; CP did not) with the combination (I got teriyaki eel; CP got teriyaki chicken). Let's be clear right here before I go any further. This is too much food. Just too damn much. We both had TONS of leftovers. So either you must have an enormous stomach or maybe share or something. Next time I'm for sure skipping the combo. Our food was out in under ten minutes. And once I had that steaming hot bowl of ramen in my face I knew I was going to reach my happy place. I don't think the kotteri style broth is necessary. It definitely tastes porkier but it's not so much better that it's worth the extra fat added. I can go for the regular broth next time. But gah, the broth is amazing. It's thick and brilliant. I could just drink it all day in place of water (this is a lie). The noodles, the pork, the egg. It was all combining to have a wholly ethereal experience. I'm not trying to sound crazy here but seriously, total foodgasm. Thanks to Fia R. for strongly recommending the eel. It was so good and thick and perfect. Very well prepared. I ate more of that than my stomach could handle. CP, an eel virgin, even enjoyed it. I like that Daikokuya isn't just resting on their ramen. While I'm not as into ramen as CP, I can totally see this place making me a crazed noodle eater. This was well worth the drive, the wait and the money. See you on Saturday?

I was craving Japanese ramen.  I have been here before.  But sad  to say will not come back again.  I got food poisoning from here.  Not sure if it was the broth or the extra pork.  An hour later after I got sick.  Still sick, but at least not running to the bathroom like last night.  Sad to let this place go.

Had to loosen my belt a notch because of all the noodle I ate! Determined to try this spot we waited about 30 mins to get seated. It was during a weekday lunch rush, dumb rookies... Get there by 11:30 am or after 1:20 pm on a weekday (not sure about weekends). Place is small so seating is highly limited. Doesn't look like much from the outside or inside for that matter but food is truly delicious. Tuna Sashimi - 5 stars Very fresh and delicious. They didn't have sushi ginger the only thing close to it was the kind at Yoshinoya. Daikokuya Noodles - 5 stars Broth flavorful and rich but not too salty, pork was super tender and melt in yo mouth! Noodles were perfectly al dente and pretty thick. My gf and I regretted not sharing a bowl because by the time we got back to the office our happy buddah bellies were hanging out loud and proud. Parking - 1 star $8 across the street at a tiny lot unless you get lucky and find a meter which is almost impossible during lunch time. (12 pm - 1 pm) This will probably become our 2x's month treat. Remember people, noodles EXPAND IN YO BELLY!

I believe we came here in the middle of the day on a Friday and couple months ago, no waiting, sat at the bar.  Quick service, nothing special.  The boyfriend and I both ordered ramen.  I much prefer the broth here, but I like the noodles at Shinsengumi better.  Overall, it was delicious, and was way too much for me to finish.  I would go back if it wasn't busy like this last time I went.

I've heard about this place for a long time and my friends rave about it. I'm not one for waiting a long time for a table, but I finally gave in and did the obligatory 30 minute wait. I did the ramen noodles. It was a lot of food and it was mighty tasty. Actually though, I ordered some friend rice for an appetizer that I liked even better than the ramen! It was a lot of food. I took the rest of my ramen home against the advice of my friend. I guess the noodles tend to absorb the broth and they get super puffy. Well...mine were just fine. They actually tasted better several hours later than they did in the restaurant. So, if you go there and can't finish, definitely take it with you and eat it a few hours later. Don't wait too long though. You don't want to end up with a bunch of puffy noodles! Oh yah, this place is cash only. Be sure and hit the ATM before you go there.

I guess my coworker and I were lucky. We had a conference at the Fed Building and they let us out before 1200pm for lunch. We stepped in 15 mins before 1200pm and were sat right away. Boy did it get wayyyy lunch busy right after we sat down (so lucky). I've been to Daikokuya a few times even before the place was really hyped up. Food is served up fast (good for table turnaround time), the staff are friendly and there's not a million items to order in your ramen. Pork/shoyu ramen combo with fried rice or just the ramen will hit the spot for you. The ramen is flavorful, noodles are sticky and gummy like, and the broth is awesome. Now I wish the crowds weren't super crazy! I guess you can't go wrong with 3,000+ reviews!

Okay... the wait. I'll get that out of the way and say that yes, Daikokuya has some ridiculously long waits. I've tried eating here about four times before and each time was met with a big crowd outside their door that had me walking over next door to Mr. Ramen or some other dining option in the area. Well, I guess the fifth time's the charm as I was able to walk right in for some counter seating on a weekday at 2:30 in the afternoon. To sum it up, ramen at Daikokuya was a satisfying experience. Their noodles were cooked to an appropriate firmness, the pork was tender, and the cool soy sauce egg with a barely cooked yolk provided a nice counterpoint to the steaming, rich, and flavorful broth that was good to the last drop. My bowl was enough to leave me feeling pretty full. Combination meals with beef bowls and a salad are also available on the menu, but those seem like they'd best be reserved for sharing or for your hungriest moments. The restaurant is smallish and the vibe diner-like. The service was efficient, polite, and responsive. It's definitely not a place you feel like lingering for long with the constant stream of customers eyeing your seat or table as you finish your meal. Daikokuya is worth going back to. I just hope it won't take me another five tries.

Daikokuya was the first ramen restaurant that I went to in the US. I remembered the first time I tried was junior year of high school, during lunch break on a field trip to the MOCA nearby and my second time was a few years later with my friends at 11pm. The two visits were very different. I was a not aware of Daikokuya famous ramen during my first visit since ramen looked exactly like instant noodle to me back then. Don't judge, I know I was that ignorant. As a result, I ordered a rice bowl and it tasted delicious. A few years later, second year in college, my friends raved about this place and we decided to go at 11pm. Parking was insane, even at 11pm. What was even more horrible was the wait at this dark hour? 45 minutes for a party of 5? I was a little surprised. For me, the ramen itself was not special, but the broth was very creamy and rich in flavors and the meat was super tender.

I finally found one of the best ramen places in Los Angeles.  It took me a couple of years, but I finally found it. Daikokuya is a small hole in the wall restaurant that you can easily miss if you were not looking for it.  However, the obvious line of customers waiting outside is a good giveaway.   Since I brought up the line, you will have to wait unless you arrive early or when they open.  I waited at least 45 minutes to get seated.  Normally, I do not like waiting and would have suggested eating at another place in Little Tokyo.  However, Daikokuya had extremely good reviews that I had to find out for myself what made it so good. Finally entering the little restaurant, my friend and I were seated at the bar.  Sitting at the bar is another thing that do not enjoy, but for the sake of trying Daikokuya, I'm taking one for the team.   The service is fast.  We ordered, we ate, and we left.  With a large waiting audience outside that continues to grow by the minute, they  need to be fast. We ordered gyoza and tsukemono as our appetizers and both order the grilled pork ramen (their staple).   The gyoza is delicious.  It is deep fried so that when it is served, it looks like a pile of brown dumplings stuck together.  It didn't look that appealing at first, but after eating it is pure heaven. As for the ramen, I found it to be okay.  The broth was good and the grilled pork was a good combination to the vegetables inside.  However, it was the noodles that made it sooooooooooooooo delicious.  I haven't had noodles that tasted this good in a long time.  LONG TIME!  It reminded me of Hamura Saimin noodles on Kauai, Hawaii.  If you are from Hawaii, you know what I am talking about.   I am definitely going to come back since they have tonkatsu on their menu.  And I am a tonkatsu snob.

Meh... If you want to drink a bowl of pork fat, then I guess Daikokuya is the place for you. In fact, get the kotteri (cloudy and rich) ramen where it's literally a bowl of ramen with chunks of fucking fat floating around. If you want a sure fire way of dying after a meal then order Daikokuya's kotteri ramen because you are guaranteed a heart attack from this dish because fat is fat no matter what you call it. I mean kurobuta and black pork sounds great, but at the end of the day you are eating pig fat soup. When it comes to Japanese ramen, I guess I'm more of an assari (light and clear) enthusiast, which explains why I have an affinity for plain shio (salt) ramen and shoyu (soy sauce) ramen because I prefer ramen broth that isn't so damn dense. In fact, even when cooking ramen at home I forbid anyone from adding eggs to my broth because I like my shit clean and pure...  like me. I mean you are what you eat, right? RIGHT! But seriously, what disappoints about Daikokuya is that they only offer one type of ramen: pork fat ramen or uber pork fat ramen. And sadly, I'm just not a fan like all the other 3,000 bandwagon followers. And guess what? Because Daikokuya is in the tourist trap of a place we call Little Tokyo (where Japanese people do not even live because the real Japantown is in the South Bay), you will have to wait a fucking long ass time to eat overrated food. Other Food Options Besides their fatty ramen, Daikokuya offers rice bowls with tonkatsu (deep-fried pork cutlet) or tuna sashimi, fried rice, and other side dishes like a weird salad. Tonkatsu - Average and not spectacular Tuna Sashimi - Don't fucking order sashimi from a non-sushi restaurant Fried Rice - The best thing I had at Daikokuya Weird Salad - Let's just say that I did not appreciate the mayonnaise/pink slime dressing ----------------------------- So, if you really want to try delicious umami Japanese ramen, then you must check out Santouka inside the Mitsuwa Market in Torrance (aka Big Tokyo). *BTW, Yelp, are you fucking serious? How is Daikokuya a 2011 top ten US Yelp Restaurant? SMH... Un-fucking-believable...

Visiting Tokyo town since we had time to kill on a sunny Monday afternoon. We came across this restaurant via yelped. My lady is a foodie, and she loves to try different ramen noodles place. We saw that this place had plenty reviews and we thought why not lets give it a shot. Be aware, the wait is very, very long. Perhaps at least a 30 minute wait. It is a very small noodle house, but I guarantee you it is worth the wait. The noodle was a good portion for what it consisted of. Egg noodle, large boiled egg,  and yummy, tasty soup base. Also came with just enough of pork. I got a small bowl of chicken teriyaki, and boy was it good. The chicken was fresh, and the way it was prepared was delicious. I love the fast service. They get you in and out. I definitely recommend this place if you are craving for ramen noodle.

CASH ONLY NOW!  I know they definitely used to take CC's but not anymore. I think everything has been said about this place.  Be prepared to wait when coming here so don't come when you're already hungry!  Service here is really good and they are very quick serving you.  They have 2 kinds of ramen, the typical ramen with soup and noodles in the same bowl and the kind where you dip your noodles.  Combo's are available and it is a lot of food. Recommended: Kotteri style - adds a nice extra layer of flavor to your soup but also adds to your already expanding waist line. Egg and chicken bowl combo - the eggs are always cooked medium so the eggs aren't too dry and the chicken has good taste too. Shredded Pork combo - another good dish except the pork is fatty. Ramen and dumping tons of garlic and red pepper in the soup. Decent: Ramen where you dip the noodles - the pork is seared before you get it and so it has more flavor than the typical boiled cha siu pork.  The soup is too salty to drink and leaves you horribly thirsty.

Im a big ramen fan so whenever I see a place I usually try it out.  Always noticed this place with huge lines and all the raves in the Yelp reviews so it was on my top of my to try list.   So one day I decided to go. Place is like some dive hole in the wall restaurant.  But they kept it pretty clean.  Got in and felt like I was back in Japan at a ramen place there.   Ordered their signature pork soup ramen and bowl of fried rice.  Combo set I ordered came to around $13 bucks.   The food was good.  But I don't think its that good that I would wait 30-60 mins that most people seem to do to eat here.  Seems crazy for just ok food. Theres no parking other then street.  So thats an addtional cost to your meal you will need to consider.

Hum. I swear out of the numerous times that I've been here, that I would have already written a review. Daikokuya is simply put, awesome. Granted you can sit through the long waits that this place tends to have, you'll be treated to an awesome bowl of ramen, and if you please, a nice side of pork rice too. Dailokuya has been here since like forever. The place is super old school, and has probably been here since the beginning of time itself. There's not much seating to wait inside, so you're most likely going to be waiting outside. Seating inside seats roughly around 30-40 people, split between tables and the bar. Once you get a seat though, the service is pretty fast. Obviously you're coming here for the ramen, but every single time, I have the thought that I can finish a bowl of ramen, plus a bowl of minced pork rice. From the dozen or so times that I've been here, I still have yet to learn from this. The portions are pretty hefty. Out of all the other ramen joints that I've been around SoCal, I'd say that the only other place that I'd put on the same pedestal as Shin Sen Gumi. So what's so good about Daikokuya? Well, the broth is pretty damn tasty. I usually order the Daikoku ramen which comes with an egg, menma, green onions, and of course some pork. As a side, I recommend the shredded pork bowl or their fried rice. Both are amazingly good, so they're worth a try. If you do come with a party, then tops in some gyoza, because that's always a must when eating ramen. I love me some ramen, and I always come out of Daikokuya satisfied. Make sure to arrive early, and you'll be left without an hour long wait. Sadly, they don't validate parking so you're on your own in that department.

Flavorful broth with depth and complexity.  Not greasy but definitely rich and does feels heavy if that makes sense.  Like, put you in a food coma heavy.  Noodles taste and look handmade not like they came from a factory.  Flavored egg cooked perfectly with the yolk still orange and slightly runny.  The best ramen in the greater Los Angeles Area.  Get the shredded pork bowl on the side too.  It's melt-in-your mouth amazing.

i'm in love with this ramen. i have to admit, i don't know what the rest of their menu tastes like, but the ramen, yummmm! i like to order the tsukemen, i think there is more flavor in this one than in the daikokuya ramen. all 4 stars are for the ramen itself. the wait is as bad as you have heard. the place isn't much for ambience. and the waiters are average. that said, it is still somewhere i have to get my ramen fix from.

The Ramen comes with noddles that are cooked perfectly, about four bacon-like slices of soft pork belly, and a boiled egg that is custard-y taste and texture in the yolk. The fried rice kicks ass!! Very good with the caramelized egg and seasoning; the best tasting fried rice I have ever had!! This place is small, dive-y, but clean and with the Japanese ad signs on the wall; it really adds a sense of  savor to the already great experience. Can't wait to get back here!!

First of all... 3200 reviews? After seeing the yelp reviews and hearing repeatedly about backfat broth from my bf, I knew I had to come here. I arrived with some friends at around 6pm on a Sunday evening. We didn't have to wait long--maybe about 15 min--before we were seated. This place in Little Tokyo is small, packed, and cozy. I was super impressed that each bowl of tsukemen was only $8! I had the backfat broth (of course). The flavors were delicious, perfectly salty, and the backfat added the right amount of comfort. (Note: it will congeal -- keep mixing.) The meat melted like butter in my mouth. At the end, I just wanted to keep eating and enjoy my company, but I was stuffed and had to pass along part of my meal to the guys at the table. It was definitely the better tsukemen experience I had in LA when I visited. YUM.

So I finally got to go to this Ramen place in Little Tokyo. The line wasn't too bad for a table for 2 on a weekday night. We ended up waiting 20-30 minutes. I guess I should be pretty happy since I've been told the lines are really long on the weekends. We both ended up getting the main ramen item that was listed in the menu. I would say that the amount given to us was pretty worth the price. The bowl was large and was filled with lots of ramen noodles and soup. The amount of meat though didn't seem to be adequate though; a little on the low side. Overall though, just like everyone else says, this place is good and it reminds me of real Japanese ramen from Japan. If the line isn't too long, check it out!

I love ramen. I have my one favorite spot that I frequent (also in Little Tokyo) so when my friends told me we would be going to this place, I was skeptical. After eating here though, I am a believer and fan. This place takes ramen to whole new level. As my good friend said "If I die of a premature heart attack, I hope I'm eating this." The food is incredible! Looks great, smells great, and tastes great! I order the Daikoku Ramen, Kotteri Style. You can't go wrong. The noodles are phenomenal! The soup/broth is so rich and flavorful! The pork melts in your mouth and the egg is a perfectly soft boiled egg that is amazing! They have a variety of spices you can add to it, but you really don't have to. The only drawback is that you have to wait a while (I've heard in the upwards of two hours on some occasions) but trust me, it is worth the wait! Daikokuya, you've won me over and I will be back!

Went here the other day on a cold day. Still a wait but we didn't mind.  All the staff take their jobs super seriously which we enjoy.  Gyoza great.  Ramen Combo is also great - just wish I could do straight take-out.  If that were the case, I probably give this place 5 stars!

Hands down the best ramen I have eaten, and I've been to many places around LA, Orange County, New York, and Japan. What makes it amazing is the broth (pork based), that is perfectly flavored and salted. I could drink it straight. There is usually a wait that many people are dettered by, but it's REALLY worth the wait. It's worth twice the wait. You can always put your name down and walk down the street to Far Bar for a drink and check where your name is every 10-15 minutes. Great system! All the other menu items are great too, but everyone really just goes for the ramen. Daikokuya is the BEST!

I love this place. It's always crowded but for good reason. It has a really "showa" feel to the whole restaurant, which is kind of cool in a retro way. I love the tsuke-men and kichi-men especially. Those two are dipping noodles, and they're awesome in hotter weather when regular ramen is too hot. Tsuke-men has a pork broth, and kichi-men is their newer one and that has a more hot-and-sour taste to it. I personally prefer the kichi-men. The shredded pork bowl (with the combo) is delicious, but honestly, they give you way too much food for the combo! Which is still awesome because you can take it home! Gyoza is delicious, I love how they put on a ton of green onions on it. It tastes like they soak the green onion in water first because it's not as strong as normal green onion that's just cut. The booths are for 4 people but still, it's pretty small especially if everyone orders a combo! We had 5 people and had to tetris our way to fit 4 combos and 2 gyozas with a couple of drinks! The easiest place to park is at 101 N Judge John Aiso St, which is just a block away. It's a brand new parking lot that's $1 for the first hour (I think an additional $2 for the second?), or just a flat $3 after 5PM. Not a lot of people know about the lot because it's new and hidden under a pretty cool park, but it's great.

Gratuity was charged on party of three! I have been to this place quite a few times. The wait is always long but it didn't seem to bother me much. The very last time we went there was two weeks ago as a group of three. We each ordered the ramen combo, we also placed one takeout order. When the bill came out, we were charged a tip on food and tax without any prior notification. Not sure if this happened before, the sever did not mention a thing when she gave us the bill. We would have left the same amount of tip if not more so we didn't bother to say anything; however, this made us so uncomfortable we are not going back there again. Everyone just make sure to read the bill carefully so you don't get double charged!!

i love ramen... and though i really like daikokuya, i don't love it like i love other ramen. why?  well, it's really a matter of preference. daikokuya is respected with its reputation of a classic sort of ramen taste and take.  their noodles are good, the broth is deep enough for beginners to appreciate... and their combos are not bad either considering the amount of food you're paying for. that said, the superfluously long lines, the hipster party people and clubbers, well... i could probably do without at times. that said... again, extremely respect their ramen and their dishes... but classic isn't my thing all the time for ramen.

Nothing compares- not even Foo Foo Tei (in my opnion), to this ramen. Their chashu literally melts in  your mouth! The egg is cooked to perfection- just exactly when the yolk is cooked but still creamy and not gritty. The broth is so tasty, simple but layered with so much flavor. I mean, it should be, they cook it for 24 hours. The ramen is al dente so it's not mushy. I always order the same thing because it's simply the best- Daikoku Ramen for $8.50! Cons: Parking sucks! That is if you can even find any. Most of it is street and it's expensive. The line is ALWAYS long. The shortest wait time I've ever experienced was 20 minutes. They don't have the option of ordering To-Go at this location. The place is teenie tiny. Nevertheless, like I said, It's Worth It.

In my opinion the best ramen place in Little Tokyo. That's just my opinion of course haha. I was first brought here by my high school history teacher who promised us that "it would be the best ramen we eve tasted" and believe me, he did not disappoint. The ramen is the best thing to order here. The broth is exquisite, as well as the egg, green onions, and ginger that is also added for the wonderful flavor. The other choices on the menu as just as fine too. The "California Rolls" are delicious, the Bento boxes are great if you would like to share with someone, and if you are not up to eating the big bowl of ramen, you could always opt out to get the "half size" ramen as a substitute. Still delicious! A warning though, if you decide to come on a weekend, be prepared to arrive early and wait in line. I usually come with just one person so the wait is usually about 20 mins for me, but if you arrive with a large party (about 4-6 people), the wait could get up to an hour. All this aside, the wait is definitely worth it.

I have a love-hate relationship with this place. It's the first place I had legit ramen, but it's such a pain in the ass to go to, as popular as it is. I've searched high and low for places I could go to instead (Jinya, Orochon et al.) but have always found myself coming up short, between weirdly or poorly cooked eggs, too much MSG in the broth, not enough pork fat, no green onion, charges for add-ons, etc. So I reluctantly declare Daikokuya the champ, but I subtract one star for how miserable it is waiting for a table there, in cramped, uncomfortable quarters surrounded by gaggles of Asians if you're lucky enough to get a seat inside or outside on the sidewalk, where shrimpy little me gets cold. When I finally get seated, I feel like I'm one of those people in the Walking Dead, banging on the door, begging for them to let me in or I'll be shortly devoured by zombies. Just when I think I can't take anymore, the waitress calls our number and seats us, we are saved and tears of relief spring to my eyes. From then on it's a wonderful ramen experience (and it also has the best price, since they don't charge you to add an egg and there is already enough meat and green onion on it), but up to that point, it can be trying, since everyone and their mother seems to be there. That and they no longer accept plastic. WTF? I get it when they never had it (most Asian joints don't want to pay CC fees), but when they have it and take it away, I can't help but feel like that's a big middle finger to all its customers. :-/ But if you want good ramen, are willing to wait a long time and have cash in pocket, it's the place to go.

Eh, I thought the kotteri ramen was entirely too much pork fat.  To the point where it just tastes like fat.  My cousins liked it, but it just wasn't for me.  The noodles were good though and held up in the soup.  Their rice bowl was ok (also pretty fatty meat) and their sushi wasn't bad.  The gyoza came with a nice layer of fried skin on top.  Overall not worth it unless you're someone who loves pork marrow or the like.

Tiny place. Amazing ramen. Long wait. Cash Only. Totally worth it. Its easy to kill time after you put your name down. Skip the hot sake. And I dont know if its the hype, location, fond memories, but this is still my favorite Daikokuya. If youre tired of the wait, be careful which restaurant you end up settling for! Ive done it before, and the nearby ramen restaurants arent as good.

Nothing else really needs to be said about a restaurant with 3500 reviews, but this was the best ramen I've ever eaten. It's worth the hassle to find street parking in Downtown LA just to eat here. Be prepared to wait up to an hour, though. This place is very popular, and for good reason. The Daikokuya ramen is amazing. I've tried the koterri ramen before, but it's a little fatty for my tastes, but I can see how people would like it. Another plus: this place has fountain sodas with free refills. Not many Asian restaurants can say that.

What?! How have I not reviewed Daikokuya?! Okay, so I've been here several times. I used to say this was THE BEST RAMEN in SOCAL! But now I'm not so sure anymore. I don't know if their broth changed or what, but when I went recently, it didn't taste as amazing as it did before. We waited an hour to get seated, our food came out fast, and the service was friendly and quick. But the ramen... it just wasn't as flavorful and as delicious as I remembered. I love how the noodles are slightly on the harder side though! But the broth.. hmm.. it was missing that pizzazz that I once knew. Even putting in a lot of ginger didn't do it for me. If you're hungry or it's your first time there, DEFINITELY get the ramen combo that comes with the shredded pork bowl! That bowl is sooo good! It may even be the redeeming factor of your meal if you're not enjoying the ramen as much. And the two just go so well together! Parking sucks. You can get street parking if you're lucky or park in the structure across the street. Overall, I think the ramen at Hakata Ramen Shinsengumi in Gardena is actually better than this place and is still my favorite! But Daikokuya is for sure no less than 2nd place.

Totally worth the wait (and the wait can be long)!   Recommend ordering the daikoku ramen (make it a combination for a few bucks more, I chose the fried rice as my side plate...It.Was.Amazing!).  Love the semi-hard boiled egg that's in the ramen (it's boiled but the yolk is still in the liquid stage). The broth is also bomb!  The gyoza was great, however, an even better appetizer I think is the sliced roast pork.  Unbelievably tender.   Prices are reasonable.  Great service as well. They don't take reservations, which sucks, and it's cash only.  Nevertheless, I have no hesitation spending some dough here again.

I remember about a year ago trying to come here was a nightmare because the line was horrendous! Around 7:15pm on a Wednesday night, the wait for three people was minimal. Two of us ordered the Daikoku Ramen, while another ordered the Daikoku Ramen with added pork fat plus small fried rice combination. We also shared pork & vegetable gyoza as a starter. The gyoza are not the typical crescent moon shape, but instead they are rectangular. Regardless of its shape, they were still good. The ramen was delicious and I have to say that I like Daikokuya better than Orochon. I liked this broth better. It was richer, but it was still too salty for me. Along with the al-dente ramen, there was pork, soft boiled egg, bean sprouts and a sprinkling of green onions. The fried rice was also good. It seems like a weird combination of rice and ramen, but it worked out fine. The fried rice came with corn & pork and was good too. We were extremely full and took home more than half our meal! Yay, I get to finally check off Daikokya off my "Must Eat" list after living in LA for two years!

Went on off-hours hoping that there wouldn't be a line.  No such luck.  We hungrily waited outside about forty minutes or so, growing slightly more impatient with every opening of the main entrance which wafted the aroma of the tonkatsu broth out onto the sidewalk while satisfied patrons exited discussing how much they enjoyed their meal. Needless to say, when our number was called we sat down at the counter eager to order before sitting down and scooting our stools in.  I ordered a combination consisting of a bowl of the Daikoku ramen and a small tuna sashimi bowl.  The noodles were great, the broth was flavorful and rich with a light milky/creamy texture, the pork slices were very tender (wish I ordered extra) and the soft boiled egg was good though a tad bit overcooked.  The only problem I had with this bowl of ramen was the amount of green onions and bean sprouts they put in it.  It's almost overwhelming.  The strong flavor of the mound of freshly cut green onion takes away from the flavor of the broth and the texture of the handful of uncooked bean sprouts gets in the way of enjoying the noodles. Friendly service and appreciative business overall.  I think everyone that worked there thanked us pretty much in unison as we left.

3.5 stars. I'm surprised this place is rated so high. It's not bad but does the food warrant such a long wait? Not really. The atmosphere is like a small mom and pop ramen shop - but really popular and overrun with a really diverse crowd. Shoddy stools at the bar, looks a bit dirty, not exactly a hole-in-the-wall but has that vibe. Vintage Japanese advertisements on the wall, huge red lanterns in the window/waiting area...I really like the way this place looks and feels. But.... I'm very disappointed in the gyoza. Not because it tasted bad but because it was undercooked. The pork was reddish pink and cold. No, not just a little pink, I mean like wow-that-is-obviously-raw pink. I wanted to notify the server but was afraid someone was going to spit in our ramen or something weird like that (you know, for complaining). Haha, I know, I am a bit paranoid. Anyway, it was really too bad. The first bite was good until I got to the center of the gyoza. :T I wonder if this kind of stuff is why they have a "B" food safety rating (see their front window).... The fried rice was SO SALTY. WTH! It's more like a Chinese style fried rice dish, not the Japanese style we were hoping for. Oh well. Cut back on the salt and I think this dish is decent. I ordered the Tsukemen because I have been searching for good Tsukemen since I ate at Musashi in Shibuya, Tokyo. I was really excited to see it on the menu. I shouldn't have expected so much, that was sort of dumb of me, haha. Daikokuya has pretty good ramen noodles. I was really happy about that. Perfectly cooked and would suit most any ramen broth pretty well. But I was disappointed by how dry the pork was and how bland the broth was. However, I think once you let the green onions and pork sit in the broth for a while, the taste gets better and becomes pretty decent. Dipping the noodles into the broth brought back memories of Tokyo so I was pretty happy overall. So about 3 stars for the Tsukemen alone. The Daikoku ramen was decent. But we both found ourselves longing for the soft pork of Santouku Ramen and the amazing flavor of ramen that is available elsewhere....it's weird that the famous and popular Daikokuya makes us long for food from other shops. Maybe I am being a bit harsh.... I think Daikokuya is just an average place. I don't hate it, I don't love it. Would I recommend it to others? Sure, maybe just to try it out and have their own experience. But perhaps waiting anything over 40 minutes is just not worthwhile. I might return but don't have any real conviction or craving to.

Amazing ramen. DELICIOUS and hearty broth. The prices are very wallet friendly. I ordered the combination signature Daikokuya ramen with a side of tuna sashimi bowl. I think it was around $14? It definitely filled me up and I still had sooo much ramen left over! The ramen bowls are much bigger than your typical Pho bowl. The ramen includes a soft boil egg and fatty goodness slices of pork belly. The way the egg yolk oozes into my bowl and coats my noodles..O M G I'm drooling as we speak. They give you such thick slices of tuna. I will be back whenever I go back to L.A!

My friend recommended me this place and told me apparently its suppose to be super amazing ramen hence I was craving for a bowl of soup that day.  Even on weekdays it gets really packed.  We had to wait about 30-45 minutes.   Tip: They only take cash! We ordered the most popular ramen w kotteri style and to me it was ok.  I kept adding stuff to make it spicy because I like my bowl to have a kick to it.  Broth to me tasted very fatty.  I loved the egg in it.  It made the soup taste wayyyyy better.  If I was to compare I'd probably say hakata in gardena is wayyyyyy BETTER! the one thing they did have that was probably the best I ever had was their FRIED RICE!! try it!! its amazinggggggggg!

A fact about me: I'm not a huge ramen fan. In fact, this is my first ramen review. (shhh shhh shh) I took Fia R.'s incredibly genius advice and came at 11 - opening time. There was already a crowd of people, but I thankfully didn't experience a wait ;) One thing about Daikokuya is that I can't deny that their ramen broth is flavorful (with or without the added kotteri style). Kotteri style is a soup base of pork back fat. I requested the Daikoku Ramen, Kotteri style initially, then inspected that my soup bowl didn't have excessive oil or visibly floating fat, so I asked the waitress, "excuse me, where the hell is zee FAT?"   She brought out a side of back fat, where I squeamishly poured in half of into my bowl. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Oh how visual effects are important to every experience. The texture of the noodles were right, not too soft but not too tough; a perfect al dente. I also liked how the hard boiled egg wasn't thoroughly cooked, but the yolk still held solid. I definitely recommend to opt for the combos, where you can other try non-ramen dishes. I shared the salmon roe bowl which was very simple and delicious (salmon roe, warm rice, nori flakes) and I also liked their cabbage salad. Although Daikokuya makes a solid ramen, I wouldn't recommend anyone to wait long lines for this. I was hoping this place would be a quick hello-ramenfix-goodbye experience, but this was definitely long and slow. Am I a huge fan of ramen yet? Almost there, but not quite.

I might be the ultimate Daikokuya creepy stalker, but  really, I'm their ultimate #1 fan! I love Little Tokyo's Daikokuya so much that I even go out of my way to find their social media fanpages so that I can express my gratitude and my love for their ramen and fried rice. My weekdays are consumed with work, but that has never stopped me from traveling 20 miles back to Downtown, LA to wait roughly about an hour to eat at Daikokuya at 11:00pm. I work minutes away from the joint located in Hacienda Heights, but no location compares to the one in Little Tokyo. Not even the one in Monterey Park. You'll just have to come here and experience it for yourself. If you don't feel what I feel for Little Tokyo's Daikokuya, then great. I don't want to share Daikokuya, my love, with anyone, anyway. :P First timers, I highly recommend getting the combination. You'll be able to enjoy a big bowl of Daikokuya's ramen along with a small (but perfect sized) bowl of a savory rice dish. Go for the fried rice--seriously. Omg. ohhhh my....gosh! I want me a bowl rah now!!!!!!!! and the salad that comes with the combination orders--what is in that amazing dressing?! Writing about it makes me salivate. Hm, that was slightly embarrassing and non-lady-like to write but love makes you express crazy things! Random thought, but I'd like to share this. Daikokuya is loved by so many, it even shows in their red cushioned (well, not-so-cushioned-anymore) vinyl seats. I visit quite frequently and every new visit to Daikokuya, I notice their seats just get more and more weathered. Maybe this is what I'm so drawn to. Your imperfections make you that much more perfect to me. Anyway. Love seriously makes you write crazy and even non-sense and super cliche things. Anyway, again. I've eaten here in the early afternoons, dinner time and what I call, second-dinner time (aka when you accidentally eat too early at 6pm and have to eat again at 10pm!) . Girls always say they have a second stomach for dessert. Whatever, I have a second AND third stomach for Daikokuya given any time and any day!

I'm a pretty big fan of ramen. So naturally, I came here for the first time feeling a bit excited to eat here. I heard about the ridiculously long wait/lines but we got in surprisingly quick (24 minutes). Food: 3 stars I've noticed a rather large yelp following behind Daikokuya. After eating here, I think it's over hyped. I've had way better ramen far closer to home. I thought their ramen was bland in comparison to other places I frequent.  I was expecting their ramen to be richer and fattier but it just wasn't. I also wasn't feeling the bean sprouts. Call me crazy but I think the ramen is better at Kanpai in Westchester. To each their own. Service: 4 stars The service at Daiko was similar to most Japanese restaurants. The waiters/waitresses are very courteous and attentive. Conclusion: 3.5 stars I wouldn't be opposed to eating here by any means if someone else suggested we go. However, I wouldn't personally choose Daiko to come enjoy some good (IMO) ramen. On a good note.... their Fried Spicy Tuna (ground spicy tuna wrapped in a shiso leaf and deep fried in a tempura batter) was absolutely delicious!! This is a must have appetizer to compliment your main entree/dish!!! Do try! The Fried Spicy Tuna gets 5 stars!

Damn good ramen - as good as Ramen Dojo in San Mateo and Ippudo in NY. Only one better in the States in my humble opinion is Totto Ramen in NY. The toukatsu broth is rich, creamy, and very well seasoned.  The noodles were cooked al dente, and never soggy.  And of course, the egg was cooked perfectly - still slightly liquid in the middle.   In Los Angeles, this is as good as it's going to get.  Come here for ramen in LA, nowhere else.  Just make sure you are ready for a very long wait and line.

Best ramen ever!  This coming from someone who isn't very fond of pork belly or all the fattiness that comes with it.  The broth, noodles, meat, fish cakes, and bean sprouts were absolutely perfect.  Only part I didn't care for was the soft boiled egg which just took up space in the bowl...space where more meat could have gone. After a harrowing 50 minute wait I couldn't help but order a combo which came with a huge bowl of ramen and a small bowl of tuna sashimi.  Their tuna bowl was delicious!  The sashimi was melt in your mouth fresh and came in a simple and cute little presentation over really moist and flavorful rice. When I do come back I might just have to get their large tuna sashimi bowl and just mooch off the bf's ramen.

There's a sort of perfection about Japanese cuisine... That kotteri broth had me at first slurp, and the succulence of the fatty pork along with the soft boiled egg just made it that much better. I've had authentic ramen before, but I must say Daikokuya is the best I've had thus far! The shredded pork bowl was filled with the perfect contrast of tanginess from the red ginger along with the perfect amount of sweetness from the meat. The portions are big and worth it for the price compared to other ramen places I've been to..I split a ramen and a shredded pork bowl which was PLENTY so I might even recommend getting the order of house special ramen with the small shredded pork bowl to split? Depending on how hungry you are!! Thank you Daikokuya for leaving me with a warm and happy belly :)

Absolutely fantastic food, absolutely the most absurd dining experience I've ever had. The wait can be hours long literally, and they don't take reservations. People are literally passing out from hunger and exhaustion while waiting for a seat. The space also has two areas that they use as waiting areas for customers, that are inside of the restaurant. This made no sense to me at all, they could easily seat 10 more people in those areas and just make people wait outside (which they do anyway). Even though I enjoyed their food a great deal, no one meal is worth that wait in this town, especially when there are a dozen other authentic Japanese Ramen shops in LA which are easily as good, that don't have a business model which guarantees customer misery for a lot longer than it can guarantee satisfaction.

So yummy in my tummy.  Now if only my feet and my tummy can come to a compromise.   The wait here is long... too long sometimes. I once came here when it was 10:30AM and there was a wait outside already.  And the restaurant doesn't even open until 11:00 AM.  ::: sigh:::   This restaurant opens at 11AM and closes when the broth is out.  I have to admit that the first time trying Daikokuya, I complained, "Why spend $8.50 on ramen when I can get an entire box of ramen at the asian supermarket for $10 bucks?"  Boy was I wrong.  The ramen here is phenomenal.  Some suggestions would be to go easy on the green onions.  They get a little too "green onion" happy there.   I usually get the combo which is daikokuya ramen + pork belly rice bowl for $11.95.  DEE-LISH-SHUSH!!!!

This place has some tasty ramen, However not sure if that outweighs the having to wait in the usual length line. If you have the time to wait , then is an obvious choice.

After all of the hype surrounding this place, I finally went to eat there recently. Luckily for me, I called my friend who was already on his way there, so by the time I got there, they were at the front of the line. I didn't have to wait. Parking was still a pain in the butt though... I got the ramen combo, which came with the ramen and the shredded pork bowl, as well as a salad. The salad was, well, a salad. Nothing special there. Then I tried the ramen. I enjoy Japanese ramen, but I haven't tried that many in this area. However, I found the ramen to be pretty bland. It wasn't bad, but it was just slightly under my personal preference. I added some of the seasonings on the side tray, which made it a lot better for me personally. I didn't even get close to finishing my food. I couldn't finish my ramen or my pork bowl, even though I shared that pork bowl with a friend. I took it togo and at the rest at home. Overall, I really enjoyed the dining experience. I just don't ever want to drive there again. As long as someone else drives, I'm game to come back!

I had the daikoku ramen in "kotteri" and let me say that this was one of the best tonkotsu ramen I've had in some time.   This place is like a time slip to the showa era with vintage posters and signs and stuff.  and all of the wait staff are japanese.   The tokotosu broth is thick with a punch of umami.  This might be a bit too much and heavier in kotteri, but if that's your thing, then this is a must taste.   The noodle is curly and al dente.  I personally like straighter noodles for tonkotsu ramen, but that's a personal preference. Overall, it's a definite A for me.

Gotta up it to 5 stars just because I ate ramen earlier that same night at Santouka and I still wanted to come here. It's that good just as long as you get the combination with either the small fried rice or the shredded pork bowl. Ramen twice in one night. Yeah I'm fat like that.

Already over 3000 reviews? I'll make this short. Not too many places I would wait in line for but this place is one of them. I love garlic and they have crushed garlic on the table. Personally I have to garlicfy the ramen because of my love for garlic the but it's excellent without it too. Hasn't failed me yet with impressing guests interested in ramen.

I'm no Ramen expert. I've been to three, Ajisen is by far the worse, but  I keep coming back here for their Ramen and others. No way I'll wait over fifteen minutes for my ramen. I tried coming here three times after my massage across the the street and three times I opted to leave than wait. So I was summoned to show up to Court in Downtown and of course it's no fun going to court, but then I think "oh, I can grab Daikakuya for lunch, right when they opened - no wait! Yah! " lol I love their complementary appetizer of cabbage slaw. What's in the sauce yo? Fish roe, soy sauce, carrots, mayo, onion, and celery? Won't somebody tell me? It's good stuff. Ramen, it's solid - I like their condiments: Fresh garlic paste, and red peppers. Their broth is probably as good as it gets. Get their shredded pork over rice it's loaded with green onions, and a poke of the pickled ginger. I never finish it, portion is too big so I like taking it to go and play chef  at home by throwing in new batch of ramen in the broth. Recaps: Ramen is as good as it gets. (If there's a better ramen, do share ) The wait is terrible. Unless you got an hour to kill, don't come here. Hot inside, definitely not a date spot. You'd be too self conscious to slurp with your ramen, then you end up blowing your nose, and wiping your sweat like your Daddy. These are not attractive looks. Service - super friendly. They're just so sweet, calm, and cool.

It was suggested that I try this place as a true ramenholic. After attending one of my 12 step program meetings  to cure my ramen addiction, I happened to walk by Daikokuya and saw an empty booth! I dragged my Mother into the restaurant and proceeded to scour the menu for the various options to feed my ramen addiction.  I thought this was a Ramenya, so I thought I had more choices that the tonkotsu ramen, kotteri syle or no kotteri... Ramen is a very subjective dish.  With so many components it really comes down to what YOUR preferences are.  As a noodleholic first, ramenholic second, my first concern are the noodles, they just HAVE to be the yellow, slightly curly, thicker noodles.  And not the white, straight and thin noodles.  These noodles are A, number 1 here. Broth, very good Kotteri flavor (added soup extracted from the back fat) added to the tonkotus,the thicker broth with the added flavor!   What no fried onions?  Oh well... Menma (bamboo) http://1tess.wordpress.c… was very good and the egg!  OMGosh!  The egg is very important as well.  First of all, it is a whole egg, not cut in half and drum roll...  It was a soft boiled egg!  perfect! Two slices of pork belly, what more could a hungry Ramenholic want as a topping on their ramen!  Scallions and bean sprouts finish the topping and the relationship worked cohesively in the bowl. Mom ordered the Chow Mein aka Yakisoba http://www.yelp.com/biz_…. It was a tad sweet, not what I am normally accustomed to. Very good, made with the ramen noodles. Bought fried rice for the hubby to go. Very well made with imitation crab - sorry, no pic as he came home as I was walking Shiro and it was consumed in my absence. Tonkotsu Kotteri Ramen - 5 Stars   Disappointed that they only had two choices, Tonkotsu and Tonkotsu with Kotteri Chow mein aka Yakisoba - 31/2 Stars Mom and I both did not care too much for the sweeter taste Fried rice - 4 Stars Needless to say, my ramen addiction will be nursed with their ramen.

This little jewel in J-Town is quite possibly one of the better ramen houses in the LA area in my mind. No frilles, basic menu helps this place to focus on giving the customer a quality ramen experience every time. The price is fairly cheap considering the craft of making the ramen broth. To get a pot of the broth, they need to have it cooking for a full day (that's what makes it so good. the flavor is locked in the broth).Yes, they are a chain, as they have a few locations now, but they are always busy, so make sure you have some time to spare when attempting to eat here. But, I always try to stop by when I'm in J-Town. Try it! There are other ramen houses nearby, but this place is far by the best in J-Town.

I don't know how to feel about this so-called "Best Ramen in LA." Went here this weekend and while it was delicious, I don't know if it truly is the best of the best. I've tried the Daikokuya Ramen, the gyoza, and the sushi here. Everything seemed pretty standard for a Japanese restaurant. The broth of the ramen was extremely flavorful and it is definitely crave-worthy. The sushi was nothing special but still above-average. I liked the gyoza but again, nothing spectacular. Things get so over-hyped in downtown LA. Before you know it, everyone is blogging about a place that the cyber glitterati  are all migrating to for the next 'must-have' dish. I sadly believe this has happened with Daikokuya. While it is a good Japanese restaurant, I don't think I deserve to wait in a line like I'm going on Space Mountain at Disney Land. There are other great ramen places all over Little Tokyo, so if I can't get a table here it's not a huge deal to me. ...Oh! CASH ONLY, waaah :'(

Looking for perfect ramen (Japanese soup with noodles) in a lively environment? Daikokuya is the place to go! In the heart of Downtown LA, situated in Little Tokyo, this is a true gem of Los Angeles. Average wait: 45 minutes. Average rating: priceless.  On average expect to pay $9 for noodles served in a huge bowl that will definitely hit the spot on that cold LA night.  This is a hip spot to take friends, a casual date (but not romantic! only take her here if you're pretty "comfortable" with each other!), or a lone ranger night out!

Delicious ramen! But be prepared to wait. The restaurant is small and so are the tables, so not recommended for large parties.  Groups of 4 or less are probably best. If I'm hungry I usually get the ramen and fried rice combo. It's a lot of food so get ready to loosen the belt or wear stretchy pants. And don't come here on a diet. The broth is delicious, rich and fatty.  And the fried rice is no different.

AUTHENTIC ramen! I know this because I'm an ESL teacher and my Japan students said this place is just like JAPAN. I come here all the time. It is my go to Ramen place. Don't be frightened by the B rating (means it tastes better!) or the huge crowd outside. A huge crowd means the place is delicious! When you get there, write your name on the clipboard inside. Go ahead, push past all the crowd. You need to get your name on that list. You will see a long list of names before you, but just remember which number you are and soon you will be partaking of awesomeness. The wait can be 30 min of so but it's so worth it, even late at night. JUST DO IT! I usually get the combo and share with my husband because we usually do this after we have already eaten dinner and want a late night snack (open til 1am). With the combo you get a delicious bowl of steaming ramen, a BOMB salad, and one other dish (around $11-13). Let me stop here and tell you about the salad. It is the tastiest dressing I have ever tasted at any Japanese restaurant! I love it! OMG I want some right now. As far as the other dish you can get, Chicken Teriyaki is SO GOOD. A little crunchy on the outside and not too sweet. The Pork Katsu is also REALLY good. I think I prefer it to the chicken. YUUUMMMMMMM. If you love ramen or if you have never had ramen, or if you are just hungry and in the downtown area, you need to go here!

I didn't try their Ramen since I had given up meat for Lent, so I opted for the Teriyaki Eel Bowl... It was absolutely AMAZING!  the Eel was so tender and flavorful, I was in heaven.  The only other place I have had eel this good, was when I was vacationing in Japan.  I didn't finish it all, so I took it home to have for lunch the next day, and it was just as delish.   Now that Lent is long gone, I am ready to try some RAMEN!!!

If there was a perfect bowl of ramen out there in the universe, I believe that I have just found it!!  Daikokuya's ramen with Kotteri style (extra fattiness and flavor without extra charge) was simply mouth watering!!  What an amazing treat! First and foremost, we did have a difficult time finding this place in the middle of Little Tokyo (as always, parking is a nightmare), but I believe the sign was the crowd of people hanging out in front of one storefront.  Like lemmings, we followed the crowd and found ourselves in the middle of a ramen shop.  Not to mention that we had to pass several empty unoccupied ramen restaurants to find the whole asian population in Little Tokyo waiting at Daikokuya. We added our name to the list and took a walk around town.  I know that we didn't count the ramen restaurants on the same street, but there was a huge number of them that were really close to empty.  Even if we did have the doubt and wavered slightly due to hunger, we stayed true to Daikokuya!  We came back and waited a bit, and the wait went pretty quickly because a lot of the numbers didn't show up when called upon.  YAY for us! The bowl of Daikokuya's ramen with Kotteri style was the best ramen ever!  It is even better than the one that I had in Hawaii!!  The flavor and texture of the broth was superb with the perfect amount of heat!  Did I mention that their boiled egg was OM-PERFECT?!?  Really creamy, oozing, and yummy in the ramen!! MmMmMm!  The tender chunks of cooked pork-belly with the combination of the egg AND flavor - EXCELLENT!!!!   This is definitely a bowl of ramen that one needs to write home about!  If I wasn't a ramen-lover before, I am definitely an addict now!  I will welcome myself to the club - "Welcome Cindy P. to the RLA Club! The Ramen-Lovers Anonymous Club!" MmMmMm

I've been thinking a lot about ramen lately and I can't believe I've yet to give a shout out to the best - Daikokuya. Morgan A. is right - the ramen is made in the biggest pot I've ever seen in my life. I feel like I'm in The Ramen Girl when I'm here. "Her romance is on pins and noodles." Yeah. Anyways... You can get a huge bowl of Dikokuya Ramen + a small fried rice and a salad (love the salad) for $11.50. This is a steal!!! You will probably wait a really long time for a table, but as long as you're prepared (and even if you aren't), its so worth it! It gave me a stomach ache once, and I don't even care!

I feel like I was cursed from trying this place, because something ALWAYS came up and prevented me from coming here. I finally broke the curse and that year long curse made my meal so much more enjoyable. I highly recommend the combo because it's a lot of food and it's a really good deal. Decor+Ambiance: 2 stars ** I've never been to Japan, but this place is what I imagine a ramen house would look and feel like in Japan. This place is poorly ventilated and it's very hot, especially on those LA heat waves. You'll be sweating bullets while enjoying the brothy goodness. Food: 5 Stars ***** 1) Ramen Kotteri style - This was by the best ramen I have ever had! The portions are generous, the broth Kotteri style (base of pork back fat) was AMAZING and full of flavor.  The noodles were just the right texture I prefer in ramen, not too soft or tough. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… 2) Gyoza - The gyoza here were LEGEND-DARY! Not your typical potsticker-like shape, but  more rectangular. They were pan fried and the amount of pork and vegetables were perfectly balanced. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… 3) Pork Bowl - Overall, the bowl was soo tasty! I loved soft pork along with the sauce and scallions. I couldn't finish it because I had gyoza and ramen, so I reheated it the next day and It was still bomb! http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Service: 3 stars*** Needs some improvement. I never really expected excellent service after reading all the reviews. I just wanted to come in, get my food in a timely manner and leave. Luckily, my friend came earlier and waited for about 15 minutes before getting seated , and I came just in time. Come here expecting a line and during peak times, expect about 45 min to 1 hour wait. Parking: Daikokuya is in Little Tokyo, so parking is going to be a bit of a problem. There's a lot one block east and a small lot directly across the street. Either way you'll need to pay for parking.

There was much anticipation for this restaurant and was hoping to have the same experience I had in the silicon valley area when I last went on vacation.  Unfortunately, I left a little disappointed since I thought LA food would be just as good. I ordered the combo.  I got mine with the daikokuya ramen plus fried rice.  The broth doesn't seem as flavorful and the pork isn't really tasty or melt in your mouth great.  The egg was cold but was marinated earlier on to soak up a soy sauce like flavor and noodles were fine.  Too much bean sprouts so most of it stayed sitting in my bowl.  The only thing I recommend eating here is the friend rice!  Of all things, this was the tastiest fried rice I can ever remember eating.  Price was $12 and was okay value.   Service was okay.  Waited for a table at 2pm for 25 minutes.  This isn't a kid friendly spot so no high chair or booster seat.

Over 3,000 reviews later and still a hit. Went last night (mid week) around 6pm and we waited for an hour. There were about 12 parties in front of us. Still crowded like the 405 Valley Pass. Even with ShinSen Ramen opening around the corner, Daiko you haven't phased. You're still a beast. Ramen still tastes the same since the first time I stepped afoot many moons ago. Still serving up that XL bowl. Egg still runny (Sorry Kiki N.). Fried rice @ this particular location is still oily but still bangin'. Obviously business is still booming.

Just like so many other people, I LOVE the ramen here.  I got the broth "kotteri style" which just means it's a little fattier and richer (just the way I like it!).  I love that the broth is rich without being salty, and I love that they have grated garlic at the table for you to add to the dish.  Me and my BF both took a heaping spoonful of that good stuff. Noodles were cooked perfectly, the egg was delicious, but what put it over the top was their pulled pork donburi.  It was soooo good!  I absolutely loved every bite of it.  It totally kicked Santouka's pork rice bowl's butt! Yes, I hate the wait time too, but I can't blame the restaurant for that.  As impatient as I am, I'm wlling to make an exception for this place.... good food sometimes requires patience.  I'm working on that.

I went here at 11PM on a Wednesday night and only had to wait about 25 minutes, which wasn't bad considering I've heard people waiting hours.   The chicken egg + ramen combo was pretty good.  The broth was the perfect intensity of flavor.  The "salad" that comes with the meal is a really small bowl of chopped cabbage with mayo-based dressing.  I was a little disappointed by this side item, but I understand that the main course is definitely the ramen.   I don't think it's waiting over an hour for, but if you go at a time that isn't as busy, then it's worth the short wait :)

This was the first place I ever had real ramen six years ago and has been the standard all other ramen must live up to.  I'm always excited when I get to come here.  The noodles and broth are so good and the egg takes it over the top in to sublime territory.  The few non-ramen entrees I've had here are just okay- if you don't want ramen you'd probably be better off elsewhere.  If you don't eat pork, you won't be able to have the ramen since it's an essential inextricable ingredient. Just accept the fact that you will have to wait a long time and you will be deliciously rewarded.  My latest strategy for making it through the wait is to grab a drink over at Far Bar down the block; beer can make that wait not seem as long!

Just went this past Monday, (Presidents Day), Feb 20, 2012. I went to this place once, years ago, with a foodie friend.  We stood in line for 90 minutes, and I remember thinking it was better than any ramen I had in Japan -- we had both studied in Japan together (in Chiba, near Tokyo).  On my last trip, I did go to Fukuoka, where the popular tonkotsu broth came from... and I'll still say this place is the best I've had, thus far. This past visit, I wanted to introduce my friend to some good ramen, as they were not previous fans.  I would not have stood in line for over an hour for ramen without a good excuse, so this was as good as any.  We put out names down (there were 7 parties ahead of us), and crossed the street to have a drink at Nirvana. Came back within 15 minutes or so, and had to wait an additional 10 to be seated (but we got a table, and not the bar). The 4 of us already had dinner earlier, so I got a bowl of ramen with the tempura to share.  My date dug into the ramen as I started on the tempura... by the time I got to try the ramen, it was a bit soggy =(  But it was still delicious.  I was more happy that my other 2 friends really enjoyed the chashu.  It was funny I mentioned to them how this place didn't skimp with the chashu, having presented 4 large strips of chashu... and how in Japan, I would usually see a single slice.  And the bowls here were twice the size!  But, my friend replied that he was thinking they didn't give enough chashu -- and we both shared a laugh at the result of the American appetite's demands. If you are on your journey in becoming a ramen fan, I recommend you watch Tampopo, and also look into the different types of ramen broth.  My date said she still loved Santouka Ramen's broth more -- but she likes their spicy miso broth... two very different flavors!  If you're a fan of tonkotsu, a rich, pork bone broth, then give this place a go!  Just expect to wait... a long time.

Seriously people? On a mission to find ramen even SLIGHTLY reminiscent of Japan's. Another failed mission, but the journey continues. I had the gyoza. You could tell they put love into these little packages. I ordered the house ramen which was ok, but not extraordinary. Points for noodle consistency/texture and chasu, but if I went back I'd definitely get the Kotteri. Its a heavier broth, but the flabor of the broth is more complex. My favorite ramen place in cali so far is ramen dojo in san mateo. Worth the wait reminiscent of the club on a Friday night. I love all the options they have so you can personally customize your bowl. In short, the Daikokuya broth is bland. Sorry, truth hurts. P.s. Got some time to kill while you wait? Take a  5 minute stroll to Lette's for delightful macarons.

over hyped or what?! i came here because my friend was raving about this place, saying that it was the best ramen place in the entire US of A and i was utterly disappointed! BUT, the service was friendly and prompt. i ordered the daikokuya ramen, no bean sprouts. here's what i thought of the ingredients: bland, is the best way i can put the broth. It's a pork flavor broth, but it tasted watered down and i had to add a shit load of chilly peppers and that garlic mush before i could even semi-enjoy it. the noddles however, we're the right consistency. Perfectly cooked, not too soggy, not to tough. the meat was also pretty flavorful, but there wasn't enough! two measly pieces did little for my stomach. the egg, wasn't anything special, it was an egg. the end. and then the massive amount of green onion that seemed to fill the entire bowl, what are you trying to hide, daikokuya?! we also ordered the gyoza, pretty sure my sodium intake sky rocketed after one piece. anyway, i've heard from people that this place is better than ramen dojo. i have taste buds, and this place doesn't even compare.

This is the first ramen i ever tried and it was absolutely amazing...Only been to one other ramen place and this one is still the best in my opinion. I know there are alot of good ramen places out there but i am sticking to this one. The service here is great, the food is awesome, It is rather small but i have found if you come here at odd hours like 2-3 on a friday or thursday its generally not busy and you can walk right in. Otherwise be prepared to wait a while if you come here during peak times. I recommend driving by and seeing if there are people standing outside..if so its gonna be a wait. This place is also CASH ONLY. So go to the atm across the street first.

I was craving ramen after a long weekend of studying before my exam, and a bunch of my friends recommended this restaurant called Daikokuya, so we decided to try it out.  We ended up waiting an hour and half to be seated, since the restaurant is really small - it only seats about 20-30 people.  Be prepared to wait if you go, the lady on the phone said 30 minutes when I called, but boy was she off!  I got the Daikokuya ramen (I think there are only 2-3 options on the menu anyways), and it WAS good, but I'm not sure if it was extra flavorful and yummy because I was so deliriously hungry after waiting for so long, or because it was actually good...  However, there are also locations in other parts of LA, so I'll probably try the one in Alhambra next time, which is supposed to have 1/2 price pitchers during happy hour and a much MUCH shorter wait time.  Fast service, large bowls, and delicious ramen, but gets four stars from me for the ridiculous wait time.

Came back here for lunch and i still dont get the hype. A visiting friend of mine waited 90 minutes for this place. Whyyy? It's just so...average in a  city with plenty of better options. I got the kotteri this time thinking it would give it more pork richness. All I got was chunks of fat mixed in - gross. At least at tsujita its dissolved into the soup. I had to eat around the fat chunks. This place is ok but I wouldnt wait more than 10 minutes. Also, the fried rice is better than the ramen. There are so many better ramen joints in LA..and without such ridiculous waits. (unless you go to tsujita on a weekend)

La-La land....you keep disappointing me.  Such high ratings and an hour wait really had me thinking that Daikokuya was going to give Ramen Dojo or even Orenchi a run for their money.  Not even close! Based on the soup base, I compared the Daikokuya ramen to Orenchis.  We ordered the Kotteri flavor which is extra fatty pork based broth.  The broth wasn't anything special.  It lacked flavor and tasted like instant soup base.  Honestly, the whole bowl tasted like packaged fresh ramen that you can buy at Nijiya.  The noodles tasted like the packaged ramen.  It didn't have bounce or the al-dente chewiness ramen should have.  The egg which is supposed to be boiled on the outside but runny on the inside wasn't.  Totally overcooked.   This was not worth driving 400 something miles for and standing in an hour line.  Half way through I didn't even want to finish my bowl.  It is really that un-appetizing.  Disappointed.

Daikokuya's ramen is superb, but I'm sure you can already tell by the other 3000 or so reviews. There's something about the broth. It's amazingly rich and fatty and the noodles are of perfect texture and thickness. The regular sized bowl of ramen is huge, so if you're on the smaller size or have a smaller appetite order the mini bowl, which is still pretty filling. Another menu item favorite is the pork fried rice. Thus, I suggest the combination Daikoku ramen and small fried rice. I've been told the home-made gyoza is fantastic as well. Daikokuya, I will give you a 5 despite the following complaints: cash only policy, the fact that you're a little dirty (actually more than a little), and the humongous lukewarm egg in the ramen, which I find too scary to be appetizing. I've never had a problem with the wait time. I just come really late at night.

I think the 3000+ reviews for this place speaks for itself. You know the place is good when there is a huge line waiting outside on a hot summer day for hot ramen. I've heard about how long lines get for this place and have seen it myself. Luckily I came here before the dinner rush and didn't have to wait that long. Place is very small and only has about 7 or 8 booths and the rest are seats along the bar. I tried the original ramen which is what you should try if it is your first time here. I don't eat a lot of ramen but it is definitely the best tasting ramen I've had. The broth is full of flavor, a little salty, and can be very addicting. It is one of the top reviewed places on yelp so it is a must try spot.

Daikokuya definitely hits the spot when an uncontrollable ramen craving kicks in. If you asked me a few years ago, I would have voted this place as one of my favorites. But after our best ramen scavenger hunt in Japan a few years ago - as well as all the other great places popping up all over LA, it's still good.  Just not great.. PROS: No nickle and diming!  You get chasu, green onions, mushrooms, bamboo, bean sprouts and the delicious egg! Did I mention the delicious egg??  Cooked medium and a golden juicy yolk.  YUM! Tsukemono / Oshinko - Perfect sidedish.  Why don't other places offer this? My favorite is the shiso wrapped in takwan.  Can we say UMAMI??? CONS: Flavorful broth but seemed watered down. Limited / expensive parking Cash only...   Obviously I don't love/hate the place.  It's decent ramen and totally worth checking out when you're in Jtown..

Dear Daikokuya, I like you, I do. You had me at hello with your combo meal of your ever-so-famous ramen and fried rice. Though your fried rice was tasty, I had to neglect it once the ramen arrived. It was a lot to consume at once, but I didn't mind taking you home. You were just as delicious when microwaved. But I have a confession. My beating ramen-heart still belongs to Santouka. Don't get me wrong, you're as good as they'll get in the ramensphere but I've already made up my mind after spending some time with you. Remember, it's me, not you. xo

Okay okay.. I know the wait is pretty ridiculous.. I seriously loathe lines and crowd but I think this is one of the few times that I make lines an exception when waiting for Daikokuya. I've been to many ramen restaurants in the past and I still can't help but have Daikokuya in my mind when I think of ramen. Ambiance- Super casual and busy. Prepare to have a long wait especially at night.. heck.. basically all day! LOL! I usually get the standard Daikokuya ramen which consists of pork broth, ramen, green onions, red picked radish, and egg. My favorite part of the ramen is the broth which is ridiculously tasty, not too salty which I like but still have a lot of in depth flavor in its broth. Something about daikokuya ramen that I enjoy is how the ramen tastes really homey.. AND the egg is also my second favorite part of the ramen. I don't know how they cook it.. what they do with it.. but whatever they are doing to make the marinated egg come out soft inside, almost runny but not runny yet.. they are certainly doing it right! Pork fried rice- I hear they use pork fat to make this fried rice which is why it is so freakin delicious!! So, just an FYI if you are counting your calorie.

Dikokuya is very inconsistent! It's probably been 9 months since I've been here since the lines are so long. I used to frequent this place so much that I didn't mind waiting an hour sometimes. I could tell the difference in the food from years ago and now. Came here for dinner the other day and ordered a bento box with chicken teri, spicy tuna roll, and tempura.  The chicken was extra crispy as I ordered but the sauce was watered down. Spicy tuna wasn't very spicey. Tempura batter was almost like onion ring batter with a run down dipping sauce. Tempura dipping sauce looked like it was literally mixed with water looking almost like lager beer. Service is always good here and friendly, but the food quality has gone down. Sorry, not coming back here for a while unless food gets better! I'd rather go elsewhere. Disappointing!

I am a die hard ramen fan... And from what I hear, LA is the next best place to get ramen after Japan... First time I came here, it was a hot, humid summer day and the line was out the door... Second time was for dinner and it was freezing... Third time, I am officially convinced that the ramen is legit. The broth is very flavorful and the noodles are pretty good (I will admit that I PERSONALLY prefer the Shin-sen-gumi noodles) and they give a good amount of "other stuff," too. The wait can be really annoying... Especially when the weather is extreme (as it was in my first two trips here)... The staff are fine and the food comes out fast. Ramen is suppose to be cheap and this place is (relatively). I look forward to another trip to this spot next time I'm in LA.

"I'll take extra back fat with that please." Ramen was good. The noodles are cooked perfect, more on the aldente side like I prefer and the broth was full and hardy. I think the kotteri really added the extra bunch and have been told by more frequent Daikokuian's that it definitely makes it taste better. BF got the combo of ramen and small rice bowl with shredded pork. How anyone could eat both is beyond me and we ended up taking the rice bowl to go. The shredded pork was really good, nicely seasoned and saucy. Overall, I liked the rice bowl better than the ramen. Would definitely go back for some more shredded pork over rice.

Come hungry, but factor in the 30-60 minute wait! And, they call each party by number, not by name. While you're waiting, draw some cash from an ATM, as it's cash only!   Your Daikoku ramen will come in a huge steamy bowl with perfectly cooked al dente noodles, boiled egg soaked in sauce, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, and pork slices- simple, delicious, and so hearty. Mmmm Cons: - small, stuffy space; if you're a party of 2, expect to sit by the counter - street parking If you haven't eaten here, do so immediately!

Ohhhhh, how I miss you, Daikokuya.   I just moved back to Hawaii after 4 years in LA and I am JONESING for some Daikokuya right now.  I can't describe how satisfying it is to slurp down a bowl of this crack.  I ventured to Little Tokyo on countless occasions, at all times of the day, even through torrential LA rains just to sit at the counter and worship the black bowl.   The noodles are perfectly cooked, the broth is mind-blowing, the pork melts in your mouth, the egg blends into the soup, and the green onions and bean sprouts are plentiful.  Bonus points for the ikura/ramen combo for only $13 - my friend and I used to come here and split it for $8/person and get stuffed. Sigh....

Despite many of my LA Yelp buddies frequenting Little Tokyo, I haven't visited this vicinity since, hmm, 2009, when I went with a few friends rapturing for the incipient of the food truck trend: the Kogi truck.  But over 2 years have past, and Daniel L & I had a perfect chance to give ourselves a Little Tokyo tour, on one Sunday late morning. We both agreed to gulp on 2900-reviewed Daikokuya, which would be open at 11am.  We curiously saw its establishment with an empty sidewalk (obviously except for us 2) about half an hour before opening time.  Nevertheless we safely walked away for a little more touring, but, a little more than 5 minutes right before returning, there were about 15 famished customers already lined up.  Luckily we nabbed the "bar" seating, and b/c DL warned how gigantic & filling BOTH the ramen & sides are, we each got the Daikoku Ramen ($8.50 if ramen alone), where I got the Kotteri-style & he got the default, while we shared the small Teriyaki Eel Bowl & Salad--together as part of the combo price at $15.95. Let me 1st happily report that those 2 sides tasted shockingly celestial.  The creamy dressing deluging over the crisp, coleslaw-looking salad had this outstanding, sesame-y zing, making me reminisce of another version at this HITW restaurant in old Downtown Covina where it's been over 3.5 years since last visit.  As of that Sunday that Eel Bowl was the freshest, meatiest, yummiest, & most buttery-ish fatty eel I've EVER felt & ingested (=^.^= ohh); and yes, it's the priciest of the sides, but specifically for eel-eating virgins I think it's worth taking the risk xD. Finally, maybe b/c I expected Nothing from the ramen, but I was cuckoo for that gargantuan Daikoku--well, particularly for my Kotteri :P.  The broth was over-lukewarm, sinfully enriched w/ the creamy, decadent pork fat particularly for the tonkotsu lovers.  Unfortunately the $8.50 bowl was YIKES! much bigger than my head in a 5-foot figure that I could only finish 80% of the al dente egg noodles, but I took the effort to inhale the tantalizing hard-boiled egg, scallions, bamboo shoots, sprouts & 2 long pieces of silky, saliva-inducing Pork Belly...PORK BELLY, if you skimmed the paragraph :P!  In comparison to DL's, though, the non-Kotteri default was still delicious, only not as full-bodied yet it has less calories x]. Hmmm, from all the ramen-slurping so far, I'm gonna have to equate THIS Daikokuya like my love of Santouka's Shio Ramen.  I didn't mind the wait at all and service was right on the satisfactory mark for an unsurprisingly busy joint, which is why I can quite smugly give this worth-the-wait, Little Tokyo requisite Woohoo stars =).  Oh, and be sure you have at least a raw $20 bill ready, or you're forced to w/draw one at those shady "privately operated" ATM machines (No, didn't happen to us =]).

The last time I was there, the Gyoza was not cooked. The meat was still pink! I only took a bite and had to return it.  Did I re-order? No! I don't know,,,,,, This place has changed.

For a car-less college student who has frequent cravings for ramen, Daikokuya is my choice of poison! A small location on the central strip of Little Tokyo, with its bright yellow banner and its incessant long line of hungry people, it is hard to miss. The Daikoku ramen, the only choice available, is the only item you would want to get -- with its generous hearty servings of ramen, pork and soup, Daikokuya is a great spot to be at for any rainy day. The beauty and arguably, the secret to the establishment's success, is the magical concoction of overnight boiled pork bones and joints - the basis of the delicious soup. The blending of the soup with the generously packed content - the egg noodles, pork slices, soft-boiled egg, bamboo shoots and garnishes of spring onion makes every slurp a satisfying experience - the ramen is perfect every time. Hope you enjoy this place as much as I have :)

FINALLY made time to come here this past wkend on our SoCal visit. Pretty worth it :) I was a tiny bit disappointed about their Ramen. It wasnt the best I've ever had. The noodles were a little on the harder side and the broth was so thick, I couldn't see what was underneath it. The broth was also not as flavorful as I expected. I added a bunch of spicy pepper and it was the first time I had to add soy sauce in my ramen. It also had a tad too much green onions and bean sprouts. 3 stars for the Ramen. I upped it 1 star for their fried rice. I was told it was BOMB, so even though I KNEW I couldn't finish everything, I opted for the fried rice (they have a bunch of rice combinations). TOTALLY WORTH IT! Where should I begin with the fried rice ... it had the right amount of saltiness, it was soft, it was juicy, it was moist and had shrimp and chicken in it. My stomach was hurting from how full I was, but I still managed to finish half the plate (yeah I was a fatty and my diet went out the door), but it was totally worth it. I wish I was hungry enough to finish everything. We also didnt have to wait too long for our food. + points because we waited 40 minutes to get seated on a Sunday at noon.

The emperor has no clothes!  And his, er, bacon is all flabby. Did I miss something?  I ordered the Ramen, wait, I mean THE RAMEN, expecting fucking transcendence.  Given all the hype, I figured this bowl of noodles would come out from the kitchen riding a Bengal tiger, teach me how to read kanji, tell me it loved me and then promise to call in the morning. Instead, it was fatty, flaccid and - aside from the salt - kinda flavorless.  And trust, after having waited an hour, I would've happily eaten most anything, and enjoyed it.  But not this ramen.  Oof.

There are three things that I look for in the restaurants that i go to- service, cleanliness, and of course, food. Service: the first time i went here, the cashier working at the time (not asian, woman) gave us so much attitude, so it gave me a bad impression off the bat. I've gone there again since that first time and the other cashiers are okay, but the first girl was just annoying and seemed to really hate her job, lol. Cleanliness: its in a food court so the place is nice and clean. As for the actual eating area, its pretty clean too, nothing special. Food: like almost everyone else, i got their ramen and i lovee the soup! Its not that hot though, but they heat it up for you if you ask them. Also i think i got their teriyaki chicken which wasn't dry or too salty.

Let's talk about hype. I have been going here for more than 10 yrs n now I don't go here any more. Y? Not worth waiting an hr. The line is just too krazy. It used to b a lot calmer n the quality of food was better I think. Now? Hyped up by yelpers n all the line of ppl waiting outside makes ppl to come here more n more somehow. I went back recently cuz my friend was just dying to try their ramen excited by none other than yelp reviews so I had to go. The food is still ok not great. still have same menu with one ramen. The broth got even fattier now tho. For the price maybe once in a while is possible. But with the wait? Never. I rather drive 30 min down to torrance to have santouka ramen. Its cheaper n better

Had to try the ramen considering how it is highly douted. Went for the Kotteri; figure what the heck, fat=flavor right? Yeah, the broth was indeed flavorful. Wish they had let the ramen noodles actually soak in this broth for a few hours to get that flavor into the noodles; the ramen was just meh in terms of flavor by itself. Very skippy with the roast pork in my bowl, like 2-3 small slivers of it, that's it! Hmmm .... Fried rice was tasty even though it's a bit wetter than other Japanese fried rice I've had which is drier. Gyozas were different, came very seared on one side, all six or so connected together, and if you like you gyozas really filled with meat that has a really mushy consistency, you'll love these home made ones. Spicy tuna roll - ok, it's the mushed up kind which is found often as opposed to cut up pieces of sashimi that has been mixed in a spicy sauce then put into a roll. After the "scrape" stories, eating mushed up tuna always makes you wonder. Hmmmm... Yup, long wait (about half an hour) for a booth for three at around 5:30pm on a Friday when we put our name down. Service was very good, no complaints. So the ramen was not up to the standards set by the OLD, JAPANESE OWNED Sapporo Ya in San Francisco's Japantown where they make their own noodles in house, (DO NOT GO THERE NOW. Different owner, now they suck!) Daikokuya is nice and you should try this place. Worth the long wait in line? Decide for yourself.

Came here twice so far and determined this place to be mediocre.  I ordered the Daikoku both times; added extra garlic paste (condiments provided on the table) to add a bit more zest to the broth.  Next time I'll probably step outside the box and try something new. The ramen is tender and soft; definitely tastes authentic. The broth is very flavorful and a bit salty - just how I like it. There was a boiled egg in my noodle, but it was cold when I bit into it; not too fond of cold eggs in my noodles! There was a couple slices of cha-siew & eh, they weren't that great.  They were a bit chewy and bland. There was a 35 minute wait during my first visit, but during my second visit we got seated in less than 5 minutes.   This place is small with a seating capacity of around 20 persons.  Service is great; our noodles came out promptly and our waitress came around often to refill our drinks. I would recommend others to try this place out if you're in the mood for noodles!

This is the best Japanese ramen place ever!! I've been dying to try this place for a really long time now. The problems with this place are:  long wait, street parking only, and small tables. But I came here on a Sunday morning, got free street parking right in front of the restaurant, after I did my shopping in the Japanese village plaza. Perfect! I only waited about 5 min for a seat. Ordered the Daikokuya ramen with a pork katsu bowl combo. It came with a salad (shredded cabbage) with a tasty dressing. The bowl of ramen was HUGE! I got it kotteri flavored (very rich!) and tasty! The broth is amazing!! The ramen came with a hardboiled egg, slices of pork, green onions, bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, and lots of noodles. And the pork katsu bowl was okay.. the katsu was a little chewy.. will probably get the shredded pork bowl next time. Totally worth $13. You get a lot of food! Took my ramen and pork katsu to go. Service is good too. Will definitely come back again! :) FYI: cash only, and no to-go orders

I came here on a sunday evening with some friends and, as expected, the place was jammed packed.  The restaurant itself is quite small, which surprised me being as how famous the establishment is.  Expect there to be a line of patrons in front of you when you get there.  Still, with eight groups before us we still managed to get seated about 20 minutes later... impressive.   The menu is fairly basic -- there's only one type of ramen, which can be customized to your liking.  In reality the only options you have are whether or not to have the ramen hot, cold, or with the broth separated.   You also have the choice of having it "kotterri" style, by which the fat is left in the broth.  This isn't really an option though .. you'd be stupid if you don't eat it this way.  I recommend ordering a side bowl as well, as it only costs a few dollars extra and complements the ramen nicely.  For some reason the bowl comes out before the ramen so you may choose to have it as an appetizer instead.   The ramen itself was excellent.  The broth tasted as though it was made from scratch and wasn't too heavy.  The noodles were a tad undercooked, but it was a negligible issue.  Overall, excellent ramen for the price.  Would come here again.

Best place for Japanese ramen.  We used to eat here all the time when we lived in LA.  Parking is horrible, so it's easier to just park the the parking structure across the street than trying to find meter parking.  FYI, it was Cash Only the last time I went.  They used to take credit cards, but I guess not anymore.  This place has the best ramen and teriyaki chicken rice bowl.  You won't be disappointed.

The restaurant is small but has the original Japanese vibe to it, and the service is friendly.  Price is fair. We ordered the ramen soup combo with chicken egg rice, and also the dry ramen.  Very good ramen soup base and noodle very tasty.  Rice dish also good. Cons: - the long wait - only street parking - no to-go orders - cash only - only certain seats in the restaurant can use high chair, otherwise you can only use booster seat.

First, I just want to say that this place kills it on green onions.  I mean total green onion overload.  Since I like them, it was a good thing for me, but I didn't expect everything that we ordered - two appetizers and our ramen bowls - to come with a veritable mountain of bright green onions on top.  Although, it did make the presentation quite pleasant. Second, since this place is so highly rated, I must have ordered the wrong ramen bowl because the broth I got was weak!  The ingredients (noodles, pork, egg, etc.) were fine.  But the broth was lacking depth and mouthwatering savoriness.  I think the broth is the most important part.  When I eat pho or ramen or any kind of soup, I want the broth to be so good, that I have to drink the last drop. On a positive note, the service was good, and the appetizers were yummy.  Also, there was no wait to be seated because we arrived shortly after the lunch rush.

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE. And I am so NOT even a Ramen person. I always get cravings for it since Ramen spots in San Diego suck and this is all the way in LA. The line is crazy, seriously crazy. I've been here 3 or 4 times already and 2 of those times it was POURING rain and there was a line out the door for an hour's worth of a wait. And the other time was in the DESSERT HEAT. I'm talking like high 90's heat and there was a crazy line. But it's allll well worth it when you get inside. The ramen is seasoned perfectly (which probably means its infused with a gallon's worth of salt). But noodles, egg, meat, green onions, broth, everything came together to make this HEAVENLY dish. I always get the special combo so i can get a side of either their EEL BOWL or FRIED RICE. I am in LOVE with both so usually if I go here with at least 3 people, I order the combo with the eel bowl and get a separate order of fried rice to share. MmmMmm I'm seriously craving and salivating as I'm typing this right now. Ugggh.. Anyway, I was happy to find out that they have other locations. And since I have friends that I visit in the Chino area, I usually ask to hit up the other spots. Though i think this is still the best location, the others pretty much temporarily covers the craving. mmmmMmmMm.,.. Dang It San Diego... can't you get some good Ramen spots. -_-

Daikokuya has become one of the places I MUST go to when in LA. I always order the Daikokuya ramen + Tonkatsu (pork cutlet) combination, $11.95.   You can view the full menu here: http://www.daikoku-ten.c… The ramen broth is tasty but a little oily.  For me, the broth is secondary (probably because I'm not so much a fan of all the pork fat), and not the best I've had. What stands out to me are the perfectly cooked chewy egg noodles, the fresh bamboo shoots & bean sprouts, and the kurobuta pork belly chasu. Oh! And the green onions....I love the abundance of green onions. Get a little of everything in one bite and MMM just enjoy! http://www.yelp.com/biz_… The Tonkatsu donburi.....they really hit the correct flavors in this dish. Tender pork, eggs, onions, and the perfect balance of shoyu/mirin/sake sauce on the rice = TONKATSU DON HEAVEN! Don't even ask me for a bite, cause I ain't sharing!   http://www.yelp.com/biz_… The price is well worth it considering the amount of food you get. I'm a big eater, and a combo would've been enough to share between 2 people....not that I would have shared the tonkatsu, but just saying. I normally finish the ramen and save most of the tonkatsu bowl for later. Service is 5 stars all the way! I'm amazed that they're able to get the food out so quickly, then come around to check on you, fill waters, and bring take-out containers....mind you, this is with every single table and chair occupied; though I guess this is the norm for them. SUGOI. Quick, courteous, and I just love hearing all the workers converse in Japanese! Minor negatives: cash only and metered street parking (~$2/hour).  Also, the restaurant has a "B" rating, so FYI for those who are germ-phobic. Obviously this place is ridiculously popular.  TIP: Arrive right before they open and you won't have to wait!

PROs: Very large bowl of Tonkotsu Ramen Gyoza and Sausage are very very good Inexpensive in comparison to other ramen shops Vintage/Traditional Japanese atmosphere/interior Japanese Comic books Open Late CONs: 20 to 50 minute wait depending on the night, not worth it sometimes. You are vegetarian or vegan or don't eat pork, etc. Original Flavor has been mitigated over the years Japanese Comic books need to be updated tips: arrive early to sign in your name/ go shopping or come back in the mean time,

I've found it!  The BEST RAMEN in the States. The toppings, great quality (especially the delicious kurobuta pork belly chashu) but totally unnecessary.  Even the outstanding noodles with their delicate saltiness and perfect texture (they actually ask you how you want the noodles cooked) play second fiddle to the INCREDIBLE tonkotsu broth.  Talk about deeply concentrated porky goodness thickened by its own gelatin.  I could seriously drink this out of coffee cup and be happy. Don't even get me started on the kotteri broth.  It is even more heavily concentrated and made creamy by the incorporation of pork fat.  Incredible. Now what am I going to do that my quest is complete?  Oh wait, there more types of ramen than tonkotsu.  Eat on!

Occasion: Late night dinner with LACI junior friends (Sid, Steph, Bronson, Tyler) during freshman year What I Had:  Daikoku Ramen ($8.50) Food Review: The tonkotsu soup base is to die for. Once you mix the egg yolk in, it has an almost creamy nature about it that is both salty and slightly sweet at the same time. The chijire noodles are amazing as well. I like them because their texture is unlike instant ramen noodles where if you undercook it, it's stiff and if you overcook it, it's mushy. These noodles were somehow soft but slightly chewy! LOVE IT. The soup also includes pork belly chasu, marinated boiled egg, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, green onion, and a dash of sesame seeds. This place definitely trumps the most popular ramen places I've been to in the South Bay. For example, Orenchi Ramen in Santa Clara is the undisputed most popular ramen place in the South Bay. I didn't like their ramen as much mostly because the noodles were undercooked and they had way too much mushroom in the soup base. Los Angeles Little Tokyo ramen wins. Service Review: Nothing in particular about the service. Our wait was a little on the longer side because we had a larger group, but they managed to seat us at a booth within an hour and the food was well worth it. Venue Review: The restaurant is pretty small. They have a bar to the right, and some booths on the left-hand side. Parking wasn't too difficult because we parked in the grocery store parking lot across the street by Yogurtland. Overall Impression: LOVE THIS PLACE. I need to try what else is on their menu, but their ramen is #1 in my book.

what can i say that hasnt been said? im no ramen connoisseur, but this was a mighty tasty bowl of ramen. u can get the ramen + rice combo. I got the ramen + katsu, my friend got the ramen + fried rice. yes..fried rice. and OMG it is so good. so flavorful, hot, fresh, filling. the ramen was delicious, savory. the katsu was kinda soggy? i would stick with the fried rice. it seems like there is a disparity in the amount of pork belly you get. my friend got hardly any, i got quite a few? but she got the kotteri flavor..maybe that has something to do with pork allowance? (like i said...im no ramen connoisseur...:P) go early! they open at 11, and we got there a little before 11 and there was already a long line. luckily we got in and sat at the bar. parking may be hard. there is a shopping mall a few blocks away (search for Beard papa's) and they have free 2 hour parking if u buy something in one of their stores and get the ticket validated. :P 2 hours is perfect for getting in at 11am, eating, walking through the streets, stopping by the delicious ice cream/mochi place for dessert, and leisurely walking back to your car for the rest of the day's adventures!

Waited for 45 minutes on a Sunday afternoon. Place is good, ramen had a really rich broth. Especially since I ordered it with kittori (extra layer of fat). Soft boiled egg, perfection! Gyozas were perfectly cooked and juicy, the fried rice is seriously top notch, also order the combos. It's like 12 bucks but they give you really good rice bowls along with your ramen. I got the chicken egg bowl where it was chicken with an egg mixed into the rice along with broth.

For all the hype, Daikokuya failed to impress me. When I first had ramen in Tokyo, I had this OMG feeling because it was simply too good. Now I've been searching for that same feeling and this place just doesn't bring it. Arrived at 11:15am on a Saturday and it was already full. The first wave arrives at 11am (opening time), so no one will really leave until 1140am. Like most people, I tried the Daikokuya Ramen. First, the broth is tasty. Flavorful, not too hot, delightful to my tongue. Second, the noodles aren't flimsy like instant noodles, yet the texture is thicker while staying chewy. Thirdly, the pork is nearly tasteless. I did eat lots of marinated meat the night before, but the pork was just very unsatisfying and slightly too tough. Lastly, the boiled egg. The egg was COLD in the middle. They must have just pre-boiled it and threw it into the broth, hoping it would warm up before I ate it. Leaving around 1230, there was quite a crowd waiting outside, but I knew my journey for awesome ramen would continue without this place.

Alright..their original ramen is pretty good and pretty famous. But wait until you try the ********************KICHI-MEN*******************!!­!!!! My mouth is salivating as I type. This ramen is not even on their menu. Occasionally you will see it posted up on the walls. It's a spicy & sour version of their original soup base. However, the noodles for this ramen is cooled down and separated from the soup. Also served separately are the toppings: fatty pork, green onions, soft boiled egg, & bamboo shoots. I'm in ramen heaven. So there I am, staring at a tray of ramen galore. Where to start? What to do?! Just take a sip of the broth and let the tart spicyness tickle the toungue. Then twirl some ramen noodles up and strategically dip it into the soup with the chopsticks and spoon. After some more experimenting with the other toppings in the same technique, toss all the toppings into the soup. It'll almost taste like a milder version of tom yum soup. Ahhhhh...after all that is washed into the tummy, notice that the pork fried rice that came with the combo has been left untouched. Pack that up and we've got lunch for work tomorrow. Zing!

Every time that I pass by this place, it has a crowd of people waiting to get in.   Now I know why.  I lucked out, late night on a Tuesday...... No Line!! I sat at the end of the counter, and was able to watch the cooks, prepare the meals. My ramen, was great, the broth was flavorful, and had body.  It was so delicious and filling that I couldn't finish my bowl :( I will go again, and again, and again....

4.5 STARS FINALLY...after months to years of listening to people rave on and on about Daikokuya, we have met! My friends and I came here for a late lunch and we waited about twenty minutes for a table. They actually did not have a table large enough to fit our party of six, but they made it work anyway by adding two stools to the end of a four-seater booth. It was a little crammed, but it was a fun experience nonetheless! We each ordered the Daikoku Raumen Special (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) with extra back fat, which included ramen noodles, boiled egg, bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, and green onions. The ramen noodles had the perfect springy and chewy consistency, which is exactly how I like my ramen. The broth was very hearty and delicious too! The absolute best part of the steaming bowl of ramen though, was the translucent bits of back fat in the broth. It really added another dimension of flavor to the broth--YUM! Our meal would not have been complete without the fried rice (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…). I never thought I would say this, but the fried rice was amazing and it really lived up to all the hype. The large pieces of authentic cha siu and fresh ingredients made it worth the try and I think the addition of pork fat is what makes the rice so moist. Our tab averaged to about $19/person including tip, which included six bowls of ramen, fried rice, a small rice and salmon roe, and two pitchers of Sapporo beer. That's a mighty steal if you ask me!

Dear Daikokuya, This isn't a review, it's more of a love letter expressing my feelings about my love for first and foremost, your ramen, the tender pieces of pork, egg noodles cooked to perfection, the right amount of seasonings and a yummy soft boiled egg. Even if it's the only ramen style on the menu, it's the only one you need. All your dishes from the melt-in-your-mouth Unagi Bowl to the ever so filling and delicious Shredded Pork Bowl compliment the ramen delightfully. Your gyoza is so fresh and so crispy and your fried rice is a perfect addition to your ramen, just dip a spoonful in the 24-hour simmered pork broth and you'll be finding yourself in bliss. When I'm feeling extra fatty, the Kotteri style broth (with extra pork fat) does the job tenfold. Even your California roll, which is something I wouldn't normally get at a ramen shop, is delicious and different with it's own flavor. I've been visiting you time after time and the service is consistenly speedy, friendly, and well worth the hour and a half wait (but the best time to visit is during the weekday after the lunch rush and before the dinner rush, so one can fully appreciate and savor everything). Just like the ramen shops I've visited in Japan, your nostalgic Japanese movie posters, ramen bar, small toys littered along the entrance, old school J-pop and manga shelf let me enjoy my ramen as if I wasn't even in downtown Los Angeles. So here's to you, Daikokuya, for making one of the best ramen bowls I've had to date and I'm here to let you know that I will still be visiting you often, way more often than not. When it's hot, cold, rainy, whatever, there's always a place in my heart, and always time for you. Love, Stef :)

Short review: Go when they FIRST open.  And I don't mean like 15 min after they open.  I mean like when they FIRST open!  We got there 15 min after they opened and guess what?  We had to wait 20 minutes. Not bad of a wait considering most people have waited for over 1 1/2 hours on weekend nights.    Good ramen.  You either love it or hate it.  Too bad they don't have spicy miso.   Don't make me say I told you so!  GO EARLY!!!  Not worth waiting for over 30 minutes.  After all, it's just ramen.  Unless you're a Daikokuya virgin.  =)

Ah yum ... Just thinking of the ramen I had here makes me want to road trip it down to la! This is one of the best ramen places I've been to in the states. The soup is rich and full of flavor (although probably not good if you're a calorie counter) and delicious !!! The noodles are chewy and not too fat, just the way I like it. I also got a katsudon and it was crispy to perfection. The bad ... The wait ! I waited almost 2 hours on a Thursday night... But so worth it !

Daikokuya is awesome! There's no going wrong with these guys. Daikoku Ramen, Shredded Pork Bowl, Teriaki Eel Bowl, or any of the combinations are just perfect blends of great flavor, and flawless execution. Prices are very reasonable, staff is friendly and the restaurant is clean. Be aware there's always a long wait any day, any time. So I suggest you to come in, write your name on the board, go next door for drinks, and check back in every 10/20 minutes.

The guy who calls the names and keeps track of the list skipped 2 parties, including us to seat 2 girls who just came in and were clearly last on the list.

First time trying real authentic ramen. We went on a Tuesday around 1. It was full  but a couple left right as we got there so we did not have to wait which was nice because I read the reviews on how wait time could be up to 1.5 hours. We were brought a very yummy bowl of salad as soon as we sat down. It had some sort of mayo sauce on it and it was shredded cabbage. So good. I ordered the kotteri soup (which is the pork fat added) ramen and a side of fried rice (this was the combo) and my boyfriend had the same but with a side of the pork chop rice. The fried rice was really good and the pork chop was alright. The ramen broth was pretty good although next time I want to try it without the pork fat. The noodles were delicious and I loved the egg! It was runny on the inside but looked like a hard boiled egg. The meat was also cooked perfectly. Not dry at all. This is a lot of food! I was so stuffed we had to take the side dishes to go. And this is saying a lot because I eat A LOT. I would definitely come here again for a ramen craving! Wish Seattle had this!

Of course I'd find out about a location closer to me after already waiting half an hour to be seated O_o The ramen was good, but not amazing. The broth had a strong roasted taste to it, which I liked. I wish it was less creamy though. I ended up adding a bunch of soy sauce which made it slightly better and keep me eating (otherwise, I probably would have felt too bloated and gotten "over it" sooner). The finely chopped green onion didn't add too much extra flavor and I found them more decorative than anything else. For around $8 though, the portions were pretty generous. Neither my +1 and I were able to finish our bowls... No complaints about the gyoza; it definitely satisfied my craving! To me, Daikokuya is good, but really isn't that special to justify such a long wait and commute from an out-of-towner like myself!

One would think that eating at Daikokuya with a numb right cheek (after getting fillings), with a sick Chris K. (with messed up taste buds) would be a horrible combination, but two hot bowls of Daikoku Ramen was just what we both needed on a chilly Saturday night. Although we weren't thrilled about our 1 1/2 hour wait, we weren't in a hurry, so we did not mind the wait too much. While waiting, we went on an adventure across the street to acquire some CA$H moneys. (CA$H ONLY!!) We also witnessed a party of 7 being crammed into a 4 person booth.... that was entertaining, but also a learning: this location does not accommodate well to parties larger than 4. Once we were seated at the bar, our bowls of ramen came out practically 2 minutes after we ordered. I thought the broth was already really rich, but I obviously missed the memo to order the kotteri broth... I can only imagine how much more flavor the broth can pack in. I loved that the broth stayed hot the entire duration of our meal. We ordered the regular size, but I was already stuffed before I finished draining the soup from my bowl. The bf surrendered to a bit of leftover soup and noodles. Despite how packed the restaurant stayed (we ate from 10 - 11 pm), the waiter checked up on us at least 3 or 4 times to see how we were doing. I was pleasantly surprised to have even received service from such a busy place! Once Chris K. has fully regained his sense of taste, (my right jaw is now recovered :) ) we will return to Little Tokyo on one of our free days for some kotteri ramen.

Try going here during not-so-busy hours...I've been here a lot, and, 9 times out of 10, I've had to wait in line for at least an hour, sometimes two. Also, the parking around the area is not the best. Is this place worth the wait and trouble? Yes. Does the food here live up to its hype? Absolutely. As there are 129038129038129038129038901 other reviews that can attest to Daikokuya's greatness, I will write only what I usually order: Combo (Ramen + Ikura/Salmon roe over rice bowl) IN ADDITION TO (being the fatass that I am) a side of deep fried spicy tuna (wrapped in shiso leaves!!! mmmm!!!) I can finish this all by myself, but be warned that this dish can fill the bellies of two or adequately satisfy three. The bill usually comes out to $20-ish with tax and tip. Worth every penny!!! Oh, and their cabbage salad (comes out free)...these guys will NOT disclose what goes in their dressing, but, laced with coke or not idgaf, the salad here is the shit.

Took my family here for dinner on a Sunday night and the line was ridiculous like always...I wanted to see what was so amazing about this ramen place. We waited 1.5 hours for ramen...And, they had to stuff 5 people into a booth so it was crammed. The servers are friendly but very rushed with you (because of the long wait). Their fried rice is indeed pretty good because of the chunks of pork. The Daikokuya ramen is really good - The soup is so tasty and it's a bonus that they are extra generous in green onions because I LOVE green onions! Egg was ok runny inside - I've had better runny eggs but this was alright. Either way, the broth was amazing - Even my mom and dad are craving to go back. I just wish the wait wasn't so long...

Big bowl of deliciousness?  YUP, I'd say so. On the random rainy day we had in SoCal a couple weeks back, my friends and I ventured into Little Tokyo to get a large bowl of ramen soup that hit the spot more than anything else could that day.  Not thinking, we arrived near the peak of the lunch rush, so there were quite a few people ahead of us, therefore, quite a bit of a wait.  The savory aroma of the place told me to be patient, and wait for my soup. Once seated and we got our food, I was glad I waited.  This large bowl of ramen soup had a great pork broth that I would have enjoyed even by itself.  I could probably even do without the pork meat as well!  Loved the ramen noodles, and the hard boiled egg contributed an extra flavor to the already great combo of tastes I was already experiencing with the broth and noodles. There is just the one size, large.  I could probably get away with eating only half of it and being quite satisfied.  I ate about three-fourths of the bowl and was almost too full to function.  Packed up what I had left and enjoyed it for breakfast the following day. I also tried the gyoza.  Good appetizer, and glad I tried it.  However, also looking forward to the other things they have on their menu for next time.

So I finally got to eat here, after wanting to eat here for the past 3 months!  Soooo excited, and the wait wasn't even that long on a Thursday night.  My sister and I got seated after a 20 min, which isn't bad at all for daikokuya, at least from what I've heard from other people.  We were also lucky and got a booth, instead of sitting at the bar. Service was fast and came over right away to ask our drinks, we also ordered.  We both got the Daikokuya ramen, which came out pretty fast.  Probably about 5 min after we ordered!  This has to be the BEST ramen I've ever had!  sooooo effing good!  The soup is perfect, not too salty or rich, and it has the perfect amount of green onion and bean sprouts (some places overload on the bean sprouts, which I hate). Overall super good!  I want to go back!  I want to try their other dishes as well or the cold version of the ramen.

My cousin and his fiancée brought us to this place during our last visit to LA.  They kept insisting it was a MUST for us to try.  Then he said we had to wake up early to make it there by 10am on a Saturday and there would probably be a wait.  WTF?!  I wasn't sure if I wanted to go through all that trouble to drive from the valley through insane LA traffic to downtown LA just for ramen.  I could freakin' get ramen here in San Francisco just 5 minutes from my place.  But he really wanted to take us there and he's got great taste in food so we obliged. So we go and it's this little restaurant and there's a freakin' line out the door.  Our wait time was an hour and a half!  Are you kidding me?!  At 11:00am -  Oh yeah - we didn't make it at 10am like planned thanks to the boozy suzies that drank until 6am. So we wait and I'm hoping that that the wait was worth it.  When we finally sat down we let our cousin and his fiancée order for us since it was our first time there.   He said that we HAD to have the Koteri style ramen.  "Sure thing, Pete.  Order me whatever." I say. The food comes out in this ginormous bowl. As soon it was placed in front of me, the aroma just took over.  My first spoonful of broth - it was like fireworks in my mouth and choirs of angels singing around me.  BEST. FREAKIN'. RAMEN BROTH.  EVER.  It even made a non-lover of ramen, my sister, into a BELIEVER!!!!!!!  And she dreams about it ever since we've had it. So we ended up going one more time before leaving LA.  We just had to squeeze another visit to his place in our plans.  We liked it so much that we ate there at 10pm on the night we were supposed to leave to drive back to SF.  We didn't finish until 11:30pm and didn't get back to SF until 6:00am the next day and then we had to all go back to work the same morning.  Was it worth it??? -  Abso-flippin'-lutely!!!!!!!!! Was the hour and a half wait worth it?  YES!  Was the zombie-like state that I was in when I returned to work worth it? YES! Was using our car to play Super Mario Kart  through horrific LA traffic to get to this place worth it?  YES!   I can't wait for my next trip to LA just to have another bowl of ramen from this place. If anyone out there knows of a ramen place here in the Bay Area that has ramen comparable to that of Daikokuya  - PUHLEASE --- let me know!

Last time we were here was "6/21/2007". Since there I never had the desire to visit this place. Last night we did cos we were in the neighborhood. Brought some friends here as well. Oh my...such horrible ramen. The broth is so blend, the pork slices were dry and hard. Had the pork cutlet combo too. Where are the flavors??? What happened to you Daikokuya? Opened too many locations and quality goes down? Not returning ever. Stupid me.

Ramen, my cure-all, almost-any-time-is-a-good-time, comfort food.  It was nice and brisk this past Saturday evening and after waiting 30 minutes during dinner time, I was greeted by a bowl of hot, steaming ramen bigger than the size of my head.  Daikokuya ramen kotteri style was a perfect choice.  The broth was savory but not too heavy, the noodles were cooked to a perfect al dente and they threw in an entire hard boiled egg with a soft yolk....mmmmmm.   As hungry as we were, it probably wasn't a wise choice to go with the combination meals as a giant bowl of ramen and a small rice bowl is just one carbo-load bowl too many. Overall, I'd rank Daikokuya second behind Santouka as a ramen go-to spot.  Quick service and affordable good eats.

This place is one of the few places that I'll wait in line to eat at. You will wait for 30 mins to an hour or more.. (Lunch & Dinner) The line is like "Pinks" on La Brea. If you see it short get in line. The noodles are very good, big portion, great flavor.  The best deal is their combo. Where you get the Ramen Noodles and side dish. The Eel is really good. You can get in faster if your party is 2 or 3 people. More people the longer the wait. They don't take orders to go. You will have to go there to eat.

3000+ reviews??  IT's gotta be amazing....NOT And its HARDLY worth the 3 hr wait that's imposed on this location.  You silly LA folks....or is it silly out of town folks like me who fall victim to the outrageous hype?  Either way, let's get down to it! After putting our name down and going back to the hotel to chill for an hour, we still had to come back out and wait 2 hours in line people watching and seeing the crowds silent as the server came out to call names.  With high anticipation, we eagerly waited.....and waited.........and waited. And when our table got called, it was as if we were called on to enter Willy Wonka's Factory in all its glory.   However, I ordered the combo with Ikura over Rice and the regular Ramen with Char Siu.  The Char Siu sucked.  I've had much better and enjoy the braised pork belly version much better.  It was dry and bland here.  The fried rice was also delicious.  Although the noodles were nice and chewy, the broth (a tonkatsu type) was also pretty good.  It was creamy and had a rich flavor that complimented the noodles well.  But to wait 3 hours for?  I've had the one in Garden Grove and it tasted good with the fried rice and all, and enjoyed that much more maybe because I didn't have to wait 3 hours.   But if I were to come back and realize the wait was so huge, I'd opt for something else.

2 of us went there last Sunday for lunch after the coffee roasting event@Demitasse and it was only a 20mins wait until we were seated at the bar. Ordered two bowls of the house ramen which comes with korobuta and it tasted just ok-maybe I'm just spoilt from living in SouthEastAsia for most of my life and having fantastic noodles. Also, had to ask for extra pork as there were just a few pieces in the dish - fortunately, we weren't billed for it! Also had the gyoza which was delicious although I can't imagine queueing up for 20mins just to have gyoza.

Should you give this place a try...DUH Is their tonkotsu broth one of the best in LA...DUH Should you get the ramen and fried rice combo...DUH Should you add an order of gyoza to your meal...DUH Will you leave with a full belly and big smile on you face...SUPER DUH is it worth an hour wait...not really BUT This place is MUST TRY for all you ramen lovers out there.  You truly cannot talk about ramen without at least throwing Daikokuya in the mix.  Their broth is awesome, their noodles are home made, and they make some bomb ass fried rice and gyoza. I wouldn't go so far as to say its the best (my heart belongs to Santouka) but this place is fucking delicious.  Love the combo meals and gyoza, and the fact that they're open late.  Yeah the wait sucks, but like I've said above the food is bonkers!!! #porkramenboner

compare to ALL the ramen places, THIS IS my FAVORITE one!! yes, it is super crowded.  yes, u MIGHT need to WAIT for a LONG time but....i STILL like it! ;p  IT'S WORTH the WAIT....^_^ the SECRET for the YUMMY ramen, as least for me, is to ADD the GARLIC in the ramen!!!!!!!!!!!! XD  WITHOUT it, this place's ramen is just TASTE the SAME like others, in my opinion. ;p my TIP for this place:   1.  GO EARLY BEFORE DINNING HOUR to AVOID the LONG waiting line.   for example, please go at 5pm or 8pm for Dinner. 2.  order the COMBO with ramen and fried rice...depends on the chef, the taste of the fried rice will be different...;p 3.  Gyoza are Japanese style dumplings and they are GREAT!! :) ok!!  have fun eating! ^_*

Thinking about this ramen is making my mouth water right now. For just $8.50 you can get their famous "Daikoku Ramen", which is the perfect blend of chashu pork, noodles marinated egg, bamboo shoots, green onions, bean sprouts all tossed together in their tonkotsu broth. In other words, it is perfection. This ramen place has to be the best ramen place I have ever been to, and I have been to quite a few. I have never had a broth that had so much flavor and was the right consistency. There have been quite a few ramen places I've been to where the broth was bland or too oily, killing the taste and experience for me. On top of the perfect flavor, they give you a very big serving guaranteed to fill you up. Tips: -For those of you who can't eat too much, you can order a small version of the Daikoku Ramen for half the price! -This ramen place is on the smaller side, so be sure you get there early if you decide to take a visit on a Friday or Saturday. It is guaranteed to be crowded once evening comes around.

Still my favorite Ramen house!!!  But I was a little disappointed with the service with this location.  Considering we came around 11pm on a thursday, this place filled with people.  So getting on the waiting list for 2 and knowing we needed cash, my buddy and I went across the street to go get cash.  While across the street, we heard one of the ladies yell my name.  We immediately walked back and no was at the hostess both.  Waited about 5 minutes and still no one came back.  Shortly the girl came back and I saw that next to my name the word "called" was written.  So I asked her you called my name, she looked at the board and she said yes and crossed out the word "called".  All she kept saying was "yah yah yah" and walked away.  Lost and confused I was at this point. We didn't get seated until 30 minutes later. So to sum up the experience, this place is small and they cannot accommodate large parties.  They only have one table that can accommodate max 6 people.  Second is that its cash only so have you cash beforehand or else your name might get called while you are away and the word "called" will get crossed out. But... I will go through that nonsense all over again if I have to so that I can get my daikokuya ramen fix!  Something about that soft boiled egg and that soup base that perfect bond of union in my mouth.  When you add all the fixins such as the ginger, garlic and chili oil, you have happiness in a form of a bowl full of soft ramen noodles and thin sliced fatty cha shu pork. I've been wanting to try this location for a long time now, but after trying the their ramen, there is definitely no difference with the hacienda heights location and I would rather go to that one due to its larger dining area and better service!

If you're looking for DELICIOUS and AUTHENTIC ramen...this is THE place!  I've been to many a ramen venue and this one takes the cake in my book.  The broth is amazing - with all those flavors and spices melding together so nicely, I can only imagine how long it takes some poor genius to get it all together!  The service is positively friendly, but be prepared for a wait - it's no secret to many that this is the place for ramen!

Super flavorful ramen! I got the daikoku ramen, which is their house special, and It was almost TOO flavorful for my taste. I kind of wished there were more veggies/toppings in the soup to balance it out. It did come with a perfectly done soft-boiled egg...delish! The shredded pork bowl was also very delicious. Unfortunately the ramen and the rice bowl were so huge that we couldn't finish all our food, but at least we were able to have leftovers for dinner.

I have no idea how I've missed writing a Yelp review for the most fab ramen in town until now.  I have certainly been here enough times. Yes, you have to wait a hour (or more if you need a booth).  But, the good news is there are dozens of shops and things to peruse around Little Tokyo, so you shouldn't have trouble killing time. To be fair... this is the only ramen restaurant I have ever been to, but it's so delicious that I simply cannot give my business to anyone else (in LA).  I drive from the west valley to go here, try to get a spot in the Office Depot lot (or drive around aimlessly forever), and then wait in line for an hour. It's that good. Why not 5 stars?  The wait, the parking.  Last time I was here it was cash only :(

I was recommended this place by someone who lived in L.A. I'm from Vancouver myself. This was literally the first place I dropped to eat since I was warned that it gets incredibly busy. I entered the restaurant at 11:30 and the place was already 3/4 full. The ramen is good, and probably in the top 3 ramen places I've been too. The soup base is creamy and a thicker broth, but not oily or fat. It's a flavourful broth, but in my opinion I find was too salty, but it wasn't overbearing. It took a while to adjust to the levels of saltiness which eventually became desensitized about 1/3 of the way eating. I know that on Average U.S flavours tend to be heavy on sodium as well. If you like green onions in your soup then you'll enjoy the ramen. They did a great job with their eggs and the ramen has a nice chewiness to it without being too soft. Since I was living in Little Tokyo for about 6 days I can tell you that this place is packed almost all the freaking time. I'm glad I went early or else I probably would have never tried it out.   At the end, would I go back? For sure, I would. Would I wait in line for an hour like most people. Unfortunately not unless a friend wanted to take me.

Oh how the mighty have fallen... PARKING: Street, or park in the Japanese Village parking lot for a flat rate. The meters on the street accept credit cards :) FOOD: I've been coming here since freshmen year, and I feel as though the quality has definitely suffered. I hate the idea of waiting 40+ minutes to be seated, just to give people my money, so I usually end up at Hsin Sen Gumi instead. Daikokuya's broth is super rich and indulgent, but I came here on Thursday afternoon, and the broth was a luke warm. Not even hot! I was so disappointed. They give a good portion size of pork, but you definitely have to go all out and order the combination with shredded pork bowl! That's where the money is :) The shredded pork bowl come with this amazing sauce and a nice helping of tender shredded pork. YUM! SERVICE: They forgot to give me and my friend soup spoons with our ramen.. :( Isn't that usually common sense? Also, I've ordered a diet coke here, and the can indicated that it was expired by MONTHS. Scary! Just A-OK. IMO, it's not worth the line.

After hearing all the hype, I finally got around to checking it out. My wife and kids thoroughly enjoyed the meal. This is what we ate: Daiko Ramen Pork Katsu Fried Rice Eel Bowl Overall Taste: Stinkin' Delicious but definitely on the saltier side. If the food were a couple of notches less salty, I would have given this a 5-star rating. The Wait Time: We were first in line. We went on Sunday at 10:47am. I heard we may have to get in line if we showed up this early. There was some bicycling event going on which deterred some folks from coming here. By 11:00am, there were about 10 people behind us line. By 11:05am, the restaurant was packed with a line of 15 outside. Friendliness of Staff: Our server could hardly speak English but he understood enough to take our order accurately while smiling a lot. Parking: I agree with some of the other people here that public parking in the structures is best. Looking for metered parking could put you back about 10-20 spots in line. Price: I think it's just fine where it is. I'm glad that someone did post that they take cash only. I made sure to go to the ATM prior to going. Individual Entrees: Daiko Ramen - I liked the noodles al dente like that. The broth was unbelievable. The spoon is definitely needed when eating these noodles. The sliced pork was oh so tender. Damn, I shouldn't have written this review 1 hour before lunch. I want some now. Pork Katsu - Totally unexpected that it was going to be this scrumptious! I was more than pleased by the tenderness of the pork. The batter didn't overwhelm the taste of the pork at all. And the egg on top ...... need I say more? Fried Rice - We got this just for the kids. It was okay. They ate some of it. They actually ended up eating a lot more of the ramen instead. Note to order 2 more bowls of ramen instead of fried rice next time. Eel Bowl - Nothing spectacular but it was good. Once again, ordered for the kids this time since my son usually loves eel.

Unfortunately the days of creamy pork broth are gone. Too many customers, never closing, and watered down soup broth have made this place very average now. Not even a scoop of msg can take the place of the original taste. Gone are the days of closing when the broth runs out..... I am sad to say that trying to serve so many people have lowered the quality of the once great ramen joint.

I made it! I have heard about this place for years and years but never had the chance to try due to 1) Distance 2) Long Wait 3) Mostly distance. Fate had it that I was in town for business and found out that Daikokuya was only 1.5 miles from me! After driving those the most ghetto parks of downtown LA (yap within that short 1.5 miles) I made it! On a Friday afternoon at closer to 2pm, we still waited close to 30 min. Insane! There were two dudes sitting in their white lamborghini literally next to the store, blasting their stereo (yes, we can see and hear you in your car) while waiting to be seated. That kept me entertained. The place is a bit old and grimy, but its downtown LA so it was ok. Parking is a pain (maybe weekends are better). The street parking is $2/hour and the lots nearby are $6. Add that to your bowl of noodle. We ordered their house ramen 8.95 (cheap!): -The bowl was large! A great deal at less thann 9 bucks a pop -The soup was less greasy than other places I've been too. I liked that. -The noodle is the normal ramen noodle. A bit chewy, tad bit on the hard side. -The meat was veery soft. I like that -The half cooked egg (one entire egg- not just half) was slightly cold in the middle. Overall, I would say compared to Ippudo its not as good. Compared to other ramen joints in So cal (ie: Shin Sen Gumi, Mitsuwa ramen places) its a bar up. I probably would not return (since its quite far for me) and parking is just a pain. One more ramen down-!

Alright, I know there are nearly 3,000 reviews, but I just had to mention an experience here that I have a feeling few others have had the opportunity to witness (or at least, it seems they aren't writing about it!). We ordered two bowls of kotteri ramen and were brought one kotteri and one regular. When we verified with the waitress, she said they could "fix" it. She walked away and returned holding a bowl about the size of a plastic rice bowl, filled to the brim with a thick white paste-like substance. Upon closer inspection, we realized this was a bowl of pure rendered pork fat! Those little floating globules of fattiness that make the broth here unlike any other. It was beautiful and spoke to my inner carnivore. I wish I had the foresight to take a photo of it. It just confirmed my suspicion that there's a reason that Daikokuya's kotteri broth tastes so much richer than that of other LA ramen joints. For tonkotsu ramen, Daikokuya will always be #1 in my heart (and stomach).

Is it me or have this soup become salty? I ordered my original Daikokuya Ramen, it was all that I remembered it to be, but one thing.... the soup got so salty! The noodles and the broth is still good, but I'll need to chug a water after I eat this.  The ramen is filling, a tiny big bigger than average.  Service was excellent.   Thank god there was no wait around 6:15pm on a weekday, so I urge for those people who want to come by, go on a weekday! Sorry, but I'll pass going here on weekends not really worth the LONGGG wait.

My girlfriend has been trying to take me here since July but it simply didn't work out until my most recent trip to LA.  The predominant reason is that it commonly takes over an hour to be seated and this trip was no exception.  We logged our names and wandered around Little Tokyo for a bit, periodically stopping back to check the list.  I don't know our exact wait but it was somewhere in the vicinity of ninety minutes. When we were seated at the bar my girlfriend politely informed me that I was only allowed to have the Daikokuya Ramen and that my only decision was a half or full order.  I mistakenly went full order.  Unless you're a bottomless-pit teenage athlete or reenacting a Monty Python skit you will suffice with a half order.  Our food was brought out promptly and we nommed away. The broth was very good as were the noodles, and being a carnivore from the midwest I enjoyed the floating pork slabs as well, but overall I just don't see the draw.  Admittedly this is my first ramen restaurant as, big shocker, there aren't any in Nebraska, but after a long wait and for the same price as a meal at a sit down chain restaurant I was expecting more and just didn't get it.  Plus the egg hit my stomach like a depth charge.  Be wary the egg. The food was good but not life changing, the price was okay but not cheap.  The wait is stupid long.  The atmosphere itself is fun.  A large portion of the floor has at least a slight slant to it and there's a nice pork-grease glaze on everything creating just enough slippery to make walking fun again.  The crowd is typically younger, twenty-somethings and people in their early thirties creating a fairly loud noise level but it isn't bothersome in this setting.  The service was good as well as our drinks never fully hit bottom. Overall it's a good restaurant dragged down by popularity.  If it were a hidden gem that didn't have a wait longer than an Alaskan winter night then my rating would creep to four stars, but as it is I can't help but feel like there isn't another ramen restaurant somewhere that isn't *quite* as tasty but is a few bucks cheaper and can seat you in way less time.

Waited an hour for a table and it was difficult because that ramen smells SOOOO GOOOOD!  Especially when you are hungry.  We put our names in and wandered around the Japanese shops a little where I snacked on some chocolate Pandas.  Finally our names were up and we got a booth (yes!).  Service was very friendly and efficient.  We had gyoza and ramen with the chicken and egg side dish (the name in Japanese directly translates to "mother and child, " so sad, but so yummy).  Omg.  The ramen was SOOOOO  GOOOOOOD!  I loved every bite.  My friend and I ate until we actually felt ill from eating too much because it's that good and there is that much soup.  I still couldn't finish it and I felt like I was bursting.  I want to go back.

Good ramen. Not the best I've ever had. Not even the best in LA. But probably the best on the east side of LA. I haven't really ventured out on the menu past the standard ramen and their respective combos. The ikura bowl is always a nice addition, but nearly doubles the price of your meal. The broth is smooth and clean, but not over-the-top porky as some of the other places in town. The chashu pork, which I believe is belly here, is soft and unctuous. The noodles are ok- but after eating a bunch of ramen in Tokyo, they don't really compare to the hand crafted noodles you find over there. If you're Downtown or in Silver Lake, Hollywood, etc, definitely hop over to Little Tokyo for some Daikokuya.  If you live on the west side, however, and you have Santouka and more importantly Yamada-Ya nearby, you have no reason to venture all the way over here.

This place doesn't need any more reviews but i can't help it. It is THAT good. It was my first time here. I finally had a chance to pop in after hearing so much about this legendary place. The wait was bearable since I came fully prepared to wait for a spot. We were seated at the bar area, which i thought was ok at first. But when i started eating, i knew it was a really bad idea. First of all, the kitchen area right in front of the bar is emitting a lot of heat and steam -  there is a constant blast of hot air all around you. I thought ok, no probs, i'll take off my coat and order a nice cold beer to cool me down. That worked until the ramen came (ramen with kotteri flavor was all i ordered). I started to feel really hot and uncomfortable during my meal. Cold beer wasn't helping anymore and i was balancing my coat and handbag on my lap while trying to wipe sweat off my face and struggling with my chopsticks. All at the same time! i finally gave up after eating about 1/3 of the delicious noodles and asked for the rest to go. Ooooh the thought of eating that in comfort of home with another cold beer. i was looking forward to that. Anyways, uncomfortable moments aside, the ramen is EXCELLENT. I can see why some reviewers said the broth was not tasty. That came to my mind too with my first bite. But once i had a good chance to savor my meal comfortably at home, i concluded the broth is definitely packed with yummy porky goodness but i think they season it minimally. Which i think is healthier anyway with less salt, sodium, MSG, whatever you call it. You can always add a bit of soy sauce to bring out the umami flavor. I didn't do that but i added Sriracha hot sauce and it tasted the bomb after that. Ask your server for Sriracha and chili oil on the side when ordering your food. I loved the heaping of green onions and bean sprouts. Some may say the amount of greens is overkill but you need that freshness to cut through the fatty broth. It all went well together. Lots of broth, lots of noodles. Very good all round. i'm a fan! i did miss one thing: sheets of seaweed in the dish like other ramen places i've been too. And i hope they improve on their air conditioning. i spent way less time sitting down with my meal than waiting for a spot!

Believe the Hype! This place is good. I just got the Ramen. it comes out quick No wonder there is always a wait. This place is good. The pork was a little fatty. More fat than meat. but if you're into that, then go for it.

This place is like crack. Sometimes, I go out of my way to get here. I am so lucky I never have too much trouble with parking here. I also come here a lot on Sundays (or after 6pm) apparently so street parking is free ;) Tips: -Don't come when you're hungry. Come when you think you're gonna be hungry in the next hour. GET HERE EARLY, go in, get your name on the clipboard. There will be a wait for up to 45 minutes so grab a drink at the bar next door. -Don't come in a group of more than 4, this place is DINKY. -Get the main special WITH KOTTERI BROTH. You'll thank me. Don't you dare try to skip out on this pork fatty soup. Jog around the block during your wait if you have to but always order it with kotteri broth. -Sure you can order a large beer and large sake if you're in the mood to bomb -Utilize the red pepper. -Don't ask for a fork. Man up your chopstick skills. And last time I came, it was CASH ONLY though the times before that, I used my card so I don't know what's up. But there is a CHASE ATM in the far end of the little tokyo plaza across the street.

Walked into this delicious shanty and put my name down on a list.  After about 10 minutes of waiting, they called my name and I sat down. I started off with the gyoza and it was spectacular. In fact it was the best I ever had.  The pork gyoza comes out topped with a crispy flakey layer on top and my first reaction was crap they burned my food, but in fact it was the perfect consistency and flavor and I would come back here for this alone. I ordered the ramen and it was pretty good but not amazing.  I was told they were out of korreti which is supposedly what makes their ramen amazing here so I did not have the full experience and for that I will come back.   My bill came out to $15, but you can easily get a lunch special for under $10.  Plan to come back soon.

I actually give this place 3.5 stars. I heard something about it being the best in LA but being for NorCal, I would say there are tons of places in NorCal that are much much better not only in taste, but also presentation. Presentation does matter, people!! My friends and I were super hungry when we came here at around 4-5PM, and waited about 25 minutes for a table. The gyoza was pretty good and the ramen I would say is a bit above average, but maybe because we were really hungry. It was strange to see bean sprouts in there- I think it would be a lot tastier without them because it kinda washes away the ramen's flavor. Yeah.. unfortunately nothing else to say about this place.. :/ It was good though.. just not 4000-reviews-good.

All time favorite Ramen place. It's always crowded so unless it's off hours I tend to avoid. But it's crowded for a reason. Ramen is good. Their chicken, beef, and salmon roe bowls are all good. Their sushi, although an odd place to have, is great as well!

I don't know... the first time I had Daikokuya, I thought it was great.  But that was before having Orenchi in the Bay Area.  After my Orenchi cherry was popped, so to speak, I had Daikokuya again and was very disappointed.   The wait - yes, expect to wait 45min-1 hour.  Luckily my boyfriend at the time lived on 2nd Street, so we were able to put our names down then went back to his place to chill for 30min-1 hour before heading back down to claim our seats.   Portion wise, they give you a generous amount of food.  The bowls are large, you get a lot of noodles and an entire egg that is perfectly soft boiled.  Broth wise, this is where Orenchi comes out on top.  The first time I had Daikokuya, I thougth it was heavenly - how naiive I was... Overall, probably the best ramen in LA but def not the best in California.  Sorry!

Absolutely delicious ramen. I was a bit disappointed that they only have one kind. I was expecting more customization options but it WAS super delicious. I could have done without the egg and super fatty chasu though. The broth was super flavorful. I love the decor inside, the lighting was nice and the restaurant felt very Japanese. I liked the vintage feel of it. Our server was very attentive and nice, service was also super fast. Guess it needs to be considering how long people wait to get in here! The wait was terrible, 45 minutes on a Saturday afternoon. I would come here again, yes. I'll try on a week night however or start my wait when I'm not hungry, haha.

When I read all the reviews, it said the best ramen from SoCal.  While this might be the case, this is hardly the best ramen I've had, ever.  I can't speak for Tokyo, which probably has the best ramen in the world, but I have been to many places in New York, and it has so many more better spots, AINEC. The broth and the pork are in general a bit weak in flavor, and I got the kotteri flavor version.  Fundamentally, it was a decent ramen, but there was nothing to write home about.  Because of the hype, I was very disappointed at the experience, maybe I'll give it another try the next time I come here and it was a bad day, but overall it was just a decent ramen place, nothing more. The shredded pork dish was actually pretty good however, and my friend enjoyed the eel dish, so there are some highlights.  For the price and what you get it isn't bad, but it isn't amazing, either. I know my review seem like NYC snobbery, but I feel I am objectively judging based on pure taste.  There are things in LA I like more than in NYC, but this ramen is not one of them.

I'm not sure if maybe I'm just not a big ramen person, but this is the second time I've tried it because people have raved about a place, and i wasnt that blown away. My friends Brian and Eric were visiting from NorCal, and even thy had heard about how amazing this place was. Surprising there was hardly a wait and we were seated after a few minutes. I ordered the daikokuya ramen since I figured it was the most popular dish, and I thought it was alright. It was a good meal, and a huge portion too, but it wasnt something I'd rush to tell all my friends. The servers were nice and it was a quaint little location, nothing fancy. Nice experience, but can't see myself craving to go back.

DK, as my boyfriend's brother has nicknamed Daikokuya, is now my go-to ramen place. The daikoku ramen has got that authentic ramen taste that I haven't had anywhere else. For those people who don't know what REAL ramen tastes like; it is FAR from what instant noodles taste like, so don't bother voicing out your opinion. lol Always ask for extra kotteri sauce for that extra fatty broth. Granted, I avoid eating fatty food, but this is the one place I'd make an exception of. I've also tried a couple combos with the ramen and I didn't like any of them except for the fried rice and my now favorite; the shredded pork bowl. After going to DK thrice and NOT ordering the shredded pork bowl, I decided on my 4th visit and thought to myself, why not give myself a little bit more pork meat to try? So I did and I couldn't stop gushing about how hella freaking GOOD it was!! Ever since then, I NEVER come to DK without ordering the shredded pork bowl. Anyway, if you decide to try this place out, make sure you don't go during their busy hours of which I still can't figure out what times they are NOT busy, other than 5pm during weekdays whenever I go and RARELY have to wait too long.

After 3872 meals here, it's still as good as it gets on US soil. I've tried 3 of the other locations and this is the only line wait that can be justified. I believe at one point, there was a 10 day period when I had 8 meals here.  Yea... Come before 11:15 for lunch and 6:30 before dinner on weekdays and the wait will be non existent to bearable.  Weekends are deadly. They are CASH ONLY now.

It has a super long line! Around an hour wait, but I think never complain anymore after trying its ramen for the first time. The ramen is just simply awesome. Enough said. However, the first time I went with a party of 11 people and we were separated into 3 tables because they only have a 4 persons table; thus going in a group of 4 or less is best!

Just went for ramen again couple of days ago. Long wait as usual. I had considered this place as the best ramen place this side of the Pacific, I've noticed a slow but sure sign of decline in my recent visits. I'd now say Orenchi Ramen in Santa Clara, CA is better. The broth is getting more diluted. Less generous on spring onions. The egg tends to be more overcooked (yolk shouldn't be set). And for this time, the pork that I got is more like shreds than slices, and some shreds are pretty tough, probably they're now using the bottom part of the belly as well, which is always gonna be tough. Another thing I noticed while waiting for my ramen by the bar is that the skillet cook wasn't that concentrated. There was an empty skillet unattended on high heat to the point the grease on the skillet was catching fire while he was on the other end by the deep fryer, the ramen cook saw it and did nothing. Eventually the skillet cook came back and used the same overheated skillet for a dish, and the ingredients were all burnt instantly. He also burnt an order of gyoza, which he just used a large amount of spring onions to cover up. Still yet to find a better place in LA, sigh. A couple of tips -- the ramen + don combo is good enough for two people; the restrooms are not quite pleasant.

The line is always huge here. I came here out of curiosity (because I always see a big line waiting there) I don't think it deserve the wait though. The price is decent. The noodle is a bit hard. The soup is a bit salty. The egg is raw so if you are allergic to raw eggs, don't eat it. Overall it is a pretty good place to eat but it doesn't deserve a 1 1/2 hr wait :(

I had Diakokuya this weekend after a night out at Oiwake with Leda T, Alan W, Kristin C, Justin B, as well as many other friends. It was surprisingly busy late at night. The wait was a little long, but I am definitely glad we waited. I ordered the Diakokuya Ramen and it was delicious. The egg was perfectly cooked and the ramen noodles had the right texture (al dente).  The ramen was also generously topped with pork. It was definitely yummy! A great place to eat after a night of drinking. Note: They only accept cash!

Prolly the best ramen In Southern California. There I said it. I Have been to many many many Ramen Shops all around LA. I think this is the best Overall. Went back here recently and ordered some non ramen dishes Fried rice = Amazing! Off the Charts! Gyoza and Tsumomo was excellent too. My DC who is originally from Tokyo said it was Very good and She was impressed. This is the real deal for top notch Ramen in LA. My score is 4.25 stars

Pros: Ramen, shredded pork bowl Cons: Wait time I came here for the first time yesterday after a night of drinking at Oiwake down the street.  It was about 1 am too, so this place is open pretty late (although we were the last people to be seated). Every time I've been to Little Tokyo, I've always wanted to check this place out but there always seems to be a line out the door. Glad I finally got to. I ended up ordering the Daikoku ramen bowl ($8.50).  It's your typical ramen bowl (noodles, pork, soft boiled egg, etc).  Pretty tasty.  I've had some pretty good bowls of ramen and this one is definitely up there in terms of quality and taste.  The fatty pork pieces definitely did it for me. My girlfriend ordered the shredded pork bowl ($8.50) and that was also very good.  They pretty much take the same pork they use for the ramen and put it on top of rice.  You can't lose with that. Overall, pretty good, but expect a wait if you don't go during random late night hours.

Been here a few times now just for lunch and I always get a soup combo. I had my soup with the fried rice and the shredded pork bowl. I liked the pork bowl a lot better than their fried rice. Oh and to start you get a small salad too. Yum. I've also tried their gyoza and even though it was good, not sure if I'd get it again. With the combo it was just a lot of food. I can never finish my soup anyways and I just take it for dinner or the next day. This place can get packed during lunch. So be prepared to wait. And of course... it is now CASH ONLY.

This is definitely not the best ramen i have ever tried, but it's pretty damn good. I love the texture of the ramen noodles because they aren't too soft or chewy. I came in a group so we got a few combos. The terriyaki eel, tuna sashimi, and tempera combos were all really good. My favorite part of the meal was the salad that came with the combo. The peanut/sesame/garlic dressing is sooooo freakin good! i can eat that ALL day. NO JOKE.

SOOO good!! this is not your college dorm room ramen. This is the real deal and it's delicious. And huge! Went on a Saturday for lunch and waited at least an hour. You have to listen carefully because they only yell out your number once. Miss it and you miss out. They have other items on the menu but of course I had to order the ramen! There is only one choice, it comes with pork. You can get a flavoring (i think it's just fat really) added but I didn't get it. My brother and my boyfriend did. I tried it and I liked my plain version better. Anyway, I'm getting ahead of myself. For as long as the wait was the service was super quick. We had 3 steaming bowls of ramen in front of us very quickly. Did I mention the size of this bowl? I think all three of us could have split one. The broth is delicious, a nice pork flavor. The abundant noodles were nice and soft but not mushy and there were big chunks of pork. There is also an egg which I think is kinda weird and not really necessary but hey if that's your thing, awesome. Needless to say we stuffed ourselves and still had a ton leftover. I wanted to keep eating but I just couldn't! This will definitely be my bar when I visit other ramen houses in the future and I hope to visit it again sometime when I'm in LA.

Every time I go and visit my friends and family or just go to Socal for fun, I will always come to Daikokuya. I can't help it, old habits die hard. I started coming here around 2007 and haven't stopped coming since then. Yes, line is long, but I always seem to not wait past 30 mins. I usually order gyoza, ramen combo (comes with another dish), I don't usually finish but I don't have this place in Norcal, so I order what I can and give the rest to my friends or bf. Love the broth, it is rich and tasty. I wish I could order it spicy without having to pay extra for it. Gyoza is always the best here! The consistency of the gyoza the past several years hasn't changed. I can't recall the amount I paid for all the dishes. I haven't gone back to Socal for close to a year... maybe it is time to plan a trip back! Can't wait! Writing this review started to make me drool for Daikokuya ramen and gyoza!

one word "overrated" I dont understand why this place is so packed every night. Came here like 3 times had to wait for maybe 45 minutes each time I ordered their ramen my god... I donno if its me but the soup is so damn warm... its not even hot at all.. The pork slice green onions eggs noodles its decent but really... its nothing spectacular... Usually when you eat ramen at least one or two things stand out. Their ramen never leaves me any great memories.

I don see whac da bic deal is about dit place! All my friends made it seem like it was the most amazing ramen that I will ever taste and that the ridiculously long line was worth the wait.  So after weeks of trying to get people to go with me and an hour and a half after I actually got there, I got to try Daikokuya for the first time! I'll tell you now that the wait here is mainly due to its size.  This place is tiny!  If they're expecting an influx of customers everyday, I really think they should consider expanding.  Also, some of the decor is a little creepy.  If you peak right above the door, there are some vintage toys and dolls that feel like they're staring at you while you eat o_O I, of course, got the Pork Belly Ramen; and I was really expecting a lot more than what I received.  The broth was light; which I liked.  It wasn't too oily and it had an ordinary ramen flavor to it.  The noodles were a little harder than I would like, but there wasn't anything wrong with them.  The bowl was sorta small and didn't really fill me up.  The one thing that I did like was the soft-boiled egg that they added to the mix.  All-in-all, though, there wasn't anything special that makes Daikokuya really stand out.  I still believe that the wait is due to the size of the restaurant.  Yes, they have good ramen, but nothing you have to wait an hour and a half for.

I've stayed in Little Tokyo for almost 10 years on my visits to LA and I've looked across the street and saw the lines for Daikokua so many times.  I finally went there Tuesday. I ordered the combination ramen with tuna sashimi.  It comes with a bowl of slaw with a dressing that was superb!  I think it was the best part of the meal. I got the extra flavoring for the ramen.  The ramen was good but it was ramen.  I didn't think the broth stood out against any others I've had.  The rice bowl with the tuna sashimi was good, but again, this was standard sashimi--nothing exceptional expected nor delivered. Service was very good except for a little glitch.  I was shown to a counter seat only to be asked to move because I was sitting at an employees only seat that later became seating for anyone who came in the door, err, curtain depending on how cold it was getting outside. When the most memorable thing about a ramen meal is the slaw salad for a starter, it's hard to give it more than the three stars it deserves.

This place was delicious with huge portions. Portion size is a big deal for me. The only things that keep it from receiving that last star is the long wait and the fact that none of the tables could seat all six of us so we had to split up our group throughout the restaurant. Kinda lame.

Logistics first.  You need to walk in and write your name on the list yourself.  They will call by name and number so remember both - sometimes the servers were hard to understand.  If you are not quick to claim your reservation, it will be given to someone else.  This was especially tricky for larger parties - I saw them give a 5-top away to 2 people after giving the party of 5 about 1 minute to claim their table.  So stay on your toes, people. CASH ONLY! Now, was this all worth it?  Not in my opinion.  The salad that comes with the combinations was pathetic - just cabbage with pink mayo sauce on it.  The pork rice bowl was pretty good as well as the gyoza. But we are here for the ramen, yes? Comparing this to Monta in Las Vegas, the ramen noodles were higher quality but the pork was not.  But there was more pork.  The soup was not as salty as Monta but not as flavorful either.  I really didn't taste pork in the broth like I do at Monta.  I was starving and wasn't really impressed.  Kirin on tap and by the pitcher was a nice touch, though. FYI, the restaurant had a B rating when I was there.  All in all, it was ok but not worth the wait.

I would give this place no stars if I could. For a ramen place that's so hyped, you'd think they would at least have a vegetarian menu. I wasted an hour and a half with friends only to end up drinking water and eating rice. Thanks. Vegetarians beware: this place is no good.

PORK PORK PORK GOODNESS!!! I'm vietnamese, pork is a MAJOR cornerstone of my culture. Well that, and I just like pork. With that being said, I had heard about this ramen place from several friends but am not a ramen super-fan so I never made it to Daikokuya until last night around 1130pm. OMFG it was SOOOOOOOOOO AMAZING!!! I got the ramen combo w the shredded pork bowl and my fat friends also shared between us a plate of fried rice. RAMEN - I like the less salty/vinegar-y broth...I think the broth is the main reason I don't usually like ramen but this wasn't super salty but had so much pork flavor!!! Cuts of pork were super delicious and fatty and the boiled egg, scallions and mushrooms were all just yuuuummy. LARGE portion. couldn't even finish half and I know that is frowned upon by the Japanese. PORK BOWL - THE BEST BEST BEST. Must be like pure pork belly or something because the little morsels just melt in your mouth. Nice seasoning, great with their ginger. FRIED RICE - more chunks of succulent pork. also served with some ginger. light (for fried rice) but very tasty! Need to come to this pork palace more regularly FO SHIZZLE, even though it is all the way downtown and I have to have my mace in hand and ready to fire when parking a few blocks away from it.

I always get the Daikokuya Ramen, since thats what Daikokuya is known for.  The bowls are huge too!  If you're extra hungry, you could opt for a combination and get a rice bowl with it. Noodles were cooked perfectly -- not too soft, not too hard.  Al dente!   Broth was very rich in flavor and I can tell they don't use msg (very little if they do).  I recommend going for the koterri for that extra rich/fatty taste. Staff is always running all over the place so it can be hard to get a refill on water sometimes (minus a star).  It's expected since this place is always so busy.  They're quick to clean up when you're done though.  They obviously want you outta there asap so that more customers can come in. Only downside is that this place gets so crowded.  I've been here multiple times and its usually an hour wait.  Make sure to put enough time on the meter! Only if San Diego had ramen this good...

I will come here forever and ever and ever.. in fact that's all I talk about with my friend Jesse.. going to daikokuya for the most amazing ramen of my life.

Now i got to say this place is the best place to go for Ramen. I go here at least once a week. The service is good and the food is great. I usually go to Ramen spots just to try the ramen. Here I have tried the complete menu and got to say that everything is really good. I give it 4 stars because of the service and food. The reason i didn't give it 5 stars is that the place is small and always pack. If you come with someone then you will more then likely have to wait 20 minutes just to be seasted. If you want to try the place and don't mind coming alone then you can get a seat pretty quick.

Best Ramen ever. Melt in your mouth pork (truly). EPIC FLAVOR. Serious bone broth (a la Sally Fallon's 'Nourishing Traditions').  Worth the wait, but counter seats can get warm from the boiling noodle pots. Choose booth seats if you can't stand the heat.

Sorry Daik... I think it's better if we just be friends. Daik is a great ramen place but over the past year I have had affairs with several other ramen places and I had no choice but to downgrade this.   It's simply just not worth the long wait when you can get better ramen faster somewhere else. Also, the MSG finally got me. Had it one night and when I went home I wanted to drink my swimming pool. Go Santouka or Yamadaya =X

Best Ramen I have ever had in my life! Soup base is just amazing. You can taste the work they put into making it. Service is always great and friendly. Make sure to plan on waiting though I usually put my name down and take a walk thru the Japanese Village shopping area depending on the wait. Also note they call the number listed by where you write your name, not your name so take note of it. On hot days and also when it's hot inside this small place I always order the Teksukemen (forgive my spelling). It's  soup with room temp noodles and everything else on the side. Also have tried their fried rice and tempura also very good. Also phone service isn't the best here but there is also a free wifi signal for Little Tokyo available.

This is definitely one of the best ramen places in LA. However, the wait is the killer. I think their ramen always tastes extra special because by the time you actually get to order in eat it, you're so hungry that anything tastes good. That being said, I still like their tonkotsu based ramen with their shredded pork bowl combo. Worth a try in your lifetime.

DELICIOUS :) my favorite ramen place in Los Angeles so far. The only thing is, sometimes the line gets soooo long. Once I went, my friends and I put our names down, went to a bar nearby for an hour and a half, came back and it was still not our turn :( Other than that, the ramen is seriously to die for! Very comparable to Ippudo in NYC (which is apparently one of the best ramen places in NYC)... Yum, I like!

The wait here is pretty bad, but I was told that it was really worth the wait..anddd it was. I had a party of 3 and we ordered: 2 Bowls of Daikoku Ramen - Pretty good really good. Not the best thing I had in that sitting though A Serving of Fried Rice - A Shredded Pork Bowl - Delicious, so good. Best thing I've had in a really really long time. It's fatty, it's juicy, it's flavorful, it's delicious. It's everything that you could possibly want and more.

You know, I had been looking forward to going to this place for a while since it had so much good buzz... when the food actually came out it was kind of a downer. Apart of it might have been that my expectations had been built up to unrealistic proportions... but I'm pretty sure I've had better ramen (sorry!) ATMOSPHERE/SERVICE:   It's a complete hole in the wall! I  really liked it. I felt as if I had been transported to Japan. The people who work there are SUPER  sassy and kind of awesome since they well be yelling at eachother in Japanese. It makes the atmosphere really dynamic. PARKING: The parking situation was absolutely terrible. My friend( who drove us) ended getting ticketed, because he had accidentally parked across the street. The problem is that the signs that designate the where it is okay for you to park are  NOT  clear at all. They're extremely confusing and open to multiple interpretations. FOOD:   Ahh, the most important part. So let me start by saying that there was an hour and a half wait before we could get in, because the entire place was completely packed. So we were kind wandering around Tokyo, extremely hungry and trying to kill time. So we ordered sushi as an appetizer, as well as the Daikokuya ramen. The sushi was meh. I've had better. As for the ramen, the soup was nice and warm, and the broth was rich. However, the egg was cold and kind of gross. OVERALL IMPRESSIONS   So it's not a bad place. I don't necessarily know if it was worth the wait time, and the time we spent driving to little Tokyo.

For those looking for a place to convert vegetarians and vegans back to the dark side, Daikokuya is the answer. If the seared kurobuta pork belly with sweet glaze and green onions don't win them over, the shredded pork rice bowl will. The pork belly here is just simply sublime. Its the perfect amount of melt in your mouth buttery-ness and stupendous fattiness. The sweet glaze perfectly complements the overabundance of green onion heaped on top. The rice bowl is simply the same thing, but with rice and pickled ginger. The tonkatsu kotteri ramen was pretty good, but not quite as good as the pork appetizers and rice bowls. The soup didn't have as much flavor as I wanted and the noodles were a bit stiff. Also, the wait can be a nightmare at times.. expect to wait 30 minutes to over an hour anytime of day. But.. its worth it.

The broth is so flavorful...the ramen is one of the best in SoCal...there are so many different options within a mile and this is a sure stop when we're in town...looks really unassuming from the outside but it's worth it's weight in gold.... RAMEN is the thing to order here...if you're thinking of having something like a bento box then this wouldn't be my first recommendation...the 5 stars is strictly for the RAMEN...I have not tried much of the other stuff...and the little I have tried wasn't fantastic...come for RAMEN...YAY!

Imagine a meaty broth made from boiling pork bones and soy sauce over hours and hours served with bamboo shoots, beans sprouts and green onions.  The slices of pork are so tender they literally melt in your mouth.  And the boiled egg still has a slightly runny center.  Sounds like wishful thinking but this can all be granted at Daikokuya in Little Tokyo as long as you're willing to wait about an hour for your meal. They have a pretty simple menu.  The ramen is their specialty dish but they also have a cold style version on hot summer days and bento box meals.  I love it when places have a simple menu because it makes choosing dinner so much easier. I doubt I'll ever come here again just because of the wait but at least when you sit down, the ramen comes out quickly and the service is friendly.  The seats are limited and I wouldn't recommend a group larger than 6.   Also, to all the future Daikokuya eaters out there, once you're done eating, take care of your bill and scoot!  I know we all love catching up over a hot meal but let's give everyone that chance.  During my hour+ wait, I noticed way too many groups lingering out still talking 10-30 minutes after their meal. Final  tip! CA$H ONLY!

First off, as the 3K + reviews attest, ramen at this Little Tokyo gem can't be beat. I also highly recomend their fried rice. My cravings for Daikokuya usually peak on grey cold rainy days --just perfect for a nice hot bowl of awesome. And yes, this pocket sized restaurant is always packed, so expect and respect the fact that this place demands a line. The food is well worth the wait. Second, if you haven't already (shame on you!), watch Tampopo. It's the perfect movie for foodies in general, and you'll have a better appreciation for ramen tradition and the art of making what seems to be a very simple bowl of  noodle soup.

It's no great secret that I can kinda be a hater at times, especially when WP's jock Daiko like it is the only place to get ramen in all of Los Angeles (give me Santouka or Shin Sen Gumi any day). However... I ate there last night and it was really fucking good. I was with a large group, and we waited over an hour (props to Emily for bringing snacks!), but my Ramen and Fried Rice combo really hit the spot. I'll be back, fellow crackas.

My favorite Ramen place ever! Lives up to the hype. I've never had Ramen this good and I've been to several LA Ramen joints. Soup is absolutely delicious as well as the noodles. It's a sizable portion so you will be full. The wait is ridiculous and infamous but if you go at the right time on a random weekday you might not have to wait more than 20 minutes. If you don't want to wait just go to Orochon haha. Daiko is definitely where it's at for the foodies among us though. And did I mention the price is great :).

I AM OFFICIALLY A FAN. I have only ever been to the downtown LA location, and although it can indeed be over an hour and a half wait, it's worth it. FOOD: Their serving sizes are huge, especially for the price. I usually get the house special ramen and tuna rice combo. I've never actually FINISHED all this food (the serving sizes are basically like a POT of ramen and a full-sized bowl of rice), but I sure have tried. The broth in their ramen is probably some house secret, as it tastes a little like miso that's been spiced up, and it's much creamier than typical miso soup base. All i know is, it is delicious. Their tuna rice comes with sushi-rice (a more vinegary, sticky rice) with sashimi-grade tuna slices served over the top. SERVICE: Pretty friendly from the two times I've visited so far. They take orders with a Palm Pilot-looking thing, and they are always very quick about getting your order, getting the table water/beverages, and serving your food hot. Small downside: they are CASH ONLY (a little inconvenient) and the interior is very small -- but those are the only downsides I can see so far! Definitely returning. Yum!

I come here every chance I get! At Daikokuya you get REAL Japanese food which is ramen and soups. You can get different flavored broths and lots of yummy ingredients like sprouts, pork, ginger ang veggies. I love the Japanese gyoza too. Worth the wait but avoid peak hour if you have flexibility with your lunch hour. For a change you can get other hot dishes with seafood or beef that are yummy and spiced to perfection. This is one of the Asian restaurants in SoCal that really make you feel like you are eating authentic Asian food. Come hungry! :-)

Came here with some friends (one a Muslim) because this place was supposed to be the holy grail of all ramen spots in LA. All other spots should pale in comparison to this mighty bowl, right? I ordered the sausage appetizer while everyone else tried the fried rice. The sausages were decent, above average actually. really well seasoned. The fried rice was VERY delicious, even though it used fake crab meat (i'm not used to that). We all agreed that the rice was a showstopper, until the Ramen came! ...and we continued to agree that the rice was the showstopper. The ramen was so very, very bland. The pork pieces were sliced razor-thin, the broth was just some muddy, non-flavorful ooze that did not accentuate the noodles, bamboo, or really much of anything. The options for my muslim friend were very small and he ended up getting miso soup which he also said was bland. We had to fight to get out of this place because people think it's cool to talk about Ron Paul in the middle of a doorway with a Pull-handle in a tiny restaurant. So anyway... LMFAO...4 stars with 3k reviews, all by hipsters who either moved to LA within 5 years, or are tourists being taken by other people who don't know what real ramen is anyway. People, you have GOT to be kidding me about this. I have never been hyped so much over a place to be let down so massively. Save your money and go to Mr. Ramen down the street, or pack into your Prius and drive to Santouka for actual non-hipster ramen.

HOLY ****! My friend took me here and of course I had to get the ramen with the kotteri broth. I have to say that the broth was amazing! I totally ignored the noodles and just kept drinking the broth. I'm a bit embarrassed to say this, but if they had a to go cup of the broth I would so totally take it... I have to say the chashu was a bit dry for my taste, but every thing else made up for it. This place can get pretty packed, not forgetting to mention parking. There is parking across the street and the place itself doesn't have that many tables so the wait can take a while. However, the wait is well worth it. Since I've had this once I've eaten all the other ramen around here it's just not the same... Happy Eatings!

Curses!!! Why are you so far away from meeee... (shout out to my homies in the OC!) I long for authentic noodles and my mouth is still salivating as I continue to reminisce the hot bowl of goodness.  Though my hubby and I waited about an hour on a Wednesday night, (yeah... in the middle of the week!!) it was totally worth it.  I just wished that I didn't snack so much before we were seated! The offering We began with an appetizer- spicy tuna roll ($5.95), as it was highly recommended by the waitress. Who could blame her as it's fresh spicy tuna then deep fried *drools* Although, I must warn you that Daikokuya is generous with their entree portion sizes so, one could easily have been full with just a single item! We were then presented with two complimentary salad dishes with tasty Japanese salad dressing.  As we delightfully consumed our rabbit food the waitress plopped down our enormous ramen bowl right before us. And oh man... everything was superb.  The noodles were chewy, the broth hot and flavorful, and the meat tender and moist.  Mmmm....  But of course since we wanted to sample other menu items and decided to go with a combination meal.   Me- Ramen + Sashimi ($12.50) Hubby- Ramen + Pork Cutlet Bowl ($11.95) Both combos were extremely delicious and I feel that it's a great value.  For about $12 bucks you can tango with your taste buds without breaking the banks. Bravo Daikokuya!

Came here with a group of 6. We were able to avoid the hour + waits that I've read about. We had to split up though, but it wasn't too bad.. and it's understandable since the place is quite small. Had the ramen combo with tuna and a salad. The ramen was good, definitely more flavorful than the one in Monterey Park.. and they gave more meat it seemed but less bean sprouts and bamboo shoots. The noodles were a good texture and the soup was hot. The salad was the slaw type with A LOT of dressing which is exactly the way I like, so it was delicious. The tuna over rice was good, came with about 4-5 pieces of fresh tuna sashimi and a lot of rice which I couldn't finish. I took the ramen to go and the noodles didn't soak up the broth, so it was still edible the next day. I don't know if it lives up to the hype but it was good nonetheless.

The first time I ate at Daikokuya I would have rated it 4 Stars.  I thought it was decent ramen but not necessarily worth the wait or the drive.  Well, that was a few years ago and now fast forward to 2012..... THIS IS THE BEST RAMEN I EVER ATE!!!  Seriously, I don't know if I got a sub-par batch of ramen last time but the one I had this time was HEAVEN in a bowl.  I actually got the Tsukemen so I think the broth tasted even more flavorful than if the noodles had been in it and slightly diluted the taste.  I never had my ramen Tsukemen style before and now there is no going back.  I ignorantly thought that only somen and soba were for dipping but now I have seen the light.   Fried rice here is very good but the shredded pork bowl leaves something to be desired.  The sauce on it was icky sweet, usually only Americanized Japanese take-out places mess up the Teriyaki sauce that hard.  Salad here is amazingly amazing.  I don't know what that salad dressing is made up of but I wish they would decide to bottle and sell it.

As good as it gets.  This place is one of the BEST places I've ever had fresh ramen.  The broth is boiled overnight so it's super rich and flavorful and the noodles chewy and absolutely YUMMY. I also got their spicy tuna rolls- didn't know if sushi was going to be good at a ramen place, but it was SUPER fresh, perfectly spicy, and crispy with the cucumber in a soft rice roll. It's worth the wait!!!

Went to this place last night with a bunch of friends.  First off, the place is tiny.  Groups of 4 max.  They crammed 7 of us in one table which was obviously only met to hold 4 people.  Second, long wait.  We must have waited about an hour and a half outside in the cold.  Good thing we were eating ramen, which brings me to why we came here in the first place. I had the Daikoku Ramen combination with the Salmon Roe rice bowl.  The salmon roe rice bowl was nothing special.  As for the ramen, the broth was really good but the noodles just did not complement the broth.  The pork really makes the bowl.  Moist, juicy and tender.  In my opinion though, it was not worth the wait.

With SoCal being home to so many wonderful ramen restaurants, Daikokuya definitely lives up to its hype, but I will say some things regarding the restaurant. I've been surprised at their lack of consistency, and the wait really is ridiculous. I understand that the place is small and with so much food per serving, it's extremely difficult to have fast turnover. The ramen has the texture and the broth is strong, but it's not always this way. The Kotteri style was worth trying (albeit quite fatty), and I think the side donburi are great combos. Thank goodness there's tsukemen.  However, I want this experience each and every time that I'm there, and I think Daikokuya is a bit complacent about its lines out the door every night. Glad that they take credit card. For ~$10+, it's great food for a great price. With Hakata Ramen opening in LT, I'm sure the impatient people forming lines out the door at Daikokuya will be going elsewhere.

This place is great because the ramen is delicious and the vibe inside makes you feel like you've been transported to Tokyo!   It's a bit cramped and the booths are too narrow - all of which I love since I remember feeling a bit too large everywhere I went in Tokyo too!  The food is fantastic - it reminds me a lot of the ramen I ate all over Japan, and it got the stamp of approval of my cousin who's lived there for 10 years.   The restaurant is very popular so you will have to wait to eat, but it's worth the wait.

This place was great! An authentic Japanese ramen restaurant open late and crowded with lots of young, vibrant hipsters. I got the extra porky broth and now realize how one of my favorite places up north makes their broth too. Not the healthiest thing for you but man was it good. The price is right, too, about $8. We also got some gyozas to start and those were some of the best fried gyozas ever. They even give you some sauce. I wasn't sure about the layer of green onion on top but it was fine. I enjoyed the options of pickled ginger and minced garlic on the table to help kick up the flavor. The service was fast, efficient, decor was cute and reminded me of being in Japan again, so just bring some cash cause that's all they take and enjoy! Drink a lot of water too. Then go work out the next day.

I was wrong.  The ramen rocks.  The porky-broth is like velvet on the tongue.  The noodles have the perfect bite.  The line is out of control long.   Don't get me wrong, I love this place, but the wait is killer.  Ramenya provides a nice alternative though the broth at Ramenya isn't quite as porky-rich.

You know when you see a lot people waiting in front of a restaurant, you think this has to be good...not always..this place is average. Some times it's just a matter of having a small place. I didn't mind the wait. I waited about 30 minutes and was seated at the counter, didn't mind that either, you get to see whats going on in the kitchen. We ordered some Ramen, Gyoza ,Yakisoba and Green Tea. The Ramen was great nice portion good soup... Gyoza were pretty (really) greasy , I think I should have ordered a side of Lipitor with my gyoza's :) The Yakisoba had very little to it, very little veggies, very little meat. The Green Tea was great no sugar the way I like it. All in all, just average to me I've had better at other places and because of that I'd say the wait wasn't worth it and unless I'm requested I don't think I'll go back.

When I am waiting in line for this place, which is around an hour, I usually end up walking around the area. If their was one thing that I noticed it was that all the restaurants on the same street have no customers in them. One is even another ramen restaurant. I kind of feel bad that they are possibly losing a little bit business to L.A.'s king of ramen. Do I feel bad enough to try their restaurants instead? Nope. I always have to get the combo with my ramen. Pork Cutlet or Shredded Pork Bowl are my favorite selections. It is like they killed that pig right in the back just for me because they knew what I wanted. Their ramen is so good that I wouldn't be surprised if they had all their ingredients imported from Japan everyday. The broth is just rich and warm. Meat melts in your mouth. Doesn't matter how full I get I will always finish everything. Put that broth in a bottle for me so I can drink it on the way home. On a cold day there is nothing better than a nice warm bowl of ramen from here. Chicken soup? Don't be a noob!!!

We came here on a Wed. afternoon around 2:30. Thank god there was just a short little wait and we got sat at a table. The interior is really small and there are just a handful of tables and a long row of bar seating. The decor is nothing to die for. The service was quick and friendly. Since it wasn't slammed like i usually see this place, the waitresses were attentive. We ordered a Daikokuya Ramen. I didn't get it kotteri style since i had gotten it once before and it was incredibly greasy :/ The ramen was flavorful and i enjoyed the half cooked egg! Although it was good, i felt like it was pretty generic. Its good when you don't have to wait 2 hours in line! Surprisingly, we also ordered a bento box and it was actually a good portion and the chicken teriyaki was actually really tasty! This place is good but i definitely wouldn't wait over 10 minutes for it!

Dear Daikokuya, I know I will get a heart attack from eating you. Especially when I add the Kottorei (back fat - yes you read that correctly) flavoring you have the best tasting broth in the world. Your noodles are nice and noodley thick unlike Hakata Shinsengumi. Your chashu is plentiful and tender. While I wish your combination bowls could taste better, when I have half a bowl of ramen left anyway, I don't think I can complain. I do complain that you are a tiny hole in the wall where I still have to wait 30-45 mins for dinner at 3:45pm. Also, I do complain that you no longer take credit cards period. But I will sigh and grit my teeth and not air my complaints because love would be swimming in a big warm bowl of Daikokuya ramen.

Daikokuya.. you have changed how I feel about ramen. My last experience with ramen left me in tears because it was so pork filled and meaty and disgusting, but now I can actually say that I am a fan of ramen. After going to the MOCA, Edward C. and I came here.  After waiting for over an hour, we both got the Daikokuya ramen combos.  He got it with fried rice, I got it with chicken teriyaki. We were hungry, don't judge us.   The combos came with salads, they were whatever. The ramen itself was great.  It tasted homemade.  It wasn't too flavorful, but I mean that in the best way possible. Not too salty, not too meaty.  I didn't try the egg that came in the broth, because I'm not a fan of eggs, but Edward loved his.   The chicken teriyaki was also delicious, and that's saying something because I chicken teriyaki is usually just... chicken teriyaki.  The fried rice was great as well. The only complaint I have about Daikokuya is the wait, but you really can't do anything about that...... so i recommend going there signing in and then walking around little tokyo to entertain yourselves :)

One of my top ramen places to go, no matter how "overrated" it may be to others. It hits the spot and it hits it well. Basic break down for anyone on yelp that is just on here to see what to get cause it's your first time: Get any ramen you want, daikoku ramen (if you want to be safe) but whatever you do...GET KOTTERI with it! You can thank me later! It makes that shit THE shit! To think about kotteri is sinful but I'm already drooling ready to go back!

As many of my friends who know me well will tell you, I'm a huge fan of Ramen.  I've eaten at many a ramen joint in New York and never turn down the opportunity to get ramen out of town.  So when a friend tipped me off about Daikokuya in Little Tokyo, I knew that I had to go. This small, somewhat noisy Ramen house on 1st is larger than a typical New York ramen joint (except Ippudo), but somehow manages to get hungry patrons queued up in a seemingly never-ending line for food.  We arrived around 8:20 on a Tuesday night and didn't get seated until 90 minutes later.  We debated whether or not to leave  the line and try one of the other many ramen joints along the street, but with such a huge time investment already underway, we figured we had to commit. We sat at the booth and quickly perused the menu, both of us opting for the Daikoku ramen (I got mine with the Kotteri broth for richer flavor).  We also split an order of sliced roast pork to start.  The sliced roast pork was great: good flavor, savory, and covered in delicious sauce and sweet-smelling green onions.  I was surprised however to see that the roast pork was actually cut more like pork belly: thinner than what I was used to back in New York, but still very good.  As for the ramen, it was very rich, almost too rich.  Again, the thinly-sliced pork belly was different but still very good, with more emphasis on the green onions, eggs, and noodles than the pork and bamboo shoots.  It's much more heavy than east coast ramen and not as balanced as I had hoped for. As we left Daikokuya and walked back to the car, I kept asking myself: was that worth a 90 minute wait?  Truth be told, it wasn't.  And as I should have learned from DiFara Pizza in Brooklyn earlier this year, there really isn't any food that is worth more than an hour wait in line.  It's a very good ramen at a pretty reasonable price, but with such huge waits during peak dinner time, it's just not quite worthy of the four stars that it should earn.  My advice?  Go during off-hours when the line isn't as long, and get the regular broth instead of the kotteri.

ALL my friends were like DAIKOKUYA.. it's the best mmmmm So of course, while in LA... where do we have to hit up first? DAIKOKUYA. We came at an off time, so the wait was only about 15min (thank god because I was starvin like marvin) So as we sit, i look at the menu and think to myself, why bother? Of course I'm going to order the Daikoku Ramen.. it's what the place is named after!! My friends were telling me the tonkatsu thing was better but after i saw the explanation and hearing it from my friend as well... i decided to pass for the purpose of my waist & figure few minutes goes by then BAM.. RAMEN is served. The bowl was HUGE and i got a small... it smelled delicious. I got myself ready (but obviously I was moving too slow because my friends had already started to slurp away (ONE OF THEM WAS ACTUALLY ANNOYINGLY loud)-- this is the friend that insisted on the tonkatsu So I take a little sip of the broth... mmmm... added some garlic and hot chili  stuff.. perfect... man that was a good bowl of Ramen. The noodles were perfect, egg was good,  ughh just SO GOOD. Now, if it was a regular sized bowl of Ramen that we have up in nor-cal, this would easily be 5 stars... Orenchi yum status, but because my bowl was so big, and maybe I ate too slow, i got SUPER full. So full that after a while I just couldn't finish my ramen... I thought i was going to explode... so then I got tired of it =( Next time I come back (BECAUSE I DEFINITELY WILL), I'm sharing

Finally was able to make a trip to LA to try this place out. We parked on the street since it was Sunday and metered parking is free.  Arrived around 6pm and there was already a group of people waiting outside. We signed in and explored the stores on the street and came back to wait some more. Since we were kind of early we ended up only waiting around 30 minutes, which isn't too bad at all. Ordered the Daikoku ramen and my boyfriend ordered the Daikoku combo with the salad and fried rice. The salad was more of a cole slaw than salad since they used shredded cabbage and a mayo based sauce but it was delicious. The dressing was what definitely made it taste so amazing though! The fried rice was good as well and they use the same pork that is in the ramen in the fried rice, yumm. When the ramen arrived I was pretty surprised cause the bowl was HUGE, topped with bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, tons of scallions and a whole egg. Ohh and if you like a little kick to your ramen you can ask the waitress for the chili oil. The chili oil they have here is a lot spicier that most places though, so beware!! I took a spoonful of broth with chili oil and almost choked from the spiciness lol. The broth is intensely flavorful where I had to take sips of water after I had some of the broth. The noodles weren't my favorite (I prefer firmer noodles), but the pork was so tender that they melt in your mouth. The egg wasn't my favorite either since it was a bit raw inside and I don't really like runny yolks but perfect for my boyfriend since he loves it. I was pretty surprised I even finished the whole bowl but I had major food coma afterwards and felt like my stomach was going to explode from all the food. I think one downside for me is that they don't have spicy miso because I usually order the spicy miso ramen because I like a little kick of spiciness in my ramen. Overall, the ramen here is good, but I would prefer to stick with the ramen places in OC that are closer to me that are just as good!

Over 3,000 yelp reviews says it loud and clear. Daikoku Ramen. Big portions, rich broth without out the oiliness.  They also have sprouts which I found added a pleasant crunchy texture to the ramen.  Definitely worth it to try it out! The lunchtime wait at noon was only 15 minutes.

Ramen ... so simple ... yet so damn delicious.  And I'm not talking about some stinking "top" variety ... the kind you eat because you're a starving college poetry major ... or you're the cat lady that lives at the end of my block .. or you're the kind of person who takes the 10 for $1 special at the market and yearns to build a pyramid in honor of the ramen gods.  We're taking about the ... slow-cooked broth, hardboiled egg, savory pork, and endless supply of golden ramen noodles ... kind of ramen. So as our GRUB buddy Teresa C. hit us up for a little GRUB action, we went straight to the pending GRUB list and plucked this little gem known as Daikokuya, suggested way back in the day by GRUB visionary Kevin C., and headed downtown for a heaping bowl of ramen goodness.  But be forewarned, this place isn't exactly a hidden gem.  As we arrived at the ramen institution, we hit a line that was flowing out the door and got our name on a waiting list two pages deep.  So we waited patiently ... mouths watering ... bellies grumbling ... planning out our GRUB-formation.  And me-oh-my, the wait was totally worth it.  And not just for the homeless lady that screamed in my ear, which made me jump like a 6 year old girl and then added insult to injury by coming back 10 minutes later insisting on giving me a hug.  It was worth it for the GRUB ... the experience of Little Tokyo ... and the overall awesomeness of a giant bowl of Daikokuya miso ramen. When we got our table, the order was pretty damn easy ... of course we were ordering the infamous ramen.  And what we got was exactly what the doctor ordered ... a giant swarm of noodles flowing through a vast ocean of delicious broth.  (Okay, full disclosure, I've never had a doctor prescribe ramen.  But when I do ... let's just say ... I think I've found the one to deliver my babies).  And the broth ... my boy ... it was like they marinated the marinade and then turned it into soup.  Personally, the Good GRUB was especially partial to the hard boiled egg.  Floating through the sea of ramen ... in all it's slightly gooey-in-the-center glory ... soaking up all the glorious juices and flavors ... we're not afraid to admit we asked for a second.  The pork was tender, juicy, and delicious ... the noodles were gut-bustingly amazing ... and everything came together for one of those "the whole is more than the sum of it's parts" moments of joy. We were feeling extra saucy and went for an order of dumplings and fried rice ... which officially took the GRUB session over the "top."  Pun ... ah, I don't even know anymore.  But most importantly, was just the overall authentic experience of the trip to Daikokuya.  Next time I go back, I think I'm going to take my game to another level and get the "spicy miso ramen" ... because that's what it's all about on the wild mystery tour through tastebud-heaven ... and the endless pursuit of the GOOD GRUB.

I love that Daikokuya has only two types of ramen on the menu, and the combo provides plenty of food. The Daikokuya ramen makes you appreciate simplicity. I had forgotten how delicious simple broth can be. The donkatsu was very meaty, generous portions. Parking can be a pain, but that's the area for you. The wait wasn't too bad. But, we both ended our meal and left with bad stomach aches and this is why I give it only 3 stars. Second time in Little T that I've left with a bad feeling in my stomach. MSG?

Wonderful Ramen, long wait. We arrived around 2pm on a Saturday and had to wait about an hour. thankfully you don't have to stand there waiting if you don't want to. Signup on the list, find out about how long, and come back before that time. But if you miss them calling your name twice, you are out of luck and are crossed off the list. The food, OMG, the food. This is THE BEST ramen I have had. The broth is so flavorful and silky, the chashu MELTS in your mouth and I loved the soft boiled egg. The best iced green tea too. yum yum yum. I tried the deep fried spicy tuna wrapped in shiso as i'm a shiso freak, and it was tasty. It could not compare to the deliciousness of the ramen though. I tried the kotteri broth my friend ordered, and while good, was a little much for me. go with the Daikokuya Ramen.

So we did it....my bf and I finally went to Daikokuya.... Ever since moving to LA, we would drive / walk past this place and wonder what all the fuss was about. There is almost always a line outside the place, and after peaking a little closer we discovered that it was a ramen place. Since we're huge ramen lovers, we vowed to go someday, admittedly the line did deter us for some time. Finally one night we set ourselves on going, I call up in advance to check how long the actual wait is, a half hour, meh. We go anyway. Now here is, the deal for those that are sometimes as impatient as me, there is a list you sign your name on, with a number next to it. You can actually see how many people are in front of you. You'd be surprised how many places, especially ramen places, that don't have this. I was pleasantly surprised by this since you can easily glance at the list and size up what you're capable of doing while you wait. A server/host will peak their head outside and call your number when its your turn, giving you enough time to go walk around the block, maybe get a coffee, etc. Since we went on a Wednesday night, the wait was shorter then the actual 30 minutes promised over the phone. We managed to have enough time to walk away to grab a smoke, and come back right in time. So the little wait that we had felt like nothing. There aren't many options on the menu, but the ramen they have is insanely good. We started out with the gyoza which tasted amazing and not your typical gyoza. Daikokuya flavors their food, very well. I was impressed. We both tried the Daikoku Ramen and got it kotteri style which I think its the only way to have it after trying it. Yes, its fattier but the favor and the way it fills you up, is definitely worth trying. There is alot of care and effort that goes into making the Daikoku Ramen, and getting it kotteri style (with extra fat) so its a wonder that its so reasonably priced. I was too full to move for afew hours afterwards and didn't quite feel like having breakfast the next day, thats just how filling this stuff is. They have a nice beer/ wine selection and there is nothing like a huge Sapporo beer to go with your ramen. They offer huge bottles! The service was really fast and friendly. We didn't feel rushed at all though. We where able to enjoy our ramen at a reasonable rate, drink our beer, as well as kick back relax and chat. I recommend you come here ready to eat. Also don't let the line deter you, its not as bad as you think besides Daikokuya is worth it! PS. If you do want to wait inside, you can. They have a cute section with comics at the front of the restaurant, with a cute kitschy decor.

Goooood ramen. It's not too salty, Get the ramen with the fat added. It makes it so much better! Daikoku ramen is the one I order. Friends have gotten the full meal with the salad and the rice with pork The rice bowl with the pork is really really good. I would have done that for the added $2. Rich and cooked to perfection. I would come here again! Small place and the wait is long if you go at peak dining hours. Make reservations and get there on the dot!

My first time trying REAL ramen and I have to say Daikokuya is the best! Had to do a walking tour of little tokyo for a project and by the time we were done, I was on the brink of starvation. This place just hit the spot. It didn't matter if it was hot outside, i'd eat this ramen in any weather. Such a big portion, I wasn't even halfway through and I was getting full. I'm not a big fan of the meat, so sometimes I get it without, but nonethless this is the place to go when you want ramen.

I like this place a lot, but at night, the lines get pretty ridiculous. Prices: They're not too bad, especially when you consider the combinations & the portions you get...which are enormous! Service: Last time I came here, I asked for the salmon roe combo with my ramen & they never brought it out, but charged me for the combo. I had to ask them to correct it. Kind of glad they didn't bring it out though, only because I thought my stomach would split open if I ate another bite. I was way too full.They're a bit lax on refilling your drinks even if it's not so crowded. Service is subpar here, boo. Food: I get that new ramen item that they have that consists of cold noodles & a ramen bowl half full of delicious broth. It's absolutely nommmmtastic & I'd definitely recommend it. Their miso soup is good & their salad reminds me of an In-N-Out burger without the rest of the burger. I've yet to finish the salad because the sauce gets too filling. The miso soup that also comes with it isn't so bad, but nothing too remarkable. Environment: Small restaurant shaped awkwardly. It's kind of stuffy. The ramen bar is not as efficient as it could be. It's obvious they built it to give it an authentic feel, but if you can't hand over the bowl of ramen to the person at the bar, what the heck was the point of building a ramen bar?! Might as well just stick with a bunch of tables & a normal back kitchen. You guys might want to rethink the layout of your restaurant a little bit. Thoroughly enjoyed my ramen here & would recommend anyone give it a try if you're in the neighborhood.

Seriously? First off, the wait was ridiculous. I mean, we walked around the Japanese Village, but seriously, two hours? The food doesn't stand a chance against Orenchi. The portion appears large, but it's really because the bowl is shallow. The fried rice was just regular fried rice with some beni shoga on the side. The Daikokuya ramen was lacking depth of flavor and I had no desire to finish the broth. The only good thing about the meal was the chashu appetizer. It was nice and crisp on the edges with a melt in your mouth center. The problem is that it is super salty and comes well before your fried rice. This is a Norcal vs. Socal breakdown. Payment: Orenchi (takes card) Wait time: Orenchi Ramen taste: Orenchi Chashu: Daikokuya Soft-boiled egg: Orenchi (the egg at Daikokuya was still cold inside!) No competition.

I remember this place when it first opened! I have to say since, you won't know how ramen is supposed to taste like until you've tried this place! Everything before was really cup o noodles to me. For the longest time, this restaurant was "Woohoo! As good as it gets!". Good for us Yelpers, the place inspired competition, having just one inch it out for my taste buds. Definitely still a home run! The broth is soooo rich, it leaves a film on your lips. The cha-sui is so deliciously flavorful (because it's so fatty). The special sauce soaked egg, I can eat it everyday, it's that good. Thumbs WAY up! But as always, let me know what you think! AND.... someone congratulate me on my 200th review!

Favorite Traditional Ramen To Date. I had the GRAND pleasure of paying a second visit to Daikokuya last night.  And, although not quite as magical as it was the first time (the first time is always unparalleled), Daikokuya delivered every bit as much ramen heaven as I had anticipated - no small feat. Daikokuya's ramen is a very traditional ramen, so I may need to give Ramen Dojo higher marks in "wow" factor, but Daikokuya makes the best bowl of traditional ramen I've had yet.  Every single component is singularly flavored and of the highest quality: - The broth is meaty and thick (no need to level up on pork belly fat content, which IS an option). - Noodles are perfect consistency, chewy and thicker than the thin noodle variation (my preference) - Meat is finely cut, INCREDIBLY flavorful and falls apart to the taste - Egg is well seasoned and creamy, the middle still soft - Bamboo shoots are pickled there I'm pretty sure, not canned/purchased - Green onions, seaweed and bean sprouts are fresh and plentiful I have not yet had a bowl of ramen elsewhere where EVERY item in the bowl has blown me away.  Most places get most components right, but fall slightly short on at least one (yes, even Ippudo). All in all, Daikokuya is well worth the wait (even more worth it considering the price!!!) and I'd happily indulge my taste buds there again. and again. and again.

I don't think I have the tastebuds to determine good ramen over GOOD ramen, but this place is well... good (haha). People compare it with another place like Orochon, but honestly, I think they're very different! The soup base at Daikokuya, in my opinion, has more depth in flavor (but it's really a matter of preference). I also love that they have a donburi combo. I am a sucker for chicken donburi. Also, if you're not down for ramen, try their fried rice. it's good! I do NOT think that waiting two hours for only two people is worth it (maybe only one hour). The service is quick once you're seated though. A quick tip, drop in a like a teaspoon of the table garlic they offer. It makes a world of a difference! Oh and CASH ONLY! (there's a Chase ATM in the Little Tokyo Plaza)

If you've never been to Daikokuya, just look for the bright yellow tarp sign outside! It's always busy here so be prepared to wait.   I stopped by here with coworkers for lunch on a hot day (hot broth tastes the best on hot days, right?), and we only had to wait 10 minutes. I ordered the regular Daikokuya ramen.  Next time, I'll remember to add the kotteri style.  Daikokuya ramen in itself is standard, but what stands out to me the most is the EGG!!!  I'm not sure how they marinate it, but it tastes like miso and soy sauce?  The inside is not cooked all the way through so it's moist and bursting with flavor! The broth is really flavorful and goes well with the bamboo shoots. If you have a big appetite, go for the combination.  I recommend the ramen with shredded pork bowl. Even though I'm not the biggest fan of ramen, Daikokuya is my exception! Plus, you can check out the shops and desserts after since there's plenty of options in the plaza right across the street!

Overrated much? I'm not one to go around calling things overrated, but after waiting for our turn for near 2 hours, we were PROMPTLY sat at the corner counter, given menus, and from that moment rushed throughout the entire night. excuse me, can i hace a refill? "**** YOU!!!!!!!!!!!" at least that's what it felt like. The ramen was very oh em gee this is way too oily. It was SO oily. I guess that's why a lot of people like it. Doesn't make it good ramen. Especially since the noodles themselves didn't taste much different than pre-packaged ones. Not trying to offend the restaurant or its loving patrons. After all, it's not my palate that matters, it's yours.

Both the broth and the ramen are excellent.  I have tried most of the popular ramen places in No and So Cal, but this place is the best.  On a hot summer day, the cold ramen is very refreshing.  The fried rice is tasty and our favorite appetizer is the deep fried spicy tuna.  The spicy tuna is wrapped in shiso leaves and dripped in a light tempura batter before being deep fried.  They served it with sea salt, super delicious!  The line can get long at peak hours, but I think it was worth the wait.

Finally got to try this place with a couple of friends. We arrived around 3 and waited about 30 minutes but apparently that's a really short wait compared to the dinner rush. Wait isnt bad because it's near some shops that you can look around to pass the time. We all got the ramen combo that came with a mini rice bowl. The ramen is very good and a pretty big portion. The broth is not too salty and not too rich. I think it's the best tonkotsu ramen that i've had yet. Now if you really like RICH soup then the kotteri soup base is the soup for you. It's the tonkotsu broth added with pork fat giving it that richer taste. I think it's a little saltier too.   The rice dishes were tasty. The teriyaki, salmon roe, and chicken egg are all pretty good. The gyoza that they actually make themselves are delicious. But one appetizer that i got which were pickled vegetables were alright but not something that i would order again. Overall Daikokuya is definitely the place to go for some good ramen.

my favorite ramen place so far. this place gets ridiculously packed... the pork belly... SO TENDER. the most tender meet i've ever had at a ramen place. it just melts right into your mouth. literally. the broth is pretty creamy, really really tasty. i'd be fine just drinking that as soup. and the noddles are pretty good. i'd come here every time for a good ramen fix if i'm in the area. ohhhh yeahhh

Be prepared to wait.  And while you wait, try not to drool as you look into the restaurant (oh who are we kidding, its more of a hole in the wall with faded walls, stained ceilings, and crooked floors...but I digress) to see a packed house happily slurping away.   Once you are seated, please - don't NOT order the ramen.  If you're here for anything other than the ramen, you're really here for the wrong reasons.  Don't get me wrong - there is other solid stuff on the menu but there are many places that do all of that better.   My standard order - fried spicy tuna in shiso leaf, sausage, gyoza, ramen + fried rice combo.  And yes, ahem, I do eat all of that.  By myself.  Oh and add a couple Kirin drafts. The ramen - warm, rich, fragrant, and boasting good depth of flavor.  The noodles are cooked slightly al dente.  The egg, bamboo, pork slices, green onions, and sprouts all add perfectly to the delicious concoction.   What it all adds up to - hearty goodness that keeps you coming back for that quintessential late night meal that always hits the spot on a cold night.   I've been coming here for 12 years now and have yet to find a better overall ramen experience.  I'm sure there are others out there but in this city, I've not found any that quite stack up in my book (and yes, I've tried many).

Wish this place was in Boston! Daikokuya owners - please think about franchising out to Boston!! Came here because of all the rave reviews on yelp during my visit to LA. This puts all other ramen places to shame. Be prepared to wait at least half an hour. Be warned. It's all worth it though.

Salad, Cole slaw with thousand island and mayo. (3/5) Pork rice eel sauce (3/5) Fried rice, soggy pork corn green onions onions eggs. (4/5) Daikokuya Ramen (4/5) Salad, Cole slaw with thousand island and mayo. (3/5): Exactly as it sounds. Pork rice eel sauce (3/5) It was okay, but this is also exactly as it sounds. Nothing really stands out about this dish. Fried rice, soggy pork corn green onions onions eggs. (4/5) The fried rice was pretty good. I liked the texture of the rice. It felt almost like soul food. Daikokuya Ramen (4/5): Their ramen is good, comparable to that of Shinsengumi Ramen. The broth is good, and noodles aren't half bad, I'd say a slight notch more flavor then Shensengumi, but Santouka is definitely better. Santouka broth is more flavorful in both ramen, and soup.

The best ramen I've ever had!! I constantly crave this when I'm not in LA, and it's like one of those experiences where once you've had something SO GOOD, you really can't go back, and everything else is rather sub-par. So Daikokuya is definitely the standard in my book. Daikoku ramen has a DELICIOUS savory soup base-- I'm guessing they cook this for a long time because it tastes so hearty; the depth of flavor is incredible. I LOVE the noodles here they are springy and slightly chewy in the exact right amount. The pork is melt in your mouth gloryyyyy. I also love the soy sauce egg. Really, you can't go wrong. The wait can be long because the place is small and usually there is a line especially on weekends. Be sure to put your name down on that clipboard right when you get there... and the Japanese Captain Jack Sparrow waiter will seat you. ;) If you haven't been, go! Like ... right now.

Super long wait but totally worth it, also if you don't like to wait you can go there on their off hours like Brunch or Linner... you know the breakfast before lunch, or the lunch before dinner thing... basically a really early lunch or a super late lunch! also if you're like me and can't finish an entire bowl in one sitting, but hate to see food go to waste, they have a noodles seperate option. so , you can pack the broth and the noodles seperately to go. YAY for non-blotted noodles!!!!

You get a lot of bang for your buck at this place. Yes, the ramen is very good - rich and full bodied. I also tried the gyoza when I was there last time and it's pretty good too. It doesn't look like it was bought in the frozen food aisle and just panfried. The wait is ridiculous if you come during dinner time. We got there around 7 and we waited at least half an hour. The waiters are friendly and they did a good job of making sure we had enough water and tea, which is nice since the place was hopping.

I'm putting my foot down. I'm drawing that invisible line in the sand if you will. I came to this place on 3 separate occasions, 2 of which I didn't get a chance to eat because of the outrageous hour plus lines each time. On my third venture I got "lucky" and only had to wait 15 minutes. Needless to say, I was very very interested and excited to see what the supposedly 2nd best ramen joint in la was all about. And as those two lonely stars indicate, there really wasn't much to the ramen: the broth was plain, no depth to the flavor, the noodles were so so, the chashu very ordinary. Definitely nowhere close to the amazingness that is Santouka. Had this been a normal ramen joint without all the ridiculous hype I would have given this spot 3 stars, but since expectations can be a motherf#!%#% I left pretty disappointed. While it's not inconceivable that I'll ever come back, there's about a dozen other ramen joints in la that I'd rather go to than give this spot a second chance. I hate to be a hater, but I'm just telling it how it is.

Been going to Daikokuya for 7 years, back when you didn't have to wait 2 hours for a table for 2 and check the list every 20 minutes.  I don't know if anyone else noticed this but the quality has gone DOWN.  The pork isn't as good anymore - it used to be a different color.  They changed the fried rice recipe too.  And what pisses me off the most is that it's CASH ONLY now.  They used to take plastic a year or two ago.  I guess they're getting greedy with the gravy train that comes through there because of the insane Yelp reviews.   The ramen is still pretty good, just not what it used to be and it's definitely not worth waiting 2 hours for.

Ramen was delicious! I had heard about this place over a year ago, and it wasn't until a few days ago that I finally went and tried this place out. At first glance, I thought the food was all a bit pricey, but it's not. The ramen comes in very large bowls with lots of noodles and broth, and I was extremely satisfied and full after finishing the entire bowl. I ordered a combination: Daikoku Ramen with Pork Cutlet Rice Bowl. It was $11.95, and this was a lot of food.. a lot. I'd recommend having you and another friend both order the original ramen and a combination. This is enough food for the both of you, but each person can simply order the ramen and that's plenty. I hadn't eaten anything before coming to eat here, yet I still managed to be very full by the end of my meal. The ramen was very rich in flavor, and it wasn't plain or bland at all. Loved it. The Pork Cutlet Rice Bowl was very delicious as well, including juicy onions and a good amount of meat. Overall, this meal was very filling and tasty! Also, if you plan on coming here, I recommend coming before 4:30 or 5 because the wait isn't too long.. I waited around 15 minutes before there was an open table. So that wasn't too bad. It started getting busy like an hour later after we sat down. This is a fairly small restaurant, so seating is very limited.. thus, the long wait. The waiters were all very friendly people, and they greet and say goodbye to you all the time. You definitely want to come here and try the ramen! A large ramen bowl means a satisfied you.

I must say, this place has got pretty darn good ramen. It's probably the best ramen I've ever had. Sure, I've only been to TWO ramen places in my life...but I'll pretend my opinion is credible anyway. As you might expect from a popular ramen joint, the line was absurdly long around 8PM. Wait was about 45 minutes. Which, if I'm really hungry, makes me THE MOST unpleasant person in the world. While I was in line, I kept telling myself, "Man, this better be worth it." It was. It really was. I ordered the Daikoku Ramen without bean sprouts. And yes, I know they allegedly don't taste like anything. But I CAN STILL TASTE THEM. So leave me alone! *ahem* The noodles had great texture, the broth wasn't too salty (which was perfect for the soup), the pork was tender...and the egg. OH MAN, the soft boiled EGG! Arguably my favorite part of the whole bowl. Had I know it was going to be so good, I would've ordered two eggs in there! Service was good. The interior is a decent size (not too large, but cozy). Without a doubt, the next time I visit LA, I will be returning here. I'll probably order the Tsukemen. It looks fun.

I never really was a fan of ramen until I ate here today. The broth wasn't bland for once and was actually quite tasty. Ordering it koterri style was probably the reason behind its rich taste so I wouldn't try ordering the ramen without it.  I initially thought the portions of the noodles were pretty small because I was able to finish my entire bowl for once, (small girl=small stomach ^^) but after some time, the noodles grew in my stomach and I got very full. lol. The reason why I'm not giving Daikokuya 5 stars is because my group of 4 had to wait over an hour to get a table. It's not their fault but hey I hate waiting. Also, one of the waitresses must be having a bad day or something because she seemed pissed off and very bored which in turn made me pretty pissed off having to watch her serve us. BUT I would definitely come back here for their ramen. Soo good!

This place always has LOOOOOONG lines and is slow.  The service could use improvement, the place is on the shabby side, it had a B rating when I went, and they have clueless touches like giant paper lanterns that literally hit people on the head while they are waiting for a seat.  Daikokuya seems to be one of those places that is popular for being popular.   In a word, it's overrated. If you have a developed sense of taste, you'll taste something funky in their broth.  Yes, it's subtle, but it is the subtle flavor of ROTTING PIG CARCASS!!!  That said, the noodles had good texture and the thousand-year-old egg was delicious.  Please note that if you don't eat swine, the only items available to you on the menu are pretty generic.  Their specialty is pork ramen with nasty broth - period.

(i have a blog post on this at http://apcollective.com/…) that's pronounced "DIE-coke-ya" and it literally means "big black house". i am not entirely sure of the origin of the name, but please do contribute if you do. after a lunch at father's office and a stroll at abbot kinney & the beach, jina and i picked up a friend and headed straight to little tokyo to experience the greasy goodness of japanese tonkotsu ramen, a pork-broth based ramen with slices of braised pork. given the time we waited to get in (an hour and a quarter), anything could've and would've tasted good. but let me tell you that the ramen and the donburi were simply amazing. i ordered a kotteri (richer broth) tonkotsu-men and a butanegi-don on the side. the broth was deep and rich, the pork slices were juicy and tender, and the noodles were consistent and chewy. the butanegi-don was on par with the quality of the ramen. it's no surprise why people wait so long to eat this. a note to self: go at off-peak times (either end of the dinner time). plus: - thick, full, rich broth - fast service minus: - limited seating - long wait (there's always a crowd waiting to get in) verdict: a must-try for the tonkotsu fan.

I arrived around 2:20pm, and ran into few friends whom told me they've already been waiting for at least an hour. On the wait list, I had eight groups ahead of me. But I decided to wait anyway, because my throat was sore and I was in need of a warm and filling broth. To our pleasant surprise, we were seated within twenty minutes! Our words of advice: Go Late. Regular lunch hours mean an hour or longer wait time at Daikokuya. Daikokuya Ramen isn't customizable. You get what you order. I actually like it better that way, because you just sit and order right away without having to customize it too much. We ordered two bowls, with one being a combo with Pork Cutlet bowl. The combo dish was sub par. I don't get why I always get excited with the combos. Unless it's onigiri, I haven't tried one dish other than their OG ramen bowls that was at least decent. The ramen was good enough, with thick, hearty broth. I usually prefer ligher broths, but it was acceptable because it wasn't as greasy. The portion here is bigger than average. What sets Daikokuya apart from other ramen restaurants is their chewy noodles. It is springy and a bit undercooked, which would be perfect for my Shin Ramen. Other than that, it wasn't the best ramen I've tried, but I would definitely go back... during off peak hours.

I am SOOO FULL! Got here around 5:30pm on a Friday night. The wait wasn't too bad, as there was only 3 groups ahead of us. The turn over is fast too, as it's ramen, so not too much to prepare. The soup was really good. Bold, deep, and full of fatty yumminess. The noodles were cooked perfectly, they had this nice bite to them. Good amount of bean sprouts, and green onions (practically 1/4 cup). I wish there was more bamboo shoots. The egg was cooked really well, and I appreciate how we're given a whole egg as opposed to a measly half like majority of the joints. At this point, I'm not sure which ramen spots are the best: Daikokuya, Orenchi, Santouka, Toto Ramen, or Miki.  I'll definitely scratch Ippudo off my list. CASH ONLY!

They have some solid ramen here, but I think I expected too much after all the daiko hype and reviews. The broth was super yummy and thick, and the noodles were amajinggg. We had to ask for Siracha sauce midway though because us Koreans need the spicy. Unfortunately, Siracha sauce and daiko ramen don't mix because after that, we could only taste the Siracha sauce. It was probably a noob move on our part. Parking is annoying. Super steep prices. Lots go for a flat rate of six bucks and if you can manage to snag street parking, the meters still run at three bucks per hour. The wait wasn't too bad. We were sixth in line and waited about 20-25 minutes at around 11:30am. Cash only! (or so they say..) There was a sign that said credit card acceptable but $10 minimum... but I don't know. They have cash only signs posted all over the restaurant. I don't know what to believe. Definitely a good spot to try.

I dunno what the hype is about, I think this is a normal ramen place. I have gone here 4-5 times (not by choice) and have tried to keep an open mind about it but I never get the "omfg this shit is bomb" feeling after I stuff my face into the long awaited ( at least 40 min wait) ramen. If I had to rave about something I'd rave more about the bomb ass fried rice they have, but then again if u give me a pound of lard I betcha I can whip u up some real nice n addicting fried rice no problemo. This place is not very clean either I walked into the back on my way to the bathroom and I peeked into the kitchen and ladies and gents that heaping mound of green onions in ur ramen, rice bowls or whatever was in this nasty looking bucket in the sink with dirty ass plates and shit around it and the kitchen smelled of rotten vegetables and meat equivalent of a dumpster... No wonder they got a B rating. Now that B rating was prob when they tried real hard to clean up, I bet u on the regular basis, based on what I saw and smelled, they are barely a C most likely a D rating. Oh and btw I also had hair in the last bite of my fried rice... I bet if u put this ramen next to ramen from another decent ramen place and blindfolded urself, the only way ud tell the difference is that this one is SALTY as hell. I swear that is like the only difference. And maybe the pork here is better than other places but yeaa.... Nothing worth waiting 40+ minutes for thats for shizzle. I'm over you, I will not give u another chance at convincing me u are as awesome as these other brainwashed ppl think. So in conclusion, im over you daikokuya. I think after eating it the first time I felt like it was just okay but I almost tried lying to myself and hyping this place up just cuz I waited an hour and drove in 40 min of traffic to get here and everyone on yelp says it's good so it MUST be awesome right?!?! NOOOOOO don't believe the hype, this shit is just aite.

The line here is ridiculous, although the turnover rate is decent since it is a ramen house. For the food, first thing that comes to mind when I relish back on this experience: portion size. The standard tonkotsu ramen comes in a gigantic bowl with a generous amount of noodles and green onions, which I love. One of the best aspects is the complimentary minced garlic placed between every two seats, something that is relatively rarely seen around here. Cha shu pork is decent, but not fantastic (Santouka's special pork still reigns champ), but tastes exceptionally great in their cha shu fried rice. Broth is creamy, decently fatty, but still not as intensely flavored as Santouka's. I'd come here again if the line wasn't so painfully long and if it were closer than LT.

Wow love this ramen place. It feels so authentic inside with being able to see how the ramen is made and the pushy waiters that try to get you to eat and leave as soon as possible. We came here on a Saturday at 11:30am and the line was already out the door. We waited about 15 mins to be seated. We got two daikoku ramens and a fried rice. The salad that comes with it you can pass on. I had one bite and had enough. The fried rice was so tasty! Not too greasy either. Yum! The ramen was cooked just how I like it. And the broth was so good. I could drink it alone. The prices are good too. I believe it was about $8 a bowl. Next time I will try the dipping ramen.

One of the best ramen places in Little Tokyo! Got here around 8pm on a weekday. Definitely be prepared for a wait. The restaurant is quite small. There is a bar stool area if you don't mind not eating at a table. I would recommend you put your name down on the list and then come back within fifteen minutes. I ordered the Daikokuya Ramen Kottori. The ramen was definitely amazing and with good portions. The pork was also savory. I also ordered the Gyoza. They are crispy on the outside and are filled with tender meat on the inside. The service at the establishment was also definitely very attentive. The only hard part was the parking which is on the street. You might have to circle around a bit to find a place to park.

This is my favorite Japanese ramen restaurant. The service here is good. It does get busy during dinner/lunch time so come early. You have to try this place out if you are around the area. I ordered the Daikoku Ramen: tonkatsu soup base with pork belly, boiled egg, bamboo shoots, bean spouts, green onions and sesame seeds. The soup base was amazing. The noodles were thin and cooked to perfection. These paired with the toppings made the bowl of ramen irresistible.

We've lived a block from here for a couple years and have never gone because the lines are often quite long. Today we went with friends around 3 pm, which was a great time to go. We waited about 15 minutes, but it felt like an eternity because we were all famished. I should also mention that, before coming here, I'd not had any ramen except maruchan/top ramen/cup of noodles, so I really don't have a good frame of reference. That all said, the ramen here was absolutely delicious and I would come back here again in a heartbeat. We also ordered the chow mein, which was nearly as good. The service was fast and the waitresses were friendly. I was very pleased, and I can now see why there is great demand for this place.

I first saw this place while staying across the street at Miyako Hotel.  The long line of people waiting outside stirred my curiosity.   I came around 12pm on a Sunday with a friend and waited 1 hr.  1 hour for ramen...!  I ordered the Daikokuya ramen:  egg noodles with marinated egg, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, green onions, and sesame seeds.  The broth differed from the Korean-style ramen I am used it.  It was rich and creamy, a little too heavy for my palate.  While tasty, I'm not sure if it's worth the wait.

Yes, one star. After waiting over an hour to be seated, they only had seats at the bar available. That's fine. So we were seated at the rear of the restaurant near the bathrooms. Ugh. The disgusting odor of HORSE CACA took about two minutes before it reached us after we had been situated with our drinks. We immediately asked to be moved towards the front, away from the bathrooms. Right after that, the couple sitting next to us at the bar also requested to be moved. Wow, how does that happen in such a small restaurant. Clean your bathrooms, man! I almost lost my appetite! Anyway, we ordered the gyoza, which I thought was really good. For my entree, I ordered the Tsukemen, because I am super picky about what I put in my ramen hehe. I normally am whatevers about chashu but I loved that it was crispy from being seared without sitting in the broth afterwards. I still crave Orochon's spicyness. I don't know if I'd go back because of the bathroom odor.

This is what real ramen tastes like. People who don't know any better will think ramen comes in a styrofoam cup or has Top in its title. This is what real ramen tastes like. The broth is light but has such a great flavor and the egg is cooked to perfection where its solid on the outside and the yolk is still runny when you break into it mmmm. A bowl of ramen will run you about 8 or 9 bucks but it will fill you up and the flavor makes it worth the price. Definitely get here at least 10 minutes before 11am opening if you plan to come for lunch, believe me so will the others. After 10 minutes of opening, there will not be an empty seat! Parking is kinda tricky being Little Tokyo and all. You might get lucky and find a spot nearby on the street, or you might have a little trek to/from your car.

I'll keep it short because my 130lb lab is waiting patiently for me to take him for a walk. I do need to digest my leftovers from the famous Daikokuya... The pork bone broth ramen with the shredded pork rice bowl was worth the hour wait in the blazing LA sun during noontime. I had enough leftover to bring home to SF (separate the noodles from the broth when packing to go) and now I'm stuffed...again. Best ramen in LA for sure. I haven't made up my mind about how it compares to Dojo just yet... CASH ONLY .

after walking around little tokyo on a HOT summer day, the last thing i wanted to eat was a steaming bowl of ramen. one bowl of ramen later, i'm sweating a bit more than what is considered attractive but IT WAS SO WORTH IT. i wish i had two stomachs so i could fit all the noodles and soup inside me. all my friends know that i really dislike sweating, but eating that hot bowl of ramen on a hot summer day was absolutely delicious.

4.5 Came here again to experience the greatness of the best ramen ever. This time we only waited ~30 mins on a early sunday afternoon. With a several daikokuya virgins in our group, I recommended the kottori style daikokuya ramen. It came with ~3 pieces of the best char su (not stewed pork) since they were very tender and flavorful. The egg I gave to my friend since Im not a fan of non scrambled eggs. The broth and ramen were exactly how I remembered it, flavorful pork broth that seemed to be bouled for hours with good texture noodles. This time I ordered the extra noodles for an additional $2.50. It came with more bean sproats and green onions also. I highly recommend splitting this addition with someone else as the amount of noodles given is equivalent to an entire order of ramen. It felt like I was eating 2 bowls. I also recommend soaking the noodles asap as the noodles kinda lacked flavor until 10 mins of soaking. Overall: still the best ramen ever. If only they opened up in norcal. Come early and sign up as waits can be hours.

Everyone else has covered just about everything you can in this little place. The ramen: OH GOD YOU SO GOOD The service: They're attentive because they need yo face outta there. Price: Mid-range. Its worth it. It's as good as the endless line outside suggests. Come here at 4 PM on a weekday for a 20 minute wait. Not during summer, of course. P.S. The Unagi Bowl (Eel) was pretty good.

Solid ramen. Menu is kind of thin, so there isn't much variety as to what you can order. I got the Daikoku Ramen which is $8.50. The portion is fairly large and the broth lives up to what everyone here has been raving about; flavorful, thick and tasty broth. They kind of skimp out on your pork belly (I had like 3-4 pieces...) but I suppose it is sufficient for the bowl. The egg was my favorite part. I like my egg medium boiled, where the yolk is partially solidified and partially still liquidy. The green onions complement the bowl well along with the bean sprouts. The broth is pretty salty, as I had a cup of water along with my ramen, and got extremely thirsty about an hour later...granted I poured down mounts of the spicy seasoning into my ramen. PARKING: We paid $6.50 to park at a lot at Senor Fish, which is a quick 1-2 minute walk from Daikokuya. However, I would suggest parking at the Office Depot on 401 2nd Street. It's only another ~1-2 minute walk, but it'll save you parking money. DISCLAIMERS: Minimum of $10.00 for credit card use, otherwise it's $1.00 additional charge. We had a party of six, and there are no booths where they can fit more than four people. They did pull up stools for the other two to sit, but it was slightly awkward. Gratuity was applied to our party of six. Don't know where their cutoff is. Also, they got a B rating from health inspections...if you care. I'm a little upset I couldn't find this place on Yelp on my mobile app. I wanted to check-in! Minus 0.000000001 stars for that.

Daikokuya is one of those places that every yelper has to grace just bc it's so popular. Every time I've tried to come here for lunch the line stretches on for days. Today I was in Little Tokyo during dinner time and noticed the line wasn't that bad, or so it seemed. My group of 7 ended up waiting an hour to be seated. When we finally made it inside the restaurant, I realized how cramped it was. No wonder it took forever. Daikokuya Ramen: Obviously I have to get the house special on my first visit. One sip of the broth made me realize why this place is so famous. It was so creamy and flavorful that I just wanted to drain the bowl, but couldn't bc I had the actual noodles to deal with. The noodles themselves were chewy, but nothing special. Next, I got to the egg, which had the most perfect yolk. How they infused the yolk with so much flavor is beyond me. Then, I bit into the chasu pork, and went straight to carnivore heaven. That pork is enough to make me never even consider going vegetarian. So fatty and soft, it melts in your mouth. I didnt even come close to finishing the noodles bc of how big the bowl was. Food coma guaranteed. I am in no way a ramen aficionado, but I know a good bowl of noodles when I see it. Daikokuya is definitely a place where the wait is worth it.

This place is amazing ramen. There's not much more to say... I *really* wanted to hate this place, seeing as we had to wait 45 minutes on a weekday night at 11pm. I knew the wait was coming, and I love hating on food fads... But this place is undoubtedly worth the wait. The ramen with back-added fat is a work of art, with an unbeatable subtly- and richly-flavored broth which truly has no match in LA, and arguably in the States. It is also reasonably priced, and alcohol is as well - props to the restaurant for not increasing prices, which they clearly could do to match supply/demand (though is this good business practice, one must wonder...) Note: as well try to arrive earlier, put your name on the waitlist, and explore Little Tokyo!

After seeing such a great rating after over 2,500 reviews, I was pretty excited to see what all the fuss is about.  Let me try to make it as short as possible in bullets. - Small (that's what she said) - Long wait (about 40 minutes) - BIG bowl of ramen - Bland ramen broth IMO (I've experienced much better at a place in Irvine) - Pork bowl that came with my combination was tasty (I enjoyed that more than the ramen) Any questions?

If ramen were comparable to r&b boy bands, this little bowl of heaven would be Boys II RaMen. It's got soul, it's got flavor, and I hate to continue the Boys II Men theme, but I've waited for it "all my life". No, but seriously, thee absolute best ramen I've had, besides having it in Japan at a hole in the wall place. I've always gotten the daikokuya ramen and have never been disappointed. It's ginormous and oily(just how ramen should be). I'm drooling on my keyboard right now. It's about $7 or $8. If you haven't tried it... Go try it. Now. They are open late. Seriously. Prepare to wait in line anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour. I know pretty wide window, right? But honestly, it's worth the wait and the crappy downtown traffic. Ichiban!

I am picky when it comes to ramen. And I mean PICKY. Sometimes I won't even settle for the instant ramen packs sold in bulk at your local Costco, but as a starving college student staying up in the wee hours of the morning...well, beggars can't be choosers. I go to Japan often and get the best ramen possible while there. So naturally, I don't expect much in the States. But oh my goodness, after coming here, I knew I found something amazing. Everything about their ramen is perfect - the taste, the consistency, the meat that melts in your mouth, the noodles. I always get the combo with the unagi bowl. Both are too delicious for words. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. It's a bit of a wait, but it's worth it. Also, this place is open pretty late! I love that. Best place to get authentic Japanese ramen, hands down.

I was compelled to try this spot with my sister after reading reviews and due to the volume of reviews it had, but I wasn't blown away by the ramen.  I definitely don't dream about this place when I crave ramen on a cold rainy day. So I was a bit disappointed when my taste buds weren't screaming 5 stars. BOO.  I will say the boiled egg was perfection, but I won't be driving out of my way to this spot anytime soon. Its back to my strip mall ramen places in west LA for me.

DELICIOUS RAMEN! My friend recommended this place, raving that it was the best ramen house in LA, and with such high expectations, I can't say I was disappointed. I ordered the Daikokuya ramen, I think that's the one they're known for? IT WAS SO GOOD. I could tell it was the real deal the minute it arrived at my table. So fresh and tasty! And the broth was amazing too; I finished everything with in 15 minutes! Haha. My only qualm is that this place gets SUPER packed so an hour's wait is typical, but very much worth it! Also, parking is not too easy to come by either, there's street side meter parking and garage paid parking. Meter parking's a lot cheaper, but you're lucky if you can manage to find a spot! Despite the crowd and lack of convenient parking, I am undeterred and will definitely be returning!

I get it. Good food means lots of customers...hence the suuuuuuper long wait. But is it really worth it? Yup. The ramen makes up for it. So does the fried rice! I've heard a lot of people compare daikokuya to shinsengumi but the fact is, they come from different areas of Japan. So you can't quite compare the two styles that way. Shinsengumi's seems to have lighter broth and thinner noodles. It just depends on preference, and for me, it depends on mood. Both are great but I must say that depending on what toppings you order with your ramen, shinsengumi can get quite pricey...

Amazing, truly amazing!  Any place that has over 2,000 reviews and 4 stars you know is going to be fantastic.  The establishment is small and you write your name on a board to wait for a table or bar seat.  It's worth the wait, do it!! I got the Tsukemen and it was perfect for a warm LA day.  I also like that it helps pace you on the soup.  I always end up eating too much broth and not enough noodles.  The noodles were fresh and legit. The salad dressing was actually quite good. The chicken terriyaki, I got the combo, was probably the best I have ever had.  The pork was AWESOME!!!!!!  It was cut like bacon, thick, chunky, mouth watering bacon.  The fat melted in your mouth.  YUM!  I am still thinking about it three days later. You don't linger too long at Daikokuya, especially during lunch.  The place was packed and everyone should get their turn to enjoy.  The prices are well worth the food.  I think my combo was $12 and it was plenty!  Eating here made me miss a real city.  Why doesn't Nashville have ramen places??  So sad.  Well, I'll always have my lunch at Daikokuya to keep me warm at night.

This place is so delicious! The ramen, the gyoza, the rice, the sushi...everything! The price is decent especially for the yummy quality of the food. I LOVE the tonkotsu (pork broth)! Apparently you can get it "extra oily" (more pork fat?) to make it even more thick and oily! The interior of the this place could be better (some of the cushion stuffing is out...) and looks a bit dirty but the food more than makes up for it. The parking structure is across the street and looks pretty crowded at times. Also, there is pretty much always a crowd of people waiting for this place, so it has to be good, right? I'm from northern CA and I definitely am envious and wish we had it up here! I will definitely be coming back when I'm in the area.

Everyone comes here and gets the special ramen (with koteri) and fried rice... and it was awesome!! I love ramen. I loved the fried rice.  They really are different than other places, and I've had too much ramen and fried rice in my life to count, and yes they are some wonders at Daikokuya. My friend and I left the Bay at 6pm on a Friday night, didn't get on the 5 until 7pm, speeded down California just so we could get to Daikokuya before it closed at 1AM... and we got there at 12:12am (my bday)! Phew. But they ran out of koteri :( I bet if they had koteri it'd be 5 stars.  We begged the waitress "but... we came from THE BAY AREA......" and she said that they ran out since 5pm.  So we said "alright fine"... but I'm thinking, if they always run out, and it's always ordered.. why don't they just over stock it? I sat in front of a sign that read "card only in bills $20 and over" the whole night so when the bill came I paid with card, but they said the machine was broken so it's cash only. Long wait - waited about half an hour - 45 minutes.. but well worth the wait! I really want to come back and try the koteri. So for those of you who want to try this out, come early for lunch! Enjoy :)

The wait was worth it. I had some pretty great ramen in Irvine and in NY, but the broth was amazing (especially the...forgot the name, but basically the one where it is just ramen swimming in pork fat). I really like the option to have everything separate since I eat really slow and wouldn't want soggy noodles. I also like how you can do combos with some of their other options (get the pork rice bowl...again forgot the name) but it is just $12-15 for ramen and the rice. Also, bring CASH.

I saw the great reviews for this restaurant so decided to try it out while I was in LA. I tried the Daikoku ramen which had a tonkotsu (pork) based soup, bamboo, bean sprouts, char-siu, egg, and green onions on top. I tried it with and without their "kotteri" flavor, which is basically pork back fat added to the soup. To me, the fat just added unnecessary chunky blobs of fat to the soup which didn't make a huge difference to the taste. The grated garlic on the side made the soup taste much more flavorful and I enjoyed mixing it into my soup. The soup was very creamy and rich, comparable to ramen soup I have had in Japan, and the noodles not overcooked. The noodles tasted more like eggs than I expected. The only downside to the Daikoku ramen was the egg, which was cold on the inside and could have been a little more gooey. I also would have liked thicker soup and chewier noodles but that's just my preference. On the side, I tried the shredded pork over rice which was excellent. The sauce on the pork was flavorful and coated the pork nicely. I had to scoop up more of the rice to eat the pork because the sauce was so flavorful. The pork itself was crispy in some parts and tender in other parts so the dish had a nice variety of textures. Overall, I can definitely see how the creamy flavorful bowls of ramen and intimate Japanese style-setting makes this place a bit hit in LA. I would definitely come here if I needed some quality ramen. But if it were in Japan, it might only be just above average.

I could not decide whether to get fried rice or their legendary ramen noodles, so I ordered both!! This little joint located in the heart of Japantown, Los Angeles really hit the spot. All their ingredients are fresh and tasty, and their soup base is savory. The servings are beyond generous, and their service was great. They were attentive, but not annoying. The restaurant is quite small, and given they do not take reservations, you can be waiting for quite some time before getting a seat. The noise level is above average so for those who have sensitive ears, you may want to come at odd hours. I am going to this joint every time I return to the City of Angels.

Two words: Kotteri style. This small ramen venue has the absolute best noodles in all of Little Tokyo, possibly even the entire Los Angeles area. The savory broth is nothing short of amazing, and the delicious shredded pork sides are so flavorful that just thinking about it is making waterfalls flow from my mouth. Of course, the price is reasonable and the service is decent. I will definitely venture down to LA again to taste the heavenly ramen at Daikokuya.

I'm not sure if this is THE BEST RAMEN EVER, as some have claimed, because my only source of comparison is the maruchan instant ramen packets and this one time when I home-made ramen from Lucky Peach magazine but their recipe was wrong and it said to add 4 tblspoons of baking powder instead of 4 tspoons, and thus it tasted like alkaline ASS. But, I digress. The restaurant is very small. The waitstaff greets you in Japanese and it's all very adorable. I went in the late afternoon, as I had heard it gets crowded during normal lunch or dinner hours, but it worked well for my schedule and I didn't have to wait at all. I did have to walk across the street to get money from the ATM, because it is CASH ONLY (they've posted it all over all the walls). I just got the plain ramen (daikoku ramen), and unless you have a gigantic appetite, I think the half-size bowl would have been quite sufficient....as it was my first time there, I got the regular size because I had no source of comparison. My ramen came out fast, in under 5 minutes, which was great, because I was ready to eat. The broth was very good, clearly filled with fat. Like, so much so that I would encourage you to eat quickly so you don't get grossed out when you see all the fat separating from the rest of the broth. It was topped with chopped green onions and sesame seeds. I would have been cool with even more sesame seeds, actually. The noodles were excellent, and there was a huge pile of them that I couldn't finish. Just springy enough, while maintaining some firmness so that they are substantial to bite into. The pork was very tender, though fatty, but it was complemented by a healthy dose of bean sprouts that contrasted in texture. I only got one bamboo shoot in my bowl, which is just fine with me as I did not enjoy the bitter taste of it. The boiled egg was awesome. It is marinated in soy sauce and the yolk was not quite solid. I would have taken it a little softer, but it probably cooked a bit while it was in the hot broth. If you can finish that bowl, more power to ya. I wasn't even close and I was sitting there eating for 30 solid minutes. I recommend going by yourself because there is not a polite or attractive way to eat ramen. As it should be, I think. The servers were very nice and I enjoyed sitting at the bar, where I got to watch the chefs flattening pork cutlets and frying tempura. I would definitely come back but not when I'm with a group or during peak dining hours.

Ramen will always be my comfort food.  When I'm sad, and heartbroken, I eat ramen.  There's something about the feeling of eating newly prepared ramen.....it gives me that warm feeling in my chest, my stomach, to the very atom of my soul.   It's like sunshine, the ramen's warmth reminds me of a good hug. I've been here so many times when I'm not sad though.  Maybe it's the company?  Rebuilding new memories, but still recognizing a certain pattern.   The lady do love the koteri flavor.  It's far thicker.  I've grown to love it as well.   Sometimes, oh so so so "liking" grows on a person.  That's what happened with this one.

We love Daikokuya!! We have been coming here for years. They serve Tonkotsu Ramen and they do it very well. The broth is very porky, as it is supposed to be, but if you are not into that, you should check out a ramen place that serves more of a Shio broth. I like the appetizer salad which is shredded cabbage with a 'better then 1000 island' dressing. The dressing is just very creamy and we dig that. The shredded pork bowl is delicious. The braised pork belly, the caramelized onions, raw green onion meshing with the pickled ginger and eel sauce is just a party in our mouth. They don't do take out but sometimes I force the issue and order two bowls of soup, make them serve it, take a bite and then ask them to pack it up. I know it's ridiculous but it's their rule, not mine. They most recently switched to cash only which sucks but as long as they keep their prices down, I guess it's not that big of a deal. Parking is anywhere you can find it. They have a few booths and a ramen bar. There is almost always a wait so try to come earlier or later to avoid the lunch and dinner rush.

I can't get enough of this place.  Really, just the best ramen around.   If the possibility of waiting up to an hour or more during peak hours just to get in scares you, then you're weaksauce!!  You won't know what you're missing out on!   It IS worth the wait, ALWAYS.   (Just don't bring a huge party and you can generally avoid this problem. )   There's really not a whole lot I can say, that hasn't been said before.   Get the ramen- why else would you come here? Get the ramen combo w/ pork bowl if you're feeling hungry- deliciousss. Blah blah blah.  Stop reading all these reviews that just echo how amazing this place is and try it for yourself!  You won't be disappointed.

This place generally has a long wait and they've snobby rules like everyone must be there before you can be seated. After you've been seated, they won't allow you to add people to the table. Just saying... Overall the meal has value. For $12 or so, you can get a bowl of noodles PLUS a rice dish. It's a great deal IMHO. The beer on tap are cheap too -- Kirin for $2.50. The noodles are good. Broth is authentic. Other than that, I don't think this place is worth a 45 minute wait which is the amount of time I waited on a Tuesday night at 8PM.

Been coming here since I was in college.  Consistently good food.  Everything on the menu is great, but I have to give some extra props to the House Ramen + Shredded Pork bowl combo.   Only gripe about this place is that it's almost ALWAYS packed and you'll definitely be waiting at least 30 minutes; also, unless you have the whole party there, they won't seat you.   Parking is another issue, there will probably be no street parking, and if you find a spot, be sure to read the signs because you will be ticketed if it's a 15 minute only zone.  Best is to just dish out the 3-6 bucks around the paid lots they have all over the place.

It was my first time at this place. My friend recommended for a hangout dinner. We had a party of six. The wait wasn't as bad as it looked. The place is pretty small though. Despite the looks of the place, the food was amazing. This is probably my favorite place for ramen. For ramen, everything is based of the broth. And this broth was amazing. The noodles was well-mixed with broth. It had the broth's taste without drinking it while eating the noodles. The broth wasn't as salty as some other ramen places. The ramen bowl comes in one size bowl and it was huge. That was a filling bowl of ramen. After eating all the noodles, I just wanted to drink the broth as well, but I was too full to do so. I only tried their restaurant name ramen, Daikokuya ramen. And I would like to go back for some other time. There are three other locations: Monterey Park, Costa Mesa, and I think the last one was in Rowland Heights.

I think most Angelinos agree, 1)LA is the best place for ramen outside of Japan 2)There are the top 3 in LA and then the rest.  Daikokuya, Jinya, Santouka. Behold mere mortals.  What is probably one of the best ramen bowls you can get outside of Japan.  But lets not kid ourselves, ramen is like pizza.  Its good but not wait 2hrs good.  If you can get here on a weeknight before 7, you're set.  Must checkout, must avoid on weekend nights...

So...just a disclaimer, I was slightly drunk when i ate here - ok pretty drunk. That being said... I'd heard great things about this place from friends, and wanted to explore the downtown area more so me and a buddy decided that we were going to drop in for a late dinner. We ended up getting in at around 8pm and went out barhopping while on the waitlist...and didn't get served until 10. So if you're going for dinner...show up EARLY. What almost everyone has said is pretty much on point; Daikokuya is definitely one of the better Ramen places in town. It's got everything I'm pretty much looking for in Ramen - noodles cooked down so they retain a somewhat chewy texture, but tender enough so that they aren't difficult to eat, chasu pork so tender that it melts in your mouth, and a broth that provides the perfect amount of balance between richness and flavor without overdoing it on the salty side. Definitely pair the ramen with a side of their shredded pork bowl, which is absolutely fantastic as well. Even though it might be a little pricey for the poor college student, it is definitely a LOT of food and a LOT of flavor. And be prepared to have someone drive you back; I was ready to pass out from food coma after i finished. TL;DR Bomb Ramen. Kotteri broth = even more bomb. Get it together with Shredded Pork Bowl. Show up early. I'll be coming back.

Simply the best ramen in LA! The broth is so savory and the pork so tender. Their fried rice is the best I've ever had and their appetizers are amazing too! Caution: -Accept no substitutes: the Daikokuya in Hacienda Heights simply doesn't measure up to this one. -They only take cash now. -Come before 6PM if you can, or you risk waiting a long time in line. -You will quickly become a ramen snob when going to "lesser" places like Santouka and Shinsengumi (both good, but nowhere near the same class).

Dai-ko-ku-ya... I'm a little embarrassed to say it took me no more than 5 seconds to fall in love but no less than 5 months to remember the name.  Hey, I'm not Japanese! Here's what I do know: Ramen is more than just a noodle soup, it's an art, and should be judged as such. It is NOT a package of dried noodles that you add boiling water to, although, without this package we might not be able to enjoy this little slice of heaven today.  If you want to understand this dish start with wikipedia and depending on how much time you want to spend researching you could probably compile enough information to write a thesis on it. Personally, I'd rather just eat it. A lot less work! If you're in CA and want to enjoy this dish go to Daikokuya. Having said that, if your're not going to take this ish seriously just stop reading now (pause for affect)...   As you might have gathered, I'm passionate about this dish. So much so, I invite you to find a better example and tell me about it.  Keep in mind it's not how hot you can make it or how many flavors you can cram on a menu (as seen on TV).  I've tried many other places and it always comes down to the purity of the ingredients, more specifically, the broth and the noodles. Daikokuya does it right!  I don't know what they do but the broth is off the hook, the noodles are perfectly al dente and on top of that they don't skimp on the best pork out of any place I've been. Tip 1: Of course order the Ramen but get the fried rice too.  Best fried rice cause they use the broth to make it. Tip 2: Very important... The wait is long. Up to an hour because it's just that good! Don't let this detour you. Put your name down, walk over to Far Bar, relax, have a couple drinks and your table should be about ready.  These two places together make the perfect night!

We decided to come to Daikokuya on our trip to LA based on the reviews.  Yes, there was a line up and we had to put down our name on the list.  The wait was maybe 0.5 hr. We tried to Daikoku ramen which had a lot of content and filling.  I think it had too much MSG for my liking as I got pretty dehydrated later on. I tried their California Rolls and they were probably one of the best that I have tasted.  For further context, I always order California rolls at any Japanese restaurant that I try. The service was good too.  Even though the restaurant was busy, the server attended to us regularly. On my next trip to LA, I will come back and try more of their sushi.

Ok the ramen here is pretty bomb. They have a limited selection and there is a huge wait to get in but get the decked out bowl of ramen if you go. The broth is just so tasty. Check out my other reviews on ramen spots. I would say that the ramen broth just tastes like a lot of care went into it. I'd describe it as a homecooked version of ramen. I had dinner with a friend before she went off to Wharton so the company was great too.

We both ordered the house ramen and had leftovers enough when combined made a whole bowl again... We will be back! Ty yum!

review for Daikoku ramen and Tsukemen both koterri: Put your name down go get a drink nearby , come back (1 hour -2 hours0 AND ENJOY AMAZING RAMEN Fresh ramen noodles are made in the restaurant. Amazing broth and pork. Ask for the koterri. It is pork with extra pork fat so it is rich and greasy. Share an healthy appetizer and a Tuskemen in order not to have to doggy bag.

I certainly understand the long lines to get into this place. I was with an Ex-pat who has lived in Japan for 12 years. He was excited about the Ramen because he lives in an area known for it's Ramen. He loved it. So did I. The stock was obviously slow cooked. Everything was well seasoned and the veggie toppings were fresh and crisp. We had the Tonkatsu (pork cutlet) and qyoza appetizers. They were delicious as well. The portions were generous and the service was swift but very friendly. It looks like a diner with red booths and everything, and that was what the food was like -- Japanese comfort food. I can't wait to go back!

Drove to this place with my girlfriend from Arizona State in Tempe and must say that the 5 hour drive AND 1 hour wait were well worth the delicious ramen noodles we annihilated. I highly recommend getting medicated before enjoying this euphoric combination of intense flavors. The broth is the most essential part of ramen, having said that, THE BROTH IS BEAST! So get medicated, and get ramen! Go!

I really don't get down to LT as much lately, it's probably been more than 5 years since my last visit to Daikokuya. Back then it wasn't such an major endeavor just to obtain a seat here, and I remember having the time to try many other things on their extensive menu besides the Ramen. On a recent Omakase dinner in the Miyako Hotel (at Tamon Sushi) across the street out Itamae explained to us that Daikokuya is part of their restaurant group, which now includes several eateries in the LA area. He was the opening chef's at Daikokuya many years ago and was able to explain many interesting things about the menu design. I arrived at Daikokuya somewhat late in the evening, they were filming some Fast & Furious type cars down the street. LT seems to be more of a hipster hang out rather than a center for Japanese Culture. As many others have said it seems that the Japanese are moving off to Sawtelle or Torrance to escape this area!! Being so late and I was alone my wait wasn't that bad, I was able to score a counter seat within ten minutes. Daikoku Ramen and Gyoza, was trying to keep it simple. Instead of the crescent moon shaped gyoza, these are the straight/long shaped dumplings, buried under a mountain of green onions. Definitely made "in house" and always a good start!! They do serve a good Tonkotsu Ramen here, ordering it "Kotteri" is a must. The marinaded, softly boiled egg being left whole is always a favorite. They do seem to use an excessive amount of green onions here and I'm not a huge fan of bean sprouts in Ramen, but these are just my preferences. All in all a good bowl of Ramen, but I would really like to return to try their other menu offerings. With this place being so packed and chaotic I will probably not return to this location, the Daikokuya in Costa Mesa sounds much more inviting.

I've been here 2 times now and i want to go back already... we got there a little bit after it opened and waited about 40 minutes (worth it). I got the daikoku ramen ... the broth, the pork, the noodles, everything is just so good. its the best ramen i've so far in my life. Its about $8.50 for a bowl of ramen that i couldn't even finish. The place is small but nice, and the staff is nice & friendly. The wait is worth it, and like others have said, there's plenty to do while you're waiting. Its overall a great experience.

I don't know why I would come here on a muggy, humid, hot day. I was sweatin' bullets in the small, cramped, and HOT room of a restaurant! Anyway, back to the food... Ima keep it real simple: Kichimen. (or) Daikokuya. Sliced pork belly. Orgasmic. I would stay away from the 3rd option on the menu. It was extremely salty. Also, if you're planning to get the Kichimen, have them add all of the noodles, broth, meat, veggies and egg in the bowl. The dipping style they offer makes the broth lukewarm. Yuck! As for the staff.. I can't. At least, I can't write about them without using words like "rude", and "bitch", and "has a terrible attitude" and "come at me hoe". But overall this place is dope. You'll spend like $12 so it's relatively cheap for LA :) I don't know if you want to be around this area at night though... Someone robbed a blind lady when I went. A BLIND LADY. WTF?!

Ambiance: The place is TINY and always crowded! It does have decoration though, so better than nothing. Price: Decent for a meal. Service: Lines are always long and the wait is terrible, yet people still eat here. Why? Because of the "back fat" and secret sauce in their salads. The staff works fast and efficient though. Location: Metered parking and lots to pay by hour/day are available around the block. Food: We usually order a combo and share. ~Ramen with "back fat" http://www.yelp.com/biz_… ~Shredded Pork bowl http://www.yelp.com/biz_… ~Side salad with secret sauce http://www.yelp.com/biz_… All are very delicious and flavorful. Once you try the "back fat" in the ramen... other ramens do not compare! Also have tried their Tuna sashimi bowl and shredded beef bowl... mmmmmm! Story: All my friends enjoy this place, the only gripe is the wait and how far it is from where we live. It's definitely a great place to enjoy some authentic japanese food though! Tips: ~Avoid parking and long lines during rush eating hours. Avoid going in HUGE GROUPS.

After anime expo, my friend and I were looking for a place to eat ( i didn't know why we did when we weren't that hungry ) and  this place was actually the first place I bookmarked, but of course, I wouldnt drive all the way up here just to eat ramen when I have a really good ramen place way closer to me. The line was ridiculous .. We waited for about 2 and a half hour? People from anime expo were crowding this place. I was so happy that we finally got seated. Oh, they also call you by numbers, not your name so you would have to remember your number ( which is pretty odd but whatever ) My friend and I ordered their ramen with tonkatsu fat in it or whatever it tells you in the menu in a white box. The broth was actually pretty good, I kinda like it better than the salt ramen at Santouka. The egg has some pretty good flavors inside of the yolk. The chashu pork didn't taste cheap like Santouka. The noodles were like perfect too. The only thing I didnt like about my ramen is that they overflowed my bowl with bean sprouts, which I hate. I love the salt ramen but they just didn't have what I like which is the spicy miso or the kim chi one that I usually get at santouka. It was a good experience regardless.

I've always been hesitant to check out this place just because I hate waiting but came here for a first date so I figure I'd be amenable and go with the flow.   We put our name on the super long list and headed to Far Bar for a drink and some live music, which was a GREAT idea since 40 minutes passed by just like that and bam, our table was ready.   Started off with their gyoza which was decent but of course, the real reason we were here was for their ramen.  I was tempted to try their kotteri style but I figured I should go for the original first, as a baseline.  I gotta say, their broth is really deep and rich and I can't imagine having a few spoons of kotteri style broth before going into porky fat coma.  Noodles were good, the pork was yum and their egg was so flavorful and perfectly cooked!  I loved that garlic paste-y thing but yeah, being on a date, I restrained myself and only put an itty bit.   The guy is no more but my love for Daikokuya will last for a very long time :)

Not that this place needs another endorsement from me, but I will give it to them anyway!! Came here on a Thursday at 9pm and it was so packed we had to wait about another 30 to 40 minutes before we can be squeezed into the bar seats with a plastic cover that protects us from the grease splatters of the kitchen.   It was hot.  It was busy.  It was packed.  The atmosphere was lively and the ramen was steaming. I got the Daikokuya Ramen with a bowl of shredded pork.   The ramen was definitely above par.  It must be the broth, and the pork slices were tender and yummy and flavorful.  And there was even half an egg.  I felt so loved.  Grade: A The shredded pork bowl was so good!  I still think about it.  It must have been the sauce.  The smell of it.  Perfect good and tasty.  Grade: A The only thing is the wait is long and the seating is not great as you are squeezed side by side on a bar, and the service is really fast.  Which is good but not when you are trying to talk and get to know someone.  So maybe not great for a date but okay for like, just getting some food with a pal, or even alone.  They could probably seat you faster....  Like a single rider at Magic Mountain or something.

I was craving ramen, so the search began; search engines, Facebook, emails etc. and after about 30min I settled on trying out Daikoku in Little Tokyo / DT. First thing we saw upon arriving, was a long line of young hip people, so we figured we should be either in for a treat or these hipsters were just that, hip! After a relative short wait we were seated in a funky/cool booth in the narrow restaurant, with great Japanese metal advertising signs on the walls. Our waiter was awesome, fast, fun and personable.  He recommended the Daikoku Ramen, which was an absolute hit.  This is a huge bowl of awesomeness, the flavors are insane, the meat is tender, egg is cooked to perfection and the noodles could not be done any better, nice and al dente, not mushy or hard, but perfect! This is the perfect place for a funky, inexpensive dinner out, but remember it's cash only! Been back a couple of times and it's still fantastic!

R-A-M-E-N! Melt in your mouth pork belly ramen! I love ramen. I hate pork belly (too fatty and chewey). Daikokuya has mastered the art of makin pork belly taste magnificent! I catch myself craving their ramen in the middle of the day, at night, and while I'm at work! One order comes in a huge bowl and is more than enogh to fill you up. Their Ramen is by far one of the best I've had. I guess that's why there is always a long line outside. Luckily, we got there at 5:00 pm (after work) on a Wednesday, and we didn't have to wait. The downside: I got the eel rice bowl as well, shared the gyoza and tuna roll with a few friends and each of those things were not too good. I guess I'll just stick with the ramen. The weird: The booth we sat in felt like everything was tilting, so it felt like I was going to fall out of my seat. Plus I was wearing my work flats (which have a small heel on it) and I must have nearly slipped and fallen 27+ times. I guess it must be the tile. Oh well. Next time tennis shoes.

Waited foreverrrr to get a table in this little place. It's hole-in-the-wall sized, but now it's so popular and over hyped that our group of 7 (large, yes, but other smaller groups had to wait just as long) had to wait an hour and a half just to get a cramped little table in here. Maybe I'm just a little bitter because I couldn't eat their famous ramen. Ramen places usually have a vegan/vegetarian miso broth option, but not Daikokuya. Vegetarians, beware!! There is pretty much nothing for you to eat. I however, am pescetarian, and ordered 2 appetizers, the tuna roll ($4) and the fried spicy tuna ($5.5) The tuna roll was good, but nothing special. The fried spicy tuna was actually really good, however. It's spicy tuna wrapped in a shiso leaf, then deep fried. It came with a slice of lemon, and some sea salt, and was really good! I loved it. The 2 appetizers filled me up pretty well, and I ended up paying ~12 dollars. + I was sad about not being able to eat their ramen, but my friend gave me a taste of his. And it was delicious!!!! The noodles were soooo good (and I know I'm not supposed to have the broth, but I did taste some, and it was delicious). I'm really sad about missing out. :( And the ramen is cheaper than my 2 appetizers! Service was good, everyone was nice, and the orders came out pretty fast (a lot faster than we were seated, for sure). I recommend this place to everyone, just expect at least an hour wait.

Ventured down to LA on Labor Day and hoped that there would be good places open for lunch.  Luckily I didn't need to worry, I think there were more places open than there are on a normal weekend...people need to eat!  And my favorite ramen place was open too, and packed, so we put or name down and prepared for the wait.  I think it was nearly an hour, which was fine with all of the shops and the market across the street.  We finally got seated at the bar and put in our orders.  I got the combo with ramen and sashimi.  The service was fast even though they were busy (which would explain the missing sashimi until my ramen was half gone....) so we got our food quickly.   Everything was awesome and tasty and completely justified the long wait.  Easily the best ramen I've had in the US (and since I've never been outside the US, that makes it the best ramen in the universe).  The pork was super tender, falling apart into delicious flavorful pieces with just a little touch.  The noodles were full of the broth flavor, the broth was steaming hot and delicious.  I was a very happy camper!  The sashimi side was also awesome.  Huge pieces of sashimi that were super fresh and tasty.  The seaweed stuff was a good little addition and the sushi rice was delicious.  I know, white rice, but it was extra good, I swear! Just writing this review makes me want to go back.... definitely one of the best ramen places around and definitely my favorite.  If only the wait were shorter, I would be able to come here almost daily! And the price is so reasonable it wouldn't break the bank either!

I hate to go against "best in LA"...no I don't! Daikokuya was good, but not great. The ramen bowl has super yummy pork broth and about 14 pounds of noodles, but the meat (both in the soup and in the bowl) are inedible because they are at least 80% fat. Ok, back to the pro: The servers are on the ball and super friendly. That says a lot in a fast-paced environment with high customer turn-over. And again with the cons: The place is run down in that "old world charm" kind of way, grimy, and the trip to the bathroom makes you wish you were wearing Depends. And there's the one hour wait.

My son and I dropped in on this place when our first choice happened to be closed. He started to warn me, as we walked over, that there's always a line and a long wait. Well as we got there neither of the two happened upon us. He was sorry it wasn't crowded, he likes it when the staff starts yelling orders over the din of the customers and the noodle slurping. I on the other hand adore a quiet place. The staff couldn't wait on us fast enough and no sooner had we ordered that our food arrived. His being the chicken teri-bowl and mine was a small teri bowl combo with the house special noodle bowl. It was huge and just the right amount of hot, not scalding but not tepid either. Heaps of noodle perfectly cooked, scallions, sliced pork belly (my first time and I really liked it), bean sprouts and ginger. I put some garlic in and began my arduous attempt at finishing it. This bowl is big and deep. So much so I had to take a breather half way down. A look of curiosity crept over his face as to why I was so determined. He said, "you can take the rest home you know." Yes I know but dammit I'm going to finish this thing. And I did. We walked back to the car, I waddled, and with full stomachs we drove our way home in the din and dirge of rushing no where traffic. I let out a belch both deafening and humorous. I even cracked the windshield ;) And bring cash. Just cash. Signs posted everywhere indicate that no cash, no noodle. Or you'll miss out on one of the best burps you've ever had.

This place is AMAZING when it come to Ramen! I got the Tsukemen "Kotteri style" and I was hooked the moment I tried it. And like a addict , I had to go back for more the next day, it was that good! I also tried the Gyoza, but I was not too fond of them, which is something I dont say oftem when it comes to pot stickers. Next time I go, I will have to try something else...I say that now, but when I go back I will most likely get the same Tsukemen as I have all the previous times. The place is small but comfortable  with great service. I HIGHLY recommend this place. FYI- It's a top rated eatery on YELP which I had found out when I got there.

One of the FEW gems in J-Town. Daikokuya serves solid, authentic ramen! It's pretty obvious they're doing something right when the line/wait can make you wait nearly an hour sometimes for a delicious bowl of their ramen! Portions are big and the aroma always gets you when your bowl first arrives. Koterri for an extra fatty-kick to your ramen! Other than the food being spectacular, do be warned, the wait has been getting longer and longer with every one of my visits... almost to the point where I don't visit here as often.

Okay, I'm gonna be review #2576.  Oh well. There's something to be said about a restaurant that's been reviewed over 2000 times.  That's testament in and of itself.  The ramen is indeed very tasty, and so is the fried rice.  The oyako don was meh.   The lines are crazy though!!!  Expect to wait 30-45 min on a good day.  I would rather go to Santoku in West LA.

Daikokuya doesn't take reservation... You have to have to put down your name then wait... usually my appetite builds up during this wait, it can go from 10 minutes to an hour or more.... They have a waiting area with manga and the decoration of the place is really neat. I have now been there 10-15 times in the past 3 years, and everything single time I get their traditional Ramen and each time the chef is on! Now, is it good for you? Maybe, maybe not... Is it affordable? Yes definitely! Does it taste good? Oh yeah!! I love them :)

So you can get a smaller size bowl here for $.50 that visually has a better soup-to-noodle ratio, but when the soup tastes like all the best parts of life, WHY WOULD YOU? I really like how for such a high volume place as well you can request just how cooked you want your noodles to be, and they have some great sides (and if I ever grow an extra stomach, this is the first place I'll go for I will indeed require a combination salmon roe or unagi don with my ramen). Someday I will try the ramen with the extra back fat and it will probably push me over the edge and become literally my last meal. It'll be life's last love letter :) Also, please please make liberal use of the garlic they offer you on the table. It's basically pureed so they can get five cloves of garlic's worth of garlic in one spoonful.

Absolutely the best ramen I have ever tried! Just...don't think about your arteries while you're eating it. :) It's definitely filling...one bowl and I was stuffed. But you really feel like you're getting your money's worth at the same time. Only thing is the wait is always long because it's such a small venue for being so popular. The other location is a little better in terms of wait, but make sure to pay attention for your name to be called! You don't want to lose your spot! I got the Daikoku Ramen and the pork was so tender and the soup was so delicious...flavorful but not too salty. I would definitely wait in line again for this, if I have the time to!

The ramen is legit here. Is it worth the over hour wait? I'm not sure... I'll just touch on the taste of the food because it's great, it's worth half an hour wait, but an hour is a little long for ramen. I think by the time we got seated, I was already over it. (I'm not a huge ramen fan to begin with) The service was really good, the waiters definitely took care of us (we sat at the counter). If you compare the ramen to Aijisen, it is definitely WAY better... my suggestion is to visit if you have time to wait, if you're in a rush... go somewhere else. Taste great though! I'm a fan of this place.

Daikokuya had great and attentive service, cool vintage japanese posters inside, and great cheap ramen However, they load this ramen with a lot of MSG, which is not bad in doses, but this place used a lot that, next thing you know, i woke up in the morning thinking i just got my wisdom teeth pulled out again.  I like the Chashu-pork.  Tender and moist than most ramen joints.  And the bamboo shoots were cooked just right.  But this place goes too far with their MSG.  I eat a lot of chinese food too, and this was more than I was used to.  Plus my friends said they found a piece of eggshell in theirs.  That's not good.   I'd come back...just hope it's not another 2 hour wait for the same ramen I had last time.

This is easily one of the top 3 ramen shops in Los Angeles.  The noodles, soup, and the side bowls are all among the best I've tried.   If I lived close by and there was no wait, I could eat Daikokuya ramen 3-4 times a week.  No joke.   The problem is the wait.  I hate waiting.  Honestly, who likes waiting?  Standing outside for an hour to eat ramen (even the best ramen) just makes the whole experience less enjoyable.  The other location in Monterey Park has a shorter wait, but is now even farther from me than Little Tokyo. My recommendation is the kotteri ramen and the sashimi bowl.

The first time I went, I was not impressed as I had overly high expectations.  The second time I visited, I almost had a religious ramen experience of a supernatural Asian kind.   Now, when I get my bowl and before taking my first slurp of the rich pork broth, I bow my head down in deep respect to the Ramen god and the Daikokuya master broth maker. I'm transformed into a little girl being comforted by her mother with a bowl of salty goodness. I purposely go there by myself on Sundays when street parking is free and  I can get seated at the counter faster than having to wait hours for a table.   I'm not a fan, however, of their other food.  I've had the gyoza, tonkatsu, pork dishes etc,  They all come up short compared to the Daikokuya ramen.  B-E-S-T  R-A-M-E-N in L-A!  Plus, you get a free facial from all that steam. Come on people, try to find a better bowl!  Those that don't like it are not ramen connoisseurs or are unfamiliar with it.

first try was a long wait late night. no ramen since we were too hungry second try was mid afternoon with a small wait = bingo! out comes a bowl filled with a delicious and fatty pork broth and loaded with tasty fresh ramen.  with this many reviews for a teeny hole in the wall...there certainly are some dedicated and nutty ramen eating yelpers.

'Er, I really don't see the hype to this place.  There's two ramen flavors to choose from, and I had the soy sauce.  I also asked for hot sauce and was given some sriracha-don't they have their own special kind? The server was super bored and we could tell she didn't want to be there-we had to repeat what we wanted, and my friend never got an extra spoon since he dropped his (they should leave spoons on the table btw, along with chopsticks). So this bowl does come with a full egg which is nice (many others charge), but it was a bit hard.  The broth is good and actually didn't need hot sauce, so props to that.  Although at the same time, this ramen didn't stand out from any other joint.  The pork was also too small and hard-I like it nice and juicy, and crispy (there's places that flame 'em to give you that extra crunchiness). Free parking isn't until 8pm, and when I got here at 5pm on a Monday, it was half full (not half empty :P).  But after my meal, there was a line filling up from outside.  Oh, and there's cash only signs all over the place, just in case you missed out on that note.

Best Ramen Ever! I can't find decent ramen in San Diego so I will always make an effort to stop for a bowl of ramen at this place everytime I drive to LA.   Love the Ramen and Eel bowl.  The best combo.  Very much worth the wait. Service is great.  Very friendly staff.  Atmosphere reminds me of ramen noodle shops in Japan.

Broth was luke warm and bland. Ramen was loaded with green onions and bean sprouts. Yuk! Don't get me wrong, i like bean sprouts served with Pho, not with ramen.  Gyoza was noting special. If the fried rice wasn't  somewhat delicious, my rating would be 1 star. I just don't understand the quantity (roughly 3500) and quality (4 star average) of reviews. LA must have better Ramen restaurants than this. Daikokuya can't possible be the best. Again, I may have been overly generous giving Daikokuya 2 stars.

I currently reside in New York and am a huge fan of Ippudo's, which for those who have not been nor heard of the place, it's the most well known Japanese ramen joint in Manhattan and should I add, it's the most reviewed restaurant in the city on yelp. During my visit to LA last month, I finally got to try Daikokuya, which I've been told has the best Japanese ramen in LA. I'd say one thing, I left the place with a huge disappointment. Ramen was way too salty and so was the fried rice that came as a combo. I found nothing special about this joint, place was too small and felt like I was at a local chinese restaurant. Maybe Ippudo's has got me spoiled, but Daikokuya definitely isn't a place I'd be thrilled to visit again.

Daikokuya = Extremely packed. Before my first encounter with authentic ramen, I had been slumming it with Top Ramen packages from the grocery store. Mind blown! The ramen is delicious. The broth has a lot of flavor, and the meat is tender + I liked the egg. This is my second time here and I like the atmosphere and the strange host. My friends and I are waiting next to the manga and we hear the host yell something. Now we're intrigued because we realize he's yelling something every time he seats a party. And every single time we have NO idea what he's saying and I don't even think he does either. it's frickn' incomprehensible. Anyways... I ordered the: Daikou Ramen with added kotteri for flavor. The kotteri is back fat added to the broth and it was WAY decadent. The kotteri is like a delicious heart attack in a bowl. I was most definitely slurping. I also ordered the Gyoza an I highly recommend it. It had the best flavor (the good "fatty" kind of flavor). I wanted to be rolled out of Daikokuya after I was done. Pretty much the best feeling in the world. *My only remark is that the broth should be hotter.

Overhyped. Decent prices. Long lines. As with any over-hyped restaurant, I usually come out disappointed. It did not blow my mind. The only thing I particularly liked was the broth. It wasn't overly salty or oily, since most ramen broths are. The egg for me by far the most disappointing part. I always look forward to biting into the egg, but not this time since it was WAY over cooked. (The correct way would mean the egg is cooked half raw, perfectly) There was not much flavoring from it either. The noodle itself wasn't horrible but could have been a bit crunchy in consistency. (It's hard to explain! Not the crunch you would get in a cookie or what ever. Hopefully some people get my drift) However, I did enjoy their pieces of pork. I had big pieces not completely consumed with lard. Overall, it wasn't worth the 45 minute wait in the cold. Orenchi Ramen back home trumps this place x10.

Hi, my name is Jackie and I'm a ramen addict. I admit, before I became a ramen connoisseur (hehe), I didn't care for Daikokuya too much. I thought it just tasted like any other bowl of Asian noodles. Oh, what a fool I was! Rich creamy broth, chewy curly egg noodles, tender chunks of slow cooked pork belly, topped off with an OH-SO-PERFECTLY boiled egg with its insides still oozing (oh sorry, forgot to mention, I'm also an egg addict). I look back now and I don't know what I was thinking. Insane in the brain maybe? I will point out that I'm really not a fan of the kotteri flavor. I made Nam get it last time because I wanted to try it, but yeck, I couldn't even stand looking at it. There are literally chunks of fat floating EVERYWHERE in your soup. There's no way to get away from it! Save meee...just kidding. The flavor was good, but I'd stick with the original. Another plus about Daikokuya is that they really give a huge portion for the price. Before they bring out your bowl of ramen, there's a little bowl of salad which is quite delicious. Don't fill up on it though. You want to save room for the foodgasm that awaits you! We always upgrade to the combo for a few bucks more. The fried rice and shredded pork bowl are our favorites. So good. The gyoza's an awesome little appetizer too. Packed with flavor. As a warning, this place is seriously jam packed all the freaking time. It's okay! --Get your butt over, put your name on the waiting list and go shopping in the plaza across the street while you wait. As for parking, we like to park in the Yogurtland plaza and walk over. I'm always scared the security guard will catch me, but I just cross my little fingers my car will still be there when I'm doing eating hehe. Nothing can keep me away!

The best ramen I have ever had. Sure, there is usually a wait (on the last trip we waited 20 minutes on a Tuesday afternoon) and the place is basically a hole in the wall BUT the food is worth it! Two quick tips: 1) Get your ramen kotteri style. It's the only way to go. 2) Get the combo with the small shredded pork bowl. Heavenly. Total is a little under $12. You'll thank me. And you're welcome. :)

Everytime I'm standing in the cold, waiting 45mins to an hour for a table at this joint, I kick myself a little (sometimes a lot) and wonder, why oh why am I waiting almost an hour for ramen when I live within a 1-2 mile radius of ramen capital, USA?! Then I think, I must be a masochist in order to justify the hour wait for "decent" ramen to endure the pain of an aching, hungry belly. Then I kick myself some more. And continue to wait some more. Sure, the ramen's good, but really....I've had better. Is it possible that the fact I had to wait almost an hour for food makes me think their ramen tastes better than it really is? Because by the time I'm done eating, I would have just satiated a burning appetite for piping hot noodles and fatty pork broth that had been festering for over an hour. Monkey poop will taste good when you're that hungry, I'm sure. And if you're wondering how many times I've reiterated the fact that I had to wait over an hour for ramen in this review......5. That's right, I can't get over the fact that I have to wait almost an hour for ramen. 6.

Truthfully, there are so many good ramen restaurants in Southern California it seems silly to wait 75 minutes for a bowl here. Even so, when every last noodle has been devoured and the last spoonful of broth slurped you'll end up wondering if Daikokuya ramen is what people eat in Japanese heaven.

Daikokuya is one of those places you hear alot about from either your hipster friends or random foodies like me. Word is they got the best ramen in town son. I love dining at a place that's all hyped up then falls flat the second I get there. In this case, im pleased to say Daikokuya lives up to it's expectations. You have regular ramen with vegetables, chashu pork and all the fixings in a bowl. Tsukemono is your other option. It's all the things in their signature ramen only everything comes separate on a plate so you can choose what goes in your ramen without having to deal with things you don't want added. Reminds me of pho. My only complaint is it's kinda small inside. With a demand that large I don't know why they havent expanded the seating in this place. That and my ramen soup came out a bit cold, almost like it'd been sitting around or something. We sat near the front and were surrounded by people waiting to be seated. Sorta weird when a guy's leg keeps rubbing against you while you're trying to eat. Prices were very reasonable, service was superb. I recommend going on a weekday. Even on a wednesday night we still had to wait a little bit even without the giant crowd outside. Now if parking wasn't such a pain in the ass I'd totally be here everyday.

Every time I crave ramen in LA, the first place that comes to mind is Daikokuya. The food here is above average compared to most of the places around. The broth is very  thick and fatty (especially with the kotteri). The noodles are cooked nice so that it's not undercooked, but still has the texture of what ramen noodles should be like. Their side bowls (fried rice, teriyaki, and sushi) are also quite good. However, the combos do add up to become a lot of food. The only downside to this place is the location. For the number of customers Daikokuya gets, the joint is extremely small. This results in very long waits. However, if you just put your name down and explore Little Tokyo, time will fly by in no time. Overall, one of my favorite places. Parking can be a hassle if it's your first time but still worth it.

My brother was visiting from the cultural wasteland that is Phoenix so I thought I'd take him to eat ramen.  I've tried a few places around LA that were great, but with all the hype surrounding Daikokuya I decided to give it a try. 1. Parking: Daikokuya is located on a busy street just by the heart of Little Tokyo which means that metered parking spaces are very very hard to come by.  There are plenty of lots for $5 and up, but a little part of me dies whenever I have to pay for parking.  And this isn't just during the day... We got there around 7:30pm on a Thursday and it was swamped. 2. The WAIT.  You go in and write your name on a clipboard and wait until they call your number.  Again, 7:30 pm on a Thursday and our little party of 2 had to stand and wait for an hour to sit down.  Probably not a place to go for a date unless you're really sure you'll be able to fill that much time.  I felt bad for all the sad couples looking hungry and forlorn.  You can walk around Little Tokyo, but they don't call phones, and they don't even go outside to shout the number. 3.  The food, however, was delicious! They serve tonkotsu ramen and I ordered the kotteri style which is extra fatty.  The broth was amazing, especially on a chilly night with an empty stomach.  We also got a combination set so we could try the salad and the shredded pork bowl, which were also both delicious.  My only problems were that the chashu was too fatty and the egg was overcooked. The egg is so good when it's drippy and soaking up the ramen broth, but this egg was borderline boiled.  What a disappointment! The broth was so good I definitely want more, but until they come up with a better way to deal with the crowds (or at least get some benches) I'm going to wait.

WORTH THE WAIT! after reading about this place & hearing about it from my best friend who lives in LA, i finally tried it. he warned me there would be a wait, and yes, we waited for around 20 minutes (well he waited and i ran to Kimski to shop for a little), not a big deal. LOVE that its right in the middle of little tokyo, which is quickly becoming one of my favorite places in LA. The ramen was really good-maybe it was hyped up or something, but it wasn't as mind blowing as i expected, but still FAR better ramen than you could get in San Diego. also try the fried rice!! it was one of the best fried rices i have ever had=big deal. a must if you are in LA & love ramen :)

Rumor has it, it is the best ramen shop in LA. So to test this, we head down their with empty stomachs. It had a real authentic feel to it, like we just went through a worm hole and popped into Japan. I love it. This is what we got...their Specialty Daikoku Ramen. Unfortunately, they didn't have kotteri flavor for that richer taste that day. Kin got extra ramen noodles with his cuz hes a big boy and I got a cold mug of Kirin Draft. Lucky us, we got to sit at the bar and watch the cooks in action! Verdict: Amazing! The noodles were the best I ever tasted. The soup was flavorful and rich. The pork slices...phenomenal! They were tender and had a bit of fat trimming to give it some flavor. You can tell they cooked it for a day to get it that tender. The egg was cooked to perfection and the yolk was like a custard...not liquidy or hardened. The Kirin was light and really good, went down smooth. I don't usually drink beer, but when I do, I choose dos equi.....i mean Kirin lol.

4 Stars In my attempt to visit the top ramen restaurants in Los Angeles, I had high expectations for Daikokuya. It was a Saturday afternoon and the crowd outside was dense. We were told the wait would be about 45 mins. An hour later, we were seated. My friend brought a bottle of Riesling and the restaurant did not have a problem with that. But they didn't have wine glasses either. I guess that should have been expected. We ordered teriyaki chicken, gyoza, and pickled vegetables to start. For my entree I had the Daikokuya Ramen combination with the Unagi Bowl. All of the starters were delicious, nothing amazing but very good. The ramen on the other hand, was spectacular. The noodles were perfectly cooked and had nice chew. The pork was tender and unctuous and the broth was savory and rich. Each of the accompaniments green onions, marinated boiled egg, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts and sesame seeds added either texture or another dimension of flavor. I understand why I waited an hour and why Daikokuya has always been mentioned as one of the best ramen restaurants in LA. Can't wait til next time.

Going to visit Japan soon, so I am actually trying to cut back on Japanese food as it is probably is the only cuisine I will be eating over there. Still, I was in LA so I wanted to give Daikokuya a shot. There are not a lot of ramen places in Seattle, so I just wanted to see how LA compares. Being one of the top 10 most reviewed restaurants in LA, I was expecting a wait here. And there was one. Fortunately as it was the lunch hour, the place clears out quickly. Got a seat at the counter. It was kind of hectic in here. Though good as I would expect this to be the scene in Japan when dining. The ramen is the main attraction here, though they do have other food items including rice plates/bowls, sushi and bento boxes. If you would like a mix, you should try the combo which includes an order of ramen with a small rice bowl which is an additional $2-5 depending on the selection. I decided on the combo for variety. Selected the Daikoku Ramen and small tempura bowl combo ($11.50). First thing served is the cabbage salad which has a ranch type dressing. Delicious. The combo was then brought to me. This is a lot of food, by the end of the meal I was stuffed. I could not even finish the broth. Though the ramen is the star, I have to say that I thought it was just okay. For a tonkotsu based ramen, I thought the broth was not that creamy. I have had better here in Seattle. The ramen started off fine, but then started getting tired of eating it. I will say the ramen toppings are good. The egg is a nice addition and the chashu was decent. Even though the ramen did not wow me, I really loved the tempura here. The tempura is a mix of shrimp and vegetable versions. It was fried just right and the tempura works well with the dipping sauce. While the ramen was not a home run, I will say it is a very competent version. Though it was overshadowed by my enjoyment of the tempura here.

Came around noon-ish with my friend to get seats for our party of 5.  There was just 1 party of 2 before us so we decide to explore the area for 10 minutes and then come back as we wait for our friends. Big Mistake.   When we came back in 10 minutes there was a crowd and 15 parties signed up ahead of us!   * recommendation - put your name down while you can and don't walk away even for 10 minutes!! * Service was very friendly and considerate.  They were very concerned about our friend in crutches and wanted to make him feel as comfortable as possible by offering certain places to sit Daikokuya Ramen - Kottori Style - soup was filled with back-fatty goodness - probably the best straight pork broth-based ramen i have had so far because of it's very strong meaty flavor and the light creaminess of the soup, it was just a little bit saltier than i would like, but what ramen is not? - noodles were of good quality, i prefer chewier noodles but this place makes it a little softer - generous with the green onions so if you are an onion hater, tell the staff when you order.  i personally love grean onions and they give you heaps of it. - egg was cold in the center and thouroughly hard boiled - i much prefer soft boiled eggs so this did not add or take anything away from the dish Gyoza - tasted fresh, looks hand made which i appreciate, crispy on the outside, tender meat on the inside, and came with light soy-sauce based sauce This is the best straight pork broth based ramen i have tried so far, however if you are one of those people who like spicy garlic tonkatsu ramen - I would recommend Ramen Dojo.

Hmm...definitely a quaint ramen house in LA's Little Tokyo. Here are some thing to know before venturing to this place: 1. It's better to go in a smaller group; parties of four or less usually get seated faster than say, a party of six, which was ours. You sign up on a sheet by the door, and they call you when your table is ready. You need to have everyone present in order to be seated. Wait time can be anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour... 2. The portion sizes are HUGE, especially the house specialty: the Daikokuya Ramen. If you get ramen you can also get a combo. meal, adding Ton Katsu or something else to the dish for about 12 bucks. It's pretty worth the money because you're pretty much getting the equivalent to two meals. 3. It's an Asian restaurant. Waiters and waitresses are nice but service is subpar. But I'm pretty lax about that since I grew up eating in Asian restaurants. Now on to the food... The ramen is AMAZING. Noodles definitely have a good bouncy consistency that are great for slurping. Broth is light and not too heavy or salty, although I have to admit this isn't the best ramen I've had before...Ippudo takes the prize there. Gyoza is a good appetizer, light and fresh, definitely had an crispy exterior. Check this place out!

So many detailed reviews...imma just break it downnnnn -Small restaurant, mostly seats for 2 people, only one or two tables that can fit 4. -One hour wait -Great ramen, soup is slow stewed the night before in an "undisclosed location", tasty and warms the soul kinda good. -Loved the ramen combos: I got daikokuya ramen bowl + a small bowl of tuna sashimi over rice. $14.00 around. my man got the same but with tempura over rice. -came with a tangy cole slaw type salad. Great starter.

The wait wasn't as bad as I expect but..there was a line outside..on a Wednesday night..damn! Took a little stroll around Little Tokyo to kill time. Maybe 30-45 minutes, and by the time we got back, our name had an x by it :[ . So we waited like 5 more minutes :P Got in..sat down, ordered, and about 5 minutes later..our food was in front of our face. I ordered the tonkotsu ramen. SO..MUCH..NEGI..(GREEN ONION)..I LOVE IT! It was deeeeelicious! The egg..they give it to you hard boiled, but it was very dented..in many areas..so I didn't eat it. Just didn't look very appetizing. I swear I was eating for 20 minutes, and the amount was still the same. Got way too full. Service was great! Makes you feel like you're really back in Japan. Set up is verrry Japan like as well. I am most definitely coming back here asap! :]

Why would you want to wait over an hour long in a line that seems to not ever move? Why would you want to find parking in Jtown to come here? Well because this place is the bomb!! That is why! :) Service when you do get a table is quick and very attentive. They will for sure fill your drink if you ordered tea and I love the tea. I am a stickler on tea but I do enjoy this one. Also loved loved the fried dumpling things I believe its called gyozo but don't quote me on that...people come here of course for the ramen but I do think they are missing out if they don't order the gyoza. I mean the crispiness and texture is just right with a good amount of flavor. Also they give you lots of green onions on top. :) What else would I say about this place. The ramen well the ramen to me reminds me of what a obese person would think to make and give to starving hungry people that have been waiting for hours to get a table. This thing is super huge..I can't even finish it let alone half way through! Sigh soo sadly I wish I wish they changed a little bit and add a mini bowl of ramen. That would be the best. :) Not everyone can stuff our bellies full of this! :) But I still love on this place and enjoy every bit of what I can stuff myself with!

Good, I don't think it's necessarily worth all the hype. We got there at 10:45am AND THERE WAS ALREADY A LINE! Seriously? We ended up getting the very last seats in the house when they opened their doors at 11, and it was at the bar, not a legitimate table. There were only 3 of us so it wasn't a huge problem but I would have liked to be able to see/sit across from the people I came with. We got the fried tuna appetizer and for the main course, I got the regular ramen, the other two got the fatty version (apparently they put extra fat in the broth?). The tuna was good with an interesting texture. It wasn't too greasy, I enjoyed it. The ramen was by no means bad, but I personally prefer Santouka Ramen in Mitsuwa Market. Cheaper and better. However, I did like that the kitchen is really open and you can see them making the food!

This place is so crowded, luckily it was just two of us, i dont know how long i'd have to wait if it was more of us. Definitely not worth the wait though, the ramen was okay, flavor was not amazing, but good. Definitely can't compare to the places i've had here in the bay area.

the 5 stars are for their gyoza and their ramen. I repeat: GYOZA and RAMEN I could give it less stars for other things, but instead I'm going to leave advice for any first time guests: 1) bring cash (cash only and you may have to pay for parking though there's usually something free nearby) 2) don't be in a hurry...you will wait any time of day because there isn't a ton of seating and it's really popular 3) on the subject of waiting, this really isn't the best place to go with a huge group. save this restaurant for those days when you want to eat somewhere alone, go on a unique date, or maybe grab a bite with just a few others. 4) get the gyoza as a starter. you will not be disappointed. i can't stress that enough...gyoza gyoza gyoza. for the love of god, gyoza. 5) if you are on a budget, get the smaller portion of the Daikokuya ramen bowl. It's a little cheaper but still fills you up for sure.

hard to say how the ramen really tasted to us because we went there at 4:30pm and it was our first meal of the day since we flew in that day and there was very bad traffic. but other than the skewed late lunch, i think the ramen tasted good and the noodles were fresh. the broth was tasty and had a nice and simple clear taste to it that is refreshing if you prefer it that way as opposed to being overly spiced or full of msg.

I effin' love this little gem. I've been eating here occasionally for the past few years--mainly because I have to commute from Irvine to wait in line for the deliciousness. The broth is just so amazing; it's tasty, it's light (unless you get the fatty version, which is too good for my own good--painfully, fattingly good), and it just warms you down to the bones. The egg in the ramen, that thing makes my day!!! As Uncle from Jackie Chan Adventures used to say, "AND ONE MORE THING..." Their fried rice? To. Die. For. You know how ramen joints always have their signature fried rice that's just different from other places? This one. THIS ONE. And I love one of the guys that works here. He's usually the one calling your name because there's almost always a wait, he's the one that smiles at you, he's the one that says the silliest, most entertaining things, and he's the one that will always humor you. SUPER awesome guy. I swear it!

I just finished my shredded pork bowl for a pre dinner snack! To add onto the previous reviews, there's really no complaint here. Just the hr to an hr and half wait. I mean, the list piles on. Me and the girlfriend had to walk back to Little Tokyo two times just to shop around the shops so the wait time can go by faster. Daikokuya is a very authentic Japanese ramen shop. The ramen here is very different from the ones in San Diego. Different flavors and different ramen texture. The amount they give you is very scary. We were bold. Both ordered the daiko ramen combination with shredded pork bowl and fresh eel bowl. Trust me, a party of two should definitely share one combination and it will be enough for both. Trust me, there will be leftovers. The gyoza appetizer was delicious. The fried skin on the dumplings looks like melted pan fried cheese, very tasty! To add onto the ramen itself, they pile a lot of chopped green onions. I mean ALOT! So those who don't love them, ask them to remove them. Love the atmosphere. Lovely customer service. Just the long wait line.

It was a hot, hot day in Little Tokyo... I walked into Daikokuya and it was even hotter inside! Why did we decide to eat ramen at this time?! I thought to myself, "This ramen better be hella good..." and was it? YES! It was AMAZING. Worth all the uncomfortable heat and sweat! This was only my second time trying ramen at a restaurant and it was awesome! I've really been missing out! Or maybe it's just Daikokuya's ramen :) We were seated after waiting only 20 minutes at most (but we were there around 3~4pm) We both ordered their specialty, the Daikoku ramen, one as a combo with a Chicken Teriyaki bowl to share. The food came out pretty fast and OMG the bowl is HUGE! I'm pretty sure I stared at it for a few minutes wondering if I could even finish it. Once I started eating, I understood why this is one of the top places in LA. The noodles tasted so fresh and the broth was super flavorful. From what I remember, it came with chasu pork slices, a boiled egg, bamboo shoots, and tons of green onions. Everything was delicious - ESPECIALLY the egg. I've never had an egg cooked like that before! The chicken teriyaki bowl was also yummy but not as memorable as the ramen. I got sooo full and had to try super hard to finish as much of it as possible since it was so good! If you're anywhere near Daikokuya or ever want to try real ramen, I definitely suggest eating here. It's worth the wait, the price, and the heat! :)

After years and years of being in love with ramen, we had to finally dedicate a weekend to try the beloved, popular, recommended, 4 stars on yelp Daikokuya aka the best ramen in LA............... ARE YOU F'N KIDDING ME? Let me start this review by saying that I know good ramen. I lived in Japan for six years of my life and have had ramen at the best local hole in the wall places in Tokyo. I have made it a point to try every ramen joint I can possibly come across. So I am confident in saying that my opinion is accurate. TRUST ME :) I love flavor and selection. These two things were lacking at Daikokuya, which is basically the main reason why I found it to be highly overrated. Low variety however can be overlooked because one signature dish can carry an entire menu...however, THEIR "signature dish" did not do that. I ordered the Kichi cold ramen which was supposed to be the hot and sour version of the regular Daikoku and the broth was sooo bland.  This was the first ramen place I've been to in a while that didn't have an option of making the ramen spicy. The only thing they offered was sriracha and red peppers. I was constantly adding sriracha and Japanese red pepper to be at leeeast slightly satisfied with the flavor. I thought this was ramen, NOT PHO. And when I tried my boyfriend's Daikoku, it tasted like water. Sigh, he looked so sad haha. On a positive note the noodles, however, were delicious and the chasu pork was tender... but what's that with no complimentary good broth? The highlight of my meal was probably the shredded pork bowl (weird because I thought this place was known for its ramen?). Basically, if you're already in town and craving ramen and the wait isn't crazy... I STILL wouldn't recommend this place. It DOES NOT live up to the hype. I can't believe I traveled from OC just to try their ramen ... definitely disappointeddddd.  The whole time my boyfriend and I kept looking at each other going "well at least now we know". Seriously the only reason why it was worth trying was just to judge for ourselves, BUT PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND JUST TRUST ME! TRUST ME TRUST ME TRUST ME!

Maybe it's cuz I'm from the bay where they charge $15 for a bowl of good ramen, but this place blew my mind.   FOOD The ramen here isn't the best I've had but it was plenty good.  The broth isn't loaded with grease like some places I've been to so it lacks that intense pork flavor some places have.   Jesus Christ the fried rice and the shredded pork dishes were good.  There's pork belly in everything, and anything is good when you add pork belly in it.   PORTIONS The combos are roughly 12 bucks with ramen, a huge side order, and a salad.  I normally eat a lot of food, but the combo defeated me.  You never find portions like this at the price point at any Japanese restaurant period.   WAIT it's long.  Come here expecting to wait so maybe you won't cry about it when it happens.  I pretty much never say this, but I thought it was worth the wait.

I know people are going to read this and think i'm a raman retard for giving this place 3 stars. But 3 stars DO indicate that it's "A-OK'. Which it is. It is good ramen. They make their pork stock from scratch and have it brewing 24/7. They are legit. No doubt. I have enjoyed my meal both times i've been here but I have NOT enjoyed the wait time. I wish they would implement a phone system that would call you when your tables ready. But it's not TGIF's, so you gotta pay your ramen dues. I think what i'm saying is, I'm an Orochon girl. Gasp! Yes... it's true, so while I think people should go to Daikokuya, cuz they're holding it down for realsies in there, I will go down the block. ..But then thats one less reservation you have to contend with.

wow.  holy cow.  over 3000 reviews?  I doubt there's anything I can say here in this review that probably hasn't already been said.   nonetheless... gotta give shout out. And I declare it from the rooftops, much like a barbaric YAWP, that Daikokuya is worthy of every 4 and 5 star review they've got on here.  This place is amazing.  Japan right down to it's very core.  Absolutely loved it! If you're looking for Ramen - I don't know if you'll find a better bowl than here at Daikokuya.  The broth really is THAT good.  It's been brewing for a day before it even hits your lips.  Oh, and don't worry about them making it complicated or anything - there's pretty much only one Ramen option on the menu.  And that's all they need.  When you've reached perfection - why would you alter it?  So, keep it simple.  Get the ramen.  Maybe get some side dish(es).  But enjoy the perfect broth and the chewy goodness of the perfectly cooked noodles and floating pork.   Daikokuya - I love's me some ramen.  And I loves me some you.   Word of advice - get there early if you want to get a seat and not have to wait a while.  I was lucky and came in before 6.  By the time I was leaving, there were already at least 20 people waiting outside.  On the plus side - it's worth the wait. Oh - one last thing.  **CASH ONLY.** (but don't worry, they've got an ATM in the back in case you don't have one in you pocket.)

Wow! I love this place with a passion! I think this place has set the bar on all other ramen places I go to that have Tonkotsu broth. The noodles are perfect and the broth is amazing! Get the combination and pick a rice bowl that sounds good; because all of them are good! Get a beer too; makes this place more enjoyable. Horrible parking situation; you'll probably be driving around the block for 15 minutes; or you'll be walking 15 minutes from your car. Don't forget to add another 45 minutes for the wait outside. In the end; you'll forget all the negatives of the parking and waiting since you just left Daikokuya orgasmically satisfied!

My go to ramen spot whenever I'm in the DTLA area. Portions are good, prices are great, service is awesome. This place is a homerun.  The only downside is this place has gotten really popular, that translates to, really long wait times. Tip: order your ramen with the extra pork fat. It's delicious!!!

"Woohoo! As good as it gets!" I've encounter in LA thus far. I spent a summer a few years back visiting extended family in Tokyo and was lucky enough to sample from many of the great ramen restaurants in the city, as well as visit the Ramen Museum (that's right, a ramen museum where they serve dozens of different types of ramen) in Yokohama. And thus far, this is the best ramen I've tasted in LA! Sure, it's crowded at this location, but it's all there in the bowl! Quality! Pro tip: If you are faced with a long wait, you can put your name on the list and walk down the street towards Alameda to a little bar called "The Far Bar". The entrance is literally a hole in the wall (look for string lights draped across the interior. They serve local craft beer, often have life music, and the ambiance is really nice. Just don't forget your reservation! If you're 12-15 parties down the list, don't stay longer than 30 mins.

"The process begins the afternoon before it ever reaches your table by boiling pork bones and joints in a large cauldron all throughout the night, reducing at an undisclosed location. By the time it reaches the stove behind the counter the next day, all the goodness is concentrated in our famous tonkotsu soup base. From the pot, the soup goes into bowls (large and half size available upon request) where it is infused with our secret blended soy sauce. Into the completed broth we add boiled chijire style of noodles, the firmness of which can be altered by request. Finally, the kurobuta pork belly chashu, marinated boiled egg, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, green onions and sprinkle of sesame seeds completes the reason why you're here and why we are still in business." -http://www.daikoku-ten.com/locations/littletokyo/­menu/ IT TASTES AS AMAZING AS THEY DESCRIBE IT TO BE!!! Daikokuya is hands down, my favorite ramen place, EVAR. I'm not a fan of pork, so I usually just request the pork removed or on the side if I'm with a friend who will eat it. Oddly enough, I lovelovelove the broth even though it's pork based--it's not too intense but flavored just ever so right. It is absolutely so ridiculously amazing that it could be 100 degrees outside and I'd still eat this stuff. They do have a cold version for those hot days that I have yet to try. The other thing I love about this place is their ramen combinations--I usually go with the tuna sashimi: about 5 or 6 generous cuts of tuna sashimi on top a bed of rice with seaweed flakes and a cabbage salad with sesame dressing all for only $12! Can't beat that price for the taste in this economy. This place does get really packed. Not once have I been here when there wasn't a wait. Being that the place is pretty tiny doesn't help the cause, but trust me, the wait is worth it. Maybe just bring a small snack if you're starving to hold you up for the hour.

Read this very carefully. Why is Daikoku special***? The ramen soup is a soy-sauce based broth cooked with pork bones for nearly a day.  It is creamy, thick, and refreshing, but not overly salty nor overly "heavy".  It is smooth like butta, warm, and comforting. The noodles are cooked fresh and each serving is cooked individually.  They are thick, yellow, chewy, and elastic, and towards the end of the meal, are perfectly spongy yet still retain their texture and flavor. The hardboiled egg is soaked in a special marinade for over an hour before being placed in the warm soup.  It reminds me of Taiwanese style tea-leaf eggs.  It reminds me of the tea leaf eggs made by Momma M and Gramma M. The bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, and a MOUNTAIN of green onion are placed on top of the steaming bowl of ramen.  The different flavors mix well and balanced the deliberately flavored ramen broth. The chashu pork included with the ramen is "black pork" which is used primarily for its unique flavor.  It is tender, it melts in your mouth, it's slightly grilled before being placed in the ramen bowl, and it is without a doubt in my mind the reason pigs exist in this world (yes, more than bacon, and I WILL stand behind this claim). The gyozas are the absolutely best Japanese-style gyozas I've ever had in my life.  They are served freshly fried, clearly handmade, retain a chewy yet crispy skin, and the filling is porky and juicy.  The sauce of soy sauce and vinegar perfectly complements the saltiness and tanginess of the porky gyoza juice. After a couple sips of soup broth, I completely forgot about my date, my life, my job, my disorders, my sadness, my stresses, my travels, and could only comprehend ramen, or specifically, building my home out of ramen noodles with fountains of pork broth and gardens of stewed pork.  My aesthetic is amazing. Kobe Bryant announced that he wanted to leave the LA Lakers, but then reconsidered, because of the Daikoku Combo - Daikoku Ramen and a bowl of Pork Cutlet with Egg over rice for 10 bucks.  It's *that* good, folks. Lindsay Lohan was found with a "usable amount of Daikoku ramen" in her car when she crashed it on Memorial Day weekend.  She has since checked into rehab.  Ramen rehab.  Yes. *** Some of these statements may not be true.  Did you read carefully?

Maybe it's not fair for me to even review this place, because I couldn't actually have what they are famous for...the Ramen. We got there, starving (of course), and there was a crowd on the street.  For my hungry friend, this was an indication that we should've gone elsewhere (since she's had their Ramen many-a-time & knows I don't go near pork).  Seeing all the people worked it's magic on me, and I was down for the wait so I could taste why there was such a ravenous crowd outside... Everyone in our group got the Ramen.   They lose stars from me because my friend's simple request for "no onions" was overlooked, and her bowl came out piled high with onions... I got the shrimp tempura bowl, and I was far from impressed... As a whole, it was a very middle-of-the-road experience for me;  and I won't be returning, because they don't offer any other broth options for people who don't eat pork.   Plus, the waitresses were very unattentive, and hard to catch (but it was pretty late, who knows how long they had been working)

Ooh~  this is a tough one (-_-); The little finger for my mouse pointer is hovering between 4 and 5 stars.... orange, red, ok orange, no red... what should I do?  Should I do it?  What, I should??  Ackk!!  OK, I did it~  5 stars!! No offense Santouka, you're ramen is aiight, but Daikokuya is the bomb.  No wait, it's more like new-kyoo-lihr!  I'd have to say it's right up there with Shin Sen Gumi, but there are a few differences: - pork broth, a little lighter and saltier - noodles, more al dente (similar to choosing "hard" at SSG) - toppings, default are bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, green onion, and hard boiled egg - pork slices, look like they are from the belly with stripes of fat but melts in your mouth (moister than SSG which are just slices of pork meat) Other items I tried were the fried rice (part of combination) and gyoza appetizer.  The fried rice had little bits of pork, but was not as flavorful as I had hoped.  I prefer the one at SSG which has chopped takana (pickled mustard greens) in it.  The square shaped gyoza is plump, loaded with meat, and juicy (gosh that sounds so wrong, but it tastes so good). The wait on a Saturday night was around 45mins, but it was worth it.  I was so hungry I inhaled my food~  Although I reached maximum stretching capacity on my spandex pants, luckily I had a friend who helped roll me out of the restaurant.

Up until a few weeks ago, I'd never had ramen, unless you count the little instant styrofoam bowls of it on which I basically subsisted in college. I was out for drinks with a couple of friends the night before Thanksgiving, which, if you recall, was cold and blustery and a bit wet. After tossing back a few, we decided we needed sustenance and my friend Mike suggested Daikokuya. Having never been there, but having heard great things about it, I quickly agreed. We didn't have a very long wait (okay, we stopped by Far Bar after we put our names on the list) and we were seated side-by-side at the counter. This was actually the best possible place to sit, in my opinion - I could watch the cooks put together each delicious bowl of ramen. (I knew which one was mine right away, because they skipped the scallions on top.) My first spoonful of the richly creamy, silky-milky broth was a suspended moment in time. I let the sensations of Daikokuya wash over me - the low cheerful chatter in Japanese and English, the warm billowing steam of the kitchen, the comfortable closeness of my friends alongside me enjoying their ramen in joyful silence. I'm still savoring that moment even now. I have nothing against which to compare this ramen, but I found it to be spoonful after spoonful of bliss. It was not too heavy or salty, and each mouthful of broth with soy marinated egg, barely crisp bamboo, snappy bean sprouts, black pork that melted away as it touched my tongue, firm noodles, peppery ginger, and Nanami Togarashi, was slightly different and better than the last. As we looked up and grinned at each other in sated happiness, I spotted the wall clock and saw that it was just past midnight. We clinked our glasses together and wished one another happy Thanksgiving. It was a lovely start to the holiday. As we left, I thanked the staff for such an incredible meal, and they bowed and thanked me profusely in return. I consider this a perfect meal. P.S. They also had Diet Coke and the guy who was moving the enormous pots of broth had incredible forearms. I'd totally give extra stars if I could.

This is simply one of my favorite ramen place in all of LA. The part I'm pissed about was that Jonathan Gold of LA Weekly (Pulitzer prize winner) continually listed this place as one of his "99 Essentials eat in LA". To me, that is a high praise especially going up against the much more fancier eatery places in LA. I'm pissed at the fact that this place is zoo madhouse on the weekend. I guess that should not be a bad thing. As accurately described on their website, the soup base is a pork flavored soy sauce soup that has seasoned bamboo shoots, a couple slices of black pork, with a soy sauce dipped hard boiled egg. The noodle itself is a thinly twined of a yellow egg flour noodle is richly prepared every day. Watching them making the soup and noodle separately is interesting as it looked very complex, but it's really simple to do. It is like watching artists at work on the kitchen. After the finish product, it did not take me very long to impale the entire bowl. I think I ate this bowl of noodle faster than at Orochon down the street. A couple of interesting subjects that was brought up about this place that should be noted. One, they do NOT serve to-go orders on a busy Saturday evening. Apparently I overheard in that they will only do it on weekday, but not on weekend where the diners get the priority. Great to hear. Second, the spice level of the ramen will not be adjusted. If you wish to have it more spicier, then you will be probably better off at Shin Shen Gumi  or Orochon rather than at this location. At Orochon, you can also ordered different type of soup (miso, soy, or Salt) rather than just the one that was served at this location. The most annoying thing coming here on a busy weekend evening was just as many of the previous reviewers had pointed out in that  when there is a long waiting list for a table, the people waiting are going to give the patrons eating a dirty look. I know it only because I was the one who also was doing it! When you are hungry and needing a table or counter seat, you'll doing anything to get these people off and going. I hate to say it, but I would gladly do it if they don't hurry up and finish so that others can eat here. The service at this place was awesome. Our servers was on top of their game and moving their feet constantly. There's only two waitresses/servers working on that particular night, but yet we were taken care of very nicely. Since obviously you are only to get one kind of ramen/soup, I also suggest getting the pork cutlet rice bowl to go along with your ramen for $10.99. That is a great deal and it feels like you have two meals going. The meal is definitely worth it and if anybody coming to Little Tokyo for authentic ramen, I would highly suggest coming here first before going to Orochon to compete to get your Polaroid up at the board. Now, my mission is to get Jonathan Gold to remove this restaurant off his Essential 99 list.... so that it may get less crowded on the weekend. Yep, I'm always greedy. -------- Personal Note: The Review of the Day (6/15/07)

When I heard that my family wanted to come here, I kind of panicked.  The reason being is that there was 5 of us.  For those of you know have been here before, you can kind of feel me on this one.  Not that it's impossible, but getting a table for anything more than a party of 4 is near impossible.  Perhaps the first 2 tables when you first walk-in can fit 5 most of the time, but beyond that, because of the bar, would make it a very tight squeeze. When we eventually got seated, which didn't seem terribly long despite having 5 people, I already knew what I was going to have.  I was going to get the Daikoku ramen, and decided to get the combo with fried rice.  My brother and sister in law had never been here before, so they obviously both got the ramen.  My sister in law got the kotteri flavor, which was hard to describe, but it was different in a good way.  My dad got the kotteri as well and my mom got the regular. My fried rice came out first I pretty much devoured it.  I mean, it is a smaller plate, but yeah, I practically inhaled it.  I think it's this diet I'm on.  I have flashes of gluttony. Everything was good as usual.  Oh man, just thinking about it now makes me want some.  My mom is absolutely in love with the broth, so much, that she brought home her leftover broth.  She had finished all the noodles, and just had the broth, but she still took it home.  I think it's still sitting in our freezer....

I'm totally ramen-ed out! After coming here 3 times during a 7 day span and then once again last night, I guess it's about time for a review.  Each time I told someone I had been here, I ended up heading back here with them a few days after my previous visit. Visit 1 - Came in just before closing on a Thursday night, last to be seated as a party of four.  Ordered the fabled ramen.  Eh, didn't really do much for me.  Maybe the last batch of night was missing that "umph" to it. Visit 2 - After ranting about my "eh" experience I came back 3 days later.  I avoided the ramen and went with the shredded pork rice bowl.  I know it's just a rice bowl, but the chopped pork, with that teriyaki glaze was super tasty.  Solid option that's large enough for 2 meals.   Visit 3 - Came back for lunch with a co-worker, who had been eying Daikokuya for the longest time.  We went early, just after 11am to make sure we beat the lunch rush and that we did.  Seated immediately, I decided to give the ramen another chance.  And what can I say, but boo-yah!  Third time must be a charm.  The ramen hit the spot, about a thousand times better than my first endeavor.  I'll chalk up my first ramen venture as an off night. Visit 4 - After an hour plus wait to seat a group of six (the tables only seat fit four, but we squeezed 2 small stools in at the table end), my hunger grew to Godzilla-like proportions.  Eyes being bigger than my stomach, I decided to mix it up and do the ramen & teriyaki eel rice bowl combo, which only costs a few more dollars.  The eel was worth the extra cash to mix up the tastes.  There was no way I could finish both so I walked away with plenty of leftovers for lunch. So yeah, I'm totally ramen-ed out, but if you twist my arm just hard enough...

Been here five times, and let me tell you: I don't care too much for the ramen, but the SHREDDED PORK BOWL is awesome. The ramen, which this place is famous for, tasted ordinary. The shredded pork bowl? Amazing. Savory, greasy, large portion size. $8.50 is a little pricey, but it will leave you more than full. Consistent quality every time I've been there. The ingredients look great (how are their scallions so green and crispy?) and it comes with miso soup and a tasty salad. The SAUSAGE side is nothing special, just your typical tasting sausage. The GYOZA was crispy, but again, nothing especially delicious or mouth watering. Wait times can be up to 90 minutes at peak hours. The restaurant has a B rating discreetly on display behind two curtains at front the entrance. No surprise, some surfaces look like they've never been wiped in years. Haven't had any food poisoning yet, but I think the general dirtiness lends a certain worn-in, authentic feel. Which brings me to ambiance. It has a cliche, kitschy-Japanese kind of decor that makes me imagine a low-budget Kungfu movie fight scene breaking out at any moment. TL;DR: Eat the SHREDDED PORK BOWL.

For my first time, I gotta give props to Dave L for getting on the waiting list early, Judy W for the invite, Pavel D for eating my pork and Linda N for letting me sit really close to her.  First time was really good, but I wanted to try this place again before reviewing it.   Took grandma here second time around.  Chewing on a shoe, she was stuck at home and hungry as a bear.  Picked her up and zoomed down the 5 freeway to the 101.  Once we got there, I did a rolling stop in front of the restaurant and grandma hurled out the car door to secure us a place on the waiting list. Ugh.  I typically hate waiting lists.  Like a velvet rope at a club, it's the waiting list that can really make or break a restaurant.  Are you the type of person that can wait 15 minutes to an hour for a bowl of ramen?  After such wait, does it add to your anticipation or does the hype wither away with each impatient minute?  Would waiting an extra fifteen minutes or so drastically change your opinion of the food? In my case, not really.  First time around, the wait was only 15 minutes.  Second time around, it was triple the first. And both times, the ramen was oh so tasty.  The noodles were thicker and more chewy than the instant packaged variety.  The bamboo shoots and green onions taste divine.  And it was an "Oh snap!" moment when the Yoshinoya seasonings of red pepper and ginger were brought to my attention. In regards to the ramen's pork broth itself, I'm sort of a hypocrit.  You see, pork is one of two things I don't like putting in my mouth.  And if you must know, the other is a midget's fist.  Their hands just plain smell funny.  But back on point, the broth is actually quite savory to me.  I don't pick up on the essence of porkage within the broth, but my taste buds are still much satisfied with whatever else comprises it. As for the actual slices of pork, I still stand anti-pig.  So if you're dining with me, that just means more pork for you!  And just before grandma was about to dip a half-chewed shoe in her broth, I relinquished my unwanted treasure into her bowl. I'd have to agree with her that it tastes better than Santouka.  Their ramen just has way too much going on for my provincial palette.  In comparison to Shin Sen Gumi however, theirs wasn't much to drool over in my opinion. As for the other appetizers at Daikokuya, I wouldn't recommend getting the tempura--the oily fried goodness doesn't go well with a hearty bowl of soup.  The fried rice is quite yummy.  Their gyoza, which I learned is only cooked on one side, is a good enough precursor for your ramen to come.  And be sure to dump the extra green onion toppings from the gyoza into your bowl.  But if you're too cheap to spring for at least one appetizer, I guess you can chew on own shoe to distract your hunger. Even after several passing hours with an array of cocktails at a bar and two hella expensive waffles, both our bellowing bellies were still joyful with the broth and noodles.  On the drive back to OC, grandma would mumble irrational questions and yearnings of ramen in her snoring slumber...while cradling her shoe.

Daikokuya earns its B rating. Apparently everything from the curtain at the front of the restaurant to the restroom at the back either is or has once been covered in pork grease (I hope it's just pork grease). The wait is always heinous no matter the time of day or night, but it's worth it, because the ramen is fantastic. The broth is porky salty goodness, the noodles are just chewy enough, and the pork slices and egg are savory and delicious and both cooked just right to melt in your mouth. The pork is a belly cut that reminds me of German speck, and the egg is marinated and cooked so the yolk is still soft in the middle. Daikokuya is about the same price as Orochon, but their ramen is much much better. A must visit in Little Tokyo.

Sound the horns, people.  I have found the best ramen house on the West Coast.  Well, according to me, that is.   And the best would be Daikokuya, located in the heart of Little Tokyo/Downtown LA, which is oh so far from me. They offer only two types of ramen: one hot (Daikoku ramen), one cold (Tsukumen), both priced at $8.50 each.  You can never go wrong with a place that specializes in just one type of hot ramen.  The Daikoku ramen is a steaming hot bowl of carbohydrate and protein heaven.  The noodles are curly and al dente, just the way I like them.  The kurobuta pork isn't the totally-melt-in-your-mouth kind, but tasty nonetheless.   And the egg -- oh my gawd, the egg!  It deserves it very own paragraph, it's that good.  As described on their menu, the egg is soaked in their special soy marinade overnight, and they're not lying.  You can even taste the delicious marinade in the yolk!  And this isn't the typical soy egg you find in most ramen bowls.  The egg is soft-boiled and I don't typically eat the yolks of an egg, but I didn't hesitate to devour this one. No matter rain or shine, there will always be a line out of this place.  We came late in the afternoon and were seated quite quickly at the counter.  Although the restaurant can get stuffy, this doesn't deter the masses from coming.  Hell, I was uncomfortably sweating like a pig while I was slurping my bowl of noodles, but this won't stop me from coming here the minute I arrive in LA next time.

Ramen - hands down 10 stars!!! Waiting in line for hours and hours - f* sucks! I stuffed myself at a gazillion lil hole-in-the-wall ramen joints right by subway stations in Tokyo last year and the only ramen place that ever came close is this place. Even the interior decor is modeled exactly like the joints in Tokyo. oh and the roasted pork slices are absolutely to die for. I highly recommend doing what we did and put your name down and go eat a first dinner somewhere else and then come back for a 2nd dinner.

I've been here so many times I've lost count. The appeal of their ramen is universal. I'm not going to bash on or rave about it just because it's popular. Every Angeleno who is into Japanese food knows that. Ramen done simply, and done right. Delicious broth, no skimping on the ingredients--pork, shallots, bamboo, and an oh-so-scrumptious hard-boiled egg. That's all you need, and you can get it Daikokuya (after a one or two hour wait on packed evenings, of course). **To me, the location in Monterey Park is of the same quality.

Would have given Daikokuya 5 stars if not for their lack of consistency. You'd think that as a "premiere" ramen shop, they'd have a secret recipe that they follow to the tee every day, but they don't. That, or someone keeps messin' it up! :K Some days, their ramen broth is wayyy too salty, while other days,  drinking the whole bowl isn't enough! The quality of their meat is the same. Some days, the pork belly melts in your mouth and you'd eat the whole pig if you could; while other days, it tastes like old sneakers (and you wish your mortal enemy had eaten it instead!) Ah, Daikokuya...what will we do with you? THANKS FOR READING! *gives you a Happy (Ramen) Cookie* ^_^

The line for Daikokuya is always the longest and most persistent at Little Tokyo so I decided to swing by right at opening in order to skip the wait and be among the firsts to get seated. The open kitchen is now enclosed but the vertical layout with a middle walkway that delineates the narrow counter space facing the kitchen from the row of booths stacked against the wall have noticeably aged since my previous visit. I quickly situated myself at the exact same spot at the counter, and before anyone noticed the space was filled to the max as a line begun to form outside even before I had a chance to order. Price is a tad higher than their competitors as a bowl of Daikoku ramen costs $8.50. They have added a creamier tonkatsu-style Kotteri broth as an option for ramen enthusiasts for the same price. First time diners should know that a hallmark of Daikokuya is their ramen-rice bowl combinations with a list of nine options to choose from. I also think it's wise to come early and be decisive about your choices when they come around to take your order. My eyes grew bigger than my stomach as I ordered the Kotteri Daikoku ramen with Teriyaki Eel Bowl ($12.95). The Kotteri broth was not too salty but very fatty and creamy sweetened by sesame seeds, green onions and sprouts. The depth of pork flavors still did not go far enough for me, and the broth was not hot enough in spite of my request for it to arrive at a higher temperature. Their chijire-style egg noodles were semi-firm and not as thick and chewy as Mottainai, the bomboo shoots should be firmer, and somehow the two large boiled eggs were mistakenly cooked all the way through. The chasu was succulent and struck a decent balance between lean and fatty parts. Portion was good with equal proportions of ingredients, but I still enjoy the taste of Mottaiani and Santouka with Daikokuya at a distant third. The ramen was a solid 3.5 star with a more subdued "marble effect" and several inconsistencies noted above. What propelled my final rating for Daikokuya was the Teriyaki Eel Bowl, which I ordered as a shout out to my Yelp friends Kit H and David N who are big fans of eel. The small bowl was tightly packed with three thick pieces of succulent teriyaki eel on top of a layer of seaweed and steamed rice. It was very delicious that helped to hit the spot. I also received a complimentary salad which I was also fond of. Service was brief with a mentality to usher people in and out quickly so the line outside won't be stagnant. As a case in point, I received the check before I even received the teriyaki bowl, and once I finished my meal I felt that they were already looking forward to turning over my seat without letting me decide if I wanted to stick around longer. I don't think they were doing this consciously, but the atmosphere with which conveyed these subtle messages was in the air. I would be interested in returning but not likely as often as I would with Mottainai and Santouka.

How's that BS saying go? The apple doesn't fall from the tree or some sh^t? Well, think of my otosan (pops) as a tangerine tree. Think of me as the grapefruit (yes, I know, different fruit) that grew on that tree and fell and rolled away as far away from the tree as it's girthy weight allowed it too. My pops loves ramen. I, don't. My dad is skinny. I'm rotund. I'd rather eat donburi or udon, normally. But Daikokuya makes some good-ass tonkotsu (not to be confused with tonkatsu) ramen. An ass load of green onions on top too. Hi five, player. I whored myself out for about an hour and waited inside. I was expecting to hear angels in my head wearing dolphin shorts sing to me when I first slurped up the noodles and broth. All I heard in my head was Lady Gaga. Had she been naked, I would have been able to verify genitalia status. Close enough though. Even though I don't normally eat ramen, this was a good-ass meal. Their gyoza is good. The little pork sausages are pretty intense. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… However, they did take down my favorite art piece: http://drumbfounded.com/… Sh^t, I just realized there are close to 2,000 reviews for this place. The probability of mine being better than most of them is 98.1125%. Suck on that, previous reviewers. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to pour hot water in my Maruchan and lavish in the tiny dehydrated shrimp and peas.

When I ate here I thought it was nothing special. It's just ramen. How good can it be? But in the month or two that has passed since then, I've found myself thinking about that broth. That rich, flavorful broth made from pork bones and back fat. And the ramen noodles with just enough firmness and just enough give. And I realized how easy it is to mess up simplicity. I think I now understand the obsessive search for the best ramen that many Yelpers are on. It's like the search for the best burger, or the best tacos or the best fries. It's not about finding the best meal. It's about finding perfection in simplicity. With Daikokuya, I've begun my quest

I went to Little Tokyo to eat at KaGaYa, but they are closed from July 2 - Jul 16.  WTF?  So my second choice was Daikokuya.  Had to try it for the comparison to the one in Monterey Park.  The wait was short, not as bad as I thought it would be (probably because I went next door to check out Anime Jungle - what a freak show - Japanese or not, everyone in that place was so excited checking out the anime, costumes, and freaky-ass music.)  Back to Daikokuya, It was more hectic inside than the Monterey Park branch - mainly because this place is double in size.  Just about everyone inside was taking pictures of their food... Hmmm wonder what they're planning on writing about later on?   - Had the combo Daikokuya Ramen and Tempura Bowl this time. - Had to order the gyoza based on Jenny B's reviews.   Have to tell ya #1:  The Ramen was pretty much the same either place.  The soup base was a tad more flavorful here, but not sure if that can constitute being the main reason to take the longer drive from Pasadena.  (For a description of the Ramen - see my Monterey Park review - since to me it's practically the same.) Have to tell ya #2:  If this is the best that LA can offer for Ramen, well I need to find a better noodle type.  Yeah it's good, but nothing that will tickle the tonsils.  I think the next time I have Ramen - I'll go back to the Gardena/Torrence area.  Or, Daniel T is trying to turn me onto the South-East Asian type of noodo - so may try that the next time I have a wet noodle itch. Have to tell ya #3:  OK, the gyoza was actually pretty good.  Different than what I usually get.  These are more rolled like tiny burritos or open-ended lumpia.  Had a lot of green onion on it, but as a tasty little appetizer quite a pleaser. Just like the Monterey Park version, I can't knock off on their soggy tempura because I don't think it's their specialty, but yes it was very soggy - don't think I'll be ordering tempura there again.  So for now I would still come here as a second or third choice. The one thing that this place has over the Monterey Park branch.  Hell you're still in Little Tokyo, you can goto Yamazaki Bakery afterward, Pinkberry, Piccomolo Gelato, and snoop around in Marukai.

Sure, I'll just toss this on top of the other 500-something rants. A drop in the bucket, but hey, let my growling tummy be heard. It's much like my distended belly, piled high with ramen noodles, scrumptious melt-in-your-mouth slabs of kurobuta pork belly (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…), giant brown marinated boiled egg, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, green onions, sesame seeds. And the pork broth -- oh, the creamy savory sinfulness. I imagine a roiling hot jacuzzi with sweaty succulent piglets relaxing in the rich stock, letting their porky sweetness cut loose. Ah, yeah. (If that doesn't make you salivate, I don't know what will.) I lifted the hefty bowl to my lips and inhaled the entire thing, practically without breathing. That is rare. The ramen rules here. The lengthy waiting list and sidewalk crowds attest to that. I love gawking at the adorable 1950's Japanese signage and movie posters hung throughout the shop. Just perfection. There's even a David Bowie lookalike on the women's bathroom wall! They make me want to grab my bowl and leap into their happy super-saturated Technicolor world. It would undoubtedly get violent when they'd try to steal my precious ramen and I'd have to unleash my kara-zy. Worth every dropkick.

When I told my friends in LA that I was spending the weekend with them, they all had one thing in mind. Daikokuya! I really didn't understand how one can get excited for ramen. I mean, it's just ramen. What can be so special about it? Fast forward to my first sip of the soup base: All my friends were looking at me with anticipation as I took my first sip. It's as if they all knew that I was going to love it as soon as I get a taste of it. Throughout the whole meal, I was beginning to understand why my friends were so excited. By the end of the meal, I knew I was hooked. I love Daikokuya for their great ramen. I hate it, too, because I'm sure it will be hard to find ramen as good as theirs.

Does the popular Daikokuya live up to the hype? Not positive, but their ramen IS damn good. Met friends at this Little Tokyo ramen house for lunch. They don't take reservations - seating's limited - so we waited a bit for a booth. Tried a large bowl of their Daikokuya ramen, with their teriyaki eel bowl combo, served with a salad ($12.95 total). The eel was as good as can be and the ramen exceeded my expectations! The broth was delicious and soothing, a wonderful tonkotsu soup base filled with chijire-style egg noodles, light enough to not overwhelm, and tasty enough to making trooping through a bowl easy. Along for the ride was a marinated boiled egg, pork belly, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, green onions, and a sprinkling of sesame seeds. Last but not least, we shared an order of the kurobuta pork sausage ($4.95) - not your average wiener; the menu even says so. Sweet, scrumptious, with a light mustard on the side, the sausage was a treat. Service kept our waters filled and cleared plates fast. (We stayed longer than usual since a friend drove from quite far away to join us. Wouldn't do that again, but tipped extra since we held up seats.) Next time I'll get a regular bowl of ramen, and more appetizers!

THE BEST. Just make sure to plan ahead and try to come early for lunch/dinner or accept the wait, and you will be in heaven. The ramen is perfect: rich, salty broth, great pork, wonderful noodles that don't feel instant. It's fun to sit at the counter and watch them make it in those big, steaming vats. I always succumb to the temptation of the combo deals, which allows you to add things like fried rice (excellent), chicken teriyaki or tuna rolls, but be warned: it's a lot of food. The good news is that I tried taking my leftover ramen to go and it was totally still good when reheated! There's nothing that can brighten a cold, gray day better than that yellow awning in Little Tokyo. One of my all-time favorites!

These peeps aren't effin' around, oh no. *shakes finger* I'm pretty spoiled with my ramen, having spent enough time in Japan to get the good stuff. I have found my ramen mecca in the US.  The tragedy is that it's in Hell-Aye (LA), and I live in San Diego.   *throws self on bed, shakes fist at cruel fate, cries bitter tears*   This is the kind of food that motivates you to hit the gym for hours on end so your figure can afford to eat this divine bowl as often as possible. THIS. IS. RAMEN. ORGASM. When I had their ramen, I knew it was a caloric cataclysm of delectable doom.  Ah, they do the fatty pork RIGHT.  Most places, the fatty pork is often a bit tough, dry, even chewy.  Not here, babycakes.  Not here.  It melts in your mouth, luv.  Just falls apart and melts in your mouth like a willing lover.  Oh yes. Good broth requires a lot of foreplay and teasing- simmerin', heatin' and stewin' for a long-ass time.  Most places take a shortcut and go for the quickie with the aid of salt, soy sauce, msg- often resulting in a dissatisfied partner (the customer).   None of that shortcut going on here, baby, nuh-uh.  The result is worth every single penny of your hard earned money and then some.  The noodles were perfect- a bit toothsome with a little bite and bounce, like a good playmate should be. So yes, be good to your mouth.  Be excellent to your tongue.  Take them out for a night of good lovin' at the Daikokuya. (*my idea of ramen lust orgy would be Daikokuya's broth and fatty pork along with Shin-sen-gumi Hakata Ramen noodles)

Was in the LA area and heard a lot about this place, and Alan H. is a staunch supporter. I've loved Santouka from first sip, so I decided to try it out, we came at the tail end of the lunch crowd on a weekday and had to wait 10-15 minutes. Food roundup (2 ramen combos - kotteri style, 1 with chicken and egg bowl and tuna sashimi bowl): Salad: Big portion of finely shredded cabbage and addictive japanse mayo dressing. Chicken and egg bowl, tuna sashimi bowl: The chicken and egg bowl was delicious, chicken and egg a top rice with a sweet and savory soy like type sauce. Very hearty and delicious. My sashimi was fresh, I ended up just eating the 4 pieces on top and skipping the rice, so much food! Ramen: I must say the bowl is huge! You get some pork, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, and lots of chopped green onions on the top. Broth was flavorful and reminded me of a better version of Shin Sen Gumi, I still prefer Santouka's shio broth. Also, the noodles were nice and firm. Lowdown: I declare Daikokuya #2 in my ramen book, still prefer Santouka. I can tell you this place wins with value and portion size, Santouka's bowls and rice bowls are very small compared to here. The combos were no more than $12 and I couldn't finish the ramen or my rice for the tuna sashimi bowl. Beware this location as far as wait and ventilation needs to be better, kinda stuffy. Also, paid freaking $8 to park....its LA, right....

When you walk in, it has an old fashioned feeling to it. Old beer ads and posters, a bar for you to sit at if you are alone and booths for parties of 4. Small place so its going to be hard to do any parties. And this is by far the best ramen i've had, hands down. I know there are plenty of places i have not tried yet. But for now this is the best in my book. Their broth is kind of creamy, somewhat thick..not too salty and doesnt give u that heavy feeling after finishing it. their sausage, my god their sausage..so juicy and delicious..that black pork sure is good.. the noodles are a very good consistency, not all overcooked and nasty like some other places. and that egg adds a good touch, its always nice to have that boiled egg in there..that egg that isnt cooked all the way so you get some nice runny yolk mmmmmmmmm.. the chashu, was nice and fatty..the thing about their pork is that they use black pork..which is different from our everday pink piggy. In taiwan a lot of places make their lu ro fan out with black pork. Its fatty but won't give u that oily heavy feeling. i will go on and on about this place but the only way for you to really understand is to just go and try it. Go stay at the Miyako and literally across the street from the hotel is Daikokuya.... one of the spots that are a must -go-to when im in LA

It's aiiiight.  I had come back from Japan just a few weeks prior (ramen snob), so call me a ramen snob, but I've had better ramen elsewhere in the States. When a place has a 40 minute wait on a Saturday night at 10 pm, it inevitably raises some expectations.  I mean c'mon, it's Little Tokyo, and this place is off the charts for ratings, can't blame me for having my hopes up. My first gripe is with the pork.  It was chewy rather than tender, which implies that it wasn't cooked as long as it should have been.  I want that shit to melt in my mouth when I bite into it, and this pork did not do that.  Second gripe is with the soup base.  Tonkotsu ramen is supposed to be thick and creamy, like they just popped a chunk of straight up lard in there.  This soup was pretty watered down, too light for my tastes.  Third, as I remember, the noodles were average, and slightly hard for my tastes.  It's authentic Japanese ramen, don't get me wrong, but that doesn't make it great. Things that WERE awesome.  Gyoza were pretty awesome, I'll admit.  No complaints there.  Also, the unagi (eel) bowl that came with the combo was pretty bitching.  Also, service is great.  Prompt and friendly.  They do the Japanese thing where they basically yell greetings at you as you walk in and when you leave.  Pretty intimidating at first, but I've grown used to it.  My white friend was definitely like, "Oh shit, that's INTENSE." Feels like a typical izakaya (Japanese tapas bar). I gotta say, it's pretty awesome when the entire staff bows and yells greetings at you as you walk out.  You walk out feeling like a king. Not the point. So word.  Great service.  Great atmosphere.  Long wait.  Mediocre ramen.  Wait-Ramen ratio were way off, which docks off mad points for me.  Maybe that's the problem: I went there for ramen.  Everything that WASN'T ramen was great.   Lemme put it this way: if you're new to no-joke Japanese style ramen, this place will blow you outta the water (with their watery soup base, OHOHO BOOYAKA).  If not, don't go here for ramen.  THERE, I said it! I'd give it another chance for NOT-ramen.  Except I don't live in LA.  Haaaa!

We can see Daikokuya from our hotel window. So after eyeing the place for the whole weekend, we made our way across the street for some ramen. We waited a bit since they open at noon on Sundays. But once the doors opened, the place filled up quickly. Our party of 6 had to split up since their tables only fit up to 4 ppl. Their ramen menu is limited. The hot one: Daikoku Ramen (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) tonkatsu soup base with pork belly chashu, boiled egg, bamboo shoots, bean spouts, green onions and sesame seeds. Can be ordered as a combo that comes with a salad and a small rice bowl (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) The cold one: Tsukemen (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) Same as the Daikoku, except the ingredients are separated with the ramen served cold. The broth is slightly more salty since it serves as the dipping sauce for the ramen. Overall: Loved the texture of the ramen. Very chewy and delicious. The pork belly chashu was nicely grilled to a nice tender not overly fatty texture. Marinated boiled eggs are always good in ramen! Tip: On a hot day, order the Tsukemen. My friends were sweating after their Daikoku and I stayed nice and cool =P

Have you ever dated someone who as pretty cool?  And then met someone else who, despite not looking for something new, and being a pain in the ass, was just way better than what you have? That's how I feel about Daikokuya. I had a good relationship with my other ramen place.  It was good, I introduced him to my friends and family and I made an effort to keep in touch. I wasn't even interested in finding other Ramen.  I was good for now. Then, Amanda L. introduced me to a dashing stranger who would change my ramen world. I had to wait an hour. I had to sit at the booth. I had to order it as is (not like my ramen place that lets to add what you want) I fell in ramen love. The broth is so freaking good, I wanted to guzzle it down like I was a '57 Fairlane and it was leaded gasoline The pork MELTED in my eager mouth And those noodles were like al dente Japanese heaven. I mean, no offense to my old ramen lover...he was great, have nothing bad to say about him, I wish him well.  But Daikokuya is my ramen papi now.   Alls fair in ramen and war yo.

I don't get it.  I really don't. I've been here several times over the years, and I don't have any glowing memories from back then.  But that was before yelp days, and I thought I should give it another try as many yelpers claim this place to be #1 Ramen joint. So I went.  On Friday night.  My work has been crazy recently, and I've been working 11 hours everyday and some over the weekend.  I was tired.  I was hungry.  I was cold.  I was longing for a hot steamy bowl of Ramen to warm me and soothe me.  And Daikokuya shattered my hope. Mistake #1: Trying this place again. Mistake #2: Coming here on Friday, close to 9pm. Mistake #3 Waiting in line for about 45 minutes for their Ramen. As the lady finally called my name, I was sad that she said "Yoko-san, party of 2!"  Oh come on, Japanese lady!!!  I understand that English speakers get confused with my name just because it sounds and looks like Yoko Ono's first name, but you?  Japanese speaking Japanese lady?  What's up with you!!! Anyway, we ordered 2 bowls of ramen, gyoza, and fried rice.  Honestly, ramen disappointed me big time.  I can remember now why I never cared to come back here.  The broth is too sweet, and the noodle is meh.  The topping is nothing special.  Gyoza was better than most of the Ramen joints, but not "WOW" good.  However, their fried rice was something worth mentioning.  Not too dry but not too moist, perfectly cooked in the wok.  Very flavorful .  Definitely one of the best, though I can't decide if it's better than Shuchan Ramen's fried rice.     I'm definitely not coming back here again.  Delicious fried rice isn't good enough reason to drive for 30 minutes and stand in line for nearly an hour.

You could do a lot worse for late night fare than 12 gyoza and a large Asahi from Daikokuya. There's no LA law that requires the late night eater to stand up, and inhale truck exhaust.

2.5 stars. (That 0.5 star is just to appease those of you who will be angered by my tirade against this place) Ramen. Yes, you say that you're going out for ramen and here are a few sample responses you might hear: "Rah-men? That Maruchan stuff was like 5 for a dollar during college. Why would you go out to eat that?" "So, Is that like Cup of Noodle?" Sigh. After the fabulous film from the 80's, "Tampopo", which attempted to add Ramen to the list of culinary treats, there are still those who question this. A piping HOT bowl of ramen. With perfectly seasoned and fatty tonkotsu pieces, a bit of memma and a lovely hard boiled egg... what could be better on a chilly day? (or even a hot day?) Ah, a few crispy gyoza (potstickers) would be nice, too. Alas, Daikokuya is not the place to go for this. "Oh why, mia-the-nattofan, why??? I frickin love that place!" Some will say. The broth was piping hot. Yes. 1. The noodles were still lukewarm. Yikes. 2. The tonkotsu pork was so fatty, I hardly finished one piece. I mean come on, I love fatty pork like the next girl, but this was inedible. 3. And.... the final kick in the pants... or the hakama, if you will... Biting into the hard boiled egg.... I was horrified to note... that it was still refrigerator COLD! ICK! This was my response to The EGG...   http://youtube.com/watch… "The egg, the egg... What were they THINKING????" Oh, and it looks like they did some renovations and got rid of the bugs in the window space. Good for them. Still is as gross as heck and hardly deserving of their C RATING. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… (They fell from B!)

Came here last week with some yelper friends per the suggestion of uber yelper Anh T. (Friend & Fan her if you haven't already - http://www.yelp.com/user…).  Although there was a solid line of people waiting, our group of 5 was seated right away as Jiaming had arrived about 20 minutes ahead put our names on the wait list (thanks Jia!). Some may say that ramen is nothing to blow bubbles about, but being that the extent of my previous ramen experiences was limited to "Top" dehydrated noodles and flavor packets I was anxious to try the real deal.  And while I obviously cannot vouch for or offer analysis to the "authenticity" of the grub Daikokuya serves, I can say that I came away fully satisfied and quite impressed. Everyone in our party went with the standard ramen which consists of a bowl filled with deliciously steaming broth, noodles, a slice of pork, ample portion of green onions, hardboiled egg, and a few other various ingredients of which I am unfamiliar.  I often prefer my food spicy, but evidently ramen, unlike pho, is to be consumed as is with no sriracha or other additives.  However, with the robust and hearty flavor of the broth, this ended up being just fine by me.  Our party also shared 2 orders of Gyoza (Japanese pot stickers per Juma) which although tasty, were something I'd probably be indifferent to in future visits.  For drinks, Jiaming and I split a pitcher of Kirin. I must confess that due to a combination of my whiteness, lack of experience with Asian cuisine, and fat fingers I'm clearly not the most proficient chopstick user on the planet.  Matter of fact, I find forks to be far superior in terms of effectiveness.  But alas, when in Rome...Uh oh, there goes that Rome word again.  Expect the talk threads and website to spontaneously combust in 3, 2, 1... We still here?  Ok cool.  Anywho, my lack of skill with the sticks has led to a bit of a complex, in which my self-conscious insecurities manifest into paranoia that everyone is watching me.  In surveying the landscape for gawking, laughter, and finger pointing I came across a young female patron who was tightly clutching an infant doll.  Later, when she and her party were seated, she placed the doll on the table, legs dangling off the edge.  Although the doll didn't have a place setting nor did she offer it any food, school project or not, this still struck me as pretty odd.  Please leave your dolls and mental sicknesses at home.  Another individual in the same party, whom I will simply refer to as The Beast, also caught my attention.  Not only was she the type who could make onions cry, but as she raised another overflowing spoonful towards her mouth I swear I heard the noodles scream. Aside from the horrors I witnessed at the adjacent table, I couldn't have been happier with Daikokuya and its contributions to my burgeoning Asian food fetish.  Lastly, it was great meeting up with friends and fellow yelpers to share in the experience.  Because, contrary to all the soap opera drama and negativity that rears its ugly head at times, tasty food, stiff drinks, and good conversation and laughter amongst friends is what this site is truly about.

Good God the wait is almost unbearable at Daikokuya. Of course, we could all stroll a couple doors down to some other ramen place, but none of us do. We stand .. we sit ... we wait ... we walk to some other store ... we play on our phones ... we wait ... All while secretly hoping that another "no-show number" will be called so that we are magically one step closer to finally getting chosen. We contain the frustration and endure the wait ... all for the food:  the simple, yet delicious ramen and rice bowls of Daikokuya. The Kotteri Daikoku Ramen is worth the wait. It starts with a delicious n fatty Pork Broth infused with their secret Soy Sauce blend. The perfectly-prepared Chijire-style Egg Noodles can be cooked more firm on request, but it is not needed. Completing the large bowl is the right combination of thin n tender Kurobuta Pork Belly Chashu, a marinated Boiled Egg, Bamboo Shoots, healthy Bean Sprouts, lots of Green Onion, and Sesame Seeds. I recommend getting a combination with one of the small rice bowls because they are nearly as good as the ramen. The best? It is the Shredded Pork Bowl with extremely soft meat. It's like you're not eating pork.  Other recommendations are the Tempura Bowl for large tempura veggies and one tempura shrimp or the Tuna Sashimi Bowl with big slices of fresh tuna. On my list to try is the Salmon Roe Bowl. All combos are served with a cabbage salad which surprisingly tastes good, too. The Gyoza at Daikokuya stand out because of their unique open-ended wrapper and their garlicy freshness. An order of five is a great appetizer although I have to admit you probably don't need it because the combination is a lot of food. Of course, it's all better splitting a large bottle of Sapporo Beer. The hostess and waitress are busy, yet, just attentive enough. It's amazing how quickly the food comes out sometimes. The place may have a long wait, but they are ready to get you fed and on your way as quickly as possible. Hats off to the stellar service. Parking? Forget about it. Come after 8:00 to troll for a free spot on the streets of Little Tokyo or just simplify your life and park in one of the pay lots. Be sure to avoid the small lot across the street from Daikokuya. They tried to charge more than their advertised price. Come to Daikokuya prepared to wait. Come to enjoy the funky retro 70's Japanese decor. Come to share the combo Pork Bowl or Gyoza.  But most importantly ... come to Daikokuya to experience some great Kotteri Ramen.

I don't even know where to begin... If could only give 1 5 star rating to a place on yelp. It would be a tough call between Daikokuya and Shibuya in Calabasas (I dunno which place deserves it more!!) I will put up a damn good argument to anyone that argues that there is a better ramen join in Los Angeles. Yes, Orochon is right down the street, but that place freakin' blows and you know you're only going there cause you saw Adam Richman do their special #2 challenge (and majority of you aren't even going to do that challenge!) So if your not going to do their crazy challenge, all that's left for you is crappy ramen. I'd go on about santouka (nothing negative to say about the place except on the pricey side), but this review is on Daikokuya. You get the best out of your buck when you order their daikoku ramen (kotteri is a must!). Unless you eat A LOT, I normally just tell them to pack the side plate to go and I have that the next day for lunch or something. Their broth is FILLED with flavor. the Kotteri really brings out the richness of the broth. Each bite you take while the noodles soak in that delicious broth makes each mouthful better than the last. Everytime I've been to daikokuya, the pork is so soft that it almost melts in your mouth. and to finish the bowl, the egg... I'm lost for words. You just need to let your taste buds tell you how great it is. All this greatness coming to you in one bowl of ramen... There is absolutely no other place that can compare. If you're visiting LA, go to daikokuya FYI I heard mix reviews about their branches so GO TO LITTLE TOKYO!! Yes the wait maybe longer than other places, but be patient if you want the best.

First of all.. there's a sign on the door that says "New location opened in Monterey Park. (111 N. Atlantic Blvd Ste 241, Monterey Park, CA)" In addition there are two more locations. 1) 2975 Harbor Blvd, Costa Mesa, CA 92626 and 2) 15827 E. Gale Ave, Hacienda Heights, CA 91745 Also, they are No longer taking to-go orders. Anyway, I went here with Frank M this weekend since we were in the area.  It had just started raining, and it was already dinner time.  Perfect for ramen! We get there, and there's a sign in sheet on the other side of the door, on a little chair.  There are about 3 or 4 groups ahead of us. We waited around for 10-15 minutes before being called.  Niceee.  We also got one of the booths instead of the counters. :) I got the combination Daikoku Ramen with a small bowl of Pork Cutlet bowl. $11.50 (Also comes with a salad).  The salad was yummy.  Although It might be because there is mayonnaise in it.  Not sure.  A few minutes later, the small bowl of Pork Cutlet comes out.  It's pretty good.  I thought about getting the Shredded Pork, but got the Pork Cutlet instead.   I think it's a pretty good deal considering Daikoku Ramen is already $8.50!  You only pay $3 more for the extra bowl.   The ramen came out last.  It was delicious.  I've never had any other ramen before except for Cup O Noodles Ramen.. so I guess I'd have to say that this is the best Ramen I've ever had.  (But it doesn't mean much).  Also, these bowls are HUGE.  The bowls are about the size of a salad bowl. I didn't finish half of all the food brought out, so I took the ramen and Pork Cutlet bowl to-go.  Once at home, I got hungry again and had some more of the Ramen.  It tasted even better at home.  Although.. I left it in the fridge, and the soup solidified.  Not sure if it's because of all the fat that's in it.. I'd rather not think about it. ;) Anyway, the food was good.  The place is a little dirty.. and small, but I would probably go back here.

The soup broth isn't nearly as good as I had more than a year ago.  There is definitely not as much flavor packed in - it feels a little watered down.  It is still a huge bowl of piping hot ramen goodness, but it's definitely gone south. For those of you that think Daikokuya is the best ramen place, I say MEH to you.  Obviously you haven't tried Santouka in  Mitsuwa/Culver.  That currently holds the #1 spot in my stomach.   It's still decently priced for how big it is and the noodles are still as chewy/delicious as ever.  The gyoza is not to be missed, but I will pass on the wait.

Daikoku is one of Japan's Seven Gods of Luck, presiding over wealth and farmers. The suffix -ya at the end of nouns in Japanese make it the store of that noun. Daikokuya is certainly a store of richness! It didn't help that I watched the infamous ramen master scene from the movie "Tampopo" right before finally nabbing a seat at this renowned ramen place, which helped me mentally prepare for an epic ramen meal. The wait wasn't too terrible at the time I finally managed to sit at the bar which gave me full view of the ramen bowl making process. Anticipating one of those bowls being yours seemed like an eternity, as there were many before me who ordered their own bowls, and I waited in hunger and excitement for when one of those bowls landed in front of me. Then I had a moment of panic: What if I'm overhyping this only to leave me in disappointment? What if this was like when I resigned to the fact I was never destined to see Radiohead live at risk that they don't play live and crush my love for them forever? But I've seen Radiohead live and they were amazing, and once I had the giant Bowl of Goodness in front of me, I knew I had the closest thing nirvana could be in a noodle soup. The cloudy broth is rich yet smooth and not too salty, and the noodles were cooked to the perfect consistency of not too hard, not too soft. I sadly didn't touch my egg thinking strategically, aiming to finish the ramen and soup without the egg filling me up. The dish's coup de grâce, however, were the not two, but three looong slices of pork belly floating nonchalantly to one side of the bowl. Being a stickler for texture, I'm not usually one to eat meat with my ramen and happily surrender for a lucky and willing dining partner, but with just one look, these pieces weren't to be passed over. It wasn't long after my last trip to Germany, and these slices were reminiscent of wonderful Speck, and each time I took a bite of each savory piece, I was almost reduced to tears each time as the richness of the fat and meat melted in my mouth and turned to pure bliss. Soup like this is definitely worth the wait. My only complaint if there is one is the fact that I love my ramen served piping hot, and this bowl was served practically lukewarm. Had it been a good bit warmer, it would have been perfect.

Oh my dear Daikokuya, your legs must be tired because you've been running through my mind all week long. Your hot and steamy broth always warms me up on the coldest nights, even better than Brad Pitt's strong arms (just don't tell him I told you so; he would be mortified). Those tender pieces of meat you've got there? I love how they fall apart and melt at the slightest touch of my tongue, getting me more excited with each savory bite. And I know you love how I can meticulously slurp away at your noodles, stopping only when I've emptied your bountiful bowl. Mmmm... The only problem is that I know I'm not the only one. Seeing all those people waiting in line for you, just to get a taste of what should only be mine, never fails to strum that jealous string in my heart. But like everyone else, I fell for you the first time you touched my lips. And for that, you'll always own a part of me. God, I wish I knew how to quit you. Then again, I really don't. Because you're just THAT good.

Good to try at least once, but what is the big deal?? I was satisfied, yes. The food and service was good. I expected the long 45 minute wait so that was okay. However, the way some reviewers have built up the food here is crazy. I was excited to eat here. I read a lot of comments and bought into all the hype that mentioned "all time favorite" and "best ramen ever" - some written in CAPS. Man, I was pumped. My expectations were high. Maybe that was the mistake to begin with. I didn't get the OH MY GOD experience that some other people had. I mean, it wasn't much more memorable than a Shin-Sen Gumi or even Ajisen experience. In fact, I think Shin-Sen Gumi and Ajisen were more memorable experiences for me. Here, the thing I'll remember most is the long wait, not the food... and that isn't right. I over hyped this experience for myself. That's likely the problem. Plus, I don't know ramen enough to appreciate the whatever-it's-called, fancy pork fat that Daikokuya uses in their recipe. I actually got the combo meal, and chose the shredded pork rice bowl... which had good flavored, crispy shredded pork oozing with oil, fat, onion, green onion. So yes, it was good. I was stuffed. Can't complain about the service. It's a nice experience to try at least once - and maybe twice or thrice - but only during off hours because it's not worth the wait. Otherwise I'll be making my return to the other ramen restaurants to be satisfied all the same.

Its been a long time since my fellow yelpers have thrown me off about a place. I am absolutely shocked at the 5 stars for this place. After probably over a year of hearing about Daikokuya, I finally made it in. Lets start from the first impression (usually there is a long line for this place)- I am now convinced it isnt because the food is that great but because their seating consists of old booths that take up too much room plus a few spots at the bar. Next, they have a B. Now I am not a huge stickler on ratings and especially not at the B level, but man something was so off about this place. Everywhere looks dirty. Not old-school dingee or anything, but dirty. The minute I walked in there was a strong and pungent stinky chicken odor in the room. I have been to many Ramen houses and they dont smell this strong. We ordered the Gyoza which were pretty large and flavorful. Check plus on that one. Ok, so not many choices on the menu. Typical side dishes, one type of Ramen and a cold Ramen option. So, we obvisouly ordered the Ramen. Nothing special. At first the broth was so oily and reaked of stinky chicken that I had to add a lot of soy sauce to cut through that. $9 a bowl. Average. All in all, I would never come back here again. Nothing wowed me at all. So many better Ramen places in Little Tokyo and on Sawtelle on the West side of town.

Gluten free friends: Do not enter. Daikokuya is a trendy ramen restaurant with a large following to her many Los Angeles locations. Daikokuya does a few things right. Sparkling advertisements and a fabulous user-friendly website marries beautifully with social networking. Want to add their logo to your website or blog?! You are in luck! Awards are granted this prestigious ramen house by LA Weekly, Yelp and My Fox LA etc. I was sucked into the vacuum that is paying this place a visit by having my finger on the pulse that is otherwise known as being a yelp contributor and an avid yelp review reader. Unlike other ramen places, the menu offers a substantial number of options. But the options are all the same. Wheat, wheat and more wheat. Appetizers: tsukemono, (marinated vegetables) California rolls, roast pork, dumplings, tonkatsu (breaded pork chop) chicken teriyaki and other various tempura coated things. While none of the items greatly appeal to me, none of these items can be consumed by me given my wheat allergies:-( Specials? Sauce, broth, ramen, soup? while these things looked good to me, they are all drenched in soy sauce in each stage of the preparation and cooking process and are precooked, not made-to-order. Soy-free or gluten-free guests may not partake of anything from this segment of the menu. Rice bowls? Each bowl is precooked, either topped, marinated or fried in a wheat coating that makes each and every bowl item on the menu out of the questions for anyone with food allergies. Bento box? Tempura, teriyaki etc. Each and every menu item and option off limits to anyone with wheat or soy allergies. Finally, there are three desserts which are also off limits. Wheat, wheat and more wheat. Mochi (wheat based) , sweet soy sauce rice balls and more mochi (wheat based) with fruit. I ordered a bowl of steamed rice and a diet coke which was the only thing I could order. I've had better rice and a better diet coke elsewhere. My friends are crazy for bringing their gluten-free loser friend along! "You will be able to order something!" They assured me. :-( Any restaurant that can not make me any fresh food, like a piece of fish etc., can not be granted a high star rating from me. I've given high star rating to restaurants who can not feed me based on customer service or my companion's happiness. My friends were not entirely unhappy with their meals but neither were they shocked or quieted by the food. Rather than wrap the leftovers at the end of the meal, my friends gave the rueful look to the full plates of food which equated to the doggy bag not being worth the taking. To give this restaurant a fair overview, I suggest readers also read reviews written by authors who are able to partake of a larger portion of the menu. If you are a gluten-free friend reading this review, I hope to save you the gas money of coming here for the so-so steamed rice! :-)

Lotta red stars for this ramen house on average. The reviewers are basically right, this place serves up a one-two punch that edifies what ramen can aspire to in the noodle diaspora of the West. I reserve one star only because the wait can be discouraging. But certainly we've all waited a good time at popular eateries but if it's not fine dining, our expectation for food that is priced between the $7.50-$15 range is to be seated in under 40 minutes tops. But that's gastro-economical prejudice on our parts. It's small and maybe seats about 60 but the booths are first come-first serve and can be taken up by a couple who wandered in from Nova Scotia so if you're a small party or alone, the counter seat is your best shot. There is only one kind of hot ramen served here so your hungry mind isn't overwhelmed at a pointless array of ramen combinations that in some places include corn, seaweed, miso v. shoyu, chicken, mountain vegetables, bamboo shoots, or the kitchen sink. Like the fabled Chinese monks who perfect the single death punch all their lives, Daikokuya delivers a lethal single ramen with a miso colored, pork broth (boiled down from pork bones and shoyu) that is adorned with a hard-boiled egg that's marinated overnight and kurobuta (black pork) pork that is tender and fatty in the right amounts. For only $7.50, it is the steal of the City. If you're a control freak with fastidious tendencies, you can order the "tsukemen"  version which breaks up the component ramen parts into separate dishes: noodles in a bowl, broth in another bowl, and the rest in a final third bowl. You combine as you see fit in a ramenesque jigsaw wonder. If you're appetite allows it, do try their combinations. Ramen + fried rice. You'd think the ramen was all there'd be here but the other food is more than decent. Ramen + salmon roe bowl is one of my favs and even though it's an unlikely pairing, it somehow works. I also recommend a cold mug of Kirin on tap ($2). Why is Kirin beer so refreshing compared to Sapporo? Maybe they keep it chilled here to manufacturer's recommendations. I wouldn't put it past them here. And if you've ever been here and wondered what that white coffee-maker looking contraption with tubes coming out of it in the cook area is all about, it's their Kangen ionized mineral water system which either they use for cooking and/or as table water. Parking is not easy almost anytime of the day or night. I usually end up parking on Judge John Aliso St. Noodle up!

Some of the best ramen I've ever tasted, even compared to what I had the month I spent in Tokyo. Bowls are huge and steamy, broth is flavorful, and meat is done just right.. beers are cheap and available by the pint or pitcher. They've got garlic paste! We take the subway here and drink freely. If you drive you may have some difficulty finding parking.. My boyfriend usually goes for the pork ramen that comes with pieces of hard boiled egg (he's a egg freak). The summer ramen was awesome; served cold and perfect for a hot day. Sushi here is decent too. I really haven't gone wrong here yet. The line can be a wait (around 10-20 minutes or so). Don't go at peak times if you are afraid of the huge crowds and a longer line. The good news is that it's well worth the wait.

As with all my other ramen reviews (http://www.yelp.com/user…) - it's ramen. How good can it be? How bad can it be? In theory, fucking up ramen is like fucking up toast right? Came with a friend. Didn't get to experience the "horrid wait". Wait was 10 minutes at most. But I must say, it's nowhere I'll take a big group cuz this place is kinda small. Crowd is ridiculously diverse though - families, UCLA hotties, oh. and lots of chinese people. Chinese people love anything japanese. True story. Sat at the bar. Just got the daikokuya ramen that COMES with an egg, char sui, and bamboo shoots. Not like Asa where they charge you for EVERYTHING making your $8 ramen come up to $12. Didn't get nothing else. Obviously. Cuz i'm not with Yuko tonight or her ass would say something like "You cannot eat ramen without beer". Whatevs alcoholic. Good food overall. Not "tear up in ecstasy" good but then again what is? Do share.

What more is there to say bout this place? Hmmm...how bout what stood out the most on our last visit....   Green onions and loads of it!   Still the biggest bowl of ramen I've had! Shredded pork was fatty and grilled to flavor perfection. Major props to the nicely cooked soft boiled egg too! Definitely a fan of their fried rice also, especially with the ginger. Hands down, best ramen I've had in LA.   Well worth the wait!

My Personal Ramen Tour - Chapter 6 Meh, I don't understand the hype at all. If you make me stand outside in the cold for 45 minutes to have a bowl of ramen, it better be the best damn ramen ever. Daikokuya didn't even come close. I've has do-it-yourself ramen bowls from the 99c store that had better broth. Daikokuya wasn't all bad though. Their gyoza was pretty good and their fried rice was (I think) the best I've ever had. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… But their ramen, that sad sad ramen. Nothing about it wowed me. The broth was lacked any depth and had an after taste that didn't sit well in my mouth. The noodles were nothing to write home about and the portion was pretty skimpy if you ask me. The egg had a pretty thick green layer around it from being cooked too long. Why don't all ramen places give you soft bolied eggs!?!? Having some runny yolk is key! http://www.yelp.com/biz_… But at least I can say I tried "the best ramen" joint in LA. NOT! I'll never go back.

If you've ever seen that straight-to-video movie called the "Ramen Girl," you'll know that the lead character trains under a master ramen chef in Japan. He yells at her a lot, she cries a lot. The chef tells her she must put her heart and soul into the preparation of the broth. After a year of arduous training in Japan, she makes ramen topped with... corn, tomatoes, and peppers? Go figure. Aside from saving you 2 hours of your life in watching the movie, I thought it was interesting in providing a little bit of insight into the work that goes into making ramen. I've yet to visit Japan, so I can't vouch for the authenticity. All I do know, is that the flavors from the ramen broth don't come from some little packet of seasonings. Safe to say, that holds true here at this Little Tokyo location. I thoroughly enjoyed my kotteri style bowl of the house special ramen. The broth was intensely rich and flavorful, yet not overly salty. I was a bit disturbed by the molecules of pork fat floating on the top of the broth. The website says it's back fat. People are trying to get rid of their back fat by hitting the gym, and now I'm slurping it? Sounds bad, yes. But it perfectly clung onto every strand of noodle for some added back-fat flavor. The slices of pork was buttery and meaty at the same time. The bamboo and sprouts provided a nice and fresh, crunchy contrast in texture. There was a subtle hint from the strands of seaweed. Even the hearty mound of chopped green onions was tasty. And that egg? I could've eaten about a dozen of those. I'm sold on oozy and gooey yolk.

The obvious review: ~~~It's yummy.  The soup was just right, and the portion was huge! ~~~Price... $8.50 is damn cheap considering they give you the egg, lots of meat, and lots of noodles. ~~~The location could've used more ventilation. I felt so gross leaving that place ~~~ I actually prefer Santouka @ Mitsuwa in Costa Mesa as that location had more kick.  But, it was also close to $10.   ~~~ I was a little annoyed that it wasn't a full on hard-boiled egg (what's the damn culinary term for that?) considering that's my favorite part of the dish.   Conclusion to my obvious review:  Daikokuya is the place to go if you're in LA, and Santouka is the place to go for Ramen if you're in OC.  The end.

OMG - I waited over an hour, in the freezing cold, on a sunday night for a bowl or RAMEN... but it was the most delicious ramen I've ever had, and WELL worth the wait :) Came here with 2 friends and we all got the Daikoku Ramen ($8.50)! I wanted to be different and ordered the Tsukemen Ramen ($8.50) but totally regret that decision because its exactly the same thing! But since everything comes out separately, the noodles aren't heated with the broth  - so the ramen ends up being luke warm :( But I was still slurrping away and making "MMMM!!!" noises while I ate. It was REALLY REALLY  good. What makes it so good? The noodles and the broth. The noodles are SUPER chewy, thick - cooked just right.  And the broth was really flavorful - kind of like a miso soup. So it went well with the bean sprouts, green onions, and mushrooms. With the endless ginger and garlic on the side (my japanese kimchi substitute) - it was ramen heaven!!! As the other yelpers mention, the fried rice is really good also. So one of us actually got the combination of Daikoku Ramen and a small fried rice ($10.95) - this combination also comes with a tiny salad. The fried rice is really worth trying and it was nice having a little variety :) STREET PARKING!! If you go further away from J town.. you'll have better luck :) I love walking so I didn't mind! Definite MUST TRY if you're in LA!!!

Is "Daikokuya" Japanese for "We'll make you wait as long as we freaking want to because we're freaking awesome and can do whatever we freaking want"? No?  Really?  Could've fooled me.   Daikokuya's ramen (easy to find because there's only ONE on the menu) is utterly, undeniably, remarkably fantastic.  Jonathan Gold, you don't lie...this place is a MUST VISIT in LA.  The richer, Kotteri style which you can get at no extra cost was also a must have for me.  From the delicate slices of meat, to the perfect-to-sink-your-teeth-into soft boiled and marinated egg, to the mountain of green onions, to the "there's just something special about it" ramen noodles... from the first bite, Daikokuya is a cut above any ramen I've ever had before. As if that weren't reason enough, their homemade Gyoza are also just damn noticeably better than what you've had before.   Let me say it again.  Daikokuya's ramen is a MUST TRY for any food loving soul within a 60 mile radius of Downtown LA.  You'll learn to master its quirky clipboard system, you'll happily endure the wait, and you'll even relish in its ominous (but not totally surprising) B health inspection rating.  It's chopstick lickin' good.

First and foremost, I'm ignorant. I thought Ramen was dehydrated noodles, stuffed with a flavoring packet lovingly wrapped in a plastic pouch or something that I poured hot water into a Styrofoam cup with dehydrated vegetables. Wa-la! Ramen, right? Someone slap me silly! After a nice round of basketball earlier in the day and hardly any sleep since coming back to L.A. from Ventura County, my cohorts and I were starving. We needed some substance. That's when Mike F. suggested, Daikokuya. Ramen? Real Ramen? Is there such a thing? Of course upon arriving we stuffed our faces a bit silly with other treats in Little Tokyo, and when we got here, as usual, there was a wait. It looked longer than it actually took (20 minutes or so) and boy, was the wait worth it! Rick and Mike told me about getting a combo since they know I'm a hefty man with a hefty appetite. I believe I got the Ramen and porkchop cutlet. Oh man, oh man, oh man!! When it finally did arrive, it was a HUGE bowl of soft egg noodles, tender, juicy slices of pork, in a soothing, flavorful broth. My porkchop cutlet/omelette-ish on a bed of rice. Talk about eating!! After sweating it out and nearly finishing my broth (noodles, gone) and my cutlet, I was so happy, I was rubbing my belly in great pleasure. Especially since now it's winter time, this is going to be a favorite spot of mine to go for the next coming months. Oh how I was so ignorant to what Ramen really is and I will never look at prepackaged, dehydrated noodles the same. I have a new lover, her name is Daikokuya.

Wow, this place has a lot of reviews!  Here's my 10 cents, my 2 cents is free. Went here for the first time one evening last week.  The place is small, with some seats at the bar and some tables.  From other reviews, it looks like the wait can be pretty bad here, but it wasn't too bad for us at 7:30 on a Wednesday night.  They have a pretty good menu, offering more than just ramen.  In addition, they have various appetizers, fried rice, chow mein, sushi, teriyaki, etc.  Of course, being a ramen joint, I had the ramen.  I got the Daikoku ramen, kotteri style (a little thicker broth).  You can tell them how firm you want the noodles, so I got mine a little soft.  The ramen comes with a hard boiled egg, chashu pork, bamboo shoots, etc.   My opinion among the 289 others currently here, it was a tiny bit above average (hence the 4 stars, I'm feeling generous).  It was good, and I would definitely come back, but it wasn't anything mind blowing.  The pork was kind of thin and the broth was bland.  I put some red pepper in to spice things up a little, but even then it was just average.   It wasn't a ton of food either.  I was still hungry afterwards.  I think next time I'll try the combination where you get a salad and a bowl of rice with your choice of a meat and egg on top.  One of the people I came with got that and it was good.  The rice had a good flavor from the pork juice and the salad had a really good dressing on it.  Also, you can get the noodles cold, with the broth and all the ingredients separate. As I said, it was good and I would come back, but given the choice I'd rather make the drive down to the South Bay and go to Asa for some 5 star ramen. Oh, yeah, we did see Kevin Sorbo from Hercules in here (at least I think it was him).  No Xena though!

4 stars only because its A)Cash only (Little Tokyo) B) So small. Ramen other wise is the biz! Hands down Daiko makes some of the best broth. Service is fast and the Daiko ramen combo is a savior with the half side additions like fried rice to sashimi. Only sucky thing is the wait. The place is soo small I would say a party of 4 would be perfect and nothing more. The wait is a bit of a pain BUT nothing like Daikokuya :) oh yeah! Manga collection in the corner when waiting :)

My good buddy from highschool and USC was in LA over the weekend visiting his sis.  I drove down to visit this ramen-ya since I heard it was the best.  My friend thinks I was visiting him. So my friend asks what I want to do this weekend.  I say, eat ramen.  He says, what else?  I say, don't worry I know of alot of new ramen places in LA to try. The noodles here are fantastic.  Nice and chewy delicious.  As good if not better than the noodles I had in Hawaii.  The broth was tonkotsu style, very refined taste... no distinct over-powering flavor, solid overall.  The table has ginger and garlic, which both make a nice touch to the broth. In a word, damn good bowl of ramen.  Hmmm, one word.... damn. The gyoza was homemade, but was rectangular like some crazy kid made it out of playdo.  It was nice but I was daydreaming about more ramen.  We had to leave, people waiting. Goodbye empty ramen bowl, it was nice to meet you.  And my friend, nice to see you again too.

This place is just too popular. Every single time I have come here on an evening, there's always a 2 hour wait. Or if there isn't a wait, it is because they are 'sold out'. I've never had the patience to wait  that long to eat, since there are so many other delicious eateries within walking distance. But this afternoon, after a day of treacherous boredom waiting in the purgatory known as the Criminal Justice building Room 503, aka the Jury duty service waiting room, I broke free of final judgment! At the time I was wondering what to do with my new found freedom. Should I go home and make myself a nutritious dinner? Boooring. Or should I call up Daikokuya and check how long the wait is.. Hm.. Over the phone, I hear, "No wait." What? No wait!?!  Ok... I'm there! A hop, skip, and a jump later, I'm sitting at the ramen bar ordering a Daikoku ramen. I patiently waited for just a few minutes, and soon a hot bowl of delicious aroma is placed in front of me. The Daikoku ramen features thin, soft, yet crispy noodle with a good bite, fresh crisp bean sprouts, slivers of green onions, bamboo shoots, layers of fatty tonkatsu pork meat, and a soy sauce-marinated boiled egg immersed in a smooth creamy, fat-laden pork broth. The pork broth is worthy of praise as it is heavily reduced to provide the deepest flavors of pork in its purity. How else could you get such a coloring and such a "creamy" soup without a milky base? The tonkatsu was soft, smooth, fatty and velvety.. and the egg yolk was cooked medium, and left just a perfect texture of creamy.. This, my yelpers, is a good ramen. However, although I can taste and see why so many people love this ramen, it is not my favorite ramen in Los Angeles. This definitely kicks the crap out of Shin Sen Gumi Hakata ramen, but my favorite is still from a joint inside the Mitsuwa marketplace -- Santouka's spicy miso ramen. I personally prefer the thicker, crisp texture of the noodle at Santouka, the saltier combination of spice and miso in the soup base, and the leaner cuts of tonkatsu. Nevertheless, Daikokuya is pretty darn good and does live up to its name. It's not a place you can skip out trying and eating at least once while in L.A.

I think my friend put it best: the awesomeness of the food is not greater than or equal to the time you spend waiting to get a table. The ramen is highly overrated here. We waited for about 55mins, which is fine, it's a Saturday night, I had read all the glorious reviews of this place, and didn't mind waiting for something that was going to be supposedly epic. I have big sanitary issues with this place. We were sat at the bar, so we got a peek into the kitchen the whole time. A couple of things: A guy opened boxes with his hands, switched hands, and then dipped his box-hand into the pork slices and threw them into the bowls of ramen to be served. Then he picked his butt, and proceeded to put the noodles in the basket and toss them around with his butt-hand. Ick. As for the ramen, it was very mediocre. The noodles reminded me of the cheap "Top Ramen" noodles from grocery stores. And I hope you like green onions.. there's about a 1/2 cup of them in the soup. The pork slices inside the soup were all fat.. Which made me sad. I sat there and picked up all the pieces trying to find 1 little bite of meat, I could not. Sigh. $41 for 3 people, 55 minute wait, I will not be returning.

I never do this, but it just encompassed everything I felt about this place, so from my old pal Jonathan C.'s review: "What else could possibly be said about the place that has about a billion five star reviews? Don't ask any questions. Just go. Get the Daiko ramen and the shredded pork bowl combo. And another tip: even though every ounce of your being will want to take another bite, stop when you're full! They have to-go containers and then the bliss that is Daikokuya can extend into the next day (and trust me, it stays delicious even after being reheated)!" It delights me that in his review he tells you to get my usual. The Daiko Ramen w/ small shredded pork bowl combo. This comes with a salad,but I usually tell them I don't want it. It's entirely too much food for me. And taking salad home is always a little weird. Prices are fantastic, portions are generous, and it's the best pork ramen in town. A lot of people talk about how long the wait is...I came with a group of 5 and we waited 45 minutes....but it felt like nothing because we popped into Far Bar down the street and checked in every 20 minutes or so to see how far down the list we were. Worked out perfectly! Parking can be a pain...we shelled out $8 on a Saturday night. Other than that, it's just as amazing as I remember and it makes great leftovers.

"My first hot and steamy UYD"   Yeah, that's right, I said, "UYD."  It was such a cold night last night and I was sitting here late at work and then I get a call, "Wanna come out?"  I'm excited and lick my lips just thinking about it.  MMMMM... A car comes to pick me up...It's sleek and blue...It's already starting to feel warm and fuzzy inside as we take dangerous turns in the streets of Downtown LA.  I'm thrilled and there's shivers in my spine.  I take off my jacket.   It only takes one smile and we're sitting in a cozy booth together... Laughing, smiling, talking like there's no tomorrow... Like we match in every way... We're brought hot and steamy bowls of Ramon that's perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The broth is flavorful and doesn't taste like packaged stuff.  An order of gyoza completes the picture because we're alike: we think girls shouldn't diet.  How perfect.... Such warm fuzzies...And then it was over as quickly as that.  A quick hug and I'm dropped off... I just hope I get another call within three days and another date with Felicia C...

Things today are sometimes just so easy. Too easy, I might venture. What's life without a little challenge? This evening around 8pm, I got a powerful hankering for some ramen. Suddenly NOTHING else would do. "Daikoku!" I declared. Being a faithful reader of my favorite reviewers, I knew that we were staring down the barrel of a good 45 minute wait. And this is not including the 10 minutes to get there and (at least) 10 minutes to park. But did we balk in the face of potential starvation? Well. Yes. And standing outside, minute after minute, feeling the energy drain from our tired and depleted bodies, did we mention more than once that "maybe we should just go somewhere else?" Oh yes, my friends. We did. Usually I'm game to be a quitter for something easier and faster. But something powerful came over me tonight, and we stuck it out until we were seated at the kind of cramped and dirty-ish counter. And was it worth it? Did the challenge pay off? Sweet Mother of God, did it ever. No big choices. No problematic "what to add?" or "which broth to choose?". You get the best damn pork ramen in town, with the most deliciously cloudy broth and fatty, tender slices of pork. A mound of green onions adds some punch to the subtly complex flavors. Having done my homework, we also ordered gyoza. Delicious! Some kind of fish or seafood was definitely tucked inside the delicate dumpling. We also ordered the pork cutlet bowl. Sweet, served with scrambled egg and moist sushi rice, it was by far the best donkatsu experience ever. In conclusion, my fellow fast foodies and microwavers, I advise even the hungriest to push on through the wait. I drove home as fast as possible to get out of my jeans that were about to split, more gastronomically satisfied than I've been in awhile.

After reading so many great reviews on yelpo and being in the L.A. area, we decided to give this place a try!   We arrived in Tokyo town, with limited parking space, we spotted Daikokuya, one of the many small, teeny tiny eateries.  we waited 40 minutes for a table, it was insanely busy & crowded. it was a rainy, cold day - perfect ramen weather! the wait was pretty much worth it. When we sat, we ordered almost right away, the service was quick! The waitress immediately brought us their very delicious salad, i think the dressing made it what it was. We all ordered the combo Daikokuya Ramen Bowl + a small bowl of food (such as shredded pork, sashimi, pork cutlet and chicken -all over white rice).   Ramen: VERY LARGE BOWL. It was all great, the broth was FULL OF FLAVOR, very good, enough noodles in the bowl, came with a large egg and PLENTY of green onions floating inside the bowl along with tender yummy pork. Along with the combo deal, me, louie, maureen and bj also had their fried rice (which was so good, chopped up pork and small veggies).  Also had the Gyoza appetizer -fresh & hot. A side note, on the table they have condiments, and one of them is garlic, which i sadly found at the end of my meal, so i did not get to enjoy it inside my ramen broth. I think it would have made a world of difference if i had added the garlic. The broth was good in it's natural, naked state, if garlic was added this place might've got a 5 from me.  Next time! A great experience and a great find!

Side note: Zulu George Takei, (pronounced Takay, rhymes with Gay) got married to his long time partner Brad Altman over the weekend at the Japanese American Cultural Museum.  Full story here (http://news.yahoo.com/s/…) What does this have to do with Daikokuya. Nothing. I just thought I mention it because on my way to Daikokuya this Sunday, the side entrance of the museum on 1st street was closed and draped with a black cloth with a couple of big guys standing in the front. Now on with the real review.... First impression, this place was smoky. It was like a bad day out of the LA smog infested summer. At least to my pleasure, the smoke was the the marriage of tasty meat and sauces. Upon ordering, the waitress has a digital PDA which I thought was really cool for a traditional Japanese ramen joint. I opted for the combo with side of eel and rice, $12.95. HS got the combo with Katsudon, $11.50. Service at the counter was quick and our food arrived in less than 10 minutes.  It also comes with a side of cabbage slaw salad with what tasted like a infused thousand island + miso dressing. The eel and the katsudon were simple and top restaurant grade. It was done fresh and it was just really delicious. As for the ramen, I choose, "less oily" on mine. Not the best pick because it tasted slightly watered down. However, it was good enough that I drank most of the broth anyways. The ramen was on the firmer side, really perfect.  The side condiments of the roasted garlic and the ginger is a must have to infuse more flavor into the broth. I walked outta here full, happy, and smelled like fried rice. Do come here hungry and maybe a shirt to change.

The sun was still out when we queued up for a table for two, and we were probably 15th in line. When we finally got seated, the sun was already setting, giving the rest of Little Tokyo a sweet orange glow. They conveniently have their menu facing outside the window so you get an idea of what to order before being seated. I didn't understand the hype of this place but my boyfriend said it's one of his personal favorites, and according to some websites it's a must to eat here. Partial apathy from my hunger pangs made me cave in and it took much of my will-power to suppress all the bitching from waiting so long - by 'so long' I mean ~45 minutes. You can find yourself being entertained by the adjacent stores and pick up the latest Dir en Grey cd to keep you occupied if you wish. Upon entering, you get a feel of how efficient all the servers are, they waste no time getting food to you. They're fast without making you feel pressured to leave right after you finish eating. It's a small restaurant but they somehow manage to circle around the tables without so much as spilling anything. Also, I like the decor of the place; randomly put together but oddly enough it makes sense. The Godzilla bust on top of the door frame gave a nice touch. So I ordered their daikoku ramen + small bowl of tuna sashimi priced at $12.50. When my order finally came, I was surprised at how huuuuuge the bowl was and how filling it is. Most ramen joints I've been to that offered sashimi as a side dish normally skimp out by serving you smaller pieces with badly proportioned amount of rice underneath of it. My order also came with a small side of shredded lettuce & 1000 Island dressing being passed off as 'salad'.  Nevertheless, this appeased my cravings for good ramen, and after having my fill, I totally forgot about how long I waited just to get a seat. Totes worth coming thru for some late night ramen. Stop by if you're craving for a bowl on a Sunday night coz they're open til 11pm!

I was here last night with my friend for a birthday dinner since I can't join in on the festivities on Saturday. Okay, I'm not sure what the whole hype about this place is and why I had to stand out there for 45 minutes just to get seated for mediocre ramen.  I mean, I'm giving it 3 starts because of their superb service and high energy.  The guys who work there must REALLY LOVE WORKING THERE!   So, onward with the food review: - Spicy Tuna Rolls: ***** Delicious! You've got to order one of these! - Ramen: *** It was OK.  The texture was fine.  Not enough ingredients. I love onions, sprouts, bamboo shoots, etc. But I want more! Only 2 pork slices? I've had ramen where they gave me 4-6 slices, elsewhere.  The portion was too much. I got full so fast and I still had almost 1/2 left over. So.... if you want to wait in line for 45 minutes - 1 hour, go give it a try.  If not, go somewhere else. Ramen is ramen. I think I cook better, though. :)

3 overall.... People who know Ramen take it very seriously. But, let's all remember  that Ramen is like wine: some like red, some like white, some like it sweet, some like it dry.....the same is true for miso or shio broth? thin or chewy noodles, etc. So keep that in mind. thank you! :) THE ORDER: Gyoza- 4 stars, pretty yummy....great textures, tart sauce....topped with lots of green onion.... Combo Ramen with small Fried Rice - 3 stars....Ramen was just OK and pretty boring.....the broth was good, but the dish was boring to me. I dunno if the egg was meant to be cold, but i did not like it, and i love all things egg, so.....yah. even after i loaded up the broth with a little heat, garlic, and ginger, it still was missing some zing. The fried ricewas turned out to be fabulous after adding garlic and ichimi powder. The fried rice is great immersed in the soup while in the spoon. YUM. THE SERVICE: 3.5 stars....nothing out of this world, but efficient and friendly. OVERALL: Any place that has crushed garlic, ichimi powder, and pickled ginger to take as much as you want right in front of you is great in my book! I just feel as though I prefer Atch-Kotch and Shen Sen Gumi MUCH more to Daikokuya....but everyone is very unique when it comes to how they like their ramen... enjoy!! xo- andrea

On Thursday just a few strokes past noon, my flight touched down on the scorched earth known as Southern California, literally over 105 F on average these past few days. It was a matter of life and death to get out of the airport and into shelter right away. My stomach was growling as well, and time was running short. Luckily traffic was light, and within 20 mins I made it to downtown LA by the edge of Japantown to check out one of LA's finest ramen-ya's. The kanji for Daikokuya loosely translates to "Big Black Family" or "House of Big Black". What's big black? Hmmm.... better not be a male bear schlong! But it could also be representative of the black pork (kurobota) they use for the chashu in their ramen. The interior of Daikokuya looks a bit run down and the location's age/history has everything to do with it. The place was not crowded as we walked in on the dot of 1:30 pm, and grabbed the 2nd to last booth seat. The counter seats were empty. I like the fact that Daikokuya offers only one broth, which is their signature shoyu tonkotsu ramen, one size, with bean sprouts, chashu (black pork kurobota), menma (bamboo shoots) and to be politically correct, a f**kload of scallions (negi). Would have been a nice touch had they used Tokyo Negi instead, but I'm sure costs had to be cut to deliver that bowl. I got a bit greedy and got a combo, much like what Ed M. did (also visitng from Northern California). Except I settled for oyako-don (chicken with egg and onion) instead of pork chop. It arrived in a humble sized small bowl, about 1.5x the size of a typical bowl of miso soup. The oyako don was supremely delicious. It was cooked the way it should have been, although a tad bit sweet. Not a big deal though, and it actually tasted like a good suikyaki (especially the way the egg and onions melded their flavors together). They used Japanese rice, not the crap that most other places serve in Northern California. For a ramen-ya to nail down oyako-don is quite an accomplishment! Then again you Southern Cal people have it great with so much variety. Literally your shizzle is my shiznit, even if you think their verison is just average. For those who know the SF Bay Area ramen scene, will surely know the North Pole presents guy ramen (just kidding), Santa ramen. Yes they are famous for their Hakata style tonkotsu white broth ramen, but it has so much MSG in it that it is no longer appealing. Luckily Daikokuya's shoyu tonkotsu is not only light and fresfhing, it doesn't make you feel glutton, naughty, and evil after eating it. In fact it was almost a sin not to finish the broth. While it did not have too much depth, it was still a good flavor and perfect. Just as well, as I didnt' want to walk back out into 105 to 110 weather and then drop into a MSG induced starch coma right away on the street, then turn into a piece of aka maguro and melt into the scenery. Got a side order of the gyoza as well. As Ed M has so eloquently put it already, freshly made and presented. I like the fact that it was molded and folded to look anything unlike the traditional dumpling/gyozas. In fact when the plate of gyozas arrived at the table, I thought I was in a dim sum restaurant, as the plate looked like those Cantonese style chu cheung fun/rice vermicelli plain rolls/banh cuon! Luckily they were not. I also appreciated that they layered the gyoza's with a f**kload of scallions, good stuff. The waitstaff provided small plates of gyoza dipping sauce, and there wasn't a need to add any help yourself minced garlic, it was already quite flavorful. One pet peeve of this place....the ramen noodles were curly/wrinkly, a bit on the hard side, and reminded me of the famous Korean packet instant noodle, the spicy kimchee Shin Ramyun. That was a slight turnoff. Well to be fair there is some MSG in the food here. Though the after effects by itself aren't that bad. However it certainly didn't help that I almost overate, and it was 110 F or so, which had a snowballing effect. Starch coma + MSG attack + heatwave makes for a very interesting experience. If you can survive this you can eat anywhere and come out a survivor (then go back in for more). But overall I had great vibes at this place. I'd love to come back again next time I'm in LA. Sadly I had to overhear three banshees from Hong Kong at the booth behind me, talking their usual gossip of when to go back to Hong Kong, exams and school/college stuff. I wish they kept their volume down so I could hear myself enjoy my meal (slurp slurp slurp, munch munch munch, god I'm so full, crikey it's so hot I'm sweating my undies are sticking to my ass, I dont' wanna go outside to get the car in the heat, I'll melt and look like a piece of toro)

I finally decided to wait in line and try it!  So I'm gonna break down the ramen as follows Noodle         4 stars Broth            3 1/2 stars (Not the Koteri Broth Pork             2 stars I rate the pork at 2 stars in comparison to Santouka's. I will come back again to try it with the koteri broth before I made up my mind that Santouka is better. But even if Daikokuya's broth is better, the pork is no where close as good as Santouka. I ordered the combination and choose the shredded pork. This is really really good  5 stars. All in all I become a fan of Daikokuya. I love the atmosphere here. As soon as we step in, i felt I was in tokyo...maybe because this place is small?

I have been eating Ramen since I used to wear PJs with feet on them.  It's serious food to me and I've walked up and down 1st street and the Little Tokyo area trying every Ramen shop over the years. One day I saw this new place with a bright yellow awning and thought I give it a shot.  There was a lady wearing a dress with a perm sitting on a stool (must be the owner), and the guy with the super long beard with head dress doing ramen (I call him the Ayatollah of Ramen).  Hmmm... only hard core Japanese people in here.  No one speaking english.   So I ordered a cold beer, ramen with fried rice, sashimi, salad, and tempura.   As my food arrived one by one, I was amazed at how good it was.  The salad was the best ever in a Ramen shop.  Even the sashimi and tempura were good!  When I tried the Ramen I thought I was going to cry as it was so good.  The broth here is rich in flavor and read on how they create it while you're waiting. As time went on people starting catching on, ugh!  There were now english and mandarin speaking customers!  Now I had to start putting my name on a piece of paper in front like self serve reservations.  Now a days there are people waiting outside and it's that good.  If you want the best Ramen in LA you'll have to wait for it but it's worth the wait.

Best Ramen on the west coast.  (Santoka should be equally good but I have not had it yet in US.)   They only have one type of broth and they make that broth perfect.  It is shoyu based with boiled pork bones.  After the pork bone is boiled in for over a day, something else is added to the broth, something fish, I think, but I couldn't figure it out.  Best broth ever.  The noodles are chewy to the last bite.   You can either get the Daikoku ramen which has the broth, noodles, egg, scallions, bamboo shoot, black pork cha-shu or you can get the Daikoku tsukemen, which is all of the above separated.  They also sear the pork cha-shu first.  I don't know what this does exactly but I thought it was interesting.   I also think they do something to the scallions because its loaded with scallions but you don't leave with the scallion breath.  The egg is boiled for over a day as well in some secret sauce.  Anyways, best ramen on west coast.

I don't know what I'm talking about, so don't fault me. I hadn't seen Daikokuya on TV, didn't know about the hype. I was going to an event in Little Tokyo with a friend, and we wanted to eat first. I Yelped "Little Tokyo," "noodles" (her choice - I can't get enough sushi lately), and "sort by rating," and thousands of us had ranked this restaurant. An average of four stars after more than a thousand reviews is a must. So we went. Early. I anticipated a long wait. We were sat immediately at the bar. Fine. She ordered the ramen bowl for which they are known; I got a bento box with tempura and tuna sashimi. We both got our ways. I got a large hot sake and we shared a large beer; she ended up drinking about a quarter of my sake. Ok. Fine. The gracious service was awesome, the huge portion of ramen was awesome, the beautifully prepared bento box was awesome, the sashimi was awesome, the beer was awesome, and the full sake was awesome. The fact that we got seated on a Tuesday at 5:50 was awesome. The fact that I saw Steve Buscemi there was awesome. The fact that he was wearing something like Bermuda shorts was awesome. The fact that the chefs were speaking Japañol was awesome. The fact that we came out of there spending $20 each, with tax and tip, was awesome. Why, then, only four stars? I guess I'm biased. I was prepared for the most amazing, piss-my-pants fabulous ramen/bento box of my life. I was prepared for a foot rub. An orgasm. A red carpet. And I must go back, I guess, to get this spicy thing everyone is raving about. I LOVE HOT food ... like "Man Vs. Food" hot (Hello? Woman Vs. Food?), like Southern Thai done right hot, like I can drink that habañero salsa hot, like hand me the wasabi hot ... but nothing like that was featured on the menu .... I don't think. Maybe I'm blind?

broooothhhhhhh!!! When it comes to thick ramen broth, Daikokuya's rests sturdly on the mountaintop of perfection with no signs of a strong wind to blow it off it's well deserved pedestal. I believe it shares that spot with the legendary yet illusive Sentouka - which is nestled indiscreetly at SOME Mitsuwa's and also closes at like 8pm :( So like many many....many many reviewers may have mentioned, you want to get the thickest broth possible here - Kotteri style. And arteries be damned as the bacon fat infused opaque creaminess latches to your capillaries like velcro to an Afro. It's a delicious meal and most ramen aficionados really love this spot. But all of us can agree that we wish they would find a bigger location after all these years. God knows they can afford it! Instead they keep the location small and the lines huge. Matter of fact, the wait is so long, my friend Kenji and I TRIED to go here three times but never had the time to wait. The wait is so long, my friend finished an online course... We waited so long the recession ended and came back again. We waited so long we forgot what we were waiting for. We waited so long that we became really really ridiculously hungry. We waited so long we could have gone to two other ramen shops, read the Sunday Times, written a Yelp review of the other two spots, and still not have been seated. By the way the wait to be seated is pretty long. No resos. Try to go when the line isn't long and it's more than worth it. -1 for the crazy waits.

Out of all the places to eat in LA, I go here twice in one weekend. The first time was a Friday around noon, when luckily my friend Darren and I got seated right away. WAY abnormal for this place apparently. Took Darren's advice and ordered the ramen without checking out the menu, and wow. Wow. There are no words for the ramen really. Just wow. And mmmm. Oh, and green onions. Lots of them. I used to hate them in my saimin/ramen as a kid, but Daikokuya does green onions right. Mmmmm.... We came here again the next night, and as I'm sure all the regulars know, trying to get a seat at Daikokuya on a Saturday for dinner is like waiting in line for Madonna in San Francisco. The 3 of us were about 20th in line when we signed in at 8 pm. I think we waited almost an hour. Try the lobby in the hotel across the street if you want somewhere to sit, which was what we did. What bums we are! Hey man, it was chilly outside. Got the same thing, this time with the kokkeri broth. Tastes the same, just oilier. Here's to dreaming of Daikokuya ramen and marinated hard-boiled egg all day, every day...

I love ramen noodles and Daikokuya is my favorite place in LA to enjoy this treat.  A former Top Chef contestant (who I personally know) from the inaugeral season highly recommends Daikokuya for the fantastic ramen noodle soup WITH EXTRA PORK FLAVOR and makes it a point to stop in here very often.   The exhileration of stopping in here and smelling the aromas of the pork eminating from behind the "decorative black curtain" and savoring the ramen noodle soup with great anticipation makes it all worth it. Extra pork flavor please! As you can imagine, Daikokuya is extremely popular and each time I've been here I've had to wait close to 30-45 minutes for a seat, stepping through the "decorative black curtain" and giving my name and how many in my party. The place itself is very cramped and crowded with table seating and counter seating in very close quarters. As much as I enjoy good company, I do try to stop in here with no more than one other person, since table seating here is in very high demand and the chances of being seated quicker are better if dining solo at the counter (they still have to seat you). I do enjoy sitting up at the counter and watching my food being quickly prepared. I can see and smell of pork bones simmering in a huge pot and savor the flavors (like Homer Simpson drooling over beer and donuts). I usually get the specialty of the house, which is a big bowl of Daikoku Ramen with extra pork flavor which has very firm texture noodles,  tender pork,  bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, green onions, sesame seeds, and a boiled egg in a very hearty pork broth. This ramen soup is very filling and satisfying to eat with good flavors and a slightly salty taste. I always leave here happy. Daikokuya is definitely the real deal when it comes having the best ramen noodle soup. Daikokuya now has other locations in the SGV and the OC, which are very convenient for me to get to.

I just finished eating here about an hour and a half ago and I'm still full! I am agreeing with most other reviewers here - this place has great ramen.  I feel like I'm back in Japan at a corner ramen store downtown.  The noodles are delicious, the broth is nice and salty, and the boiled egg is one of the best parts.   I give it one less star than perfect for several reasons.  The first is that the place is almost miserably too hot.  It was such a relief to leave and get a breath of fresh air.  The second is that I think $8.50 is too expensive for ramen...I'm used to paying maybe $5-$6.  The third is that I wish they had different ramen variations.  I like trying different broths with different toppings.  Even though even if I had different choices I still would've chosen the Daikokuya ramen, it would be nice to have the choice to have something different.  And also it seems this place gets quite a wait.  We were there at 2pm on a Monday and there was still people waiting in front of us. Undeniably some great ramen, I will definitely be back for more.

AAAAHHHHHGGGGGHHHH... That's the sound of me drooling over Daikokuya. How can tonight be my first time here? How could I have not heard of this wonderful, delicious, explosion of flavor before Yelp? I don't know how but it doesn't matter. I'm hooked. The ramen here is like crack...not that I know what crack is like but I figure, if I'm going to get hooked on something, it might as well be this. The broth - super flavorful. On first sip, the only thought in my mind is "Am I going to have enough?" I had a whole bowl in front of me but all I wanted was more. MORE. I want it all! The noodles were perfectly cooked, I couldn't have chosen a better consistency myself. The pork was totally tender and the egg was perfect against the other flavors. Hands down, one of top two best bowls of ramen I've had - EVER. If you're talking about Los Angeles ramen, nothing else can compete! I'm still drooling...ahhhhhgggghhhh...

You know how sometimes you don't want to review a great place to not give it away? yeah, but I guess with almost 2000 reviews as of today, there is no point in hiding it anymore lol. Daikokuya is my favorite ramen among all of the Ramen places I've had so far in LA, also they have the best freaking FRIED RICE, yes fried rice!! Let's talk about the ramen. They give a whole load of lovely toppings, my favorite being the Pork. It melts in your mouth and has such rich flavors, and they give you 3 big slices of that yumminess. My 2nd is the egg, wow the yolk is in this interesting consistency and it tastes so good. I think they must inject each egg with something because I don't think the flavors could get in there any other way. The noodles are always cooked perfect, I guess the fancy word al dente comes to mind. The hakata ramen broth is far better than what they serve at Shin-Sen Gumi IMHO. If you go, consider getting a combo. You get this shredded cabbage salad with this dressing that to this date I haven't exactly figured out what it is. It is amazingly delicious however. The salad dressing must have green onion extract in it with the orange colored mayonnaise like substance that is awesome. Finally the fried rice. This really is the best fried rice, beating all the fried rice I've had. The fried rice is cooked with the same kurobuta pork used to top the ramen. The kicker is that it must be stir fried in extracted pig fat. It is so good. There's no way I can finish the ramen and the fried rice, so the rice usually makes a great 2nd meal! Wait is long, bring a book or a few chatty friends.

It's packed always. They have iphones for and order pad.  Service is a bit rushed but very efficient. Noodles are good but the soup base is on the watery side.  I like it thicker and more fat please!  They are a bit stingy with the green onions and with the bean sprouts.  I always ask for extra.  But i do not go here anymore the wait and the rush is just not worth it.  Also i'm trying to eat less carbs...not really working out for me.

I'm sure there's nothing more I can add to the 1800 other reviews before mine, but just in case you need one more, then here you go: this place is chubby bunner approved! Easily the best ramen I've ever had in LA! You MUST go for the Daikoku Ramen + Small Fried Rice combo ($10.95). The ramen broth is what sets this place apart from other ramen restaurants. It's deep, rich, savory, flavorful, so multi-dimensional--it's impossible to find broth like this anywhere else! The ramen is the crinkly sorts of ramen--not the greatest but the broth more than makes up for it.  As for the fried rice, I usually don't approve of greasy foods but I make an exception to this case cuz the extra grease is the reason why it's so damn tasty. And as always, be patient with this place... it's a small joint with very little seating. So do not come hungry because you'll be in for at least a 20-40 minute wait.

OMG! This place is amazing. I felt like I've died and gone to heaven! Having never been on a personal ramen quest, and after many years of hesitation I recently ate at Orochon and did not care much for their ramen noodles. Unfortunately, the hype of Orochon is unwarranted, conceivably a novelty. Enter Daikokuya. A quick 10 minute drive into J Town with my friend Mark and Tony G. landed us in the presence of the hallowed grounds of Daikokuya. The house was packed out with three parties waiting ahead of us. Mind you, we arrived at 9:40pm on a Wednesday. After a 15 minute wait, our party was seated. I was just happy that there wasn't a long line trailing out the door! We were here for one thing: Daikoku Ramen with Kotteri Broth and a side of Fried Rice. Tony had eaten dinner already, but opted for something a little lighter...Fried Rice! LOL Our Daikoku Ramen was ordered sans bamboo shoots and bean sprouts. We were presented with our beverages and cabbage salad near instantaneously. The salad was a pleasant opener to our carb ladened late night treat. They run a very tight ship over here and the meals are well spaced. Just as we were about to finish with the salad, the ramen arrived, followed by the fried rice! Drown that ramen with heaping spoonfuls of crushed garlic!!! HEAVEN!!!!!!! All I can say is...in the words of the great philosopher Emeril Lagasse, "PORK FAT RULES!" There's not much to account for this legendary dining establishment, as it seems most reviews have commentated with similar description. I simply wanted to add my personal dining experience to the mix. After devouring the heavenly goodness of ramen and fried rice, I finally came up for air and looked up towards the entry way. Would you believe it? Nearly 11:00pm and a crowd waiting inside and out the door! I will interject one final thought...and I realize that these may be fightin' words! The Fried Rice served at Daikokuya has put to shame the fried rice served at many Chinese restaurants! They serve some legit fried rice over here! (BTW, I'm of Chinese decent) If you've never been to Daikokuya, you're missing out big time! Totemo oishii desu!

The search is over. Ladies and gentlemen, look no further. Daikokuya is IT. You know a place isn't f**king around when they only offer ONE THING. I mean come on, you get a menu with a fat picture of THE Daikoku "Raumen." Notice the subtle "u" slipped in there? That's because you don't talk about Daikoku RaUUUUHHHmen without moaning inappropriately mid-sentence. Seriously. Now, I've had some tonkotsu experience in the past... and I wouldn't exactly say I was a fan. Pork bone broth... ehh, just a little bit pungent for my tastes, usually. That changed real fast tonight, though. I drank my entire bowl. And then I floated out of there. Did my stomach pay the price for my zeal? Yep. Did I mind? Nope. [p.s. for 9:30 on a Monday night, this place was peculiarly busy... just something to keep in mind] *UPDATE* [went back 30 minutes before closing on Saturday night... and we STILL had to wait! Take THAT, Pink's!]

It was a rainy day in LA yesterday and of course I started craving ramen. But who else shares this craving? Ah yes, Elise M! We waited over an hour for a couple of seats at the counter. Was it worth it? Yes and no. Yes, I got to spend time with my girly girl but no, the noodles weren't quite how I remembered. They weren't as springy. And the soup seemed lighter somehow. My egg wasn't fully cooked (not a bad thing) but it was cold. Overall, it was a good bowl of noodles but not mind-blowing. Possibly it was so busy last night because the E3 convention is in town or I just somehow had a magical first experience and this is the usual amount of time people wait for Daikokuya. Things always taste better when you don't have to wait over an hour for it. No, what I loved was the unagi. I got a small bowl of eel and rice and the eel was fantastic. Three huge thick pieces of eel with just the right amount of sauce. And the bits of seaweed on the rice was just the right added oomph to the rice. Prices seem about the same though the combo with the salmon roe is now $14.50. I guess it pays for the high-tech gadgetry they use now to take orders. It looked like a PDA you poke at with a stick. I did really enjoy sitting at the counter because it was cool to watch the guys cook. I had to hold my salad bowl and bowl of eel rice up with that low counter though. Service was really nice but I think we (or mainly it was Elise) sufficiently complimented the cute smiling waitress enough. She refilled our iced teas and checked on us quite often. I also drove around and around for street parking but always missed the spots. I ended up parking at the $4 flat rate structure on Second Street which I do think is the cheapest in Little Tokyo.

As usual...there was still a wait. Ugh. But the food was much better than the last time I went. The broth was more flavorful and served piping hot. I love that. The Kurobuta sausage was really good too. The food is good but the restaurant itself needs a major cleaning and some damn A/C. I can't give this place five stars...cuz ya know what? It ain't no Santouka. :)

NorCal vs. SoCal. That was my question.  Simple enough.  And probably considered before in almost every variation (style, sports, women, culture).   But given the often one-sided comparison in these categories for me, I thought a novel comparison would be food.  In particular, ramen. In one corner, Santa Ramen (San Mateo, CA) - almost universally recognized as the best ramen in NorCal and represented by their hard-to-get stewed pork in pork broth ramen ($8). In the other corner, Daikokuya (Los Angeles, CA) - sporting a similar number of fanatical Yelp reviews and similar lines out the door.  Their contender was the Daikokuya pork broth ramen and rice bowl combo ($10).   Having been to Santa Ramen a number of times, I was truly looking forward to Daikokuya on my trip to LA.  The 1 hour+ line (at 9 pm) didn't even phase me.  When it was all over, I'm happy to say I had a ramen winner (see below) : ------ Daikokuya does so many things well.  And their management of the long lines/crowds/and small space leaves me wishing other ramen places would do the same.  Among the highlights: 1) Friendly service and genuine interest - although it's crowded, the wait staff here patiently await your orders and really hope you enjoy your meal and are full when you leave. 2) Fair line policy - while names are taken down on a list (which some people try to cheat by crossing names off or writing their name between numbers), the staff does its utmost to be fair.  They try to remember who's been waiting, go outside and ensure no one has missed being called, and occasionally take roll-call to ensure you have a heads up as your number is closer to being called. 3) Excellent food stock management- despite the long lines and crowds, Daikokuya never gave any indication that anything would run out.  I, and many others, hate this nightly occurrence at Santa Ramen.  Having your most popular item run out night after night, usually within the first 15 minutes of opening, is inexcusable. Now on to the food - 1) Ramen - excellent texture to the noodles and a very warm and hearty broth.  The included items were a hard boiled egg, two slices of tender "kurubota" pork, some bamboo shoots and green onions.  It was neither as salty nor as oily as Santa's broth also made with pork bone.  Overall, it tasted good, felt healthier, though slightly less tasty and a bit milkier than the NorCal version. I recall the NorCal version notably having more toppings. 2) Rice bowls - absolutely awesome.  Slipping under the radar as a side dish, the rice bowls truly deserve a spotlight of their own.  Each we tried (unagi, pork cutlet, chicken egg) was delicious and felt so right paired with the ramen noodle soup.  Chicken egg featured tender pieces of chicken and congealed egg that was made to perfection. So who's the winner?   Based upon ramen alone, I do have to say that Santa Ramen (San Mateo, CA) has a more decadent and flavorful ramen broth.  The stewed pork is the other key that is just hard to beat.  The inclusion of more items in the bowl (sliced AND stewed pork, bean sprouts, seaweed) also leads to a more filling and satisfying ramen experience.   I'd have to say now it's probably the best ramen I've ever had (though probably not the healthiest) But for overall experience and the vast selection of side dishes (including the excellent rice bowls), Daikokuya is my choice.  If I have to wait for an hour somewhere, Daikokuya is by far the more pleasant choice.   So there you have it.  A winner in my ramen war.  Up next for me?  Perhaps US vs. Japan?

We waited over an hour. We circled the block for parking. We gave in and paid 8 bucks in a lot across the street.  We were hungry.  And we DETERMINED to get ramen. I know, that's a long ass wait for a bowl of noodles.  I don't think I'd wait that long again, but I'm happy to report it was delicious and totally hit the spot on a cold rainy night.  Here's the recap: Sliced roast pork ($5) The sliced pork belly was bomb-dot-com.   It was juicy, fatty and had a slightly sweet sauce that was surprisingly right on. Gyoza ($6) Flavorful mixture of pork and veg, but kinda pricey for what it is. Daikoku Ramen ($8.50).  It's a big piping hot bowl of delicious broth, with perfectly cooked egg noodles, slices of pork, hard boiled egg, bean sprouts and a bit of sesame seeds.  Once we doctored ours up to the necessary spiciness, we were happily slurping away. My 2 Cents: + Leave your entourage at home.  Seating is very limited so don't bring more than 4 people. + Be prepared to wait. Forever.  Write your name down on the clipboard and remember the number next to it. Bring a Clif bar. + Don't expect anything fancy.  It's a little run-down, but charming. + Parking sucks. Service does not. Oh, and please don't camp out once you've had your meal.  Remember the pain and suffering you endured to get that seat and the fact that everyone else waiting is giving you the death stare.

Oh, Daikokuuuuuuu. I once did not like Japanese ramen, but Daikokuya changed my mind. This is a place my friends and I go weekly, sometimes biweekly. It's so satisfying on a rainy or cold day. The broth is what keeps you coming back. Made from boiling soysauce and pork bones for a full day. They also have the special option of adding more pork fat in it. It's super fatty, but can satisfy like none other when you're just having one of those days. One thing that most people don't know is that you can get 1/2 orders of ramen. It's perfect for people like me who cannot finish a whole bowl (b/c I order other things as well :D). I've tried pretty much everything on their menu. Their rice bowls are 'eh' - you can get these at any other restaurant in Jtown (even at the J grocery stores). Their sashimi is not very good - sometimes tough, stringy. Their salad is addicting, it's the sauce! My favorite thing to order besides the ramen is their gyoza. You can tell its fresh (not the prepackaged kind)! The only downfall is the long wait. They used to not have a wait, but somehow, all of a sudden, everyone and their moms know about this place. Find street parking or park at JVP, have them put your name down, and walk around Jtown.

I know my review won't add any new insight to this joint and with over 400 reviews, what more can anyone say about Daikokuya aside from the fact that they tried it? However, I feel it is my DUTY to let you guys know that today I became the happiest person on Earth.  Why?  Was it because of their delicious ramen and milky broth?  No.  Was it because of their juicy, tender pork?  No. Was it because of the attractive waiter with the cute butt?...No (TELL US ALREADY MAY P!!!) It was because of....THE GARLIC PASTE!  I L-O-V-E that stuff sooo much and I can't believe that Daikokuya has the paste just sitting on the counter for me to greedily scoop onto my food or straight into my mouth (Don't worry, I didn't use the spoon that they had in the container)!!  I was first introduced to this garlic paste at Sushi Mac where they put a tiny dab on top of each piece of raw albacore.  I always had to ask for EXTRA because I'm totally addicted to it.  But now that I know Daikokuya has it, I don't ever have to go back to Sushi Mac and beg anymore!  -tears of joy-

I have this problem, you see. When I see a place with more than 1000 reviews, something bigger than my appetite overcomes me. I am the hawk and this was my prey. So, who cares if i have to sit in traffic for an hour and a half to get here? Who cares if i have to pay for Little Tokyo parking after wasting all that gas? Oh, a one hour wait at 9PM on Thanksgiving eve? Sure. This place was the reason people started using the phrase, "it's definitely worth the wait." They only offer one soy-sauce based broth which is made by soaking pork bones to add a deeper, richer flavor. The noodles held such a great texture and freshness and atop was a heap of green onions adjacent to a slice or pork and marinated egg. The whole entree held items that were ALL very unique and so so savory!  The Shredded Pork Bowl is what really set this meal aside. Anyone who decides to put your stomach through short term misery by starving like an idiot [Chhyah, stupid. *looks other way*], can divert that pain by simply ordering this dish. The pork was like BUTTER! BUTTER, I TELL YOU! These two dishes were such the perfect combo to please a hungry stomach. It really upsets me that i'll have to wait in line for it again since they do not allow take-outs due to their never-ending waitlist demands, but  i suppose nothing good ever comes easy. SOB.

This place is awesome.  Although I love Shin Sen Gumi, I have to admit that I may have a new favorite for ramen.  Why?  I have two reasons. 1) The broth is amazingly flavorful.  For those of you who think that ramen is supposed to be like instant noodles, you're wrong.  The hallmark of good ramen is in the broth.  The broth here is ridiculous.  It's like their water was super-saturated with the essence of a thousand pigs.  I upgraded my order with an extra shot of flavor by asking it to be prepared with "kotteri flavor".  I recommend it. 2)  The meat in the soup is delicious.  They use actual pork belly.  Pork belly is the cut of meat that they use for bacon.  It's tasty and its fatty and its simply delicious.   Although I loved the ramen here, I concede that you would probably like the ramen more at shin sen gumi if: 1) You prefer your ramen extra spicy.  Many people love spicy miso in their ramen.  If you're one of those people, then you may be better off there. 2)  You don't like your soups oily or you prefer your noodles soft. Shinsengumi allows you to customize your preference for noodles and oil concentration levels.   Either way...both Daikokuya and Shin-sen-gumi are both awesome places for Ramen.  I personally give the edge to Daikokuya because I feel that their broth is amazingly flavorful.   NOTE:  I've been told by several people that if you want awesome ramen, don't go to just any Daikokuya location....this is the one to go to.

Ok so if you know me, you know that I'm not a ramen fan whatsoever but on my last trip to LA, my friend was talking non stop about this place saying it's her absolute favorite place to eat ramen and she had a major craving for it so how could I say no? Despite the crazy wait (FYI if it's your first time there be sure to put your name on the list inside), we were eventually seated after about 45 minutes. In the meantime, we walked around the lil plaza across the street and had a chance to check out a bunch of cute stores. Inside however, we lucked out and got a booth to ourselves. She ordered the pork appetizer (OMG melt in your mouth and absolutely delicious) and gyoza. After the apps, I was already getting full but then a gigantic bowl of ramen was placed in front of me that smelled absolutely amazing how could I say no...The ramen itself was great. Definitely the best I've had. Great broth (I had the kotteri style), great ingredients and perfectly cooked noodles. Since we were going out after to a wine bar, there was no way we could take the leftovers with us, and there were a lot, total bummer. Oh well, next time. Daikokuya, you have a new fan :)

Bf and I came down to SoCal to go on a food eating extravaganza and this was on our to try list. Based on some of the other reviews on here, we saw Daikokuya was comparable to Santouka which is my all time favorite ramen spots therefore we wanted to judge for ourselves. We came on a Wednesday night and the wait was between 1- 1 1/2 hours, not sure cause i lost count. We weren't sure where to park  and how long it was going to take so we parked down the block which was $6. There's about 6 booths and the barstool area that fits about 10 people. This place is TINY and considering the amount of people flocking here to eat it explains the ridiculous wait. Doesn't accommodate large groups of 5 or more very well cause the booths only fit 4 comfortably. Not a very huge ramen menu, seemed like you could only get one type which was the Daikokuya ramen from what i saw. It was good nonetheless. Broth tastes very similar to Santouka except it was a little less thick and heavily seasoned. Most ramen places I've tried doesnt come with bean sprouts therefore when i ordered and saw bean sprouts mixed inside i was a little sad cause i had to spend 5 minutes picking them out. So those who hate beansprouts, remember to ask for no beansprouts! Overall it was very good and fullfilling nonetheless but Santouka still stands as my favorite.

Good Lord... I would eat here everyday if I could...it is THAT freakin good... The Daikokuya broth is super thick and rich, and with a little chili oil and garlic...its perfect. The prices are actually very reasonable and for like $12-13 you can get a set with a bowl of ramen, a small salad, and your choice of a rice bowl. It managed to fill me up...and I'm a fat cow. The place is pretty small...and everyone's friends uncles brothers are in the know about this place. Expect to wait up to an hour and a half for a seat on a busy night.

Best Ramen I've ever had.  But I haven't been to many Ramen places.  So I can't say I know Ramen.  But I do know my pork.  And the pork in the Ramen was absolutely delicious as was the pork cutlet I got on the side.  We had to wait for a while to get a table but it was worth it.   My only fault was that I ate earlier in the day and was not able to fit enough of this delicious noodle and pig into my belly.   Food: plentiful and excellent. Service:  equally great, never had to ask for a refill.  Food came quickly. Atmosphere:  very quaint, the aroma made my mouth water.

For the background as to why I finally came to this place here's how a conversation went between me and Jonas (part-time bboy/foodie) as to making a trip up to the Little Tokyo area... Me: Let's go to LA (Little Tokyo to be precise). Jonas: Sure, let's collaborate with Dingo to come through. Me: Alright. *2 months later* Me: Let's go to Little Tokyo Jonas: Check with Dingo if he has the time, and I can finally show you that Ramen place or R23. Me: Alright. *4 weeks later* Me: Yo Jonas, when are we going to Little Tokyo? Jonas: Alright, since Dingo doesn't have the time might as well go. And now we can finally try that ramen place or R23. Me: Sugoi...Ramen for the win. But R23 doesn't sound too shabby either. *3 weeks ago* And now we are in the present... As you already know I've visited several notable spots within the area, Mitsuru Cafe and Beard Papa's respectively. Not just for those places, or perhaps the small trinket Japanese knick knack stores, with your occasional hypebeast sneakers, it was about time to finally check out why Jonas has been ranting about this Ramen for ages. I constantly asked him about the spot until we finally arrived at the shop after an early brunch stroll. Originally we were supposed to go to R23 but considering our lack of planning and it was a Sunday, R23 was closed and out of the question. Right when we approached the entrance there was already a crowd of people waiting in line. Thankfully we weren't too far behind (5th ones at that), and we were seated within 15 minutes. So as I'm going through the menu, Jonas mentions to me the highlights of what this place has to offer. Ironically, it is the same ones enlisted under the same umbrella company: 1) Soup 2) Pork 3) Egg Which meant our orders are the following: -1 order of hot house Sake -1 combination order of Daikoku Ramen w/"extra flavor (kotteri)" and Salmon Roe Bowl side dish -1 combination order of Daikoku Ramen w/"extra flavor(kotteri)" and Tuna Sashimi Bowl Now the extra flavor as Jonas kindly explained is the soup, has all the extra fat from the black pork, that's soaked in. If you refuse to inject yourself with a deep food coma, then don't order any kotteri. Otherwise I'm all for the richness, of flavor the Ramen provides. Adding the special egg, that is prepared distinctively (without the yolk being too soft or hard), and you got yourself a winner. The noodles itself, were pretty good for the most part (texture was at a medium preparation, not too soft or hard). However my bias still goes to Shin Sen Gumi in Fountain Valley (customization for the win). The house salad, made me feel as though I were eating a Cabbage Patch Kids' nappy hair, but it was bearable with the Sake. And as for the salmon roe on Jonas's end it was fine, for him. The tuna sashimi, that I haven't ate for ages reminded me of why I appreciated it, even after neglecting it for so long (due to the current infatuation I have with Salmon Sashimi). It was nicely decorated like a flower, barely blooming in the spring. Too bad, I wrecked it by forcing the pieces to fall apart, ripping whatever remnants of the cherry blossom image it had once displayed. Overall, we spent $35.00 with tax and tip for our meals combine. The service was stellar, and the waitresses were hospitable right to the end until we left the premises. I wouldn't mind coming back here, just make sure you make it a brunch gathering, otherwise having more food for lunch is just out of the question.

Can you say overrated? "But you gave them 4 stars" Well heres why. From all the buzz I've heard about this place, i just dont think that the wait and atmosphere is worth it. 1. We waited 45 minutes for the 3 of us to get seated and it wasnt even lunch time, it was like 330pm on a wednesday afternoon. Theres not much place to wait, and it was hot. 2. Nothing special about the service. 3. The Ramen was good, but ive had better ramen (ex. Hakata Ramen, Gardena, CA.... plus the service here is great!) 4. Yes the pork rice bowl was awesome... its why they get 4 stars. 5. Since there was alot of people waiting, after we finished our food, i felt rushed. And i dont like feeling rushed, i wanna hang out and let my stomach digest for a bit till i start walking around. And lastly... they get the 4 stars is because I am a fan, but no way im waiting another 45 minutes for their ramen and rice bowls. Ohh ya, and if you have groups bigger than 5.... i would NOT suggest coming here.

Latter part of last year, I organized my quarterly "Quartet" dining series for my group and this time around, we focused on checking out 4 Ramen restaurants from October to December. The four places we visited were Koraku, Hakata Ramen, Santouka Ramen and Daikokuya. (see earlier reviews for Koraku, Hakata and Santouka) The "Quartet" ends at Daikokuya back in Little Tokyo. Daikokuya's claim to fame is that they only have one kind of broth for their ramen and that's the Tonkotsu broth. With having visited Hakata Ramen earlier in this dining series, I couldn't help but compare their version of Tonkotsu broth to that of Daikokuya. Both broths were rich in porky flavor, hearty and definitely mind-boggingly delicious, but there was a subtle difference between the two. To my palate, the Hakata ramen was more refined. It's the part of James Bond that is sophisticated, cool under pressure, elegant. You can taste the porkiness of the broth but it wasn't completely in your face. Daikokuya, on the other hand, was that part of James Bond that was rough and tumble, aggressive and took no prisoners. The broth of Daikokuya's ramen was more intense, more meaty and definitely made its presence known, and just like Hakata Ramen, I did more than eat this soup, I lovingly savored it. Do I prefer one over the other? No. I really enjoy both. As mentioned earlier, I'm just a carnivore kind of girl. When choosing one over the other, it would depend on whether I wanted to dine with James in a tux or with him while he was interrogating someone. Since I ordered a combo, I also had a salad and pork over rice with my ramen. I really likde the dressing that comes with the salad. It's a creamy citrus dressing that is a good balance between a little sweet and a little tart. The pork over rice was a miss. It was mostly just fat when I would have liked more meat. Overall, this was a wonderful "Quartet." It was really fun exploring the world of ramen and its many differences, whether it's difference in broth or in how different restaurants cook and/or present them to their customers. Growing up on packaged ramen, it was only last year that I experienced real ramen when I first visited Daikokuya, so I'm definitely stoked that I was able to check out other wonderful options. My definite favorites were Daikokuya and Hakata with Santouka close behind and while I may not necessarily go out of my way to visit Koraku for ramen, at least, I know if I did, I won't be too disappointed.

Knowing how much I LOVE ramen (I can eat it for dinner about 2-3 times/wk), my date brought me to Daikokuya before catching a game at the Staple Center. Arriving in Jtown around 4pm, we thought that we missed the dinner rush, but boy, were we wrong! We waited for at least 40 minutes in the cold breeze before we finally got seated in a booth. The restaurant may seem a bit small and uncleanly, but that's always a sign that your food will be tasty! Since we were ordering beer & sake, I opted for the fried rice to avoid being filled with liquids (even though the ramen looked pretty tempting!) Luckily, the fella went with his usual order and got the signature daikoku ramen. I sampled some of the ramen and it's delicious!  I don't know what is in both dishes, but something about the pork really makes the fried rice dish and the ramen savory and aromatic.  I just wanted to keep eating! I recently found out that there is a Daikokuya a minute away from my parents' house in Hacienda Heights.  Thank goodness, I won't have to deal with parallel parking!

I grew up on instant ramen, like Sapporo, Top Ramen, etc. You'd think b/c of that I would be able to appreciate REAL ramen. But no, I don't! I still prefer the instant kind! I know, I know what you're thinking. WTH is wrong with me. Can you believe it? This is the first Japanese ramen place I have been to.  I'm no ramen pro obviously but I had to start somewhere. Well, let's just say I wasn't too impressed. I had the miso based ramen and the soup base really bothered me b/c I couldn't put my finger on the flavors. The noodles were kind of, plasticky? I'm not sure how to describe it but I'm the kind of gal who likes her noodles a bit overcooked. I wondered if I would've liked the ramen here more if I had went for the original clear broth or soy based broth vs. the miso base. Next time I try ramen I'll have to keep that in mind.  So I'll have to agree with Vince S.; it wasn't an orgy in my mouth.  I WILL give ramen a few more shots though. We've been eating in Little Tokyo pretty often, so there's bound to be someplace I like. BUT, on the brighter side, the pork curry cutlet was yummy. Presentation was really just the bare minimum and we wished there was a side dish of coleslaw or macaroni or something, but the cutlet itself was flavorful. What really bothered me was the heat inside this restaurant.  On one of the hottest days of the heat wave, it was hotter inside than outside! The wait was long too and parking's a pain in the butt.  And do I feel like eating ramen in a sweltering hot restaurant? That would be a big fat NO! But I did anyways. At around 10pm people started pouring in.  We decided to sit at the counter b/c it was hot, crowded, and we didn't feel like waiting for a table.  After a while it started getting cooler though, after we stopped moving and talking. Haha. +++ for being open late! They even opened on Labor Day until 12am!

This is my second favorite ramen spot. It used to be #1, until I tried Santouka. I don't mind waiting in line to eat here because I know once I do get my huge bowl of ramen, it will be hot and delicious. Portions are huge and I am always completely satisfied. The pork is good and I'm a fan of the soft-boiled egg. I like the gyoza appetizer and I think their fried rice is sooo yummy. They are consistently good and the service is fast. I've been to a different location but I truly believe that the Little Tokyo spot is the best. Tips: Come early to avoid the dining rush. Be prepared to wait if you do come during a peak time. After you sign in, walk around the Village while you wait!

Seeing as I go here like twice a week, I should probably write a review of it. This is one of my favorite places to eat in LA, and it never gets old (at least it hasn't yet). The Daikoku Ramen is the best ramen I've ever had. The pork bone broth is so good... I just want to drink it out of the bowl (and sometimes I do!).  The egg is my other favorite part. We've tried to replicate their process of soaking an egg in some special sauce overnight... but since we don't know what it is that makes their sauce so special, we've yet to make delicious eggs like they do. If you're super-hungry, go for a combination. You get a little salad with it, Daikoku Ramen and whatever else you want. Tempura, chicken egg bowls, pork bowls, fried rice and many other delicious foods are among the options. If you go here, expect to wait because this is definitely the most popular restaurant in Little Tokyo. We waited from midnight to 1 am once to get a seat on a weekend, and if you come for dinner the wait might be 45 minutes to an hour. A word of advice: if you show up early for dinner, say between 5 and 6, you probably won't have to wait. But don't stay too long because there will be a line of hungry people on the sidewalk waiting to sit at your table.

Went here for dinner w/ my friend the other night..the wait wasn't so bad (20-40 mins.), but man i think it was definitely worth the wait! The daikoku ramen was soo good, perfect combination w/ chashu, bamboo shoots, egg..all the flavors combined made a perfect base for the ramen..we also ordered gyoza which was nice and slightly crispy on the outside topped w/ green onion and served up w/a side of dipping sauce. My friend had the daikoku ramen combination w/ the tuna sashimi bowl. All together it cost about $30...pretty decent price. I guess the only complaint people could really say is the long wait..but it's a small lil place in little tokyo so seating is a bit limited..so i wouldn't suggest rollin deep w/ a party of 10...cuz you'll probably end up waiting for hours!

Food - 5/5 Service - 5/5 Price - 5/5 Atmosphere - 4/5 Best Dish: Ramen Combo meal (with shredded pork) Simply the best ramen noodles you will ever have. Authentic, tasty, and filling are great adjectives for Daikokuya. If you go during the prime time hours, expect to see 15+ parties ahead of you.

I'll write more of a review today: Greasy, salty, fatty, liquid joy in a bowl. Nothing says comfort food like ramen. Many a day was spent eating ramen. Some prefer hakata ramen like at Shinsengumi. Not me. The slender noodles don't seem to carry the flavor of normal ramen as much. And despite typically being the same weight of noodles in the bowl, hakata ramen doesn't seem to last as long for me. Came here with some other yelpers after drinking and I was so glad to have gone to daikokuya, it's by far the best ramen place I've found. They don't skimp on the toppings, it tastes authentic, and I can get away with ordering in my crappy Japanese. Well, ok, I can do that in most ramen houses. The point being, it feels like Japan. If you know my reviews, you know how important authenticity is to me. To truly enjoy the flavor of a ramen, and for an authentic experience, drink heavily. That tunnel vision will help you focus on getting that salty goodness and prevent you from getting distracted.

After eighty minutes of waiting in the street, I wanted nothing less than ramen nirvana to pay me for my troubles.  What I got was good ramen.  I'd come back if I could be guaranteed a table in twenty minutes, but almost an hour and a half was a bit ridiculous. The space was cute in that it was loaded with noodle shop atmosphere, from the yellow and black signage to the broken-in booths and counter seating.  The air was thick with the busy efficient attitude unique to popular ramen joints, and the accompanying service was courteous but notably fast.  Daikokuya must be raking it in with endless patrons and speedy turnover. My roommate, Justin C., and I made a party of three, and we went more or less family style with a couple appetizers and ramen.  We tried the deep fried spicy tuna and the gyoza, and both were decent but I wouldn't order them again.  Deep fried spicy tuna was an interesting concept, but the tuna was hard to taste.  I did enjoy the bold flavor of shiso, but I would have paid less for deep fried shiso.  The gyoza had nice skin, but it was a pretty standard pork and veggie gyoza despite an uncommon rectangular shape.  One of us ordered a ramen combination that came with a bowl of salad and fried rice.  The salad was a slaw with thousand islands dressing that was actively unappetizing.  The fried rice was solid, though, very buttery with a pleasant dose of corn.  I've definitely had better fried rice at ramen houses, but I've had worse, too. As for the ramen, we ordered the Daikoku ramen both regular and kotteri, as well as a kichimen.  In my opinion, Daikokuya gets the most points for its firm, chewy noodles.  They have the perfect amount of heft and spring, and I would be pretty pleased to have them with a bowl of Shin ramen broth.  As for the rest of the components, I was slightly less impressed.  The broth of the Daikoku ramen was really heavy, even without the kotteri specification.  The kotteri made the broth straight up greasy, thick with fat globules that were good for a few bites but hard to slurp up.  That said, the broth was tasty, as fatty things usually are.  The pork was also melty and tender.  The kichimen, which was a version of tsukumen, was not as good, though the broth did have a nice vinegar kick. Overall, I enjoyed my ramen at Daikokuya and if it weren't such a hassle, would gladly go back.  I'm happy to have checked this place off of my ramen list, but I can't say it was worth the wait.  I'll have to forget how annoying that was before I attempt to go back again.

With over 500+ reviews under their belt, I don't think mine will add anything new. So I will just share a little adventure.I had when I visited Daikokuya. I've been meaning to visit Daikokuya for so many years, even moreso after reading the reviews on yelp. But I've always been put off by the long waits and the long lines. I have made previous attempts during the summer, so I have experienced the heat inside when waiting. I've never been too patient when waiting for food, even if its a good restaurant. Even since changing jobs to a downtown location, I've made fruitless attempts at eating lunch here. I don't bother to wait because there are plenty of decent places to eat just nearby. One evening after work I had an unusual evening of drinking. I don't do the happy hour thing, but this evening I joined a friend to have drinks while he had to kill time before an evening meeting. Strangely when he left I bumped into other co-workers and joined them for drinks. LOLOL. Strangely a couple of buddies I had been meaning to get together with, after reconnecting with them after 10 years, called me up and wanted to have drinks. LOLOLOL. I joined them at a nearby pub with a slight inebriation already in swing. I started to head home when hunger started to overtake me. Who doesn't get famished after some good drinking? Ramen kept  popping in my head, especially Daikokuya, but I kept dismissing it like an evil little red devil on my shoulder. Ok if the next light is red I will make a right turn and consider it. Alright alright... if its a green I will go to 1st Street. (At this point I was fully content on finding a taco truck. Mind you I don't like to shift food types if I am stuck on it.) Ok ok,,, I will pass by and if its not too crowded I will stop by. (Dammit.. .it didn't look too crowded) FINE. If I find good parking then I will stop. I turned the corner and found rockstar parking right on the streets. I headed over and noticed the the black curtains must've hid some stragglers. Or they might've dribbled out after signing in on the wait list. ARRGH. Maybe its not too late to just turn around. Ah screw it... I've been receiving signs that I have to go eat this damn ramen. I'm stuck. I didn't look to happy when I signed the wait list and there were at least 8 names ahead of me. GREAT. I barely sat down when I heard the little waitress call my name. I forgot I was rocking solo so I could sit at the bar. (I did smug a little at the others who were glaring at me). The staff was helpful and friendly. Even the cooks behind the counter were sociable and nice. I didn't bother with the menu and just asked for "it". The guy sitting next to me came solo and he ordered the same thing. We even split an order of gyoza. The ramen came out and I must say: its very good. Its not the food of gods, but I can see why people rave about it. The broth is rich and flavorful. There is a depth to it that is very nice to sip on. The chashu could've been a little more tender, but it was still very good. The noodles *are* al dente as others have described, but I enjoyed them as such. What I really loved was the egg they gave me. The egg wasn't cook through entirely. It was soft boiled enough to have a little sunshine peek through when I bit through it. Delicious. The ramen here is very good. I would come again. Maybe its the interesting evening that added to the experience. Apart from that, this restaurant holds up to its reputation - both good and bad.

Let's face it. Daikokuya doesn't need anymore publicity than it already has. So what if this review tells ya what the last 600+ people said? It's my duty as a die hard fan to bring you good tidings, so just shut up and read already. Who waits an hour and a half to be seated? ME, that's who. And it's worth every flippin second when I'm slurping that generous bowl of liquid euphoria. Hellooo chashu! I've weathered the cold, the rain and that lovely heatwave during summer just for a mouthful of perfection. For $8.50 you get it all: thick noodles, bamboo shoots, a WHOLE marinated egg, green onions, a couple slices of melt-in-your-mouth chashu and of course, their signature broth. Now that's a steal, considering other ramen houses charge extra for those same toppings. For an extra couple of bucks you can add a small version of rice bowls ranging from teriyaki chicken to unagi (fresh water eel), or my personal favorite- the oyako-don (scrambled egg and diced chicken with onions). For sides, I'd recommend their gyoza: their unique rectangular shape makes them larger and juicier than the traditional gyoza I've had elsewhere. The tempura here is pretty good too with just the right amount of batter and crisp without destroying or drying out the poor veggie inside. Don't spend on the tsukemono (pickled veggies) since you can buy larger portions for less at nearby stores like Marukai or Mitsuwa. Service has always been flawless during my frequent trips, and unless you're claustrophobic, there's no reason why you shouldn't experience Daikokuya at least once in your lifetime. If at this point you're not not even the slightest bit curious what goes on behind those old, blue curtains at the entrance, there must be something clinically wrong with you... And you've just wasted 5 minutes of your life reading this, to be insulted at the end. Haha for you, Sucker. P.S. Shhh. Don't tell the O.C. We've still got the best branch in L.A. Type:  restaurant; Japanese; ramen and rice bowls

Daikokuya - famous for their tonkotsu soup base, the rich and delicious flavor is achieved by boiling pork bones and joints overnight.  Topped with pork belly chashu, marinated boiled egg, some vegetables, and a shitload of green onions, I don't understand why anyone else can really complain.   -  Noodles not firm enough?  Have them make it firm.  It still may not be the star of the show, but the soup is there to more than make up for it. -  Get it Kotteri flavor as well to obtain an even richer flavor; the soup is enriched with back fat.   -  Ask for Oomori and get your food 1.5x larger. -  Don't forget the tableside garlic!  I missed it on my initial visit. I came here after eating my 'Pre-lunch,' (which was Italian food) and I still enjoyed it.  Once we started eating, all I heard was silence, and a bunch of slurping.  (I think Wilmar D. was talking to me but I literally was, in my own world.) Final Mood:  This is the best 'C' restaurant I've had.  Although I'm sure Ventura County has cooking environments that aren't even this clean!  (The grades aren't posted on the restaurants). Wait, you guys are still hungry?

They truly must boil those pork bones to extract that much flavor! They have a tasty bowl of Daikokuya ramen! Portion sizes are most excellent. And prices are truly a steal. I love coming here. It's totally worth the wait. There is a stainless steel partition to prevent 3rd degree burns onto patrons (on the bar seating area) and servers don't speak a lick of English. So, when your done getting your drink on at weilands bar waddle yourselves over to this joint. This place is a must!!!!!

ON SECOND THOUGHT: IT'S JUST OK The first time I went to Daikokuya, I was on a mission to have some ramen and was starving after a long drive from S.F. Under those circumstances, the meal I enjoyed there was really good but this time, I decided to try them again, having just ran through close to half a dozen other ramen-yas in the L.A. area and I wasn't starving. Revised opinion: It's ok but decidedly less impressive than the first time. (I've included my original review at bottom just so you can see how my opinion has evolved). For one thing, even though I didn't have to wait at all (the place only had 10 people in it), my broth was very warm but not exactly what you'd call "hot". I thought that was odd and frankly, "very warm" ramen isn't as fun to eat. Second, the broth is decidedly on the weaker side. It's not as plain jane as Asahi or Ramenya on the Westside but for a pork-based broth, I'd say it's less rich than Shinsengumi (which itself isn't that rich) and definitely far less salty, rich or enticing as what I just had at Santouka last week. Not to get all Tampopo about it but the broth is what it comes down to when you're talking about ramen addictions and in this case, it just tasted watered down a bit. The upside was that the pork is very good here. Fatty and flavorful and that helps impart more richness to the broth...or would have if the soup had been piping hot and therefore more likely to melt some of the pork fat. Also, I had forgotten that a bowl of ramen here costs $7.50 (basic, without add-ons). That's about $2.50 more than Asahi, $1 more than Santouoka, 50 cents more than Shinsengumi and $1 less than Chabuya. The size of their serving is probably somewhere between Asahi and Santouka. I didn't think it was overpriced (unlike Chabuya) but Daikokuya only cements my feeling that in terms of the best ramen, especially for the price, Santouka is the one to beat. Lastly, it must be said that Daikokuya is not that convenient to get into given its location in a high traffic, low parking (free parking that is) neighborhood. I happened to be downtown so I decided to cruise by but if I lived with 15 minutes of Daikokuya and 25 minutes of Santouka or Shinsengumi, I'd much rather spend the extra time and go to those other spots since I know that parking is far easier (plus, both places make better ramen). I have perhaps one or two more places to try downtown but I'm starting to become thoroughly convinced that if you want really good ramen in L.A., you have to head south. ***ORIGINAL REVIEW*** I went to Daikokuya after being shut out of three different ramen-yas in the Bay Area (because the wait was too long or they had closed out lunch already) and then driving six hours down to Los Angeles. By the time I got to Little Tokyo, I was famished at had ramen on the brain something bad. Under those circumstances, I might have been inclined to turn even a middling meal into something miraculous but given that I've been trying over half a dozen ramen spots over the last month, I had some semblance of an objective opinion about Daikokuya: It's a very good, satisfying and reliable bowl of ramen, especially for the price. The combos you can pair it with (I got tuna sashimi over sushi rice = awesome) elevate it even more. There's nothing I can really nitpick about eating there except to say that while it was very good, especially in my frame of hunger, it wasn't transcendent. Or, to put it simpler, it wasn't better than Santa Ramen in San Mateo or even Halu Ramen in San Jose. PLUS: The pork-based broth had a good richness to it but it could have been both a little richer and saltier to give it just a bit more punch. The noodles were also good but not memorably great. As noted, the combos are solid though and most of them are priced under $10. That's solid bang for the buck. MINUS: I had to wait even though it was well after 9pm. I shudder to think what it would have been like had I gotten there at 6 or 7pm instead. I didn't mind waiting 5-10 minutes. 30 minutes though? Doubtful. On the whole, I thought the food itself was comparable to Shinsengumi in Gardena BUT parking is easier at Shinsengumi and my gut feeling is that the wait wouldn't be as bad there either. Shinsengumi (as my review indicates) also has a great kids meal, something I didn't see at Daikokuya (or any other ramen-ya for that matter) so b/t the two, I'd have to give the nod to Shinsengumi.

I love this place so much I think I'm going to marry it. I had the Daikoku Ramen for $8.50 and a order of their gyoza. The gyoza was deliciously fried to perfection and the Ramen...ohh...the ramen was SO SO good. The  perfect amount of savory goodness, not too salty, not too bland. The pork belly just melted in your mouth. I can eat and entire meal out of pork belly here. My friend got the shredded pork bowl and I nearly squealed in delight when I tasted this. That will be my next dish I order all to myself. No Sharing. I highly recommend and I will be going back during my lunch hour FOR SURE. The wait is a little long but I say it is well worth it.

My friend was raving about this place so we decided to check it out.  There's basically only 1 ramen; the Daikoku ramen.   Extremely flavorful broth with excellent made to order noodles.  This ramen is topped with chasu pork, boiled egg, bamboo shoots, and tons of green onions.  Pretty much the best ramen I've had yet. Everytime I'm in Jtown, I try to come back.  I don't always succeed since the lines are insane here!

Good thing I came in the late afternoon so it wasn't crowded. The food here is amazing. The broth was very tasty, but not salty. Adding garlic to my broth made it even more phenomenal.. The atmosphere takes you back to and older Japan, like you were actually in a ramen booth, sitting at the bar and being served your food. I also ordered the shredded pork which was just simply, AMAZING.. Will soon return to eat more!

Yes, the ramen is AWESOME. There really isn't much more to say after 2,000 reviews, but you'd have to wait 2 hrs and scour the streets for parking. I'd recommend going right when they open to get first choice of booth or bar seats. If you're thinking, "hmm maybe i'll go after the dinner rush", WRONG. The line never dies down, and they will close when they run out of soup.

Previously, I had written a review for this restaurant but apparently it was flagged because it was more of a point of view from a 3rd person view or from what someone else says. I had given it a 1 star only because it was the end of June, one of the hottest days of the Summer, friends sitting in here waiting for us to arrive, AC blasting and they are still sweating like they are in a sauna. So we ended up moving to Suehiro. So whatever talks, slams, criticisms, etc., let those be gone, under the bridge and whatever cliche you want to say here at this point. I made it a point to come here in the evening where it is cooler temperature and to finally write a review for this place after my first review was deleted recently. Coming in here by myself close to midnight, I see quite a few people waiting here for a while. Counter is completely clear. I write my name down as the pretty waitress comes down to check the list. I asked her about the counter and she says let me clear it up and wipe it down first. I said sure. One of the waiters comes down after she did 5 minutes later. He looks at me and says, 1? I nodded and he says, counter ok? Sure. He took me and 2 couples over to the counter and we all sat down. Menu in hand and I'm already checking out the combinations. I saw the soup noodles and moved my eyes down to the combos. Noodle soup and teriyaki chicken, and it comes with rice. I'd like to order please, iced green tea also because it's hot in here. Sitting at the counter allows me to see how my food is prepared. Boiling broth with noodles prepped for each order. Bowls laid out, broth poured in each one. Ding, minute goes by and the noodles are ready. In the bowls they go with green onions, bamboo shoots, slices of pork, an egg, sprouts, and we're ready to eat. Incoming.................... While I'm trying not to burn my tongue on these noodles, here comes the small bowl of teriyaki chicken on rice. Oh lord, what did I just do. Now I'm sweating and eating hot food. More tea please with more ice. A little bit of that red spice and this ramen is good going down. I love the big green onions and all the noodles. I was going back and forth with the noodles and the rice. I ended up eating the rice with teriyaki in the soup broth. Awesome time there. Last call by the pretty waitress and I said no thank you. Finished the last of my soup as much as I can but definitely no noodles left and no onions in my bowl. The pork meat was a bit dry and the boiled egg was even more dry. Soup helped more than you know. I asked for the check and was glad to get out of there. By the way, there is a picture in the hallway to the bathroom, I swear it's a picture of Nancy Y. on there. Soon as I hit the door, it was like 10 degrees cooler. I really would have been miserable if we actually stayed to eat here in June. The food is good but if I had a choice, I would go back to Shin-Sen-Gumi Hakata Ramen Restaurant in San Gabriel, which I still have to review. The noodles may not be krinkled like how ramen should be but definitely AC that works. Because of that, I was really reluctant to give it 4 stars but the noodles was really good.

The wait was about 50 minutes long (8:40pm to 9:30pm on a Thursday night) but I'm so glad we stuck around.  I have to thank my bf's brother's gf (wow, a mouthful) for taking us here.  5 stars is tough to give because no restaurant is perfect, but I have to give it to Daikokuya. Many ramen restaurants have similar tasting broth and if one is better than another, in a couple of days you can't remember exactly why.  However, Daikokuyu has the best broth I have ever tasted, by a long shot.  There is an extra element that I cannot describe, almost creamy.. egg-y.. and very delicious.  One sip and I knew right away that nothing I had had before comes close and that I will probably never enjoy SF/bay area ramen the way I used to. They only have two varieties of ramen: daikoku ramen and another one where the broth comes in a separate bowl.  I had the daikoku ramen (amazing tonkotsu broth).  You can also choose to get the richer broth which is even more amazing. The ramen comes with bamboo, a large soft boiled egg, lots of green onion, seaweed, bean sprouts, and some pork.  Each table is equipped with pickled ginger and chopped garlic.  Four spoonfuls of garlic + Daikokuya ramen = pure bliss in mouth.  Mmmmmm.  TOO GOOD.

Located in the heart of Little Tokyo in downtown LA, the atmosphere was your atypical quaint Japanese diner, but the way they prepare food here is grand. This location probably serves no more than 30 patrons at any one time. Sign in please! Because if there is no open table available, you must wait your turn. Stve W. said that I must try this place because it's got the best ramen noodle bowls around, but he was unaware I couldn't eat ramen anymore. However, once I spotted the shredded pork bowl photo on the third page of their menu, my search for a lunch entree was over. Due to my love of pork, I was set on that one dish alone and there was no way no one was going to separate me from that rice bowl. The serving portions for both the bowl and lemonade I ordered were obscenely huge and totally worth the money. The shredded pork bowl was absolutely delicious with its layers of hot rice, seaweed, grilled pork fat back, teriyaki sauce, sesame seed, and generously topped with thinly sliced carpet of green onion as well as garnished with a pile of julienned pickled pink ginger. I get hungry all over again each time I re-read the description. Damn, that was a good rice bowl!

I came here with a few friends on a friday evening expecting to wait a long time. But luckily, we only waited 15-20 minutes. Not sure why there wasn't much of a wait, but I definitely wasn't complaining. The inside of this small eatery looks very authentic Japanese. Had the Daikoku Ramen and a Shredded Pork Bowl for the table. The shredded pork bowl was really freaking good, but how can you not get the ramen too!?!? What a dilemma.... People compare the ramen here to Ippudo in NY alot. I'd say Ippudo definitely has more flavor, but Daikokuya's has a more of a home-cooked, traditional feel to it. Both are very good.

2.5 stars The best ramen shop in Los Angeles??? Call me a party pooper but I was not impressed with the ramen or the gyoza at this place.  I had to wait twenty five minutes for dinner tonight and usually whenever I see a line in front of a restaurant, it means the food is good there. Here, it meant that a lot of people in LA enjoy eating soup with little flavor. First of all, for tonkotsu ramen, the broth is supposed to be pretty rich in flavor and it's supposed to be more white in color. Even if it's assari (light fat), it's supposed to be flavorful. I ordered the futsuu (regular fat) version because my friend told me that the kotteri (heavy fat) version was too much for her the last time. Maybe I should have tried the kotteri version because I usually get that in Japan whenever I eat this specialty Kyushu style ramen (tonkotsu).  Some people tell me that kotteri is light years better than the regular version but I guess I'll never know because I'm not going to come back here. Besides, even the regular fat tonkotsu ramen should be good at a ramen restaurant. There was only one ramen choice on the menu - The Daikoku Ramen. You had to explicitly specify to the waiter if you wanted assari or kotteri version for the soup broth. You also had to specify if you wanted the noodles to be prepared firmer or softer. If you don't say anything and just order the ramen, they will assume you want the default version shown on the menu. The ramen comes with bean spouts, bamboo shoots, an egg, fatty chashu, and chopped up green onions. As I mentioned earlier, I wasn't a big fan of the soup and the noodles were off as well. As for the chashu, it was probably the best ingredient of the bunch but remember, everything is relative. It's like me saying the lime was the sweetest fruit amongst the other lemons... How about the gyoza you might ask ... Well, I asked the help if they made their own gyoza skins... I'm not sure if the waiter understood me and in hindsight I should have asked him in Japanese to make sure my question was answered correctly but he said they made the skins at the shop. When the gyoza came, the skin was thin and the meat inside was a little on the bland side. If this place truly made their own skins, they need to be retaught. I'm almost 100% positive they buy the gyoza skins. Does hand made skin make a difference when it comes to gyoza? Does sex with a condom feel the same as sex without one? Making your own skins (although a pain in the butt that requires more patience than I'm willing to give these days) adds more texture to the dumpling and it holds in the juices of the meat much better. If you truly like ramen, I would pass on this place. It's of average quality. I suppose if you happened to be passing by and you had a random ramen crave attack, go ahead and go here but for you true ramen lovers out there, don't say I didn't warn you. ( HAIPE )

Maybe I'm just picky but this ramen restaurant is overrated.  My friend bragged about this great ramen place.  We went with her and it was just average.   Something is missing from the broth.  It is definitely better than ajisen but nothing compared to Santouka or Shinsengumi.  It is always crowded so I went there for the second and third time.   I didn't change my mind.....still nothing special about this place. 2 stars!! Daikokuya is not yummylicious!!

HEAVEN ON EARTH! ... Especially in unexpected rainy, cold LA weather. My boyfriend and I were running some errands in downtown LA last Friday when it started pouring like crazy! Luckily, we were in close proximity to Japan town and I remember my friend mentioning some really really good ramen place called Daiko-something. Umm Ramen, on a cold day? Yes please. Thanks to my iPhone, we found it and were only 1.8 miles away. Future customers, please pack some quarters when you come pay Daikokuya a visit. The only parking available in front of the store is metered so grab all the loose chain you can find. (You'll need it especially if there is a long wait ... which there usually is). We arrived around 2:45pm and it was packed. Its pretty tiny and filled with random vintage Japanese pieces with barely any space to wait around. We waited almost 45 minutes until we were seated. I wasn't surprised that they received a B rating. The place is filthy and I felt uncomfortable seeing some servers wipe up a mess on the floor then bring me my water while holding the rim. BARF! We sat at the bar where we had a full view of the noodles, meat, and broth and everything seemed so so so dirty! I felt like my food was being man-handled by unwashed hands and reused utensils! Ugh! I've been complaining this whole time, so why the 4 stars?! ... BECAUSE THEIR TONKATSU RAMEN WITH THE "BACK FAT" FLAVOR IS ABSOLUTELY HEAVENLY! My god, as if all my complaints and discomfort went out the window! The rim on my water glass seemed to sparkle with disinfectant! It was hands down the best best best ramen I have ever tasted. Daikokuya, say hello to your new regular.

PROS: - Nice, big, 'n tasty (California) rolls - Seats at the counter give you the full "dining-in-Japan" experience - Situated in Little Tokyo, with interesting shops nearby - Authentic (as close as you can get, next to actually being in Japan) ramen bowls for $9 CONS: - Long wait time (we waited 40 minutes around 4:00 pm on a Sunday) - The dirty rag used as a door in the front needs to be thrown in the trash like, NOW - Menu doesn't have much variety, it's very simple with a few items under each category (ramen, rolls, bento boxes, etc.) Point is, I'm not a big fan of ramen in general, but it's tasty and will warm you right up on a cold day (especially if you sit at the counter next to two giant boiling pots of soup).  I've been to Japan, I've eaten their ramen, so you can trust me when I say it's pretty close to the real thing.  It's not drop-dead delicious, but it's a fun dining experience and a place everyone should try at least once.

"Keep walking, and look for the yellow awning" one patron was told. Diakokuya is one of my all time  Fav's...their Special House Ramen broth and black pork are unmatched in the area, and I am happy to wait the usual 20-40 minutes for it's delight. Arrive early, and poke your head in and place your name on the waiting list 'clipboard'. You can also sit down and enjoy watching TV game shows or simply listen to old Japanese show tunes while waiting (so cool!). We just love the atmosphere and vibe. I always get the shredded pork bowl appetizer (it's a house specialty), and the Diakokuya Ramen. You won't be disappointed, I promise...this place is well known in the 'noodle world' with Ramen lovers worldwide. I've talked to people who have been in town from Hawaii and other states who have heard of it and simply we're told to "look for the yellow awning". Myself and many others before me would suggest you do the same. Enjoy, and hope to see you there!

Tastes like ramen from a ramen house in Tokyo. No higher praise than that. Still, I'm only giving this place 4 stars because I generally crave udon more than ramen. So there you go. But my taste preferences aren't Daikokuya's fault. So before traveling to Japan, I didn't get the whole $10 ramen thing. Why pay so much for a fresh bowl when the Japanese have perfected the 10cent fried/dried ramen package so well? But then I went to Japan. And sat in front of ramen chefs cooking in restaurants that only serve ramen. Nothing but ramen. You can get extra pork slices, or an extra egg, or even a two ounce slab of butter, but that's about it for choices. And I ate it. And it was good. =^) So after being converted, Daikokuya is the best place ramen house I've been to in LA. Better than Shin Sen Gumi in Gardena. *gasp* Yeah I said it. Daikokuya's presentation and ingredients (pork, egg, etc.) are just so much more...I don't know... authentic. If authenticity were one of the four taste sectors on the tongue, it would declare Daikokuya the winner. EDIT 8.31.07: I'm a madwoman for ramen now. Five stars! Also, the fried rice is great. So get the combo, especially since they give you this cabbage salad that's SOOOO good! Well, the dressing is good. Anything covered in that dressing would taste good. And AND sake for only 5 bucks!! Woooo sake! After eating at Daikokuya many times now, the best part is their noodles. They're thick and curly like someone oh so lovingly pulled them into being. I'll gladly wait for a table any day!

Daikokuya. Word by word translation means "big (dai) black (koku) house (ya)". In Japan, the character 'ya' signifies that that business is a store.  As for 'daikoku', it implicates Berkshire pigs. They're called kurobuta in Japanese, which can also be translated to "black pig". In another word, Daikokuya implies indirectly that they serve berkshire pork (http://tinyurl.com/2dsgkk). Anyhow, the first time I've ever truly had a good bowl of ramen in LA was four years ago. While living nearby, I drove down first street and realized nights after nights of long line outside of Daikokuya. At that time, even at 1AM in the morning (they used to open til 3AM), there was still a wait. One night, I've decided to give them a try, their infamous ramen with Tonkotsu soup (pork bone soup). As any big ramen fan would know, soup is so important in ramen. Most authentic "ramen ya" would make or brew their own ramen soup with their secret techniques and array of ingredients. Here at Daikokuya, they definitely had shown off how spectacular their pork bone stock is. I could recall my very first bowl of "Daikoku ramen". The soup was piping hot. The noodle was thick with a tad firmer of the "al dente" consistency. The marinated egg was half cook witht he yolk semi runny. Then there was the star of the ramen, fatty berkshire pork belly chashu. With smooth texture, it disintegrated on my tongue. That very night, experiencing that combination, especially the fatty berkshire pork, the hot soup and the runny yolk gave me such wonderful experience, words can't describe how phenomenal it was. Should I say orgasmic experience or death-defying-adrenaline rush? It was a killer when I ordered it with the katsu-don (pork cutlet rice bowl). Watching the chefs behind the counter making the katsu don was also another experience I very much enjoyed, as well as the rice fried rice they make. That year (2004), I went numerous times after my very own discovery. However, the year following, the quality seemed to have gone down. The egg was no longer runny. The soup, depending on the night, is hit or miss (not piping hot soup). The berkshire chashu was not hot enough. It seems like its been like that since '05. However, I might give them the respect and props for the very first experience they gave me. Furthermore, I really enjoyed their sets with the half donburi (rice bowls). These sets were treasurous. Comparing to Hakata-Ramen, Santouka Ramen, Chabuya and so forth, Daikokuya is a bit on the heavier side. Regardless, they used to be very very very enjoyable. I would've given them 5 stars if they can give me that first time experience I had again. I didn't want to give them 3 stars for their degraded quality since '05 (I haven't gone for 2 years now). I highly recommend this place whether it's for their broth, or simply their star berkshire pork products.

This place looks kinda filthy.  It's cramped, the seats are old looking.  The area where they cook looks unsanitary.  The broth that they dunk those noodles in looks like polluted water. If they call your party and you're not all there, someone else will go ahead of you.  Also, after you get your food and drink, you don't get much attention afterwards. It also got a "C" health rating. But man I could swim and bathe in that broth.  Kotteri style. And that special chashu?  Like buttah.

4* for Daikokuya, and 5* for the company and experience. I finally got to try the OG Daikokuya after falling madly in love with the OC location in Costa Mesa, thanks to a cool cat by the name of Smitcha B. We conveniently found street parking pretty close, next to a couple hooligans and skipped on over to the restaurant.  There was a minimal wait, perhaps 20 min.  It was busy and packed with people. The inside was quaint and cute, with walls adorned with vintage Japanese posters.  I liked it.  It felt cozy. We got seated at a booth and decided to share a combo since we weren't that hungry, both having had massive lunches earlier that day.   He ordered, "Daikokuya ramen with the tuna sashimi bowl." I giggled, "Why do you have to say 'Daikokuya' when we're already here and they know we want their ramen." He explained, "Because it's famous.  Like McDonald's fries." I thought about it.  "But I don't say 'McDonald's' when I order their fries." I win. The food came out piping hot and while he meticulously chopsticked some noodles over to a smaller bowl (for moi) and tediously spooned over the soup, I nibbled on the tuna sashimi that came on a bed of hard, cold rice.  Mehhh.  I gave him the rest. The ramen here is just as tasty as the OC location with its rich broth and oodles of noodles.  It warmed my belly up.  Very soothing since 'twas a wee bit chilly that night.  The only thing we forgot to do was order the hardboiled egg, so I guess I'll never know what that's like here. The booth we sat in was kinda cramped.  He kept elbowing me while I ate, and I didn't say anything but I was in rage.  I like my space while I do my business.  Jk fools. Overall, friendly service with yummy food and unique decor.  I enjoyed myself. I had a long day and the soup was so satisfying that soon I found myself in a food coma and passed out, snoring like a cow.  Thanks Smitcha B.!

You know your friends who say, "Ramen is just ok.." It's because they haven't tried Daikokuya..no joke. I've had 3 friends who said that and I've asked them if they've tried Daikokuya and of course they've never heard of it. There is such thing as GOOD ramen. We're not talking about cup-o-noodles or the ones in korean packages. The line is long for a reason. The Monterey Park location is not worth the wait though...for some reason it doesn't taste as good as the one in LA. Order the original and don't forget to add garlic, ginger, and hot pepper. The egg is cooked just perfect with it being runny, and the broth is full of fatty meat flavor. After you're done, walk down to the plaza and get a $1 mochi ice cream.

Daikokuya is one of my all time ramen favorites in the US. Their kotteri ramen is so amazingly fatty and flavorful. One of the best ramen broths that you will ever be able to enjoy in the US. The noodles are cooked to perfection and everything that comes in the ramen is just delicious. Aside from the ramen, I've tried a variety of dishes and all were really good. Sometimes ramen joints only focus on their ramen, understandably. But Daikokuya took the time and effort to make sure their non-ramen options are just as tasty. ~ Sliced Roast Pork: this is melt in your mouth goodness ~ Gyoza - Made in house and you can tell. The ingredients are mixed perfectly for a yummy bite every time ~ Sausage - kurobuta sausage served with a side of spicy mustard. These little bad boys are juicy and have a nice, crispy skin ~ Chicken teriyaki - pretty standard but the teriyaki sauce is awesome There is always a line, so be prepared to wait. There's a cool little Japanese gift, anime, toy store next door to kill some time and get out of the heat. And don't forget about Fugetsu-Do down the street!!

Definitely a good ramen place. Service very very friendly. They give you an option of an extra fatty (rich) soup, which in my opinion is absolutely necessary in ramen. The portions are large, adequate. I recommend getting the combo, because the pork fried rice is just amazing. I actually liked it better than the ramen, but don't let that take away from the ramen. It's really good. Personally I like Orenchi in Sunnyvale, and the Shio at Santouka but this place comes a close 3rd. The combo I believe was 11.95 for salad, regular ramen, and a side of fried rice.

My favorite place for Ramen hands down.   There was a time when I lived in DT and I would come here almost weekly.  It is my comfort food on a rainy day or when I had a bad day at work.  I would immerse myself in the silky, milky soup base and slurp down the noodles and instantly feel better, like I've been wrapped in a warm cashmere blanket.   I get half order of noodles and get their gyozas too. The size is bigger than the Hataka Shinsengumi ones, but not by much.  Or if I'm really hungry, I would get the combo: ramen + rice bowl. So addictive, they are, no wonder people keeps coming back and doesn't mind the wait.  My advice is to put your name down, and then walk to the little store with blue tiled roof in the Little Tokyo center (next to Nijiya) and get some fresh, pipping hot Imagawayaki.  By the time you came back, you are almost there to be seated. I'm writing a bunch of reviews of Ramen places on a cold, gray, rainy day and I think I will get me some Daikokuya today.

Daikokuya Ramen in Little Tokyo is the Holy Grail of ramen restaurants.  Like in the Japanese flick, Tanpopo, we took our band of four, hard-core ramen afficionados to Daikokuya in our search for the best ramen in California.  And this, my friends, is IT. Let's start with the broth, because a bowl of ramen is all about the broth.  Daikokuya boils black pork bones for nearly a day to create a thick base that is ladled into each bowl.  Hot steaming miso-looking broth is added to the pork concentrate to form a full-bodied broth that has no overtones of saltiness or soy or miso.  The rich flavors roll over your tongue making much happiness. A bowl of steaming hot Daikokuya ramen will only set you back $7.50, and is loaded with ramen noodles, flavorful roast pork, bean sprouts, pickled bamboo shoots, a generous handful of green onions, and a whole hardboiled egg that has been soaked overnight in soy.  The egg could have been less hard-boiled, and they could have thrown in a more generous helping of bamboo shoots, but none of us could finish the bowl, so we weren't complaining. The best deal was a combo set-up with a bowl of Daikokuya Ramen and you choice of a mini donburi.  We strongly suggest the shredded pork donburi.  OMG.  It is to die for.  We tried to pick apart the flavoring on the roast pork -- not teri -- not oyster sauce.  I can just tell you that it is GOOD!!!  The ramen/pork bowl will only set you back $10.50. Every time we have been here, we have had a 15 to 45 minute wait.  Just walk in, put your name on the sign-in sheet.  If you want to get seated faster, allow yourself to be seated at the counter.  Located right on the original Little Tokyo row, there are options for pleasantly passing the time by checking out the nearby shops. The fact that Daikokuya has the atmosphere of historic Little Tokyo is a plus.  Each shop along the row has a plaque memorializing the original shops that stood here.  For ramen lovers, Daikokuya is a destination restaurant.

Ramen - while most of us haven't heard that term since late night college study sessions, it actually gets WAY better than that! And Daikokuya is one of the best spots to sample what professionally prepared ramen tastes like. Beware: there's often a wait at peak times and while the line goes quickly, the place can get quite steamy in the summer. When this is the case you might want to avoid the hot ramen and opt for one of the cold noodles or even the "deconstructed" ramen, served with hot soup but the other items on the side... excellent, and fun!

I'll begin by admitting that no one in my family is a fan of al dente noodles, traditional or not. Okay, still with me? Good. Moving on. I made a point of coming all the way from Diamond Bar last time I was in town, despite the tight schedule we had, all because of the hype I'd heard from friends about the place. And like many have said, there's definitely a long wait (about 40 minutes for the four of us), partly due to the popularity of the restaurant, and partly due to how small it is. Between the four of us, we ordered a shredded pork bowl, two soup ramens and one dry ramen. The pork bowl was tasty, albeit a bit on the sweet side, and both styles of ramen were tasty and seasoned just right (and not overly salted like many other places I've been) - now if only the noodles were softer! Prices aren't bad, and you certainly get a lot of food for the price. Service is decent, though a tad harried given how busy they always are. Also, note that the place isn't terribly wheelchair-friendly - the walkways are narrow, and the majority of the seats are booths with sofas (I believe the rest were bar/counter seats).

Really guys!? I can't believe how this place is getting four stars. My friend recommended this place to us, and I'll doubt his taste big time. I almost barfed, it was that horrible. Reason 1: The waiters are horrible. Even there's a open seat, they kept it open for solid 15minutes. When the parking around here is over-priced, averaging around six bucks per hr. , each minute is important. And the waiters just killed it. Reason 2: I asked them to take an order, and they said "Could you tell the waitress for your orders?" I mean, if your not the waitress, what are you then? They specialize their work too much in an ineffective way, even getting to a seat is just a pain. Reason 3: The chefs (if we even consider them one) are talking, not focusing on their job. It took us 20min. for a ramen.... I mean what do you need to prepare for a ramen. Reason 4: The atmosphere is filthy. I know they want it like the old-fashioned Japanese diner, but the air smells like dust and its not vented. I can't they believe they got a B rating. 4 Reasons, and I'm still not at the food. Reason 5: Their ramen tastes horrible. HORRIBLE. How could this place get a four star rating? I doubt all of your taste buds who wrote a review. It's 8~9bucks for a bowl of ramen, and the $2 cup-ramen tastes way better. It tasted like those packaged ramen at asian stores. The noodle tasted like rubber, and the soup smelled like rotten eggs. I saw this group of two, taking home ramen. Why would you? They don't even know that ramen will suck the soup up and get soggy. Please don't do that. It's like showing your bad taste to everyone. I was there waiting for a solid hour for shit, and I didn't see one single Japanese person. I get it because no Japanese person will come to this shitty tasting place. I will never come again even if they paid me to eat this shit.

THE GIST: First review of 2010! With over 1000 reviews, we had to come and try it. Even during lunch on a Tuesday this place was jam packed and people waiting and ready to get their ramen on. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1) DAIKOKUYA RAMEN: the broth tasted homemade and not too salty... dare we even say it was a little on the bland side... but still good!.. We heard there is a fattier soup base available.. maybe next time we'll try that! There was a hefty amount of ramen, bean sprouts, at least a cup of fresh cut Green onions, super tender pork strips (super good here.. not like the dried out pieces you sometimes get at some ramen houses), AND.... 2) THE SOFT BOILED EGG THAT COMES WITH THE RAMEN: OMG the yolk in this egg is fit for the Gods.... SO DAMN GOOD. 3) SHREDDED PORK BOWL: We ordered a side bowl of this and what a great choice it was. The shredded pork was super tender, sweet/salty taste chopped up into bite size pieces topped off with julienned seaweed and we ordered the fried rice which very much complimented the pork. If you love Asian style pork dishes this is a must try! ENVIRONMENT: This place it a little run down but for the amount of foot traffic going in and out it's understandable and give the place character. It doesn't matter to us if the place is dingy as long as the food coming out of the kitchen is delicious! The old school Japanese decor is fun to look at too! SERVICE: Service is pretty speedy.. your standard friendly Japanese staff. DESSERT: Take a walk to FUGETSU-DO to grab a mochi or two..it's on the same block as Daikokuya and seriously the best mochis we've had since Japan!

My thought process as I'm walking up to Daikokuya: Is there a long line? No - SWEET! Yes - Am I very hungry/short on time? No - Cool, time to chill and grab a drink at Far Bar. Yes - How badly am I craving pork belly/fried rice? Really badly - Damnit, I'm stuck waiting. Other pork bellies and fried rice just don't compare. Meh, just ramen for me today - Go to Genkotsu across the street. Daikokuya's ramen is overrated. As a side note: sometimes I wonder how much of Genkotsu's business come from impatient Daikokuya customers.

Ramen was to me not as spectacular as "the other" ramen place here in lil tokyo but the food was deelish. I got the Daikokuya ramen and tonkatsu (fried pork cutlet) and the tonkatsu was awesome. Thickly cut and set upon a bowl of rice with some light sauce, along with a baked egg mixed in, I was more thrilled on the tonkatsu rather than the noodle. Lines form here so be patient. Kill some time by checking out the neighborhood stores before you name gets called.....  ;-) Irashaimase!!!!

What could I possibly say that hasn't been said before? As far as I'm concerned, this is the best ramen in the US - if anyone knows of a better place, please let me know. We always get the ramen. The broth is so satisfying, the noodles are perfect, tasty and chewy, the pork is melt-in-your-mouth, and the soft-boiled egg hits the spot. The wait can be a killer - half the time we attempt to go here, we end up somewhere else, but if it looks like the wait will be less than 45 minutes, we put our names down and head down the street to pick up some mochi from Fugetsu-do. Start with dessert and end with noodles - it's a perfect meal.

I've heard about this place for a long time and i've always wanted to come here. My friend and I came here at around 1:00 on a wednesday, and we surprisingly only had to wait for 5 or so minutes. The Daikokuya ramen was really good, but I have had better tonkotsu ramen elsewhere. I think next time I come here I'll definitely have to try the fatty version of the soup (though it kind of scares me that they add extra fat to make it tastier). My friend also ordered the potstickers and fried rice. The potstickers were strange, as they were all connected to each other via one long fried piece of dough. However, they were good, and not too heavy.

UPDATE #2 (July 07) Daikokuya. I wish I knew how to quit you. +1 star for consistently being so good that I drive 20 minutes to get there, and have conditioned myself to accept the 30+min wait. I actually recommend counter seat to booth. I like to watch the dudes work. And if you show up and are way far down on the list... there is a neighborhood bar just about 4 storefronts east. Be a champ - pop in with your pals for a beer and come back every 10 minutes or so to check on your place in line. UPDATE (May 07) On a Sunday night around 7pm, we waited only 10 minutes for our counter seats. Fantastic! However, the ramen broth was noticeably different than all the times we'd been here before. Much less of the delicious creaminess that to me is what makes this place so great, and much more of a typical salty chicken-broth type flavor that you'd expect from mere mortals of ramen-making. I'm not sure whether this means Daikokuya has fallen from grace. Maybe Sundays are off days, because they blow through all the great broth on Fridays and Saturdays? More likely, someone skimped on the broth preparation and didn't simmer the pork bones for "nearly a full day" as it says on the menu. I give an extra star for the reduced wait time, but it's a wash as I take a star away for diminished taste. ORIGINAL REVIEW - April 07 Food = 5 stars. Efficiency of kitchen and service = 1 star. If you go, be sure you have a snack first, because you're going to be sitting around waiting for 45+ minutes. HANDY TIP: when you finally get your booth, sit with your back to the door so you don't have to look at twenty starving people giving you the stink eye and just WILLING you to eat faster and pay your damn check. Because I'm one of them and I'm freaking hungry and I could be sitting in your seat if you weren't telling some dumb story about some dumb Mac torrent site to your dumb friends. DAIKOKUYA has the best, best ramen. The best. It's so damn good. I want some right now. I want the ramen fried rice combo. Put that stuff in an IV and just jack it directly into my BRAIN. That's how good it is. Whenever I get the crave for ramen, I always go over there. And I'm always SUPER hungry. And I always end up waiting for a seat for well over 45 minutes. The problem is that THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON for the wait to be this long! Regardless of the fact that there is a full house and a dozen or more parties waiting to sit down, none of the staff hurries nor appears frazzled. One of the booths opens up? Well, you'll just have to wait for the single busboy to go clear it off. Oh but the busboy is also in charge of the register. And monitoring the wait line. Everyone's waiting forever to sit down, yet the full staff just takes their sweet, sweet time. I don't mean to harsh on them, probably they just didn't get the proper guidance. Then a single girl will walk in, ignore the long waitlist, speak a few words of Japanese to the host, and instantly get a counter seat. Invariably she'll block out two other seats on either side of her, and the servers won't have the foresight to ask her to scoot down. I always walk out well-fed but with an asterisk of aggravation. I fantasize about Mr and Ms Daikokuya realizing how much more $$$ they could make if they hired JUST TWO extra bodies. Or if they got someone who understands volume and turnover to go pull some drill sargent stuff. Toss Batali a couple grand to go knock some sense into these knuckleheads for 2 hours. You'll feel it on the bottom line, Mr Daikokuya. More money for you brah.

My friend brought me here one night while searching all over for a bite to eat. finally we stumbled up little tokyo after me leading him the wrong way to a bar.   We walked over to Daikokuya and he said, it's the best around. I believed him since i didn't know to much about noodle soup because i have never tried it before. The only place i ever really heard about was Orochon because it was on the Travel channel. My friend basically ordered for me and got me the Daikokuya Ramen. I ate earlier so this huge bowl was a bit much for me to handle at that moment.  I thought the taste was fantastic. The noodles were amazingly tender, the pork belly was to die for. We also ordered the dumplings which were spot on as well.   Our service was awesome.  The language barrier was a bit much but we made it through the night.  I inquired about other asian places within the area and all the waiters were very eager to share some good tips with me. I will definitely be going back and ordered some more items off the menu.

The best ramen I've ever had in my entirely life :) I've tried so many ramen places but this is still the best ramen. The soup is so rich and the meat is so tender. What I always do is to mix garlic, green onions, and their ginger together with my ramen. It tastes so good. And ... the egg is just perfect. It has a special taste when you eat the yolk. I don't know what they do with it, it just tastes perfect! I found out that they have a branch on Atlantic Blvd, Monterey Park? I should try that one next time since it's closer to where i live. The parking will probably so much easier.

So, this has been my go-to ramen spot for what seems like forever. I am finally getting around to writing a review. First off, there isn't much to write about that hasn't already been said. The fact that I can get my ramen tsukemen style is awesome for those days I want to make sure I get every last piece of chashu in my stomach. Every side dish I have had has been delicious, especially the fried rice. The brothy flavor really comes through and their rice is almost always moist, but not mushy. Nobody likes mushy fried rice. I love this place, it's always worth the wait.

Yumm!!! Great food, but very busy. Come before traditional lunch/dinner time or expect to wait! No to go orders either. They are open late everyday and they are truly the BEST Ramen place ever.  Their house special, Daikoku Raumen is a lot of food and tastes great. Not large enough for huge groups though, unless you sit separately. See my previous reviews too.

If you think the center of Little Tokyo is the plaza, or.. Pinkberry's, please -- give me a break!  This place is definitely the crown jewel of many delightful eateries in the haven of great Japanese food.   This place has been an addiction - to the point where we have an evening itinerary around this place.  It goes something like this: 1) Do a "drive by" of Daikokuya to check out the outdoor line.  If there are &lt;5 people outside, find parking immediately and shuffle in. 2) If &gt;5 people *outside*, then pull up and kick out the shotgun rider so he can put our names down, circle back and pick him up so we can find parking on the far side of Little Tokyo (by the temple).   3) Walk through the scary side of Little Tokyo, cross through plaza (ignore the Pinkberries), and go to the Far Bar for some drinks and chatter (see other review on Chop Suey). 4) After 30-45 minutes, send the least drunk person as the runner to check on the list at Daikokuya.  If you are within 3 or 4 names, text msg the entourage to reel them in.   Now you're here.  You have to order the combo (Ramen + an appetizer) - I've tried every one of them.  Most of the combos are repeats of the appetizer list, so its a better value to get them as part of the combo.  The only thing that is not a combo choice, unfortunately, are the best (Gyoza, and Sliced Roast Pork).  Everything else you can get with your ramen. I rank them in this order: Best Items - Gyoza - watch out they are juicy and hot, they sometimes burst on bite.  Sliced Roast Pork - this must be from the same magical pigs they raise on some enchanted island that goes into the soup...Spicy Tuna Roll - its simple, its a good starter, and its always fresh (they have great turnover so the food is fresh). Good Items -    Fried Spicy Tuna - same as Spicy Tuna, just crunchy. Tuna Roll - you should really get the Spicy version... Tuna Sashimi - this is like an inverted tuna roll, just no seaweed - so they are practically the same.  Salmon Roe Bowl - like edible bubblewarp, these are squishy, plump, and *large* salmon roe that has a satisfying "pop* when you bit into them.  (Tastes fishy, what do you expect?) Fair Items - Cucumber Roll - I think I can make this...  Chicken Egg or Chicken Teriyaki - if you are eating chicken at a place like this, you should probably excuse yourself and make room for others at this place.  Tonkatsu - this is good, but its better elsewhere that specialized in cutlets. Nice portion though. California Roll - like anywhere else, but has eight rolls (instead of the cheap 6).  Tempura - not sure you want waste your stomach space on this...   The secret sauce of Daikokuya is - the soup!  Legend has it that it is prepared and cooked at an offsite location and brought to the store each morning so that the recipe is never produced in front of the patrons fearing a rash of Daikokuyos and Daikokuyens and Daikokuyayas popping up around the city. The chefs cook the hand-rolled ramen, throw in the necessary items  (green onion, egg, bamboo, sprouts, green onion, ask for extra green onion) and serve you right in front of you.  Expect to eat in front of an audience drooling with envy for their turn at the bar.  (Give them the chin-nod while you slurp loudly).   I'm hungry again.

I must tell you that I really like this place. I like almost everything about it. It feels like 30% of the crazy fun places that I've been to in HK and Japan. And 30% is good because the rest is just Yoshinoya to me. The food? Ramen is decent but for LA, it is to die for. Sad but true. Vancouver and San Fran are the only places to get something much better than this. The rest of the food goes from very good to bloody amazing. I must say that there rice is incredible, again, for LA. But how many spots can boast food good enough that there is basically a line all day long, all year long. The servers are cool, weird and a little out of their minds. I love the guys who are sort of either Japanese with a game-show host English accent or English and pretending to be Japanese. I still can't tell and I've been here around 40 times (live across the street). They are sort of condescending in a fun, young, un-Samurai-like Japanese sort of way. I get the impression that they are thinking all sorts of nasty things about their customers, especially when people get rude and pushy, but in typical Japanese style, the nastier the customer, the more loudly polite they get. The chicken terriyaki is superb although no such dish like this exists in Japan and who cares. This is really an American restaurant with Japanese vibe and some asian flavors. You will like it. And the price is very reasonable hence the crazy lines. The only thing I can say negative is that yes, it is so hot that you will find your butt sticking to the chair at lunch. Night is better. Just come in loose clothing. And get ready to listen in on some of the stupidest conversations of your life because at Daikokuya, they encourage hip hollywood cool mental-infants who are into anime, marxism and questioning their own existence. I've had noodles come through my nose once or twice laughing. Yah, so get your butts over here and get ready to stick...around. First taste: Combo Ramen with Rice or Chicken Terriyaki. Ice Green Tea.

Friends have been telling me about this place so we finally tried it today. Should be more like 3.5 stars... We waited a friggin hour!!!! Small restaurant, not too many seats, and a billion people trying to get inside so go figure. It wasn't too bad actually since we walked around Little Tokyo while waiting. We checked out the store next door too. We finally got in!!!! We got the bar though. Grrrrr... O wells... We were starving! Note to self: GET BOOTH NEXT TIME! NEED SEATS! We sat right by the big pots. It was warm. Squished in the corner. O well... We had the Daikoku Ramen, Fried Spicy Tuna Roll, and small side of tempura with rice.   Ramen: Good. Broth better. Needs more meat. Egg is good. Fried Spicy Tuna Roll: Didn't care for it. Tempura: Good (already slightly soaked in tempura sauce). Rice: Good with soup broth. Put lots of red pepper in the broth!!! :D Pretty good. Im not a big ramen person but it was pretty good. No wonder it's so popular. Cute, good, small, and japanese. :D

This is the story about a young ignorant girl who knew nothing about ramen. Friend to me: YJ, lets go eat ramen, Ill buy. Me: Ramen? I have ramen at my house, just come over. Friend: No, this is different its really good. There is usually a line to eat at this place and its like 8 bucks a bowl.. Me: What?! Wait in line and pay 8 dollars for freaking noodles and soup?!  I can get a box of 12 for that price! How good could ramen be? Ill just make you some and ill even put in an egg. Friend: just come, im picking you up riiiight now. Unwilling I went, and complained the whole time, about the lack of parking, about the line ( waiting nearly an hour), and about being out in the cold saying "we could have already eaten in warmth if you just came over.." and my friend just nodded patiently saying " you'll see." And SAW I DID. Omg the ramen at this place is amazzzing. Amazing to the point where I don't need the usual spice I add to my food. Amazing enough where I don't need any kimchi.. though I do need those little pickle things that they have. Amazing enough where I would willingly wait again and again for the hot rich broth with pieces of pork in the cold.  Daikokuya..just amazing! The end.

I went here with a friend due to all the rave I've been hearing about this place.  I waited and waited, and we were finally seated at the counter. It was busy.  There were a lot of people.  Was it worth the wait?  No. I mean, the ramen was good, but I've had better ramen.  This place has been hyped up.  I may return here, but I would never wait in a line.

Nani!?  Did I just fly back to Tokyo and took a sip of what I thought was already the best ramen I had ever tasted in my life?..... No, but Daikokuya certainly comes a close second, and was definitely a teary reminder of what Japan has and what ramen restaurants here should strive to achieve. In short... this is one of the BEST ramen you're going to find outside of Japan. Matt M. and I wanted to venture into Little Tokyo for a late lunch, and I suggested coming here after hearing all about it from my friends.  He had already gone here, so he quickly sped through the 405 and 10 to arrive in downtown LA.  Like others have said, parking is a pain, and we decided to park in the lot across the street that costs $10 for the entire day (or $2 per 15 minutes). Daikokuya does not take any reservations, and no take out orders, so upon arrival be sure to sign your name and party number.  The smaller the group, the faster you'll end up inside.  Like many have said, this is really the size of a shoe box.  There's barely five booths, and two larger tables and a bar area.  We waited half an hour for a bar seat (and during that time, we went geocaching around Little Tokyo!)  However, putting the wait and the pain of parking aside, this place is epic! Once we were seated at the bar, we knew exactly what we wanted... the Daikoku ramen combo.  Matt M. ordered the shredded pork, while I opted for the pork katsu.  He also ordered a lemonade, which our waitress offered to refill constantly!  Bottomless drinks are always a good sign in my opinion, but if what I hear about the ramen is accurate, then all I need is that sweet broth in my mouth. First our salad came out.  It was simple but had a tasty dressing on top that made it a very light appetizer.  It warmed me up for the second item they brought out, our bowl of rice and shredded pork/katsu that we ordered.  My katsu was made with egg over rice- a very good portion for one person.  I took my first bite into it... and my mouth went nuts!!  The pork was delicious!  The tastes in my mouth began to remind me of the times I had katsu in Japan... no lie!  It did not taste heavy at all, and the texture and tenderness of the meat reminded me of authentic Japanese cooking.  Mmm... I was only able to eat a few bites before they brought out the bowl of ramen. I took a few sniffs, looked over at my friend and asked again, "so is this REALLY that good," and took my first sip. OH. MAH. GOD.  I WAS BACK IN JAPAN. Well... close.  But seriously, this ramen is top knotch!  Filled with bean sprouts, chashu, onions, a broiled egg and noodles... you would think a simple bowl of ramen such as this would just be what it is... simple.  However, this bowl of ramen had flavors that literally exploded in my mouth!  It was delicious!!  The broth was full of flavor, and did not once feel like it was too heavy for me to drink all of it.  The noodles themselves were cooked to perfection (and yes, this seems silly because how can anyone mess up cooking noodles... but it's possible).  The chashu definitely melts in your mouth as you bite into it... and before I knew it, they were all gone. I think I spent a good amount of time eating and sipping on the broth, almost forgetting that I had a bowl of rice and katsu on the side.  By the end of the meal, I definitely could not finish everything, but I felt beyond satisfied with the bowl of ramen I had just eaten.  I am very impressed with what I tasted.  This really, really comes close to the ramen I had back in Nishi-Kasai in Tokyo... it looked the same, and definitely reminded me of the good times back in Japan. So while the wait is long and parking may be difficult, Daikokuya stands above that, and is definitely worth all the trouble just for this bowl of ramen.  I am definitely coming back.

I am amazed to see how many reviews have been made about this place. This small "hole in the wall" Japanese ramen place hit the spot three weeks ago. For those that live more towards the east, there is a Daikokuya that just opened in Monterey Park. We waited about 45 minutes to finally get a table. Was it worth it?!? Yes and no. Yes because there was so much hype to this place that it was hard to walk away from this place. No because I am a little impatient ;) Other than that, the ramen was flavorful. The broth was actually a broth! The noodles were tender and the meat was yummy! I got a side order of eel bowl because it came with the combo. That bowl was DELISH!!! I was too full to finish my meal, and I ALWAYS finish my meal!  Daikokuya UNO .. And ZERO! I honestly still can't figure out what the craze is about all these ramen places!?! I tried going to another one in San Gabriel and it was another hour wait, so I didn't even bother! The only reason why they didn't get a five star is because there are THREE Golden Rules they have printed in front of Daikokuya. Basically people cut and I believe because they knew someone who worked at the restaurant. They spoke in a different language for five minutes and low and behold they were seated right away. HMMMMM. No worries, I had a really good time!

I just had lunch at Daikokuya on this slightly chilly January day, and OH WHAT A LUNCH! I ordered the daikokuya ramen with a small bowl of chicken + egg rice.  This combo was $11.50 and also came with a hearty bowl of salad.   The ramen was most excellent! There were generous pieces of pork slices, the broth was so flavorful, the noodles were chewy, and the egg was PERFECTLY boiled! I really have to commend them on their mass egg boiling technique! They boiled it so that the inside was still slightly orange - the BEST kind of boiled egg!  I like to add a little soy sauce into the yolk.  So good! Nice work, Daikokuya! The chicken and egg rice bowl was also great!  The sauce was evenly distributed in the rice, the chicken pieces were flavorful and hearty.  Add some egg and onion, and you've got yourself a nice, filling bowl of delicious. This entire meal (ramen + rice + salad) was a LOT of food, and unless you are starving, you probably won't be able to finish the whole thing.  Especially because the bowl of ramen is HUGE.  However, you can always bring leftovers home and enjoy later! We showed up around 12:15pm on a Friday, put our names on the list, and we probably waited for about 20 minutes, which wasn't bad at all.  Once we were seated, the service was FAST.  After ordering, our food came in like....5 minutes! Quick, warm, tasty!  I like!

** GREAT RAMEN ** What would people do for great ramen.  Stand outside of a restaurant for 60 minutes on a cold winter day and pray that your name will be called next?  Yup, that's the case at Daikokuya @ Little Tokyo. For some odd reasons, I feel that the Little Tokyo location is more authentic than the Monterey Park store.  Perhaps after waiting in line for an hour and starving myself to death does strange things to the brain.  Nevertheless, I love the Daikokuya because there Chashu and Soup base is absolutely awesome.  I usually order their Daikokuya Ramen with Oyakodon. The Daikokuya Ramen comes with their yummy Kurobuta Pork Belly Chashu, Egg, Green Onion, Bamboo and of course... RAMEN :) Don't come here with a bunch of friends, or you would be waiting forever.

I'm used to spicy Korean ramyun so this was a change for me, but I loved the ramen here. The broth is crazy -- it's so flavorful and rich. The noodles have a slight chewiness and the pork in the soup melts in your mouth. I know it's lame to order one bowl for two people, but the ramen is pretty big so you might want to consider sharing -- I could barely finish mine! Just remember you'll have to wait and that they only take cash.

I have yet to experience "real" ramen, until yesterday. A friend brought me here and it was absolutely yummy. I wasn't feeling very well, but if I had to eat anything on a grouchy tummy, it would be here. I got the basic ramen bowl. Broth, noodles, egg, pork, onion and bamboo shoots. LARGE servings. I took the remainder home and ate it for a late night meal. Still tasted amazing. You do have to wait a while to get seated, but there is plenty to do while you wait. Just walk around. Go down the street and try a sample at the Japanese bakery. I can't wait to go back!

For 2 tables of 5 Yelpers each, we waited about 1.5 hrs on a Sat night for treats enjoyed at the "Big Black House" (the literal translation of Daikokuya from Kanji). While waiting, you can stop by Fugetsu-Do like L'aura and get some what looked like delicious mochi! We couldn't wait to stuff our faces with all the good stuff from the menu! Even though I had already seen the it from the window, I was torn at getting the Daikokuya ramen (you can get the tsukemen, which is just the same but you have the ingredients separate, or the soup with extra pork back fat. Mmmmm) or their other famous dish, the shredded pork bowl. Luckily, they have ramen combos where you can get the noodles AND a bowl of don of your choice. All for a price of $10.95. SCORE! Michael L. was way wrong when he suggested that I get the combo because "the ramen looked small" Instead, it was huge! The consistency of the noodles was just right. The soup was made from soy sauce and boiling pork bones all day. The egg was soaked in a special sauce overnight before serving. Tender kurobuta or black pork was used. And the scallions was a nice addition. My only complaint was that the soup wasn't "burn-your-crotch hot" as I would like it. BTW, our server's mother was from Osaka and father was from Omaha. He's like the Asian Obama! Remember to save some of your appetite for Mikawaya ice cream mochi afterwards! And how come my slurping sound was more like SSSSSSSSSSUUUUUUU rather than AAAAHHHHHGGGGGHHHH like Felicia's?

Was so excited to try Daikokuya after reading some awesome reviews here.  Headed on over with the fiance and some friends and, as expected, waited in line for some good-smelling ramen.   The hostess and waiter who helped us were quite friendly so our dinner was off to a great start.  Our friends each got the Daikoku Ramen ..while me and the fiance got the Daikoku Ramen with the Kotteri flavor.  The boys also ordered combinations...ramen with tempura and the ramen with the small chicken egg bowl.  Oh yeah.. and we started off with the Sliced Roast Pork.  We also wanted to know what Ramune soda was, so we ordered one of those too! The Ramune soda came out and I realized I've seen that a couple of times in Japanese markets before but I never knew what it was called.  An interesting contraption of a bottle...a tiny narrow bottle neck so that when you push the glass marble in (yes, glass marble), the marble stays up in the bottle neck and it essentially shakes around your drink every time you drink it!  Interesting indeed!  Tasted like a regular soda, though... nothing too crazy...but definitely worth drinking out of such an interesting bottle. Then the food came.  The sliced roast pork topped with tons of green onions were delicious.  The sweet glaze was quite sweet over the overly tender pork, but the green onions give it that slight refreshing crunch and balances out the dish just nicely. The Daikoku ramen with Kotteri flavor was really quite yummy.  A huge bowl, too.  I don't necessarily think it's the BEST ramen I've ever had... but it is really darn good.  Apparently, my cousin tells me that the ramen used to be tens of times better and now so I'm sad I missed out Daikokuya's heyday.   All in all, though, the food was quite delicious and next time I'll check out some other locations and some other dishes!

I love love love this place. I hate hate hate the wait. The fried rice was absolutely delicious, the meat succulent, the texture, firmness, hint of spices, everything was just right.  Fried rice is always either in the bottom 20%, the middle 60%, or the top 20%.  This definitely stood out, much like the fried rice at Mario's Peruvian Seafood.  The portion is also pretty decent as I split it with another carnivorous patron. The eel rice bowl was also just absolutely delicious here.  I love eel everywhere and it's pretty good here.  I honestly can do without the rice.  I am going to ask if I can get a slab of eel meat next time to put on the fried rice. The ramen sadly I think is just okay, maybe it was the gluttonous serving of food I had in front of me, but the ramen just drifted into the background.  Everything from the noodles to the broth (kotteri) was decent but not great.  The pork meat was quite delicious though with a great fat to meat ratio.  This only on my most recent visit though and it's also my first time trying the kotteri soup.  I remembered the basic version being much better.  Or at least more distinct in flavors and not masked by the sweet creaminess of the kotteri back fat soup.  Either way I'm done with ramen all together I think.  If you're going to have noodles, have pho I guess. What is with the metered parking in this area operational till 8pm?  I am a native son, but for shame Los Angeles, for shame.  And at $2 per hour?  What a joke.

Wow!  This has become my favorite ramen place.   Before eating here, I would lament about how if only I could combine the noodles at Shin Sen Gumi with the broth at Asa that I would have the perfect bowl of ramen.  Well, Daikokuya is it! The broth was rich, dense, and unbelievably complex.  The chashu pork melted in my mouth with all its porky, buttery goodness.  And the noodles were perfectly al dente with just the right amount of chew. I also liked the fact that the standard ramen bowl comes with a soft-boiled egg, bamboo, and bean sprouts. We also tried the gyoza which I didn't like as much.  It wasn't bad but I think they put bonito flakes in the filling since there was a strong smoky, slightly fishy taste to it.  If you don't mind bonito flakes, you'd probably like it but it just wasn't to my taste.  It was still very well executed though. Now, the dipping sauce that came with the gyoza was out of this world!  It was like a strong ponzu sauce and it was so delicious I could have drunk it had it come in a cup. Be forewarned, the wait is long.  We were there at 2:30pm on a Saturday afternoon and still had to wait about 45 minutes before getting in.  When we left a little after 4pm, the line had gotten even longer.  So go hungry but not too hungry.

OMG! BEST of the BEST! I was truly a skeptic but honest to goodness I find myself thinking and wishing I were in LA so I can taste this piece of heaven again. The only negative I have is that  they skipped me and crossed my name on the waiting list! but it got solved effortlessly. So I am a happy camper! I am hard to please when it comes to food but this no lie is one of the best ramen i've ever had.

My friends and I were hanging out in LA one night & we decided to have some dinner. They had heard about this ramen spot & said that it was the best in LA. It was a really cold night so I was down for hot ramen for sure! When we arrived, we walked in and immediately bumped into people that were standing inside waiting for their name to be called to eat. THIS PLACE IS TINY!!!!! Barely any room to sit & wait - you are better off waiting outside for them to call your name. Since there were 5 of us, we couldn't fit by the door so we stood outside. It was a very cold night and I wished we could of waited inside but there was no room. :( We waited for about almost 2 hours to get seated. They called our name - FINALLY! We sat down & ordered. Once the ramen finally came out, I tried it right away. I wasn't impressed with it. I've been to so many other ramen places prior to this one that had less wait time & much better bowl of ramen. It was quite disappointing that we had to wait almost 2 hours for a bowl a ramen that just wasnt even worth the wait. Everything is already made in your ramen vs ordering the items separately & the egg was not a salty egg. I don't think I would come back here again. I'd  be wasting 2 hours of my life! I will stick to my local ramen spots in OC.

Dai another day. This place is a good place to drop into if you are already in Little Tokyo.  The ramen doesn't remind me of the ramen I routinely ate will living in Japan.  That kinda sucks.  But, I've grown used to it. It can get really crowded.  Be prepared to wait if you go during lunch or a busy night. It's a standard ramen joint with nothing special.  The booths are cool though. Don't half step.  Order a "kah-eh-dahma" after you finish.

Salt bomb, college, cheap...those are the first words that come to mind when I hear "ramen". Eating at Daikokuya changed all that. I came here for dinner and, even on a Monday night, there was a good wait. Put my name in, went shopping at American Apparel (I know, don't judge me), and by the time I came back, a spot was available at the bar. There isn't a lot of room at the bar but it's not necessary. I ordered the Daikokuya Ramen with kotteri. Mother of god. Ok, you have to--HAVE TO--get the ramen with the kotteri. I don't care if it's more fattening, blah blah, whatever, just get it. The ramen bowl was perfect. Came out hot, had noodles (duh), slices of pork belly,  bean sprouts, bamboo sprouts, sliced green onion, and sesame seeds. Needless to say, the ramen here is extremely good. I still dream about it.

Daikokuya is my definite go-to spot. You can find me here every other week! The ramen is extremely rich and the broth is bursting with flavor. The regular bowl is humongous so I usually opt out for the half-sized bowl. The fried rice is also a must! The restaurant is tiny; hence, the wait for this place may take up to 30-45 minutes depending on your party.

Came here for a light night meal with some friends, ~midnightish time.  I was expecting a horrendous line, but it was not too bad, maybe because it was so late.  We waited maybe ~10-15 for a table for 4 people. The pricing was not expensive at all, and the service was really fast. there isn't much selection in terms of ramen, but thats okay with me, makes choose that much easier.  I went their their regular daikokuya ramen and a pitcher of beer with my friend. The broth was decent, and they give you a softboiled egg in the ramen.  There was pork as well, but not that much, wish they gave more meat.   Also the noodles seem thicker than other ramen places. Overall it was decent ramen, but I've had better, Kudos for this place opening late and serving pitchers of beer.  I'd def stop by again if I was in the area.

you can't find broth so full of marrow and fatty goodness anywhere nearby. Jen took me out for lunch and we ate here.  There was no wait (what a miracle) when we sat down, but a small group had gathered at the front when we left. We had Gyoza to start (homemade ried pork and veggie dumpling)  5 pieces for $5.95  http://www.yelp.com/biz_…  a bit expensive, i have to say it was hot outside and a little stuff inside, so Jen got the Tsukmen.    It's really the Daikoku Ramen all separated:  noodles and fixings from the soup.  they used to charge 25 or 50 cents extra but i think they just upped the Daikoku Ramen price to match due to the popularity. i stuck with the Daikoku Ramen.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_… The pork was extra fatty today for some reason.   and for some reason i couldn't finish even half the ramen.  must have been the steak i had last night!  tell you more about that later.

The hype about this place is almost 100% true.  I've never NOT waited for a table here.  30 to 40 minutes is the norm early or late night.  This wait, is exactly why I'm going to say the hype is ALMOST true.  Waiting is part of the experience, and waiting sucks. That aside the Raumen is just about as tasty as it can get.  The long cooking cycle of pork bone and soy sauce is apparent in its slightly creamy reduced texture.  The noodles are heavy and satisfying, and the flavor is never too salty.  But it is the pork that blows you away.   Regarding this pork, a good friend suggested that I order extra pork slices on the side, as the soup could use more of it.  This, my friends is good advice; do it! Daikokuya is as fun to eat at as it is to say. ******8/2/07 UPDATE******* I ate here again last night...and let me just tell you, I upped the rating from 4 to 5 stars... Seriously.  This place is the bees knees...  We ordered the Raumen combination which comes with Japanese salad and pork bowl... un-freaking-believable.  TONS AND TONS of tasty food.  This place is well worth the wait.  The food and the lively atmosphere totally make up for the wait.  Thank Buddha for Daikokuya! *********10/15/07 Edit************ I'll say it again: the bees knees... no shit...just the thought of this place gives me a Japanese orgasm.

Got here around 11:15 after a Laker game, 45 minutes before closing time, and there was a 20 minute wait. Yea, seriously. Unlike other novelty ramen places where the chefs concoct dozens of special recipes to litter their menus with, Daikokuya has just one main ramen: Daikokuya ramen. If you've made the decision to come to Daikokuya, your only real decision is picking the rice bowl that you want as your side. I am far from a ramen connoisseur, so I will do my best to describe their ramen. The broth is white and creamy, not spicy at all. The pork belly is on the leaner side, which means more meat, less fat. The noodles are probably the chewiest ramen noodles I've ever had. Allow me to embrace the Taiwan inside me - QqQ~! My thoughts - the smooth, creamy broth was nice, but got slightly boring. I'm an addict of spice, so I would've preferred a little more kick. Throughout the course of the meal, I pretty much had my chopsticks in my right hand, and the red pepper shaker in my left. I ordered the pork cutlet bowl as my side dish, which was decent. They cooked an egg on top of the cutlet, which thanks to the runny yolk looked like a delicious idea at first. Unfortunately, the egg on top turned the katsu soggy, which was a big nono. No! David P. ordered the normal fried rice as his side dish, which was ludicrously delicious. Fried rice has no business tasting that good. It tasted like...barbeque.

I'm not really a fan of the murky broth, but there was something about the ambiance, the small tight knit corner. the chefs, and everything that the restaurant embodied that made this a better experience for me. i love that they soft boil their egg, and the broth is super rich and the noodles have a great chew. super impressed. I definitely can see how people who love the rich broth would love this place. I'm more of a shoyu broth kinda gal =) this is not my kind of ramen, but I did enjoy the experience!

After going to Japan recently and visiting the ramen museum tasting some of the best ramen in the country, I knew it would be hard to find something comparable to what I tasted in Japan, but Daikokuya does a pretty good job (although I still think Katana-Ya in SF is still the best). My friend and I got the daikokuya ramen of course. It was good, but the soup didn't have enough depth to it as other places I've tried. The noodles were smooth and good. We also got the unagi bowl. I love unagi and that was the biggest slab of eel I ever saw. It was amazingly good! The portion was way too big so we didn't finish it even though we wanted to. Be prepared to wait for this place, at least an hour. Put your name down on the list and walk around the shops nearby.

You see the reviews people,  it's not a farce like Ippudo in NY either.  Authentic to the core and experts nonetheless.  They have many items all of which are very well done but of course their specialty is very in your face,  ramen.  High quality meat selection and great service give them the edge in California.   For me ramen is always about the broth and it's definitely good here but still not my favorite,  a 4/5.  Even though it's a side dish their unagi is amazing here,  not riddled with bones or poorly cooked,  easily the best eel I've ever had.  Worthy of being in the top 10.

My first bowl of ramen since returning from Japan and I must say I was not disappointed.  Of course you can't really compare ramen from japan to here, but I'm going to say this is as close as it will probably get.  This place was still busy with a list of patiently waiting patrons at 11PM on a Tuesday night.  The restaurant is plastered with signs apologizing for the wait, their no take out policy, and the reason behind it all is to keep the quality of the ramen high!  My bf and I didn't mind sitting at the counter so we were able to be seated rather quickly with hardly a wait at all.  This place can be challenging if you have a large group so be prepared to wait either way.   Parking: You can park on the streets late at night, but may have to circle a few times or there is a parking structure directly across the street from the restaurant.   FOOD: Ramen is always cheap, but this place is an ammmazing deal for what you pay, how much you get, and the quality! My bf and I shared the combo which came with a huge bowl of the daikoku ramen and a small shredded pork bowl for $10.95.  You can choose other options besides the pork bowl and they have quite a variety.  OMG I LOVE the shredded pork bowl ... It totally hit the spot.  I may even enjoy it more than the ramen.  The pork was tender and perfectly marinated.  The pieces of pork were perfectly charred on the outside and slightly crispy ... yum!! The layer of seaweed is key.  The bowl looks small, but I would be perfectly happy and full just eating that! The ramen noodles were also cooked to perfection. Not in the least over cooked and still perfectly chewy. The service here is great and we were in and out of there in 30 minutes or so.  The meal with tax and tip came out to be $15, which is outstanding considering how satisfied and full we were!

Seeing that many fellow Yelpers have said the line is a bear, I decided to try this place for a late lunch today and was spared the wait in purgatory.  It was too warm for ramen, so I went with the pork katsu combo instead.  I've nothing nice to say about the accompanying miso soup and salad other than they came to our table quickly.   For the katsu, though, I'm brimming with joy.  Utterly delicious!  Instead of a dinky cut that you get at most places, this was a nice, thick chop.  The breading was crunchy and managed to stay with the meat despite the egg and sauce, a real feat for this preparation.  Unlike most pork katsu where the pork is cooked to death, my chop was still juicy and tender.  The sauce was sweet and salty, and the caramelized onions underneath balanced out both flavor and texture of the dish. Yes, the place is grubby, and no, the service isn't great.  The food more than compensates, and it's not like you're eating directly off of the dingy surfaces.  I cannot wait to come back when the weather cools down some more for ramen and this mythical fried rice so many others have raved about.

If Ramen is what you want, then I got the place for you!  Located in the heart of Little Tokyo is a small Ramen House that serves up some of the best Ramen this side of town! They say the secrets in the soup!  Boiling pork bones & joints in a large cauldron all throughout the night.  By the time it reaches the stove the next day, all the goodness is concentrated in their famous tonkotsu soup base. Then it is infused with their secret blended soy sauce.  I don't know about you but that sounds "TASTY" for the price of $8.50 a bowl.  You can choose the Daikoku Ramen or Tsukemen. Known not only for their Ramen, they also specialize in rice bowls.  To be perfectly honest with you, a friend turned me on to the Shredded Pork Bowl & after that I was hooked.  Since then, that became my favorite dish!  Kurobuta pork belly grilled & served over rice with green onions, pickled ginger & sweet glaze served with miso soup & salad, all for just $7.50.  What a deal!  Don't get me wrong, occasionally I'll still order the Ramen but let's be real here!  I'm chinese & I can cook up my own damn Ramen up in the hizzo! If you decide to eat here I suggest you go on the weekdays because, on the weekends the wait to get a table is ridiculous!  Expect to wait a minimum of one hour just to be seated.  On the upside! there's lots of cuties that come here so you can check em' out while you"re waiting, that's what I do!

Always crowded, always amazing. Get here early. Seriously. I've gotten there at 5 PM before, and sat right down and when I left, there was already a line of people waiting. The reputation precedes itself. This set rocks my world: a bowl of steaming Daikoku ramen with spicy tuna bowl. The pork broth of the ramen is fatty deliciousness and flavorful, and the ramen and fixings are cooked just right. The spicy tuna bowl just adds something extra. Recommendation: sit at the bar if you want to see the process. It's nothing impressive, but it's just fun to watch them cook the ramen and prepare the bowls. Well, you might have to sit at the bar anyway because it's always crowded. Remember: to sign in on the clipboard on the chair in the front. Advice: don't come here on a date expecting NOT to smell like pork after. You will. But if your date likes pork, it'll be a great night.  ;)

This ramen was good, but it will not beat Hakata Ramen. Their Gyoza however, it's out of this world, it's so thick, filled with meat and leeks, it's awesome, you gotta have it when you're there. The ramen wasn't special cause you can't order any toppings, though they gave you flavored egg without ordering it, but still not enough to beat Hakata Ramen... especially for my taste :)

So I was having lunch with a friend and found out the myth about why this place got so popular!  Apparently when they first started, they hired students to form a long long line outside to make people think "God, this place's got be to GOOD" - just like how the Hollywood clubs would not let people get in until a line is formed~ Well, I think they did really well in promoting this place and I do admire how this place managed to succeed in a tough industry with thoughts.  However, with the food I was served, I just truly don't understand how all the yelpers were fooled and gave this place great reviews.  1400 reviews are just too hard to fake, but here they are...

If you check out Houston's array of Japanese restaurant reviews (Nippon to Teppay to Kata Robata to etc.), you'll notice a common trend of reviewers on what they call a "ramen quest." Thing is, these Houston restaurants just serve ramen; they don't specialize in it. Sounds like a business opportunity to me. Enter Daikokuya, the legend-(wait for it!)-dary ramen house in Los Angeles. Without boring you further, if you're not coming to Daikokuya to get ramen, don't bother coming at all. There's 1700+ reviews for this place, so you know it must be good. The joint is small, thus the wait is long. Make sure to add your name to the waiting list. After you sit, the food comes fairly quickly. Again, get the ramen. The prices are palatable at $8.50 for a bowl, $11-$13 for a combination. The combination nets you a small salad that's a refreshing complement to hot ramen and a small bowl of rice topped with your choice. Small is relative, as the ramen bowl is rather large; I don't advise trying to finish a combination by yourself. Service is friendly and expedient, and they're willing to split checks. A Los Angeles must.

Went here on a saturday night after some scoops....oh man just lost my train of thought...mmmm scoooooops!! Soooo back to ramen.  Got here, went inside, it was packed.  BOOOO!!  We put our name on a board that was sitting on a little chair.  Then waited outside.   Couple observations.  The curtain thing by the door.  That thing is NASTY!!  damN!  They need to take them off and wash them or something.  UGH!!  Another thing...the homeless dudes that are by here are damn rude!  They dont get the hint that we dont wanna give you any money!!(i gave em like a quarter, thats all i had, really)  This one dude was following around these guys cuz he wanted money from them.  Damn.  Thing i like about the plaza across the street is that at least the security guards make an effort to rid the plaza of the homeless, but i guess thats why this place has this problem. So we finally get seated.  Order up the famous ramen and a beer for me.  I dont have too much to say about the oodles of noodles.  Maybe it was cuz i was sorta full of ice cream but i wasnt too impressed.  It was flavorful and the meat inside was great and all but it wasnt anything that made me say WOW or anything.  Bleh. I'll try this place again one day...damn...i want some sushi...ugh!!  Hmm...do i have ADD or something? ok bye edit 4/7/08: so i went back a few times for the hell of it.  It tasted the same to me.  I just dont think i like this style of ramen.  The pork and egg however are excellent!

Came here around 11:30pm to meet up with friends that were already waiting, so it didn't seem that long of a wait for me until when we had gotten a table. The service was good, everyone was friendly, especially "Tai-Chi"- so adorable with his dimples and all, I just want to pinch his cheeks, roll him up into a ball and bounce him. =p I ordered a Combination of the Daikoku Ramen with a small shredded pork bowl and boyfriend also ordered Ramen but with fried rice. It was a lot of food, but we managed to finish our noodles and have a taste of the rice bowls. It was so YUMMY, but it didn't look so cute because everyone recommended me to get it with kotteri which is soup extracted from back fat that gives it a thicker texture and that made the soup all oily looking. But who cares, just close your eyes and chomp away, nom-nom-nom.

I dont' know if it was worth the three thousand nine hundred and eight seven hour wait, but the ramen was pretty damned good.  But the real star of the night was the gyoza.  Oh, dear Gyoza, so succulent and moist and tasty and crispy and mmmm I want it right now all over again. That said, it's quite nice, but after an hour's wait, I did find msyelf more grumpy than I should have been. The other highlight?  The mens' bathroom.  No, seriously.  Right above the urinal there's a seventies movie poster with a man who looks EXACTLY like a Japanese version of David Bowie.  Yeah, I said it.  And then I had "China Girl" in my head all night, because I'm classy like that. Anyhow, Daikokuya serves a decent ramen and a fantastic gyoza.  It's worth it, but only if you can stand long waits.

OK, supposedly it's "wheel-chair accessible", but it's SO cramped that no one in will be able to get in, let alone maneuver. The waiting area only sits about 6 people further enhancing the claustrophobic feel. To alleviate this, there are a rack of mangas (totally neat) on the right after you first enter the doors, but is usually blocked by another person on the waiting list. So, if you decide to pursue the mangas, you'll look like an inconsiderate jerk. There are extra specials which are only available if seated at the counter, which if in big groups are always beyond reach. Settling in a booth, I felt the menu to be pretty basic and was even more disenchanted. That, in fact, turned out to be a hasty thought. The ramen was of generous portions and actually pretty good. The type of flavoring never leaves a stale residue in your mouth, and I actually found myself trying to catch up to my friends whose bowls were considerably emptier than mine. I also had this bowl of egg-and-who-knows-what. I really don't remember, but I know that I wish I had it with the eel; I managed to snag a piece of it and found it to be flavorful, sweet, a chewy consistency, and of little quantity. There also is the option of having boiled eggs on the side, which I hoarded from my other friends. It did little to appeal my eel envy, but at least I had extra of something. Good luck trying to find parking.

You know a place has really good food when the server rushes you to sit, order and pay the bill ahead of time all within 5 minutes and it gets a 5star rating! Yes, I finally got to try Daikokuya, and let me say... FREAKING AWESOME!!!!!!  It's 12:40AM, you leave the club because it was boring as fuh and you're hungry. Where do you go? Apparently the SIL's boytoy mentioned Daikokuya.  I was expecting it to be along the lines as Santouka, but for me.. man oh man.. 100x better than Santouka.   At least for my palette. The broth was "murky" and did I mention I LOVE "murky" broth? The noodles were cooked very firm and the texture seemed more crunch and chewy. To me, it seems as though other places, the noodles aren't as crunchy or chewy. The fried rice was delicious as well.  But now its got me wondering about what other sides I should get with my ramen. The meat was good but it didn't have anything on the "special pork" at Santouka, but still overall, I really like Daikokuya.   I didn't know they closed at 1AM, thinking it was 2AM, so we scoffed down the food in 10 minutes.   I've yet to try the Costa Mesa location..hmm we'll see how it goes. Whether it's hype or not... I liked it. LOTS. NOW if only they were open past 2am. =( . I say at least try it once.

Mainly due to Man Vs Food but  I don't know how many times I've walked down Little Tokyo and someone who clearly has never been here ask where that place with the spicy noodle bowl from TV is. Well, I point the way and yes, explain that it will be hot and you will typically see some moron try to eat the hottest bowl they saw on travel channel.. it's just a given. But that's no reason why you can't sit back, relax and enjoy the show of someone making a fool of themselves. While I can hold my own with spicy food, I really don't want to sit in pain here. I have a buddy who went with some friends and the guy who took the challenge was in pain for a good two hours after trying it. Don't be like that. Just come in here, regardless of their hottest bowls, their not-so-stomach-killing ones are really good. And yes, the line out the door may be due to those trying to show how much of a man they are by chowing down hot stuff. Plow through it and enjoy some good roman. tongue destroying or not.

Several people have raved about the ramen here. Curious if this place lives up to the hype, I ventured out to little tokyo on a saturday night. Since it's a small place, I ended up waiting over an hour to be seated. I ended up going to another restaurant for appetizers and beers, and still had time to spare when I returned. I'm not sure if the quality of the ramen lives up to the hype, but I was definitely satisfied. The broth was tasty, and everything in the dish was yummy, but I wasn't blown away. On the plus side, the amount you received for the price was good. My boyfriend and I ended up splitting a combo meal of ramen, pork cutlet rice bowl, and salad for $11.95. Overall, the food was good, not worth the 1.5 hour wait.

NO WAY does this place have the best ramen.  I was looking for a good ramen place and saw all the good reviews, so I went to try it out.  I was sadly disappointed.   First of all, the wait is horrendous.  If you're looking for a quick bite to eat, this is not the place. Secondly, the ramen tastes awful!  The soup base is think and makes you feeling really greasy inside.  The noodles are on the hard side, which annoys me.  I went to Daikokuya on 2 different occasions and both times I felt sick to my stomach and both times I waited forever to get a seat for just 2. Don't even bother going there if you have a group of more than 4.  I promise you, you will be sitting on each other's laps. If you enjoy stomach aches, this is the place.

i finally got the chance to dine here after hearing and reading all the hype and reviews. this visit was totally not planned as i was actually craving for some sushi or chinese food. we came to little tokyo hoping to find some good happy hour so we wouldnt have to spend too much but ended up stopping at a bar for a drink while we "yelped" for nearby eateries.   it was pouring rain out and i was cold and getting irritated that nothing i was reading on yelp caught my eye. finally, he said "lets just go to daikokuya next door". finally, it was decided. we knew it was cash only so we stopped at an ATM to get cash out. we waited about 30 minutes before we finally got seated at the bar area...which normally i would pass on and wait til a booth opened up but on this night, it was so cold that i didnt mind sitting so close to the steaming pots. it helped warm me up. looking at the menu, i was expecting a big list of ramen variety (ie foo foo tei). but i only saw two types of ramen. so i just went with the flow and ordered the regular ramen and shredded pork bowl combo (like most yelpers recommended). for $11.95 i was surprise that the bowl of ramen was so big that by the time i was done with all the fillings of the ramen (skipping on most of the noodles), i barely had enough room to eat my shredded pork rice bowl! even the shredded cabbage salad was filled all the way to the top of the bowl. he ordered the combo with pork cutlet with egg and even that was tasty. all the hype was true. i've been to other ramen joints where i've actually walked out still hungry. but this place is legit. but i REALLY.....REALLY.....despise cash only places. the long wait is not a rumor, expect itt. and if you dont respond when they call your number, they WILL skip you rather quickly.

Two out of my three regular Daikokuya partners have departed my dear Los Angeles for other countries.  If I lose any more close friends this way, I'm going to have to start coming here alone, which ain't that bad I suppose. Anyway. What can I say that hasn't already been said:  Delicious, gigantic, brothy noodley goodness with an egg!  I haven't tried anything here but the ramen, but it is a-mazing!  My friend Luke, who moved to Spain, was born and raised in Japan, and this was the only ramen he approved of in all of Southern California.  On-again off-again bf lived in Japan for half a year, and concurred.  I just say hell yeah!  I've never taken a picture of the food because as soon as it arrives, the only thought left in my brain is "eat now." Forget street parking, finding a space is a gift from the gods, so I usually park in the pay lot across the street.  Secret tip:  Parking is usually $8, but I've haggled them down to $5 on more than one occasion.  And by haggled, I mean I discovered after I parked that I only had a five, and they took it.  The line is generally long, look around in the toy store next door, buy a snack at the market, and wait to hear your number called!  They won't seat you unless your whole party is there, so don't even try that trick either. In summation:  just go already.  It's fantastic.

Every time we go there, the soup has a different taste.. I had only one time that the soup was just right. It was very good! But sadly, other times, too thick or too oliy... I heard that it was not like that before. And recently it has become very busy so we stopped going there.

On a cold, rainy day, what better meal than a large hot bowl of soup?  Mmm soup.. i mean noodle soup! (this is a reference to the tv show "Friends" btw, for all the avid fans of the show)  But anyway, on to the important part - the food! What I ordered: Ramen + Fried Rice Combination Price: ~$12 Verdict: Mmmm... noodle soup The bowl of ramen comes with all the trimmings - egg, chashu, sprouts and bamboo shoots.  The broth was very tasty and not that salty.  I personally find Shin-Sen-Gumi's regular broth a bit salty and need the spicy miso to enjoy ramen there.  Although Daikokuya does lack the customization option that Shin-Sen-Gumi provides, placing a request for less of an ingredient did not appear to be a big issue since the waiter happily wrote in no sprouts for my friends. But for any detraction due to the lack of customization, the combination options more than made up for it.  The fried rice and ramen complemented each other very well.  In the end, despite the fact that I still had to trudge through rain and wind to get back to the car, I was full and content. Notes: - Be prepared to wait, even on a stormy day, the wait was about 1-1.5 hours for a table of 4 - Minimum charge of $10+tax for credit cards - Street parking is horrendous.  You have to park in a structure about a block or two away.  Although after stuffing yourself, the walk might turn out to be a boon instead of a burden.

I don't even want to write a freaking review because there's so many, but I'm a freaking yelper, I can't help it! Even if nobody will read this because the amount of reviews and the stars, it's a restaurant you gotta try. Wait is long, but a lot of people leave and they miss out getting their number called, so it's not too bad. Place is really small, no to go orders, gets really steamy in the room. Lots of obnoxious loud people as well. Ramen-really is the best out there. They even give you a whole egg! I always get the rice combo with either eel or sashimi. But broth is flavorful and rich, generous with noodles. Better than the small one in the market in Costa Mesa.

I just came here last night.  Lets just say it's pretty damn good. Everyone's spitting japanese. People are lined around the corner (for good reason). The price is nice. The broth is amazing. They even decide to take it a step further and offer some bomb sides to go with your ramen on the back page. These guys won my stomach. And the towel-head-guy... He's just a baller. Advice: If you're worried about the wait. Look at the waiting list and compare the people that have been seated with the same number as your group. If there is alot of them (like groups of 2), you'll only have to wait 15 min. And they seat you in waves like 3-4 tables of 2 at a time.

Wow!  189 total reviews for this place?  Truly popular place and I can see why! I had the opportunity to eat here at the UYE sponsored by Nicholas N.  I wanted to try other raumen joints because I've done the pho thing this summer and so I thought I should see what authentic raumen dishes were all about verses the Cup-O-Noodles or instant top ramens I've had over the years! I ordered the Daikoku Raumen Special.  I was confused at the spelling of "raumen" as I've always seen it spelled "ramen".  Oh well, you learn something new every day!  My order consisted of raumen noodles, a boiled egg, bamboo shoots, green onions, bean sprouts and black pork which is known for its tenderness.  The broth is made by boiling pork bones in soy sauce for a whole day.  Somebody was slaving over a hot kitchen stove!!!  Although the result was definitely worth it because the broth was pretty tasty!   The place is a hole in the wall and got really crowded with people waiting inside and outside the restaurant so it was good we got there at 5:00 when the wait wasn't that long.  The motif is done in a 60s theme with 60s movie posters and the wait staff was friendly and attentive enough.  I'd go back to try other stuff on the menu as Daikokuya does raumen up right!  I'd highly recommend trying this eatery.  Really good eats!  Thank you Nicholas for turning me on to this gem!

I tried to come here two other times and failed miserably since they were, for some reason, closed despite its opening hours until 12:00 am or 1:00 am on weekends, but finally last Friday I was able to eat at this delightful little ramen shop so inconspicuously located in an non-main Japantown area of Japantown. I am so excited to be staying in the area in a few weeks so I can almost walk here! First, they definitely have some of the best donkotsu ramen I've had; not only is the broth flavorful and thick but you can ask them to make it with extra back fat soup to make it even more flavorful! Their ramen is well cooked, not over cooked, and the right amount of bite / chewy to fulfill the flavor of the soup but still taste great on its own. The best part? The pork of course! Probably some of the most amazing melt in your mouth pork I've had. I've been to a handful of "amazing" ramen places and so far this has got to be my absolute favorite. They have these awesome combos for a few dollars more where you can get their eel and rice or their sashimi and rice as well as many other types of rice bowl foods and they give you a ton of food for the price and its all extremely fresh / good. They have bar seating and table seating and most days all day long there's a wait so get there early and don't starve yourself or else you won't want to stake around for the 30+/- min of wait.

After all the hype it received, I was soooo stoked to go to Daikokuya for authentic Japanese-grade ramen. I was so let down, it was just heart-breaking. I've eaten a lot of ramen in my day, much of it in Japan, from Kyoto and Nagasaki, to Hiroshima, Osaka, and Tokyo. Daikokuya may simmer their broth for 18 hours, and yes, the broth is rich, but not worth the hype. Perhaps it was because the soup was room temperature, or that my friends ramen was a bundle of over-cooked starch, but whatever the reason, I was seriously disappointed in this apparent "ramen mecca." So, the soup was "M'eh," the gyoza was sub-par, and I was horrified to find that the traditionally crispy "Katsu" was slathered in egg and thick sauce (NOT the tonkatsu sauce I've been rasied with). Whack. I will NOT return, and I will do my best to avoid any of my other acquaintances from making the mistake of shelling out their cash for this (and this is a very large compliment, if you ask me) "on-par" ramen. I can't believe people would ever wait in line for this crap when there are literally dozens of other places with great noodles in walking distance of this place. I'd rather go to Marukai, Mitsuwa, or Ramenya, ANY day of the week.

I'm a 400lb man but I hide it well with slimming vertical lines and I wear a really tall hat much like Abraham Lincoln. That's a lie, I actually weigh 160lbs but eat like a 400 pounder. A lot of times when I go for Ramen I leave just under the full level. That was not an issue at Daikokuya. After a night at the theater, side note, Mary Poppins at the Ahmanson Theatre was spectacular, we stopped in for a late meal. I would have given the place a 5star but it wasn't as clean as I would have liked. But it was the end of the night so I could just be over critical. So add a little note, not a side note, an end note, the food is worth 5 but it got docked for cleanliness. It's like doing a math problem and getting the right answer but forgetting to show your work. I went with their Daikoku ramen combo with Tempura bowl and it was fan-freakin-tastic. The woman in my life went with the combo too but got the Shredded Pork. I liked the Tempura but I was supremely jealous.  Everything was good. Seriously it was all wonderful.

Big steaming bowls of ramen on a cold day.  What could be better??? I've been here 3 times.  Is it my favorite ramen place?  No, but it is close.  This is #2 to Shinsengumi for me.  The seating is miserable and the parking is atrocious, but it is the closest decent ramen from where I work. I like their Daikoku ramen, firm noodles.  Haven't decided if I like the kotteri flavor better.  Guess it depends on the mood.  The egg is cooked well, but I do wish the center was a little warm.  Learned that, if I break it open and let it sit in the broth, it is perfect. Get there early and you might stand a chance.  Try to park south of the Japanese Village Mall.

Congratulations Daikokuya - you went from a 3-star to a 4-star in my book. But I'm sure you don't give a rodent's donkey considering there's the other 1300+ reviewers that love you more than I do. ANDREW F's STORY (to cut the crap - scroll down to 'CUT THE CRAP'): So why the change of heart? I realized, I didn't give you enough credit. And yes, the change of heart was the result of me going back to Shin Sen Gumi Hakata Ramen last night and deciding that their ramen noodles are STILL SUPERIOR to yours. OKay! OKAY!! HOLD ON!!! Now before you start getting out the torches and pitchforks to hunt me down, let me say  this. YOU WIN IN EVERYTHING ELSE! Your pork is of higher quality. Your broth tastes richer and more flavorful. Your bamboo? LOVE IT! So all in all, every aspect of your famous Daikokuya ramen is superior to Hakata's.. except for the most important thing - the ramen. Theirs is just better - at least in my opinion. But eating there (just last night) was enough to convince me that I actually do love your Daikokuya ramen ingredients. Your broth IS beautifully tasty. Your cuts of pork ARE spectacular. CUT THE CRAP: Daikokuya is very tasty and gives you a very authentically Japanese ramen shop feel. The waiters all seem pretty hip and they move in and out really quickly. The food arrives REALLY fast and the waiters are more than willing to answer questions you may have, and more than willing to accommodate to your random requests. Be ready to wait, because just like you, everyone else wants to eat here, so they fill up REALLY quickly. They have tables that seat 4 or you can eat at the bar. I don't recommend you come here if you have a large group and all want to sit together. The items on the menu are all reasonably priced for what you are getting. The flavors are all there, but it really depends on what you're looking for in the ramen. For me, because Hakata is my measuring stick, Daikokuya lost in terms of ramen quality, but won in all other aspects. If you like near al dente and curly noodles - Daikokuya is your thing. If you like straight noodles and the option to choose your firmness of noodles, Hakata is the winner. IN THE END: So congratulations! You get the upgrade from me thinking that you're just okay, to you being awesome!

After trying other ramen places here in the LA area....still hands down the best ramen. Ordered my usual combination of kotteri ramen w/ the shredded pork bowl. When ordering the combination you get a salad, ramen and bowl of choice. Cabbage salad - Finely shredded cabbage with a tasty salad dressing.  A nice way to start off the meal (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…). Kotteri ramen - Extra fatty ;-) pork used to make the broth (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…).  Unhealthy...but wth it's hella good!  Noodles are perfectly cooked and comes with some bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, and a soft boiled egg (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…). Shredded pork bowl - I opt for no green onions on my pork bowl as I find the green onions overpower the flavor of the pork.  For me...it's all about the flavor of the pork so i skip the green onions or else you'd see a huge mound on top (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…). Don't be surprised to wait 30 mins to an hour for this place.  However, they do have a location in the MP area but I find their broth to not be as flavorful as the OG location.

I will NOT spend more than 2 hours waiting for a seat and especially for a bowl of ramen. This was my first and last time at Daikokuya. I've had quite a few bowls of ramen in my lifetime and to be honest, I've had better. At least I know and can attest to say that I've tried one of LA's best ramen houses but seriously the wait for a seat was definitely not one of my finest moments. The hype didn't live to its name and sad to say, I wished I can get my 3 hours of my life back! I can see why people flock to this place like church on a Sunday morning and the secret is in the broth. TIP: Dare if you must, come early if you can.

After many attempts (it gets super crowded here during lunch time) I finally got my ramen!!!  I suggest you go right when it opens or after 2:00 PM. My BFF and I shared an order of gyoza.  We love the gyoza here.  The skin isn't too thick and it's pan fried perfectly.  There is a crispy caramelized crust to it that's so good.  The dipping sauce for it is tasty as well.  It's a light, but flavorful ponzu sauce. I got the ramen + shredded pork bowl combo (mainly for the salad).  I love the salad here.  It is a cabbage salad with a mayo-masago dressing.  I could eat bowls and bowls of this.  It's so tasty and the dressing is so unlike what you find in the markets or other places.   The ramen here is to die for.  The soup is flavorful and it isn't too rich although you can make it more rich by asking for kotteri.  I asked for it once and it's not really my thing....I'm not a complete health freak, but the thought of adding fat to soup that I will be drinking isn't something I can really stomach.  The noodles have a nice firm texture and the pork slices are oh so melt in your mouth no teeth required tender.  There are a few pieces of bamboo shoots (I love bamboo shoots) and a soft boiled egg. The gyoza and ramen comes with a s***load of green onions.  If you aren't really a huge fan of green onions, just ask them to go easy on it. Also, if you are taking leftover ramen home, ask them to package the noodles and the soup separately.  Otherwise, you will end up with pump mushy noodles.

Several years ago... came here on a second date with my favorite Japanese lady friend after checking out the Takashi Murakami exhibit.  At the time I was a vegetarian and did not partake in in the deliciousness that is ramen or gyoza.  Instead, I ordered the Tempura-Don with no shrimp.  How sad. (At that very moment she knew it would never  work out) But fast forward a few more months and this ex-animal hugger returned with a raging thirst for Tonkotsu broth and meat stuffed gyoza.  It was love at first slurp. I usually split an order of gyoza and get a bowl of the ramen for myself.  This is my favorite gyoza in the city.  Perfectly seasoned meat wrapped in a soft on the side, crisp on the surface dumpling wrapper, and finished off with a healthy sprinkling of fresh green onions. (*If anyone knows a better gyoza in LA please message me) This place arguably has the best ramen in Los Angeles...its a toss up between here and Santouka.  The broth is thick and can be made fattier upon request. The  chashu is fatty and is full of flavor.  The broth, noodles, vegetables, chashu, and egg come together like the final movment of a Beethoven symphony... intense and so good you want to weep. One thing that Daikokuya does have that many ramen houses do not... is garlic paste.  I do recommend putting a liberal amount in the broth... Perfect post Little Tokyo MOCA food spot.  But the only drawback is the line.  If you go early you will have no problems... but during peak hours dress accordingly with the weather forecast because you will be spending a lot of time outside waiting.  With that being said enjoy and good luck. Highly Recommended

Best ramen house in LA. Their broth is so rich and savory, and their noodles has the right bite to it and their pork belly chashu is so soft and tender. If you prefer a richer soup base, ask them for the kotteri broth. The place is small and it gets packed fast so the best time to go is right before they open or during the weekdays.

Definitely on my top LA RAMEN list! I can't even count how many times i have eaten here, but i can never get enough of their ramen! Location: heart of downtown (jtown) LA, parking can be difficult because there's very limited street/metered parking and streets are fairly small.  I highly recommend you park at the korean market building/ YOHAN plaza (parking fee can be validated if you buy anything inside the market).  The walk is very short and you don't have to worry about having enough coins for parking.   Food/Service: the store itself is relatively small compared to typical japanese resuarent so the wait can be quiet long sometimes.  Please be patient! it is worth it.  Service is great! they try to accomodate and give you an approximate wait time so if you are in a hurry you don't have to wait there forever.   They only serve one type of house ramen! I heard they've recently added a Kimchi flavored ramen but haven't had a chance to try it out yet. DAIKOKUYA RAMEN: It comes in a big bowl so if you have a small appetitie you can consider sharing it with another person!  You can also order ramen with another dish (combo: choices are eel/unagi rice, katsudon, spicy tuna don, fried rice- btw Their FRIED RICE IS OFF THE HOOK! A MUST TRY ITEM). The soup base is made with their secret ingredient but the flavor is so light and not too oily.  Each bowl comes with a Half cooked Egg, bamboo shoot, few pieces of slow cooked pork, and lot of green onion.   SPICY TUNA ROLL: appetizer portion.  Nothing crazy about this dish GYOZA: their gyoza is very authenic.  Not the typical ones you find at any japanese restuarent.  It is flat, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  The juice squirts out in your mouth when you bite into it! The side salad that comes with the meal is also very unique.  The light majy sauce gives the plain thin slices cabbage salad an extra kick.   A must try ramen place! there's also small shops and boutique stores around the area if you are bored by the long wait!

My favorite ramen house.  Ive introduced this place to alot of friends, and they love it.  Even my mom, whos not a big pork fan, enjoyed it.  This place reminds me of that japanese movie Tampopo about a woman obsessed with making the perfect ramen.  It really is.  I like to order the fried rice, or the chicken terriyaki side, with my ramen, and after that, i want to fall asleep and die on the curb because im so full, but its a delicious meal.  They serve Kirin on tap, and the prices are great.  The summer cold ramen is really refreshing too!  Try new things here.  Its super.

I didn't even have to think before clicking on the 5 star rating. Of course, this isn't the BEST ramen I've ever had in my life (and happy thoughts of Osaka's 4 kings ramen enter my mind for a while) but it's definitely the best I've had in LA. The soup base is sooooooo good...and that's IMPORTANT to any noodle-type dish. Decor is cute. Rows of jap comics at the front entrance for those who are waiting (and you could be waiting for a while so here are points for the restaurant's foresight).

Awesome!! I am #480 reviewer!! haha. We were piggin' out during Nisei parade last weekend, and while I was mesmerized by the awesome parade, Al was bugging to go get Ramen. haha.. what a pig! But that was actually a really good time to get in there.. 'cause everyone is out watching the parade! ( brownie points for my big guy! haha) We sat at the noodle bar and took up the last two available seats. (which was an awesome experience 'cause we get to watch them make our food)   My dude got their signature ramen, but I just couldn't do it 'cause I was still very full from the Japanese pizza I ate earlier. hehe.. so I just got an order of tempura. (which was so very yummy!) but what I really want to talk about is their Ramen!! My gosh!!! We were seriously in Ramen heaven!! The broth was drizzled with fresh green onions, and the boiled egg was half cooked, so the egg dazzled the broth with that melt in your mouth essence. My gosh...just thinking about it makes me drool for D-Ramen!   well, now I know why i am review-er #480. haha. It's never too late to become a believer right?! hehe.. Service was fast and friendly... that's good enough in my book!   By the time we finished...the wait was out the door!! I gave Al a big Thank you hug! hehe.. and we went to get froyo! hehe...

11:15am on a Saturday morning and there was already a line forming! Was NOT expecting THAT. Daikokuya is a really small spot that kind of looks like something from Japanese tv. Kinda like a small street restaurant. Just a handful of tables and a long bar in front of the chefs and their cooking stations so you can watch them make their delicious food. I ordered the Daikokuya Ramen and it was HUGE (insert "that's what she said" here). lol. I haven't seen white ramen soup before so I was a bit thrown off, but intrigued. It was loaded with green onions, pork belly and bean sprouts. It was by far THE BEST ramen I have ever had. If there was a Daikokuya up where I'm at, it would be GAME OVER. My boyfriend ordered a bento combination with teriyaki chicken and maguro sashimi + CA rolls. The portions are ginormous here! And the chicken was fried with that crispy skin... mmm.... The maguro was real fresh. If I am EVER... EVER in this area again, I'm going to get me a bowl of DAIKOKUYA RAMEN.

Okay.  I heard there's usually a CRAZY wait for this place, so I walked over at 4:30 to get a table for 2.  I still had to wait 20 minutes.  The hype was affirmed. We ordered the Daikokuya ramen, of course, and the broth was tasty, as was the chau siu.  I liked that it wasn't as salty as Katanya in SF (which everyone RAVES about).  However, there was something not very satisfying about this place....kinda like an over-hyped movie.  Can't put my finger on it though; I guess I wouldn't mind going to the closer Shinsengumi for ramen.   Overall, I'd come back for more...but not very often.

Ok, WHAT IS GOING ON??  Four years ago, I would have given Daikokuya 5 stars.  I've gone 3 times this past month and the quality has declined considerably.  If I were to rate the gyoza, I would give them 5 stars.  They are juicy, bursting with flavor, and fried perfectly so the skin isn't burnt or too soft. The rest of the food gets 2 stars.  The ramen broth is so inconsistent.  I've been here on a Monday, a Thursday and a Friday and it's all different.  It's not as creamy, bold and flavorful as it used to be.  Now it's just watered down pork flavor with lots of salt.  The fried rice used to have huge chunks of pan fried, crispy  fatty pork.  And now, I have to search for tiny bits.  Can someone please tell me what is going on and why people are still giving this place 5 stars??

This is hands down one of my favorite places to get ramen.  They have one in Costa Mesa, but I heard the Little Tokyo one was the best so I knew I had to try it.  First time I came here the line was pretty long, the wait was over an hour.  At that point I knew the ramen was going to be amazing.  Finally we were seated and the wait had been worth it.  I got their soyu ramen and it was hands down one of the best and most flavorful ramen I've ever had.  Everything about it was great.  Oh did I mention tey have really good fried rice as well.  I definitely reccommend this place if you're in Little Tokyo.  Only downside to this place is that it's pretty small and the wait is usually pretty long.

They only have two choices for ramen. Original ramen and cold ramen with soup on the side. The original ramen have pork, a whole egg!!, and tons of greens and veges. The broth is quite flavorful and noodles cooked just right. The soup on the side version of the ramen is basically the same thing as the original but everything is separated. All the toppings an meat on a separate plate and the noodles and soup in separate bowl. It's suppose to be for hot days when you don't want to eat your food in hot soup. The shredded pork bowl was amazingly good! Well seasoned pork on top of rice. The salmon roe bowl was alright... I like my roe cold or room temperature. The bowl we got had warm rice so that made the roe warm also... You can get these rice bowls in a combo with the ramen for just an extra dollar or two. Overall the ramen was quite good, maybe one of top 3 best ramen I've tasted. But it still doesn't make me fell like it's so good that I crave to come back for more. Maybe the second time around would change my mind.

When I think ramen, I think Helen Cheng, so when Helen Cheng says this is the 'BEST RAMEN" she's ever had, it truly must be the BEST. So, on my journey to try some of the top foods in LA, I turn to yelp and find that Daikokuya is amongst the top 4 highly reviewed places and after the confirmation from Helen, off we jet to Little Tokyo! Now, I've only had 1 real ramen experience before this (at Katana-Ya in SF), so I can't say I'm much of a connoisseur. But...WOW. The broth blew me out of the water. Out and over into the tidal waves and back. It's so flipping rich and delicious and warming; PERFECT for the chilly day. Additionally, this ramen was SO simple -- which makes it stand out even more. At Katana-Ya in SF, they deck the ramen out with a whole lotta things, which is great, but for a ramen to be served so simpley: just broth, noodles, chasu, beansprouts, and one boiled egg....says a gosh darn lot about the high caliber of deliciousness! Anyway...they also serve a handful of other yummy side dishes such as fried rice and gyoza which were also stellar. The place is small, and it took about 30 minutes to get seated...but totally totally worth it. Oh! And the service is so efficient and fast! Helen says that now that I've experienced one of the top ramen's ever...my ramen bar has been set very high. I guess a trip to Japan will be it's only competitor.

There's not much more that I can add to the almost 1800 reviews. The mini sausage (kurobuta (black pork) was meaty and intense with flavors; dipped with the yellow mustard, a fullfilling side to the ramen! The fried spicy tuna (ground spicy tuna wrapped in a shiso leaf and deep fried in tempura batter) a bit of a disappointment, as it was not spicy.  The little morsels were though light in flavor, and the tuna wasn't over-powering. The kurobuta pork belly chashu was melt in your mouth wonderful. The line moves fairly moderately once you get your name on the list; I would suggest trying to get a counter seat, so you can watch the actions of the cooks and the ramen bowls being created. Worth the venturing to and worth the wait.

Hmm what can I say that hasn't been said yet? Nothing really, so an advice, if you've never had Daikokya, make sure to make the Little Tokyo location your first visit, get the full experience, and COME EARLY! Or really late and have a few glasses of beer with the servers!

Lives up to the hype! It was an hour wait on a rainy Friday night. We headed straight there as soon as we arrived in LA. You know it has to be good, if people in Norcal are talking about how awesome the ramen here is. And they were right! It's just my type of ramen. Not too oily nor salty, the egg is cooked to perfection, and the broth tastes eggy and meaty. The chatsu pork they put in is fatty, which I love! Because it just melts in your mouth and it breaks so easily with a pair of chopsticks. Oh man, what a delicious humongous bowl of ramen. My friend ordered the shredded pork bowl which was amazing also! I had to eat some of hers too because the concept is simple but brilliant. Shredded up pork and crunchy pork skin over rice, covered in unagi sauce with tons of green onions for garnishing! This might be even better than the ramen! I just wanted to keep alternating between the two bowls, it was just so soo sooo good. We had our kind waiter recommend some appetizers. He said the fried spicy tuna and gyozas were good so we got both! I LOVED the gyozas! The meat was so flavorful, it actually looks like a potsticker eggroll more than a gyoza. Best gyoza I've ever had! Seriously. The fried spicy tuna was good too, it was wrapped in a basil leave so it reminded me of some Vietnamese flavors. I'm not a big fan of tuna, because I think it's so tasteless, but with this appetizer, I have no complaints. I've never been to Japan, but I can only imagine the street food there to be like Daikokuya. Simply delicious.

Meh. Considering the rave reviews Daikokuya gets and its historic reputation, I was expecting A LOT more. Their ramen was major underwhelm-ment! (Copyright Eric W.) I'm not saying the ramen was bad.. The rich pork broth is much better than what you find at most ramen shops. And the fact that they use Kurabuta Pork definitely gives Daikokuya a hefty boost: their pork is among the tastiest and most tender I've had. Muy delicioso. And their noodles are a good texture. All in all, good stuff. But in the end, what is ramen (or any noodle soup for that matter) all about? The soup. And sadly, while good, Daikokuya's pork-based broth just can't compare with either Hakata's or Santouka's. It doesn't have the same richness, or even a satisfying saltiness. Best in LA? Hardly. Add the fact that Daikokuya costs between $1-3 more than any other ramen joint I've been to and the utter lack of free parking in Little Tokyo (which requires wading thru traffic just to get there).. I'm not inclined to bother with Daikokuya. If you do come here, what should you get instead? The shredded pork rice bowl. Tasty soy sauce(?) braised Kurabuta pork over rice. OMFG. Their ramen was practically a waste of a meal (I should've gotten Pho in Chinatown instead, or gone home to Santouka), but I ordered the rice bowl to go.. and damn it was so satisfying! Huge portions of deliciously fatty pork. Get it, you won't be sorry.

Our friend who had lived in Japan for 4 years said this is the place to go when we visited him in LA.  OK!  I thought about the last time I had ramen in SJ and I could only honestly remember how salty and overpriced it had been.  What I know now, thanks to Daikokuya is that ramen is really meant to be an experience, not just a meal. The place is tiny and crowded, and as we waited in the LA rain we made friends with others waiting outside. As we finally got called, the warmth and happiness and smell of ramen already let us know we were in for a treat. The actual menu is small, but we didn't need variety really, so we all ordered the regular bowl with normal salt. Heaven! The broth was hot and made our cheeks bright, and the superstar of the night was the delicious soft-boiled egg.  The noodles were light and chewy and overall the experience made me realize that pho now has a serious competitor.

Daikokuya,  the HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION OF RAMEN! Yay!!! With a title like that, you can expect a big crowd.  And with a big crowd, you can expect a long wait.  There's always a long wait here.  You can go at 3PM on a weekday and still wait.   It's a bustling, stuffy little place where they have a huge vat of pork bones constantly brewing. The floors are cracked and you end up smelling like the food you just ate upon exiting the premises.  Ugh.  So why do I keep going back??...it's so friggin' addictive! The broth is good, deep-down good.  The ramen noodles are just right. But what amazes me over and over again is the ALWAYS perfectly boiled egg in the ramen, perfectly soft in the center. If you're like me you'll end up over-eating here.  I love the fried-rice - some days it's excellent and some days it's just good.  Their gyozas are good too.  Their combos are great; you get a bowl of ramen with another rice bowl of choice, some cabbage salad, and miso soup.  Mostly everything is cooked with good 'ole pork fat and eaten with some ginger to cut the grease, this is my idea of a great time.  Time for a shower. 5 stars for the food.  4 stars overall.

Daikokuya is THE ramen house of Jtown. Timing is everything, come hungry but not too hungry lest starvation tempts you to veer off your intended destination. You'll have at least 15-45 minutes to work up that appetite They have 2 kinds of ramen. Daikokuya ramen, and a deconstructed Daikokuya ramen. That's it. No spice level novelty gimmicks, no variants. They just do their 1 thing, and its right. Slow cooked korabuta pork graces the soup - which is cooked for a day using pork bones. It's perfect, it's not too salty, it's rich without being overpowering. Don't come here if you don't like pork. Pair your ramen with 1/2 order of fried rice and prepare for a magical journey for your soul and taste buds as they lace their fried rice with opium. Ok maybe not but the fried rice really is quite good. Really, most everything here tastes great. I've tried just about every bowl in the house - avoid the shredded pork bowl, it's kind of boring. I'm not wild about their gyoza either. Oh and they have cheap beer. $10 for a pitcher of Kirin! I *heart* you Daikokuya.

Ambience and Location: Set off the main streets of Little Tokyo , parking is tough to find. Inside the ramen shop has old Japanese film posters.But somehow the chairs remind me of a milkshake bar. Service: We stood around for about 30s to a minute before the staff acknowledged us. It wasn't a great start but lets let the noodles do the talking. Food: I ordered the charshu ramen together with a shredded pork rice dish. The broth was not intense enough for me and I prefer more bite in my ramen . I like the steamy goodness as it trickles down my throat but I did not get this at Daikoku. I am of the half boiled egg tribe so I did not quite enjoy the hard boiled egg. But the RICE dish was very good. I liek the way they seared the CHarshu.Very fatty , very tasty. highly recommend that one.

Wonton noodle soup anyone?  I am clearly reminded of it when eating the Daikokuya ramen. So, what does that mean? Well, it means that Daikokuya ramen is slightly overrated. The noodle broth and ramen are delicious, but my overall experience is nullified by the blandish pork, long wait time, and crowded eating area. This place would be great on cold days, and the hot/fresh soup and ramen might just be worth the shivering wait, but common folks, there are alternatives! YELP them! =D

It's definitely a small, crowded restaurant with high demand. Not too many tables, but the wait is worth your time. Write your name and party down on the list and be amazed when they call your name an hour or so later. ...Seriously, just wait it out. Daikokuya has the best ramen broth in LA, hands down. There's the fattier option, but I didn't want my stomach to expand THAT much. A friend of mine tried it, and described it as "thicker" but without much variation in flavor from the regular (still fatty) broth. Though I wouldn't drink the broth on its own, it was deliciously flavorful; umami may be the correct term. The noodles aren't too impressive compared to Santouka, but I feel like Daikokuya had MORE noodles. Quantity over quality? One bowl is insanely filling, and led me into a near, if not instant, food coma. They take card here, yay! I'll be back one day to try their other options, but hey, you can never go wrong with ramen. To think that I once thought Cup of Noodle was prime stuff...

After all the reviews, my sis and nieces and I decided to have an early dinner at Daikokuya hoping that the lines wouldn't be that bad.  So we ended up going around 3 in the afternoon.  And believe me not, there was a line! We ended waiting for like 40 min to an hour and it was pretty hot that day too, so I wasn't too ecstatic about that. So was it worth the wait? Don't get me wrong, the pork belly ramen was really good.  But to wait for like an hour, I rather just go somewhere else. But the eel rice bowl was super duper good too. But if you don't mind the wait, then def come here for ramen!

So I've heard, read, and wanted to eat at this  place and just happened to eat here as some folks decided to go there. I got the combo thing where you get rice and ramen. I think they are know for that combo? I had the tuna rice bowl and Tuna was decent (considering it's not a sushi place). What bugged me though is that they did not give me a small plate for soy sauce (wasabi was good too). There was no low sodium soy sauce in sight. I did try someone else's rice bowl and I believe it was pork with teriyaki sauce. Pretty good. So... the ramen... Not exactly great. I can't complain because it's not aweful.. But it didn't have the soup base I wanted like from Ebisu (fountain valley) and orochon (la). So I was disappointed. The serving size for the combo i'd say is more than enough. I drank water. Toilet needs work... Maybe because I'm used to the OC or newer locations. Staff was friendly. They use PDAs to tale your order!!! Love that! So... I would go back for the rice bowls but not the ramen. It's a good place overall. Go and try it out. I doubt you'll be disappointed.

The first time I went I thought they deserved 5 stars.  But the last most recent time that I went when a friend took me here for a belated bday dinner i thought it only deserved 3 stars.  So i'm taking an average and giving it 4 stars. PROS  * the portions are pretty large.  The best deal is the combination plate...way too much food but if you share it with someone else then not too bad  *  They give you a lot of toppings in the ramen CONS  *  the line here is like ridiculously long.  We've always had to wait almost an hour.  Maybe that's why people think it's so good because they're so hungry  *  the ramen itself is just slightly above average.  It's not as flavorful as Santouka and not as much variety as Ramen Ya  *  hard to find parking in downtown.  I always end up parking at the $3 lot.  That's not expensive parking by downtown standards but makes your bowl of ramen a little more pricey than it should be

Was feeling a little under the weather so I went for an early EARLY lunch and drove over just in time. I was the first one there and I really didn't care that I was by myself at the bar. All I could think of was the wonderful broth that makes me forget my worries :) Almost instantly it started filling up and I just KNOW everyone was giving me the once over like, "poor girl eating all by herself". Then when they saw that I ordered the combo with ramen, salad, and fried rice, they looked at me as if I had no shame. WHAT!?!?! Just because I'm by myself I should order one thing and shovel it quickly in my mouth and run out embarrassed? PULEASE... wrong girl.

Wow. So lately I've been on a journey to taste all the really notable ramen places in the LA area. I've gone to this place several times since last year, when I had tried it for the first time. Now that's a testament to how amazing this ramen join is. They really only have "one" type of ramen in soup, their Tonkotsu Ramen. They do have "dipping" ramen which is ramen that is separated from the soup that's used as the "dipping" sauce... or something like that. I haven't actually tried it yet. It must be good, but to be honest, when I want ramen, the ramen I would want is ramen in soup. Anyway, the fact that they base their business solely on the Tonkotsu Ramen shows how wonderful this dish actually is. You also have the option of using a richer, fattier broth for the soup called "Kotteri," which I always get. I mean... I'm still young. I can handle it. My most recent visit I ordered the combination meal of Tonkotsu Ramen Kotteri-Style with a Shredded Pork Rice Bowl. The meal is started off with a salad. I don't really the kind shredded veggies they use, but the good dressing makes up for it. Although I thought that the shredded pork would be synonymous with the pork belly rice bowl at other ramen joints, this rice bowl came out really well. I kinda wish they didn't put the candied ginger on top of the bowl, though, but that's just me not liking ginger. I just take it off though, problem solved.. Now onto the ramen. The soup base is amazing. Downright flavor packed in every spoonful. It's not too salty either, which many ramen joints tend to head towards. Their chashu pork that comes in the ramen is nice and tender, almost melting in your mouth. That's how good chashu pork in ramen is supposed to be. There are ample veggies, too, that make for a balanced meal that won't overwhelm the rest of the ingredients in the bowl. The ramen is nice and perfectly chewy, although they seem to use a different kind of ramen noodle than other places. The only quip I have is that the egg they serve with it tends to be overcooked and becoming hard-boiled. A really good ramen egg should be soft-boiled, with the yolk still very moist and almost runny. I wish they had it like that here. Overall, every single dish was really good. And the portions were huge. After finishing the ramen, I had to take the rest of my rice bowl to-go. In terms of the price, which came up to be around $12 for my combination, it's definitely worth it. The worst part of all this is that you will have to wait a bit at almost any point in time during the day. I've gone during dinner time as well as like 11 or 12AM in the middle of the night, and either way I'd have to wait from 10-30 minutes (I heard other people have waited longer...) to get a table. On the bright side, a lot of people don't end up waiting the whole time and just leave, thus making it faster for you, so don't lose hope when you see all those names on the clipboard! Parking is street parking, but I've always been able to find it, if not on the street it's on, then at the street over where the rest of Little Tokyo is located. THEY TAKE CREDIT CARD TOO! This place is one of the best ramen places I've gone to so far, on par with the likes of Santouka ramen. Yes, this place is amazing. On a side note, I love the descriptions on some of their menu items. For the chicken egg rice bowl, they describe the dish as "Reuniting mother and child in a soy sauce marinade over a bowl of rice." How depressingly delicious-sounding.

There was a lot of hype about the ramen here. I was surprised when I saw three things that worked against its fame. First how small it was, second the B rating it got, and third that there were only 2 types of ramen they served. All this before I ate.    The bowl of ramen was worth it, awesome taste, chewy noodles and the meat is so good. We waited exactly 43 minutes timed on my iphone on a Monday night (yes a Monday). Park on the street and just walk over. Tip: while waiting go visit the Japan plaza where they have amazing pastries, and a great mochi place. And go in a small group.

I brought my Japanese friends and they all love the ramen.   One thing I hate about this place is the wait.  I've learned after going there the fifth times.  I should put my name down and go walk around or do a little shopping.  I waited for close to an hour EVERY single time.   Hey, but that tells you that this is the right place to go.  You never see lines in restaurants that suck.  You just have to take my advice and put your name down first........don't forget.

I am a noodle-holic! I heard so many great things about this place but when I finally tried their Daikokuya Ramen special, I was disappointed. The broth is too salty for me, and almost created havoc with my 'hanging-by-the-thread' blood pressure. The noodle cost $8.50. 2 liter-bottle of Fiji Water later, I find my om and managed to calm my blood pressure down. I like Ajisen's broth waaaayyy better. But, thumbs up for Daikokuya noodles.

I came here Jan. 2009. My friends sister brought us here when my friend was visiting LA. The first time we came here... the wait was to long, so we tried again on another night... wait was still long but we waited this time almost 1 hour for a party of 4. I'm not a ramen fan. So I ordered the shrimp tempura/ terikayi chicken plate with california roll. came with miso soup. Hard to mess up, but I didn't enjoy it. The miso soup was horrible. The shrimp tempura batter wasn't the greatest and the dipping sauce was to salty. The teriyaki sauce was yucky. California roll wasn't cutting it either. I ended up not finishing my meal... and I was hungry too! My sister's friend loves this place and she gets the ramen. I was hoping to get a good experience since it's such a huge rave. But from my 1 experience, I will have to say, I had better.... and it wasn't worth the wait. If you're a ramen fan and dont mind waiting an hour or so to be seated in a super crowded place, then you may just like this spot. 1 star from me. Don't know for what though, hmmm... maybe their high tech ordering device.  I won't be back.

I think I am going to get eggs or tomatoes thrown at me for saying this, but I was not impressed with Daikokuya. There was no wow factor for me here. I was really looking forward to this place, especially since it has such glowing reviews! Perhaps I came in with high expectations due to the reviews or maybe because I wasn't hungry... I ordered the Daikokuya ramen with fried rice combo ($11.95). While waiting for my food, I noticed that each table has a jar of radish and a jar of pasty garlic. Wow, they must have known that I was coming, because these are my favorite things to put in my ramen. Shortly after placing my order, the waitress came out with a small bowl of veggies and mayo. This quickly followed by the fried rice and ended with my large bowl of Daikokuya ramen. Veggies with mayo - this was not to my liking, since it was way too decadent. Fried rice - I was really hoping to like this, based on the reviews. However, I really thought it lacked any strong flavor and was too fatty. Personally, my mom makes a better fried rice than this. Ramen - my bowl was large and had a nice presentation. My bowl had an egg, a lot of onions, and pork. Personally, I felt that the noodles itself was not fresh and it did not absorb the flavors very well. The pork was not special and it was basically fat. Overall, I felt that the noodle and pork did not join forces and become connected as one in flavor. I really hope that I came here on an off day. Despite my experience, I have to say that they are efficient here and the waitresses were nice and quick. If I happen to be in the area again and in the mood to wait, I will give this place a second chance. In the meantime, I am gonna stick to Santouka.

I normally, or used to more often back then, hang around Little Tokyo.  I always saw this place and always wanted to try it, but there is always a HUGE line to get in. After a day at Anime Expo, I decided to take my friend around Little Tokyo ( apparently she never explored here). We both were like we could eat but not that hungry, so I used her as an excuse to finally push myself to try this place.  No surprise that it took us 2 and a half hrs to get seated.  Once inside the place does seem a little cozy, small and a bit warm/ stuffy.  Personally when I saw the menu, I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't much to order but what else than to order the famous Daikokuya Ramen. I was amazed in the size of the bowl and the amount they give you.  The broth is full of flavor, the pork doesn't taste like the simple, cheap stuff, even the egg was that good.  I was able to finish most of it and wanted to finish my friend's cause she left a good amount, but I was too full.  I would be surprised if you can walk out of this place without a food coma. I would love to come back to this place, its just that I would have to come with someone. This way I don't suffer by myself the long wait.  Overall, I'm glad I was finally able to try this place out, very good experience. Just wish they had Curry!!!!

I decided to give Dikokuya a try after reading so many great reviews from other Yelpers,.  The vibe is awesome!  There's a chair in the middle of the restaurant right when you come in to put your name down.  Then you'll discover lots of unusual stuff..  Old funny Japanese movie posters, a fake bus-stop set up in the waiting area with weird signages and a TV playing some random channel.  Then when you glance to the top of the exit sign, there's a Godzilla together with some plastic baby-head toys.   Soon, you'll realized that this place is quite dirty as well.  Then you'll have to force yourself to look away from the grease of the table, and the thick dust on the curtains, and try not to notice that the waiters are just sweeping the left over food bites on the table directly to the floor.  You'll look away, and then all of a sudden, you are putting all the bites and pieces together in your mind: The kitchy Japanese background music, the unusual objects around, and the guy who's stirring something in the huge steel pot.  It makes you think if it's really the ramen broth they're cooking.  Eerie.....

What better than a bowl of piping hot ramen on a cold evening after the hardest Japanese test ever? Since my friend works in Downtown and we were at USC already, we popped over to Daikokuya for a little kotteri. While, yes, the wait was pretty horrendous, the staff was really awesome. We got seated at the counter. I looked around. It felt like I was back in Japan. Then we got a big bottle of Asahi and got to the task at hand. The ramen came out fairly quickly and looked AMAZING. All I really have to say is that this is the real deal. This is what ramen is supposed to taste like. The ingredients were fresh and the noodles were amazing. The soup isn't quite as good as Santouka (in Torrance) or Asa, but it really holds its own. The overall bowl was easily on par with those two places. Add in awesome atmosphere, a beer, and a friend... I am whisked back to Nippon. Oh, I miss it so. Great show! Gochisousama deshita!

One word for this place: OVERRATED. I decided to head to Little Tokyo for a Saturday afternoon lunch to finally see what the ramen hype was about. The wait? 1 hour. When I was finally seated in the small restaurant, I ordered the combination Daikoku Ramen which comes with an eel bowl (there are other meat choices btw). The food only took about 10 minutes to arrive, not bad. First they distract you with a creamy cabbage salad that I loved, really loved. Then comes the bowl, my eel bowl. That too was awesome. I slapped on a few mounds of ginger and it was perfect. Lastly, the ramen. Oh..it was a disappointment. The soup lacked distinctive flavor, but the texture of the noodles were pretty good. One warning, you leave the restaurant smelling like a grease party. Would I go back? Possibly. Only if there was absolutely no wait.

Nothing shakes me up as much as when I don't like something that everyone else loves. Do I lack the necessary ramen-appreciating-gene? The daikokuya ramen was okay, but it could never live up to the hype. Broth good (but not the smoky elixir my fellow yelpers had promised), strips of pork not as delicious as strips of good bacon or even crisp pork at a Chinese restaurant, the noodles were al-dente (which was the best part of the so-so dish). Like a child given an expensive whiskey, perhaps my palate isn't refined enough to appreciate the dish.  Maybe closing time on a Sunday is the wrong time to buy ramen.  Maybe I was just off.  Other than to try another dish (the rice bowl?) I cannot see myself coming back to Daikokuya.

nomnomnom I have been hearing a lot about this place. Usually she refrains from eating ramen but apparently her experience here was mind shattering enough to change her wayward ways. So I just had to check out the revelation in a bowl that they serve here. Came here with her and the family and though there was quite a wait, it sounded and appeared to be something worth waiting for. I'd probably feel a little less annoyed if it werent me waiting in the cold while the others waited in comfort. meh. But after getting seated and ordering enough food for a group twice our size.. bowls of ramen with extra side dishes of rice, pork, eggs and the lot.. I was surprised that everything was great! There wasnt a single thing that had a misstep. The flavors all mixed so well that I had to remind myself that it wasnt all mine. zomg! ;D

Another great ramen shop that gets filled quickly. Their shoyu-tonkotsu is one of the finest I've tasted. Their kurobuta chashu is delciously tender, it practically melts in your mouth. Their gyoza is definitely a must. Although I've read reviews about how their noodles can be better, I actually like the thicker eggy type they serve as opposed to the al dente hakata style. If you love ramen, you gotta hit this spot up. Parking may be hard to find, but the safest bet is the Japanese Village parking across the street, it might be a few bucks, but I'd rather not deal with the LA traffic.

OMG! I ate meat (well, meat juice. My GF ate my meat ((no innuendo intended)). Shhhh! I know I'm a pescetarian, but I'm starting to lean flexitarian. You heard right, flexitarian. God, I still feel guilty though... So, this review is written on a relative scale--it should be two stars. However, it retains three because it's probably the best in LA. But it does not come close to the real deal in Nipon (Japan for the uninitiated). I'm talking 102 year old obason (grandma) run, crazy-ass pressure cooker piping inches above your head, super rich, deep creamy broth. Stuff that only comes one way and makes you cry with pleasure. This is not that. But it's okay.

WHAT A LINE! I came here to eat some darn good ramen and pretty good ramen it was. I was surprised of the amount of customers this little place had and the craze focused look the cooks/ramen chefs portrayed. I must say, the Daikokuya's ramen is one of the best I've had thus far, along side Orochan's. I truly loved that you are able to have a combination of ramen with an unagi bowl and salad for less that $15! Whoa, that' a deal buster right there. I had barely made a dent to my delicious bowl of ramen (composed of a miso broth base, bean sprouts, chasu, nori, kamaboko, green onions, and a hard-boiled egg) when I became full and had to take the rest of my food home. Talk about a sweet deal of goodness! Super friendly staff, quick services once you are seated and fun atmosphere of happy people slurping away the goodness.

The most popular ramen restaurant in J-Town. The food here is pretty good, although I was hesitant to give it a 5 star because some stuff excelled while others were a little shortcoming. Plus, I've had better ramen in Japan. Nonetheless, the restaurant is still worthy of most of the hype. First off, the salad appetizer was pretty cheap. Shredded lettuce with thousand island dressing on top. The gyoza and pork bowl rice dishes were pretty good. As for the house special ramen, the soup is fantastic. Very very tasty as is the pork, which had very good texture. The quality of the noodles itself could've been better, but it's still passable. I really do love that soup broth. In all, I recommend this restaurant. The lines are long, but the food, both ramen and rice dishes, are pretty good.

Now I'm stuck. I now have two places of which I think have the best ramen in LA... I really enjoyed their specially ramen and the service was excellent. Wait time was a bit long though, so that was disappointing. I also have to add that the long wait time may have biased this review. I'll have to try it again when I'm not as hungry to compare. The price and the portion size adequately fits well and is very generous. I think I could eat this every day. But on the other hand If i DO have to wait 10^1000^290 billion hours.. I don't think I wouldn't be able to.. *sigh* sadness.... so, i'll have to ding them a star. Can LA have two great ramen places?.. sure, I it's LA its huge and its a melting pot of cultures, unfortunately Daikokuya is not my #1 Ramen place, but heck if the wait was shorter, maybe it would be. For sure I'm a fan when I can!!

The Ramen is crazy good!! BRING ON THE PORK BELLY!!! My current love interest is the Daikokuya Ramen and fried rice combo. Delicious. With an order of Pork Sausage and some of the ugliest, but tastiest gyoza I've ever seen..This ramen is tops here in So Cal. The place is pretty small and there will almost always be a wait, so if you are willing to, you will be rewarded with some of the best ramen you will ever have!! Just make sure when you finish eating, you jam. This is not the type of place to hang out post-meal and shoot the shizz. My pet peeve are peeps that know the line is super long and just sit, luxuriating over their half full warm Asahi. Beat it!!

So I'd been living here in WeHo for about a month. And I'd been feeling the pains of being without fresh, hot ramen (my Shaolin Supper). And being that I'm allergic to MSG, I couldn't even chase the dragon with the freeze-dried stuff from Chinatown. I was so sad and I felt this anger in my stomach that cried out, "WHY?" Every time I saw a Japanese person, or a Chinese person who had their hair parted down the middle, I'd say, "Hey you, where's there good ramen?" But no one had an answer. Some pointed me to questionable fast food chains...I was unimpressed and usually a bit scared. Thankfully, an acquaintance pointed me in the direction of Daikokuya by saying, "It's the best ramen I've ever had." I took that as a challenge so off we went immediately. After my Fu Lin restaurant in Seattle, it better be good or I was gonna noodle slap him and the chef. When we got there and saw the line, I got excited. If this many people were waiting in the streets, it had to be good. Some people were complaining, I was simply poised for noodling. That's right, I said it. Noodling: it's like spooning but with chopsticks too. Once we got the seats, I had the Diakoku Ramen. And you know what, it was really good. The noodles were cooked perfectly, the broth tastes like porkiness and the bean sprouts were crisp. Moreover, the hard-boiled egg they put in there, its yolk was still a little gooey. It was the best hard-boiled egg I've ever had...(and for scientific purposes, I've eaten there a number of times since to make sure the egg is always cooked so precisely) While not "...the best ramen I've ever had," it comes close. The place is legit, and all the staff have accents. The gyoza questionably amazing and the green tea is the absence of bitter. I've put this place on my list of regular spots. If your near, I suggest you do the same. Go there and tell 'em Moonshine sent you. Step up to get your rep up.

Let's get this out of the way really quick. I'm no Anthony Bourdain, (or however you spell his name) nor am I a food critic fancy-pants jack off. I don't go to exquisite places to "sample the specialties" or spend absurd amounts of money for something the size of a damn cookie that looks more like a 2nd grader's impression of the Galapagos Islands. In fact, I'm a person who doesn't flinch at eating at the same fast food stop for about a couple of weeks. I've done it before, I'll do it again. BUT!!!! But I WILL tell YOU that this place is extremely delicious. How delicious you may ask? Every time I have the chance to go here I TAKE IT! 45+ minutes in crappy, smoggy L.A. traffic trying to get there will not discourage me. The freezing cold weather and the 30+ waiting time outside the already packed place will not make me think twice. THAT GOOD. When I go, I ask for no green onions and bean sprouts because 1. I don't like onions and 2. I'm a REALLY PICKY EATER. Either way, I'm paying (not really, my sister usually forks over the cash hahaha) so they take my order how I want it. They haven't screwed up so that's another plus. The broth has the right amount of pork juice and salt and condiments. The noodles are plentiful and a good thickness. The Bamboo shoots are either pre-soaked or left to soak in the broth and have an interesting texture considering it's bamboo. It makes me realize why pandas eat the stuff all the time. The hardboiled egg is pretty tasty, cold and by itself or warm in my delicious hot broth. And the pork meat, aka chasu, aka DELICIOUS GOODNESS. When my sister first told me there was pork meat involved, I got iffy because usually when I think pork I think ham, which is kinda tough to eat sometimes. This stuff is NOTHING like ham. It practically melts in your mouth from how thin and soft and delicious it is. CAUTION: THIS MEAL WILL GIVE YOU A MEAN FOOD COMA. It's a lot to eat so be prepared to loosen your belt if you have one. Do yourself a favor. If you're in L.A. and want ramen, GO!

Good God, the ramen, the broth, the egg, even the thinly sliced pork (I'm not big on pork) - it's amazing. I've taken the mini road trip to get my fill, and it's helped out during the common cold. I don't stray from the only necessary meal here: the bowl of ramen. I add kotteri for a more savory flavor.  There's also the convenience of checking out the menu online (yeah, I forgot it was called kotteri), so don't hesitate to try. And little tokyo is a plus. There are little art shops, sanrio stores, mini markets, and of course, the man who plays a gazillion instruments at once, he's not to be ignored.

If you get here passed 7, expect to wait at least one hour. If you're a ramen lover, the wait is worth it. When you finally get in you notice the authentic Japanese atmosphere; just seeing actual Japanese people making Japanese ramen is always a good sign. Service is great, just like most Japanese places. They greet you when you enter, pretty fast with whatever you need, and greet you farewell when you leave. I ordered the original with the tempera combo. The salad that comes with it is pretty good - nothing special though, it's similar to most salads that Japanese restaurants will serve. The tempera though was really delicious. It was nice and crispy. Another is that it wasn't too oily. Furthermore it comes with a bowl of rice. The combo will definitely fill your stomach. As for the ramen, it was almost the best I've ver had. The noodles are soft and chewy, but not too soft where it has no consistency and just falls apart. The broth was even better. Just the way I like it, not too salty and full of savory flavor. A lot of ramen places will dump the salt/soy sauce in their broth - that's not something I'm fond of. Here though, I can definitely taste a more flavorful (pork flavor) broth that doesn't leave me begging for water. I also like to add the garlic from the little garlic holder on the table. The garlic really tops off the broth with flavor. It's nice that they have this out there for you to add. The pork was inside the ramen was nice and tender. Furthermore, the egg was perfect. The cooked the boiled egg so that the inside is still running and the egg white is super soft. I was super surprised by the effort they put even in the egg. Oh yeah, the bowl they give you is Huge. Well, it would be considered a Large at other places. Overall, one of the best ramen places I've ever had, the best I've had in socal so far. I just wish the line wasn't always so long or else I would come more often. Get a combo when you come here, it's worth the price.

I heard about this place from Jonar R. because he labeled this place the Pho Killer. and though i had doubts at first..... i must say..... "Tooshaaaaaaaay Dorko.....!!!" i actually went to this place during lunch yesterday and orderd the Ramen combo with the side of Unagi Rice Bowl. They first greeted us with cute smiles (women ofcourse) and seated us at the counter. We were scepticle at first due to they only had 1 style ramen. The daikokuya special ramen which had a description stating that the soup is cooked in pork, and the egg is marinated over night in their special sauce. we first got the salad and our drinks. the salad was shredded with a japanese version of thousand islands dressing but better. crisp and refreshing. then came the unagi. it was 3 pieces of grilled eel over rice and splashed with teriyaki sauce.... mmmmmm. this alone couldve filled me up. but then came a large bowl of the ramen. it was in a soy sauce base with 3 long chunks of pork, and the special marinated egg. YUUUMMMMY. it needed not any additional seasoning. i used to be a hardcore fan of orochan but with the selling price of $12.50 for this meal, i was POANED....!!!!!  they had me at the Sack with this meal. we loved it so much, my friend Daniel and i, recruited 2 more friends the same night and brought them back for dinner. hahahahaha lovely......!!!!! the place looks great too. i especially love the geisha surfboard and the japanese anime books.

Compared to Tajima in San Diego (which I think is the best ramen in San Diego), Daikokuya wins hands down. Apparently, if I remember correctly, I learned that the ramen is "tokyo style"  from a Japanese friend of mine where the ramen is a bit thicker than usual.  Also the ramen soup base is made with pork and the fat adds more of a robust and sweet flavor to it.  I heart pork. The pals and I went following a Clippers game to satiate our hunger.  Daikokuya was worth the wait.  While there were other ramen places open with no lines, there was a line into Daikokuya.  We waited 45 minutes.  LOL Then, I forgot the word, but you can order more ramen if you have left over broth.  It only costs $1!!!  Apparently, T (Japanese friend) said that not all ramen houses have this option.  I felt lucky and fat and full. I slept well that night.

The ramen is oh so good with the bamboo, green onion, sprouts and the fatty pork, hmmmmm fatty pork.  One of the best places for ramen around and though you have to wait, its definitely worth it!  Feeling a little hungry?  Get a combo with your choice of rice bowls ranging from eel bowls to katsu-don for just a few bucks more.  You get a little salad with your combo idea that is tasty and refreshing and a perfect start to a wonderful meal.   I've had Shin Zen Gummi, Orochon, Nippon, Santouka and those are good places but if I had to choose I think Daikokuya would always end up on top.  Don't hate the place, people have their own opinions but you should at least give the place a try.  Chances are, you'll be coming back, I know I always do.

This is by far my favorite ramen shop. It's just not a ramen shop either, their rice dishes are amazing too. My recommendation would be to get one of the ramen combos. You get a bowl of the Daikokuya Ramen, a great salad, and then your choice of a rice dish (Pork Cutlet, Fried Rice, Tempura, Grilled Eel...). I would recommend eating the ramen first because I could only image how terrible the noodles would be eating it the next day. The rice would be a lot more transportable and makes a great afternoon/midnight snack. My only warning to first timers is that if you go during lunch or dinner, don't expect to wait anything less than an hour. Large groups, expect to wait even longer. One more thing is that on Sundays they are open until they run out of soup. This has happend to me before and they have closed at 7:30. It was a sad day.

Uhh, oh crap. This was really freaking good. Now where can I get this in San Francisco? Katana-ya is good, but this is exquisite -- basically, everything in this place is flavored with good old fashioned PORK FAT! The broth, the fried rice -- it all has that rich pork taste that you can't get any other way. I also notice that this place doesn't lay on the MSG in their broth -- if there is any umami, it's naturally occurring by the way they cook the broth. I love, love, love the tender pork slices and was very sad when they were gone. Prices are good, too, but I'm definitely preaching to the choir. There's going to be a ramen bowl-sized hole in my soul when I go back to SF. :(

I'm a fan! I love love love japanese food. Hell, I love food in general, but this place was pretty legit.  The wait was insanely long, which wasn't so fun... but the food was delicious.  There are a variety of things that you can order, but I ordered the most famous one.. the Daikokuya ramen.   The broth was hot and flavorful and there was a generous amount of noodles and pork.  Because I was ridiculously hungry from the insanely long wait, I ordered the combination with fried rice.  Their fried rice was delicious; light and fluffy with vegetable and pickled ginger on the side. Unfortunately, i couldn't finish my meal... but that food coma that I suffered afterwards was well worth it. I would drop someone off, sign in, and then park.. walk around.. and check in 30 minutes later.

Ooooh Daikokuya.  Where do I even begin.  I dream (and drool) about you when I am awake, no lie. My friends and I discovered this place a couple years back and let me tell you, even though we went to school an hour away by train and had to walk for half an hour to get to Little Tokyo, just the thought of Daikokuya's AMAZING ramen was enough to get us on the train.  Why is this the best ramen I've had to date?  Well, let's see...  It may be that huge bowl of delish soup that the ramen comes in.  Or it could be those yummy slices of incredibly tender and tasty pork.  Can't forget that egg that's soaked in a special sauce overnight either--the effect of which is a tender outside and a golden orange center that is magical.  Oh who am I kidding--I love it all!!!  If you love the pork, you can order a whole order of it *drools*  I believe it's listed under Appetizers. So the bottom line is, COME HERE!  The long line (it can be avoided if you come just as they open!) may deter some people but hey, if it's got that many people lining up for it, then you know it's well worth it.

Ha!  Well, seeing as this is the 506th review and the place retains a solid 4 stars, there shouldn't be much else to add.....so, bullet points it is! *Elbow your way through the crowd and find the beaten up clipboard sitting on a chair, quickly enter your name and party size!  First available seating is the way to go....only a few booths and a small bar...expect to wait. *ONLY get a bowl of ramen.  Don't be tempted by larger combos with appetizers, it's just too much food, fatty!  Sorry, I take back the "fatty" comment.  Anywho, ramen's all you need. *I dare you to find street parking.  So, don't be an overachiever and just pay a few bucks to park at the lots across the street.

Stop #2 on The Ramen World Tour: Let's just say I'm hoping the successive stops will increase in quality or this will be one long tour.  Not that the ramen isn't good but there were trivial little pieces to it I didn't like.  The dashi is good but there was barely enough of it to cover my noodles and what little there was became marred by the mound of raw green onions that land slided down into every corner of my bowl.  The flavors of the broth were just too delicate to have that many onions overpowering the subtlety (plus they do nothing for my social life).  The char shiu had good flavor but I felt as though I had gotten only the leftover bits and the whole hard boiled egg was soft boiled in the middle because the soup wasn't hot enough.  I love shoga on my ramen but don't love that the shoga is left in a tiny jar on the table. Just seems unsanitary. Ramen on a drizzly day was a perfect idea, even if not the perfect ramen, and the company was quite lovely so I won't complain anymore. This place is only a hop, skip and a jump away from my work, but I'll make the extra effort to go to Orochon...which by the way is stop #3.

Nothing sounded better than a steaming hot bowl of pho after a hilarious performance of Avenue Q at the Ahmanson. Since pho was closed, we visited what some consider the holy grail of ramen in Los Angeles, Little Tokyo's Daikokuya. The JPop-vintage paraphenilia was complemented by a spattering of alternative LA hipsters and normal people keeping their cool. A refreshing departure from the traditional and a little raw on the edges. I was surprised that there were only two ramens offered amongst a menu mostly of rice dishes, so of course we opted for the Daikoku Ramen combo with chicken-egg rice. The broth was salty, mellow, and cloudy in appearance--exactly what I was looking for in a late-night snack.  The noodles were thick and chewy and of course, you can never go wrong with an egg.  Overall, the ramen was very satisfying and though I wouldn't be that quick to call it the best, it sure was damn good.  The chicken-egg bowl didn't fare too badly either.

Holy shit, this place already has 268 reviews. Well, here is the 269th one and I'll keep it short because I doubt anyone will care. And wouldn't it be more excited if I absolutely hated this place? I'd have like tons more to write about....but I don't. So here goes: a solidly satisfying bowl of ramen. Almost worth the 30-40 minute wait on a Friday night, but I heart ramen and ramen hearts me. If you're obsessed with trying the Japanese noodle bowls, then you HAVE to come try this shop. If you ordered something else and wasn't very happy with it, then that's your own fault. It's like ordering a salad at McDonald's, you weirdo.

Geez, 704 reviews?1?   Better make this quick.  Daikokuya's a little like Pink's--overrated and rated by people who's never had ramen before.  The broth is inconsistent--good when it's done right; average at best when not.   Even the temperature consistency of the soup is uneven.  Will never wait in this crazy line unless an out-of-towner insists.

Came here with Tina C to have closure on our relationship.  Too many details to write nor the right forum. At the suggestion of Tina C I parked across the street in the mall parking.  The most expensive out of any place near Daikokuya.  She did it purposely I think.  Too many details, let's move on with the review. Ordered ramen with fried rice.  Tina order ramen and side of gyoza.  Honestly I had better fried rice and gyoza before.  As for the ramen, it rocked.  The broth I thought was just perfect.  Not too salty but very flavorful.  Second, the noodle was cooked to perfection, firm.  Lastly, the pork was awesome.  Just melted in my mouth.   Not sure about cleanliness but that is a different story.  I will come back soon.  Not with Tina and I will probably find cheaper parking.

ok, it's actually 4.5 stars. This is a hole in the wall eatery.  Very limited seating with worn out chairs  (I mean literally worn out - torn).  Nevertheless, this still commands a long wait and I would gladly do it.  Ramen is very very good but for a ramen-ya, it sure lacks variety.  Only 2 types of ramen.  1 soup base.  I love this broth but my husband prefers Miso (I seriously don't understand why anyone would like miso over this but that's his prerogative).  So here goes my review. 1) Chicken Kaarage - Good but not anything that would stand out. 2) Daikoku Ramen - i) Broth is fantastic.  A little salty but very creamy, rich and flavorful.  This really is my favourite broth in the US.  It is so memorable that everytime I come to LA, I MUST eat here at least once.  If I can eat it everyday, even better.  That's how good it is! (though I think I would probably die from clogged arteries or high sodium intake first). ii) Noodles - Good.  Texture could be a little firmer. iii) Egg - Very good.  Just the way I like mine.  Cook but not too cook (if you know what I mean).  Goes perfect with the broth. 3) Pork Cutlet bowl (part of the Ramen as a set) -  Very good.  just nice portion for a 3 - 7 year old. Overall, decent selection of appetizers and other non ramen dishes.  Be prepared to wait an hour or more even at off peak hours ( 2 - 3 pm in the afternoon).  I think the owners should change the seats.  Seating on torn seats with "0" spring support is not comfortable at all but I guess I would brave the discomfort just to eat my favorite ramen. (Just a note, this meal was back in Jan 2012).

The pork over rice is the reason why I have given Daikokuya 5 stars.  I could not get enough of it.  It is just the perfect balance of onions, pork, rice, sauce, and ginger.  I am literally craving it right now as I write this review.  Only bad thing about this place is that during the summer, it can get really hot, especially when sitting at the bar. I keep telling myself that I will try the ramen next time, but I know for fact that I won't.  I'll just end up getting the pork over rice.  Good night.

Definitely another OVERRATED place. I've heard so many people ranting and raving about this place so we had to try it out. Of course, being that it was L.A. we had to pay for parking and walk a good distance from the lot to the restaurant. There was a big crowd outside the restaurant and we thought, "Whoa, the food here must be off the chain." to have that many people standing outside in the COLD. I had 2 sweaters on and I was shivering my ass off. The sidewalk was pretty crowded so we decided to walk across the street to a nearby plaza since they told us the wait time could be up to an hour. Usually, we'd just leave if the wait time is more than 20 minutes but we were already there, paid for parking, nothing to do, nowhere to go anyway and the massive crowd intrigued us even more to try this place at least once. There were 32 names ahead of us. We were #33. Thank god there was a mini shopping plaza where we were able to kill time because I honestly don't think we would have made it as long as we did standing out there in the cold with bums approaching us for chump change every now and then. We finally got in after what seemed like 2 whole hours and the host/server (tall hapa looking guy sporting a long pony tail and bald top with a funny voice) got to us immediately. He was awesome but I have to admit... he got us giggling off our cold butts (you'll know what I'm talking about if you eat there - very nice guy, though). Anyway, I had their "famous" ramen and fried rice combo. My partner had their pork bowl combo. I have to say, I loved the pork bowl more than the ramen and fried rice. Once again, so OVERRATED! In fact, the Japanese side salad that came with the meal was the best tasting item of the night! I was disappointed with the ramen and fried rice. The pork bowl was pretty good and we would probably get that again if we don't have to wait in line for so long. By the way, they don't do "take-out". Isn't that some sh**?! Well, that's fine because we'd rather drive all the way down to Costa Mesa and eat at their other chain restaurant where there is absolutely NO wait / NO long lines / plenty of FREE parking space / plenty of places to sit inside their CLEAN lit food court  located inside the Marukai supermarket. I can honestly just order their salad and eat it alone as it is with nothing else. Their salad is BOMB! I gave this place 3 stars on OVERALL food and experience.

I'm completely sold.  It lived up to the hype.   After eating what I thought was almost the best ramen in the Bay Area, I come to Los Angeles to eat at this restaurant.  I never thought I'd wait for an hour to eat a bowl of ramen and fried rice, but then again, I never thought my idea of ramen can be better than what I've experienced. It had the perfect combination of noodles, delicious soup, tender pork, and affordable price that I've been looking for, for so long.   It's a shame that I don't live in the area or have a comparable ramen house locally that I can enjoy.   No matter how much I'd hate to crown my coveted "best ramen house" award to a place in southern california, here's to you, Daikokuya.  You blew my mind.

Hubby has been on a ramen crazed and decided to drive all the way to J-Town so I can try the ramen at Diakokuya. When we arrived, the wait wasn't as bad as I thought because the last time we passed by, there were a lot of people. I waiting for about 10 minutes before we were seated. I ordered the house special ramen which includes two pieces of pork and a boiled egg. The broth was light, and the noodles were just right. I actually ate the tender pork and it was very flavoraful. I usually give the pork to hubby but I wanted to try it this time and to my surprised, I liked it. It wasn't at all fatty like I thought it would be. The egg was cooked perfectly with a little still wet in the yolk. I agree, the ramen is good, and it taste better than the one in Costa Mesa but not sure if I will drive through the LA traffic for it. I guess, I am just a simple Ramen Girl who can just eat any ramen and still be satisfy.

I was never a fan of ramen until i came to Daikokuya! The broth was to die for!  It had a very distinct taste of sesame which i loved.  The noodles were just right - not too soft, not too firm.  The pork was sooo tender and the soy sauce egg made for a perfect addition.  I did think the ramen could've used a few more pieces of pork but other than that, it was pure perfection!   Next time, I come to LA, this will be my "must-go" eating spot... that and father's office plus daily indulgences of Pinkberry.

Daikokuya; possibly a teensy weensy bit over-rated. Okay, so I've only been to this hot spot once, and tried the noodles. Uh.. not a lot of variety in terms of choices of noodles, but we tried them. Isn't it what made the place famous? It was..adequate. Okay, so I've only been once, but I'm judgemental and for now I say "no!" especially given you have to stand like an idiot for XXX hrs before you get seated. But I'll give it another try some other time.

I give Daikokuya 3 stars because the taste has definitely gone down in the past few months. :( Boo!! Their signature ramen is a pork based soup, more oily and thicker than Orochon's ramen. (if you've eaten there before) They have pretty friendly portions and you can ask for more noodles (not sure if they still do that.) During the summer they have hiyashi chuuka which is a cold dish consisting of ramen noodles, ham, tomatoes, cucumbers in your choice of sesame or soy sauce. I prefer soy sauce! yum! Another recommendation is their Katsu-don (fried pork/chicken cutlet over rice) I think I would rather get that now than the ramen. *sigh* someone recommend me a good ramen place in LA! I'm not finding any!!

This is the kind of place that explains why Instant Ramen costs 10 cents - real ramen is worth its weight in gold, and this place definitely serves real ramen.   Yet you only have to pay 700 copper pennies for a huge bowl of great ramen - what a steal! Went there on a weekday at 12:30pm and had all of a 3 minute wait. It had a good enough crowd to reinforce its reputation as a good spot, yet not so overcrowded, at least today, that you get irritated waiting.  Ordering is quick and easy since they just have one ramen bowl to choose from - the GOOD one.   :) The food was served in less than 5 minutes, and the noodles were perfectly cooked, flavor was delicate and delicious, pork not too fatty, soup not overly oily, but I agree w/another reviewer that it was a tad bit much with all the chopped green onions.  Nonetheless, definitely some of the best ramen I've had in a while. I'd almost say 5 stars since it's such a great deal for the quantity and quality of food, if not for the little mini cockroach that showed up on the wall next to our booth towards the end of our meal.   A tad unsettling, especially since my husband was a restaurant health inspector for 10 years and I've heard my share of horror stories from him. But hey, isn't it always the "holes in the wall" that serve the greatest tasting food anyhow? All in all, I recommend this place and would still go back, mini cockroach and all. If you can't find street parking, I'd recommend parking across the street in the Japanese Village Plaza parking structure.  $1.25 every 20 minutes.  Not cheap, but better than the $3 / 20min at other parking spots. **OH, and I almost forgot to mention - definitely check out their website b/c you can find online coupons there!  Too bad I left the ones I printed out in my car.  But what a great excuse to go back...

I never knew ramen, I mean really knew ramen, until tonight, when I went to Daikokuya. The broth is outstanding, and chock full of slow-cooked porky goodness. It's rich, flavorful, but also very subtle. There's a lot going on there, and sipping broth after all my noodles were gone was about as good as eating everything together. The noodles were cooked perfectly, not soupy from having absorbed too much liquid, or hard from being undercooked. They had that perfect bite to them. The pork, possibly made using divine secrets from culinary gods, quite literally melted in my mouth. The only thing I would have changed from the noodle dish was ask for the bean sprouts on the side. I like them raw, acting as more of a palate cleanser. Growing up my mom used them to stretch meals, and I really can't stand the taste of them cooked anymore. However, if you dig on the sprouts like in pho, they really infuse the whole dish with a light taste, almost on the edge of perception. The gyoza are excellent, and are probably the best I've had anywhere. They are fried just right with an excellent filling, and lots of wonderful, crunchy, green onions. I ordered the house bowl, with the pork cutlet side (a combo bowl, on the menu's last page). The tonkatsu was wonderful, with the breading really sticking to the meat, rather than coming off in places. It sits on a bed of rice, sauce, and onions, with an egg cooked over everyone. It made me long for breakfasts back at my parent's house. The combination of rice, fried eggs, bacon, and vinegar/hot sauce is deadly one, that everyone should try and this is a great variation on it. A bit of advice before I end this extraordinarily long review, we got there, and waited around forty minutes. Make sure you put your name down on the list by the door, and remember your number. It's a small shop, so while the booths are preferable, be prepared to settle for the bar. You'll eat sooner. Finally, keep an eye on the other folks there. We're pretty sure that some of our fellow patrons were dishonest, and snaked reservations that other people put down. You know who you are. You've brought shame upon this ramen shop. You have forgotten the face of your father.

There's only two places in Cali that get the "Han Kook" five star from JP.  It's like the "Michelin" stars, but the Korean version.  Five emphatic "Han Kook's" from this gook to Daikokuya. I watched as the noodle patrol were precise w/ the timing.  Beautiful. I really didn't think I was gonna find a ramen in LA that I liked as much as Santouka's shio, but live n learn.  live n learn.

I had the ramen at Daikokuya only once before, and have been meaning to find a reason to go back..and jury duty was it! :)   I get lost around downtown very easily, so I need the gps on in unexplored territory..  Following people around is even better (human gps's)!  After waiting forever for lunchtime in the crowded jury hall, my two newly befriended jurors and I went to Little Tokyo! On weekdays, the line to eat delicious ramen is a lot shorter.  On Tuesday, during the lunch hours, it took about 20 minutes for a table of three, and I think generally 5-10 minutes for a table of one. I had the Daikokuya ramen, a murky broth of pork belly, a (perfect) half-boiled egg , and a sprinkle of veggies (erm, look at Dave's description haha). :)  You can order it already in the soup, or on a separate plate.  The noodles were a good consistency, elastic and chewy.   Compared to Shin-Sen-Gumi, I believe that Shin-Sen-Gumi wins out on the broth, as there appears to be a richer taste.  I guess the pork belly could be a bit more tender.. :) The half-boiled egg is my favorite..     Although..space is quite limited, the interior design is really interesting, vintage Japanese items everywhere!  The service is prompt and efficient.  Cute girls!

Ramen broth made at an seceret undisclosed location. Kinda cool, but kinda scary too. You never know if its legit or if its some sumo wrestler making ramen juice after a sweaty sparring session. But either way, Daikokuya was great. All of us had the ramen with pork and seems like all of us liked it. Some of us got the combo with ramen and chicken/egg bowl. Its as good as it gets. The only downfall was the wait and tiny dining area. Our party had to split in order for us to be seated earlier.

I first went here on a rainy rainy downtown day with a workmate for lunch. The tiny storefront was PACKED with diners waiting for a table or counter stool. We both got the standard ramen with pork and, boy was it DE-LISH-ISSSSSSS! I understood immediately why we had to wait. The pork slices are insanely tender and the ramen noodles cooked to perfection. If you add some of the spicy sauce, it's heaven in a bowl. Just what I was looking for on a dreary, besoaked afternoon. I would give this place 5 stars, but the lunch wait can be upwards of 1/2 hour. While it's worth it, it does take a chunk out of your lunch hour.

DaiKOHkuya? DAIkoKOOya! Daiiiikukukukoku!! Kookukookaah!! So the long waiting period before being seated provided us much time to successfully find plenty of ways to butcher the word "Daikokuya." But totally worth the wait. Right when you walk into this place, you KNOW it's gonna be good. Your ramen spidey senses tingle in anticipation. Any food item that stands alone in its kind on the menu, paired with a juicy, paragraph-long description is probably gonna be pretty awesome. Possum. Being somewhat of a rameniac (word conglomeration credited to Jon!), I have embarked on a lengthy and rather unfruitful search for good ramen in LA. However, the creamy broth + tasty pork + tasty noodles + tasty egg has allowed my search... to come to an end. **haaaaaaaa** (lellujah) Also, my hair smelled like pork the rest of the night. Best.

OMG, maybe I'm just a fatty, but you have GOT to eat the kotterri ramen.  It has so much flavor and sure I felt guilty eating it, but it's just so flavorful!  The most perfectly boiled egg you'll ever see at a ramen place.  It has that balance of being hard/soft boiled.  Yum.  Ramen was cooked perfectly.  We ordered extra cha-siu, best decision ever.  They give you a lot and it's SO Soft!!!  Everyone else's dishes looked really good too!  It was so much that I couldn't finish it, but it was still good the next day.  A definite plus! Yeah, you have to wait a bit to get a seat, but there's also yaohan plaza to walk around while you wait.  There's public parking right across the street for $4 after 4PM M-F and $4 all day Sa-Su.  Service was wonderful and they sure work hard.  I've been to a LOT of ramen places and this is my favorite.  Even better than Shinsengumi in OC and that's saying a lot.

It is indeed awesome ramen. Part of what makes it taste so good is that they make  you wait for it....most of the time. I had the misfortune of going yesterday (on a Thursday at lunch) when school was out, thinking that a party of one could get seated at the bar faster. Not so fast: legions of families were eating up what little table room they had. I watched parties of 9 and 12 swallow half the seating and had to sit there for 90 minutes. My name was next on the list, with a two-top open at the bar, and I had to confront the host about letting me eat because my meter was gonna die in 30 more minutes. Bottom line: These guys have multiple locations, and there's plenty of real estate for rent in Little Tokyo. They are doing a disservice to their patrons by not having a bigger space, and losing money by having people disappear from the long wait. Lesson Learned: Go there in groups, they want fast money/service and have made more $ doing so. If you want to go alone, head around the corner to Orochon Ramen, which will seat almost immediately, has plentiful/outdoor seating and is *almost* as tasty.

Everyone's palate is different and therefore ramen loyalties are scattered throughout the LA area.  My mouth lies with Shin Sen Gumi, but my good friend prefers Daikokuya...so i had to try for myself. Disclaimer: I've only been once and it was a while ago.  I will update this when i have the chance to go back. (ive since gone back 9/28/09) Dominus Ramenus Points: + the noodles are fantastic! perfect texture + base is good, not overly fatty or oily, and the taste is.. there... + portions are GENEROUS! i mean, there was so much left after i satiated my normally insatiable hunger + their lunch specials are a great deal. ramen plus side (fried rice, gyoza, etc) + in 'n out -esque menu with only 1 ramen choice but many sides + small and quaint but service is speedy and servers are warm / friendly + lots of other ramen stores nearby (if ur in a rush), but if you're already there, why not just wait to eat here... + also tons of little shops to mosey into while ur waiting - NO PARKING!  parking is such a pain, but ive found u can just park in the safeway lot nearby o.O - it is a small place so expect to wait, ive waited over an hour before but ive also been lucky enough to wait 10 minutes - their AC is like broken or something so its hot as a mother father - bowls are ginormatoid, making it easy to access all the goods and get a nice soup to noodle ratio per spoonful - yogurtland nearby so you can get dessert after! - the meat is a little on the fatty side, so beware... - the soup base is...just not all that memorable, doesnt contain the 'wow' factor that ramen should have OVERALL i think daikokuya is really good and definitely one of the best i've had.  i will be back to partake in it's wares but if im closer to santouka, i will opt to go there.

I love, love, love....Daikokuya. After sampling Mr. Ramen (right next door to Daikokuya), Orochan & Kouraku (J-Town), Foo Foo Tei (Monterey Park), Shin Sen Gumi (Rosemead) and I can say that nothing really compares to Daikokuya. The quality of their pork broth, density of their noodles, tender pork slices and bamboo shoots and has got me hooked. I  also like how they add a lot of chopped green onions. My 2nd favorite dish is the shredded pork bowl. AHHH. It's hard to describe its tender goodness. Sometimes I crave it. Despite the 45-60 minute wait time and raised prices -- I am a committed patron.

Hands down best ramen in LA in terms of the noodle, pork and broth.   If you are really hungry, order combo which comes with a small salad and a rice bowl of your choice.  I don't recommend tuna sashimi bowl or salmon egg bowl since they are ramen joint!  However their fried rice is really good.  Their pork helped alot in terms of enhancing flavors. I don't think I need to address how good their ramen is. Order Kotteri flavor to enhance the overall taste of the ramen.  Add minced garlic if you like it!

Ugh.... the hype.... who knows.... is it because they make your ass wait for over an hour before you can satisfy your hungry stomach? What is it? Broth is the best part of the ramen. The ramen noodles were bleh.  I've tasted better, and fresh elsewhere. Their gyoza was very, very good.   Service was quick.  Staff were polite. I will never wait this long again for your ramen...

i've been here twice, the first time i did not know what to expect and i really did not like it, maybe because i was not feeling well that day, but i did not like the taste of the ramen AT ALL But, i decided to give it a second try, and WOW it was amazing i cannot stop raving about it. the orochon ramen is just perfect, beyond it maybe but it was so tasty and the noodles were perfect al dente. we shared the combination with the small fried rice and it was the BEST FRIED RICE i have ever had, i just wanted more and more. oh and of course we had to get their famous gyoza which were delicious and you can taste how fresh they are. i am so glad i gave this place a second try if i didn't i would have missed out on so much. but you will become addicted and crave it all the time. the lines are about 2 hours long but worth every second! ramen, rice, gyoza and some ice cold sapporo and you are set.

Went here yesterday for the first time on a rainy day. What a treat: what flavor, what satisfaction. The egg, the pork strips, the diced vegetables, the noodles and the broth was something else. The only drawback for me was the crud everywhere.  Place needs a serious steam clean from top to bottom.

I just realized that going out for ramen is pretty irrational when bags of it are extremely cheap in the grocery store. But I justify going to get ramen by believing that it will be higher quality, fresh, and make me feel like a manga or anime character or something like that. After all of the hype about this place, I thought it was just an average meal that didn't really stand out- maybe because I didn't order kotteri, but it definitely wasn't worth the hour and 20 minute wait that I endured to sit a bar and eat a bowl of noodles. After waiting for over an hour on a Friday night, I was expecting these noodles to be amazing. My friends and I ordered and got our food pretty fast, but sadly my taste buds were disappointed. The broth is good and rich, but the noodles were plain, the pork was gross, and the egg was bland. The meal is a good deal cause I got the combo and got an extra rice and chicken plate to take home, but I'd rather have quality over quantity if I'm eating out for ramen. This restaurant has only 5-7 tables and a bar and doesn't take reservations. In my opinion, the wait wasn't worth it and the ramen wasn't life changing and definitely didn't live up to its hype. Santouka in Culver is wayyyy better, and I don't think I'll be driving downtown to this hole-in-the-wall.

Came in here for lunch yesterday because of the reviews here...I think it might be the Santa Ramen (in San Mateo) of LA and being a fan of Santa Ramen, I had to go here finally. Luckily I went at a good time because there were people leaving (though the place was full) and since I was dining all by my lonesome, I was seated quickly at the bar area (and score for parking right in front the entrance!) i ordered a bowl of their Daikokuya ramen...there's only one type and no menu for add-ons like kimchi, so I just hoped for the best. The broth was lovely--it was rich, creamy and tasted like it had been cooking for days. The pork was buttery and melt in your mouth (I usually never eat the sliced pork that I get in ramen unless I specifically order a pork ramen) because it had fat in it...mmmmm I liked the whole boiled egg that comes with the soup..it was soft boiled so I got the taste the yolky goodness. The noodles were perfectly chewy. Sad to say, but that was the last time I was able to taste food because after that, my sickness has evolved into a full-blown mess. I wouldn't mind coming back, I just hate that it's so far away (I'm usually never in downtown LA).

It's places like Daikokuya that makes me sometimes wish I lived in L.A.  I wanted the best Ramen in L.A., and this place did not fail to impress.  I only wished I saved the best for last, because the ramen here just out paces everywhere else.   Always crowded, its best to come during off hours.  We came for dinner on my first visit.  Our wait only took 30 minutes... not bad at all.  By the way, don't come with a group.  It's already small, bad enough to find a table for parties of 5 or more. They have only one kinda of ramen: Pork tonkotsu (pork bones) soup, egg noodles, pork belly chashu, marinated boiled egg, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, green onions and sprinkled sesame seeds.  You can have it the conventional way (all together in a large bowl) or every ingredient separated (noodles are cold, broth still hot).  Other then that... that's it.  They have other items on the menu... then again, who the hell cares?   Since it was cold outside I ordered Ramen (conventional way) and fried rice (egg, corn, imitation crab, and chopped  pork with rice).  My girlfriend ordered a combo (Ramen plus a pork cutlet bowl) for $12.  My fried rice came out first; so hungry I scarfed down halfway through the plate.  BIG MISTAKE!  When that bowl of ramen came out, geez it was a huge.  I should have never ordered the rice (rice was okay), this bowl would more then filled me up.  First slurp of the thick broth... WOW, rich intense pork flavor just scintillating my mouth!  Pork belly was soooo tender!  Egg noodles were nicely firm and springy.  I feared I wouldn't finish at first, but 8 minutes later... all my fears were gone.  I was fishing for more noodles after I was done, even though my gut was busting through the seams.  Once settled, I felt warm and fuzzy all over!   I've tried other Ramen stalls in L.A., and I have to say...  Daikokuya is the best.  Weelll, the best in LA!  Even though their other dishes are average... people come here for one thing.  That's why I give 5 stars for the ramen only!  Now for their customer service... their response would probably be, "huh, what's that!?"

I would give this place 5 stars but my first love affair with ramen was Santouka Ramen in Costa Mesa...so i feel a bit guilty.   After moving to the LA area from the suburban bubble we know as OC,  I often craved the savory goodness of Santouka Ramen.  Which led the trek to finding a ramen shop that can recreate that instantaneous moment of when i first fell in love.  All failed....except one.  Had i discovered Daikokuya first than maybe i would've given it 5 stars and all my ramen adventures would surely be compared to the latter.

Visited Daikokuya on one of my LA adventures.  I was staying at a hotel right across the street.  I will always remember this place for the best Japanese Pork Ramen I've ever had!  I dream about this place.   Unfortunately, I've never been to Japan so I can't compare to the ramen there but I love ramen and I've had it in many places in the US and this place is tops.  LA Yelpers may be a little spoiled giving this place a bad review because believe me when I say that you can not find a place with this high caliber of ramen in Boston or NYC because I have looked.  In fact, I made it my personal mission when I came back here to the East Coast to find better ramen but could not.   The broth is just delicious in all it's porky glory, noodles tender but not overcooked, ingredients (egg and pork) are marinated to perfection.  I believe it says on the menu that they take a whole day to boil their broth.   The interior is pretty small with booths and counter seating sort of like a diner.  A lot of japanese posters and trinkets to remind you of the nationality of food you are eating.  Some Yelpers do not seem to think very highly of the cleanliness here but I was only here once and I thought it was ok for casual dining.   I will definitely come back if I'm ever in the area again.

... Silence. Roughly 8 minutes and 53 seconds later, my cousin Ron emerges from his bowl unscathed.  No trace of his meal was to be found on his end of the table like a crime scene unsolved. "Dang!  You were really hungry!"  We yell in unison. A little voice inside whispers, "ramen" and stockpiles on your craving until you can't take it anymore and you have to travel 47 miles (55 minutes or an hour and a half in traffic) just to satiate the beast within. It's the same amount of time and distance from Fontana if we were to go to their Costa Mesa location (2975 Harbor Blvd.), except that it closes at 7:00 PM every day.   F Costa Mesa then, and the rain!  We want ramen now!  If you want to know, it took us only 40 minutes to get to Little Tokyo.  That's how bad we wanted it.  We tried downplaying the hype, but it was too late and fortunately, it quelled the beast within us.   They only have one type of ramen - Daikoku - and the other - Tsukumen -has the ingredients separated.  I ordered the richer kotteri Daikoku, which had more extracted back fat in its broth.  It was tasty, but with the history of high blood pressure in my family, it was dangerously tasty. Each of us independently agreed that this was some damn good soup.  My brother just thought that Ramen Setagaya in New York was better.  I told him that Daikokuya was good in its own right and that Setagaya had a clearer broth - making it incomparable in my opinion. Those silky noodles belong in that soup.  That creamy, fatty, complex-flavored broth hit the spot.  Bamboo shoots, chopped green onions, bean sprouts, marinated egg, and that pork melts in your mouth like butter. For $8.50 a bowl, it beats New York ramen prices, which typically run $10 - $15+.  You get an excellent deal in this L.A. establishment and you get a heaping serving of noodles to boot; verrrrry reasonable. Gyoza had that indescribable Asian flavor to it - umami?  It was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  It was shaped like an enchilada.  It's much better than most ramen shops in New York don't have it this good.  Don't even think about salivating. Their tempura had a clean bite to it and didn't leave any unwanted residue in my mouth.  It was tasty and I marvelled at why the L.A. County Department of Public Health would give the facility a B grading.  Recount! While you wait, enjoy their complete line of Naruto manga on the shelf and their vintage Japanese posters, signs and ads.  You'll be glad you did...especially if you can read in Japanese. The staff was super friendly and wanted to accommodate the six of us the best they could in spite of the cramped quarters and limited seating. Their booths are built for four, but they have a ramen bar for you loners and lovebirds out there.   Like the tender, melt-in-your mouth kurobota pork they serve, it tenderized and melted its way into my heart - literally and figuratively.

Just to preface, If I hadn't gone to other ramen establishments prior to Daikokuya, I probably would've been inclined to give it a higher rating. So while it only receives 3 stars from me, maybe it's more a victim of circumstance rather than a sub-par eatery (though the fact that it ranks relatively low compared to other places I've been may speak to the seemingly high standards set by SoCal ramen houses...standards Daikokuya doesn't really meet). Anyway, my roommate and I arrived just barely an hour before closing on a weeknight, and the place was STILL packed like Kim Kardashian's sweatpants. A 30 minute wait at 11:00pm has GOT to be a promising sign of quality eats, right? I mean, I thought we were crazy for putting something so heavy in our stomachs so close to bedtime--food coma aside, tossing and turning with a tummy full of bubbling salty juice doesn't make me excited for the morning after--but based on attendance alone Daikokuya has GOT be worth any midnight stomach ache, right?? Eh, not exactly. I ordered the Daikoku Ramen Combination, which comes with a salad (definitely tasted like it came straight from a Big Mac) and your choice of another side. I got the pork cutlet, and while they gave me a sizable portion, as Travis I. said previously, they doused it with a dose of egg and something that did NOT seem like a legit tonkatsu sauce, which just made the whole thing soggy and unappetizing. And what about the RAMEN? The noodles were decent, but something about the broth was definitely dissatisfying. Personally, I thought it was a bit too lite, as I usually like my ramen broth to straight up attack my mouth upon entry rather than smoothly slide its way in unannounced, but maybe I've just spoiled by bolder tastes. Daikokuya must be doing something right, though, for it seems like they attract large crowds on a regular basis, so if you're down with soggy tonkatsu and watery broth, hit it up! Otherwise, check out Hakata Shinsengumi (if Gardena isn't too far for you) or Santouka. While I wouldn't mind returning to Daikokuya (hey, it isn't TERRIBLE...besides, it's open late, and the staff is great), it definitely isn't on my preferred list and, in my opinion, really isn't worth the wait they make you put up with. The ramen is good, but I could still feel my tongue afterward (which is not preferred for me...I like my taste buds to get schwasted with a bowl of ramen), so it was just weak sauce. Oh, and I still ended up with my midnight stomach ache. Womp.

It's not very often that you come across a ramen place that only has one type of ramen on the menu. Andddd.....they really don't need to add more because they have hour-long lines, over 1900 reviews, and the perfect broth. They are fast, friendly and refill your water. We shared a sausage appetizer which was tasty. I wish I got the gyoza instead because I was looking at pictures and they prepare it differently than what I'm used to. The gyoza looks like crispy rolls rather than dumplings. I got the combo that came with their Daikoku ramen and a small bowl of ikura don (salmon roe over sushi rice). I barely finished half the ikura don because the ramen was so large! It had the perfect broth, perfect noodles, tasty pork slices, and a FULL boiled egg....not half like most places. They are pretty cheap here too. Less than $9 for a really large bowl of ramen (without the combo). It also comes with a side of salad.

Yes i know this is a ramen place and I'll say the ramen is good. But what i REALLY crave from this is the minced pork that is part of the combo. I LOVE IT. The sauce, the texture that melts in your mouth. I think next time I go I'm going to order just the minced pork. The only problem with this place is the wait....it's always long!

Not really sure what all the hype is about.. The ramen is good.. but not a 40min-wait-in-line good. Maybe I was expecting too much? I had the same thing at Gyu kaku (granted, the ramen there is prob like 5 times the price, but I think it tasted a lot better..) I'm not trying to dissuade anyone from trying this place out though. It wouldn't hurt to experience the daikokuya ramen sensation :) I give props to the guys working there because you can tell they work really hard.

Given the stellar reviews of this place, I was expecting ramen that would blow my mind, ramen so good that no other ramen could compare. With those expectations, it's no wonder that I was disappointed. I thought Daikokuya was overrated, the ramen was good but I still think Santoka ramen (in the Mitsuwa marketplace) is the best ramen I've ever tasted. Don't get me wrong, the ramen was definitely a solid 4 out of 5 stars here. Plentiful soup and noodles, two thin strips of fatty beef, 5 small shoots of bamboo and one delicious hardboiled egg. The portions are very very hearty, you won't leave daikokuya hungry even if you can't finish your bowl. On that note, I also recommend trying the shredded pork bowl. I ordered it as a combo with the ramen, and it was delicious! Sometimes I order just the pork bowl instead of the ramen it was that good. Highly recommended. Overall, definitely a favorite. I love that it's open until midnight and I love the portions and the taste of the soup. Be careful though, sometimes the line can be over an hour long, especially if you're in a party of more than 2.

This is my favorite place to eat in all of the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area for the past four years.  And I write that with such easy confidence. I will not say anymore other than it shares the same block with the other greatest establishment called Imperial Barber Shop.

You can read all the other 5* reviews for the hype, but let me tell you the reality... ...this place is pretty good! In fact,  it's probably the best ramen place in LA for sure, and the deal for ramen + shredded pork combo is a steal for the amount of great food you get. The gyoza are also pretty respectable. But this is not the best ramen ever. By Tokyo standards, this place is just about average. Since you are in LA though, take what you can get.

From reading many many reviews, I went a couple of times to see if it was really that good as it was told to be. Everything is good except for the parking. I have to go around and around the block looking for any parking spaces. I usually go after the lunch hours to avoid the wait. There's really not much to choose from, but they do really well on their priority menu. The ramens r goooooooooooooood. The soup has a very deep taste to it. I am guessing that it takes a long long time to get the soup to taste that deep. The portion is very large for me, I usually havta give half of my ramen to my bf to finish it up. I don't really recommend ordering other dishes other than the noodles. I am only giving this place 3 stars only because of their ramen. The place looks and feels unsanitary, but I continue to go and consume their irresistible ramens because they are irresistible.

Let me tell you, driving down the 10 to the 110 to the 101 (yes I got lost) during rush hour was a bitch, but when we finally got seated after waiting outside for forever, the ramen was completely worth it. Get their traditional ramen if it's your first time. The chicken and egg rice dish is also really good, something about it just reminds me of eating at home. The only thing that would make this place more perfect is if it wasn't located downtown. Oh well.

Daikokuya is without a doubt my favorite ramen house. If you are looking for ramen in LA and haven't been there. Go now! It's the most rich and flavorful bowl you'll ever eat (and that's just the regular broth). You can kick it up a notch with more flavor and extra pork (highly recommended). Stepping into the restaurant you're greeted by a chair and clipboard (seriously). Staff is limited (2) and depending on the time of day, service can get kinda slow. There is little or no air conditioning, so I wouldn't recommend going there on a blistering afternoon. Tables seat a maximum of 4-5, so small groups only or sit at the bar. Those minor faults aside, it's a small price to pay for possibly the best ramen in LA. The bowls are large and should be enough to satisfy all but the healthiest appetites. Feeling extra hungry? Go for a combination and you'll get a bowl of ramen, a small cabbage salad with miso dressing (I love this), soup, and your choice of side (teriyaki chicken bowl, tempura, sushi...). This is one of those restaurants I can't stop praising. The food is great and I can't help but want them to do well. Oh, don't forget to stop by the mochi shop a couple doors down for some great sweets! The little old lady is so nice!

After a lunch visit to Daikokuya last week and after a comparison visit to Santouka this afternoon, i must say that Daikokuya is steadily losing my attention for fulfilling my ramen cravings. Notwithstanding the long wait (which is now probably a matter of life there), i found the noodles to be a bit harder than al dente and the broth isn't as tasty as i remembered it to be With Shin Sen Gumi just opened across the street, i wonder whether the DKK owners are a bit nervous. i haven't had SSG in a long whilst (and i'm going to make a visit there soon), so i'll see whether i'll change my mind about where i get ramen in J-town.

I was brought here two weeks ago by my foodie cousin who loves to discover all the good eating gems. What can I say? it was love at first slurp! I was told by my cousin to order my ramen Kotteri style (extra back fat) and it did not disappoint! Sooooo yummy and filling. We also had the Sliced Pork Roast appetizer and it was to die for! so tender and yummy!....A week later I couldn't stop thinking about this delicious new discovery I had to show my friends and family! So i took another trip down to Daikokuya this past Saturday morning with new soon to be converts. Well needless to say they are in love as well. I also ordered a side of fried rice and that was simply some of the best fried rice I've ever had. Now the only downside to this place is the wait! as others have already said you either come really early like before they open! (11 a.m.) or you wait 45 to an hour and a half. Is it worth the wait? Heck yea! I suggest you have a light snack before to get here if your not coming early. Stand outside and enjoy some good conversation while you wait for an amazing meal. Parking is also an issue in the area but if you have ever visited the area you should know this by now. Go to Daikokuya now! what are you waiting for? go! like right now! Slurp yourself into a coma!

This is the BEST tonkotsu ramen I've ever had.  On a hot summer night, my friends dragged me to this place on the recommendation of one of their friends.  I thought they had to be crazy for trying a ramen place when it was that hot outside.  By the end of the evening, I had bookmarked this place into my heart.   The noodles were cooked just right.  The Daikoku Ramen comes with a boiled egg, bamboo shoots and several slices of tender, melt-in-your mouth pieces of pork.  All in all, it's divine.   I tried to get the broth recipe from the cooks (we sat at the bar and spent half of the time with our mouths open, drooling over what they were cooking) and despite doing my best eyelash batting pout combination, I got nowhere.  I found that they boil the broth with pork bones overnight.  I don't know what else they put in the broth but it comes out the color of cafe au lait.   Seriously, this was the best meal I had in all of L.A.  And if I were to go back, this is where I'd go first.    If only they were to start an outpost in New York..

My personal phylosophy in giving great reviews on restaurants is to consider the nature of the establishment (meaning what purpose it serves), the service, decor, how it compares with other business alike, and obviously the food. Daikokuya is the epitome of the L.A. Asian role in the wall concept. Within such small confinements I had the priviledge to experience the most friendly waitress (with the best smile... you know... those that make the eyes turn rainbow shapes), the BEST ra-men in L.A. (some say it's even better than in most places in Japan), and the best price for what you get. In truth, I don't know why I have not heard about this place before, but I will be sure to come back again and again and again. Though Daikokuya may not be categorized as a Fine Dining restaurant, its hype and ethnic flavors exceed expectations and manage to outclass plenty of fine dining business in L.A. Why, you ask? Quality Service: Check Chill after work factor: Check Amazing pork ramen: Check Clean: Check Long line at 3:30PM: Check Hole in the Wall factor: Check PS: make sure you ask for the PORK RAMEN... it's orgasmic

Ramen + Fried Rice Combination = Heaven. Even though the wait BLOWS (I've waited anywhere from 5 minutes to an hour and half) and the parking SUCKS (street parking can be hard to find), the food always makes up for it.  On occasion you might get slightly undercooked batch ramen or a slightly overcooked egg, but that has never stopped me from coming back.  Easily my favorite restaurant in Little Tokyo.

Despite a one hour wait, Daikokuya was a fantastic ramen experience, with some Nami Asahi, and single order of Gyouza.  Extra fat broth is an absolute must.  The Ramen style is cooked in a springy, almost chewy style. While I haven't sampled each of the flavours and noodle styles, the place is definitely authentic and tasty to say the least. The price point is very friendly, and deserves 5 stars.  Depending on your Ramen style preferences, I'd either recommend Daikokuya or Shinsengumi while in LA...

I have heard a lot of good things about their ramen and couldn't wait to try it.  Ok, having a location in Little Tokyo is gutsy, like jumping into the middle of an UFC match.  The place is small and crowded and decorated as a tribute to Japanese popculture of yesteryear.  I could have done without the loud Japanese pop music playing in the background, but oh well, it's about the ramen.  I was also relieved to see some old people - good sign that the ramen is worthy. Their ramen was so far the best I've ever had and I'm not talking about the Maruchan/Nissin crap.  I ordered the Daikoku ramen kotteri style. The soup comes in a beautiful milky tan shade which only means that it has been cooking with pork bones all day.  Kotteri style has the added bonus of being cooked with some of the back fat so they form these amazingly huge flavor droplets.  The pork meat itself is so tender and unctuous without being greasy.  If I had know that pork could be so good, I would have cheered for the farmer's wife as she she waited for her husband to give the axe to Babe in the movie.  The ramen noodles were nice and chewy but not tough and complemented the broth perfectly.  If I could have a cup of that broth every morning instead of my coffee. For those of you who are vegetarian or not into pork - beware.  This broth is super porky.  Its flavor will hit you strong and prevade everywhere and you'll come out smelling like Kermit on his wedding night with Miss Piggy.  The tableside crushed garlic and ginger can be added to cut some of that porkiliciousness adding another dimension of flavor. Be prepared to wait as there are a lot of people just put your name on the list.

It felt like a Boiling Crab wait all over again... just waiting to be called while others inside were taking their time and enjoying their delicious food!  That said, if you have the time to wait, the ramen is well worth it.   If you're a little extra hungry, try the Sliced Roast Pork as an appetizer. It's super tender and delicious. The gyoza and spicy tuna rolls were also filling, but not as impressive.  For the main dish, the Daikoku Ramen is what most people get.  It's only $8.50 and will fill you up! Parking can be a pain.  If you can't find street parking and go late at night, there's a large multi-level garage across the street or an open lot with parking attendants.

Best. Ramen. Ever. The Daikoku ramen is perfect just the way it is. For only $8.50, it's definitely worth it. The broth is not over seasoned, the pork is tender and the egg is just cooked. If you want a little something, something extra, there are pureed garlic and red pepper powder for you at the table.

Feels absurd to review this place considering 2000 other ones exist. But here's my two bits. This place is solid. The numbers don't lie. But I do feel there are other places that excel in places that Daikokuya doesn't, namely the broth. Don't get me wrong...it's awesome. But I've had better. Nobody does noodles better than Daikokuya though. Gyoza was delicious....and browned so nicely. Gripes: Crowds abound at this location. Duh.               Green onions....others have mentioned it, but the amount in my                                ramen bordered on obnoxious.               Sucks when you have to sit at the little counter, no elbow room and if you order apps (like gyoza) it becomes ridiculous trying to juggle your ramen bowls, drinks, plates and soy sauce dishes. Perfect for the first-timer.

I'm not a ramen fan because the broth tends to get overly salty for me. My boyfriend brought me here on a Saturday morning. We started lining up 15 minutes before opening and there was at least 20 people waiting behind/before us. Once it was open, we were able to get a seat. The service is really fast, I loved it. I ordered the Daikokuya Ramen with less salt. It was perfect!!!! I loved that they top it off with LOADS and LOADSSS of green onion. It was perfection with the soup. Considering that this is a ramen place, the portions is A LOT. There are many pieces of pork, a hard-boiled egg, and lots of ramen. This place definitely made me fall in love with ramen. The only thing I wish they did better was the soft boiled egg. Mine was almost completely hard boiled. I do love hard boiled eggs but a great part of ramen is the soft-boiled part. Overall, would eat here again and again and again. Come early so you don't have to wait in a looooooong line!

I'm not gonna lie. They do live up to their hype of having the best ramen! Well, they do in my opinion. If there's a better ramen place around the area, pleeeeease let me know! My favorite part of the ramen is that egg. I love how Daikokuya gives an egg in the ramen instead of listing egg as an extra as most other ramen places. Their noodles are cooked perfectly every single time (100% success rate, I can't complain.. or I'm just lucky), and their broth is MMMMMM!! Honestly, I wasn't that fond of the broth during my first time here, but it really got to me in the best way possible. I also tried a bit of the tonkatsu lovers broth (yes, the uberly fatty one), and that was just a bit too much for me, so I'm definitely sticking with their regular broth forever. These people are rather smart for not offering to-go, but hey... ramen always tastes better right there at the right time at the restaurant, and forming a never-ending wait list brings up the hype even more. I always tell myself that I will try something other than the ramen here, but with all that waiting, I always find myself drawn to the ramen and nothing else, unless it is fried rice that comes with the ramen as a combo and whatnot. BUT OMG YES... BEST RAMEN THAT I HAVE HAD!

The Cliffsnotes: Eat here yes if you have time to wait and a large stomach. Good Price. Good service. Not good for more than 4 people. Extended: Did you know that Top Ramen is not the world's only ramen? This place will prove that to you. The ramen bowls are huge and delicious. Enough food for days. Really good prices also. The broth is really well thought out and prepared for a full day I think before you get it. Make sure to order some gyoza. Sauced just right. The beer is a little expensive. This is my only complaint. But this place has taught me what real ramen is, and frankly only this place can. Not Mr. Ramen. Couple key notes though: you really can't bring more than four people here, they just can't seat you well. there's a little bar type deal if you're just in for yourself and a quick bite. you'll need to come in, write your name on the list, and wander around other parts of little Tokyo for a bit before you get seated. At dinner the wait time is around 20 minutes. they are very good about splitting bills if you do it the right way which is write the amounts for each credit card on the back of the receipt. have a great time and tip your servers!

Oh, gosh. Where do I begin?... I am allergic to wheat but I can't seem to say no to Daikokuya's black pork ramen. http://www.daikoku-ten.c… The sauce is yummy but just in case it's not tasty enough to your liking, they have garlic sauce on every table. They also have special marrow sauce to add to the ramen. I think it's called koteri. It's a small place so expect to wait for a table.

On my trip down from NoCal we decided to stop here on the way to our destination further south almost purely based on the recommendations from yelp. Up north, Santa Ramen in San Mateo reigns supreme.  In fact, it's so far ahead of the competition that it almost qualifies as a different type of food.  It's on a completely different level from the rest. So how did Daikokyua fare? Eh, it wasn't half bad though.  When I first started eating my ramen I thought that the depth of flavor wasn't quite what I was expecting.  It was less rich than Santa's pork ramen.  The noodles at Daikokuya are nothing special, they don't taste fresh or hand made, so they really have to rely on their broth to do it for them. About half way through my bowl I noticed that I was really enjoying it.  Even though the restaurant ambient temp was about 90 degrees with smoke filled air on a day where it was 70 degrees outside; somehow I was really enjoying my bowl of ramen. I'm pretty sure this one gets filed in the same category with Santa in that you wouldn't want to eat it frequently.  It's very fatty/rich.  Unfortunately they don't offer other choices for soup, so this is pretty much a special treat type of place.

Slurrrrrrrp!! Besides all the good things already mentioned, I would recommend the combos to mix things up, especially if you're really hungry. My favorite is the unagi donburi combo. That unagi is freakin' sweet. And an order of gyoza on the side! But yea, if you haven't heard, slurping Daikokuya ramen is out of this world! The only lame thing is the crowds. The queue piled up so far into the store, that strangers rubbed their butts on our table and watched as we ate. Kind of creepy if you're not into that sort of thing. You can't blame them though... the ramen is just that good! Tips: Come on a weekday. It's a small place and gets packed quick!

Yeah this place is great. Can get busy so if you come during peak times, expect to wait. Super cheap and tasty. Seems as the portions are American sized so they're huge. When they say it's spicy, they mean it. I usually get it pretty mild so be careful. Watch out for west-side douchebags that tend to come to this place. It never fails, they always seem to show up with their white leather shoes and terrible haircuts. Yeah, I said it.

Yum, Perfect yucky day, cold a little rainy lunch spot. A small storefront in Little Tokyo, that looks non-descript, you could walk right past. The menu is short and based around the Ramen offering, which is pork broth with pork and an amazing egg in it. The other food seems like an afterthought on the menu, and the kitchen is dedicated to turning out pork broth all day. The broth is velvety but not clear, with small pools fat floating, the pork is supremely porcine and meltingly smooth, the noodle is firm and good. I don;t know Ramen, beyond having seen Tampopo, so as my first endeavor, I thought it was great. A+ to Shelley H. for suggesting this place. Next up: Orochon

Daikokuya can get busy, but I doubt anyone would disagree that the wait is worth it.  (We waited exactly 15 minutes. I timed it!)  Once we got a table and ordered, our food came quickly.  The ramen broth is rich, full of flavor that you just can't get from a Cup Noodle packet. Daikokuya's ramen excels in its variety of textures, like bean sprouts, hard-boiled egg, pork slice, and of course the noodles, so you can enjoy the broth in different ways. We also ordered fried rice, but I'd skip that next time and go for a rice bowl.

Just came back from an impromptu dinner with the bf. He got off really late today so I was starving myself until he got home. By the time he did, it was 15 to 11pm, I was starving beyond belief and craving something hot. Usually, we're accustomed to the long lines and waiting in the cold but luckily for we didn't wait at all. Apparently Monday at 11pm is the best time go! Keep that in mind friends. The bf ordered his usual pork cutlet bowl (he always only eats half) and I ordered their ramen (gave my boiled egg to him because if not, he'll order one and they charge you $1 for an egg!). Regardless of how hungry I was, I just couldn't seem to finish the bowl -- it just kept growing! Next time, I think we're going to take advantage of their ramen + 1/2 pork cutlet bowl combo and if possible, I'm totally going to kindly ask them to switch it to a pork cutlet bowl + 1/2 ramen. But yes, Daikokuya you never fail to disappoint me.

Another day, another great ramen place. LA seems to be filled with these specialty ramen restaurants. Daikokuya specializes in serving up a steaming hot bowl of Daikoku Ramen. The Daikoku Ramen is amazing. Heavy broth, firm noodles, and a mountain of flavor brought together by the slices of black pork. Some people claim that black pork make anything delicious. Daikokuya will not prove this theory wrong. The pork just melts in your mouth, but not so much as the Toroniku at Santouka. At the same time, the Daikoku Ramen was a perfect level of oiliness, without even using Shin-Sen-Gumi's checklist. No one component of the ramen stood out as amazing. Rather, the bowl of ramen as a whole stood out as amazing. Everything in the bowl was truly balanced. Good stuff. Naturally, I also tried the fried rice, which was noticeably better than Shin-Sen-Gumi's, but not quite as good as Ramen Nippon. Still great though. One warning is that the store itself gets pretty freaking hot, so layer your clothing on cold days and dress light on hot days. All in all, Daikokuya is the go-to place for ramen in Little Tokyo. GET: Daikoku Ramen

I came here again with a group of friends a couple of weeks ago. The wait time was about 30 minutes on a Friday night. This place is never a disappointment. We all ordered the Daikoku Ramen and boy was it good!! SO YUMMMMY!! We did order a few other things which is also worth mentioning: Gyoza - Very delicious. The skin of the Gyoza wasn't too thick like other places with just the right amount of filling Sausage - Flavorful. Made from Kurobuta pork with sautéed onions Sliced Roast Pork - Yummy. A Must Order dish!! The sweet glaze makes the flavoring of the pork come out. MMMM...MMMM...GOOD!! Shredded Pork Bowl - Amazing as always. Fried Rice - I was a little hesitant when my friend ordered this, but it is actually quite good. It even has corn in it!! Great experience as always.

I went with some friends on a Sat  and we had a wait for about 20 mins.  Once we were seated we were served fast.   It's been months since I've had ramen and it was such a treat!  a HUGE bowl of yummy steamy ramen in a really good soup. I wasn't even that hungry but I ended up finishing most of it.  I ordered the tradition pork ramen and it comes with one full hard boiled egg! Overall, it was great.   small venue, expect a wait.

It's more like 3.5 stars but because of the wait I bumped it down to 3 stars. Both my husband and I are ramen lovers, so we're excited to try out Daikokuya. The first time came here we gave up after waiting 40 minutes (and there were still ~15 parties ahead of us) for dinner because we had my MIL waiting in the cold with us. So this last time we came in really early around 5.15pm on a Sunday and was finally seated after 40 minutes (still 40 minutes wait which is ridiculous).  Hubby got the normal daikokuya tonkotsu ramen and I got the richer Kotteri ramen.   When they came we honestly can't tell the difference in taste, but the kotteri ramen was obviously so fatty, we could see the greasy layer of the broth.  The portion is huge though and they're very generous with the broth!  But we somehow had very high expectations because of the long wait, and was a little bit dissapointed to find the ramen.  It was quite good, but not worth the wait.  I mean we have so many other choices out there. At the end, neither of us could finish our ramen - this never happened before!!   Maybe because we just had lunch a few hours earlier, but the fact that we didn't find the ramen THAT good also contributed to it. However, the side fried rice was SUPER!!! It was very tasty and we fought over it :p

Let's see what this line is about... And after 2500+ reviews, does mine even matter? This was a great "hole the wall" eatery. I had yet to try Ramen in my 34 years of planet existence. No, the packaged 20/$1 Ramen does not suffice. The menu was easy, but the choices were hard. I had the basic Daikokuya Ramen, with pork. To my surprise it came with a "whole" egg, this was interesting to me because eggs are the norm for morning, for most anyway. The pork in this dish was so tender and delicious! Even though my "hypothalamus" (part of the brain that controls your appetite) was telling me to stop, I completely disregarded it's request and ate until I filled the empty seat next to me. Yes, it was that good. I shall be back. Parking was scarce as usual unless you have some parking $$ There was a line, and it did take awhile but well worth it.

The pork broth soup here is really goood.  Not to be missed if you like ramen like i do. The place is pretty small, sorta rectangular shape if you will, with tables down one side of the wall and bar seats around the counter on the other side of the wall where the ramen chefs make it all happen. It's a ramen shop so most people come here for their special ramen, or you can order it with a combination which will come with a bowl of rice with your choice of toppings or fried rice. As for the ramen itself, it's consists of: pork broth soup, loads of fresh onions, bamboo shoots, an egg, and slices of pork.  Great stuff.

*there are nearly 500 reviews on this place so i'll keep it concise. *One of the best "pork-bone soup" ramen in LA, beats Shinsengumi - San Gabriel, in par with Shisengumi - Torrance. *"Open Kitchen" maybe a hot design trend for residential properties, but it does NOT work for a ramen shop.  the place is freaking HOT as hell, since you are literally sitting next to giant pots of boiling soup and deep fryer. etc. *shredded Pork Bowl tasted a lot like the Taiwanese Minced Meat Rice. Very heavy flavor, I ran out of rice before the meat.

Wow. Possibly the best ramen I've ever had. The good: Daikoku ramen - I think this is the best pork broth I've ever had.  It comes with a hard boiled flavored egg, green onions, and pork.  DELICIOUS. Fried rice - Also delicious.  Also served with little bits of pork. Kirin draft - only $2.50!  It's only about 6 oz. though.  Pretty tiny. Could be better: The firmness of the noodles.  A little too firm in my opinion (chewy).  I wish they were just a tad bit softer. The not so good: Temperature inside the restaurant.  Could it get any hotter?  It was 90+ degrees outside, and it was cooler OUTSIDE than it was inside.  Make sure you eat fast because it's damn hot inside. My rankings (of good/great ramen places): 1) Daikokuya (Little Tokyo), 2) Ippudo NY, 3) Shin Sen Gumi (Fountain Valley) Next up: Santouka Ramen (Costa Mesa)

Santouka Ramen is still my #1 spot when I crave japanese ramen. But considering the drive and traffic, and depending on how hungry I am, I'd come to Daikokuya for my ramen fix. It's definitely better than Orochon down the street and many others in its near vicinity, but really?? an hour wait?? Maybe its cause I hate waiting especially when I'm super hungry. Anyway, it's a weekday, around 7pm, and my friend and I finally get seated at the two very end bar seats. As I struggle to find a comfortable way to sit while holding onto my purse, I give up and it ends up on my lap. Friendly Japanese server takes our orders. I order the regular Daikokuya Ramen and my friend orders the Ramen + Tuna rice bowl combo. He gets his salad [flavorful, thousand island-type dressing but better!], then we finally get our bowl of goodness. The noodles were cooked perfectly with the right amount of chew and softness. It was delicious. Soup, very well made, but I do like having my choices of soyu or miso at other places. Friend liked the tuna and said it was very fresh. I opted not to try because I wanted to be able to finish my bowl. Which I....didn't. Portions are pretty large and spectacular. So come hungry! Or if you're not, you will be by the time you get seated since the wait outside is will be treacherous.

I can see this turning into a comfort food joint for me. The friendly atmosphere in the restaurant along with the scattered memorabilia are great complements to their thick, rich ramen broth, all of which does wonders for putting me at ease. I've had my fair share of japanese ramen, and I must say that Daikokuya has my favorite broth, and it's really what sets it apart from other ramen joints. If you don't like really rich or oily broth, you might want to get something else on their menu, but it totally hits the spot for me. P.S. For the ladies, you may not want to sit by the bar near the kitchen because it can get really steamy in there. Your face melting off is the last thing you need when you're enjoying a delicious bowl of ramen.

Does this place ever NOT have a line??  My goodness... Came here at 11am when they are suppose to open.  They opened late... by the time I ate it was 12:45pm and the line was out the door of course.  So usually at night I just write my name, head over to far bar and grab a drink.  Sometimes I miss my name but they seat me right after.  Lolz.  I'm usually a little buzzed so I'm happy.   Their food is good!  I will say this though... the other Daikokuya in Alhambra just tastes better.  Line there sucks too!  Anyways, if you are craving some good Ramen, Daikokuya is the best!  Just expect to wait... always.  I have yet to find a time when there is no wait.  Maybe I'll just have to camp out here to find out.....

I love my friend A for ramen obsession!! We were driving back from Magic Mountain to SD and wanted to stop at a place to eat.  My friend made the best decision and suggested ramen.  We used yelp and this place immediately popped up with high ratings and praise. And let me tell you it is well deserved!  I didn't realize this was the place my Japanese friend had highly recommended a while back.  I didn't remember until I saw the bright yellow sign.  Just remember the yellow sign! It's in Japan town so parking might be a problem but it was sooo worth it!   Kotteri broth = more fatty broth was delicious!! Yum Yum! Probably the best ramen I've ever had.  I am so happy.  The portion was really generous too.  I was struggling to finish and I just kept wanting to drink the broth.  We went to this place at 1030pm on a sunday and it was still busy! I will dream about Daidoku ramen now

When I'm in Little Tokyo I usually have to decide between two ramen places for lunch - Daikokuya or Orochon. This place is unique compared to other ramen places because of their kotteri broth. It makes for a more fatty broth, but man, it is VERY good. It's no problem as long as you don't go here everyday. The noodles are very good quality - I like the noodles here better than Orochon. If you're really hungry, they have combinations as well, so you can get ramen + a small bowl of rice and meat of choice. I got the shredded pork bowl and it was pretty tasty. I'll probably try the chicken teri or teriyaki eel bowl next. However, if you are in the mood for a spicier ramen, go to Orochon. I like both equally - just depends on what I'm in the mood for. Daikokuya is more expensive by a few bucks, but it is definitely worth it because of the richer kotteri broth. Longer wait though. To summarize my comparison: Daikokuya: 1) Better noodles 2) Kotteri broth is bomb Orochon 1) Cheaper 2) Can get spicy broth 3) Less waiting time

What else can I add that everyone else hasn't said?  Not much. My boyfriend and I had the ramen during our first visit to LA (before our move from TX).  It was cold and rainy (yea, RAINY) and we were seated pretty quickly at the bar.  Salad was so delicious and noodles were tasty.  Ramen was perfectly cooked - chewy but not gummy.  The broth was kinda salty, I was gulping down beer & raspberry tea.  Still, it's a nice memory - the two of us excited by the possibilities of this new city. Anyway, if the bowls are too big, there's a small bowl option that's not on the menu.  I get that so I don't overeat per usual.   That's about all I can add to this.

My first ramen dish so I went with the ramen with the large picture on the first page like a total tourist. This review is from a very first pho & ramen experience. Fast service! No wait time! Food at my table in minutes. Apparently that's not always the case. Of course I have to tell you I got there a bit after lunch.. 1:45pm. I ordered a Japanese soda since I felt like having a sugar rush. Pho was very brothy and good.  The brown egg in there was wild.. I didn't know  what it was for a moment so I bit into it and quickly realized it was an egg slowly simmered to perfection. Great experience. Tough on groups since it's not a large place and is popular. Reasonably priced with a friendly staff. I'll be back to try some more dishes.

You love ramen, you say?  Do you really love it?  How much do you love it? Stop complaining about the wait and just understand that you are about to eat the best food in the world.  Or very close to it.   When I go to paddy heaven, steaming bowls of Daikokuya ramen are going to be there, waiting for me.  As is the delicious black pork appetizer thingy, which name I have forgotten now, because I'm living on the other side of the country.  But yes.   You should eat there.  Eating there makes you a winner who is made of win.

finally got a chance to try daikokuya after having it bookmarked for over a yearrr. -parking sucks..its either street parking or parking in a structure. we paid $3 for all day parking in a structure next to weller court (we went on a sunday during the day) -waiting is ridiculous. Wrote our names down behind about 20 parties. -finally after waiting about an hour and a half we were seated -service is prompt We ordered a large sapporo, one ramen, and one combo with the chicken and egg bowl which comes with salad. The ramen broth was really good and deep in flavor, the noodles were just okay...i didnt try the chicken egg bowl cause i was too full so i cant say. Overall, the ramen is good, but i personally dont think its worth driving all the way here and waiting over an hour for it. if i was in the area and the wait was minimal i would be happy to go again :)

This place was good, but I've had better.  I think I went in over-expecting since supposedly it's the best Japanese ramen place in the LA county.   I had the Daikokuya Ramen.  I thought the noodles were slightly soggy and the soup a little more oily than I would've liked.  The brown egg wasn't cooked exactly the way I like it.  Maybe I'm just being too nit-picky, but I came in expecting to be blown away.   I don't mind giving it another shot.  But for now, 3 stars is what I can afford to give.

Unlike reviewer "Winnie" , I've never been to Japan, or an "upscale" ramen place whatever that means (I don't know how upscale you want a bowl of salty water and noodles to be cunt) and perhaps she's trying to insinuate she's some sort of expert or better than us average yelpers who haven't been to Japan or something I don't know.  But she's seems like a cunt, and I wouldn't listen to her if i were you.   I try not to be snob about service.  What do you expect for a meal for less than $10?  Would you complain about the decor at Denny's?  There are only 2 or 3 waiters, all working there because they can't get proper jobs for whatever reason.  Don't say management is cheap for the small staff, you think it's fun splitting tips among more than 3 people + the cooks?   The Ramen is pretty good and that's all you should care about.  The bottom line is that if you come, come for the food, eat quick and go.  That's the purpose of a ramen meal.  Ramen joints, and this one especially, it's not a restaurant restaurant so don't be expected waited on hand and foot.   The broth rich and good.  The pork is great too. The other items on the menu are average Japanese foods, pretty good, nothing special.   Don't be the asshole who takes up a seat just to order Chicken Teriyaki.  White people can be so annoying sometimes. That being said, service is average but never rude or unpleasant (they are just busy dude).  Parking is a bitch, the wait can be extremely long on weekends, and during dinner & lunch rushes.

One of the best ramen places in little Tokyo since they have the hakata style tonkotsu soup!  The interior is decorated with old japanese billboards (kanban) and ads.  There are booths and counter seatings where you can watch them make the ramen.  The big eater that I am... I usually order the combo which comes with ramen and a little rice bowl topped with shredded pork or oyako don [katsu and egg] or teriyaki chicken, etc).  And ofcourse I need to order a side of their square gyoza which is pretty good.  Oh and beer goes so well with it all! yum! Everytime I go (I usually go for dinner) there is a 45min to an hour wait... so don't go in there too hungry you will probably die from starvation.

As a ramen novice, I thoroughly disgusted Art L. who couldn't believe I had yet to try real ramen that didn't have the brand name "TOP". Grabbing me by the hand, we ventured to Little Tokyo and settled on Daikokuya. At 8 at night there was an hour's wait to get in - which we used as ample time to slay dragons, try taro pancakes, steal Cartman's cheesy poofs, and discuss scatological knowledge. Finally we went in. It was small but the portions were big. It was sweaty atmosphere, like a pig's underbelly. The patrons there ranged from the authentic to the ultra hip. We ordered the special pork-broth and porky pork based ramen (I hate pork so much... but it's an experience! What can you do?) and the eel on rice combo. And my god, it was delicious. Given, next time I'd chose a place with a miso-base or even a beef or chicken base, but the food was pretty damn good. Parking is a bitch here. Service is relatively nice and attentive. Waiting sucks, but you can occupy your time by doing any of the above mentioned (I recommend the scatological knowledge one.. it was fun!) This place has a "C" rating as far as Health Department issues go... but that only means it's authentic. They no longer do take-out.

Ramen in my part of the world is a food group that only exists in a microwaveable, Styrofoam cup. My visit to Daikokuya made me want to rent an overpriced loft in downtown L.A. so that ramen could be a daily addition to my diet. This place rawks hard. The ramen at Daikokuya start in a soup stock that is complex and rich with porky flavor. The restaurant uses kurobata pork - the belly - as part of the flava delivery system. The noodles are toothsome and taste fresh and not out of a Sysco package (if Sysco made ramen noodles). I've also tried the shredded pork bowl - lots of kurobata belly meat, onions and pickled ginger. Very filling for the price. The interior of Daikokuya is worth a yelp, too. Old Japanese adverts (lots of vitamin ads...), wood, and 'relics' make this a comfortable place. Service is good. Food good. Authentic feel. Good mix of yin/yang vibe. I'm going back as soon as possible....

Daikokuya has quite the reputation downtown. Everyone knows that it's supposed to be the best. I've been meaning, therefore, to try it ever since I moved downtown in September, but every time I tried, it was TOO busy and I didn't want to wait. Decided that treating my Japanese buddy to dinner was a good excuse to finally try it. So... the best in LA? My answer is a resounding yes... and no. The friendliness of the servers, the cleanliness of the restaurant, the freshness of ingredients and the artistry of the presentation? All top notch, no question. Why why the ambivalence? Because Orochon specialized in spicy noodles, and that's sort of awesome. As good as Daikokuya is, it's just not that same thing going on... so while fresh, flavorful, and delicious, it didn't satiate my spiciness cravings. Also, I feel like it's quite a bit pricier than Orochon. So if I'm in the mood for cheap and spicy, it's Orochon. When I'm with spice-wimps who can't hang, I'd definitely take them to Daikokuya. Perhaps they're the angel and devil on my right and left shoulder.

Word of the day - kotteri - as in: Once you go kotteri, you'll never go back!  (Sorry, I'm no rhyme master.)  But seriously...best ramen broth I've tasted.  You just can't go wrong with nectar of the gods, brewed from pork back fat. Hubby and I developed a strategy of getting to high-demand places on or shortly before opening time.  Unfortunately, my hair wasn't cooperating and I couldn't find the right sweater to go over my ensemble so we didn't get to Daikokuya until 11:20am.  Unfortunately, that meant another 20-30 minute wait for us. Not much to say that hasn't already been said by 2,000+ other Yelpers - the ramen is delicious and the egg they give you in it kicks ass with its semi-cooked yolk.  I love that they give you garlic paste and pink ginger at the table.  The gyoza and fried rice were good...not mind-blowing like the ramen...but good.  The spicy tuna tempura was also a pleasant surprise. Another plus - drinks are refillable!! That is so rare in many Asian restaurants who insist on charging by the can or bottle. I'm glad I got to try this at least once.  I want to come back - who's with me?!

Big Black Family - that's what the characters for Daikokuya mean in Chinese... I've always gotten a kick out of that. Wow, over 500 Yelp reviews... basically says it all, doesn't it? While I don't know if it's the BEST ramen joint in LA, it is iconic- I've never been seated without at least a ten to fifteen minute wait, even on the slow days. That's the genius of Daikokuya- they've built up this hype that helps sustain their business, even when things are tough. But really, what's not to like? It's affordable, with a rice bow/ramen bowl combo a little less than $10... There's kitschy Japanese pop culture items from the 1960s and '70s all over the place... And their salad dressing is AWESOME- if you've read some of my other reviews, you know how highly I regard salad dressing for Japanese combo meals. And seriously, the rice bowls at this place aren't talked about enough- whether it's their chicken katsudon or their tempura don, the rice and its counterpart pair so well, and JUST the right amount... especially if you already feel stuffed from the ramen. The broth for the ramen soup is really what makes this place great- the noodles are run-of-the-mill, you can get better meat elsewhere, there are more varied flavors at other restaurants, etc. However, the smooth, silky flavor of the soup is something that just grabs a hold of you and gives you a big hug... it's like chicken soup for grown-ups. Every time I walk down 1st Street, I tell myself I'll go to one of the other eateries on the street. Instead, I always find myself drifting off-course or turning on a dime to head straight back for Daikokuya... my ramen home.

This place is alright. While it was good enough that I liked it, it didn't stand out as being better than any other Japanese place I've been to. That, however, may have been my fault. Despite being a "Noodle & Rice-Bowl," it's pretty bloody obvious that it's more "Noodle" than "Rice" the second you walk in. It's probably my fault because I'm not a big fan of Japanese style ramen, so instead of the ramen, I went for a bento. I got a 3 item bento with tempura, spicy tuna roll, and tonkatsu. All of these are pretty hard to screw up and, I'm happy to report, they didn't. Of course along with most "hard to screw up" dishes comes "hard to improve upon." This they certainly didn't do either. Maybe I would feel differently if I had gotten ramen, but since I don't like Japanese ramen... I considered a tsukemen and maybe I should have gotten that. The tsukemen is basically their deconstructed ramen (noodles, soup, veggies and meat come separately instead of in the bowl together), except I think the ramen itself is cold. Next time I come here, if I ever do, I certainly will try that.

Are you kidding me?  I can't believe this place got such a high rating on yelp.  The broth was VERY bland and  no matter how much of those little condiments they had provided I put into my soup-- it still lacked a lot of flavor! The spicy tuna rolls were mushy.  Frankly, the sushi at 7-11 probably taste better.  Dumplings were decent -- I've had better.  The fried rice tasted like any other fried rice I had.  I can't believe I wasted almost an hour of my life,  to consume lower than mediocre ramen.  Such a disappointment... Would NOT return. 1 to 5. 5 being the highest. Food - 2 Service- 4 ( Attentive but our waitress didn't seem very joyful  ) Parking - Across the street. $5 or 6.

A bit cramped here but definitely a must visit. I'm not a ramen fanatic but this is definitely one of the better bowls that I've had. There was a misunderstanding when we ordered our food and they brought out two extra bowls of ramen. After clarifying our order, our waitress simply took back the two extra bowls without making any fuss (but who knows what went on behind the scenes). Overall, I'd definitely go back for more.

It is really odd for me to think I've been going to Little Tokyo with my family since I was a baby and yet never tried the food here. Then again, with all my relatives, we'd have to wait about four hours until we could get seated. And we'd be taking up the whole restaurant, too. Braving the crowds from the Cherry Blossom Festival, I finally got the nerve to wait and eat here (especially after seeing what the ramen looked like at Orochon and feeling slightly disgusted). About 30 minutes later (since so many people on the list before us bailed), we were seated in a booth. My better half and I both had the ramen, although she enhanced hers with a side of tuna sashimi. She said it was great. I wasn't able to try it since I already had ingested some delicious beer. (Sashimi and alcohol do not mix for me). I enjoyed the gyoza since it wasn't in the usual little football-ish shape, and was nicely grilled. I ate most of mine, but still had enough broth and noodles to take some. Guess what I'm having for dinner tonight? Ooooooooooh yeah! Anyways, the place itself is tiny, and you will need to wait a bit, but heck, its an institution. And based by most of the reviews here, seems like a place worthy of your time. Just remember to drop by a couple doors down to pick up some mochi. You'll probably need it to stave off the hunger pains as you whiff the delicious pork brothy smells coming from the restaurant.

A-Okay when you're craving a large bowl of cheap ramen noodles that make you think of home cooked ramen, but somehow you can't make it yourself. But by god I am in love with their steamed egg, steamed to half-yolky perfection. There's a few things you should keep in mind when visiting Daikokuya. It's about ramen as a comfort food, so don't expect some fancy Ippudo shit (I hate Ippudo though). It's about $9, which is amazing for the size! Imagine a soup base so delicious that you want to roll into bed right after (or work out when you realize how much you scarfed). Secondly, LONG LINES!! Expect a minimum of two hours for dinner and popular days. Two people will be faster if you're willing to sit by the bar setting. There's only about four/five booths that sit large amounts. I think there's a big room in the back? However, the bowl is huge and I don't see how anyone would want to order more food (unless they treat it as a buffet). Then again, I am a 5"2, 110lb girl. Maybe a 5"10, 172lb boy would think the bowl only adequate. Yet your bang for your buck. Daikukoya is worth the price and worth the try. What's not worth it are the refill drinks that taste like syrup. My friend had to ask them to mix their unsweetened and sweetened tea because the raspberry tea was disgusting! It was like drinking syrup straight! :( Worth the wait? Perhaps only the first time - the ambiance is busy-body, and while you aren't rushed out of the place, you feel obliged to leave as soon as possible because of all the people. The atmosphere is slightly uncomfortable, due to the copious amounts of people... but it's worth ONE go.

I'd have given 4 stars if the service was good. I just had Daikokuya ramen tonight. I have to say it was pretty good. Good tonkotsu soup, not too rich but just right. Chashu was the best part of this meal. So tasty and soft it melts in your mouth. I don't really care about the egg tho. I also tried the fried rice and gyoza(I always order one with Ramen) I'm not so crazy about them either. I still like Koraku's better. Overall, I have to say Ramen was decent, kinda expensive for a ramen shop. 2 Ramen, fried rice and gyoza and tip was around $30. I might come back here but if I'm in this area I'd rather go to Koraku  where the bill would have been around $20(for 2 ).

There are moments in my life where the experience has shattered and reshaped my perspective of the world. Daikokuya was one of those moments, because I have experienced the essence of ramen, and it is divine. I learned a new word, kotteri. It's been almost a month and I still dream of the richness of the soup. My initial goal was to construct the perfect mouthful - just enough soup, noodle, egg, and pork. Towards the end, I realized it was futile, because every mouthful was wonderful. I loved it so much that we went back the next day. The only difference was that I tried the unagi instead of pork bowl. Unagi was melt in your mouth buttery goodness. Pork was sweet guilty pleasure. I unleashed the most aggressive of all u-turns in order to get a parking spot and we waited over an hour on a Saturday night, but it was worth it. This is the Hattori Hanzo of west coast ramen, because I now compare it to every ramen ever made that wasn't made by Daikokuya. It's that good.

Daikokyua is absolute. It is . From the quirky posters that drip with old school propoganda (one glance at the Coke bottle glasses spurned the most ridiculous and impossible need to buy a replica - I did find a pair but they don't work on fat faces). Consistently great, I've never been disappointed by their giant bowls of magic broth. Their noodles are never overcooked or undercooked, instead, they are the epitome of great texture. The pork literally melts on your tongue. Boiled egg, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts all work well to bring phenomenal, rich flavors to the meal. All for ten dollars! The gyoza is delicious and heavily seasoned (you have never loved garlic until now). And cheap Sapporo beers! In frosted glasses! It brings tears to my eyes. The lines, only during peak hours, are worth it. Shitty days or abysmal weather do not matter when it comes down to Daikokuya. This is the place of ephemeral joy.

To be fair, I've only had one dish here, but I would come back again and again for that same bowl of savory deliciousness. We came late on a Saturday night and waited a little over an hour. There's a shopping center nearby, and we wandered around in the meantime (read: Having to wait isn't some interminable experience akin to purgatory, quit whining, people). When we finally got seated, we all ordered the same thing: The Ramen. It was amazing. It had a delicious pork cutlet and a soft-boiled egg, and we all got it "kotteri" style which is made using the back fat of the pork for a more delicious and unhealthily awesome experience. Everybody but me got half-orders, and while I don't regret my decision of a full order per se, I do regret not having a magic bottomless pouch instead of a functioning stomach. There are other options, such as Ramen with Ikura on the side, and ramen dry style. I want to come back and try them. Now. I'm probably going again this weekend. I was going to invite friends, but if I come alone, I can get seated at the bar faster...

The soft-boiled egg in the ramen is one of a kind for ramen houses in Los Angeles.. and it is absolutely delicious! The only thing that really sucks is the line.

It was soooo good that my roommate's friends would drive from LV and SD just for this yummy ramen! we always went at the spur of the moment too! the plus is that they close really late... but you still have to come and sign in on the clipboard. your party must also be all present. now that i'm back in the bay, no other ramen place still compares (trust me i've tried my fair share.) but if you're in the bay, i recommend santouka! anyway, back to the review! eat whatever kind of ramen you like, but you must get a combo!! you can never go wrong with their fried rice! it's sooo goooood. their salad is also http://bomb.com! and believe me when i say i am most definitely not one of those salad eating girls!! their sauce is home-made and very true and authentic to japanese dressings! soo goooood. my heart's always happy and my tummy is as well whenever i go here. it's a must when i visit LA or head to OC and SD. thank you to my best friend/roomie for introducing me to this place! one more tip, no togo orders! so eat to your heart's content while you are here! it also gets stuffy in here... but i love that you can smell the ramen's broth right out the front door!

I dont think i've ever been to daikokuya without having to wait at least 30 minutes. This place is ALWAYS packed. thats always a good sign of how great the restaurant is. My usual plan is to put my name down for daiko then walk over to far bar for some drinks and come back to get seated! they have the best ramen i've had in LA. I've been to a lot of different ramen houses but daiko is by far my favorite. The broth is savory and delicious and the condiments are just right. I love to order it as a combo (with fried rice or pork bowl) and also an appetizer for GYOZA! this is to share OF COURSE. their gyoza is soooo good. I always look forward to it whenever i go. i think everything on their menu is great, but just be real.. you come to a ramen shop to get RAMEN.. not sushi... so get their RAMEN! they have ONE type of ramen so get it! the spicy/kimichi version is just  ok.. just get the orginal. They have a few more daikokuyas in rowland heights, monterey park, and costa mesa but the little tokyo daiko is the BEST ONE. recap: 1) long wait 2) RAMEN 3) gyoza!

One of the better ramen places I've had. They only have one broth but it's delicious! Came with 3 folks a few minutes right before the lunch rush.  It was a warm afternoon in LA (par for the course), so we all ended up getting the cold noodles.  The noodles themselves were good, but the broth was great. Would definitely come again. FYI, groups of more than 4 (their largest booth size) will need to be split probably.

Without a doubt, Daikokuya is the best ramen I have ever had, anywhere. Egg, Pork, Noodle. I will eat you, now and forever. After I had finished, it was one of the few noodle dishes where, rather than just sipping the broth, I was quite literally drinking it despite my stretched and aching belly simply because the flavor was equal to the contents of the soup in raw pleasure center stimulation. If you want to really enjoy yourself, go on a Friday but wait until midnight so there is no wait.  If you go earlier, get your name on the list and keep your eyes peeled for spot-thieving fellow ramen patrons.  If you have suspicions that someone else has stolen your spot in line, feel free pull back the curtain that leads into the dining hall and scream "J'ACCUSE!" until you are given a seat at a booth. Or, if you want to be seated quicker, eat at the bar. The gyoza didn't have to be incredible since I literally came back here two nights in a row for the damn succulent ramen. But the gyoza was damn succulent, too. Sweet Daikokuya Forever will I suckle Your pork noodle broth Best meal in Little Tokyo that I've had yet.

Although it can't compare to true ramen from Sapporo, Kyushu, or even Tokyo, Daikokuya isn't half shabby. It has a stronger taste than most of the other ramen stores in the nearby Little Tokyo area. They have a fine selection of different types of Ramen but the descriptions might be fuzzy for those who are new to the experience. It's good to see your chef's making your ramen in front of you because you can see the effort and time they put into making your meal. I can't say that it's the BEST ramen I'd ever had, or if it's even to die for, but I can honestly say that it's one of the better ramen joints in the area. As for the wait, you can't winge about it because it's all part of the ramen dining experience.

Best Ramen in LA! I always order their special, the Daikokuya Ramen. The broth is sooo good!!! Combine that with some amazing noodles and pork belly that just melts in your mouth and you have yourself a winner! The gyoza and the fried rice are also very good. This is one of those places I don't hesitate to bring people because everyone that I've taken here love it and they wonder where ramen has been all their life! You will notice that there are all these ramen places nearby, but the crowd is packed near this place.  It's so good that people will wait for a table or run ahead of you along the sidewalk just to put their name on the wait list before you do. Yes, you will probably be waiting and yes, it's that good. If you want good quality, satisfying ramen...come here, you won't be disappointed!

I've eaten a shitload of Ramen in my lifetime, though mostly of the make yourself at home variety.   Always loved it, it makes an impoverished upbringing that much more tolerable.  I'd say eating it with ketchup was probably as low as it's gotten with me and ramen. The idea of eating something like Ramen in a restaurant seemed like a funny idea for me.  It's like ordering a bowl of knock off brand cereal at a restaurant or a microwaveable burrito,   But I tried it none the less at lil Japanese Market called Mitsuwa.  I was a fan.  The pork bowl that it came with only made it that much better. I had tried other places and they never really  came to compete with Mitsuwa's Ramen Joint.  I mean, you'd be surprised how much goes into a bowl of hot salty water with some cheap noodles.   Well, I finally found a place that is at least up to par with it....and surprise...it's this place.  The broth smells like freshly fried pork rinds.  That's how much potent pork power this thing is packing.  The egg's already thrown in there.  I think they only serve it in "Large".  I ate the whole thing.  I didn't mean it.  I just kept wanting to retaste it, and retaste it. It's pretty popular and like anything in LA that's worth doing, you have to fight a crowd, sign up, and wait around for a while. Especially around the night time.  There's a few bars that are open and you can get a drink and pass the time while waiting so that's not so bad. So there,  Another delicious place to add the the arsenal of delicious places in LA to go to. God, it's so hot today.  Stupid weather.  I'm not wearing any pants.  Chew on that, reader.

My favorite ramen place in the WORLD. This place is dirt cheap and so good. I go into mad food coma every time I eat here. Always get the ramen combo, it comes with a selection of sides you may chose from (I always get the fried rice) and served with miso and a cabbage salad with a creamy dressing. The ramen is a soy sauce based broth that is packed with flavor and garnished with a boiled egg, bamboo shoots, scallions, sprouts, and sliced pork. This meal is huge and will cost you about $12! Also try the chicken teriyaki (which is light fried versus grilled) and the sausage. Uber yumness! This joint is tiny and always packed, so be prepared to wait and don't bring more than 3 people with you. Parking in J-Town always sucks. P.S. I had their sushi once, and let's just say that I had to rush home really quick :/

I've had this ramen before I left for japan and after.  I must say that it doesn't live up to the hype.  If you ever get the chance, go to Ichiren Ramen in Roppongi, you should be able to find it online.  Then compare it to here.  People swear by Daikokuya but its just ok.  I mean compared to Ajisen it's godlike, but Ajisen is pretty much garbage. The one thing that does make this ramen better is to throw in heaping amounts of chili pepper and garlic, mix it up, and let it sit.  If you ordered the combo (which you should be doing!) eat the fried rice and take your time.  Once that's done, the ramen should have absorbed some of that yummy garlic / chili goodness and you'll have a decent bowl of ramen to enjoy. Unfortunately, the fact that you have to redesign your own ramen and you  have to wait at least 1 hour to get to eat makes this place not really worth it.

This place has great ramen. They didn't have the extra fatty broth when I went, but it was great anyway. Also got the pork bowl thing, which was also good. A little bit on the pricier side, but definitely not over-priced to the point where it's an issue. There was a wait when we came here, even though it was slightly off-hours.

So tasty! This was my first time eating ramen that was not the noodles in the pack that I ate in college.  It was sooo much different.  I got the Daikokuya specialty.  The broth was crazy good.  The noodles were delicious and even that soft boiled egg was surprisingly good.  I got there around 10 PM on a Wednesday night and there was still a big line.  Make sure to go right to the front and write your name on the list as I told the hostess I wanted to just sit at the counter, but waited for about 5 minutes until I figured out the system, so others that arrived later went before me.  Anyway, this place is very tasty and I highly recommend stopping by if your in LA.

There are really only two dishes worth ordering here - the Ramen and Tsukemen.  However, it is hands down the best ramen in Los Angeles and possibly anywhere in the United States. The noodles are firm yet just elastic enough.  The pork melts in your mouth.  The broth tastes like it has been stewing for ages with all the marrow goodness. The other dishes are pretty average.  There are much better places in LA to get their non-ramen bowls.  This place is the best when you're craving a hot bowl of noodles.

I was so impressed by the ~1150 yelper reviewers of 4-star and 5-star reviews, so I scratch what I said about Los Angelan Yelpers in my previous review. So we decided to go on a Thursday night, and ended up still waiting for 40 minutes for a table. However, if you don't mind sitting at the bar, then the wait is a lot shorter. They do give you a lot of ramen, so if you do order appetizers, just remember that. The gyozas are amazing, and I would rate them at least 5-stars (see photo). They are so beautifully prepared, crispy with garnish. The ramen was amazing too. I'm not sure if it's the best ramen I've had, but I gave it 4-stars because I want to reserve saying I had the best for when I have ramen in Japan (seriously). Maybe Yelp will be there too by then. Let me explain my ramen attraction. It all started after I watched Ken Watanabe's Tempopo movie (all about ramen). In this classic, they explain the proper way to eat the pork and your ramen, etc. Now, Daikokuya's ramen didn't seem to be classic to me, however, the pork they used was (I think) pork belly, so fatty it melts in your mouth, yummy. The egg used is one that is boiled and pickled in soy sauce, which reminds me of the 100-year duck egg from Amy Tan's book (but chicken instead of duck). The broth was really thick. But what made the ramen outstanding was the consistency of the noodle. The texture was amazing, and retained it's hardness (e.g. equivalent to al dente with pasta noodles). Not sure if they were fresh or dried. I've tried a Japanese package noodle that gives that same texture (yes, I am that lucky to find such a package ramen -- made in Japan of course). They serve alcohol. I wasn't too privvy on the tea. It was slightly weak and tasted like rice/barley tea.

After being so used to paying cheap SGV prices, it felt kind of nostalgic having to pay so much money for food. Alright, it's not that expensive; Japanese food tends to hover around 10 bucks, which isn't really that expensive, depending on your perspective. Biggest plus was their combo of the small bowl of pork cutlet and their ramen. In fact, it was actually quite cheap since they put a load of stuff in your ramen (delicious) and their pork cutlet bowl actually contained a perfect amount of  pork slices to rice ratio. Unfortunately, I'm going to have to admit that I was too full to finish everything. So I had some leftover rice... and a little bit of ramen. And now I wish I had it cause I'm friggin hungry =/

As a ramen connoisseur that has eaten at many ramen places, I think Daikokuya is probably one of the best ramen places in LA.  For one, Daikokuya is one of the only places in LA that utilizes the double soup method well.  (Uses two kinds of broth, one fish and the other pork)  My favorite ramen of all times is in Japan at a ramen place called Aoba that was the founder of this double soup method and being one of the only places in LA that uses this method, Daikokuya is a sure bet.   You can have the option of getting the soup thicker which I recommend since I feel that you can taste both of the broths better this way.  They also have great charshu using kuro-buta or black pork which has a very tender and sweet taste.  The only other thing that would make me happier is if this place had firmer noodles but I can always have them make the noodles firmer by asking the waitress.   This ramen is rich with lots of flavor and volume so make sure you're hungry when you head over to this place.

Now we are talking "RAMEN"!!!! I love this place, since the noodle, and the soup mix together ... They are Tasty. I've been to Hakata Ramen many many times, but I found out that Daikokuya is slighly better. Be aware of the wait ... Since the place is very small, you might have to wait about 20 minutes ... but it's worthed Usually I spend around $ 20 for 2 people

I can't believe we went from the OC to LA to eat at this place. First of all when I was reading the reviews for this place I had to try it out, but when I got to the restaurant I saw that there health department gave them a B. Now that kind of scared me for a bit because if this is a great place to eat I hope the place is clean also. The Ramen broth had no flavor what so ever I had ordered extra fat, but kind of a bad Idea felt like crap afterwards. The only thing I like about this place is you get to have the option to have a bigger size bowl, but why would I want a bigger bowl of ramen I don't really like. Service was OK I've had better at different places. The waitress here had some nice crazy hair I think they permed it to make it fluffy, but really heavy on the accent.   I'm pretty much not coming here again unless they change ownership or change the broth flavor.

Unfortunately the tremendous hype for Daikokuya made my disappointment that much greater after I ate there. The broth I will say was very soothing and comforting, but the compliment stops there. The noodles we less than tender, the appiteazers were not quite what was described, and the rest of the ramen ingredients were no where near memorable. To top off the less than impressive meal, you have to find parking in downtown LA to eat here and be disappointed. Needless to say. I will not be returning to Daikokuya.

This place is PRETTY DAMN GOOD. Ordered the Daikokuya ramen and the Tsukemen (DIY dip chilled noodles/ingredients into ramen broth), and both were deliciousss. The fatty pork slices were so indulgent, and the noodles were perfectly Q/al dente. We just melted into our seats (and plus it was super hot out). They make good ramen, so just brave the 30-min wait or whatever and treat yourself :) Their fried spicy tuna's not bad either, just nothing fantastic. Servers were quick and friendly, though they kept speaking to us in Japanese so I just nodded and bowed every time.

After much resistance to coming here due to the crazy amount of reviews and knowing I'd have way high expectations, I finally cracked and decided to hit this place up, since we were in the mood for some hot noodles. Surprisingly enough, we went after Artwalk and only waited maybe 15 minutes tops, before getting seated at the bar. Servers were on point and helpful with ordering and explaining what was what. Decided to might as well go with their staple dish, so had the Daikoku ramen and the shredded pork bowl. The ramen was pretty flavorful and were generous with their servings of ingredients. And the shredded pork bowl was also pretty good. Overall, definitely some good ramen, seeing that I wasn't let down as bad as I thought I'd be. My only complaint is the lack of spiciness, but to be fair, I'm one to believe that the spiciness in food is "just right," when my nose is uncontrollably running and my eyes are drenched in tears...

The old school japanese diner decor is fantastic. It was busy as hell in that small place. Luckily we arrived just before a line started to file in for early dinner. Most of the crowd seems to be of a younger hipster variety. The place definitely has a great electric vibe to it. I found this ramen to be good, but it didn't reveal anything new to me about ramen noodles. The milky base was spicy, but just ever so slightly. I was expecting from all the descriptions something along the lines of the insane rich creaminess of Santouka (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…) in San Jose, CA, but it more fell in line with the slightly spicy Yotekko-Ya (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…) in Honolulu, HI sans the fantastic mind-blowing five-star cha siu. I did like the fact that there was plenty of other toppings to go with it. It was also definitely filling. Honestly, I'm on the fence about a four star vs three, but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt. The service has a feel like stepping into an old school truck stop diner except with hip Japanese girls instead of a colorful old lady named Flo. I'll leave it at that. Word of warning, watch your step while going to the bathroom, it is a bit slippery. Parking is on the street or one of the lots in the area.

Well, to be one of thousands... I won't be writing a hater review, but the first thing that comes to mind is Public Enemy's chorus--Don't believe the hype [Hype, Hype, Hype]. Don't believe the hype... I must say, when I saw over 2000 reviews for this place, I had to try it. How could a place have that many reviews?! I dreamed of this experience for 5 whole days before making the trek up there, so I'll be the first to admit that this review is on super high expectations, perhaps unreasonable ones... -The wait was long, but not unbearable--good company helped. -The service was quick, friendly, attentive--a pleasant surprise. -Although it has a B rating, it looked clean from a diner's perspective. -The $6 large Sapporo was nice! -And now to the ramen itself: Good--the egg was perfectly cooked; the noodles were soft but still had a bite to them; the pork was thinly sliced and melted in my mouth, but sadly I was only given 2 slices; the green onions were fresh; and the broth was good. I've had worse, but I've had better... Note, there are some reviews that discuss Daikokuya's inconsistency, so I'll definitely give it another shot, but until that next visit, Santouka's (LA AND Costa Mesa) Special Pork Ramen kills the Daikokuya Kotteri Ramen. Happy Ramen!

Ramen is what they're known for here, but the ramen broth is made with pork, so I didn't try it, and maybe my review is lower for that reason... I ordered sushi and a tempura bowl with miso soup. The sushi was not very good and the miso soup came with one (one!) piece of tofu. The tempura bowl was excellent. On the menu, it said it came with four pieces, but it was loaded up when I got it- maybe they had extra and hooked it up? :)   The staff was really great, but the place is very small and I'm not sure if I would wait 30 minutes to eat there again. Also, the prices are slightly more expensive here than at the Monterrey Park location. If I go back to this location, it would be to get the tempura, and hope the portion wasn't a one-time exception...

This is probably the best ramen I have ever had. I hate soup and I loved the soup that came with the noodles. The soup is made by simmering the beef bones in a stock for i think they said 3 days? But the point is you can definitely taste the beefiness of the broth. In fact, the broth was so good that I asked for a bowl of rice to mix into it. It wasn't too salty and had an ABSOLUTE TON of beefy flavor in it. It's basically what would happen if  you could dry age soup like you could a steak. Definitely ask for the super meaty broth (has more fat in it). You won't regret it. And the noodles were a revelation to me. I never actually knew ramen was made from fresh egg noodles. Now I do! I loved the texture of the fresh ramen noodles. The noodles were soft and tender, yet still a little chewy. They didn't soak up all the broth and get fat like the fried ramen noodles you get from bags (phew). Yum, will definitely be coming back here

This place needs no rave reviews from me; I frequent this location at least once a month. No doubt - I love ramen. I love Daikokuya ramen. So why review? Well, each time I've gone to Daikokuya to eat, I've noticed a several individuals who commit offenses that are horrendously annoying and go against common manners. 1 - Waiting in the walkway in between the door of the restaurant and the street. I know that people want to check which number they are and how fast the list is moving, but do so and then vacate the area. That is the only walkway in and out and when people wait in there it's really rude. 2 - Properly disposing your cigarette - it's called a trash can. Don't throw it on the ground. 3 - Surprise! Lines are long here. Let's keep things moving by -following- the rules, which is located next to the sign in sheet. Just remember - your entire party must be present to be seated. Remember to bring cash because Daikokuya often has nights when their card machine is down. 4 - And lastly, as my boyfriend was witness to this: he and his friends managed to squeeze in for kitchen last call and immediately after they were seated, the wait-staff turned the open sign to closed. Lo and behold some fools come in five minutes after the sign is flipped to closed and asked to be served. C'MON. Take notes people, and everyone can have a good time. :P

I would drive from SF to LA at $5-a-gallon just for a slice of tender pork in their Daikokuya ramen.  It is that good.   Once there stand in line for as long as it takes, it is worth the wait.  Seriously, as I'm writing this review, I'm thinking of driving to LA to slurp the oh so goodness of Ramen at Daikokuya.   There are several locations in SoCal .  I've been to the little Tokyo and Monterey Park locations and both were AWESOME!  There's always a wait and once seated don't expect much of a "decor experience".  The experience is the Ramen itself.   By the way, the shredded port rice bowl is also very delicious.

We have a group of 5 and the place has no where to fit this group size but the bar or the last table at the front...waited over an hour. Ordered a sausage and a combo with pork cutlet. I like the sausage but it's nothing really impressive.. may be after the long waiting. Combo come with a salad that the dressing is a bit special.

Hmm...I have to admit that the ramen here was just ok. I think my preception of the place just went down when I first walked in.... IT STUNK! The room seriously smelled like sewage or dirty water. It seriously was not pleasing to the senses as I gobbled down a bowl of their famous pork ramen. The boiled egg in the soup complemented the pork broth and noodles. I loved how it was hot enough, but not scorching to my tongue and palates.... My bf ordered their "fatty" version of the pork broth, and it was just too fatty for my taste... I probably would not go back here again. I just felt so dirty when I left....=/

What do you do for a 500th review? I have seen this milestone approaching for a while and wasn't quite sure what to do -- is it worth some sort of acknowledgment? Is it time to hang them up and move on to something else? Hunker down and see if it is possible to hit 1,000 in less time than the first 500 reviews....I'm not quite sure I am ready to answer any of those questions....but I am very happy that Daikokuya was my 500th review. I do love ramen. In 2008, I posted about Momofuku (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…) -- my first experience with Momofuku was a game changer -- later visits turned out not to be as satisfying, but that first bowl of ramen at Momofuku was a very special experience. Menkui Tei (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…) I go to Menkui Tei almost every time I go to New York. The regular ramen is good, but the Jar-Jar Ramen is what keeps me coming back again and again.... Ippudo (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…) Another contender and also very good... That all being said, all of the previously mentioned places are in NY. I can now say I have a favorite on the left coast and it rivals my favorites in NY. Daikokuya Sliced Roast Pork Seared kurobuta pork belly chashu with sweet glaze and green onions. You can tell this dish is delicious just by looking at the picture. The pork belly is tender and flavorful -- more than enough for a meal for 1 person for only $5.95. Daikoku Ramen Tonkotsu (pork bones) soup with our secret blended soy sauce, chijire style egg noodles, kurobuta pork belly chashu, marinated boiled egg, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, green onions and sprinkle of sesame seeds. Ask for the richer, kotteri flavor which uses added soup extracted from the back fat. All 3 of us were in agreement that the broth was richer with better flavor. Really like their ramen noodles -- some spring, good thickness and texture...plus a great value at $8.95. The fact that it is a bit of a whole in the wall with great service only adds to its charm. Will return.

Yum. This place was good. I don't know if it's "As good as it gets!" but it's pretty damned good. Yeah. I'm just gonna echo what everyone else said: yummy pork, great broth, mmmmmmmmmmm omg why don't I live right next to this place..... mmmmmmmm.... I came to Daikokuya Ramen searching for "good ramen" and they did not disappoint. The coleslaw-ish salad thing is damned good too. And they had shredded pickled ginger to top the ramen... and the pork just melted in my mouth... and the noodles were firm and springy and chewy... and... and... and... We didn't wait long (just two of us) and we were willing to sit at the counter along with all the single guys and one couple. Yeah. I think ramen should be a get-in-get-out kinda experience, like fast food, so I don't mind sitting at the single-guys counter. There was another party of 2 just ahead of us who wanted a table, and they sat fairly soon after us, but there was pretty much a wait the entire time we were there. So yeah. They satisfied the "good ramen" craving.

This is as good as my favorite ramen place in BFE (Rokuan in Chino Hills). I'm just a stupid honkey so no idea how this compares to Japan, but I like the thick noodles and tasty broth. Large Sapporo (20 oz) for six bucks. 8.50 for ramen bowl. Plenty fillingI would come back, if the wait  wasn't an hour long on a Wenesday night.

After waiting about an hour, we finally manage to wedge our way into this tiny establishment and sit down.  I got my order of Ramen and stared at the patterns the globs of pork oil was making in my broth.  I steel myself, take a bite and YUM!!!  A delicious,  slightly salty, rich broth and noodles melts in my mouth.   Ramen is Yum.  Fried rice is yum.  Potstickers are ehhh.   -1 stars for the ridiculous wait.  Really good ramen but not good enough for a 1 hour wait.

Daikokuya is my favorite ramen stop in all of Little Tokyo. Simple, savory ramen. Their gyoza is reaaaaaally good too! It is always served piping hot with fresh green onions and dipping sauces. HANDY TIP: For new comers, they have a clipboard with a sign-in sheet on a chair that is right in front of you when you enter. If the place is full you write down how many in your party and if you want counter, table or either. Then chill out and they will call you.

i dont really understand why people like this place so much. The ramen is totally unimpressive. The vibe is stale and weird. Its totally crowded all the time and not worth the time it takes to walk from the metro station. I came here with a friend who is a vegeterian, so ramen was out of the question for her. She had some tempura and cucumber rolls and was not very pleased with it. My ramen was very middle of the road, I dont like the broth they use and the noodles are boring with a slightly tough texture. The pork that they use wasnt great either. The service is good. I guess maybe i found the one type of food whose authenticity isnt favored by my palate. Give me Kyu Shyu any day of the week.

Y & I are in SoPas when we decide that on this oddly global warmingly warm mid-January evening (not to rub it in to those who live on the east coast) that we wanted some Ramen.  Even a long wait then, but still completely worth it.  I always feel bad for all the other restaurants nearby that are nearly empty.. The Gyoza and pork bowl are delicious to share. Long wait=stores in the plaza get to make some extra cash as all the wait-listers stroll through.

So went another late night ramen binge with two friends. Everyone was awake and ready to eat so we made the short drive out to little Tokyo for some delicious Daikokuya. I had the friends drop me off in front so I could put out name in while they parked. The wait took about 15-20 which is pretty typical at this time of night. Once we got in a waiter was at our table within minutes to take out order. I ordered the Daikokuya "kotteri" combo with the pork cutlet bowl and my partner in crime got the same dish. I was so jealous watching all the other patrons slurp away that  I just couldn't take it. I had to keep my composure. Luckily The service here is always super fast. Within a minute my salad(combo) was out and a minute later so was my ramen.  The pork cutlet bowl took another couple minutes which was no problem because it was amazing ! Perfectly breaded fried pork with egg and some magical Japanese mayonnaise-ishsauce on a bed of grilled onions and white rice. I really enjoyed this dish ! My ramen was almost as delicious as always although I do have to say it had a little less saltiness than normal. http://www.yelp.com/user… Either way it's all good. I still humbly think that Daikokuya is the ramen champion of LA.

Expensive for ramen but also very tasty.   HOT! SO HOT! I was dying HOT!  So it's hot inside, and on a hot day your face starts to melt, which was the day we went and I had to keep picking my face up off the floor.   Now I see why it's more crowded at night time when it's cold out side. What can I add after 1000 other people?   Um, Dress like you are going to a hot and sweaty club where it's humid and 100 degrees, or go on a cold cold day.  Then get the cold noodles and a nice cold beverage. ALSO, if you don't get your food after you see about 5 other people get theirs, tell the waitress they probably forgot it. Ramen is greater than gyoza is greater than fried rice is greater than pork cutlet.

I really don't understand all of the hype. It's a fine bowl of ramen (meaning passable), but it's soooo greasy! I find it hard to enjoy the broth because of all of the grease floating on top and coating my lips. It's hard to enjoy the noodles because of everything they throw in with them. I just don't see why the wait is so long for their ramen when it's just ok. I prefer so many other shops in the LA area over this and am happy that there's a Shinsengumi now one block over. Win! I do like their gyoza here though - they're also greasy but the crispiness is goooood.

Daikokuya can do no wrong!  I love to go there after catching a performance in the downtown area because is just so convenient.  The vibe is casual, warm and cozy.  It's  even better to order a hot sake during winter with friends...  good times!!   They got a great menu in here esp. the ramen broth soup base.   Usually I ate the ramen and then I drank the entire ramen broth soup every time so there's not a drop left in the bowl.   I lick them dry!! lol

Wow, my friends weren't joking when they said there would be a long line for this on Friday evening. After waiting forever, I ordered the Daikoku ramen + small fried rice combo, which came with a salad (it had way too much dressing). By the end of the night, I was completely full and happy given the price. While I agree Daikokuya's ramen is good, I can't say it's the best. The servings are huge, but I feel like it's too simple (i.e., there are a lot of noodles and not much of anything else like more pork, braised pork, fried chicken, corn, kimchee, etc...). Maybe it's a norcal vs socal thing, but I've always felt that norcal ramen had a better assortment/balance of ingredients in their ramen. Having more ingredients is also a personal preference, but regardless, I will come back to Daikokuya in the future.

This place has really good food and I totally understand why people wait.  I am only giving it 3 stars because we waited for a LONG time and we were starving.  Not to mention that when I went to check on our name, after 45 minutes, somebody crossed off my name.  We were right in front of the restaurant so we couldn't have missed our name. Anyways, the food is delicioso.  The broth is indeed the bomb because it was creamy and so juicy.  I think I would like to just buy a gallon of broth :)  Sitting at the counter made me feel like I was in a ramen place in Japan.  Awesome!!!

Woah... finally made it to Daikokuya after years of driving bys and word-of-mouth recommendations... it wasn't easy by any means, I was 'forced' to get there by foot from many many blocks away on a cold autumn evening... and when we finally arrived, of course, a small crowd gathered outside waiting, as if its popularity need to be proven!  sigh... I secretly wished people would become impatient and leave, so we'd move up in the queue, but nope, one solid hour of waiting time! luckily the food didn't disappoint!!!!! We ordered a spicy tuna roll for appetizer (surprisingly delicious), Daikoku Ramen and the new Ki Chi Ramen.... I love love loved the Daikoku Ramen, so complexly flavorful, not overly oily or salty, reminded me of home and warmth :P  Ki Chi Ramen was interesting, the soup base was sweet and sour as described, definitely worth a try, but I think I am under the spell of Daikuku Ramen for now :) Have to figure out a time to avoid the crowd, but definitely a MUST TRY :) Santouka is also good, but I think I prefer Daikokuya over Santouka :) hehe

A good friend and his beau came in from out of town a few days ago, which I always love because it's an excuse to be a tourist in my own city.  I decided to dig into my boomarked restaurants and pick one to try out.  After whispering the word "ramen" to myself, Adrien looked at me with a sparkle in his eyes and I figured I didn't have to dig any deeper.   We parked at the Japanese Village Plaza because I couldn't find any metered parking.  $10 for over two hours, and may I just say, it ::will:: take that long to eat at Daikokuya.  We came in on a Tuesday afternoon (about 1 p.m.) and waited and waited and walked and waited some more... then we waited some more and sat down while we waited, staring at people slurping their delicious ramen noodles... rude?  yes... but very unavoidable.  No one in our party had eaten in about five or six hours and at one point I ::had:: to sit down because I was getting light headed.  Once our name was called and we settled into our booth, it was like a huge load had been lifted from my shoulders because I could finally stop starving my guests.   We ordered the tsukemono to start and these pickled radishes and whatnots were so delicious.  We all ordered one of the ramen combos.  There was tempura combo, unagi combo, fried rice combo and I ordered the tonkatsu combo. The ramen itself was HUGE.  I mean, super huge.  The pork is so soft and delicious.  The broth is silky and has great body to it.  The noodles themselves are really good, and plentiful!  I loved the hard-boiled egg inside the bowl. I honestly made it through half of my ramen, if that.  It's just so much ramen! I merely tasted my pork cutlet, but it was definitely delicious.  (I just had the leftovers for dinner and wasn't disappointed.)  Oddly enough, my absolute most favorite thing I had was the pork fried rice.  Holy fuck... that stuff was soo good.  It had little cubes of pork in it, and although it was fried rice, it was so light!  I will definitely be getting an order of that next time I want to wait an hour and a half for lunch... We had a lot of leftovers and although the ramen was delicious, it is definitely the most delicious when it is freshly served.  I do wish the ramen itself would have been a bit hotter... but all in all... it is definitely worth the wait.

I am glad yelp does not post home addresses here. For me, the ramen was just okay. Perhaps because of the hype I was expecting more. There is nothing wrong with the ramen I had here, but on the same hand, for me, there was nothing that set them apart from other ramen that I have had. Yeah, it is better then say a Terri's Cafe, but not something I (again my opinion) would  wait an hour in line for.

About a year ago, my wife and I began a quest to find the best Ramen in Los Angeles. We started at Daikokuya and then went everywhere else. If you want to embark on such a quest, I would strongly recommend holding off on eating here.  Do you know how frustrating it was to find the best Ramen on our first try? Simply put, the Ramen here is truly fantastic, and it all starts with their magnificent broth.  You taste it, knowing that it must be terrible for your body, because it tastes that good. The noodles are great, and the Chasu literally melts in your mouth. My only criticism is a lack of consistency in terms of the Chasu, our first time was mindblowing, the 2nd and 3rd times were wildly different.  But the broth is always magical. Definitely the best Ramen in the whole Los Angeles Area

Me full from ramen?  Don't know how it happened but it did and I was crazily thinking that if I wasn't full I could go for some Kogi afterwards...boy I was wrong. Well things I like about this place: - great service - light yet tasty soup broth - chashu pork maintains a roasted taste while being submerged in soup - soy marinated, soft-boiled egg.  Creamy but not runny yolk. - combination meals (tempura and unagi are good, from what I've tried) Don't like: - long wait!  Even on a thursday night! - salad, its pretty meh but I'll eat it - parking sucks That's about it, but man I've feeling stuffed so I should finish this before I fall into food coma.

The absolute best Ramen Ive ever had. 5 Stars because this Ramen really is as good as it gets here in LA. Been here more than a dozen times and it always fills me up! Very friendly staff. Great atmosphere. Good Price. The pork bone broth is very good and tasty and the pieces of pork floating in the Ramen are so soft and tender it melts in your mouth. The soft boiled egg is by far my favorite part and is always delicious. The noodles are right in between soft and firm, and although i cant say I'm a Ramen connoisseur, they are great in my honest opinion. Only negative is the wait is usually 45minutes at minimum for a party of 2-3

Another ramen champion from LA. The combo ramen with a side is too good of a deal to pass up. After a full day of drinking and fun at disneyland, this meal hit the spot. more like beat it up, cuz this shiz was on point. My friends native to LA told me we got lucky because we didn't have to wait. Sure enough after we got seated, a big ass group came and they had to wait. Lucky us. The ramen...simply amazing. It's hard to call this one better than the other spots I love. I'll just say that it stands at the top with my 2 other fave spots (santouka@mitsuwa and himiwari@san mateo). To sit up top among the ranks of those two spots, you deserve a certificate of flavorful achievement. Congratulations Daikokuya, you win

Ate the "hands down best ramen ever" today with my sister. Um, so far it is the best. But ramen is not one of my top 10 or even 15 fav foods, so it doesn't even matter. Luckily, we went at an awkward hour, around 4:30pm, to eat a very belated lunch. I accidentally signed my name on the clipboard, and when I looked up, I realized the place was half empty. Half of the half were the workers, who were sitting around eating ramen, too! I'm surprised they aren't sick of it. Service was excellent & quick (at that particular time). Both ordered the famous Daikoku Ramen. It's pretty delish! Broth is flavorful altho salty, love the generous servings of green onions & bean sprouts, and the fatty pieces of pork are given in the right amount. Side dishes or something else for my chopsticks to grab would have been nice. Eating only ramen gets tiring, seriously. Glad I tried it once. That's sufficient for me!

Love this place, don't love the wait you'll find probably 95% of the time you come here. The Daikokuya Ramen is amazing. But my favorite thing is the Pork Belly Bowl. It is amazing and probably something I'd want to eat as my last meal on earth. Mmmm. This location doesn't let you do take out for the ramen.

I FINALLY got to taste the ramen! The line is always soooo long so either I get very impatient or I'm starving so I never get to eat there. I ordered the combo (teriyaki chicken + Daikokuya ramen) and boy was it a great deal.  The pork is just so tender and the broth is just perfect...not too heavy. I couldn't finish the ramen so I took it home for lunch the very next day. Believe it or not, it was still delicious!   The wait is absolutely a turn off. I recommend going very late at night during the weekdays or very early before dinner rush.

Try the shredded pork bowl if you're less into ramen.  Boys will probably go crazy for this dish like all my guy classmates did.  Meat + green onions + rice  = Greasy tasty goodness.

Ehh... it was OKAAAY.  I'm not a big ramen person so I don't know why I always get suckered into trying these places.  Ramen is pretty much just soy sauce soup for me. Daikokuya is a step up from your average ramen, however.  You can tell they definitely spend more hours simmering their stock and the broth is quite rich.  But it's still doesn't come close to pho, soon du boo, Thai boat noodles, or udon.  It's a second string Asian soup for me, though Daikokuya is better than the norm for sure. I tried the cold noodle salad too.  It was just okay.  The dressing was a bit sour, it wasn't enough for the amount of noodles I got, and the fresh produce tasted a little off (old).

Missed the crowds by coming here on a saturday afternoon after a long morning of apartment hunting. And what a way to treat myself after hours of asking about deposits, and utilities, and whether a fridge is included (which by the way is ridiculous). I ordered the Daikokuya Ramen pork cutlet combo and when the bowl of katsudon came out, it was a descent size portion! I love it when restaurants aren't stingy. And lets not forget about the Ramen. Mouthwatering. I'm not sure if it was miso based, or soy, but it...was... satisfying. Note. There is a counter that you can sit at if you don't want to wait for a booth. If you do decide to sit there, avoid sitting in front of the two huge vats of simmering broth which they use for their ramen, unless you want pit stains and shweaty balls, both of which I walked out the restaurant with. Other than that, you should enjoy a dry shirt ramen eating experience at Daikokuya. 4 Stars Daikokuya!  Irasshaimaseeeeee!

I hate you Daikokuya. Ever since i ate here, ramen has never tasted the same. They set the standard too high!! Im pretty sure this place is packed from open to close so be prepared to wait for at least half an hour if your planning to eat here. The place is kinda small so i wouldn't suggest it for big groups. I got the shredded pork bowl with Kotteri Daikoku Ramen. First thing that arrived was the salad. I think it was like thousand island dressing with minced garlic, i think i licked the bowl until i realized the waitress was staring at me =| ! Next came the shredded pork bowl which was also amazing! The pork was really soft and it was a pretty big portion. Finally, the ramen arrived. I had to wait in line for about 2 hours so when the ramen got to my table i think i almost cried. The broth is made out of pork fat i believe which gives it a really rich flavor. It comes with a few pieces of pork, the same that was in the shredded pork bowl. The noodles were perfectly cooked and as we would say in chinese, it was very " CUE CUE" :) I would walk to LA just to eat here. OPEN UP A STORE IN THE BAY AREA

Heard the hype about this place and immediately believed it after being asked to wait at 11pm on a Tuesday. 2000+ ratings @ 4 stars with only 1 real ramen choice on the menu, I was expecting a lot.  The Daikokuya ramen is amazing on many levels, the broth is light yet flavorful while the noodles were soft with a nice amount of chewy.  The chashu had a nice flavor but I was hoping for a much softer texture.  Overall, I was impressed but the ramen never brought a smile to my face, it was definitely missing a kick of spiciness.  The individual ingredients were good, they blended well, but without the star, the ramen was fairly boring.  Sadly, the most impressive part of my meal was the fried rice, surprisingly delicious. I can tell that this place has put a lot of effort into their ramen, but unfortunately, without spice, the ramen is just too boring for me.

The wait for two last night was like an hour, but I don't really blame them for being popular. Here's what I do blame them for: UNREMARKABLE RAMEN. Sorry. I had the kotteri ("extra rich/flavorful") and she had the standard daikoku, and it's not that great. Dry pork with no skin. Bland broth. Soft noodles. I've had way too many awesome experiences at places like santouka, shin sen gumi and mottanai in Gardena for me to ever care to come here again. The gyoza was good, though.

I was disappointed with this spot, simply because it was OVER RATED. This was my first time visiting.  I can't knock the food here.  The ramen is tasty.  The noodles are probably some of the best I've tried.  But I expected a lot more. A LOT more, something like the holy grail of ramen noodles.   I came to Daikokuya because of the hype.  So many people recommended this place.  I waited 45 minutes on a Sunday afternoon to get inside.  I witnessed people come in surprised to see such a long wait list and leave disappointed, heads down.  This phenomenon made me want to STAY in line and endure the wait.  This was ridiculous, for a bowl of ramen? C'mon! I ordered the gyoza (good, nothing spectacular and hypeworthy), I ordered the pork rice bowl (good, but again, nothing to wait in line 45 mintues for).  I'm a fan of Flame Broiler, and it reminded me of a mini version with some special magic sauce.  They were both good.   The ramen portion is very generous.  It's perfect for me, because I can dust a large bowl of ramen no problem.  Just keep the portion in mind if you're going to order appetizers and sides. My friend, who usually eats cookies and cakes for breakfast and chicken wings in his sleep couldn't get through an entire bowl. Great spot to try and see for yourself, but definitely not OMFG THE BEST RAMEN status. I feel bad for Mr. Ramen down the street.  That place gets no love. (cricket, cricket....tumbleweed)

Been to a few ramen places and this one definitely takes the cake (or ramen in this case). Santouka, Shinsengumi, Ajisen, Hanashima, other Daikokuya locations, etc. Daikokuya in Little Tokyo wins. Their 1940s Japanese-American diner style is entertaining. Even the Godzilla guarding the inside of the entrance door. Their broth is aaaaaaallllllways good. Meaty, thick, and savory. Especially delicious when I pile on the spicy Japanese chili powder (what can I say, I love spicy food). The chashu will almost always be melt-in-your-mouth (the way it should be) and the egg that comes with the ramen is cooked just right.  The tuna sashimi bowls you can get as appetizers or combinations with the ramen are my favorite. You can never go wrong with their fried rice if you're simply too impatient for that steaming bowl of ramen to arrive. Service is always prompt. Of course there's usually a long wait, but the Japanese anime/goth store next door and the little Japanese village across the street usually provide enough entertainment until your table is ready. Be warned if you try to bring more than 4 people. 6 is about the biggest party I've ever brought there because the restaurant and tables are small. Otherwise you can sit at separate tables or find some seats at the bar by splitting up your group. Price usually ends up being about $10 for me when I just get the ramen. With a drink like green tea about $12 and about $15 if I get a combination. Greatest thing about this particular Daikokuya is that it's usually open later than its' other locations. Well worth the drive. Park in the Office Depot lot if you don't want to pay for parking.

I've tried places in NYC and DC but nothing compares.  I'd fly to California just for Daikokuya.   Also, I recommend going early b/c when I went at 11am, a line was starting to form around 11:30.  True sign of a great Ramen House!

Be prepared to wait...and wait...and wait... I was always willing to wait an hr+ for this spot and insisted all my friends try it. This place is pretty good when compared to other ramen shops and used to be my favorite until I was introduced to Ramen Dojo in San Mateo.   The first few times were great, but I definitely left unsatisfied the last time I had gone.  I've heard from many people that this place is a hit or miss depending on the day you go, and I must have gone on an off day. What makes this place "better" than the other ramen shops is the fact that they have amazing fried rice to accompany your ramen order.  You WILL leave this place full (and tired) if you're able to finish the entire combo since the portions are generous. Great place to go if you're in the area!

Why do I keep coming back to this place when I find myself dropping Daikokuya's rating by 1 star every time I go? Well, contrary to what others may say, I don't think their food is that crazy good at all. This was one of the first times the 3 of us have passed by and saw no line out front. Parking in J-Town always sucks, so my friend dropped 2 of us off to grab a table and order for him while he looked for parking. 2 of us were present, and the 3rd was on his way from the parking spot. It kinda bothered me that the they gave us a hard time saying that we couldn't be seated until EVERYONE was present...they proceeded to seat the couple that came in AFTER us first!!...We finally talked her into giving us a table...but it did take some coersion and telling her that we were ordering for the other buddy. My friend ordered their house ramen, and once again the egg was cold, and the noodles were a bit hard/undercooked. He had to let sit for a couple minutes so it would cook until it he could eat it. The other homie and I ordered fried rice...The dish was lacking any form of substantial meat and flavor. I had to add quite a bit of soy sauce to eat it....just doesnt compare to good ol' Thai style Fried Rice! The gyoza was good...but 5 small ones for 6 bux. $40.00 for 2 fried rices, a ramen, and 5 pieces of gyoza!?!? thats a pretty high price to pay for some rice and noodles....2.5 stars..

Yep, it's ramen. We waited an hour and a half. For a bowl of soup. When we finally sat down, we ordered and were pleasantly assured by our meal that it was ramen. It is very good ramen, no doubt. It's ramen, though. Did I mention we waited an hour and a half? I know Jonathan Gold exploded his spooge all over this place, so everyone has come out of the woodwork to eat at place with 6 booths, one table, and some counter seats. It feels almost like a residence that started cooking for guests and now they have a restaurant. It's a great inside. Great ramen. Loved the sausage appetizers. The wait for a bowl of soup was RIDICULOUS. We didn't get our food until after 9pm. I feel like there are probably 87 of these places in New York and they seat you right away. Tokyo Town is for sure authentic, but it's like one street. This was the ONLY place people were crowded around as if they were vying to get a glimpse of Christ beyond the entrance drapes. And to the party of 7 that showed up. Go fuck yourselves. Don't come here with 7 people, you stupid bastard fuckheads. Go the Cheesecake Factory. Anyway. Ramen was great. But really ask yourself. How bad do you want ramen? Really bad? Really, really bad? Okay. Then maybe come here.

This is easily the 2nd best ramen that I've had in the US (First being Ippudo). For comparison purpose, I've had ramen in Shinsengumi, Santa Ramen, Halu Ramen & Maru Ichi before. I haven't tried Santouka yet but it's because I've had it in Tokyo & it's available where in my home country (Singapore). For me, rating a ramen place isn't that hard. There should be 3 main categories: 1) Noodles, 2) Broth, 3) Meat and an optional 4th category for side dishes. Daikokuya's noodles are decent, nothing special. Their soup is fantastic. You can feel the fattiness of the pork and that it really has been boiled/cooked for a long time. And if you're a garlic lover like me, you'd love the minced garlic that they provide on the table. And...*drumroll*...The thing that sets Daikokuya apart from any other ramen places I've been to so far is their CHASHU. It was just out of this world. Super tender, right amount of fattiness and not dry at all. Some other stuff: 1) Their tsukemen isn't half bad either 2) We reached there by 11:30 on a Thursday night and there was still about 7 people lining up. I can't freaking imagine the queue on a weekend lunch/dinner time. And we were also the last person to be served, they had to reject a few other parties because they ran out of noodle. 3) I had the large portion and I'm wondering if they just use a bigger bowl and add more soup compared to their regular portion. The bowl looks bloody humongous but there really wasn't that much noodle/chashu in it, just some insane amount of soup.

I have already expressed my love for Daikokuya's rich tonkotsu ramen on the Costa Mesa Daikokuya page, so I think now I will move onto other dishes that the Costa Mesa store doesn't have. Daikouya has a variety of dishes other than ramen. I especially like their fried spicy tuna and yakisoba. Other dishes such as tonkatsu and fried rice were pretty good. One BAD point about Daikokuya is their tsukemen's quality. Honestly it may be something to try since tsukemen in US is so rare, but seriously all Daikokuya gives you is ramen with the noodle on a separate dish, rather than tasting like actual tsukemen. I have eaten tsukemen in Tokyo a couple of times, and it is so much better, but even if I don't compare it to Japan's level it is still not good enough an effort. I would have given it a 4...but since Daikokuya is not really known for its tsukemen anyway, I choose to ignore this one bad dish.

Best ramen in the city. A friend of mine took me there once and I haven't gotten the taste of that broth out of my mind since. At one point, I was going once a week. I shouldn't share this tip, but if you're really itching to try it, go alone. You'll get seated much faster. Ramen junky? Big on Japanese cuisine? This is the place for you...

The only time I've been (and I've been A LOT) when there wasn't a line was at 5pm, and no later (it gets crowded soon after for dinner). The place is half booths and half bar seats. They got a lot more variety now, but I always stick to the usual. If I'm feeling dangerous, I go for the kotteri flavor, which is basically extra fat in the broth. No good for my health, but so tasty! The ramen here is about the broth, I don't know how they make it so good. A bowl at about $8 or $9 comes with all the pork, bamboo, egg, bean sprouts, and green onions you need! You don't have to pay extra for these add-ons as most ramen places charge. The pork is melt in your mouth, and the egg is absolute perfection (not too cooked, but not runny). I like to get the combo, or at least share a combo, because it comes with a small bowl of salad and a rice bowl. Tthe salad is my favorite. I love the dressing! I've tried several bowls, and the only one I order consistently is the shredded pork bowl! The pork cutlet bowl is soggy, the chicken teri bowl is blah, the sashimi bowl is a disappointment. The fried rice bowl is the only other decent one. Also, the sliced roast pork appetizer seems like a good appetizer choice, but don't do it. It's enjoyable and all, but it's GASTRONOMICALLY REDUNDANT. It's practically the same pork as the ramen pork! PS. Prepare to leave feeling extremely dehydrated.

My absolute favorite ramen place in socal. Its worth the 2 hour wait in line outside haha. All you need to order there is the basic daikokuya ramen which will fill you up and they're homemade lemonade. They also serve teriyaki and other items but its best to stick with what its famous for.

I was told about this place by an old colleague a few years ago. I live 2 miles from it and my old lady was sick. We decided to give it a chance since it has received much acclaim. We went on a Wednesday and had to wait over an hour. I was hungry AND pissed so the review was off to a bad start lol. Once we sat we checked out the menu and it was limited so i thought to myself the few tings they do must be amazing as apposed to a giant menu and most is cooked half ass-ed. We both got the Daikokuya ramen which was amazing. We both agreed that it was the best ramen we both had ever had. The stock is what made the whole thing. It was rich and just seasoned to perfection. Not to salty and not to bland it was PERFECT. the egg was tasty as well. The noodles still had a little bite and the belly was thinly sliced. I also had a side of shredded pork which to me was even better than the ramen which speaks volumes. It's like carnitas with a sweet teriyaki sauce over it. The gyozas are amazing as well. The only complaint was the wait other than that nearly a flawless dining experience. P.s. I knew it would rock because the ratio of Asians to dickheads (hipsters) was 2/3.

Yes this place is great but the wait is less to be desired.. but if you do get the chance to get a seat you will not be dissappointed.. the broth is so tasty and I love the pork... the Summer cold noodles is really good also when its too hot outside...

In my elusive search for the best bowl of ramen, I was ecstatic when I discovered the ever-popular and much-raved Daikokuya.  My curiosity and appetite were peaked by the 3,000 reviews and 4-star rating, and I was eagerly awaiting my visit to this establishment to see whether it lives up to the hype, and whether it is better than Santouka (another super popular spot in Santa Monica). We got there around 11:30 a.m., just beating the lunch rush.  It's a small place with tables mostly seating 4, with about 10 additional counter space seating.   Excitedly, we ordered the fried rice combo that comes with a large bowl of Daikoku ramen and a half bowl Daikoku ramen with kotteri flavour (back fat added to the soup). I'll review the fried rice first. Fried rice yes, it was extremely delicious and lives up the hype even though it looks like any other bowl of fried rice.  I would come back to Daikokuya just for another bowl of this fried rice. The regular Daikokuya ramen The ramen was anti-climatic for me.  Maybe it's because of all the complimentary reviews here and the too well-written blurb describing how the soup is made, but I felt the broth was somewhat bland (although, I'm not sure if bland is the right word)... it was just missing something. The ramen with kotteri was much better, but because it's from back fat, it's more rich-tasting and therefore I wouldn't be able to drink a whole bowl of this. My curiosity has been satisfied.  Santouka's ramen still holds a special place in my heart and belly, and not likely to be overridden anytime soon. I would give Daikokuya 3.5 stars based solely on the ramen, but the delicious fried rice upped it to a 4. On another note, if you do visit this location, little Tokyo was an absolute pleasure to walk around.  There are many other hidden restaurants and cute little cafes just inside the plaza.

Spent more time trying to pay the meter while waiting to sit down to eat. This place may be awesome but not worth the time to waste half my day for. Not hating but I really hope that the owner will think how much more business they'd get if at least they make it more convenient for customers to come.

Best ramen I have ever had. The wait is really long here regardless of what time you happen to show up.  I have yet to see less than a 45 minute wait.  The soup base and noodles, are phenomenal.  Oh, btw.. you have to order the ramen soup with the extra fat. It makes it sooo much tastier.  =)

I was hoping it to be better but it was definitely worth the trip and the wait.  Compared to Orochon, I think this place is equal.  The decor is more interesting and authentic at Daikokuya, but that does not add to the taste. The ramen was great, don't get me wrong, but I was hoping for more.  It may be that I had Ramen Ya just recently (before Ramen Ya and Orochon I had not had ramen in months), and Ramen Ya is definitely my favorite ramen place so far.  I also had the gyoza at Daikokuya and they were great! So, in conclusion, the food here was excellent, the atmosphere was great, the smells were wonderful, the wait was long, the experience was enjoyable.  I will return.

Came here on a Saturday night with a friend at around 10PM.  There were a good number of other parties waiting before us.  I think we waited about an hour before we were seated at the bar-like set-up.  I felt dirty eating there, probably because we were sitting right next to all the supplies and condiments utilized by the wait staff. I ordered a combination with the daikoku ramen and small teriyaki eel bowl.  I came in with high expectations because SO many people talk about this place.  I have to say this place is exactly what my star rating says, A-OK. Space is tight.  Ramen is OK. Shin Sen Gumi is way better.  Teriyaki eel bowl tasted like every other Japanese place.

I'm just looking out for my health-conscious brothas and sistats. My sis got the famous ramen bowl and loved it and wants to come back blabla. And I had a sip and realized why everyone's addicted to it: the PORK FAT! the back fat of the pork to be exact lol I love fat, but that one sip was more than I could handle! So health-conscious people, be careful. It tasted like ramen with heavy bacon broth. And of course people are gonna love that, so I'm not hating on all the other rave reviews on the ramen. But I ordered the tuna sashimi bowl and it wasn't worth my $11. Although the tuna was deliciously fresh and cut thin..it was just a bunch of tuna slices on top of a bowl of rice (with a little sesame seeds and nori). I did like their homemade salad dressing a whole lot! Very creamy, mayo-based, and probably some yummy miso dressing too. Parking sucks! And I was there on a slow Thursday afternoon. It's either overpriced metered street parking OR ridiculously expensive parking structures. I recommend taking a bus lol jk Just carpool people it'll make for a better hang out time anyway! It's a small humble place where you would bring one or two friends to kick it with. Sweet fast customer service.

I'm so conflicted I dunno what to do. My friends and I went to Daikokuya yesterday to determine which wins in Daikokuya vs. Shinsengumi. 4 large + 1 half-size bowls of ramen later...I'm ready to hand the trophy to Daikokuya (though our group's still on the fence). For $8.50, you get a regular-sized ramen with plenty of chasu pork and one delicious soft-boiled egg. You can get the large size for $12.95...and it is LARGE. I think the diameter of the bowl was probably a foot (no joke) and is served in a bowl resembling those family-style soup bowls in Chinese restaurants. I've never seen these boys never finish a dish, and they all had to take home about half of the ramen...you get your money's worth. If you're not really hungry, get the half-size for $5.95 and still be pretty full by the end (and save some room for Fugetsudo or Yogurtland around the corner). The regular broth is much more flavorful, but the pork-fat version is so rich. It's really personal preference on which one, but I'd say try the pork-fat version at least once. They also offer combo dishes (the fried rice is delish!) with the ramen. But. There will probably always be a line. But they show Telemundo in the front while you wait. :)

Ok, I think this is the best ramen place I've had so far. I now order my noodles to my liking, which is soft most of the time. My friend had the extra back fat ramen??and that was very bold of her...she liked it but felt fat afterwards...duh~ The parking structures now charge $6. It's bad enough you can't find street parking and you have to wait so long. So make the most of it and hang out at the Far Bar a few doors east on the same block.

Hands down the BEST ramen I've ever had in the states. Recently coming back from Tokyo and experiencing the holy grail of ramen, Daikokuya was comparable and exceeded expectations. It's not one of those places where you can add a lil bit of this and a lil bit of that to your bowl (which btw, totally destroys the essence of Japanese ramen). They kept it traditional - noodles, pork, egg, and soup. You can order the kotteri to enrich the soup with more flavor, but the regular soup was perfect on its own. I love the fact that you have the option of ordering a half bowl (for you non-hearty eaters), but even though I didn't have much of an appetite at the time, I was forced to stuff myself silly with such deliciousness. We didn't care that it was 90 degrees outside and there was no AC inside the restaurant. Our meal victoriously ended in sweat dripping down our faces and our guts expanded to the max. Our mission was to finish every last bite and down all the soup...and we succeeded! We even drove 30 minutes out of the way just to come back here a second time before hittin the road for a 5 hr drive back home. I can now die and fly up to ramen heaven.

So, if you're savvy, get here exactly at six, when there's no line and street parking is FREE.  Otherwise, it's $3 per hour.  Seriously, LA?  Is this how you plan on getting our City out of debt? Anyhow, what the parking may taketh... the Daikokuya giveth.  I mean, these portions are not chinsey at all.  A regular serving is good for today and tomorrow.  And, the combination is good even for the day after that. I highly recommend the amazing ramen and pork combo.  Wow!  And, that pork belly in the broth... I should have taken a picture then asked it to marry me.  It was an equal layer of meat, then fat, then meat, then fat, then meat... on several slices and swimming in a bath of tranquil goodness.  It was beautiful.

If you come here for the first time, AT LEAST order the raumen.  I never understood the concept of going to a specialty restaurant only to order something completely different. Get the original raumen WITH kotteri, trust me.  Never get the XLARGE bowl only because it's the same amount of raumen in a bigger bowl, which is heart-shattering.  If you want to sit at a booth, you must request it unless you have a huge party or sometimes you're lucky you'll get it.  Otherwise, you'll have to sit at the bar and sweat your ass off from the steam in your face.  The great part is that it's an authentic B grade so you know it's good.

Although it's not my favorite ramen, it's still great! Gyoza was different than I am used to-still ok, but will probably not order it again. My friend and I each ordered the Daikokuya Ramen and fried rice combo. I love my ramen with boiled egg and bamboo-try it! Some people don't like it, but I liked that the egg was not fully cooked. Noodles are chewy and broth is rich; made me drink a lot of water during my meal. I like the ramen, I don't like the wait. No waiting if you arrive at 5:15pm, LONG wait if you arrive any time after that. There are not a lot of tables, so I don't think it's a good idea to bring a party bigger than 4. BTW, parking sucks. Should be expected, it is LA, right? You either pay or walk far, but that's okay on a nice night. One of the places I will visit when I go back to L.A., only after I eat at my favorite ramen place. (I LOVE Hakata Ramen Shinsengumi-yes I have to wait here too, but it's worth it)

My BF and I came here last night, Thursday night around 7:00pm, hardly any wait!! SWEET! We actually called ahead just to check how long the wait was before heading over to LA. The guy said 20 mins so why not..... We probably waited for 20 ~ 25 mins, but that's cuz we actually wanted a table. Yes, and of course, the wait was worth it. We got 2 Kotteri Daikoku ramens with extra pork belly slices and for the appetizer, we got the Kurobuta sausages. WOW!!! The kurobuta sausages DID NOT disappoint. YUM YUM YUM. They were so juicy and flavorful, and sooooooo nostalgic to Japan....for $4.95 you get 5 delicious pieces of sausage heaven...it's to die for. Then of course our ramens were delicious and sooo flavorful. Getting the extra pork was a plus! Extra yummy. The broth was amazing as usual, the egg was pretty good too. It was my BF's first time getting the ramen, I think he enjoyed it very much. We were out by 8pm! I'm coming on Thursdays from now on...

Believe the hype and try this place out! Their broth is seriously the best that I have ever, ever eaten in my life.  Forget all the other ramen places in the area, this is as good as it gets! My absolute favorite thing to eat here is the Daikoku Ramen with Kotteri flavor.  If you've never eaten here before, this is THE one to try.  The milky looking broth is just packed full of fatty, porky flavor.  Ohhh goodness, DAT FAT. If you're feeling hungry, I also recommend trying the shredded pork bowl (there's a combo).  The pork is so juicy, tender, and flavorful that it feels like it just melts in your mouth. The biggest downside to this place is how busy it gets.  Expect to wait AT LEAST a half hour on the weekends if you're here for dinner.  You might as well show up here when you're not so hungry and sign up on the waitlist so that by the time you're given a table, that hunger kicks in. Oh, also, street parking sucks, so if you're just in the area for ramen then things might get a little difficult.

I've had this as an unfinished review for about a month now?  I decided today was the day that I sit down and finally write my review, as if my one review will make any difference amongst the hundreds of reviews this place already has.   I've been to this Little Tokyo location as well as the Monterey Park one and both have had a significant wait time.  However, the service has always been good and the food has always been worth the wait.   They don't give you a checklist of options for your ramen like the SSG Hakata Ramen place I went to, but I still find this place to be better.  Here they automatically give you bean sprouts, boiled egg, flavored bamboo shoots and green onion slices in your soup along with the chasu pork at no extra cost!  The noodles are nice and chewy, with a nice curly texture which puts this place over SSG bc I really don't care for their straight noodles.   On the table or in front of you at the bar they have a condiment caddy with all the ginger and garlic you need.  I like to put a scoop of garlic in my hot soup the moment I get my order for some extra flavor and I like to eat the ginger bc my Korean ass needs kimchi or something like it when eating ramen.  And although they don't offer spicy miso (at least not to my knowledge..) its completely fine with me bc I just go crazy with their chili powder which does the trick.   I like to share the gyoza appetizer with whoever is dining with me, it always gets served sizzling hot with a mound of thinly sliced green onions that penetrate into the potstickers.  Even as they cool, the skin of the gyoza is crisp, never soft.   I have yet to try anything else here other than their ramen and gyozas, but I never leave regretting not trying anything new.  For someone who loves to eat, I usually order the small half size bowl, at first you might think its a dinky serving, but after you've finished your bowl clean you'll realize how full you really are.  So far no other ramen house compares to this place!

This place is really not that great.  We waited in line for almost an hour and parking was very difficult to find (granted we went on a Sunday afternoon).  To be fair, I am not one of those "I LOVE MEAT, I AM A CARNIVORE" people so maybe that's why I didn't care too much for the pork broth in the ramen.  It was very thick - not a refreshing liquid.  But I mean it has its own appeal and ramen tastes great almost all the time.   The thing that I actually really enjoyed was the fried rice that came with our meal.  I fell a little bit in love with it.  It was just a wonderfully salty addition to the meal that was a perfect complement.

I'm usually picky about my ramen.  From the saltiness of the broth, the texture of the ramen, the amount of chashu, to the firmness of the egg, it better be perfect.  This place has got it down to a science!  The proportion is large enough to leave me full for 2 hours (Ramen never filles me up).  The broth is thick the way I like it, the ramen is soft, and the egg was cooked perfectly.  Trust me, this is good ramen! The wait times on certain nights can be fatal if you're starving, keep that in mind. There's a baby doll up in the ceiling decoration above the entrance.  I don't like dolls.  Some of the pictures on the walls have freaky eyes that stare at you.  If you can get past that, then come enjoy some good food!

Oh my ancestors, this place's wait is on average about an hour, but every time I come, I know I'm having one of the best meals of my life. Plus, you know there's a reason why people line up for an hour. Even though the other shops have little to no waits. Even though there are other shops that are next door. Because no one can compare. My tip is sign your name in and wander into nearby shops. Just don't forget to come back to check your place. Also, try not to come with super large groups. It'll make life easier for you. This place is friggin amazing. They are best known for their house ramen special, the Daikokuya ramen bowl, that is so good, they had to give this ramen its own page on the menu with its story. Sure they add a little grease, but it makes the ramen broth so rich in flavor. It's hot and fresh when it comes out. The ramen noodles are nothing compared to the kind you get from instant noodles so no excuses not to try this restaurant! The ramen is great, yet there is another star on this menu--the shredded pork rice bowl. Its glaze on the pork is so unique, and the portion is enough for two meals. It's a small, cozy restaurant inside. You can get seated at the bar or at a table. The decor is reminiscent of old fashioned Japanese culture, but not the stereotypical stuff. This restaurant is a winner!

The yellow awning! The yellow awning! I'm sorry. If I'm ever a passenger in your car or if I'm driving and we go down 1st street in J-town, you would be all too familiar by now with this little place called Daikokuya because of me. Yes, the storefront with the yellow awning, that is, if you weren't distracted by the number of people waiting outside for a table. Small place, but the demand for it is big. Ever since my senior suggested this place back in 2008 for one of our lunch outings, Daikokuya comes to mind whenever I think of ramen. First timers should not even look at the menu and just order the Daikoku Ramen. I mean, that should be the sole reason why you would venture to this place. The ingredients seem so simple and basic, but wow, what a fantastic blend of yumminess. This is one ramen where you absolutely cannot pass up on finishing the soup. I swear, the soup makes the meal---the egg, the pork belly chashu, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, the noodles are all enhanced from this magical broth! If you want something more, their combinations provide you with your necessary order of Daikoku Ramen plus whatever else you might want to sample: the chicken egg bowl (reunion of mother and child! how morbid. haha.), the tuna sashimi bowl, or whichever other 7 options you want with your meal. And while ordering, take some time to read the menu. I love their descriptions of their meals! (They dedicate half a menu page for the ramen. the other half is for the summer version. haha)

My favorite ramen restaurant EVER (though I can't say that I'm some sort of ramen expert--I've never had "authentic" ramen from Japan)!!! This is our favorite spot in LA. If we can't decide on a place to eat, Daikokuya is our default. The wait, however, is horrendous (even on a weekday!), and we typically have to wait at least half an hour before we could get seated, but the ramen is well worth the wait. Their "specialty" ramen is Daikoku Ramen, and you HAVE to get it with "kotteri" flavor (which is literally pork back fat--yum!!). The Daikoku ramen has a tonkotsu soup base and it comes with tender pork belly chashu and a marinated boiled egg (I'm leaving out the other stuff, but the pork and the egg is where it's at!!). My mouth is salivating just writing about it. As for the appetizers, I've tried the gyoza and fried spicy tuna (spicy tuna wrapped in shiso leaves and then battered and deep fried!), both of which are really delicious and pretty unique compared to other ramen places. You just have to try it for yourself. And if you're really hungry, you can get a combination, which includes a bowl of the Daikoku ramen, a salad, and a small rice bowl. The ones I've tried are the chicken and egg; pork cutlet; tempura; teriyaki eel; and fried rice bowls. All of them are good and you can't go wrong with any of them. Though... the tempura one was just okay (basically a few tempura pieces atop a lot of rice). The ambiance of the place is great, too. It makes you feel like you're in a mom and pop ramen shop in Japan, with the decor that are essentially beer ads from the 50s. The restaurant is really cramped and small, but with ramen this good, who cares?? I especially love the goatee'd waiter that has a loud booming voice (I tell everyone that he sounds like an anime character), though I haven't seen him there the last few times I've been to Daikokuya. Sadness... All in all, the ramen is great, parking is sparse but there are parking garages (it IS downtown, after all), though I hope I haven't hyped up this place too much. It's just a must-try place if you happen to be in LA and/or love ramen!

YUM! I lovvveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed Daikokuya. I think this place has the best japanese noodles... even better than orochon. The broth is thick and the portions are HUGE! I couldn't finish the whole thing because it was just so heavy and so much. The only thing about this place is that the wait is freaking long especially on a weekend night. Oh, and the prices are very good.

Sacred sacred ramen. What you do is plan ahead for the waiting by heading to a nearby drinking bar for some sake. At night, be expected to wait 2, maybe 3, hours, and when you DO get in, you find yourself in something resembling an underground Japanese dive bar, and you're up close and personal with the kitchen staff. The stew this ramen is presented in is not to be wasted. Fresh veggies and an egg yolk float like prehistoric flora through the soup, and when you take a swig of the ice cold Coke you bought with the ramen, you swear it's better with this food. $12 a head to pack your GI tract with Little Tokyo's biggest surprise. Get full here then make a fool of yourself further down 1st street at Bordello or Chop Suey.

Considering all the "best ramen in LA" comments, I may be pummeled for this: but I think Daikokuya is about on par with Chabuya.  Yes, the broth is thicker and possibly a little porkier here, but is it worth the extra hour wait & crappy parking situation?  Nope.   I also tried the gyoza which was tasty; the fried rice can be skipped.  One thing I didn't particularly like is that you can't really change/add/modify the ramen to your liking.  There's really just one (if classic) way to get your ramen.  I generally like to add more stuff like nori and extra bamboo. And although it's but a lowly egg, I am, like Bourdain, an egg whore, and a slightly runny yolk inside a perfectly cooked hard boiled egg is a thing of beauty to me.  So big ups on getting that done right.

I was surprised that this is considered one of the top ten restaurants in the US.  I love ramen and Japanese food, but this was definitely not the best ramen I've had.   I didn't really like the chicken fried rice either.  The eel plate was good, however.   Good thing is that we got lucky and didn't have to wait for a table, and our server was SO nice!  I would definitely come back to this place, but it's nothing that I will go on days thinking about.

Sooo delicious! The line is pretty crazy but it's worth it. Their house special ramen is big and delicious. The pork just pretty much melts in your mouth... The second time we went, we got the combos. It comes with a crunchy salad with a delicious, creamy dressing. My boyfriend got the tuna sashimi bowl, which was good but nothing out of the ordinary. I got the fried rice which was delicious! But that night, I ordered the kotteri flavored ramen and so the fattiness of the whole meal was a bit much. Delicious but if I get fried rice again, it would not be with kotteri flavor. My goal is to try that entire menu. That delicious, delicious looking menu.

Good ramen --  Yes. Worth the long wait -- Definitely NO. I love ramen and have had several ramen restaurants in LA area. Daikokuya might be the top 3 on my list, but I won't give it another try unless I don't have to wait in line for an hour and half. Yes, AN HOUR AND HALF, that was the time I waited last Sunday at 2:30pm. Could you imagine you go to a ramen restaurant at 2:30pm and finally have a bowl of noodle at 4pm? That is crazy!   Santoku serves a even better ramen and the time you need to wait is less than 10 minutes! So sorry daikokuya, your ramen is good, but not so good to have me wait for 1.5 hrs.

The gyoza appetizer and of course the ramen are very tasty. Surprisingly, their fried rice is also very good! Make sure you don't have any aversion to green onions if you eat here, though; they put a lot of green onions on their food. There are a lot of interesting vintage Japanese ads hanging on the walls. I wish the ventilation in the restaurant was a little better. It can get unbearably hot in that little cramped space with a bowl of hot soup right under your face. Nevertheless, I have to give it 5 stars!

Great for satisfying your late-night hunger pangs in spite of the fact that parking is always a PITA in little Tokyo.  If you're patient, drive around the block 3 or 800 times and you just might get lucky and find a meter.  Otherwise, park in a pay lot.  There's a PD station around the corner so you might also consider reducing the odds of breaking some traffic law on your 5th roundabout and getting nailed for it.     The ramen is tasty even though the broth is a little bland.  Nothing a bit of salt wont fix. Their braised pork belly is decadently fatty (as it should be) and they present the most inviting plate of gyoza that I've seen to date:  beautifully browned and crisp on the edges with a light glisten of oil, all lined up in a neat little row and piled with green onions. They taste as good as they look.  The spicy tuna rolls are surprisingly decent.  I know, I know, scary to order sushi some place other than a sushi bar, but here, it does the trick.   The atmosphere is cozy, and they have a bookshelf near the entrance stacked with comics.     Definitely a dependable place to get your grub on. *Update* Don't be deceived by the boring sound of the "shredded pork bowl"---it's the sexiest thing on the menu.  Just imagine chunks of pork belly slightly caramelized, drizzled with dark, sweet sauce, and nestled atop a bed of Japanese rice... melting in your mouth.  This is my forever jam.

We fell in love with Japanese Ramen when we lived in Japan ten years ago.  Since then, we've been looking for authentic Japanese Ramen here in the states with no luck. A couple of years ago, my brother introduced us to Daikokuya during a trip to L.A.  Just like our favorite Ramen place in Eifuku, we had to line up outside before the place even opened! Luckily, we were early enough to be part of the first group to get seated when they did open.  We were not disappointed! The Ramen's taste and texture made us feel like we were back in Japan again. We've been back during every trip we've made down to LA since then. Regarding other items on the menu, we've also had appetizers, which tend not be very memorable since I can't remember any of them right now. Stick to the Ramen as it is unforgettable.

I would say that this ramen place is fairly close to how real Kyushu Tonkotsu ramen is supposed to taste like. (I've been to Hakata in Japan and had real tonkotsu ramen there) Trust me. This is as authentic as Japanese ramen can be! Just a fair warning, be prepared to wait during lunch and dinner hours. Drop someone off, get your name written down while the driver finds parking. Go hop over to Far Bar, if it's late afternoon/evening time and grab a drink. Come back and your table should be ready. :)

Liked! Not loved because of the long wait and the minimal variety of ramen choices. But I do have to say their "tonkotsu" was thick and flavorful even though it will probably clog your artery :) The noodle was chewy and not under cooked! Sone ramen place's ramen taste like uncooked noodle!

This place is out of the way (being knee deep in Little Tokyo). There's never any parking around. There's always a long wait for a spot - even at the counter. It's not very pretty inside. But I love this place! The ramen is so oh-ish-shi ("delicious" to you gai-jin)! The soup is the perfect combination of tang and saltiness. The noodles are firm, but are soft enough to melt once in your mouth. And the pork cutlets. Oh how sublime are these pork cutlets... Okay. I'm getting a little creepy here. But this place is good. Like, TAMPOPO good. Check it out if after a show at the Ahmanson or the Dorothy Chandler. Arigato, Mr. Po-tah-toh.

Be patient and wait til you're call upon!  Let me tell you, it's worth the wait.   Two little stool opened up by the end of the bar and my husband and I took those seats after waiting for about 45 mins.  Best seats because we saw how the food was being prepared.   By now I'm pretty famished!  I ordered their Combo, consist of soupy Ramen and fried rice, the fried rice is really good and the ramen is ridiculously delicious.  The bowl is a pretty good size bowl consist of the broth (very flavorful could be salty to others), a hard boiled egg (which the yolk is barely cook), slices of pork (you could order extra meat), onions, and the perfect cook ramen. You can also add some vinegar, chili, or garlic paste to you bowl.  Oh so good!   I even took to go, not just mine but my husband's as well because I couldn't let it to waste, and rule of thumb is never to take any soupy noodles home because it gets gross and soggy.  I didn't care!!  It was still good the next day. Give it a try the next time you're in LA.  I certainly will.   I

It's a shame...this noodle whore/addict/fanatic did not eat at this famous ramen house until now.  After my last visit, I faced the mirror and scolded myself for this blasphemy. Daikokuya...many times have I been in the company of hunger crazed maniacs refusing to wait for your delicious broth...or walked by to find you closed because it's 4 am.  But I don't blame you...it was my fault for not giving you a real chance. I stopped by with some coworkers after a proper happy hr nearby.  When we got seated at the counter, I was concerned that the four of us wouldn't be able to chat as we ate.   I was wrong.  SO very wrong.   The only sounds to be heard were satisfying slurps and murmurs of ecstasy.  The broth was so subtle yet flavorful...the pork was tender and delicious...the noodles were soft yet slightly firm...and the hard boiled egg that had soaked up the flavors made me drool :) I think it's great that the pickled ginger is at your table so you can add it yourself.  I happen to love a lot of it so I piled it on top of my ramen.  It must be the korean in me, but I like to eat that stuff like it was kimchi. At last, my noodle fantasy had finally been fulfilled...I heart Daikokuya!!

i wanted to love it, but after 3 visits, it is close to perfect but the ever-important broth was slightly less satisfying than what i would call the best ramen i ever had. KOTTERI RAMEN: i got the fattiest ramen on the menu with kotteri (pork back fat). the noodles are WONDERFUL. the big, marinated eggs are HEAVEN & cooked perfectly. the pork is the MOST TENDER. but the broth is not as thick & creamy as i've had at other places. good ramen is hard to find in LA; i find santouka's spicy miso ramen slightly more satisfying. VINEGARY RAMEN: i tried the vinegary flavor ramen that's on the special sign at the tables & counter & really really liked the vinegar taste! they serve it slightly cooler, not sure if that's because of the vinegar, but this would've been PERFECT had they served it hotter. awesome. GYOZA: good! DEEP FRIED SHISO TUNA: interesting. i would get fresh sushi instead. SUSHI: great! FRIED RICE: i'm more of a noodle soup person, but it's basically the pork on top of fried rice. SERVICE: really good! PARKING: little tokyo parking is horrible.

Great Ramen's Ghost this is good Sh*t. Its like liquid pork...with noodles....and more pork. The lady and I stopped by here after checking out the Murakami show. My workmates has praised the ramen and cursed the wait...so i was for warned. Yup, we waited for 45minutes to get a seat here. Jenny was getting restless. But the food more then made up for it in my opinion. Now i may not be a Ramen expert although i do enjoy a bowl, so I'm no novice either. The broth here is unlike any I've had. Rich with pork flavor, scallions, and sesame. The noodles seemed perfect to me but I'm not trained in the nuance of such things. The Pork Belly slices that are served on top of the soup are insanely tender and tasty. Jenny got the dish served in a dismantled fashion. Noodles in one bowl, broth in another, pork on a plate with the other elements. The pork here is seared and seemed to have more of a bacon element to it then mine did. In addition to the soup we ordered a plate of the gyoza. Extremely fresh tasting and the shell was tender with a nice crispy skin in some parts. highly recommended. Its places like this that keep me from ever thinking i could go vegetarian for too long.

Maybe I'm just a fat guy trapped in a little man's body, but I had no problem finishing their combo dish.     Daikokuya is my cherry popper for ramen, definitely a great place to do it.  Not only that but, during our wait for a seat I got in an episode of Law and Order via the 19 inch TV in the front.  Not sure what they're gonna do when TV goes digital. The Ramen was good and I know I'll catch heat for this but, something about that brown egg just rubbed me the wrong way.  I attempted to eat it in order not to offend anyone, but the brown color just bothered me, so there it sat, in my soup taunting me.  I poked it around a few time but it just wasn't happening.  Maybe next time, you stupid brown egg!   I loved the iced green tea and the tuna my roomie ordered looked great too.

After hearing all the hype, I just had to come and check out Daikokuya for myself. The friend who recommended it to me told me that I had to get the COMBINATION, which comes with DAIKOKU RAMEN and another dish from a list of options. I opted for the PORK CUTLET and my friend got the TUNA SASHIMI BOWL. The cutlet wasn't the greatest - it was rather soggy with sauce, unlike the rice, which was hardly sauced at all. The sashimi was decent - I mean, it's sashimi - all you do is cut it, really. Once again, too much rice. But the ramen - oh, the ramen. Nuts to the combo - all I need is the ramen from now on! It's perfectly cooked and the broth is perfectly seasoned and comes with a perfectly-done soft-boiled egg and some perfectly-tender pork belly. And the portion is perfectly ginormous. In a word: perfect. I'll definitely be back for a huge bowl of ramen on a cold day.

Not that Daikokuya needs another review, but, hey, I went, I ate, I went back, again, and again...I might as well review it! I was a fan of the now closed EAST next door. I'd always see the big crowd of people waiting to get into Daikokuya, and, to be honest, thought, "Whatever. Another 'trendy' place where everybody feels they have to go." I figured it was just another Wurstkuche (insufferably trendy and a big waste of money). Whoa, was I wrong! (Though not about Wurstkuche!) One day I was headed to Usui, my new favorite old school sushi restaurant in Little Tokyo only to find it closed for lunch. So I thought, why not give Daikokuya a try. Well, the bowl of ramen was set down in front of me and my first thought was "Damn, that's BIG!" The broth was opaque and there was a hardboiled egg sitting there in the soup! However with the first spoonful, I realized that Daikokuya not only lives up to the hype--it SURPASSES it! I was amazed at how tasty the broth and the ramen and the pork and everything was! What can I say but, WOW. I've had Ramen before. I used to love it at Kouraku. I still love you Kouraku--but don't think I'll be going there for Ramen anymore (don't worry, I still love nearly everything else you make!). This was something new, Ramen like I'd never tasted! I know they serve other things, but I seriously don't think I am ever going to try them. The ramen is TOO GOOD to pass up! And the service was friendly and professional.

4.5 Stars D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S I FINALLY tried this place as I decided to MAN UP and wait it out.  I hate, hate, hate HATE HATE h8h8h8h8h8h8h8h8 waiting, especially when I R HUNGER.  Never got around to Daikokuya as I was content with Orochon. I fell in love with Japenese Ramen because of Tampopo (Tanpopo?) in Fountain Valley and because of Orochon in Little Tokyo.   So we waited the mandatory 50 minutes or so a few weeks back on a Sunday afternoon.   Ramen + fried rice combo.  Got it, Ate it,  Enjoyed it.  BOMB. I also tried their unagi bowl which was pretty good.  The combos are really worth it.  I highly recommend getting a combo if you eat here. Orochon vs Daikokuya?  How can you compare?  They're two totally different styles of Ramen.  Both ridiculously delicious.  Whichever one I end up eating at really depends on what broth I am in the mood for and whether or not I feel like waiting.   Yay Ramen!

The best ramen ever. I still give them 5 stars even though last night's ramen was a bit watered down. The wait is at least 30 mins and sometimes up to 90 mins, but definitely worth it. The broth is just right. It's so flavorful and not too salty. The pork slices melt in your mouth. Orochan, Kyushu Ramen or Koraku does not compare. Make sure to write your name and then stroll for at least 20 - 30 minutes. If you come extremely hungry, there are bakeries and stores nearby but you want to save your appetite for the huge bowl of ramen. Ramen & combos, gyoza and sausage were awesome! The wait is much longer if you come in a group. The wait is long because seating is limited. It's a hole in the wall so you can come dressed in anything. I wouldn't recommend coming with children unless you have snacks and games. If you leave and your name was called, no biggie from what i've seen, just let them know and they'll seat you next. Bring cash! Their machine is down.

Daikokuya did a good job on their broth!!  They don't have an extensive menu as Shin sen Gumi like with the choices of what to add to your ramen. They have two choices of ramen, everything mixed together, or everything separated and you mix them yourself.  It comes with your basic creamy pork broth, the noodles, an egg, lots of green onion bamboo shoots and pork!  They also have one size but even doing the combo, I didn't even finish my ramen let alone the small side of the pork cutlet rice I also got. The pork cutlet wasn't my favorite and neither was the chicken and egg bowl that my boyfriend tried. They have a variety of people coming here i think because it's located across the street from a hotel, but it's great to see different types of people coming in to explore what other types of Japanese foods there are besides your typical sushi!!! I couldn't help but to listen to my neighbors talking about the menu calling what me and my boyfriend eating "top ramen."  She thinks it's ridiculous that people come here for "top ramen."  She was too afraid to try the pork cutlet bowl of rice and any type of bowl of rice.  She was asking her friend who had taken her there where all the sushi was.  They do have a sushi menu but it's literally 5 different types of sushi like your typical california roll and your spicy tuna roll.  She asked the waitress if they could make her a spider roll and a rainbow roll and when the waitress told her their specialty was ramen, she rolled her eyes and referred to it as "top ramen" once again!  I did feel kind of bad for her considering she ended up eating chicken teriyaki and california rolls.  She's definitely missing out! It is really great tonkotsu ramen!! yuMmMmmy!!!

The crowd of people as you drive down 1st street can only mean one thing: dinner rush at Daikokuya. Environment: The wait is inevitable, unless you go at 9:30pm at night or right when it opens. Parking is street or the Japanese Village Plaza structure. The place is small! About 4 tables and the rest is counter space. Once seated, they do take your order right away and your food is served fairly quickly. Food: Good ramen. The broth is killer! Sweet and salty and not too oily. The depth of the broth is rich and tastes meaty/hearty. The noodles are soft and chewy, cooked perfectly every time. I like these noodles better than Shin Sen Gumi's because SSG's tend to be too thin, too doughy, and not chewy enough (undercooked?). They load your bowl with green onions, so beware. My bf likes the kotteri broth, which is a richer, meatier, fattier broth that he orders every time without fail. The iced green tea is good too! Why four stars? Best ramen in jtown/downtown, just not as good as Santouka.

The best Hakata style broth I've had and I've been in Fukuoka, birthplace of Hakata style ramen! While the broth is so flavorful, the noodles were bit on a weak side. The ultimate ramen would be Daikokuya with Shin Sen Gumi noodles. I am also a big fan of Shin Sen Gumi but the broth there always makes me so thirsty. Daikuokuya broth doesn't. I'd definitely recommend the combination dish. It's a great value at $10.95 for essentially two meals. I had the oyako don which was terrific but the real star of the show was of course the ramen! Would I come back? YES. Would I wait 20 minutes to get seated? YES. Would I wait over an hour to get seated? Um, unlikely. While I am a fan, there is something called diminished returns!

Daikokuya has great ramen and a great broth! It's delicious and comforting. I know a lot of people complain that it's crowded and stuffy and there's always a line, but it's one of those places that you KNOW people only come for the food. It's just that good that people are willing to make the sacrifices to head over for a good bowl of ramen. So the restaurant is pretty cramped and small. The servers are usually pretty busy, but they're kind even when you flag them down. The kitchen is open so you can see them assemble the food. It's pretty noisy and it's not a fancy place at all, in fact, it's probably closer to a dive than an upscale restaurant. I've tried the ramen with the added fat, and I'd wouldn't recommend it unless you like your ramen saltier and oiler. The gyoza is decent, but I've had better. The other items are pretty good, but the main highlight has to be the ramen. It's absolutely divine!

The 5 stars is just for the ramen broth.   In general I don't like the type noodles they use in Japanese ramen. To me, the noodles taste like flavorless thick round egg noodles. They kinda look like long yellow rubber strings.  I can eat packaged but not restaurant type. Back to the broth minus the noodles, its super flavorful and hot! which is a total plus.  As a cook myself, I can tell that they may actually cook the pork bones for a very long time to get the full flavor out of the pork.  Its definitely a lot better than most of the ramen places I've been to. btw, I've stopped going to other ramen joints cuz I have no faith in Japanese ramen. I've gotten the gyoza before and it tasted gross, it was watery and mushy, so I would stay away from that. But the katsudon was pretty good. I would come back only for the broth and Katsudon. By the way, I really think they should clean thte kitchen when the patrons have left cuz they were cleaning the back while I was there and the fumes came through the restaurant and it smelled like garbage..ack..try slurping your soup while sniffing garbage..not a good feeling at all.

My favorite ramen house in LA.  I like the fact that Daikokuya has just one type of ramen rather than a large variety of types of ramen.  Instead of trying to have a wide variety of ramen they focus on one type and do it well.  As mentioned it is not a healthy meal with the broth being very rich in flavor and fat, but so what?  Who eats ramen cause it's healthy?  If you want something healthy than head on over to subway and avoid the fat Jarod style or yelp some vegan and vegetarian restaurants as there are good ones around.  People who know ramen or eat it regularly should know that it was not meant to be a healthy meal.   I've seen some of the those well being ramen healthy types on sale but healthy ramen is an oxymoron.  That's like saying healthy french fries or bacon.   The ramen is pretty filling and comes with various combination orders.  Haven't tried any other combination besides the fried rice which was pretty good.  I know the wait is long but it's just something you have to expect and deal with if you are going to any popular restaurant in LA.  If you don't like Daikokuya then I guess you won't and shouldn't be putting up with the wait and allow people who do enjoy it to wait 30 minutes to an hour to eat.

This place is EFFIN DELICIOUS. Been here twice now and both times were awesome. I ordered the house ramen with Kotteri added to it. Makes it a bit fatty and thick, but the taste is soooooo good. This place is all about the broth and I will say, its just as good as my favorite ramen shop (Halu). The chashu and the noodles are pretty good and they compliment the broth well. Last time I went, I got the lunch special which came with eel and rice. Grilled and sauced done right. The GF got the same lunch combo, but with katsu instead. That bowl was awesome. The cuts were juicy and fried prefectly and then placed into an couple eggs and topped over rice. Kinda like a Pork Katsu omelet. The ramen are awesome and I'm glad I got a chance to see what all the hype is about here.

Simply put, I still haven't had a better, most satisfying bowl of ramen noodles than the one in Daikokuya. The one thing I always get is the Daikoku Ramen. It's their special dish with a broth that the angels would be proud of. Just thinking about it makes me all warm inside.... Other dishes that are tasty are the fried rice and the cutlet bowl. One bad thing about the joint is how hot it can get in there. Their AC sucks and it only gets worse when there a lot of people and the griddle is up and running. I don't care though. I'm focused on my noodles. Don't bother me....

Daikokuya's got me thinking I could live in L.A.  For now I will have to stop in after visiting with friends, suffer the long lines to get a seat at the bar, hunch my shoulders over and drown my face in a bowl of delicious milky pork broth. You will dream about this broth for days to come... and then again from time to time before you start planning your next trip.

Daikokuya is th equivalent of Katana Ya in San Francisco. Both their signature dishes are amazing. I was staying in the hotel across the street (Miyako) and whenever I walked by the restaurant, there was a line outside on all 3 days I was there. I knew it was going to be good. We waited in line one on a late Sunday morning (they open at noon)...I was with a group of good friends, party of 4 including me...and was 5th in line...A minute later, we were followed by 10 other parties behind us.   Note: it was 11:30 am at the time....so 30 minutes before restaurants there were roughly 15 groups waiting. When we got in...the restaurant was comfortably spaced (more so than Katana Ya). Our group sat by the bar with full view of the kitchen. I ordered "Daikokuya Ramen w/ richer sauce"  and one word "YES!" It was an orgasm in the mouth with the texture of the noodles, the consistency of the sauce, and everything else included. The cha siu was more tender than Katana Ya's version...The meat had a bite, but melts in your mouth while my experience at Katana Ya had more of a chew. The portion was perfect. I left the restaurant happy and glad I had the opportunity to experience quality ramen.

WORTH THE WAIT. Every time I come here, I have to wait like an hour. grrr Plus it's downtown so the parking sucks and we have to park far and walk far.... but their pork bowl is so yummy that I don't mind any of it! Their ramen is pretty good too but I always go for the pork bowl because I cannot resist the tender, flavorful morsels of pork!!! If you want, they do offer combos! So if I'm hungry then I'll have a ramen+pork bowl combo. After waiting at the door for an hour amidst the savory aroma of ramen soup, you WILL be hungry :)

Worth the wait! =D $11.50 for a huge bowl of ramen and your choice of side. What a good deal! I usually get the fried rice, which is really good. Not your average to-go asian restaurant fried rice. They give you a lot and it has really good flavor. The noodles are the perfect al dente. The broth is amazing. You can taste the yummy portk flavor. I love the pork and the soft boiled egg in the soup. Plus, they put lots of green onions! The place is small, but feels authentic. Hard if you have a big group. With a little group, its fun sitting at the counter and seeing them prepare your food. Still need to try the other locations. =) Street parking sucks, but late at night, you don't have to pay for the meter!

Daikokuya is to ramen as Michael Jordan is to basketball. And by that, I mean it REIGNS SUPREME in the world of ramen!!! With that said, there are a few minor snags that I'd like to point out. A) You can pretty much only go and eat without a wait *at* opening time...hell, sometimes I even get there 30 min before they open and there is ALREADY A LINE. Kind of ridiculous. My advice is to go Saturday morning around 10:45 (they open at 11:00) I almost took a star off for this...but meh. Whatever. B) They only have one type/flavor of ramen. No add ins or extra frou frou ingredients. You can either order the ramen, or the extra fatty koterri style ramen (I prefer the latter...the broth is made from the back fat of the pig and you can see little bits of fat floating around in the broth. Sounds gross but is DELICIOUS.) So for those of you who love ramen heaped with other stuff, you won't have any luck here. C) Not a place you can (or really even should) bring a group of friends to share in the magic, because seating is quite limited, and I always feel like I need to finish as quickly as possibly so the next jillion people in line have a chance to eat! This is not a huge issue, just thought I'd point it out so you all know whats up. I hate seeing people here chatting away long after their ramen is done while there is a mile long line out the door. Daikokuya. Ramen heaven on earth.

I'm a ramen nazi. I give the actual bowl of ramen 3 stars. It was okay. I've had better. The garlic paste is what made the broth. If it wasn't for that, the broth was kind of just meehh. Could've used more flavor. The noodles were the thicker type. The whole bowl was kind of overwhelming & HUGE, especially if you get a combo set like how I did with ikura rice. I felt super full & bloated after. I give the restaurant 1 star more because the service is very good. They turn tables quickly & have an impressive system. There were no empty seats ever available cuz once one party leaves, they quickly buss & wipe the area down so the next party can get seated right away. I wanted to try the kokkeri, but got there around 7pm & it was sold out already :( Probably won't be back but I'm happy I got to try it!

Service is great, wait is super long even on weeknights. Hmm... not too sure how I feel about this place. Friends have recommended and ranted about it for so long, so I finally went and tried it. I liked their fried rice a lot... their ramen, is good. But to be honest, there was no WOW factor compared to the other Japanese ramen places I have tried. Then again, I am not a HUGE Japanese ramen or pork fan~ I would go back again and try different things on the menu next time :)

The best of this restaurant is the kurobuta chashu in their noodles. It was close enough to tonkotsu ramen you could have in Japan because we are in LA, again sadly, but this place would be mediocre in Japan. Tonkotsu broth is not flavorful enough. The noodle doesn't have strong enough texture. Very very close though. I can only give this place 3 stars here because service sucks and the furnitures here are not comfortable. They don't want you to stay there for a long time, that's why. The server that was working at that time, who was very impressive being fluent in Japanese and English and all, but he can't  assume that people won't understand him when he keeps yelling "I'm soooooooo hungry damn!" in Japanese.... For all the ramen fans on yelp, if you ever go to Japan, Tokyo area, do not miss the "Ramen Museum" in Yokohama. You will love it, and try one of the restaurants there that specializes in the tonkotsu soup.  Then you will know what I was talking about :)

I haven't written a Yelp review in a long time.  Actually, I haven't written a Yelp review in eons. I've been meaning to get back to the keyboard.  And the first place to come to mind is Daikokuya. This ain't no Top Ramen.  The ramen is cooked just right - "al dente", if you will.  And the soup and pork are delicious. A couple of side notes: a) Yes, you usually have to wait. b) If you go here during the summer, it is bloody hot inside. c) The teriyaki chicken, something I usually avoid, is quite good - not the afterthought of a dish most restaurants generally throw onto the menu to appease finicky, unadventurous Caucasian patrons.  The chicken is fried and covered with a very nice sauce, served piping hot.  They say on the menu that it's how it is done in Tokyo - never had teriyaki chicken in Tokyo so I can't provide any assurance on that one, but I can confirm that it is good.

Wow, what a find. I was down in LA for a business trip and was meeting up with a friend near downtown LA. We decided to meet up in Little Tokyo and I used Yelp to find a place near the Japanese Plaza Mall. We get there around 6:30 and there's already a list going. We actually walk outside to catch up and within a couple minutes, they called our name to sit at the bar! Much faster than I expected. Didn't really read the reviews on Yelp, as I was accessing it on my phone, but I noticed that they highlighted the ramen. Totally reminded me of the ramen that I get up North called Santa Ramen. Doesn't have the stewed pork that Santa Ramen does, but the broth is just as tasty! We also ordered the Teriyaki chicken sampler and I ordered the ramen with a combo with a small teriyaki eel bowl. I thought that they would give me a smaller bowl of ramen since I got the combo, but nope...the bowl was just as big. SO MUCH FOOD! I ate everything and had some Asahi and had to run to the airport right after the meal. It was all great, but I don't think I was able to enjoy it as much because I rushed through the meal to get to the airport. It's definitely a place I want to come back to next time I'm in LA; I'll just make sure I order less and take my time eating. :)

It's a rainy afternoon in LA.  It's been a year since I came to LA and I expected sunshine and warmth.  Instead it's a dreary overcast day with the cold penetrating through my exposed legs.  Going to Little Tokyo reminded of the gloomy LA backdrop in Bladerunner. I go to Daikokuya and am shocked at the wait.  There were a dozen parties ahead of us for about a dozen spaces.  The wait is 45 minutes and we get a place at the "bar".  It's really more of a spot where you can watch the chefs make their creations.  Behind the counter steam from boiling hot water permeates through the air.  This brings the whole Bladerunner experience full tilt. The ramen is one of the best I have had and you get a huge bowl for just $9.  Ask for the special daikoku soup.  This is full of flavor and will have you licking your bowl to the last drop.  The pork meat they add tastes like the pig was just killed this morning.  20 minutes pass by in a daze as I lose myself in the soup.  By the time I look up, 1/3 of a garlic pot and 1/3 of red ginger is gone, mixed somewhere within the brown liquid nirvana that now fills my stomach. It was worth it.  Best to come here on a cold rainy day.  I've been here several times but this was the first time I ordered the ramen and now I see why everyone is raving about this.  With the meal done I have to get back out and expire another clone...

I hate waiting so I've decided to rearrange my normal eating times and come to Daikokuya around 3pm when the lunch crowd has abated.   This place has great ramen and is one of the few to serve the tsukemen where the noodles are separate from the soup.  I enjoy noodles that aren't soggy or mushy, but they can even adjust the firmness upon request.  Add to that the famous bone marrow broth and you have a winner!   With 800+ reviews already, what more to say?

If you don't want to wait, you have to come here reaaal late at night.  Oh, and knowing how to speak Japanese can't hurt :p   That said, the soup here is rich with glorious umami (NOT fat) oozing out with every sip.  They are generous with the fatty pork slices, and the bowl even comes with a yummy stewed egg that's flavorful to its very core. If I had a larger stomach, I would order the ramen, shredded pork bowl,  the gyoza, AND a jyokki of beer.  Unfortunately, the ramen is quite filling so if you're an average-sized girl, I would advise against getting the combo rice bowl sets.  Just get the ramen and share an appetizer or rice bowl with someone else.

Again like every other place in Cali that was hyped up.. I don't see what's so great about this place. But then again.. that might just be because I'm very not use to Japanese ramen.. yes.. i am korean and have only been used to korean ramen.. where basically everything is spicy. HEHE. But rice bowls are really good. I enjoyed it a lot. Maybe because I didn't enjoy the ramen.. - -;; but yea.. most people like japanese ramen.. but not me. :(( there is always a long wait because it's known to be cheap and good. about 45 minutes to an hour maybe? but i think it goes by faster because people always leave before they are called. my friend and i put our names down and just looked around for a little bit.

I came here last night after 2 years of hearing about the delicious Japanese ramen and the crazy long wait. We waited about 35 minutes for our party of 4, which I heard wasn't too bad for a Monday night around 7pm. It was perfect weather for some hot ramen because it was cold and drizzly outside, the onset of winter weather. I didn't really look at anything else on the menu since I knew I would be trying the Daikokuya Ramen, and three of us ordered that and it came out surprisingly quickly (like less than 5 minutes after we ordered), probably because it was a busy night so they made it ahead of time. The big bowl full of steaming broth and noodles was, in one word, good. It wasn't too hyped up for me, since compared to other noodle places the ramen was definitely good. The noodles was perfectly cooked, the broth was thick and flavorful, and there were lots of little green onions which I loved. It wasn't mind-blowingly amazing, but for the wait-time and the price and what I was craving, it was satisfying. I'm not sure when's the next time I'll go to Daikokuya since I feel like I won't ever really insanely crave it, but when it's freezing cold and I need  something hot, and I can stand to wait 40-ish minutes outside, then I'll go back for sure. Maybe late at night?

One of the most enjoyable times I've ever had was here with my friends. Let me first say that the wait is RIDICULOUSLY long but despite this and a two-hour wait, I still think it deserves a 5-star rating. My friends and I were very amused by one particular dish, the Mother and Child Reunion. We could not get over the morbid undertone of the chicken and egg in the very food we were consuming. This became one of our inside jokes for the next few weeks. Good times. The ramen with koteri flavor is nothing short of perfect. I'm not an avid ramen enthusiast but I know good ramen when I taste it. It's definitely the best I've ever had and definitely worth the wait. Oh did I mention? The servings are huge! Their fried rice is also one of the best fried rice in LA. Too much good stuff!! I wished they were open late night!!

You know the saying, "doesn't it feel like a cold beer on a hot day?"  Well, on the rare occasion that LA is suffering from below average temperatures, I am going to coin the phrase: "doesn't it feel like a hot daikokuya on a cold day?" I'm convinced it will catch on with everyone who has experienced the tasty ramen noodles from this place. As I am writing this review, SoCal has just been berated with a week's worth of thunderstorms and cold temperatures (strange, I know!).  En route to see a show at the Ahmanson, I naturally pulled out my trusty Yelp! app on my iPhone to figure out what I can eat near downtown that would satisfy my taste buds.  To be honest, I had originally planned on going to a sandwich place, but a last minute glance for a restaurant called "Daikokuya" intrigued me and I clicked on the link. Daikokuya is ramen done right.  And not instant ramen, or cup noodles or any of that stuff.  While they might be good for a case of the late night munchies, the ramen here is a full meal.  I ordered the Daikokuya ramen, which came with a savory broth, yummy noodles, bean sprouts, and meat.  The meat was tender, the egg was cooked like I had never experienced before (I later learned it's a special type of cooking, where the inside is more runny than usual) - delicious, and the broth warmed you up like a furnace just lit up inside you, not too salty, just right. Needless to say I was overjoyed that this last minute discovery paid off.  Something should also be said of the atmosphere here at Daikokuya, waiters shouting cooks at orders in Japanese and greet you in Japanese.  I like that, it's like you've been transported to another country, cause there ain't no way these fantastic noodles could be found anywhere else.

I absolutely love this place!!!! Every time I go here it's cold.. it's rainy.. and it's perfect!! There is always a wait, always! There's barely a wait area.. so hopefully you'll have a coat because you'll most likely be standing outside. The wait-list is ridiculous. But, but.. it's worth it! I know it's just ramen.. but it's not! You have to try it with Koterri.. then you'll never have it without, unless they run out, which is likely because they're always busy. The combinations are a perfect size to share. I usually get the Daikoku Ramen w/ Kotteri + Unagi bowl; it's about $13. I share this and we get an appetizer, and if we're hungry hungry, we get the fried rice. You must try the fried rice! And even when we're both starving... we still don't finish everything but the ramen and take the rest for leftovers. Which doesn't really last the night. I would definitely recommend going to the Little Tokyo location. The ones in the marketplace, in my opinion, are cafeteria-like and don't taste the same. Go to LA!!

Daikokuya ramen is my favorite ramen on earth. I go there because the ramen is phenomal and I don't care about the lack of ambiance or welcoming decor. The food itself is definiately 5 stars.The broth is so rich and luxurious, the pork chasu so tender, the ramen noodles have a nice bite and the profusion of the scallions makes the ramen far superior to any other. I love their combos ($11-$13) even more than the ramen itself as you get the full size ramen with another small bowl. When famished, I'll get the combo with the tender small shredded pork bowl or the small chicken with egg bowls as they taste great but don't taste so great when you reheat them. However, if I'm not too hungry, I'll get the combo with the exceptionally tasty and flavorful fried rice since that tastes great at the restaurant and even when you reheat it. All the combos come with a small shredded cabbage salad with a savory orangish dressing that has a nice texture and taste to it. Alas, all is not perfect in ramen heaven, hence the 4-star rating. The wait can easily be more than an hour for a small restaurant, there is no dedicated parking lot and the booths there don't seat more than 4 people comfortably. Nevertheless, I once went there with 6 other friends and per our request, managed to squeeze into one booth by asking the server to bring us 3 extra chairs.  It was a tight squeeze but we all enjoyed our ramen. If you don't want to wait, and can go for a weekday lunch, you can usually get seated immediately if you get there by 11:15 am.

Sorry, I know there's already gazillion reviews of this place but I stinkin love it and had to be the gazillion +1. Best Ramen place I've had so far! Love the broth. Great for hangovers. Only bad thing is that there's always a line. BUT well worth it! And you can walk over and get some yogurtland for dessert. :)

I love ramen and had been meaning to try this place out for awhile.  Surprisingly, the ramen was NOT the highlight!  Yes, the ramen was tasty, but the real winner here was the fried rice.  It's amazingly greasy and tasty, and is loaded with bits of pork belly.  Possibly the best fried rice--no, the best dish period that I've ever eaten.  If the shredded pork rice bowl is anything like this, I have to come back and try it. Other than that, I can't add much to the 1500 odd reviews of this place.  A few tips: 1) WOW was that bowl of ramen huge.  I mean, it's bigger than the volume of a normal person's stomach.  I would consider splitting it if you're not super hungry. 2) Get an order of fried rice to bring home.  It's that good. 3) Parties of 1 and 2 tended to get seated relatively quickly at the bar.

It's been two years since I've been here and my mouth still remembers this is the best ramen I have ever had. All I can say: You won't regret it. I definitely recommend the chicken and egg or the kurobuta combo. The line is insane and they are very strict that your party is all there, otherwise they will skip over you. I wouldn't bring a large party (6+) either.

Waited OVER AN HOUR. Ordered the combo with ramen, tuna, and a salad. Salad was standard, but too much dressing for me. I ate some of it, but couldn't finish it all. Ramen was good. Noodles were amazing, but soup base was a little fatty for me. Tuna was very fresh and very good. I'd come back here again, but I hate waiting. We'll see if my tolerance for waiting improves.

I only reserved a 5 star for Daikokuya. As you can tell I've been updating and going back and forth with the 4-5 star rating. The consistency plays a major role in how I want to rate Daikokuya. I visited Daikokuya last night (Mon @ 630PM) and their infamous bowl of Ramen was somewhat off. First, the Chatsu (Pork Belly) was not prepared well. I felt like I got a low quality/poorly executed batch of meat. My girlfriend's bowl received the same verdict. Both of our eggs were over cooked. The eggs were supposed to be half boiled and somewhat gooey. I was quite disappointed there. The broth and noodles were right on and couldn't complain in that department. Moving on to the fried rice. Probably the most consistent thing at Daikokuya failed me again last night. For the first time, they didn't get it right. The flavors weren't there, I have no idea what happened. Because I felt like Daikokuya's fried rice was easily my absolute favorite fried rice of all time (even the Monterey Park location can get it right every time). California Rolls ($5) - 8 pieces (Decent price). Just a small jump in quality over your local Trader Joes / supermarket CR. This whole experience was probably a 3.5 Star experience. I'm going to give Daikokuya the benefit of the doubt this time. Santouka (Mitsuwa) ramen may have been the better choice last night. Lastly, if you have never had authentic Ramen before and felt like this place was overrated, the simple answer to that is, this may not have been the ideal place for you to go to. If you have tried comparable places like the ones in my previous updates, you'll come to find Daikokuya at #1 or #2 for most people.

Finally! I've now tried "the best ramen" of Los Angeles. To start we had the fried spicy tuna. They are nubs of spicy tuna, wrapped in shiso leaf, then enrobed in a tempura batter and fried to perfection. Served with coarse salt, they were the most pleasing little packets of goodness that I've had in a while! Daikokuya serves the most traditional ramen. They only offer one type, because well, they've perfected it and don't need to add any finicky toppings or add-ins. The broth is incredibly rich, almost buttery! The soup is filled with tender pieces of pork, a whole egg, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts and green onions and its the perfect mix. The bowl is so big you can fit your face in it - and then some! The best thing about Daikokuya is that it's cheap! Compared to the $15 bowls from SF and NY, Daikokuya serves up a larger bowl at only $10. It's a steal and a delicious one at that!

BEST RAMEN I'VE TASTED SO FAR!! I've only been to Shin-Sen-Gumi Hakata Ramen in Fountain Valley & Orochon. but Daikokuya was definitely the best so far. I'm not a huge ramen lover, but the broth here was amazinggg! & you don't have to pay for extra toppings like other places. you get everything you want for only ~$9! the two times i've been here i've always gone around 11 am when it opens. during my first trip, i came 15 mins after they opened and all the seats were taken already. but the wait was only tenish minutes so it wasn't as bad. for my 2nd trip, me and my friends got there twenty minutes before they opened and there was a line forming outside already but we were lucky and got seated fast. i would definitely come back here again and bring new ppl to try it :) great service & great food! :)

Uuuuuuuuuugh.... I've dreaded and put off writing this review, because I feel like I'm in 8th grade again and EVERYONE loves this new hit band, "New Kids On the Block". Like even "the jocks" were jamming out to "Hangin' Tough" as warm-up music before basketball games and wrestling matches... ... then there was me, still deeply immersed in the hot trends of Hyper-Color t-shirts, overalls with one strap undone, Starter jackets, and "the wet look" for hair styles... but simply could not conceive why anyone thinks "You've Got It" is a hot single.  And I wasn't even a music snob! I liked Kriss Kross.  Pfft, who am I kidding, "liked", as in past-tense?  Try LOVE, as in RIGHT NOW.  "Daddy Mac will make you, JUMP JUMP!"... ahhh, good times. Daikokuya is the "Pinks" of downtown, in that there is never, NOT a huge line/wait.  I've lived downtown for 4 years and in passing, I always thought it was, like, some trendy Asian club or something.  Like that club in Blade, where Wesley Snipes goes in and it's filled with nothing but older Japanese business men in Rayban Wayfarer sunglasses, all fixated on these chicks who look like Sailor Moon singing to some throbbing techo beat.  Man, that movie was awesome. Huh?  Oh yeah.... so Daikokuya is everyone else in 8th grade who loved New Kids, and I, a lover of ramen/noodles, am left scratching my head as to why I don't find this worth waiting 45minutes-hour for.  And just like 8th grade, am I a loser for not liking? ....in their defense, there's basically nothing I'd wait 45 minutes for.  Unless it was for tickets to a Kriss Kross concert. Anyway, their ramen is REALLY bland.  Pork is fatty and tasteless (just like Donnie Walberg) And they put a whole, hard-boiled egg in the mix... like, gross.   HOWEVER, their one shining redemption makes up for everything: easily the BEST Gyoza I've EVER had, by far.  And I'm a Gyoza snob.  These guys make it like nothing I've ever tasted before, so if you're lackluster on the ramen, triple up on the Gyoza order.  Pretty much only reason I'm giving 3 stars.

One of my favorite things to eat is RAMEN! I love venturing off and finding new places. I had heard that this place is one of the best around. I know there is one in Costa Mesa but I heard the one in Little Tokyo was even better. Went there in the middle of the day on a Friday so there was only like a 10 minute wait. I hear it gets pretty packed at night. It's a tiny little place in the heart of Little Tokyo. I have to say that this was probably the best ramen I've had so far! They give you a HUGE, I'm talking HUGE bowl. I couldn't finish it and had to take it home. The broth is SO GOOD and the ingredients are as fresh as it gets! Love all the green onions in it! YUM! Hope I can get back there soon and try some other stuff on their menu. The cold ramen looks so good for a hot day! SO, BELIEVE THE HYPE! THIS PLACE IS OFF THE HOOK! Hoping to go check out the Costa Mesa one REAL soon!

There are food spots in every city, like Gray's in NYC, Pat's in Philly, and Whataburger in TX.  A place where can always get that comfort dishes that always makes you smile.  This small Little Tokyo noodle shop hits the spot. Full of Japanese movie posters, this place hasn't change much through the years. This was my lunch time oasis when I was in college, and become the fatty I'm now..  A big bowl of noodles, great broth, pork slices is worth waiting for ( you will always wait outside for a seat, no joke).  The rest of menu will not disappoint, pork dishes always popular. Enjoy!

Having lived in NYC and having tried all the ramen joints (Momofuku, Rai Rai Ken, Ippudo, Setagaya), I can honestly say that the ramen I had at Daikokuya topped them all. And the value is amazing--for 13 bucks, you can get a combo which includes ramen and a chirashi-like bowl with 5 pieces of tuna sashimi over sushi rice (other options for the combo are tonkatsu, fried rice, spicy tuna rolls). The two of us arrived at 10pm Saturday to a packed house with people waiting outside on the sidewalk. We waited an hour to be seated and it was definitely worth the wait.

This place has the best ramen I've EVER had.  If you like variety, then don't come here, since they only offer one type of ramen that you can get.  The pork is nice and tender and the broth is too good for words.  Also, some of the best and most flavorful terriyaki chicken I've ever had (but shhh..don't tell Tokyo Lobby I said that).   I like this place better than Mr. Ramen a few doors down b/c of it's consistency in quality food.   Get there early, b/c it gets packed!  Also, FYI they started this new thing where they don't accept take-out on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays.

Hmm...I've eaten here many times and I always forget to write a review about it. You can call me an outsider but I think the Katsudon tastes better than the ramen here.  Maybe I'm just a katsu addict that's why =P and the fact that this place makes one of the best katsudons I've ever tried (Gochi up north in cupertino being the best imo).  The ramen here is definitely better than Shinsengumi's ramen located in Fountain Valley. Oh yea, the salad that they give you is good too!  It's like crab or shrimp sauce or something that they put on the salad.  Whatever it is, it's hella good but of course, after several bites, it starts tasting funky. =P

I want to give this place one star so you don't go here, just so I don't have to wait in a longer line to eat the best ramen. Yes they use MSG and I get a headache from it, but everything is so freakin' good. Do not miss the gyoza.

500+ reviews? 4 stars? After searching for parking late at night, and waiting 20-30 minutes to be seated, you would think the Ramen would be a lot better than the type you can buy and cook yourself. Sadly, it wasn't. Seriously, I probably could have made an equally if not better bowl of Ramen. While the Ramen was just decent, the service was pretty quick and friendly. I would NOT come back to this place. Craving noodles/soup? Buy a $0.99 bag of Ramen and make it yourself, oh and throw in a hard-boiled egg. it'll taste EXACTLY like this place. Verdict:  This place is over-hyped and they under-deliver.

I like that this place only has one type of raumen done in two styles. I hate that you always have to wait at least an hour to eat here. The Raumen: Standard or with extra fat. The soup is a Pork bone bases creamy soup really smooth and rich without being to heavy, or salty. The Pork itself is kurobuta or black pork and is so tender that it almost melts into the soup giving the soup a richness that i've never tasted anywhere else. The Egg (I know reviewing an egg) is amazing its boiled and then soaked in a special sauce overnight making the whites tender and the yolk smooth and creamy...request an extra egg. The noodles are generic but adequate i wish they would let you request firmness levels but this is really not important. I've notice there are apartments available next to this place and would live there if i could eat here everyday.   this is one of three Daikokuya and i have yet to eat at the other ones.

Wow, a nice surprise!  A few years ago, while my wife was still going to law school, we went exploring J-town for a ramen spot.  The place we went to, which I don't remember, tasted like they opened up some instant ramen packages.  After that I was always reluctant to go back to any ramen house.  I figured 815 people couldn't be wrong, so decided to give this place a try. Had the Daikokuya ramen with the shredded pork with rice bowl combo.  Had the gyoza as an appetizer.  All of it was great.  A little bit greasy for sure, but hit the spot.  I'm kinda scared to see how big their economy size bucket of MSG must be, but I'm working with a don't ask, don't tell system for here.  We probably got there just a little after 6... maybe about a 15 minute wait which we spent staring at the posters next door of Cure/Marilyn Manson looking Japanese singers (???).  By the time we got out.... looked more to be a 45 minute wait.... Might as well get there a little bit early to save from the wait...

This place is by far my favorite Ramen house. The wait can be horrendous depending on time of day and day of the week. But every single time, the wait is worth it! The decor of the restaurant is kooky in it's own way with old Japanese memorabilia and woodsy panels. There's several booths along the walls and a main dining counter by the ramen-cooking vats. My favorite pick is the Daikoku Ramen with Pork Cutlet Combination. With an extra dash of flavor, ask the waitress for Koteri. What can I say but this is the best ramen around from soup to noodle to egg. The soup is made from pork bones and it's the richest I've had. The chashu/pork is a special black pork and they give you two slices of it marinating in the soup. The ramen noodles are perfectly textured, chewy but not tough and with a slippery glass-like ability to be slurped! The pork rice is delicious! Deep fried pork cutlets cooked again with egg sprinkled with panko bread crumbs. Wow. If I didn't order the pork cutlet bowl, I'd have to go for the fried rice. Green onions, egg, pork cutlets, and a good portion of fried rice really hits the spot. Sometimes we'd order it as it's own entree and split it between the wife and I. Pros: Noodles, rice bowls. Cons: Wait and lack of parking. All in all, a great eating experience. 5 of 5 stars! My Numba One!! P.S. If you are STARVING, ask for the special Porcelain bowl of ramen. It. Is. Huge. I've done it twice. Ssssssshhh!!

The best ramen I've ever had! So rich! So flavorful! So much! There is almost always a long wait, but it's worth it. The kurobuta they put in the ramen alone is worth it. 2 Tips: 1) If you are not calorie-crazy, (which many people in LA are), and like richer flavors, go for kotteri. It makes the broth more substantial-feeling and tastier. 2) The small Kirin draft is the same price as a bottle of ramune. ($2.50) If you're over 21, get a beer while you're there.

I love my ramen almost as much as I love my alcohol. buahaha. Anyways, I was in LA one day and my friend took me to this ramen place that she claims to be the BEST ever, so I took her up on that. Came here on a rainy day a few months back and I was VERY IMPRESSED. Parking sucks though...street only, it's LA after all. The exterior definitely reminded me of how ramen shops looked like back in Japan, but the inside is A LOT bigger than most ramen places. Even on a random day at around 4ish on a rainy day in LA, this place was PACKED! Good thing there were 2 spots at the bar for my friend and I, my lucky day I guess (except for the fact that my umbrella broke and my suit was drenching wet). But anyways back to the ramen, sat down and was immediately greeted and had our orders taken. I went with the Daikoku ramen ($7.50 I believe) and it was the best choice I have made in a while! The ramen came out swiftly and in a pretty big bowl, I was pleasantly surprised. The soup was soooo flavorful and the ramen, the perfect firmness level. I loved all the sides it came with, bamboo shoots, the egg, bean sprouts, and green onion! I love green onion! I would have to say since coming back from Japan, this has to be the best reminder of what Japanese ramen should taste like, and that is saying a lot! Food babies allllllllll day, everyday!

I always take out of town visitors to this place. I love the fact there's only 1 signature broth, that they dont need any other flavors! The wait can get pretty long, but it's totally worth it. I also order the gyoza appetizers since they compliment the soup pretty well. Parking is scarce but the parking garages aren't too bad. Be prepared to wait at least 20 min - 1 hour on the weekend nights. Again, like i said, it's totally worth it!

ITADAKIMASU!!! Daikokuya is hands down the best! The broth is to die for! Super flavorful with the right amount of body that makes your insides scream for more! Kurobuta pork belly chashu...need I say more? It's melt in your mouth flavor explosion. The ramen noodles are done with precision, perfect chew and flavor. From the moment I sat down, I felt like a kid at a candy store, but being super excited for that one and only one item that was going to hit my taste buds and sink me into a wonderful food coma. The marinated boiled egg is just ooooweeee in my tummy because everything tastes better with eggs. Nicely added sprouts, bamboo shoots, green onions, and sesame seeds...it's the perfect bowl of noodles. I must try the kotteri broth next time, a fattier broth with a great load more flavor! Overall, this bowl of ramen will hit the spot on any type of day, rain or shine, it's going to taste great 'til the last bite/drop. This place is a must try and worth all the wait!

Hands down the best ramen I've had.  It's always PACKED.   They don't take reservations, so don't come here when you need to be in and out quickly.  There will be a wait. The ramen is made in the biggest pot I've ever seen in my life.  The broth is amazingly rich and delicious.  I can't ever finish my entire bowl but it's great heated up the next day as well. Daikokuya is the perfect ending to a Downtown LA - Little Tokyo adventure.  My mouth is watering thinking about it.

Daikokuya's ramen is very authentic and seriously some of the best noodles I've had since coming to Los Angeles. I came here with three friends one Saturday and we had to wait about half an hour to get seats because the place was packed, even at 3 PM. The restaurant is small and doesn't have many seats, but the atmosphere is warm and homey. We had to sit at the booths facing the kitchen, which were a bit unclean because it was near the kitchen. Their menu doesn't have many choices, especially when it comes to ramen, but that is also what makes Daikokuya special; I guess they concentrate on their specialty. We ordered the Daikoku Ramen combination with a small chicken teriyaki bowl and also the fried rice. The prices are reasonable, considering their large portions. The food is very filling, so this is a good place to eat at when you're very hungry. The ramen is flavorful and you just have to eat it to understand, really. The fried rice was also very good and so aromatic, the portions were huge with two scoops of rice. It was a bit oily though.

Great food and pretty good prices. The line can be super long, but if you're craving ramen it's definitely worth the wait. You can always sign up and then walk around beautiful little tokyo. Grab some of those red bean cakes across the street or buy some groceries. I think the best thing to order are the combo and then to share with someone, unless you're really hungry. The one order is def enough. Enjoy!

One of my all-time favorite ramen spots in LA. However, my experiences here have been getting worse each time. The following happened over the course of 4 visits to Daikokuya. - Bugs around and on the table. I think they may have been termites. /shudder - Water was NEVER refilled even though we asked for refills 3-4 times. - Noodles were overcooked (last 2 out of 3 visits). - Got dirty spoons. And is it just me, or have their portions been getting smaller and their lines getting longer? I love Daikokuya, but if they keep on this downward trend, I may stop going out of my way to come here.

Got the Daikoku Ramen and spicy tuna roll. The spicy tuna roll tasted different from any other spicy tuna roll I have ever tried....it seemed as if the spicy tuna had been smushed around..the texture just wasn't right. I felt as if I was eating baby food. As for the ramen itself, it was just alright. There is so much hype about this place, I really was expecting more. The place was small and busy, and the uncomfortable seating arrangement did not make the meal much more enjoyable. Overall, it was pretty good, but I would not rate it more than 3 stars.

LOVE this place. Yes the waiting sucks and yes it's cramped but SO WORTH IT! I would recommend against going in a big group. I always get the original ramen because, frankly, I can't eat more than that. What I think seperates this ramen from other places is the broth. It is just so damn amazing! Every night is busy at Daikokuya so there isn't really a best time to go (I've never been there during the day so I don't now how busy it gets) but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make for the best ramen I've had in LA.

When I am all Shin-Sen-Gumi'd out, I come here. Super nice service. Larger pieces of gyoza. Pretty good. Ramen is great. Unique. I usually get a gyoza appetizer and then the ramen/unagi combo. The fried rice here is REALLY good.

It's worth the wait!!!!!! Me and two of my friends we wents here after class and we headed out to this spot, it was great!!!!! The portions are large and will fill you up! The best part is that you can get a combination in which you get the soup and small side order. The appetizers are a must and don't forget the Sake! The reason I give this 4 stars is due to the fact that the broth is a bit salty in which if it was a bit less salty I would rate it 5 star!!!!!

ABSOLUETLY THE BEST RAMEN IN THE WORLD! The wait is awesomely long but it's all worth it when you have that great bowl of ramen in front of you. The place opens late so after partying hard, check this place out. Say bye-bye to those diners, people! Another really great dish (in addition to their ramen) is their gyoza. I noticed that they use their infamous broth for the gyoza to enhance the flavor. Yes, you will be so full you won't able to walk out straight but who cares! Parking sucks, try the 2nd street next to the plaza or pay up 8 bucks for the parking structure near you. Sometimes the parking lot across the street from MOCA (which is on Alameda) open without a parking attendant. Free parking at your own risk. On Sundays, they are open until they are out of broth so calling before heading out may be helpful.

The reviews on Yelp don't lie.  Daikokuya is the best-tasting Ramen in Los Angeles... hands down. My favorite is the special noodles with "extra flavor", which basically means that they don't strain out the fat before they put the noodle base in your dish.   If you are health-conscious, I would not recommend this place.  If your group includes vegetarians, definitely don't come here.  Parking is a slight pain, but there are often meter spots 2-3 blocks away.  The wait for a table has been 15-30 minutes every time I have been there.

Where do you go when you're craving for hot, chewy gooey ramen on a not-so-typical cold or rainy Southern California night?  I have 4 syllables for you -- DAI-KO-KU-YA! Daikokuya makes the best ramen in LA, hands down.  You won't go wrong with the Daikoku/house ramen --  flavorful broth, tender pork, and a tasty egg to compliment all else.  Makes me *drool* just describing it ;). Now if they can only do something about the wait ...

Everything said about this place above is mostly accurate. if you are serious about finding good ramen: http://www.yelp.com/biz/… I was taken here by a bunch of guys who work half of the year in Japan, they said hands down this is one of the best Ramen places in California. I completely agree. Read my review for more. Still got love for the Daikokuya tho, don't get me wrong. The only reason this gets four stars is for the waiting and the parking situation.

i really would like to give this place 3.5 stars.  But since that's not possible, i upped them .5 of a star- only because: 1. there was a FIVE MINUTE wait when i went 2. the wait service was great and attentive 3. the pork was tender and flavorful i was expecting a 1 hour wait as other reviews had suggested.  but to my surprise, there was no line and i was seated within 5 mintues of putting my name on the list.  The wait service kindly greeted me and took my order and the food was out within 10 mins.  i order the daikoku ramen and it was ok.  it wasnt mouth watering delicious as i had hoped, just ok.  but still better than other pathetic excuses for ramen houses.  the broth was flavorful and the noodles were just cooked right but the one component that really sold this dish for me was the pork.  it was tender, juicy and oh so heavenly in my mouth.  there is a generous amount of pork in every bowl of noodles, not like other places that gives you just one piece of meat. i'm so glad this place opens late.  definitely a better alternative than McD's 24-hour drive through.

In Little Tokyo, Downtown Los Angeles sits a humble small restaurant called Daikokuya. They serve their popular and original noodle and rice-bowls including their Daikoku Ramen that's to daydream about. A group of us walked into the shop late Friday night (they don't close until 1 a.m.) to enjoy the comfort of their food. If you're in the area you should not miss the opportunity to enjoy the selections of their menu! As you'll see all the photos below are taken from inside, so I saved the outside of the restaurant for you to go visit yourself. I, especially, didn't include photos of the actual food as an added incentive for you to go :) http://jenmayphotography…

With places like this, how are Japanese people not morbidly obese? I get the chopped pork bowl. It's always better a few hours after the inch of pork fat congeals. The soup broth is good too. Pork belly has a very distinct flavor that makes their broth very full-bodied and rich. Overall, the food is good and it's fun to watch them make it.

With almost 1,400 reviews, Daikokuya definitely does not need the support from lil ol' me. But it's just so good! I loooooove how the ramen tastes, it's slightly crunchy and is just perfect. My mom said the secret is to microwave the noodles for 3 minutes. Maybe that's their secret too. If you're in the OC area like I am and was probably ecstatic about the OC location like I was, one word of advice and save yourself the trouble. It does not compare. Santouka is a better choice. I miss the Wednesdays class in LA - thanks to Daikokuya!

In search of good tasty memorable ramen shop in LA, my first stop had to be Daikokuya.   My friend made the smart decision to arrive early to beat the rush (she is a genius) and we got there around 5pm. Within 15 minutes there was already a waiting list for tables.  Yes - small venue, yes - not that ventilated, but friendly happy service. The ramen was delicious, my friend told me they soak their eggs overnight and the flavor was a perfect blend of salty, sweet and savory.   I'll definitely be coming back to try their other dishes :)

This place is wildly popular. For good reason, they make a damn tasty bowl of ramen! It's damn yummy. The wait is long, but worth it. They are also open late, late. So you can come here after you and your friends get all tweaked out on meth and Coco Puffs or whatever it is the kids are doing these days. It's a small hole in the wall place smack dab in the middle of Lil Tokyo. They have a couple varieties of their Ramen, or three if you can't the option of getting an egg or not getting an egg. =)  It's really good, but not great... Over all I really enjoyed the experience of eating here. However, you wanna know something? Foo Foo Tei, in Hacienda Heights is strictly better. Truth. If you really love your ramen, then you MUST go out of your way to... Foo Foo Tei. I just rhymed. Ugh. i hate myself now. But seriously, go there!

What I love about Daikokuya: 1. THE RAMEN. Best on the West Coast. Good stuff. 2. I love that its a tiny space. Even though you have to wait an hour +, its a win in my book. It reminds me of a little bar in Tokyo, and I've been to Tokyo... 3. the wait. Why? because my appetite grows...and I am able to finish the entire bowl of delicious.

I love Big Black Family/House. Just kidding. Daikokuya ftw! Daikokuya makes it feel like you are living a perfect life. I had recently failed my midterms and once I started tasting the ramen, the ramen told me straight up just like Charlie Sheen "Shut up. Stop. Move forward." I kept going with the ramen, as it was the best ramen I have ever tasted. Daikokuya is WINNING. Everytime I taste the ramen, it's like another Charlie Sheen quote thrown at me. Is the ramen really as winning as Charlie Sheen? Anyway, to sum it all up in one word for Daikokuya: WINNING

Not a bad joint. The goyza is very good IMO. The ramen is average, a lot of food for the bucks and you can't beat the soft boiled egg and the thick slice of pork belly aka bacon! I think the broth is too mellow and needs a bit of a kick. I still like my Shin Sen Gumi Ranmen.

I care less in regards to the claims of inauthenticity that shadows Daikokuya made by the ramen police.  I'm a shameless and devoted customer of Daiko and will happily risk sounding ignorant. The taste of Daiko is undeniable.  I'll never forget my first experience walking into the shop with both awe and wonder at such an exotic yet cozy locale as well as how freaking cool I felt for being at such a hip local joint.  I nearly forgot in actually I'm quite lame! I had originally intended to rate Daiko a 4/5, but a few major things that had only recently surfaced caused my opinion to sway.   Other than the horrendous wait time, my only real concern about this place is the inconsistency of portion, taste, and texture.  I often find myself hoping that the ramen will be prepared just the way I like it, only to find some annoying variation that diminishes my overall enjoyment.  Sometimes the noodles are too firm.  Sometimes the serving of pork is scarce.  Sometimes the egg is underboiled or boiled for too long.  This has been a rather common finding in my more recent visits to Daiko and I'm quite displeased with it.   However, on a brighter note, the staff are very friendly, the service is excellent, and the unique environment is almost unforgettable.  Overall, Daiko is- and always will be- one of my favorite ramen spots in the Los Angeles area.

Absolutely lives up to its hype.  It's the best ramen I've ever had.  Rich, flavorful, delicious.  Staff are super friendly and efficient - they really power through the ever-present line out front.  We showed up with the church crowd on a Sunday and still only waited 20 minutes (party of two, bar seats, worth every second). Had the fried rice to go with, which also didn't disappoint.  Scene is very active; cool kids, families, tourists, locals.  And the kitchen is right there in front of you, chefs keeping pace, calling up orders every other five seconds.  Top recommendation for ramen in LA.

I'd actually give them 3.5 stars, here's why: IMO, apart from Shin Sen Gumi, the Tonkotsu Ramen here is the next best option in LA to the real thing you get in Japan. The soup base is pretty good, and ramen is decent, and here are the buts: The soup is not hot enough when they bring ramen out to you, and by the time you're almost done with the ramen, the soup gets almost luke warm. Luke warm ramen is bad ramen. However, it wasn't the case when I first discovered the place a few years back. Also, the half-cooked egg also seemed to taste better back then. And the portion has gotten smaller over the years as well! Those are the reasons I'm not giving them a 5-star. I think after the 1st few times that I visited the place, it was a 4-4.5 star place, not anymore. The other downside is parking, it's always a pain in that area.

The pan-seared pork belly is unbelievable good here. Its super tender and exploding with flavor. High quality cut of meat expertly cooked. That dish alone is worth waiting in line for but ramen is their specialty and they do not disappoint. The noodles are soft without being soggy and the broth is rich with flavor but not heavy. Portions are huge and the price is reasonable. There is a reason why people rave about this place, go there, eat, be happy.

As good as it gets.   The soup base is bewitching. Even when I was burstingly full, I still wanted to taste the soup as much as the very first sip.  I don't get it.  The fact that they only have one option for ramen shows that you don't really need to get anything else. The story of the soup base is that they use black pork... something? And they brew it overnight at an "undisclosed location".  They also have an option of getting a creamier (aka more fatty) soup.  You can definitely taste the difference.  It's SMOOTH. Downer.  We waited two hours for this.  Yes.  TWO hours.  But usually I hear it's much more bearable, we went around 1:30pm on a Saturday.  So avoid that.  Parking is difficult, but I think there's some lots for $5 flat rate.  And it's Little Tokyo.   $8.50 for ramen. There's also an option to take things to go- noodles, soup, greens, and meat separately.  I thought that was charming.  Their Fried Spicy Tuna was good too.

I've eaten ramen everywhere in the States and this has to be the best I've ever had. I would even say it's as good as the ones I had in Tokyo. We went late-ish around 10p and had to wait 30 minutes, which isn't bad compared to the 2-hour wait my friends had to go through before. Get the Daikokuya ramen; the broth is thick, flavorful and has a thin layer of oil like it should. The noodles are handmade and made with special flour, so it has a good texture to it. The portion size is normal. So if you want more noodles/want leftover, order a side order of it. Now if only they do take-out orders...

One word: Amazing! We had a party of 8, so we ended up splitting into two tables of 4. It was somewhat of a wait, but WELL worth it. After a weekend of otherwise heavy foods, I was ready for some much hyped ramen. I had the Daikokuya Ramen, which was bigger than I thought it would be. I managed to finish it, but I definitely slowed down towards the end. Super flavorful and just... perfection. Friends aren't quite ramen fans, so one of them got a bento with Chicken Teriyaki and the other got the Pork Bowl.

Daikoku Ramen + Koteri. Still have not had better. If anyone knows of something better that I haven't tried, I'm all ears. But until then, Daikokuya still wins best ramen in my opinion. Their little salad is also quite good as an appetizer. Be prepared to wait awhile at this location. Put your name down and go browse the stores of Little Tokyo. I think it's well worth the wait.

Omigod... the ramen is like heaven in my mouth! I had just come from the Murakami exhibit around the corner and was wondering why the heck were there all these people standing outside this little ramen shop?!?!  If the wait rivals the Din Tai Fung crowd, then it's gotta be good, right?

Wow. What a great feeling. I had just gotten out of a concert and after walking through the cold, decided that a bowl of warm ramen was just what we'd needed. Boy, did this restaurant hit the spot. I think the optimal heads in your group is probably just two. There aren't many places to sit in the restaurant due to its size but there definitely were many bar seats so that couples could squeeze in here and there. The ramen, was fabulous. I fel like I was at home! The soup tastes extremely flavorful and the texture of the noodles was excellent. I really could see why they were so well known for their ramen...which reminds me, I really want to try the cold noodles next time. The fried rice was so, so, SO tasty. It tasted so homey!! It was like Asian soul food. yum, yum, yum~ The only complain I have for this place (besides its size and lack of a waiting area on a cold day) is the smoke. I really think they need a vent in there.......I felt like I was inhaling oily smoke the entire time :( Your clothes will smell like it afterward. If you haven't gone and keep passing by it in little Tokyo (like I had), don't hesitate, GO  NOW!!! :) btw, they should be opening a new location in Monterey Park some time VERY VERY soon.

The only thing I have to complain about is the wait -- but it sure gets your appetite ready for the most amazing ramen ever. Seriously, the most amazing ramen ever. I had doubts that this could beat the amazing-ness of Katana-ya in San Francisco, but I was wrong. So wrong. The strips of fatty pork belly and swimming in delicious rich broth with perfect noodles. Yum. I can do w/o the hard boiled egg since I just don't really care for those very much, but my friends said that this egg was perfect bc the yolk was just solidified. Absolutely delicious, can't wait to go back!

My friends and I were looking for a late night dinner around 11ish and when we drove past the store, there were bunch of people standing outside waiting. There were two other ramen places open but we decided to stick with it and see what the hype was all about. You will most likely have to wait in line if you come here with 2-4 people before you. It's a pretty small ramen place with some booths and a bar table for singular seating. I'm not a big fan of ramen so I rarely try them out but this was the exception. I got the daikoku ramen combination with chicken and egg bowl which came out to be around 12 dollars. REALLY CHEAP. only order the combination if your starving because I could not finish everything. You get a salad along with it which is like cole slaw with Japanese salad dressing. You can ask for additional noodles for $2 dollars more. I can't tell between good and bad ramen but this place tasted really good and the soup base was very balanced. I would highly recommend you stay away from the sushi or bento boxes. The service is great. The waiters picked up dishes and refilled water almost right away but did not rush us either. They were very nice and made it very fun place to eat at. I would definitely come back again because this place is pretty good for late night dinners and it is all very cheap. Just be prepared to wait despite what time you come.

This is my new favorite ramen place! (sorry shin-sen-gumi) They only have one ramen - the daikokuya ramen. The broth is amazing. Remember to tell them to add the kotteri flavor, which is back fat from a pig. Its not healthy, but I think it is TOTALLY worth it. It makes the soup so much better and more flavorful. The egg in the ramen is the closest thing to the egg in ramen in Japan that I have found in LA. In Japan, they cook the egg with spring water, which allows the egg to cook but preserve the yolk to be like a soft boiled egg, even though the egg white is like a hard boiled egg. Here, there is no spring water. The eggs in other ramen places are just regular hardboiled eggs, which are not very good. The daikokuya egg is delicious! The portions are pretty big. But if you are a big eater, you can order the combo, which has a bowl of rice along with the ramen. My friend ordered the combo with the tuna bowl, and it was no good. The tuna quality was not very good, but you can't expect high quality fish at a ramen place. Go there for the ramen! The only complaint I have is that the noodles are not cooked as soft as I would like. That's why its 4 stars. NOTE: this place is SMALL. Not really suitable for big groups. If you do go with a big group, either go early or expect a long wait. There is always a line waiting for them to open. That's how you know its good!

We kind of screwed our friend with a visit here.  The scene was a reunion of co-workers, a mix of current ones and laid off ones, and the outing was just a chance to reconnect with everyone.  And now I say screwed because a bunch of them had never been little tokyo to eat, and given the cold nature of the night, the party decided to go Daikokuya... problem with our friend is that he is muslim and can't eat pork... As the menu says, and I'm paraphrasing the fobby english on the menu, "we are mostly carnvirnous, so difficult for veggie eaters, and yeah, pretty much the secret to great ramen is pork melted into the broth."   So what was one man's pain was another man's gain!  For those who could eat the ramen, and me especially, the ramen special was delicious!  I custom ordered harder noodles, and with the ramen broth, green onions, crisped bean sprouts, and juicy and tender pork, I couldn't have been more happier!  And the hard part was suppressing that happiness since I didn't want to show my friend what he was missing, hehe... When you see no line, run here!  Cause otherwise the wait is killer!!!  4 people ahead of us still meant a 40 minute wait!

837619347+ reviews.  What is the point?  I guess I am writing this review just for the Ramen list that will take several thousand years to complete.  Why?  There is no effing ramen in Texas.  You appreciate certain cuisines much more when you live in an area that does not serve it.  First of all, the wait is rather long and the seating areas are rather cramped.   After much deliberation I settled on the Daikoku Ramen with the pork cutlet bowl combo (could feed 2 persons).  Pork belly is so scrumptious that I don't think I would mind spending my life inside the piggy's stomach.  Being wrapped in panko bread crumbs added a great texture.  I also found the mystical golden egg.  The egg in this ramen was so rich and heavenly that you just want to close your eyes and meditate on that thought.  Nirvana achieved.

Hmm... now I must say I am torn. I'd say this place is a VERY close, if not tied, with Shin Sen Gumi for my fave ramen house. I don't know what they put in the ramen broth here but beware because it is DANGEROUSLY addicting. I think that's what I love about this place.. the fact that they get it right without you having to customize anything (like at Shin Sen Gumi).   Noodles are perfect, broth is perfect.. Daikokuya, you are perfect.

Daikokuya is representative of what makes Los Angeles one of the greatest places on Earth. After a brief drive past Skid Row, you end up in Little Tokyo and have what seems like a thousand different Japanese dining options to choose from. Thanks to yelp, our party of five ended up at Daikokuya. The wait was not as bad as it could have been. We waited about 25 minutes for a table, and we provided excellent service the entire time. Once you step inside, it's like you're no longer in Los Angeles. The place has a real nice vibe providing a feel good experience for all your senses. The thing that was shocking to me was the price of everything...in a good way. A bento box with three different options for $13.50? Seriously? Us East Coast folks spend that much on a mediocre lunch most days. The ramen, the teriyaki, the tuna rolls, the miso soup, even the salad here is awesome. Definitely a highlight of our trip. Tough out the wait because it is totally worth it!

This place almost got a 5 star ratin' for me but the only thing that turned me off was the price for a Large bowl and the wait............ The wait: When the cute small Japanese girl tells you it's only gonna be 15 mins...... That translates to 40 mins. Just to give you the heads up. The sizes.... Took my home girl here and she got the small Ramen (6.50), Medium size (8.50) and the Large (12.50..) *I got the large today..... The portions were mighty fine but I was kinda surprised....... I never thought I'd pay 12.50 for a LARGE ass bowl of ramen. Though, it's worth it..... It's legit. Though, I'd go to the one in San Gabriel over this one............

Daikokuya served me up some of the best ramen I've ever had.  EVAR. Their menu is pretty simple: Ramen - wet or dry or Rice Bowl.  Or a combination of both.  Maybe that's why it tasted so good.  With only those things to focus on, they can concentrate on preparing everything to perfection. And oh was that bowl of ramen perfection.  The noodles were done just right (and why is it that LA ramen noodles end up getting that perfect balance of springyness?), the cha siu was slow cooked to melt in your mouth perfection and the broth was slurpable down to the last drop. I love my Tajima and Yakitori Yakyudori in San Diego, but if Daikokuya was down there, they be blown out of the water.

Since Daikokuya is in need of more reviews... 1. Long wait, but worth it 2. DELICIOUS ramen, SUPER DELICIOUS tsukeken (basically cold, deconstructed ramen with hot broth)  Best broth ever 3. Reasonably tasty shredded pork bowl, chicken teri (fattiest chicken you'll ever have that's still delicious), and salad (like japanese coleslaw) 4. Quick, efficient service 5. ******basically no vegetarian options.  You could get edamame or veggie tempura, I guess...

A few years back, I came here after a Dodger game with my Papa for an evening dinner. Papa took me here and we had ramen with tsukemono and Gyoza. I remember my first couple of slurps and was so pleased to discover this place. The soup was unlike any other ramen broth that I have tasted to (that) date. And the Gyoza, Oh the Gyoza! Bite size, covered with negi (green onions). Just the perfect sidekick to a delightful bowl of Daikokuya. We were lucky back then. We had the last two fresh noodles of the night, and they used to close when they ran out of noodles... Fast forward few years over, and though the menu hasn't changed - the service and quality as dimmed. Tonkotsu broth is one of my favorite styles, but I've tasted better since my first visit to Daikokuya -- At my first visit. Perhaps because this place gained recognition within the hipster community and Little Tokyo is quickly becoming of popular state, but the dedication it took to create that epic ramen bowl has never been duplicated since that fateful Dodger night. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy and proud of Little Tokyo's gain to fame throughout the years, and I do hope it only continues. Appreciation of the Japanese community goods and foods? It's about time! But the rippling effect leaves some of the once nearly authentic areas dwindling towards the commercialization of how to make meals faster and with efficiency, resulting in a loss of original flavors. So maybe I'm being ridiculously harsh on Daikokuya, I mean it's a good ramen bowl, no doubt-  But It's no longer in my Top Ramen shops mentally. If only we had met again back then, and again, and again...

Man, there are a lot of reviews for this place. We came here for lunch on a Wednesday. Get there as close to noon as possible or else there may be a long wait. we had to wait about 10 minutes. You have to put your name on the clipboard and wait outside as there is little room inside and no one to greet you. There are only about 8 tables and then a bar where parties of 1 can sit, or if you don't mind being next to the others in your party, larger groups. That said, it moves pretty quick, Most people get the Ramen and it comes in minutes. We did that and were in and out in 30 minutes. The ramen itself was good, but did not really live up to the hype for me. Maybe it's like the Big 3 in Miami, just too much expectation. The noodles were of high quality. One noticable difference is that the broth is not clear at all. The flavor is great in it but the meat slices and egg were not as good as at other places. A good experience, but I'm not sure the hassle is worth it.

The 2nd highest reviewed business in Los Angeles.  FOR A REASON.  Quality of food and service is undoubtedly the best in town.  Being a teeny tiny hole in the wall, you really can't overlook this place, there are always people waiting outside.  Lucky for me, I live right down the street and can wake up 10 mins before 11am on a Sunday and arrive just in time to be seated as soon as they open, weeeeeee I ordered the Daikokuya ramen combo w/ a small shredded pork bowl (comes with salad too).  Both go so well together, and for $11.50, you really can't complain. KTLA 5 Channel News came by on the day I decided to wear gym attire and messy hair to eat so beware rameniacs, tv action is very much possible at this popular establishment.  Oh, and holler at me if you see me on tv, I tried so hard to eat without making a mess and splashing ramen soup on the ginormous camera hovering over my face -__-

Oh em gee.  Casey and I have been wanting to try this place due to the glowing reviews, but the line was always massive.  This past weekend, we decided that we just had to try this coveted ramen, and oh boy, was it worth it! The wait about 45 minutes... So I'm sorry, I just have to give it four stars for that, because I was HUNGRY!  We both ordered the standard Ramen, which came steaming hot, full of fresh green onions, bean sprouts, bamboo, pork, and a hard boiled egg.  The broth is DELECTABLE and the noodles are the perfect consistency - al dente, just the way I like it! I only ate half of my ramen, and enjoyed leftovers the next day.  The noodles kind of soak up the broth, but adding a little chicken stock revives the soup and broth, and it tastes almost as good as in the restaurant! We can't wait to go back :-)

Uh, no. Super hyped-up to a point where you'd think this is the best ramen shop in town. More like -- best ramen shop on the street (there are only 2). I just read a review that said "Best ramen i've EVER had in my life." Have you only eaten Instant Ramen? Meh. Daikokuya is simply average Joe. Oh another note, it's super stuffy and hot inside.

Still hands down my favorite ramen place. ...except no one ever wants to come here with me because of the long lines But the soup! It's so flavorful, and the egg in all its softboiled glory, the melt in your mouth pieces of pork... Drool. I say it's worth the wait. Anyway, you can try to walk around little Tokyo to kill time. Just make sure you're back before they call your name. I wish they would offer the half portion like the SGV location though. My tummy can't handle all the savory noodle goodness, but it makes me sad to let any of the deliciousness go to waste. Anyway want to be my Daikokuya buddy?

The absolute option when you want ramen, but not necessarily hot soup on a hot, summer day...   HIYASHI CHU-KA = COLD NOODLES with sprouts, tomato, pork, cucumber, turkey, egg and avocado.  Your choice of Soy or Sesame.  Monkey do SESAME. Put your name on the clipboard and remember the number next to your name.  Now GET OUT AND WAIT for your name and/or number to be called.  They are very good at coming outside and calling for you.  They'll even mark down who were called, but did not respond.  DO NOT stand inside, surround the nearest table and watch Monkey eat...  or we shall s l o w  d o w n . . . . .

Everyone's all about the ramen at this place.  Rather than reiterate, I'll yelp about the other thing I've been craving--their cabbage side salad.  It's good.  The dressing's good.  They put the head of cabbage on their "home-made" food processor, which cuts the cabbage into little slivers.  I saw this contraption and thought it was the best thing ever (at the moment).   Based on quality of the food and the "Kirin on top" neon sign, I give this place four stars with a smile.  Though parking's a pain and the wait for a table can be long, it's well worth the effort.

The pork broth is brewed to perfection, and the chasu is unbelievable awesome with its right tenderness of its noodle. I've fallen in love over and over..

I'm a big believer in taking crappy items off the menu; stick to what you know and don't serve crap (fish) here.   So stick to Oyaka bowl and Ramen and Takana.   The service here is always poor and though there is no excuse for poor service (it's not fast food), the ramen is worth coming back for. Shinsengumi has a better vibe and a staff that drinks with you.  The last time at Daikokuya, behind the counter were 2 Mexican cooks and 1 Hapa waiter.  In LA we have become a mish-mosh juxtaposition of everyone, losing cultural ties and trying to chase the pretty penny by cutting costs, even on the front lines (The chef??).  I guess that is what makes us Angelenos.  Where's the authenticity?   Ah well, the ramen was good.

Oh, it's *this* ramen place, the one always with the grip of people waiting outside all the time. There was this time, once ago, in which I decided to brave the wait and line to see what the hubbub was about. And now I won't hesitate to wait in line again, I've been a converted Daikokuya fan. What can I say that hasn't been said already? One of the best tonkotsu ramen in LA, really. If you love the pork, you will love the tonkotsu. For extra flavor, go for the kotteri. Adds an extra level of heavy taste, but you'll love it if you really want to up the intensity of the ramen broth. The rice is also fried in the same pork fat, for that extra piggy goodness if you aren't feeling like noodles. Well I guess you can get both, or save it for a take-out order for the next day. Either way, your stomach will thank you.

Look how many Yelp Reviews this place has got! It's ridiculous! Definitely a place to take friends who are visiting from out of town.   Remember the college days when you'd have ramen noodles for breakfast, lunch, and dinner? I do. Erase any misconception you may have about the instant noodle and try Daikokuya. Daikokuya serves up no ordinary instant noodle. The key to their success is the slow boiled broth, the traditional ramen noodle, and fresh ingredients. Also on the menu are rice bowls and home-made gyozo that are out of this world! One visit to Daikokuya will make you a believer and look at ramen noodles in a different light.

We went for an early dinner and we waited about five minutes, but sometimes lines about 30 to 40. Not a place for big parties this is a tiny place.  But so worth the wait we used to frequent the shop a few doors down but what were we thinking, this place rocks and the service and staff are excellent. Fried rice as my side plate dang I have never tasted anything so delicious, they add a few sprigs of ginger on top and boy it brings out the flavors, soup was hot and good with the sliced pork, not sure I like the whole egg in it but hey it's your prerogative.  Prices were decent for amount of food you get.

Rating 7.75 (out of 10) For those of us who remember the movie, "Tampopo", the first Japanese noodle western (self-proclaimed on its movie poster; also one of Ken Watanabe's first films shown in America), Daikokuya is a reminder that even the most simple of foods, when given care and the respect due it, can be transformed into a wonderful culinary delight.   Most of us remember ramen as something we ate when the cash flow was running a bit thin during college, and the Kraft mac & cheese was getting real old, real fast.  Daikokuya turns making ramen into an art form, with its rich full broth (which can and should be ordered "full flavored" - translation: more fat please!) and tender, yet stout noodles. It's both a reminder of our youth and a satisfying way to curb one's hunger for comfort food, asian style! You can order the Daikokuya Ramen, a la carte, or as a part of a combo.  If you decide you need more food than just the ramen, I would suggest the donkatsu combo.  The pork is tender, and they must marinade it overnight because each bite explodes with flavor.  At first, you wonder where is the donkatsu sauce?  But after just one bite, you know it must have already been infused into the flesh of the pig for it to taste so beautifully.  I personally would steer clear of the Tempura, only because they drizzle the tempura sauce over it and the rice, and it becomes soggy very quickly.   I guess the only knock is the wait.  They have only 5 tables and counter seats customary to Japanese ramen houses.  But if their only knock is the wait, isn't that a good sign?  Oh wait, one more knock...I hear that they only make a certain amount of soup base for a day, and once it runs out, your SOL, but again as with the last point, doesn't that prove just how seriously they take this?  I can almost hear Gun saying, "Lesson 1, boiling water," from the back.   If you don't know where this line comes from, watch Tampopo.  You won't be disappointed.  Neither will you from dining at Daikokuya.  Bon Appétit!

4.5 stars!  We got the Daikokuya Ramen, I love the huge portions!    It might not seem that large when you first look at it, and even kind of sparse, but once you start eating it... oh man!  They say the soup is made starting from the afternoon, and soaked in pork bones and meat for hours and hours, and you can definitely taste it in every sip!   And the noodles are thicker than most places'.  My only little qualm is that I thought there would be more meat... there were only 2 slices, and half of it was fat... not sure if it's supposed to be like that.  But it was very flavorful, so I guess it semi- makes up for it. The wait is enormous.  Maybe it's also because we went on a sunday.  We had to wait for 45 minutes because the restaurant is soooo tiny.  But the neighborhood (Little Tokyo) is nice and it's a good time to explore the other stores.  There's an adult video store a couple stores down that's deceptively called "family market"... watch out.  unless that's what you're looking for.  Anyway, I would come back here to try the other things besides the ramen, the fried rice smelled really good!

I'm sure there's not much I can add.... but there are a few things I need to say. :) 1. As you all know, the wait is long. When the waitress asked if we wouldn't mind letting a larger group be seated first (only a few tables can seat the larger groups) she offered us free gyoza and drinks. It was amazing. Yay. 2. The ketori. YUM. Obviously very fatty but soooo worth it. tip: go right when it opens. you'll wait the least. :)

This place is by far, the best ramen place i have ever been to.  Before this place I had tried other ramen joints thinking "what's the big deal???  This tastes like top ramen with some meat and stuff in it". Daikokuya is like nothing other.  The soup is amazing, cooked all day long (and my friend orders it "extra fatty" if you dare).  The kurubota pork melts in your mouth, and the noodles are always cooked to perfection and taste incredibly fresh.   It is totally worth the wait and you better get there early on sunday's because they close as soon as they run out of soup. You don't know amazing ramen until you've been to Daikokuya.

Prepare for some blasphemy! After the reviews and the hype and the crowds standing outside, I decided that it was due time I had some Daikokuya ramen... it's gotta be that good, right? So I brave the dinner rush, put my name on the list for 1 (best chance to get a seat, right?) and in 5 minutes took a seat at the counter.  Everyone is friendly, and very quick about their service.  It's not quite a hole in the wall, but almost... cool atmosphere. I have myself a ramen + fried rice combo.  I was hoping and praying for a mind-blowing first sip.... and nothing.  I'm sorry to say that it's definitely not the best ramen I've had.  Ignore the ramen I had in Japan, I would say that I prefer the stuff at Santouka in Costa Mesa, where the broth and pork slices are much more flavorful.  The ramen noodles were on par with each other.   The fried rice was very good, freshly made and terrific flavor on its own... I did enjoy a few drops of soy sauce, but I just like soy sauce. Total cost = $16 for a large bowl of ramen, small fried rice (side of cabbage salad included), drink, tax, and tip. Now, I will admit that it's some pretty darn good eats but now that I've gone, I'd have to say that I'm not going to go through any extra effort to eat here again.  If I can get a table within 5-10 minutes, then great... otherwise, I'll just go somewhere else. NOTE: There is a sign by the door that clearly says NO MORE TAKE-OUT.

This place definitely has amazing Ramen but I wouldn't say it is the best I've ever had. After two trips to the street parking meter to extend another hour, I finally was seated at the bar area of the restaurant. I can't blame if they have such a great demand but I expected something perhaps more unique after waiting 90 minutes. Not sure if trying out so many different Ramen restaurants has made me a bit picky but in all fairness, I believe this place deserves 4 stars, nonetheless, delicious. I also recommend the fried rice. I think I'll try different dishes at this place until I can be another 5 star giver. Only thing I disliked is how they dump the egg inside the bowl.  For people like myself who happen to hate eggs this is no good.  I wish it came on the side so I could give it to someone in my party.

So, I went here earlier this week with a friend and found myself not exactly blown away as most people are. The ramen itself was pretty solid, soup base and noodles, they got points for putting a whole egg in there (despite the fact that it was overboiled) they also got points for their combination option which I got a mini-tempura bowl which was amazingly stuffed. But, I had wished they gave me a plate on the side since i had to eat half of it to get close to the rice since it was such a small bowl. The reason why this place got a star taken off was for: lack of hot sauce option. Do they not have any variety of their own? I know a lot of ramen places that carry their own kind. which wasn't a big deal, the major blow to my review is the service (i.e. waitress) Our waitress really needed to be re-trained in how to treat customers. The only time she smiled was when she brought us our check. I dont see what her problem was since the place wasn't even packed yet and it was just me and another friend, so it wasn't like there was a big party or something. I even accidentally dropped my spoon and asked repeatedly for a new one and NEVER got one. WTF?! Like I said, the ramen is good and the noodles are good, but they need to work on their service. You can't rely on your cooks to make up for your lacking waitresses just like you wouldn't go to a place serving terrible food if you got all smiles from the waitress, would you? For now, this place gets (3) stars for me. I'll try it again in the future and hope that we get a more competent waitress next time.

I'm not sure if its because of my recent return from SF's famous Santa's Ramen (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…) or just the general flu that i was suffering during my visit. But Daikokuya was in a serious lack of flavor when it came to their pork based Ramen. So there i was on a sick Sunday morning, when good eating friend called me up for some ramen. Being the recipient of stuffy nose, i figured that some hot soup and noodle will do the trick. So we head down to Little Tokyo's 1st St. and she points out that she has heard many good things about Daikokuya. I, recently came back from a whirlwind ramen eating experience from SF was really into trying local place. As the Shin Sen Gumi store in San Gabriel really didnt hit the spot a few night back. So there i was thinking the long line and ramen-store-clip board was going to result in some sort of 30 min+ wait, but instead we slipped easily onto the bar stools. I do like the interior, it has a very cool japanese hip thing going. The entire store is lined with vintage 40-50s advertisements. Though a TV playing the sunday football game with bad reception was rather weird, specially since it was muted and the stereo was blasting japanese music. Anyways, we order 2 appetizers, the Sausage and Gyozas. I have to say though the Sausage and Gyozas were rather tasty. Which gave me high hopes for the coming Ramen bowl. And when it came, i was rather disappointed. The soup was pretty blend in taste and the noodles were rather chewy, but in a packaged ramen chewy, not that bouncy chewy feel you get from boba balls... It did come with a oddly shaped egg, and some pork, which was alright at best. Oh well, another ramen that was rather disappointing. But i would recommend going there, if you are in the neighborhood and want some ramen, its not bad...

I don't have much experience with Ramen, but I love anything with noodles and one day, instead of sushi, I really searched for some noodles in Little Tokyo. I first went here after an exhibit at MOCA. Being evening on Saturday, the wait was about 45 minutes but boy was it worth it. That stock they say they cook all day is beyond delicious. My friend described it best when she said it tastes like, "Butter and Bacon." Yum!

DAMN, DAMN , DAMN! Why i haven't eaten here earlier, I don't know..... maybe it's the crazy line i always see going out their doors each time I'm in the area... but my honey and I finally got to taste what all the commotion is all about and we are major fans. First , the size of that ramen bowl was pretty big, I might have to share next time. Secondly, the milkiness in  their broth is one I have not tasted before. All I can say is YEAH to pork fat. Third, those were the best bowl of ramen noodles we h ve ever had. The noodles were cooked to perfection, the broth is so tasty and silky, and the pork belly included in the bowl is a nice touch. I will definitely go back again, I may actually go to the Costa Mesa branch since it's closer to my work. But call me a FAN.

This might be the best Ramen place I have ever been to!!!  Even my bestfriend says this place smells like Japan.  The broth is a secret passed down for hundreds of years.  It's made at a secret location then transfered to  Daikokuya.  I would say that the broth is the star of the show.  The noodles are meaty.  I kind of like the ones at Hakata Ramen better but thats just preference.  They used kurobata pork there, its amazing, buttery and soft (what ramen place can boast that kind of quality?).  The egg they drop in the soup is super flavorful for a hard/soft boiled egg deal.  The decor is all vintage japanese posters and the like.  Little Toyko is out of my reach but I will return especially for that broth.. PS it is essential that you put this garlic salt shiz in your ramen, one dollop will do to give it extra flavor.. OMG. died.

Four stars? Really? Had to wait a little while just for 3 ppl to sit at the bar where i had an awesome view of  the back of what I think was part of the stove.  Couldn't see anything. It would've been a lot cooler if I had a better seat and if the wait wasn't so long. I ordered the Daikoku Ramen combo with eel bowl. Started with a bowl of cabbage salad which was pretty good for a salad. When the ramen arrived, I ate the pork first and it that was it. I couldn't believe how tasty it was! Melt-in-your-mouth-y goodness. I was really impressed. Then I tried the noodles and it was like, wtf is this? I know the noodles should be a little al dente, but these noodles were pretty crap. I felt like it came from a pack. Orochon has better noodles.They perfected the boiled egg though. It was juuuuuust right. Soup was a tad too salty. Woke up with the typical swollen eyelid in the morning. Everyone was saying it was really authentic though. Like a typical ramen house in Japan. They had some cool old-timey Japanese print ads on the walls and were playing Japanese music videos on a teeny blurry television by the front door. I'd come back during a less busy hour to try some of the other items on the menu, but for now I'm still skeptical. It didn't help that a mutual friend hyped it up like crazy.

I've been here twice, both times there was an extremely long wait to be served. It might cost 20x more than "top" but it is so much better. Daikokuya is also one of the few places open for late night food in downtown, so big points for that. I wish they did to go food. First time I was here, I ordered the regular ramen. Last time I got the kichi men, which is their slightly more "flavorful" variant on their ramen base. I liked the regular ramen better. The kichi men was wayyyy to salty. That egg is the tastiest hardboiled egg I have ever had. I hear you can order the egg with different firmness than the standard fully cooked; i will have to try it more runny next time.

Japanese lesson of the day for Daikokuya: 1) TONKOTSU - pork bone stock that Daikokuya specializes in originating from Kyushu, Japan. 2) KUROBUTA - Berkshire pork *black pig* that is the kobe beef of pork from Kyushu.  Please order the kurobuta pork belly chashu appetizer here. 3) CHAHAN - fried rice from Daikokuya might be the best in socal with pieces of Kurobuta (see above). 4) KOTTERI - rich, fatty flavor that you can add to your ramen. 5) GOCHISOUSAMA - what you should say after every wonderful meal.

The portions here are huge!  Tried the Daikokuya Special Ramen with a side of Pork Belly Rice Bowl!  Yum!  Also the gyoza are home made, not frozen or just heated up.   The base is well made and the noodles fresh, slippery and easy to slurp.  Definitely worth trying if you're in the neighborhood.

The ramen was alright.  The shredded pork bowl tasted like an unagi bowl one can get easily somewhere else.  The fried rice was a hit for it's chashu pork. All in all, a decent place for a ramen crave but nothing worth 1+ hours of wait.

I have gone on a ranen hunt since Orenchi converted me. This place is supposed to be the Orenchi of LA, so naturally my friends took me there when I was visiting. It was new year's eve, and we had a relatively early dinner, around 6. There was a bit of a line. After sitting down, we each ordered a bowl of noodles. I only went with half a bowl because the regular bowl looked quite huge. So for the portion and price, Daikokuya 1, Orenchi 0. We also ordered Gyoza, tuna tempora (finely chopped tuna in shiso leaves) and fried rice. Gyoza was pretty good but the tuna was about average, as the deep frying cooked the tuna. The fried rice was rich with porky goodness and restored my faith in fried rice after being disappointed by mediocre Asian restaurants. The noodles was what I focused on. With extra kotteri, the broth was rich and flavourful. Noodles themselves cooked to the perfect al dente. Without side by side comparison with Orenchi, it was hard to say if one was better than the other, but they were definitely the best two I have ever had. The only thing made Orenchi win out is the egg, because Daikokuya's was not perfectly soft boiled. Service was good too, helpful and fast. When we ordered the rice, which normally comes with miso soup, he suggest switching it to a small salad for us since we were already have noodles.

I'm indifferent to authentic ramen. While it's good, I'm perfectly content with the super cheap, instant variant (NongShim!). So why do I even mess with the Daikokuya lines? SHREDDED PORK BOWL. Despite being one of the cheaper entrees, it's unequivocally the most flavorful.

DON'T BELIEVE IT, WORST RAMEN IN THE CITY!  YOU SHOULD NEVER COME HERE!

Decent ramen place, but there is a wait. Waited for about 45 - 60 min for a table / bar area. We finally got seated and I ordered the combo - ramen with the fried rice. My rice came and it was very good..moist and it had pieces of chicken (I think) in it. The ramen came and it was such a big bowl - good portion size. It was good, but I ate too much of the fried rice and had to take some of it home. The broth was good as well - it has a fattie pork taste and feel to it. I still like Hakata ramen better as their ramen melts in your mouth. This place is decent if you are in Little Tokyo area, but just be prepared for a wait. The staff is definitely friendly.

Can you believe this place even had a line for people to sign up on the clipboard? Well, I was very skeptical about having to wait so long, but after reading a few reviews, I knew I couldn't skip out. And I am so glad I decided to wait the 1.5 hours to get a seat in this tiny, oh so yummy ramen house. Heh, even my parents didn't mind the wait after they got their first bite. First off, the prices here are super affordable. You can honestly get a filling meal for about $10! Oh heck yeah, considering I'll be going back to school, I'll definitely need to find some budget-friendly places. Second, our order came out super fast and was served piping hot and mouthwatering-ly aromatic. Yeah, people say you eat with your eyes first, but smelling food comes at a close second. I got so excited when my food finally came out that I burnt my tongue trying to slurp up the broth of my Daikoku Ramen. Maybe I should've been smart and ordered the Tsukemen like my parents. Oh well! The ramen was delicious. Just the right proportions of salt, meat, and noodles. It didn't taste like it had tons of MSG, so I was not shy about drinking my broth after I finished my noodles. Their iced green tea was the right drink to cleanse my palate after an awesome meal. I wanted to try their ramen with the extra pork fat (I think it's called the Koteri) but unfortunately, they ran out for the night )and to think, it was only 8PM! I need to get here earlier next time. Another thing on my to-try list is their fried rice. A couple ordered it and it looked amazing. Gotta make a mental note for my next trip, because oh hell yeah, I'll be back. ;)

My previous visits to Daikokuya were SUPERB and I feel in love with it, BBUT, because of my last "experience," I will probably give a second thought before going there again. I ordered what I usually get: the Daikoku Ramen with Mini Fried Rice and a side of gyoza. Unfortunately, only the fried rice turned out normal (BTW, I wish I can have fried rice like that everyday!!!) Anyways, the ramen turned out to be quite bland compared to the ones I had before, and it was not hot, and I LIKE MY RAMEN BLAZING HOT!!!!!!!! \ But that didn't bother me too much, but what shocked me was that the gyoza was UNDERCOOKED. The skin had a little powdery texture to it and the meat was pink and I found out when I was eating my last piece -__-........... Of course, I complained and the guy did offer me another order, but because I was too full, he kindly took it off my bill and apologized. I still like the place, but now I am not just no sooo fanatic about it  :(

I been here twice in the past two and half weeks. haha. That should say something. First time I went I had the ramen without koteri, but it's not as flavorful and tasty as the ramen with koteri (extra pork fatty broth). Even though it's like a heart attack in a bowl. It is most certainly worth it! The combos are especially awesome. It is always hard to finish though since the ramen bowl is HUGE. I had the mini tuna bowl, shredded pork bowl, and fried rice. I think they are all delicious. Just depends on what you are craving that day. yay for daikokuya ramen!!!!!!!!!

Why post a review when there are 3400+.  We sat at the counter which turned out to be excellent because the Wok was in front of me and I watched some amazing cooking.  My friends had the specialty ramen, so to be different I and had the 2nd specialty which is hot broth with cold noodles and everything on the side.  I'm not sure why they serve it on the side as opposed to all in the bowl, but there must be some reason.  Maybe the noodles get less saturated so you taste more noodle than soup.  The soup was good, but like Eli G said, it may not be worth standing 45 minutes on the sidewalk when there are other  ramen options next door.  The amazing thing for me was watching the chef make fried rice and gyoza.  Next time, i'm trying that gyoza because it didn't look like the typical dim sum gyoza.  It looked like 4 eggrolls frying on one side in a pan and then the chef peeled a thin sheet of something crispy brown from the pan around the gyoza creating a skirt.  WOW.  I have to have the Gyoza next time.

What can I say... this place is friggen' bomb. Honestly out of all the ramen places I have tried in LA, Daikokuya is the ultimate contender. The wait is extremely long if you go on weekend nights, but definitely worth it in every way. The restaurant may be small, but taste/proportion of the ramen will blow you away. I ordered the combo: ramen + ikura(Salmon eggs over rice) the last time I went which cost me about $12... and it was awesome! It's authentic, it's satisfying, and leaves you wanting more. I've tried other hole-in-the-wall places like Foo Foo Tei (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…), but after eating here, Daikokuya is the best ramen by far. Never settle for less when you're in Little Tokyo. Daikokuya will serve you justice.

I think I'll be forever indebted to my Kaori-chan for showing me that there is much more to ramen than soggy noodles swimming in a bowl of over-salted soup base. Unfortunately that is what I've sadly become accustomed to... and my expectations for Daikokuya (in my mind, just another ramen house) on this particular Saturday morning was just that... mediocre. Until I sat down with a piping hot bowl of Daikoku Ramen-- the first sip of soup... ridiculous. The deep flavors rounded out to clear perfection. The first bite into the thin slices of pork... only one way to describe it: Smooooth like butta. Pay no mind to the lack of Ramen selection on the menu, when it's THAT good, there needs no other substitute.

I know the secret to this restaurant's success and its pretty simple. Have people wait 40 minutes in line for their turn in slurping up noodles and while they wait, they will grow more desperate and hungry to try their famous noodles making any food as delicious as a 5-star meal. As customers wait inside and outside the restaurant for their turn in one of their elusive booths, their stomachs in the meantime churn for noodles and rice as other customers slurp away their dishes as slow as possible. Laughing and gleefully looking at customers waiting in line as they eat their food, they make sure that everyone around them can hear the slurping that goes on to make sure everyone knows that their food tastes absolutely delicious.   Not so great for groups 5 or more, this place is divey and very fast paced. Food comes out quickly and sometimes you can catch the action in the kitchen while you wait for your meal prepared in minutes (maybe seconds). I'm not going to argue about the taste of the noodles as it depends on how you grew up eating noodles as the flavor can be a hit or miss for anyone. This place can be absolutely fabulous or a disgusting rat hole depending on how you handle close encounters and tight spots. In summary, you need to try and give this place a shot since this place is a definite must-try in an increasingly popular place that people love to rave about.

I stand corrected. Since my first review of this place, when I gave it 3 stars because "the food was good, but the wait was insane" I have been to Daikokya two more times! There must be crack in the broth because I've had an insatiable hunger for ramen and an unexplainable willingness to drive to downtown, pay for parking, and write my name on their clipboard, drooling all the while. Also, I didn't wait as long for the last two visits. If you go on a weekday, the wait seems to be shorter. And, in any case, they bring the food to you so quickly that the wait ends up not being THAT bad. Since my first review I've also visited a few other ramen places and it only solidified Daikokuya's awesomeness. Points for Daikokuya: - The portion of soup you get for the money ($8.50 for a gigantic bowl) is unmatched by any of the other places I've been to. I'm 5'2" and usually only eat half of the food served to me. The rest of my food is passed to my boyfriend mainly because he eats twice as fast as I do so he needs something to pass the time with while I happily slurp away. Not here. This is the one place ever where I've finished my food before him and witnessed him quit before cleaning his bowl. The consequence for me was a visibly enlarged stomach. I was stuffed! - The pork melts in your mouth. The last few places I've been to required me to chew my meat, how dare they! - It's right around the block from Yogurtland. Yeah, I've seen you- those of you seated before me- grabbing dessert there. I can't blame you. It's the best reward for the drive and the experience of parking. Great! I'm hungry now.

We love the ramen here. We hate waiting in line for it.  Even if you line up up before they open, you will be in a line of 20 people, at least.  The ramen is definitely worth waiting for though.  I love the ramen with chicken egg bowl and my husband orders the ramen with eel bowl.  The extra pork appetizer is worth trying as well.  Man this is making me hungry.   I have no idea why they haven't expanded because they could be making twice the bank.

The last time I wrote a review on SO CAL ramen I received hate mail from a loyal "Mr. Ramen" customer, associate, or maybe it was even the owner (who knows?). Instead of taking feedback well, he sent me hate mail about how horrible my teeth are. What an idiot. Well after he reads my review on DAIKOKUYA, I think I may be receiving more hate mail. After my horrible experience at Mr. Ramen, I had given up on SO CAL Ramen and declared Northern Cali the winner of the Ramen wars. Oh boy was I wrong! If I had only walked a few stores down, SO CAL would have won...*hands down. Daikokuya is everything Mr. Ramen wishes it could be: #1 - People on Yelp actually love Daikokuya (Take that sticker off Mr. Ramen) #2 - The broth is mucho deliciouso. #3 - Super friendly & attentive staff. #4 - Authentic. #5 - Knows how to treat out-of-towners. Despite the hour long wait on a Saturday night, I enjoyed my experience at Daikokuya. Although they do not have a variety of different broths and add-ons that other ramen places have (a la Katana ya in SF), what they do have is one excellent bowl of pork broth ramen. When I am in LA, you can be sure I will visit Daikokuya! You can suck it, Mr. Ramen!

This is the place where I had my first real bowl of ramen.  The broth is flavorful and is excellent.  The pork is amazing good.  I usually order the Daikokuya ramen and the teriyaki chicken bowl.  The chicken is tender and the skin is perfectly crispy.  I have also tried the unagi bowl and its also great.  If you're "hungry, hungry" you can order the super size bowl of ramen, plus a rice bowl.  I finished it one time, but will not order it again because it was just too much food.  I had "the itis" when I was done. I always enjoy eating ramen at this place.  Expect to wait because this place is always busy.  The wait time is generally around 45 minutes each time I went.  I have always sat at the bar area (located right in front of the hot boiling pots) and it gets really hot.  It is pretty cool that you get a chance to see how the awesome food is prepared for you.  Only street parking is available for this place.  They also accept credit cards.   This place is by far the best ramen place I have been to as of yet.  I have tried other places, but Daiikokuya is still the winner.  If you're looking for great epic ramen, then stop by this place, put your name on the waiting list, wait the 45 minute tease time, and enjoy.   Bon Appetit!

5 stars all the way...need I say more? It was the 3 of us for dinner, and we arrived a little after 6:45PM on a Wed. The wait was manageable, only 15 minutes, and the hostess was very friendly, after telling her we came all the way over from NC for a little taste of Japan. Started off with the best terriyaki chicken and gyoza ever! Ended up ordering the standard Daiko ramen combo with the Shredded pork. Just amazing. Fantastic broth, nicely textured noodles. The egg is to die for. Place got super busy as we finished up around 8PM!

What it tries to be: The best ramen ever. What it is: The best ramen ever. Value: Amazing. For $8.50 you get a huge bowl of ramen that is enough for 2 meals Environment: Hole in the wall, very packed, there's always a line. I've gotten lucky though and was there with my gf and while large groups were waiting and walked right in....The smart money is on waiting for a while. HINT: While waiting for your name to get called go down the block (if you're looking at Daikokuya, go right) to this nice bar that is about 100 yards down in an alley...great imported beers and they play old movies on a projector. Would i go again: HELL YES. Better than/Worse than: Better than Santouka in Mitsuwa on La Cienega and Better than Tajima in San Diego. Notes: OMG. I'm Filipino so I know good pork, and the pork in the ramen at this place is some of the best pork I've ever tasted. The pork pieces literally melt in your mouth...I'm salivating while writing this. The broth is amazing. The marinated boiled egg that sucks up all the juices from the broth is so amazing that the next time I go there I'm asking for extra egg. if you haven't been here, GO. HERE.

oh gosh! I can say one of thee best Ramen places in LA! :) My friends and I took a trip here today and I couldn't wait to write a review for it! We woke up pretty early for a Sunday and made out way to Little Tokyo! Luckily, we found a nice spot in front of the restaurant and thankfully it was Sunday! We didn't have to pay for parking! I couldn't believe there was a line waiting before it was even open! Another lucky thing is we were able to get in right when they opened their doors! (I was so excited, I felt like I was at Disneyland.. okay maybe I'm overracting lol)  It was a cute and cozy place! Kinda small, but the apologize for it on their menu! haha We all ordered daikoku ramen and two of us got the large portions (Large is about $4 more, but it was LARGE! I didn't even finish it!) This Daikoku ramen came with the broth, noodle, pork, egg, green onions, bamboo shoot, and bean sprouts. The broth was TO DIE for! Delicious and so great for my sore throat. The pork was good and tender! The noodles was delicious! Thank goodness that we came early, worth the waking up at 9am and driving our butts to LA! After we left, we noticed the line got longer outside! I can't wait to go again!! :)

Wait was looooooooooong. If I'm rating this based on taste: 5 stars. based on healthiness: -5 stars. ( so so sorry!) Had their ramen, with and without kotteri, popular fried rice and "shredded" (more like cubed)pork with rice (manager's pick). SPOILER ALERT! Here's the thing, if you come here and just order a ramen, you'd probably won't know, but if you order quite a bit of food that you need to take your leftover to-go, you'd be thoroughly surprised at how much CHUNKS OF PORK FAT is in EVERYTHING after leaving it in room temperature for a couple of hours. I believe kotteri is the added fat. But even if you get the ramen without kotteri, there's still quite a bit in there. I mean, that's why it tastes so good in the first place, right? Even if you can't see the melted fat in the soup, the slices of pork isn't so lean either. I was sad to find that my leftover fried rice was infused with fat. I first noticed the to-go box had white chunks of lard spilling out of it. Thought to myself that it must have been some creamy sauce. But on second thought, there WAs no sauce in the fried rice in the first place. So, guys, I, too, refused to believe it was pork fat, Took a bite..... yea, white mushiness, and it isn't the rice. =/ I quickly looked through the shredded pork rice leftover. There it was again, BUT not as much. Took a bite of the pork.... unfortunately... of the ten pieces of pork, 8 pieces were chunks of pork fat. =/ I still give it 4 stars because, hey, the food is pretty good! Just.. Eat sparingly :) Also, I'd prefer the Little Tokyo location over the Monterey Park one. The ramen is fresher.

Ramen..ramen...ramen......Probably in the top of the list of ramen noodle places anywhere. Took the entire family, plus a friend to a Little Tokyo field trip on a Friday afternoon. Looked over a Diakokuya and saw no more that 4 people in line outside. So.....we said.....Lets take advantage of the relatively short line......so we did. Waited for about 20 mins and boy.....it was sure worth it! The place is small, probably easy to miss, but it may very well be the only one on First Street with a Yellow awning outside. So......look for that. Inside, it is relatively a decent sized place....if there are only a couple of you in your group, take the bar, you might have better luck getting seated earlier. We ordered the Daikokuya Ramen Combinations.....let's talk about them in general.....SHEESH!!! Unless you are starving to death, those combinations are a lot of food!!! We had the following combos, Tuna Sashimi, Katsu-donburi, and Tempura. All were pretty good! The combos start with a nice light salad of shredded cabbage, carrots with a creamy ginger, sesame, soy dressing. They give you a good sized portion of it too. The tuna was fresh although the rice was a tad over vinegar-ed for me. Too much tang. I like it just seasoned enough to highlight the freshness  of the fish without masking any of its faults. The katsu-don was really good. Perfectly seasoned and not too salty, the katsu was well cooked and not greasy. The tempura was really good. Nice cluster of sweet potatoes, carrots, onions and one shrimp. Now.....for the Ramen itself. I cannot say enough good things about it. Every detail of the bowl was perfection. They really know their Ramen bowls!!! The broth was heaven, rich but not too heavy, I can only imagine a big pot with soup bones simmering in it, extracting their goodness to make this wonderful meal - Perfectly seasoned, not much fat floating on top.....just perfect broth! The noodles.....cooked to a perfect ramen-al-dente. Firm with enough give for that nice tug...slurp after slurp. Even the egg was excellently cooked with just a touch of runny-ness in the yolk. If I had anything negative to say, probably the slices of meat.....although nicely seasoned and cooked, they had to use pork belly which was too fatty for me. I'd give it 4.5 stars!.......but then, I got the bill and for about $15 per person (after tip) I had to give it 5-stars as we burped our way to the Japanese Village Plaza!!!

I made the trek from Irvine to Little Tokyo today because I had to taste what my friend calls the best ramen he's ever had. I heard a lot about Daikokuya. Okay, 20 minute wait, bathroom smells like rotting food, and kitchen is unsanitary (let me get back to that in a sec) but this place lives up to the hype. Sitting at the bar, you are inches away from two enormous boiling vats of creamy white pork-bone broth. The cooks move back and forth, nonstop, ladling pots full of broth into 6 or so bowls of ramen at a time, cook several baskets of noodles at once, and then top them with thinly-sliced fatty port slices and a fistful of green onions. Quite a show, but I couldn't help but notice the pre-cooked donkatsu (breaded pork) and burned pork slices just sitting on the counter to the left... I was there for a good half hour and no attention was paid to the grill area, it was fithly. Also, there was a panko breadcrumb container in the shelf above and I could clearly make out something that was shaped like food... I don't know what it was, but I just kept picturing them plucking it out of the breadcrumb vat at any given time and dropping it into the fryer, and voila fresh pork cutlet... I guess they earned that B health code rating. Why do they deserve 5 stars then? Well, the ramen itself saved the day. Until orange county ramen steps up to this level of refinement, I have no right to give Daikokuya any worse a rating than any of the orange county joints. Costa Mesa has four or so notable ramen houses, and all of them are MSG water with crap noodles. Shin Sen Gumi is the only notable exception, but they need to be a less stingy with the pork and toppings. My only real criticism is that the noodles are not chewy enough and I believe they do this because chewy noodles get soggy too fast so this makes for a more consistent product.... that's my guess. If i'm in the area, I will go back there again, it's worth the drive and the wait.

2009 01 02 Daikoku Ramen (Kotteri) - Very flavorful ramen. The soup base was filling, buttery, and had a solid good taste to it. The egg noodles were great. Not too firm and not too soft, but just right. The serving size was very large as well. As a side note, i had this with the kotteri flavor which is very fatty. They don't pull any punches with this fatty version of the ramen, so get it if you don't mind being incredibly unhealthy. Small Fried Rice - For the most part this is a well prepared dish of fried rice. There's an additional taste to it which i have yet to put my finger on, but it brings a good uniqueness to this dish.

Sorely disappointed on my visit to Daikokuya. I was with a group of friends, a total of 4 of us and we waited over 90 minutes to get seated and saw others get seated before us. When we got to order, I went straight for the koterri tonkotsu ramen, the extra rich version of the pork bone ramen. What came to me was a ramen which had noodles that were nice and chewy but not entirely separated. I was not amused to see that some of the noodles had literally fused together to form clumps. Additionally, the koterri flavor did not seem to have an extra richness to the soup rather just extra fat on the surface. Perhaps I have been spoiled from the tonkotsu at Tonchin, but that is my measuring stick. (Tonchin is a ramen house in Ikebukuro, Tokyo, Japan)

So delicious. Yum yum yum! Broth - perfect Egg - delicious Pork - right amount of thickness and super tender The only thing I have a qualm about is the noodles.  I think it's too hard.   Oh, and I hate waiting for a long time to get seated.. but it's worth the wait.

BEST RAMEN YOU CAN GET IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA! Go ahead and tell me I'm wrong. But I will tell you the one and only thing I hate about this place: limited capacity. They don't take reservations, so wait times can reach up to well over an hour on Friday and Saturday nights. Sundays are brutal as well, since they're only open "until the soup runs out." Also, some people don't understand that because there is limited seating, Daikokuya is for sitting, eating, and leaving. Not sitting, eating, and talking. Go sit and talk somewhere else! Other people want to eat here too!

Ah, alright.  I'll let you all in on the secret.  But don't tell anyone!  (Even though this place had been reviewed over a THOUSAND TIMES here.  Wow.) This is the best hole in the wall noodle house in all of Los Angeles.  My first year in Los Angeles a good chunk of my friends were Japanese film students, and I was fortunate to discover this gem through them.  They practically lived here, and told me it's some of the best home style food they'd had in LA. I can see why. To the untrained eye, Daikokuya is a small, unassuming restaurant tucked into a row of identical looking storefront along a street in Little Tokyo.  However, all you have to do is look for the small gathering waiting out the door, and you know you're there.   And, yes, there WILL be a line...  So, make sure you get your name on the little clipboard list sitting on the chair just inside the door. The only thing to order here is the ramen.  That's all I've ever had and all I ever want.  For 8 dollars, you receive a gigantic bowl of steamy, delicious ramen goodness.  And no, poor college kids, this isn't like the plastic packages you have a mountain of in your cabinet.  This is a painstakingly all-day-boiled broth, deliciously meat, thick noodles, a handful of sprouts and onions, along with a rich boiled egg that has infused the broth.  Damn.  You WILL take some home with you.  I cannot express it enough - the portion size is ridiculous.   You know this place is hidden gem, because there is always a wait for a table.  Their dining room is small, and done up with a lot of 1950's-1960's post-war Japanese trinkets.  Make sure you check out the kickass vintage Japanese movie posters in the bathrooms.  One day I'm going to figure out how to smuggle one out in my pants. Maybe in my giant, styrofoam takeout bowl.   My one drawback is that the dining room is a bit small, which means there is a pretty long wait during peak dinner hours to get a table.  I would suggest this as a middle of the day/early dinner place to avoid the rush.  Also, as they say, if you can't stand the heat... get out of the kitchen.  It's an open air kitchen with a counter, so the temperature can get a little up there while they're making their magic in a bowl.   But, I don't care about any of that.  The food speaks for itself.  Either way, make your way here sometime while you're in Los Angeles. Delicious.

Ok...If you're a ramen fan then you'd know that it is hard to find a good ramen place in this town because it's not so well known like your pizza, ice cream, hamburger, etc shops, it's an asian thing (more Japanese, I guess). After saying that, this is one place that is actually good and although the place is tiny and always packed and you have to wait for 30 mins to an hr for a seat, it's worth it. Especially their original pork soup ramen and gyoza....yes! gyoza! you must try, it is good. You can also see the chefs are Japanese and they prepare and cook the broth in front of you so it's like they have nothing to hide. Also if you're going to try this place, the portions are huge so you should empty out your stomachs before coming here. We were thinking the wait would be long and so we got ourselves a smoothie before hand and that was a big mistake...could not finish our ramen afterwards.

I finally tried the kotteri broth and it was sooooooo good. So good that I'm never going to get it again! Why? Because I would like to live to write another yelp review. Real talk, the broth was rich but looking at the soup just makes you wonder what you're doing to yourself! It is a bit saltier than the regular broth though, so if you're eating with someone else, just do what I did and trade soup :D

Personally, I'm not obsessed with ramen, but the Daikoku Ramen served here has a very tasty soup and chewy noodles! The bowl was also fairly large for the price. I got the combo and prefer the shredded pork bowl much more. There was a generous serving of meat. Delicious! I also enjoyed the salad that came with the combo. The dressing is delicious. The service was quick once my party was seated and attentive. The wait is horribly long for larger tables, especially when I went during lunchtime and there is no to-go ordering. There are parking structures and street parking around the area. Also there is a nice little shopping center near that you can pass your time with during the wait.

Really? I dunno...I think because this place had high ratings from over 2,000 people I expected a lot from this place. I went on a subway adventure to Little Tokyo today and stopped by Matsuwaya, Fugetsu-Do, and Daikokuya. I arrived at Daikokuya around 2:30 pm on a Wednesday and didn't get seated til 3pm. I was prepared to wait after reading all the reviews... so I didn't mind the wait at all. We ordered Iced Oolong Tea, Gyoza, and 1 order of the Daikokuya Ramen Combo + Shredded Pork Bowl. FIrst of all, I don't know how people eat the the Combo by themselves... I shared the Ramen and we took the Pork Bowl Home. We spent around $21 dollars. And if you are spending $10 or less.. you can't use credit! So here is my review for the food: Iced Oolong Tea: nice on a hot day. amazing? nah. Gyoza: good... best i've ever had? nope. Shredded Pork Bowl: pretty good... but do I have urges to return and wait in a line for 30 minutes or more? not really. Daikokuya Ramen: I thought you were going to be amazing... but seriously... I think I like Santouka better. I think it lacked some flavor.. Maybe if i added the koterri flavor I would like it better. I mean.. I'm kind of amazed that I didn't like it because of all the good reviews...It makes me feel like there is something wrong with me. Maybe there is. Oh well, who knows... I suggest you try it for yourself. I don't regret going though... because I can say I've been and give my honest opinion.

This was the last stop on a 3 stop tour of Little Tokyo w/in the span of five hours. I got the ramen (w/ back fat MMMM--I love back fat) combo w/ tuna (eh it's not legit tuna) don bowl. It's like $12 bucks. AND you should probably split it amongst two people.

Daikokuya is delish!!!  This is a ramen place that is cramped & really very small & the wait can be kind of long but every time you get to taste the broth, oh my, it's just  heavenly!  It's the tastiest, comforting feeling!   I love to get  the ramen with 1/2 order  of the fried rice with bits of melts in the mouth cha siu pork -- so good compared to other fried rice in other ramen places.   The contrast & combination of the warm ramen & their cold refreshing coleslaw really goes well together!  Love it!   The place might be cramped but it actually gives you the authentic feel of ramen places in Tokyo, which adds to the pleasant food experience.   Prices are reasonable, portions are good & the broth with the char siu pork is something to line up for!

Solid 4 stars. FOOD: We had the ramen and a side of fried rice & chicken something rice. I thought the ramen and fried rice were really good. Portions are pretty big (two girls could probably share one ramen plus a side of fried rice easy). SERVICE/WAIT: Went on a Thursday around lunch time (12:30PM). We waited about 30-35 minutes. I also asked for a side of Japanese pickles on the side which they were super cool about. Service was good. INTERIOR: As you can see from previous reviews below, it's not a huge place, but perfectly adequate. I'd come back, and recommend to others. There are also TONS of other Japanese places I'd be willing to try too since this was my first in awhile.

My friend and I wanted a little day adventure so we headed to Little Tokyo and chose Daikokuya as our starting point.  I don't have Ramen often, and to be honest, I mostly get my Ramen from a package that costs me ten cents, but I do know good eats and  this fits the bill.  We started out with the Gyoza and it was the first time that I've had them that they didn't taste like the restaurant got it out of a bag from Trader Joes. They were fresh, delicious and got us ready for our GIANT BOWL O' RAMEN.   The broth was rich and flavorful and a great foundation for the noodles which were cooked perfectly al dente.   All the other ramen components were there and I especially enjoyed the metric shit-ton of green onions!  I washed it down with a Sapporo in a frozen mug.   The wait was a bit gnar gnar, but once we did get inside, the wait staff was very attentive.  Do yourself a favor, take a day to go down to Little Tokyo to explore.  There are some great shops, beautiful gardens, museums and great restaurants like Daikokuya.

Daikokuya is a purposefully divey place.   This being my first time there, I almost went somewhere else when I saw the winged insects inside the front window.  (Look for them below the xeroxed, Jonathan Gold review.) While waiting, the wartime music started to get on my nerves.  Thank god we got the last booth in the back after a half-hour wait.   I must agree with the hundreds of other Yelpers who like this place's ramen.  I think it's all about the porky broth.  Their fried rice was also good, but the tempura was so-so.  Major bonus: $2 draft Kirin!  Four stars because I'd go back for the ramen.  They would've gotten five but for those damned insects.

1st off let me say I'm a die hard Hakata Ramen fan...but as I now work in downtown I figure I give some other ramen places a shot. I've heard about Daikokuya for the longest time and I eagerly anticipated the ramen there. I've heard time and again that the ramen noodles had the perfect consistently and the broth creamy and rich. I must say I was a bit let down. My initial mistake was attempting to eat there during lunch. I believe we waited about 20 minutes, and 5 of those minutes we were waiting for the host/waiter to give us permission to sit in the empty counter seats. But good things come to those who wait so that was ok. I proceeded to order the ramen and fried rice combo and spicy tuna rolls. Both the fried rice and rolls came out promptly. The rice was large and satisfying, not the best I had but this isn't a fried rice place. As for the spicy tuna I was impressed with the quantity but the quality was a bit lacking. But again ramen place right not fried rice/sushi place, so thats ok. A little bit later I got the ramen. It was large and very pleasant looking to the eyes. The noodles were nice and chewy, but the soup base, awww the soup base...(the crux of all good ramen!!!!) was lacking in flavor and had way to many scallions. Creamy and flavorful are not words that came to my mind . Also the egg in my soup was cold....WTF was that. I don't know maybe I went on a bad day,maybe I shouldn't of gone with so many expectations, but I don't get the hype. Tasted like a average ramen place to me.

I am a Ramen fascist. I know this to be true because I have tasted weak inferior ramen before. I know this to be true because Daikokuya is by far the superior ramen in LA. What makes them the superior ramen? As always I judge ramen by it's broth. And at Daikokuya, they cook their broth in pork bones for a full day before serving. A full day!  Their broth is so creamy and rich that I always plan ahead not to do anything active after wards because I know it's going to be nap time. At Daikokuya you have the option of ordering your ramen with extra flavor. Do not ever order extra flavor. I found that I could not handle the extra goodness, and you can't add anything to perfection.

You're not going to find a better ramen house in the United States. Seriously. If you're a ramen fan and you're craving REAL Japanese ramen, then you need to visit this place. This is like being in Kumamoto eating the real deal good stuff...I don't know what else there is to say! The place is small, smelly, crowded, filled with dusty old Japanese trinkets, and located in the heart of J-town. You've got the Japanese business suits, the college kids eating late, and the typical hipster foodie who shows up, and if you're early enough in the evening a lot of local Japanese families and gaijin alike enjoying a good meal. Come hungry and leave stuffed... make sure to order the Ramen special with bacon fried rice. Not only is the ramen top notch, but the fried rice is great too!

I've been pretty lucky with my Daikokuya experiences. All the times I've gone I was able to find parking on the same street pretty close to Daikokuya AND there was little to no wait! I go around 1pmish on the weekdays. Their food is good. I usually get a combo (ramen and eel bowl) and share with mi madre. As a result we are stuffed and our taste buds more than satisfied. love this place! but one star for making us sit at the counter! i don't like sitting on stools with no where to put my over-sized purse. heh.

This place is good. But get ready for a sodium overload. The noodle soup is as salty as they come. My suggestion: get the version that brings all the ingredients separate and dip ye noodles in the soup for the degree of flavor you're looking for. Lots of green onions come on the gyoza. Never had them that way, but I liked it. The service is fast and friendly.  When coming-out of the restaurant there were just as many people outside waiting as there were inside the restaurant eating.   Give this place a try. Plenty of moderately priced parking in J-town.

This probably isn't going to make a dent in the 2000+ review pile, but let me just say that I had been coming to Little Tokyo for YEARS with the intent of trying Daikokuya, but to no avail (more like I was always too impatient/starving to want to wait in the perpetually long lines).  When I finally had the opportunity to try Daikokuya's famous ramen, I realized that I had not lived before the moment that buttery-rich broth touched my lips.  Is that an exaggeration? Okay, maybe just a little, but ohhhhh my goodness that broth! Creamy and rich but not ladened with oils, comforting and bursting with robust pork bone flavor-- slurping up a bowl makes me feel like I'm at my [imaginary] Japanese grandmother's home.   Anyway, my point is that no matter how hungry you are, just WAIT!  I regret not having eaten at Daikokuya sooner.  Tell those hungry, gnawing pains in your stomach to shush, go jot your name down on the waiting list, and then run across the street to Mitsuru Cafe to get a few snacks to hold you over (red bean cakes and shu mai = yum!).  The wait is worth it. Tip: Their bowls are HUGE, but you also request for a smaller size bowl (which, for me, is still impossible to finish!)

Best Ramen EVER. Nevermind the B rating.. The food and health people are just HATERS! I was so stoked when I dove face first into my first authentic Little Tokyo bowl of Hot Ramen here at Daikokuya, I was literally in my own personal heaven. But you know the ramen is good, you've read the reviews, you know what's up. What you may not know is that all the other food is good here too! I had the fried rice and ramen combo and I literally had to push the rice onto the other side of the table because I did not want to fill up bedore I finished my ramen.  If you are down to get dirty like me you can throw that fried rice in the ramen bowl and you have the best of both worlds. In fact, you can throw anything in that ramen bowl and it would taste good. Ask for some siracha to make that sucker spicey! OH! And park in the CVS parking lot accross the street and get FREE PARKING!  Just make sure you are in and out in an hour or they will tow your ass.  GO!

Ye ole ramen god that you are.  Where do you say I should go?  I am sooo sorry but I can't hear you.  I do apologize.  Whoa, heard you that time...so it's called Daikokuya or something like that.  I have to wait outside in line?  How long?  The guy will tell me half an hour and it will really be 45min???  That doesn't seem enticing at all!  what?  Oh, okay...gotcha "I won't regret it". Well it turns out he was right, I didn't.  Lucky for me they have a small TV inside that was showing the Simpson's while I was waiting.  It was the episode where bart find out that they are imprisoning the children to eventually eat!! Helped the time go by for sure.  So I ordered the Ramen because honestly can you come here and order anything else?  It was well....really good.  I have to admit, I was impressed.  Very filling and 180 some odd yelp reviewers can't be wrong!  They have never let me down yet!! Pork broth, soft but kinda hard noodles that taste so nice.  The funny thing is they know they have a good thing.  Otherwise, why would they put up a sign that says: "Why are our noodles so good?".  Well apparently it has something to do with soaking things for a really long time!  Oh, almost forgot...tap Kirin...amazingly cheap as well. Anyway, don't even think about coming here with more than 4 people as you will never eat.  Order the ramen and enjoy!  This place would have gotten 5 stars from me but...I hate waiting so long.

This place is very popular and I've only once not been thrilled with the food, but I have to give it a low review to highlight something: there is a LOT of fat going on with this food. I had the chicken teriyaki bowl today and it was chicken fat fried in fat and then buttered over with fat. Even the chicken fried rice comes with a coating of fat. You can order your ramen with extra fat added to the broth. Many people are not going to care but if you're someone who does care, fair warning, this is more fat than you're looking for, unless you're Kate Moss and you've decided to add some pounds. That being said the eel is fantastic. The chicken fried rice is also great. The chicken teriyaki is good but way too fatty for my taste. The eel is fatty too but it works better for some reason. The ramen is legendary, although I've never had a full bowl of it because it has too many things I don't eat. I got one thing I didn't like here, it was whatever the thing is under the eel bowl on the menu, that thing, whatever it was, I can't recommend. I work a few blocks from this place and we periodically get early lunch there, early because it's the only way we can get a seat. The place does great business, is hugely popular, and would get at least four stars from me if I hadn't figured out today how heinously fatty the food is.

Every time I even get close to Downtown, Daikokuya dances on my brain. I don't even know why there are other ramen places in the area. Probably only to handle the spillover or latecomers from Daikokuya. Get the special. It's the special for a reason. And, if you're extra hungry, or just feel like being a glutton (like I always seem to be in the mood for) order some gyoza. Perfect balance of crispy caramelization, green onion, and filling. But, the ramen is why you go. Buttery cutlet, soft boiled egg, beautiful springy noodles. I'm hungry now! Not a fan of the new yellow awning though. Expect to wait a bit at peak hours. But wait! You won't regret it, and your friends will think you're awesome!

We got really lucky when  we happened to get to Daikokya right when they opened at 1130a...yep, ramen for breakfast and it was mouthwatering! This is true ramen folks; the chefs start cooking in the early morning and it's all about the pork. You can guarantee you'll be waiting forever (unless you get lucky like hubbs and I did) if you get there any other time during the day but well worth the wait.

I find it hard to write a real review of Daikokuya because I dream of the rich pork based broth and ramen. It is amazing and has become a weekly ritual for me and friends. I cannot recommend it enough, but with the caveat that there is usually a long wait, and that you should get the house special ramen. Because if you aren't... why are you even here? I salivate thinking about it. I cannot recommend it more.

So my friend brought me here a long time ago before the peak days of Yelp and I loved it but forgot the name of it... I'm so glad I found it again! I finally made the trek out to LA and eat at this place again. I actually ate a bit at Wurstkuche earlier that night but after walking off a bit of the food I couldn't resist Daikokuya's ramen... Oh man, I'm glad I didn't stuff myself earlier that night cuz it was DELICIOUS! My boyfriend and I shared the Ramen and the small Tuna Sashimi bowl combo. AMBIANCE The restaurant itself isn't much to look at. It has posters of old Japanese posters and other Japanese memorabilia. Other than that, its a pretty small but efficient restaurant. There's the ramen bar and a few tables to seat parties up to 4. No frills, just the necessities. SERVICE We were greeted by the host, who has the best voice ever! He sounds like he's a Japanese game show host. Our server was nice and friendly. Even though it gets crazy busy there, the staff does a good job at keeping it all together. :) FOOD Oh man... I wish I lived in LA so I can eat at this place more often. The ramen is so good i'll eat it even though I'm full. The noodles are cooked al dente so its not all mushy and swollen by the time you get to it. The broth is delicious and not too salty, like most other ramen I've tried (Santouka or Shinsengumi). The broth didn't taste too greasy on my lips either so I didn't feel like I was drinking lard and the pork is tender. The sashimi was pretty good quality but even in a small bowl the pieces were a bit large. I had to split each piece but it was a bit stringy. I didn't have a problem with that but I think some people do. Anyway, the sushi rice was OK and the tuna was pretty good. Not really a place for sashimi but it wasn't too bad. I thought I'd give it a shot. I'd stick to the ramen if you're hungry enough to finish it. It's quite filling! Overall the ramen is the best I've had outside of Japan. PLUS, it's open late (til 1am). This definitely is a great place for late night grub!

I absolutely love this place. Most of the time I come, the only thing I order is the ramen. Sometimes the egg is great, sometimes a bit dry. I have tried the Kotteri version of the ramen, but it just wasn't for me. It's about as good as the the traditional ramen, but I still prefer traditional. The side dishes are more than I can handle along with the bowl of ramen, so I wouldn't say it's the greatest idea if you want to finish your bowl! The atmosphere is great, too. You would think having to wait for anywhere from 5-15 groups to get to you on the list would be a bother, but it's not! I enjoy standing outside with the crowd waiting for my turn to walk into that cozy little place. The service is great, and people there are very friendly. Ever since finding this place, I come about every week. Definitely my favorite restaurant thus far. Enjoy!

Favorite place to eat ramen in LA, hands down.  I know there are other places, but I always compare it to here.   Flavorful, hearty porky broth, delicious abundant chewy noodles, soy sauce egg, tons of spouts, tons of green onions, succulent pieces of pork, add some of their pungent garlic mash and you got perfection.  Get their fried rice too, really tasty and the best fried rice I've had in a ramen place.   Wait is ridiculous though - be patient...you will be rewarded.

Forget DayQuil; if you have a cold, you need a nice, steaming bowl of RAMEN! I'd heard about this place for a while, but finally had the time and a reason to venture downtown for lunch when my friend came to visit. And thank god he did because this was one of the best meals I have had in ages! I haven't had ramen this good since I stumbled into one of those standing-room only ramen-ya joints in Kyoto a few years back. My friend and I both ordered the ramen + donburi combo and for $12 we received enough food to kill a baby horse, which in this metaphor is a good thing. I'm usually a proud member of the clean plate club, but between the starting salad, the unagi-don, and the INCREDIBLE ramen with its rich broth and tasty chatsu pork, I had to tap out. Be prepared to wait if you come at peak hours. I was there around noon on a Monday and only waited 20 minutes, but I've heard (delicious) horror stories from other folks. Parking can be kind of hit-or-miss, but I found a spot right out front which was just gravy. In short, don't hesitate, people -- get on this tip!

Freakin' unbelievable! Must go! Get the Combinations on the back pageonly $11!       - Salad, HUGE bowl of Ramen with egg+pork+scallion, & a shredded pork bowl. Also got a spicy tuna roll for an Appetizer which was above par. Next time I'm gonna try the Gyoza. Sit at the counter if you can, ite very entertaining, The wait is very long...put your name on the list and walk around little Tokyo for an hour.

The BEST ramen in LA!!!  I've been coming to Daikokuya since I moved to LA almost 9 years ago and after trying other ramen noodle houses in the area, I haven't found one that's even close to Daikokuya!  The broth is amazing!  It's something that I end up craving if I don't have it at least once a month.   The one bad thing is the wait.  It's such a small place with very limited seats.  But, my friends and I put our names down and drink at the bar next door!

DAIKOKUYA is just as good as everyone says it is.   This past Sunday, my friend and me went down there to try out the Ramen that's supposed to be so great. Anyway, we get there at about 3pm and there's people waiting, of course. Since this is our first time, we discovered that you write your name on a sign up sheet that's just inside the door (on a chair) and remember your number, since they don't take reservations and it's first come first serve. They called out #12 and we were #31, LOL. So we waited for about 40-45-minutes. It's great to people watch and stuff, so my advice is to have a snack before you go there! If you're really starving, there's a small market down the street to buy some snacks/drinks until you can get into the restaurant. We finally get called and we sit at the counter, felt like we won the lottery! I order the "Daikoku Ramen", we split the Gyoza, and my friend gets the bento with tempura and chicken teriyaki (he's not a soup fan). The gyoza was a little odd shaped, looking sort of flat, but they tasted fantastic! Topped with a lot of green onions, the gyoza was delicious and the dipping sauce was mixed perfectly. Then the Ramen came. Moment of truth...It has a caramel color, as you can see in the pix that other yelpers posted, and I thought it was going to be thick and creamy. It isn't. It's light and has just the right amount of seasonings. I loved it! There's all kinds of stuff in it like bamboo shoots (I would've liked more), green onions, bean sprouts, Ramen noodles (that are just the right consistency), one egg and the cha-shu (pork). The egg was amazing and I really don't like eggs. This egg was hard boiled enough so that the whites and most of the yolk were firm, but in the center the yolk was still moist. And when I bit into the egg, it also had a well seasoned taste. I'm not sure what they soak the egg in but it's fantastic! On to the pork. It melted in my mouth. No chewy meat here. Then bento was pretty good to. The chicken teriyaki was deep fried with crispy skin and had the teriyaki sauce on it. Delicious. Anyway, if you don't mind waiting around you should definitely check out Daikokuya, especially if you love Ramen. Maybe in the summer time it won't be so crowded. Just make sure you bring a snack! I'll definitely go back. BTW, since the place is small I would advise not going with a group larger than five people, because you might not be able to get seated together or as soon as seats become available.

From my experience, yelp has gotten it alllllll wrong this time (which isn't usually the case). Waited soooo long for a table for two.  My friend and I went back to Little Tokyo, went in to 2 different restaurants (we were too hungry to wait for the crowd over at Daikokuya, but the wait was almost as long in other Little Tokyo restaurants), shopped around at Nijiya and bought some groceries, walked all the way to Daikokuya again and still had to wait!!! Crazy waiting time, out in the summer night chills.  No waiting chairs, just lots of people hanging out outside. If the ramen was as amazing as what other yelpers have proclaimed, this wouldn't have been a 2 stars.  I've had at least 5 other better ramens! Santouka being my favorite. Much, much better.  And I must mention how much I love eating ramens. Disappointed at how it has such a fantastic rating and long waiting time but the ramen itself doesn't deliver :(.  Plus the fact that we were so hungry made waiting worse. Not worth the wait is all I can say.   That being said, the staff was friendly and patient to handle such a large crowd.

Best, find, ever! Facing some serious ramen withdrawals after coming back from a 4-month stint in Japan, I was so excited to find this place, and even more ecstatic to learn for myself that it lives up to the hype. Hands down the best ramen I've had in the US, and the closest thing to the real deal I've ever found outside the Land of the Rising Sun. Their tonkatsu ramen reminds me of what was one of my favorite ramen shops back in Kitakyushu. Expect a LONG wait to get in. Seriously. Go down to Little Tokyo about an hour before you even expect to be hungry and put your group's name down. Then go enjoy walking around Little Tokyo for a while and see a unique part of LA. You might even find some live karaoke going on outside that you can jump in on before heading back to the line. We had a group of 4 and ended up waiting for about 2 hours...IT WAS WORTH IT.

Best ramen so far I ever had. Broth is super yumm, not too salty, has mixture of sweet. I order extra green onions because it really spices the soup well and healthy too! Egg is amazing, it's like not too hard boiled and yet soft. Pork meat is fatty yummy, very moist and tender to the point you don't have to chew too long and is flavored real well. Other things to eat, the rice bowls with pork or eel...typically insane good but don't order too much since you should save room for the ramen and this dish...spicy tuna tempura wrapped in shiso leaves. Dip with salt and pepper on that, and is just great, very refreshing and not bland for a fried food seriously!

Mmmm. Great great ramen. My brother asked me what I craved in LA. After much a thought, I stated, "ramen!!", and off we went. Last time I was in LA, I headed to Shinsegumi. It was pretty dang good, but my brother claimed that Daikokuya was better. Off we drove to Little Tokyo. We arrived around 2:30pm, with a 30 minute wait. Not too bad. The restaurant is rather small, but I was surprised at how packed it was.  After reading the reviews, I ordered the combo meal- daikokuya ramen and a the pork belly bowl. My brother got the daikokuya ramen as well. We ordered it with the kotteri broth as well- the broth being drawn from extra back fat. Mmm. That broth was way too good. The pork from the pork bones was actually pretty good as well- it was plentiful and not too fatty. The pork belly was also very good, being cooked almost like cha siu. Mmm. I was stuffed not even halfway through my meal. Mmmmmm. Way way good. The noodles, I have to admit, are better at Shinsegumi, but the overall ramen bowl as well as the cost effective benefits of it, made my day. Nom nom nom. I highly recommend. :)

Daikokuya is really, really amazing.  Their broth is sooo tasty and the pork and noodles are super tender.  We went on a Friday for lunch and had to wait about 20 mins, but it was worth every minute. They don't do heat like Orochan down the street does, but Daikokuya makes up for up with impeccable ingredients.

I don't know if I like Orenchi in Santa Clara better or Daikokuya in L.A. But I do know one thing, both are so frikken good and they both let you add as much garlic as you want. The wait is crazy, it took an hour for us to get in. I would say take a stroll around Little Tokyo if the list looks long but don't wander for too long because they may skip you. Or if you don't feel like walking take a seat inside (if there's space) and read some Manga on the shelf like One Piece or Naruto. Like most ramen shops Daikokuya is extremely small, but its the small shops that give me the authentic ramen feeling. I ordered the special Daikokuya ramen since their was only a limited amount of choices and I didn't want to dip my noodles in the soup. You can also choose from a variety of side dishes to go with it like tempura over rice or tuna over rice (nice big slices too). The Daikokuya ramen was really big and so worth the price at $8.99. The broth did not look oily at all and the ramen was extremely hot just the way I like it. The taste of the broth was excellent, with it's blending of flavors in the pork to the sesame flavor to the green onions. The meat was literally melt in your mouth type of meat, so good.  The egg was just right taste wise but I kind of wished it was more soft boiled like Orenchi but it was still good. The noodles had a perfect consistency. It was all so good that I wanted to finish the broth but I was too full .

One of the better ramen places out there.  I was brought here by my friend Jill because she said it was the best ramen place..period.  After trying it out, and I was definitely impressed...but I still stand by my favorite (Hakata in Gardena) simply because you can specify the broth to how you want it, along w/ the noodles.   Service is okay...but the wait can get pretty hefty - and being that they don't take reservations...you're in for it esp around the rush times.  As with all popular places though, either go before the rush or just after.   This place still gets an A in my book though.

All the other reviews about this place were very helpful so I am just going to reiterate a few points: - Always a line, has to be good - Specialize in one type of soup base, has to be good - Soak hard boiled eggs overnight in their marinate, has to be good - Nice shops around the corner to visit while you wait - Service is great - Intimate setting If you're not a native of socal, check this place out for a legit bowl of ramen. By the way, the portions are filling. I got the combination of the Daikoko Ramen and Eel Bowl. I ended up taking part of the eel bowl home because it was so much food. Go!

I will truly miss this place when I move away from Los Angeles!! As a warning so you don't think it is ridiculous: 1. It's at least an hour wait (there's plenty of shops around go walk around) 2. Don't expect a fancy smancy environment 3. Parking sucks Food: Amazing broth mixed with chewy ramen noodles cooked right in front of you! The pork melts in your mouth! They don't offer a huge variety of ramen it's very cut to the chase. I recommend the combo with fried rice.  If it's a hot day order soup and noodle separately. Service: I guess I'd consider this a hole in the wall Ramen restaurant. For a hole in the wall it's great service =). Environment: I love this type of environment. Great eat while you're drunk place. Definitely not a 1st date restaurant....maybe a 5th date one. This place make me feel like I'm in the 1980s. Seating is very limited. Price: The price is fair compared to other Ramen restaurants. Considering the ramen is the best I've ever had they can raise the dang prices 30% and I'd still come! Maybe that'd shorten the wait! Food: 5 (The best) Service: 4 Environment: 5 Price: 5

I came here last night after the yelp Halloween event.  It was about midnight and there was a short wait.   I ordered the ramen san pork belly but it still had the whole egg.  I was warned to order the half order and I am glad I did because the standard order is enough to feed 3 people.  It was very good and reasonable too and they didn't charge me the full price since I did not have meat in mine.  The prices are very good too! Located in Little Tokyo.

Ohhh this place is delicious. After a meeting we all went here to grab our late night dinner and oh myy, was I happy I didn't eat yet. They can't sit huge groups (we had 10) so we had to split up. And the wait wasn't so bad, but I was there on a weeknight. So I ordered the daikokuya ramen with the small rice/pork cutlet while everyone else ordered variations of the daikokuy ramen combo. Having eaten at Orochon, I kind of expected the same thing BUT I WAS WRONG. Because this places was like x10 more delicious. The food came out fast and the broth was so full of steamy ramen goodness. My combo came out to be around $12-15 which was nice because I took home another meal and those ramen bowls are freaking huge...like crater huge. Which makes this stomach happy to no end. The place is small but the food is waay huge. Nice balance, no? You should definitely go here when in LA, check it out--you just might fall in love.

Once upon a time there was a girl name Goldilocks. She's not a really picky eater but she is very particular about her eggs. She doesn't like them hard-boiled because the yolk is too dry. She doesn't like them over-easy because the yolk is too runny. One day, she went for a walk around Little Tokyo and  she came upon a house with a sign that says "Daikokuya."  She entered and ordered a bowl of ramen that came with the most perfect egg she has ever eaten. The soft boiled egg was tender and full of flavor. Goldilocks left the Daikokuya satisfied and full. She lived happily ever after. The End!

You know how there is that one place you used to go to with your ex, and it was super yummy, but you are always worried about running into your ex and having an awkward "oh hey" moment? Yea this is that place for me, but even the threat of the awkward "oh yeah how you been lately" conversation is not enough to deter me from eating here. NOTHING WILL DETER ME FROM EATING HERE! NOTHING! Not even a 60+ mile drive from the IE! Parking is hard to find - it is either street or Tokyo Village garage parking. There are a couple of other ramen places on the same side of the street, and the massive crowd of people waiting outside it's fluttering yellow draped door to get a booth or a seat at the counter can be off putting. BUT DON'T LET THESE THINGS STOP YOU! This is easily the best ramen in LA. They are so dedicated to quailty that they stop serving when the soup runs out, they won't dilute their broth. They've also stopped accepting take-away orders over the phone (they will however totally oblige you if you grab a seat and order food to go, as I have done it several times). The broth is flavorful, the hardboiled egg never over cooked (I HATE eggs, and I always devour my hardboiled egg), everything is always perfect. The only complaint I have is that over the last five years, the amount of pork they put into the soup has definitely decreased. I highly recommend the ramen of course and make sure you check out the shredded pork bowls and eel bowls. All delicious. What is even better is that it is a great price, not expensive at all. If you plan on coming with a group larger than 6, don't expect to sit at the same table. If you are in a rush and there are only 2 or 3 of you, just ask for a chairs at the counter, you'll get seated faster. I've driven an hour from Riverside just to have dinner here, I love it so much!

One very hot day, my friends and I decided to go on a spontaneous adventure to Little Tokyo. Upon arriving after getting lost walking around looking for a hint of ANYTHING Japanese, we attempted to get seats at the infamous Daikokuya on a slow weekday afternoon. The place was PACKED, and we had to wait in line to be seated in that very tiny, almost old restaurant. We walked around to look at our other selections, but about 10 minutes later, we came back and were seated. My friends ordered their ramen for about $9/bowl, and they slurped away at it as if they've been starving for days! I suppose maybe they do live up to their reputation of having notable ramen, but I will definitely give it a try next time I'm around. I ordered a plate of sushi that day  which turned out to be average at best. I wouldn't recommend it, but this place is more known for their ramen anyway. I should've known better. From the moment we sat down to the fetching of the bill, the process took only about 30 minutes. The staff was very prompt about getting our orders and serving our food, but perhaps it was because there was still a line outside waiting to be seated.

I came back here after gorging myself on cupcakes and even though I was full I felt like coming in anyway, remembering the creamy, pork flavor of the ramen. The pork cutlet didn't disappoint but the broth wasn't as rich as I remember. The garnish wasn't so plentiful nor crunchy. The fried rice was still good-but they seem to keep skimping on the garnish. The little red peppers that added the little spice were noticeably less than before. My visits to LA are few and far between enough that I'll come back and visit again but my expectations will be that much lower. *Sigh*

There's ramen and then there's ramen at Daikokuya.  The ramen at Daikokuya sets the bar for all other ramen, and it's a definite MUST-ORDER. Daikoku Ramen (*$8.50): -  Broth:  Unparalleled.  There's all kinds of broth out there:  miso-based, soy sauce-based, veggie broth, beef / pork / chicken broth... But the broth here is supreme.  The Daikokuya broth is exceptional and in a league all its own.  It's hearty, rich and robust yet subtle enough to complement the noodles, melt-in-your-mouth pork belly chasu, large egg, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts and a generous sprinkle of green onions. - Marinated Large Egg:  Boiled and cooked to perfection, the egg is not your normal large-sized egg.  It's huge!  The yolk is golden yellow on the inside without a hint of being overdone.  I'm not sure what kind of egg it is, but it reminds me off a Chinese tea egg marinated in juices.  YUM. -  Pork Belly:  Superb.  It melts in your mouth (probably because there is a TON of fat surrounding the slice of meat).   - Kotteri Flavor:  This is for the tonkatsu fans out there who aren't shy about getting extra fat in their soup.  Just do it if you're 'going to try the ramen.  You won't regret it. We also go the shredded pork rice bowl.  It's huge, and we packed it to go.  You can order it as a combo to the ramen for ~$11. The wait was long, but not bad if you walk around the shops nearby.  You can easily entertain yourself, and it's totally worth the wait.  I've never had ramen in Cali this good.  Deifnitely try it!

This place is the best ramen I've had since my Japan trip a couple years ago. Amazing soup. I can't emphasize that enough. Of course with soup noodles, the soup is KEY. Also, their cha-su is top notch too. Be prepared for a bit if a wait maybe 30+ mins. Definitely worth it. The wait made me so hungry so I ordered egg over rice in addition to my ramen. It was amazing too! Wow can't recommend this place enough. However the most important tip I can give you, is that u should only come with one other foodie. A bigger group than this and it may not be very comfortable and the wait will be too long.

I'm not really a Ramen type of person but after reading so many reviews from Fellow yelper, this restaurant was always on my to try list.  I was in Little Tokyo Recently.  We arrived pretty early and the restaurant I wanted to try didn't open till 5:30 pm.  (Many restaurants in Little Tokyo doesn't open till 5:30 pm). We were pretty hungry so I randomly asked one of the gals there where Daikokuya and off we went.   This restaurant is easy to miss as I walked up and down 1st street.  Since the gal pointed across the street, I decided to cross the street.  We finally found this tiny little restaurant amid the many restaurants on this side of the street. Like Hakata Ramen in Rosemead, this restaurant is small, old,  and dingy looking.  (B-rating) Were it not for the reputation, I would not step foot here. Old can be good since it usually means an establishment has done well. I wonder why they don't invest some money to make it better. Besides the point, we arrived at a good time since there were very few diners and there was minimal wait time.  This was around 5 pm on a Wednesday. Since this was our first time, we weren't sure what to order. Unlike Hakata Ramen in Rosemead, it was very easy.  Everything is already in there.  One type of noodle.  Scallions, bamboo, one whole egg, bean sprout, etc.  We end up ordering 1 Ramen Bowl with Shredded Pork w/ Rice and 1 Ramen Bowl with Teriyaki Chicken. The bowl is huge.  I could not finish it. I recommend sharing it with someone. I love the cabbage salad that comes with the combo. The shredded pork melts in your mouth and it was very good.  My sisters love the ramen here.  Although the broth was rich, I found the broth at Hakata tastier.  After adding garlic, ginger, and the red chilli, it taste better.  The pork was so tender, it melts in your mouth.

Daikokuya is A-ok.  It is tasty, but not the best ramen.  I love spicy food and to eat ramen not spicy was a bit difficult.  I ate my ramen with ginger and sriracha. The ramen also goes lukewarm pretty quickly.  I was just texting for like a minute and it was already a bit lukewarm.  I also cannot eat food that is lukewarm. I need it to be either really hot or just cold. I ordered the usual: Daikokuya Ramen.  The portions are actually pretty big and filling.  The soup base is a bit salty so either ask them to add a bit of hot water in it or make it less salty.  The food comes out pretty quickly so if you are really hungry, you won't have to wait long for your food.  The place is very small! I think they can fit about 30 people inside so be prepared to wait in a line if you go at a busy hour.  I went around 4pm and I still had to wait about 5-10 minutes.  Parking SUCKS! There is only street parking and structure parking.  The parking structures vary from $4-$7.

I'll never let you go baby. By baby, I mean their RAMEN... t.o.p. notch ingredients Don't stray away from adding that pork belly fatty goodness either because the flavor is unbelievable. I've been here twice and if I could I'd go here WAY more often. Parking is kind of difficult but once you find it run your butt over in line (because hell, there's going to be a line). Definitely can share your ramen + rice bowl with your lover/friend/toyfriend/mama/papa cause it'll sure fill you up. Service was crappy both times but hey it was busy as hell and authentic Asian restaurants usually don't have good service anyway. I ordered the Daikoku ramen both times alongside the small chicken teriyaki bowl. I don't think I've had anything that compares... mostly because SD doesn't have much to offer of this kind of cuisine and partially because I can't believe it actually gets better. To infinite taste bud bliss and beyond ---

Okay, I get it Daikokuya. You keep the place small so you can keep the quality high and blah blah blah. That's great and all, but ahhhhh, that 45 minute wait that turns into 1+ hours can get REALLY irritating sometimes, especially when all you want is to dive into a hot bowl of delicious ramen! Alright, wait time aside (-1 star) I have nothing else bad to say about this place! Downright delicious ramen, with a really rich pork broth and good amounts of bean sprouts and pork in the bowl. I guess it's kind of a bummer you don't get to decide how you want the ramen yourself like other places, there's just firm noodles and pork broth. But hey, why mess with a perfect combination! Just order and be happy. Also recommended: fried rice. Something about Japanese fried rice that I can get enough of! Customer service is excellent, friendly and efficient, and the hot tea is also free. What more could you ask for (besides a shorter wait time)! Oh and I'm sure everyone knows this, but here's a tip: they have half-size orders for less than $6! It's a decent size, probably more than half of the regular size bowl, and more than enough to fill me up. Took me like 5 times of ordering the regular size bowl before I actually read the menu and saw this. Hope it helps!

Best ramen in LA, HANDS DOWN! I don't care that it's tiny and cramped, I don't care that I've waited up to two hours for a table, I don't care if the floor is a little lopsided and I almost fell on my way to the bathroom; it's all worth it for that one delicious bowl of ramen. The broth is so savory, the noodles are cooked to perfection, and the pork is so yummy! I could eat here for the rest of my life. AAAAND, free refills for your drinks!!

By far the best ramen I have ever eaten so far... You can just taste the freshness of the noodles compared to the noodles you in your cup and other ramen places. The portion is huge and I got a teriyaki bowl with rice on the side for a couple more bucks extra. The ramen bowl composed of ramen, chatsu, an egg, bean sprouts and green onions all for one price @ $8.95. It was about a 20 min wait, but well worth it! Very cheap and good!!! I would recommend this place to any noodle lover!

Though somewhat inconsistent, very good Kotteri (fatty)-style Ramen.  Unlike Santouka, these guys actually make their own broth.  (Santouka, on the other hand, ships in their pre-made broth from Japan and all they do is add hot water in the back. )  So that's the reason for their inconsistency, but still, pretty good most of the time. I like the thick noodles, the Chashu (simmered pork), excellently complement the thick soup.   On some days, I will ask for the extra-Kotteri (extra fat) to go onto the soup, which makes an much powerful experience.  But then my weight bounce up when I get home and go on the scale, so I resist the temptation, usually.  But I would recommend it trying it once! If you have a bunch of people, then try the Gyoza and the Fried Rice.  Both pretty good.  The fried rice is soggy and oily, but the taste is there.  I wouldn't compare it to a Chinese restaurant's fried rice, but it does go well with the Ramen.

A line out the door is almost always a good sign that the experience within is worth queuing up for. Daikokuya does not offer takeout for one simple reason--their kitchen isn't big enough. And that one need venture to Little Tokyo, put one's name in and wait for one's number to be summoned builds up the anticipation of the fat ramen noodles and slabs of pork belly swimming in their warm, comforting broth. Wait time isn't horrendous, but a 20-30 minute wait is not unheard of. If you don't want to wait, there's a ramen bar a block over that serves a product that's just as good with a bigger menu, and I don't ever recall having to wait for a table. However, I do not recall the name of this place and while their food is just as good, the experience is definitely not as memorable. Once inside, it's clear that it's all about the ramen. Their dowdy interior space is peppered with cool vintage, would-anyone-notice-if-I-stole-this-metal-poster Japanese kitsch, and most of their cracked vinyl booths and well-worn formica tables slant a little this way or that. It's a comfortable place that serves comfort food. Service is efficient and the staff are friendly, but the operation is spartan. But if they hired an interior designer, or hired more servers, or expanded the space, or allowed for reservations, or offered takeout--it wouldn't be Daikokuya, and it would definitely not be as good.

So there's not much that can be said about Daikokuya that hasn't been said already, but screw it, I am the greatest human being on earth and my voice needs to be heard. Now I don't want to be one of those dicks who pulls out the "I used to live in Japan so I know what I'm talking about" card, but guess who used to live in Japan?  Uh huh, that's right, Noah D.  And this man loved his ramen.   Still, I'm not claiming to be the ramen guru. In fact, the main thing that I learned about ramen over there is that like everything else there's high quality and low quality and after that it's just a matter of personal taste.  My tasty buds say that Daikokuya is great ramen. First off, tonkatsu (pork based) ramen is my favorite kind and I think that's the way it will play for most westerners.  The richness of the broth just does me good.  That's the kind of ramen that Daikokuya serves and they do it well.  In addition, I would say that their broth is actually pretty unique among tonkatsu and while I generally like a bit more spice in my soup, I'm not gonna question their recipe because it makes me so damn happy every time I taste it. Now, there are always gonna be some haters who are gonna say that the place is overhyped and not that good, but the truth is, that soup is top notch and maybe it just doesn't hit their bellies the way it hits mine, but to call it bad or bland is just revealing the hate in your heart and revealing that you need a care bear hug. But yes, the wait is just stupid.  I mean it's really stupid.  Ramen is supposed to be quick, easy to get food, and waiting for 45 minutes for it sucks(-1 star).  So just know that there is gonna be a wait and don't go if you need to eat right away. Last thing I've got to say is that I just took my friend from out of town here and it was hot and the wait was long and I was thinking, god I'm a jackass for picking this place, no matter how good the soup is, there's no way she's gonna enjoy it at this point, but no,  for the rest of the weekend she was telling everyone she talked to about the best ramen place she's ever been to.  So go to Daikokuya, bring your friends and impress them.  Everyone will love you and your life will be great like mine.

god bless small businesses. unfortunately daikokuya is the very example of what can go wrong when a small business begins to succeed. very long waits, very crowded atmosphere and only a "B" rating? mind you, what they lack in atmosphere and space they make up in food and service. the ramen broth is very tasty (although the "b" rating does make you wonder if you should be enjoying the broth that much) and the service is quick and polite. the best way to go is to order a combination. that is, ramen and rice bowl with your choice of meat (chicken, porkcutets, beef, ect). it's a lot of food but at such great price you can't go wrong. due to their location their overhead is small and hence the prices quite south of reasonable. only problem? the wait. long wait. if you're a great fan of ramen, you'll bear it but if you're averse to crowds, hipsters and generally obnoxious young adults, you'll want to go when their wait times are friendlier. but who knows when that is.

Ate it 4 years ago. Still drooling about that tasty bowl of goodness hitherto. So far, its the best Ramen in U.S. Granted my Ramen experience has been limited to U.S areas (Ippudo, Totto Ramen, Samurai Noodle) and Ajisen Ramens here and there, but I would think these various establishments I've been to would give a little credibility to back my opinion. =) The broth was silky and creamy. The flavor was rich. The noodle was perfect as it carries the broth well with every slurp, and have a bit of a texture with every bite. And the chasiu meat was tender and aromatic, which elevated the whole Ramen experience. Topped it with a generous servings of chopped scallions (a little too much, but could always be scooped aside). Damn! That's a heavenly pool of golden offering I've been longing to deluge myself into ever since my last visit in what feels like millennia ago. I've been meaning to go back to LA just to get another slurp of this. O times have been cruel! My friend was a local who knew too well of the long lines, so we came here right as it was just opening and we still had to wait at least 15 mins. So when coming here, make sure to plan well. On my list of must-be-backs!

Well wow. I heard this place was good so i decided to check it out with my buddy. When we got there, there was already a wait and so it took about 15 mins to finally get a seat. It's a small Japanese restaurant that i guess seems pretty popular with the yelpers. While waiting outside you can lean on the window watching people eat their ramen bowls....yum. Or you can watch the termites in the in the window eat up the wood. Your choice. I'm glad i was with just one other person because we got in front of a couple big groups. So we ate at the bar, Not very much room, but it was enough to enjoy a meal and a drink. Since it was my first time i had to go with the original ramen bowl. Came with noodles, bamboo shoots, pork and an egg. I thought it was excellent and i ate that bowl pretty quickly. What i really liked about the ramen was that the broth was at the exact perfect temperature. It wasn't scolding hot, it was a nice hot soup that didn't burn on the way down. I also got a small kirin for like $2.50 to wash it down. Service was quick and excellent. The cooks and servers are very nice and so i thanked them with much much thanks in Japanese. I left a nice tip and we were out of there quick. It was a quick eat and go because it was so busy and i didn't want to take up seats.

At long last, I've finally been to Daikokuya!  I call it dkky for short since most Japanese names have simple syllables, I like to abbr whenever possible and omitting most vowels in japanese is just fun. My friend Michelle has been talking about dkky for a year since we tout the places like Kahoo and Santa up here.  I completely trust he as a foodie in that 1) she's japanese; 2) she eats at a lot of places; 3) all of her recommendations have been spectacular. we finally went to dkky in July and it did not disappoint.  We had ramen, gyoza, and fried rice.  The place is actually pretty small and a bit dark.  Not as crowded as Santa but it actually has a nicer ambience than all of the ramen places I've been to in Norcal.  The gyoza was fantastic and the fried rice was good.  And the ramen.  Oh sweet baby jesus the ramen.  Rich broth, noodle with just the right springiness and firmness.  The collagen in the broth just stuck to the noodles which made each delicious slurp better than the last. I was deliberating giving it a 4 or 5, but I had to go with 5 since it's just about the best ramen place I've been to, though I've been told by my friend that there are a few ones that are better.  Until then, dkky gets a 5.

Most flavorful ramen broth I have ever had.  Gotta get the kotteri flavor if you're a fan for extremely flavorful soup.. it's like extra strength fatty goodness.  I like to throw in some of the smashed garlic that they have on the tables.  You must be REALLY hungry if you choose to eat their combos... it's a great deal, but difficult to down in one sitting. I don't know what's a good time to come here... I always end up waiting 30-45 min. whether it's 1pm, 4pm, or an hour before close.  I suppose the best time might be to come right before they open at 11; will have to try that sometime. Lesser known fact: you can buy their salad dressing to go.  I got a squirt bottle for $6 and it's been good on cabbage and lettuce salads.

I think the other 580+ reviews have this covered, but damn, this place is good! The only thing that prevented me from giving them a 5-star rating was the fact that the "waiting area" up front was hella small, even for small Asians. While in LA, I decided to jump on Yelp on my iPhone to check out ramen joints because I was craving really bad, and this place was the king of the mountain. Parking in the area sucks, and after paying $8 to park across the street in the little lot, I found at that I could've parked free in the "mall" parking garage. Anyways, the place was packed. Comparing it to the almost-cliche sardines metaphor wouldn't suffice for how damned congested this place was. I think we waited about 30 minutes give or take for a table, which isn't too bad compared to other waits I've been through, but I couldn't stand some of the people that were waiting outside with us. There was a chain smoker that was smoking what I could've sworn was elephant dung by the aroma it gave off, and then there were the uber-hip, too cool for J-pop kids that were comparing cell phone charms and taking hella pictures of themselves flashing the peace sign. I was actually thinking of going to Mr. Ramen a couple stores away, but then Yelp came to the rescue! (Thanks to my new friend, Savvy G. Kudos to you!) I am so glad I waited because the ramen I had was damned near perfection. I got the ramen with the "thicker, tonkatsu-style" broth, I really can't remember what they called it. I also go a little cha-shu mini bowl. I was in porky heaven. I would've preferred the egg to be cut in half and a little less done, but hey, when you're craving, and it's hitting the spot, you really don't have the right to complain. I think the only thing that could've made it better was to offer a kuro version. I mean, the portion, the pork, the noodles, were all perfect. I will definitely go here again next time I'm in LA. But then again, there are other ramen joints on the same side of the street. At least I know I can always rely on Daikokuya if I'm not thrilled about the other offerings.

This isn't a review based on the universal standards of ramen, just my palate which may be used to bolder flavors.  When you show up, be sure to go in to write your name down on the list and be prepared to wait between 30 - 45 minutes. We ordered pickles and two bowls of ramen.  The pickles were great and work perfect as a starter.  For the ramen, I was hoping for handmade noodles because the place is so popular but it seems there are few places in town that actually make their noodles in-house.  The flavors are subtle with few accoutrements. Ultimately, we left unsatisfied and ready to search out different ramen places.

I've heard alot of good things about this. So one weekend afternoon my family and I were standing there waiting for the resturant to open. I would like to mention we were not the only group. I guess others saw groups of people who would line up in the afternoon, singing their names to a waiting list and looking longingly at the diners enjoying their meals. Unluckily I didn't order the ramen. However those in my group who did said it was great. I had their tempura which was really good but after hearing the others talk about the ramen I want to go back for those soup,noodles... and meat... and egg... oh I want to go back! Update 8/11/07: Went back and the raumen was as good as expected. I found a new great dish too, their cold noodle Hiyashi-Chuka?. At first it looked like something I could try to make at home but it was great also. Also tried their unagi/eel. Lately I've really like eel and they have helped that taste in my mouth to grow. That eel dish was delicious.

You know when is the best time to go there? At around 3-4pm... Yup, I'm willing to mess up my eating schedule just to eat there without having to wait for a long time.   During normal lunch or dinner hours, the wait can last for hours, especially on the weekends.  But you know what, it is damn well worth it.  Anyway, I discovered this place a few months ago after driving by it and seeing the long long line.     A good thing about this place is that it closes at midnight.  If you tend to get hungry soon after dinner, this is a good place to go to.  I like the chicken egg bowl, though most people like the ramen!  I introduced this place to my friends and they are now huge Daikokuya fans!!

Easily, my second favorite ramen house in Southern California. And we're talkin' a CLOSE second. Again with the magical broth - these Japanese chefs know what they're doing! Selection wise, their menu is quite applaudable for being mostly just ramen. It's open until the wee hours of the morning - which is befitting for LA art nights (it's down the street from MOCA's Geffen Contemporary). You seriously can't miss this place. It has a bright yellow awning and a HUGE line of followers outside, eager to consume some noodle.

I so much wanted to like this place --- so I tried it twice.  Both times, it was ... really 3.5 stars, but the wait was longer than any other ramen places in LA should be -- so I downgraded to 3.   Service is slow for a ramen place,  In Tokyo, ramen arrives in less than 3 minutes.  Here, try 15-20 minutes.  The noodles were good and firm, and soup was little on heavy, oily side.  The smell of kansui was little too much on the noodle - I suspect that it was sitting little longer than it should have been (meaning the turnover wasn't quick enough to reach my batch).   If the wait isn't much, then I'd recommend it for the genuine ramen atmosphere of old Tokyo -- but if there's a line, then I'd say skip it.

Always a wait, parking sucks ($2/hr meters), and uncomfortable bar seating. However, it's worth sucking it up for some decent ramen (on this side of the Pacific anyway).  However, not all of their ramen is created equal - their signature bowl can be better on some days than others, and sometimes, even on the same day!  The other day, my BF's bowl was WAY saltier (and more flavorful) than mine.

Ramen for the masses, if you want to wait for an hour or so, and get into an environment that's really hot inside, then, this is your place. Was invited to come here in the summer with a group, have been here about three times, wanted to find out what the hype was about. Long lines, ramen was OK, nothing special, and I actually didn't really think it was all that good.  But, that's my opinion. I LOVE noodles, ramen being noodles.. So far in Los Angeles, probably Shinsengumi Shoyu ramen I enjoy the most.. I've had some good ramen here.. http://www.gnavi.co.jp/a… Esp. Hokkaido style Miso -- So good! and some others, the sweet beef stock...  Oops... But, I digress...

It is good place to go during late night,and unfortunately there is always long waiting. Their Ramens & Fried Rice are my favorite. The porks in ramen are pretty juicy, but very salty. The secret to this place (I found out) is MSG!!! (I saw a bucket of MSG near by the kitchen, which I thought it was funny) But, I still like the taste of the ramen soup, their simple menu, and decent customer service. Just be ware of parking! ( I got two tickets in the past ), and just read the sign before you park on the street next to the stores near by. There are also many homeless people walking around at night, (and never enough police ) Other than that, I will still recommend this place for late night dinning. They open till mid-night.

Daikokuya, for not much moolah Coma you can induce, with their kotteri flavored soup If you didn't know, what kotteri just might be It's xtra pork fat thrown, in your soup for free How ridick is that, to add extra fat To make your broth rich, cause you have an obese itch Moving on the subject, this place, one of best Either this or Santouka, My 2 recommendations to ya There's usually a long line, ~30-40 minutes is fine You can sit on bar stools, or in a booth with your fools It's got a distinct feel, like outta Japan real I swear there's only ever been, 2 or 3 same waitresses They shout Japanese at you, making this place truth With dishes that would fill, in case ramen ain't your bill Gyoza here are fried, to a perfect point of nice And for a couple bucks, xtra noodle, no need for luck I say it's worth the wait, doors do stay up til' late So 5 stars this place gets, never get complaints from friends Tho parking is a b*tch, find meters with some hitch Tho not too good for groups, max 4 + one more too

I hate how this place is so popular that you can never get seated within a decent amount of time. I mean... yes, the ramen is good, but it's not worth waiting in line for an hour when you're starving. Still, the tonkotsu is some of the best you can get in Little Tokyo, so when the line's not too busy I still come here. The shape of gyoza annoys me for some reason, though. They're like little sticks rather than bite-sized goodies of fried joy.

In the solar system of LA ramen shops, Daikokuya is the sun. Perfect, buttery chashu pork; mind-blowing egg; intense, rich and satisfying tonkotsu broth that isn't too greasy or overpowering, and huge servings. And for local ramen shops it's cheap!

Gyoza is not that special. It has a funny taste that my husband and I didn't like. I ordered the Daikoku ramen since they're so "well known" for it. Personally I felt the broth wasn't bad but needed a MAJOR kick. I had to add about half the measly container of chili powder to make it have somewhat of a kick. I liked the egg, the texture and slightly salted flavor. The center was cold for some reason which wasn't very pleasant. My husband also got the Daikoku ramen but + small tempura bowl. He said that he got the tempura bowl for the tempura. Plus he can never have a meal without rice. How typical asian of us! Salad that comes with the combo was good. Simple yet very unique. Overall, maybe my expectation of this place was too high from all the "raves" i heard of it. Unfortunately, it's not worth the stress of traffic, the awful parking, and the wait...oh the wait....

1st time LOVED IT 2nd time LIKED IT 3rd time Ehhh That was my feeling progression throughout the years as i continually visited this joint. They expanded to several different locations over the years and this may or may not have caused the quality of the food to decline but I can say that as the place got more and more popular, the food became less and less tasty. still a good ramen place to try though if youve never been before. if you dont like green onions tell them to hold the onions or else they will put a ton of it in the soup. ALSO try the Oyako Bowl or the Unagi bowl if youre not a fan of ramen.

My favorite Ramen joint in Los Angeles located in the heart of Little Tokyo.  Theres always a line but in my opinion the food is well worth the wait.  I normally order the combo ramen that comes with a rice dish (yes I eat a lot).   Quick tip: You will end up smelling like food after you leave this place, just a heads up.

3.5 but I'm rounding down because I did not like it enough to consider it a 4 star. I am by no means a ramen fanatic, but I do appreciate a good bowl of the stuff. Compared to Santouka ramen in Costa Mesa, I think Daiko pales in comparison. Santouka had better quality pork that really added to the dish, meanwhile I thought Daiko's pork was rather bland and did not add anything. Also, my ramen was a little saltier than I would have liked. That is not to say Daikokuya is not a worthy restaurant. It definitely is, especially on a cold day when you need some ramen to warm up your soul. I just think it is a little more hyped up than it should be. PS. The fried rice is very, very good and really bettered my experience. I would definitely recommend getting the ramen-rice combo. If you love rice, you could maybe split the fried rice and one bowl of ramen with a friend.

When my friend told me about this place and i looked it up on yelp, i thought it was all hype. But when i got there, my god! The smell of that place was amazing and i knew it would be worth the wait. Needless to say, this place is crazy, ridiculously, unbelievably good and I've been around the japanese food block a couple times. Like seriously, it was literally one of the best meals ive had. Get the kotteri ramen combo with fried rice for about $12 (it'll also come with a cabbage slaw and a delightful Japanese dressing). The kotteri gives it an additional lasting flavor that sticks to your taste buds a bit longer. And if you get the fried rice with it, eat it Asian style: take a bite of fried rice and sip the broth with the rice still in your mouth. Amaaaaazing. My friend had the shredded pork bowl with his ramen but I much preferred the fried rice, although both were ridiculously amazing. Parking: in la or any city, it's tricky and expensive. If you cant find street parking (and you probably wont), go down the street to judge aiso street and there is a really cheap Parking garage. $2 for the first 2 hours which is more than enough. And if you're cheap like me and want to stick around longer without paying an additional $3 for the 3rd hour, exit and make a u turn and get a new ticket. It's also not prorated so explore little Tokyo to get the most bang for your buck. Downsides: the wait is ridiculous. It was about a 30 min wait for a table for us (but it can run up to MORE than an hour) WORTH IT. but the service is fast and food comes out fast as well. And be sure to be there when they call your number. I've seen the waitress skip over numbers with no mercy! Also, dont bother with their 2 other branches, stick to this flagship restaurant. The wait isnt so bad at the other ones, but the quality takes a nosedive as a result. TL;DR: get ramen combo with the fried rice. Wait for table is long but food comes out fast. Park in the new parking structure on judge aiso. Eat. Enjoy. Dream about it later that night, & have daikokuya  become your new favorite place to eat, anywhere, ever.

It's actually 3.5 stars but I bumped it up because the ramen can be addicting. I didn't like it the first time because I have had better ramen in Japan, and the soup is a little salty. Then I got used to the taste and I keep going back for more ramen. The combo is a good deal if you are really hungry, but I usually just get the house ramen.  This place is always crowded at lunch/dinner time, so I tend to go there around 3pm. You can park on the 2nd street until 4pm, and since Daikokuya doesn't validate parking in the Little Tokyo Village, I prefer parking on the street.  I think they don't open for dinner on Sundays. The service is below average if you care about service in a not so upscale ramen place. I wouldn't go there with more than 3 people.

Daikokuya has the best ramen broth and chashu in town (which are like the most imnportant parts of ramen), and their gyozas are great, too. One bad thing is that you always have to wait a while for a table, unless you don't mind sitting at the tiny countertop with the kitchen flames roasting your face haha :) P.S. This is not the kind of place where you eat, take your time and chat with friends while tons of people are waiting for tables. Please be courteous! Eat, pay, and go somewhere else to chat. That is the ramen culture. Enjoy~!

Mmmmm just had some for the first time last night.   Broth...great. Noodles...good, but could've been better.  Perhaps it was because we were one of the last groups of diners... Pork...luscious! Green onions...plenty! Garlic paste...drool. Ginger...looove that you can add as much as you need. Fried rice...boooo!  "Don't order the fried rice" -waiter.  Guess the rice wasn't good enough for frying.  At least he was honest.  But I do hear the fried rice is excellent. Great.  My fingers are still swollen from all that sodium.  Eff it was worth it!

I like to think of myself as a ramen junkie, and once I started coming to LA for a boy, the first thing on my list of things to do was find good ramen. For lack of quality options in Norcal, this place ranks top on my list of california ramen indulgences. I love the thick tonkotsu style, and the chashu and aji-tamago are usually pretty good. The soup itself lacks the depth you find in Japan, but nothing some ichimi, white pepper, shouga, and garlic can't fix. I load that thing up and go home happy. Gyoza are also consistently pretty good. For those of us with smaller stomachs, they have a half sized version of their ramen and it has all the toppings still which continuously saves me from food-coma-and-pass-out on the drive home. Although the half size still causes the food coma, I can now stay awake.

PORK ME, PORK ME SOME MORE!!! Salivation. It's your brain telling your mouth it's time to eat. Although I had a gigantic lunch, I am drooling myself silly as I type this out. First and foremost: there are no reservations- like David Chang's staunch and purist philosophy; get ready to wait...and wait...and wait some more. I am a sneaky weasel so I ran off to Far Bar three doors down to get a cold tall Sapporo to split with my porcine fandom friend- after we put our name on the list of other ramenphiles awaiting their dance with the dae-ji. I think we were the 7th name down from the list and that quick jaunt to beer haven was timed perfectly as we were seated in just a few minutes upon return. Coordinate time with your place on the list and my arbitrary formula. If you don't understand what I just wrote, bring your nerd friends- they are probably with you anyways since they love ramen already. We were seated at the long bar and boy were we excited. I ordered the gyoza (long and flat shaped like cannelloni), fried with something reminiscent of cheese on top to give it an unusual but satisfying crust. My friend went for the Kurobata sausages- handmade fresh, as we were told. They were breakfast sausage sized- like the Farmer John varierty that comes in a container and not a big roll like Jimmy Dean. Casing was plentiful but it is the hallmark of fresh made sausage- who am I to argue with that??? The ramen was an exquisite reminder to myself that I will die from a heart attack one day. Kurobata pork char siu slices looked more like uncured fresh bacon from the Korean all you can eat BBQ. The egg was softboiled in a soy sauce marinade- like jangjorim for all y'all Koreans reading this. The broth was rich and velvety- like a thick cloak of a heavy cape worn by a delicious miso gentleman. Sigh. Where do I find one of those??? (Answer: Comic Con and/or mother's basement/ miso factory/ Rocky Horror in Tokyo?) I took a star off because of parking and the painful line. Other than that, this place deserve a rightful spot in my rotation of coronary cloggage depots. Check and Caduet, please!

First off, did you know that in kanji or Chinese, the name of the restaurant means "Big Black House/Family"? Pretty cool, huh? I discovered this Ramen House from a fun night out on a date. Though I've been through the Little Tokyo District a number of times, I never stepped into this restaurant before. My date LOVED this place, so I wanted to check what this uber-cool restaurant had to offer. I ordered the house special ramen soup: "Daikokuya Ramen" ( I think that was the name). Anyway, the soup was definitely good! The broth was creamy with lots and lots of chopped green onions! Yummm!! As you use your chopsticks to dig deep into this cool bowl of soup, you'll get to the good stuff: the ramen noodles! Now, these noodles are thicker than your usual ramen place, but they're tasty. They have a good chew to them. It also had some slices of pork and a boiled egg. Total yum! My date's order also came with a pretty good fried rice. The next time you're in Little Toyko, check this place out.   Just be prepared for a long wait in line during dinner hours - a wait can be up to an hour but very much worth it! Happy Ramen eating!

WOW, I have never really been much of a ramen person, coming from San Jose I usually gravitate more towards pho, but today my eyes (and stomach!) we opened and I realized how great quality ramen can be! I ordered the "kotteri" style and it was delicious, the broth had such intense pork flavor is was truly wonderful...  Now the only problem is if I have ramen anywhere else it probably wont live up to Daikokuya's.

I miss living just minutes down the 110 frwy because now I am not close enough to this gem of a place. I'm still "minutes" down the 110 but in the opposite direction and lets just multiply the previous minutes i was off the 110 by like times 5. It's probably one of THE best ramen places we have here in SoCal. Otherwise, you'll need to take a $900 flight to Tokyo to get the absolute best.   Really a must have/eat. There's one in MPK but I still like this one much better... probably because its one of the first locations.

I really, really, really like this ramen place. I didn't have the misfortune of having to wait for a long time because I came at an off hour because I spent an hour and a half deciding what I wanted to crave (basically when I have no idea what I want to eat, I take inspiration from something random, like the color green, associate it with some food like ramen and create an intense food craving out of it; associations don't have to make sense they just help my mind decide what I want to eat). The broth here is just spot on and really aromatic. I got the Daikokuya Ramen so there weren't many bells and whistles (i.e. 20 different fix ins) to this soup but the simplicity of the ramen highlighted the broth. The noodles were perfectly cooked where they were still a bit hard. The selection isn't the same as Orochan but honestly I think its so much better than Orochan. Daikokuya keeps it simple and easy so as not to mask what they're killer at. If you want some nuclear, ginormous ramen thats muddled go to Orochan--but if you want the good stuff, come to Daikokuya.

Another cultural institution. More than 1,000 reviews? What else can I add? A: Why buy ramen at a restaurant when you can make it at home for less than a dollar? B: Flavor. Texture. Experience. 1) For flavor, the broth is strongly pork flavored, and genuinely porky- I mean to say that it doesn't have that artificial taste from packaged ramen.  I enjoyed the broth in its porky simplicity. My friend disagreed and felt that it was  a one-note broth, and a lot of it, and joked about how it was like the post-honeymoon period of a bad relationship... You can use your imagination to create the analogy. Your broth just isn't as porky as it used to be? Shrug. 2) For texture, the noodles are cooked to be slightly firm, and feel like noodles rather than chemicals. In addition, there's a softness in the pork fat, a slight crunch to the bean sprouts and chopped green onion, and slices of bamboo shoots.  Oh, and the egg marinated in soy sauce is on the soft boiled side. 3) Experience? Food institutions... why are there 1,000 reviews? Because there's been a lot of buzz about it, and people are curious, or even maybe that people enjoy it here, and it has established a name as "the place to go for ramen."  Yes, there's usually a wait, but is it worth it? Yes, for the experience. Yes, it's more than "top ramen" but is it the top ramen? Yes, it's definitely up there. Ramen: Solid . Fatty pieces of pork. Smooth pork broth. Sides: Eel sauce with fatty fried pieces of pork over rice and seaweed? Fantastic. Fried Rice? Subdued flavor, but good to fill you up if you have a monstrous appetite. Gyoza? Nice. Fresh. Service: Efficient, and friendly. Parking: a few paid lots closeby(be prepared to shell out $5-10), but metered parking in front.

LONG wait, so do NOT come here if your are in a hurry. Good ramen, nice and al dente.  Get it kotteri flavor (added broth distilled from back fat), yum! The gyoza was so-so. I would definitely come back on a lazy do-nothing day (hope those days are coming back soon!)

As a ramen lover, I have to say, Daikokuya is my 2nd favorite here in LA. My first choice would be Chin Ma-ya of tokyo. I do like Daikokuya a lot though. The wait is super long, which is probably one of the reasons why I gave it a 4.. I really dig their combos.. The Tuna combo is really good. The cuts of tuna are nice and not too thick.. their fish is also fresh. I like their ramen, obviously! I also love their garlic paste.. Also, their shredded pork bowl is a orgasm in my mouth. I loveeeeee that shiet yo! Their new policy is 10 dollars min. for credit card! Just a heads up! but yeee! Mucho love to Daikokuya!

My friends have hyped this place up for me. And surprisingly, I just got the chance to stop by yesterday. It's a small restaurant in Little Tokyo. Since I was with my experienced friends, we headed over there around 6 PM, signed our names on the waiting list and walked around Little Tokyo. We were seated in roughly an hour. We all ordered the combo with a side. I got the side of shredded pork. First comes your salad with their delicious thousand-island mayo dressing. Overall the salad is a little bland had it not been for the dressing. Our sides arrived next. My shredded pork was delicious, but the pork belly was not as tasty as Santouka's - a little disappointing. Good nonetheless. The fried rice, which was my friend's recommendation, was so so so good. The ramen was yum. I was told to order the ramen with extra fat. Now, extra fat sounds disgusting and in fact, it is. Especially when I took the rest of my ramen bowl home and heated it up for lunch only to see that the sides of my bowl were laden with lard. Anyways, it makes the broth extra thick but I don't particularly think I'd prefer this. The regular broth is fine. The pork belly in the ramen is delicious and the ramen noodles are the perfect combination of soft and hard. Not only that, but they give you a HUGE portion. I couldn't finish it - hence, that's why I took it home and saw the disgusting lard the next morning. Overall, good. If I'm in the area, then awesome - I'm going to Daikokuya. Otherwise, the wait is a little too long and the drive is a little too far.

I was pretty excited about coming to Daikokuya. It was a cold night, and I was really craving for a good bowl of ramen. We went there around 7pm and of course, there was already a long wait list. I don't really mind waits, especially when I have good company, but we ended up waiting for almost one and a half hours before we were seated. The larger group in front of us claimed to have waited for over two hours. We ordered one Daikoku ramen combo with unagi don, and a Tsukemen, which is basically a ramen with all the elements (noodle, soup, toppings) separated. The ramen came out relatively fast. The texture of the noodles were good, and the soup was good, and the slow boiled egg was also nicely done, but I was really waiting for a moment of amazement that never came. The bill was around $35. Overall, they do serve decent ramen, but this is one of those times when the popularity of a place actually negatively affected my visit. I really don't think that it's worth the 1+ hour wait, especially when there are similar options next doors. It was kind of depressing actually, watching groups of people huddled around Daikokuya, whilst the ramen shop next door had a staff member with a sign standing outside, trying to attract customers. It seems like Daikokuya has monopolized the ramen crowd in LIttle Toykyo, but next time I will definitely give the other shops a shot.

We went to this place at about 5:45 on a Friday evening, based on their super reviews and proximity to the sweet shop down the block. We ordered a big bowl of ramen, spicy tuna fried dumpling things (I don't remember what they're called), and the gyoza, another fried pork thing. Both the fried sides were pretty good, nothing special though. When dipped in a generious amount of soy, at least it was salty. To be honest, if you blindfolded me I probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference between the tuna and pork by taste, if that tells you anyhing. The ramen was ok. It was my first time having proper ramen, so i'm not really going to judge its merits. Maybe I just don't like ramen? The decor was cute, and the place was small but our wait was only 5 minutes or so since we got there early in the evening. The price was certainly right, with our whole check under $30 not including tip. Overall, not bad but I won't return.

3.5~ Two hours. Two hours of my life, I waited in line to join this crazy frenzy of folks with their "this is the best ramen I've ever had," so I too could say it. Coming on a Sturday (630p.m. ish which probably explained the incredibly long wait that allowed me to wander thoroughly to explore Little Tokyo)...we were finally seated in a cramped little booth. This place is smaaaalll. The food however, comes out so quick...ramen does not normally take a long time though and THANK GOODNESS IT DOESN'T because I probabaly would have died from starvation. The Daikoku ramen, to say the least was good. Noodles pretty chewy, rich tasty broth, melt in your mouth pork cha-su, topped with a bunch of bean sprouts and green onions. I wouldn't say the best I've bad but pretty good. THE FRIED RICE HOWEVER! I know, how great can fried rice be right? That's what I thought too, until Daikokuya's review highlights kept mentioning the fried rice. Naturally, I ordered it. I can't explain to you the amazingness of this dish, but my friend and I devoured this before even touching our ramen. Get the fried rice combination. Do it. For a Daikoku combination (the ramen, fried rice, and a salad) came out to be around $12. I'm not sure whether I'll have the determination to do this whole wait deal again, although my love for ramen may just give me the strength to do so. Just some advice: Come in here with the mindset that it's gonna suck. Reading about food hypes, dude, I'm telling you. It' teases your taste buds.

Kono basho wa oishiidesu! (This place is delicious!) I love ramen, it is my ultimate comfort food especially the ramen here at Daikokuya! My boyfriend wanted to go to Little Tokyo and we decided to eat here. Its small and a little narrow than most restaurants so if you go in a big group you would have to wait for a table. I ordered their ramen combo which is a HUGE bowl of ramen and a medium-sized side order of a rice bowl (with chicken, pork, or beef...your choice). I was so full I couldn't finish it, so we took it to go. Their ramen is so yummy, its definitely worth trying. They also have cold noodles, a traditional Japanese dish that I LOVE and now regret not ordering. Check this place out the next time you come to Little Tokyo!

Good ramen - it's really hard to distinguish which ramen restaurant is the best because they have their own styles... it's really up to what style you like. I like this place, but some of my friends find it "ok" and they have their own preferences. Some of the place they say "It's the best" are one of my least favorite ramen place... so don't read this review too seriously, ok? I like their interior - they have posters and signages from the early 1900's Japanese style.. One thing I wish they would fix is......... please serve your ramen hot! I don't know if it's because they're afraid of getting sued in case someone burns their tongue saying "the ramen was too hot!", or if it's simply because they keep their veggies in the referigerator and top it on the ramen right before they serve it, which brings down the temperature. I want my ramen to be hot. That's my only "complain", but other than that I like their style :) And some of you may be wondering "is it like THAT cold???", no, of course not. I can see the steam still coming out of the ramen, but it doesn't stay hot long enough for me =) Maybe i'm just a slow eater.

The ramen here gives me a food high. My first time the broth got cold too fast and the noodles were too soft (for my taste). But last night it was so perfect. Didn't wait too long (3 parties ahead of us on Sunday ~ 6pm). Next time I'm going earlier again to beat the evening rush.

Daikoku-ya is the best damn raumen joint I've ever been to.  If you order their raumen there, get it with kotteri (extra rich) if they have it...and if you think you can handle it.  I avoided it my first time there...but had to try it my second time.    Shoulda got it the first time to say the least. ;-) Some advice, if you want kotteri, go early.  Also, my old roommate (who's a regular there) stated that Wednesdays have the best tasting broth...for whatever reasons.

"Meh. I've experienced better." Honestly, I have. I don't understand the hoopla and shebang for Daikokuya. I think it's because there really aren't any other good ramen places in Little Tokyo. I've been to the best ramen places in Japan, and of course, nothing compares. But there are other places in LA that have better ramen than Daikokuya, hands down. Daikokuya's noodles are a bit too hard for ramen noodles. They just don't seem fresh, plain and simple. The soup broth is very average - nothing special. And I have one problem with this place: the fried rice is SO oily! When I got my fried rice, it was literally - no exaggeration here - drenched in oil at the bottom. So folks, try somewhere else when you're looking for a bowl of ramen. Mmm Mmm

We showed up here at 6:15 and thank god we did because not 5 minutes after we sat down, the line blew up. As we were leaving, we had to fight through a throng of people attempting to sign up their name for a table. There were only two parties before us so we were sat almost immediately. We accepted two spots at the counter which made me feel like we were at an actual ramen place in Japan, but the drawback was that those around us could hear our entire conversation. Not good if you are trying to discuss things that are private. As far as the food, we started off with a spicy tuna roll. It was good, but also unmemorable. We both got the daikokuya ramen, and its probably the best ramen I have ever had. The broth is just so different, in a good way. It's thickier and creamier than what you would find at another ramen place, but its delicious. I have never gone into a ramen place and not eaten the whole bowl, but the combination of the thick broth, noodles, and meat made me give up about 3/4 into the bowl. But I left completely satisfied. Cost: $26.95 for a spicy tuna roll and two daikokuya ramens

Quite possibly the best Japanese ramen house in LA... no... dare I say the entire US? Why do I say this? There's plenty of reasons. -Decor: This place screams 80s Japanese restaurants in emerging America. It's got old school posters on the wall, manga in the corner, you name it. This place just has that coziness to it. -Food: The most important aspect is the food. They have one kind of ramen, and they specialize in it. Personally I love the kotteri flavor, with scoops and scoops of garlic added into it. Suck on that Orochan! Regardless, they have other things that are just as tasty... like their bombass gyoza. Sure the parking situation sucks, and if you get there at a bad time the wait is horrendous, but that's expected for greatness no?

Houston, we have a problem. A pig problem. This place is always busy. People must love it. So I braved the wait one time cos my curiosity got the best of me. I got some tiny seat in the corner with one for my wife, next to it. The ramen was actually pretty good...but...however...yup. That pork broth for which this place is famous, is just a little too damned porky. Like there was an overcooked pig bone was sitting in my bowl. Too. Porky. Not a fail. Just maybe too much of a good thing. 4 minus 1 equals 3 stars. And I would only consider that wait....maybe...for five stars. TOO MUCH PORK FOR JUST ONE FORK, BYATCH! (quoting Southern Culture...kind of)

One of my top ramen spots in Little Tokyo. Orochan and Daikokuya are my top 2. I don't know which one beats out the other though. The line is always long here. Especially late at night. You should just come here with a small group... Get seated faster... if you're lucky... I always get the Daikoku Ramen. Never fail. and Delicious.

The ramen here is wonderful. I normally get the Tsukemen w/kotteri.  The tsukemen has all the ingredients separated from the soup since I like my noodles to stay firm and also ends up better should I bring home leftovers.  I highly recommend the kotteri flavor... yes it is fat but it's so much more delicious.  The shredded pork belly bowl is also very good and juicy. This is the best ramen I have tasted outside of Japan. However, because I live pretty close by I've tried come here at odd hours during the weekdays to avoid the wait but still I can not justify waiting for an hour so I'm gonna have to give it 4 stars and not 5.

Mmmm Ramen! I love this place! I will wait for hours in the freezing cold just so I can have a bowl of their delicious ramen! Luckily I'm never the only one waiting for my name to be called. I have lots of company outside lol. Their broth is so savory and full of flavor, the pieces of pork just seems to melt in your mouth and their portions are huge!! Very reasonably priced. Probably one of the best ramen places in CA. I've also tried their pork belly bowl which was good, but let's not kid ourselves, the ramen really is the star of the show here.

Hands down one of the best ramen shops I've been to in Los Angeles, and not just for the ramen! Especially because it's only a few dollars more than the base price of the ramen, I always make sure to get a  combo. I've tried most of the combo sides, and my particular favorites are the eel bowl, shredded pork bowl, tuna sashimi, and chicken and egg bowl. The wait is usually quite long and requires standing outside. About a month ago, my friends and I had to wait outside in the rain for about 45 minutes. However, in my opinion the ramen quality and portions are well worth it. Plus, if you put your name on the list and it looks like your party won't be called for a while, you can just stroll around Little Tokyo for a while. I was a little disappointed with the kotteri (special back fat) broth ramen; it didn't add too much flavor beyond the regular broth and it seemed like a lot more fat. I enjoyed it, but didn't really see what made it a "speciality." That aside, Daikokuya is definitely my default choice when in Little Tokyo, and a definite 5-star restaurant. And for the price you can't go wrong!

The first time I had their famous ramen noodle (btw the ONLY selection they have) around 11:30pm, it was yummy.  Ate their 3 weeks ago around 1pm and here was my order: Their one and only ramen with extra green onions & bamboo - the only thing tasted hot was their soup.  Felt like I was having a COLD yakisoba w/soup GYOZA  - nice thinly wrapped and pan-fried to perfection!!! JAPANESE sausage (looks like mini hot dogs) - pretty yummy Sad to say this time experience wasn't as good as I first had it. I had better ramen than theirs and PHO sure not so eager to wait for 30mins+ to eat here anytime soon.

The wait (and there's usually a wait) sucks but I gotta say this is one of the more tasty ramen joints everrrrrrrrr.  I've never tried anything else and won't try anything else other than their famous Daikoku ramen and fried rice combo.  The broth is amazingly good, Chasu melts in your mouth, and the noodles are chewy and tasty.  The fried rice is bomb too, and it rivals that of Koraku's.   It's like this... Daikokuya - ramen is bomb, fried rice is bomb Koraku - ramen sucks, fried rice is bomb Orochon - ramen is bomb, fried rice sucks So Daikokuya is the best of both worlds~

I tried the Daikokuya in Monterey Park, that was horrible. All of my friends were telling me that the one in Little Tokyo was exponentially better. So I actually went a few months back, then I tried it again today. Parking kind of a female dog to find, but it wasn't too much of a hassle. There's always a small line when I arrived, but it didn't take more than 20 minutes. I was pretty hungry so when the waitress asked if I mind dining on the counterpart, I readily agreed. The place possess a unusually comfortable ambiance and the aroma smelled delicious. The service was fairly decent since the waitress were quick to ask what I wanted to drink right after I sat down. I ordered the Shredded Pork Combo (Daikoku Ramen, Salad and Pork? on rice). The broth was alright, kind of salty. Noodles and a few slice of pork. Rice, I only ate half. Maybe I just wasn't hungry, but I wasn't really feeling their ramen today. Its also quite pricey too, but you get a guaranteed full stomach and a food coma (well, I do). Highlights: - Parking may pose a problem - Varying wait times - Option of booth or counter-top seats - Okay food, kind of pricey - Good Service

The only reason I give it 4 stars is because of the wait, but after you sit down and finally get to eat the famous daikokuya ramen...it's worth it!  My girlfriend, her kids, and I definitely had this on our go to list during our little tokyo trip and boy were we glad we did!  The one ramen portion could've fed all four of us but we wanted to eat different things.  I had the traditional daikokuya ramen, then they had the "cold" ramen style, bento box, and the eel bowl, all of which were delicious! The ramen was perfect, not at all like the ones you college kids eat for survival. Everything in the bowl mixed really well together especially that brown egg!  I thought it was going to taste weird but it was some good egg!  Although the bowl was fit for sumo wrestlers, I'd say I did well eating half of that for the tiny frame I have. All in all, cannot wait to get back there and have my picky husband try it out! Just be ready for that wait though!

I don't understand the great reviews about this place. My visit was around 3pm, 30 min wait, no a/c. bad start. If I'm having something heavy, greasy and fatty, i like to pair with spice/heat to balance. There was no spice, I guess I went to the wrong ramen place for our likings. The broth was luke warm, and salty, the noodles were good. My gf and I were both extremely dissapointed, as we were looking forward to this meal the entire cali trip.

Finally was able to get a seat at Daikokuya. This is the best Ramen in Little Tokyo and ranks up there with Santouka & Shinsengumi in the South Bay LA. I found the broth at Daikokuya similiar to Shinsengumi. The Chashu in the ramen is great and tasty. Big bowl so thats a plus. I like how each table has the pickled ginger and garlic for you as well. I will come back when in the area. $8.95 for the Ramen. TIP: go @ 3-4 pm and you will have  a seat with no waiting. Screw waiting for 1 hour at dinner time.

Kept hearing about this place. Finally got a chance to try it today. Ordered ramen combo with pork Katsu. It comes with salad. I love the creamy dressing on the salad. The portion is very generous. Pork Katsu taste great. I requested kotteri style ramen. I can see little bits of fats on the soup. I'm not complaining about the fat. Just didn't expect it to be so much. However, I was disappointed with the soup flavor. I was expecting something spectacular. To me, this place is just ok. I would rate the ramen 3 star. Pork Katsu is 4 star. Salad is 5 star. My favorite place for ramen are still : Santouka in west LA inside Mitsuwa Hakata ramen shinshengumi Robata jinya / jinya ramen (their Hakata ramen that is limited to 20+ serving)

I came here with Alison B. (see her review below). Daikokuya opens at 11am everyday, and we got there probably at 11:05am and were #21 on the waiting list? We ended up waiting for 45 minutes for bar seating for 3. My friends and I each ordered the Daikoku Ramen ($8.50) and it was amazing... hands down best ramen I have ever had. And don't you worry, the portion is HUGE! It comes with the noodles, amazing broth, egg, tender pork, bean sprouts and green onions. The actual place itself is quite small, so with the crowd, the wait can get kinda long. But it's totally worth it. Just write your name down, walk around a bit if you want, and be back for when they call your number! (Oh yeah, keep in mind what number you are.. they don't call by names.) Service-wise, the staff is friendly and the food comes out pretty quickly. Keep in mind, if you want to pay with a credit card, the minimum charge is $10 or else they'll add an additional $1.00 onto your bill. In summary: long wait (but worth it), amazing ramen, large portion, fast service once you're seated. Be prepared to leave in a food coma.

I used to LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. But a couple of days ago I went there again, hoping to feel the magic of their broth. I was disappointed. I ordered the usual: ramen with Koterri and a side of small fried rice. The broth was significantly watered down compared to previous times, even with the koterri, I can't imagine the plain broth. The bamboo was tough to chew, not at all pleasant like before. The pork...used to be the highlight of my bowl, is now slightly tough and dried up on the edges. The egg! Oh the egg....the ooey gooey rich yellow center of their ramen egg used to light up my face, but this time, I bit into it and spat it out. It's overcooked! The center was a powerdy light yello :(. Don't get me wrong, it's still a good bowl of ramen, but it's lost the magic. The fried rice was still a little lump of oily goodness, no complaints there.

Oh man, I'm so sad I missed that little blurb on the menu about the kotteri flavor!!! Don't be stupid like me, and follow all the yelper's advice - GET THE KOTTERI STYLE! If the ramen I got was normal, then I can only imagine how delicious the richer and fattier flavor is! So I got the full experience on a Sunday afternoon. The wait wasn't terrible, only about 30 or 40 minutes. But as soon as I was seated, the waitress was taking my order, and within 5 minutes, i had my food. I ordered the combo, and let me tell you... it is way too much food. The ramen itself was Enormous! Deliciously fatty pieces of chashu pork, tons of fresh scallions, bean sprouts, and bamboo, all mixed with soft noodles and amazing broth. The combo I got was the shredded pork. I just had that for dinner today... damn delicious! Next time I'd definitely try the teriyaki eel. Also, I heard from my neighbors that the gyoza was incredible; I watched them frying them and they were uniquely square. They looked really good... yet another thing to add to my list to try next time!!

I love this place. The only thing that's a little tricky is the wait time. We never seem to have a problem, tho, and we get seated in about 10-20 minutes. Sit at the bar and you'll get called much quicker. Food is excellent - perfect comfort food and they're open pretty late. 5 stars!

Over 2500 reviews so you know this place is good.  Good ramen?  You bet.  Long wait?  You know it.  No take out orders?  Yup.  Parking?  What parking, come as a group or be prepared to shell out for parking in private lots.

Daikokuya is good but I don't think it's great. I think Santouka is much better. I usually only go here when I'm eating alone because there's almost always a place on the counter that opens up for one person and I don't think this place is worth the long wait time for parties of 2 or more. I think the broth is ok but it feels kind of watered down and lacking in flavor to me. The pork is ok and the egg is just boring. The shredded pork bowl is delicious though. It's super greasy but i think that's what makes it good and it's good as left overs too..

I gave this place a 3-star because of the long waiting list which is often the case when you get there late as in between 6pm and 9pm. Right off the bat, I recommend the Teriyaki Eel Bowl, the two or three item Bento Box, and of course, their ramen bowl or ramen combo. Those are probably the best things they serve there. Everything else is nothing special. Don't get me wrong though, the other items that they serve are also very tasty but the portions have gotten smaller these last few months. I used to order Fried Rice and Chow Mein because I'm a cheapass sometimes and back then, they used to give A LOT but now, it's gotten a lot less. In effect, I don't order them anymore. Pitcher of beer there is $11 which is cheaper than any other restaurant in Little Tokyo. All other places charge at least $12 or more. There are bars in Little Tokyo that serve it cheaper during happy hours but I'm talking specifically about restaurants that serve actual meals, which also happen to serve beer. Overall, I recommend this place if you can stand the wait list.

Who knew that ramen could be delicious?!? I've been scarred by Top Ramen my whole life.. so when my good friend said that she wanted to eat at Daikokuya, I was less than thrilled but when I ate here.. I went to Ramen Heaven! In fact, I've been here 3 times in less than a month.. and I truly dislike: 1) Lines    2) Paying for parking    3) Hot environments   but I'll make an exception for this place because their Ramen is just that good!! I'm practically drooling like a Paavlov dog.. at the thought of Daikokuya but I must warn you.. this place is far from Kosher! Its a pork-a-thon from the broth to the toppings.. making it that much more yummy.. Just go.. even if you were scarred like me, you'll quickly change your mind!

Are you really serious? People wait in line for 30 minutes or something just to eat this ramen? o.m.g. It's unbelievable. So, my boyfriend and I were craving for some good ramen, we yelped and found Daikokuya and Orochon in downtown LA. So, we decided to drive up to LA from SAN DIEGO (yes, 2 hours driving) for our ramen adventure. We got there and we had to wait for 30-40 minutes. I was so excited about the ramen because of all the hypes. I was hungry and it was chilly outside (yes, we waited outside). So, I expected some decent ramen. Others said that Daikokuya is a better version of Shinsengumi. Oh, hold that thought. When we got in, we were seated on the bar. Man.. it is a dirty little joint (ps: bathroom too). My boyfriend decided to order a combo of ramen (with daikoku and another fatty broth I can't remember), an eel rice bowl and also a grilled kurobuta as an appetizer. We wanted to share the food because we were planning to go to Orochon afterward. Then this girl told us that we couldn't share the meal because it's a combo.. Ok. Then I decided to order a small ramen thinking that we could finish the food. The food came out pretty fast actually. We tried the appetizer and boy, it's the best appetizer I've ever tried. it was pan fried (even though they claimed that it's grilled), but whatever. It was really that good. then moving on to the eel bowl. Hm.. I'm not a big fan of eel, but I'll still eat it anyway, but for some reason, the fish smelled fishy. meh.. Here comes the ramen. I couldn't wait to dig in when I saw a bunch of green onion on top. I sipped the soup and looked at my bf. he gave me that disgust look that I had on my face too. It was bland. unbelievable. I had to put so much garlic puree and salt into the broth to make it edible. The egg, oh the egg. I was so thrilled to see the whole soft boiled egg. my bf doesn't like egg, so he gave it to me. I had 2 eggs in my ramen.  I was hoping at least the egg could save the day. mmmm.. i bit into it and my bf could see disappointment in my face. It's boiled to the way I like it, BUT it's tasteless. I dislike it. I don't usually leave my food untouched, but this one.. forgive me, I just can't finish it. I think I should stick to Santouka for the broth, Tajima for the egg and Shinsengumi if we're around orange county area. oh well.. at least the kurobuta saved the day.. 1 star for that.

The broth is opaque with a buttery-like richness and strong umami flavor from hours of cooking down bone. The fatty pork slices are nice and tender. The soft boiled egg in the ramen is my favorite part of the experience, perfectly boiled every time. I also quite enjoy the small jar of pulvarized garlic that you can sparingly dump into your bowl should you choose. The hand made gyoza, shaped like little pillows filled with meat should be tried, though it may not be for everyone. Minus 1 star goes to one hour+  wait, though I simply spend my time walking across the street to eat at the red bean bun place.

This place is is single handedly the best ramen. The soup is so original and authentic. They make it overnight. Orochon is nothing. It just spicy. Hakata ramen is so expensive. Minus one star because the place is small and when it is crowded, you will have to wait about 30-120 minutes. I always try to go there not at peak hour.

For me, having good food means one thing, but having a wait staff that will go above and beyond is what makes Daikokuya amazing. The ramen is awesome, the best in Los Angeles area in my mind.  What made me write this review was when I had finished eating my meal (a little less than half was left... the portions are HUGE!).  The waitress took my bowl and I requested that I get the rest to go.  After getting the check and waiting for my food to come (about 5 minutes), another waiter came over to ask if we were ok.  I asked him where my to go food was, and when he came back he said that the lady threw it out.  SO SAD!  Ramen is so good after drinking or the next day, so I was seriously bumming.  The waiter offered to make me a whole new serving of ramen on the house, which was AWESOME!  That guy (I think he had his hair braided and had classes) IS AMAZING!  He packaged it all up so that the soup was in one container and the rest of the dressings were in another.   All in all: 1) Daikokuya has the best ramen in LA 2) The waitstaff is RAD 3) It's a shame that they don't do takeout

Oh, the ramen here at Daikokuya is so flippin' good, just remembering about the taste makes the mouth water. I just ate here with my friends - this Daikokuya is located on 1st street next to the Anime Jungle store and near MOCA and JANM (to give you an idea). I've always seen this place, but I've never tried it. It is sooo good. Their menu consists of a couple of things: Specialities and rice. Daikoku Ramen and tsukemen (same ramen) with noodles for dipping. The rice bowls seem pretty standard: chicken teri, salmon, etc, etc... Let me get to the main point: the ramen. Daikoku ramen: This is exactly as they describe in their, uh... description. The broth isn't heavy at all, it's made from tonkotsu (the pork) and worth every minute. The ramen noodles are egg noodles, and then to add a plus on my list, there's the hardboiled egg. Simply fannnntastic. Nothing would go better with this soup. I've had ramen, I've had buffet style ramen (think Todai) and this! There's such a long line for Daikokuya - if you don't arrive on time - for example you wanted to eat at 5:00 - expect at least an hour or so wait. I gave Daikokuya a 4 out of 5 because i haven't tried everything on their menu yet. When I get to try the tsukemen and the rice dish(es), maybe then it'll be a 5 :).

I love you, Daikokuya!!! When I left LA to go to school in the middle of Pennsylvania, you were the only thing I ever craved.  Sure, watching Naruto increased my desire to eat ramen, but you were who I thought of everytime. Get the ramen kotteri - bad for your arteries, but gives the broth SO MUCH great flavor.  I hear the tsukemen is good too.  It's more luke warm than cold, but still maintains the same great flavor. Best bang for your buck is the ramen combination - I always get it with the fried rice or pork cutlet.  Their gyoza is delish too.

One of the best ramen places i've ever been to. Food: The house Ramen is delicious ($8.50)!  You can get in in LARGE ($12.50).  The waitress was actually kinda taken aback when i said large, and i get why...this thing is huge only order this if ur serious about eating!  You can get the ramen with extra pork fat (sounds like a disaster, but its oh so good!) We also ordered spicy tuna wraped in shiso leaves and fried, it was good but not exceptional. Service: Once you can actually get a seat, it is with the quickness!  The waitress is ready for drink orders and will be back promptly for your food order.  The food comes quick and hot.  After that the waitresses aren't super attentive, but it was a packed house. Atmosphere: A little loud, most likely sitting at the bar if ur a couple not a great place for a date, but it makes up for it by being delicious, and kinda cute.  not really great for large parties either seeing that they can't support much. Final Cut: The Food bomb bomb 10/10 The Service was quick 8/10 I'll come back every time I'm back in LA!

5 stars for what it is - a ramen house. (It's small, almost always has a crowd of people waiting beneath the yellow awning, and is very VERY hot on a summer's day. Not the place to linger and lounge after your meal, unless you want a mob of hungry folks staring you down!) However, the ramen is top notch!  Don't pass the fried rice either! Together they are very crave-worthy.  My girlfriends and I each order the kid sized ramen (don't think it's on the menu) and then share a plate of the yummy fried rice, and it is just enough.   Try to get there before the noon hour crunch, and then maybe you won't have to put your name on the clipboard and wait.  Oh yes, and I've seen Japanese tour groups stop here...so I guess that vouches for it being a decent meal ;)

Believe the hype please!  This place has one of the best ramen I've had in a while.  I loved the Chicken/Egg Rice Bowl that came with the combination Ramen.  The ramen had great texture to it and it wasn't overwhelmed with bean sprouts.  One thing though that I would not recommend ordering is sushi.  One of my friends order a california roll and it was not the business.  If you come to this place, stick to the ramen and you won't be disappointed! P.S., Hell yes you will be waiting in line for a while.  I waited more than an hour but it was worth it.  Enjoy everyone.

It's pretty hard to find good ramen outside of Japan sadly, and I've yet to find a ramen I'm in love with. Despite that, the ramen at Daikokuya is actually pretty decent. After waiting about 40 minutes to be seated (people seriously need to eat a little faster), I got to eat a nice, warm bowl of Kotteri ramen. This is as close as I've come to a ramen that I would want to eat on a repeat basis. They always have a heaping jar of garlic and ginger so that alone is enough to earn a few stars. The noodles were cooked well and the broth was savory. While I liked the fried rice the first time I went to Daikokuya, this last time it was a bit lackluster, not bad, but it lacked the flavor it had the first time I tried it. The black sheep of the entire meal was the miso soup. It was actually pretty terrible and had this odd flavor I can't quite wrap my head around. I'm a big fan of GOOD miso soup and was looking forward to downing the small bowl but was disappointed. Overall 3.5 stars. If a few things were changed around then it would definitely get 4-5 stars.

Yes, we had to wait an hour...But it was honestly the best ramen I've ever eaten. SO AMAZING. The pork bowl was also out of this world. This place is known for it's long wait, however, it's well worth it.

Time for me to share my passion for Daikokuya's ramen! My most recent visit was with a friend from outside the area Friday evening.  Signed up at Daikokuya's waiting list, went to Far Bar for an excellent couple of beers, and managed to wander around and see the sights in Little Tokyo for ~20 minutes. While our wait was over an hour, Far Bar and the cool neighborhood of Little Tokyo made it fairly pleasant. I always order the ramen, and split an order of the gyoza.  The ramen broth is thick and rich, and coats the noodles perfectly.  One of those meals that I'll rave about to anyone that will listen.

This is definitely the best ramen in Los Angeles. Santouka is a close second, but Daikokuya's tonkotsu broth (must get kotteri) is still better, especially with the the added diced garlic sauce. I'd rarely give 5 starts for any place, but this place definitely deserves it. The portions you get for the price is a definite plus. I usually get the shredded pork bowl with my kotteri ramen, which is also delicious and packed with flavor. I always end up taking it home because I just can't finish the bowl after devouring the ramen. Daikokuya recently rose their price in some of the items in their menu, but I still think that they're decently priced. A small salad, huge serving of ramen, and a bowl combo for 12 bucks is not bad at all. Although there isn't much variety when it comes to ramen at Daikokuya, it's like In 'N Out- if you have one awesome thing in your menu, why is there a need for variety? The only bad thing about this place is the wait. You'll be waiting at least 45 min no matter what time of the day you come in. I hate waiting long periods of time to be seated to eat, but Daikokuya is the one place that is worth the wait.

Yes, the wait is long especially during prime time.  The wait might be shorter if the servers didn't lag so hard with bringing the bill.  And I am pretty sure the ramen wouldn't be such a rockstar if he didn't contain those delicious strips of pork belly that totally "burst with flavor" and just "melt in your mouth."  It's pretty awesome.  The broth is also excellent and rich and the noodles are just normal ramen Sun Noodles, but super comforting.   I order the half-size ramen bowl so I can get an appetizer as well and I end up with the perfect amount of food.  I love the gyoza because they are stuffed with the crazy pork and taste wonderful with a tall Sapporo.  So I always order those two guys together.  It is actually worth the wait and not bad for a hangover. The fried tuna appetizer is fried with a shiso leaf, which is an interesting taste. Ignore the MSG label.

I went to Daikokuya recently while on a business trip to downtown L.A . For those of you who have never been to Daikokuya, its easy to find on 1st street (just look for a large group of people standing out on the sidewalk). After having traveled to Japan twice, and been lucky enough to enjoy real Ramen before, my bar was set high already. That, and waiting in line for nearly an hour on a Tuesday night had me thinking "man, this place MUST be amazing!" Well, Daikokuya did not disappoint. I had the Daikoku Ramen with fried rice combination and a bottle of chilled sake. Considering how packed this place was, the service was quick and responsive. I devoured my ramen while emptying my bottle of chilled sake, and felt at peace with the universe once again. Ahh Daikokuya, why can you not be in the San Francisco bay area? I am truly a fan, definitely worth the wait in line. Arigatou gozaimasu!!!

Love this place. I've tried this place as well as well as their new location in Monterey Park. Peeps are saying the broth in Monterey Park is a little bit more salty, but having tried both, I beg to differ. These two places are exactly the same in terms of taste, style, space, menu. Actually, if there is anything I noticed, the restaurant in MP offer half-size portions. Which is much more suitable for the ladies. The half-size portion was perfect for me. Go enjoy the noodles!

Named after a castaway on the island of Amchitka, Daikokuya has come to seem as the Island of refuge for hipsters in L.A., they cling to it as did the Captain to the isle. As great as the Ramen is at this lovely shop, I would be hard pressed to say it's the best Little Tokyo has to offer. What Daikokuya has to offer in comparison, is "Atmosphere", that great companion to enjoyment. Where as the other Ramen houses have a more modern restaurant visage, Daikokuya has "a cheerfully fake '50s-style" (as Jonathan Gold of LA Weekly put it),that seems authentic, intimate, and with the acceptance of Angelenos and Transplants alike, always brimming with life. Now that's a complete meal! But as those of us that live in Little Tokyo know, Where the Transplants seem to not venture, is: Mr. Ramen has an excellent Ramen(when the owner is the one making it), and San Sui Tei's Spicy Ramen is divine, And if you should ever get drunk with us locals, at Cosmo's bar, after Joe kicks us out, we will take you for a late night dine at Koraku's for some Mabo Ramen, and you tell me, this doesn't have something to offer. Point being, Daikokuya has yet to take title of the houses for this local, But they do serve an excellent Ramen, and will not disappoint. P.S. Our dear Captain did finally venture out, and find other islands.

I had worked near Little Tokyo for years and had never stepped foot in this place, but then a young co-worker introduced me to Daikokuya and I got hooked.  Hands down, they have the best ramen I've tasted in the Los Angeles area.  And just in Little Tokyo, there are several very good to excellent ramen places.   Their ramen is a tonkatsu (pork broth based), and I will get the half size because given the chance, I would finish off the regular size bowl, which is a good sized portion.  Everything about the ramen is great.  The broth is A-1, the noodles are excellent, and the toppings include a boiled brown egg, sliced pork, green onions, etc, all contribute to one fine meal. Lets say you are not in the mood for ramen.  Their combination dishes, where you pick items from a list is also great.  Appetizers?  Their gyozas are great.  Basically, no matter what I have ordered, I have been extremely pleased.

Delicious. Clearly the best Japanese ramen in that area. Always packed, long waits. Try not to go so late cause you'll waste your time and it'll ruin your experience (if it's your first time). Try not to take a group larger than 4, everyone needs to be there in order for them to seat your party. The waiting is my only complaint but there is a reason why the line is so long. Enjoy. DO IT!

By far the best Japanese restaurant (sushi aside) I have ever been too.   Atmosphere:  Tiny place in little Toyko.  Very casual, long lines, hard working and friendly staff.  There can be a huge line, but it goes surprisingly fast. Food:  Absolutely incredible.  The Pork is out of this world.  I would recommend it over anything on the menu.   Drinks:  A few good Japanese and domestic beers - not a huge selection but good for this size of place. Value:  Huge value play - Amazing food - Great prices.

Daikokuya ramen: good amount of toppings, noodles reminded me of store bought refrigerated ones, broth was flavorless. Friedrice:so-so, wasn't very flavorfull. Salad: Interesting flavor.Good.

I felt like the long wait didn't worth it. We came with a party of four around 4 o'clock, thinking that we could somewhat avoid the crowd. We were soooo wrong! It was still really packed. Two of us ordered their Daikoku Ramen. I ordered a combination of Daikoku Ramen and a small Salmon Roe bowl (comes with salad). And our last order was a bento box with tempura, chicken teriyaki, and california roll. First off, the miso soup that comes with the bento is EXTREMELY SALTY. Maybe it was the last batch from the pot? I'd assume that since it was salty and not hot at all. Salad is pretty yummy. The Salmon Roe was really salty also for some strange reason. I just couldn't come up with a possible explanation why it would be salty. The steamed rice was really good. The Daikoku Ramen wasn't as excellent as other yelpers say. The broth was not hot. The taste was decent but not impressive. The egg was half-boiled (yes, it's cooked) and I think that it was just right with the broth. Only three pieces of pork in the ramen total. The place is relatively small and it wasn't very clean.

This place rocks in every way possible but not worth the wait. Service was great even though it was very busy.  The Fried Rice was good as it should be.  The Chicken over Rice was good, nothing special.  The House Ramen " Daikokuya Ramen" - my wife loved it, I thought it was ok.  Great place but, again, not worth the 45 min wait plus the $8 parking.  I doubt we go back. Watched a poor guy try to eat while his toddler cried bloody murder, not fun and not for kids.  First timers write your name on the pad, remember your number and leave, for a bit.

On a recent trip to LA I stayed in Little Tokyo. Daikokuya was across the street and based on so many good reviews, I had to try out their Ramen It's crowded, filled with LA hipsters,tourists with giant cameras and fanny packs and new moms with baby strollers. Nice vibe, but very busy. We managed to get seated after only 20 minutes wait, so try to get there at "off-peak" hours like 4 or 5 pm week-days. The Ramen was great, but be warned: the broth is pork-based so it is not vegetarian friendly. There are veggie items, but just read the ingredients carefully. All in all, well worth the $$ and the wait.

This is more a three and a half star review. My parents and little brother came down to visit in July so my sister and I brought them here from the airport for a late lunch. Little did we know how late it would be-- we waited for 45 min before even being seated-- at 3 PM!! But hey.. the gazillion great yelp reviews told me it was worth it! We all got the ramen kattori style, my brother got a combo with the fried rice and my dad with teriyaki chicken. The teriyaki was not good at all, but my dad felt like he shouldn't waste food and finished it. The fried rice was AMAZING. So good! Should've ordered more. The ramen was wonderful-- good noodles, flavorful broth, and lots of overall yummy-ness. However, the egg (which I had so been looking forward to!) was a complete fail-- cold and cooked all the way through. I couldn't even eat the entire thing; it was such a disappointment! Since I'm pretty far from downtown LA, I don't think I'd drive all the way out there, pay for parking, and wait an hour for food. I'll probably hit up the Hakata ramen in Rosemead because its delicious there too!

After 3 or 4 attempts of trying to go here and everyone in my group being too hungry to wait, we finally made it in. Previous to this, Hakata had been my go to ramen place and I had seriously doubted that Daikokuya was any better. Well, it's definitely *as* good as Hakata, but I wouldn't say it's better. Some things I liked more, some things I liked less. Most importantly, the broth was out of this world. The most important thing to me about any bowl of ramen is the broth, and I have to admit they edged out any other broth I've ever had. I was really impressed. The noodles were firm, which is a preference of mine which was welcomed when they brought my soup out. They were out of the kotteri soup base so we didn't get to try that, but the broth was flavorful and plenty rich without it. The pork was soft, flavorful and fell apart in your mouth. Super delicious, I just wish there had been more of it. I wish they had things you could add in (corn, bacon, garlic flakes) like at Hakata, but at the same time it was nice not having to think about what toppings I wanted and eating this wonderful dish as it was intended. I will definitely be rotating my allegiances having finally been here now, 5 well deserved stars.

The line for this place gets obnoxiously long during peak hours. So if you're super hungry, I would suggest not dining here or you will get extremely agitated. I have a mindset of an old person when it comes to meal times so I choose to eat early most of the time. You pretty much have to plan your day around this place sorta like planning your day around traffic.  Best bet would be before 4:30 weekdays. I don't think weekends apply and I haven't tried.  The food is great. Wife and I usually split an order of soup w/ either pork belly or eel bowl on the side.  Can't go wrong with either.  Appetizers are ok but I love the cabbage salad.

My cousins and I who went to Daikokuya noted that you really know a good restaurant when the line is out the door and they only get a B from the health inspectors. After reading reviews and from word of mouth, I was prepared for the wait time between the highly talked about ramen in Little Tokyo. LUCKILY we had about a 10 minute wait just for the tables to be cleared- and it was a Thursday evening (~7pm)...but the lines came right after us. Service was quick and dirty, and three of us ordered the ramen combo which comes with ramen, salad, soup, and a side dish (ex. tuna sashimi over rice). WAY MORE THAN ENOUGH FOOD! The ramen bowl was huge and very flavorful. The broth was delicious and the noodles were done right. The tuna sashimi was VERY fresh, I was impressed. I think I have reached a new level of food coma after eating at Daikokuya...and it was magical.

Like most Yelpers believe, this was indeed, one of the best ramen I have ever had. I tried Daikokuya twice and finished the whole helping twice (and that rarely happens since ramen makes me full easily). I gave Daikokuya a score of 4/5 just for food. I'm not going to rate them on the facility or waiting time or service. But just a brief summary on those: facility was quite small which accounted for the extremely long waiting time (waited about 45 minutes for 2 seats at the bar) but it did give it a mysterious "hole in the wall" type of atmosphere; service was exceptional once you're seated even when they are busy - they get your drinks, take your order, and check up on you in a timely manner. Now to the food--both sittings I ordered the Daikokuya ramen which consists a broth created through the boiling of pork bones and other ingredients (so it is all handmade), ramen egg noodles, slices of pork belly with just the right amount of fat, flavor, and texture, a boiled egg, bean sprouts and other veggies to go along with it. Not sure why it is but all these ingredients into that flavorful broth is not too rich that I get full early and not too dull that I get bored of the flavors. Instead, it is the perfect combination and the right amount that concludes in me finishing it off with the feeling of complete satisfaction in the end. The bamboo shoots and bean sprouts help create that balance in flavor so they are pretty necessary when you order the dish. My favorite parts would be the ramen egg noodles, which is the pretty texture and consistency; the slices of pork belly which has that wonderful section of fat to give it that meaty flavor, the boiling egg with the rich yolk still intact, and finishing it off with the broth. Mmmmmmm...... Of course, I wouldn't eat Daikokuya everyday because it would be a little bit too much. But whenever my friends and I are near Little Tokyo and have a major craving for Ramen, Daikokuya is the place to go. I had to subtract a star from the perfect rating of 5/5 because of the time. Even when we come early to put our names on the list, my stomach sometimes can't take that much long of a wait and I end up getting grumpy.

Such an awesome Japanese restaurant!!! I ordered the Pork cutlet rice bowl+ramen combo. The serving size is humongous!! A normal person could never finish the ramen, the rice bowl and the salad in the combo. The ramen is really good. I like the rich broth and the half boiled egg. The rice bowl is even better! Anyways, everything is really really wonderful. You don't need to wait for a long time for the waiters to serve your dish after you order. A combo is usually $12-16. But for soooo much food! At least I think it's pretty cheap. And the beverages are refillable, which is so awesome. 5 Stars. No doubt.

In terms of the food itself? The BEST ramen place ever.  Definitely recommend.  However, the service is not up to the level of the quality of their food.  For couple of times, I was really upset by the rudeness of the Japanese waiters.  I wonder if that guy is still serving there.  I didn't see him on my last visit, but yeah, I hope they improve on serving. Yes, for all those ramen lovers, I very strongly recommend this place.  It is the best ramen place I've been to.  Nowhere topped this place yet.  Shinsengumi Hakata comes nowhere near this place. If only the serving's great, it would be just excellent all around. Another thing to watch out for is waiting line.  You will at least wait for 30min to hour to be seated in my experience.  So try to avoid the busy time of the day.

Love love love Daikokuya, which is the only reason I won't be too lazy to write a review even though this place has over 2500....  Have been here many times when I want my ramen fix.  Only place better than here is Santouka Ramen but I'm hardly ever willing to make the trek there when there is a perfectly good ramen place right next door! The ramen is amazing, huge and delicious.  The broth is extremely tasty and in it you find pieces of pork, egg, noodle, and some other herbs and stuff. The side dishes are also great.  The pork cutlet is one of my favorite things to get on the side there.   The salad they give in the beginning is a great appetizer as well.  I once got the cold noodles that you dip into the soup bowl.  It was spicy and pretty good too.  I loved it.   Downsides are that it is a B rating restaurant, and it does have an incredibly long wait.  Also the noodles in the broth are not the best.  If they would just fix that it would be perfect, but yet they do not which is why the number one spot in my ramen list still belongs to Santouka. Still an amazing place to eat a giant bowl of soup.

It was Sunday, and randomly decided to spend the day in Little Tokyo with a pretty lady. We were craving ramen, and knew we could find a random place that we've never been to; keeping our eyes peeled for a perfect hole in the wall with permeating smells rolling out the doors. We found Daikokuya, an unassuming, small ramen joint with a yellow sign, and clusters of hungry, waiting customers. As we walked up, we could smell it, the broth, the delicious goodness; we saw the antsy people waiting outside the door, some tired, some pacing. Deciding this was the place to go, we put our name on the list and waited 45 minutes. We went with the gyoza appetizer. Incredibly crunchy on the outside, and soft on the inside. A great precursor to the ramen combination with the shredded pork rice bowl. Both were amazing. The broth was flavorful and even slightly creamy, a broth that is the product of joints and bones soaked at an "undisclosed location". It got only better after adding the condiments: garlic, spice, and soy sauce. The noodles really stood out, as they were the perfect texture, not too soft or hard. The pork in both the bowl and the ramen was incredibly tender, bold, and flavorful. The staff was incredibly quick, kind, and efficient. This was a very memorable meal for me. One for the books. I'll be spreading the gospel and coming back.

Came here again today, but instead of going with a date... came here with friends. (: Since it's Spring Break, and I came here on a weekday (Tuesday), at around noon time, it was still crowded! But it's not as crowded as the weekends. Instead of ordering the daikokuya ramen this time, I ordered the bento box. My friends were disappointed that it didn't come in a bento box and came in a plate. Meh, I think they ran out of bento boxes? Haha. We ordered the pork cutlet, california rolls, and teriyaki chicken. OKAY. I know I ordered the teriyaki chicken last time... but WOW let me tell you... When you're eating with friends.. they open your eyes.. My friend actually noticed that the top part of the teriyaki chicken was crisp to perfection and that the inside was soft and not hard, and that the teriyaki sauce definitely complimented it. (: However, the pork cutlet was a bit hard... ehhh. My other friends that ate the ramen felt as if it was too much for them. They decided that the next time they came back, they would order one bowl and share. Haha. :D I never get utterly disappointed about this place. However, I still give it 4 stars because of how small it is inside.

Daikokuya is ramen heaven. The broth is unlike any other I've tasted, probably because they offer the extra fat option. The noodles are perfect and flavors are amazing. Every person I've taken here has left completely satisfied and in love with this place. You get a lot of ramen, but if it's not enough, you can always order the extra big bowl! What about the long lines? Well, you have to have a plan. Put your name on the list, walk over to Spitz, have a pitcher or two, walk back. By then you're probably 5-10 minutes from being called. I usually leave for an hour, and it's perfect. But make sure you get an idea from the hostess how long of a wait it is so you're back in time. Fried rice and chicken teriyaki are good too.

I didn't believe in ramen or ramen at first bite....I strayed and tried other ramen that were supposedly better all over Los Angeles ( Santoku, Orochon, Hakata, San Sui Tei, etc, etc) ....In the end, I surrender and went back to Daikokuya.

If you are just getting ready to try Daikokuya for the first time, I must say, I'm jealous. Jealous that you're right there, able to go into the building and have a steaming bowl of heaven, and jealous that you are about to have the best ramen experience of your entire life. Soon, with chopsticks in hand, you will be whispering what we all know to be an unequivocal and irrevocable fact. What you are eating is simply the Best. Ramen. Ever. This is not just ramen is worth waiting in line for.  This is ramen worth jumping on a plane and flying hundreds of miles for. We make a beeline straight to Daikokuya the moment the plane lands, and it's also the last place we eat right before leaving. All the food here is spectacular, but the Daikoku Ramen (kotteri flavor) is simply the single most outstanding item on the menu. You must, must, must try this ramen. It will absolutely change your life. WARNING: It will also spoil you for all ramen everywhere for all time. But you won't be too sad about that... you'll just pop back in line, and all will be well. Oh, and if you're from out of town, like I am, here's a suggestion of what to do to ease the pain of not having this ramen available daily - just keep checking the internet constantly for cheap Southwest tickets to fly back. Happy Eating!

Before I came here, I hear the word "ramen" and I think of those 5 for $1 Styrofoam cups. Yes. So when my boyfriend told me I had to try out the ramen, I looked at him like he had an extra head growing out of his arm. Ramen?! He drives me 45 minutes to LA and wants me to eat RAMEN ?! I was incredibly skeptical. I was skeptical despite the hour wait. I was skeptical despite watching Japanese people eat here. I was even skeptical when the steaming bowl of soup and noodles was set before me. One bite, one sip of soup... Wow. Ramen will never be the same. I come back here all the time now, and if you don`t go at rush hour the wait is very short but the food is just as good. This place is a great place to stop by twice a week or so; it`s not too pricey and it`s a very home-like meal. [ Plus, the Japanese girls in their school uniforms that come here are soooooo cute!]

That broth...those perfectly-done noodles...that mouth-watering pork....succulent gyoza...melded fried rice... The only ramen spot in LA that brings out crack-fiend tendencies within me.  I get violent convulsions just thinking about all of the above.  I'm drawn to Daikokuya like a zombie. Worth the wait - make the most of it by ordering the gyoza AND the ramen + [pick your pleasure] sets.  Wash it down with a beer and guaranteed you will walk out all smiles.

So good! (They make the broth at an undisclosed secret location). the pork cutlet goes great with the ramen... Only bad thing, it gets really hot in there. Hot ramen, on a hot day... phew, but it's sOoO good.

Why haven't I reviewed this place yet?  I could have sworn I did but I might possibly have had a stroke at the time I intented to put down my thoughts on this ramen haven into words. Displacing shisengumi as one of my favorite ramen joints in LA, when you arrive at this cozy little restaurant in the heart of downtown's Little Tokyo, you're almost always greeted with an enormous line once the sun goes down.  It's said the cooks prepare and render down the pork bones and fat to make their delicious broth in a separate secret location daily, then transport by armored van with multiple armed guards to their various restaurant locations fresh daily.   Ok, I made up the part about the armored transport, but you get the idea.  A friend of mine told me that if you want to experience the soup at it's best, go during lunchtime as opposed to dinner because the broth is fresher and one can taste a difference.  I haven't had the opportunity to put this to the test yet, but I can say that it still works wonders for me at dinnertime.  Ramen only comes in one size: big n satisfying and you can order it alone or paired with numerous sides in combos.  I usually get mine with the shredded pork rice bowl on the side, which also includes a shredded cabbage salad as well. Dining can be done in true ramen house fashion at the counter or traditional table seating, altho space is tight with either.  Going back to the line, this is one of those cases where if you truly love the ramen, go with as few people as possible.  Hell, go alone if you have to like I did the last time and you're guaranteed a MUCH faster seating as they will plug you into a lone empty chair up at the bar while people in parties of 2-6 will wait forever and a half.  So if you're the type of person who has no friends, finally a silver lining in the cloud! I can see why some folks would be grumpy about the wait and dissapointed with the hype, but taking that out of the equation, the balance of the noodles, soup, pork is pretty damn good to me and I've had my share of ramen at various places.  I also consider myself blessed in life that work is about a 15 min drive to Little Tokyo so I'll always have that opportunity to explore the rest of the menu on return visits.

Better than Shinsengumi and Gardena Ramen. Not as good as Santouka or Asa Ramen. Have to get the Kotteri, and add garlic, imo, to get most out of the flavor. Prices are about as expected.  I bumped them up from 3 to 4 star just because they gave me refills on my drink.

One of the most overrated JPN joints in LA - I will admit that I used to enjoy this place (and they have kept their quality up over the years...as opposed to, say, Shinsengumi) but it was never something that I craved or was amazed with, and now thanx to the newly-established hip factor of J-Town on general (which I welcome wholeheartedly) the joint is WAY too crowded and NOT worth the wait. If I want ramen in this hood i'd much rather hit Orochon in weller court, or even Tokyo Cafe (on San pedro/judge John aiso btwn 1st and Temple) which is only open for the lunchtime but their ramen is one of the few shoyu (soy sauce based) ramen that I like in Cali.

Been to Daikokuya more than 10 times since living in LA.   I am a Ramen lover.  Daikokuya is heaven for the ramen lovers out there!   There broth is second to none because its cooked for 24 hours.  And if you like it extra fatty, they have that special order as well!   And the Chao Shao (slab of pork meat) is pretty much the softest chao shao you'll ever have when it comes to ramen.   My friends opened me up to the shredded pork bowl, and the fried rice, and those are pretty dam good too!   My two gripes are the noodles and the wait time.  The noodles, for me, are less than desirable because I love al dente style (just under cooked) of noodles, but they don't have that option.  All the noodles come well done.  The other thing I don't like about the place is that there is a super long wait time.  Since there is no parking lot, except for street parking, good luck finding a spot.  Also, if you do find a spot, that should shave a few minutes from having to wait close to an hour on the weekends, and less than a hour all other times because this place is THAT popular.  But all in all, this is a great place, one i don't mind waiting when I'm craving ramen!

I had the kimchi ramen and I have to say the broth was very savory, good umami.  The accouterments were fresh and crispy. The ramen were well cooked and melded well with broth temperature. Nothing I can really complain about really except it was a hot day in LA in a no A/C restaurant in J town with J pop music blaring in a daze.  It was so hot I could see the sweat coming fromthe caked on foundation of the Japanese waitresses.

You know that feeling when you pull freshly laundered sheets out of the dryer on a rainy night and jump into bed while they are still warm? That is the broth at Daikokuya, only in pork form, delicious delicious pork form. The line in usually about an hour, and everything else on the menu can be ignored, but oh that ramen.

I'm finally popping my yelp cherry so I know it has to be with someone special. Naturally, none other than Daikokuya! Let me just say that I was raised in a muslim family, and you all know how they feel about pork. Although I renounce all religion, the whole pork thing just kind of stuck with me.. not really for religious reasons.. I just feel about it like Samuel L Jackson's character in Pulp Fiction. So it goes a loooooong way when I say I will make an exception for Daikokuya. That broth is just too damn flavorful to pass up! I couldn't tell you about the actual meat though, cause for some reason that I still pick out and drop into someone else's bowl lol (I know I know it makes no sense) but I see them devour it so I'm sure it's just as exceptional as everything else. I also loveee the noodles, thick, absorb the flavor of the broth, great texture and soft but yet not too firm, haven't had better. Orochon, Santouka, or Shinsengumi can't hold a candle to this place, and neither can any other place I've ever had Ramen at. It's impossible.. in fact, it's so good it almost makes me mad cause coming from OC, and it is deeeefinitely worth the drive + the 40 minute wait, but sometimes I just wish I could make a quick trip to pick some up, so if I do, although rarely, but if I do resort to eating Ramen anywhere else, I'm just continuously disappointed. Daikokuya is like that boyfriend that you've had once upon a time, the one that you just keep comparing all other guys to, and no one else quite measures up. Yeah, that's definitely the perfect analogy. Oh, and if you're one of those so called "foodies" that actually rate places and mark a star up or down based on if a restaurant has the perfect balance of feng shui decor and "ambiance" and crap like that, then skip this place and just go somewhere else. I mean yeah sure it's a bonus and we all enjoy a nice fancy shmancy restaurant once in a while, but in the end ALL that's ever mattered is the YUMMAY IN MY TUMMAY! & no one does it better than Daikokuya. Also, I heard not to bother going to the other locations.. they don't quite measure up either.

Phenomenal.  Fitting it being in little Tokyo cause it brings a little bit of Japan into your mouth with each bite.  Super duper authentic ramen house.  Get the Oyaku Don if you don't want soup and you won't be disappointed. This place is not for lazy people as you can expect to stand outside for a while before being seated.  WORTH THE WAIT. Wife got the eel bowl and let me tell you, it was some of the best eel I've ever had though the skin (still on) was a bit too "r-eel" for my taste, I like my eel to not remind me of the fact it was actually an eel at one point and not something I love eating with avocado and sushi rice.  At any rate a little skinning later and tastebud-gasm. Staff is super accommodating and friendly even for us non Japanese speakers.  We brought in our massive Graco stroller and they parked it for us in the back.  Given that this is a very intimate and tight packed joint that was totally appreciated. I'm thankful for my JDM friends for turning me onto this joint as I'll always go back when in town.

This rating is solely for their fried rice, fried spicy tuna roll and gyoza. Yes, I've tried their ramen numerous times but lately I've passed on ordering a bowl. Lately I've been in a funk with their ramen. It could be the warm weather or that I was in a 'deep-fried' state of mind that night or the fact that, dare I say, I'm over it and looking for something more, something better. I'm talking about a broth so flavorful and intense that it makes your mouth salivate because you remember what it tastes like and you can't get enough of it. Their broth is good, their kotteri style uneffinbelievable! I suppose it's been so long I might have forgotten just how "good" it really is. Then again, maybe after a sip from my hubby's bowl will just remind me to just stick with my own order of fried goodness.

Arrived here for the first time directly from LAX.  A late 2:30 Lunch here in Downtown L and was lucky to have metered parking a few feet from the entrance and no wait at this wonderful Ramen restaurant. The energy of this place is perfect: relaxing, casual, yet sincere prompt, and meaningful. I had the Ramen Shredded Pork (Teriyaki Style) Combo which came with a simple yet perfect salad. At the ginger and garlic condiments which complimented the Ramen perfectly added an exclamation point. The environment is vintage japanese a la the 1950s.  Imagine if Planet Hollywood was started in Tokyo post WW2 and became petrified and 50 years later, archaeologists unearthed it and everything came back to life. A very memorable, affordable, quaint establishment.  For those who have issues with long waiting times, play hookey or take a very late lunch break and it's more than tolerable.  Or you could be a tourist like I was where lunch is normally had at off-peak hours.  I bet noon and 7pm times are mad here because of its great quality. Loved this place!

Fresh crunchy noodles, rich broth, moist, tender pork are what makes Daikokuya awesome.  However, what sets them apart from other great  ramen houses are their combos.  They have really good combo rice dishes! If it wasn't for the combos, you would be better off saving some wait time and just going to Santouka.  It doesn't even matter what time of day you show up to this place, there's going to be a wait.  And because there's less than 10 tables in the whole place, the wait is going to be at least 45 minutes.  I suggest going to the little shopping center across the street and picking up some pork buns or something to hold you until you get your hands on the ramen/rice goodness.

Delicious comfort food for a rare, cold Los Angeles day. It is however completely overrated. It's good, but I don't think it's worth the 30 min+ wait that you have to budget into your mealtime every single time you come here. I usually get the chicken/egg bowl and daikoku ramen combo for $11 bc I get sick of just eating ramen. I tell myself I won't eat all of it annnnd then I leave regretting my utter lack of self-control. The waitstaff is really friendly. I'll come back often, because it's delicious and hits the spot, but I don't think it's as amazing or legendary as many seem to think.

There is usually a wait, and a substantial one at that. It's good for you though, since it will give you more room in your tummy for ramen and pork. Get the gyoza. Get the Daikoku ramen. If you're feeling really REALLY hungry, the combos are a great deal (Eel? Tuna? Katsudon? Check!). Get the iced green tea. The first time we ventured to Daikokuya, we were in the process of unpacking all of our worldly possessions at our new home when hunger struck. Time had flown by while unpacking and it was already 9pm. Where the heck are we going to eat now? A little (and I mean very little) research later and we were on our way to Daikokuya. That was the best uninformed decision we'd ever made... We just happened to eat one of the most comforting, delicious, cheap foods ever. Daikoku ramen is my go-to feel better food.

I've had this bookmarked for at least a year. A YEAR!! I was sick at home one day and decided THIS was the day I was going to eat at daikokuya. I got there at 10:55am right before they opened at 11am. There was already another group waiting and at 11:15am there was already a line. WWWHHAAAAA??? On to the food- it was good. Not too salty, not greasy. It wasn't pork-y enough for me though. The pork fat basically melted in your mouth- but only 2 pieces D: It was a good price too for a BIG bowl. I wish they did noodle refills though!

Wow even on a Monday afternoon at 1:30pm there is still a line! The wait time was about 1.5 hours. Seriously ridiculous. I guess I wouldn't expect anything less since there are only 28 seats available. I ordered the Daikoku Ramen ($8.50). The broth was indeed very tasty and the overall dish was well presented with tons of green onion and scallions. The pork was also very tender and flavorful. The ramen itself was ok. I guess it's kinda hard for me to like ramen since I prefer soft and smooth noodles. The egg was slightly undercooked but not like the soft boiled egg at Orenchi Ramen in Santa Clara. Overall, I would come back if I didn't have to wait 1.5 hours. I also wouldn't recommend groups greater than 4 people. Once I try Shin Sen Gumi I think I'll be able to finally determine the best ramen house.

Perhaps the chef wasn't feeling well the day I went and their back-up chef was cooking.  Either way, after ALL the hype on Daikokuya I finally made my way over there to try out their ramen. We went at about 2:30PM on a Saturday and had a bit of difficulty finding parking.  After circling the block a few times, I managed to find a metered spot right in front of the restaurant! One thing about me is, when I'm hungry, you have to feed me almost immediately.  My blood sugar starts to drop, my head hurts, and my Dr. Jekyll side comes out.  We waited for about an hour  and a half before we were seated.  I was SO hungry by this time I could have had one of everything on the menu. I ordered the Daikokuya Ramen with pork over rice combo.  The salad was really delicious thanks to their yummy dressing.  The rest of our food came out really quickly which my stomach was super happy about. The ramen was okay, but I didn't feel like it was THAT much better than any other ramen restaurant I've been to.  The egg was cold, the pork was flavorful and tender, and the bamboo was good.  The broth was average in seasoning and taste. Service was absolutely fantastic and incredibly tentative.  I wish they would expand the restaurant so the wait wouldn't be so insane.  At no point during our meal did the line let up.  I would consider trying Daikokuya again, but perhaps at the Monterey Park location as I've heard the line is way less nutso there.

It's my favorite ramen spot in LA. The ramen is consistently good.  The broth is great and goes well with the egg, noodle, and cha siu (pork). They even make their non-specialty dishes well.  The eel rice and shredded pork rice bowls are awesome.  Both are tender with soft rice. Note:  90% of the time, there's a line, so you've been warned.

Food is delicious here. Very rich and flavorful ramen awaits you once you get in... ..which could take an hour or possibly longer. The deliciousness of the huge bowl you get served here isn't quite enough to make up for the extremely long and I mean long wait time to be seated. It doesn't help that they don't allow you to order take out either. Maybe all of this is to maintain that kind of club scene "look-at-how-many-people-are-waiting-out-in-front-­to-get-inside" kind of thing. All in all, no better ramen out there in LA. Just hope you're young enough to still enjoy it because you'll be waiting a while.  ;)

5 stars for the huge portions 4 stars for the Daikokuya Ramen (very flavorful broth & well braised pork belly). So far, it's the next best and closest joint to Hakata Ramen (yumm). 3 stars for the Gyoza (I always like having dumplings to accompany my ramen noodles, but they make it pretty bland here and not cooked enough). I'll probably try the tempura next time. 2 stars for cramped space---i feel like a packed sardine in there. Plus, it kinda sucks having people eying you (while you eat) to leave for your spot. 1 star for the looooooooong wait!!!

FLAME SUIT ON...  Now, for some reason, I can't really tell the difference THAT much between Ramen places.  They all are different but they all taste pretty similar to me.  From the 58 cent Ichiban packages to Daikokuya, they're all good to me baby.   THERE IS ONE THING...  The one thing that stuck out to me about Daikokuya Ramen is the tenderness of the pork. OH AND ANOTHER THING...  The egg in the broth does stand out in a good way.   ONE MORE THING... This place is definitely a non-summer place to eat.  On a crazy hot summer LA downtown day, and poor AC in the house, the experience would've been better for sure in the winter. UPDATE:  I just had the eel combo and the eel was dEELicious!!!

I for one do not eat ramen that much, Top Ramen was probably the only ramen in my vocabulary.  The only other ramen place I've been to would be Shin Sen Gumi, and that was good. There was a maybe 15 minute wait, I was there maybe at 11pm last night. Not bad. I was extremely hungry and I ordered the ramen combination with the sashimi bowl. The sashimi bowl was good, the rice was sushi rice, it was fairly good. But I am sick, so maybe my taste buds were slightly impaired.  So I wait for the ramen, and it came in this huge bowl.  I don't care if I was sick or not, I know what good tasting food is.  The ramen wasn't too oily and it the soup was just right.  I am not sure if I could have asked for my noodles to be a little bit harder, that's how I like mine. I would come back here again most definitely, I decided to join yelp just to review this place.

People aren't exaggerating when they say the ramen here is good. I went to my first daikokuya in Hawaii and I fell in love and I was happy to find out there was one in little tokyo. I always want to go whenever I visit little tokyo but unfortunately the waiting time is a little long so my friends usually want to go somewhere preferably with no waiting time. I remember waiting at least 30 mins to get seated. However, the best part is that when you're done ordering, the food comes out pretty quickly. I always order the combo set which includes the ramen and your choice of some side dish. I prefer the pork rice or the salmon roe rice bowl. THEY ARE SO GOOD! However, the combo is always too big for me so I always end up taking it home. I totally think this is one of those ramen places that you NEED to try if you like ramen (of course) so I totally recommend it! peace! =)

I've never been to a ramen place in my life, so I had no prior expectations when consuming this food. It wasn't totally knock-my-socks-off, but you surely won't be disappointed. We went on a Saturday night and it was packed. Waiting list to the max, about 30 mins to 1 hr long. My gf and I were easily disheartened and thought any other ramen place within 100 feet could appease our appetite, but our friends said that this place was worth the wait. We got seated and the waiters were quick to act. Beverages? BAM. Dinnerware? BAM. Take our orders? BAM. Order turn-around time? B-- eh, not so bam. We waited a while for our orders, but that meant the food was gonna be scrumptious, no? I ordered a combo: BBQ eel and beef ramen. I'm not sure how eel is supposed to be cooked, but I guess my American palette was anticipating a crispier-textured BBQ eel. HOWEVER, when I ate the eel, that sucka melted in my mouth. It was good. I mean REAL GOOD. The ramen? Fatty-ass bowl, lemme tell you. I can't believe that was a combo. Now when you first have a couple spoonfuls you'll ask yourself, "Hmm, this isn't as clear as miso soup" and "What's that subtle flavor?" Turns out that subtlety is "back fat" as my friend so eloquently put it. All that fat from the pig-meat and bacon integrated into the soup is tasty, but I could definitely feel my heart clogging up. (When I took home the leftover soup, the next day I found about a half-inch layer of solidified fat in the to-go container. Ta-da!) The ramen itself? Cooked a little al-dente by my standards. But over all good ramen. Don't know if other ramen places blow Daikokuya outta the water, but er'one needs to try this place at least once.

My wonderful night at Daikokuya: Headed over around 7:30pm on a Sunday night, without knowing exactly where it was.  Finally found the place and pulled into the open spot right in front of the restaurant (which was free because it was Sunday.) Put my name down on the list and not ten minutes later one of the busy waitresses closed the place down.  She turned the "open" sign to "closed" and even pocketed the list!   Ten minutes after that I had a cozy seat on the counter right in front of the ginormous vats of pork-licious liquid. The very nice waitress took my order of a ramen with a side of fried rice and an iced tea to counteract the salt I was expecting in the ramen. Results? No tea needed.  I took about three sips of it.  The broth was NOT overly salty.  The depth of flavor of this Daikokuya ramen was better than any ramen I've had in my last two years of ramen ventures.  It had the perfect amount of noodles, a perfectly soft-boiled marinated egg, and deliciously crunchy bamboo.  The fried rice was also one of the best I've ever had.  In fact, I placed a second order to take home with me.   My only not-so-great comment is about all the fat on the chashu.  However, my feelings are probably due more to my mood that night than the quality of the meat itself.  The chashu melted in your mouth, but that night I didn't appreciate the fatty texture. In all, I can't wait to go back.  It's like the ramen of my dreams.  As I was lapping it up, I couldn't help but think, "If this is ramen in Little Tokyo, how much better is the real thing in Tokyo???"  The thought that it could actually get any better is mind boggling!

i was in LA in late June for a music festival (yes.. THAT one..) and my girlfriend was like "oh, our hotel is near Daikokuya!" and the rest is history. The Bay Area doesn't really have much in the way of ramen. Sure we have our Manpuku's and our Katana-ya's, but THIS place blew 'em out of the water. I sat bar side and actually watched the noodles getting prepared. I had their daikoku ramen and goodness gracious was it delicious. the broth was perfect and the noodles were so so so fresh. For some reason, I always think of (and LOVE) the boiled egg thats in it; I really don't know why. The pork.. was just so fatty in the greatest way possible. So much flavor and so much fat just dripping off that bad boy.. It actually gave me some really bad bathroom trips, but I really don't care. I would go to the store and stock up on doo-doo paper if it means I get to eat there more often. love it. and yes, there's a line that forms during opening and for good reason.

Arrive early, sign in, then shop the japanese marketplace while waiting.  Parties of 2 or fewer are ideal.  If you're coming in a group, expect a long wait.  Ride the Gold Line to avoid parking inconveniences. Okay, the Ramen was good and the portions were huge.  But boy, that pork belly rice bowl is manna from the heavens!  The rice was cooked just right, the flavor of the hot pork and the syrupy fat-sauce mix just leaked itself all down the bowl.  It may be the most delicious thing I've ever eaten. Sharing is a good thing.  I'm a big eater (read: I'm fat).  I thought I could take down a combo on my own and split the pork belly rice bowl.  After finishing my ramen which was absolutely delicious, I proceeded to consume half of the pork belly rice and left my mini bowl for takeaways.  My eyes were surely bigger than my stomach.  And I was certainly mistaken! No orders for takeout but you can pack a box to-go if you can't finish it.

Love, love, LOVE this place. I never miss a chance to stop by. Ask for the koteri, you won't regret it. The extra fat brings an amazing richness to the broth and leaves a fatty coating on your lips like eating good roast duck/pork. Daikokuya and Santouka are definitely my two favorite ramen houses in socal.

If you want spicy over-the-top ramen, go down the street to Orochan.  If you want great tasting Japanese-style ramen, come here. Even though they're known for their ramen, the shredded pork bowl is money too.  I usually get the shredded pork bowl/ramen combo and get the best of both worlds.  It does cost about $14 but it's well worth it in my book.  Plus, the ramen is full-size, but the pork bowl is half-size so you can take it home.  Regardless of what you order, you do get the Japanese-style salad/cole slaw. Now, as you can tell, this place gets quite busy.  If you ever drive down J-Town on 1st street at night and see a HUGE line going out the door, it's this place.  Friday and Saturday nights, expect to wait AT LEAST 30 minutes, maybe up to an hour.  If you come on the weekdays around 4pm, less crowded.  Maybe a 5 minute wait.  But, remember, even if your name is called, the entire party has to be present to be seated.  Do not go with a party over 4 as their booths can only seat up to 4. If you really want Daikokuya, but can't hack the wait, go to the one in Monterey Park.  It's off Atlantic, south of the 10 freeway.  Same food, just different location.  It's literally only a 10 minute drive on the freeway, when there's no traffic. What I found disheartening about the J-Town location is that they recently went "CASH ONLY".  I was there 8/8/11 and it was cash only.  A little disappointed since I rarely carry cash, however, the food is good enough, where I'll make the quick atm run just to get my fix.

Daikokuya is legendary among ramen patrons. The hype for this place is off the scale. I ordered the ramen with the pork cutlet and hard boiled egg. "It was the greatest soup I'd ever tasted..." I so wanted that to be true. The more I paid attention to the flavor rather than the peer pressure, it was just sort of, "eh." It came as a shock, but stock made from boiling bones all day tastes like, well, bones. It's not a meaty flavor; just sorta earthy and marrowy. It was just missing a sort of snap. This place is OK, just not the end all and be all. UPDATE! I'm taking another point off this place for the hipsters that overflow from its doors onto the sidewalk. Management should have taken to them with a broom before they started to nest.

I have to admit that I am not a huge fan of ramen or pho. It's just not my taste, but this place is pretty good and cheap if that's what you are looking for. I have tried the Daikokuya Ramen and the tuna sashimi and while I loved the sashimi, the ramen did nothing to change my mind. The pork was pretty tasty! Be warned that this place is always packed (even at 10:00 on a Monday night) and parking in the area just sucks at any time of the day or night. Service was pretty good. I got kind of annoyed that even though there were 2 open spots at the bar, my friend and I could not be seated as some girl had decided that her LV purse was worthy of its own bar stool. Grrrrr!!!!! (although not entirely the restaurant's fault).

Came here on a rainy day and it was never more perfect. The smallish dining area warmed me up on the outside; and the ramen, with a great broth (rich, hot, and not too salty), kept me warm on the inside. We also ordered the tempura. And saw a small roach running along the wall. But let's not throw up our arms yet. I mean, it's a restaurant in downtown LA. The ramen is still good. It's a good craving food on a cold, wet day.

A little hot spot in J-town LA. Its a small place, meaning there is a long wait to get some ramen up in this place. During the peak times your wait could be 30+ mins. But every time I eat here my stomach gets satisfied, so there is a trade off there. Overall, this is a spot to try out if your looking for some Ramen in LA and have time to wait for a table. ;)

After reading the stellar reviews of this place (and as a Hawaii transplant who sometimes cravessssss ramen), I was really excited to try this place. To begin, I was a little disappointed that they only had the one kind of ramen--the Daikokuya ramen. The description on the menu made it sound like there were alot of flavors going on (i.e. egg, broth cooked overnight with beef bones, etc.), but I decided to go with it since that was what everyone recommended. Well, there were, in fact, a lot of flavors at play, and both my and my boyfriend's stomachs were none too happy about it. I felt pretty sick almost as soon as I stopped eating. So, if you have even a semi-delicate stomach, you might want to think twice about the Daikokuya ramen.  I much preferred the ramen of next door Mr. Ramen. That being said, I ordered a salad before my ramen, which I really enjoyed because of the tasty dressing. The salad was simple but I tend to be of the mind that, if a restaurant can do simple things really well, they must be good. Because of this (and the great service from helpful and sweet Japanese women), I'd go back and try something other than the ramen.

After being a loyal Orochon fan, I've decided to put Daikokuya Ramen to the test. Some dare to claim that Daikokuya is better than Orochon. My taste buds needed proof. So I set out today with my food buddy Aaron to see what all the hype was about. At first I got really frustrated trying to look for parking. I decided to park in the structure (cost me $6 bucks...grrrrrrrr...this ramen better be worth it). Walked inside and sat at the bar. As soon as I sat down, I saw a menu with a picture of the infamous Daikoku Ramen. It looked like ramen in beef broth soup. We were seated right next to the fryer so my pores began to open up, releasing the last drops of my sweat. As I waited, I decided to read the description of my soon-to-be ramen lover. The soup base is made out of pork bones and they cook it for a whole day. Then they add this egg that has been sitting in soy sauce all day mixed with onions, bamboo shoots and ur basic ramen noodle. Finally the cook brought over my lover. My first bite: hmmmm interesting. My second bite: ooOOooo not bad. My third bite: O GAWD NOOOOO! Am I cheating on my first love Orochon?!?!?! Fourth bite: slurpppppppp. *downing soup*. *ten minutes later* WOW! That seriously hit the spot! Orochon who? Seriously, I really can't compare the two. Both are unique in its own way. How can you compare a spicy ramen with a ramen with day old pork bone soup? They're in two totally different categories. MY VERDICT: DRAW I have YET to eat at another place that will top these two lovers of mine. Orochon, do you mind the threesome? I think not! There's always room for two in my cheating stomach  :)

Wow! Never have I been so disappointed by Daikokuya.  Today I am deeply saddened that one of my favorite LA places to have lunch was not even on par.  First off, my ramen bowl was lukewarm at best and secondly, no one wants to chew into eggshells when they're downing their ramen!!  So sad.  Oh so sad. Daikokuya, I know you guys are busy and there are always those hungry customers standing and staring you guys down and looking angry because they have to wait but that's no reason for you guys to get sloppy.  I deserve better and you can deliver better. I know it! I've seen you do it!  So please, next time I come, do me right and give me the great ramen I've come to expect from you guys.           Your fan (at least still a fan for now), Derek T

I tried out Little Tokyo's Daikokuya on a Thursday night, after a long wait to even get inside, not to mention get served. The waiters are attentive and pretty nice and the place was packed at 10 pm. As for the food, I ordered a chicken teri bowl, which comes with miso soup and salad. The miso soup was a little too salty for my liking but the salad was decent. As for the chicken teriyaki bowl, it was a generous serving of finger-licking good chicken and a ton of rice to complement it. I was famished by the time I ordered so my recollection may be biased. My friend got the Daikoku ramen (one of the specialties), which was tasty as well. In short, I think the place has decent tasty food but I honestly don't think it's worth a long wait. Maybe ramen joints just don't do it for me.

***Restaurant*** Tiny little joint with a few booths, a spattering of tables, and the counter (my favorite choice for seating...love watching them cook while I wait), which explains the crazy ass crowd outside waiting for a seat.  I've been going here long enough to know when to come back after I put my name on the list, so the hour+ long waits don't really affect me much.  Street parking is tough, but several lots in Little Tokyo if you don't mind paying. ***Food*** -- Daikokuya Ramen (tonkotsu broth):  This is it peeps..they only do one kinda ramen, and by the gods they do it damned right!  When you throw a buncha pork bones into a broth that gets rendered down to a fraction of what it began at after hours of simmering, you got some seriously concentrated TLC in dat bleepity bleep!  At times, the noodles could be a bit more al dente, but I'm usually blinded and distracted by the soup base.  The chashu pork slices, seasoned boiled egg, green onions are all great fixin's...not a fan of bamboo shoots tho.   -- Gyoza:  Aside from the non-traditional way of folding the wrappers, they're fairly standard in the taste category.   -- Fried Rice:  lotsa flavor...kinda peppery...got the idea of adding a splash of vinegar into my fried rice after watching them cook this -- Pork Cutlet Bowl (tonkatsu donburi):  if you're hungry, do the ramen combo with one of these bad boys!  Pork is lean and lightly breaded and suspended in an island of egg and onions, and the soy-based sauce/broth is fairly balanced (not too sweet, not too salty).  All of this over a steaming bowl of fluffy rice?  What more you want? -- Tuna Sashimi Bowl:  had it once...sashimi was dry and not quite fresh...skip... ***Service*** Despite the hungry mob outside almost every night of the damned week, the people who work here keep things moving, are cordial, and, surprisingly, keeps their cool. ***Summary*** Lived in SF Bay Area and now LA, and I'll venture to say that you can't find a better bowl of tonkotsu ramen in the state of CA.  Beats pretty much all the "pay the vending machine first" joints in Kyoto and Shinjuku (Tokyo) that I've been to for that matter!

Where do I start from here.  This place doesn't need another review but it doesn't hurt to do one.   I'm a ramen addict.  I've been there four consecutive Mondays.  I just took my friend there yesterday and yes she loves the place.   My husband and I were scrolling down in Little Tokyo 8 months ago looking for a good ramen place, a guy that worked across the street introduced us to this place.  I fell in love with this place and secretly have been going there without my husband almost every time I'm in LA to do my garments shopping.   My one and only thing I order is their famous Daikokuya ramen noodle.  I love the pork belly slices and the half -cooked boil egg along with their murky and flavorful broth that I can't seemed to get enough of it.  I always order extra pork belly and egg and still manage to finish everything.   The 2 downfalls about this place are the line and the parking.  I always have to circle the street a few times before finding parking.  Although, you can park across the street for $6 and save yourself time. Daikokuya is the only place I go for ramen noodle.  I love you for your excellent noodle and quick food once you're seated.   I'll be there soon.  See you in 2 weeks.

Hmm, for some reason my mouth is watering while thinking about this place, even though I didn't walk out thinking it was that great. They must have smuggled something into my soup. AMBIENCE: I came in here at either 3:40 or 4:30 on a Thursday afternoon and thus completely avoided the long lines and crowded interior. YAY! The restaurant still seemed a little cramped and stuffy, though. They were blasting Japanese mariachi music or something like that. Interesting! It was like enka with Spanish words (senorita, senorita~~ oh, senorita). FOOD: Got the ramen and fried rice combo which came with a mini salad that was drenched in dressing. I'm not a huge ramen fan but I still have my spontaneous cravings from time to time and I wanted to try this place out. It was okay-good. (Okay fine, I guess it was pretty good). The broth had a really rich flavor that was nice and creamy the way I like it. I love that they dump in a huge amount of green onion into the ramen. Mmmm...and there's nothing better than a hanjuku tamago (soft-boiled egg) sitting on top of your piping hot noodles. Can't get away from that stuff. The fried rice was piping hot (burned my mouth!) and yummy!! A little greasy, though~ I probably would have loved this place if I hadn't come in on such an unforgivingly hot day. Nonetheless, I still thought it was pretty good. I walked out of here angry-full. That's when you're so full you get angry. But I was happy. Happy but angry-full. Does that make sense?Ok, good. Then I got dessert. XD

Oh I don't know. This place has been hyped up many times by so many friends so last night, we decided to brave the very long line (What?! 17 parties before us??) There must be something in this if there are always long lines outside Daikokuya... Oh my goodness, the bowl was huge and the pork belly chashu was very soft and tasty. I ordered the combo with teriyaki eel... this was a ton of food for one person. Giant bowl of ramen + big bowl of eel on rice = quantitiy of three meals. Does anyone ever finish their entire combo meal? In summary, yes, it was good food,  but I don't know if it was amazing enough to wait 1 hour in line for, when the ramen at Korakou hits the same spot. Or Chin Ma Ya's tan tan mien.... with NO WAIT TIME. P.S. Watch out for the slippery pork-fat-coated floor.

Delicious ramen, probably one of the best in LA area, however you must wait very very very long.  Go off time, avoid lunch time and dinner time. If you go during peak time remember you will wait, and wait long, bring your running shoes you can probably run a couple laps around J-Town and get your daily excercise in while you wait. It is a little hole in the wall but very authentically set up inside.  If your super indecisive like I am, get the two combination, a RAMEN+another dish, I usually get the Shredded pork bowl.  I usually have to take things to go because I rarely finish. Its a lot of food.

We came at the right time, around 11:30am on Saturday so we only had to wait for 30 minutes. there were 5 of us which made us had to squeeze in the booth. this place is not recommended for large group due to their tiny place. we ordered: bento box: chicken teriyaki - bland tempura - light crunchy. very good the ramen - great great great broth! very flavorful! the pork slice also delicious. unfortunately the noodle itself was not so flavorful. too bad.. okay.. now I'm going to share the highlight of the day: THE EEL BOWL. to die for! huge pieces of eels! so soft and fatty!

So - I've been sort of spoiled with ramen from Japan - I keep trying to find different places to go to have that same creamy pork broth but haven't found it anywhere! However, after about an hour wait at Daikokuya in the Little Tokyo location it came pretty close. I had their Daikokuya ramen kotteri style (the extra pork fat that they boiled and left over is added into the already creamy broth).  The pieces of pork were so rich they literally melted in your mouth. Although I love eating I can't eat a lot (the ramen bowl is huge) so if you're thinking about getting a combination I would recommend having at least 2 mouths ready (half of my friends who ordered combos ended up taking some home). ps as with many authentic ramen style places their hard boiled egg is cooked to a perfection!! The yolk is at a perfect happy place :) visit my food blog at http://www.cocoandcoffee…!

I am a noodle fanatic.  I knew that I had to find a fabulous bowl of noodles while I was on a business trip in LA.  I scoured Yelp, looking for the best noodle house I could find. I'll agree with the other reviews, the wait was long (but well worth it).  I half contemplated walking down to the Japanese confectionary store, Fugetsu-do, to snack on some Mochi.   Once I was seated, service was quick and efficient.  I read their blurb about their Ramen broth... ohhh "made in an un-disclosed location"... how intriguing.  I knew that I wanted ramen (that was a given), but what to have with it...  I flipped to the last page of the menu and saw their combinations.  "Wait," I thought to myself, "I can have Ramen AND sashimi??"  **Heaven** The shredded cabbage salad was awesome.  It had an onion/mayo dressing, kind of like a Japanese coleslaw.  The main event came out, a steamy bowl of yummy goodness.  The pork was fatty, tender and melted in my mouth.  Normally I pull the fat off of my meat and leave it in a pile on the side of my plate, this fat was different.  The marinated egg was awesome, the yoke was still a deep yellow, giving it a richer eggy taste and texture.  The noodles were firm, just the way I like them.  The broth was unctuous and flavorful, everything you want Ramen broth to be. My sashimi came out and I wondered how I was going to eat everything.  As my last few bites approached, I looked to the right and left of me and wondered if my eating neighbors would think that I was a complete pig for finishing EVERYTHING.  Oh well, who are they to judge ;)

If you're a ramen lover, and live in LA, this a must go. The place is a small joint, with a few tables (5-6 tables) and some bar seating (about  10 spots). Even going at 8pm on a Wednesday night, the place had a waiting line, but it wasn't too long. My friend and I waited about 15 minutes to get a table, sat down, and we knew what we wanted already. We had to try the Daikokuya Special ramen (go to their site http://www.daikoku-ten.c… to check out what's in it). With beers at the ready, we dove into the ramen after it came about 8-10 minutes later. It was the tastiest ramen I've had, and this is coming from someone who went to more than a few ramen joints in Japan. I added some red pepper to give it some kick, but personally it didn't really need more than that. Service there was ample, the two waitresses hustling as fast as they could to all the needy guests. Considering how many people were there vs. them, they were still pretty attentive. The atmosphere is very casual and pleasant. My friend and I sat and talked there for awhile even after we were done, downing a couple more tall Asahi's in the process. In the end, if you want some of the best ramen in LA, hit this place up. The only downside is the wait (the place can get very busy), but beyond that, go.

Ive actually been around j-town quite a bit trying different ramen places, some to go for ramen and some for a night of drinking. this was my first time at daikokuya and i was disappointed at first. i open the menu to see that they only have one kind of ramen. the others that i have been to have had different types, even with different grades of spicyness. i struggled for some moments trying to see if there was some mistake or some combination that would satisfy me less the ramen not meet my standards. then at the moment of order i felt bold and just ordered the ramen. took one bite and i went on a frenzy...the soup was perfect and the hand made ramen noodles were i dare say the best i have ever had. not too much time after i was full and seeking a cigarette to be the perfect end to a perfect meal. -this is a place one must DEFINITELY visit if youre in the los angeles, downtown area. like everyone says theres always going to be a line but it moves quickly and is well worth the wait. must go again.

I expected this restaurant to be my little ramen restaurant, but seeing that this place has almost 500 reviews on yelp... definitely makes it more well known than I thought. I guess it definitely deserves the fame. The restaurant is located in Little Tokyo and is decorated with cheesy 1950s Japenese-American memorabilia. Literally, a hole in the wall, it seats less than 30 ppl. During lunch time, the line is usually out the door. I'm a noodle soup kinda gal. I love all and any type of noodle soups. What I love about the ramen here, are the noodles. The fresh ramen noodles are firm and chewy, just the way I like it. The scant pieces of pork that comes with the Daikokuya ramen is nothing to write about. But the broth is flavorful and opaque, and comes with a generous helping of green onions. The lunch combo with ramen and various don (rice bowl) are a great deal. Funny story, the last time I went, the food inspector with his clipboard and badge happened to be evaluating the place. I was standing in the front waiting for a seat, and I peered out the front door and noticed that this establishment was rated a "C." Ironically, the sign also happened to have a small dead cockroach embedded between the paper and glass door. Gross. As the inspector was leaving, one of the workers (could be the manager or owner) happily, almost in a sashay, walked briskly to front door. He ripped it off the old grade (God knows where that cockroach flew off to) and promptly replaced it with a new "B" grade sign. I still ate there and it didn't kill me. The reason why I didn't give it a 5 stars was because I don't like the other food items on the menu (that, and see the story above). Stick to the ramen, trust me. Daikokuya is a great place to burn your tongue (no joke, happens to me everytime) and slurp up some hot, tasty ramen on cold days.

Okay first off I've eaten probably a gazillion bowls of ramen in my lifetime, from cup o noodles, to my grammas home made. I love their noodles, and especially love to watch the entire creative process (if you sit at the counter) how they boil and drain the noodles, and how they slap it all together and serve it to you piping hot. Oishi! Add a bowl of rice and gyozas and well it is the shitz. Back to the ramen, I'm so low brow (cup o noodles) that my tastebuds really don't scream at me with nirvana. Therefore the 4 stars. What I hate is the wait and the hipsters and dipshits. Me included.

My FAVVVVV spot in LA for ramen!! JAPANESE RAMEN NEVER TASTED THIS GOOD! The craz-AY line out the door proves the food is worth the wait. I usually wait about 45 minutes to an hour... but seriously.. the noodles and broth is soooo bomb. I order the ramen and add kotteri which acts like a mega flavor boost to your experience. The garlic is on the side of the table where you can freely dump your servings into the broth. I choose about 2 scoops. I know.... I love garlic. The ramen portion is pretty large and can be split among two people. I have never yet to finish a bowl to myself... ever. The ramen and bowl option is pretty good too. I usually order the unagi bowl but i've heard good things about the salmon roe bowl and shredded pork bowl. GREAT value for its price!!! The gyoza and spicy tuna rolls are a delicious starter too but not needed bc the ramen (once again) is hugeeeeee!! Sure the parking situation sucks, and if you get there at a bad time the wait is horrendous, but that's expected for greatness no?

I am on a ramen-craze. All ramen, all the time. A girlfriend of mine knew I was craving for some and wanted to take me to her favorite spot. We arrived around 8p and waited about a half hour, not too bad. It's a tiny spot, very cute, great staff. The ramen was good, don't get me wrong. The noodles were good. I love their hard boiled soft egg. Their salad was amazing. But the broth wasn't as flavorful as I hoped it would be. And we all know when it comes to ramen, it's ALL about the broth. The portion was phenomenal. I'm not in love with Daikokuya, but I like it.

I am doing what I hate and judging this place not for the food, and for the hassle of getting it.  I personally hate places that do not have parking lots and generally just hard to get to, but never have I judged a restaurant on this fact until now.  at least 2 dollars an hour for street meters, and questionable rates for parking garages in the vicinity.  To top it off, at peak hours you will wait at least an hour just to get seated, so you are paying....to wait. Aside from all the externalities and bullshit, The ramen is fucking amazing.   The roast pork is fucking amazing. The fried tuna is fucking amazing. The soup is fucking amazing. Their food....is fucking.....amazing. Don't want to, but have to compare to Shinsengumi.  It is just a different noodle, soups are both great, but 3 reasons why I would choose Shinsengumi's over Daikokuya, 1. You can customize your bowl 2. Extra noodles for 1 dollar 3. Usually wait is no where nearly as bad as Little Tokyo at any given shinsengumi hakata ramen location last note: don't be a bitch, get the Kotteri.

Best Ramen I've ever had! Daikokuya whoops every other ramen shop out there! Melt in your mouth pork! Soft cooked egg! Broth so rich it's like it's imported straight off from Japan! There's always a wait everytime I come here, but totally worth it. This is one of the most amazing food experiences I'll never forget.

In the heart of Little Tokyo -- you'll find this wonderful little ramen spot called Daikokuya.  The lines are always long but definitely worth the wait! So, if you are in a rush -- this may not be the best place to go. I was introduced to this place by fellow foodies and immediately fell in love.  The noodles are cooked to perfection, the broth's seasoning is quite a tasty blend and the sliced pork just melts in your mouth. Quick tip: their portions are pretty hefty and if you are not a big eater -- order a half size! And try their yummy gyozas and rice with pork too! Happy eating! =)

Daikokuya must be really lucky that i still give em 3 stars and not lower. i drove all the way up to LA from SD just to eat here and orochon. i call it "the journey for great ramen".... omg maybe i'm wrong for putting my expectation that high? we had to wait for about 40 minutes outside the restaurant for seating. which i don't mind at all as long as the food tastes good. after we were seated, we ordered the combo with unagi bowl, then this order of pork meat with green onion as appetizer. about the ramen, since we were going to taste orochon afterwards, i tried to order the large portioned ramen to share with my girlfriend, turns out that they don't allow it there. and since i ordered it as "a combo" i can't downsize it either. so we ended up ordering another small portion of ramen for my girlfriend THINKING THAT THE RAMEN WOULD BE GREAT AND WON'T BE ENOUGH FOR BOTH OF US. oh yea, we ordered that thingy broth. the one from pork back fat. the unagi bowl came out delicious. it's a lil bit smelly but whatever, i like it. and the pork meat, wow. even though it's pan fried (unlike advertised as grilled) it's one of the best tasting appetizer that i ever had. since we sat on the bar, we saw that our ramen was coming. they chef threw a large amount of green onion, that really excites us. the first time i tasted the soup, i was like WTF MAN right away. then i looked at my girlfriend which turned out to have the same expression with me. it's virtually tasteless. and that pork fat thingy. it's just hallucination or probably placebo that daikokuya tries to convince us. it was that tasteless that i opened the salt bottle and poured it to give it a salty taste (you know that you should give some dash rather than opening the bottle and throw the salt to your food) we ended up not finishing the ramen at all. i feel bad for the portion that my girlfriend ordered, barely touched at all. so yeah, we drove 2 hours to daikokuya for it's high rated ramen. turns out to be very2 over rated. given the chance to just rate the ramen, i would give one star only. but wait, turns out orochon sucks even more, probably 2 stars then... but then, the unaju and appetizer tastes good. so yea... 3 stars

Been here about a handful of times already and I still dream about the broth from this place...mmm nom nom. The serving of ramen is huge and I always leave about 5 pounds heavier, which causes me to warn myself that the next time, I will just share with a friend & not order a combo (I've tried tuna sashimi, pork cutlet, teri chicken, and eel-- all so good!!) but guess what? That never happens... Yes, waiting can be a drag, but well worth the wait. Servers are always friendly and to add, I'm not a huge fan of gyoza but Daikokuya's version is pretty yumamazing!!

Came here on a Saturday night, and of course, to no one's surprise, waited an hour and a half before my group of friends got a table. Ordered the combo that had the salad, pork cutlet with rice, and bowl of ramen. The pork katsu was just okay, because the pork was soggy and a little dry for me, but the sauce on top was good. Though I wish I didn't get it, because by the time I got around to the ramen, either my taste buds had adjusted or the soup wasn't as amazing as I expected, because it seemed bland and not as thick as others have said. There wasn't that many slices of pork, which were thin to begin with, and I thought the soup could have used more seasoning, but the egg was delicious. This may sound funny, but the most memorable thing about it wasn't the ramen, but the salad...specifically the dressing. As funny as it sounds, I don't know what they put in that dressing but it makes a bowl of plain old shredded cabbage that I wouldn't even eat with ranch dressing taste so delicious, I would come back just to have it again.

Better then Orochon We to try the place with my girlfriend, it's small and on the side of the street, it's easy to miss. The place was crowded, there was a four or five names on the miss but we got in fairly quickly.  The restaurant is tight and small so not good for big groups. The food was simple and AWESOME.  The portions are big.  Everything was just right.  I noticed the temperature was perfect.  It wasn't lip burning hot, I dove right into it. A must try!

so damn good! I will fully admit that I would never consider myself a ramen expert, but I'm thrilled to have cut my teeth at what I understand to be one of the best. Long wait, but--eh, what are you going to do.  If I could remember the name of the bar 3 doors down (anyone? it's to the right if you're facing the restaurant)--that bartender is my favorite! Spent the wait with friends drinking sake and making a hilarious new friend--It's rushed in there and I don't love the ambiance (thus the 3) but the food is to die for and the experience (what with being so close to my favorite new barkeep--I mean that bar gets 5 stars in my opinion) was excellent

Hands down, THE BEST RAMEN IN L.A. So good. Ramen texture is just right, not too soft, but not to chewy, either. The broth is what sets it apart, though. So rich in pork flavor. If you're really hungry, get the combo, which comes with a Daikoku ramen and a small bowl of rice dish of your choice. I recommend the katsu combo. There are two drawbacks to this place, though, which is why I took off a star. First of all, parking is a pain. You are lucky if you can find street parking out in front. Otherwise, you're going to have to pay for parking in one of the many lots around the area. Secondly, seating is a pain cuz it's such a small restaurant, and there is usually a long line of people waiting. So the last couple of times that I've gone here, I've just gone by myself so that I can just sit and eat like a ninja at the bar area. Usually, they can squeeze me in if I'm by myself. But besides those two points, if you like ramen or noodles in general, you must check out this place. So good.

Apparently Daikokuya is the place to be on Thursday nights in Little Tokyo.  The place was packed.  Good thing the Japanese shop next door contains enough S&M/goth/Lolita costumes to occupy the hordes of hungry ramen-seekers waiting for a seat. I shared the gyoza and fatty pork ramen + pork cutlet combo with another person.  The broth of the ramen was richer and heavier than I'm used to; I tend to like it lighter, but it's a matter of personal preference.  The texture and flavor of the ramen were delicious, especially with a little bit of hot pepper.  The pork cutlet with rice was also very good.  Portions were huge; we couldn't finish the combo between the two of us. All in all, I think Daikokuya's ramen deserves its copious accolades.  Come extra hungry and be prepared for a long wait.

Despite the long wait and despite being skipped over on the list, the food was great and that's what matters.  The ramen was so freaking good, I drool thinking about it even now.  Portland really needs to step up their game, they have nothing that comes remotely close. I love the fact that they offered combination options  so that you could try a variety of other things along with your ramen. The fried rice was delicious but a little greasy for my liking, and the teriyaki eel bowl was also great.   Definitely worth paying another 250 ticket to come back to LA to have this again!

The best ramen you can get in SoCal. I go only for the Daikokuya Miso Ramen, which is utterly delicious. Yes, the bowl is huge, so if you don't think you can finish it, ask for a half! The food is absolutely amazing and worth the wait. Now, the downsides. The place is small. More often than not, you will be stuck sitting at the bar. The air ventilation has improved slightly since last summer (they didn't have air conditioning!) but it gets cramped and hot anyway. The wait is usually fairly long, and if you go look at other stores in the area, you might miss the call for your name. The last thing is that it's cash only. I always forget this, and end up have to get spotted by my friend and paying them back later, or drawing money from a non-bank ATM and having to pay the ATM fee. But even with those downsides, the ramen makes it all worth it.

Get your hands back up folks, this is not the best Ramen joint "hands down."   The food is good we had the Ramen, Gyoza, Fried Spicy Tuna appetizer and fried rice. The Ramen broth is good, but there is no selection, you get what they make and thats all there is to it.  If you aren't a fan of pork belly, I'm sure you can ask for them not to put it in, but I would have liked more of a selection of different types of ramen.  But hey this is what they do and a lot of people love it, so whatever.  I thought it was good not great. The Gyoza were AMAZING, for us this was the gem of the meal.  So fresh and well flavored. The Fried Spicy Tuna in Shiso Leaf was good, but I was surprised that it wasn't very spicy at all.   It was practically bland...unitl you add the salt that they serve with it.  Once I had discovered this was how you were supposed to eat it I was much happier.  But still just good for no zing on the Spicy Tuna. The Fried Rice I thought was really good my wife thought it was just okay.  Never had corn in my fried rice before I don't think but I liked it. Love the Decor, waited an hour to be seated but was expecting that so overall a good experience and might go back if not for the drive to downtown, the hour long wait, and preferring Ramen Nippon in Reseda which is much closer. NO HIGHCHAIRS FOR THE KID, thought that was odd, for a place that has an hour wait to not have a highchair or two in the back.

Everyone should at least TRY Daikokuya once.  If you don't like it much - nothing lost.  More likely you will crave it at least once a week for the rest of your life.  There is usually a wait, but it only makes the ramen that much better when you finally faceplant in its buttery-beige-goodness. Good gyoza too, buried in green onions.  Geez, it's 11pm and having written this review I'm tempted to hop in my car and head to JTown...

Ate here once before several years ago since their Ramen was delicious from what I recalled. Returned only to find the restaurant VERY DIRTY :( Almost scary dirty for a restaurant is concerned. While waiting for a table, I walked to the restroom and the floor was very slippery wet to walk on. Kind of like it had a thin film of grease when you walked making it very unstable where you had to walk carefully or end up on your butt. Upon reaching the men's restroom, it was disgusting as you didn't want to touch anything in  the restroom. :( Well, upon making my way back outside to wait until our table was called, my wife pointed out to me Daikokuya's "B" Health Department Food Rating posted on their door. Well, that was enough for me as we didn't wait for our table to be called. I decided my gut feeling about the cleanliness of this place, combined with the health department's sanitary rating of their last inspection was enough to change my mind about having Ramen that night. Its too bad as I remembered this place having GREAT Ramen Noodle Soup. It may still have it... There was a 30 minute wait for a table with many customers waiting to be seated. It obviously hasn't stopped the masses from dining there. Call me chicken! I just know I've seen plenty of restaurants that I thought were unbelievably dirty/unkempt who still had "A" ratings, now for a place to post anything less than that made me suspect...

Everyone's had ramen, right?  Those freeze dried noodles and that little packet of flavorings, remember that?  I know - it wasn't that great.  Don't let that memory keep you from trying Daikokuya's delicious ramen.  This is ramen kicked up a thousand notches.  The broth is very flavorful.  You don't need to add anything to it.  Besides the broth, that you'll want to drink, the noodles are perfectly cooked.  There are also slices of pork, bean sprouts, lots and lots of green onions, and a marinated egg.  I didn't know what to expect from the marinated egg, but it is similar to a hard boiled egg that isn't too done in the center.   Daikokuya has great hours.  They are open everyday until like midnight - which is perfect for my late night cravings.  A bowl of ramen is pretty big and you'll definitely get full.  You can also order the combo which is a bowl of ramen with a small teriyaki chicken, beef, or pork bowl on the side.  I also go for the combo w/ shredded pork.  Delish.  The combo also comes with a little cabbage salad.  It's definitely too much food for one person.  But the glutton in me makes me order it every time.   Some people give Daikokuya fewer stars because of the wait.  I think that is ridiculous.  Have you seen the people that work there?  They are seriously busting their ass to get food to your table.  Its not their fault people camp out in the extremely tiny restaurant and hog the tables.  Don't come to Daikokuya hungry because chances are you'll wait an hour before you're seated.

After eating 50% of the ramen places in Little Tokyo, I finally came to Daikokuya. When we first got there, there were at least 8 parties before us. So my friend and I decided to head over to the Japanese Village and get a quick snack before coming back. We came back 20 minutes later and there were still 2 parties before us. So all in all, we waited about 40 minutes. We were seated in the bar (I don't think you really have a choice where you sit). A waitress handed us the menu and came back a minute later to ask for our drinks. Literally within 45 seconds, we had our drinks. Next she came back for our orders. I had the ramen combo with tempura while my friend had the ramen combo with the chicken egg (?) bowl. It was really cool that they used hand held devices to place our orders in. After taking our orders, she returned with a salad. I thought it was coleslaw. But it was really yummy. I only ate 1/3 of it because I was trying to save room for the dinner. About 10 minutes later, we had our food. The orders are huge! I first had a taste of the broth and it was delicious. The pork was extremely tender and the hard-boiled egg was nice. The tempura was quite good too. In the end, I finished my ramen, half the pork, hard-boiled egg and the tempura minus the rice. We were pretty much stuffed. My friend had to take her chicken bowl home because she was so full. Our bill was reasonable, about $30 for 2 people.   Overall, the food was good, the service was good, the wait not so much. But you can't always have your way right? I would go back to Daikokuya again and bring my friends too!

Boyfriend and i shared the combo of ramen and eel over rice, which came with a shredded cabbage salad that had a creamy sauce. It was perfect and cheap!!! About $13/14! Best part was that there was no wait when we went, score! (wasnt rush hour or lunch) Maybe i was really hungry, the flavors just enhanced... Or exploded!!!! I was in love with the rice bowl!!!! Wish my food stayed hotter longer... That would help me eat slower, to enjoy it longer, heehee............ WARNING to non-green eaters! There's LOTS of green onions, (i loved it!) So if you like to pick out your greens, tell them to just skip it. You would be sad to pick all of them out. It was like a ladle full of GREEN ONIONS..... yum! Happy eating!

My introduction to this place was a little odd. Stood for an hour, on a rainy afternoon, being driven crazy by the wonderful smells, knowing that as soon as my name was called I'd probably have to leave. Yup, worked out just like I dreaded. Occasionally I hate my job. Once home I checked Yelp for what I was convinced had to be a little, unknown restaurant and was stunned to discover that it's got 23 times the number of reviews of the Eiffel Tower??!! Yeah that huge, cool, stack o' metal in Paris has been around for 100 years but this steamy little noodle house that came off of the Blade Runner set has 2000 more reviews! There is no other conclusion. I am neither hip nor in the know. I bow my head in shame. Oh.....the food is awesome, try the condiments!

Daikokuya has the BEST ramen in LA (best ramen I've ever head anywhere, but I can't say I've been to Japan...)! I want to give them 10 stars - can I do that? The gyoza are pretty good, but the ramen is the reason to go. You will probably have to wait because it's a tiny place, but it's worth it! Not particularly vegetarian friendly (although my veg friends were able to find something to eat). If you haven't been, you are missing out. Seriously.

Best ramen ever. Best bento box lunch/dinners ever. The quality of food here is excellent and I have nothing bad to say at all. Food prices are a little on the high side, but considering the taste and quality of food, it's all worth it, even for a college student on a budget. The atmosphere is warm and cozy, especially in the winter. Waiting for a table takes a while when it's packed, but the japanese Naruto and Bleach mangas they have make the time go by very quickly. I love the feel of old-Tokyo (kimono/noodle stands/ dango huts/ etc.) here. Would eat here everyday if I could.

With over two thousand reviews already standing, I wouldn't normally take the time to throw my hat into the ring when there are so many hats lying around. However, gyoza is involved here, and that makes this a special circumstance. My boyfriend and I had been planning the Daikokuya expedition since we moved Downtown, and fifteen months later, we finally went. We arrived at 6:45 on a Saturday night expecting a wait, and we absolutely got one. They were at number 23 and we were 47. We did the right thing and headed over to Far Bar and set our iPhone timers. Approximately forty-five minutes and two excellent beers later, we decided to go wait in front of the restaurant, as frequent checks of the list showed about three pairs of people ahead of us. We waited on the sidewalk about another fifteen to twenty minutes, and ended up seated at the bar. No sweat. We got two orders of gyoza (because I am selfish, gyoza is one of my favorite things ever, and there are five per order, and I don't believe in cutting things in half), one large bowl of ramen, and an order of fried rice. I admit I had reservations about the fried rice after reading that it included imitation crab, but reviewers had said good things and I am also a sucker for good fried rice, so whatever. The gyoza were the best I've ever had. I loved the crust. The ponzu sauce was amazing, and the filling was perfectly loaded with pork and veggies. I want these every night forever. I'm so glad that I have experienced these. The soup was absolutely delicious. I pretty much ignored the noodles and slurped the broth, both at the restaurant and later after we got home and then right before bed when we finished off the leftovers. I can't see how anyone could want kotteri when you could just have it as-is. The fried rice was truly fantastic. Nice and greasy, with chunks of pork and the occasional shred of imitation crab that I could live with. I always wish there were more eggs, but I feel that way about all fried rice. It made for epic leftovers later on. I wish we'd had an extra order of gyoza to eat afterwards. Now I know. Having a restaurant like Daikokuya so close to my apartment is a godsend and makes me grateful to live Downtown where I am increasingly finding awesome food options that expand my horizons and enable me to drink while waiting. :D

Loooooooong line but nothing a great bowl of ramen can't fix. I usually prefer spicier ramen like Orochon style but Daikokuya has this deep flavorful broth that one couldn't just resist. As thousands of other yelper vouched for, its simple bowl of ramen is full of flavors, spices, tender meat, and an explosion of yumminess on your tongue. Portion might be rather quite large for some people (including me) so I usually order a combo of ramen and katsudon (a bowl of rice topped with a deep-fried pork cutlet, egg, and condiments) and share it with another person with an appetizer like takoyaki (literally fried or grilled octopus in a popular ball-shaped Japanese dumpling) which is a-m-a-z-i-n-g good!

I've been here a couple of times and the quality of the ramen is to my liking. The ramen is thick and chewy and the broth is very flavorful. It is a little on the pricey side and the line to get in can get beastly at any time of the day. This harkens back to the true ramen shops in Japan because the seating capacity is very tiny. I don't think more than 20 people can be seated at a time.

We eat so much Asian food in LA, it's crazy. My cousin recommended this place because my friend loves ramen. We tried it and it was really good! The bowls are huge so most of us were not able to finish one. Well, none of us were. We all ordered the regular pork ramen. Two of us got the extra flavor option. I didn't. I liked mine a lot. The fatty pieces of pork in the ramen were so good! And their egg was cooked perfectly, with the middle still a little runny. I couldn't finish my whole bowl but so wanted to because it was really good.

When I think of Japanese food, my mind immediately points to the likes of sushi. Sushi was once overrated and now I no longer care for it. Then on a trip to L.A., I was introduced to the world of Japanese ramen--particularly Tonkatsu ramen. How should I put it? If there was a cult for Tonkatsu ramen, then I would join it. I would join it, make it my life, and sacrifice anything and everything for it. I LOVE TONKATSU RAMEN. I think I've become a bit depressed considering I haven't found anything in the Bay Area that comes even CLOSE to Daikokuya's tonkatsu ramen. It isn't salty like the other soup bases, just right in my opinion. The bowl comes out steaming hot with a HEAP of green onions. Why THAT much onions? I will never understand. Either way, I ATE IT WITHIN 5 MINUTES AND IT WAS THE MOST SATISFYING 5 MINUTES OF MY LIFE. I wish i could go back, to those 5 minutes or to daikokuya, whichever. Oh yes, and the atmosphere itself was pretty interesting too. From where I sat, i could see a collection of dolls on top of the entrance door. Pretty weird...The whole place was like a retro diner, except not like American retro diners with checkboard floors and pastel colors. This place was in your face. Red, oranges, adorned by vintage Japanese posters. I also remember seeing a group of Japanese guys. Oh the Japanese boys and their tight and questionable choice of attire. But I mean, where else really, would you ever be in the proximity of them other than a ramen shop in the middle of L.A.? A couple weeks after my visit, I had read a blog review about how the ramen here wasn't worth the hour-long wait. GET OUTTA HERE! Obviously that person doesn't appreciate good food when he/she encounters it. Daikokuya, you are like the first love for which I will always have a special place in my heart.

Santouka... Daikokuya... Santouka... Daikokuya... oh god, I can't decide! First off, I'm from out of town, and have only tried Daikokuya once. We waited about 45 minutes for the privilege, which I'm fine with, I understand. The ramen broth is awesome. Mild, a little sweet, lots of porky fatty goodness (we got it kottari style). The chashu is marbled with fat and tender. The gyoza is UNBELIEVABLE -- any more delicious, brown crust and I would have married the thing. But the noodles... the noodles.... hmm. I think I'll give Santouka a slight edge. I like a little more bite to my broth, and the noodles are better. But Daikokuya is definitely worth trying.

YUMMY RAMEN! Before I fell in love with Hakata Ramen, I used to come here every week. Prices were reasonable, about $10 a bowl, including tax and tip, and the food always tasted great. My usual order would be ramen with a small unagi or oyako don. The noodles were hit or miss, cooked too soft at times, but the soup had a meaty, distinct taste I craved. Also, I loved their marinated egg! One of the best I've had. The downside: the wait time!

Waited a while for the food, but it was worth it. I really love all the stuff that's in the soup and everything is just right. I think it's the combination of thickness of the soup and the texture of the noodle that makes ramen great. I've been to plenty ramen place that just had me shaking my head. Besides the ramen, the fried rice was really good also. The soup is not really as tasty as what the restaurant would like you to think though. It's got MSG. My mom makes better pork soup. The place doesn't have good air flow, so it was kind of hot to eat there on a summer day. I had to wipe the sweat of off my friend's forehead a few times and we took pictures cuz it's funny. and what's up with the "C" rating? Hence, one star off.

Some friends were on a ramen craze and were talking up this place like it was the second coming of the ramen gods, raving about how authentic and piping hot and awesome the house ramen is here.  After that kind of an intro, how could I not go and order the daikoku ramen. First the good... the tonkotsu broth was absolutely delicious.  It was rich, creamy, excellent flavors.  Loved the whole boiled egg and you could tell that the sprouts and scallions were cut fresh, the ramen was made fresh, those pork belly cuts were tender, sweet, and just amazing. Now... after that kind of raving review, why only three stars?  I may have hit them on an off night, but the violated the cardinal sin of noodles in broth - the broth was lukewarm and unacceptably so.  They were busy and I was really hungry so I opted to stick with what I had versus sending it back.  They've definitely earned a repeat visit, want to try it with the kotteri flavor and want to try the Tsukemen given how much was absolutely awesome with the ramen bowl.  However, lukewarm broth, no matter how delicious, is huge.

I went here for lunch today and I really felt that their ramen, ( i got the kottori btw which means it's extra porkyfattywonderful) had some of the best broth i've ever had. The texture and taste of the chashu was spot on also. My friend got katsudon which was sort of average except with the meal was this coleslaw esque salad that was awesome and probably worth ordering separately. Get the ramen, ask for extra pork and get a salad on the side.

OMG, i have been here a couple of times and every time I LOVE IT!! everything is sooo good...the ramen is awesome, i love the broth.  Well, im korean and so the broth is not what im used to, but its sooo good, sooo flavorful, and the noodles are really good too they don't get soggy.  When my friends and i come here we always get the sliced pork appetizer which is amazing and the sausages are really good too.   Besides the wait, which can be really long and the crowds and sitting at the bar which gives you a pork broth facial, i heart daikokuya, i totally have cravings for it~~YUM

I can't believe this is my first time reviewing this place, as I have been here numerous times since moving to LA.  One of my buddies introduced me to this hole in the wall ramen place when I first got here, and it has changed my perception of good ramen forever.   First off, there are not too many options you need to look at on the menu.  You really just need to decide whether you are hungry, or really hungry, and that will guide your decision making.  If you are just hungry and don't eat a ridiculous amount, just stick with getting the ramen bowl, which comes with the soup, noodles, pork slices, scallions, bamboo shoots, and bean sprouts.  That bowl, (I think it is around $8.50), will more than fill you up.  The beer here is also ridiculously cheap, and I believe it is on tap, which makes it even better. If you are really hungry, I would recommend going for the ramen and rice bowl combo.  You can pair up your ramen with a bowl of rice with meat/eggs for just an extra 3 bucks more, and I highly recommend the pork katsu, as that is my favorite rice bowl.  These two will for sure get you full, I guarantee it.   In terms of the wait, be prepared.  This is a REALLY small restaurant-- you can either dine at the bar, or in the booths which seat about four people.  You are not going to be able to get 8 people to sit together here; it's just not possible.  However, when you get to the restaurant, make sure to go inside and write your name down on the clipboard.  We went last night on a Sunday night (they close early at 8pm), got there around 6:30 and waited about 20 minutes for a group of 3.  Not too bad if you ask me. Anyways, overall this is the best ramen place I've had in LA.  I've had Mr. Ramen, which is next door, and also the ramen in that food court on the Westside, which is good, but not as good as this gem in J-town.

*Note: I was thisclose to going to Orochon instead of Daikokuya because I wanted to try the Man vs Food challenge, but thought against it because we had just eaten the Kogi truck minutes earlier.  Next time. First of all, expect to wait when you come.  My friend put down his name while we were in the Kogi truck line (it happened to be 50 yards away last night) so it worked out perfectly.  And yes, we had two separate dinners just minutes apart.  There's simply no explanation for our gluttony.  Well, one of the friends is pregnant so maybe that counts? The restaurant is small, uncomfortably warm and smelly (not the smell of food, mind you). We started with the gyoza.  I've said this before but gyoza never impresses me.  The dipping sauce was good and I do enjoy it, but gyoza is gyoza is gyoza.  Moving along... Ironically, for a ramen place, you basically only have one option for ramen... the Daikoku.  The rest of the menu is full of appetizers, teriyaki bowls, fried rice and bento boxes. The Daikoku ramen comes in three sizes, and I opted for the small since I had just eaten.  The noodles were a bit al dente, but I actually like it like that.  The pork was really good but they only gave 1 1/2 pieces.  And the soy sauce/pork-based broth was really good as well.  I actually added some of the chili oil and powder for more kick. Overall good stuff.  Good service, good food.   3.5 stars

To the people who complain about variety - I would prefer that they stick with a few things and make it well and THAT is exactly what Daikokuya is good at. Ramen - delicious broth - savory/umami!  Egg - center still mushy, great for mushing into the broth.  Pork slices - fatty and tender.  Noodles - uh...I can't think of a good adjective other than "tasty".  Bamboo shoots, sprouts - excellent additions. Gyoza - you must try this...crispy on the outside and the filling was delicious. Shredded pork bowl - I like to get the combo and eat the shredded pork with my ramen noodles.  The flavoring is excellent. Yes, the line is ridiculously long and it's a small space.  But service is great and the food is FANTASTIC.

Choices/variety...forget it..simple menu...you've got the one and only and you're expected to be satisfied..lol.. But honestly, it's good if you want a semi creamy soup base.  The pork is pretty good too.  Just be aware of the long wait and line.

I normally don't like ramen, but I LOVE it here.  I don't know what they put in it, but it is great quality stuff that mixes so well.  Mm... I haven't really gotten anything else here because I'm willing to go through the hour-long wait when I want good ramen.  They give you a really good-size amount too, so I usually don't even have an appetite to try their other stuff like gyoza (even when I go in starving!).  I hear the cold noodles in the summer are good though. If you're looking for something quick, you probably shouldn't come here (unless you make it in right when they open).  It's usually anywhere from a 30min-1.5 hour wait.  Sucks I know, but like their sign says, they don't want to sacrifice quality for quantity.  So suck it up and wander around Little Tokyo for a bit.

Okay, so this time I went and was anticipating excellent ramen. My first time had been fabulous. I was drooling thinking of the flavorful broth, soft egg, fatty meat, and yummy noodles. So in I went after a 45 minute wait.. We got a great little booth near the door. The servers were prompt with water/drinks. We both ordered regular ramen, they ran out of the super flavorful one. I ate it. It was just okay. Maybe I'm crazy but it wasn't something I'd wait 45 minutes for again... there was barely meat this time which would be my biggest "dislike." I still like the place but I wouldn't give it 4 stars anymore for just ramen. I'd still steal a pot of their soup though.

Best ramen ever. I've been all around southern california looking for the best ramen, and the award goes to Daikokuya. Santouka and Shin-Sen-Gumi are good, but not nearly as great. This place makes me happy every time I come here. Seriously, a big bowl of ramen will cure any ailment you have. Well, except for the blistering heat. Girl problems? Boy problems? Explosive diarrhea? Daikokuya Ramen is a panacea, no joke. So lets start off with the ambiance. I love the old-fashioned ambiance of this place. It's like a legit small ramen shop in Japan, not that I've ever been. The only problem is its hott as balls in there. You sweat right when you walk in, and its even worse when they bring a giant bowl of ramen in front of you. Seriously, I think i sweat into my soup, but I guess it makes it all the tastier. The ramen is simply, the tastiest broth that will ever touch your lips. The pork is super fatty and very delicious, and the freakin egg. Soft boiled and soaked in a soy broth? It's serious an orgasm, I kid you not. If I didnt eat the egg, it would probably end up being fertilized before I left the restaurant. ew, half chicken half man. gross. anyway, everything here is good. I usually get the combo cause its like 4 bucks more for a bowl of rice + a decent amount of meat. PLUS, you get this salad/coleslaw thing that has this dressing on it. LOOKS like thousand island, and my friends think it is, but i think its like 3.2 times better. There's like a slight sesame tinge to it or something but its freakin delicious. Anyway, long story short, this place is my favorite ramen restaurant. Everytime one of my friends is in LA, i force them to try it. Apparently they think that all ramen is like top ramen, and oh em gee i wanna slap them when i hear that. This ramen is seriously life changing. SO GO TRY ITTT!

I did NOT have the ramen!!! I got sushi! what? and I sat right in front of the boiling cauldron of ramen broth! wooo was that HOT! It was cool to watch the guys serving the ramen up though. I was NOT the only Caucasian in the place! but there were a lot of Asians and they were taking pictures and slurping up ramen with huge smiles on their faces. I LOVED my sushi! it was really cold, fresh, tasty and did not make me sick! woo hoo! parking is rough, we opted for the lot by sr. fish. Our friend, who is a world traveler, wanted to try the ramen here based on all he's heard. He said, "these are the best noodles I've had since Japan" with a big smile on HIS face!!! quite an endorsement from a guy who doesn't get very excited about much! I'm adding my pictures to the mix for the fun of it. We had a great lunch and can't wait to go back when it's not 90 degrees!!

FOOD: 1.) The Special = Pretty good :) Not too many toppings just a boiled egg, some meat, and lots of green onion in a yummy broth SERVICE: Good good. ATMOSPHERE: It's not too big, had bar seating, and maybe 10 booth tables. Had a nice warm bustle about it, because the place always has so many people waiting to eat here.

Everyone's had the good ol' cup ramen and 10c ramen packets... it's pretty much what college "cooking" consisted of, no? Well prepare yourself for a complete 180 and a long line. The wait is worth it, so long as you don't starve to death. This the best ramen I've ever had. I figure why not add to the nearly 1200 reviews? The food is great and the noodles are freshly made. No more flavor packets here! It's something that makes me wish that I lived closer to Little Tokyo. I also had an eel & rice dish here... both were really good and great value. It's a nice little place to take friends that are in town if you don't mind fighting the traffic to get there. The parking situation isn't the best though.

Amazing ramen, fair price, and a ridiculous wait! It's totally worth it though. I've been here several times and it is one of the few places where I just get lost in a world of taste with my food! The ramen broth is unique here, it is smooth, rich, and walks a careful line between salty and spicy that no other place I've tried has. Great to come by if you find yourself downtown. I bet it's less crowded in the mid-afternoon. If you come early enough, be sure to check out the fresh Mochi place right down the street.

This place has great pork broth ramen. I believe they wrote it as Tonkotsu based. I became a big fan off one try. In my opinion it was the best ramen I have had yet. My wife on the other hand would disagree.  The miso flavored ramen's of Orochon is still her favorite as she is not a pork fan to begin with.  I guess the long drives into Downtown will now include debates about which Ramen house to visit.  Maybe we might just have to go Chinese. Focus back on Daikokuya...this is my new favorite ramen. The ingredients are excellent and properly prepared from the perfect boiled marinated egg with the perfectly softened center.  The noodles reminding of my childhood eating top ramen but now of course spruced up and more adult, (ie. Ratatouille).  The broth perfectly brewed, this is not a high heat quick cook soup, this is someones perfected art.  I read it is made offsite and would not be surprised to find the "secret kitchen" is a home of some sort of Japanese perfectionist with the ancient clay pots or something of that imaginary train of thought. I will definitely be back and i will eat!  My sister's recommendation of getting the Combinations was also a good one.  Even if you don't touch the side order, for 3 bucks you get a great next day meal. p.s. Oh yeah and I had to take off a star for bad seating and making us wait in the cold.  Couldn't they take out that cabin in the back and make a waiting area, or more seats?

This cute Little Tokyo outpost serves very good ramen but is not as amzaing as other reviews suggest, nor is it likely worth the frequent wait. I was able to get in with a friend on a weekday lunchtime with only about a 10 minute wait. The inside does not feel crowded but the service is a little rushed. Prices are good all around but it is clearly somewhere you go for the noodles. The standard bowl with kotteri is large and filling and not as salty as one would expect. Good ramen in a city that has little experience with ramen...but not mindblowing.

Haven't been here in a long time, but decided a cold, rainy day would be perfect for a hot bowl of ramen.  Wait times were atrocious.  My friends didn't want to go here because of that.  We waited so long that we needed to put more money in the meter. Parking is awful too.  Fortunately, they opened up a new Gold Line Little Tokyo station close by.  Unfortunately, I drove today and paid through the nose for parking. Anyway, onto the food review!  Most of the people in our party got ramen, which comes out in a large bowl, filled with piping hot broth.  The noodles were just right, not too crunchy and not too soft.  The broth was a lot saltier than I remembered.  And full of pork flavor.  You also get a few pieces of tender pork and a soft boiled egg.  It's about $10 head with tax & tip.  Not bad at all. If you get the combo, it comes with a side salad.  The salad was positively drenched in dressing. In the summer, they have a cold noodle bowl that is good.  The hot ramen today was good, but somehow not as good as I remembered.

You will have to wait to get in this restaurant. We had the luxury of patience and good company, but even with that the hour wait was mind-boggling. I went with a company of four and we had our stomachs ready for one of Los Angeles's most talked-about ramen restaurants. When we finally got, we got a nice table in the right side of the restaurant. The decor is awesome! They went for the 1950's Japan look. A lot of old posters, bill boards, and advertisements lined the walls. The vintage Asahi beer girl caught my eye. Elsewhere on the walls is a giant poster that said "tabako", or "smoking". Well our food came. We all ordered the Daikoku Ramen special. They were out of settori that night. The ramen is worth the hype. The soup was rich, the noodles tasted fresh, and the cha-shu was tender. My friend thought it was closer to bacon than anything else. Everything came into play, and like many people say, the soft-centered egg was the interesting part. Many ramen places try to do it, but Daikoku-ya did it flawlessly. We ate and ate, and ate some more. We slurped and chomped our way to noodle heaven. I'm definitely coming back to this place again next time I'm in L.A.

I tried the Daikokuya in Monterey Park and was rather underwhelmed. However, I reserved my final judgment for its main branch in Little Tokyo. When I finally made it to Daikokuya on a Thursday night, I was surprised by several things. First, that parking on the street was still somewhat difficult to find after 10pm. Second, we still had to wait roughly 20-25 minutes to be seated. It's best to go in smaller parties, optimally in parties of 4. Their booths are only meant to comfortably seat 4 people; you can fit six people, either cramming the booth or adding two additional seats, but I'd recommend small parties. I ordered the Daikokuya ramen with kotteri ramen broth, just as I did at the MP branch. This time, I was not disappointed. Although the noodles were still chewier than I liked, they were more flavorful than last time. The broth had plenty of character, which is the principal concern of any ramen lover. The bamboo was fresh and crunchy, and the egg was just a bit undercooked well, just the way it was intended. I tried to compare Daikokuya and Santouka to determine which one is better, but I arrived at the conclusion that they are uniquely different in every way. Daikokuya is invested in pork based broth, while Santouka's best offering is its salt based soup. The ambience is definitely a big factor. I would go to Daikokuya more if I could, but having the time and patience to do so comes along very rarely. Just be sure you're ready for a long wait and a difficult time parking, no matter what time you arrive.

Continued from my review of Wakasaya.  Our visit to Daikokuya was the start of an epic food journey sampling snacks from the Japan town center and eating half a meal at Wakasaya (during the 1hr 10min wait for our table). Chris H.: "Will this be the best ramen I've had in my life?" Waitress: *smirk/giggle* "Thank you, thank you." (thinking my friend was complementing the ramen before he even ate it) Hilarious how there is a picture of the sign in sheet.  We signed in at 7:30 and finally got a seat at 8:30pm.   Pretty much everyone at the restaurant orders ramen so you would expect orders to be taken quickly and the meal to come out quickly.  Even after we ordered it took about 20 minutes to get the food.  The broth was not piping hot as most would like.   Because I had eaten a half meal before, I ordered a half order of ramen.  Overall pretty good, but would not wait so long in the future.  A little bit overrated.

So I've been to Daikokuya Costa Mesa, Daikokuya Hacienda Heights, and finally I've been to Daikokuya Little Tokyo. My review is pretty much the same with the Hacienda Heights Daikokuya. I didn't not notice anything different in the consistency of the noodle and the taste of the broth. We ordered the typical ramen dish, and the shredded pork dish. I think it's very much the same as the Hacienda Heights Daikokuya. It was a really long wait (1.5 hour) and it was quite a drive for us from Orange County. Now, if I want a fix of ramen noodle, I'd go to Hacienda Heights Daikokuya.

I always saw groups waiting outside this place so decided to give it a try.  For those who can't read kanji it's the store with a large yellow banner outside. Having lived in Japan I have tasted many different kinds of ramen, and coming back home I've enjoyed the different tastes LA has to offer and Daikokuya is my favorite. Their main soup base is "tonkotsu" which is pork based so it is creamy, rich, and oily.  If you don't have this type and enjoy shoyu, miso, or a lighter fish base then it might not be your favorite. but the noodles are fresh and have excellent texture.  They are not as thing and straight as the noodles like Ramen Santouka, but they are just wavy enough to compliment the slurps. The ramen comes topped with the usual...green onions, seasoned sliced bamboo shoots called "menma", pickled sliced red ginger "beni shoga", etc Try their gyoza appetizers as well.  It's unique and known as "bo gyoza" as it comes out like a straight rod...none of the sliced, crescent moon shaped stuff you usually see.  So you have to split it apart with your chopsticks, and it comes with a mountain full of green onions that really compliments the taste. When it's busy you will wait anywhere from 30-45 min but if you're in the area and hungry then it's definitely worth it.

This place has been around forever.  There is usually a wait of at least 20 minutes, but it's definitely well worth it. I ordered the combination Daikokuya ramen and chicken teri bowl. This is the best ramen you will have ever have.  The broth is delicious! It has a rich meaty taste to it.  I usually order the ramen with extra kotteri flavor (basically it's soup base extracted from pork back fat).  The chicken teriyaki is also an exceptional dish.  The chicken skin is slightly crispy and the chicken is lightly glazed, not too sweet. The place looks like a Japanese diner with vintage Japanese posters and decorations.  Very cool.  The food is excellent and the service was good.  Expect to spend about $15 per person.

Shredded Pork Bowl.  That is all you need to know.  If you can finish a combination go right ahead and try (way too much food for me) but you just must just have the shredded pork bowl with the ramen.  I know, I know, this is suppose to be a ramen shop not a rice shop but damn this bowl is the best (and personally I am much more into Eboshi).   The wait for this place is usually about 20-30mins depending on your party size and when you go.  This place is a very small shop but usually the table turnover rate is very fast as the service is very fast and people generally do not sit around to chat afterwards.  If you are going on prime nights, plan to wait for about a hour and pretty much you can only fit five people to a table, so larger parties need to split up. I would definitely try out this place as least once.  I like to come back to this shop whenever I am in the area.  I still need to try some of their appetizers but I can never finish the pork bowl :( haha.

Whaaaaa .... well, I just don't know what to say. I had to scroll through 15 pages of reviews before finding one lower than five-stars, and after my experience there today during lunch, I can only be left to surmise that giving Daikokuya five stars on Yelp is some sort of L.A. food scene must. But ... and this is a big but ... I just can't take it there. I had jury duty today, and was thrilled beyond thrilled to realize that Daikokuya was a short jaunt from the courthouse and I had an hour-and-a-half for lunch. Having been thwarted by the seemingly endless line every other time I've attempted a visit, I thought finally, this was my chance. Yet when I got there, I was dismayed to find about seven names on the list before me. NOOOO!!!!! This is LUNCHtime, not LINEtime!! The wait was not horrible--about 20 minutes--and I eventually snagged a seat at the bar. I ordered the ramen and an iced coffee, both of which came out quickly. I began hurriedly slurping down the noodles on account of my limited time, but remembered a few bites in that this was Daikokuya, supposedly the best purveyors of ramen in ALL of Los Angeles, so I should slow down to get a firmer grasp on what it was my taste buds were experiencing. The ramen was good--very good--the broth silky and rich, incredibly rich for a non-cream base, and not at all salty, like some pork dishes can be. Also, the noodles were wonderfully firm in texture. But, I found the green onions overly abundant and the slices of pork made the ramen too rich for my taste, especially for an afternoon meal. I was super glad to have ordered the iced coffee to counter balance the lethargy-producing effects of all that richness. A tip I'd suggest:  order the half-order of ramen if you go for lunch. It's just as filling and about three dollars cheaper than the full order. My entire meal, excluding tip, was under $10. I'm no ramen expert, but there's no way I'm giving Daikokuya five stars until I experience a few more ramen places for proper comparison. Based on my experience today, I am surprised that it's so completely, friggin', overwhelmingly popular--even at lunchtime! On a Thursday!

I went to this place tonight with some friends and was pleasantly surprised. The Pros: whatever the pork was that looked like marinated bacon in some sort of teriyaki type sauce was amazing. The raman noodles were AWESOME. The beer was AWESOME. The cons: We waited an hour, but that's not quite a con considering all the best Asian food places have similar waits. The hallway past the kitchen and towards the bathroom (30 feet away) smelled like dirt. Otherwise, the place was packed and it was good food for a cheap price. I was pleasantly surprised considering I always thought Raman noodles were like the kind I buy for 33 cents at the supermarket. I definitely recommend you coming to this spot!

We did it! It was a Saturday afternoon and it only took us 40mins of waiting time to finally try this famous ramen. Tenkaippen Ramen in Hawaii is still #1 in my heart, but Daikokuya will definitely do for now. Of course we ordered the signature ramen and asked for extra koterri flavor. The broth was hearty and rich and the thin noodles hit the spot. I loved the abundance of pork slices since some other ramen joints tend to be a little stingey on that end. The boiled egg was cold in the middle, but once I broke into it and mixed it w/the broth, it was allll good. Ben F. and I did agree that we could've gone with fewer slices of green onion. I just found out that ramen comes in half sizes - gotta ask for that next time!

Stopped by last night after a failed attempt at attending a LA Kings game.  I love this place, but it still really boggles my mind that so many people are willing to wait so long just for a bowl of noodles.  Yes, the noodles are good and the broth is particularly tasty, but it is just noodles...but I digress. I had the Daikokuya Ramen, which as I stated previously and above...is a very good bowl of ramen.  The soft bowl egg when mixed with the broth is quite delicious.  I suggest you add some of the pickles that are in the containers on the table for some extra oomph...The fried rice was particularly greasy last night.  Which isn't a bad thing because it is cooked with the rendered fat from the pork belly.  Its basically if you fried bacon and used the rendered fat to cook sausage, it be great.  Or if you twice fried bacon wrapped bacon.  That's what the fried rice here is like. I guess the only real downsize with this place is the wait can be quite long...which can turn off a lot of people as I did notice quite a few people walk in and then walk straight out after hearing about the hour plus wait.

OMG this place is worth the wait. Get the Daikokuya Ramen bowl (but NOT kattori style (sp?) the extra back fat version the regular is rich enough). Anyway, we got there 11:30 got seated lil after 12 and it's worth the wait! Don't even think about it, just go it's that good.

I LOVE this place!  The wait is super long, like an hour+ but so worth it.  I live in San Francisco and drive down to this location just for ramen.  For about $10 a bowl, you get a good size meal.  I took my sister and her roommate here and we all got the ramen bowls with the kotteri (I think that's how you spell it) flavouring and we ended up having left overs for later and that was all we ordered and it was the first meal of the day. Parking sucks! It's located right outside of Little Tokyo which is a huge plus for me since I love to shop.  the first time I went I had the yaki soba, and while it was still good, you shouldn't go to a steak house and order the fish, or the Ramen house and order anything but.  It's a TINY shoppe, so they really can't hold a group bigger than 5 without using more than one table, it's not perfect for groups, but they try to make it work.  The waiters and cooks are SUPER friendly as well so don't be afraid to ask for clarification!

I've heard a lot about this place from my ramen-fanatic friends over the years and I finally went a couple months ago to see what it was all about. Bad: *horrible street parking. It took 10-15 minutes to find parking..and we didn't even park THAT close! *long wait to be seated - and the waiting area is really small *too much dressing on the salad - i usually don't include dressings in my salad, so I thought that big dallop of dressing was a bit much for my taste. *the meal set doesn't come with a rice bowl like Santouka. Good: *Broth was hot and fatty  - did NOT get the extra fat option although my guy friends did. *Good choice in noodles *Good portion size. Overall, if I had to pick Santouka or Daikokuya, I'd choose Santouka. Sorry Daikokuya, but the lack of a rice bowl and egg that come with a meal set, the inconvenient parking situation, and long wait time has dropped you down to 3 stars for me. Maybe if I had gone later in the evening, there would've have been less of a wait, but I went fairly early in the afternoon (~4:30pm)

This location compared to Monterey Park's location is nearly the same as far as the food goes. The eggs taste better in Monterey Park. The broth is slightly better in Little Tokyo. The noodles are the same. The atmosphere of Monterey Park is better in my opinion because the Little Tokyo location is basically a hotbox. They're both cramped, but wow you feel like you're getting baked in the LT location (slightly exaggerating). The eel I had in LT tasted slightly better. The service for LT was alright, though a friend of mine had complaints and hated it. I'd say just go to the MP location if you live near there and want to avoid the parking hassle in LT.

I'm not particularly versed in a ton of ramen, but hey, I'm going to throw my hat into this over 1K review ring. We went after the lunch rush. Seated quickly. Got the house ramen. Generous green onions, nice broth. The noodles were just OK. My boiled egg was really good, my friend's, not so much. The pork was decent, but there wasn't a lot of it. The ginger was OK. The tempura was not really crispy, but it was still edible. I know people love this place, but I tend to just walk by and go to the place several doors down because they have more variety. Bottom line, I wouldn't wait for this, but it is decent.

Pros: -Good before food started to cool -Food came almost as soon as you order -large portions -Price is reasonable Cons -I waited almost 1.5 hours to be seat (6people) -The restaurant is small -Their signature dish was WAY too oily. The broth in my Daikokuya started to solidify as I was eating. Seeing chunks of oil made me stop eating.

I can't eat ramen anymore ever since coming here.  I got a combo - ramen with sashimi served on the side.  The sashimi is the only thing I ate that nobody else in the group had.  Five hours later, I was the only one stuck on the toilet with ramen-flavored goodness spilling out.  Now whenever I smell ramen, it reminds me of vomit.  Ugh. That being said, the ramen is damn good.  It wasn't their ramen that made me sick - it was the sashimi.  But still, I got sick, and now I can't eat ramen because my brain associates that flavor with puke.  Damn it, Daikokuya - I really wanted to love you, but you ruined it for me.

The first time I came here was a year ago, unfortunately we could not find parking, and the sidewalk was filled with people waiting to get called, so we did not get to eat here. Finally, a year later, and after some hype from our friend, who was super excited to eat here, we managed to come at an odd time, when the sidewalk was empty..... and still had to wait 30 minutes!!! i GUESS it was worth the wait. Yes. Yes.... it was.... I believe they have the best shredded pork rice bowl in the whole world. It's basically chasu over rice with a sweet savory flavor to it. Their chicken meets egg over rice is good too, it also has a sweet flavor to it. Their ramen soup was okay/good/not great. Their servings are so huge, it's like a XL at any other ramen place, but standard size for everyone here. The combos will definitely have you taking your leftovers in a doggy bag. What a first. I was surprised to see other customers before me taking food home... who does that? Little did I know, I'd be doing the same!

We went here on a Monday evening at around 6:30pm and it was so crowded! Had to wait about 40 minutes for a table. We just took this to mean that it must be good and stuck around.. It did not disappoint. We shared a ramen combo and got the teriyaki eel bowl along with some pork cutlets. I loved the preparation of the eel, and my bf loved the pork cutlets and the salad. it's such a good deal! We got all of that (minus the cutlets) for $12.50 and it was more than enough to fill up the both of us. I found the ramen broth a tad salty (so of course the bf loved it) but it was still not bad at all. I do wish they would let us flavor the broth a little more ourselves, but they don't have very many options at the table (only a spicy red pepper shaker if I recall) At least there are some cute stores nearby to keep you busy while you wait, like the anime place!

I love ramen and had to try the most popular place in LA! There is always a line and it's well worth the wait! The restaurant is a bit small, so just head on in and write your name on the waiting list yourself! A bowl of ramen was enough to fill me up and then some more! I love the broth and most especially the tasty pork! Of course, what meat isn't good without the fat? You'll find plenty of it in their thin slices of pork! Since I'm a health nut, I pick it away... It also comes with an egg, which I'm sure is great, but I've never been a fan of eggs unless they're plain egg whites. Sorry! I will be back again sometime when I'm up for the wait!

I've heard about this place for a long time. I wanted to see what the hype was all about, so I went here. First off, the LINE is LONGGGGGGG!!! You have to sign the waiting list. If, by the time they called your name, and your party is not entirely there, they will skip you. So be sure to have everyone there on time! Parking can be a bit hard to find, but if you don't mind the walking, you can park on the opposite site of where the outdoor mall is and cut straight across. Now, the house ramen? OMG. It's GOOD!! It has to be their broth or something, but this place is by far, the best when it comes to ramen. No wonder there's always a long line. Their appetizers? Not so crazy, but this place is known for their ramen, so you'll be an idiot if your main plate is not ramen. I recommend going to this place on weekdays at night when it's not so packed. Oh. If they run out of broth, the restaurant will stop serving ramen. thought you would like to know that.

Ramen joints and 1 hour long wait times. I don't understand this drama for LA. This is the Asian equivalent to waiting 45 minutes for a grilled cheese sandwich. Given a reasonable wait time, a 3 star choice. But I need to dissuade people from believing the hype on this spot. 2 stars. $13 for a huge bowl of ramen with an unagi don bowl. They were both solid, but nothing to rave over for and certainly not justifying waiting aggravation. There's nothing mystical nor a Sally shrieking in orgasmic nirvana.  The waiter was brisk and friendly, and delivered everything super speedy. And the food was decent. I'd rather just have Pho, save some money, and use my free time more usefully. I knew I should have just cooled off in the Far Bar a few stores down!

In search of re-creating my experience in SF J-Town, I was in search of some amazing ramen in the LA area.  Looking at the pictures online of the ramen made my mouth water.  By the time I got to Daikokuya, I knew what I wanted to order.  Apparently, everyone and their mom was at this place for lunch so we waited for about 15-20 minutes. Of course, it is sunny in LA so you can't complain for waiting outside.   The restaurant is a small place lined with booths, and bar seating.  It is nicely decorated with nostalgic Japanese advertisements.  The service is great, everyone being really friendly.  The anticipation was killing me!  When I got my bowl of noodles, sadly, they were very hard.  I let it sit in the broth hoping they would get softer but they did not.  The ramen tasted like a small step up from instant ramen, which haunts me to this day b/c I had too much of it in college.  The char sieu and turkey that my friend got on the side with her cold ramen was tasty though.  My char sieu was all fat so I ended up eating her plate of meats.  The bowls of ramen are huge though so for $8.50, you can get pretty full.

With the reviews here, you already know that the ramen is going to be delicious, and it was. The broth was the best part. What you NEED to know is that though the food was great (had the ramen + fried rice set) it was hotter than Satan's balls in there. I tried to shove as much food down my throat before calling it quits and taking the rest home. This place needs a fan or some A/C or SOMETHING. Be ready to SWEAT, especially if you sit at the counter. Kinda hard to enjoy the food when you're worried about passing out from heat exhaustion. =| 4 Stars, nonetheless.

First off, I want to say that I went on a monday at 430pm to avoid any rush lines. There were plenty of seats available. So to anyone complaining about waiting a long time, be smart and dont go in peak hours to try this place and then later complain. The wait is long because its good. Their ramen is probably one of the best I've had in the United States. The soup is perfect and the noodles are perfect also. It tastes like it was warped straight from Japan. The chefs dont overcook or undercook anything. Even their fried rice was pretty good. In my opinion, Orochon has a SLIGHTLY better chashu because of its thickness, but in taste, soup flavor, noodle quality, and overall quality, this place is the best. The only place I haven't tried yet is Santouku... but thats next on my list. Also, I was highly disappointed at the ramen in Chabuya.. Daikokuya is #1 for ramen on my list of LA ramen so far.

Yummy. But not my usual style of ramen... I much prefer the Hakata style. Also, the gyoza are... weird. They're fried in a whole single flat bunch. Not quite crispy enough-- crispy on the surface, but only just so, and the filling is completely forgettable. The char shu is definitely better here than at the Monterey Park location, nice and fatty and delicious. The rice bowls are admirably consistent, though, which is a good thing: yum! Even if I was about to explode... What kills me, though, is that it was a Monday night at 9pm, we still had a 30 or 40 minute wait... they serve you very very promptly and all that jazz, but man, that's just rough. Even with a waiter who's a riot and whatnot, the food here just isn't quite good enough to make me think it's worth the wait. Again, as I said earlier, this isn't my favorite style of ramen either, so I am definitely biased...

On a Thursday night I waited with a friend for 45 minutes to get seats.  Towards the end of the wait I started to question my friend's wisdom, but once I had my first bite of the shredded kurobuta pork rice bowl, all was forgiven.  That, and the kotteri ramen, were both as good as it gets.  I liked the noodle consistency in particular -- almost a little al dente. Outside of Himawari in San Mateo, this is the best ramen I've had in California.

I've had mixed experiences with ramen around the country but this is no question the best I've ever had. We arrived at 10:45am on a Saturday and were the second in line (they open at 11am). This place fills up completely within 20 minutes of them opening and I've heard that the wait could easily become 2 hours so definitely plan ahead. I ordered the ramen and tuna sashimi combination at the suggestion of a local friend and was not disappointed. The meal started out with a salad that is more of a shredded cabbage/coleslaw-looking bowl topped with something similar to Thousand Island dressing plus mayonnaise. I didn't make that sound too tasty but it was addictive and got better with every bite. I was practically licking the bowl by the end. Next came an order of Gyoza for the table. Each order has five rectangular shaped dumplings that were perfectly crispy on one side. I'm not sure how that crispness is achieved but It may be the best gyoza I've ever had... Finally, the tuna sashimi and ramen came out (food and service were both quick!) The tuna sashimi bowl had a ton of tuna on it, much more than I would have expected as part of a combination. The slices were huge and fresh and all in my stomach within a few minutes. Now, on to the ramen. This has to be the first time that I actually thought the ramen was worth paying $8 for; Most other ramen places taste entirely too similar to $0.10 ramen that I can buy from a grocery store and make myself. The broth is to-die-for and there's even an option to add extra fat. My friend got the extra fat option which makes the broth that much richer tasting but I'm not sure I would be able to eat as much of the ramen when the broth is greasier and heavier like that. The pork was amazing, the hard-boiled egg was delicious, and everything was perfect. Total after tax and tip for a ramen combination and 1/5 of an order of gyoza = $16.93 I will definitely be back next time I'm in town. Just writing this review is making me hungry for more and slobbering...

I wouldn't wait longer than 15 minutes for this location, as the one here has the worst line, between their other spots in Monterey Park and Hacienda Heights.  I've seen crowds out here at 9:00 PM.  Between Little Tokyo and Monterey Park is about a 10-minute drive without traffic.  Just don't plan on coming with a group greater than 4, unless you like waiting for eternity. It's not the best broth I've had, but for the price, It's worth having once in a while.  I prefer the richer kotteri flavor, but it might be a bit heavy for some.  Everything else is great, like the egg and the chashu/sliced pork belly.  Depending on your appetite, a bowl of ramen may be enough to fulfill your satiety.  Side dishes aren't bad either, like the gyoza, sashimi, and tempura.  Though it feels like straightforward stuff anyone would take.  But I suppose one wanted more variety, there are some izakayas in the area that do a good job of that. They don't really stray from tradition, and the execution is pretty good. One thing about Daikokuya is the ambience, with old-school, 70's and 80's Japanese posters and such.  With the amount of business they get, it's a very loud place to be sure.

I like the food here. However, I don't understand the hype or the line. The food is simple and good.  I've always enjoyed eating here but I rarely do because of the line.  There are so many places to eat in Little Tokyo that if there's a wait somewhere, I usually go somewhere else. This place almost always has a wait, so I rarely eat here  :( I do believe the food is solid here, it's always been consistent and tasty.  The service is fine but I've never tried to ask for anything difficult (or change/substitute anything).  They seem busy, so I order quick and get out of the way.

The famous Daikokuya... Since this place is always crowded with people waiting outside of a small joint, I haven't tried until recently! As someone who does not like to wait in line, Daikokuya wasn't a place I HAD to check out, since they don't take reservations. I always said, wait that long? I'd rather go to Orochon! Nevertheless, after a wonderful experience at Ippudo NYC which is known for their tonkotsu broth, I had to check out the other famous tokotsu broth ramen spot Daikokuya in LA to compare them correctly. Final verdict? I still prefer Ippudo, but Daikokuya does have good broth with better portions! I still haven't changed my mind about waiting for so long for a ramen where I have other places I can go, but definitely worth trying at least once! I purposely went in time for their opening, so I don't have to wait too long. But by the time we found parking & came back, we had to wait for ~45min+. Luckily, it was a fast sailing once we were seated, thank god! Gyoja - different than usual! I liked the sauce. Sliced Roast Pork - slightly greasy, but so good! Daikoku Ramen - a large bowl of tonkotsu soup! yummmmmmmmmmmmm. I think you can also get extra rich soup by choice Shredded Pork Bowl - the server recommended this to me over the spicy tuna bowl & surely! It was really good! Basically same as slice roast pork, but i liked this better!

Words cannot describe how good this place is. We went to the Little Tokyo location and waited for nearly two hours before we got seated...and the food was well worth the wait. Get their ramen combo here. The broth, noodle, pork, and egg are as authentic as they come. The only place I had better was in Japan...and maybe Santouku. If you are planning to visit, make sure you have a few hours budgeted as this place is ALWAYS busy. Make sure you sign in and remember your number. As another reviewer mentioned, they only call your number a few times and then they move on to somebody else.

Me and my friends came here for the famous Daikokuya ramen. The food is good, but I wouldn't say it's one of the best. The bowl was huge with lots of soup. It was too salty for my taste and the texture of the noodle felt like instant noodles. The place is worth a visit if you are at Little Tokyo. I really liked the ambiance of the restaurant. It was small and was completely full when we got there so we had to wait for more than 30 min before we got sited at the sushi bar. Service was quick and the servers are pretty cute ;)

I love Daikokuya!  The best ramen around, you cannot, cannot go wrong if you go here.  The broth has so much depth and flavor, you can eat it forever and still want more just so you can try it again.  Everything is well priced and service is quick and friendly. Not much else to say.  Everyone's basically said everything there is to say about this place.  My only gripe is that parking around here is nearly impossible, and the wait is ridiculous.  I've never waited less than 45 minutes here, and still I've never gotten a table.  I've only ever eaten at the bar.  Once, my friend and I got tired of waiting so we got food from the Kogi truck and when we returned we still had a few people ahead of us.  Sigh.

When I interviewed out here in 2008, I'm glad I stopped by here.  The wait was well worth the food.  I swear I had the best meal of my life...the Udon noodles were so flavorful and the food was absolutely delicious.  This is what makes California great...restaurants like this place. If you have one place to check out, make sure it's here.  You can't beat it people.  Come hungry, leave very, very satisfied.

We came here on a rainy day and it was still packed.  I guess everyone craves ramen on a rainy day.  Anyways, because we had a party of seven, we waited at the Far Bar, but got passed up twice.  I was almost fed up and about to leave cause then we were waiting like 1.5-2 hr.  Thinking this better be delicious.  Anyways, we got called up.  We had to break up into tables and counters.   TIP: not good for a big group!  Better sticking small cause you can't sit with each other anyways. Plus to this place for accommodating larger crowds.   But even though, we waited so long, I was satisfied, but I won't come here again with more than 4 people.  I sat by the counter, I enjoy sitting there.  Reminded me of having ramen in Japan.   You pretty much get a HUGE bowl of ramen.  It is so worth it, I only ate half of it because it was so big.  I got the combination with fried rice and that was quite tasty.  i really like the broth here.  It is one of the better ones I have had in my life.  The NOODLES though were kinda tough, could have been softer.  Mine was TOO al dente.  The Salad/coleslaw it come with is so good.  The dressing really gives it the WOW factor.   The funny thing about this place is when you go to the bathroom they are bumping Mexican music in the back.  So funny!

How have I not written a review for Daikokuya yet? The ramen here is amazing. Get the house ramen with the extra fatty broth (yes, I'm steadily on my way towards obesity). If you go on a weekday at a later time, the wait isn't too bad. But don't even bother going on a weekend. Daikokuya is truly an unforgettable ramen...mouth watering as I type this review... The owners should seriously consider expansion or renovating the restaurant into a bigger space. Business would definitely blow up.

Its been awhile since I've eaten at a place that has wowed my taste buds. In fact the past couple of restaurants have ben mediocre that I have not been motivated to write. I absolutely loved this place, that I was excited to write my review. The atmosphere of this restaurant is small, its literally a hole in the wall between two giant restaurants. Parking is somewhat difficult to find so if you are planning a gathering I suggest car pooling. Why did I put myself through such an obstacle for parking I asked myself. Well what was to await was definitely worth the extra effort. Heck even the 20 min wait to be seated is worth coming here. I am quite surprised for such a busy restaurant the quality in taste is pretty dam good. We had ordered a ramen dish and the shredded pork bowl which is my favorite. The sushi was good as an appetizer to feed that appetite. The service is quick and attentive. But they won me with the shredded pork bowl, it is so simple yet full in taste. I dream of coming back again for some more, made the top of my list and restaurant of the week. Thank you Daikokuya for motivating me to write again. If I could I'd give you guys 10 stars.

I'm going to say it and it's going to make my die hard Daikokuya lovers cry but... I think Daikokuya's ramen is just OKAY. They're really going to consider this blasphemy but... I thought their broth was BLAND and as not flavorful like my love, Santouka. The food was definitely not worth the 1.5+ hour wait or getting chaffed to the booth seating right next to the kitchen. I can't complain about the service or the sides (I got the eel and it was delicious). But for the wait and the $$, I'd rather just stick to good ol' Santouka. My bf had to put Siracha in his ramen for a hint of flavor and I consider that blasphemy for any ramen lover. Sorry Daikokuya lovers but this place does not make my top 5 list of best ramen :(

I left this place stuffed!  I haven't been to the downtown Daikokuya in a long time and I am not sure if they serve bigger portions compared to the other sister stores.   I got there on a weekday about 1:30 and I was for sure expecting a line.  To my surprise no line, only had a few tables and the bar was completely empty.  I was ecstatic, having not eaten all day long.   This ramen shop is simple, a few boothes, a long bar in front of the kitchen and waitress screaming in high pitched Japanese.   I was immediately tended to and I knew what I want.  Daikokuya ramen + a pork cutlet rice bowl.  Almost instantaneously a bowl of cabbage salad arrived followed by my ramen and rice bowl.  Very quick service.  As I started eating, the place started to fill.  Even the well known and dreaded line began to form.   Ramen comes with egg, bamboo, 3 slices of char siu, tons of scallions, bean sprouts all soaked in a bowl of sweet and savory miso broth.  The noodles were cooked perfectly chewy with the amazing texture of ramen.  I basically inhaled this wonderful goodness.  Unfortunately the rice bowl took a back seat until I was finished with the ramen.  Rice bowl was good, but I had no more room in my stomach to finish that.   I walked out of the restaurant happy and satisfied.  I wanted something quick, filling and delicious -- this placed delivered.  Now if I had to wait in line to get in, I may be writing a completely different review. Will I return? YES!  BTW this place seems to be better than their sister stores.

Hour wait.  always.   Didnt think I like ramen until here... chewy bouncy noodles submerged in good broth. Generous amt too.  Didnt mind the hour long wait so much, But I do mind the fact that they rush you.   Didn't think I like gyoza until I came here.  It's got something special.. that good layer of extra crunchy skin. So the food is as good as it gets, I think.  So if you don't mind hangin out and socializing not in the restaurant, but before your meal instead, do come for the awesome food.   What bf and I usually do is get our number, explore Little Tokyo, stop by Mikawaya and eat mochi before our meal, and then go back to Daikokuya to wait some more, at this point, it's usually only another 15 minutes.   oh, and don't get the combo with the ramen.. you don't get as much ramen.. which would be ok... if they serve it in a small bowl..  but they still serve it in the huge bowl, just the ration of broth and noodles is now off.  And the noodles are not as bouncy in huge broth.

After seeing Daikokua mentioned quite a few times for its ramen, I bookmarked it and waited for the day that I would find myself in downtown LA. I arrived early around 5 PM on a Saturday and ready to brave the wait with my empty stomach. The wait wasn't too bad, maybe 20 minutes tops because we were early. I ordered the Daikokuya Ramen combo with a small shredded pork bowl. The ramen came out first. The soup hit that comfort level spot and wasn't overly salty like other places. The ramen noodles had a good bite to it and the pork just melted in my mouth. There was way more been sprouts than bamboo shoots, which was kind of a disappointment. Then came the egg which I couldn't resist anymore. The egg, as well as the rest of the ingredients/toppings, should all come together in a savory experience in which you want to take small bites in order to make it last throughout the whole bowl, but end up eating it quickly and wishing for more. The Daikokuya website touted their egg as one of the things that makes their ramen special and the picture showed a tantalizing  soft-centered hard boiled egg. The egg in my bowl was not cut in half like the picture to show off its soft center. That's fine. So with great anticipation, I took a small bite into the egg and my heart broke. The center was not soft at all and worse yet, the yolk was cold. It pretty much ruined the rest of my ramen experience. Then my shredded pork rice bowl came. This dish was everything I expected - the pork was soft and had a glaze that had that tiny bit of sweetness. For $11.95 for the combo that was very filling and was complimented by quick service, Daikokuya offers a great value. A nice little addition to their service was a map along with a note on the front window that recommended a more affordable parking spot compared to the metered and structure parking. It was somewhere on the northeast corner of E 1st St and Judge John Aiso St.

The ramen here definitely lives up to the hype. Being Asian and from the SGV, I've eaten a lot of ramen in my life and the ramen here beats out all of them. I got here at 10:55am so there was no wait once the restaurant opened. The broth is crazy flavorful and the noodles are perfectly cooked, and I like how they give you so many green onions--it makes everything taste fresh. The bowl of ramen is also gigantic, I wish I had gotten a half-size bowl so I could also try the gyoza. An excuse to come back, I guess (not that I needed one).

On my vacation in LA and had to have at least Ramen once before going back.  Our friends recommended this place, since the place we wanted to try was a little far away.   I have to say that this was 3.5 starts.  Can't give them a full 4 stars.  The broth reminds me of Santa Ramen in San Mateo... and I was expecting more.  It was creamy and flavorful, but just didn't have the punch of some of the places in the bay area I'm use to.   The condiments were okay with the chashu also okay.   Oh well...maybe my next trip back i'll find the famed Ramen place people rave about in LA....this wasn't it. Good but not great.

2 words: dipped. ramen. HEAVENNNNN. I haven't had dipped ramen since being in japan and never thought I would ever have a chance to have it again. My friend mentioned that this restaurant actually had it, I knew I needed to try. My friend invited me to come see his friend perform in jtown so we decided to grab dinner in the area before going. Although the wait for the place took around an hour it was WORTH it. I believe they have two types of dipped ramen: Kichi-Men and Tsukemen. I personally tried the Kichi-Men and it was delicious, but I wasn't a HUGE HUGE fan of the broth. Ramen was cooked to perfection and I loved the stuff I could add to my soup on the side. Anxious to come back and try the other flavor now! nom nom nom!

Very simply: my favorite place to eat in all of LA and possibly the world.  Having been to Japan, I mean it when I say this place has the best tasting tonkotsu ramen as well as chahan (fried rice) I've ever experienced.  I know people complain about the line outside the door to get in but, believe me, stick it out and you will not regret it. Honestly, sitting in Daikokuya, particularly at the bar, is like sitting a real ramenya in Japan.  Everything down the smallest detail is authentic.   Do yourself a giant favor and eat here!

Yeah. Best ramen house in the area for sure.. Good quantity. Whole egg, alot of pork alot of soup and alot of noodles. Price is pretty good, I've tried alot of ramen houses in LA and this is my favorite thus far. oh i forgot, its ridiculously delicious The only problem is the wait, godam it can go up to two hours, atleast 30 minutes so make sure you write your name down and just go look around for like 30 minutes and pray that they call ur name when you come back lol. Honestly I HATE noodles, just empty calories... stupid carbs, but the taste of the soup and the pork here, makes me wanna come back for more, easy five for me.

Came here last night expecting some amazing ramen and broth. Granted we waited about 1 1/2 hours. I thought the Gyoza was prob the star of my whole entire meal. The ramen was cooked a little more on the al dente side (I prefer it cooked more through), the broth I was just OK. I had to add a lot of vinegar to give it more flavor. The Gyoza was made differently than what I am used to. It came out as kind of a big block. You just need to separate the pieces. The ponzu sauce that came along with it compliments it very well. Overall, if I am in the area and want ramen I would go back but NOT if I have to wait that long again. Id rather go to Shin Sen Gumi in OC.

Yes it's as busy as a whore house in jail, yes the wait can be up to 2 hours long, yes the food is worth it. Don't be a wierdo and come to Daikokuya and not order the ramen. Feel free to get things on the side but you must, you must have the namesake ramen. It is delicious, the fatty pork just melts in  your mouth, the ramen stays firm while swimming and absorbing the tasty tonkatsu broth. You do have to deduct a star for the lude wait time, and limited amount of space. The food however, makes up for it and is simply top notch. Insider tip. If you want to get in as soon as possible, come on your own. The bar seating almost always has a single chair open. Large groups beware.

Is there a better way to follow up a visit to the Murakami exhibit on a cold, gloomy day than to indulge in a bowl of ramen at Daikokuya?  If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know! The wait for a seat wasn't too, too bad, even though when I got there, I was #21 and the number being called was #5.  I attribute that to all the people who signed up for a table who ended up leaving because they didn't want to wait.  So, thanks! The boyfriend and I sat at the counter.  Unfortunately, there's no place to hang your purse or your coat, so keep that in mind if you carry a humongous purse.  I do like sitting at the counter so I can watch the food being prepared.  It amused me to see the cook using a timer to make the ramen noodles. We ordered the fried spicy tuna as an appetizer, and it was delicious.  The tuna is wrapped in a shiso leaf, then dipped in tempura batter and fried, and it comes with a small dish of salt in which to dip it.  I just squeezed a little lemon juice over it and, mm-mm . . .  Delicious! As for the ramen, this was exactly what I was craving on a chilly day!  The broth was so flavorful, and even though I'm not usually into eating pork, I couldn't help but savor every slice as it melted in my mouth.  The noodles were perfectly cooked (must be that timer), and the seasoned hard boiled egg was great (how do they season that egg, anyway?).  It made me so happy to slurp away at my noodles. Oh, and I didn't mention earlier, but we got our food just in time!  Shortly after we started eating, the power went out on the entire block.  That didn't stop the guys behind the counter from cooking, though.  One had a flashlight in hand as they feverishly worked to complete the orders that were already put in.  Now that's devotion. Sadly, those customers who had not yet been seated or hadn't put in their orders were told that they couldn't be guaranteed service until the power went back on.  Yikes!  I felt bad for them, but so very glad I got my ramen when I did, heh heh heh. Daikokuya is definitely worth the wait.

Very tasty, firm ramen at a good price. I love that there were tons of green onions in mine, but this may be a turnoff for some people. Speaking of turnoffs, there was a lot of fat floating in the container when i went to eat my leftovers the next day =( Went on a Saturday night at about 7, waited for an hour...don't come with a large group (more than 4 or 5).

review #795, I'm sure I won't say anything new. We tried to go on Friday night, but the wait for just two of us was over an hour long, so we went to the sushi joint across the street, which was awesome. I don't remember their name, so I'm piggybacking reviews. On Sunday just before we left LA we tried again to get my man's favorite crunchy pork ginger noodles. Oh, dear god it was worth the wait. I had the tempura bowl, and we shared bites of each. WOW. Delicious, humongous dishes, filling and CHEAP. Totally worth it. Go. Now. Have some for me.

You never fully appreciate a good thing until it's already gone:  that's how I feel about Daikokuya.  IS IT GONE?  NO!!  But I am.  I moved away and I miss eating there. The ramen is about as good as you're going to find outside Japan; I'd come here with friends I grew up with in Japan, and we all agreed it's just the best.  The soup is cooked for hours and hours, with pork bones and kurobuta bleeding flavor out into the soup.   It's just about the busiest restaurant in Little Tokyo if you hit it any time other than 3-4pm or so.  Before or after, you've caught the lunch and dinner rushes and should expect a 20 to 30 minute wait (which is well worth it). They also serve a mean katusdon -- big pieces of cutlet, great sauce.

After so much hype, I gave this place a try on a weekday afternoon. Due to the timing, I didn't have to deal with the wait most gripe about. They moved the tables quickly by offering fast and friendly service, not by rushing you and handing you a bill mid-bite. Much appreciated. Portions are large, and prices are very fair... but unfortunately, the ramen broth was much too salty for my taste. Perhaps I got the bottom of the barrel but I took my soup to go.. diluted it with an equal portion of water.. and only then did I find it perfect. However, they give you a soft-boiled egg which I love. No mushy yellow-gray paste for me! The pork fried rice is delicious (still think SF's Katanya does it better) and they definitely don't skimp on the fish egg rice but the ramen... meh.

Short and quick because there's already 200+ reviews for this place: Expect a wait. We (a party of 4) were seated in about 40 minutes on a Saturday night. Come hungry. The combination (ramen and rice bowl) is more than enough, even for tubbies like myself. The restaurant has an awesome old school "feel." Maybe it's the layers of grease caked on the ceilings and awning. Can't blame them, all that airborne pork fat that gets cooked out has to go somewhere. I wish someone would make everlasting gobstoppers in daikoku ramen flavor. Equally salty, oniony and rich with braised pork fat. ***EDIT 3/31/08*** I went yesterday to stuff my face silly with that yummy ramen and it didn't taste as delicious as the first time I had it. It's still a fantastic bowl of soup, but I really do think that Santouka's is better -- there's something a little more rich about their broth. On the flip side, I got to sit at the bar this time and watch the cooks put everything together. Cute Japanese guys with dinner -- that's still a winning combo in my book. 4 stars.

As a Ramen concier, eatting in various ramen places around the Bay Area, we dropped what So Cal people call "The Ramen spot to hit" near Japantown in LA Why is Daikoku not so special ? 1) Ramen was nothing special I couldn't find in the supermarket. (I saw bags of premade ramen like I can find in Ranch 99, oh, I mean 99 Ranch). 2) Soup base was not salty at all. (Guess that's a good thing?) I personally prefer the soup base like Santa Ramen in San Mateo. 3) Noodles overshadow the portion of meat given. Not a lot of meat was provided.. com'on 4) I asked for no hard boiled egg, yet the still gave me one. 5) A handful of green onions (scallions) WTF! Totaly over powering the taste if anything. 6) The queue - Waited in line for over 60 mins to get into the place and another 30 mins to get the food onto the table. 6) Checking out - Took us another 15 mins to get the bill. By that point, we paid in cash and bailed. Overall experience was exactly what Yelp says "Meh. I've experienced better" We came on a Friday afternoon around lunch time so that could have contributed to the extra wait. Good experience, but not my cup of ramen...

Very good ramen, I must say... but unfortunately, it's right down the street from a far superior Orochon Ramen.   Whenever I go here, I make sure I order their fried rice.  Honestly, the fried rice is more than enough reason to visit this spot.  Beyond that, the service is pretty on point, even considering how crowded this place usually is at 11pm!   It's not very big-group friendly, seating parties of 5 or fewer.  Oh well, bring 4 (or fewer!) of your friends and try out their fried rice.  You won't regret it.  While you're at it, have their ramen.  It is quite good too.

Probably my favorite ramen place in the states. Caution: as perhaps 1250 or so people have already warned before me, this place gets PACKED. It's a small, hole-in-the-wall establishment on First between Central and Alameda, and parking can be 'that one problem Jay-Z didn't have' at times. Order the kotteri ramen along with any of the rice dish combinations. It's a steal. Even if you aren't in the mood for a rice meal, pack that ish' out to go and plan yourself a nice leftovers breakfast. Personally, I'm all over their katsu-don bowl, since it's made the 'authentic' Japanese way of soft-frying an egg over the already-fried Katsu cutlets. Come here during off-peak hours and have a jolly good time.

This by far is my favorite ramen place in Little Tokyo.  I can't believe I waited so long to try ramen.  I was in my pho stage for so long, I didn't see anything but pho, even in my dreams. Get ready for long lines at Daikokuya especially around dinner time.  The wait is definitely worth it.  I can't stress enough how delicious the broth is and I love the service. You get what you want quickly and it's hot and fresh.  If you sit at the counter, you can actually see the cooks making your food.  Poor guys, it has to be 100 degrees plus back there.   I'll stop my review here, just go out and try it.

When you think Ramen in LA, this is one of the few places that comes to mind. When I had jury duty in down town I came here everyday. It's nice that they opened up a shop in Monterey Park which I actually prefer. Dunno why everyone complains about the wait there when the wait here is just as long. Make sure your whole party is there are they won't seat you at either place. Anyway, as good as their ramen is their shredded pork rice bowl shouldn't be taken lightly either. Came with 4 coworkers and the 3 that had been there all go the Ramen combo with shredded pork bowl. Anyway, I decided to try their NEW Kichi-men this time. Here's was they have to say about it. Picture (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) Kichi-men ($8.50) - a Little bit spicy, a little bit sour. The taste emphasizes Daikokuya soup. Put shredded dry seaweed on the noodles. The shredded chashu pork will softly melt when you put it in the soup... This is the new version of dipping style Daikokuya Tsukemen It's actually pretty good. Would make for a nice summer dish when you don't want your soup too hot. Just a hint of spice and sour flavor, nothing over welling, but the shredded chashu sadly does not melt in your soup, or so I'm told since I don't eat meat. Ok, I know now your thinking how is a guy who doesn't eat meat ok with drinking pork broth. I'm just am, ok! Anyway, I tried the "Kotteri" Style once (yeah I bet your scratching your head now, why would a guy who doesn't eat meat order the extra "back fat" version, I just did ok!) it taste really good but warning, I didn't finish that day and took some of the soup home.... that congealed fat when it cools down is pretty gross! Don't think I'm saying it's gross cause I don't eat meat anymore, I've eat a fair share of animals in my day (at least 32 i think) Anyway, if you're going with a friend, I recommend grabbing one ramen bowl and shredded pork bowl and sharing instead of a combo(which is full ramen and half size rice bowl). That's partly why I prefer the Monterey Park location because they let you order a half portion of each. Food: 4 Service:3 (we had 5 people and they wouldn't let us take the bar even when it had 5 spaces available, they seem to make up new rules about seating ever time we go - see pic of "Golden Rule of Diakokuya"  - http://www.yelp.com/biz_…

Pro's: It's all good. Con's: The wait. If you get there after 7, you'll have to wait a while. We usually try to go there before we're hungry, because by the time we get seated we will be. If you want ramen that has great broth and a great soft boiled egg, this is the place to go. I usually get their Daiokukya ramen with their shreded pork bowl combo. Not only is their ramen great, but their rice dishes are equally great. The pork just melts in your mouth, albeit, I think they add a little too much green onions sometimes, its still good. Overall, I come here whenever I'm in little tokyo.

The best ramen I ever ate in the US. Their noodle is heavy, but, great soupd. Once you chew the noodle into your throat, the tase of soup spread throughout your mouth. If you want to bring your friend who doesn't want to eat noodle, you can convince them to come because they also have Fried Noodle and combination "bento" (lunch box) combo, and rice dishes such as Teriyaki Chiken Bowl, and Sashimi Bowl.

Yes, I've seen the long line many times passing by and I'm definitely a fan of Japanese Ramen! I was lucky enough not having to wait for our table the very first time I visited Daikokuya. It was a raining evening, and since a good friend of mine works in Downtown, so we decided to meet right after work for an early dinner at 6pm, the place is not crowded as usual, heehee... so waiting time is not a factor of my rating like some of the other yelpers here. I ordered the Fried Spicy Tuna as appetizer (ground spicy tuna wrapped in a shino leaf and fried in tempura batter) and the specialty Daikokuya Ramen with extra green onion (I'm a green onion freak!). Service were fine and speedy. The Fried Spicy Tuna were fresh and tasty, the shino leaf paired perfectly with spicy tuna, very aromatic. My ramen was very yummy as well. I thought it was very well portioned, not an huge bowl but def. not small. The ramen itself were delicious, one of the best I've had. But the soup were on the salty side I thought, very similar to the ramen I've had in Japan (Ramen in Japan were all on the salty side to me when I visited), so I guess you could say it's very authentic! Overall, I give it 4 stars because I wasn't impressed (maybe my expectations were too high after seeing the lines previously). Next time I'd go for the combo (Ramen + fried rice or various rice bowl) for a couple of bucks more. Most ppl do as I overlooked the other tables, and their rice bowls looked awesome! Oh, and don't forget to order your beer. There's something about beer and ramen, just simply can't do without =)

There is almost always a long line here, and for good reason - there's some pretty good ramen here. It's a very rich pork broth, excellent noodles, and an underrated tasty whole egg. The broth is made from kurobuta pork....can't beat that.  They also have an appetizer with this work that is worth a try. Not everyone knows that there's actually a large size that you can order - if you're hungry, give it a go. The rice dishes are quite good as well, but its hard to stray away from the ramen.

The best ramen I've ever had. I used to think ramen was just instant noodles that came in a pack! But, after trying Ajisen, Mitsuwa Ramen, I stumbled upon Daikokuya after hearing great things. The menu doesn't have a lot of things on it, but it's simple, and to the point. You can't go wrong with the house specialty. It also came with a side bowl of sashimi + rice! All in all, great value for what you pay for. The lines can get really long, especially since the restaurant is not large at all, but it's definitely worth the wait. Maybe not all the time, but waiting around once in awhile is okay by me. (Btw, my party and I waited for about 1 hour... maybe a little longer. Advice: Come early to avoid the wait!) The texture and consistency of the noodles was just right. Not too soft, not too al-dente, and definitely tasted very fresh. The broth was not too heavy, or greasy, but it may be a bit too salty for my personal preference. Service is really good too!

Honestly, I didn't even care for ramen until I came to daikokuya. While my other half would crave ramen on the reg, I would always pass on the oppurtunity to eat it. That is until I tried Daikokuya. Now I'm obsessed with ramen, well more like, obsessed with Daikokuya! I'm obsessed with the ramen, the gyoza, the tuna sashimi bowl. Seriously, I need to order all three everytime I come. It's THAT good! Love love love this place! It's so totally worth the wait!

Again and again I always come here... Maybe it's the aroma of the ramen smelling it from across the street, or it's just me.. I haven't tried the one in Costa Mesa yet.. I've tried the one in Monterey Park, they need to work on the broth.. Hacienda Heights ramen is kinda on the salty side but okay... In Little Tokyo, they always hit the spot, never fails.. I don't care about the long line, it's all worth it when you have that first taste on their authentic noodles.. I see other ramen or sushi places around the area but I get hypnotized and lured to place every time.. Daikokuya in Little Tokyo never lets me down for some yummy ramen..

I feel insignificant writing this review since this place has SO MANY ALREADY. Jeebus, that number speaks for itself! I didn't have to read a single review to know that I had to try this place. Now I kind of wish I did. Yes, the news is true; there is only ONE type of ramen on the menu. My biggest decision of the night was choosing ramen over tsukemen (I mean, you DIP the noodle in the sauce how crazy is that?!), but my friend told me they're essentially the same broth, so meh, maybe next time tsukemen! The broth is so full-bodied and flavorful and the noodles are cooked to perfection: what's the Japanese word for al-dente? Whatever, these noodles were al-dente, I loved it!!! I LOVED THE NOODLES! Broth was good too, but the noodles! Since I'm a ramen newbie, I cannot say that Daikokuya is the best ramen I have ever tasted, but I can say this: it's DIFFERENT from any other ramen I have tasted. As for toppings and such, I appreciated the egg but I had hoped for more delicious chasu slices (the ones at Orochon literally melt in my mouth). Anyways, I doubt even a 1 star rating from me would dent the ALMOST TWO THOUSAND REVIEW RATING OF FOUR STARS.

Bottom line... it's not worth the wait. Over an hour wait, on a good day, for mediocre ramen just does not deserve 5 or even 4 stars. If you truly LOVE ramen and not just "love" as in "I've been to few ramen places in the US", then this place is outright disappointing. And for those who say "BEST RAMEN I'VE EVER HAD," you really need to go to Japan for the real stuff. Because in short, this place is overrated and WAY too hyped up. Breaking it down: The portion and ratio of ramen to meat/toppings extra is a joke, there are like a slice and a half of chashu to almost two jumbo serving sizes or just noodles (way to make Americans feel like we're "getting our money's worth). The soup is bland and watered down (AND I EVEN GOT THE EXTRA FLAVOR TONKOTSU), and the noodles are just plain. On top of that, the chashu appetizer was so dry and tasteless, in Japan any ramen shop you walk into on the street can beat that, and no wait too. The best thing here, in my opinion was the salad, but how can you go wrong with cabbage salad with sesame dressing. Sadly it was the closest thing that reminded me of the amazing food I had in Japan while studying abroad there. In short, if you truly want good ramen, go to Japan, if not, then save your precious time by not going here.

Came here with some relatives from Nor Cal and ended liking this place, a lot. My aunt and cousin ordered the ramen with some side dishes and they really liked the soup of the ramen. I ordered the bento with some tuna and chicken teriyaki. The side orders came together on a separate plate and the rice came later in a bowl. The tuna was delicious as well as the chicken teriyaki. The difference was that the teriyaki sauce came on the side so you could dip as much teriyaki as you wanted with the chicken. Brother ended up ordering the chicken bowl and it came in a big bowl. He really liked the meal but could not finish it. The wait was long but worth it.

For me the best ramen in LA can be found here.   The broth is savory without being overly heavy.  The noodles have a decent firmness, I think I would prefer it just a touch harder.   The real standout here is the chashu which comes from Kurobota (Berkshire) pig stock.  The meat is so flavorful, fatty, and tender; it redefines chashu for me. Go on sunday for a late night treat as Daikokuya is open from "12:00PM - until the soup is gone"

After reading about this place on http://rameniac.com I checked it out.  I ordered the house ramen.  The soup base was decent, i can say I've had better.  The ramen noodle was really good, and the marinated egg was delicious.   The house decorations inside are very antique looking.  They have mangas to read while to wait for the food. If you go in around 3 pm on a weekday there are good chances of not having to wait long.  The parking situation is bad, try to find street parking or pay 5-8 for lot parking.

Definitely, hands down, the best ramen joint I've been to in California. I dream about the broth. The creamy, flavorful broth with chewy egg noodles. A non-pork eating friend said the chicken teriyaki bowl was the best he'd ever had. I can't imagine dreaming about chicken teri, but he has. Cute old Japanese ad posters decorate the wall & there's manga while you wait. Oh yes, the wait. Plan your visit to avoid typical eating hours or else you can get stuck for a while. As the sign on the front says- they close when they run out of broth. Fortunately though, they make vats of it and its usually open later than anything else in the area (2am?). Slurp Slurp.

So one of my closest and awesomest (if there is such a word...lol) and I had lunch here for some good ramen.  I have never been here, yet she has on a couple of occasions, and trust me, this place was bomb.   PROS:  Ramen was awesome...very good portion, quick service, friendly staff, and very moderate prices. CONS: The wait was a bit long, but I wouldn't be surprised...if the food tastes so good, there's no question why there would be a long wait.   If there's someone out there that has not had ramen before, or hasn't had good ramen for ages, you gotta try this place.  I would definitely go back very soon!

Came here today with my kid cousin. I've always wanted to try this place since I've been to a few other places on the same block. This has got to be by far the best Ramen there is something diffrent about its broth its milky and slightly creamy. It's defintely soemthing that is worth comming back to. My cousin and I had the combinations. He had it with Salmon Roe over rice I had a Oyakodon. Salad was ok. Ramen really great. The think that took it over the top for me was the Oyakodon. I've been searching far and wide in Ktown, Little Tokyo, Alhambra and everywhere else in between for a place that does oyakodon correctly and this is it! Egg simmered correctl;y with chicken then topped over rice. The bowl, rice and egg ratio perfect. The egg covered the entire bowl not like at some places across the street it felt like it was just all thrown together but here its actually a complete meal and a decent item on the menu not an afterthought. We sat at the end of the bar big mistake since you are right beside where the waitstaff wait so durring the whole meal i felt like they were watching and making fun of me eat my noodles. I dont know if its true but just try sitting there and you'll know how felt. It was kind of a cross between a Vietnames Cafe and Korean place since with every sip i took of the water a hand would come out from behind to add more. I liked it since service was prompt but it kinda felt like they were hovering over me.

I hope nobody dares to try sushi here.  When walking by I often see it packed.  The crowd is mostly young or out of towners; the less experienced.  The young that can eat and digest anything.  Visitors to try out the local color.  As for me .. working around downtown over ten years ... this ramen house is a health outbreak waiting, lurking in the broth.  I'm surprised the health inspector hasn't completely shut it down; the dirty restrooms, food containers near the floor ( aaachoo! just like that ), smells .. like Dodger bathroom stalls and greasy walls / roofs.  That stupid vent rattling away over head.  Its not cool or "atmosphere".  No, nn,nonono ... When it first opened, the ramen top notch.  Now its just neglected, drifting around the currents, and collecting rust.

The Hiyashi Chuka cold noodles with sesame dressing hit the spot.  Cool and refreshing, it almost made me forgot I was sitting in front of two large simmering vats.  Then the Sapporo draughts made sure I did.   Outside, the sun had already dipped midway below the steel and glass of downtown high-rises.  Their mirrored surfaces set ablazed in golden light.  By the time I reached the car, their glows had already dimmed by some.  Time to make distant,  I sped toward the 101 and disappeared into the tributaries of LA freeways.

What can be said that the other *1500+* reviews have said? Yes - there's a LONG LONG WAIT. Yes - this place is as big as a shoe box. Yes - this place is known for the Ramen. In short - It's worth the wait. Yes, get the Koteri "More flavah" Ramen. I would recommend getting a snack BEFORE eating here - because of the wait, or find another activity to do in the meanwhile. The fried tuna rolls were also very delicious. FH and I are going to return - and wait in the line, and leave completely satisfied. Yum yum - and bring your patience. It's completely worth it.

I've heard of this popular LA Ramen house for years.  I finally got to step in this Ramen house full of Japanese Pop Culture icons and signs emulating me as if I just booked a trip to Japan.   YOU MUST SIGN IN at the front, they have a little clipboard, on the chair, DO NOT FORGET TO DO THIS OR YOU WILL NOT BE COOL LIKE EVERYONE ELSE THERE!!!!! Go in, stare at the vintage Japanese signs, they are pretty awesome.  They call your name, WARNING this place is a huge hipster hang out, so it gets crowded, so be patient. please.   Ok! the Staff is very nice and friendly, they also just make it very simple to order, you get the house ramen, and seriously it's really great, I was even brave enough to try the egg, so yummy! :D Also the food is pretty quick, so you are not in there to long, but the portions are fair, and the broth is so good! very tastey, and thick, soft noodles, yummy onions, just a great blend of flavors for you palette, and yes the soup is hot. :D The Noodles great, NOT too soggy and not too crunchy.  I will definitively be coming back to this place. It was inviting, and they had some Enka music playing in the background. :D SO CHECK IT!!!! it really is worth the wait!

We, a party of three, arrived on a weekday evening. I believe it was Thursday. Signed into a waiting list. Never been one for a line that doesn't involve the word "buffet" in it. Not sure how long we waited, though it was long enough for me to blacked out for a while (no, not really). This isn't the first time I've gone to this restaurant, though it isn't because of me. My cousin raves about their ramen broth, though he isn't brave enough to drink it. More about the flavor than the broth itself, I suppose. This time around, I wasn't feeling for ramen. To be honest, the only ramen I tend to eat usually has "instant" in the title. Anyways, I ended up eating the salmon roe bowl. It sounded interesting (at the time) and I wanted something sushi-related. Running around $13, it included salad and miso soup. Unfortunately it wasn't sushi rice (or it wasn't GOOD sushi rice), and after a while, the salmon roes just becomes too much. Perhaps if there were some sashimi to diversify the tastes, it might have been a good combo, but by itself, it didn't seem worth it. So the rating is mainly about what I ordered. If I were to go again, during off-peak hours and in warmer conditions, would I give a better rating? Perhaps. The restaurant is in Little Tokyo, so you're in a good environment to check out the sites afterwards. There are museums and shops nearby. And if you're not into parking fees, take the metro gold line (which is what I did). I read there are other Daikokuyas in SoCal, and wonder if removing such an environment would help or hurt my reviews of those locations.

The ramen is delicious here. First, sign in on the clipboard the number of people in your group; Second, you are going to have to wait about 15, 30, 45 minutes depending on the time of the day and if you want a booth;  If you want a booth, let them know; the gracious waiters will circle your number; Third, you can wait outside or go visit Little Tokyo, there are many things to see...shops, Cosmos if you want a drink... I you decide to wait outside, wait to hear your number called; if you are adventurous and you walked around Little Tokyo, make sure to check the clipboard. Order the bowl of ramen.  For appetizers, the gyoza is great; the sausages; the shrimp tempura. Enjoy and kanpai!!

In my humble opinion, Daikokuya has found the formula to ramen done the right way:  the authentic Japanese way.  Maybe you find that claim to be offensive because you know of a better place.  I'm always open to some guidance.  But having lived in Japan for over 7 years, I think I've earned my right to rate a bowl of noodles! The thing I love about the noodles at Daikokuya is the heartiness and the inconsistencies of the kinks in the noodles.  Makes it also easier to grab a hold of.  Many places in the U.S. offer the thin, straight noodles, which they also offer in Japan, but I've found more restaurants to use the thicker egg noodles which they cook al dente.  Mmm.  It's a matter of preference, I suppose, and since it's my blog entry, I'm going with the al dente hearty egg kind! The second most important component in a bowl of noodles is the broth.  At Daikokuya, they make their broth from soy sauce and from boiling pork bones for almost 24 hours.  You can imagine the buttery divinity of the flavorful soup.  Not to mention, there are toppings you must add for the full effect:  grated garlic and hot chili oil.   Oh.  My.  Gosh.  Game over.  Go heavy on the garlic if you're not on a first date! Check out more pictures of the ramen and gyoza and tuna rice bowl on my blog!!

I thought I would add to the behemoth amount of reviews with my two cents. We have been living a few blocks away from Daikokuya for about a year now and have frequently driven by to see hordes of people waiting, at all hours of the day, outside. We would scoff and then go to Mr. Ramen or Orochon instead, not wanting to wait what looked like one or two hours just for a bowl of noodles (and I'm Asian, so I would do it). BUT....we just had to try. AND......we were hooked. So now, since I come home an hour before my husband and since we only live 2 blocks away, I stop by, put our name down and then go home and sit on my couch thinking about all those suckas waiting outside in that miniscule waiting room the size of a confessional. Then after an hour, my husband comes home and we go casually stroll and grab our table. Timing works out perfectly, no one gets hurt and no face time with my couch is taken away. All this chatter here about the noodle consistency is true. Its a perfect al dente that other ramens can only dream of. And their combo meals are insanely cheap and a great value. The pork belly bowl is the perfect thing to bring to work the next day and relive your Daikokuya fantasies. It's soft, aromatic, and tasty as hell. I usually order it along with my ramen, take a bite, and then bring it home. There's no way I can finish both, and I am carb's #1 fan. Would we wait an hour outside of Daikokuya to eat their noodles? Probably not.  But will we consider our exclusive ramen-perk when its time to renew our lease? Probably.

I would give this location 5 stars, but the wait time when I go to this place won't let me. There are several other locations where the wait isn't as bad, but this is like the main location where everyone goes. The ramen here is amazing as always. I suggest getting the combination meal. If you don't want to wait in a line for over an hour I suggest you don't go during the lunch and dinner rushes. Since I only go during those times I cannot suggest a good time to go where there is no wait. But any of the Daikokuya locations are a must go.

Three stars isn't really fair, because the food is good.  But the expectations for this place based on the wait and reviews make it almost impossible to deliver. I made it before the lunch rush (eating alone) so I didn't have to wait, but people who came after me did. Service was fine and the food was good, but for the price and hype, it's nothing special.  Unless they use some kind of high quality ingredients that I'm not aware of, and I will say I felt fine after eating the ramen and drinking a bunch of broth (which isn't true for lower quality ramen restaurants). Really, the only knock is the price and wait, Orochon is just as good and I think a little bit cheaper.

Best ramen in LA! Make sure you add the Kotteri (back fat) to your broth. WHO DOESN'T LOVE BACK FAT?! Mmmmm! Huge bowl for a good price. Line sucks as the joint is very small with limited seating. I've tried to strategize by coming at random times of the day, it doesn't matter, this place is ALWAYS busy.....but worth it! p.s. don't be an asshole and try to roll deep, they can't really accommodate parties larger than 5.

I love ramen, along with pretty much every noodle I've ever met, but I'm no ramen connoisseur, unlike some of the other Yelpers here. So here's an opinion from your average noodle-loving chow-hound: I thought the broth was excellent: rich, flavorful and not too salty. The noodles were the perfect consistency, neither tough nor flabby. Those are by far the most important ingredients. The famous marinated egg is fine, I guess, and there was just the right amount of bamboo shoots, bean sprouts and green onion. My one complaint: I found the sliced pork, while tender, to be much too fatty and left most of it in the bowl. One of my dining companions ordered the rice bowl with eel, and it was the most generous portion of bbq eel I've ever seen. We also shared a spicy tuna roll, which was very good. Finally, even though the place wasn't that busy (there were 2 parties ahead of us on a Wednesday at noon), we had to wait an extra 5 minutes to be seated after a booth emptied because no one bothered to bus the table. You'd think that with people standing in the door waiting for a table they'd be in a hurry to get you seated. Apparently not.

.                 Super:     Pork topping, shouts flavor, flavor flavor!          Good:     Noodles.              OK:     Soup.    Not good:    Green onion topping. Nice package overall. One of the decent ramen you can get around LA area.  The texture of the noodles is on the hard side and doesn't soften quickly (how I like it). The soup was ok, packs a deep flavor on first few sips (this time it was not so salty like I had a few years ago). Towards the bottom of the bowl the flavor starts to become somewhat monotonous and bland (I didn't use any condiments, just as it came, I will add stuff to it the next time and see if I can enjoy it to the last drop).  Their pork is still ultimo flavorful, makes the ramen and makes my day. The pork portion is mucho skimpy compared to when they first opened but the flavor is very much alive.  The ramen I had today had a bit too much chopped green onions on top. This is not a bad thing (I like green onion ramen also with tons on top) but it didn't work with this ramen; it interfered with the taste of the noodles. The green onion was on the coarse side, kind of hard as if overgrown.  I like the interior touches such as the old posters and old signs that appear to be genuine (with rust and all).    Friendly staff, but... they look tired, are the same folks working 7 days a week? Reminded of a saying we have at my work place: You can work 12hrs a day, but if you continue this you'll get the same output/efficiency as an 8-10hr work day from the 12hrs.    They reminded me of people who worked too much overtime, felt like I saw hazy fog around them, following them and not allowing them to clear the tables fast enough, etc. (a lot of customers on the waiting list left as the wait was long).

Ever been to a restaurant where the anxiety level is palpable?  Well... this is one such place because everyone is anxiously awaiting a table or bar stool... waiting... waiting... I went on a weekday during lunch hours... luckily I wasn't in a rush so I was able to wait a half hour. And worth it.... it was. Great flavored ramen that really hit the spot. The noodles were approriately firm and thin. I agree with the previous comments on the spiciness. Not adjusted... I had to hit the red pepper shaker a few times... then before I knew it... beads of sweat collecting on my forehead. Awwww... happiness... next thing I knew, I was finishing my bowl, wiping my forehead, then blowing my nose in tissue for good measure. One happy man I was :)

Come here EARLY or else there will be a long line. We got here right after it opened for lunch and was lucky cuz the place was happening when we left. We decided to try a bit of everything: Salad: Although the greens weren't much to write home about (just shredded iceberg lettuce and some stalks of julienned carrots I believe ) but their dressing is soooo savory! I love the salad dressing from most Japanese restaurants but this one had that extra kick to it...big onion flavor! Unlike anything I've ever had before. Apparently they don't sell it in individual bottles anymore so if you want some, you'll have to have it in store. Small chicken egg bowl: Typical donburi with egg and chicken and on the sweet side, how I like it. Gyoza: Was pretty typical. Nothing extraordinary but still good. Daikoku Ramen: Great soup base. The noodles could've been thicker and chewier but I still slurped up my bowl like no other. I did feel like they were a bit skimpy on the ingredients and my bf noted that the pork slices were on the thin side (they have nothing on Santa!). I'd come here again but my ramen favorites still reside in NorCal.

Don't let the B rating scare you, it is after all, an old building. There are several Ramen restaurants off of First street in J-town. But it seems as though just about everyone there at the JA Museum seem to try to crowd into this particular noodle house.  A 2007 winner of some fancy LA WEEKLY award, plus its been around for a while.  Since it's busy, there is no reservations, and you have to wait a while to be seated. We waited about 30 minutes after leaving our name on the list. Their websites explains the soup process for their Ramen. Daikokuya has other dishes other than ramen, worth to experiment. We ordered the shiso-wrapped spicy tuna which is deep fried. The spicy tuna isn't very spicy at all. It's very light, but for me the shiso makes the flavor. My meal came with Miso-soup and a salad. The salad wash delicious, thin sliced cabbage/lettuce/carrots combo with a tasty dressing of which I can't decipher. Unfortunately, the miso was on the bland side, and served warm, which makes the soup taste mediocre. I think that the soup didn't have hondashi in it, as misoshiru needs to have. I ordered the tempura bowl. The tempura batter was lightly greasy as it should be and included 3 shrimp, and eggplant, green beans, one big onion slice, white sweet potato, and  a carrot all over rice. The sauce was light, sweet and salty like my mother's tempura sauce. There isn't a thick layer of teriyaki sauce over the tempura as other restaurants do. The rice was not doused in sauce, so that I can still taste the rice. I thoroughly enjoyed my dish. My sister ordered a combo ramen and chicken bowl. It's a great value considering how much food you'll get.  She is a ramen eater, and left no ramen leftovers, but took home her chicken, a strategic move as ramen doesn't take out well. I'd say from her satisfied look, the ramen was perfect. Something about the soup, add flavors to ramen, that otherwise is boring. Another person in our group ordered the bento meal with tonkatsu (panko crusted pork.) Katsu is supposed to be golden brown, and hers appeared to be over-fried or that their oil was old. Either way, she didn't finish it, but took it home. She said it tasted fine.   Overall, the menu is simple, perhaps the restaurant has become too busy to cook all the other dishes properly. However, deal with the wait, be ready to order, and get a Ramen combo. The food comes quickly once you order. I can recommend Daikokuya because of the warm, cozy and crowded atmosphere and friendly service.  If you're a vegetarian, you might want to avoid this place since you'd only be able to order a cucumber roll. Update: 4/14/08 I saw a Daikokuya in Costa Mesa Marukai. I didn't sample the food, and the staff was ill-informed. But the just opened up.

Really? Is this really worth all the hype? I hope this is isn't the best ramen LA has to offer because if so, then the west coast is missing out. It's not bad, but really nothing special either. Pros: Open late Friendly service Cute old timey Japanese diner decor nicely cooked al-dente ramen Good pork belly Cons: Long wait Soup flavor is mediocre at best toppings are not impressive and sparse kitchen is not as clean as most japanese owned establishments Parking a total pain

I've been to Daikokuya about 6-7 times these past two months, and every visit was worth it. Their ramen is the best I've had so far. Try the ramen with a Calpico soda, and 10 bucks should cover tax and tip. I've also tried the fried rice combinations and all that, but the ramen is filling enough. The other stuff here is nothing to rave about. Just order the ramen. :) Be prepared for a 15-20min wait at night. Go during the day! You can walk off your full stomach, visiting the shops in little tokyo. Visit the anime figure store. Grab some gelato or mochi ice cream. Take weird pictures at the wanna-be Stonehenge thing outside the community center. Visit Nijiya Market and grab a Nigori Sake for the night. Perfect day. *edit - Last two visits, the broth tasted totally different. It was BAD. I think sometimes they screw up on the broth. minus one star from the 5.

With over 400 reviews, there's not much new to be said.  It's one of my favorite ramen spots in L.A. (and definitely the fave in Little Tokyo/downtown area -- great sobering up food after a barhop too).  There's always a wait, but it's almost always worth it, though I personally wouldn't linger if it looks like it'll take more than 45 minutes. I always get the ramen here (occasionally kotteri style, with a richer broth made from adding more pork fat in the soup!) though I've been meaning to try the tsukemen soon too. Avoid the rice bowls, they're not bad but not particularly outstanding either -- and who goes to Daikokuya to eat anything BUT noodles? Service is fast and no-nonsense, and repeated hollerings may be needed for certain requests like drink refills. Also, they no longer do take-out orders, so gotta put up if the wait if you wanna enjoy the noodles.

I don't know much about ramen (at least not the kind you pay more than $.50 for at 99 Ranch).  So walking in, I had very little expectations.  I knew from the reviews and the long lines that this place was popular, so I figured this was the best place to go to after waiting an hour to snap a quick photo with Mike Shinoda, but I digress.... The restaurant was nasty hot on Friday night.  There was hardly any circulation inside.  But my friend and I got a table within 15 minutes of putting our names down.  Great news since the line grew shortly after that. Neither of us knew what to order so we went with the "safe" popular dish - their specialty ramen.  Plus, we ordered the roast pork appetizer.  Mmmm.  Both were very satisfying.  The noodles tasted very fresh.  I like them firm and indeed, that's what I got.  The broth was intensely flavorful, but I couldn't get myself to finish it.  It was waaaaaaaaaay too hot inside. Overall, very satisfying.  Great place to people watch, too.  We saw a table full of Gym Class Heroes wannabes and upon walking into the restaurant, an angry, abrupt waitress stopped a customer just as he was about to walk out,  "DID YOU FORGET TO GIVE ME TIP?"  This kid with long hair, in an old T-shirt and long shorts played dumb and sheepishly responded, "Oh, we didn't leave it on the table?"  Meanwhile his crew was outside waiting, probably thinking, "F***, we got caught."   To the cute hapa waiter with the half shaved head, thanks for speaking in Japanese and giving me something to drool over.  I don't know what that man did to you on Friday night to get you so upset, but don't worry, there's something called karma.

OK, first things first.  Don't go late at night if you have only 5 minutes to live or have a plan to catch.  There is a wait.  The restaurant holds only about 40-50, no reservation, sign at the door.  None of this is bad, just full disclosure.  Now for the rest.  Yum.  We had the house ramen, one with eel, one with sashimi. Both the eel and tuna were served chirashi-style with sushi rice rather than plain white rice, nice touch.  Now to the ramen.  Many ramen places serve a thin broth with too few noodles (like they are expensive).  The bowls came large and chock full of goodies.  The broth is thick and hearty.  The pork was delicious.  Not overdone, not underdone. This place does one thing and does it well.  No udon, no fancy bowls.  Just ramen, damnfine ramen.

Well, I wasn't blown away.  After waiting for an hour, I was expecting more.  Sure, it was good.  But, best ramen in LA?  If that's the case, I am not impressed with the state of ramen in LA at all.  It's a pretty tasty broth, and the toppings were just what I liked.  The soup was nice & hot.  All in all, most things were pretty close to the mark.  But, an hour wait?  Folks, this place ain't that good.  Oh, and the noodles were al dente.  Very strange.  Better than mushy, but disappointing nonetheless. I guess, if I didn't have to wait an hour, I would have given it another star.  But, it just wasn't worth the wait.

Totally the best ramen in LA. have you ever been to a restaurant where the food you get looks _better_ than the menu pictures? well, know you know why there is a 1 hour + wait almost every single day. the thing that put this place over the top is their chicken teriyaki... i had it as a "small bowl" addition to the requisite dikoku ramen. it was the bomb dot com!! accompanies by little pickles of ginger... nom nom nom. please, diakokuya, must you be the best at everything you do? you're making the other folks look bad...

A bowl of ramen at Daikokuya is around ten dollars and consists of heaping servings of intoxicatingly rich, milky broth seasoned with special shoyu; perfectly-boiled noodles; not enough bamboo shoots for my taste; a generous sprinkling of finely-chopped scallion; and a boiled egg whose magic is not only in its velvety, still-sort-of-molten yolk but also in the firm yet soft white whose color has been tinged with a slight brown and is utterly indescribable. The thin slices of tender chashu pork finishi off the bowl. This is not the Shin Ramen you boil up with its fiery, MSG-laden soup packet at midnight after a bout of drunken hunger pains strikes; it's sophisticated yet down-home; subtle yet flavorful; and good in every way. We also had a donkatsu appetizer, which we saw being fried for a second time and served immediately to us, still crackling from its oil bath and crunchy on the outside, firm, tall and buttery on the inside. The katsu is perfect, but we both wished that the dipping sauce had been more flavorful. Daikokuya runs a tight ship: everything is ready-to-cook when you order, like the katsu, which is pre-fried to speed up the service (it probably also contributes to the crispness of the batter). Still, on a typical night you'll have to wait just like everyone else who puts down their name on the waitlist and huddles around the small restaurant, hoping to get in. We waited for an hour on a Tuesday night, and it's impossible to get a booth if you're a smaller party. A party of two will likely be relegated to the counter, which is entertaining in that one gets to witness the food prep, but it can get pretty sweltering. But it was worth the wait and heat for the awesome ramen we had that night.

Daikokuya in DTLA is one of the greatest ramen joints in all of Southern California. I remember when I first went in for a late lunch. When i walked it, it looked like i was in a time warp to post war Japan with many nostalgic advertisements and  movie posters around. Since it was a late lunch on a Friday, it wasn't as busy as it usually is. When we were seated, we were given our menus and after a few minutes, I ordered the ramen and an iced tea, and my friend just ordered a ramune. It took about 7 minutes or so to get my food out, but it was great. My first bite of ramen was the perfect firmness. The soup was rich but not overpowering to the noodles. The kurobuta pork was the most tender since I ate at Café Hiro and in Hawaii. The pork fat melted in my mouth. The egg was the perfect cooked-ness. When we finished, I was full, but i was still was craving more. I never in my life had ramen so good. i just wanted to wait and order another bowl, but with my wallet empty, we had to leave. That was in January, I've taken 2-3 people there since. Pros: -AMAZING RAMEN (as a whole) -Nice use of decor -You can see the food made -Good service -Awesome soup, pork and egg, Cons: -Very small, so the smaller the group, the better -No free parking, but it is DTLA -Waits can be really, really long at peak hours and nights -Kinda pricy ****1/4

I grew up in the north where the noodle is thick, miso flavor, with a lot of oil and fat on cha-shu.  So I have to tell you that my review is biased.  I'm not too into tonkotsu but it was pretty good.  Gyoza was ok.  The best thing about this place is the decor.  It is full of old Japanese posters and photos which was totally cool.  Oh one thing, I saw dirty things on the floor of the kitchen....I kinda question how clean this place is.  If you want a good, spicy ramen in the area, go to Orochon ramen.  If you want more authentic Japanese ramen, go to Santoka inside Mitsuwa in Gardena. *Food = pretty good for Tonkotsu *Service =average *Price = ok

To start, it is very probable that there will be a line or a handful of names on the wait-list. This does not deter me from coming here because it's just come to be expected due to the deliciousness. There is a lot to like about the place but I am more interested in focusing on the food. The ramen is by far one of my favorite ramens. The soup is delicious and portions are plentiful. The ramen combination is what I tend to order and for good reason. The side dishes are perfect compliments to the ramen, depending on what you like. The cabbage salad is light and fresh, the dressing is phenomenal and adds another level to the dish. I typically order the Unagi as a side and it is delectable. The ramen itself is great, the soup is perfect and will leave a taste you will soon crave. The pork is fine and succulent, the egg an unforgettable addition and vegetables make the ramen true to Japanese cuisine. Also a plus, is that it's all pretty affordable! Located in Little Tokyo, it is obvious that this place gets plenty attention, like I had mentioned above and nearly authentic in it's Japanese resemblance. Like another review of mine, I have brought both my brother and cousin from out of town to experience this restaurant and both have enjoyed the place, especially my cousin.

Sadly, my favorite ramen place is not as good as I remember it. It's been awhile since I've been to Daikokuya. Imagine my surprise when I sat down and was handed a big menu. Wasn't it like a one-sheet menu before? At least they didn't really change their combo specials. I ordered the same as my coworker, the ramen and shredded pork bowl combo. I knew I would never finish even half of that, but figured I could save the rest for lunch the following day. When asked if I also wanted the kotteri, I didn't know what they meant. I don't remember them offering it before, but they add extra pork fat into your broth. I am usually not one to shy away from fatty foods, so I said sure, bring it on. BIG mistake. About half an hour after I had the otherwise delicious ramen, my stomach was not happy. I guess there IS such a thing as too much fat. Other than that, I must say the broth was not as flavorful as it used to be. Adding extra pork fat does not make up for the intense pork flavor that used to be there. The noodles were still just as I liked, but the broth left something to be desired. The shredded pork bowl was delicious, tho. Too bad I was too full off of the extra-fatty broth to finish it! Still a solid ramen house, but -1 star for changing their recipe.

I know, I know. I should give them amazing ratings right? Because it's supposed to be THE place to get ramen. Well, I'm sorry, I didn't think their ramen was five star material and I have to dock a star for the extremely long wait. I guess it's something they can't control exactly-- but was just a load of wasted time! I think the ramen is good, but it's not in proportion to how long you wait. Yes, even if you avoid the main meal hours, you will wait. The ramen here is as good as it gets, they don't offer much else but you know go there for the ramen so who cares. I really liked the shredded pork, and they don't skimp on ingredients here. The broth is soothing, I remember thinking I'd want to stop by when I'm feeling a little under the weather or if there's cloudy weather. Wow, I'm so articulate. But you get it right? Anyway, I think they just lay everything out for you so you don't keep asking for stuff. Smart. Try to park in the street, it might seem impossible but you get lucky sometimes. And bring War and Peace.

not much left to say that hasn't already been said.  Its a flavorful broth  with a strong pork and somewhat smokey notes.  Had to put in our name on the list - and was called by number - not name when our table was ready.  Place is slightly dirty feeling  - but ramen was very good. will go back again.

The first time I had the pleasure of eating here was with a co-worker on a whim during one of our "field trips". Ever since then, I have NEVER BEEN ABLE TO STEP FOOT IN THIS RESTAURANT! Every time that I have tried, they were either too packed, closed, almost closing, or we were just too hungry to stand in line and wait. Nonetheless, from what I remember during my first visit, it was heaven. The soup was just right; Not too oily, not too salty, not too heavy. It was ramen love in my mouth!

When Drew and I were in LA we beelined here on Sunday afternoons. It was frigid and weird during the times we went, and the mere existent of Daikokuya got us out of bed. Steaming, hot broth, the smell of wok-fried rice, toasty, delicious green tea and nice servers in a cramped, tight space after waiting in the cold for nearly an hour. This is a most magical eatery offering only the most magical eating experience. This joint masters my three favorite things in life - handmade ramen noodles, katsudon, and fried rice. Yup. D and I are big fans of broth and noodles. the ramen here has this rich, salty, porky broth and perfectly chewy, long, handmade egg ramen noodles, and plenty of it. it's topped off with a few pieces of poached, flavorful, fatty pieces of pork and this amazing, braised egg where the white is cooked all the way through but the yolk is still a creamy, translucent yellow. And can't forget the abundance of green onions, that really give it the extra dimension of flavor. If this sounds magical, it is, and I haven't yet found ramen that sastisfies me like this anywhere in the US. Secondly, D and I have always been huge fans of the katsudon. We've been to a billion different joints in many different states that do it well, but none like this - you still get really crispy, lean, but JUICY thick katsu atop a bed of hot rice with softly, but thoroughly, cooked eggs, green onions, and sweet soy. The best bowl of katsudon we've ever consumed, and you can get a mini katsudon + ramen combo for like 10 bucks or something. Crazy. Third, I'm a bit of a fried rice whore. I lived in Korea as a youngster and became obsessed with koreanized/japanse Chinese food you can order and get delivered in a metal carry-out box. The fried rice here resembles the taste of those times, only better. It's perfectly seasoned, fried in a wok to perfection with nice pieces of pork, carrots, eggs, etc. The rice, to note, is always cooked to a perfection, and it's a wonderful accompaniment to my ramen noodle (the portion is rather generous for a small size - you can also get this as part of a combo with the ramen noodles if you wish). The service, while a bit scatter brained, is always dead on - they never skip a beat, and it's very friendly. The green tea is always delicious. I don't like to wait, but the wait is always worth the consistent quality of food and service, and I will make it a point to come back every time I am in town.

I'm Asian, but I don't like noodles. I don't like chow mein, lo mein, ramen, soba noodles, udon noodles... well, you get the point. In fact, the only kind of noodles I'll happily eat is pho. My friend dragged me to Daikokuya insisting it would change my mind. I really hoped she was right. She wasn't. First of all, the place is tiny and the line was out the door. We waited an hour to be seated. She ordered some kind of basic ramen and I got the teriyaki chicken. My sprite came out tasting like chlorine, so I sent it back. They refused to erase it from my tab because I'd already taken a sip. We sat there sweating next to the cooks for a good hour or so before we finally got our food. My chicken was overcooked and boring, so I tried some of her ramen. It really was not good. I'm probably being overly harsh, but it tasted like regular store-bought packaged ramen. Nothing I can't make on my own if I felt inclined to do so. I guess if you love ramen, this is the place for you, but I won't be back again.

I hadn't been to Daikokuya in 2.5 years given I moved out of state, and I was jonesing for a tonkotsu ramen and gyoza fix. When I still lived in L.A., I would always head there right around the time they open on Saturdays, and seating was never an issue. I would dare say the place was close to dead. Those days seem to be over. I made it there roughly 15 minutes after opening on a Saturday and had to put my name on the dreaded waiting list. When I left a half-hour later, I counted roughly 25 people waiting outside. I wonder what generated further buzz about the place given Jonathan Gold had already raved about it years before I moved. Unfortunately my meal suffered a bit due to the busyness that I was unaccustomed to. The gyoza, normally some of the best I've ever had, was hastily put together. The dough was wrapped poorly and was given to me quite crusty and in one big blob. I had to use my chopsticks to separate them. My ramen was still solid though, and it's one of the better places in town for tonkotsu. One somewhat disappointing trip won't dampen the plenty of other times I left feeling highly satisfied.

During a recent visit to LA, I HAD to check out Daikokuya after so many rave reviews about the ramen from friends. It was worth the half hour wait. The broth was pretty good and not overwhelming. I wish there was a bit more flavor to it. Perhaps, not enough fattiness? I can't quite put my finger on what's missing. The pork was relatively average. It wasn't tough but it wasn't great either. The noodles were awesome. Great texture. I also had the chicken teriyaki bowl as recommended by the waitress. I think I should've gone with the unagi bowl as they gave a lot and it just looked better. The chicken wasn't awful but it wasn't cooked as thorough as I'd like. Overall, a good experience. Would come here again. I still have to check out Santouka Ramen but I guess that will have to be for another trip.

My friend and I drove down here for lunch on a Wednesday. We arrived at 11:30am and there was a line forming already! We waited about 15 minutes and were seated quickly. The ramen was delicious and the broth was tasty. Unfortunately, after I left I could sense that there was MSG in the broth because it always gives me a tingly feeling on my tongue. MSG = bad! I guess I'll just order something else next time. It was good otherwise.

Wow. Consistently good Ramen! Both the Daikokuya Ramen and the Kichi-men are delicious! I always grab the Gyoza and Kirin Draft is only $2.50!!!! Yasui desu ne-! Tips: Don't go with more than 4 people because the 5th will have to site on a barstool outside of the booth. Don't hype the experience up too much; yes it's great Ramen, yes It's probably one of the best Ramen spots in LA, yes it's always packed and service is great, but you're only setting your peeps up for disappointed when you try and be the Columbus of Ramen shops. Don't go at all if a 10-25 minute wait  transforms anybody in your group into a little girl. I'll come back again and again.

I've had the ramen in Japan which is out of this world, but in terms of what I've found in LA, this is the best. The place is open late so it's good for when you're drunk. The line is usually long and you put your name on a list -- they're going to call you by number, not name, so pay attention. Anyway, one time I was here I had a blacked out friend ditch me with the bill to pay. BS. It's right next to Far Bar and  some other spots in the Art District, hence our drunkenness. The service is always good, the ramen is delicious, and the pork melts in your mouth. Other than the slanted booths that can cause vertigo, this place is an LA must try.

Food: 4 stars Service: 3 stars Value: 4 stars Daikokuya has the most highest reviews in the Yelp result, so how can I not try it when I am in town? We came on a holiday weekday for lunch and it was around 45 minutes wait. It was that bad since we could walk around the Japanese village center just across the street. They basically have only one kind of ramen, the Daikoku ramen. It  was good but not the best. The egg was overcooked but the pork and the broth were quite delicious. (I have been searching for ramen that is as good as the ones I had in Japan, but still no luck!) What surprised me was the tempura. I rarely order tempura when I go to Japanese restaurant, but I saw people ordered it here and it looked really good. So I decided to give it a try. The batter was very light and crunchy and it was super yummy! We also tried the fried spicy tuna for appetizer. It wasn't spicy at all. But if you don't mind the lack of spiciness, it can be a good appetizer.   This place is small, so it is best for group of 4 people or less. Also if you want a short wait, ask for the seats along the bar, the wait should be short than for a table. The waitress service is a hit or miss. Some girls have a nice friendly smile on their face, but some just give no facial expression while serving you. Overall experience was pleasant and would love to come here again.

Back on attack at Daikokuya today and I am starving. Arrived at 12:15 and put our name on the list, and were seated by 12:35 at our table. The atmosphere is still hole in the wall, but not grimy. The kitchen is bustling and there are people happily slurping up their ramen everywhere. It's a good idea to show up half an hour earlier than you'd like to be seated at lunch time, perhaps even longer. Daikokuya is such a popular spot that a line forms quickly. Service continues to be blasé but effective. Food is still delicious, but my stomach is always uneasy afterwards. Perhaps it's because of how rich the broth is.

This is the BEST ramen I've ever had. I think it's better than Santouka or Gomen... The broth is light and doesn't have excessive oily residue like most ramen joints. I ordered one bowl of ramen and was STUFFED! I wish they sold them in smaller bowls lol. I hate seeing a good, warm bowl of ramen go to waste :( Slight downside? No air conditioning on warm days. Whatever. The yummy ramen makes up for it!!

Based off just one visit, I can tell that this place will require a wait for most who'd like to dine here. If you come, I recommend going in a group no larger than four. It was Sunday night of Labor day weekend, we had a party of four and we ended up waiting 2 hours. Yes, 2 hours. We were tired. We were getting hungrier and hungrier by the minute but I refused to leave (or be dishonest by taking other people's seats who left before us). If i'm gonna get my ramen, I'm going to get it the honest way dab nammit! This place probably has one of the best ramen broths I've ever tasted. Thick and salty, but not over done. The pork belly was extra tender as well. Noodles were standard. The prices are more than decent. For 11.50 you can get a bowl of rice, unagi, and a generous portion of ramen. We ordered beer and sake and could not even finish our beers because the soup had so much broth. At the end of the meal, we realized that the workers had forgotten to include our sake and beer on our tab. Nice! Thanks for the free liquor and good eats Daikokuya!!! It may have taken us some time to finally get seated, but good things are worth the wait.

Simply excellent! We decided to check out this place after seeing it managed to receive... 1973 reviews on Yelp, and still keep 4 stars! We were expecting a hole-in-the-wall with hopefully acceptable ramen, what we got was a trip to Kyoto and back! We had to experience the apparently incontrovertible wait (30 minutes on a Monday night!), before being seated on a pleather bench in the tiny restaurant. Approximately 10 tables, plus seating around the open kitchen area = obvious wait. At the very moment we sat, we forgot all about the wait to focus on the menu. We settled for Gyozas as appetizers and the oh-so recommended Daikoku ramen, kotteri style. The gyozas were incredible. So incredible in fact that we debated ordering a second plate. We barely managed to resist, when our ramen bowls arrived. Huge, swimming-pool sized traditional ramen bowls, packed with incredibly tender proteins, a marinated egg, soft, delicious noodles, mushrooms and scallions. It was, I must say, heaven in a bowl. And for less than $10 per bowl, absolutely worth it. The interior is very much "Kyoto farmers market"-style, and feels quite authentic. Notice the great 1950s metal advertisings hanging on the main wall. The experience was definitely worth the wait, and we will be back no matter what, very soon, for more Daikokuya.

We came here on a Saturday around noon and had to wait over an hour to get seated and you are waiting standing. You have to sign your name in when you get there and there were like 7 numbers before us. Parking: you have to street park with coined meters or park in a structure. Atmosphere: Very small, hole in the wall-ish, but I don't think anyone cares. Food: I ordered the Daikoku Ramen.  It tastes so much better when you add A LOT of sriracha if you like some spice. Price: $8.50 for the ramen I know a lot of people who like this place, but honestly it's just not my pot of tea. I would never wait that long ever again.  BUT I must say I like Daikokuya's noodles better than Orochon's.

Came here for lunch the other day met by a large crowd of people waiting to be seated. After a long wait, I ordered the "legendary" ramen. Firstly, I think the ramen is good, not awesome like everyone says. The broth was clean, but lacked a bit of flavor. It might have needed more seasoning. The pork was tender, but the noodles tasted like the ramen noodles you get at the supermarket. I would give this place 3 1/2 stars if I could. I think Ramen Nippon and Orochon Ramen is better.

Ok, I'll admit that I stumbled across Daikokuya as a cruel joke. You see my FFL (Fav For Life), the backwards maN (his name is Nam) has a current obsession with Ramen. He consumes ramen at least three times a week. We have a running joke that he's getting obese from consuming so much ramen. Currently he's limited to the ramen that the Bay Area has to offer. So I sought out to find the best ramen in LA, just out of reach, that I could possibly find in order to rub it in his face. Much thanks to my fellow Yelpers for your guidance and your reviews. I knew exactly what to expect before I arrived, so I planned accordingly. On arrival I made my way through crowd put my name down on the waitlist and included the amount in my party. Instead of waiting around I drove a couple of blocks to find a quick appetizer and a warm drink. By the time I returned to Daikokuya we were only two parties away from a cozy spot in a booth or at the bar, luckily we got a booth. I ordered the Daikoku ramen. Their tonkatsu soysauce base broth was exquisite, there was so much flavor and the important part....it wasn't overly salty! They aren't shy when it comes to meat, the pork belly chasu was delicious it just melts in your mouth. It's topped with plenty of green onions that compliments and doesn't overpower. The noodles were perfect but they can be done to preference. The only complaint I have is the marinated egg was overcooked and cold, I prefer soft boiled eggs the kind that oozes out vibrant yolk when you puncture it. Daikokuya still deserves 5 stars because it is by far the best ramen I've tasted thus far, I went to two different ramen places just last week. And if you're curious, during my meal I did manage to send my friend a SMS showing him exactly what he missed out on (picture attached). Victory never tasted so savory. =)

Serious hole-in-the-wall.  I love hole-in-the-walls and they're what defines California cuisine and makes it great.  Stores that choose one niche and do it amazingly well.  I've only been to the one in Little Tokyo so can't vouch for all the other satellite locations. $8.50 for a ginourmous bowl of Daikuko ramen that made me weak in the knees and bust at the waistline. The broth, though a little salty and on the heavy side, was incredibly flavourful.  I would not recommend ordering the Kotteri, which uses added soup extracted from back fat given the plain version was already pretty dense.  Yes, this is broth that is made from scratch by boiling bones for days rather than dumping a cube of boullion in water.  The black pork was tender, fairly lean, and delicious.  The ramen had the perfect chewiness and elasticity. My friend got the Daikuko ramen and small tempura bowl.  I would skip the tempura bowl.  1)  The bowl of ramen alone will do you in.  2)  Tempura is definitely not their specialty - the batter was thick, grease-laden, and soggy.  This also came with a side of Asian cold slaw, which consisted of shredded cabbage drenched in watered-down Thousand Island.  It was, overall, unappetizing. I came at 10:30PM on a weekday when there was a 10 minute wait.  Would I have loved my ramen as much if I had loitered at the doorway waiting for 2 hours?  No.  It would have taken more than this bowl of ramen to appease me.  However, given I came here at an off hour, I had a good meal for $10.  I would recommend coming for ramen only, nothing more.

My second time here.  The tonkatsu based ramen and the fried rice was really good! I can't say it compares to Ippudo in NY...but...it's still really good!!! Lines are long...put your name down and go across the street to the mall and buy yummy desserts to spoil your appetite until it's your turn! There's a parking lot two blocks down for a $4 flat rate on weekends!  Meters are $2/hr!

My visits to LA require two things: Doing something fun and grubbing. After watching Cirque du Soleil Iris and making my liver work overtime, it was time to satisfy my hunger. Yelp recommended this ramen joint and had hella (yes, hella, I'm from SF) reviews so it was an all systems go and let's go here! Me and the GF arrived there around 11 at night and found that the block was dead but this place had a line. Shiznit! I'm hungry! Oh well gotta wait... Fast forward an hour after waiting and we get seated at the counter. The menu is pretty limited. Only one type of ramen to select from and we gotta get it since we came for ramen. The bowl comes out after a few minutes and it's huge (that's what she said). The broth is very rich, fairly thick and has lots of flavor. Noodles were cooked well but has nothing on Mariuchi back at SF. Someone in the back, I think it's the waiter/waitress, has a heavy hand when it comes to adding the scallions. Ease up, please! Also ordered the gyoza because it looked interesting and different. It was aight...again too much scallions and the pan fried pork on top of the veggie dumplings made it a heavier dish than normal. I  prefer traditional gyoza over this dish. All in all pretty good ramen considering the size and price.  I'll work my way back when I'm craving ramen in LA.

Why a 3 you ask? The broth... was ok... not amazing.... I imagined the broth to be much pork-ier. It definitely did not meet my expectations. It was salty like other people have mentioned. The noodles weren't as chewy as I would have wanted them either. :( However, I did enjoy the bean sprouts and green onions that come on top of the ramen. I enjoyed the crunch very much. I also appreciated the boiled egg that I enjoyed after I finished all the noodles. So I'm glad I tried such an iconic restaurant in Little Tokyo, but I can't say that I would crave it.

Ok, first of the bat.  Loooong wait.  Cash only.  Limited seating.  Bad right?...wrong.  Food was authentic with pretty good service.  The wait staff seems pretty patient, especially with the hostile customers bickering about wait times. (Those customers should go to the next ramen shop then, or shut it and wait your turn to be seated!!)  Other than that, judos to the always patient wait staff.   Food is prepared in a timely manner and water is always full. Recommend this place to all my family and friends.

Another sufferer of the "over-hyped" syndrome... 3rd most reviewed restaurant in Los Angeles...4 stars...countless fans amongst my friends...and.... Not impressed.  Yes, the ramen was good - soup base was excellent and noodles was not soggy, but....chashu was rough (the quality was just subpar and it appeared to be overcooked).  the egg was over-cooked.  Definitely far from perfection.  (for a perfect 5 score, see my Ippudo NY review)  Ramen only rating - 4. What brought it down to a 3 were the side orders.  We ordered the combo, so we had side orders of tempura and chicken egg bowl.  The tempura was a bit soggy and the chicken egg bowl tasted like microwaved food.  Not good. After eating at Daikokuya, it makes me miss appreciate (and praise) Ippudo NY even more.  Not only did they perfect the ramen, they also perfected all the side dishes as well.   Will I come again to Daikokuya? Probably....but i'll stick to ramen only next time.

Best ramen ever! The broth is so good, even better when you ask for kotteri flavor.  The little salad they give you has one of the best sesame dressings i've ever had.   I always get the combo with fried rice. I've tried the shredded pork bowl once and that was just as good as everything else I've had here.   There is always a long line, but it goes by pretty quickly.

Let me be a respectful naysayer when I say that this is NOT the best ramen in Los Angeles. Sure, the kurobuta pork belly chashu is on point + the noodles are just perfectly al dente for ramen, but the tonkotsu broth has been incredibly hit or miss. The broth is supposedly boiled in an undisclosed location overnight in a large cauldron. I don't know whether to be impressed or incredibly disgusted. It sounds like some diabolical evil torture device. I will lower you menacingly into my dangerous boiling ramen cauldron! My first trip here was incredible, but subsequent trips, especially with prepped + excited coworkers, were disappointing. They seem to always run out of their kotteri [fatty] broth. That being said, when Daikokuya is good, it's GOOD. But I haven't had a good bowl since ... I can't remember when. I've had better ramen at street vendors in Japan. And the line, forgetaboutit. Sometimes it's just easier to go somewhere is in Little Tokyo for slightly better or slightly faster ramen.

This place is beyond good. After a long night of drinking nothing hits the spot like Ramen. This place is a 35min drive form my house, but its worth the trip. My boy Kenny and I try to hit this place up at least 3 to 4 times a month. The price is very reasonable. The food and service is excellent. There is one small downside though. No matter when you go, you always have to wait to get a table. There is always a line. If you like Ramen, you cannot pass this place up. Give it a try, it is def. worth it.

Still feeling quite angry when I woke up this morning. I think 2 stars would be more appropriate. Just what did I do to my Friday night? I rarely make sweeping statements like this but this place is overrated. The ramen is mediocre at most. I can't say the food is horrible but it's not worth the over one hour wait. While you could tell that they do put effort into making the soup, it really wasn't spectacular. There's nothing much to say about it. Lacks oomph/ahhh/mmmm.  They almost got the nitamago right with the nice soft center. Unfortunately it was tasteless. I was lucky enough to have tasted some amazing nitamago and this just doesn't cut it. Pork was satisfactory. Ordered a side of roasted pork belly. It was alright but again I've had some pretty kickass roasted pork belly at the same place that serves that perfect nitamago, so this one didn't win me over. Now we do have a winner in the house - the fried rice was absolutely delicious we couldn't stop eating it. We probably left half the noodles behind. $0.02 worth: A blog listed on Daikokuya's website that said it's the best ramen in the US. I sincerely hope they had a chance to try Ippudo, or even just Gomen in OC. Honestly, though the food at Daikokuya is decent, it's comparable to Ajisen at most and even Ajisen has some pretty good tender pork ribs. And I don't even consider Ajisen a real ramen place.   Would not return unless it's for the fried rice.

This is quite possibly the most inconsistent restaurant I have ever been to, and when the wait-time can be as long as two hours IN THE RAIN, consistency is pretty important. My first time here was meh.  I found the broth to be quite bland, and although I will say the chashu rice bowl and salad were really good, I wouldn't have come back. But then, the second time I came here, I ordered the kotteri ramen (thanks Jill for the suggestion!), and it was AMAZING.  The broth was full of flavor from all the extra fat (I know, it's bad for you, but hey, if you're eating ramen, you might as well go all out!), and I could not have asked for a better bowl of ramen. Unfortunately, the third time that I came here, the ramen, even the kotteri style, was really disappointing.  I had raved about it to my friends, so it was rather embarassing when those steaming bowls of heaven finally arrived at our table, and it was all rather underwhelming, on par with my first visit.  All in all, I don't think my friends will be asking me for food suggestions for a while.  Sadness. Sorry, Daikokuya, but until my culinary reputation recovers, I do not plan to return.  I suggest Santouka in the Mitsuwa Marketplace or Ramen Yamadaya in Torrance.  They're cheaper, just as tasty (arguably tastier), and they certainly are more consistent in terms of their quality.

Superb chicken dishes, even though I can't eat pork this restaurant went above and beyond my expectations!!! There is a reason that the wait to be seated is 45 min at a good time. The miso soup was hearty and delicatable. The tempura was well done and crispy,and the smells are just enchanting. My friends had ramen while I had a chicken teriyaki...

What are you people smoking? Oh wait, I've just through the reviews and a large majority of people reviewing this place consider cup-o-noodles "ramen." 5 stars!!!!!!!!!! =/ I first came here 7 years ago when I was a ramen rookie...Thought it was incredible...13 trips to Japan and 7 years later my taste buds have seen the light...While it's not fair to compare this place to legendary spots I've had the pleasure of eating at in Japan...I think it's time to be honest about Daikokuya...It's REALLY average at BEST... And oh boy, has this place gone down hill... I haven't been for over a year, but I used to work in the area and the soup just kept getting more and more bland...Quality is obviously suffering due to the massive influx of USC kids and non-LA natives drinking the Kool-Aid...It's nearly impossible not to laugh at all the sheep outside when I drive by on my way to Izayoi... While Santouka isn't exactly a stones throw from Little Tokyo, it's easily the best Ramen in Los Angeles...So if you actually want GOOD ramen...Go there...Otherwise, feel free to keep feeding the Daikokuya hype machine and enjoy your california roll/ramen combo...

Friends these days seem to often compare Daikokuya with Hakata Shinsengumi, but it's not really an apt comparison.  Daikokuya has only a couple types of ramen, with a more extensive menu on Japanese rice bowl type sides.  Shinsengumi has more types of ramen.  As Starbucks is to lattes, so Shinsengumi is to ramen.   Overall, what I appreciated most about Daikokuya was the historic feel of the place.

I love ramen and I love going to this seemingly hole in the wall. There's always seems to be quite a wait. Right when you walk through the hustle and bustle of a door, you are greeted with a chair that has a paper to which you add your name to the long list. After you jot down your name, you look around and hope that the wait isn't too long. At least you are only a party of two. Well, that was my experience upon walking through this restaurant. I was hungry and its a good thing that I brought my book with me, otherwise, I would have been salivating to the floor looking at everyone's food. We ordered the combo. I chose to get the tempura with my ramen and my fiance chose to get the pork cutlet. Had I known that his pork cutlet was going to come with a fried egg, I would have gotten that also. {sigh} Next time, right? Hmm, but wait! After eating my tempera, I became nearly full and I hadn't even received my big bowl of ramen yet. Oh no! Well, just when that thought passed, in came my ramen. Such great timing, eh? It was huge in portion, contained a fair amount of noodles and meat. The broth was a bit sweet, a bit salty--well balanced if you ask me! Unfortunately, I didn't have the courage to finish the entire bowl. Next time, I'll just order the ramen and not the combo. But, if you are ravishingly hungry and can hang, then go for the combo, man!

Ok, hands down one of the BEST ramen places in LA.  The soup is hearty and rich packed with tons of flavor.  The noodles are just right, and you can add extra flavoring to it if it doesn't suffice.  They give you chopped garlic that you can put in (make sure you don't have a date after) and some of the best tasting bamboo shoots I've ever had.   They include a shoyu marinated egg too, I never eat it because after gobbling up that whole bowl of goodness there is hardly any room for that.   Shinsengumi and this one are completely different, although they are in the hakata style.  The meat here is nice and tender with tons of flavor while SSG has a boring chashu.  So if you are here trying to compare them both, I think you will have a hard time. But this place is delicious, I make it my mission to go here at least once a month. Only downside is the wait, but hey like all good places the wait is usually a good indicator.

I WISH THEY WOULD EXPAND!!   I frequent there regularly, even at 4PM they're full! What's the deal!? They actually have 2 other restaurants which don't do half as well and serve a completely different type of food. I've tried almost everything on their menu!   They're Ramen is obviously what they're famous for, but they have many more secrets. Their chicken terriyaki is awesome, never had a better one, ever! Their sashimi is great, despite the fact that they aren't a sushi bar! Their fried rice is good! they're oyakodon (egg chicken bowl) is great. Their salmon roe bowl is great. Everything on the menu is awesome. It's good old Japanese pride, they only do the best they can in everything they can and don'tmiss out on any of the details, like the egg in the ramen, or the sesame on the chicken.

Better than Santouka? No way! Tonkatsu Ramen vs Tonkatsu Ramen, Santouka inches out Daikokuya. I think the broth and noodle are comparable; both are really delicious but Santouka just gives you more. More noodles, more broth, more meat. However I did get the deluxe at Santouka which I believe is a little more expensive than Daikokuya so I'm not sure if thats a fair comparison. However, Daikokuya does have its merits. For starters it's open way later than Santouka. Serves $2 mugs of Kirin Ichiban from tap and has awesome awesome gyoza. I also loved that even though they were busy (they are always busy), the service was still attentive and friendly. The only thing that sucks is that the wait and finding parking in Little Tokyo can be a bitch.

The wait is insaaaane for a bowl of ramen.  The ramen's great, and the broth is very rich.  if you're not a big fan of pork and pork flavor, this won't be for you.  the pork they include with the ramen is really fatty but very flavorful. if you can get in with less than a 20 minute wait and you're a fan of good ramen in rich broth, then it's worth it.

First thing that comes out of my mouth about this place is.. SALAD DRESSING. The salad that comes in a MINI bowl with the ginger/onion/? dressing before your order is such a tease. I have never been so obsessed over salad dressing until now. ( The left over dressing poured over rice is heavenly. ) The long wait is inescapable.. deal with it. The Bento Boxes are standard - it's filling which is all i have to say about that. The chow mein and fried rice is something I'd recommend (if you have to choose either one, go for the fried rice). And lastly... their ramen. I'd say the first few noodle servings and a couple slurps of the broth is all I need.. ..When your body literally starts to ache, and you feel sluggish, and groggy.. you know what they've put in there.. monosodiumglutamate..or more commonly known as MSG. The price is fair.. although I'd rather pay 50cents for a cup ramen or shin-ramen. The 3 stars I rated is after 4+ visits to this place.. I'd probably have given it 4 or 5stars after the first visit.

Great ramen here!!  You MUST get the ramen when you go here....or else you're weird. They start you off with a complimentary little bowl of salad.  The lettuce is thinly sliced and it comes with a dressing that reminds me of a mixture of mayo and thousand island.  Whatever it is, I like it!!! My husband always gets the combo:  bowl of ramen and a side of pork cutlet.  The pork cutlet bowl is SOO GOOD.  Rice on bottom, nice thick chunk of cutlet, and it's all topped with onions and an egg.  Love the juice they add too. I always get the combo with the fried rice.  YUMMY!!   This place is very tiny and can get VERY crowded.  You walk in and write your name on the clipboard.  There are times where we've waited close to an hour.   I wouldn't suggest a very large group to come here.  Maybe at max....a party of 5.   If you come by yourself or with one other person, you'll most likely be seated at the counter.  You can see them cook your food there.

For some reason, I just can't really handle hot stuff.  We're talking temperature and not spicy.  I love spicy. Anyways, I love to order their Tsukemen.  It's basically a cold version of their Daikoku Ramen.  Wash that down with an order of spicy tuna roll and Asahi....yum....YUM! Street parking sux (but that's LA for ya) and if you get there in the lunch rush, expect to wait.

I don't think theres anything I can say about Daikokuya that hasn't already been said. Amazing ramen, rich and delicious broth, tasty meat and the best fried rice I've ever tasted. Mm, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it again. :D I love taking new people here because it reminds me of the first time my friends and I ate there; that first wide eyed look of amazement around the table after you first taste the broth, followed by the end of all conversation and loud slurping and the pouring of more beer. Definitely be prepared for a long wait. I'm still trying to figure out when Daikokuya's "down" time is. I'm starting to think it doesn't exist. I've been there ranging between 3:00p to 9:00p and it's ALWAYS busy and there's always at least 4 or 5 groups waiting ahead of me to get seated. I'm definitely someone that usually walks away from a restaurant with a wait longer than 15 minutes, but for this ramen, I've waited over an hour on several occasions. But, you can usually count on some less diehard folks ahead of you giving up and not being there when the lady calls their name off the waiting list. :D I would suggest trying to come in a party of two and sitting at the counter if you're eager to try but are intimidated by the ever present crowd outside. Based off food alone, I would give 5 stars, but the inconvenience of waiting and not being able to comfortably seat slightly larger groups gives it an overall 4 stars. PS - Does anyone else think the high tech ordering pads they use there are nifty??

This is my favorite ramen restaurant in LA.  All the good things have already been said by other yelpers.  I was in Little Tokyo 2 weeks ago and saw a group of people waiting outside for the place to open.  This place is starting to become way too popular.   I stopped by one time 2 years ago and saw a sign which said they were closed because they ran out of broth.  I respect them more for that when they could've easily took shortcuts to water down the broth or do other things to open but serve a lesser quality ramen.

This "used to" be my favorite ramen and gyoza place in LA. I used to go there almost every week after work. Nice place to eat my ramen and read their Jumps and look at the yakuza look alike chef making ramen. (the guy with all the tattoos, if you have been there a while back, you know whom I am talking about) This was 3-4 years ago. Now the wait is insane, it's about a 20-45 mins wait. They no longer put out new Jumps. The soup sometimes feels like watered down. The gyozas sometimes are too soft. And I havent seen my Yakuza chef for almost a year. I am extremely sad that popularity has taken my favorite ramen joint in town away from me. Sigh~~ If you are tired of the wait, try the Japanese diner Shuehiro or Mr. Ramen next door.

Preface:  I've only been here once, and I lived in Japan for two months. I've eaten at a lot of Japanese places all over California, particularly in SF and LA.  I was taken here by a friend who raved about it.  Like always, it was crowded and we waited about 45 minutes. To get to the point:  The place has good soup, big portions, and it hits the spot on a cold day.  However, maybe it's because I became a Japanese food snob after going to Japan, it wasn't outstanding.  Most prominent to me was the noodles, which were only okay. Ramen's two most important components are the noodles and the soup.  I would give the soup a 5 and the ramen a 3.  If they had fresh, perfectly cooked noodles, this place could be epic.  However, I have to give them a solid 4. If you're going to have ramen in LA, this may be the place.  But only maybe. Visit http://www.sixtaste.com/… for more reviews.

This place definitely satisfied my ramen curving. It was a 1+ hr wait on Friday 3pm (kinda insane when I think back). Awesome noodles and awesome soup base. The soup base is not as salty as Halu and Santa Ramen in the Bay Area, which is a plus! I would definitely go back, but if the wait is 1+ hr again.......I might have to go and check out the other 10 ramen places in J Town. You should go try it if you are a ramen lover =D

It's good.  But not "oh shizz, fock me hard" good. The katsudon + ramen combo is great and can feed 2 people. I still like the ramen at shin-sen-gumi and orochon better. Daikokuya is ranked third in my mind.

You walk in and you forget you're in LA.... or the US for that matter.  Plastered on the walls of the this ramenya are memorabilia of every sorts, from the obscure to the... strange.  But this is serious ramen.   What Daikoku lacks in variety in its ramen -- there are only about three flavors -- it makes up in the mastery.  The standard ramen is a pork based, flavor-rich broth, with chaoshu pork, bamboo shoots, sprouts, flavored egg, and green onions.  The noodles are cooked al dente and from the looks of it, freshly made.  But beyond the ramen, I have to note the combination specials -- seriously good deal.  For about $14, you can get the three item combo, which you get to choose from a variety of items, such as tonkatsu, cali rolls, spicy tuna rolls, beef and chicken teriyaki, among others.  It comes with a salad with a carrot, daikon puree miso dressing AND miso soup.  Seriously. The only sad part as of late about Daikoku is the fact that they've stopped carry out... probably because of the hour wait that's standard, even at 11PM, 12 midnite, and 1 am.  That tells you something doesn't it?

I love DAIKOKUYA! The ramen here is amazing. It really is. The broth, pork and noodles are all good. BUT the best part is the egg... They cook their eggs in a broth overnight so it has a bit of flavor to it. AND its always cooked perfectly! It might not be the cleanest restaurant ever, but its freaking good

Where do I start. Well I stumbled upon this place about 6 years ago with some friends that had previously been here. At the time I was new to the ramen phenomenon and didn't realize what a junie I would turn into. Since my first time at Daikokuya I've been to dozens of other ramen places and wether anyone else thinks it's better or not I must say this is my all time favortie hands down. The broth is just right for my liking, the noodles also perfect. Never over cooked or under. I know I can always expect the same quality of food everytime I stop in. If you like a strong salty broth you can order it darker. It is very good also, just not to my liking so much. I'm a big fan of the pork cop cutlet even though I'm not really into pork, it's just good. Served in a small bowl over rice with yummy onions and a small stack of ginger on top. I'm just a freak about the ginger, I love the taste.....But beware it's not for everyone. I'm just more daring when it comes to food. If I find myself in the area during the middle of the day I will stop in for a lunch plate with chicken teriyaki and veggie tempura. To die for. I'm very picky about where I eat tempura only because it can be oily at some restaurants. I've never found myself complaining about it here. As for the california roll, it's very mediocre, kind of generic but not terrible. I say choose something else on the menu and skip on the cali rolls. I love the taste of the coca cola here, only when it's from the fountain. The first time I stopped in with friends years ago everyone said I needed to try the coke. They were right. LOL. When I bring friends here for the first time the first comment walking in is usually along the lines of "this place looks dirty" but on the way out or getting in the car you can always bet you'll here someone with "so when are we coming back to try more". The only complaint I could ever have about this place is that sometimes the wait is long but at least there are some interesting shops neighboring to waste time at like the comic book store and video place. There is also a little bar a few doors down and if you know who Bunta from "Initial D" is then you'll swear he is the bar tender. I love this J-town experience even though parking can be a pain sometimes. your best bet is the parking lot right next to the Miyako hotal or down the street at one of the other restaurants with pay parking. I won't stop visiting this place anytime soon and neither will my friends, even the ones who haven't been in for a bite yet. Domo...

When I was flirting with vegetarianism, avoiding the porky broth at Daikokuya was the hardest pill to swallow. Simply put, Daikokuya has the best ramen I've ever tasted! It's now the standard by which I measure all other ramen places. (I'm in NYC right now, and I'd trade a bowl of Momofuku's ramen for Daikokuya's any day.) If you like the flavor of shiso, try the fried spicy tuna appetizer...SO GOOD!

I come down to the area a lot - I've spent a fair amount of time in nearby Suehiro and Mr. Ramen, and this place always has a line out the door. Decided to try it tonight, and now I know why.  I had the traditional ramen, you know, the one that everyone in the place is eating, and it was absolutely wonderful. Flavorful, fresh, and delicious. My only complaints were these:  one, that there wasn't a whole lot of meat in it; I am by no means a meat freak, but there were only two little tiny slivers, and it felt a little shorted, and two, the place is just filthy, like scary filthy, which is a shame, because it really doesn't have to be.  But otherwise, the food was fantastic and totally worth the wait!

I came here expecting ramen that was out of this world, but to be honest, it was just ok.  I'm pretty partial to Ryowa in Mountain View because they have such cheap lunch combos that include gyoza AND fried rice!  The two things I like about this place are the amount of meat they have in the ramen and the portion sizes.  The ramen comes in this HUGE BOWL, seriously bigger than my head, with at least five pieces of meat!  Maybe my meat just broke into smaller pieces, but it seemed like there was a lot.   My one complaint is that this place is way too small.  We came here to eat lunch at 3:30 pm and we still had to wait for at LEAST 30 minutes.  I think this place is good, but not THAT amazing where I'd wait that long again. Especially when it's already 3:30 in the afternoon.

This is by far the best ramen place ever. The wait isn't the best, but it's not because their service sucks, it's because there's always so many people waiting to have their taste buds tickled by the goodness in their ramen. It's not a place you want to come to if there's more than 4 of you. It's a pretty small place, but it adds to the experience. I usually order the Pork Cutlet bowl. The combination of pork cutlet with fried egg and onion and some kind of special sweet sauce...MMmmMm goood. The ramen is delicious too. The fried rice is good too. This is one of my favorite Ramen places and even though it's pretty far, it's worth the drive for those of us in the suburbs!!

I LOVE this place! It is the best ramen that I have had in San Francisco and LA. The portion and price are reasonable. I got the Ramen and katsu don combo. The ramen is so chewy, only a little undercooked (this is not a problem at all). The broth is not salty. The egg was perfect because the yolk is just solidified which is hard to find this in other ramen places. I think the katsu don was yummy but just nothing special. I also ordered the gyoza and it was good too! Ar.....forgot to mention their salad! I think it is also the best that I have ever had in the Japanese restaurant!

Yet another in a long line of disappointments in trying to find any actually good ramen anywhere in America. I'd seen this place about a year ago when visiting a friend in LA and decided to try it on my way from Temecula back to SF in the hopes that it would actually be good. What can I say? Terrible noodles, bland soup. Sorry, but this is not good ramen by any standard of ramen. I got to thinking, maybe one reason American ramen sucks is because they don't put MSG in it. I know there is a stigma against MSG in America. All I can say is "suck it!"  Japanese live longer than pretty much any other 1st world country and all of them eat MSG every day! But, even if they put MSG in the soup so it wasn't so damn bland, though I doubt that's the missing ingredient, the noodles were still made from freeze dried noodles instead of fresh ones. Meh!

Daikokuya. Their ramen is pretty good. I recommend ordering the "kotteri" ramen which is decidedly more awesome than the normal broth. It's written on the menu that it's just more pork back fat added into the ramen, but believe me...it's a significant improvement. The noodles are cooked perfectly every time I go. They also add in standard fare like green onions, seaweed, bamboo, and chashu. Nothing special. The chashu at Santouka is better. Even the chashu at Chabuya is better. But Daikokuya adds a marinated boiled egg  (I don't think Santouka does), and it tastes prettyyyy good. Every time I order a combo to go along with the ramen, like the tonkatsu or tempura, it sucks. So I would stay away from those. On the other hand, they have shochu! Which mixes really great with Calpico. I don't know why you would want to get drunk at a ramen place, but it's there. If you go early (like 6:30) before the lines pile up, the vibe is pretty relaxed, pretty Japanese, AKA a perfect place to eat ramen. Later on though, this place is straight-up terrifying. I avoid going if there's even a remote possibility of a line.

This place has become a hit and miss lately. I would say on most occasions this place is quite delicious and has one of the best ramen in Los Angeles. The broth is thick and full of flavor. Add a little garlic sauce to it and you're good to go. There's also the koeterri (I think I spelled that wrong) that you can add to your broth. It makes a bit more fatty, but to tell you the truth, I can barely taste the different (just makes it a bit more lip smacking good). The ramen noodles is probably the weakest part. It's just your average noodle. I've had better noodles at Mitsuwa food market (not a diss on Daikokuya's noodles, just saying there are better noodles out there). The sides meals that come with the combo are tasty, nothing to write home about, but if you're extra hungry and want a little variety with your ramen, it's good enough to order. The service is average at best. They're usually trying to hustle people out because the lines are so long. There are times you may have to wait a hour to sit down, but the usual is 30 minutes.

I heard a lot about how good ramen in LA is so this time I got to try it. My boyfriend and I swung by here for lunch on our way back to NorCal. It was around 11:30pm and there was a line already. The wait wasn't that bad considering that we only waited for 15 minutes. I got the ramen and he got the cold ramen. They were the same except the cold one ramen wasn't in the soup. I like the chewy and crunchy noodle and that the egg was stew. It was well marinated with soysauce and the yolk was moist see through golden yellow. I like the lots of green onion in the soup. But the broth tastes a bit too salty for me. My boyfriend liked his seared fatty pork, tasted kind of like bacon. We were so full after the meal that we could barely walked. The portions were huge. I had to pack half of the bowl to go because I could have it for lunch the next day. I don't ever let good food goes to waste.  The soup got a little more saltier the next day but noodle was still good.

Wow doesn't it feel special to be the 783rd person to review what appears to be an LA institution? Let me start by saying this, the ramen is good, and this is all we came to eat, it's good, but its not like a MIke Tyson upper cut or one of those famous gut blows that should send my stomach and spleen into a high speed collision with my spine. No, this is not that kind of ramen joint but it is quite tasty in so far as they have a single Tonkatsu ramen on the menu. The ramen is good, rich, the broth tasty, the chasu was fantastic but the noodles were just average. Read the fine print and get the extra flavorful broth with extra oil in it... yeah that's the stuff... Here's where I felt like points were lost... the wait is obnoxious! Yeah I don't know when the sweet spot to go here is. We ordered the combo with a a bowl of rice and ikura, the ikura was lack luster at best and the rice was actually dried out, tasted like it had been sitting there. All in all a decent joint, but with the wait and the location, limited parking to boot, methinks there are other tasty joints in the vicinity that are just as good and offer more variety...

My first ramen experience was here at Daikokuya. It was phenomenal. The prices for appetizers are a bit steep, but the price of the ramen was just right. I got the large bowl of some kind of seafood ramen (can't remember the exact name right now) and it was huge, satisfying, and had just the right flavors. My only complaint is, like I said, appetizers (and drinks, now that I think of it) are a bit expensive. I ordered cold tofu and it was about $4 for 5 medium sized pieces. A cold green tea was over $2 I think. Great ramen, bring some friends, bring some cash, and save some room for desserts at the market across the street.

I was recommended to this place by a friend who is a fan of ramen.  I originally came in with a party of four and was still waiting for another friend's arrival.  Upon his arrival (30 minutes later), I was told that they usually don't or can't add another person without their knowledge.  I was a little confused, especially because he didn't take up any room.  The waitress went about saying that she will take his order this time, but it's a no-no.  I thought that was the stupidest thing I have ever heard of because they weren't even that busy.  It was in the middle of the week. As for the ramen, it was okay.  I ordered the usual and could barely finish it...  I don't see what the big deal about this place is about.

Review #895 will it make a difference? i think not. but anyways, i gotta share the experience. after all the hype and reading all the Yelpers yelping about this place, i thought i'd try it w/ some friends. mind you, this is my first real Ramen experience so i can't say whether this is "the best". however, i can say it was "da bomb". yeah, not a great adjective to describe, but it's what i first thought. i ordered the "kotteri" style Daikoku Ramen and the hubby ordered the bento w/ pork cutlet, spicy tuna, and chicken. i suggested the shredded pork to our friend after i read good stuff about it here. well, the little salad was great and simple that came w/ my hubby's bento and the spicy tuna was good. but my soup, mmmmm, mmmm, good! fat and all! i noticed it had the fatty driblets floating on top compared to my friends' soups which were the regular order. it was creamy yumminess. and the soft-boiled egg, green onions, and meat, just added to the good flavors. our friends really dug the shredded pork and i admit, it tasted great. but i'm a biased pork lover. it was GOOD! i was a happy camper w/ a full belly afterward. overall, i think i would go back if not for the 1+ hour wait. that was horrendous but i would say worth it. i have yet to try other Ramen houses but as for the first experience, it was a great one.

I personally think that Daikokuya is THE best chain ramen house around! A first time look at their menu shows that they don't have much to offer, but the things that they do offer are excellent. Quality of dishes over quantity of dishes no? There is almost always a good wait to be seated if you go around lunch or dinner. The first time I ever went there I was sitting on the sidewalk hoping that I was waiting an hour for the right reason, and was I glad I was right. It's a small restaurant with a couple booths along the wall and a bar spanning the other wall. The setting is very traditional and all of the workers are of Japanese descent, if that's important for anyone; since I've seen a good number of Chinese owned ramen houses that aren't as good but still legit. My first dish was the ramen of course, tekkami styled as well; which is added back pork fat = better tasting and more flavorful soup but a higher calorie count. The noodles were cooked just right and the soup was greattt. I probably gained a couple pounds that night from finishing the soup. But since I have gone here many times now, I've expanded my choices by ordering some appetizers here and there and the fried rice. The fried rice is great as well. It has a taste like no other. It might be msg? But I doubt it since I had no symptoms of msg poisoning that night. Because of that it's a fried rice that I'd drive through LA traffic for.

I really want to love this place. I know it's raved, I know the hordes wait in line for the soup. However, I can say it was pretty ok. I get the feeling that if something tastes like "home", people love it. For instance, eating street tacos standing up with strangers in front of a catering truck feels like home to me (this is an unfortunate side-effect of growing up in the L.A. Area), and it triggers "fondness nodes" in my brain. I have this experience all the time...this just isn't my home food, if you will. The ramen was decent, the tempura sub-par,  the restaurant was stuffy and uncomfortably hot. The waitress was ok, the price could be a little better, but not bad. I may come back with a ramen-loving friend, but I won't be drawn there myself at some primal level from across town the way so many others are. Ok, let the fanatical rock hurling begin!

The soup represents the venue quite well -- they're both BOILING HOT. Although maybe it's my fault for ordering hot soup in the middle of LA summer. First time here a few days ago, so got the ramen (half size $6). I'd say it was a perfect portion for most of the population. We didn't have to wait very long at all to get in. It was a 30 minute wait, so we just walked around some of the stores in the Little Tokyo strip. Looking forward to coming back again on a cold day. I haven't tried anything else on the menu, so I can't vouch for anything but the ramen, but the place was packed, and there was always a line to get in.

I came here on a Sat night with my boyfriend and little brother around 10p.m. We had to wait about an hour to get a table. FYI- the Weiland Brewery across the street has happy hour after 10 so we hung out there and got drinks while we waited to be seated. Being veg I was sadly not able to try the ramen, BUT I did get their amazing fried rice (minus the pork)!!! Their fried rice is really tasty...very authentic! My brother got the ramen and said it was probably the best he's ever had. We started with the veggie & shrimp tempura and the edamame which were great! My boyfriend and little bro also ordered the gyoza and spicy tuna roll and they said both were delicious. All in all a great experience. =)

Just got back from Daikokuya. I dont understand the hype, the ramen is good and thats it. -Broth is ok -Noodles were very good. -Pork was bunk, it was like 2 little strips for a gallon sized bowl + not enough fat. -I DID like how they put tons of green onion! I give this place credit because its pretty legit and its probly the best ramen in its location. Id give it a 3.5 star if possible because it wasnt gross by any means. The prcies are very fair here which i liked alot! Save your time and just go to Santouka. Get Spicy Miso Ramen, blow your load.

All these good reviews, I was expecting at least a descent ramen place. Not the case. We went here around 11PM on a Friday night after landing in LAX from SF. My friend and I are huge foodies when it comes to Ramen, and although no ramen house in NorCal lives up to the ramen I have in Japan, there are some pretty bomb places up here.  I expected this place to be at least edible. There were three of us. I had a regular sized Daikokuya Ramen, and the other two had a small size (which isnt on the menu, but you can ask to order). We also ordered the Gyoza, which was good, but nothing special. So for the ramen. The two small sized ramens arrived with the noodles over-cooked and the broth luke warm. Not cool. And my regular sized ramen arrived at a perfect temperature but the noodles were undercooked and clumped together (because it was not cooked properly). None of us enjoyed the meal, and quite frankly, even though I always give a place a second try (most of the time during another time frame), I dont even want to bother coming here. I'm sure other people have had great experiences here, but maybe it was just a bad day for us.

The ramen was definitely what I was expecting and so was the soup base. I got the original Daikuko Ramen and two of my friends got the cold one where they separate the noodle from the soup. However, the soup included in the cold noodle was a bit different than ours, a bit more salty. I just with they would give you the ability to add items to the ramen like they do at shinsengumi.

This place defined my image of ramen. The tasty broth and makes me want to drink bowl after bowl until people think i'm crazy. If Shinsengumi is my first love..then Daikokuya is definitely the ramen you want to marry and take home. The Cha-shu is great... but only on the good days. I do warn you that there are bad days. I've been here quite a bit, and i'd say the odds of getting not good cha shu is 50% of the time. (but not good, i don't mean bad.. i just mean not drop dead good) They try to get every bit of flavor from pork bones and spend the entire day making this broth. You can taste it.

This was my first time at a Japanese ramen place and what an experience it was! I was with a friend from the east coast - who was born in Japan- he gave it the thumbs up for authenticity and commented that the stuffiness and heat in the restaurant  was exactly how you are suppose ramen in Japan (it was a hot summer day and i was def sweating). Depite how large that bowl was, i managed to put a huge dig to it! The combination is the way to go! For about $12 you get more than you can eat with variety! Great food with a great price is my kind of meal!

I'm hear the daikokuya... again. I think this is the 3rd time I'm here in past 2 weeks. Been coming here for several years now and I still can't get enough. My brother had been talking about it for years, but since I don't really eat pork I never bothered with it for years. Finally he brought me with him... Omg! I never knew ramen could taste so good! I took my boyfriend with me the second time and he's totally addicted to it!!! He wants to go there all the time! Some days are better then other days. I wish it could be more consistent but still good every single time. Like everyone else has said the place is small and stuffy and you defianly smell like Ramen after you leave, but its still totally worth it! If the line is long just put your name down, walk over to the Yougurtland get a quck pre- dinner dessert snack and walk back and wait. I never get the combo just the daikoku and then yogurtland.

I LOVE Daikokuya ramen. It's funny, I always walk out of Daikokuya swearing I'll order a smaller bowl or refrain from finishing my entire bowl of ramen the next time.  BUT every time I go, I always get greedy and order a ginormous bowl of kotteri (extra-fatty) ramen and a side of fried rice ..... and eat it all. Yes, it is THAT GOOD :) Anyways, the only downers are: (1) Parking in downtown LA SUCKS and (2) There is always a really really long wait. It doesn't matter if you go on a Tues night or a Sun afternoon....you will stand outside for over an hour!

Surprisingly, the wait for us wasn't that long. After hearing the horror stories from other yelpers about how long the wait is, I was afraid to come here because I usually  don't like to wait longer than 15-20 minutes for a table. We got ours in 15. The restaurant is a small hole in the wall, but very comfortable and homey atmosphere. Almost like eating at grandma's. The ramen was good, not great. The reason why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because I'm Vietnamese and our dish, pho, is more flavorful and contains more ingredients in the bowl. Nonetheless, the ramen was really good and I would definitely come back.

The only thing I didn't like about the place was the variety of ramen. There's basically only one and this other one where it was served seperate from the noodles. The pork rice bowl and salmon egg bowl were delicious! My girlfriend however says she's had better though.

This was my first experience as far as ramen houses go. and i must say it was very enjoyable. Came here again with my bff after some morning sample sale shopping, of which we found some amazing finds, but anyways... she had told me about this place before but had never had the chance to come and check it out, but this day .. we did. Walked over to the little shop to find it overflowing with people out onto the street ona rainy saturday afternoon.... my first thought  was this place must be pretty amazing for people to risk getting sick over it.  Luckily we walked in to sign the wait sheet and snagged a couple chairs inside to wait. This place was very small with only a couple booths to sit at and a couple stools at their bar area.  Appeared very cozy and smelled absolutely heavenly..... the wait itself wasn't that bad at all, and we were seated at a booth near the back and ordered immediately.  to my pleasant surprise..... this place was super cheap! =) and the food size was HUGE! I'm used to ur microwavable Maruchan from the store as ramen... this was a totally different animal...... so i ordered their Daikoku raumen combo... which comes with a small salad and choice of small rice dish from fried rice to tuna sashimi... i got the chicken teriyaki... was feeling simple that day.  Oh Lord was this meal insane..... i barely got thru half of my raumen and didnt even touch the chicken teriyaki... and it wasn't cuz it didnt taste good ... it was the complete opposite, everything was NUM NOM NUMMY GOOD! and did i said the raumen was a big serving.... thats an understatement. all this amazing food along with free refill soda .... $13.00 ..... thats a bit rediculous in my book.. i ate the rest of my soup for dinner and had the teriyaki the next day.... 3 meals for $13.00!?!??! that i say is a S W E E T deal!   go forth and enjoy the noodle!

Gyoza is amazing, noodles are okay, pork melts in your damn mouth, broth is the BEST in the Greater Los Angeles area.  Period. Accept no substitutes.  I don't care if the line is 30 minutes long for a party of two.  No.  Substitutes.  Don't bring the whole family and wait hours to get a booth, just bring a friend or two to introduce to the magic. They'll come back again.  And again.  And again.  And again. And again. I know I'm still coming back, as are the people I've brought here.  Do yourself a favor, and do the same.  Don't let the ramen-snobs fool you; this place is tasty.  Oh no, it doesn't taste like the ramen you had from a dirty cart in a back alley in Kyoto!  LIVE WITH IT.  This is delicious stuff, no two ways around it.  Ramen isn't the pinnacle of culinary arts; it's Japanese comfort food at its finest, and this is the finest Japanese comfort food in Los Angeles. For once, the hype IS real.  Daikokuya earns itself five stars with no effort exerted whatsoever. *Note: order the kotteri broth.  Your arteries won't thank you, but your tastebuds will.

What's with all the hype about this place? really? Here is my deal for this location: The gyoza, is bomb. Yes, i agree. The atmosphere, amazing. It gives you classic, old japan feel (which I know, i was born in japan, raised there, i speak the language, whatever. you know what i mean). The pork Cha-shu is great, too. It sort of melts in your mouth. Yes. im not saying its ALL bad. ANYWAY. here are my cons: soup base, its okay. Ive had MUCH better. the egg? the egg that everyone is SOOO excited about? i was surprised, to bite into it and find out it is stone cold. At least microwave it...then maybe people wont notice? Noodles, one time i had it, it was kinda mushy. The other few times were just okay. With all that said...Daikokuya is a place i would go, if all else fails in LA. But, that is super highly unlikely. Anyway, yeah, its good. If a friend wants to go, i wont object. But i wouldnt go out of my way to go here.

OK, I've been to Daikokuya twice now, and although the ramen is good, it is not the best that I've had in L.A.   First, most authentic ramen shops will ask you how you want your noodles, how strong you want the broth etc.  Daikokuya doesn't ask any of these things; they give the same ramen to everyone.  Secondly, their ramen is extremely 'heavy' for my taste.  The broth is saltier and greasier than ramen I have had at other ramen shops.   Additionally, my girlfriend and I both ordered the combination dinners which consist of a combination of ramen and a rice bowl of some kind.  She ordered a teriyaki chicken bowl, and I ordered the tempura bowl.  The bowls were actually disappointing.  First, the teriyaki sauce on her bowl was not at all like an authentic Japanese teriyaki sauce; it was thick and overly sweet like an American style teriyaki.  Secondly, my tempura came out soggy with grease, rather than crisp and light like good tempura should be.   All in all, the food at Daikokuya was good and mostly authentic, but for me, it's not worth the long waiting lines when I can go to other ramen shops and get something better without a wait.

Good Ramen! Simply the best, wait is getting longer so get there early to beat the crowd. I always order the Tsukemen, so noodles and soup came separated. Also the Gyoza is good too. That's the only place I crave for ramen if I'm in the downtown area.

I know this place is like the most highly rated ramen spot in LA, but I think it's highly overrated for their ramen. It's a tiny hole in the wall spot, with long long longggg waits, BUT before you guys start sending me hate mail, i do love this place. their pork cutlet rice bowl, mannn that ish was GOOD. the pork was so soft, it melted, and  the rice was mushy, a good mushy though. If you want to know what heaven was like, take a bite of that! Oh yeah, go with the combo, Ramen and rice bowl, not expensive at all.

After hearing rave revesw about this place from well... all my friends, I decided to hop on over and try some of this famous ramen. When my friend and I got there we were greeted by a swarm of people and it just kept growing by the minute! Normally this would make me walk around instantly, but hey 1,234 reviewers on yelp can't be wrong right? We wait for about 30-40 minutes and finally get seated on the bar-like area next to this grotesque dirty wall (sorry I can't stand dirty walls haha). As I am sitting, the waitress comes up to me "Can I take your order?" me: "uhm... sorry I just got here?" "oh... so can I take your order?" me: "uhm... not yet...?" Sorry I'm a noob this is my first time here! Geez! So after we make our decision and order, I'm beginning to feel excitement build as I wait to devour this bowl of ramen. It gets set in front of me, I put my spoon in, I taste the famous broth... meh tastes pretty good but I have definitely had better. Ok, the second most important thing in a bowl of ramen is the noodle itself. It's supposed to be yellow, springy, and slippery . Mine were yellow yes... but springy? NO. slippery? no =( needless to say, I was disappointed. Time wasted & money wasted. Honestly if you want a better ramen try Kyushu Ramen in Van Nuys and get their signature ramen the "Kyushu Ramen." oh i forgot to mention this: my friend got the deconstructed ramen. Basically its you get a bowl of cold ramen with no broth and you get the broth on the side, and the pork on a plate. Since we're sitting at the bar area we can see what the chefs are doing. The guy that was in front of us, dropped my friend's pork and then picked it up and put it back on the plate. YUMMM happy eatings =)

Adding to the thousands of review. Feels like an old ramen joint in the streets of Japan.  They have very old signs, ads and other miscellaneous stuff as decorations.  How can you miss the old school TV by the entrance?! It's still working!!  :D Another tonkotsu broth ramen place!!  I like the noodles at Shinsengumi (Gardena) better but the runny egg and the fatty chashu here are hard to beat.  I usually order it with kotteri sauce (which is... MORE PORK FAT!!). Other thing I would order is the coarse kurobuta sausage... wonderful!

What can I say that hasn't been said, oh 1200+ times already? Been here multiple times, so solid food and solid lines each time.  No need to rave any further. If you're planning on coming here on a holiday such as MLK or Labor Day, call to see if they are open.  I recommended that my friends come to the DTLA location on MLK, and they were closed the whole day!  We called the OC and Rowland branches and they were open, so I think it varies from location to location.  Hope this helps!

Wow, reading my review from two years ago is like looking in a mirror since my feelings for this place are totally different.   The soup: Very good this time.  It doesn't have a WOW factor but it definitely tasted like broth and not MSG water.  It's very good.   The noodles: Good. The pork: Bits of the pork were very, very good.  I think the pieces I received were much fattier than last time and that made all the difference.  The pork here is second only to Santouka.   The egg: Here's where the big difference is.  I received a semi-soft boiled egg of golden orange perfection.  It really is quite the difference maker.  My original bowl must have gotten screwed up but this egg definitely makes the bowl completely unique and completely worth tasting.   The fried rice: Average - will never order this again.  Rice was soggy.   All in all, my opinion has changed.  I see why there's a line.  It's just a plain good bowl of ramen.

It's alright, I don't get the hype. The restaurant is pretty cozy and usually packed, but I don't really mind it. The combination deals are pretty good, you get ramen plus your choice of a rice bowl and a small salad. It was pretty tasty as I was eating it at the restaurant, but my leftovers reeked of re-used oil once I got home. I guess I didn't notice it there since they have an open kitchen in the middle of the restaurant, but it's no wonder why my boyfriend and I left the place with the smell of oil residue stuck to all our clothes. Cozy place with good food, only if you don't mind smelling like grease.

I believe the 1,300 or so reviews speak for itself. If you're not a fan of ramen it's because you haven't been to this place. Outside of Japan, ramen here is as good as it gets. Ramen here is definitely not that kind of ramen you thought you could get in those packages. The broth is so rich and flavorful that you could really tell how much work went into it. The marinated hard boiled egg is the best as the yolk is not solidified and very creamy. My friend took the liberty of ordering gyoza and fried rice to share, which I didn't think it was going to be anything special, but boy was I wrong! The gyoza is not the typical pot sticker looking ones you get at Japanese restaurants and fried rice is not your typical Chinese fried rice. Both are so delicious and different from whatever preconceived notions you had about gyoza or fried rice. I know everyone talks about how crazy the lines here are, so I came for a late lunch at around 2:30 and there was no wait!

Delicious ramen + 15 minute wait! SAY WHAT?!! 15 minutes? How did that happen? After checking out Tuesday Night Cafe (live performances from the community) on a Tuesday night at around 10PMish, we walked straight to Daikokuya. The streets were empty so we were confident that there woudn't be a long line. But wait, a couple of people just crossed a street and a group just came out from the car. My friend told us to run for Daikokuya then. Confused as to why he made us run, I realized that the crowd was heading to Daikokuya as we passed them. We came in, swiftly wrote a friend's name, and 2 minutes right after, the crowd came in. Feeling a bit guilty, I couldn't look at them but I heard them moaning/groaning at the back. We all ordered the ramen! I think it was one of the best ramen I ever had. I have always been a big fan of dried noodles and have averted eating noodles that had soup in it. I don't really eat ramen that much either but this place got me hooked! For some reason, I really liked the soup. They aren't stingy about giving meat either. We ordered the combo: the sashimi was pretty good, the eel was about right, and the salad was really delicious. Service was excellent too. The servers very attentive and were very patient towards us. Overall, a great experience, I'm planning to come back soon, hopefully, I'll get lucky again with the short wait.

I ordered the Ramen combo with Teriyaki Chicken bowl. Good: + Combo comes with side dish of salad + Ramen soup base was really fragrant and teriyaki chicken bowl was yummy :3 + Atmosphere: makes you feel like you're back in the 50's or something at a Japanese "diner". Neat-o! + Friendly service, fairly fast and attentive + Jar of minced/mashed garlic on the side to add to your ramen... mmm... gaaaaarlic...... :D~ + Price was good for so much food! Bad: - Apparently this place is really popular, so it's quite a wait to get inside once you've signed your name. I think we waited 30-45 minutes? - The salad was mainly cabbage drenched in a mayo-mixed sauce... it was....... ok. I'm not a fan of coleslaw and it reminded me of that. So. Yea. - Wavy noodles are ok. I guess that's just preference. I actually don't have a problem with mushy noodles, but for those who don't like mushy noodles, maybe you should try elsewhere. I purposely make my noodles mushy when I cook it, so I thought that was cool, but it was just surprising.

Came here for lunch during a road trip. We got in at about 3:00p, with a 30min wait time. I've been here before so I'm accustomed to waiting. After we were seated, we knew exactly what we wanted - the specialty ramen. We got the order in about 5 minutes, and began to dig in. As I began to mix my ramen, I noticed that the ramen was a lot tougher than I remember. And the soup wasn't steaming like it usually is. Continued eating... took a bite of the ramen - slightly undercooked. Alright, I'll let it sit in the base a bit longer. Take a bite out of the boiled egg. Cold. Stone Cold. Alright... let that sit in the base a bit longer. *sighs* I was too lazy to stop a waitress. I knew they were busy. I finished my ramen a bit disappointed. My friend's eggs were also stone cold. The broth this time around was a bit thinner than I'm accustomed to. While the two pieces of pork had high than normal cuts of fat on them. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. Drive 500 miles to get some? No. Get some if you're in the area? Sure, but make sure it's hot.

This is a simple review to do.  Just do it!  Go to this place and order the combo with ramen and the pork rice bowl.  You will love it! Portions are HUGE and  I can eat a lot.   Every time I'm in LA I swear I gurgle & slosh my way out of here, in a good way of course.  =)  (Always OD on their miso broth - it really is that good!)   It's not a satisfying food  trip to LA unless I stop here for my ramen!

Came here after a Dodger-Giants Game late Friday night and even at nearly 11pm the wait was long, parking was hard to find, and they couldn't accommodate our group size. I know the Ramen is the thing to get here, but it didn't appeal to me. Yes, yes, yes - we could argue forever, invite Paula Deen and Emeril Lagasse and talk about why butter and fat adds flavor. Instead, I found it kind of disgusting...but I guess, when in Rome... What I did enjoy though was the rice bowl-Ramen combo. Great to share between two people. The rice bowl can be underestimated as small, but it was good - lots of flavor and the amount of rice was necessary to soak up all the good sauce/juice. I'd be happy to stop in here for my next visit or if I just happen to be lingering in the area...but I don't crave it at night, nor am I willing to make the drive from WLA to downtown.

Hype much???  Yea, I'd say so. We waited a good hour for two seats at the bar and it wasn't worth the wait.  Well, it was worth it in the sense that we finally got to find out for ourselves if Daikokuya is REALLY all that legit.  Haha.  I'm not saying the ramen was bad but I've had better! Daikokuya just seemed limited in serving options compared to Shinsengumi.  I like being able to choose how soft or hard I want my noodles, how oily I want my broth, and what I want accompanying my ramen... like corn!  MMM. The food: -Spicy tuna rolls "with a kick"... We searched and waited but the kick never came.  It was just  A-OK. -Ramen... Loved the broth and the pork was the best I've had in ramen!  I wasn't a fan of the noodles though. -Chicken & egg bowl... Don't do it.  The chicken was bland and dry and there was nothing special about this dish whatsoever. Things to consider: -It's Little Tokyo/LA so you know free parking will be near impossible to find.  We parked across the street for $5. -Don't come too hungry cause you might pass out from hunger while you're waiting.  We ended up walking over to the dim sum truck by Yogurtland cause I felt so weak. -They have a menu posted outside so figure out what you're going to get to save time once you're seated. I want to come back to try their cold noodles one day!!  (I love noodles).  Hopefully there won't be such a wait again.

The more I eat here, the more I like it. I'm a repeat customer and I live 6 hours away. What makes this place stand apart from other ramen joints is the broth. The soup base cooks a good while, simmering with pork bones, which doesn't sound that appetizing but it makes all the difference in the world. Bottom line- I like ramen and I LOVE this place. Sure, I have to wait a bit to eat but is it worth it? My empty bowl and full belly say yes.

Yes, this place lives up to all the yelp reviews. Ramen is top notch.   However, the wait is freaking terrible.  I've been here 3 times and waited over 2hrs.  Is the wait worth it?  Yes, for your first time.

urm.....YES PLEASE! Expect to wait in line.  Even if you show up early.  Many times there is a line that starts before the silly place opens. Why do I feel like it is worth the wait?  It's because I am a slave to the creamy fatty pork broth at this place.  I like putting the poor piggy's back fat to use when I order the KOTTERI flavored ramen.  Holy moly sipping that broth is like drinking sex. And by the time I have my first mouthful of ramen, I immediately forget that I waited 45 minutes to sit down. And I know ramen does not lend itself to being taken home, but I do anyways.  Sure, by the time I bring it back to life on the stove,  the noodles are soaked and a little gross, but it is all worth it just to sip down that magical, pork fat. I haven't tried anything else on the menu except the gyoza which quite delicious if not unusually shaped in all it's deep fried glory. While you are eating there, delight in the old fashioned Japanese posters hung from the walls of the dining room to the inside of the bathrooms.  Although you usually do not wait long for your food, you can pass the time reading Japanese magazine or mangas.

It's true ... This is the best Ramen House in Los Angeles. They just have a unique special flavor to their broth.  They serve in large portions and you will find yourself in a major food coma come 4 hours later.  LOL The drawback is that this place is so popular with the trendy crowd that you will have to wait as much as an hour even for a party of two. To best appreciate this place, try feasting on a gloomy day, after the rain, or during a very heavy storm.

Had to try this place after hearing so much about it from family and yelpers.  The ramen was outstanding, great fresh noodles, juicy pork, and out of this world broth.  Generous green onion toppings and bean sprouts and the secret ingredient: toasted sesame seeds.  Hands down the best ramen?  Could be.  I emptied the bowl... every last drop.  Awesome stuff.   Also had the shredded pork... a little salty but great tasting.  They also have tsukimen noodles on the menu for hot days (too hot to drink soup). Warning:  no vegetarian options.  Also, this location is extremely popular so arrrive early to put your name down on the waiting list. The quality of the ramen at the branch locations don't come close to this one.  Costa Mesa and Hacienda Heights are pretenders.  This one is the real deal.

Epic wait around dinner time so keep this for a late night or lunch deal. Their eel bowl is amazing and their ramen combo with a side and salad is definitely worth getting. Their broth was really delicious and the pork was so tender and fell apart in your mouth. Not the best ramen I've had but for sure something I'm coming back to.

My favorite Ramen house!!! I always get the Fried Rice+Ramen combo. I can almost NEVER finish it but that rice dipped in the broth is too delcious to resist. First off, Daikokuya has perfectly cooked noodles that are just the right chewiness in a creamy, rich broth. I do not even like hard-boiled eggs, but their overnight-marinated eggs are definitely more than edible. The pork is always nice and fatty and soft melt-in-your mouth awesomeness. The bean sprouts and bamboo shoots add such a delicious touch to the ramen. The rice is so good. too. Not too greasy with pieces of their yummy pork into it. The cabbage salad that they serve you with their combo is really good too. The dressing is nice and creamy and goes really well with the plain pieces of shredded cabbage. BEST RICE/SOUP/NOODLES. This place usually has a wait of at least 20 minutes and parking is really a pain, but it's worth every minute and aggravating moment!!! I like to come during awkward times like 3 or 4 o clock and theres usually parking and no wait! :)

I would've given it 5 stars if it weren't for the ridiculously long waiting time. I've been here four times already (12pm, 6pm, 8pm, 10pm), and every single time I have to wait for about an hour; don't come super hungry/starving because you WILL have to wait. Also, try going with maybe one to two other friends - parking around the area is a pain in the butt, so you can always get somebody to place his/her name on the waiting list first while you attempt to find parking. =P It's also easier to get seated quickly too - you're either sitting at the bar or at tables that can only fit 4 people tops. Tere was this one family of 7 one time, and they were actually waiting for the longest time since they only had one table for big groups. =// The place is pretty small and can get a bit stuffy, but I suppose their service is fast and the waiters/waitresses are friendly. I highly recommend getting the Daikoku Ramen Combination, where you get to choose a variety of rice bowls. My friends really liked that the shredded pork bowl, but my personal favorite is their fried rice. And, if your stomach can handle the grease challenge, you should definitely order your ramen with the kotteri flavor - it makes the ramen sooooo much yummier (but fattier)! =P

Was in Little Tokyo to see the Obon festival and decided to get the "best ramen in LA." Waited probably 20 minutes and browsed the next door stores. Paid 8.99 for their specialty ramen. Broth was rich and did not taste like soy sauce water like most ramen places. Portions were pretty big (struggled to finish, but that's also because I like drinking the soup). Tasty, and a good try if you like ramen.

Food: Best ramen I've had, hands down. Ordered the combo - ramen + fried rice. The broth is perfect. Add the optional side of pork fat into your soup. Fried rice was not bad but I've had better. Service: Pretty good even for the large crowd. Super friendly staff. Misc:  Be prepared to pay ~$4 - $8 for parking unless you find street parking.  If you go with a large group (over 5), be prepared to split up.  On busy days, the wait can be over an hour.

I came here around a good time i think considering i only waited less than half an hour.   now the ramen: it was amazing, i got the daikoku kotteri with the pork bowl combo. the broth was sooo tasty, i didn't wanna add anything to the ramen just so i can taste the broth. the pork in both the ramen and the bowl was juicy and tasty. although halfway through the meal my sister wanted to trade so i had her salmon roe bowl, which was also good it was very fresh and salty. the egg in the ramen was full of flavor, and the noodles where perfectly cooked. the size of the bowls where good, much bigger than the one at santouka. i'd definitely go here again, but be warned, only go here with a group of four. if it was closer, id go everyday haha.

Waited an hour to spend 15...OMG this place is crowded...x.x However, the food really can't be argued against.  The ramen here is really good.  The noodles are curly, which I LOVE compared to some other places I've been, and the broth is savory without being oversalted.  Plus, the ingredients in there are tasty too.  Nice pieces of marbled pork...yummmm Also had the pork over rice...which was MUCH better than the one at Santouka since it came with onions and green onions...perfect with ginger and ramen. The coleslaw salad is pretty good...I love the dressing, but I've never been a huge fan of raw cabbage...at all...hrm still worth a shot...just bring entertainment

Everytime we've been to this place the line have been really really long. Everytime we decide we'll just try it next time. Finally one afternoon we decided to just go and wait...and it was worth it. The ramen broth was flavorful and satisfying. The ramen itself was cooked well, the pork was amazing according to the bf. The tempura is fried to perfection....what more can i say? The only downpoint to this place is that it gets really smoky and hot because they cook the ramen right in the front, so if you're sitting in the ramen bar area, be prepared to smell like ramen when you leave! Also be prepared to WAIT. It'll be worth it, but it's definitely a long wait!

I've never really been a fan of ramen. But I can honestly say, I FREAKING love daikokuya! This is the best ramen I have ever tried. I have tried Orochon across the street, but I didn't like it. (I don't freaking care that there are different levels of spiciness that you can choose from!) What I want is a simply savoury soup and real ramen noodles. So, I choose to eat at Daikokuya because it is simple yet delicious. I crave it's savory creamy broth, those thick cut slices of melt-in-your-mouth pork, and the perfectly cooked ramen noodles. The combos are a really great deal. I usually get the unagi or the tuna bowl combos and I like the little salad it comes with. It's a great deal of food for the price. I never end up finishing all my items. I know that you can eat ramen at home and a packet of instant ramen will run you about 30 cents. But seriously, fuck that shit! Go to Daikokuya for truly delicious ramen. You will not regret it!

Finally came back for the second time last Tuesday. I'm not a big fan. Waited for almost 45 minutes for a table for two (we got there around 8.30PM). Ordered spicy tuna roll and two daikoku ramen kotteri style. Spicy tuna is pre-made, I'm pretty certain, because the rice was kind of hard and very dry. The spicy tuna itself is pretty good. The ramen broth was not as reach as I thought it would be, but the noodles were very good. It was firm and tasty. Why the 3 stars? Because for the wait time and the food that I get, I'm not sure if I would go back again and wait outside. Or maybe I'm bias, I love Orochon. And I've heard this so many times.. either you love Orochon or you love Daikokuya. They are very different in taste, I think.

Wow this place has been raved about on Yelp. I'm so glad I got to try it. I'm from Atlanta and we don't have many ramen spots like LA does. It was something I've been craving for a long long time so I finally got to eat it last night. The location is in downtown/Little Tokyo so there is huge traffic when it comes to wanting to eat at this tiny restaurant. The wait for dinner: 1 1/2 hours. Yes, crazy I know. We walked around Little Tokyo, stopped by Chop Suey Cafe, sat in the car and talked to other people waiting in line. I got the ramen, of course. Was thinking about the combo meal but it's a little too much for me. GREAT deal though. A bowl of ramen and a small rice bowl. I could if I was a cow. Best ramen I've had so far in my life and in LA. Get there early or during lunchtime when people are in and out.

Location/parking: Expect to walk up to 4 blocks. There are metered spots and parking lots around. Seating/wait: Always a wait. Usually an hour long during busy hours. Service: The servers I encounter usually only speak English well enough to take orders. Great service-as expected from Japanese run stores. Food: Combination: Daikokuya ramen and small shredded beef bowl and Combination Daikokuya ramen and small fried rice. I've had better Japanese fried rice. It's nothing spectacular here. The Shredded beef bowl was good but not jaw dropping. The ramen was amazing! Everything from the broth, to the tenderness of the noodles and consistency of the meat was worth the travel and wait. Ask for Kotteri (a side of the fat from the meat) to add into your broth. The kick if worth the extra calories. Décor/ Ambience: Small sushi bar look. Just like an other Japanese style restaurant. Dogs: No outdoor seating, not dogs. Lots of people!

Ramen here is among the best I have ever had! The soup here really hits the spot! And the chashu (meat) they have is really tasty. You just have to try it! To be honest, I was never really that much into ramen until I came here. I had been to Santouka Ramen before (and always thought it was yummy), but Daikokuya kinda put me in this ramen craze where I actually crave ramen! Anyway, both Daikokuya and Santouka are up there in my book! I could go for either of these places at a moment's notice... if only it weren't so hot in LA right now!

Came here last night (saturday) around 8 50 pm. We had to wait until around 10 for our seats. That wasnt a really a problem for me because 1. it was a saturday night its going to be busy anywhere. 2. I really wanted to try this place because my friends said it was really good. I ordered the daikokuya ramen + sashima rice bowl combination.  First the prices are right at this place. The small sashima rice bowl came with 4 well sized pieces of tuna.  The ramen was well portioned too. I hate places that offer these combination deals and give you a small bowl of ramen. Not Daikokuya they give you a regular sized bowl of ramen.    Well those were pros about this place.   The broth was bland to me and thats why i give it only 3 stars also factoring the wait time.  I was actually suprised that it wasnt too salty because most ramen places make their broth salty as fuck.  Anyways I am going to brush this off as a mistake because they were busy. The only reason i would come back to this place is because the pork they use if fucken crazy good.

This place did not disappoint. The ramen and broth was first rate and as good as Shin Sen Gumi (my personal favorite). One thing that did annoy me was how quickly they put the bill on my table when I was not done eating yet. Most Japanese restaurants I eat at will never give you the bill till you specifically ask for it, no matter how busy they are. I still give it four stars though as the quality of the food is too good to go any lower.

Been convinced to eat here many times by friends even though I think place is too hyped up. Expect a wait when you come whether its for lunch or dinner. Structure parking is not validated since this ramen place isn't in the Tokyo Plaza.. As for the ramen, the broth is very flavored I must admit, but the noodles taste just like another other place. For big stomachs, the portion would be perfect because they do give you a generous portion of ingredients.

So I've been wanting to come here for the past year or so, but there was always a huge wait whenever we were in Lil' Tokyo. But this time we were on a mission to get in and it was well worth the wait. Best freaken ramen I've ever had, ever. Everything just went so well with each other, all the flavors were there. I have to say that I was a bit skeptical at the beginning with the sight of so many green onions piled on top. It felt like I was in a Chinese restaurant for a second, and I usually don't like green onions either. BUT! I ate all them green onions down with the soup cause it was so good. If a dish can make something you don't like good, and have you clean the whole bowl out, it's DAMN good. The waiters were really efficient too though, so they were good too, but their food was better. I was a little curious about the waiter holding a blackberry, I think he was inputing orders through a program. Thought that was neat, anyways this place is a must. Daikakuya over Orochan over Gomen over Ajisen, in that order.

If this was 5-6 years ago, I would give Daikokuya an easy 5 stars, but nowadays, the "the best ramen of Los Angeles" is nothing more than a distant memory. Head down to Little Tokyo and you find yourself under a yellow awning with a swarm of tourists and Los Angelenos waiting for around a hour to get yourself some traditional Japanese ramen. Is it worth the wait? Not anymore. The quality of the food has definitely gone down since half a decade ago. It don't feel that lip smacking good feeling that I used to feel when sitting down to a nice bowl of ramen. The soup base is a bit less decadent than it used to be and the noodles and chashu has seen better days. Maybe its cause Daikokuya is such a small restaurant and there is an impatient mob forming outside, but the preparation of the ramen is just not there and lacks attention and quality. It isnt just the ramen either. The gyoza (dumplings) is fried to hell and the fried rice that I adore is no better than what I can get at a medicore asian restaurant. Am I being too harsh? Not really... On every visit, I hear random people walking by asking the people outside whether the food is good here. Usually the answer is: "The best ramen I have ever tasted". Really? Is it the best ramen you every tasted? I highly doubt it if you have tried other places in Los Angeles. Daikokuya is definitely the most popular ramen joint I have visited, but I have tasted better.

To think, I waited 30 minutes on Friday night at 1130PM for Ramen, having not had dinner and a stressful evening. But, the wait is worth it. This is my second time here at this location (now they have branched out to other suburbs), and I think the menu makes this place great - it's simple. Just get the Daikokuya Ramen. It comes out quick, but it's also good. The soup is delicious, the ramen cooked just right, the pork tender and tasteful. And if you wanted more taste and to avoid making out afterwards, you can spoon heapfuls of minced garlic, add a dash of white pepper, and it's the closest thing to Japan (I guess, never been). Definitely a place to go if you like Ramen.

Daikokuya serves an original style ramen. The soup is made with rich tonkotsu broth with shoyu seasoning. They get 4 stars because the flavor of the ramen soup is not always consistent. (Good ramen shops should have consistent flavor in their soup) The soup sometimes is perfectly tasty and flavorful, but sometimes I have to sprinkle a bit of pepper to get that extra kick in flavor. But overall the al dente ramen compliments the ramen soup very well. Their chashu is also very tender. I don't usually like hard boiled egg, but it's very well prepared here.  =P The kotteri version is a lot richer and tastier. I don't order it because the broth is really just too rich for me.  I just like to try a sip of the broth when my friends order it.   I also like the gyoza. I love the amount of green onions they put on top of it! The line is usually long so be prepared to wait!

I will forever be in pursuit of the perfect ramen joint.  Some have come close, but all lacks points in some department [Asa scored a nice 5 for me, but still opens at 6pm and doesn't beat every other ramen place in every department - still it is about as close as it gets]. Okay. so Daikokuya.  I've heard about it - never was able to conveniently get to it.  I was in L.A. and had a free night so I figured now would be the perfect time! #1. Getting there: Street parking.  I don't frequent ramen too often in metro areas, but seriously street parking sucks at night - Saturday night.  Somehow, every other ramen joint I've been to in the states has been in a plaza [I am so thankful for this] and so getting there was never a problem.  Parking makes WANTING to go to Daikokuya a problem. #2. Waiting: I'm used to waiting for Hakata Ramen Shinsengumi, but this is really waiting.  I probably waited almost an hour, at least 45 minutes for a party of 2.  Everywhere else is open either immediately or has a 20 min-ish wait.  Ebisu had the longest wait before that, at 35-ish minutes because two humongous groups had gotten there just before us, it was weekend lunch rush, and we had a group of 6. #3. Ramen:  Ramen was okay.  Soup was decently flavorful and oily, maybe a bit heavy for some - noodles were standard, nothing special.  I'd probably attribute that oily goodness to the kurobuta bones they use.  As a ramen shop, this part is weighted heavily, and it just doesn't really stand out.  No advertised kaedama.  Sometimes I'm just really hungry and want a second bowl of noodles. #4. Toppings: Pork fat. Pork. Fat. Kurobuta. Delicious.  This is probably their secret [well not secretive secret, but trump card secret... yeah.. anyways] ingredient.  If you want more, order fried rice - they use it in that.  Don't think about the fact that it's probably fried in the pork belly fat, but relish in the deliciousness that is kurobuta - the fat really is unlike fat from anything else [except in the mind-blowing realm of real kobe beef - but nowhere the same].  The greasiness might be too much for some, again, which is where kobe beef rules [but doesn't belong in ramen].   #5.  Atmosphere: old decor, slightly homey but not really.  Small, noisy, encourages casual conversation with your table mate [or bar mate] and enjoying ramen. #6. Price:  Why is it more expensive than Hakata Ramen?  I don't know.  Maybe their tonkotsu base is more expensive... beats me. Verdict:  The kurobuta takes the spotlight here.  If you're looking for a relaxing bowl of ramen and a delicious delicious plate of fried rice, then consider this.  If Daikokuya's other locations offer the same food with a parking lot and shorter lines, I might bump their score to 4, however, their ramen is still more expensive and isn't anything particularly special - no kaedama either.

Are you a ramen-lover? Are you looking for great ramen? And will you stop at nothing to get the best ramen in town? If you answered "YES!", to any of these questions than you, my friend need to come to Daikokuya. I, like many yelpers, adore this place. Their ramen is the best -- metaphorically, it's like finding the perfect man. Why so much hype? Let me break it down for you. The broth is amazing (you can read on the menu how they make it). It has a deep, rich flavor that coats your throat, so you're getting nothing but a whole lot of ramen-goodness, all over your tastebuds. Their noodles are the perfect texture (slightly aldente but so yummy) and tasty. Their meat (Char Siu) is soft, tender and packed with flavor. And the egg. Oh dear. It is the most perfect soft-boiled egg, ever to swim in a bowl of ramen. It's like the planets have aligned, the stars have opened up and you hold the secret to life: exceptional, harmonious ramen. I'm smiling as I write this, because this place is like home. It's small, it's comforting and it brings back great memories with Dan K. Not to mention, the service is decent. ADVICE: Parking sucks. Always expect a wait at Daikokuya. And come in small groups. Put all of that aside, however, and divulge yourself into probably the best ramen experience of your life.

When I was in Tokyo, I had the best ramen of my life.  Ever since I've come back home to Southern California, I've been looking for a place that can compete.  Daikokuya is my #1 choice.   The wait for a table may be long, but it is well worth it, my friends.  The broth is layered with flavor.  I start salivating just thinking about it.  They don't skimp on the green onions as well.  And the noodles have great texture - a little chewiness, a little bite, all delectable.

It was perfect ramen weather the other day so my boyfriend and I hopped in the car and headed to J-Town to try Daikokuya.  We've had Daikokuya ramen in Costa Mesa and Hacienda Heights and thought it was alright but a lot of people raved about the ramen specifically at this location so we decided to give it a try. I've heard horror stories about the wait so we arrived 5 minutes before they opened and was one of 3 parties already in line.  Over the course of a few minutes, more and more people started coming to line up  near the restaurant.  All this was happening BEFORE the place even opened.  They opened the doors promptly at 11am and all the seats were filled by 11:05. My bf and I ordered both ordered the daikoku ramen combination.  He ordered the sashimi side and I ordered the fried rice side.  We also ordered some gyozas to start off our meal. The service was quick and attentive.  Our drinks came out promptly followed by the complimentary salad.  The salad seemed like their take on cole slaw and it was delish despite having too much dressing. Their gyozas look more like spare ribs when they come out (check out the pics and you'll see what I mean).  It's topped with a generous amount of green onions (yum) and it comes out in one ginormous piece which you have to pull apart.  It was delicious and we gobble it all up within minutes. Our side dishes and the ramen came out shortly after the appetizer.  The fried rice was good but not as tasty as Mentatsu in Costa Mesa.  The sashimi bowl gave a generous amount of fish.  The fish was okay, not the freshest but this is a ramen place after all. As for their famous ramen, I just thought it was just okay.  The broth tasted similar - maybe slightly better than -  the Daikokuya locations in Costa Mesa and Hacienda Heights. The broth is flavorful but I feel that it lacks the depth of Santoka's broth.  Also, the broth seemed to cool down way too quickly for my taste.  Maybe I don't eat fast enough or it's something to do with their bowl's ability to retain the heat but the broth was too cool for my taste halfway through my meal. :/  I noticed the same issue when I ate at the Hacienda Heights location about a month ago. Overall, I'm glad I tried it but it's not worth the wait or drive for me to go all the way here.  Santouka is still my fave ramen place.

So my gf and I decided to go try this place out since it was a cold night.  I've heard the reviews and knew about the long wait.  We arrive there and put our name down.  The wait was only maybe 40 minutes since it was on a weekday and we went kind of early to beat the dinner crowd.  I ordered the Daikokuya Ramen with Eel.  I loved the salad that came with the combo.  It tasted like a japanese cole-slaw almost.  The eel bowl was awesome.  It was a good size portion and I can tell that the Eel was very fresh. After trying these two items, I move on to my ramen thinking that its going to be just as good.......I taste it.........and have this puzzled look like.......that's it?  This is what I waited in line for?  I taste it again and soon I realized that I wasn't impressed with the ramen.  I'm not saying that it was bad, but it wasn't anything that deserved me to wait in line for 40 minutes.  The portions were good for the ramen, but the flavor of the broth was non-existent practically.  If you feel like trying this place out then be my guest, but don't think that you're going to have the best ramen ever.......cause its not.

This is seriously the best ramen I have ever had. And I've spent the last 6 months scouring all of California for the best ramen. The only thing is it seems like the whole west coast knows about this place because it is always packed. Worth the hour wait though. You have to try it once. Then all other ramen will be mediocre after this. Which is kinda sad. :(

I so want to give this place 3.5 stars because I'm not quite  a "fan" ONLY  due to the ridiculous wait on a Wednesday night at 8:30 pm. Had this place NOT had a crazy wait, it would have been a solid 4.5 or maybe even 5, due to great taste and great prices! It IS worth a 45 minute wait, once or twice (dunno about 90 minutes like some yelpers waited).  I'm definitely glad I came to try it.  What surprised me the most was that I enjoyed their non-ramen dishes SOOOOOO very much. GET THE COMBO!!! It's only $2 more and so very very worth it! And the ramen bowl is the same humungous size.  I thought it was a mistake when they brought it out! The shredded pork bowl was to die for and the the salad, which uses the standard dressing, but somehow, it just tastes better here.  and i don't think it was just because i was starving from the wait! The quality, texture and taste of their meats is superb (coming from someone who stews meats quite often!).  The shredded pork was so soft and the loads of green onion and garlic complimented it perfectly.  They know what works with their dishes and aren't afraid to use it! The meat in the ramen was also very good, and I think one of the best parts of the ramen.  The egg was cooked perfectly and the noodles were nice and firm.  I haven't had a lot of experience with ramen so I was surprised at how heavy heavy and filling the ramen noodles were.  The noodles themselves were probably my least favorite part, but with the yummy broth I couldn't stop scarfing it down.   The portion of ramen is HUUUGGEEEEEE!!!!! I'm an EATER, and had to let my boyfriend polish off the noodles for me.   As a couple we ordered one combo ramen/rice bowl and another ramen and gyozas.  We ended up bringing almost all the rice bowl home and half the gyozas.   Service is awesome, very attentive and on top of it.  We sat at the bar, where I thought it would be tight, but it turned out to be just fine. Now... I heard that I got lucky with only a 45 minute wait.  Hearing that, I don't think I'll be back unfortunately.  With the multitudes of ramen places around, I'll be searching for somewhere just as good without the wait, but they'll have some pretty big shoes to fill as this place was just wonderful.

Four stars for the broth, authenticity, and gyoza - but only 3 for the quality of the noodles. But since it is so affordable as well, I'll give it 4 stars. This is the only restaurant where you'll enter and you see solidified animal fat on the walls - that is just the only fact you need to know to figure out how flavorsome this place is! Ah, this broth is TO DIE FOR! Wish the ramen was fresher though.

I've been coming here for a few years now, and all I can say is  Daikokuya is by far one of the best Japanese Ramen spots I've been too. I would've given it 5 stars if I wrote this review years ago, but since I'm writing it now I'll give it a 4, because the wait here is RIDICULOUS. It sucks even more at the fact that it's LA, and parking(street) is a real pain in the butt; especially in this area. There are parking structures, but if you're coming after 8 o'clock than street parking is free, which makes it even harder to find parking because around that time there are usually swarms of cars circling around the area looking for parking. If you don't mind paying like 4-5 dollars(I think) to park in the structure, than great, but if you're cheap like me, I rather find free parking. Okay, about the food; I just get the Daikokuya Ramen, which is just absolutely amazing. Everytime I come here, I must finish the whole bowl; if not I feel sad, haha. The soup of the ramen is hot, delicious and flavorful, I  just can't explain it, but it is just simply perfection in a bowl. For their appetizers, I've tried their sausage and gyoza. If you were to choose one I would go with the gyoza. The chicken and egg bowl is pretty yummy too but after a while you start feeling a little sick from it so you should share. Lastly, get a side of salad, because the salad is good too. Service is good. I love the guy server with glasses because of his accent. I just get really happy when I hear him call out numbers from the clipboard, makes my experience there that much better.(I sound like total creep). All in all Daikokuya's food is pleasing to my tastebuds. I just don't go here as much anymore since I'm really impatient and the wait is just too long, and the other Daikokuya's just don't compare. But if you haven't been here yet and are willing to wait in a long line, I guarantee you it'll be worth it!

Many ramen spots have the broth, this spot has the broth + the best noodles around. OMG I waited over an hour to eat here and wasn't disappointed. Staff was friendly and the noodles are so fresh. Wow 5 stars for the ramen, 1 star off because with waits like that move to a bigger spot already!!!!!!!!!

I was told about the hype here, so I had to try it out. Usually this place is packed and there are lines out the door, but my friends and I were lucky and came right before the rush. The portions of the food/ramen here are really big and totally worth it. The salad is so yummy. How do I usually judge ramen? I always try the soup first. The soup was pretty tasty, but I feel that it was too oily for my taste. But I guess that's what makes ramen taste good in general. This ramen shop is pretty small, so I don't recommend bringing big parties. They probably only have around 10 tables or so and a bar to sit at. Definitely a ramen place to go to if you're in LA.

5 stars for being the best ramen i've tried! I'm not a big fan of ramen, but I'll come here anyday :). The soup is so rich and flavorful, and the noodles are perfect. I would recommend getting the combo, since it's such a great value. I usually get it with the fried rice which is really great as well. I'm partial to the gyoza appetizers, but my friend always wants to order them. Come early for lunch and dinner if you don't want to wait. There's literally 6 booths and a few barseats in here, so you'll probably be waiting a long time if you come late.... Daikakuyo better than ippudo (nyc) better than santouka (westside)

Thanks to the job, I tend to find myself in downtown LA nearly every Thursday night. Which led me, weeks ago, to Daikokuya for the first time - thanks Yelp! Criteria was as follows: close, cheap, casual and somewhere that would require no small talk with other patrons or a bartender. Mission accomplished. The line for Daikokuya is no joke.  But once you're in, it's so worth it. There are a few other things on the menu (tempura, gyoza, fried rice) but the ramen is the thing that's worth making the random trip to Little Tokyo for. The broth at Daikokuya is just slightly salty and rich and velvety and cloudy and the chashu is amazing - not too fatty with just the perfect amount of smoke. Toppings are standard - bean sprouts, eggs, bamboo shoots, and a gigantic mountain of green onions. As most other Yelpers will attest to, the top two ramen joints holding it down are Daikokuya and Santouka. IMO, neither win in the ambiance category for sure, nor does one really kick ass at customer service or wait times. But if you're in the mood to eat alone, feel like making zero decisions and slurping down a hot, satisfying bowl of salty broth and pork, Daikosuya is your place.

After my terrible experience with Hakata Ramen Shinsengumi and through some discussion with my friends, I've discovered just how subjective preferences can be when it comes to ramen.  So if you have similar tastes to mine, hope this helps: For Ramen: Daikokuya Los Angeles = 5/5 (firm noodles make it even better) Orochon Ramen = 4/5 (pretty solid) Ajisen Premium Pork Ramen= 3 (I was pretty hungry...there was barely any soup but this mainstream not even Japanese owned ramen shop wasn't bad...) Naga Naga = 2.5 (unmemorable experience, as expected from mainstream ramen place) Hakata Ramen Shinsengumi = 1/5 (hrmm...I cannot stand the soup base) Spicy Fried Rice: Daikokuya Los Angeles = 4/5  (has "high heat wok flavor") Orochon Ramen = 3/5 (decent but lacks the above) Ajisen Ramen = 2.5/5 (average) BTW...I waited with my friend in the blistering cold for ~50 minutes before being seated.  We were #26 on the waiting list, with 2 names crossed off when we arrived I believe.  Lucky for us at least half of those people left otherwise I'd assume we'd still be waiting for our table...

My first ramen love and still one of my favorites. I wandered into Daikokuya - probably like quite a few others - after reading a Jonathan Gold write up of the restaurant in L.A. Weekly. Up to that point, when I had Japanese soup it was udon and if I had ramen, it came in a styrofoam cup or a cellophane wrapper. All that changed after my first bowl of soup at Daikokuya. The dense, pork flavored broth and the chewy, but tasty noodles were a world away from cup o' noodles. I was immediately hooked and quite a few years later, ramen remains one of my major comfort foods. I have visited Daikokuya dozens of times since then and it remains a favorite restaurant. I have tried the gyoza - decent wrapper, so-so filling. I love the pork cutlet bowl - tender pork, panko encrusted and quick fried, over rice with a fried egg on top. I have ordered the kichi-men, which has a unique, slightly sour broth, and the regular tsukemen. In both, cool noodles are dipped in the broth, rather than served in the soup. Both delicious. The side salad that comes with the combo meals - finely shredded cabbage topped with a little spicy mayo - is simple, but quite satisfying too. But it is the Daikoku ramen that I go to Daikokuya for and it never disappoints. I like it "kotteri" style, with the broth denser and richer from extra pork goodness. Kurobota chashu, bean spouts, bamboo shoots, scallions, a marinated boiled egg and sesame seeds round out the bowl of soup and noodles. I usually add a scoop of garlic, available at the table to spike up the flavor. The chashu is perhaps a little fatty and I tend to prefer a slightly thinker cut of pork, but that is a small quibble.  The noodles are just average, but not bad. Portions tend towards the large size. A regular bowl of soup is quite large. The kitchen and the servers are friendly and efficient. Seating is in around 7 or 8 booths and at an L-shaped counter adjacent to the soup kitchen which allows you to watch the ramen makers at work while you dine. It can get a little hot, but that just gives you one more good reason to order a cold beer. The dining room is decorated with vintage Japanese signs and ads and a variety of Japanese music is piped in. After years of eating in the dining room, I find the setting very welcoming - revisiting a cherished spot. The downside? Be prepared to WAIT. Sometimes a LONG wait.  There is a list of names at the door and the staff is pretty efficient in getting people in and out of the restaurant without ever making the meal seem rushed. However, the wait can seem endless when you are fiending for a bowl of ramen. Highest recommendation.

I came here on a Saturday afternoon around 2:30PM and luckily, we only waited about 45 minutes for a party of 2. Note, I had eaten breakfast around 11 so I wasn't particularly hungry at all, but since we were in the area, I thought heck, why not try the famous Daikokuya ramen. And let me just say, it did NOT disappoint! I ordered the ramen and fried rice combo and it was sooo good! I've had my fair share of ramen, from shin sen gumi to santouka, but I must say that this place is my favorite! The broth here is more milky and creamy, without being overly salty, and the pork slices are thick and tasty! Also, their noodles are chewier and not the typical thin ramen noodles, and they have a perfectly cooked, soft-yolked egg with each bowl. (nom nom nom). The fried rice here is also a really good dish but the ramen was just so tasty I didn't dare stuff my stomach with anything else. Despite the long wait, I will definitely come here again for the ramen. It's just too bad they don't offer take-out! P.S. They give out a cabbage salad/slaw with the combo but it's just ok so save room for the ramen!

Went on a Thursday night at 845pm and still had to wait an hour. Even after getting seated, the line had not gone down at all. But sooo worth the wait! Started off with the gyoza, which was awesome. Got the combo ramen (with the kotteri, the extra fat in the soup) and the fried rice and my friend got the combo with the shredded pork bowl. The kotteri was a great choice as it made the soup more yummy. People rave about the fried rice and I didn't think it was memorable and I don't think I would order it again. The shredded pork bowl was very very good though. Too bad I don't live in LA or I would come here all the time and probably gain 10lbs in the process. Be warned that the combo is more than enough food for one person. I can eat a lot and was full off of just the ramen. One thing though, because of the high volume, I would not expect cleanliness. It's not that the tables are dirty or anything is outright unsanitary but you just know you don't wanna be touching too much. Not so much a negative for this place more than just understanding the high volume and the fact that things like the tables/chairs don't necessarily get cleaned completely. Things like the dishes are fine.

This was probably the best Japanese ramen I have had in recent memory.  The broth is perfectly seasoned (I like to add a generous amount of the Japanese chili powder to give it some kick).  They give a generous portion of pork in the soup which is nice and they certainly give you what you pay for.  The noodles are cooked perfectly, not too hard or soft.   Service is excellent and staff are fast and efficient as to accommodate the masses of diners.  The prices are fair and I would definitely pay $10-$12 for this bowl of ramen, no question.  Watch out shin-sen-gumi, orochon, and whatever other ramen houses there may be.  This is simply the best. The only criticism I have of this place is the insanely long wait times.  Although it's not their fault that they are so popular.  Word of advice though, if you go during dinner time, expect to wait anywhere from 1-2 hours.  Excellent dining experience overall.

This place really lives up to its reputation.  One of the best if not the best ramen place in L.A.  Been here  a couple of times and have tried their famous Daikoku Ramen and Shredded Pork bowl.  the Daikoku Ramen was just delicious! The broth was just flavorful and the pork belly just tender and awesome as well.  The Shredded Pork Bowl was a great dish also using pork belly and had this sweet glaze that really compliments the flavor.  Something I've noticed thought is that they seem to use a lot of green onion in their dishes, doesn't really matter their dishes are still delicious.  The only downside, the place can get crowded so come early especially in the evenings.

Thank god LA has such fantastic weather, because you're going to be waiting awhile to eat at this tiny Ramen house in Little Tokyo. But oh how its worth it. As I enjoyed my Sapporo beer and tucked into my bowl of piping hot ramen soup, I lamented the fact that I did not live in LA, and have the pleasure of enjoying this little slice of comfort food every day. The broth was much more flavorful than any MSG laden Nissen soup I associate with ramen. I could taste the complexity of the meat flavor with each sip of the broth. Did I also mention that the meal is totally filling and affordable. Loved it...

Since this is ranked on Yelp's top 10 list and my roomie has been a regular for quite some time, I thought it would be amazing.  Yes, they give you a huge bowl with all the toppings in it (green onions, bean sprouts) and it's good for the price, but having to pay cash and waiting forever to get some ramen is just not worth it for me.  I'd rather just drove to Gardena and get some Shin-Shen Gumi.  It was worth a try..

mmmmm!!! 4.5 stars!!! and if i werent sick that day.... it would have probably been a 5!!! this was our first stop in LA and in the cold, waited a little over an hour to be seated... but it was well worth it! the three of us ordered gyozas and the daikokuya special. watching the tables next to us eat made us really want to order fried rice too but we knew that we were just hungry and would probably order more food than we could handle. and since we were just visiting.... where the hell are we going to keep the leftovers?! the wait was long but the food came out really speedy! ohhh steamy hot ramen! it was just what i had needed for getting over a cold! the broth was rich with little pieces of fat floating on top, the noodles were nice and chewy, there were plenty of sprouts and bamboo (i love bamboo btw) and my egg was somewhat soft boiled! yummmm!!! cant say that socal ramen beats norcal ramen.. but it was DEFINITELY a delicious bowl of ramen! my friend even says that the gyozas here are her FAVORITE! thats a pretty big deal when i think of it! how many places serve gyozas?

I had really, really, really, high hopes. Maybe, it's because of my high hopes and expectations for this place caused this super low..review. It was a horrible rainy weekend. But, what else would satisfy my inner goodies with a hot bowl of Ramen? So, in my boots, and almost broken umbrella, signed my name away to a 2ish hour wait. Shopped around the "Japan center" across the street, and came back with my name being called. Ordered the Gyoza. - Never had anything like this, they were rectangular, and pan fried REALLY well. I like my Gyoza crispy on the outside, browned, NOT BURNT, and hot in the center. I am VERRY picky about my Gyoza, which is WHY I never order it outside, because I can perfect my own in my own kitchen. Anyways, their Gyoza was up to my standards. =) BF had the Ramen bowl + Tuna Rice Bowl. - His Tuna was soo fresh, and sliced very thin. Very typical Japanese sashimi bowl. Ramen: Now, this is where it all goes down hill. Soup - didn't taste much flavor. I guess, it was supposed to be Miso? I just didn't taste much, so I just poured TONS of spice all over it. Came with a soy sauce braised egg; 2 pieces of cha siu & some veggies. Didn't appeal to me at all. =( Maybe, JUST maybe...if I happen to be around this area again, and I have nothing else to do but walk around for 2 hours hungry, and give this place another shot w/ their Ramen.... i might just do it.. but then again, I don't think i'd do that to myself...ever, again. * My BF did mention that you could add more "flavor" to the Ramen since they had an option to add more Concentrate to your soup? But I don't see why you would need to ask them to ADD more flavor to an "already yummy Ramen."  Unless, it's bland. Oh, duh.   =( Price - a bit on the pricey side. $12+ for my ramen alone.

Eating here feels like being transported to a tiny ramen shack in Japan. The cramped kitchen bar with people slurping their noodles vigorously, the cooks and waitress shouting back and forth in Japanese, and of course the bowl of porky noodle deliciousness in front of you. I haven't had a single bad item on the menu here, and the quality has always been consistent.      For 8.50 you get the trademark bowl of tonkotsu ramen and it's worth every penny. Tonkotsu broth is made from simmering pork bones (and other ingredients depending on that shop's recipe) for hours and hours until the resulting soup is the pure essence of pork. Daikokuya's broth is so creamy and rich you may have to hold back the urge to chug that wonderful nectar the first time you have a taste. Swimming in that broth are springy and flavorful ramen noodles, slices of melt in your mouth pork belly, pickled bamboo shoots, a soy sauce marinated soft-boiled egg, and a big mound of fresh green onions and sprouts to balance everything out. Extra condiments like pickled ginger, pureed garlic, and chili powder (http://en.wikipedia.org/…) allow you to tweak the taste to your liking. Wow, my mouth has literally been salivating for the last paragraph... I gotta go get me some right now. Peace.

The gold standard of Ramen. Come almost hungry. The wait is terribly long, but ultimately worth it. The slow simmered velvety pork broth packs warming flavor as you slurp the al dente egg noodles coated with pork fat and fresh seasoning. A small menu that is easily conquered in a single visit, but become more like submission as you enjoy every last slurp of broth. Med-hard Boiled Marinated Egg - envelopes the soy sauce and smooth med. yolk. Egg whites never had so much flavor. Chasu Pork - could use a little more fat and flavor, but still is good as it compliments, with out taking your attention away from the broth. Fresh Green Onion, Bean Sprouts - a layer of fresh flavor in a deeply savory dish, bamboo shoots taste clean with out a aluminum can after taste. Gyoza - wrapped more like meat and scallion enchiladas here and fried to a crispy caramelized crust, that stays crispy and sticks to your teeth like a sugar daddy. No need for soy sauce, there's enough flavor. I'd give 5 stars... but i had better broth and noodles separately. This is the only place that has good standard for both. it's definitely a destination.

My trip to LA this weekend could not have been any more wonderful, but what really made the trip was the ramen from Daikokuya.  It's been talked about and my LA friends have raved it, but this weekend must've been good luck for me because I actually got a chance to try it! My friend and I arrived after she picked me up from the airport at Burbank right about when it opened, around noon.  There were already lines out the door and the wait was going to be an hour, at least.  We still waited.   Once we got in, we were seated at a booth, apparently, that is pretty rare for two people considering the lines.  The atmosphere ringed nothing but tradition as the orders were yelled to the cooking line behind an open kitchen counter.   We started with their traditional gyoza, soft at the dumpling heart but surrounded by a flaky and crispy edge.  Next up, their Daikokuya ramen with the Kotteri flavor, had to get the extra fattening soup base.  The ramen was made to perfect and the soup was absolutely flavorful.  I wasn't too happy with the tempura bowl but I already knew that it wasn't their exact specialty.   I like the place and would want to come back again, but I just don't know whether I could wait for another hour next time...maybe other locations are just as good and shorter wait time?  One can only hope...

On my quest to explore Little Tokyo in one afternoon, I narrowed my dining choices to this Ramen house. Plenty of good Yelp reviews, a line out the door, cash only, I knew I found the spot. Got in pretty quick and got a seat at the bar being it was only me. I opened the menu to find only one kind of Ramen to order, figured a Ramen house with only one kind of Ramen, they have all their eggs in one basket. Well I was not disappointed. Perfectly cooked noodles, the dashi was to die for, I broke my egg just in time to get a little bit of runny yolk bites with my noodles. I have found my go to when it comes to Ramen in SoCal. Found that this place is open until midnight, I tried to get hungry again just so I could go back but my bowl of Ramen had me full for the evening. It was also nice to sit at the bar by myself enjoying my Ramen while everyone around me was speaking Japanese, that is something I have yet to find in Sacramento. Daikokuya you bet I will be dreaming of you. That's my story..

My friend and I arrived at Daikokuya at 3pm and waited for a little over an hour to try some very good ramen. We both got the combos, one with shredded pork and the other with tuna sashimi. Shredded pork won, hands down, it was delicious! The wait is a little ridiculous considering that 3pm is usually the awkward hour between lunch and dinner, but the ending was worth it. We noticed that at around 4pm, the place started to have more free seats.

Had the specialty ramen with extra pork fat flavor. It was quite.delicious; however, we had to wait about 40 minutes to be seated. I wouldn't wait that long for this ramen; however, yelp reviews convinced me that I had to try it. Ramen had good pork flavor, an egg, bamboo shoots and meat. Not bad..but I wouldn't call home about it.

I was lucky enough to get in there on an off hour.  I ordered a ramen with the extra EXTRA fatty broth.... Killed it. I plan on killing alot more of that stuff in the future wenever I can :9 Daikokuya is the kind of epic ramen Homer wrote epic poems about.

love this place for ramen - am a bigger fan of their cold noodles than hot.  Noodle texture is perfect.  Two details to be aware of: it doesn't have AC and there will be a wait during high traffic hours.

Okay, here's the deal. When the family wants to go on vacation and the family doesn't want to help research or plan where we're going to go, what we're going to do or what we're going to eat, then the family can darned well do what i want to do! Are we clear on that? We were on a five day feedfest that began on Friday night and ended on Wednesday night. I tried to vary the type of food so no one would get bored. and Tuesday night happened to be ramen night. Now my sister had suggested another restaurant because they served more than just ramen BUT she wasn't on this vacation, so her vote didn't count. Arriving in Jtown around 7pm, we parked and headed straight to our destination. There are a ton of restaurants in the area and most of them were open but only one place had a line out the door. Yes, it was Daikokuya! Of course, the fact that they only have six booths and about 15 counter seats may be a partial explanation but people were still waiting. And no other restaurant looked even 1/2 full. Cut to the chase. It took 1.5 hours to get our table. It took all of 45 minutes to get our food and destroy it. And it was onolicious! Here's what we got and how we scored it on a 1- 5 scale: (5) gyoza - 2 orders; never seen them presented the way that they were, looked more like egg roll shape than gyoza shape but darned yummy. (5) tempura - 2 orders; hot, crispy, not overbreaded, 3 prawns and losta veggies per order (3) california rolls - 2 orders; meh, they were okay but pretty run-of-the-mill. (5) Daikokuya Ramen - 4 orders; big bowls, lotsa ramen, just the right amount of fat pork, whole eggs that were't over boiled to the point that the yolk turns green (5) Fried Rice - 3 orders (as combo with ramen) yeah, okay, so we like to eat... (1) Chicken Teriyaki Don (as combo with ramen) so sad, so bad. The teriyaki was more of a glaze than a sauce it was so thick. While the chicken was okay, we would have been better off with another order of fried rice. We finished everything but maybe two orders of the fried rice which we took in a to go container.

One word: WOW. I've been here twice. Once on my 21st birthday and the second time about a year later. I've been to a lot of ramen places everywhere -- including those in Tokyo and I can say that Daikokuya ranks amongst one of my all-time favorites. I really don't think there's anything in North America that can compare to how awesome this place is. If I lived in SoCal, I'd be here all the time. Just be aware that this location is sort of a hole-in-the-wall and if you're going with a large party be prepared to be seated at multiple tables.

Yes, the wait can be intense. Is it worth it? Under an hour, yes. Over an hour, no. Nothing is worth more than an hour wait to me though. I have only tried the ramen and it is really good. The broth is amazing, the pork is tender, and the pickled egg is perfect. Daikokuya is definitely a must try for ramen in downtown.

Lured by my friend's promise that this ramen was better than Japan (how does he know?), I looked forward to a place that would serve nice thick shio broth with some chewy noodles. It did not disappoint, however, it was not as good as Japan. The broth was creamy and good, but not excellent. Good shio broth should exhibit an unforgettable aroma that lingers in your mouth hours afterwards. The noodles were pretty standard too, and so was the meat and the other toppings. In fact, the noodles were just not that special. It was mid of the line, standard, shio ramen; which is not a bad thing, but definitely cannot earn a 4/5 star. I think this place deserves a three star for being a good place, but I don't think it is worth a wait longer than 20 min. Overall, a "good-but-not-great", "grade-B" place.

I really wanted to like this place. I heard so many great things about it from all my friends so I went. We waited 1 hour and 15 minutes to be seated and boy we were hungry. I was surprised at the small amount of ramen selection they had. The only choice we got was whether we wanted the kotteri or not. I should have tried it without the kotteri. It's basically fat from a pig's back and it was disgusting. When the bowl came out I could see the fat floating in my ramen but I still ate it. Afterwards, my stomach did not feel good and I was insanely thirsty from all the sodium. Would I go again? Probably not. Do I regret going? No. It was an experience I can check off of my list. I think if I ever crave ramen again I will go elsewhere. I've also realized I'm more of a pho/tom-yum person anyway.

Ehh Daikokuya is just okay for me. Not sure why I'm not really into the hype, but I've definitely tried to like it. I came here with a group of friend and waited up to 1.5 hours to go inside. At that time, I thought we were crazy and I still think we were crazy. We waited outside with a mass amount of people and once we got in, we were starved. The place is small and can get kind of hot and noisy inside. I've tried a number of items from their menu including their popular ramen to their chicken terriyaki to some other dishes. I guess I'm just not really into the whole "fatty" taste. Everything tasted too oily and fatty in my opinion. Some people I've talked to have agreed with me. I just didn't like the feeling of biting into the meat and having to taste the oil and fat dripping into my mouth. Price is reasonable in my opinion. Parking is usually hard to find, especially on the weekends.

I absolutely love this place, but hate their long line. I live in San Francisco, every time I need to go to LA. This place is a must stop for me. The price is decent for Ramen. Their soup are to died for. I also love their combination meal, Ramen + A small rice bowl. There are many variation of rice bowls to chose from, my favorite is the Ikura don, but that's just me. Beware of their long line, last time I was there was Wednesday night at 10:20pm, single person, and I had to wait for 15-20 mins to sit at their counter.

Just under $10 per person!!!! A CHEAP filling foodgasm!!!! The ramen has a nice consistency always and I've been here many times!!!! It is similar to the Italian al dente feel on your teeth!!!! You get a huge bowl that I have only been able to finish a couple of times! The broth is to die for!!!! I have tried ramen at Honda-Ya, Shin Sen Gumi and Orochon and their broth does not compare to Daikokuya's at all. The chashu pork melts in your mouth and adds to the flavor really well. It's not too salty as at Shin Sen Gumi Little Tokyo or cold in the middle as at Orochon. There is a soy sauce dipped hard boiled egg which I first thought was weird but is now a welcome familiar sight. Just try to eat it with your chopsticks haha!!!! I find myself having to poke it with a chopstick most of the time! Everything else I have had here is really good too. I love this place and associate it with good times. This place was recommended to me by THE Naco who is a Michoacano Asiaphile friend of mine. I love you Naco!!!! The service is quick and exceptional. I love to hear the squeaky voice of the girl that calls out your party's name - over and over and over and over - haha!!!! Daikokuya is one of a kind. A real jewel. Regardless of all the haters and I've even read some Yelpers that say NYC ramen is better(?) Daikokuya manages to keep their stars at 4!!!! Why so many haters? Well, Daikokuya is a victim of their own fame. They are "unlucky" enough to be on the main street of possibly the second most important Little Tokyo/Japantown in the world (YES, only Sao Paolo has more Japanese outside of Japan than greater Los Angeles - well, greater Frisco may be close)! Some people ASSUME or want to think that this means they are a tourist trap and that they are not authentic! OMG! Whatever! They play Japanese rock pop often and have cool to look at decor inside. The only problem is the wait and parking. Expect a LONG wait most of the time you come. However, if you find out the best times of the day to come the wait is not bad at all. The wait is worth it though and you can find cheap parking by the Marukai.

seriously don't know what all the hype is about.  I'm reviewing the ramen only.  Didn't try the other stuff on the menu.  The soup base is rich, but I expected nothing less in Little Tokyo.  The noodles are nice and chewy, but again, similar to the other high profile ramen places like Shin Sen Gumi.  The only thing I don't like about the ramen here is how plain it is.  There's not a lot of stuff in it.  I would've liked more veggies.  But I guess 'real ramen' doesn't come with all those mumbo jumbo.  But at least give me the option to pay extra for stuff.  To each their own I guess.  The ramen is good, but not two-hour-wait good.

O so Oishi! Out of this world ramen. But be prepared to WAIT. Lines are incredible. Creamy meaty perfectly seasoned broth loaded with crunchy sprouts, ultra tender slices of meat, soft boiled egg quarters, chewy ramen noodles, then last but not least a confetti of green onions. At lunch hour, you can pair it with a 2nd menu choice too. Eel bowl. Trust me.

One of the best ramen experiences ever. The first word(s) that come to mind to describe the Daikoku ramen is well-balanced. Everything in the bowl revolves around the pork-derived creamy tasty broth. The noodles are perfectly al dente, chewy but not overly chewy. The pork melts in your mouth and the egg is boiled exactly right without the yolk being overcooked nor undercooked. I've never had beansprouts in my ramen before but it's an excellent additional crunch to the bowl of deliciousness. Thank you Athena T for making sure I stop in here. It was terrific, and without a wait at lunch, it made my experience here just that much better.

I've gotta give this place another try.   The broth was not "thick" enough for my liking.  The ramen was al dente --- but I kept waiting for the WOW factor that my brother and cousin keep harping about.   Tis a pity I wasn't sold on this place.  It IS rather EXPENSIVE for ramen.  'Twas tastier?  I'd change m'tune.

i like this place a lot... I like the amount of food, and the price of hte combos.  Plus when you walk in they have a TV playing some mexican tv dramas or commercials! Just get the ramen combo with chicken/egg bowl and get some gyoza with that on the side and you'll be good.  The tuna bowl is also a good addition to the ramen, its lighter.  It is a lot of food but you will walk out feeling satisifed!

I didn't eat much but tasted enough for a review. The broth and meat in the ramen was really really yummy. The noodles...kinda chewy...almost as if they're undercooked but not because it's good. All in all...very tastey. Atmosphere-wise...very cute, quaint old fashion looking ramen house. The line to get in is pretty crazy. Don't cut it too close to closing because they're super strict not to let any one in.

here i was thinking that Daikokuya at lunch on monday noon won't be too crowded or slow even, oh soo WRONG! Got there at 12-ish, gotta wait about 40mins for a seat, i went by myself so I can pig out without worries, believe me, 250lbs + moderately hot room + ramen + a billion ppl waiting = not a pretty sight for dates and friends alike.  Todays visit is a first time I go for lunch, before its always dinner time visit. Got my usual ramen + pork cutlet bowl order in, the small salad come out promptly, if anyone know what the dressing is holler please, ramen come out promptly, too bad that they skimped on my egg and i could've sworn I'm missing a piece of chashu but then again I might've swallowed 2 slices in one go and also my katsudon took forever and a half. Me thinketh it went to the person next to me by mistake judging by her quizzical look. Anyway, no biggie, I got it in the end so it turns out to be a lucky mistake bcos it was still tongue-scalding hot when i got it. Yumm...  4 stars for an almost perfect yummy daikokuya experience.

*UPDATE - apparently ownership has changed and quality control is not quite what it used to be.  Many complain of the soup is too salty.  Moreover, the restaurant has a "C" rating, which is cleverly hidden ABOVE the door, masked by some dangling cloth.  Nevertheless, I still enjoy the place.  I've updated my rating to reflect these changes. Another one of my favorites.   This is my regular comfort food spot for a bowl of amazing Ramen. I recommend going for a combo meal with a bowl of Ramen and a rice bowl.  It's more than enough for the heartiest eaters, but warning to those on a low-carb diet. Also be aware that this is arguably the most popular Ramen spot in J-town so be prepared to wait.  I showed up at 11pm on a wed night, and I still had to wait an hour to sit at the bar to feed my Ramen craving.   Nevertheless, highly recommended!

OMG! Their house ramen is the best I've ever had, so far. The pork was so tender it just melts. I'm just in love with their white soup base (pork bone?). I've never tried anything like it. Most  ramen places would just have miso or soy flavor, but Daikokuya, I'm just blown away. The whole egg was so flavorful along with the bamboo and scallions! My hubby ordered the house ramen combo with fried rice. The fried rice was pretty yummy. Our side order of their sauages was really good. Just be careful when first bitting into it, the juices are hot and I think you could hear the skin crack when you bite into it. I thought we could beat the crowd by coming in on a rainy day at 2:30, but I guess not. We had to wait for about 30mins, but it was totally worth the wait.

Seating is limited and it takes forever during lunch/dinner time, but it's all worth it as soon as the first dish comes out. The Ramen is life changing. The gyoza is hand made and really the best gyoza in little tok's. This place is my #1 ramen spot.

Dude, been coming here for over 7 years and its always good. It was better back then when they weren't so busy though. Only bad things? 1.) they keep weird hours cause they close whenever they run our of soup base 2.) they don't do take-out orders when they're busy Other than that, I love them and will keep supporting them. On another note, since they got so damn crowded, i started going to their sister restaurant Ebisu  (one block over on 2nd) since its closer to me and while they don't serve hakata, they're still good and they still serve my favorite, free cabbage salad with the yummy, creamy dressing.

That was really good for a hot day and it tasted soo healthy and veggie? Anyway, I can't ever finish the combos here. You can order a side sushi, sashimi with rice, rice with fish eggs, and other stuff along with your ramen.

I made a terrible mistake.  Who decides to eat ramen when it's 95 degrees out?  I do of course! We walked into Daikokuya to discover that they don't have AC.  Well, I guess technically there is an AC, but it was creating the most pathetic little stream of cold air.  I was sitting right under it at the bar and didn't notice it until my friend pointed it out. The ramen was good, but not fantastic.  The broth is very tasty, but the noodles were a bit hard.  Not sure if they are always like that, or if we just got an off batch.   On a positive note, the service was fast and friendly.  Will try again on a cooler day.

I'm not really a fan of food or eating in general. So if I say something is really awesome and I actually like to *eat* it, then you know it's worth something checking out. For some reason, Daikokuya did not pass the LA Health Inspection test which is why there is a sign with the letter "C" to indicate such. Please note also that underneath that sign is a long-ass line, indicating a wait time of 30 minutes. Health Inspection be damned! Failure to pass just means a test to our immune systems! Wow, so now you know that if I am giving a 5 star place to a FOOD venue in spite of failure to meet all Health Inspection requirements, you know it has to be good. Basically, what makes this place awesome is the signature ramen dish, which comes with tender pork, crack-infused broth (I mean, why else am I drinking it after the noodles are done?), and chewy, perhaps crack-infused noodles (I mean, why else am I raving about this place?) Sorry, vegetarians. This is a taste nirvana you're not going to know about. But for the rest of you...if only there was a way to get to LA from SF faster....

2.5 stars This place serves up Tonkotsu Ramen which is the white, milky and pork based soup. It is average. The fried rice dish everyone is talking about was also average. I cannot believe nobody mentioned Shin-Sen-Gumi Ramen which is a much better version of the Tonkotsu Ramen. Is everyone taste deaf? Shin-Sen-Gumi's ramen is much more flavorful and the noodles are not as soft as this place. Also SSG has better fried rice and at night they have a entire Japanese Tapas dishes. The only think I liked at this place is the cut of pork they serve inside the ramen is the pork belly so it melts in your mouth. Well at least this place is a better option than Mr. Ramen.

The best ramen I've ever had.  Perfect broth.  Not too thick or thin and a taste to die for.   I've been to many Ramen places all over California and Hawaii and Daikokuya's Ramen was just plain overwhelming compared to the others.

Unique and Authentic.  Those are the only two words that I woke up this morning saying about my dinner last night at Daikokuya.  I have eaten at a lot of Ramen places in my time but none of them as original as this place.  Also I did not have to wait that long to get a seat at the bar.  The table were booked and the line in front of me was pretty long.  Bar is first come first serve! First off there is only one choice on the menu.  "I will have two bowls of the Ramen please".  I sat at the bar and watched as the cooks prepared other exciting Japanese dishes.  The broth for the ramen was boiling right in front of me.  It was a watered down milky color, not what I was expecting and not what I was used to.  I did read how the broth was made and I was happy to see that they take so much time and effort into making their signature dish.   I like spicy and the only way to spice this dish up was adding the Japanese pepper flakes.  I was very impressed from first sip and slightly disappointed to find only a few pieces of pork in my soup.   I enjoyed the gyoza and an Asahi prior to my soup.   Everything was perfect and would tell the oldest Japanese person in America to test this place out and reminisce about the old days in Japan while eating the most authentic and original Ramen LA has to offer.   Bobby Cockrill

I literally have dreams about Daikokuya. The ramen to be more precise. It is absurdly good. Excellent broth, noodles..everything. The eggs are cold so give em a little prodding with the chopsticks and you're fine. Great service. Be mindful of sitting at the bar only for the fact that you may get overwhelmed by the heat and scorching hot grease flying at you. Other than that, believe me, you will get hooked on this place.

I just got back from having lunch there.  Like nearly everyone else has mentioned, if you go at lunchtime, there will be (and WAS) a long line out of the door. To start, let me say that I love noodles... all noodles.... Chinese... Japanese... Thai... Vietnamese.  They are (and always will be) my comfort food... however, I'm not a big noodles snob.  That being said, I wasn't too overly impressed with the Daikokuya. First, was the wait... but I guess that's pretty standard with some places Downtown.   Second, was the service... I asked the waitress to bring me a water... and she didn't return with it until nearly the end of my meal.  My noodles did come quickly, though Third, was the selection.  Call me a picky girl, but I love options with my noodles.  At Daikokuya, there is one bowl of ramen (at least that I saw in the menu).  At Kouraku, there are pages of noodle choices. However, ignoring all of these, the bowl of noodles themselves were ok... better than many places, nice... chewy... with a flavorful broth and a yummy egg.  However, it didn't make me want to close my eyes and silently savor each bite. I don't regret going to Daikokuya... it was good... but I'll probably go to Kouraku next time I start craving noodles.

I usually dread comming here because the wait for a table/bar is usually extremely loooooong.  By the time I get a table, order, and the food arrives, I'm too hungry to enjoy the food.  Seriously, I put my name on the waiting list and 10 minutes later, there were already 8 other names after mine.  Sheesh. I can't say that I'm blown away by their famous ramen, probably because I have to wait so long for it.  It is good though .... the broth is savory and full of flavor and the texture of the ramen is nice and firm.  I'd stay away from the Kotteri version next time.  If you order the Kotteri version, they add some pork fat based broth to your bowl of Ramen.  Although some people would probably like this version because it makes the broth thicker and more flavorful, I can't stop thinking about the pork fat clogging my arteries especially when I see the fat floating in my bowl of ramen as I'm eating. I'd come here more often if the waits weren't so crazy.

Yeah...knocked off a star because of the reallly long wait. (I'd say a little over an 1hr) The ramen portions are pretty large...bigger than other ramen houses I've been to.  They have a ramen combo with your choice of small rice bowl for about $12.  I got the shredded pork rice bowl which is pretty good.  I really wanted to get the fried rice people have been mentioning in other reviews but I guess the rice was still too fresh to make it.  This was way too much food for me (but maybe because i stuffed my face with mochi and beard papa's cream puffs before). Overall...even though the wait is pretty long, the food comes out really fast and they have good service. I really liked the authentic Japanese atmosphere too.

Freakin' delicious ramen. I've been to a place in san jose and another one in los angeles and this one sure takes the cake. Their broth is great. I tend to order the kotteri version to get the richer flavor with the back fat, haha. Sounds unappealing, but it's more flavorful! Throw in some garlic and chili powder and you're set! The bamboo is good. The egg is great. Wish they gave another piece or two of the meat, but it's still great nonetheless. I always order the combo with the unagi (eel) and rice for me to take home to have a meal later on. I've never ordered it itself at the restaurant because I always want the ramen, so I'm sure it isn't quite as delicious, but it's still yummy. I tend to get seated at the bar so I get to see all the guys do their thing like clockwork. The only downside of the restaurant is of course the seating...it gets packed on the weekends (sometimes nights) but it's worth it!

We beat the line by like 5 minutes .. phew!!! The ramen is good and I like how they only have 2 kind so that makes thing much easier.  It's freaking big as well (may be I'm just small person) so share it with someone. Service is excellent and very attentive.   I would go back again when I crave some hot, satisfying ramen!

Honestly I think Daikokuya Is overrated... I heard wonderful things about the soup and it got great reviews on yelp; however, sadly to say I was disappointed. Their ramen is whatevers, soup was too salty (this is coming from a salty eater) and they give too much noodle in comparison with their soup. I even like their side salad better than their ramen. I also tried their beef bowl which is just not even worth it. I have no other words to describe my disappointment. Especially since I waited 45 mins. I recommend Foo Foo Tei in Hacienda Heights, which also has just as bad of a wait time but is much better in taste.

I think this place is over-rated.  Comparing to Santa Ramen in Burlingame, CA, people got to wake up to taste what is genuine Ramen.  This place lacks quality of fresh egg noodle and the soup base lacks taste.  I think that's the reason why they serve huge portion for their customers.   I was disappointed to find home cook Ramen, one boil egg, a couple slices of pork, and over powering chives when I came to this place.  The line was ridiculously long and the restaurant setting was uncomfortable. I had their ice green tea and I should of ordered their raspberry ice tea instead.   Comparing this restaurant's noodle to the Ramen places in San Francisco and the Bay Area, I give it a one star.  You will know the difference once you make a trip to the Bay Area and try out the Ramen places in Japantown and Santa Ramen in Burlingame, CA.

Forgot just LA, this place is the best Ramen place in LA or NYC!!  Sorry if my excitement frightened you.  Anyway, no offense to NYC Noodle houses,  but if Momofoku is considered one of the best, then they ain't worth a Momofoku!  Nothing compares with Daikokuya for quality and price. Anyway, I've been coming here for a long time, but never got chance to Yelp, mostly because I thought it was a forgone conclusion this place should be considered a state landmark for good eating.  Watch out, the line can get packed, but even if you get a seat on the little bench in front, a.k.a. the "waiting room", you might get a view of a fuzzy tv showing asian talk shows, or even better, reruns of Tyra Banks. The line still moves pretty efficiently considering, and there are spots at the bar.  Also your entire party has to be there to be seated, so don't eat with any laggers!   You can't go wrong with the Daikokuya Ramen, a heavenly eight bucks worth.  The combo is terrific if you're feeling up to it, but you're pretty much going to bust your belt at that point.  For three to four dollars more, you can have a Japanese salad along with a choice of a bowl of rice topped with teriyaki, beef, etc., or my personal favorite, the eel. To die for. It's a huge slab too, and if necessary, pack it to go and eat it later.  It's worth it, as long as it's not too much later, than you'll just be sick. And for the piece de resistance, there's decent priced beer.  Your choice of Asahi and Sapporo, among other drinks.  I wouldn't know, that was good enough for me.  They offer a 12 oz bottle and a 20 oz bottle, but if math's not your thing, I'll help you out: it's roughly the same price per ounce either way, so if you're looking to save money with the big bottle, not gonna happen.

I've been here on multiple occasions, the broth is definitely the star in the ramen, it is also pretty consistent whenever you come. It is easier to come alone or as a pair since wait for a table is mostly for groups of three or more. Bowl of ramen is more than enough for a healthy appetite, I usually get the Kotteri, or more intense broth, from the looks of it they don't filter it like they would a normal order and likely scoop it from deeper in the broth pot. The ramen is pre-package but the refrigerated not frozen variety. Pork has on one occasion been a little tough but is usually super tender and tasty. Soy egg is also great. If you decide to go with a combo you will be very stuffed.  Tonkatsu combo is good but not the best, it is difficult to judge since I usually go for the ramen first causing the fried cutlet to sit and lose it maximum flavor potential... Deep friend spicy tuna is also a good choice as an appetizer to share with someone else. Have not tried fried rice but it looks pretty tasty and popular order after the ramen.  It is a cramped space that gets super crowded at lunch but full of kitschy posters and artifacts to distract you while you wait.

This was amazing! I had their signature dish, the Daikokuya Ramen, and for the money it was by far one of the best Asian dishes I've ever had! Full of flavor, plentiful, low price, and well worth the wait! However I wished it hadn't taken an hour to get in, I was pleasantly surprised fortunately. Give this place a try, get their ramen, garnish properly with the red pepper powder, and garlic, sit and enjoy!

parking and the wait can be deterring factors but let's set those two negatives aside and move on to the positive! I usually get the ramen and rice bowl combo which comes with a salad. The salad dressing is amazinggggg! I hate salads and raw veggies and creamy dressings but this one at Daikokuya is awesome! And then there's the pork rice bowl. Oh... the pork is well-marinated and slow-cooked. they give generous portions too. Words can't describe how good the pork over rice is. Maybe sexy comfort food?! I am not a fan of rubber-band like yellow noodles, but everytime i get the ramen, the noodles are cooked perfectly and the broth is flavorful enough. however, after trying Ippudo here in NYC and going back to Daikokuya, the ramen here definitely pales in comparison.

I was first introduced to this place by my cousin who is an avid fan. He eats at Daikokuya every chance he gets! Aside from the long wait the food is always good. Even though there's only one type of Ramen you can choose from it's still really satisfying especially with the extra fatty back that adds for a little bit more flavoring. I usually order the combination with some kind of small bowl. The eel teriyaki is probably the best in my book. I don't particularly care for the salad that comes with the combos, tastes kind of like coleslaw but a bit different because of the dressing. Service is great here, they're prompt and really nice. I'm also glad that they're open late too. Got to take a friend of mine here to try ramen for the first time during the Downtown Art Walk. Also came here another time for lunch and there was already a line before it opened. Yay Daikokuya! It's my regular ramen eatery whenever I'm around J-town.

umm i must have gone at a bad time or something because the broth, supposedly the best in LA, was nothing to write home about. Really, if you think the broth here is tasty/rich, go to santouka, then you'll know what tasty broth is. (santouka also rivals them in pork!!) now the pork was AMAZING. both the pork in the ramen and the bbq pork i ordered on the side was like friggin heaven! the started salad and soup were also good.. as were the fried rice and teriyaki rice dishes i order they also have KIRIN DRAFT!!!!!!!!!!! how much better can it get?? but yea, 5 stars for everything except the broth.. too much hype, not enough taste.. really for tasty broth, go to santouka

O.   M.   G. This place got in touch with my inner true Japanese.  Line out the door, Chefs are japanese, and the guests are mostly Asian, in Little Tokyo. They say that the goodness of the broth is measured by how much people leave in the bowl.  And in a huge bowl (and that's the regular size) we left maybe two sips because those two sips might have perforated my belly.  nomnomnom.   The al dente ish noodles are boiled in a soy-sauce based broth that adds some extra flavor.  and add that with some draft japanese beer (Kirin) and I am in Japanese heaven. And even if we're big eaters, we split the Daikoku ramen + tempura bowl combo.  With beer we left with a $15 bill.  Cheap, yummmmmmmy, authentic, quick, service is attentive/quick.

The ramen here is awesome, but if you're a vegetarian you should know that there is NOTHING vegetarian on the menu except I think a tempura appetizer.  You can ask for your ramen without pieces of meat in it, but it still comes in pork broth, so it's only okay if you're willing to make an exception. Anyway, the only reason it doesn't have four stars is because of the crazy long waits.  If I'm going to go, I make a point of going at off-hours, and even then we usually have to wait a little while.  The last time I tried to go, it was 2 PM on a Saturday and we ended up eating at a place down the block because there were like 15 or 20 people in line in front of us (and I don't think there are even 15 or 20 tables in the whole place).  So, yeah, it's so so good but only if you can get in quickly or are willing to wait outside for a realllllllllllllly long time. I haven't tried the new location in Monterey Park (?...maybe somewhere else.  I know it's east on the 10 kind of by Alhambra) but maybe since that isn't smack dab in the middle of Little Tokyo it has the same great noodles without the wait.

Yes! I love this place. They have a great cold ramen which is perfect in the summer. The noodles are so delicious and fresh with the right amount of salt. Note to vegetarians - the menu is very limited. In fact, the cold ramen is your only choice. Thankfully, it's a good one worth ordering! Be prepared for a very long wait. There's always a long line out the door and the average wait time is 45 minutes.

The line was insanely long!!!  The moment i went inside, I really felt like I was in a japanese ramen house.  The decor was very  ethnic (which i liked!) but the resturant was cramped and stuffy... The pork ramen was yummy! The noodles were a bit hard but I didn't mind.  THE SOUP IS GOOD!!! i ended up pouring some soup into my tuna rice bowl just to savor it a bit longer.. hee hee... Btw.. i think its a better deal to get pork ramen+tuna bowl combo then just tuna bowl. ;0)

Solely comparing this to other ramen joints, its a five star rating.  I've never been to Japan (go ahead and discredit me!), but I would like to believe its similar. The wait can be gruesome, so go early.  Don't be afraid to go out of your comfort zone when ordering, nothing here is that bizarre.  Most of the foods have subtle flavors.

Ever since my friend took me here my perspective on ramen has changed. I've been to a couple of ramen houses before and I've always thought "why pay upwards towards $10 when I can make ramen at home". The ramen here is DELICIOUS and the prices are very fair. I've read some of the other reviews saying that it's not the best in the LA area. I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area so I guess I wouldn't know for sure, but I can tell you that in the SF area none of the ramen places can touch Daikokuya. For me though, it is the best ramen I have had to this date. If anything, this place sets a standard for ramen for me now. I will now judge ramen based on how good it is compared to Daikokuya. I now make it a point to eat here at least once whenever I am in SoCal. I can't thank my friend enough for introducing this place to me. Other reviewers are right though, when you come in, sign your name with the number of people in your party on the list, and then expect a 30-45 min wait. I've always brought larger parties (6 people+ ) and we always end up splitting into two tables, the restaurant is small and isn't designed for huge parties. And if you're not a complete health fanatic, you MUST add the ketorri (spelling may be wrong but it's written in the menu) flavoring to your ramen. It's a flavoring made of pork fat from my understanding, but it makes the ramen THAT much better.

Good thing they keep the location of their broth factory a secret, because if I knew where it was...well I might want to sneak in there and gorge myself. Daikokuya really IS as amazing as everyone says it is, this coming from someone who tried it for the first time on a hot ass day, already sweating before I took that first bite of steaming, delicious soup. But everyone does have their individual tastes, so I'll explain why I love it so much... 1. I like by broth not to salty, maybe slightly on the sweet side.  Lots of places make their broth so salty they make my tongue shrivel up a little. =( The broth here is a perfect balance of rich, hearty, umami goodness!!! 2. I like my pork thick cut that melts in your mouth like BUTTAH.  The pork here is just about like that (but I have to add, it does come in second behind Sountouka in Mitsuwa.   Just thisclose behind though.) 3. I like my noodles regular.  Not to firm, not too soft.  Daikokuya rocks at making those regular noodles! 4. Oh that flavored, hard-boiled egg.  It is such an integral part of my ramen experience, and Daikokuya's is delicious beyond words.  I never knew a boiled egg could reach that level of deliciousness but here it does. Summary: Ramenya, eh. Asahi Ramen, eh.  Hakata Ramen in Gardena, ok.  Sountouka, good.  Daikokuya, HEAVEN.

Amazing Amazing Amazing. Seriously, Tonkotsu broth at its finest. The pork here is outstanding. Anything pork and you're good. The sashimi bowl, ehhhhhh don't waste your time. However, be prepared to wait during peak hours as this place is small. There is no air conditioning so it can be extremely muggy in there. You almost always have to pay for parking as well. If you don't like places with a 'B' rating then stay away. If you enjoy ramen there is no other place in LA that comes close, except perhaps Shin Sen Gumi's Hakata Ramen.

My brother insisted we eat here because of their special ramen, and was worried that the quantity of broth made for the day would be finished before we got there.  "They won't make more!" he warned us. Luckily they hadn't run out, so we got the ramen.  It was good, but I wasn't blown away.  What did blow me away was their fried rice, eaten with some of the shredded pickled ginger.  "Brok' da mouth!"-good as my Hawaiian bruddah used to say. Their portion sizes are good, they have several combinations, and there's lots to choose from if you don't want ramen.  It's not a huge place so I have seen big crowds in the evenings, especially on weekends, but we went for an early dinner on a Friday (and for lunch on a Saturday with my son, who liked their chicken teriyaki) and got seated right away, so plan accordingly.  If you are in J-town when Daikokuya is busy, go somewhere else.  There are lots of excellent options.  Kouraku, for one.

Seems like every review of Daikokuya starts off warning about the wait...and this is no different. There were two of us, so the wait was ONLY 30 minutes. Outside. In the rain. And the cold. They seated us at the end of the bar. This might've been the highlight of the meal, since we got to watch the two chefs work their butts off deep frying, grilling, noodling, and the rest. We both got the ramen; I got the kotteri though, because when have I ever passed up an opportunity at back fat (answer: never). Also split an order of the tsukemono (assorted pickles). The pickles were great to look at, but not really that interesting. There were purple and green ones, made from unidentifiable vegetables, that were sweet and sour, but nothing stellar. There were also bright yellow pickled radish, that had a bit of an off flavor, and we couldn't finish them. The ramen came in big steamy bowls, which was great for the cold day. Maybe they didn't hear my order the kotteri (or my gringo tastebuds aren't refined), but we couldn't taste the difference between the two broths. The bowl comes filled with noodles, bean sprouts, a huge pile of green onions, some sliced pork, and an egg. The egg was easily the highlight--sitting in the broth it soaks up a lot of the flavor, plus an opaque, just-barely-solid yolk. In the end, this wasn't really anything to write home about. If this soup had knocked me off my feet, maybe I'd feel differently about the 30 minute wait, but as it now, just a big steaming bowl of whatever.

A lot of people have recommended this place as the place for ramen but I've only been here a couple of times. The ramen here is pretty decent and the serving is huge. The set option is a good value if you are a big eater because you get a mini side bowl of choice. This place is always bustling with business but I don't think this place has enough seating for the number of customers that they get everyday. There are a bunch of booths that seat 4 comfortably as well as counter seats. The counter seats are a little awkward though, because the table space isn't very wide. While I do like the ramen here and the mini side "don's" are tasty too, but what turns me off about this place is that there is always, always, always a huge line. Sometimes when I'm ready for some dinner, I just don't want to wait that long for it. There is a default clipboard sitting right at the entrance for you to write your name down. Ramen's good, but not good enough for me to wait (what seems like an eternity) for it.

My dad likes this place, but to me it's only ok. The restaurant resides in little tokyo where finding parking can be a challenge and walking to the restaurant is not an american past time. The first time I came here, it was through word of mouth and discovered that there was a 1 and 1/2 hour wait on some nights. I went here with my dad the following day right before the clippers game and discovered thankfully that the people that come here were still at work, so we beat the line. The ramen  soup was flavorful at the start of your nom nom, but after it starts to cool down, other ramen places started to go through my mind.

I've been on quite the Japanese Ramen hunt around NY.  Having tried some bomb ramen places in the east coast, I was skeptical when my best friend told me Daikokuya was the best ever.  It's a really small place (has a bar and about 7 booths) but.... If you get to sit in a booth you won't feel cramped.  The interior is pretty beat up vintage, the seats had holes in them.  Like all good food, there's a wait.  We waited about 45 minutes.  If you're wondering where to park, there's street parking (7 minutes for 25 cents!) and a parking lot across the street ($6). Once getting seated, service was quick.  Water came immediately after seating and our waitress didn't wait to ask what we wanted.  Okay! I know there's only 2 kinds of ramen on the menu.... but being new, I wanted a bit of time to look.  I ordered the Daikokuya Ramen.   Piping hot, yummy broth, puuurrrfectly cooked noodles, mouth watering-ly AMAZING!  My best friend was not wrong about this place the ramen was good~  The finishing touch to the ramen was actually the boiled egg- it was absolute perfection.  Soft on the outside and the yolk was soft and not tough!  While eating this, really all diets go out the window.  The Ramen broth is made from fat, no wonder its good :)  It did get a bit salty for me in the middle but I had my continuously refilled water to balance it out.  The portion is pretty big, if I ordered the combo I would probably have to take it home. Best friend recommended getting the combo if you like taking the leftovers.  I hear there's a really good salad and the fried rice is amazing too!  Can't wait to go back and try it..... oh! almost forgot... it's cheap! 8 bucks per bowl of noodles!

I used to get real excited about getting ramen here. But it just hasn't been the same after eating at Ippudo in Tokyo. And the perennial crowd hovering outside Daikokyu is definitely a deterrent. BUT I've found a new reason to go again! Have you tried the chicken teriyaki? It comes as an appetizer or as a rice bowl. That chicken is grilled to crispy perfection, then covered in sweet delicious teriyaki sauce. The tagline on the menu says something like, "Forget the Colonel, this is how chicken is done in Little Tokyo". Oh hell yeah! I love that chicken :) And the ramen is still the best you'll find around the downtown LA area. If you know a better ramen place, I'd really like the hear about it!

I just got back from having dinner at this place. I waited almost an hour for a table but it was well worth it. Not sure if I'll do it again though mainly because of the wait. My friend and I ordered the sausage, tuna roll, two Daikokuya Ramen Comb (one with fried rice and the other with tuna over rice) and beer. The sausage is almost like any other place- nothing special. The tuna roll isn't bad for $4. The ramen itself was okay but the soup is delicious. Fried rice isn't bad either. I know I'm not making everything sound great but it's good. Make sure to get the tuna over rice as the side item- it's great and the tuna slices are huge. Ohhh they accept CC, parking sucks, servers are nice. =) Happy Eating!

Ramen seekers, this place is for real...One of the best in the So Cal - LA area. Yes, they have tons of reviews, mostly good, and some not so. But I tell you this, they lived up to the hype in my books. The only bad thing I can say about this place is.. the WAIT is horrible. Be prepared to wait at least 30 min - 1 hr. I had this place a few months ago. It is now a part of my reference to ramen taste and quality. I got the Daikoku ramen combo w/ chicken for $11. Their broth has the beef flavor and all, but it has some type of seafood base that I can't put my hands on. It is overall good. The choice of them not to give you the option of saltness, textual in noodles, and oiliness in broth plays a big factor in which place is the BEST RAMEN  place.. This place is 2nd in my eyes for BEST RAMEN in SOCAL 1. Shin Sen Gumi 2. Daikouya ... Orochon

The ultimate in comfort food.  Soup that will blow your pants off.  No, really.  I challenge ANYONE to find better soup in the city of Los Angeles. The bowl offerings (shredded pork - sofa king good) are noteworthy as well. The ONLY bummer about this spot is the wait - general 30 minutes minimum.  The restaurant space is tiny, as is the bar.  Who cares, though? After getting our grind on here, we go to the Mitsuru Cafe across the street for the BEST, fresh imagawayaki. Perfect eating. Good eating to you!

This place is just... amazing... The wait may be forever (and maybe it's the hunger that makes the food tastes a lot better) but you MUST ASK their pork fat soup... not just the regular but the Koteri!  Once I had it... I will never go back... I mean the meal is unhealthy as is, you might as well get the extra fat and make it AMAZING! There is little negative to say about this place other than... no parking and long lines if you go during usual rush hours. The combo side dishes are actually REALLY good... it's just that a bowl of ramen will always be more than enough to fill you... the only reason I could see getting the combo's is if you're on a date and you're sharing :)

Now i'd like to say, the food is OK here. Nothing really spectacular, and it's extremely crowded and stuffy (hot).  The main reason I dislike this place is because the service STINKS. Our group had 8 people, so first, they had to separate us into two groups (of 4). That wasn't the deal breaker. Next, they forced us to hurry up and order, or they'd KICK US OUT then and there. My brother got there about 15 mins late due to traffic on the 10/405. (You know how that is!)...and upon getting here "late," they told him that he wasn't allowed to order AT ALL. No If's/ands/or buts. Then the lady offended someone in my group by being rude to her and ignoring all of her requests (which includes refilling her tea). My family friend decided not to give her a decent tip, and as we walked out of the restaurant, the same obnoxious waitress came out and harrassed her w/out shame. She asked for a 20% tip. EXCUSE ME , WOMAN. 1. FIrst of all--you separate us. 2. Then you rush us to order and threaten to kick us out if we don't. 3. Then you don't let my brother order. 4. Then you treat our party with disrespect. 5. Then you run up from behind us when we're in front of the restaurant & demand a 20% tip when you don't deserve it. HECK NO! Oh and P.S. did I tell you that it normally takes from 30-60 mins to get seated?! It's only because it's a small place. HORRIBLE.

The ramen here is exactly what you are craving on a cold winters night. came here, ordered the gyoza.  they were great.  i've never had any shaped like this but they were delicious.  ordered the daikoku ramen, with kottori.  asked for some hot chili oil...WHEWWWW i have to say....the ramen here is GOOOOOOOD.  the added kick of the hot chili oil added so much flavor it was delicious.  to top this meal off we ordered a side of fried rice, that dish still keeps my mouth watering to this day.  its like bbq pork fried in butter, rice in butter, all in butter it was pretty damn amazing.  to note...parking here is a BIA!  park in a parking lot and pay, otherwise you'll get a ticket like us.  those meters only max out at about an hour, and with the wait and dining, we were here for at least 2+ hours.  i'm not sure when is the best time to visit, but the wait here is always crazy so be prepared and enjoy!

I was expecting a lot from this place after so many positive Yelp reviews but felt the ramen was just too salty. Maybe it was a bad batch? We can here noontime on a Saturday and had 6 people. Note: if you have more than 4 people, you will not be able to sit together as this place has a long bar and tables of 4 only. They were however very accommodating and offered to seat 4 of us at a table and 2 others at the bar. I came here to order what was famous, the Daikokuya ramen. If you guys have had ramen before, this is pretty much a pork broth ramen so the soup base is not clear but very creamy. I would compare this ramen to a tongkatsu ramen I've had at Foo Foo Tei in Hacienda Heights. The service was good, they got out order and was very attentive. Ramen: noodles were great, meat was very generous but the soup. It was just too salty! Everyone in my party agreed. Overall I would give the ramen 4/5. I've had better tasting ramen at Foo Foo Tei. This was really a hype for me but I'm guessing I expected too much. I will however come back again to see if I did get a bad batch. Will follow up with an additional review when the time comes.

Yum... So I was ready to wait a while to get a seat at this joint.  We came later in the evening (party of 2) and only had to wait 10-15 mins.  The place was hopping so the fact that they get the food out quick helps the turnover. We ordered the pork belly appetizer...YUM  It's been awhile since we were there so I don't want to try and describe it in detail 'cause I'm sure I won't get it right, but it was crispy and tender and had a great sauce to complement. We each got Ramen combos.. one pork and one chicken katsu.   It was all as good as any I've had and served quick and hot. The Ramen was delicious and the broth was seasoned well..not too salty.

My roommate and I decided to venture out to Little tokyo one night! Enough with posh west Hollywood guest list bull we said, We going to Tokio tonight. Since we do not know much about little tokyo we eneded up in random bars.. salons.. etc  then we saw this ramen shop. It was packed at 1 in the morning.  so we had to try. food - I prefer my santoka ramen from mitsuwa.. sorry  I'm not japanese and i do not know what the real deal taste like. fried spicy tuna was utterly disappointing. ambiance - 5 star killer. i thought i was in japan.  good vibe. overall i enjoyed my time here.  but i won't driving from santa monica just for their ramen.    but if I happen to have a night out in little tokyo, I know where I'll be ended up in.

Wow. It's extremely tempting to skip the 45 minute wait and drop into one of many neighboring ramen restaurants where I'll probably be served food in 5 minutes, but I will endure the cold weather standing outside, dammit! The price is amazing: $8.50 for a bowl of ramen that will definitely fill you up. I have yet to see a girl completely finish their bowl here (if you wanna take up this challenge, drop me a line ;] ). The soup is really good, I read something on the menu about the pig parts being cooked the entire night before, I guess that's the trick. The pork is not the best: a bit fatty at times. You can't go wrong with the egg, and the onions are a great topping. If you like spicy, dump some of that chili pepper they have lying around the table, it goes great with the soup. No better place for ramen!

Awesome, AWESOME broth. I stopped by this place after a showing at the LA Asian Film Festival and found that it was SSSOOO good I might have to start thinking of this place as my ramen home instead of Shin-Shin (whose broth I also love). Sadly it's in Little Tokyo and so far from home.... I need to move.... The ingredients were about your standard fare for ramen (egg, pork, flavored bamboo, etc.). However their pork was REALLY fatty compared to the stuff I get at Shin-Shin and sadly no dried seaweed. So I guess that should ding Daikokuya a bit... but the broth just off-sets everything else! Try this ramen place if you get the chance, you won't regret it... just beware of the wait if you get there around dinner or late-night.

This did for ramen what Magnolia did for cupcakes... I didn't even know I was a fan of the stuff till I tried their version. Sublime. Generous portions, very reasonable prices. In addition to the classic ramen with backfat, we tried a few of the appetizers (sausages, deep-fried spicy tuna) that were delish, but not as earth-shattering as their specialty. We showed up 30mins before opening on a Sunday morning and were first in line. By the time we left there was a line at least 15deep that looked like a 45min wait easy.

3-Stars pending a second visit... Is it possible to have eaten at scores of shops all over Japan, dozens of restaurants up and down the coast of California, only to then be referred to Daikokuya and be thoroughly unimpressed?? Maybe it's my Academy Award syndrome where something gets over-hyped to the point where expectations just cannot be met?  Given the enormous amount of positive reviews, and the fact that I love ramen, I'll begrudgingly give this place another shot.   Read the reviews, you know the CONS: long wait even at 3pm on Friday, must find and pay for parking, shop is small along with the menu.  (Also, a weird middle-aged white lady kept taking photos of me and my gf as if she had never seen an asian couple before, even though she was in a ramen shop in a Japantown which happens to be in LA.  Dumb wench.). The shredded pork bowl was awesome, juicy, tender and fatty.  If you told me to come here for the pork bowl and ramen on the side, this place might get 4-stars.  Ramen broth was good, but not outstanding.  It lacked that kick where you put the first spoonful of broth only into  your mouth and let out that Coke, "ahhh."  The noodles were a little on the soft side (I like mine al dente).   I have a rule: a restaurant better be damn good to wait more than 30 minutes to just sit down, driving time included.  You ain't getting 5 stars if I had to drive 15 minutes to circle 5-10 minutes to look for parking to write my name down so that 30 minutes later I can sit down. Go down to the South Bay, Hakata Shinsengumi and Asa Ramen are top-notch in terms of ramen.  Santa Ramen, Tanpopo, and Katana-ya if you're up north.

I rarely give 5 stars to places, but Daikokuya deserves more like 10 stars.  This place is the Rolls Royce of ramen places (at least of the ones that I've been to).   I have been going to church near this place since October 2008 and each time that I would go with friends to eat here, it would take less time to read War and Peace or Tale of Two Cities than to get a table!  But this was the first time that I had eaten there!   I lucked out the other night.  After going to work out with a good friend of mine, we decided to overlook the hard work we had just put in, to get the MSG filled noodley goodness that is DKKY.  The wait, amazingly enough, was just about 20 mins.  But then again, it was 9:00 on a Monday night, as opposed to 9:00 on a Friday or Saturday night.  Here's the review: WHAT WE ORDERED: We just made the ordering simple for the waitress.  My friend and I both ordered their ramen with the shredded pork and rice bowl.  The portions were pretty good.  I was glad that the pork/rice bowl was on the smaller size cuz I have a couple of weddings to attend in August and I don't want to gain any extra lbs. between now and then. Another cool thing about the place is that there were fans right above where we were sitting, so as soon as I would pick up some noodles, the fans just blew the steam away.  SCORE!  The pork slices were decent sized as far as thickness and the noodles could have been a little less cooked, but good nonetheless. THE WAIT STAFF: My friend and I had the opportunity to sit at the bar, so we got to see the cooks in action.  It's amazing how they were just so efficient with the making of the dishes.  I guess that's what kaizen does in a process. The people where were pretty friendly.  They were always there to ask for water and other things if needed.  Overall, they were cool. VERDICT: If the wait was as short as the time my friend and I went, then yeah, I would definitely come back.  Going to the Monterey Park one isn't even the same, so I would either have to man up and go through the wait, or settle for 2nd/3rd/4th rate ramen elsewhere.

Came here with a few friends, after hearing them rave about this place. Checked on Yelp, and ppl here rave about this place too, so I guess i had some expectations coming here. Got there and had to wait almost 1 hour for a table of four. Good thing I wasnt super hungry else I would be really pissed. You would think that after waiting for 1 hour for Ramen, that the food better be the best dang Ramen ever right... well Daikokuya almost did it. It's right up there w/Asa and Sengengumi imo ... but just the wait made me have to ding it 1 star. Its just not worth the wait, there are just as good Ramen places in the South Bay w/o that insane wait.

This place has THE BEST ramen in LA, but the wait for it....ridic!!!!!! This place has like 5-6 tables (4 seats) and a bar that sites around 10 people. My sister and I went on a Wednesday afternoon and we waited 1HOUR!!!! Thank goodness there are shops around little Tokyo for us to wonder around. I highly recommend their gyoza...it's definitely my favorite by far! You should definitely not go to this place with big group or children....you'll be waiting forever, and the kid will whine the entire time.

Sorry, you can't get a good review for ramen from me if it's served to lukewarm.  The most basic of things, but that's just plain wrong. One star for the ramen, add an extra star for the yummy shredded pork on rice. This place is a hype machine - seems most people say it's good just because everyone else does.  Grow a pair and decide for yourself, instead of following the crowd.  Stand outside and wait for average ramen?  Genius!

If I could write a one word review, it would be: Yum. We came around 11 because we knew that there would be a huge line if we would've came an hour later. So we came and were seated immediately at the bar. We ordered our usual combos (ramen w/ fried rice) and got our food in less than 10 minutes. Not much else I can say. Daikokuya is at the top of my ramen pyramid. Period. Whenever I eat at any other ramen place, it never stands a chance. The day I find a ramen place better than Daikokuya is the day Chuck Norris will die...or the day the Sun will blow up. Quick Service, Consistent Taste, Daikokuya.

OMG OMG OMG OMG... !! I LOVE THIS PLACE. I could not be any more ecstatic about this restaurant. The noodles were good. The fried rice was good. The beer was cheap. 4 people each got a noodle dish, we shared another fried rice dish, and each got a large beer. The grand total? Around $40 including tax! They need to make this place bigger. Usually, ramen to me is just ramen. It's just noodles and soup. However, this place is so much more! I wish there was one closer to OC, but I would happily endure traffic for a taste of this place.

Yummy, I love anything ramen, and trying good ramen is always a favorite! So, when my sis recommend this place, we headed there for early dinner, and boy, were we glad we didn't get the dinner rush! Waited about 10 minutes(?) and placed the order quickly. Broth and the noodle consistency is always a crucial thing for me, and when I took my first slup of the broth, I was ready to eat! The broth is not oily like other ramen places, nor does it  have that nauseating porky/bean curd smell, but is very light in flavor and not too overpowering.  After adding some ginger and some hot spices, I dug into the ramen, and the noodles were perfect! They were not super soft, but had that chewy consistency, which was great. The slices of pork and the boiled egg were delish, and like many other yelpers, was overwhelmed with the HUGE portions they give you. I didn't want to let my delicious ramen go to waste, and although I was full halfway, I made the effort to finish my bowl. It was worth loosening my pants for the moment. :) Overall, for the price, the portions, and taste, it is worth the short wait. However, if I have to wait for over an hour or more, like many others have done, I will come back during their down time, whether that's at 11 a.m., when they open, or before 5:30 for dinner.

When we got here around 7'ish on Saturday, there were several people waiting outside.  We put our name down and walked around all the little shops in the area to kill some time.  By the time we got back, there were even more people outside.  Luckily, our name was called as soon as we got back. The restaurant is pretty small, and since it was only two of us, we were seated at the bar on some wobbly bar stools.  I felt like I was going to slide forward off the stool the whole time.  It's worth sitting on some funky stools though if the ramen lives up to the hype, and boy, did it! Get the combo w/ Daikoku ramen + fried rice.  I don't know whether it was the 5.5 hour drive down here or cuz I was hungry, but the ramen was reallly good.  The fried rice w/ pork (?) was delicious, not dry or anything.   I'm still trying to decide whether Daikokuya is better or Santouka.  Santouka definitely has more variety to choose from, however, I really liked the chewy texture of Daikokuya's ramen.  I'm torn.  Maybe if I ate them side by side, I'd be able to decide.

Went on a little ramen adventure while visiting LA. Went here based on the popularity. I got the regular house ramen. It was good. It didn't make me euphoric like a particular spot i frequent (Ippudo in NYC), but then again, probably nothing will ever compare to that place. Definitely worth going to for a nice bowl of ramen though.

Really top notch Ramen. This place is inexpensive and quick. I love how the waiters take orders on PDAs, it reminds me of the early 2000s when I had a palm pilot. I was delighted to taste some of the appetizers that were excellently done as well. The sausage with mustard was very tasty, the pickles with shiso pepper are a must, the gyoza are large, handmade and very tasty. I especially enjoyed the salad that came with my Daikoku ramen combo, really nicely done. Often salad at an izakaya or a ramen house has much too large slices of vegetables and is tough to eat with chopsticks. The salad had delicious dressing with nicely mandolined (if that isn't a word it should be) cabbage. In addition to my ramen I ordered the teriyaki eel bowl instead of my usual salmon roe. The eel was delightful, although I would have liked the skin slightly more crispy. The ramen.. Well I really hoped to try the famed Kotteri broth, but it was unavailable for some dream shattering reason so I will have to return. The ramen was excellent, but I didn't think it was earth shattering.. I think my expectations were so high I might of had a mental bias. The egg was a little cold, I would've preferred it slightly warmer. I will probably stick to Santouka for now because it is closer and pretty close to parity with little wait.

Good grub, though not earth shattering. Gyoza were strange, but good. Instead of pot sticker-like little pouches of chewy crispy goodness, it was more a sheet of dough and filling that had been perforated. Still yummy - just different. The ramen broth was yummy and I love the selection of accoutrements. The noodles are cooked perfectly and the broth was a little spicy, which I like. The place is kinda dumpy, and yes, the wait is long. That is prob the only reason for the four stars instead of five. Not to mention that according to me, $10 is not cheap for a bowl of soup. I'm looking for the kick-ass Pho in Little Saigon that is $3, now that's what's up.

Well, been wanting to try this place for a while as my friend been telling me this place is the "best" ramen place in LA LA Land. Every time I went to J town, the line is crazy, and for 3 + ppl, the wait can be close to an hour. Unless I can get a multiple orgasm after the first bite, I will not wait close to an hour for ramen. Finally I try it when I went to MOCA. Was there on my own, ask the waitress, how long the wait is, as there's a few groups outside waiting, she said 10mins. Bingo!!! A little over 5 mins, I got my spot by the bar. Ordered a noodle combo with tempura rice bowl. The noodle is only OK, I prefer Shinsengumi over it. The tempura is below average. I would properly knock myself on the head, after I ate, if I had to wait more than 20 mins for that. But I guess afterall taste is subjective. Will I go back? If that's the only restaurant open in J town at that hour and my car had ran out of gas and I'm about to starve to dead.............. Nuh, I'll hop in a cab across the street for the closest fast food place instead.

I'm still torn between the 3 or 4 stars, because Daikokuya came in at a dead 3.5 stars.  But since I'm nice and a teacher that rounds up, I went for the 4... Overall observations: -  There is a line/40 minute wait within minutes of opening -  It looks like a hole in the wall -  There are A LOT of other ramen joints within a minute walking radius Food observations: -  Our order arrived pretty quickly -  Salad was bordering on cole slaw -  The noodles were firm, just how I like them  :o) -  The broth was very flavorful, strong, and tasted great alone -  The few slices of pork were cooked well.  For me, it was a bit too fatty, but if you like that, it was delicious -  The bamboo shoots were AMAZING -  Quite a bit of bean sprouts and green onion -  The hard boiled egg's yolk was barely solidified -  There's not much else in the bowl (does that mean it's authentic?) Service observations: -  Only bar or 4 person booths available (we had 8 people so therefore 2 tables) -  Our main waitress was really nice -  One waitress tried to take a bowl of miso that my son wasn't finished with -  They charge 15% gratuity for parties of 5 or more -  Yet you are on separate tables anyways so how are they serving you differently or more if you are actually two separate tables?  Does that mean if we paid separately we wouldn't have had to pay the 15%? Personal opinion: -  The noodles and broth were excellent.  However, I still don't see all the hype...  O_o  Maybe my tastes are cheap, but I still like the spicy pork ramen from Ajisen that costs less and is closer to home.  I get more veggies and stuff in the bowl too...  I'm a cheap date?  LOL.

So here's the dish. I'm in downtown LA and in an area called Japantown where there is a line of small, authentic Japanese eateries. A friend recommended we go out for Ramen Noodles after a night out. Sure downtown LA was a bit of a drive from where we were but he assured me that Daikokuya would be worth the drive. We arrived around 10:30pm to a long line of people waiting outside to get in! Did I mention that this was on a Sunday night? The restaurant itself is tiny. There are small booths along one side of the wall and open-kitchen bar seating on the other side. Hanging on the walls are vintage WW II collectibles, posters and decor. Very cool! We waited a little over an hour but the food is terrific! Their ramen noodles is their pride & joy and for that, I could not consider ordering anything else. The food came out quickly. The broth was not overly salty or spicy. It was hot and very flavorful with bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, green onions, a slice of pork belly, a whole egg and of course, ramen noodles. And all for well under $10! Service was as expected. Quick and efficient. There isn't a whole lot of ramen places back home around the DC area. After my experience at Daikokuya, I kinda wish there were.

I love love love this place!! I'm not a fan of Japanese ramen because there's something about the broth that turns me away, but there's something about Daikokuya's ramen that I cannot resist.  I love everything from their crunchiness of the ramen noodle to the creaminess of their broth.   If you're not a pork fan, I wouldn't recommend their ramen as they have pork in their ramen and you don't have any other ramen options. The things I have tried are: Daikoku Ramen Shreded Pork Bowl Fried Spicy Tuna As mentioned, their ramen is simply irresistible and their pork bowl is really good too.  Their fried spicy tuna was a little different from what I expected but still good too.  They take spicy tuna, wrap it in shiso leaf and then fry it like tempura.  I'm a fan of shiso leaf so I really enjoyed it, but I don't know if my friend liked it as much as I did. The only downfall of this place is that you have to wait in line for a really long time.  Last time I went, I waited for an hour.  Normally I would never wait that long at a restaurant, but I just had to have their ramen that day.  Because of the wait, I only go when I absolutely have to have their ramen and I never regret it because their ramen is oh so good!

DEFINITELY THE BEST RAMEN IN LA! I love the broth, texture of the noodle, the half cooked egg, bamboo shoots, and chasu. It is also for a really good price! You can also decide to do a combo deal. Those dishes are delicious as well, but I can't finish both. The ramen is a big portion. GREAT DEAL! There is usually a wait, but it moves fast. Every time I visit LA I eat here! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

If you happen to stop by here on a crowded night, It's worth the wait. The staff does an awesome job providing speedy service and leaving your tummy satisfied. I'd recommend any of the Daikokuya Bowl Combinations.

What a wait for ramen! Waited for over an hour in the rain... =\ I got the combo of shredded pork bowl and the ramen. And nom the soup was divine! Loved it! The noodles were good but I would have preferred it to be a bit more chewy. Love how there were lots of meat and bean sprouts but more bamboo shoots would of been nice. The shredded pork bowl was alright, I think I would rather try another bowl next time. The service was fast and the waitress was pretty attentive to our tea cups being filled. Love the soup but I don't know if I would wait over an hour for it.

Best ramen ever? Nope. Best broth I ever tasted? Yes. So what makes this a 5 star place? EVERYTHING ABOUT IT! I heard the wait could get pretty bad here, but people are willing to spend an hour in line. The place is quite small, but very popular. My friend who is a LA native took us here and told us it was one of his favorite places. I knew I was going to have a very fulfilling and appetizing lunch. We started off with the fried spicy tuna and gyozas. So good. Everything about it. Come on, who every heard of fried spicy tuna? It was delicious. Note, they are green because they are wrapped in a leave when fried. The gyozas were pork filled and were yummy. Me and my friends ordered two combo ramens with fried rice and two bowls of ramen. So all of us ended up with a bowl of ramen and two plates of fried rice to share. It was absolutely the best meal I ever had. The ramen bowl was HUGE! GIGANTIC. I have never seen a ramen portion of huge before. The broth was perfect. So flavorful and delicious. There is also a garlic puree on the table if you want to add some garlic flavor to the both. Oh gosh, it was sooooo GOOD. The noodles were eh. It was the downfall of the dish, but I was able to look past it because of the broth. The egg in the ramen was perfection. The middle was gooey and yet still a bit cooked. The white of the egg was soft and so tasteful. I don't know how they do it. It was seriously the most perfect egg I ever had. Now for the fried rice. I really could have eaten the whole plate. It had everything in it. Chicken, pork, crab. It was seasoned to perfection. It was the BEST fried rice I ever had. And I'm Chinese. Seriously. The rice was so soft and not mushy, but the perfect texture. I don't know how to describe it, but it was truly magical. Thinking about it makes me want some so bad. All in all the check came out to be around 50 I believe? Not including tax and tip. Each bowl of ramen was 8.50 and you cannot argue that price. It is well worth what you get. The combos with the fried rice and ramen was 11.95 and the gyozas and fried spicy tuna were both 5.95 each. It was a great meal and if I could I would go back every time I'm in Cali. I will make the trip down the LA just for it! So good. Highly recommended! When you're in LA you HAVE to go here.

You will write your name on a list. And, then, you will wait. If there are more than 10 groups in front of your party, take a little walk or go grab a drink at the Far Bar....it's gonna be a while. Don't worry tho - it's worth it. But do NOT miss it when they call your name. There are no VIPs or regulars here...you get a seat when everyone else's name is called and when there's a table for your group. 8 people will sit in a booth meant for 4 just to get some of this ramen... It's that good. There's a line because it's awesome and cheap. End of story. Love the Japanese pickles. Always just get their house special ramen noodles. Amazing pork belly. Delicious, smokey broth. It's awesome, portions are huge, and it's less than $10. Simply very good. Just not if you're in a hurry or so hungry that you can't survive waiting an hour or more to be seated!

This place gets an almost 3 and a half stars from me =) Located in the heart of J-Town, Daikokuya was good. We waited for an hour and 15 minutes. The place was definitely a whole in a wall kind of place. The RAMEN was alright, but so not worth the wait, in my opinion. The bf and I ordered the Daikokuya Ramen Combination: 1) Ramen and Chicken Egg Rice 2) Ramen and Pork Cutlet Rice 3) Appetizer: Gyoza (very yummy) 4) Salad was complimentary (VERY GOOD)   The place is not ideal for big party groups. 2-4 people is fine =) The service was good and fast too.

In my opinion this place is legendary when it comes to ramen in LA. I have not had a better ramen place. Beware of the wait while parking at nearby packing structures and metered spaces. On occasion I have been known to wait more than an hour for this ramen. It is always packed every time I come here. Waiting more than an hour in the cold night air for a bowl of ramen, might sound silly, but trust me it is worth the wait. The broth is a concoction of pork bones mixed in with heavenly goodness to form the perfect soup base. The noodles are just the right amount of firmness and the half hard broiled egg goes great with the ramen and mouth watering chashu. I always add a little extra ginger to mine to give it a little more kick to go along with the bamboo and green onions already in the soup. A word to the wise..... They give you a lot of ramen for $8.50. I always get a side like fried rice, but end up regretting it after finishing the ramen. The portion size is huge. This place is totally worth it, a ramen place in little tokyo better live up to the hype and this one does and much more. If you are craving ramen in LA, this is the place to go.

I've only been here once, and I was a little hesitant after trying the one in Monterey Park and was totally disappointed, and also because for ramen I love going to Santouka in Torrance... but either way I wanted to see if there was a better ramen out there. I have to say the portion and price is excellent, you definitely get your money's worth. The noodles were good and the pork as well, but I did wish it had more pork for the amount of soup and noodles there was. When I first tasted the broth, I thought it was just okay.. but after I added a spoonful of garlic (which they have a nice jar of on each table) it was really good! ... but I still like Santouka better

I love this place! It is a gem in LA, and I am forever in debt to this magical place for exciting my taste buds, opening my eyes to the world of ramen. I was never a huge ramen eater before this, but once I tried Daikokuya, I can't go to any other ramen place. I'm obsessed. I even CRAVE daikokuya right now. The broth in the ramen is unique and unlike anything else I've tasted. It's rich but not too salty or over seasoned. The noodles are perfection, and the serving size is huge! I always end up taking to-go leftovers because there's so much they put in. The chasu pork is my favorite, and I always end up ordering an extra plate of it because it's a better quality and thicker cut of meat just for an additional 2$ or something like that. The daikokuya ramen is the classic, and any first timer or someone whose never had it needs to enlighten themselves with this dish. The other food there, other than its classic Daikokuya ramen is just as good! I've tried their japanese sausages (excellent), unagi over rice (perfection), and I'm sure everything else is worth the price. I usually try to get here when it opens or an hour before its about to close - the lines are usually to a minimum. I have waited from no wait to 2 hours for this place, so I can honestly say it depends on the day, the people, and your luck. I come here all the time, and I can say, the service and atmosphere only top off the experience with a super sized cherry.

visited this place on a very cold night, and having to wait almost an hour made it even worse. cold+hungry me = whiny b*tch. being weirdos that we usually are, we walked over to the liquor store couple spaces away to buy some scratchers to kill time, BAD IDEA. quickest 10 bucks ever spent lol. when they called our name, it was like HALLELUJAH . opted for the shredded pork bowl while BF ordered ramen. best choices we made all day, both dishes were so good , all that waiting in the wind didn't seem like a big deal anymore. not to mention, the portions they offer is HUGE if you're a girl you'll most likely take some home for tomorrow. i sat right next to the kitchen so i witnessed bowls after bowls of half full noodles getting sent in for togo boxes. TIP- shredded pork bowl comes with A LOT, and i mean A LOT of green onions so you might want to ask for less if you are on a date and don't want stinky breath because the other person won't like it too much when you lean in for some kisses afterwards.

Words cannot describe the party in my mouth that was Daikokuya. The hour-and-a-half-long wait was well worth it, though I recommend setting a timer on your phone if you had to park at a meter. We went around 3 p.m. on a Monday and it was still overflowing with patrons. I highly recommend getting the potstickers as an appetizer. They're crunchy on the outside and much different than any other potsticker I've had... but amazing nonetheless. The pork bowl w/onion and egg is so good it brings you to tears and the ramen - I just don't know how I could possibly explain it in words. The pork belly in the ramen melts in your mouth. The noodles are so fresh, it's like they just were just made seconds ago. And the broth... "boiled at a secret location," is extremely flavorful. This is by far the best ramen I have ever had. Ever. (Granted, I've never been to Japan). The only negative thing I can say is... be prepared to feel sloshy and full of liquid after your eat here. It's absolute gluttony. p.s. (Go in a smaller group or else you'll have to wait FOREVER).

expect a long wait (i usually wait 45 minutes to 1.5 hours) but my husband swears his food tastes better when there's a line so you can adopt his positive philosophy. also, dont come with more than a group of 5 otherwise it'd be very hard to seat you. the less people in your group, the shorter the wait! the ramen's broth is solid and for ~$9 for a huge bowl of ramen (i love adding some garlic into my ramen), it's so worth the price. if you get the combo ~$12, i highly recommend the shredded pork (watch out for the dried ginger if you dont like that!). the combo has soooo much food and i usually share it with someone if they're willing to share with me :p. my one complaint is the egg is cold and has really gone down in cooking/timing-quality. ive been spoiled by naruto's egg (in NYC) and i've never looked back since tasting their PERFECT egg and i expect that for all ramen places now :x

I've always seen this place packed with a long line outside and I don't like to wait so I never tried it. I got there at opening time, so there wasn't a line yet.

One of the best ramen I've ever had outside of Japan. The soup reminded me of the tonkotsu broth I had in Osaka. I ordered the Daikoku ramen with extra koterri which made the soup much more rich and porky flavored which I loved about the soup. It wasnt heavy at all, nice and light but rich with pork flavor. The char su was nice and tender melt in your mouth good. The only problem I had was the egg was a bit cold and probably was just thrown in from the fridge and that I didn't ask to have the noodle cooked al dente. Also ordered the pork goyza which was interesting because they rolled it up like a little egg roll instead of the traditional dumpling fold. It was paned fried crisp to perfection with the charred bottom and soft texture inside and I washed it down with an asahi super dry. Compared to Ippudo in NYC, I prefer Daikoku and the line was not too long either. I went with a party of 7 on a Tuesday night and only had to wait about 30-45 min, we had to be split up with 5 on the table and two at the bar. I took to bar seat to watch the chef do his magic, which was awesome. Oh and next time I'll be sure to order the extra large bowl because I didnt not know they had it until I saw my friends bowl when he got his.

I love Santouka (broth), Asa (egg), and Ajisen (cabbage, variety). But, Daikokuya takes the cake for best all around. The texture of the noodles is perfect, the Japanese fried rice is the best I've ever had, the teriyaki chicken is actually good, dark meat chicken with a fried skin and they have amazing kotteri style broth. The line is definitely a pain in the ass, but the service is quick and friendly and the food is always, always, ALWAYS worth it. My order is always ridiculously finicky (no pickled ginger here, salad without dressing, no green onions on this but yes on that, etc) yet they always get it right. If you fall into the wonderful unemployment crowd, no reason not to show up at 10:50am and wait for the doors to open. You can savor actually getting to sit at a booth and not having to jostle to write your name on the clipboard with a bunch of rameny hipsters. Make sure you ask for kotteri style broth and just put in a few extra miles on the elliptical the next day. And get the combo with either the chicken teri bowl or the fried rice. Bring a huge appetite. And don't you dare leave any food left in the bowl.

Oh man, where do I start with this place? Hands down, the BEST RAMEN EVER! Totally worth the hour wait. The broth is deep, rich and flavorful, the noodles are just the right consistency and the pork is lean and not too fatty. I love all the green onions that they add on there as well. The gyozas are really good too and another thing that must be ordered is their fried rice. You have not had fried rice until you order it at Daikokuya, wow is all that I can say. There are no words to describe it, you MUST order it in order to experience my speechlessness. This place is not overhyped, trust me, they make legit bombass ramen here.

My favorite ramen joint. You really can't go wrong with their specialty ramen; however, don't be scared of trying out their other dishes with a side of rice! be warned-- their bowls are pretty big, so its best if you go on an empty stomach. the only down part about this place is that it gets real packed during dinner hours. make sure to get your name on the list once you arrive. dont worry, you can always go for a walk around Little Tokyo while you wait.

I came here with my friend for dinner one night and it was a hell of a wait, but totally worth it. I got a combo that came with salad, chicken teriyaki with rice, and a huge bowl of daikoku ramen. Everything was delicious, but my favorite part was definitely the ramen. The rich broth, the generous helpings of pork, and the delicious noodles made it a perfect dish on a cold night. I think my favorite ramen is still Izakaya Masa in San Diego, but Daikokuya was damn good. This place is cash only, which is sort of annoying, but the prices are pretty cheap... so you won't need that much cash.

After a long day we arrived in Little Tokyo on an empty stomach only to find a 45-60 minute wait at this amazing little ramen house. The sport of watching people of all fashions made the wait fly by and before we new it we had a booth in the back with  warm sake in our hands. We started with the Gyoza and it was phenomenal! We followed that with the Ramen and it was truly the best either of us ever had. My date added the "back-fat" to hers; it made the soup much more rich and she loved it. I went original style and was happy without the extra richness. I Recomend

Daikokuya is the best ramen I've ever had.  I love a very rich broth, so I get it Kotteri style, and its just perfect.  The broth is not the soy sauce and water shoyu style, this is a rich broth that looks like they boiled the bones until the calcium started to dissolve into the broth.  So if you don't like rich, fatty broths then this probably isn't the place for you.  Their noodles are always perfect, real ramen style and not cheap chinese noodles.  The eggs are nicely marinated and still a little soft in the yolk, and the kurobota chashu pork, ohh my god, its amazing.  So yea, I love this place, just be prepared to wait 30mins to an hour or more during peak times.  I just go and put my name on the list, and go walk around little tokyo until the estimated time of my seating.

Little Tokyo in down town LA have sevreal ramen (Japanese style noodles), and Daikokuya is one of them.  Some people praise this place as really good, but I don't think it is not super good.  It is ok.  If you happen to be near by, then it might be a good choice to eat here. I didn't like the service at all, because my friend ordered a ramen, but they gave her Katsu-don (Pork cutlet with egg over rice).  However, it should be a good lunch spot if you work anywhere close and got bored with your ordinary lunch spot.

I came here to write this review.  Because this place is NOT THAT GOOD.  I remember hearing about this place from multiple sources.  Yelp, various web sites, and actually newspapers!   I work near this place so I had finally tried it a while ago with a coworker.  And both of us agreed: It was merely "ok".  I had another friend that tried this place and his response was "um, not bad?"   So later, when friends told me they REALLY wanted to try it I thought "well, maybe it was a fluke and maybe it really IS great".  I mean I do constantly see a decent number of people waiting for seats.  But I warned everyone that I had been there and thought it was strictly mediocre.   And guess what?  We all ordered the Daikokuya ramen except one person who had been there before who ordered the tempura bowl.  And yep, none of us were impressed what so ever.  Was it bad?  No.  Was it good?  Eh.  To make it worse, two of us had just come back from a trip to Japan too where we had some INSANELY great ramen that outclasses Daikokuya so badly it's embarrassing.   I'm here, not to diss the place, but to really temper it these reviews.  I don't know anyone in real life that has tried this place and thought it was great.  In fact everyone I know in real life that has tried this has judged it mediocre to "not bad."  (I know eight people that have tried this place).  Since eight out of eight people I know think it's mediocre, the shockingly high Yelp rating seems really out of place if you ask me.

My cousin and I were in the area for the weekend and she wanted to go to Little Tokyo to try this supposedly great ramen place.  We were there on a Monday at about 12:30 and the wait was about 15 minutes so not bad at all.  The place is on the small ish side but surprisingly comfortable inside, even sitting at the bar in front of boiling water on a hot summer day.  We both had the Daikokuya Ramen with the Kotteri Broth which is basically their broth with some added goodness of broth that has been boiled with the backfat of a pig.   The noodles were slighty chewy, you get a whole egg which is slightly undercooked on the inside, beansprouts, plenty of green onion, some pickled veggie that was delicious and we can't forget the pork that was sooo incredibly tender although I wish they gave more.  Needless to say, we hardly acknowledged eachother throughout the entire meal.  This is the best ramen I have had so far and subsequently has made all Ramen in San diego non-edible to me.  Good food, nice atmosphere and having a Yogurt land right around the corner makes it even better.

Looks like this place doesn't really need anymore reviews BUT it just wouldn't feel right if I didn't say a few words about Daikokuya because I've had so many memories here. My roommate introduced me to this place two years ago and we've been coming here regularly ever since cause were addicted to this shit and were raging fatasses. First off, the wait is painful and agonizing but ultimately, well worth it. The wait usually consists of us lurking around the front, staring down and cursing the bastards that eat too slow. When we finally get a table, we order pretty much all of the appetizers...deep fried spicy tuna, gyoza, sausage, roast pork, and gotta order a side of that bombass salad! Seriously, don't sleep on that salad. Then the gigantic bowl of sexy arrives and I drop about 2 lbs of garlic in it and at this point I usually black out. Make sure you order the "kotteri" seasoning or whatever it is in your ramen. I think "kotteri" is Japanese for "crack" cause thats the effect this ramen has on me...no homo. Also, you gotta love the big white dude waiter with the questionable Japanese accent who suffers from voice immodulation.

I have eaten at this place four times now and as a person that has been eating ramen since birth, Whenever I'm in the area and the tummy starts a rumblin, I can't help but stop by this place.  Parking is a bitch and there might be a line to get in, but I'm telling you---it's worth it! If you are a big ramen head, such as yours truly, I think you would appreciate the simplicity of the menu and the rich, flavorful goodness that comes in a soup bowl this side of town.  If you want something that would form beads of sweat on your forehead go for the classic Daikoku ramen, if you're ready to roll up your sleeves and work up a storm of sweat, get one of the Daikoku ramen combos.  The last time I was there I got the Daikoku ramen and oyakodon (Chicken & egg rice bowl) combo. And if you enjoy Shonen Jump with your meal, this is your new heaven my friend.  Hey, I'm no anime otaku, but I've been reading Jump since elementary school and it's nostalgic for me alright.  This place also can be vegetarian friendly for you veggies out there, just make sure you request it and make it clear. NOTE: they offer other items from their menu that doesn't contain meat such as yakisoba or fried rice, but the ramens contain pork broth :(  (thanks mamiko!).

L.A. traffic is horrible.  When I lived on the Westside, I always hated driving out of my area, so I had to find food places that would either deliver or would be walking distance from my place and my roommates felt the same way. Unless, of course, we were planning on having dinner at Daiko.  We would sit in Westside traffic for an hour and a half only to sign in and wait in line for another half hour.  Is it worth it?  Hell yes.  If you can't stand the wait, go and have a beer at Cosmos next door.

On a Saturday night, my boyfriend and I waited for an 1 hr, 20 minutes starting at 8:30PM. It was definitely NOT worth the wait....but since this place got the most ratings on Yelp by far - we decided to check it out. So when the ramen guy was loading up my noodles with a mountain of green onions, I started getting excited.  However was soon disappointed by the soup. It needed more salt or lacked some kind of interesting dimension... but was so thick and creamy, oozing with piggy essence. that my brain went dead afterwords. If you don't want to go into a coma, or waste time waiting, do not come here. You'd be happier going to Shin Shen Gumi or Santouka.

The broth is slow cooked the day before and all through the night. According to my boyfriend it's so delicious it tastes like "unicorn piss". The tender pieces of pork was enough to win me over. No doubt I'll be back to try the richer, kotteri flavored ramen. Parking sucks. Be prepared to bring quarters.

Awesome Ramen! Spicy Tuna Roll (appetizer), Daikokuya Ramen combo with small shredded pork bowl comes with an awesome salad (love the dressing), and an Ice Tea. Never Changes! Been going to Downtown LA's location. Friendly staff, but around dinner time theirs a long wait. Never stops me from going 3 times a week though. lol Awesome when its cold out..

4/25/09 - Tried it the first time last weekend. Found this place from reading reviews from Yelp. There are over 700 reviews so I figured it must be worth to try. I however agree with Len S. The place failed to impress. The ramen itself has a nice texture to it and the pork is good, but there is just very little pork in the bowl. The broth looks really good, but tasted bland. The side fried rice has a lot of pork in it, which was really good, but also bland. A bit disappointing after waiting for over 1 hour.  Another negative, the place is filthy and no air circulation inside. You do get a lot of food though for the price, so food value is a plus. The service is also very friendly. I say this place is better than Ramen Ya or Asahi but Santouka is more superior.

This place is completely overrated. I think many of the Yelpers rating this place must not have had ramen at many other places. I've also asked about four other Japanese people, who all agreed that this place was mediocre at best.

I went there for dinner tonight and it was just okay. I wouldn't say it was the best ramen I have ever tasted in my whole life. I really like the pork in the ramen but the soup base was too salty for me. Also, the noodle was also too chewy for my liking. Overall, I didn't think it was justifiable to be charged 8.50 for a bowl of "okay" noodle. In addition, they also charged us 15% gratuity although our party of 7 were split between the bar and the table that were even remotely closed to each other. I don't know if the gratuity is added for everyone or just because we were a part of 7. Either way, it just doesn't work for me.

The wait is usually pretty long but there's a great little bar down the street, tucked away in a little walkway (cannot remember the name of it). If there's a wait, I suggest you put your name in, go to the bar, grab a drink, play Rock-Paper-Scissors, and make the odd man out check on the list every fifteen minutes or so (I missed my reservation one time because of this). The inside is...boisterous, I guess? You have to walk through these little curtains in the doorway and once you step inside, you feel like you've gone to Japan in the 1960's. Little (REAL little) booths line up the walls while some crazy show is played on a busted-ass TV in the front. Why? I don't know but it looks cool. Old Japanese advertisements are on the wall and if you can, sit at the counter. There are a couple of big, steaming cauldrons behind there with dudes working, and sweating, their asses off. It's hot, it's loud, and it's great. First of all, the prices here, for the quality of food, is fantastic. I always get a cold, frosty mug of Kirin for, I think, $3 to start with. I've had the terriyaki chicken appetizer before, but you should just skip it and head straight to the soup. I get mine with the extra stuff put in (forgot the name). I've tried it with, and without, and it's better with. Also, I always get the smaller portion. I've had both and couldn't finish the larger one. Ask for it. The checkout is quick and convenient. This is a place you need to hit up at some point...

I wanted to try authentic japanese ramen and figured that a place in Little Tokyo would be as closes as I can get, short of traveling to Japan.  This place had high reviews from previous patrons, so, what the heck, right! In short, the ramen was good, the broth was very good.  You can tell by the consistency of the broth, that, if you chill it, it will gelatinize.  What does this mean?  Its quality. The only down side is that price and the quantity.  For $8.95 for the House Special, $9.33 after tax is a little more that what I'd like to pay for noodles.  If I had order a soda or any of the combos, it would be just under $15.00.  The quantity would be requivalent to a medium pho in Little Saigon, Westminster.   The only thing in the ramen besides the broth was a poached egg, a few slices of char-shui, a couple slivers of pickled bamboo shoots and fresh green onion over the top. I would return only if I had company that insisted on eating authentic japanese ramen, otherwise, I'd take them to eat pho, bon bo hue, or bon rue... (these are vietnamese noodles dishes).  For the same price, we'd probably get a large pho, a side of spring rolls and one of those unusual beverages.

This place is amazing, however be sure to not go there during peak hours or you could get stuck for an hour just waiting for a seat.   If it is your first time, you should really try the Ramen, it is the signature dish.  But there are also some other side dishes that you really should look at as well.  The Fried Spicy Tuna is amazing, it is wrapped in a Japanese Mint leaf and fried in an amazing Tempura batter.  It is just heavenly.   You should definitely give it a try!!!

B's get degrees! When you see a restaurant that has a line of about 20 people 30 mins before opening and is showing off their B rating, you think to yourself.. This place must be damn good to still have a loyal following. So I figured I've eaten in worst places (aka sitting on the sidewalk in NYC), so we hopped into line. They opened up like 10 minutes late, which was kind of annoying since we were starving. As appetizers we ordered the sliced roast pork (yummy pork belly in my belly) and tuna sashimi (again, its hard for raw tuna to disappoint). As an entree we each ordered the Daikokuya Ramen. This is not any old Nissin Top Ramen from your cupboard, its savory noodle goodness! The broth and egg noodles are complimented with pork belly, green onions, bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, sesame seeds and a boiled egg. The normal servings are quite large, especially since soup is sooo filling. You can request for a half size or even a large size. You can even have the soup Tsukemen style in which the noodles, broth and fixings are all separate from each other. That way you can use the broth as a dipping sauce. After my belly was full, I went and used the restroom. Word of advice, use the bathroom before you go. I think I know why they got a B. :(

I heard that this place used to only be open for dinner so it was hard for some people to come and try it out.  My bf and I went to visit his friend in the area and he suggested that we go here.  Am I glad that we did!!!? YES!!  My bf and I-being fugal, we ordered the combination-ramn and 1/2 order rice bowl that came out to $11.85 and the portions were huge.  I liked the fact that I didn't have to pay an extra buck for my egg and boy- the broth was tasty.  They ran out of the rich flavor, but the regular flavor hit my taste buds right on the spot.  It wasn't salty!!  (we should all watch our salt intake these days). We ordered the shredded pork rice bowl and it was delicious.   The only downfall about the place is that it is small, but yet again from previous experiences-any ramen place that is small must be a great place.   Advice: come early.  You sign your name in and remember to stay around there when they call your name because the people who call your name aren't that loud. Next time I'm in town-I am coming back

I've been here twice and both times I visited, I had to wait AT LEAST half an hour. Thus I would not recommend this place anyone wanting a quick round of ramen in J-town. When I came here, I always ordered the combo. It's the best offer when you wait that long to be seated. Also it is a bang for the value (Ramen, small salad with their secret mayo dressing, and a choice of which ever side you order). So people mention this is the best ramen house in Los Angeles and I agree. The secret to their success I think is the berkshire pork they use to flavor the broth. The fat saturates the broth and it leaves a lovely taste. This place gets my vote as the BEST RAMEN HOUSE IN LA. The reason for four stars is quite simple once you have been here. THE WAIT. Due to small limited seating, It's the busiest ramen house in LA. I don't enjoy waiting that long for something that only takes 10 minutes to complete my meal.

If I must say, my friend and I went there at 11am to beat the line. We waited for an hour and it finally opened up at 12pm. It's HOT inside! So be sure to wear light clothes when you decide to eat there. I absolutely love everything they have, especially the smash-garlic side thingie they make... Except, their ramen are not straight but curl like the instant noodles! That's the only one thing that actually put me down in this place. When I want Japanese ramen, I want the STRAIGHT ramen noodles. And, this place is dominated by people who work at LA downtown during lunch time. So try to avoid that time.

This is one of the best ramen houses i've had in US. The broth is carefully crafted, egg was well flavored, the noodles were well textured, the pork was tender but oh the onions were perfect. The balance between the flavors were perfect and not to mention they close fairly late compared to most ramen restaurants

I hail from the OC and every time I am around LA, I end up wanting to go to Daikokuya.  I've had plenty of ramen, some in OC, some in Japan, but this place is as good as it gets in SoCal.  Some people complain there is no variety of ramen types, but that is how the best ramen joints are!!! They specialize in one type, kind of like how various regions of Japan have styles they stick to.   I usually get kotteri style, which makes it a lot more flavorful.  I had just the original flavor the first time I came here, but then after that I only got kotteri which makes the original seem bland! The egg they prepare here is actually better than any ramen places I've had, they even let you choose soft or hard boiled.   This place is easy to find, just look for the crowd of people and the yellow sign.  It does get crowded around lunch and dinner times, but thats a given for anything tasty.  Its a little small, I've only been here with at most 3-4 people.

My sister works nearby and I just so happened to help out at her place today. WOOHOO! My first time here (yes, I know). The place opens at 11am. We arrived at 11:30am and there was ALREADY a long line of apparent die-hard fans. We got seated at the booth after 15 minutes. Not too bad. The place is small and cozy. I ordered their one and only ramen without kotteri (they ran out! :( ). Since there's no take-out, my sister ordered a combo of the ramen and a small teriyaki eel bowl. We took a few bites to pretend "that we've attempted to finish" so that she could take the left-over back for her boss. Not bad. The salad that came with it was delicious though. Ah, sis also ordered the appetizer of sausage. They were way too oily. Nothing special. She told me to try their sliced pork next time I go to Daikokuya. Roger. When I was waiting for my ramen, the two men who were preparing the noodle kept me highly entertained. Waitresses were attentive when I asked for more hot tea. Oh, they also played funky (kids?) music in the bg. I felt like I was at a show. Let's just put it this way. The lady who sat down next to me when I was struggling to finish my bowl of ramen told her partner, "I already know what I want. I only come here for one thing- their ramen. Nothing else." She repeated the same line for about 10 times. EEEEEEYUP. After Daikokuya, I finished all my work within an hour. I feel so warm, alive, and happy. Domo! I'll be BA-CK for the kotteri!

I first went here for lunch several years ago with a few coworkers, but could not remember where it was located.  I finally managed to figure out where it was and, on Labor Day this year, drove downtown with my wife, paid a ridiculous amount for parking and...discovered that the place was closed on Labor Day. So, I settled for Mr. Ramen, a few doors down. Now that the Gold Line is open, and one can get to Little Tokyo without paying loads of money for parking, I thought that I'd give it another go.  We hopped on the train at Fillmore, arrived in Little Tokyo and walked down 1st street.  I passed by Mr. Ramen, and avoided making eye contact with anybody in there.  Although I am sure they saw me...and I'm sure they knew where I was headed. The wait for Daikokuya was about a half hour, even for a party of two.  When we were finally seated, I ordered the Tsukemen- which is basically just like the Ramen, except you assemble it yourself...you can dip and mix the noodles into the broth as you see fit. The food was just as tasty as I remembered it- and the service was fast and friendly.  They are in a bit of a hurry to get you out once you are done, which is understandable, as there was a line stretching out the door.  This is not a place where you should plan on lingering once you are done eating. Overall, this was worth the trek down to Little Tokyo, and worth the wait.   Sorry, Mr. Ramen- Daikokuya has THE top ramen.

This is by far my favorite restaurant in LA for Japanese food of any kind. Due to recent notoriety, this place's wait has been getting LONG. I recommend showing up at 10:59AM if you enjoy waking up to a bowl of good ramen. Any time after that, the wait has become ridiculous. If you want ramen, this is place to get it. The soup is really just the best you'll find anywhere. It also comes in a few variations. If you feel like you're body fat percentage is not high enough, definitely consider the kotteri because it is just so buttery. In a related note, they also have a LARGE size ramen that is not advertised. Bang that out for extra calories, worth it. Also available is the tsukemen, but to be honest I can hardly discern any difference except that the give  you fried cha shu rather than just cooked. Now if you're into dry things, the PORK bowl is just as fatty and just as delicious. Bento Box is another must have and every one of the options is good, tempura, chicken teri, tonkatsu, spicy/cali roll, tuna ahi sashimi. Also, they won't sell you a t-shirt no matter how much you beg. Those waiters have morals. UPDATE: For shorter lines, check out the Alhambra location. They also have a Chicken Karaage in portions that normally aren't legal this side of the border.

This is the best ramen house I've ever been to! They cook their egg just right so that you have a little moistness inside. Loves it! The fried spicy tuna appetizer is also really unique to this place. I don't what type of leaf they use to wrap the tuna but it is freakn delicious. Everyone should try this appetizer at least once. I got the kotteri soup base last time which made it extra thick. The portions are definitely big enough to fill me up. This is the best ramen house ever hands down.

Not a big fan of the ramen or the broth, cos it's very bland-ish, and the ramen is like I don't know I don't really like it. I prefer Orochon over this, and Orochon's not even as good as SANTOUKA! YUMMS What I do like here is the gyoza, and the pork with sweet sauce!

Two thumbs up! There isn't much more I can say that hasn't already been said. The ramen broth is INCREDIBLE. Full of rich meaty flavor :) I love the shredded pork, boiled egg and green onions in it. So simple, yet so good! Who would have thought a bowl of warm ramen could make you feel so happy? They also serve bento boxes and rice bowls...all of which are oh-so-good!   Be warned though, this place is ALWAYS packed. I had to wait 30 minutes to get a seat. Also, it is incredibly LOUD! But I like the noise, it adds to the energy of the atmosphere. A good place for friends or a social gathering (when you finally get a seat). I liked sitting at the bar and getting to watch the cooks hard at work preparing my feast. Definately a hole-in-the-wall type place...so don't expect any type of ambiance. Service is great though! The place is open late, so it's cool for those late-night cravings.   Overall I would recommend Daikokya. An amazing find in the heart of Little Tokyo. Prices are more than reasonable ($8.50 for a bowl of delicious noodle goodness!). The place is tiny and confined, always crowded and loud, and a wait is pretty much guranteed. But hey, it is worth it when you get that first mouthful of tasty ramen :) It will keep you coming back for more. I want some right now. lol.

Having been a super loyal fan of Shin Ramen which can be simply made at home in 3 minutes, I was never too crazy about Japanese ramen. And this place got me hooked on it ever since I'd moved to LA. Just try some on a rainy, chilly day with some gyoza and (yes, I said "and") shredded pork. Drink the soup. It'a all about the soup. Drink all of it. The wait will be really long, so just patiently put your name down and visit the store next door that sells strange freaky gothic costumes.

This is by far the best ramen place in LA. Everything is just cooked to perfection. The noodle, the soup, the pork, the egg. The gyoza is the best also. 5 pcs per portion. Their salad is surprisingly good. And it's only $1 extra. They have finally branched out and I just found out that there's one in Hacienda heights, which is close to me. I've tried the other branches in Monterey Park and Costa Mesa, they're not as good as the one in LA. The one in Costa Mesa is actually the worst, maybe because it's in a food court. I can't wait to try out the one in Hacienda Heights..

Hands down the best ramen in LA!!!! The food itself worth five star, but due to the fact that the place is soooo smalll and it gets packed really fast, so minus one star!! I've tried orochon, santouka and hakata ramen and I love Daikokuya! Everytime I ate Daikokuya, I always feel satisfied! and unlike Hakata that charged you for every little thing and only give you two thin slices of pork??? Daikokuya is much better !!! The broth was very tasty and the flavoured egg was awesome! Best Ramen!

Never been disappointed with the ramen yet except for the one time they ran out of "back fat" in the soup broth.  You gotta get the ramen with back fat and you'll be set.  If you are going to eat here you gotta be prepared for the wait as the restaurant is quite small and there are a lot of people who want to eat here even late night.  I can't fully vouch for the other items here other than the fried rice which was also great. Oh remember that they serve Japanese Ramen not curry.  One time I was here and the person was asking if they served curry, and the waiter/host was like... "we only sell Japanese Ramen, no curry!"  ... I guess that person was a first timer!

I have to admit, my ramen pallet isn't as well developed as some of the other yelpers on here.  Actually, prior to this experience, I don't think I've ever had ramen from any where other than the grocery store. That being said, I wasn't all that impressed.  I wasn't aware of the hype surrounding this place before we went, so it's not like I had high expectations or anything.  The hour and a half wait didn't even factor into my rating because we just went across the street and had some drinks. We ordered the ramen combo with the shredded pork bowl and a deep fried pork appetizer.  The appetizer had no distinct flavor to it what so ever.  I could have been eating chicken, lamb, frog.....you couldn't taste it.   Next was ramen and I have the say, the pork inside the broth melts in your mouth.  Other than the pork, the ramen was just so-so.  The broth wasn't flavorful and from my perspective it could have used some spices to heat things up. Finally came the shredded pork bowl.  This was a mini version of the dish with shredded pork soaked in a delicious sauce with pickled ginger and onion over rice.  I really enjoyed this dish and wish I hadn't stuffed myself on everything thing else so I could have enjoyed it all. Glad I experienced this place, but I probably won't be back.  I'm sure they won't miss me though....there was a line out the door until 1am so they must be doing something right.

Three and 1/4 stars. Was here today, Thursday, 11:15 am. Only me and two other were at the restaurant. Got busier by the time I left, 12 noon. Loud Japanese teen music playing as I entered. Maybe gets the staff up and ready. It was turned down after 15 minutes(no, I didn't say anything). Several very elderly couples entered right before the music was lowered. Parking: Try 2nd Street first, then walk through the middle of the plaza to 1st. Or just walk around the block. $2.00 per hour metered parking. Now to the Ramen Soup. You are given a very large bowl full of broth (seemed like a 1/2 gallon) that had  noodles, pork and scallion, and a whole egg. The amount of broth is inappropriate to the  amount of the other ingredients. The broth is good. Very smooth taste. Something a grandmother would take time and care to make. Nothing surprising to the taste buds though. The noodles were also good.  $8.95, and no significant salty after taste. The stand out were the pork slices. More slices than most ramen places, they were tasty, and lean. In general, I would add more leafy ingrediants, or have less broth. I like their bowl of eel and rice, which I have had several times before. Tried sitting at the counter, too warm, table near the door was much better. PS: All their ramen soup have MSG.

I'm honestly not a Japanese Ramen fan... I only came here couple of times because my friends craved it.   But on my second visit last night, i realized it's actually pretty great.   Maybe it's because the people I was eating with were able to explain the greatness behind the food... or maybe my taste buds were just more awakened... but their ramen is pretty stinking good. My friend and I shared a Combo of Ramen and a shredded pork thing bowl.  We got an extra egg for the ramen for an additional $1, because apparently the EGG is specially prepared in this tea (that's why they are brown!!)   We asked for a spicy oil condiment to add to our noodles, and it definitely enhanced the flavors of the ramen soup. My only qualm about this place is the wait (we waited for about 1hr on a Wed night) and the small space.  But I guess it's all worth it when the food is that great.

Great ramen place in little tokyo. They also do tempura, terayaki, and other japanese dishes pretty well too. But you come here for the ramen. U had the shredded pork ramen. Awesome!

Been back to this place about a million times since we live in the neighborhood. Still consistently good ramen, but I am starting to be a fan of the straight noodles instead (Asa Ramen and Chabuya have straight noodles). Gyoza are still delicious, but sometimes they have a bunch of fried stuff hanging on like they didn't clean the pan in between orders. My new favorite dish is the fried rice, which looks deceptively plain and boring but has tons of flavor thanks to the pork! And I must mention their salad - it used to be shredded in long strips and I am not a fan of the more coleslaw type shredding they're doing now, but that dressing - YUM! It's still the sh*t. I sometimes get crazy cravings just for the salad dressing. But seriously, the wait? Ugh. Even on a Sunday afternoon at 3pm we had to wait 20 minutes. We even bought a membership to the Japanese American Museum just so we have something to do while waiting.

Bottom line is that their ramen here is awesome. Pork broth, slivers of pork belly and noodles with a hard boiled egg. If you are feeling hungrier than normal, get the combination and you can get a small rice bowl entree with the ramen. Be prepared to wait!  I would say the average wait time is 20 minutes and you cannot order to go!

I remember when the wait for this place was only 15-20 mins... Now it's like 45-1 hour!!! but it's soooo worth the wait. I've been going here for 6 years already and I still crave it monthly. It's all about the ramen... I've tried a lot of home made ramen from my friends parent's and grand parents but this stuff is just out of bounds good. Read all of the other reviews.... I mean a thousand reviews can't go wrong right?? If you do go expect a wait... try not to go in a giant group because the place is only really set up with booths for 4 (maybe 5 or 6 if you squeeze) and bar seating.

Being that this was the first ramen place I've visited I wasn't sure what to expect or order, but judging from the line and waiting list I hoped Daikokuya Ramen was worth the trip downtown. I was not disappointed. I'm now a ramen believer, carb calories be damned! I believe the magic is in the delicious and savory broth. I mean, how can you go wrong with fatty succulent pork flavoring your soup?! :) I wish the place had more capacity. It is definitely very small and the wait was long...almost too long.

First time trying Daikokuya ramen in Little Tokyo.  Funny I would rate this location 1 star higher than their other spot, despite the the food tasting identical.  This was their original restaurant, and the vibe just feels better.  The place is packed , with a 30 minute wait time on a random thursday night. Food-wise: ordered the ramen combo /w the mini rice bowl & gyoza on the side ~$20 total. Gyoza: 3.5 star.  pretty good, but small portions. Salad: 5 star. comes with the combo, OMG good stuff. Shredded Pork Bowl: 4 star.  tastes pretty good, and when you add in the dipping sauce from the gyoza, even better. Ramen (non-Kotteri style): 3 star.  I thought I would be impressed, since everything was so good so far, but it wasn't.  It was the same old ramen.  Everything by the book, but uninspiring.  Still prefer Santokua.  So I added in some garlic sauce, and now we have a party! Overall: really enjoyed the location, the vibe, the food (is it worth the wait? probably not).  Would I come back again?  you betcha!

Over the last couple of weeks, all of my friends having been absolutely raving about this place. To be quite honest, I'm not that big of a ramen fan, but because everyone kept talking about this place, I finally decided to give it a shot. Going with a friend, we both got the ramen - we wanted to try the combination, which comes with special toppings on rice, but after seeing the size of the bowl, we figured we wouldn't be able to eat all of it (true: we were super full after eating it, but we couldn't stop because it was so delicious!). From my very first sip of the broth I was blown away. I'm usually whatever about the ramen noodles, but the noodles were delicious too - they really absorbed the flavors in the broth. My friend and I loved the ramen so much that we're considering going back tomorrow morning!! All of my friends who have raved about the place have also warned us about the wait - that's actually one of the reasons it took me so long to visit. I always reasoned that I didn't want to have to wait in line, but really, if you're lazy like me, trust me, it's totally worth the wait. We went around 1pm on a Saturday afternoon and there was a line; however, we only ended up waiting maybe 15 minutes before being seated at the counter. All in all, the wait wasn't too bad and it was definitely worth it!

Alright. Everything you've heard about this place is true. You will wait for a table (expect upwards of 30-40 minutes) You will eventually be sat. You will then order the ramen combination kotterri style with a shredded pork bowl. You will then embark on the culinary journey of a life time and see that just as I've said here today, everything that all your friends have been saying is true. This place is madness. The whole experience, starting with the ambiance. The japanese posters adorning the neutrally colored walls make you feel as though you've stepped into a busy noodle house somewhere on the backstreets of shibuya. The salad they start you with is merely an intro to what's coming. Once they hit you with the shredded pork bowl you realize that these guys know how to treat a pig. Good ratio of veggies and sauce on top of fluffy white rice. Then it comes. That big beautiful steaming hot bowl of insanity. Egg noodles perfectly cooked, pork belly so juicy and tender it seems to melt in your mouth. Don't forget to break that whole egg in half so the yolky goodness disperses throughout the rest of your bowl making the broth (which is hands down the highlight here) even silkier and more intense. So basically, if you're thinking about trying this place...just go ahead and do it. Bring your friends, they'll love it too. This is one of those places that's only going up in the world through the power of word of mouth.

FANTASTIC noodle shop. There's always a wait and the menu isn't long but the ramen is truly exceptional. I've had a few of the appetizers as well and they're no slouches. I've never been there when there wasn't a group on the sidewalk waiting for a table, but don't let that deter you. Go, go, GO!

Wow, I think the sheer quantity of reviews says it all about Daikokuya. Their ramen is off the hook! The tonkotsu is amazing and their combo sets are super cheap too. The rice bowl that it comes with was really good value for the price we paid. My only comment would be that they need to lay off a little on the sliced green onions. I personally don't mind them, but for some people it might overpower the dish. Anyways, the best part was their reservation system (check out my pic!)

Ramen ramen ramen... where oh where shall I go to find some good ramen? :) I figured... if it's in Little Tokyo, it has to be pretty good right? I tried out Santouga before and was quite impressed with their delicious bowls but didn't quite like how it was in a food court. My friend and I decided to give Daikokuya a whirl and spent some time outside waiting to be seated. Hm... busy.... good sign right? When we were finally seated, the service was prompt and friendly. I liked the atmosphere with the old school Japanese paintings and a semi outdoors ish feel with the roofs. The anime music playing in the background was a bit strange though haha. At any rate, we ended up getting the ramen (of course!), gyoza, and a pork cutlet bowl... too much food! I was not expecting the ramen bowl to be so huge! All of the food was delicious but if I had to redo the order, I'd probably pass on the pork cutlet since it was more for filler. Although, I did like the salad that came with the combination. Now, the ramen was terrific. Chewy noodles and melt-in-your-mouth pieces of pork. What else could you ask for? :)

Well all I can say is this place is the best ramen I had so far, but who knows there might be a better one out there. I had the ramen combo with pork cutlet. The broth was flavorful and tasty you can taste the pork back fat they put in it. The cabbage salad they give looks plain, but is actually very good and cold like it's suppose to be. I also went to the one in monterey park, just as good, but one difference. The food here is tempature hot which is they way I like it, also expect a long wait if you go during lunch or peak dinner hours.

Daiokuya is the best Ramen place to which I have ever been. If you want to eat here, you have to get here early. This place is ALWAYS packed. A typical wait during dinnertime is around an hour. I really wish that Daikokuya eventually expands. The Ramen comes in a large portion with a lot of noodles and the soup is flavoured to perfection. Unlike many Ramen places that charge for extra ingredients, Daikokuya already includes a good mix of ingredients in the Ramen. In addition to the Ramen, I also love the shredded pork bowl. The pork is tasty and feels like it is melting in my mouth as I eat it. Even though the wait is always long, it is worth it! If you are a Ramen-lover, Daikokuya is a must!

You can't go wrong with Daikokuya! Well that is if you're a kotteri/miso fan. If you like the rich stuff. Price isn't cheap but it's reasonable. Working in LT someone's always asking for recommendation for a good ramen shop. I always point them here. Be prepared to wait though! If you want ramen but with quicker seating or in other styles (like shoyu) go to Kouraku or Orochon. They're usually good too.

I love ramen, and I love that LA has a plethora of ramen places to choose from. Daikokuya is one of the best ramen places in town. The noodles are far much better than Orochon, and the broth is good, especially if you are a miso fan. I'm more of pork broth fan myself, but I know when I taste good broth and the green onion accentuates the wonderful flavors already in the broth. The only thing I hate about this place is the wait. However, once you get a bowl of their ramen you remember why you always come back despite the 2 hour wait.

One of my 2 favorite Ramen places to go. Around $8.50 for the ramen.  You can also have it as tsukemen (broth & noodles separated).  You can also request kotteri for a richer broth, and I mean very rich, sometimes I just order the ramen as is.  The broth and pork slice is perfect.  The pork being from the kurobuta (black pork) is very juicy & tender... The egg is always great & flavorful, I love the yolk part... ^^  I also like to order their salad, it's very refreshing and delicious.  A good light appetizer before digging in the rich ramen. I usually have to wait between half an hour up to 2 hours just to eat here, but it's worth it.  ^^ Tried their other branches, but I don't like them, the original one in Little Tokyo is still the best! ^^

Amazing Ramen!!! The place is really small but definitely smells really delicious when you walk in. It is a really well-known place so there will most likely be a long wait. When I went with my friends we had to wait an hour and 45 minutes until we were seated. The food was very tasty!! The ramen tasted like it was straight from Japan! The decorations are very authentic and neat. I love this place.  Although I'm still debating if the reason the ramen was so delicious was due to extreme hunger from waiting so long to be seated or if it was authentically delicious.

Top Ramen this is not! It's worth the long wait, and is probably the best ramen I've ever had. The place smells of slow-cooking pork broth, the bowls are enormous (and a great deal at around $7) and they do have things other than their special house ramen for those not in a noodley mood. While it is rushyrush dining - they just want you to scarf your food and bolt out the door - it's definitely worth the trek at least once to see what all the fuss is about! Just don't come with more than a couple people, or be prepared to wait forever.

Could only give four stars only because this is my first time trying Ramen.  After reading all the reviews we decided on Daikokuya.  It was the best experience!!  Took our 15 & 16 year old son and daughter and their friend.  Everybody loved It... They can be very picky!!  The noodles were perfect the broth just rite!  Kids had a hard time with the Egg only cuz they couldn't get around the funky color but thought it tasted good.  The Fried Rice was soooo good!!   So...  the best part was we could get a half bowl... I was paying for everything myself.  It was plenty!  Probably more healthy for us cuz I could have kept on eating!  We all split a plate of rice and the pork dumplings,  with the half bowl it was perfect..... Get there early, put you name down and wait for them to call you... Then enjoy!!

I hate a long wait for seating so if you share that in common with me, come in here during their off-peak hours, which is around 3-5 pm.  Otherwise, expect to wait at least an hour for a seat during dinner hours.   Here's a list of what I've tried: Daikokuya ramen:  Yummy, light, and clean.  Chashu really does have that buttery melt in your mouth texture.   Ki-Chi Men Ramen with and without Kotteri:  This is their newest ramen flavor.  It's slightly spicy and a little sour, which is exactly how I like my ramen.  Unlike the daikokuya ramen, this one comes with the broth separate from the noodles.  THEEEE BEST! Tuna Sashimi Bowl:  I was a fool, and saw the word 'sashimi', immediately got excited, and ordered this with my ramen.  I'm not a big fan of tuna so I didn't like this.  'Tuna' is the first word.  Still don't know how I missed it.  For tuna lovers, the fish was fresh. Deep fried spicy tuna:  This was okay.  Tasted very clean, but it didn't have a lot of flavor in it like spicy tuna usually does.  I could see a lot of people not liking this as it is wrapped in a shizo leaf.  I did not mind that though. Gyoza:  Good, but my dinner partner told me that these store bought gyozas my mom bought were better. Sliced roast pork:  Slightly sweet, and is so far my favorite appetizer from here. Fried rice:  Has a clean taste to it.  Not too greasy, which helps keep this dish light.  This is my side of choice when ordering my ramen meal. The ramen is what this place is known for, and is really what you should get.  Strangely enough, my favorite part of the ramen was the hardboiled egg.  They boiled it in a way so it was not completely cooked through the inside.  I really enjoyed this as I did not have that dry egg texture where it sticks to my teeth, and I am attempting to lick it off while also trying to eat.  Other yelpers definitely are not lying when they mention the chashu's buttery texture.  It really is like butter.   The perks of the place: -Good food -Great and fast service The downside: -People who are still waiting for a table will sometimes begin to slowly creep their way inside.  It sucks when you're at that first booth, and a group of people are standing next to your booth.  A little invasive, and after waiting for your own booth, I'm sure that anyone would appreciate some privacy. All in all, there's not much to complain about.  If you eat here, you will probably like it.

After a long night of consuming alcohol and I'm feeling hungry, Daikokuya is the place to be. Open late, we usually go around 1 am Friday/Saturday Nights and the place is packed. We usually wait around 30-40 minutes for a party of 5+. Ramen is great soup is amazing (Top 3 in L.A: Yes I Said it) Tonkatsu bowl, the fried rice is definitely a must try as well, shredded pork bowl is also good eating, and the gyoza's are delicious. The service is very fast and the waiters are very friendly. Only bad thing I believe is this place is cash only and I always CARD at night  -_-. You have to street park when you want to come here and eat, the good spots right in front are always taken and we always park at least 1 block down.  =(

Daikokuya has pretty good ramen. This place is extremely busy and had about a 20 minute wait. Nonetheless, despite how busy they were and the amount of traffic going in and out, the staff is really attentive and friendly. It seems to be surrounded by a lot of hype about how good the ramen is, but I'm just not head over heels with this place. I saw nothing but ramen and ricebowl combos being ordered all around me, but not wanting to overextend myself I decided to just order ramen since the serving size was huge enough. I didn't find it to be salty but good enough to add just hot pepper powder. It might just be me but I did not find anything out of the ordinary concerning the broth. It had a good amount of pork cut into it, a lot of scallions which I like, and noodles which were plentiful, although mine came out sort of clumped together which wasn't a huge deal breaker. I was also told that it was somewhat of a necessity to get the backfat added to the broth yet I've also been told it really makes no difference. Sort of hard to figure it out but oh well. I think the next time I visit, I'll order a combo just to see how the rice bowls taste. I can't really compare shops since most have a distinctive style of their own or are representative from different regions but if you're in the mood I'm sure this won't disappoint you.

only drawback is that the restaurant is small.  if you get there at the wrong time you will be waiting.   Food ramen is one of the best.  others in the area are not crowded at all but this restaurant will be.  the pork bowl is good too.  get it as a side.   price prices are good.  around $10.   atmosphere.   the place is a bit small and it gets hot in there too because the kitchen is in the dinning area.

Hello my friends! I venture to Daikokuya on a Monday and got there at about 11:06.  There was no line and I was able to get a booth really fast.  The service was great.  I ordered the Daikokyua Ramen combo with fried rice.  I usually get fried rice with my ramen at all the places that I go to eat ramen, simply to use it as barometer. I was first served a salad that was mediocre. However the combination of the ramen and fried rice was amazing.  The brooth wasn't as thick as Mottainai or as oily as Santouka, but it was flavorful enough.  The noodles, pork, and shoots added a tremendous amount of flavor and created a dining experience.  The fried rice stood out as it was very flavorful.  I would like the broth to have more of a soul, but it was acceptable considering everything else. I would have given this place a perfect if the salad and broth were better.

Apparently you either side with Daikokuya or you side with Santouka...guess I am on team Santouka. Ramen was good don't get me wrong, but it just lacked the wow factor or whatever cheesy descriptor you want to use. Seemed honestly maybe even a touch bland, solid but I wasn't quite seeing the hype.

The food here is FREAKING DELICIOUS!!! Of course being a ramen house, the ramen here is fantabulous! I got their signature dish, Daikakuya Ramen and it is delicious. The broth is very tasty and very rich in flavor but it does not leave you with a cotton mouth feel afterward (good sign of low MSG?). The richness of the broth complements the ramen (perfectly cooked BTW) very well. I been to the Arcadia and Torrance location and by far place is the best. Something to note about this place is very small and seating is very limited. Any groups bigger than four... good luck. There is always a giant line, even during none-prime meal time. I live 15 minutes walk away I haven't gone back because of the line. If you want to chow down here the fastest way is to sit at the "bar" (2 or less, gets seated very fast). Waiting for a table is insane!

Hate to rain on everyone's parade, but HONESTLY this is the most middle of the road ramen I've ever had. Maybe my perspective is tainted by the horrible wait I had to suffer through even at 11:00 PM on a Thursday night, but I do think this place is over-hyped. There is just nothing special about this place - other restaurants make ramen that serve as perfect Daikokuya substitutes... why do I need to come here and suffer the wait? Mer..  I think I'll pass.

My favorite ramen EVER!  What's there to say that hasn't already been said about this place?? If only the wait weren't so bad.  Oh well, it's worth it.  Tried the tuna sashimi for the first time here.  VERY GOOD!! Shredded pork bowl = AMAZING!!

Wow, daikokuya has nearly 3000 reviews and for good reason! I can honestly say that this is one of the best ramen places I've tried since I got into the ramen craze over the last couple years. (this review is only for the little Tokyo location, I've heard that the other locations are generally less consistent with their broths) I've been here a few time over the past few months and I'm so glad I checked it out. The place is pretty small but service is generally pretty fast. I try to get there right when it opens or at least before noon to avoid the long waits bc this place always gets packed. There's only street parking (if youre lucky enough to find a spot) but I recommend just parking in a lot for $5. If you're going to come here you must get the ramen + fried rice combo. The broth is creamy, hearty and always hot, ESP because you can see them making it hot for you. The ramen is always served al dente and can even sit within the broth for ~10 min without getting soggy. The half cooked egg it comes with is soft in the middle and oozes yolk once you bite into it, soo good. The pork fried rice is seriously so delicious. It's crazy how much flavor they pack into that rice, although I'll admit is a little greasy at times. It's also great to dip into your ramen broth or to eat with the pickled ginger it comes with. I've never tried anything else here, but why stray from what you know is good? I'd highly recommend this location to anyone craving ramen. In my opinion, daikokuya is way better than shishengumi that's across the street.

i'm sorry to say but this isn't the best Ramen Noodle i've ever had. First the line/wait is long Second the place is small 3rd the food was just "OKAY AVERAGE" I will not wait for a freakin Ramen for one hour, it is not worth it, I rather go somewhere else that is shorter. There is this one place that is pretty good but i forgot the name of it hahha. I don't see why people will wait in the line for this long just for a freakin ramen. Its just too ridiculous and too much. I'm rating this one star because of the wait, if the wait doesn't have to be long i will rate it 5 star.

I like Daikokuya. I really do. The ramen is delicious, and the place is authentic. But the wait.....oh the wait! Its so long. Both times I've gone I've had to wait over an hour. I know its good, but I can't wait that long when I'm hungry! I haven't been to any of the other locations, but maybe I should try. And I have to drive in circles around Little Tokyo to find a parking spot that I don't have to pay for. i know, I'm cheap, but paying $6 to park in a lot is not worth it to me. But, I digress. Really good ramen, but only with a really long wait.

This ramen shop in Little Tokyo gets 4.5 stars. I ordered the ramen kotteri style (extra back fat), which came in a huge bowl. The ramen was silky and perfectly al dente, the broth was tastier and far less salty than Santouku's in Culver City and came topped with a soft-boiled egg, sliced roast pork, and plenty of green onions, all for $8.50. We added on a small bowl of the chicken egg bowl with rice, which was tasty for an additional $3, but entirely too much food even for one hungry person. Too bad that the broth at Ippudo in NY is still better, silkier and richer-tasting. However, for the quantity, quality, and price, Daikokuya was great. We arrived at 5:30 and were seated immediately - I don't think I'd wait longer than 30 minutes for this place. Street parking or $7 in the adjacent lot. Cash only.

I love the Ramen here! I always order Kotteri regular ramen. Sometimes I get combo but the ramen is pretty big so that's actually a lot of food. Only one thing that I hate that we have to wait for 30-60mins in dinner time because this place is very popular....

As i meandered into the cramped, close-quartered confines of Daikokuya, the savory aroma of the kitchen's soups filled my nose. When ordering the specialty daiku ramen, expect to be surprised. This invigorating and hearty broth tastes like no ramen you have tried before. The pork literally melted in my mouth and the noodles had a solid texture. My greatest regret was not having ordered two bowls. Will definitely be ordering a bowl in the near future.

on most occasions, i have had to wait about 30 minutes to an hour to get a seat.  However, the first time I was introduced to Daikokuya (thank you zaki)... it was about midnight on a weekend and I didn't have to stand in line at all =) Mmm... get the combo with unagi over rice. what a deal!!!! for the price, ambiance.. and hopefully, good company.

I was going to give this place 2 stars but then I thought it wasn't very fair since I'm not a ramen fan in the first place.  I try to like ramen, I really do.  Broth, noodles, egg, bamboo shoots, and massive amounts of salt.  I love all of those things but for some reason I just can't get into ramen. So tonight my husband and I go to this place so I can give ramen another shot and so he can have something he rarely gets to eat.  After waiting for about 40 minutes, which I hear isn't unheard of for this place, we finally get seated and order our ramen and gyoza.   The gyoza came out quickly and was really great.  It was the perfect combination of crispy and juicy.  Then the ramen came and I was initially surprised at how tasty the broth was. But after the third or fourth spoonful I felt the dish became monotonous and overly salty.  My husband slurped up almost his entire bowl and was happy to look over at mine and realize that he was going to get to have left overs for lunch tomorrow. Ultimately I decided to give this place three stars based on the fact that I liked the gyoza, the waitress was incredibly nice, and that my husband said it was some of the best ramen that he's had in a long time.  As for me, I doubt I will ever be back but that won't stop me from recommending this place to someone who is looking for a bowl of ramen.

What a great bowl of noodles! I ordered the Daikoku Ramen with the fried rice.  Next time, I'm starving for three days before I go so I can eat more food.  As the other reviews stated, get there early or else you'll end up waiting. But the wait is definitely worth it.

I am adding one more star from my last review because: 1) I finally saw whole pieces of Pork in my noodle 2) Bf likes them, saying the broth is good and it's a good hang over food. :p 3) We wrote down our names and then went to Little Tokyo. Since there were two party of 6 ahead of us, so we figured we probably had to wait for an hour or so.  When we returned after about 50 minutes, they already called our names and a few more.  A staff was right there when we were wondering what'd happened.  Then she said "there are two stools at the end of counter available, you could go right ahead"  WOOHOO!  I love them for letting us in even we missed it at the first time, instead of having us wait longer.   Thank you! I think it is better to get there earlier, like around 6 or 7.  There are less people and seems like their service (or at least the seating arrangement) is better around that time. P.S. They improved to a grade B now.

Another Friday night dinner with the lady friend brought us to Daikokuya.  We've tried to go before, but we were too hungry to wait in line.  This time we decided to wait it out.  We waited about an hour, but let me tell you, it was well worth it.   I think I was able to read through most of the reviews on Yelp while waiting for our table, so I don't want to repeat too much of what has already been said. I got the Daikoku Ramen (w/ kotteri flavor) combo with the small shredded pork bowl.  Lady friend had the Daikoku Ramen combo with the small teriyaki eel bowl.  The soup was lip smackin' good.  The meat in the ramen and pork bowl were "I-can-eat-here-when-I'm-gray-and-old-with-no-­teeth" TENDER.  We also got the california roll...  Looking back, I don't know why we ordered it.  There was no shortage of food with the combo and there was nothing special about the cali roll either.  The eel was tasty and the teriyaki sauce was not gooey or too sweet. Save your money and just go for the combo.  We will definitely be going back there, but make sure you give yourself a hungry time buffer before going, or else you're going to starve waiting for your seat.

Delicious ramen, but the cramped and stuffy environment plus hit-and-miss parking earns Daikokuya no more than four stars with me. My first impression of the place was its dinky size. The restaurant is relatively small, and seating is rather limited, probably no more than 35 customers. This is made worse by the open kitchen, which makes the place a bit stuffy. Of course, most ramen places, especially in Little Tokyo, don't have spectacular interiors, so I didn't have much expectations for Daikokuya on this end. Now as for the food, I had the Daikoku Ramen. THE BROTH IS AMAZING! Best ramen soup I've ever had. The noodles were average, but still tasty, though it did somewhat remind me of instant noodles. The slices of pork were great, and as previous reviews have said, they literally melted in my mouth! The hard boiled egg, and everything else in the bowl, were great as well. I will definitely return to Daikokuya in the future to try out the other menu items.

I was debating whether or not to give this place 5 stars because of the horrendous wait and mediocre service but the ramen is just that good...and the salad...and the fried rice.  If you are in the OC, they also opened one at the Marukai in Costa Mesa with practically no wait : ).  I actuallly go there more often now.  The difference of course is you are eating in a food court.  I don't care what anyone says I think it denigrates the experience; and you can't get sushi as part of the combo.  But you are at Marukai so if you really feel like sushi just buy it and take it home!    I think if I was taking a friend for the first time I would have to take them to the one in Little Tokyo for the experience. I'm new to yelp and I picked to review this restaurant first for a reason.

Best ramen in L.A that we've found thus far. The broth is rich (we always get it kotteri). The pork is super tender. The egg compliments everything in the bowl. They give you plenty of ramen! Their fried rice is awesome! So buttery! Only downside (well, as a patron, but good for the restaurant) is that there is usually AT LEAST a 30 minute wait on any given day, at any given time. I remember when my husband and I first started going here (about 2-3 years ago) our wait time was no more than 15 minutes. And we've noticed the price of the Daikoku ramen steadily increasing, but they don't skimp on the portions, so that's good. A good choice for a cold night/day....or any day you're craving ramen.

VERY good ramen. If you want good ramen in Los Angeles, definitely go here. But "hands-down best ramen"? Sorry bud, try going to gardena, or torrance, or even up to the bay area. I can think of at least 5 other places that are just as good, if not better. it's just that none of them are in L.A. The broth is savory and flavorful (and super heavy if you want the kotteri style).  Noodles have great chew to them, and the eggs are PERFECTLY soft boiled every time.   If you're really hungry, you can get the combo which also comes with a rice bowl (I always get it to go for an extra meal later).  Summer time also means cold noodles, which are excellent. I love this place for what it is, and it's difinitely worth the wait.

We stopped by here on a Saturday around lunch and the line was out the door, so we knew it must be good. The wait was going to be a half hour. We were working, so we bagged it and came back on Monday before the lunch rush. The place only seats maybe 30 people including at the bar. It was hot and crowded. The booths aren't very wide so big folks beware. The service was good considering the crowd. At lunch be prepared to wait. If you aren't the patient type, there are several other really decent Japanese restaurants on the same block. It was good, but it's probably not worth a half hour wait unless you have your heart set on ramen. The food was good. As everyone else has said the ramen is very good. The broth is awesome. It's so thick, it's closer to gravy than soup! Also, try the sausage appetizers and the tuna sashimi bowl. Be very hungry. It's a lot of food.

When asked my favorite places to eat, Daikokuya will no doubt get a mention in the Noodle category. It is one of the best places in LA to get ramen. I wish I could say something about their other menu items, but I can not speak on them with any authority. I, invariably, get the tekkami styled (added back pork fat.....like the tastiness of bacon in a milky consistency. I know it would kill me but I would drink this straight) ramen. The soup is delectable and much more flavorful than other ramen joints....when I go, conversation will often be halted to fully enjoy and embrace the ramen experience. Even when you are full of such warm happy goodness, you will not be able to stop yourself until you see the bottom of the bowl. A staple for anyone up for culinary exploration in LA, Daikokuya is well worth the wait....and there is often a wait. For the best results try hitting it just before the lunch or dinner rushes.

Dailkokuya is one of my favorite ramen place followed right by shin-sen-gumi in Los Angeles. There is almost always a line here due to its popularity, but it is so worth the wait because the food here is extremely bomb! When I come visit here I usually write down my name and go circle around Little Tokyo while waiting. When you enter the restaurant, it is important to remember that it is extremely hot in there because the cooking kitchen is right next to the serving tables. Of course, you have to order the Daikokuya Ramen here, the soup is extremely tasty because of the pork fat broth, you can also add ginger and garlic into the soup to flav it up! :) super delicious! mm mm

For some serious grub, hop on down to Daikokuya. Their rice bowls are hot and delicious. But the best thing is to combo it up with a bowl of ramen. The ramen is filled with good stuff; good chunks of pork and and egg. The broth is tasty, but I actually prefer the hotness and flavor of Orochon. Still you get a lot of bang for your buck here. Arrive early or you'll be waiting a while for a table. You could sit at the counter, but it gets real hot right next to the giant vat of steamy soup. The place is pretty small/tight, so it can get pretty hot in general.

Oh man this place is FRIGGIN BOMB. So my friend and I came to Little Tokyo HUNGRY as bears, and we were looking for a good place to eat. We looked up a couple of places on Yelp to try, our first option was San Sai but alas on a Saturday night at 11:20 PM they were out of stock. One of the workers there came out and profusely appologized about it and said come back tomorrow, they should be restocked then. We then started walking down the street and noticed this place, and decided it might be one of the places we'd try. We also saw Mr. Ramen (dont go there, the vibe is whack and the waitresses are TERRIBLE). We then decided to try Mr. Ramen first... and so much happened there... so much disappointment. So we left and paid for our unsatisfactory foods and still had empty stomachs. My friend and I contemptplated what we should do next since we were both still REALLY hungry and we came across this place. Decided to try it and oh man, it was money well spent. My friend had the LARGE Ramen bowl... it was ginourmous! Then I had the Ramen bowl + Shredded Pork bowl combo and my god, it was to die for. The ramen was great, wasn't too salty, well flavored, nice texture... the noodles were so friggin good. The pork was like amazing! It was so tender, I wouldn't have thought it was pork! Their rice bowls were like, on par with the ramen cause even though I was full I wanted MORE! So in all, if you want DELICIOUS Japanese food, thats filling, tastey, and a whole bunch of other adjectives GO HERE. Go here with friends

My brother introduced me to this place few years back, and I have been eating at this restaurant at least once a month. Once you get to Little Tokyo, parking is a little annoying because you have to hunt for a meter parking spot around the area (though it's free if you go after 9 PM or something), or you have to park in one of the parking structures/lots that are ~5-8 dollars. After parking, you'll usually find people crowding around the yellow banner outside of the restaurant, and who knows how long they've been waiting there for. After you get to the restaurant, go straight inside and find the clipboard with the list of people waiting for seats. Just write your name down and wait patiently because the food here is SO good. Even when the waits are so long sometimes, the broth and the pork chasu inside the ramen is so tender and delicious, I think it's definitely worth the wait. I haven't ordered the combo meal before, but my friends tell me that the chicken egg bowl is really really good. If you're ever around downtown area, YOU MUST TRY THIS PLACE!

I love the ramen at this place. Mainly only two ways to have it. One where they separate the soup & ramen & all the toppings one where they have everything in the soup.

One evening, we again could not figure out what to eat for dinner, and so my girl suggested this little ramen shop she has always wanted to try but never had the patience for. So off to Little tokyo we go, and after figuring out where to park, we head in to wait in line.  It being a thrusday night, i guess the line wasn't as long as it normally is, but we still waited atleast a good 45 minutes.   After a few confused minutes, we were seated at the counter watching the chefs cook.  Which was pretty cool. I got the japanese hot dogs as an appetizer, and the ramen.  she gets the gyoza, and the ramen. the hot dogs were good, the gyoza, meh. The ramen was good.  not exceptional but good.  the broth was tasty, the noodles cooked ok.  The chasu very japanesey.  The best part was the soft boiled egg. After reading the reviews, maybe the extra fatty broth will put it over into the really really god zone.  I think the ramen might deserve 4 stars.  but the overall experience and wait push it into the 3 star range for me.   Santouka i think is better overall.

After eating at Santa Ramen in SF I was really itching to see what Daikokuya was all about since generally people see it as the ramen shop every other shop is compared to. After almost 3 months I still can't remember how to spell "Daikokuya"...which is no reflection of how good the ramen is. Daikokuya had a line 3pm on a Friday. Me and my bud were trying to catch a late lunch and avoid the crowd but apparently we were either unlucky or this is normal. We ended up going later at night, put our names down on the list on the fire hazzard of a chair of theirs, and then walked around j-town for about an hour. The ramen was great. You can definitely taste a difference in the noodles between Santa Ramen and Daikokuya. Not saying one is better, just saying there is a difference. The broth was lighter than I expected even though I got the extra rich version on the suggestion of my friend. I thought the broth was awesome. The sliced pork was great and I'm a sucker for slightly runny hardboiled eggs. I totally dug the vibe of the place, felt like an authentic hole in the wall in Japan. Think of an old American Diner, but Japanized. I also liked the simplified menu for ramen, like an In-and-Out. Will definitely hit up this joint again next time I'm in town!

It's probably not necessary for me to write much to review this place.  If you like ramen, you are going to like it there.  You just have to be prepare for the loooooonnnng wait time.  Try going there before 5pm and you'll be okay.  The afternoon crew seems to know how to do seating better than the evening crew. I'll recommend the Daikoku ramen (of course), fried spicy tuna, and the fried rice. The gyoza was okay.  We didn't like the sliced roast pork.  The sauce they use is too overwelming.  It makes the dish taste like cheap Chinese food.

I think the long wait ruins my Daikokuya experiences. Last time I went during lunch time, the lady couldn't even give me an estimate of wait time. Maybe I need to tune up my taste buds but for the 1+ hr wait for ramen, Daikokuya isn't worth my time. In fact, I think the rice bowls are better than their signature ramen. Sorry to say but this place is overrated.

For the best ramen in town, I feel like this is the joint. So I gave it 5 stars. It doesn't have the best interior, or service (they came around once I believe), the wait is horrible (popularity comes with its price), but the food definitely makes up for it. The ramen here is pretty good, to be honest I don't dreaaaaam about it like others may do because I'm just not THAT big of a ramen fan. Despite that, I appreciate how good it tastes. The broth is quite flavorful, the pork is tender, the noodles are perfect. Even if I'm not in the mood for ramen, I love their chicken teriyaki here. Can't I find this at Yoshinoya you may be asking. The answer is No! The chicken teriyaki here has this miniscule crispy texture on the outside. It's a bit unique, but I like it, and the whole bowl is just so delicious. Expect a 30 minute wait. Good luck with parking. Drop off your friend to sign in as you search for parking. Bring coins for the meter. It's quite expensive in the Little Tokyo region.

Wonderful ramen, but the pork is what really makes this dish. If it's summer, be careful - it can be a raging, humid inferno inside these doors.  Regardless, it's worth the wait and the pain for some of the best ramen available in LA. Unless you have been here many times before, do yourself a favor and order the standard ramen.  It is by far the best, and most perfected dish on the menu.  The seasoned egg is delicious, the pork, amazing, and the broth is pretty impressive.  Although I wasn't overwhelmed by the noodles themselves, they were better than most hole-in-the-wall shops, and I can't really complain. So, if you are in the area and feel like ramen, get here early (there is line outside before they even open in the morning), and have a great bowl of soup.

Great ramen in a totally authentic atmosphere. You really feel like you're at some alley Ramen place in Tokyo. Not a lot of options to choose from, but that adds to the authenticity even more.

Ok, the ramen was good like all of the reviews have said.  BUT...it wasn't the BEST BEST BEST ramen around Los Angeles.  I've been here a number of times and the wait is absolutely ridiculous especially over the weekends.  The perfect party is 2-4...if you're planning to exceed that number you're looking at a wait time of 1 hour.  It's funny how there are a ton of ramen places in J-town but this one seems to be the most popular.   The soup in my opinion has to be the thing that drives people to come.  All other dishes on the menu isn't exactly what you'd expect.  Like the combination w/ pork chop cutlet.  It came out in a small bowl of rice with a few pieces of pork chop cutlet mixed with a fried egg.  It looked good when it came out but the pork chop was shoggy and gross.  You should just get the fried rice side to be on the safe side.  Everything else was what you'd expect from a ramen shop.  The SOUP makes all the difference.  If it wasn't for the long wait I'd come visit more often.  Cheers!

YUMMM. i crave daikokuya. Some of the best ramen and the best part about it is the pork soup base! Once you get seated with that steaming bowl of deliciousness in front of you, it is easier to forget about the wait. yes, ramen should, perhaps, not cost as much as it does HOWEVER. for the experience of awesome ramen its okay to splurge ! if you dont want their ramen then i highly recommend their donburi which is soo tasty :)

This is one of my favorite place to eat in LA!!!! I LOVE RAMEN But it doesn't get any better than Daikokuya!!! I've tried ramen joints all over but SERIOUSLY it cant get close to this place. You can't go wrong with the Pork Cutlet Bowl Combo. Parking is the only problem in Little Tokyo if you don't want to spend money in the lot BUT it's SOOOOOOOO worth it!

3.5 stars. Not the greatest ramen I've had, but very good nonetheless. The wait is horrendously long; I'd estimate an hour per party. Regardless of the wait, the staff work amazingly fast to crank out your order; I probably waited less than 8 minutes to see my order appear before my eyes. The ramen itself is very good. The broth is porky fatty warm-you-up goodness; shame I was unable to order kotteri style. Not to mention, the portions they give you are flabbergastingly ginormous. It's small enough for most people to be able to finish, but big enough to keep you bloated well into the night. For $8, I'd say that's a very good deal.

I haven't had tried too many japanese ramen places, simply because I'm korean and we tend to have a stash of ramen somewhere in the kitchen.. However, after a long day, my friends and I decided to get daiko ramen to "hit the spot"... It's usually really busy, but when we got there, there were barely any people and we only had to wait 5 minutes to get seated. We all conveniently ordered the same thing, and barely spoke as we slurped up the curly, not-overcooked noodles. Texture was perfect.... The broth is a little too fatty/greasy for me, but it was still good, even in the summer heat... Next time, i'm trying the shredded pork bowl.  :)

This is a great ramen place. The broth is tasy and the noodles do not have any weird flavors. That chasu is nice marbled with fat. But I found the egg to be the standout ingriedient. Other dishes that are good are the Tsu-Ke-Men which is everything seperated, requiring you to dip said ingriedients into a bowl of broth on the side. They also sear the slices of pork giving it more flavor. The potstickers are my goto appetizer, but other than that there isn't much worth ordering.

This is probably the best ramen place in LA so far. The broth tastes better than Shin Sen Gumi (not really the noodle) and they have more things in the bowl without the extra price. I give it 1 less star because of wait time. And the place is so so tiny. If you want to eat lunch on time, you better get here an hour or two earlier.

I've been wating to try out this place for two years but everytime, the wait was always a minimum of one hour and up to two hours depending on the numbers you have in your party.  The place is very small and so is the kitchen.  The limited kitchen and staff size could explain the reason they do not take TO GO orders so you have to wait in line to try out the famous ramen. I recommend avoiding going to this place with a large group as you'll wait FOREVER.  If you don't mind going solo or opt to sit at the bar, you'll save some time on the wait. The broth at Daikokuya is very flavorful, the fresh Ramen noodle thickness is between Udon and standard ramen, and what makes Daikokuya famous is definitely the pork which almost melts in your mouth.  The soup could be hotter coming out of the kitchen, but I wonder if they have it lukewarm on purpose so you can just eat it immediately and not wait for it to cool down, but that defeats the purpose of eating ramen. The other must try here is the crab fried rice.

I went to their other stores in Monterey Park and Hacienda Heights before but my friends keep asking me to come to this one because they said it tastes better. So... I went. We got there around 11PM on Saturday. There were about 20 parties in front of us. We waited about an hour before we were seated. They served the good pretty fast, probably within 2 minutes after we ordered. We got sliced pork, 2 ramen (one original and one "kotteri" style which is richer), and sliced pork rice. I think it's just too fattening overall. Especially for the kotteri soup, I wanted to throw up the second I took a sip of that soup. Don't get me wrong, the soup tastes good, it's just way too oily for me. Conclusion: Not worth the hour wait. You can get the same quality and atmosphere at the Monterey Park store.

Must not be my cup of... ramen. We waited just about an hour to get in.  And I ordered the Pork Rice Bowl and my wife got the Daikokuya Ramen.  Both were... meh. My rice bowl came with salad (good) and miso soup.  The miso soup came out cold, so that was a bad sign to start... I thought the noodles in the ramen were cooked perfectly.  The pork was a bit chewy and tough though.  The broth was good, but a wee bit flat for my taste.  And WAY TOO MUCH SLICED GREEN ONIONS.  They put about a half cup into the bowl.  I like green onions, but not so much where they mess up the balance of the dish and leave me with green onion breath!!  And the wife didn't care for the green onion breath at all... The Pork Rice Bowl was decent.  Again, way too much sliced green onions that messed up the balance of the dish.  They seemed to have skimped on the shredded pork a bit... or maybe it was so shredded and integrated that you really couldn't see or taste much of it.   All in all, a place I'd visit again if I was in the area.  But NOT if I had to wait another hour to get in.  There are better ramen places in LA that I feel deserve an hour wait to get in.

Our wait was only about half an hour for a group of four. We were promptly seated and given menus. I ordered the house specialty, and split it with my sister. The broth is really flavorful, noodles cooked al dente and the portions are amazing for the price ($8.50 or so). My only complaint is that they should put more meat in the ramen, as I only had a slice of the fatty pork. My husband had the dry version and enjoyed it as well. We drove by later that night and there were still lines of people outside!

Parking $10, Wait 1.5hrs, Price for 2 Ramen+lil rice bowls & 1 small beer+tip= $35, the drive to downtown LA = always horrible. Broth isn't as good as Hakata (watered down), serving's bigger but it costs more. Zero customization. Friendly, efficient staff, mariachi blasts in the back kitchen. LA is almost always overhyped. If you really want to experience Daikokuya, I suggest you try one of their other branches.

Arrived about 10 minutes after opening and still the wait was about 20 minutes. Would not have waited any longer. The ramen was good but not great. Noodles were well done, not al-dente, but not over cooked. There was alot of menma, maybe too many scallions on top, egg was cooked just right, slightly firmer than soft boiled. Broth was cloudy and rich but not too flavourful, so it just seemed heavy. Tuna sashimi bowl was served with large slices over a mound of rice. It was fresh and good with the seaweed in the rice. Salad that came with the bowl was overpowered by the mayonnaise dressing- very heavy. Service was fast, courteous, efficient. By the time we left, the people waiting were spilled out across the cars parked on the street out front. Wonder if there were any repeat customers because surely no one would wait if they'd already tried the ramen. The area is surrounded by other restaurants, all busy, though none seemed to have a queue.

Serious yummy-ness. Went to LA for a trip with some friends and boy was I happy they did their research! * Soup was AMAZING! * Ramen was just right with just enough goodies that came with * Went before the dinner rush and didn't have to wait long * My friend went all out and had the KOTTERI flavor ("a richer soup extracted from back fat") = SUPER flavorful, but very dangerous.   Would I go back? = most definitely...I wish they have one in NorCal!

Rating it on the food and value, this place is excellent.  The house specialty Daikokuya ramen was excellent.  Combo'd up with the fried rice, it was more than filling.  The ramen itself would be a very satisfying dinner. The wait is probably the most frustrating thing about this place.  1hr+ for a party of 7.  They weren't really equipped to handle more than 6 per table, had to pull out one of the booths and add a chair on the inside.  Also, if you sit by the door on a colder day, it gets chilly. The food makes up for the wait time, though.  And once you're seated, the service was quick, and we were in and out in under 40min.   Would definitely recommend and visit again!

The only reason I like this place of the memories shared with friends here. The gyoza and tonkatsu is pretty good. Better than the ramen I think. Maybe I'm just not a big fan of ramen, I'm way more of a pho kinda person. After waited 40 mins to an hour, you order, you get your food, you're eating it, not long after they think its time for you to leave, so they quietly place the bill on your table, so you can quickly pay them and get your ass outta their restaurant. Not sure if they still do the suggested tip amount printed on the receipt, but check out BP's review of this place, very informative!

I think my wait was just under an hour. This place is small, not recommended for large groups. Otherwise you might as well call in and rent the place for an hour or so. Even the booths fit no more than 4, regular size people. I'd say always call ahead, i wish they would let you call and put your name down for a reservation, but oh well. It's worth the wait, especially when its cold outside.

I went to go and try this place after hearing about the much-talked hype - the long waiting times, the much acclaimed authentic taste of the ramen.  We got to the place around 550 and there were only two parties ahead of us - which equated to about 10-15 minutes of waiting time. We were elated and were grateful not to be experiencing the wait times that were discussed a lot of times here on Yelp :) Tip: call the restaurant before heading out or if you're on the way to find out what the current wait times are to decide if you're still going to eat there or head someplace else if you cannot wait to eat. The reasons for the 3-star rating is that in terms of ramen in Los Angeles, I would say this is the best I have tasted. However, speaking of how original and exotic the flavor is to me, I have tasted something like this before (not in japan) and so therefore, I would not be willing to wait more than 30 minutes for a table or would rave about and crave it. And by original, I mean how new the taste or how unique the taste is to me, and not how i think how authentic it is (since i am not japanese nor have i experienced ramen extensively in japan). To its credit, the broth is very flavorful and not "porky", if you know what I mean. The egg is very delicious and the noodles cooked al dente. You can opt to add your own flavor to the soup by adding raw garlic paste, pickled ginger, soy sauce or red pepper, all of which are available on your table.  The pork slices in the soup are so tender and I really appreciate the flavor that came from it.  By the way, i had the Daikoku ramen. We also had the sliced pork and gyoza for appetizers, and while I give it passing marks, they would not necessarily push me to go back to this place instantly. To any Filipinos wanting to eat at this place, if it helps at all, the whole thing tastes like mami. :) i'm sure you will understand my rating if I explained it this way. Will be trying orochon next to compare to this place :)

Forgot to review this place but remembered as soon as I took another visit yesterday. One of the best ramen places in LA. The wait is always excruciatingly long but once you get a taste of those noodles and broth, you will feel gratified. I'm not a good enough ramen aficionado to tell if this is truly the best place to get ramen in LA. But my friends and I always choose to go to this place when we think of ramen. My advice: Get there expecting to wait an hour and get the combo.

The broth is creamy but not overly fatty.  It isn't the most well-decorated bowl of ramen, but as long as it taste good right?   One thing I didn't like about the place is that it feels a little dirty, but I guess that gives it a more traditional/authentic feel to it?

I had my ramen with the Koterri enhanced broth and feel it made a huge difference. I did not enjoy waiting over an hour in the rain to get a seat, then felt pressure to eat and run. The variety of the menu leaves more to be desired, but the things they have on the menu are done well. I've had a lot of ramen in Japan, and this place takes me back. The surprise of the meal? The little cabbage salad they give you.. very good.

Daikokuya is a great authentic ramen place located in LA, Japan Town. When you arrive, make sure to sign in because it takes a while for you to get seated. My friend took me here for lunch one day and it served some of the best ramen I've ever had. I ordered the regular ramen bowl.  I liked the texture of the noodles because they aren't too soft or too hard, aldente is what I prefer.  The egg in the middle was my favorite part and I saved it at the end to enjoy. The portions are good; they serve the ramen in large bowls the size of your face. The pluses: good quality food, reasonable prices, authentic, comfortable atmosphere, good customer service. The minuses: long line that goes out the door on most occasions, long time waiting, small space, not much street parking. Overall I enjoyed my experience at this place and I would go again the next time I'm craving ramen in LA.

1st and only place I've ever had RAMEN! Let's just say AMAZING!!! If you're lucky you might catch a down time, which is almost like winning the lotto, cause this place is ALWAYS packed. But it's definitely worth the wait. They have 1/2 size portion Ramen thats not on the menu, but I think is a great size if you want to try their Gyoza or Spicy Tuna Rolls. If you've never had it, it's worth the wait and the visit!

Been to Daiko a few times, and it gets the #2 spot on my ramen list. Ramen is great, the fried rice is excellent, shredded pork bowl is also good eating, and the gyoza's are not too bad either. The service and staff are always good, just expect it to be crowded, and expect a wait, although i have been lucky we have only had to wait like 10-15 min each time we went there.  If you're waiting, just walk around the area, lots a shops and other things, or grab some Imagawayaki's across the street, those are good eats too!

The best Ramen I have ever had.  Originally, the first time I had ramen from a ramen place, I wasn't too excited.  Why would I pay $10-$12 for something that could take me 50 cents and 3 minutes to make??  Its the broth.  Daikokuya makes amazing broth. It's flavorful and just combines perfectly with the noodles and the pork.  I love the hard boiled egg that comes with it. Their gyoza is awesome.  Covered with green onions, these partially open fried mixture of meat and vegetables are little pieces of joy.  There is quite a long wait, but it lives up to its hype.  In my book it is well worth the wait. Just to reiterate, the best ramen ever.

Ugh, I don't like that comment that's to the right of 5 stars when you rate the place, because of course Daikokuya isn't as good as it gets! The Japanese's seriousness about cooking rivals the French, how could a foreign eatery even compare to the domestic product! But if you're talking Japanese Ramen in Little Tokyo Los Angeles, then I speak truth. So to make clear, there is a regional qualifier amidst another region. I hear there's a killer place beyond a stone's throw away, but my eyes have yet to be opened to such glory.   If you want a recommendation, I recommend casting lots and eating what chaos would will. It's like swimming for shore in a duck pond. No missing. No failing.

Went here early around 11:45am wrote our names down and waited about 15-20 minutes. We had the ramen and a side of the fried rice. Both were delicious. I was a little skeptical about the egg in the soup but it was actually good. The ramen was very filling. I could only eat like half the bowl and I could see that some of the girls were finishing a whole bowl! Next time I will order the "half" portion. The waiter was very attentive. I advise to go here before noon unless you want to be waiting forever. The place is small so there is not that much seating. The environment was very inviting and there is metered parking on the side of the street. Definitely a great place to enjoy some delicious ramen on a cold day. The price wasn't bad at all, only about $8.50 for a big bowl and you can also order the "fatterier" one with more of the juices for a little more :)

Been to Japan, had ramen there. Been to Daikokuya in downtown LA, just as good! Ignore the health score if you want to know what real Japanese ramen tastes like. There is apparently always a line, just go in off hours. We were there on a Thursday around 5:30pm and only waited maybe 20 min. Had the bento box, fantastic (included a perfect California roll and tempura). Friends had ramen with pork and a shredded pork bowl. We all shared, and we were all in food love. Oh, and they have Chu-Hi! If you haven't had one of these tasty malt liquor beverages, and you're over 21, you should try one!

The ramen here is amazing! The soup is incredibly flavorful (though I'd prefer less green onion). Sure the wait could be atrocious, but I think it's definitely worth it. I typically go for a late lunch and am so stuffed that I'm not hungry come dinnertime. I've ordered the standard bowl of ramen or ramen + sashimi combo. I wasn't expecting the sashimi to be very good but I was pleasantly surprised. I noticed there's not much of a wait if you go in the late afternoon on weekdays. Also, the food at this location is noticeably better than the one in Monterey Park.

Where do you go for the best food in California?  Los Angeles. Where do you go for the bestJapanese food in Los Angeles?  Little Tokyo. Where do you go for the best ramen in Little Tokyo?  Daikokuya. If...  then...  DAIKOKUYA IS THE BEST RAMEN IN CALIFORNIA. There, I said it. I've been to "good" (ie 3-5  stars on Yelp) ramen in NorCal and they're nothing compared to even the fast-food-esque places like Ajisen ramen. And Daikokuya -- THIS location -- blows them all out of the water. [=THE 411=] If you're here at any normal time to eat, you'll end up waiting 20 minutes to 1.5 hours.  It's worth it -- believe me.  But if you can, come here before 6.  Even after 9 it can still be busy -- even on weekdays.  Also try to come in a maximum of 5 people; they have 6-7 tables for that amount of people, and if you have more they'll potentially seat you separately.  But if you're in a couple, you can sit at the bar. [=SERVICE/AMBIANCE=] It's funny when you walk in because you see a bunch of vintage posters, action figures, masks, magazines, etc.  There's a small waiting area, but I like to wait outside since it can get a little stuffy with all the cooking going on. Their service is pretty typical.  It's not as emphasized as Shinsengumi (what with their yelling/announcing/etc.), but  they'll refill your water/tea on time and are Japanese-level polite. [=THE RAMEN... and other foods=] AMAZING.  I don't know what else to say.  The broth is just perfect, and extra flavorful if you get the extra "fat."  I know, it sounds gross, but it makes SUCH a difference.  I try to eat the bean sprouts and other vegetables first though, because it can change the flavor of the soup. The pork just MELTS in your mouth.  Probably the best pork I've tried in a ramen, too.  They also LOVE their hard-boiled egg; it's cooked overnight and goes perfectly well with the ramen. If I'm really hungry, I'll order a combo and eat it myself...  but I end up really, really full.  But I think you can share the combo portion with a partner if they order a ramen and it'll be juuuust perfect.  I like the eel,  personally, but if that's not your thing, you can get something else -- I'd recommend the pork too. Honestly, I haven't tried their other noodle dishes -- tsukemen, for instance...  but I just can't let myself do it.  The ramen is just TOO GOOD. [=THE VERDICT=] Ugh, if you can't tell by now...  I dunno what to say.  I'll come here anytime I want the best ramen.  It's a far drive and parking can be a beez (there's a $4 place in one of the malls), but so worth it.  In fact -- I've tried the other locations... not NEARLY as good. My theory is that the grills retain the years of cooking flavor.  Gross to think about it, but oh well.

You cannot live a full life without having a bowl of ramen from this place. If you're not particularly fond of very hot (temperature) soup, and I am not, I order it as the variant where all the ingredients are on a plate, and there is a bowl of broth for you to dip and sip from. If you want stronger broth, ask for it "kotteri" style.

This place is by far one of my favorites spots to eat in L.A. during the winter. Nothing like a warm ass Ramen soup Kotteri style from this place with a tall ASAHI on the side. Utter deliciousness. Lets not forget that they have some of the best fried rice i have ever tasted, filled with pork, corn and crab meat. The soup is like a swamp of deliciousness with hidden surprises found throughout the bowl, including one of Dave Chappelle's Dinosaur eggs.  I like to eat the side "slaw" with extra sauce , and dip my noodles and pork in the left over sauce for a unique creamy taste. The only negative is finding parking and waiting atleast an hour most of the time. I recommend signing in, and then taking a walk around Little Tokyo. Check out a museum or go shopping with your female you impatient ass foo!

A friend and I decided to try out this place after wandering around Little Tokyo. We put our name down and decided we could afford a little more wandering before we got called. The wait ended up being about an hour but it was totally worth it. We ordered the gyoza to start, and decided to share one ramen and shredded pork bowl combination. The gyoza was different from other gyoza, I believe they use some sort of wanton wrapper instead of the traditional gyoza wrapper. It wasn't in the traditional gyoza shape but instead just rectangular. But that's okay, it was all in the flavor, and the thin wrappers were fried to perfection so they were partly crunchy and partly soft. When the ramen came i was surprised at the sheer size of it. It was a huge bowl and my friend and I were glad we decided to share. The ramen was tender, and the broth was rich. There was a generous serving of pork, bamboo shoots and sprouts along with a soft boiled egg in the bowl and all together they create something amazing. The shredded pork bowl was a half size because it was part of the combination deal but it was just enough. There's a lot of fatty meat but it wasn't disgusting because it was grilled so the top layer was crunchy and caramelized and delicious when mixed with the rice and pickled ginger. The price was really good at just under 12 for the combo. The service was really good too, even though it was busy they were very attentive and were really quick about refilling our waters. And when we left my friend forgot her book there and one of the waitresses chased us half a block to return it to her.

broth is good, but i just don't understand why there's always an hour long wait. the noodles should be ordered firm if you really like it al dente. the egg is soft-cooked, but cold inside... why? bamboo tastes quite pickled. not digging the sprouts in the soup either. with so many better choices in la, i can't manage but give more than 3 stars. sorry!

First meal in Socal, my friends and I venture to Daikokuya in which one of my friends have heard great reviews of. I'm not the biggest fan of ramen, yet I wouldn't turn down ramen if that option was thrown out. We got there around 7ish and we waited till around almost 9 for a table at the counter. Thankfully there was a lot to explore in the area or else I think I would've died of either hunger or bordem. One thing I found rather unique about this ramen place was that they only had one type of ramen. I personally found that a little weird for as all the other ramen places I've been to had many different options to chose from. I ended up settling for a combo set of the Daikokuya ramen set with the Tuna Sashimi bowl. One thing I really liked about sitting at the counter was that I was able to barely see them make my ramen. My ramen arrived around 5-7 minutes later and the first thing I noticed was the large bowl and abundance of soup. Overall, I thought the ramen was okay. The noodles were perfectly cooked but the broth was a bit lacking in flavor for me. I thought the portion of broth vs. noodles was unbalanced for there was way more broth than noodles, causing me to fish for noodles near the end. The combo side was decent but my friends that ordered the pork katsu were deeply let down. My friends informed me that the bowl tasted as if they had reheated it in a microwave and that the pork was dry and tough. The combo was an additional $3 but we (mainly my friends) felt as though it wasn't worth it for the side wasn't good at all. I give Daikokuya 3 stars because I've really tasted better. Daikokuya does serve good ramen but ever since I've had Orenchi's (Norcal, Silicon Valley) nothing can compare. As I told my friends, probably the biggest let down of Daikokuya's ramen would be the egg. They are far from the perfect soft boiled egg and I think only Orenchi's have perfected that egg. I don't think it was well worth the almost 2 hour wait but if you want a decent ramen meal, then I wouldn't mind coming here but if the wait was as long as I waited, I think I would pass for my interest in ramen will still lean towards Orenchi's.

i don't have to tell you how amazing this place is, just walk in and look at your wait time. on average, you'll wait at least 30 mins, and it does not matter what time of the day you go. if you have guests in town this is a must eat location!! the broth is so buttery and full of umami flavor. and the ramen noodles have the perfect bite and chewiness to them. the ramen is topped with slices of tender pork belly, bamboo shoots, a boiled egg, bean sprouts, and green onions. And if you feel that the broth is a bit to heavy you can put some pickled ginger as well as the garlic puree, both which you can find at the table along side the chopsticks. I personally love to load up on the ginger and garlic! I love garlic. if you're wait is too long, I have the perfect solution. there is a bar called far bar, right next door. I love to grab a couple of drinks in their outdoor patio and wait while our seats are called, just be sure to check in now and then to see how far along you are till they call your seat number.

This has got to be one of the best ramen places in the greater los angeles area, save for Shin Sen Gumi (my personal fav), but amazing none the less. I frequent the little tokyo area of los angeles at least once a month and I always find myself dining at this establishment. The wait time can be on the long side, especially on fri and sat nights, but the wait is always well worth it. On to the food. The ramen is always cooked to perfection and theirs something about the broth that is so addicting. I usually get the chashu pork ramen and it's always so damn tender and filling. Come check this gem out!

this place IS THE BEST ramen place i've ever been to! I love almost everything about the place! the decorations are a mix between traditional japanese imagery, along with alot of OLD SCHOOL signs straight from japan. And when i say oldschool, i mean that these were signs that my ex's parents (who are japanese) said they only saw as children growing up in japan! how ganster is that?!?!? Anyways, the ramen is incredibly great! And the best thing is that it's FILLING! i can actually walk away from a noodle place and feel satisfied from just eating ramen. But they dont just serve ramen, they also have the BEST GYOWZA that i've ever tried! This is the first place i think of eating at whenver i'm in J-town if i want ramen. The only complaint i have is tha the place is so small, and its always packed! Their's always a wait list that you have to sign up for... but i guess you have to wait for great food like that. Service seems fine everytime i go, so thats never an issue. if you've never been to this place and love ramen, you're missing out! I would say... go try it! but at the same time i dont want the wait list to be even longer than usual. lol, just kidding :)

Daikokuya literally means "big black house" if I have it right.  The wait was borderline ridiculous, but the ramen was very satisfying once we got to the counter. A "small" Ki-Rin is $2.50, but a "large" Ki-Rin is $11.00 according to the menu.  What the hell?  Is a "large" the size of a keg?  The beer complemented the ramen very well.

I had jury duty at one of the courthouses downtown. For my lunch break, I briskly walked about 5 or 6 blocks to this place. I'd only been here once before, and it was the last time I had jury duty. I could have taken the LADOT DASH bus, but I didn't know which line to take. Thank you LA for making public transportation so easy. I walked in. It wasn't too crowded. Table for one please, the hostess sat me at the counter/bar (Which is it?). I sat right in front of the stove, where the tattooed japanese gentleman was making fried rice. He gets really violent with it. His other friend was in charge of boiling the ramen with the help of a timer, as not to overcook the noodles I figure. I ordered the Daikoku Ramen. It was good. It wasn't mind blowing however. I'm not a ramen junkie to begin with. The soup was good. Kind of greasy I thought. The ramen was not soggy. I guess the timer method works well. I slurped up the noodles. I saw this in a movie. I believe it was "Tampopo." I thought I was being authentic, but then I noticed nobody else was slurping. Whatever, I have no shame. I honestly thought the best part of the dish was the egg. It had an unfamiliar taste to it, slightly sweet which was pleasantly surprising. As I was eating, I saw them refill the big pot of soup. Then the tattooed japanese gentleman did something that was odd, but on second thought wasn't surprising. He took out two milk jug looking things, and poured the contents into the pot. The liquid that came out was pure white. I had no idea what it was. Maybe milk, maybe cream, maybe non-dairy creamer, or possibly soy milk? Not surprising because I hear the sulungtang places do the exact same thing to make their soups whiter and more rich. I like that their cups for water are big plastic tumblers. I still couldn't figure out which DASH bus to take. So I walked back to jury duty.

Probably my favorite restaurant in Little Tokyo. The line is usually pretty insane (which is generally a turn-off for me -- I just want my damn food without having to hang around doing nothing for an hour), and in this case it's a good indication of what you can expect to get. The beer is cheap ($3.50 Sapporo, 2.50 Kirin draft), the ramen is pretty good, but it's the fried rice that's really special. I've eaten a lot of fried rice at a lot of different Asian restaurants in the area, and none of them even remotely comares to this place. If you sit at the counter, you can see the cooks making it for you, too. The place is kind of loud and crowded, making me want to leave before I've been there for too long, but the food definitely makes it worth it.

I am no connoisuer of ramen by any means but I've never had ramen anywhere else that has tasted this good. Every time I go, I end up finishing the entire bowl save for some broth; I think that's quite a feat for a petite Asian girl. Do expect a wait though. It can get pretty ridiculous on nights and weekends, but it's worth the wait in my opinion. Oh and be attentive when they call out your name. It can be easy to miss as they're not always loud enough to hear...and don't be like my friend and I when we missed our name like three times in a row then ended up having to leave because a friend of hers needed her AAA. That was a sad, sad night. :[

Get the house special and you will be very happy! If you can, go around 2 - 3 pm on a weekday and there shouldn't be much of a wait.

Many friends of mine recommended me about this restaurant.  And I went there to eat ramen with high expectation.  However, taste of ramen is not really good as my friends said (I know it is cremy taste but this ramen lack something).  Rather, Rice dishes (Don-mono, in this time I ordered teriyaki rice) are out do the taste of ramen. The other day, I went to this restaurant with my co-worker who also heard that ramen from this restaurant is good (He is also Japanese).  With two people, I thought I can confirm the quality of this ramen and last visit from other day is just my illusion.  But no...  my co-worker also draw the same conclusion as me. Since there is other better Japanese ramen restaurant in OC and even in near this area, I probably won't go to this restuarant...

Sweet and sour JESUS, this place is amazing...enough so to completely warrant the considerable wait times during peak hours.   For those trying this restaurant out for the first time, I strongly recommend the ramen/fried rice combo...if there is such a thing as a gastronomical handjob, this is it. And if you're feeling particularly indulgent, try the ramen kotteri style (with broth made from black pork back fat)...it may wreak complete havoc on your circulatory system, but it's SO worth it.

Daikokuya reminds me of the tiny ramen-ya in Japan, minus the vending machine that despenses your meal ticket and the very orderly line that stands alongside it waiting for a spot at the counter. Here you sign your name on a clipboard and mill around outside till your name's called. My wife usually tries to get us to go a few shops down to Mr. Ramen, to avoid the wait, but the two just don't compare.   My wife likes the little extras that you can add on at Mr. Ramen (mostly she likes a crap ton of bean sprouts and tofu). Daikokuya's ramen, though needs no additions. Glistening jewels of pork fat, tender cuts of kurobuta (black pig), noodles served the way you want (just ask), and a savory shoyu/tonkatsu broth. There are some other things on the menu that are good, but go for the ramen. Other than the food, the waitstaff is very friendly and the décor of old Japanese signs and movie posters is nice. It seems that most Yelpers know what's up, but if you think ramen only comes from little instant packages in your cupboard, come here to taste how this Japanese staple should be prepared... oh yeah, and watch Tampopo.

Since I discovered this place I've made a stop here on every trip to LA.  Every time I have the ramen there, it makes me think all that other ramen out there is really equivalent to that dehydrated abomination you get in the supermarket (but which I admit, I do still eat ...). It can be quite a wait, and they will violate their rule that only complete groups will be seated all the time (making the wait time even longer), but if that's not something that ruins the experience for you, than you're in for a tasty end.  For now, it remains a necessary stop on all my LA itineraries!

After walking by for months in Little Tokyo and watching this huge line snake out of the place, I decided to come give it a try with a friend. We came around dinner time on a lazy Sunday afternoon. The wait time was about 30 mins, but we were determined to get in and check it out. Service was very friendly and helpful. I can't say I'm a ramen conosieur ,but I do have a few bowls under my belt. We had the combos with Daikoku Ramen and pork fried rice. Maybe it was because I waited so long and had seen so many people come in that I was expecting something more from the ramen. It was good, but definitely not the best I've ever had. The broth could have been more flavorful, but the noodles definitely were very nice :) The pork fried rice, DAMN!!! AMAZING!! If anything, I was sold on Daikokuya with the rice. I don't know what they did to it, but just, wow: texture, flavor, everything was just amazing. I suggest everyone check it out just to see what it's all about for themselves. In my ventures into Little Tokyo, I've noticed that early afternoon, around 1-3 is probably the best time to go because there doesn't seem to be many people waiting.

But, i must give credit where credit is due, Daikokuya is quite delicious. The gyoza gould be better though, it tastes like microwave potstickers, I like them nice and crispy on the outside.

I'm not a big fan of ramen, but oh hot damn, Daikokuya has to be the best ramen I've ever had. The broth is extremely rich in flavor-- from your first bite to your last. The egg is perfectly cooked and the pork, ohhhh the pork. I don't know how they do it-- though there's a description in the menu-- but it is always tender and juicy. I've also tried the shredded pork and teriyaki eel rice bowls-- and they are amazing as well! You can also order your ramen with the richer kotteri flavor. My friend Justin said that it made his broth a bit too salty, but I honestly couldn't distinguish between whether or not the broth had the kotteri added. So if you're trying to cut down on calories, don't worry-- it doesn't seem to make a difference. As for the service, it's amazing! Though I have never been able to sit at a booth and have always been seated at the bar (yes, it's always that packed!), the waitresses always refilled our glasses of water without us having to ask for it. The only reason I'm not giving this Daikokuya 5 stars is because I think it could be expanded as the bathroom/backroom area is huge, and the line is always a bit too long. However, I guess that's the price you have to pay for good food!

Why not let my first review, be one of favorite places?  Alas, I am one of 988 reviews so I'll keep it short and sweet.   My friend Hiroshi, aka, the Food Hiro, turned me on to Daikokuya a few months ago and I've been back oh about 100 times since then. I can never get sick of their ramen and I order the same one.  It is nothing like I've ever had before.  In Hawaii, we call it saimin, and I settle for Zippy's won tun min but the ramen at Daikokuya is special and authentic.  The distinctive pork broth, noodles and enhancements of pork, green onions and hard boiled egg, all sing together in your mouth.  It's magic and it's all I need. A bowl of hot ramen from Daikokuya cures everything, broken heart, Daikokuya ramen, hangover, Daikokuya ramen, just got laid off from work, Daikokuya ramen.   Whatever troubles you, don't sweat it, just take yourself to little Tokyo, put your name on the list, and get ready to turn that frown upside down b/c this my friends, is a big bowl of happiness!

Daikokuya is by far one of my favorite favorite places to eat hands down.  Nothing special about this little hole in the wall looks wise but the food is AMAZING!  For one, I am not a ramen or soup fan but their ramen is so good I could have it anytime.  The delicious pork broth base for the soup is prepared a day in advance and I must say I've had the pleasure to watch them start it up using EXTREMELY fresh looking pieces of pork amongst other ingredients.  The eel & shredded pork bowls I could seriously have as my last meal on earth and die a happy man.  Though they don't really serve up much in terms of sushi their spicy tuna roll is is so fresh tasting, it's simply delicious.   I must say this is not a place to bring your vegetarian friends, as there is NOTHING for them here.  Service is fast & friendly and always on point.  My only issue with Daikokuya is the long wait, any day of the week, especially weekends.  On a hot day, its definitely easier to get in there as there is no AC but If you can make it there on a Monday-Friday before 6:30pm, you are pretty much guaranteed a table upon walking in- which is unheard of after 7pm. DAIKOKUYA- PLEASE OPEN UP A BIGGER RESTAURANT!  I know you guys make enough money to be able to do this.  Put one in Silverlake and you'll make a freakin' fortune!  The one they recently opened up in Montery Park is tinier than the one in Little Tokyo, so if you were thinking of going there to avoid the long wait, think again.

I've been coming to this restaurant for like 3 years. Everytime I come there it never dissapoints me. Even when I bring new people they always ended up loving it. The appetizers are delicious, especially the pork slice one. The ramen is always awesome. I always request my ramen with the kokteri seasoning to make my ramen a bit saltier. I get the ramen and pork cutlet bowl combo. Mmmm..... The environment is chill! You can drink and stay as long as you want. The service is quick. The downside is that they do not allow reservations. But, the wait is worth it. Also, they need bigger place and tables.

I only go to Daikokuya because it's the closest ramen shop nearby. The ramen is decent. Broth is okay and the noodles are thick and chewy. The place is small and kind of dirty. Ramen in nature is a quick eat and being stared at by the crowd waiting outside, you want to just eat and leave quickly. After being there a few times with my friends, I still think it's just an a ok..

The wait might be a little tedious, but the food is worth it! The Gyoza, the "Kotteri" flavored Ramen, and the Shredded Pork Bowl are a must.  While you're waiting you might want to go talk a nice walk around little Tokyo, but make sure you make it back in time before they call your name and number.  Other than that The place is great.

Daikokuya is a gem.  Very busy, very quick, very very delicious.  The prices are great and very fair, and the portions will leave you feeling satisfied.  You'll spend around $14.00.  Located in Downtown LA, this is the perfect place for lunch, or a quick dinner/night snack.  Or a great place to stop before or after Dodger games!!! The ramen is where it is at!!  The broth is amazing, and is enhanced by adding minced garlic, if you choose...  There are combination sets you can choose from, and they are the best deals.  Enjoy, this place is a treat!!!

Yummy Ramen! I had tukemen; your ramen and soup comes separately and its was PERFECT for summer. :D If you are in a mood for rich flavor and thick noodles then this is the place to have your ramen. Its very old fashion japanese style ramen place that I would see in Japan.  Its not clean and cute but it has a good cozy feel to it. I would recommend it to young kids who like their ramen to be thick and rich.  For your health.... I don't think its good cuz its very salty. lol I don't recommend to ppl who like their ramen on little less salty.  I guess it all depends on your taste but if you like simple ramen and less oily then Hakata ramen at shinsengumi is delish too!

I am hopelessly addicted to Daikokuya.  It can be 100+ degrees outside and I still crave a steaming bowl of kurobuta pork ramen!  Get there when they open for lunch and beat the crowds. I always order the ramen + fried rice combo, and share an order of gyoza with my sis.  A can of Japanese soda (Calpico) rounds out a perfect meal.  Don't be afraid to add a heaping scoop of garlic paste (find the condiments on your table) to your broth -- it intensifies the already rich flavor of the pork broth. It's worth every last calorie.  And the inevitable ramen smell that will haunt you for hours.  I promise.

My best friend introduced this place to me a few years back and I've been hooked ever since. I don't know what they put on their gyoza, but it is damn good! The "Daikoku" ramen is amazing, with melt-in-your-mouth pork. I seriously drool thinking about that pork. The only downside to this place has nothing to do with the food: -parking...well it IS downtown LA so either be ready to trek or to pay up the @$$ for parking -the wait...not always terribly long, but on a few occasions i've waited around 30-45minutes -cleanliness...on a few occasions, after being seated, i've leaned on the table only to find my elbow in sticky soysauce residue. -_- but the food alone makes me trek out to downtown la, scour for parking, and down an entire bowl of ramen, along with some oh-so-delicious gyoza

The '-1 star' is only for the wait.  Overall: Incredible.  I wish I could make their damn noodle soups of pork my ringtone.  B E S T E S T besty bester than bestest soup Ive ever had.  The only downside is the wait both pre and during meal.  Pre-meal cuz the wait is pretty long and it sucks because you're in the "desperation zone" with the rest of the poor saps waiting.  Then while you're eating, the "desperation zone" just glowers at you the whole time.  It's nothing unbearable though or hard to live with because the wait is soooo worth it. Start off with Gioza or Links, then the little bowl of cabbage salad, and finally, the Ramen bowl + Pork fried Rice combo is the way to go.  Large Asahi don't hurt. The egg in the soup is Aaight. I recommend this restaurant to every1.

So now I know what all the hype was about.  Such a great little ramen place! Every time I drive by, there's a line outside, so the wait was expected but well worth it. Went on the weekend before noon, wait was only about 20-30 minutes. The ramen here is on point, pork broth very tasty.  I would rather have the egg mixed with the dish, not a fan of the boiled egg, but I don't mind it.  I ALWAYS want a little taste of everything, so I got the combo:  small shredded cabbage salad, ramen, and small chicken egg bowl.  Pure awesomeness! Service is okay, food comes out pretty fast.  Try going in a small group... it's a small ramen house.  It's Little Tokyo so there's street parking or garage parking across the street.  Oh and there are no to-go orders taken at this location.

I was so excited for this place after reading all the reviews, driving in traffic for an hour, and waiting in line for an hour. But I was very disappointed with the bowl. I usually say the noodles can single handedly make or break the bowl. The noodles were alright, they were fairly chewy... but the broth was so bland. There was just a huge lack of flavor. I couldn't taste the shoyu, the pork stalk was weak, especially after that fancy description of the daikokuya broth and the day long process to make it in this secret location away from the restaurant. Maybe it's just me and I don't like that kotteri milky broth. But I do like shoyu, and tonkotsu. Hype is the way of LA, built on media and advertisement for its means to sell a product. The gyoza could have been really good, but it was just real good. The presentation was so nice, but there was one too many flaps of skin and not enough meat. However, the gyoza skin was very chewy, which was nice. But when bringing it all to the basics of judging a restaurant, you can look at the crowd. It says it all. Crowded just means popular, not great food. This place it popular. I loved the feel of a ramenya. However, when you look at the crowd itself you see the people eating there (at least on the day I went) was roughly (subject to reporter bias) 10 percent Japanese, 30 percent korean, and the rest some kind of causasian. It's the easiest and most full proof way to tell it an ethnic restaurant is authentic. hah the word ethnic is somewhere in authentic..

Absolutely love this freaking place.  I can't stress enough how good their ramen is and for someone who has even tried many different kinds of ramen while in Japan, this is still the best you can get here in the States.  For $8.50, the portion of the ramen is just huge and the toppings just make it all the better.  The boiled egg is always perfect and cooked just to where the yolk is still soft and not rock hard.   The chashu pork is so tender that you don't even need to chew it.  I have to admit I haven't really tried anything else on the menu, however the only reason I come to this place is for the Daikokuya ramen.  The only downside is that it is in Little Tokyo in downtown LA, so with that said you know parking is always a hassle and to top it off this place is always PACKED.  Every time I go there is always at least an hour wait, but trust me, it is well worth the wait. Lastly, this place is very small so if you have groups of 4 or less then you're good.  However anymore people and you're better off going somewhere else or choose to eat in smaller groups as the tables open up.

I think I need to be careful how I rate this place.... Is the ramen at daikokuya any good?  Yah, its good. Is the ramen omg good "No!". It's definitely not worth waiting   1 hour+ for a 20min quick bite Downtown location means expensive  parking and white people like to eat slow and grind the rotation. The tradition of the eat and leave concept has not cought on here.

What can I say besides the lore is true. This place is the best Ramen around. Wait times can be long so plan accordingly but if you get your name on the list and stroll around Japan-town while you wait, it's so worth it. Just don't sign up while you're starving. I normally get in after about 20 minutes, maybe slightly more. This doesn't bug me though because I expect the wait and plan for it. Otherwise I'd be bugged like some other reviewers. The wait is the only drawback but even so, I have to give it 5 stars! I normally order Ramen with a side bowl of rice and unagi (eel). Love it! Oh ya and also for the amount of food you get, I always take it home and make another meal out of it. Reasonable prices too!

What else can I say that already hasn't been said.  Great ramen place.  If you're up for it get a combination ramen with a fantastic side.  I had the Tuna and it was well worth it. Make reservations so you don't have to wait.  I was forced to sit on a stool crammed against a wall, even with reservations, which was a source of annoyance while eating.

I've been here twice and the food has been good, but inconsistent. The first time, I had the Kichimen, which is tsukemen, but with that spicy flavor. It was incredible. Second, time I tried the regular tsukemen, and it was less than thrilling, especially after getting back from Japan. It was decent, but the flavor was not as rich and satisfying. I recommend getting the extra flavoring, then asking for some hot water if it's too salty. The service was actually the best thing about this place. Although the wait is sucky, even at 11 am, the staff were accomodating, without laying it on too thick like at some restaruants we've all been to. You know....where the waitress goes, "Hiiii! Can I get you anything? Is everything ok?" every 10 mins when she walks by. They asked if everything was cool twice. So much less annoying (without neglecting us) than waiters and waitresses in most restaurants.

Daikokuya is consistently great. I don't eat meat, though, so whenever I go end up ordering something besides the ramen, so this review is for their other menu items. Their salad is great. A+. Not much to say here, but their salad is amazing. Their yakisoba is what I crave and order every time I come here. I don't know what kind of sauce they use (they say it's a barbecue sauce) but it smells slightly fishy (oops, I'm not supposed to eat meat.. oh well, it's worth it XD) and seems like a Worcestershire-based sauce. At any rate, they're always happy to make it the way I like it - no meat, no cabbage, no onions - and it's always great. However, yesterday was a weird day. We got there and waited ~30 minutes (short for lunch time) and then, as soon as we got seated, the power went out. I was really sad, because I had been craving their yakisoba for over a month, but when we were about to give up hope, our server said she'd try to get the kitchen to make it for us anyway. They were cooking by flashlight, so that's dedication. I made sure to give her a big tip. Halfway through our wait, the power came back on anyway (while one of the servers was telling another set of folks they'd have to leave due to the power outage) so all was resolved.  Also, the power outage was the only time (besides being closed) I've seen Daikokuya without a line... XD; The only real complaint I had with this particular time was one of the waitresses (not our first server) was... how shall I say this? Rough around the edges? ..Nah, she was a complete bitch. I don't know her name, but she had a tattoo on her right hand a little above where her thumb connected to her hand. Anyway, I didn't see her smile ONCE. I figured, okay, maybe she's just having a bad day and doesn't want to be here. But then we asked for a bowl of rice, and she assumed I meant a bowl to share my boyfriend's chaahan (fried rice). She THREW, literally THREW the bowls onto our table. I jumped at how loud they clattered. I have NEVER seen a waitress do that before ever. I was mortified. The name on my check was "Chihiro" so I assumed that was our first waitress - hopefully, because I don't want the nasty chick to get her tip!! Overall, 4 stars because that nasty waitress took one. For the other waitress who went the extra mile for us to ask the kitchen, 5 stars.

Daikokuya is hands down THE BEST Ramen in Los Angeles. I've been here countless times and I've never been disappointed. I get the Ramen and Chicken Teriyaki combo and it hits the spot every time. If you plan on going at night, be prepared to wait outside a couple minutes because this place is always packed. I've been to several other Ramen joints and none can top Daikokuya. It's a must go if you're in town. If a friend tells you they want to go somewhere else or they tell you that they don't want to wait, unfriend him right there on the spot because this place is worth the wait/drive/money etc. Oh, and the service here is also super duper. They're all nice and fair with seating.

The ramen here is good, easily on par with the best I've had so far in the US. However, there are other items on the menu too! The Teriyaki Eel bowl was by far my favorite, and the chow mein is a stir fried variation of their ramen noodles and it is awesome. Write your name on the list and go exploring around the area, your seat will be there when you get back.

I came in on friday. i had their ramen and miso soup. as always miso soup is great everywhere. but it makes me sad because they only have 2 types of ramen. i liked the broth. i hated the meat to fatty for me. Too much green onion for me. i didnt even get any bamboo shoots. and i needed more noodles. just wasnt enough. it also makes me sad cause they dont even have alot of sushi. its was a small place. i wish i didnt have to wait just for seating. i have to give this place 2 stars. ill come back when they get more sushi and more different kinds of ramen. to be honest id rather go to Tokyo Ramen up in monterey Park.

Best Ramen ever!!!! I think I've found my ramen heaven here at Daikokuya. A couple of my friends and I came here at 11 PM  to dodge the wait and it was still around 20 minutes before we got our table. We all ordered ramen with the Kotteri sauce which I was hesitant at first since it's basically is pork fat. Noodle was soft yet still firm and it was just perfect with the bean sprout. The broth was definitely the most flavorful ramen broth I've ever tasted and it is not too heavy or full of salt like some other places. I love how they give a giant bowl which contains a lot of the soup which is definitely what makes this ramen bowl so damn delicious.  In addition, they give a whole egg which is perfectly seasoned but I do wish that the yolk was a bit more cook (just a preference).Too bad we didn't get to try anything else on their menu and I'll probably will only order ramen here as the wait is too long to not order ramen. One negative is that they don't' have any spicy option other than the usual pepper powder. So for the spicy eaters like myself, you'll just have to have ramen without the spiciness. On a side note, the decoration above their door is so random that it is kind of entertaining (an ancient TV, dolls, cleaning supply that looks like it's for decoration, and a bunch of other random stuff).

It's been 3 years since I first reviewed Daikokuya? Wow! Little Tokyo has a special place in my heart. When I first came to LA, there was Yaohan. Always paid a visit to Pony Toys. It was a family thing, an excursion as a little kid that I'd look forward to on weekends. Then the Asian bubble burst and less people were attracted to LT. I'm sad that a lot of businesses have struggled since then, some to a point of extinction. But with the recent investment in that area, more and more people came back. New business opened up, and suddenly LT is hip. Really hip. Well hipsters, thanks to you, business is booming but 60+ minutes of waiting for a bowl of ramen? 3 years since my first review (and I'm guessing Daikokuya is close to 4 years since its opening?), and the wait is even longer? MAJI DE (really)!? Even the new Shinsengumi location has long lines. I'm sorry, it's not worth the wait. And I'll say this for both Daikokuya and Shinsengumi LT locations. Long lines = popular for a reason. I get it. People in Japan waited 3 hours for Krispy Kreme when it first opened. But I laugh at such things. It's just a waste of my time. The ramen is decent but inconsistent. Service is so-so. Parking is whatever (I usually pay and park in the village parking lot, if not take the Gold Line). Wait is insane and I will not wait that long for a bowl of ramen. End of story. Luckily, I live in the SGV. I have 2 other Daikokuya locations that I can easily hit up within 15 minutes of where I live, and I surely don't have to wait that long. Same can be said for Shinsengumi, as a matter of fact. And besides, the recent ramen craze in LA brought in a LOT of solid quality ramen to LA metro. What used to be (not according to my views though), and probably still considered to this day the best ramen of LA has serious competition now. I'd drive an extra 15-30 minutes to go to, say, Yamadaya, Tsujita, Jinya, and the likes. Unless there's some sort of occasion that requires me to go to Daikokuya LT, you probably won't see me there. Sorry.

I went to Little Tokyo on a Friday night; for a Friday night, Little Tokyo seemed to be awfully quiet, except this restaurant. I walked around the neighbor and this was the only restaurant that actually have people waiting in line. I decided to give it a try; put our names down and we waited for almost an hour...I was getting impatient. However, I WAS SO GLAD! This restaurant is totally worth a wait. I ordered a Ki-Chi Ramen and it is by far the most delicious, amazing ramen I have ever had in the US!! I would totally go back to Daikokuya just for the ramen!!!

Not a place for vegetarians. I got the tempura bowl which was good, but nothing special. My guy friends I went with got the x-large ramen bowls with back fat. As if the large wasn't enough! They decided to finish the entire bowl soup base and all. At the beginning everyone was raving about the taste of the ramen. But midway to the end they just kept talking about how difficult it was to get the back fat down. We definitely will be going again but next time just ordering the large. The portions are huge so you might want to share. The wait is extremely long also.

The food here is good, but definitely not worth the wait (I waited about 20 minutes on a Monday afternoon) Ramen - the broth is good, but the noodles are too thick.  I think the hakata ramen at Shin Sen Gumi is far better. Gyoza - very good - I recommend getting this. Pork Fried Rice - I ordered this along with the combo - I could not eat this after the ramen (serving is quite large), but I had it as leftovers and it was quite tasty. All in all, the food here is good, but I didn't think it was worth all the hype

Per Yelp reviews, I skipped the decent ramen (served in a huge bowl like pho) for the alledgedly amazing shredded pork bowl. For the price, you really can't beat the portion of food you get: a miso soup (3-star), a salad that is more like a coleslaw... shredded cabbage with some kind of mayonnaise-based dressing (3-star), and then a good bowl of rice topped with lots of special stuff ($8.50). At first bite, I was ready to give this place four stars for the amount of food, the very fast service (once you get a table... after you've put in your 45 minutes waiting: do NOT go with more than four in your party if you don't want to be passed many times over for smaller parties), and the tongue tease of so many different layers atop my rice (onion, pork belly, ginger... YUM). However, I then made the mistake of mixing everything together because I realized it was all served on a base of white rice (which was actually "smoky" likely because someone let it burn, and that smoke carries through regardless of whether or not you remove all the burnt rice). This almost immediately made the flavor monotonous and reminiscent of lesser days eating mall food, thus knocking my star to a three. I think I would knock it back up to a four if 1) the rice had not been burnt and 2) they had used their per-Yelp famous fried rice in place of white rice as a base or just included more toppings, especially the ginger. Note: They only take cash. Bathrooms are a bit dirty but fully stocked with toilet paper, and you kind of feel like you're in another country as you walk back to your table staring at all the red booths accented by the slanted floor... or just on a fault line. Service is friendly and fast, but not the most attentive if you are waiting for your check. One on hand, that's nice, for you don't feel rushed by the staff despite the hungry mob outside waiting for your seat. On the other hand, sometimes you wanna leave when you're done. ;) Lastly, parking is difficult in the main area, but you can find easy street parking a few blocks away at Central and Towne. Yes, there will be some homeless folks, but my car was fine, and I treated some of the street residents to the leftovers from our table: free parking, good karma? Good night.

Sooo fun! Food was yummy. Place authentic. Felt like I was away from LA for a brief moment. The wait kind of killed it, hence it was cold. But had too much fun to rate it any less than a four.

I fell in love with ramen a couple months ago while I was traveling through Japan. Since I came back, I wasn't able to find a place that had ramen comparable to the amazing ramen I had in Tokyo... and then I found daikokuya. Granted, it's not as good as Tokyo ramen but it's probably the best you can get in LA. The ramen is delicious, the combo meals are a deal, and the ice cold Kirin draft makes it even better. So yes, I will wait 1+ hours outside this tiny ramen shop for a great meal.

If you want to go eat here. Please, I suggest to eat before coming here. The wait is sooooooo long. You'll be hungry again when you finally get in but IT'S TOTALLY WORTH IT. Once, you get inside and sit down the service is super fast. The total elapse time was 2 hours wait and 20 mins to finish eating. The ramen here, I was told, is how the Japaneses prefer it. The noodle are perfectly tender yet chewy and the broth is super rich. I recommend to take the broth richer by asking for the Kottorei flavor. It simply fat, yes fat as an added flavor. It's so delicious I don't care what it might do to my arteries. When the weather is right and I'm in the LA area. This is a must in my book.

I had wasting time and money in this restaurant...  My boyfriend and I were waiting for eat there for 2hours and finally our turn. Unfriendly server took our order. Gouza was HORRIBLE I have never had this huge skin gouza,,, texture was like Mochi... Ramen is super oily and nasty. I couldn't eat half even though I was hungry... I already heard about this restaurant's ramen is horrible and she told me to do not go...ya,, she was totally right I should trust her before I go.

top spot for ramen.   if you are in the la and never been here, you must eat it! and maybe even twice or three times.   their combos are for real men and woman because most people out there can't finish both cleanly.  big portions. this place is cash only nowadays. so watch out for that if you miss the 923094820394 signs they have posted inside out.

Heard about the super long waits that lasted hours, but we only ended up waiting 20-30mins. Not bad at all! Coke. Nommy as always! Daikoku Ramen. Chijire-style Egg Noodles with Kurobuta Pork Belly Chashu, Marinated Boiled Egg, Bamboo Shoots, Bean Sprouts, Green Onions, Sesame Seeds in Tonkotsu Borth. This was pretty damn good, though not as good as Orenchi in Santa Clara. I loved their soup and the chew of the ramen. It was delish. The portion size was also nice and huge, I ordered the normal size and I couldn't even finish the whole thing I was so stuffed. They give you a good amount of noodles and food for the price! What I didn't like was that the boiled egg was overcooked, I like the half-boiled egg with the runny yolk. This egg wasn't fully cooked but the yolk was more moist than runny, it's like they couldn't decide whether to cook it completely or do it half-boiled and ended up with an egg somewhere in between. I also didn't like the bamboo shoots, they were canned so they had that stinky canned flavor to it. I think I'll get mine sans bamboo shoots next time. I loved how generous they were with the pork belly chashu, they gave each bowl three thick and hearty pieces. So delish! It is a good deal for the amount you pay though so I do believe it's well worth it!

I heard alot about this place through friends so being the ramen fantaic that I am I had to try it...I do not know what the hype is about this place...I waited for about 2 hours to sit down..ordered the main dish. I'm thinking if I waited this long this better be DAMN GOOD! I wanted so much to like it, especially because I made my 3 other friends wait with me for this long as well LOL . The noodles were good.. the broth was very salty. The egg was cold? Yeah i don't know what was up with that. Maybe that day was an off day? I might come back here again to give it a second chance if I'm ever in LA ..but I would not wait 1 hour to 2 hours to eat here ever.

Great food, huge portions and excellent customer service. We went on a Thursday afternoon and we still had to wait 20 minutes. The food came out fast, and their salad dressing was awesome...I almost stole their bottle. We sat at the counter which was a little cramped for my wife's purse but I didn't mind. We each got the combo which came with a small(which I use loosely) order of teri chicken or tonkatsu and of course the huge bill of tasty ramen. Oh and there is a little surprise in your bowl at the bottom, some pork belly!!  We will definitely come here again whenever we are in Little Tokyo.  Don't forget to bring cash!!!

If you want serious Ramen, this is the place to be. I've had ramen in other places before, but here at Daikokuya, their Ramen is the bomb! It get's packed during busy hours, we had to wait for 45 mins outside in the cold, but I must say the wait was worth it. :)

Best RAMEN EVER! They gained popularity because of their ramen and it really lives up to its name. Their bento box is great especially the pork cutlet and chicken tereyaki. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is somewhat a cross between old Japanese restaurant to a vintage American cafe... even their bathroom is Japanified! Price is very affordable considering the amount of food you get. Also, their open till past midnight =) Which makes it a great place for red-faced drunk Asians to get sobered up.

Since discovering Daikokuya 3 years ago, I have never missed a visit there when I go to Los Angeles.  I love the ramen.  Never asked, but I don't think MSG is used in the food there ('cause I don't spend the rest of the evening feeling thirsty).   Ah, I have to add that I like the plum wine served.  YUM! I recently returned from Los Angeles.  I enjoyed a bowl of the ramen and the tempura.  My friends liked the food too.  The food is consistently good, time and time again.  Was only able to enjoy the food once during my stay, but I'll be back. Aloha, Noe

If you go during normal "meal" hours, especially dinner time, the wait time can be very long: 40-60+ minutes. If you go during irregular hours though, hardly any wait at all, which is what I recommend. Delicious ramen. Even if you wait an hour, it's well worth it. Soft egg and belly cut pork, with the best broth... Mmmm. I drive up from San Diego every weekend (or every other) just to have Daikoku ramen. For the first timers, I recommend regular broth, and then stepping up to kotteri broth for your next visit. Kotteri is oh so rich and oh so delicious.

After reading a lot of reviews about daikokuya, we decided to get to the shop early to beat the crowd.  In fact, we were the first ones in @ 11:05.   However the first thing we noticed was that the shop was really hot inside.  The kitchen is right alongside the seating area, which adds up to the heat, but it wasn't fun to eat ramen and sweat the whole time. I asked for less boiled noodles but the waitress didn't understand what I meant.  Say "hard" noodles if you want it that way--i thought the noodles were a little too hard, even for my taste. The broth was of course fatty, but overall pretty good.  order the small size if you're not a huge eater.  it's available but not on the menu.  regular size runs about $9.  waitstaff was friendly.

After 1000 reviews, what more can I add? I'll write on my husband's behalf though... as sadly I have never eaten the ramen... the bone marrow broth? the idea makes me squirm, but EVERYONE ELSE loves it... so I guess I must be in the wrong. i come for the gyoza, and oh my goodness, they are so amazing. instead of individual dumplins they instead hand roll one giant delicious stuffed dumpling, fry it up absolutly perfectly chewy-crispy, and then slice it up into pieces and cover it with a mountain of scallions. mmmmm. you WILL have to wait in line people, but it's so worth it.

When 10 ppl said it's good, maybe it's not good enough. However, when 1000 ppl said it's good, YOU GOTTA TRY IT!!! The soup is great, the egg is special, and the noodle is just perfect^^ In my view, this is the best of the best ramen restaurant in the Greater Los Angeles Area. The negative thing would be not enough seat and I can hardly feel the a/c, maybe they don't have one^^

I was never much of a ramen eater until my boyfriend took me here, his all-time favorite ramen house, and now I am in love! We live downtown now and walk here as often as possible. The earlier you go the shorter the line, there is always a line... but thats okay. Put your name on the list, remember your number cuz that's how they call you... Go walk across the street into the J-town plaza and have the red bean cakes at the little shop next to the Sanrio store. They are so incredibly delicious and will pleasantly hold you off. So back to Daikokuya... waiting in line is a mere price to pay for the orgasm in your mouth that's awaiting you. I always order a small bowl of the kotteri ramen (house ramen) with firm noodles, my boyfriend gets the regular size with extra kotteri! The small size is the perfect amount for me as well as the regular is for the bf. It comes quick too, which is great if you're starving. I take a few bites as served, then I add garlic.. tons of garlic, and pickled ginger. Not that it needs it, but they are very complimenting flavors. And there's a perfectly soft-boiled egg just swimming in my ramen bowl waiting to be eaten. Yummmm. Without ordering any drinks, just water, it comes out to being like $14 or something. Sometimes we'll order sake, or beer, or both but our bill is rarely over $30. I love their ramen so much that I've never been able to order anything else even though it all looks ridiculously good as well. They play great music, have great decor and service. I almost hate telling people about how great it is because I want it to be our secret, but let's not be greedy. Anywho, take the metro if you can. They're opening up a gold line stop right there too.

All I can say is this restaurant is dirty. I got stomachache after the dinner at this particular Daikokuya (I didn't have anything else after visiting this place). I wouldn't recommend this one but the other one located at Irvine inside the Marukai Supermarket. That one is cleaner. BTW, you would rarely see waitresses smile in this Little Tokyo's Daikokuya..... I wonder why.....

I find it only fair to publish my Daikokuya review after giving it a little ribbing in my Mr. Ramen post. Now, if you live in SoCal and are even just a moderate ramen eater, then chances are you've either been to Daikokuya or heard someone raving about it like it was the second coming of Christ. Mind you, I think the place is decent, but I honestly don't buy into the hype this place garners. The line here can vary from "wow, it's kind of packed" to "Jesus, that looks like a 2 hour wait." If you do make it in, you have the option of sitting either at a booth or at this pseudo-bar area where you can see the chefs in the back preparing your meal. Granted, I've only sat at the booths, but I do hear that sitting at the bar should be avoided if you can help it, if only to avoid the inevitable barrage of steam coming from the kitchen. Sitting down you will find a menu with various izakaya-style selections, and only two types of ramen. You have the Daikoku ramen (a pork bone ramen), which is what most people order, or you have the Tsukemen which is the same dish except served with cold noodles on the side and dipped in the pork bone broth. Unfortunately, the only other food I've sampled here was the gyoza and the fried rice. The fried rice was just that: fried rice, nothing too crazy. The gyoza was also alright, nothing standout or mind blowing. Now, onto the main attraction, the ramen. The Daikoku ramen is decidedly the bowl you will want to order when coming here. The pork bone broth is rich, the pork is fatty and flavorful, and overall it is a very good bowl of ramen. The Tsukemen is perfect for a warm day, as you aren't staring down into a giant bowl of steaming ramen. The cold noodles are decent, but take a turn towards Flavortown once dipped in the pork bone broth. Overall, both bowls are good and definitely worth trying at least once during visits to Little Tokyo. Sadly, I have quite a few problems with Daikokuya. The number one issue was actually an isolated incident during my last visit, but has unfortunately kept me from coming back: I found a rubber hairband in my bowl of Daikoku ramen. Yes, that's right, those bands that you use to tie your hair back when dealing with food. Repulsive. The other issue I had was disjointed service. Now, I can't shift 100% of the blame to Daikokuya for this because lets face it, this place is the busiest restaurant in Little Tokyo, beating out Shabu Shabu House. But honestly, it stinks having to wave your hands like you're flagging down an airplane on a deserted island. I also hate that rushed feeling you get from eating at places with long waits and little seating; it makes it very hard to relax and enjoy your food. Daikokuya definitely serves a good bowl of ramen, but unfortunately the long waits, seemingly unclean environment, and awkward service just don't hit home with me. Go at least once to try the Daikoku ramen and see if it was worth the hour+ wait; if it was, then you have your new spot with the other LA hipsters.

Ramen just the way I like it!!!  Daikokuya definitely hits the spot and is the Asian version of comfort food.  I have been to many ramen places in Little Tokyo and Japan town and thus far this is my favorite Ramen place because of their flavor and portions.  The broth is not too salty like most ramen places.. it has a great balance of flavors.  Also the meat is very juicy and soft like it has been marinated in the soup for hours.  If like your ramen spicy i suggest trying Orochon because Daikokuya is not spicy at all.  The portions are great because they have just enough meat, boiled egg (many places charge extra for boiled egg) and a lot of noodles.  It will definitely fill you up. The lines are insane which I hate because it smells so good waiting for seat!!! Expect to wait at least for 15 minutes for a table.

I love ramen and I've had a lot of it... but for some reason, I really love the ramen here more than many other places.  Something about the broth and the sprouts, egg and toppings.. seems the right mix for my taste buds.  Of course the soup is quite fatty, and it probably isn't the healthiest of foods one can consume, but if in the mood for some good ramen outside of Japan, I think this is the next closest thing.  The rice bowls are quite tasty as well.  I happen to like the Chicken bowl and the shredded pork bowls the best.  And the gyoza is.. OK.. I think the ramen of course is the best part of what this place has to offer.   The biggest downside to the restaurant, of course is the horrendous wait that seems to be apparent at most hours of the day.  I try to target this by taking an early lunch at 11:30 and getting there not too long after they open.  During dinner hours, I usually just put my name down, and go to the markets across the street, shop and come back.  Kind of have to expect the wait before you get there and plan accordingly.  And once you get in, it should be worth it.

This restaurant is the business.  The food is amazing.  I always get a bowl of ramen and compliment it with one of their small rice bowls.  I have never tried anything that I didn't like right away.  The ramen has so much flavor and they serve it piping hot which is especially great on a cold day.  They have a bar where you can watch the cooks make the dishes, it's fun if you see them making something you don't recognize. The service at this place is excellent, all of the waitresses are polite and they don't ever rest.  I've never seen anyone slacking off during business hours in the 20 or so times I've eaten here. The only downside to this restaurant is the wait.  I've been a regular customer for the past 5 years or so and the wait times have gradually increased every year.  Plan on waiting at the very least 20 minutes if you're alone, longer if you have a group.  The restaurant is pretty small and their booths don't fit any party larger than 4 comfortably, you might be able to get 6 small people in a booth but that is going to be super crowded. Despite the wait time and the considerable drive it is for me, about 30 minutes one way, this is one of my favorite restaurants and it's the only place I eat ramen.

The wait to eat here plain and simply sucks. However, the ramen is good.  For a fattier and tastier soup, get the kotteri, delectable little globs of fat in every spoonful.  The egg in the ramen makes it even better, with the white boiled tender and yolk creamy smooth. I would never order the deconstructed ramen though..I found the noodles to not be nearly as good, which I tried from someone else who ordered it. Without a doubt, star for me was the pork bowl though.  Absolutely delicious.  I wouldn't mind going there, foregoing the ramen and just having a pork bowl.

Went on a Friday night because of the great reviews i saw by fellow yelpers. What a GREAT experience it turned out to be! The wait was long, about an hour...but it was expected. Not too bad either as there was alot to do right across the street in the plaza. The food was great and service was fast. we ordered; the sausages and gyoza for appetizers, the daikokuya ramen combo w small tuna sashimi bowl....so YUMMY! the tuna was so amazingly fresh and pretty much melted in my mouth and the ramen was perfect. my date ordered the diced pork bowl. This was also very good, there was a sauce that was on the pork, similar to a teriyaki but milder in flavor..but very tasty. The service was friendly and fast and at the end of our dinner when the bill arrived the total was only 35 dollars and change. Pretty good considering we had two appetizers, two dinners and two beers.

Walked inside and I know why there is a wait now, this place is really small. Ordered their special- cold noodle, broth, and pork. Pork was tender and full of flavor, man the whole dish was delicious! Service is fast and friendly and prices are really good! Worth the wait!

Let's begin this review with a polarizing statement: Daikokuya is a THOUSAND times BETTER than Orochon. I am not normally a ramen fan (I know, Asians everywhere collectively GASP), but I actually find myself CRAVING Daikokuya.Unlike Orochon, their is no chef customizable levels of hotness, but their broth is like liquid heaven!   I was told that at the locations outside of J-town, you can request how firm or soft you'd like your noodles. But I assume that because this specific branch is ALWAYS full, they for go that option and serve them chef's choice. I would strongly recommend ordering a Daikokuya ramen and rice bowl combo along with their famous hand made gyoza and sharing it with a friend. That way you get to sample more food and remain comfortably full. As far as rice bowls are concerned, the Shredded Pork bowl is AMAZING. Nice complement to the gyoza and their house ramen. Please note that if you want a booth, you'd better be prepared to wait even longer than the typical 20-30 minute wait. I wouldn't recommend coming here during rush hours with a party bigger than 4.

I have convinced myself that I will never find better ramen. This is it. No matter what else I try, I always find myself thinking, "Well....it's no Daikokuya..." When you find yourself far down that wait list, don't be afraid to wander away and grab a drink in the area, its makes waiting a lot more bearable.

Picked this place because of all the great reviews and I'm glad I went! We got there around 7pm and there was just a very slight wait (it was longer bc they will only seat you when your entire party is there). I didn't realize there really is only 1 type of ramen but that's ok bc it's so tasty! Love the broth-perfect blend of flavor. They are also accomodating bc i hate onions & they made mine without onions. I also got a side of fried rice YUM YUM. I definitely will come again-it's pretty far from where I live but i'll venture there again bc it's delish. Parking wasn't too bad-meters on the street & lots of lots all around. Fun area to walk around after too :)

This is my FAVORITE ramen place of ALL TIME. In all of LA, in all of NY, in all of Japan. Ok not japan because I've never been there but I've had a lot of ramen in LA, NY, and Boston and nothing compares to Daikokuya. I'd wait on that line all day for one slurp of noodles and THE EGG. That perfectly medium-rare cooked egg that I always order an extra side of. The pork is so tender it just melts in  your mouth. The scallions and bamboo are perfect toppers for the noodles. oh THE NOODLES. My favorite component of the bowl. The texture of the noodles may be what I love the most - perfectly cooked to al dente. I abhor when noodles get soggy but the last bite of these noodles is the same as the first. And the miso broth is just perfect. Not too salty or greasy. I don't suggest the extra fatty broth that you can get for an additional price. That one may just be toooooo fatty. Other than that option, there is only 1 main kind of ramen you can get. They also have another option but its served cold with the broth on the side. The bowl sides are also very good. I've tried the fried rice, pork cutlet and eel and they are all amazing. I always have a hard time deciding which one to get. If you get the combination of noodles + side, you also get a salad that comes with a tasty dressing. Yes there is alwayyysss a wait. No matter what time I go, the wait is usually 30 minutes. I don't mind too much because I know what awaits on the other side. And when you finally do get seated, the food comes out almost instantly so it kind of makes up for the table waiting.

I came here once with my husband for our date night. He's been bugging me to go here for months! Food was amazing. We ordered the original ramyun and it came with a small bowl of fried rice which was amazing. The cons about this place is that it's so small that we had to wait a 2 hours to get seated. Plus parking was a big hassle. We had to park 2 blocks away. I think it would be better coming here for lunch so it's not as busy but it was worth the wait.

The Best Little Tokyo has to offer.  I love the food, but fear for my life when I go there.   Would it kill the staff to clean up a little bit?  There is a faint aroma of roach spray and and indescribable sliminess to every surface one might accidentally touch.  (Don't use the bathrooms here, they are quite disgusting) Still, the ramen has the perfect al dente bite and whatever it is they do to those floating  brown eggs in your pork soup; man, I dream about that wonderful taste. Although I love the food, I feel shame for desiring to be in such a gross place.

While the wait is long, it's definitely worth it.  The combinations are worth it and will leave you full.  Always get the kotteri, it makes a huge difference in the broth flavor, after trying it, the regular broth is kinda "meh."  Once you're seated, it doesn't take long for your food to come.  The sashimi bowl is okay, not the best sashimi, but it'll do, but the sushi rice is good, I liked the saltiness of it.  It complemented the ramen nicely.  There ramen bowls are humongous, so you'll leave full no matter what. :)  A bit on the pricy side for ramen, but then, at first taste, you'll understand why.

Good GOD this place was EVIL. By evil I mean horribly delicious. Kotturu (sp?)  broth where they squeeze the fat through.. O. M. G. Yes, you better have allotted at least two days worth of calories to drink it probably but DAMN. This is the kinda ramen you wake up salivating trom. Come to think of it.. I'm salivating now...

The ramen noodles are way better than pho noodle joints. I think their noodles are so much more tasty and you feel like your eating substance.   I usually order more bean sprouts because the broth flavor is just right. The wait isnt so bad when you take a few frients and chat outside untill your number is called. We are always greeted with a smile because the waiter remembers us.  I also like their cabbage salad with soy dressing.  Does anyone know how to make the dressing ?  I cannot find it anywhere in the markets. Bye for now.

I've only tried this place once but was very happy with my experience. Being from Seattle there isn't much ramen choices here. So I was very happy to find this place. I tried the shredded pork bowl and it was very delicious, the flavors were balanced nicley and had the traditional pickled red ginger on the side (tasted home made and fresh). I sat at the bar and paid close attention to their setup. These guys are the real deal, and have the system down; the boil pot, the broth pot and the soup pot, and the baskets lined up with fresh noodles ready to cook. Next time down I look forward to trying some of the ramen. I went later in the afternoon on a weekday and had zero line.

It was 11:30pm, just finished watching Les Miserables and wanted to top off the night with good food.  Yelp lead us to Daikokuya.  We waited 30 minutes and our group was next on the list.  Instead, they gave away our seats to a group of ugly F.O.B. girls that just arrived.  That ruined the night, which gave me a bitter taste for the food.  If they didn't give our seats away, I would have given them a 4 star review.... too bad...

Their ramen here is pretty good.  I've tried other ramen places and this place is pretty up there.  It's pretty small in here though and it seems like there's always a wait line.  This was my first time here and I enjoyed it for the most part.  The food was good and filling.  I got the Daikokuya ramen with a small pork cutlet bowl and I couldn't finish everything.  The downsides?  It didn't seem like this one waitress wanted to be there.  In my opinion, she was very rude (mainly with her actions).  Another thing I didn't like was the fact that they don't accept cards!  I busted a mission looking for a damn ATM machine.  Other than that, I would definitely come here again when I'm in the area and craving Japanese ramen :)

This place is awesome! The ramen isn't the best I've ever had, but it's still damn good. I prefer the ramen at Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi in Rosemead, because the broth has more flavor to it, but the fried rice and $1 salad at Daikokuya are worth the trip alone. It's so fun to walk around Little Tokyo, and end up here for dinner. Just expect a long wait, sometimes an hour or more, but It's not so bad if you plan for it.

This place gets so crowded.  Cash only.  No take outs.  One style of ramen.  Then they have combinations, bento boxes, appetizers, and other dishes.  Not bad.  Surprisingly, the soup wasn't salty like most other places.  Teriyaki eel bowl was also delicious. I would recommend the ramen + a rice bowl combination it's a better deal.

I don't know why this place is so hyped. It deserves at most 3 stars. The Ramen was decent, it lacked flavor and uniqueness. The flavors were dull and needed some variety. Top Ramen is what I thought of when I took the first bite of Ramen at this place. The wait was pretty long and I don't know what all the fuss was about. The scrambled egg over rice dish was good but I could make it taste the same in my apartment kitchen. Definitely go to Orochon if you want Ramen in the area. Overall; Long wait, over-hyped, predictable flavors, nothing special.

First off, this is arguably the best ramen in town! My wife and I decided to take a trip to J-Town and check out this place that our friends have been raving about for a long time. They were weaving tales of a place that makes a broth that is so good that people from all over will come to eat. First off, there is a line. Don't worry it seems to move along very fast. There must have been 25 people in front of us and we only waited , maybe, 15minutes. After our number is called , we are shown our seats at the bar.   Menu in hand it was time to experience the food that we have only heard about. Since we came for noodles then it was noodles that we shall have! My wife ordered the Daikokuya Ramen with a salmon roe bowl and I had to have the Daikokuya ramem with the shredded pork bowl!! The kitchen was running along at a machine-like pace. The cooks were in the zone. Nothing seemed to distract them.Basket after basket of noodles were flowing . The freshly battered tempura being made. The lovely smell of fresh gyoza being prepared. All of this had us drooling! Within minutes two huge bowls of ramen were in front of us. The smiles on our faces could have given the Joker a run for his money. After that first taste of broth we were in heaven. Memories of our time in Japan were racing through our head. The noodles were perfectly cooked,slices of pork were tender,salmon roe was lovely,shredded pork was delicious, and the egg was a treat to say the least! What more can be said about a place that serves great food and brought back such fun memories? This place is a must for all! When my friends, Anders and Jesper, come back into town to play a show this is the on place that we will all go! Better Late Than Never! Kampai!

Have you ever had an orgasm in your mouth?  According to Travis I. its called an Oralgasm...Well if you haven't....the delicious shredded pork is pretty damn near close.  If they had just served me a bowl of this I would have given them five stars.  It was a pleasant surprise. Why are there so many lines in LA?  Can't we just spread the love evenly like a Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich?   Waiting for a table for 4 ended up taking 45 minutes...and I hate waiting, it makes me anxious.  This place is as small as a matchbox which explains the wait.  I heard about this place from my friend Angel and we decided to hit this place since we were in K-Town. Freezing outside as we waited, there were bums walking about...trying to make a few bucks.  We all averted our eyes but I stupidly made eye contact so he took that as an invitation to come ask us for money.  He was a gross drunk scary cracky so I pretended I didn't speak English and he quickly moved on to his next prey of people.   The food was good.  I ordered the ramen combo with the shredded pork.  The salad that came with it was okay.  I don't really enjoy the salad, it has that different asiany Korean mayo on it that I don't really enjoy.   I loved the shredded pork, it was so good.  I wish I had just gotten the huge bowl of that because it was amazingly delicious, saucy, rich, and juicy.  My cousin ordered the chicken teriyaki combo which was good as well...but mine was better  yay!!! The ramen was good, but not amazingly delicious enough that it would force me scream out an old boyfriend's name.  So next time I'll probably order a big bowl of the shredded pork.  It makes me want to moan dirty things.   I'll be back  *wink wink*

Ordered the daikoku ramen with the kotteri flavor combined with the small pork cutlet bowl. The portions are HUGE!! What a deal for the price you're paying. The broth was pretty tasty, but not comparable to Orenchi's broth up in Cupertino in my opinion. Still, I really enjoyed the ramen here. The pork cutlet bowl was also delicious, but I couldn't even finish my ramen let alone my cutlet bowl. The combo portions are definitely something two people can share, unless you're a big eater!

imagine the last time you went on vacation.  close your eyes.  think. before you left to the airport, you had to have that VERY LAST BITE OF SOMETHING.  what was it?   after you finished it, you threw the white napkin down like a touchdown football.  rubbed your belly.  and said..."that hit the effin spot".  Then you happily took a cab to the airport and start wondering when the next time you'll have that bite.  Like the cheesecake of new york.  Or perhaps the sushi in Vancouver.  Or even that poor puppy in Vietnam.   whatever that might be, for LA, Daikokuya can possibly be truly one of those gems.  Why?  Well, literally, I saw two guys with their suit cases eating on the stand.  And judging by their fobblicious haircuts, they looked like ramen fanatics! Well besides tourist having that last bite before the airport, why does the F. Slut like it?  They took my world of ramen (world's #1 broke-man food) and SMASHED it.   Waah?  The ramen was moist, flavorful, and tasted....err...orgasmically wonderful.  And the sides?  Everything was a HIT!!!!!!! Go ahead. Is the  long wait worth it?  Yes.   Go ahead.  Is the combo too much food?  yes.  But order it! Go ahead.  Is it really a destination eat?  yes. Go ahead.  Say thank you food slut.

We got here almost midnight already and we have to wait to be seated. I guess this is the place to go to get sober. Hot ramen after drinking tons of alcohol. What I use to do is go to a korean place and have some kimchi stew I guess I'll start stopping by here instead. Yeah another 5 star review but what can you do if the food is that good!!! No need for me to describe the food cause there are more that 500+ persons who did it already. Just get the ramen and you won't be disappointed.

Come here and be prepare to wait at least an hour. It's no wonder especially when they only have 7- 8 tables. Then when you finally sit down to eat they rush you. I have to say the ramen is not bad except it very salty. I've been here twice, gave it a second chance. But still the same salty soup base. I do have to say I love the egg, still a little raw yolk inside. Otherwise I don't think I'll be coming back here soon, there are other better places without the hour wait.

Initially I didn't want to write a review on this place, but today I decided to add to the glory that is Daikokuya for a few reasons: 1) It is the place that made me realize that ramen is so much more than the Shin ramen I had grown up with, and thus began my ramen frenzy 2) You know that hostess/server with the bangs? The one usually calling out your # and seating you? Well, today I thought about it, and realized that she is probably one of the nicest people I know....or err..I mean I don't know her know her, but you know what I mean...Everytime I eat there is anywhere between 10-50 people on the wait list...ALL freakin hungry people may I add that will have a wait of 30min-1.5 hrs and not only does she sweetly answer all their same annoying questions, but she calls out your name twice. TWICE. Juust in case you left and were coming back...she waits for you. Which kinda annoys me...until I'm that angry little asian girl that while I was gone my # was called:) Anyway, she's my hero. 3) Just a LITTLE reminder. THE BAR IS NOT FIRST COME FIRST SERVE. I witnessed two ladies today doing the unthinkable and apparently just plopped down at the bar without writing their names down on the wait list. I wanted to rip them to shreds. Of course they had already ordered and super nice hostess of the universe just politely explained that for next time there was a wait list. Morons.   4) I ate lunch next to Scarlett  J. aka my husband Ryan's wife and she too wrote her name on the wait list and waited along the masses. Nice. 5) Oh and the ramen? To. die. for. Perfectly chewy noodles and amazing soup broth. I always order the combo with fried rice and just barely finish half of both. All good, bc I end up being one satisfied glutton in the end. Anyway, enough. Cheers to Daikokuya! May you live a long and prosperous life!

a yelp legend with over 1000+ reviews. how could i miss it, especially when i was staying in downtown LA (the New Ohtani, acutally) on business? the GRUB: - RAMEN. yup. thats it. im not kidding. i ordered the "Daikokuya Ramen" bowl.... delicious ramen noodles, green onions, char siu (bbq pork), fungus (mushroom), and a soy sauce pickled soft boiled egg in a lovely house broth... that can only be described as - amazing. - on my second trip, i did a combo with a medium bowl (instead of a large bowl described above) of the Daikokuya ramen... and a small tonkatsu donburi - basically a fried pork cutlet with steamed egg and onions with a soybased broth over rice. the ramen was money as usual, and the katsudon on its own was really good... but together was ALOT of food. combos also come in tempura bowls, unagi (eel) bowls, churashi (spicy tuna - raw) bowls, and teriyaki bowls... - have some Gyoza - pan fried on one side pork dumplings - theyre derishus! - $2.50 for a beer. o yes. moichido onegaishimasu!!! the JOINT: - tight. its LA, and this place is small... eat at the bar, or wait an eternity for a table... its your call. - friendly japanese food servers and cooks (at the bar) - the bathroom was 70s old school with cool as pictures of japanese wrestlers - the Gran Hamada, anyone?!?!? the SQUEEZE: - i would pay totally pay the $9 for a bowl of this awesome RAMEN - $14 for the combos are good if youre splitting with another person. - cash and card accepted. - bring quarters for the meters, parking in little tokyo is tough. FINAL SAY: another yelp legend, and one of the better Ramen-yas in Cali is not to be missed when visiting La La Land... fo sho.

The wait for the two of us was ... a long time... it must have been a 45 minute wait? Was it more? I lost track of the time, because it took so long. I forgot to order the daikokuya ramen in the kotteri style. I asked for extra sprouts and mushrooms. The "extra" amount was a hefty amount, so I was very pleased by that. However, the broth was completely tasteless. I have to go back and order it kotteri style to update the rating on this place.

3.5 Stars, Rounded off to 4 Stars. Daikokuya displayed a C rating upon entry... but whatevers, I enjoy eating at Yatais in Japan & Night Markets in SE Asia.  I'm sure compared to the sanitation guidelines with regard to those places, a "C" in LA can't be too bad.  (I hope...)  However, I've read an actual LA County retail food inspection check list (easily accessible on-line) and learned to really appreciate the stringency of (basic) cleanliness and disease controlled practices they demand from restaurateurs in our community.  I sincerely understand that running a restaurant must be  tough.  And coming here makes me a bit skeptical, as it sort of exudes desperation.  Desperation of it 'knowing' they need to shape up their rating, yet simultaneously needing to almost tread water to survive its demands, due to its popularity. And throw in the fact that they are confined in a small space, have no air conditioning and deal with downtown weather during the sweltering summertime.  With all empathy, their world must be spinning!   Now with all the cleanliness factor aside, I'm giving this review based on merely their product and service.   I'm Tonkotsu (pork based) Ramen's hugest fan... I really was drawn to  this place because they stick to one style of ramen, but two forms of presentation.  a.) served traditionally steaming hot in one bowl, or b.) tsuke-men style, basically same ingredients as the above, but everything pre-separated for you, including the noodles from the broth. I chose the tsu-ke men because I've never eaten ramen like this method before, but in the end, you end of mixing everything together anyways and it becomes sort of a nuisance.  This tsu-ke men is probably great for those of you who like extra hard noodles, because this method maintains your noodles to remain hard throughout your meal, yet since they shock your noodles in cold water before serving, it does cool down your broth, resulting in lukewarm ramen.  I personally love my ramen 'burn your tognue' hot and should have ordered the regular bowl!  My bad.   Broth - well, I could write a book about how I prefer my broth... different places have their signature styles.  I certainly enjoyed the broth as it wasn't too overpowering with pungent pork fat, nor too salty and had a nice, rich aroma.  Not the best I've had, but completely hit the spot. The noodles were a minor disappointment... while I appreciated the al dente hardness, I didn't really care for the flavor nor the consistency of the noodle.  I hands down prefer Shinsengumi's much, much more so. We shared the Fried Rice and that was actually excellent!   Service was extremely friendly and efficient... we got in just minutes before their evening rush.  By the time we were leaving, a line had already formed outside. I recommend you visiting this place during off peak hours for a late lunch, or late night post drinking snack.

I don't care that there's always a crazy wait...it's worth it. I don't care the half Jap half white server talks in a fake Japanese accent...he's actually quite funny. I don't care that the service isn't the best...they do the best they can to get you in and out. I don't care that you only have 2 choices...regular or kotteri. I don't care that you smell like your food when you walk outta here...it's a nice little souvenir. I don't care that some people say it's lacking flavor...there's plenty of flavor for me. I don't care that when I finish my ramen, I feel like a fat slob. The only thing I care about is that this place has the best mother f@#$ing ramen I've ever had...and $2.50 Kirins in a frosted mug?  That's so gravy.

I got to the restaurant about five minutes before opening. As soon as I got in, the line started to form all the way to the back. Man, I guess people really love this place! I will never wait in long line to eat ramen. But, that's just me. Anywho, it was my first time trying Daikokuya. Heard good things about this place, so I thought I give it a try. Just as other reviews say, the broth was very rich and tasty. Bit on fatty side, but the soup flavor compensated it. It was a lot better than those miso soup ramen IMHO. Noodles were boiled perfect. Pork belly was... umm... pork belly. Overall, it was good. It was not the best I have tasted but good enough to come back for more when I have the craving or in need of hangover cure.

Wait can get long during weekend peak dinner hours; baby tv and coffee table reading material to entertain while you wait.  Atmosphere typical of hole-in-wall places.  They don't validate for the $5 plaza parking garage since it's technically across the street from it, but it's probably the easiest place to try and get in on if you're SOL for street parking. For fast seating, don't be picky about getting a booth vs counter seat.  There's always a wait for a seat unless you catch them when they open, and that's a testament to the quality.  Pricing is fair in my opinion.  It's wonderful watching them prepare each bowl, separating the noodles for you like the delicious art form it is.  The sake wasn't memorable.  I recommend the teriyaki chicken bowl despite hating teriyaki anything, because they do it right: crispy and lightly glazed.  That's ginger on the side, by the way, not carrots.  The chicken and egg bowl was good for what it is, and the shredded pork is okay but totals up to way too much pig for my tongue.  Some nights the boiled soy egg is perfect, other nights it has cooked too long in advance.  Ask for extra dressing (delicious for being carrot-based) on your salad if you get a combo, and get your broth kotteri (rich) if you can deal with extra calories.  The black pork is what seals the deal for me, just enough fat and all kinds of yummy.  Bathrooms are single occupancy.  Fair warning: the booths in the back half are tilted.  When you leave, the staff sends you off in verbal unison. I was reading Jonathan Safran Foer's Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close when a woman came up to me and started asking me how I liked it.  Tessa and I hit it off immediately, and she recommended the bar a few doors down that she and her husband had been drinking at to pass the wait time.  Apparently the tuna sashimi is pretty good... the poor woman was allergic to pork!  Her husband agreed with us that this place was divine, though, and she thanked me for the tip on Hama Sushi the next block down.  Definitely my favorite random encounter, and I'm glad I turned them on to a sushi place I'd put my money behind. Another guy came in one time and asked for chicken ramen.  Hate to say it but nobody cared when he left in a huff.

My arteries may never forgive me for this.   I set out on my own little Yelp adventure today and one of my stops was Daikokuya so I could finally try the ramen everyone raves about, during off-peak hours.  I did my research and knew I wanted the famous Daikoku ramen with the Kotteri option- extra pork back fat in the broth for a super-rich flavor.  I was slightly intimidated when the cook guy handed me a GINORMOUS bowl big enough for my head!  The broth is creamy and obviously full of fat.  The ramen noodles had a nice bounce and curl to them and good flavor too.  They top the noodles with diced fresh seaweed, green onions, bean sprouts, marinated bamboo shoots, a marinated boiled egg, and of course, the pork.  I thought the broth was good although I felt like the flavor of the bean sprouts kept interfering with savoring the pork flavor in it.  Is that odd?  It was also so thick and rich, i could almost feel the fat oozing down my throat and later congealing in my arteries.  hehe.  I was kinda disappointed by how stingy they are with the pork- I want more meat!  One surprise was the marinated egg- I always see those at ramen/bento joints and have never had any interest in trying one.  The color is weird to me.  I've also never been able to stomach eggs in any form besides scrambled until maybe 5-6 years ago.  But the egg was yummy!  It was delicious in a large slurp of broth and noodles. One thing that surprised me, even after reading all about it, is how damn fast this place fills up!  I got there around 11:15 AM.  Only 2 tables and one stool at the bar were occupied.  I seated myself at the bar and got my food in about 5-10 minutes.  By the time I left, around 11:40ish (I know, I eat fast), the entire place was full and a couple was just putting their name down on the list at the door.  I hung around J-Town for a while after my lunch and when I looked at the place later, several people were milling around out front, waiting for a table. I enjoyed the meal and even brought home a small amount of broth and noodles for my boyfriend to try, but overall, I think I am still happiest with Santouka.  Despite the popularity, I just wasn't super-blown-away-impressed.  I also can't see myself waiting more than 10 minutes for ramen so its good that I went on this beautiful Monday morning.

I have to admit that I had my doubts while waiting in line in front of the yellow awning at Daikokuya. How good can it really be? Is it really worth an hour + wait? Luckily, our wait at 1am was less than half an hour. But then again, there's still a wait at 1am?? I guess we were lucky. All of the anticipation paid off as I was presented with the most amazing bowl of ramen ever to be consumed on this earth. Well at least the most amazing out of the humble streets of Southern California. I wouldn't say that the ramen reached 100% perfection since it was too salty IMO, but it was a good 99% there. The broth was extremely flavorful and hit the perfect balance of being slurp worthy without being too oily. The pork was divine and the flavor and texture was out of this world. The ramen noodles were also the perfect thickness to stand up to the strong broth and pork. Perfectly al dente and chewy. Add in a generous helping of scallions and you have in front of you the best ramen in LA (among top contenders Santouka Ramen, Hakata Shin Sen Gumi, and Ajisen). On a side note, there is an option to get an even fattier version of their broth (aka kotteri) but the regular broth is already so flavorful and salty that I really don't think it's necessary. You can also take your leftovers home. Just make sure to separate the noodles from the the broth and it'll be just as delicious the next day. And as for the fried rice...it's overrated. Stick to the ramen.

942 reviews, 4 stars..... that pretty much sums it up.  but, what's another 2 cents right? well, i'm from the bay area, so my ramen standard is katana-ya in SF.  i compare all my ramen experiences to katanaya... i am not going to say daikokuya is not as good as katanaya, but i would say it's a good bowl of ramen in its own unique way.  the broth is lighter.  i liked the noodles, which tasted fresh and not overly cooked.  but what i LUV the most about the ramen was the egg.  i don't know what kind of secret sauce they soaked the eggs in for how many days or months, but i could eat a dozen of these eggs.   daikokuya, good ramen, hate the long lines, but LOVE the eggs.

Ramen Ramen Ramen Lalalala~~~ So there were five of us, who decided to drive all the way up to Little Tokyo for some ramen. I am usually a Santouka fan, but heard this place rocks, so I was super excited, and hungry. It took forever to get in, tho. It was such a busy place. I guess it does not help that we went at the prime time for lunch. We waited, and waited and waited very patiently, to have the ramen of Lil Tokyo. We started off with some kyoja and pork appitizer. The pork was very impressive and well balanced. The meat in the kyoja had a very interesting flavor to it. It was nice. I ordered cold noodles. Yeah, the weather was sizzling hot and I needed something to cool me off. When I saw the size of that thing, tho, my jar dropped. It was so huge. I kind of wished they still put tomatos in it despite the tomato scare, but they didn't put it in. bummer. I had it with the sesame dressing. It was good. Actually the whole semame dressing and the mustard reminded me of Chinese cold noodles with peanut sauce and mustard, minus the broth. Ok, the broth. I stole some broth from another ramen. It was a miso based broth but it was rich in flavor, without too much saltiness like you'd find in Santouka's miso ramen. Nice nice nice. The standard ramen also had some pork in it, which made me compare the pork to the Santouka's ramen. I liked the pork here better. It was softer and flavorful. I also stole some Unagi (eel) from another rice bowl. I am very used to unagi, since we Koreans eat that stuff a lot. Unagi had a lot of sauce on it, which made it very good. Fried rice. We ordered a large fried rice. The pork in the rice was well flavored as well. So I guess I have to say overall, the pork here is very nicely cooked and full of flavor. After seeing that they have another Daikokua in Costa Mesa, I couldn't help going there today for lunch as well. The review is coming up. Overall, I liked this place better than Santouka, for their variety of menu and well flavored pork, as well as the broth that is not too salty.

I rarely say this, but the wait was worth it. Food: PIcture a big old bowl full of noodles swimming in a huge helping of daily prepared beef bone broth coated in green onions and sesame. Add in some bean sprouts, some bamboo shoots, and a hard boiled soy sauce egg and you have the signature Daikoku ramen (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…). The portions are so huge here that I was able to split mine in half with Tina B. and still look pregnant after my meal. We also tried the salmon roe donburi (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) which was super yummy since the ikura was fresh and not mashed up from improper handling. The meal also comes with a yummy cabbage salad complete with a tangy dressing (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…). I swallowed everything they had to offer and wanted more even though I felt like I was going to bust. The broth is pretty much perfectly flavored with the right amount of salt and beef taste. Service: Yes, you'll have to wait probably at least an hour, but you can amuse yourself in one of the shops across the street or next door. Watch out though. They won't seat you unless everyone in your party is present. Atmosphere. It's very small inside, but once you're seated it doesn't matter. Your face will be in the bowl for the most part. The booths are large enough to hold bigger parties, but for those who are here to eat and not socialize, there's a noodle bar. I saw a waiter spill a ton of soup on the floor and hastily clean it with a rag he had in his pocket. Kinda gross... but I forgot about it after the food came. Synopsis: Still not satisfied even after several days. I want more!

when i think of ramen, i use to think of the "kung-fu" brand that i get in asian supermarkets. you know, the ones flavored with shrimp, chicken, or beef powder with a brick of fried ramen ready for a bowl of boiling hot water. then there's daikokuya ramen. wowzas! a friday night early dinner with friends turned out to be an amazing slurp fest! i ordered the ramen and an appetizer of spicy tuna. the spicy tuna was good, but the RAMEN. dang! get the heck out! this stuff is awesome. the soup was nicely seasoned and definitely not too salty but still thick in flavor. the noodles were aldente which provided great texture to add to the medley of incredible flavors already going around in my mouth. i LOVED the generous pile of sliced green onions heaped in the bowl. though my breath smelled rancid, my tastebuds were clearly enjoying itself. and the meat...ah, the meat. i called it "melty meat" because the meat literally melts itself in your mouth when you eat it due to the perfect amount of marbled fat. and the egg...hey, who doesn't like embryos anyways? it was a damn delectable bowl of ramen. now when i think of ramen, i think daikokuya!

The appeal of this place for me was that it really brought back some of my childhood. It reminded me of my little Japanese grammy's kitchen...vinyl seats on metal frames, uneven floor, old lino...kinda place that you walk out feeling a little greasy and a bit sweaty, but content. If someone inside would have been puffing on a Parliament while hand-mixing something in a bowl , it would have completed my time-warp. It was real throw-back type place, real J-Town history...what a warm blanket! Now lemme tell ya, in a moment's notice, 'bachan could doctor up a bowl of Top Ramen like no other, but this place wasn't bad either. Of course I'm not comparing the two, but to me, ramen has always been comfort food. It was a pretty big bowl of ramen, complete with the egg hard-boiled in shoyu and eggy broth. The pork had a kinda soft consistency, but it was good. Had a side of gyoza...def. homemade. Everything was solid and good...nothing mind-blowing, but hit the spot. I'll be back for the food and the good feeling. Broke the hell out because there was a crowd of people waiting to get in, giving us stink-eye. But hey, as my sweet little Grammy used to say, "F**k it." 3 stars for the grinds and 1 extra for the atmosphere.

It is an ok place for food and 5 star for ramen. Not worth for 1 hour waiting. The reason so crowed because their seats are limited. So people think this place is good due to a long line outside actually they can only accommodate like 20 people at the same time. And after 1 hour waiting for ur food, even a plain bread will be delicious. Next time when u r hungry, and want to eat something, put a bread in the front of you and wait for an hour, eat it. And do the same thing for ramen. It will be the same feeling and same taste!!!

PROS: -RAMEN HEAVEN ON EARTH (not even kidding) -cheap (for LA); A combo of Ramen + Tuna sashimi over rice + salad = ~$13.50; just ramen would be $8.75 or so. -Open late until 1am on Fri & Sat CONS: -You might be waiting forever, seriously -waitresses have accents so you may not hear your number/name being called or pronounced correctly; put down a simple name and remember your number -not good for groups of 4+, I'd say 6 slim sized people would be the limit (that's how many you could cram into a booth) ------ I probably come here at least once a month and I've waited over 3 hours to get seated- that's how good it is. Be prepared to bring a book or interesting company to wait it out. The waitresses cannot give you an estimate of how long you'll be waiting because some people sign in, chicken out, and just choose to eat somewhere else because the patrons can't take the wait. Basically 1 page of people on the sign-in sheet = 1 hour of waiting. I usually walk around Little Tokyo for 30-40 min before getting seated. Try the Curry Donut at the Yamazaki Bakery across the street as a cheap, pre-ramen appetizer! I think it's about $2.

I have always been a ramen lover. And this is my second time dining at Daikokuya after I tried their ramen three years ago. It wasn't so special for me during my first visit. But one of my friends has recommended me to try the kotteri style, so after three years, I gave Daikokuya a second trial. Again, the place was packed.  EVEN on a Sunday afternoon at 3:30... But good stuff always worths the wait. We ordered the Kotteri style ramen and small fried rice.  Warning: the kotteri style has a lot of pork fat in it, really really greasy but in a yum way. The flavour of the soup tasted quite light but it thickened gradually and was much tastier after a few bites. Noodle has great texture. The portion was very decent and filled me up quite fast. I dont feel thirsty at all after the meal which i normally do after eating ramen. For the price, it is reasonable compared to most ramen place (25 bucks tips included for 2 ramen n one small fried rice). After all, it's a good ramen place.  But honestly, lining up when you are starving isn't fun :{{{ I'll certainly revisit when I am not that hungry.

I came here with high hopes.  I'm a ramen fanatic.  If ramen was a celebrity, I'd be those crazy fans that stalk it every day and stare at it outside it's window while it's changing.  While I think the ramen here is good, I don't think it warrants the hype.  I waited an hour in line to eat this and I don't really know if it's worth it.  I was actually more impressed by their fried rice.

Well, what can I really say that hasn't been said yet in Daikokuya's thousand-something reviews?? I've been dying to come here for a super long time, and finally tried it last weekend for lunch with my bestie. I've been to Orochon before, and it seems like the battle is on between Orochon and Daikokuya for who has the best ramen in LA. Both are different though, so I'm not sure if it's really fair to put them in the same category. I loved Orochon, but oh lord, do I love Daikokuya now too!!! My friend and I went on a Sunday, and I saw on yelp that they opened at 12, so we opted to meet around 1145 just in case there was a wait. There were already about 8 people waiting outside, and after we got there, maybe 10 more people came. The one thing that ticked me off was when the doors opened at 12, somehow my friend and I got shoved aside and everyone who came after us ran to get seated first. Can you spell R-U-D-E? We ended up sitting at the bar, which wasn't bad either, but a table would have been nicer. More room to stretch out after stuffing yourself silly, you know? Their menu isn't too extensive or crazy which I liked. Simple, and straight to the point. They have great combinations with their ramen for around $11 that include salad. I ordered the ramen with the shredded pork bowl, my friend got the ramen with the pork cutlet bowl. Just in case we didn't look like piggies yet, we threw in an order of their gyoza because NOT ordering gyoza in a true Japanese restaurant is just not ok in my book. Plus it looked so delicious in the photo. The salad came first, and it was simple with a great dressing. The gyoza were FABULOUS. Their own house gyoza, topped with mounds of onions. Absolutely delicious, I could eat those every day. When the server brought out our ramen in humongous bowls, I started thinking that maybe we should have shared. I loved the broth, it was perhaps a bit too salty, but I'm a fan of sodium so who am I to complain? The noodles were perfect, love the bamboo, and the egg was a somewhat-runny yolk but nottttt quiteeeeee, which is just how I like it. The shredded pork was a great complement to my ramen. The pork was delicious, reminded me a lot of the shredded pork bowl I get from Santouka ramen. The teriyaki sauce was a little too heavy though, I could have done with about half of the amount of sauce they gave me. The service is great, super friendly and quick and efficient. My friend and I like to leisurely eat and chat and gossip when we have our lunch dates, but I'm thinking that wasn't too conducive to the rushed atmosphere of this place. They're all about sit down, order, eat, and go. I guess you can't really blame them since they're so popular, and always have a line of people waiting. My verdict- absolutely fantastic, and I can't wait to come here again!!!!!

WOW!  Almost 1,000 reviews?!?!  Good job Daikokuya.  How did I jump in the bandwagon so late?  Anyway, been here twice and this is probably the best ramen i have ever had.  The borth is rich, but not overbearing.  It comes with a hard-boiled egg and some slices of pork.  I always get the half portion because I can't finish the big bowl (definitely recommended for the ones with a smaller appetite).  The cosistency of the noodles is al dente .. perfection!  I always add in two scoops of ground garlic that is readily available on the table as a condiment.  I love it!  5 stars!

OK so my friend took me to this place after we went to the premiere of the hangover. This place is in the heart of little tokyo... If you want the late night asian experience... come here late at night... any time you come to a place like this you want to have what they are famous for... its a ramen place so I got the Diakokuya Ramen... but my friend kept telling me to try the pork bowl cause its bomb... and I was like if its so good, why isn't the signature dish... I got the ramen combo that came with salad and mini bowl of tuna... So the food comes and I her brother got the pork bowl and he let me try some... OMG it was delicious... I mean the Ramen was great too but nothing compared to the pork... so my advice... Get the pork... they might be known for the Ramen... but that pork totally kicks the Ramen's ass...

having lived in kumamoto, japan (an area of japan reknowned for its tonkotsu-pork broth- ramen) for two years, i think i am worthy of being judge of good ramen versus plain nasty.  and daikokuya is most worthy of the label....'oishiiiii.' after my friend and i checked out the incredible murakami exhibit at the moca, we knew that ramen would be the only way to cap off the evening.  little tokyo visitors can readily find daikokuya by its bright yellow awning.  at about 6pm, our wait was about 20 minutes.  sat at the bar, we got a close up view of the chefs as they assemble these bowls of deliciousness. we started with the spicy tuna maki and ordered a bowl of daikokuya ramen each.  my only negative comment about the place was that our order seemed to have taken forever (i had to call over the waitress to ask her about our order status).  watching others slurp with joy was driving me crazy.  finally... our huge bowls of ramen arrived.  the pork broth was ever so tasty (although i wish it was a bit thicker- as it is in japan), and the chashu pork was so tender and marbled with delicious fat...the noodles also had just the right bite to them.  the whole soy flavored boiled egg was a nice touch to the ramen (although i wish it was sliced instead for easier eating). eating at daikokuya transported me back to my little town in japan and the incredible feeling of warmth, both literally and figuratively, that a big bowl of ramen can bring on... will be back for more again soon!

After hearing the recommendations of a couple good friends and seeing that this place had over 600 reviews here on Yelp!, I decided that I absolutely had to give it a try. The verdict: It was good, but, personally, I think that the hype about this place has got to be a bigger deal than the quality of the famous ramen itself... Perhaps it was because everyone made such a huge deal out of it that my expectations were too high... So my friend and came here in the middle of the afternoon on a weekday in hopes of being able to get a table without having to wait for a billion years. Surprisingly when we arrived, the tables were all full so we had to wait a mere 2 mins before being seated. Wow... who would have thought that so many people would want to go to Daikokuya around 3pm on a weekday? The restaurant is pretty small... I'm guessing it seats only about 24 people in the 6 booths then about 10 on the counter stools. The decor almost reminds me of an old 1950's American diner feel if not for the Japanese posters and paraphernalia on walls and hanging from the ceiling.   Anyways, we both decided to get combination dishes of the famous Daikoku Ramen along with Chicken and Egg ($10.95) for her then Tempera ($11.50) for me. The waitress took our orders on a spiffy palm pilot type of device and was able to answer my questions easily. While waiting just a short while for our combos, we were given a small salad of iceburg lettuce shreds, onion and dressing... which wasn't exactly ideal since we both don't like and weren't expecting onion in there, bleh! Putting the salad aside, it was cool to watch the cooks preparing the ramen behind a counter in the dining room. The fact that they looked Japanese was reassuring, as well, that what we were anticipating was the real thing in being more authentic than other ramen we'd had before. The large, steaming hot bowls arrived at our table soon later, and we dove in. The broth, itself, is pork-based and light in flavor. Inside the soup are egg noodles, chashu pork, bean sprouts, a whole broiled egg, bamboo shoots, lots of green onions, and sesame seeds. As I said before, it was definitely good... but just not as good as the hype would make me expect. I think it's just because I'm just a fan of more flavorful broth and larger quantities of noodles, and this bowl didn't quite have those qualities. *shrug* Anyways, the pork was definitely melt-in-your-mouth texture, and the bamboo shoots were very flavorful as if they had been pre-marinated before. The tempera side order contained 1 shrimp, 1 thick onion ring, 2 green beans, and 1 slice of potato all over a bowl of rice. It was a bit small in quantity. but the flavor and consistency of the tempera batter was perfectly yummy. In the end, both of us took home leftovers of about 1/2 our ramen since we became quite full pretty quickly. One thing to take note of us how customer-friendly yet confusing their system is for paying the check. First, it was cool that they allowed us to split the check between 2 separate cards in which we indicated exactly now much we wanted charged on each card including tax and tip ($13.20 for her and $13.80 for me.) Upon receiving our receipts, I was surprised that the customer receives 2 receipts, each of which shows the supposed exact breakdown of the costs of the base, the tax, and the tip of both the total and then our individual subtotals. However... the numbers didn't really match up since it indicated that my base pay was the average of our 2 dishes and then I over-tipped... whereas for my friend (who ordered a less expensive dish), her receipt shows the same averaged base pay and that she under-tipped. Errr, confusing... I know. But whatever, we were correctly charged the amounts that we indicated regardless of the number breakdown shown on our receipts.

such a small place w/ a such a HUGE WAIT.. so it must tell you something right? of all the restaurants on the block, daikokuya was the only one BOOMING w/ business the ramen soup is really good and you can tell they go for quality.. try the more "fatty" soup ..its got MORE flavor but i guess it's way more unhealthy ... well can't get around that.. =) the noodles are diff from what i'm used . what? EGG noodles in my ramen?.. w/ the soup and noodles.. this is some of the best ramen i've ever had.. i'd recommend gettin' the smaller bowl option, I could NOT breathe after i downed my bowl its 8.50 for the big bowl, they also have combos w/ rice.. but i didnt think they were that great although my friend swears they are usually better combo comes w/ a SALAD THAT IS PRETTY GOOD .. almost like furaibo's salad.. but i still like furaibo's better

One of the best places to get ramen but be prepared to wait in line for up to an hour. Luckily, there's lots of cute shops around including Mikawaya. Nothing wrong with having dessert first! Once you're in service is friendly and the food comes quick. The interior is very small, which is why the wait is so long. There are a few booths and a long slim counter facing the kitchen. Very traditionally Japanese. You can peer over and watch the masters work their sizzling woks, inhale the aromas wafting over. Gyoza: pork filled fried sweet dumplings topped off with lots of scallions. Dip in soy sauce for that wonderful sweet and salty combo. My friend gave up meat a few months ago and still had to have some! Fried rice with fried egg and chashu: the rice itself is flavored beautifully. I swear they must pour butter over it, but it's not overly greasy at all. Simple perfection. And the meat of it all: Ramen. The thick, hearty pork based broth makes the dish. It's absolutely wonderful and creamy. The noodles themselves are firm and chewy. I actually prefer noodles a little softer, but I'll eat anything in this broth. Other toppings included a brown hard boiled egg cooked just until set and still really soft, crisp bean sprouts, chashu, sliced green onions. The chashu had chunks of fat adhering to the meat iself, which wasn't that tender. Would have preferred fatty meat, not fat stuck to meat. Fyi: you can order a smaller bowl of this. The regular is enormous! I thought you only left Korean BBQs smelling like your dinner. Be prepared to smell like ramen afterwards.

When this place first came out, I thought it was really great. But nowadays, I feel like it's not the same. It is pretty heavy ramen, but on a cold night it satisfies. I would go again, but I wouldn't wait in line for a long time for it.

I gave Daikokuya another try because I feel like you need to give everything two chances. It can't compare to Hakata Shin Shengumi. I'm not going to try to convince you all to go to Hakata though because I don't want to wait in even longer lines! =) They are my #1

despite sitting in front of the giant boiling pot of broth and feeling like i was sitting in a sauna, daikokuya's ramen was quite delicious! order the combo and opt for the tuna sashimi bowl on the side or any of the combination bowls they offer.  they offer a very good deal for the combo, or if you're just not that hungry, order ramen!

I'm going against the majority and giving this place 2 stars.  There was not enough flavor in my ramen.  The soup base was very rich, but too oily for me (maybe from the pork bones simmering for 24 hours).  I thought the pork cutlet rice bowl was better than the ramen.   Kris S. also did not like her food.  She barely finished a 1/3 of her ramen and had a few bites from the pork cutlet. I realize that Michael L. will give me a hard time about this, but it just did not work for me.

Ok lets be real here, Daikokuya is the most overated ramen restaurant in WESTERN CIVILIZATION.  No way is it worth a ONE HOUR WAIT for some mediocre ramen.  Honestly, their broth isnt as crackin as people say it is and I do not see anything spectacular about this place or the food.  And yes I do have some ramen street cred as Ive been able to experience Ramen in the Ramen Motherland of Japan.  This is just another case of ASIANS over saturating a spot and blowing it up like they just found the Magna Carta.  I bet 90% of people that go here go straight to pink berry right after.  Better go to Kouraku with that ish and get you some decent ramen suckas.

1 hour.  1 frickin' I waited for an $8.50 bowl of noodles and soup.  I swear, I was going to pass out from the heat.  We were all starting to get angry with each other as we waited.  Funny thing is, we walked over after a church service on which the message was love.  Here we were about to rip each other's throats off because we were so hungry and the sound of someone looking at you wrong was just too much to bear.  But we made our way in and walked out fat and happy.  :) The verdict: Guilty!   I went to this place with high hopes and expectations that I was certain would disappoint.  What I found?  The broth was creamier than I had expected, but its weightiness gave it substance and character.  The bamboo shoots were a delightful addition to the broth.  I thoroughly enjoyed the whole boiled egg (soy sauce?) that came with the soup as well.  The Cha-Shu (pork) melts in your mouth.  If M&M's has broken any laws, it would've been their slogan that it melts in your mouth.  This stuff really just melts like butter.  What I'm really trying to say here is that the Ramen is good... no... it's great.  I asked the 5 other people who went with me (2 of which sat at the bar because they could only seat 4 people + 1 in a booth) how often they would be willing to eat this and it was a unanimous 2x a week.  I then asked how often they would actually eat it, and each of them said at least once!  Sweetness. I tried the Gyoza (fried dumplings) by recommendation and was thoroughly disappointed.  Seemed store bought to me. Would I go here again?  I guess that depends on whether or not I'm in the area.  As long as I'm in the area, I will be frequenting the place.  If not, I'll just go somewhere else.

I have been to the little Tokyo location, the Monterey location, and the Hacienda Heights location.  It is definitely the best ramen I have ever had.   The eel over rice is really good and would order it again if the ramen wasn't so filling already.  The Japanese sausages are really good.  It has a nice sweet and salty taste.  Now the boiled egg here is the best boiled egg ever.  It is salty on the outside and creamy inside.   The only con is that it gets so busy and there is usually a wait during prime hours.  I would suggest going at an off hour where people don't regularly eat if you don't want to wait.

Ramen. How good can ramen be? Is not Cup o' Noodles, Ramen? Well, let me tell you Daikokuya does Ramen right. Very right. It is small. It is normally very crowded. There Will Be Waiting...and waiting, followed by some more waiting, then a little standing around, before some more waiting. But, it's worth it. The portions are large and the quality and taste is a great value. My wife and I got the Daikokuya Ramen with pork. Insanely good and big. I was very full. We happened upon this place whilst walking around Little Tokyo. Saw a large group of people standing outside. Asian people.  Now, a couple of things - first, I am Asian and I know that Asians don't wait in long lines unless something is truly worth it.  Truth. Think about it. You don't see Asians waiting in line to get the latest Justin Bieber CD. But, I digress. Second - if you see a crowd of Asians waiting to get into an Asian restaurant, it is a very good sign.  Just like if you saw a crowd of Mexicans waiting to get into a Mexican restaurant, that's a good reason to expect good Mexican food.  Follow The Color. Let that be your guide, people.  You will not go wrong.  Only, that rule does not apply to white folks. No offense, but I see long lines at McDs every day. It's not the cleanest of places, but the food will make you look past the dinginess.

I really feel like the devil for giving Daikokuya 3 stars.  Maybe it was the hype and the fact that it had taken me ~4 years of living in LA and several failed attempts to FINALLY try the the place.  I wanted so badly to love Daikokuya, but it failed to live up to all the hype. Yes, broth is creamy and I love that they have half sizes for the Daikokuya ramen.  I just don't think it's worth the wait.  I'm glad I was finally able to try Daikokuya, but will I return? Maybe. I'd do a lot for good food, but I don't see myself ever mustering up the desire to stand in that miserable line for Daikokuya.

the ramen here is delish! and there's only one kind:it has bean sprouts, green onion, bamboo shoots, a very delicious egg with a CREAMY center and kurubota berkshire porkbelly... the broth is made with pork bones and joints that has been boiled all night @ a "undisclosed location"... you can also request a richer, fatter version for the hardcore.  i've seen a guy next to me order it ~ you could see all the oil in his bowl. you could also order everything on the side (cold) and they give you a bowl of soup as well... i got the combo: comes with a small tempura bowl with the most crispy textured tempura i've ever had! it was a little oily but it was really good... it had one shrimp, sweet potato, carrot, onion ring and two green beans all already dressed in tempura sauce. i also tried the fried rice and it was one of the best fried rice i had @ a ramen place ~ kind of like really good chinese fried rice with a japanese twist ? @ the beginning they also give you a cabbage salad with a very yummy japanese dressing... this place is VERY satisfying but a bit of a wait (even @ 5:30)...

I heard alot about this place and wanted to try it out. Upon arriving, there was a long wait. I honestly didn't think it was worth the 45 minute wait. Orochon I feel is a better noodle joint. The food was okay. I had the noodle and katsu combo, I got to say the portions are huge and I could have shared it with my girlfriend. We both didn't finish our all our food. Plus if you sit in the bar/cooking area it gets prettty hot from them cooking, try not to sit in front of the that area.

I went here on a friday afternoon and waited about 30 minutes for a table for 3. There are only 2 kinds of ramen on the menu, the one with the soup and the one that is dry, with the soup on the side. What makes your meal different is if you get the combo meal for an additional 2-3 bucks. I had the shredded pork and tried the tuna sashimi and the salmon eggs from my friends. The shredded pork was so good! It had chunks of seared pork with a sweet teriyaki sauce on top and some seaweed over rice. I also really liked their salad, it had shredded cabbage and a creamy dressing that didn't taste like anything i had before. I tried to finish everything but toward the end of my ramen, i was getting sick of eating. The combo meal can definitely be shared between 2 people.

Best ramen I've had so far in the US. I was extremely hungry after a long drive and that might have made it even better tasting, but still- I must give it 5 stars. The soup is not too salty or thick, which is good. The egg wasn't my favorite part... it was good, but not as flavorful as some places I have had and kind of dry. The meat- good and nothing to complain about, although I like thicker meat but I've only had that in Japan. The rice bowls are really good too. I had the chicken one and I loved it. Just thinking about the food is making me hungry!

wow, the daikoku ramen is the shiznit and easily whoops on hakata shinsengumi and santouka.  yep, easily whoops the two other socal ramen contenders. why am i so enamored?  well, let me count the ways: 1.  eggs noodles cooked a nice al dente 2.  super tender pork belly strips and fatty broth without the heaviness and extreme saltiness 3.  hard boiled egg, but with slightly runny yolk yep, daikokuya hit the trifecta. what i thought were just ok: - gyoza: nothing special. they were nicely fried but were very standard - katsu don: as with the gyoza, the katsu don was nothing special. don't get me wrong, the gyoza and katsu don were both quite palatable but the ramen really takes the spotlight and the love at daikokuya. the wait can be a pain in the ass, but the far bar is a few steps down the block so grab a drink while you wait for your name to be called. i will be back to satisfy my next ramen craving.

The pork based soup lived up to the hype.  It was indeed rich without being salty.  The noodles had the perfect amount of chewiness.  No wonder they only need to serve one type of ramen here.  I got the ramen combo with a small bowl of oyako don for $10.50.  The ramen itself would've cost $7.50.  This is costlier than what Koraku charges a block away, both a la carte and combo since Koraku's combo could be had for $7.75.  The portions of the ramen did not seem overly generous, but with the rice, I was overstuffed before all was said and done.  I also saw a bunch of people order their combination bentos...2 items for $9.95, 3 items for $11.95.  I haven't heard much about their bentos, but it looked good, and almost tempted me.  Service was great also, since they got our noodles out within 5 minutes.  The oyako don followed a few minutes later, and the staff was attentive enough to check in with us, collect empty bowls etc.  That's more than I can ask for in that regard.   However, on this relatively cool LA evening, I did find that the ventilation and AC in the restaurant was completely unsatisfactory.  It was so hot in there from all the cooking, that not only was everyone sweating from eating their ramen, but I also found myself smelling like food after I left.  They didn't even bother putting a fan out.  And like I said...this was a cool night.  What happens when it really is hot???  Since how I rate a restaurant depends very much on the entire dining experience, not just the food, I have to penalize Daikokuya for this.  I don't care how good the food is, if I can't enjoy it in an acceptably comfortable environment, I would not be adverse to take my business elsewhere.  I agree that their ramen is quite good, but since I wasn't totally blown away, I would gladly sacrifice a little taste in favor of a more comfortable meal if I'm going to sweat like a hog eating here.  A Koraku for Daikokuya tradeoff would be an easy call for me if this heat thing proves to be more than an isolated incident.

did my friend tell me my back was fat? noooo.. he was telling me to order the ramen with soup extracted from the back fat. lol (koterri flavor) 4.5 stars... not the best since i prefer spicy ramen but i had to get the original which daikokuya is known for. first spoonful was realllllly good! the ramen was cooked really well. it's not mushy and comparable to what al dente would be for pasta. i used a lot of garlic paste that they have on the table yet it didnt overpower the soup. the pork really does melt in your mouth and the egg is yummy with the soft yolk. the wait was about an hour today. but it was definitely worth it. they have a new ramen where they have the noodles separate but the broth is spicy and sour. i will definitely try it next time :)

Came here in the past a few times ago and definitely this will be the third time, yet I wasnt able to eat it due to the long possibily over 2 hours wait. I would have to say it wasnt bad ramen, but the wait was just ridiculous especially when its hot outside. Theres no free parking and parking alone just waiting for a table would cost you almost $8.00 and depending on where youre parking you might even end up losing your table if you missed them calling your number. Besides that I had good experience with the ramen there, they're just earing a 3 stars from me due to the wait, parking fee that I have to pay and resorting to the other restaurants down the block for a ramen fix.

I thought for sure nothing would beat late night packaged ramen meals, until I had my first taste. Like a bullet to the brain it hit me, and immediately all 5 senses were at DEFCON 1. I had no chance against the fatty, savory, salty foe that attacked me. Quoting some guy from Anthony Bourdain, 'Broooooth' is such a nice word. It just rolls off the tongue. The broth itself could probably satisfy your hunger needs; its pretty thick and hearty. Definitely request the kotteri flavor, which if I remember correctly, is some magical thing they harvest from the back fat of some kind of animal. Sorry about the lack of detail, I was still reeling from that first bite. The fried rice I requested with the ramen had bits of crab and had that nice char from the hibachi grill. All that was missing after the meal was someone sticking a fork in me, b/c i was Dunzo (Kuduro).

Every time I visit Little Tokyo in LA I drive past by this restaurant and always see a long line of people. So I've been very curious to see how good their ramen is. After waiting in line for over 60 minutes on a Friday afternoon, we finally sat down and ordered their ramen and fried rice combo. The ramen, I think, is good but is not worth waiting in line for that long. The fried rice is really good though, and the fat is just right cause fried rice tends to be more greasy. I think I've had better ramen in the San Jose bay area inside a Japanese supermarket. If the wait were less than 30 minutes I would say give it a shot but over 60 minutes is not worth it.

my first ramen experience! walking in at 1230pm on a saturday night is bound to get you stares. the rude kind. the ones that make you cry in a corner. so i'll remember to never to that again... but how amazed was i when i didnt have to wait for a table? ha ha, says i. lets just talk about the decor for a second... old school japanese advertisements? freakin sweet. i wish i had some at my pad. and lets mention the uniforms... it just screams non-american, also freakin sweet. ok so... menu is basic. i dont remember anything but the ramen portion of the menu because, spluh, thats what you come here to eat. after downing packets of easy-make ramen for the latter portion of my life, i had high expectations for the real home made stuff. jesuschrist. talk about huge. the bowl was bigger than my face! fat long squiggly noodles, bamboo shoots, slabs of pork, bean sprouts(?), a marinated egg, and green onions swimming in the creamiest broth ive ever tasted. but that was just it, it was creamy. it wasnt the complex flavor i was looking for, so maybe next time i'll ask for the saltier version, something about back-fat or whatever. the ONLY reason i knocked a star off was because i really didnt like the noodle so... chewy. thats probably the way its suppose to be, but, i would have rather had it a little more well done. my bf ordered a ramen combination, and my eyes popped out of my head when i saw that it was oyakadon... ugghghhhladthwelihf. that has to be favorite meat and rice bowl (actually, its tonkatsudon... but close enough) and it was so damn good, especially for a noodle house. of course i ate half when i had absolutely no room in my body for it. tips? go late a night or for an early lunch. if you try to get there around "dinner" time youre going to be waiting with everyone else. plus, i literally just pulled into a parking spot on the street, how convenient is that? if youve got a small stomach for noodles like i do, split a combo with a friend. i'm definitely doing that next time. and dont arrive dressed like a stripper, youll get worse stares than i did simply because you look like a ho.

Since we were literally right around the corner from Jtown (coming from the CMYE) it was very much the duh factor that we were going to stop to get some serious grub on.  It was cold, so naturally I had an instant craving for ramen. Thank goodness we were in the right district. I had seen Daikokuya in the sad little food court at the Marukai in Costa Mesa, but hadn't had the will to try it (mostly because there were always zero people there). So as we were cruising down the street, I decided why not try it in the belly of the beast. The ramen would probably be more bomb...cause I mean...it's Jtown. It was 6:30pm on a Sunday night and the place was PACKED. We're talking name on the second sheet packed. Actually, it wasn't all that bad. Yes it was freezing, and yes I had forgotten a jacket that night, but was it worth the wait? Um yes. All the way high five. It is not a secret that I pretty much suck at eating noodles, and yes I'm guilty of drinking the broth. I'm a liquid sodium fanatic. I had heard the broth was pretty of the yum, as well as the shredded pork bowl. Since we had been waiting outside for a good amount of time, by the time we ordered I made the mistake of ordering a bowl for myself. The boy ordered a combo with the shredded pork so we could both have a taste. And yes, the broth was fantastic. It seemed that there was a whole stalk of green onions chopping in there as well along with two handfuls of beansprouts. I was in heaven. And don't get me started with the ginger that sits at each table. Broth, beansprouts, green onions and ginger - I could eat that for days. And of course I tried the noodles. They had a perfect balance of not being super soft and at the same time definitely picked up a hint of the flavor in the broth. Of course I barely finished a quarter of it, and the boy and I traded bowls. At least it wasn't going to waste. Plus I had other things to work on...like the pork shredded bowl. Rice, a little dash of shredded nori, green onions, ginger and shredded pork with sauce that was very reminiscent of eel sauce. GOSH. Let me get a spoonful more of that. Yelpers had it right when they threw the recommendation out, and sadly we did miss out ordering the fried rice (which was also in a handful of reviews as well). Each bowl of ramen will set you back about 10 bucks. Each combo is about $1-2 more. For both of us, incredibly way to full it came out to $21. And we had leftovers. The service is fast, the lines are long, but the food is satisfying. We'll be back. I don't even have to think twice about this one.

I know that many people swear by daikokuya, but i'm still on the santouka bandwagon. i'm not saying daikokuya is bad by any means, its still one of the best places to get ramen. the pork broth is pretty amazing, especially when you put a bunch of grated garlic in the broth (i'm korean). but when i eat ramen, i like a simple clean broth with perfectly cooked noodles.  if you want a kick in your ramen, order the kotteri: pork broth with pork fat added to it. i usually get the combination of salmon roe rice with ramen and call it a day. I wanted to give this restaurant a four because of my love for santouka, but i couldn't bring myself to do it. the ramen here is too good for a four star rating, but if i had to rate the line to get into the restaurant i would have to give it 0 stars.

Daikokuya deserves all the high praises that yelpers have been giving it.   This Ramen is some of the best we've had to date.  They serve great food and serve them in giant unhealthy American size portions!  The amount of Ramen shocked us.  My boyfriend couldn't stop smiling because his bowl was filled with noodles. The bowl was more like a giant serving dish!  Easily the most noodles we've gotten at a Ramen house. The noodles were everything we wanted them to be: thick, chewy, and abundant.  And it didn't stop there,  the broth was excellent!  We decided to add the additional koterri flavor to the broth to kick up the fatty pork taste and it was goooood. The broth actually had a nice creamy texture to it.  It's hard to describe just how good it was.  As for the meat, it was good, but not the best. Personally we would say Santouka in Costa Mesa has the best pork slices around. We would say the only questionable part of the dish was the shear amount of green onions.  Daikokuya seems to cover and smother anything they make in it. In addition to the Ramen, we tried the fried rice, shredded pork belly bowl, eel bowl, goyza, miso soup, and salad. They were all top notch! Really tasty and all well above average (sans all that green onion!) The additional stand out to us besides the Ramen was the shredded pork belly bowl.  It was delicious, and extremely hard to put down.  That's why we almost started to cry when we realized we forgot our leftovers!!! We were saving it since the Ramen was so filling :( Overall the food, decor, ambiance, service, and experience was great.  We don't know if we're willing to sitting through another 1 1/2hour wait again just for lunch but were extremely happy we got to try it out!

I tried this place one day because i needed a quick spot in downtown LA to take a friend for lunch and i saw that Daikokuya was very popular. I had the ramen (fancy i know) and it was good. Now with that being said, i dont know if ive ever had bad ramen? But i will say that ive had ramen from other places that were more memorable. Is Daikokuya worth standing in line for 20-30 minutes on a hot summer day just to eat inside where there is no Air Conditioning? Ehhh maybe not but then again im not a Ramen expert so i am sure some will disagree with me.

I decided I needed a great bowl of soup on a cold, rainy evening.  I have been here before, but I had never really appreciated the great taste of Daikokuya.  The line was really long but worth the wait.  I ordered a combination of the ramen and the katsu-don bowl (pork cutlet bowl).   I was really happy as both of the dishes were good.  The ramen was especially great.  The soup has a really good base and the pork is really tender.  Trust me, you can't go wrong by going to Daikokuya.  If you go to any other ramen shop, your head will explode trying to decide which flavor of ramen to get.  But since Daikokuya only has one kind of ramen, you won't be disappointed.

Daikokuya has some pretty solid Donkotsu Ramen! Okay, so.. before you go to any ramen place.. do your homework. Depending on what kind of food you like to eat (salty, greasy, bland, light) you'll have to go to the right Ramen place. Ramen is not all the same. So it does not make sense to compare two Ramen places if they are known for different types of ramen. Daikokuya for example serves only Donkotsu, while let's say Koraku serves all different sorts of ramen (Shio, Miso, Shoyu). Each ramen has its own unique flavor. Shio (Salt) Ramen is very light, and not too savory or salty (ironic huh?) while miso can be on the saltier side with complex flavors. Donkotsu Ramen's broth is made by simmering pork bone for a loooong time so the calcium from the bone leaks out and makes the broth white. It is very savory and has alot of flavor and richness. However, it can make the broth be a little heavy or too rich for some people. In terms of Donkotsu Ramen I have to say Daikokuya is one of my favorite places to go. And I do agree with most of the reviewers in that I think Santouka(serves Asahikawa style Tonkotsu.. mixed with seafood broth) has better ramen (by a tad). However, I prefer Daikokuya because it is its own restaurant while Santouka is part of a food court. So I don't mind losing a very slight bit in taste for the feeling that I'm eating in an actual restaurant. (Santouka is still great when I'm with a bunch of people and not all of them want ramen since we are in a food court). The Tonkotsu ramen at Daikokuya gives me a huge food coma after and my body feels heavy after (but then again I finish all the soup too..) so I try not to have it too often, but it is still great ramen nontheless! The ramen is cooked just right and does not stick together, or gritty (undercooked). And they cook it very well that it does not leave a bad taste after. Cooking Ramen noodle takes technique to cook it right, but also to make sure that the noodle has all the extra flour washed out properly while boiling. If not, it'll leave a weird taste at the end (almost like the feeling you ate something sulfurous) If Daikokuya feels heavy or greasy or too salty, I suggest you go to a different Ramen house that has Shio Ramen. Daikokuya Ramen is a Tonkotsu soup base flavored using soy sauce (so it's basically very similar to the Shoyu Ramen at Santouka).

Got home from work around 10 on Tuesday night and I was pretty hungry so me and the gf decided to give Daikokuya a try since they were open late and it had so many great Yelp reviews. After a five minute drive with nothing but green lights, we arrived in Little Tokyo around 10:45pm and easily fround free parking. We walked over to Daikoyua and put our names on the list. There were about 10 people ahead of us and I couldn't believe how crowded it was for a Tuesday night. The wait was only about 15 minutes and we were soon seated in a booth made for two. I loved the atmosphere inside. It had a vintage downtown Tokyo feel to it (or how I imagine downtown Tokyo might have been about 50 years ago). Very warm and cozy inside. The crowd all seemed alive and excited to be eating there so late at night. We ordered the gyoza appetizer and 2 of the main ramen bowls with Kotteri flavor added. The gyoza came within five minutes and were nice and crispy and served with green onion. I've never had gyoza like this before and found them to be unique, hot, and delicious. Soon after came the 2 huge bowls of ramen. What can I say that hasn't already been said by the majority? The ramen was absolutely delicious!! The broth was rich, flavorful, and hearty while the noodles were firm yet seemed to melt in my mouth. The chashu pork was so tender and mouth-watering. Simply put, the perfect bowl of ramen. Sorry Santouka. I still have a lot of love for you and will still visit you from time to time, but Daikokuya has immediately replaced you as my favorite ramen. Don't worry, you are still my number two!! I rarely give five stars on my first visit, but Daikokuya easily deserves it!!

believe the hype!! this place is legit. their famous original ramen noodle soup is a MUST TRY. totally great bargain too. for those indecisive (greedy) eaters, you can combine a bowl of ramen with a side of chicken teriyaki or eel or tempura, etc. all for the low price of 10-12 bucks. the pork in the ramen is UH-MAY-ZING. so soft and tender and juicy. mmmm...and the boiled egg! they get the yolk texture so perfect...not overly cooked and just the right amount of "wetness" ok, this is sounding weird...but yeah, good stuff. the lines can be a bummer but i definitely think it's worth the wait.

I actually liked their ramen, I found it to be pretty darn tasty.  But while eating a little roach ran right up the wall beside me.  So i lost my appetite and never went back.  This was over a year ago, maybe they've cleaned up their act but they've lost my business for good.   I always find that any restaurant that can't seem to get one of those little "A" stickers on their window should kick their act up a few notches.

This was my first non-Maruchan ramen experience and what can I say? I love it! Always worth the wait. I crave the egg and the broth very often. I missed it after I moved to OC but what a delight, I found one in Marukai in Costa Mesa! So yeah, it's amazing, I don't know what those other people are talking about with only 2 stars. Shinsengumi is wonderful but it's different. That's all I have to say about that.

Daikokuya has some great ramen! The broth is flavorful, the pork is cooked til tender, the egg is perfect and not dry but not runny, and the ramen isnt too soggy. The inside is pretty tiny. I wouldn't suggest going with more than 4 people. They don't take reservations or to-go orders. You go sign in on the clipboard in the front and wait. I've been there many times and the wait time varies. I've waited as little as 5 minutes or as long as 40. IMO, the best time to go is before the huge dinner rush (before 5pm). The ramen is a good size and could be a meal on its own... but I usually get the combo for a couple dollars more. I love their eel or tuna bowl! Their service is usually quick and friendly. However, during my most recent visit, I swear they were trying to rush us out. I counted at least 6 times they asked if we were done. Ok I understand you're trying to get more people in and out... but I wasn't even done with half my food yet!

Was there on early Saturday after I visited the Murakami at MOCA.  Quite disappointed because the soup base tasted totally different than before, lighter and not as good.  The price went up as well to $8.5.  My first few visits I would give it a 5 star rating, but now I probably won't go back unless I have no choice as there are many other good places around this area.  Maybe it was just that day, but ... it happened to me, and I don't like it.  I call it "a soup base that lost its soul".  Without soul, it is just... just... mediocre.  You can tell that I am really disappointed.

The definition of a JAPANESE ramen restaurant. The place is small and decorated in retro Japanese advertisements and movie memorabilia. The service is quick and so is the food. The ramen is just the way I like it. Not too salty and not too oily. The broth is packed with flavor and the texture of the noodles is just "PERFECT."

nothing i'm gonna say is something you can't read from the other 1500+ yelpers. for classic tonkatsu ramen, this place is one of THE best. the broth is truly amazing here. they cook it all day in a huge pot to produce a flavor that's rich and tasty. i'm not sure that it's worth an hour wait though. when you're starving, an hour is the end of the world. minus one star for that. what helps pass the time when you're waiting is the amount of random stores you can find nearby. your best bet is to kill time at the bookstore. or once, we were entertained by a bunch of people in costume that came from an anime convention. you can see some pretty nutty things in little tokyo. suffice to say, the ramen here IS good. there's no question about that. the only thing that still puzzles me: is this place pronounced dai-KO-ku-ya or dai-ko-KU-ya? i never know where the emphasis is placed.

BEST RAMEN EVER. Out of Ajisen, Orochon, and other Japanese restuarants, Daikokyua in Little Tokyo is the BEST I've ever had. I heard it's the pots they use - that they've been used so much that there's a lot of flavor absorbed into them that gets released when they use the pot. And that's why apparently the other Daikokuyas aren't as good. I don't know. I just know that this ramen is worth the 1.5 hour wait in line and the horrible parking in Little Tokyo.

Went here for the first time with a couple of friends and it was a pretty chill place. I thought this was an all out ramen place, but when I opened the menu they only had one type of ramen & I was a little disappointed at that. Obviously we came for ramen so that's what we ended up getting. The portion size was huge for the price & I ended up sharing it and still got pretty full from it. The hot sake was pretty good their too. Would go back, but it wouldn't be my first choice for a ramen spot.

My ramen search has ended. I think I have tried all the ramen spots I heard about and will make a list soon.... Anyways, back to the ramen @ Daikokuya: I was pretty happy I did not have to pay extra for the soft-boiled egg, mushrooms, bean sprouts, lots of noodles, etc. Everything was in the bowl! And I finished EVERYTHING, well except for the remaining broth I just could not slurp up no longer! I usually don't order an egg in my ramen because it fills me up, but I'm glad I was able to finish all the solid stuff in my bowl of ramen. I really liked how the ramen did not make me sleepy (which means there is NO MSG in this ramen...like @ Satouka...:coughs:) Also, I liked how the noodles were cooked freshly and just the way I like it, al-dente! IT's true...there is a line...even during lunch @ 1pm.  Thank goodness I was a party of 1, but I still had to wait a good 10 minutes to be seated @ the bar area. Overall, I personally still think Shin Sen Gumi is still my #1 Ramen Spot in L.A....and Daikokuya takes #2!!! :D

Daikokuya has been one of my staple food groups for quite some time now. The LA location is where it's at. I can smell it now..... Daikokuya's ramen is solid. Their kotteri broth will send your taste buds floating away down a river of delicious pork richness on velvety smooth bubbles of fat toward a food coma bliss. Ramen aside, Daikokuya makes some mean fried rice. Everyone and their mothers knows how to make fried rice. But Daikokuya's is special, pork magical. The rice always comes out fluffy in a nice mound of corn, egg, onions, scallions and who could forget those little bits of joy, chunks of kurobuta chashu pork. The fattiness of the pork seeps out into the grains of rice, which soak it up and become little porky pillows in your mouth. Daikokuya serves up hugs in bowls. I recommend getting the combo and if you're a light eater take the fried rice to go -- pour a spoonful of that kotteri broth over it before you put it in the box, then the rice will be just as moist when you heat it up the next day. If you're hungry and willing to wait in line for an hour or go at an off time, go get yourself some of that pork lovin'.

i came here after a good night of the drunk and i have to admit that my eyes were much bigger then my stomach. i ordered the ramen combo with a side of oyako don. i was getting pretty full half way trough the ramen but in some sort of retarded self imposed test of manhood i powered through the rest of the noodles and went after the rice bowl. when all was said and done i was so full i didnt even want a cigarette! WTS!? i mean there isnt anything better then a square after a meal, right folks? but no, i actually felt the need to walk around and digest! and this coming from a guy who usually wants to sit, unbutton his jeans, and have an espresso and a smoke. daikokuya made me feel like doing something healthy and productive... for shame! im not a big fan of the ramen craze. dont get me wrong, its good, but i dont think its that good. and i personally think, as with much japanese food, its a little pricey for what it is.

This place left me at a loss for words.  I cannot believe people think this is the best ramen they've ever tasted.  Look, I've gone to a lot of ramen places and this place is no better and in some ways even worse than some of those joints.   I still like the broth much better at both Shinsengumi and Santouka.  One thing I will admit though---the pieces of pork floating on top of the ramen are unbelievably tender and tasty.  I could've made a meal out of that alone, it was so good.  But really, the pork bones being boiled for 2 days or whatever doesn't add much flavor to the broth.  Besides the ramen, I've tried the fried rice (greasiest stuff on the planet, after a while all the lard comes out), sausages (pretty good), and CA rolls (nothing special).  If you're in the area and there's no wait, it's a pretty good deal but don't waste your time if there's a line.

i have been here 2 times and yes i can definitely tell the difference between good ramen and bad ones. Here, they take their time into making their broth tastes so different from the rest. Its not bland or watered down like some places. their ramen noodle has great texture, not too chewey n not too dry. the only thing that sux iz dat don't substitute any of the ingredients that comes with it. my favorite is still SANTOUKA ramen. but here is definitely one of the top ramen place i favor. the wait is rediculously long on the weekends so be aware! but if u have never tried it...it's worth the wait!

Today I start Part 1 of  what I will call "The Soup-er" Files - dedicated to the seldom discussed and only for the TRUE foodies specialty sub category - soup;   Bottom Line: Who makes it and where to get it. Anyone who knows me, knows I am a Soup Junkie.  Soup for breakfast, soup for lunch, soup for dinner. I'll make a HUGE pot and eat it all day everyday for a week. There in lies the problem...homemade is the only REAL soup and GOOD soup takes forever to make. So, when you get the itch and you don't want to wait HOURS or all day (if you make soup like I do) and, like any good junkie, when you get that "I Gotta have it" itch you need to get your fix IMMEDIATELY...and bad soup is like a bad trip.   So were to go? What is commonly referred to, by those who know, as  "one of the best ramens ever"...and that's saying a LOT!...is in Little Tokyo, easily identified highlighted by a bright yellow awning on 1st street near MOCA (and the infamous Mr Ramen) is  one of my new found favorites -  "Daikokuya  - Original Noodle & Rice."  . This is exactly what you want out of a Ramen shop.  A small, no nonsense Japanese noodle shop that, when you walk in, you automatically know the routine; you automatically see the sheet; you sign your name and sit and wat for a table or a seat at the counter.   CAVEAT: Do not be scared off by how busy it is.  This place is ALWAYS packed, but the wait is seldom any longer than 10-15 minutes (except maybe near noon - expect 30 minutes) Also, this joint ain't that big so more than 5 and you're all sitting at separate tables or you can all wait to sit at the counter together (which, once I imagined it in my head - sounds cool).  However, I have good Daikokuya Ramen karma and haven't waited more than 5 minutes. Another thing about Daikokuya is that the menu is the menu and its a simple menu.  There is what there is.  Luckily its all really good. Now, if you are a Ramen expert like me you know you can get an extra egg or onions, but don't ask for anything out of the ordinary (pastrami) or they will smile and move on until you have decided what from THEIR menu you want.   For me its easy: , Edamame, Deep Fried Spicy Tuna Roll and Gyoza + Daikokuya Ramen which is ALL made fresh in THAT store. The Fried Spicy Tuna Roll is ground spicy tuna, wrapped in a leaf (like cabbage) and deep fried in a tempura batter. The words OH MY GOD can not begin to describe the delicious evil that this Deep Fried Spicy Tuna.  Not too heavy, not un spicy, not un delicious.  I am always tempted to order two orders but the in store made, pan fried, pork and vegetable Gyoza reminds me that variety is better. I also recommend the Tonkatsu crunchy fried pork cutlets. No...not health food. I had a few bites of each of the appetizers and lo and behold I was delivered the Pièce de résistance, their amazing Daikokuya Ramen.  Why is it so amazing and/or famous? According to legend, Daikokuya begins making their process, with all the love and dedication you see in Ramen movie "Tanpopo" (yes, I know the SOUP movies). The night before, they pre-boil their pork in to a reduction entity (only word that fits).  From that point its ready and waiting for you to order it and for the geniuses behind the stove to add all the Daikokuya goodness and infused with their own 'secret blend' of miso soy sauce.  In to the completed broth goes boiled chijire style egg noodles (you can ask for soft or aldente...I never mess with their natural groove an eat what they give me), Kurobuta pork chashu (and if you have never had chashu at Daikokuya, you have never had it right), marinated hard boiled egg (wicked good), bamboo shoots, green onions and a sprinkle of sesame seeds. I think that Daikokuya may sub consciously NOT want to be Mr Ramen and lays back on the salt, which is fine by me, because I like to soy sauce salt to taste...and add chili powder for that WOW and "Lavanta Muerte" (Raise The Dead) hang over soup style. VEGGIE ALERT:  This is a great choice for vegetarians - but YOU HAVE TO MENTION you are a Veg and you'd like the cold noodles without meat (they come with pork and ham, as well as eggs.)...still REALLY good and this is also a good summer version if you want the taste but not the heat. There is an entire menu of Rice bowls and combos that I have never been able to get to and I will try eventually, but, again, when my RA (Ramen Anonymous) monkey starts beating me over the head with a japanese soup spoon, I make a bee line for Daikokuya. FINAL TIP:  While you;re waiting for your food, look around at people who are finishing their meal.  This is a REAL Japanese style joint where good ramen is NEVER to be wasted. You drink even the broth....SLUUURRRRRRRRRP!

If the only ramen you know can be prepared in under 3 minutes you are missing out! With that being said there are a lot of Japanese ramen houses that serve amazing ramen you can eat every week. Daikouya's ramen IS good, just not as great as people tell me but then again maybe my sxpectations were set too high because that could happen when all your friends tell you, and I quote "daikokuya is the best ramen I've had outside of Japan". Yeeah, pretty hard to live up to that. The prices are a little higer than other places, servings are huge though and the pork bowl with side salad is indeed delectable. Service I must say is also better than I expected for such a busy place. We went at 4pm just to avoid the rushes so choose ur time wisely! I really did enjoy it here but it just didn't seem to me worht the one hour stuck intraffic :(

I'm not going to say there's always a line.  One time I came just a little after midnight on a Saturday night and I didn't wait at all.  However I have waited every other time, sometimes as long as an hour, and it's always been worth it.  You gotta feel sorry for all the neighboring restaurants that make the same damn thing but stand empty while Daikokuya overflows.  Then again maybe they just sprang up to take advantage of that overflow.  I tried one of the neighbors once when Daiko was closed and it was nowhere near as good.  And the fried rice?  People forget about how great it is, completely an equal of the ramen.

hands down the best ramen to be had in LA. the pork broth they use tastes like it was slowly brewed for hours and hours. simply delicious! i was tempted to give them four stars because the wait for a table can sometimes be up to 1.5 hours. but thats not their fault. and its just a testament to how great their ramen is. so five stars it shall be!!!

Hands down the best ramen in LA.  The broth here is just different.  I've tried both the regular and the extra fatty version.  I enjoyed both, although you feel like death after eating the fatty broth.   My friend who tried a lot of places in Tokyo told me that the fatty version tasted just like the authentic stuff so you know that its legit!

A bit tight here but definitely a must visit.Let me tell you off the back. If you see people waiting outside, that's atleast a 45minute wait. I'm not a ramen fanatic but this is definitely one of the better bowls that I've had. There was a misunderstanding when we ordered our food and they brought out two extra bowls of ramen. After clarifying our order, the waitress simply took back the two extra bowls without making any fuss (but who knows what went on in the kitchen). Overall, had a great lunch, I'd definitely go back for more. hopefully there's no wait.

Good ramen, maybe slightly inferior to Shin Sen Gumi. The lack of 5 stars is because of restaurant inefficiency. They do not have a good system of moving customers through, and the servers are understaffed for how busy it is. Consequently the line (there is always a line!) moves at about 1/2 the pace of Shin Sen Gumi's.

lots of good reviews and hype from friends so i decided to try it out... saturday around 2pm. should be no line right? no... i was wrong again. i hate lines. to me, nothing is worth waiting in line for... i guess because of my little complusiveness... i get a bit antsy. what i hate more than lines... is rain. so i had rain + wait... luckily i wasnt starving, just very antsy. waited for about 45 min? felt like 2 hours but i'm sure it wasnt. the 2 of us got to sit in the booth, i felt pretty good after that (easily pleased i know). they gave us cabbage salad that i thought was really good. must be the onions somewhere in the dressing... yummy!!! i got the ramen with tonkatsu donburi, he got ramen with fried rice. tonkatsu donburi was pretty good. probably the best i've had in the states. quality and taste. ramen was OK. it was better than the others i've tried yes... but was it worth the wait? NO. i hate waiting!! :)  if it was as good as the ramen in japan... maybe i would be ok with waiting a tad bit... but i probably wouldnt come back here again if i knew there would be a wait... i sound pathetic. if you dont mind waiting... then id recommend it. come here rather than shinsengumi or fofo tei... :)  a bit more authentic i think.

The best ramen I've ever had was at a random noodle shop in oahu, but Daikokuya ramen comes pretty close.  The noodles were just ok (mine were a little on the undercooked side), but it's the soup and that oh-so-juicy, melt-in-your-mouth pork belly that really does it for me.  If you've read my reviews, you know that I love love love pig meat.  (It's the best meat there is and I wish my ramen had more pieces of it).  Daikokuya pork is really flavorful and tender and goes well with the steaming, flavor-rich broth.  Yum.

A little disappointed with the soup.  It seems some parts of the soup was not as hot as other spots.  This was the first time I have ever a noodle soup like that.  My girlfriend said it was because they put in vegetables or slices of meat that were not uniformly the room temperature.  Maybe they just got it out of the frig and mixed it.  Don't know, it's not bad, but I wouldn't wait in line for this.

A friend and I went here after seeing an exhibit on Star Wars costumes at FIDM in downtown L.A.  This place was less than two miles away.  I saw nothing but top reviews on Yahoo, so I wanted to go there.  They have only one kind of broth, but it was very tasty.  You can also get a combo with a small rice dish (like a mini donburi), so I got ramen with a tempura donburi.  Excellent tempura as well!  My friend just got a rice bowl with pork, since he prefers rice over noodles.  I had a taste of his pork and had really wished I got that too.  The pork was so tender and just melted in my mouth!  For me, this is a really far place to go to for ramen, so I would already need to be in the neighborhood for something, like a concert at the Staples Center, or if I ever go back to FIDM for another exhibit.

So my Daikokuya cherry has finally been popped. I always wondered why the line is always hella long..now I know. The hubby and I went around 4:15 in the afternoon, so there was no line..perfect! We started out with the goyza and I ordered the Daikokuya ramen and he had the shredded pork bowl. Holy crap! That was the best ramen EVER! It was so creamy, fatty, and oh so comforting :) And the salad that comes with it..oh my..so yummy.  I was concentrating so much on my own dish, that I kinda forgot about the pork bowl.  But the hubby said he was very happy with it.  Next time, I think I'll get a combo..perhaps with the eel bowl. Oooh, can't wait to go back!

Finally visited this place after wanting to go for a long time.  Enjoyed the Kotteri style ramen and was not disappointed.  The pork is to die for and as smooth as silk.  The marinated soft boiled egg was the best ever.  The broth was flavorful and not too salty.  The ramen noodles was cooked to perfection.  Also enjoyed a sushi appetizer.  The staff was friendly and the service was quick.   I will return here again, no doubt.

Daikokuya's signature pork-ramen dish was very tasty, and I would totally recommend the ramen. However, when asked if I would recommend this restaurant to my friends, I'd have to say no. The wait was long to get a table, and they don't have room for large parties (we had 5 and our options were to all sit at the counter or squeeze into a booth meant for 4 people).

The ultimate ramen I've had so far..  My first review ever in yelp and I dedicate it to Daikokuya.  This place is small so dozens of people would be waiting outside.  Waiting can be quite long but always worth it for me.  Since my introduction to the place I've been delighted bringing family members and friends to this place;  all became regulars of course and been going here behind my back without me...  Depending on the weather I would take Daikoku Tsukemen on hot days or just the good old ramen on cold days or those times when I have the sniffles.  You can never go wrong with gyoza, delish.  Overall good place.  I love my waitress S.. she's awesome.  I even saw my doctor here, he's officially cool in my book :).

i don't know that i can call daikokuya the best ramen in LA (i have to try a few more places first), but i was definitely impressed with my meal there last week. after waiting almost an hour at 8 pm on a tuesday night (we were starving so after putting our name down on the list, we made a unilateral decision to go get some appetizers a few doors down and made it back in plenty of time), we were finally seated at the bar with huge cauldrons of steaming broth in full view. having had plenty of time to contemplate the menu during our prolonged wait, we promptly ordered the roasted pork belly appetizer and two half-size bowls of the daikoku ramen kotteri style (extra rich broth). btw they only have two types of ramen -- hot or cold. they also offer several combinations involving ramen + something else. the roasted pork appetizer came out and it was heavenly -- slices of kurobuta pork belly that were so tender and flavorful, topped with tons of green onion and a tasty sauce. i saved a few pieces to eat with the ramen, which appeared soon after. the ramen was good, though i have to say i was expecting slightly richer broth (which also could have been hotter, temp-wise). gimme more umami! i think i liked the tonkotsu broth at santa ramen in san mateo a tad better. the noodles were nicely springy and al dente but i wish they were a little thinner. the half bowl ended up being the perfect size. my friend and i were impressed by the perfectly boiled egg that came in the broth. IIRC there were also a few pieces of pork, sprouts, bamboo, and green onions. next time we will try a few of the other appetizers, because they looked amazing, especially the gyoza.

Given that the ramen options in the DC metro area are severely limited and that I'm not that big a fan of Wagamama, I would have to say this is one of the best bowls of ramen I've had.  I still have to make it out to Japan at some point.  I know a lot of people say, "no ramen place should ever get 5 stars...it's ramen".  Yeah well, suck it. I ordered up gyoza and a bowl of the kotteri flavor daikoku ramen.  My friend ordered the regular daikoku ramen.  The gyoza was good...the dumpling skin nicely crisped while there was no skimping of the pork and vegetable filling.  However, the star of the show is obviously the ramen.  The kotteri version is fattier and saltier than the regular which are things that I prefer when eating ramen.  The noodles were just the right consistency, not overly chewy while also not disintegrating at first touch.  The pork had the right amount of fattiness I was looking for and the egg had that nice runny center that makes eggs worth eating.  I definitely made sure to get every last drop of that broth into my mouth.  A bowl like this runs for around 12-13 dollars in the DC metro area.  Here it was 9 bucks.  Word.  I also got a chance to try Ramune soda.  It's basically a Sprite-like concoction that has an interesting bottle design.  Apparently, you drop a little glass ball from the top of the bottle into the bottle itself.  Interesting.  Although, next time, I'm getting a beer. At 10 minutes prior to opening, a line of 5 people had already formed.  When we finished, there were 8 others waiting for our table.  The key is to get here at opening.  As others have mentioned, the place is pretty small, but then again, it's also designed to be single diner friendly.  You can sit up at the counter, eat your ramen, and go. If you don't like ramen, you won't find anything special here.  If you think there's nothing special about ramen, you won't find anything special here.  But if you enjoy a good bowl of ramen, you can't go wrong with trying this place once.

ramen~ ramen~ ramen~ oh~ japanese ramen... why do you do this to me... why do you make my taste buds jump in joy... why do you make my tummy feel the yummyness, oh why? okay, sorry i was just day dreaming again! this is the best ramen i've had so far... and i still have about 50 years to live. the soup base has a clean, deep, milky flavor of just goodness that you can just tell it has been boiled in bones for a while before it's served up to it's customers. the two or three slices of pork served in it are just so tender that it sort of melts in your mouth. the al dente single serving size noodles are cooked to perfection.  1 min and 45 seconds... never being too soft or too hard. the bamboo shoots are crunchy and so full of flavor. if you don't like this ramen, i don't know what's wrong with you!   price $8.50 for daikoku ramen the only complaint i have about this joint is the freaking waiting list. daikokuya should enhance their business by buying the store next to them that's never really open and just expand. have some sort of parking structure that we can park, LA just sucks when it comes to parking! anyhow, oishi ramen!!!

My GF and i both had the Daikokuya-Ramen and Gyoza now I've eaten at some good Ramen places in my day Shin Sen Gumi, MoMoFoku NY, Santouka Ramen, Ajisen Ramen any of these places Blows Daikokuya out of the water. Lets get to the hart of the problem the noodles were under cooked and almost Top-Ramen Esque there was only 3 small pieces of pork, the soup base was bland and under seasoned & my hard boiled egg was liquid in the middle, oh yah the Gyoza was over fried on one side and doughy on the other. They have bad service a long wait and no air conditioning so on a 90 something day its not that fun being in a place where they cook right in front of you. I'm basicly giving Daikokuya 2 stars because it was food and I didn't vomit.

Came back here in a week...i bet some of you have done worse. The main reason I came back was to finally try the ramen with the kotteri broth and this is my verdict: I feel like if you are here and kotteri is still available, it is a must since it does bring out more of the pork flavor and complements the garlic flavor well. However, I do feel that it is not worth a drive out a week later just to have it. It does not make it that much better. What made this second trip worth while was getting the sliced roast pork appetizer side order (seared kurobuta pork belly chasu with sweet glaze and green onions) Try to look for my pictures. Again like i said in my previous post, pork pork and more pork. It's their specialty and the ramen does a good job of showing that as well. The sliced pork was completely tender and juicy. I loved how the glaze did not over power the dish but the sweetness brought out the flavor of the pork, much like a honey glazed ham does on Christmas dinner. The green onion gave the pork that contrast in color and in texture and added more of its sweetness. Washed down with a cold mug of beer thank You. The other Daikokuya locations do not at all imitate how good the food is here. Don't bother.

I came here about a month ago, knowing nothing much about the place, I just happened to pass it on the street as I was looking for a late lunch/early dinner on a weekday.  I didn't have to wait all that long to be seated, since I was flying solo that day, and grabbed a stool at the bar.  I ordered a Sapporo and a Daikoku ramen.  The ramen itself was pretty delicious.  My only gripe is that it took nearly half an hour for it to arrive.  After reading through a couple of the other reviews, I get it, this place can get pretty busy so having to wait a while is not uncommon.  Seriously though, it was not that busy when I arrived.  Luckily I had that beer to keep me occupied, oh and also the ramen was so dang good, and yes worth the wait.  I would definitely come back again, and thinking about it is giving me unfortunate cravings considering I live in Philadelphia :-(  Until next time, Daikokuya... Not a ton of seating, so expect a wait if you're coming during peak hours.  Restroom is all the way in the back, single stall.

The place from the outside is really nothing special, just your typical hole in the wall mom n' pop shop. The interior decor has it's ramen shop style flavor, with a splash of post world war 2 posters hanging on the walls. Seating is very limited so I would suggest going there before you're hungry, because the wait is long enough where you'll be starving by the time you get seated. All that aside, the food was simply blissful. I've had ramen in japan, and all over J-town and then some, but I seriously have to put down that this is one of the best ramen adventures I've experienced. I ordered the popular combo of Shredded pork on rice + Daikokuya ramen. Going for a hefty $11( I wouldn't know how else to spend that money to equal the amount of satisfaction I got) but you get a small bowl of salad with really good dressing on it (not exactly sure what it's called, but its found in most Japanese style salad dressing, but it had a tang to it like thousand island). The wait for the food was fast, so in no time our party was being served the noodles and shredded pork bowl. Presentation of the food was good, it seemed like a bit of effort was put into it, with my egg at 11, my two pieces of mouth watering pork at 2, and a mountain of green onions in the center. Broth was just right, not too salty not to bland. The noodles can be cooked to your liking (soft, med, hard), and the meat was so juicy and tender, even writing this, my mouth watered a bit. The shredded pork bowl was no different. The meat was so soft, it literally melted in my mouth, with enough teriyaki sauce to really pack a good punch of flavor in your mouth. Definitely a good spot to check out if you are a connoisseur of good ramen. Just be prepared for the wait, and to find parking. There are various parking structures around for a few bucks a hour, or you can try your luck at the metered spots around the streets.

Ramen usually messes me up big time so I try to stay away, but I couldn't resist trying Daikokuya having moved to Downtown LA recently.  Even though I got all sleepy and tired afterward, I thought it lived up to all the hype.  Definitely the best ramen in LA, especially with the teriyaki pork belly combo thing.  Soo good!

I can't get enough of their ramen. The pork is amazing and so soft. It's like BUTTAH. The ramen is great "al dente" quality. It's definitely worth the wait in line and worth the fear of driving past Skid Row late at night.

I would've given this place 5 stars about 2 years ago when I ate here for the first time. I came back to Texas raving to everyone about how delicious the ramen tastes. Then I had ramen in Korea and Japan. Then I came back to try this place for a 2nd time over the weekend. I was really disappointed. Look, I know you can't compare ramen in Asia to ramen in America, but I am!!! Just because I was so impressed the first time I came here, I was expecting to be just as blown away this time around. I wasn't. The ramen is still good, I just think it's a little overrated now... the rice bowls are worth a try and the Charsu is a good start to your meal.

Solid 3.7 stars.. because the wait it REALLY REALLY LONG for a relatively simple bowl of noodles.  BUT the reason this place gets a little higher rating on the scale is because their noodles are really tasty. I will have to try it again cuz the first time it really hurt my tummy after.. but it's good ramen.

I had to go. You have to go. And go early! This place will surely have a line. You do not have to order anything side from the daikoku ramen or tsukemen, except maybe the ramen and small bowl combo. This place gets so hot from all the cooking and people, that the tsukemen is what I'd recommend even on a cold day. Besides, it deals with the noodle issue. While the broth is well raved, I've heard complaints that the noodles get too soggy by the end. The egg was cooked perfectly and the pork was grilled beautifully. With the tsukemen, you can turn it into a vegetarian dish and eat the grilled pork separately with a cold mug of beer. Trust me, grilled pork and beer is one of the best pairings ever. They have only Kirin on draft, but a pitcher is decently priced around $11. The service is brisk, but efficient. My favorite thing about this place is that the entire restaurant smells like fresh cut scallions.

I don't mind the limited menu or the small, stuffy restaurant (the place certainly has charm), but I didn't think the ramen was worth the half hour lunchtime wait (and we got there early!).  The noodles were softer than I prefer, and the broth was very oily.  I'm not a big fan of oil.  Also my hard-boiled egg was cold in the middle.  Weird.  Anyway, I guess it's all a matter of taste.  Personally I like Koraku and Orochon better, but depending on how you like your noodles and broth, your mileage may vary.

I dig this place.  Although some say it's overrated, I enjoy the atmosphere and the food.  Of the ramen shops on first street, this is the only one with people and for good reason.  The broth is excellent and the portions are generous.  Gyozas are good.  I like the added touch with the hard boiled egg.  What I don't like is the wait so If I see a big crowd outside, I'll drive right by and go elsewhere.

A "C" rating graces the front door. . . and yet you walk in and eat some of the best ramen you'll find in all of LA.  This is not high end dining. Just a place to get some good grub. Very sweet servers try hard to be attentive. For about $11 or so - you can get a combo lunch which includes the infamous ramen and another item (I choose the fried rice).  That rice was perfect. Too bad I couldn't finish the whole thing. You may have to drive around a bit or put on your walking shoes to find a parking place that would allow you to dine here, but it's worth it. BTW - the salad that comes with the combo is slammin'.

so i didn't like ramen because it always had a funny taste to me. that is until i had daikokuya. no funny taste! i really like their ramen! although it is the same as the soup ramen, my favorite is the dry summer version of the ramen with the little bowl of soup. their ramen is very flavorful and portions are big. gyoza is good too. if it turned me into a ramen lover, it's THAT good. =P get there early since there is almost always a long wait.

I had to try this place out since they have 1000+ reviews. We weren't able to find any street parking so we had to park across the store where the shopping mall parking structure is ($4 flat rate after 4PM). After riding down the pee smelling elevators, we headed out to Daikokuya. We didn't even have to search where the place was since there was already a line out the door. The place was nice and cozy with lots of japanese style artwork-  there was godzilla I think hanging above the door which i thought was pretty funny. There weren't too many tables considering how popular this place is. The bar was full and the tables were packed. We scribbled our name on the list of paper in front of the door and waited for 45 minutes. I was getting anxious watching what people ordered and smelling the aroma of hot ramen on a cold windy day. I was Sttarvingggggg. Once our name was called we proceeded into a booth. Hands down, we already knew what we were going to order. The Ramen. One I got my ramen I was slightly disappointed. The broth was so greasy and the pork had so much fat on it. Maybe if I put some garlic in here it'd taste better. It did, but still greasy. This is my first time at a japanese ramen place and I'm not sure how exactly japanese ramen is supposed to taste but I wasn't too satisfied. The broth was okay, but I'm used to the shin ramyun or the yook ge jang kind of korean ramyun. The spicy uber taste ramen. I dont think it was worth the effort trying to eat here with the wait and the parking. I'd hate to be the sore thumb that gave only 3 stars but it was okay, not too good, not too bad. To me, it wasn't great, but to each its own. You should definitely come here and try it out, you may love it.

this place brings back memories. this was the place where I had my first bowl or Ramen and I've loved ramen ever since. It's hard to come back here since it's in La, but when I'm in the area, I always stop by. The miso ramen combo with tuna or eel bowl is amazing. So filling and just delicious to the last bite. It's a small place and there's always a waiting list, but it's definitely worth the wait. THe miso or shoyu must be my two favorites, their broth is probably one the best I've ever tasted, light and flavorful, not too much oil. The pork is tender and they give you a pretty good portion. I hope this place stays open forever so I can keep coming back and others can discover their love for ramen.

This is the spot for real ramen. For those who aren't in the know, ramen is like 75% about the broth and 25% about the noodles and all the other ingredients. They have the best ramen broth around by far. They slow cook it for a day before brining a vat of it to the restaurant for the following day and once the broth is gone, they close up shop. Get there early and expect to wait in a line even if you're there before they open...even on rainy days. Acutally...ESPECIALLY on rainy days.

Huh, I'm surprised I never wrote a review for the OG Daikokuya. (I wrote one for the Monterey Park one a while back..) I've been to this one so many times, just because it's close to home. That, and it's convenient for a lot of my friends to all group up in this branch. Wait varies on the day and time you arrived; I've waited for 15 minutes to an hour, just to go into this place. I don't recommend going to this branch for dinner, because it's basically standing in line for the women's restroom times 10. (Sorry if I offended anyone, but that's the only thing I can compare it to, unless you want to compare it to park rides at an amusement park..) The past times I went, there was this one waiter who always said.. "Please enjoy" and my co-workers ALWAYS smiled when he said that. Love the advance technology that use to place orders, but shout out what kind of ramen we order. It's cute to hear the little Japanese girls shouting "Four orders or ramen, two with kotteri, one without spring onions!" (That's not the usual order, but it seems to be the trend of my friends who I go with.) I've always ordered the combo, the ramen (with kotteri) and some small bowl and always finished everything off, sometimes finishing off someone else's salad too. The ramen is always delish. No complaining about it. But if you ever get a chance, try it with the kotteri, even though it's a bit fatty, it gives the noodles and broth extra flavor. Now for the rice bowls (I'm trying to remember my Japanese class and the way to say it in Japanese, which I often tell the waitress..) * Oyako-don (Chicken and Egg Bowl): Pretty simple, just the usual fried up with chicken and onion. They put a good amount of sauce as the topping, but nothing on the rice. * Tonkatsu-don (Pork Cutlet Bowl): Not my favorite. The pork usually comes out all tough and dry, with no sauce. * Ten-don (Tempura Bowl): I agree with some people that the tempura came out a bit soggy, but again, this place specializes in ramen, so it's kind of understandable. * Unagi-don (Teriyaki Eel Bowl): I often get this bowl; has nice flavor and enough eel to keep me happy. * Sashimi-don (Tuna Sashimi Bowl): I got this one recently; five pieces of tuna with sushi rice. Not too bad, but didn't realized the rice was sushi rice, and kind of had to cram all the rice down without any extra topping/flavoring. I believe I also had their summer-only hiyashi ramen before. I don't remember much about it, but if I get a chance to have it again, I'll mention it. A good place to go to, but I would probably go to the Monterey Park one, just because it's a little less crowded.

I'm no expert, but this is easily not only the best Ramen I've ever had, but one of my favorite things to eat, period. Orochon imo is not even on the same level; go there if you want SPICINESS up the wazoo, or a more convenient location for good ramen. For what a Yelper before me described as a "religious experience," come here. I don't have the vocabulary to begin to encompass the deliciousness that is their ramen (and I OWNED my SAT verbals back in the day), so I'll just move on. As good as the food is, getting it is a PAIN IN THE ASS! Parking is hard. The wait is almost always about an hour, unless it's just 1 person. But worth it, and I'll leave it at that. Some lesson commonly mentioned things to keep in mind/what I've learned: * I love browsing the Little Tokyo shops across the street if the wait is pretty long. There's usually something awesome going on if it's a weekend, from public karaoke to street musicians. * But don't go other places too long. I always miss my name/number being called because I am a) not there or b) outside, so I can't hear it. They're pretty forgiving about this though. If you DO miss your name (look on that scratchy sheet of paper with names on it, realize someone scribbled "CALLED" next to it), you will have to track down a harried looking man who looks astonishingly like an Asian Johnny Depp/Captain Jack Sparrow. * I would really recommend the fried rice combo. The "salad" that comes with it is surprisingly savory, and the fried rice is SO, SO GOOD! I feel bad for it because it gets pushed out of the way by Daikokuya's heavenly ramen brother, but it happens. (I've been told their fried eel is really great too. Tempura veggies were okay.) *Think the line will be shorter late at night? WRONG! Earlier or mid-afternoon is your best bet. *Groups bigger than 4-5 are going to be difficult.

Every time I come here there is a line regardless of what time it is. I've always loved their regular pork ramen (with extra fat) and their pork fried rice. No matter how hungover I am I am able to finish everything.

We decided to wait 45 minutes for a good bowl of ramen after reading the Yelp reviews.  We're from the San Francisco Bay Area on our way to San Diego when we dropped by for dinner.  We had the Daikokuya  ramen with the kittoro back fat extract soup base.  The soup was flavorful with the mild pork taste, the noodles were cooked al dente, and the various toppings were decent (whole egg, bean sprouts, green onions).  To be truthful, we have had far superior ramen elsewhere.  By far the best ramen we have ever had is at Ramen Dojo in San Mateo.

Whenever my boyfriend and I decide to have pho we have to go to Little Tokyo to Daikokuya. The pho is very tasty and the helpings are generous. We have also tried the sushi and it is good as well. The service is usually fast and always friendly.  The only downfall is they recently started to only accept cash. Not sure if it was only that day because before they accepted all debit cards.

So, since I donated my time away at a UYE at the Los Angeles Mission and fighting traffic for an hour to get there, when I was done, since I was a few blocks away, I figured I might as well stop in for a bite, since I had only had coffee and a soda so far and it was 3 pm.  I had never had the chance to try this reknowned ramen house. Being famished, I ordered a combo with ramen and katsu-don....since a decent katsu-don is pretty hard to find and I hadn't had it in quite awhile, I went for that.....All in all, this is probly my second favorite ramen that I have had in Southern California to date, the broth was rich, and the noodles delicious.  It's just behind Santouka, but they are quite comparable.  The katsu-don was just not done the same way as my mom made it (though I am holding them to an unreachable standard), the egg wasn't cooked well enough, it had a whole soft boiled egg (they could put that in the ramen,lol), it had no sweetness (guess that is just a preference?), which my mom's had a little of, and the pork in the katsudon was very tough and chewy, which didn't help the dish much...I don't know which version is more authentic  but I'd probly either try something else or just get ramen by itself.   I still need in search of some good Katsu-don, I will probly just have to make some myself. Service was efficient, and tho I can't quite go 5 stars, I'd go 4.5 if I could for the ramen

My most favorite ramen place in LA!! The ramen is simply perfect with the broth. Everyone I've brought here has fell in love with it. Granted the wait is a little long, but it's really worth it. After a huge bowl, you'll leave feeling completely satisfied.  If not, there's always the combination ramen with your choice of fried rice or tuna sashimi and others. I was told the tuna wasn't so great, so stay clear. Otherwise, I highly recommend!

Okay if your in J-town and there is no more than 4 people in your party and you want Ramen then this is the place to go.

there's quite a long wait on a monday afternoon at this place. we waited about 20 mins for 3 ppl and ended sitting at the counter. wat a big big mistake. i warn you! yes...if you're a weaksauce like me, don't sit at the counter! i had my lesson. i guess that place is too small, and it's always packed, ac is not strong enough, and when you sit by the counter, you'll just get steamed by the pot of hot soup boiling infront of you, or get smoked by the grill. it gets even hotter when you start slurping on ur ramen. we were all busy wiping our sweat while everyone else sitting in the back was enjoying their food peacefully. if you're one of those that needs to be comfortably seated in order to eat, wait for the big tables or don't eat there. food wise, there are not that many options to choose from as for ramen. i think 4 kinds total, but with lots of other options like bento box, rice bowls, appetizers and drinks. i ordered the daikokuya ramen with shredded pork rice bowl combo. the ramen was good, tastes authentic and fresh, but not superb. i like the rice bowl more, it's diced grilled pork with a sweet sauce over rice. it tastes even better with the fresh green onion and pickled ginger. btw, i forgot to add that the egg that came with the ramen was great. cooked and marinated perfectly, esp the yolk. environment + parking = -1 star food = 4 stars

just having watched the movie ramen girl with brittany murphy, and the japanese movie tampopo (about ramen making) within the last month, i had a bigger appreciation for the art of ramen. so i decided for the second time to go back to daikokuya, and the second time i was wowed. it's hands-down the best tasting ramen, with the best noodles, and the best tasting broth i've experienced in a while. plus, you can't overlook the authenticity of it all, with the cooks and waiters being all japanese.  while sitting at the bar, it felt and smelt like a different country. i waited for a whole hour, on a sunday afternoon. while time was ticking away, i saw many a patron leaving with wide smiles..and i knew i was in for greatness.  and i was! if you don't know what to get, you can't go wrong with the daikokyu ramen and the fried rice (which has ramen broth in it). both were so scrumptious, i'm sitting here wiping away the drool as i write. (btw, i have tried other ramen places including shin sen gumi, and i find this place a lot better by far)

This place is good, and that's where it ends.  I wish I could take a poll on how many yelp reviewers of Daikokuya have been to Orochon ramen.   But specifically, Orochon shoyu ramen level 5 or 6.  Once you taste that, I guarantee more than half will never go back to Daikokuya again.   I had Daikokuya about 2 years ago and didn't think much of it.  Last week, I went back to Daikokuya thinking maybe my decision 2 years ago wasn't so reliable.  Afterall, my good friend (who has been to Orochon) claimed Daikokuya is better.  You see, here's the problem, my friend Kyoko always gets the spicy miso at Orochon.  Compared to that, Daikokuya tastes better.  She just still hasn't taken my advice and tried the shoyu ramen level 5.  Go to Orochon and try this ramen.  I guess it's all preference...Daikokuya has a lot of oils in their broth.  I guess I like my broth clean and refreshing.

so this is what REAL ramen tastes like.... i had never eaten at an actual ramen restaurant prior to eating at Daikokuya.  being asian, i didn't think it necessary to take up one of my "eat out" nights by going to a ramen house.  for me, the 99 cent ramen packages were satisfying enough. however, with a little bit of prodding from my good foodie friend, i was convinced to try out daikokuya.  after reading the yelp reviews, and visiting their website, i was actually excited to try it out.   anyway, my friend told me that the ramen was "so good," and recommended that i get one of the combination meals in order to get a bite of something other than just the ramen.  i ended up getting the ramen + pork cutlet rice bowl.  i went with three of my girlfriends, and they too got the combination.  we ended up with one ramen bowl each and a pork cutlet rice bowl, terkiyaki eel RB, tuna sashimi RB, and a teri chicken RB.   when the waiter brought out our meals, i was very surprised by the BIG portions.  my friend had told me that the combination was "do-able," and that it wasn't "too much" food.  i'm not sure if she went on an empty stomach, but we had ordered way TOO much food.  it was a bit embarrasing... especially after realizing that the group of guys sitting behind us had ordered way less than we had.  for a group of four, i would recommend ordering two ramen, and three or four small rice bowls.  that would've been perfect for us. the ramen wasn't too bad.  in fact, i really liked the noodles, and thought they were cooked perfectly.  the broth was nothing special, but the char siu was very good.  the rice bowls were also nothing special, but they were good.  i think that the pork cutlet was my favorite.   tomorrow, when i see my friend, i will tell her that Daikokuya is "not bad."  i would probably eat there again, but only if i happen to be i that area.  in other words, it's not worth the visit out to little tokyo JUST for their food.   p.s. a lot of people said that the wait was horrific, but i didn't find it that bad.  we came smack dab in the middle of lunch, 12:15-ish, on a Tuesday afternoon.  although parking was a bi-otch, the wait itself was only a short 15-20 mins.

By far the BEST ramen place in LA.  Ive been around, in more ways than one (jk) looking for a really good ramen joint in LA and its here. The ramen noodles are cooked perfectly, its a lil thick, but thats how i like it (thats what she said). Soup is great. the chashu pork is super succulent. Daikokuya is fairly inexpensive. The only minor problem is parking, its always hard to find free parking in J-town, but they do have parking structures for a small fee, no biggie. Don't waste your time on any other ramen place, go straight to Daikokuya!

There is a reason people are always lined up outside this place, and that reason is Ramen. The Ramen here is so good, it should almost be named something else. When my friend first too me here and told me we were going to have Ramen, I looked at him like he was crazy. Now I understand. This is one of the few places that makes me really sad to have moved away from LA.

My friend and I felt like having some ramen after work. I was down to stay in the nearby LB area, but he suggested we make the trip to Little Tokyo. I said I'd never been to Lil Tokyo for ramen, and he said I was missing out. So we ended up going here. I had no idea this place was so popular. We wrote our names down on some loooong list, and saw that it would take about an hour to be sat, so we decided to walk around and check out some shops around the area, since I wanted to buy some shoes. It started getting late, so we had to rush back and it turned out that we were next on the list. The place is rather small, but there's some coziness to it, I guess. Each of us ordered their signature Daikoku ramen, some gyoza and plum wine. Service was efficient, and it was interesting to sit at the bar area, in front of the large containers full of broth. We got our wine and gyoza quickly, and I noticed that this was unlike your run-of-the-mill frozen-section gyoza. It was crispy outside, chewy inside, and very full-flavored. Not long after, I was able to finally try their ramen. Next to us sat a couple, reading the reviews of this place on Yelp on their phone. I was curious to ask them what people said about this place, but decided against it, so that I could form my own unbiased opinion. I'm no ramen critic, but this is hands down the best ramen I've tried. Rich, full-flavored, and chock full of pieces of pork, bamboo shoots, sprouts, and a large egg. The noodles were "al dente" when the waitress first placed the bowl in front of me, but they slowly softened to perfection with the heat of the broth. All in all, it's a must try. Of course, considering all the outstanding reviews here on Yelp, you might have already guessed that.

I waited about 45 minutes to get me and 2 friends seated together for lunch on a Sunday afternoon, but it was worth every second. This ramen was so good, it's like I went into a trance while I was eating it. I wouldn't doubt it if one of the friends I was with told me that the only words I said during the meal were, "Damn this is so good!". I've been dreaming about this place, and I've even been thinking about flying back to L.A. just to eat that ramen. I might be making this sound too good, but this is just my experience, I suggest you try it for yourself.

We used to come here a lot during college and wait a long time...well, that pales in comparison with how long we waited when came here last...1.5 hours!!! Dannnng. The ramen is good, but I can't say it's worth 1.5 hours of my life. However, the place has the nostalgic feel to it that always makes up for a lot.

Great spot for Ramen but there are other locations throughout the LA area.  I understand that the wait at this location can be very long so if you don't want to wait remember that there are locations in Arcadia, Monterey Park, and Hacienda Heights.  I went to the Hacienda Heights location for lunch during the week and there was no wait.  I've also been to the Little Tokyo location and the food is the same as the other locations.

Always a wait, but in my opinion it's the best ramen in L.A. Our waiter was half Japanese, I think. But he had the weirdest accent! My friend and I are convinced he can speak perfect english, but is faking the Japanese accent. We also heard lapses where it sounded Jamaican! Dining entertainment!

Seriously? You guys like the ramen that much? Not the transcendental experience I was hoping for, which is too bad since I braved a B-grade for sanitation in order to dine here. Just ramen in a pork broth, nothing more, nothing less. Not worth a huge wait, or a major trip though.

My friends and I arrived 30 minutes before the ramen house opened. No problem, we decided to walk around Little Tokyo. When we returned, 5 minutes before the restaurant opened, there was a long line out the door. We had to wait 1 hour to get seated. The motto is, "Eat at the place with the longest line". The "extra fat" ramen is great and the service was fast and friendly. I will honestly say that this place is overhyped a bit. I would rather go to Santouka Ramen inside the Mituswa Market in Torrance, CA.

Wow this place is yummmee.   Never have i appreciated the art of ramen before having some Daikokuya.  Granted, i've always loved soup.  I crave Pho at least twice a week, and ramen, to me, has always been second rate to that Viet staple.  But Daikokuya has got me questioning my tastes now.   The Ramen here is spectacular.  The fried rice just as good.  The only negative was having to stand in line for about a half hour waiting for a table in the tiny place.  Now, i have heard talk (specifically from the group of friends i had dinner with last night), that some low ratings have been posted in the window in the past.  I heard talks of C's.  Ugh...  Normally, anything lower than a B rating screams to me STAY AWAY.  Last night, however,  i was put at ease when I saw the sign reading "B" proudly posted front and center.  Thus, i ate in peace.  And afterward, I experienced what it might be like to be pregnant, my belly was so full.  It was humbling.  But it was all worth it, cause that meal made me sleep so sooo GOOD.

Excellent ramen!  My only complaint is that it was WAY too much food, but I guess that may be a good thing for some people.  I ordered the special -- bowl of Daikokuya ramen with a side dish of sashimi on sushi rice.  Talk about YUM -- the fish was very fresh, and it was a nice combo with the ramen.  The ramen was delicious with generous portions of noodles, and meat -- it could easily be two meals!  I would definitely recommend getting to the restaurant early before they open for lunch -- my boyfriend and I made our way over to Daikokuya, and there was already a line!  We barely made it into the restaurant with the first wave of seats available!  There's nothing fancy or spectacular about the restaurant, but it's definitely a good spot if you want some good food!

I'm only writing a review because my visit to this place last week marked the first time in about two decades that I ate something made of pork. I got the ramen dish where the noodles come separate from the broth, because I was a little wary at first, but soon I dove right in and had most of the broth. And I even tried some of the pork meat!

So a girlfriend of mine was in town from NYC and wanted to try this place...soooo...good friend that I am, I trekked up all the way to Thousand Oaks to pick her up and then drove into J-Town.  Mmmmm...there's nothing better than big, steaming bowl of ramen on a cold night.  This place was great!!!  Sure, we had to wait a little while for our seats, but the friendly and efficient staff seems to keep the customers moving fairly quickly.  If you find yourself in a ramen or rice conundrum (believe me, I was working myself into a tizzy trying to decide)...go for the combo.  The perfect compromise for the noodle and rice connoisseur...

After some seriously high praise from one of my buddies, I was strongly urged to go here the next time I found myself in LA J-town.  And as luck would have it I found myself in the area this past weekend and had to go in to try their infamous ramen.  Now, let it be known, that I LOVE ramen.  I'm talking taking her home to momma because this is the one I want to marry kind of love.  When we arrived on a Thursday night, the place was packed.  We put our names on the list with about 20 names ahead of us and proceeded to wait over an hour and half before we got seated.  Despite our hunger, we managed to entertain ourselves with trips across the street to the little shopping center for some snacks.   By the time we were seated, we all knew what we wanted.  I ordered the kotteiri flavor ramen, because I need that extra porky goodness, along with a side of ikura don, because who doesn't like fish eggs and rice?  We also ordered the kurobuta pork and gyoza because that's how we roll.  The pork arrived thinly sliced and grilled to a nice char on the edges.  It perfectly hit the spot after starving for so long.  It was fatty of course, but still so delicious.  The gyoza were also quite good, piled high with green onions with a delicate but chewy skin and surprisingly flavorful meat filing.  Before long though, the star of the show and the reason we were all there arrived... the ramen.  I can not explain to you the excitement that was bursting within me as I eagerly stared down the noodles and soup.  As I always do, I started with a spoonful of broth, just to taste it unadulterated.  It look creamy with a little bit of fat floating on the surface, but when I took a sip, it didn't command my taste buds like I was hoping it would.  I wanted a broth that was rich and unctuous; a broth that could slap me around and talk dirty to me.  What I got was a lighter, cleaner broth, one that was demure and submissive.  It was good, but not quite what I was looking for.  The noodles were your standard ramen noodles, although I would have enjoyed a little more chewiness and bite to them (though I should have specified that I would like them a little chewier).  I did enjoy the mountain of green onions and more of the thinly cut chashu which provided some of the richness I was looking for.  The ikura don was a perfectly fine ikura don.  Tons of ikura and the rice was well seasoned.  However, going back to the ramen, I was just a little disappointed.  I was expecting greatness, perhaps even epicness like that which I had  at Ippudo in NYC.  Instead, what I got was just good and unfortunately in this case, good just wasn't enough.

it's not that great here, the only thing i like are the rice bowls. the quality of the ramen at santoku is 1000 times better. the ramen here can't even compare to the ones i've had in japan. the pork broth is sooo dense that it ruins the taste of the noodle itself, kinda like a cover-up or something. the art of ramen loses its purity at this place. but yummmmm on the oyako-don and ikura-don! (but then i guess you can't really mess up on those)

What can I say that the other 2 thousand fine folks on Yelp have yet to say?  Without venturing into each and every review, I'll try to help you out with some key facts that might help you make a decision as to whether it's worth driving / waiting for this place. (1) the food is worth waiting for about 1.5 hours if the weather is cold.  About 45 minutes if the weather is normal. (2) The ramen noodles are usually al dente, so if you like mushy noodles this place isn't for you. (3) The combo meals are the way to go - I've only tried the pork katsu, chicken & egg bowl, and the friend rice.  All very, very good. (4) You're paying about 14-15 bux w/ tip per person.   (5) Not a great place to go if you want to have a nice quiet dinner - this place epitomizes "eat and run". (6) It seems like no matter when you go there are people waiting - I've seen people waiting at noon and closing time (11 p.m. I believe)   (7) I've driven an hour each way to eat here and have not regretted it at any time. (8) parking is difficult - there's metered parking all over little Tokyo.  You're best bet would be to park a little further away from the restaurant and walk. (9) The meals are consistently good.  I've never been disappointed.  The problem with lesser Japanese izakaya or ramen spots is their inconsistency - it can be hit or miss depending on when you go.  I've been here about 5 times now (with only one check-in though).

After hearing all good things about the ramen, i was FINALLY able to have a bowl for myself! The familia and I arrived around 2:15 and there were still people falling out of the front doorway. We ended up waiting around 45 minutes before we were seated. By 3:30, the restaurant was pretty quiet. By 3:45, people were slowly tricking in again. There are only two types of ramen - a big bowl of soup with everything in it, or a big bowl of soup with all of the components layed out seperately outside of the soup. Daikokuya ran out of the kotteri soup (richer broth), so we settled for the regular broth, which wasn't a disappointment.  The broth wasn't too salty but was still very flavorful.  For some reason, i wasn't as big of a fan of the ramen as most people on here are.  I love thick chewy noodles, but my noodles weren't very chewy and just tasted like regular packaged egg noodles, which I'm not crazy about. The fried rice tasted like typical chinese fried rice so nothing special about that either.  The chicken teriyaki, on the other hand, stole the show.  It was served with rice and the perfect amount of teriyaki sauce and the meat was cooked to perfection-still juicy.  And the skin was still nice and crisp, whereas the past chicken teriyakis i've had at other restaurants had soggy flappy skin. The staff is extremely nice and seem like they enjoy what they do. Overall, i think daikokuya is overhyped and that i've had better ramen elsewhere. I'd eat here again but I don't think the wait is worth it.  I'll either have a very late lunch or very early dinner at 3:30 when there's no wait.

I'm a fan of this place.  The ramen out of the bowl thing?  Way cool.  The guy behind the kitchen counter?  Even cooler.  He has this deep animated voice that reminds me of crazy anime characters- alright, I know!  That's so wrong!  But whatever, it's true!  Every time he yelled something to the kitchen dude, I imagined "#", "!" and circle swirls popping up followed by a huge tear formation on some cartoon character's forehead... alright, enough anime talk- the food, the food!   Huge lines and small dining area = -1 star.  But the food and service makes the wait worth the while.  Give it a try.  You won't be disappointed.

whenever i want ramen, this is the place i go to. i live out in Orange County so it's not exactly really far, but it's not all that close either. regardless, this is my ramen stop. i'm not going to say im the master of all things ramen, but i have eaten it at a pretty good amount of places. i like daikokuya cuz its a friggin huge bowl, already comes with egg (so you don't have to add it into your order), has firmer larger noodles (this is up to preference), the broth is amazing (i get kotteri since im a fan of tonkotsu), and the chashu is extremely tender and flavorful. this place also has one of the better cha han dishes i've had too. aesthetically, it's a pretty cool ramen shop. has godzilla, ultraman, and old school japanese movie posters decorating the place which gives it a nice feel. be warned though, it isn't exactly the biggest restaurant so be prepared for a wait. also, it can get a bit hot because of the vats of broth and all the cooking going on. everyone that works there has been great in all of my experiences there. once i was in the shop next door and the girl working there actually came over to tell us that out table was ready. awesome. i think i'll be heading back here the next chance i get :]

I first head about this place many years ago through my sister, when she was talking about another ramen place 3 doors down. "When the wait is too long @ Daikokuya, people go here." When I asked her about Daikokuya, she said it's the best bowl of ramen in the greater LA area. I have to emphatically agree. Their ramen is very old school with very little variation. No curry cutlet or fish ball ramen here, just an old school bowl of ramen that you can order with extra "flavor" or regular. (I'll return to the "flavor" later.) This particular visit was special, because I decided to try the kotteri ramen for the first time. This extra flavoring in the ramen is achieved by adding the back fat from the pork. It sounds odd, but it definitely added that savory kick that seems to be missing from every other bowl of ramen I've ever had. Also had their deep fried spicy tuna wrapped in shiso leaf and tempura battered. It was all good and for relatively little money. The only detracting factor was the almost interminable wait. Do not come here already starving, as the wait is usually around an hour during meal times, longer on the weekends. However, if you keep this fact in mind, you should have a great time.

you know it's good when there are a million ramen restaurants all surrounding one, with tons of people loitering on the streets for 40+ minutes. i'm so glad we had one friend jump out the car and put our names on the waiting list, while another drove around for over 10 minutes to find parking, only to end up in the garage.  my first time here so while we waited, i ventured into the j-rock shop next door. disturbing. then across the street to the hotel and cafe. then finaaallyyyy we took our seats! i wasn't that hungry, so my friend and i split a shredded pork bowl and a daikoko ramen bowl. it came out very quickly. salad was delish with the sweet mayo dressing. ramen bowl was alright. more bland/watery than other places i've tried. noodles stayed crispy. veggies were ehhh. the surprise was the delicious, sweet, salty ooooo sooooooo good shredded pork bowl. mmm reminds me of my mom's cooking which i haven't had in over 3 months. i was about to burst, but still wanted to scarf the rest of my rice bowl down. i would come back, but only if i had 2hrs+ to spare

4-star rating from 2800+ reviews on Yelp can't be wrong. The ramen was THE best I have ever had. We were a little surprised to see that the place was kind of old and un-Japanese neatness. There were a bench, and mix and match chairs in the waiting area. We ordered 2 Daikoku Ramen bowls one with the 'richer kotteri flavor' and one without. The taste is basically the same except the 'richer kotteri flavor' bowl has more fat? I would go with regular bowl next time.

This is a good ramen place. We started with the fried spicy tuna appetizer. It came hot and fresh and delicious. It's spicy tuna wrapped in a shiso leaf, battered and deep fried. They serve it with a slice of lemon and salt and it was mighty tasty.   I ordered the daikokuya ramen with shredded pork combo. The bowl of ramen was HUGE. I expected it to be small since it was a combo, but it was easily 9" in diameter. I can put away food, but man...I had leftovers for two meals from here. Onto the food: the pork was tender, although a bit on the greasy side for my taste. The rice was chewy and flavorful. The ramen has a good broth. I think they must use ham hock in it. There's an initial smokiness to it and I like that it's not too salty. The noodles arrived cooked perfectly - slightly chewy noodles that will soften the longer they are in your broth. The ramen also comes with a soy egg and plenty of scallion scattered in the bowl. I like this place. I like that it's open late on Fridays and I like that the food is solid and good.

This was my first introduction to ramen, and it was fabulous. Broth is a bit on the salty side, but otherwise it's very flavorful. I prefer the Tsukemen, which is ramen unassembled. You can put as much bamboo, onion, etc. as you want. The staff is sweet, even if they don't speak English all that well. One bowl will keep you full for hours. Went there once every two weeks for the first year because it's that good.

Great place, but the only reason I gave them four stars instead of five is that their prices are not as low as I would have liked, (but that's the price you pay for great food).  We would eat there more often if they lowered their prices.  We had the Daikokuya Ramen and Tonkatsu Combination for $12.95.  The Ramen would be $8.95 by itself.  We also ordered the Shredded Pork as well.  Ramen broth was excellent, Noodles were firm, not too soft, the Boiled Egg was perfect, (not overcooked).  The surprise was how good the Tonkatsu and Shredded pork tasted.  My kids are going to get the full order of Tonkatsu and Shredded pork next time.  You have to wait, but it will be worth it.

absolutely overrated. the extremely long lines in front of daikokuya are very deceiving to the actual taste and experience of the place. the noodles are good and i wish there were more free toppings, but my biggest gripe with daikokuya is the broth. it was mediocre at best even after repeat visits when i asked for a stronger base. tonkotsu (pork based) ramen is my favorite and daikokuya definitely does tonkotsu a disservice. overall: long lines, mediocre ramen for better alternatives try shinsengumi or santouka

"BEST RAMEN ULL EVER HAVE IN UR LIFE, BABE" bf says. hmmmm.... o ya? ;) although he's a picky eater who tries not to act like it :) HYYYYYPPPPEEE? nevertheless, we wait... hmmm? 30sh minutes or so? I've waited longer to eat nothing at all compared to........ the BEST FRIED RICE IN THE WORLD. aaahhhh. got the side of the fried rice to start off and.... WOW. my mouth is watering and heart, breaking just thinking about it..........*sigh* I'm going to ask God when I get to heaven if I can eat it everyday :P very cute quaint place along row of cutesy little shops (doesn't hurt while it waiting) crowded and small, but does give a more authentic feel. and yes, yummmilicious ramen. I do personally prefer lighter, thinner, curlier noodles? daikouya's is a bit on the thicker side- but cooked well. nice texture, not too squishy/swollen. the perfect boiled egg in there was very happy. the soup was incredibly rich and flavorful. sluuurrrrp. but, the fried rice.... sigh. yes, the best u'll ever have - evur :)

Came here for the first time late one night (a night Lakers won NBA championship, no less) about 10 minutes before closing. Luckily, they accommodated us and I didn't have to experience these horrendous waits other people talk about during peak times, so that probably favored this review a bit. I had the DK special ramen at the suggestion of my friends, so I can only comment on that. Good Ramen? YES Excellent Broth? YES Nice Japanese vibe? YES OMGWTFBBQ MUST HAVE!?!? Debatable... In closing, is this the best ramen joint in greater LA area? Probably (I haven't eaten at all, but judging by the reviews and # of reviews for Daikokyua, it's a good chance). But I'd rate Shin Sen Gumi and Santouka a close 2nd and 3rd.

Love discovering this little ramen shop on the streets of little tokyo. My group and I were craving ramen after a weekend trip in SB and we saw a small crowd outside of Daikokuya. That's gotta be a good sign. We waited for about 15-20 minutes before we gobbled up our ramen with fatty meat and thick soup. We also ordered rice dishes and a plate of gyoza. We were satisfied. If the cooks and waitresses are japanese that's a good sign.

Very good ramen and big portions. We had ordered one big bowl and it was enough for 2 people. The staff is very nice doing such things as refilling our water, giving us an extra bowl so we can share the ramen, and just being very friendly. We also had gyoza and a small bowl of pork katsu donburi. Both were very good and I would come back to try other dishes here. The wait is long but they are open late which is a plus. The restaurant is small but that intimacy is what makes it a crowd pleaser and I guess what makes people coming back for more.

daikokuya is a really good ramen place in little tokyo in LA. the line is always long and it's always packed here, and on sundays, they close when the broth is gone so make sure to come before the broth is gone! haha the broth is soooo yummy! the pork fat, i mean, meat was to die for...especially when it melts in your mouth...mmmmm fat....haha it's a pretty good portion too, i shared a bowl of ramen with a friend, and that was enough for me. $8/ bowl. i heard this place is equivalent to santa ramen in san mateo (norcal). i haven't been to santa ramen yet, but if it is as good as daikokuya, i will have to make a visit soon!!!

I was excited to have a friend visiting so I could use that as an excuse to try out this place. We got there on a Sunday around noon after circling for awhile trying to find street parking. There's usually something around and you don't have to pay on Sundays which is nice. You go in to put down your own name on the list and make sure you remember your number! Since there were like 8 parties ahead of us, we decided to wander across the street to the heart of Little Tokyo. We were only gone maybe 20 minutes; half an hour at the most and they had already called us. So we politely asked a waitress if we had to put down our names again and she said no, she would seat us at the next available table. Which happened to be like 2 minutes later at the counter. Sweet! The place itself is super tiny. I counted like 5 booths that fit 4 people each and maybe 10 people can sit at the counter. But their service is very fast and the food comes out before you know it. We ordered the combos, the Daikokuya ramen - one with the shredded pork bowl and one with the fried rice so we could try some of each others. First came the small salad which I think looks more like coleslaw because the lettuce is so finely shredded. And even though the dressing was like thousand island, it was still very good. Even before we were done with the salad, the huge bowls of ramen came out. The broth is creamy, almost bordering on rich but it was delicious. The pork belly is melt-in-your-mouth good. The egg is gargantuan too. I love all the green onions and bean sprouts they put in there. The only thing I wasn't too impressed with was the noodles. It really looked and almost tasted like those 10 cents packages of ramen you can get at the supermarket. I've def had better elsewhere. Although we didn't know you could specify how soft/hard you want the noodles so maybe that makes a difference. The rice and pork sides arrived just after our first bites into the noodles. And I could tell halfway through the bowl, that there was no way I could eat everything. There's that much food. I think we ended up trying a couple bites of both dishes and then just took the rest home. The fried rice is super oily but that's what makes it taste so good. And the shredded pork is almost as fatty as the pork in the ramen but also had the sweetness o a teriyaki type sauce. $11.50 for each combo - not bad for all that food. Oh and I didn't even know about the Monterey Park location - will be frequenting that one as it's way closer.

I wanted to check out Little Tokyo and find a good place to eat too.  It looks like this place is the most popular.  When I got there at opening time there was already a few people in line.  I ordered their specialty ramen kotteri.   I noticed after I ordered they have a combinations where you can order ramen with different bowls, Urggh I wish I knew.   Still left happy, the ramen was hella good.

I don't usually like ramen (im more of a udon man) however this is by far the best ramen I've ever had. The broth is great, the egg is amazing and the pork is the best part. Usually I don't like ramen because the broth is extremely salty but here that's not the case. I went with 4 people and we all ordered ramen and a pitcher of kirin and it came out to around $12 a person.

If daikokuya had a brawl with shinsengumi, they'd destroy each other--and I'd be there to slurp up the mess.  The broth is nicely balanced with pork savoriness and the noodles are chewy enough that I don't have to request extra hard.  The egg has a slight sweetness all the way to the yolk.  The best thing about daikokuya ramen is the pork.  It's tasty and tender and just fatty enough so that my girlfriend won't eat it (the winner is me).  And sometimes if I want a little extra--I'd go ahead and toss some of that buttered-garlic sauce in my bowl.  The price is fair and the service is okay, also.  The only reason they lost a star is because of the lack of A/C.  It can get really hot in there.

I'm a bit of a ramen snob, and I'd have to say it is pretty damn good here. If you're looking for variety in your ramen you're not gonna find it here. Pretty much your choice is the Daikokuya ramen or Daikokuya Ramen - Kotteri style. Kotteri style is definitely thicker and deeper, but very flavorful. If you're afraid of a fatty broth, it's not for you. Definitely order the fried spicy tuna and gyoza though! Great texture and prepared differently than you'd normally get it at other places.I enjoyed my food here, and the store decor was very retro Tokyo, but it wasn't the mind blowing ramen I was hoping for.

It's sad, you know--being the delicious broth that the soup is and to give up most of the credit to the noodle.  We simply call it "Ramen." When really, we're thinking yummy broth. Today, my bf and I beat out the crowds. And wow! was there a crowd.   Everything was delicious.  We got two combos: one with eel rice and the other with their fried rice & of course yummy broth with Ramen. The combos are a nice way to try the other stuff on the menu, and it will run you anywhere from $3-5 bucks more. You get it like a side dish to your soup. On a random note, I love their diet coke there. Is that weird?  I think it's their mix.  I started craving it and stopped by In-n-Out to get my fix--In-n-Out has inferior diet coke to Daikokuya.

Super awesome ramen!  We hit this place up every time we're in L.A.  They also have some super delicious fried rice. Food is 5 stars, but there are a few cons: -Cash only, don't forget to stop at the ATM. There is also a citi ATM across the street -be prepared to wait roughly 45 min to 1 hr for dinner; although went for lunch today and there was no wait -parking - street parking is not easy to come by. There are a few parking lots close by that are not too expensive It's worth it though once your generous portion of steaming ramen is delivered to your table. Highly recommend!

yes, there is often a long wait, but it's the only ramen that gives  me the warm happy feeling that i usually only get with really good pho. my former roommate, who hadn't eaten pork or beef (including broth) in over a decade, can't resist the ramen here. caveat: i live in the san fernando valley, so i'm too lazy to try some of the south bay ramen houses i've read about in la weekly. i have tried chabuya on sawtelle (noodles were chewy, egg was plain jane hardboiled with a tint of soy marinade and broth was weak) and never gotten around to asahi on the same street. there isn't much variation for the ramen so if you like choice you can try mr. ramen, but i found the broth there to be bland the first time and tolerable the second time. sometimes daikokuya is a little off (i emphasize "a little"), but when it's perfectly on, the pork will melt in your mouth, the egg is 'pickled' to the perfect stage of soft-boiledness and the broth is rich and cloudy. daikokuya is a high quality bargain, as people have mentioned. i love the rice bowls and usually get a chicken-egg rice bowl combo with my ramen for lunch the next day. when i've taken friends there i've also sprung for an appetizer of spicy tuna wrapped in a sesame leaf (i think that's what it is), tempura breaded and deep fried. served with rock salt and a lemon slice, it's a great little treat. edit: the ramen totally tasted different yesterday and i think it was because a different dude than the two regular guys i usually get was there. could've been that i went there for lunch, which i never do. i was vaguely disappointed. boo. edit 2: i deviated in my ramen/combo selection and went with the shredded pork bowl. oh my GOD. if you like the pork they give you in the ramen and just can't get enough, this is the ticket. it's actually cubes of luscious pork in a teriyak-ish glaze (i say teriyaki because that's the easiest thing to relate it to, but it's far superior) over rice, topped with finely chopped scallions and generous helping of shredded pickled ginger.

The broth is almost as good as Hakata Ramen's broth, flavor was definitely there, except there's no options for spicyness, saltiness, and the tenderness of the noodles. I don't really care for the noodles. It's similar to Tampopo's in Gardena, which I don't really like. What is GREAT though is their pork in the noodle, SOOOO good, it totally melts in your mouth when you bite it. No other places that I have tried has it like that. I mean, it's a pretty fatty but it was what made it so good.

The food was outstanding.  Being a foodie from Hawaii, we are always in search of great eating especially if recommended by the locals.  The service is great, fast, and very authentic.  However, there are some drawbacks.  It's very squishy.  It's not meant for families.  Perfect for young adults with no kids. Parking is terrible if you don't know your way around.  Street parking, or building lots are the cheapest.  We went for an open lot for 8.00!!!  0.o But it was worth it for the taste of the food!  I'd go again, not so much with my family, but maybe on a business trip. :) Enjoy!

My favorite ramen house.  The noodles are just right and I love the boiled egg in my bowl of ramen.  There's not much variety in ramen but when the original is this good, there's no need for more.  We all hate long lines but there's a reason why there's a line.  It can get hot in the summer though bc the place is small and there are giant vats of boiling water so make sure you have a cold beer while you eat your ramen.

If you have a ramen craving come here, just look for the yellow awning. I've taken some Japanese friends here with discriminating palates and they give it the thumbs up. It's quality and quantity and the best ramen house in downtown. The charsiu is very tender and juicy. The pork base soup just right, not too oily and the noodles are perfect in firmness. Try the hard boiled egg, that's also tasty, they marinate it over 24 hours. The only thing about this place is the wait, sign up for either counter or booth for faster service.

I was a little skeptical of the hype, but after one bowl of ramen I'm now a believer.  The noodles and soup were very tastey - apparently you can order the broth with "extra flavor" but my friend insisted that I was a novice and had to stay true to the original (stinkin bully!).  But the BEST part was the pork... it seriously melts in your mouth!  I will venture to say, best ramen i've had in LA so far!

Definatelty a 5 star joint in my book. Would've gave them 4 because of the wait, but after tasting the food, its understandable. Man, everything was slammin' starting from the salad all the way through the green ice tea. If you ordered what I ordered. They start you off with some kind of japanese coleslaw......then they bust out with the side...in my case it was the sashimi bowl....they hook you up with nice size cutlets of tuna (i'm a meat monster and the portions are satisfying)...then the main course...the daikokuya ramen...its a monsterous bowl of ramen hooked up with cutlets of pork, beef, cilantro, green onions....the works! I  think there was even a hard boiled egg in there somewhere! Anyway, i definately recommend this spot. If you like Pho, You'll love this place! - hence the Pho Killa.... Peace.

This is one of the best tonkotsu soup ramen places I know of in LA.  I love how it's a small hole in a wall restaurant that will always have a line of folks waiting to get through and slurp down their noodles. They have awesome gyoza as well, no filler- real meat filling.  I've taken many friends and family members there and they've all thoroughly enjoyed it.  Minus how the wait can be a bit long winded, just don't walk away and miss your name being called. I like how walking through those doors you feel you've been time warped into another era.  The decor is vintage and random, the noodles are delish, and the soup base you'd wish would never run out.  You can request for an extra large bowl too for you hungry folks.

Its a schvitz in here...except the steam is pork based. So get ready to emerge smelling like boiled pork bones even after just going in to put your name on the impossible list. This is one of those "LA institutions" whose reputation supercedes actuality. Goers should be warned that all the ramen here is served in a pork based broth. I did not know that and was disappointed as I only eat chicken or fish....so I had no choice but to try something way more mundane....the shrimp tempura bowl. It came with miso soup (was that in pork broth too??) and salad (shredded iceberg or maybe cabbage with questionable looking dressing) which made for a really good value overall. My friends seemed to thoroughly enjoy their ramen, and I am happy for them. However, the experience solidified my preference for Pho.

Practically everyone and their dead grandmother recommends this place and for once the madness of the crowd is spot on. Sure, the place looks ratty and in desperate need of a cleaning but you will cease to care once you get a bowl in front of you. This is not some shallow, over-salted broth from a packet with cheap noodles dumped inside, there is something to savor. Should you be in the mood for side dishes you won't be overwhelmed but you won't be disappointed either. As others have warned though the line on the weekends are enough to give Sisyphus pause so plan accordingly.

Of all the places to eat in LA...I miss this place the most! The best bowl of ramen you will ever have! Whenever I am back in LA, this is definitely something I never pass up. No other ramen house compares to Daikokuya. It's no surprise that they often close shop during business hours because they've sold out of noodles. Truly amazing.

Usually you have to wait about 45 minutes to get a seat. Always busy, Daikokuya's ramen is worth the wait. It's a pork based soup with nicely textured pork strips and homemade noodles in it. The broth was good however could have used a little more seasoning. Hence the 4 I gave it. However out of all the ramen places I have been to, this is the king for me. Well priced, you will get full on 8 to 10 dollars.

The best ramen joint in Los Angeles.  It is as if you stepped right into Japan.  The appetizer salad that comes with the combo ramen is absolutely perfect.  The only downside is that the wait is typically very long.  Sunday afternoon at 4:30 is probably the only time when the place is free of wait.  Remember, ramen is awesome when you have it every now and then.  Eat it everyday, and you'll give this place 2 stars.

definitely a great place to satisfy your craving for ramen. the soup and flavor was perfect. my only complaint is that they put sprouts in the ramen... not into those. but for those that think sapporo ichiban can't get any better... it can... just come here. be prepared to wait in line and parking is a beach.

Me: "hey imma write a review for daikokuya" Boyf: "MMMMMM" + that face of let's make it happennn/all i heard was daikokuya Yuhhh it's that good...I've been trying to find a place to stand in for the thick flavorful broth of amazingness of the ramen in Japan but before Daikokuya, everything just tasted like water and noodles. Finally, my friend convinced me to decided to brave the 10E to 110N to 101S, wait outside with the other legit-ramen cravers, and make it over to Little Tokyo for some Daikokuya deliciousness. It was pretty uhhhmajing! So uhhhmajing that I went again the next week with other friends to make sure I wasn't just making it up in my head. The ramen has the perfect amount of chewiness...none of that overcooked too soft shiz. And the broth...I don't even know what to say about the broth. Reminds me of Japan? Can it get any better than that? Also, they have crushed garlic available for you to throw in your soup...just like in Japan. And the aftertaste is not gross at all despite the intense flavorfulness of the ramen. Four thumbs up! (from yours truly and boyf) But the ramen isn't the only bowl of yumsters here. Get a combo (the tuna sashimi bowl and chicken terriyaki are my faves to go with the Daikoku Ramen) if you're hungry. Or into delicious ramen leftovers. I'm into leftovers so the overly filling combo is my kinda meal-for-2-meals ish. Throw your leftover ramen into a pot and you'll have another bowl of yummay ramen. Basically what I'm trying to say through all that rambling is to go find some parking at the meters on Alameda if you can't find any on First. Sign in on the wait list. Grab a drink 2 doors away or take a walk around the Little Tokyo plaza. Get back in time to hear your name called out and grab your seats. Enjoy a bowlful of Japanese heaven. :)

My first time here.  Wasn't sure if it'd be worth the wait.  BUT...the fact that they had tsukemen on the menu was a great sign.  I had the "kichi-men" (supposedly an updated version of the tsukemen).  It was very good.  I love ramen.  Even traveled to Sapporo just to spend as much time as I could at the Ramen Republic.  I could eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  The noodles here were a bit on the dense side for me.  I prefer the noodles at Santuoka in Costa Mesa.  But the broth is good and the fried rice side was REALLY good.  If I wasn't wearing a tight dress, I would've eaten more.  Next time.

Noodles and broth -  you'd think it'd be easy to replicate ramen in Japan, but surprisingly many places in the States don't even come close to the taste and texture of Japanese ramen.  However, Daikokuya is right up there and it's a lot cheaper than buying a plane ticket to Japan.  I have to say that the first time I had their Daikokuya special ramen, memories of Japan came flooding back.  It's very delicious and by far the best ramen found in LA.  The atmosphere may be small and bit dirty, but it's worth it.

This place ain't bad because their Ramen portions seem to be slightly bigger than most places and the broth wasn't too salty nor too light.  I think it's comparable to Shinsengumi except the ambiance is cooler.  They have a bunch of advertisements and signs hung up on the walls that come from the 60's Japan.  I guess you can say it's also cool just because it's situated in the heart of Jtown.

Second time around, the flavor of the ramen broth had much improved.  Unctuous but not overpoweringly greasy, with hint of sesame oil undertone.  The marinaded egg this time was actually more like the semi-soft boiled type that I like.  Unfortunately they ran out of the kotteri broth (soup base made of fattier pork back).   The shredded pork rice bowl contained generous amount of fatty pork strips with sweet and salty sauce drizzle all over.  This time the combination of pork, scallions, pickled ginger and sweet sauce matched much better, especially with the ginger cutting down the overall greasiness of the meat.  The ramen-rice bowl combo was filling enough, even for me.  The fried rice was actually above standard, in my opinion, as the consistency is not overcooked or too "al dente", and I can taste the pork fat that permeated the rice.   Overall, a satisfying experience (better than last visit).  It was 6 oclock on a weekday and we were able to grab some counter seats which were quickly filled as well.  Parking was readily available on first street as well (though meter runs til 8PM and it's $2 for an hour!)

Daikokuya is one of my "Top Gun" restaurants so that means they are the BEST at something; and that "something" is their famous Daikoku Ramen (Japanese Pork Noodle Soup).  Easily the best Japanese style ramen you will find anywhere. Huge ramen fans, like I am, would tell you that their superior broth is what really sets Daikokuya apart from other ramen shops.  Slowly rendered overnight, the broth is super rich and super creamy with an extremely deep flavor.  You can also get EXTRA pork back-fat added to the broth for an even richer flavor (although some might find this to be slightly too oily for their taste).  The ramen itself is perfectly cooked: Not too chewy and not too soggy.  Throw in a few nice strips of flavorfully fatty pork belly, a tangy marinated hard-boiled egg, and plenty of fresh bamboo shoots, bean sprouts and diced green onions, and you have a fantastic meal (exceptional if you have a hangover).  I'm not even kidding when I say that the Daikoku Ramen is crazy, crazy, CRAZY good.  And at only $8.50 for a very generous portion, a fantastic bargain to boot. If you have a big appetite, I also highly recommend getting an order of their Pork Fried Rice on the side.  Having eaten far more than my fair share of fried rice throughout the years, both home cooked by my mom (who, in her own right, is an outstanding cook - her shrimp & pork dumplings are out of this world!) and at restaurants, I can honestly say that Daikokuya's Pork Fried Rice is one of the best, if not THE best, I've ever had.  Extremely moist and packed full of flavor, you definitely won't be disappointed. All that being said, I unfortunately feel obligated to disclose the "bad" (very bad) along with the "good."  The Little Tokyo shop is located in a SUPER small, inline retail shop that does not have its own dedicated parking.  Therefore, you will have to hunt and pay for off street parking.  There are several pay parking lots in the area, so I normally don't have too much trouble finding a spot, but you may need to walk a bit.  Now for the VERY bad: Naturally, a place THIS good will be EXTREMELY busy (and believe me, it IS that busy ALL the time).  Add in the fact that the restaurant is probably only 800 square feet in size, you WILL be waiting (most likely outside) for a table for a long, long time.  The quickest I've ever been seated was 30 minutes and the longest I've ever waited was 90 minutes.  Whether that's a deal-breaker or not, that's really up to you, but I don't think any sane person could deny that the Daikoku Ramen is second to none - the best ramen I've ever had, PERIOD!

I love this place.  The Ramen is so good here that I have to bug my friends to come here and eat with me almost once every other week.  What really makes their Ramen taste sooooo good is their broth.  Its a little creamy but just perfect.  The only bad thing I have to say is that their restaurant is small and they are always full.  Every time I drive by, there are at least 10+ people outside waiting.  Overall, love it.

Actually 2.5 stars. I've been here on several occasions now.  First off, the food is very good.  The ramen broth is delicious and the pork just melts in your mouth.  The egg is also very unique with a soft boiled consistency.  Even the rice with pork or other choices have not been disapppointing. Well...I would  recommend skipping the cold noodles (ordered that one on hot summer day...bad choice...oh and they don't have air conditioning). It smelled funny...and tasted...unappetizing. Okay....so why minus 2.5 stars?  The wait is insane. I can't justify waiting more than an hour....last time I waited...( no exaggeration) 1.5 hrs on Sat morning for two people even though we came when it opened.   There was already a loooong line. By the time we got seated....we were soooo hungry and tired.... Another bad reason?  Parking is insane.  If you like driving round and round....the crazy one way streets of downtown Los Angeles...be my guest.   Also has anyone ever used the restroom there???  It smells bad...looks dirty....and well I won't elaborate.... Aside from no air conditioning the last time I was there.....in the scorching hot LA heat...the service was very good!  The waitresses are all very nice and efficient.  They must be on some adrenaline high...they're racing back and forth and still manage a friendly smile. Overall, the food must be must be amazing for people to overlook horrible bathrooms, parking, no air conditioning........and I agree the food is good.....So if you are hygiene freak....beware.....

For ramen, Daikokuya is the best...the flavor is unbeatable!! The wait can be long if you get there during peak times, so go early and you might get street parking too. The gyoza, sashimi, pork katsu and salads are all good too, but go for the ramen!!  The place is simple, humble and well worth it!!.

first time trying this ramen place. very very good broth,  you can really taste the flavor of the pork.  The pork itself was tender and buttery but i prefer the one at Orochon Ramen a tad more.  They do give you a full hard boiled egg.  We had the Ramen and the Gyoza and everything was absolutely delicious.  The wait was a bit long but was expected.  parking can be crappy but you can always find a parking lot and pay.  All in all I would definitely come here again if i was in the area.  Glad to hear they're opening one up in Hacienda heights.

The first taste of Daikokuya's broth converted me into a Ramen-head for life! I always have to wait when I go however I always think it's always worth it. There are many solid ramen spots in the city but every time I venture out, my taste buds go back to Daikokuya. The broth is very complex and rich...plus it comes with a scrumptious egg, bamboo and sprouts. I always get the combo with the shredded pork; it's so tender it just melts in your mouth. Yes...Santouka is good too...but go to Daikokuya for the atmosphere of a fun Japanese Diner in Little Tokyo.

I must say I kind of have an obession with ramen but I'm afraid that might be an understatement now that I've found this place! NOM NOM NOM! I ordered the tonkotsu ramen with extra fatty broth thinking that I could handle it. The broth was really really really good, but I really regret getting the extra fatty broth because I had to stop half way through. =\ I was afraid my arteries were going to clog right then and there. The broth was so rich with flavor that I'm pretty sure the normal broth would have met my ramen needs. I'm not bashing on the broth, I'm just saying that if you're not a hardcore tonkotsu lover, you probably shouldn't get  the extra fatty broth. Anyway, I highly recommend this place.

This is, hands down, my most favorite ramen place ever.  Prior to Daikokuya, I refused order ramen in a restaurant, something I felt I could easily make at home.  I only wish I could come close to creating something as delicious as Dikokuya's, which I actually find myself craving at times.  I always get the combo, Ramen + Oyako Don, and it's more than enough food to fill me up.  The only negative I have is that they don't take reservations, so I've had to wait over an hour on several occasions during dinner hours on a weekday.  Move to a bigger location already!

When it comes to best Ramen in L.A. It is a toss up between this place and Santonka for me. The only reason I give this place 3 star instead of 4 is because they are little bit more expensive than Santonka.  I mean really it's just a Ramen. It shouldn't cost almost $10 for a bowl of noodle and some soup. Over all though the flavor is really good. I think I favor Santonka a little bit more for their soup and the price.

The ramen came highly recommended, and it was VERY GOOD - tasty, complex, and not too salty. Also, liked the pork rice bowl (full of taste, but too much rice). And, liked the cold sesame noodles -- except for the deli turkey. Maybe it's traditional, but in that case, I want bastardized. Good though. Real good.

I'm not a major fan of ramen.  Never have been.  But Daikokuya makes the egg in my ramen perfectly!!!  You know how hard it is to boil an egg until its yolk is solid but not too solid?!?  Ok - I'm sure people don't wait 20 mins to an hour and a half to get in just to have their egg.  Their ramen is pretty good too.  Btw, there's only one type of ramen here so it makes it that much easier to order.  I love, LOVE their fried rice.  So I always order the combination of ramen and fried rice.  There's something about the flavor that just keeps me coming back for more!  Even if it means spending 15 mins circling the block trying to find parking and another 40 mins or more waiting to be seated.

YUM!  The ramen sure is good here.  But the wait, the sticky seat, and the amount of salt in the end made it 3-stars for me.  The broth is super flavorful but I still felt like it had MSG or salt or something.  When I got home, I must have drank a gallon of water and that usually doesn't happen unless there was a lot of salt intake.  The service was super quick and the quality was really great.  The egg was perfectly cooked!  I would go again if I were in the area again.

We waited over an hour to get into this place. When we finally get in, we ordered our Ramen right away since we had so much time to deiced what to get.

Daikokuya never seems to fail me. Although the wait is a killer, (usually dinner time/and/or weekends) in the end its totally worth it. I usually get the large bowl of Daikoku Ramen. Pure deliciousness! I love their mini salads you get when you order a combo (daikoku ramen+fried rice) FTW. Everytime I come to this place I leave extremely full. Good quality ramen for a cheap afforable price! No complaints. I shall be back here very soon!

I ate here twice while I was serving on jury duty last week in downtown. It's within easy walking distance of the courthouse. On the first day i had the basic ramen which I love, thought I do wish is came with more than just 2 slices of pork. On another day, I had the gyoza and some tuna sushi rolls to try something different. Both were good, but stick to the ramen, it's what they do best.

Let's make this clear. I love ramen. I've made it a personal goal to try as many of the most talked about noodle places in the state. So let's get down to it, my friends and I were on a roadtrip and we heard from our socal friends that this place was one of the best in the downtown LA area, so we headed there as fast as possible. Surprisingly traffic from Westwood to downtown was good, but parking was not. I'm not going to complain too much about it, but simply it was 2 blocks off (street parking sucks). When we got there, the place looked really busy and we were right, there was a waiting list. We signed out names and we waited...outside...in the cold...for almost an hour and a half. Anyway to cut down to it, we finally got seated after closing hours and we all ordered the special, which at the time was the daikokuya bowl, with a side salad and a side entree. I ordered mine bowl with "extra richness" and got ungai over rice for my side entree. The salad was some simple greens topped with what seemed like thousand island infused with some wasabi, it was alright. The Unagi rice bowl was a different story. Imagine a normal bowl of rice...hidden by thick pieces of unagi. Simply from the looks of the dish I could tell the Unagi would be full of flavor, if it weren't for the bowl of ramen that was sent right out following out side dishes, I would've ordered another of those. Immediately as the soups closed in you could really sense their presence simply by the aroma. To top it off the soup was just as amazing; the portion was very generous for the price and it came with a soft boiled egg, strips of pork belly and some veggies. The meal seemed well worth the wait... up until the point when I started to slow down and noticed that I just found out what the "extra richness" was. As my soup settled from me not disturbing it, I noticed these tiny little globules coagulating at the service, I realized that these were the "extra richness!" An extra serving of fat and lipids straight from the broth stock before straining no less. It was an interesting sight and from that point on I stopped drinking the soup with my noodles, too bad though it was good, getting the dish w/o the extra addition tasted just as good as mine, less rich, but barely noticeable. Overall, this ramen house made it to perhaps my top 10 in cali and top 5 in socal. The ambience was really nice and reminded me of a cute little shop I found outside Tokyo once, the staff was very friendly after an obviously grueling day and the food was delicious! The only downside I could see is that this location has poor parking and the wait made the food almost not worth it, but the whole meal just happen to be worth the wait, but if we weren't as dedicated to try this place, we would've left and tried somewhere else. Stop by this place if you're in the area and are craving noodles try to follow this game play though; jot your name down, go check out the Japanese plaza and stores surrounding the area and come back in about 20 - 30 minutes and get ready to eat!

Veggies and non-meat eaters beware! Every possible sensory experience you will have here will remind you why you are a vegetarian. Yeah, you could eat the sushi, since that's pretty much what we're limited to. I mean, it's edible. 3 stars - it would be unfair to rate them any lower just because I can't eat 90% of what's on the menu. Actually I have to take off one more because they really earned that B rating with the way they shuttle the crowds in and out of this place. I'd compare it to a Metro bus.. the seats look and feel the same too.

ohhh daikokuya, the chashu pork that came with my tsukemen (dipping ramen) was TO DIE FOR!!! the meat just melted away in my mouth & i was in heaven 3 times (since there were 3 slices). the 15min wait and the awkward feeling of not being able to put/hang my bag anywhere was quickly replaced by a feeling of satisfaction in my tummy & my palette. another thing i really enjoyed was the egg. it was just the right flavor & just the right softness of the yolk. the noodles were on the aldente side, which i definitely prefer (who wants overbolied noodles anyway), and the harmony of the noodles and the pork-based broth together is exactly how it should be. it sure is tokyo-status.

if you're trying to come during the normal dinner hours, be prepared to wait atleast 20 minutes for a table. this place is always packed and there will most likely be a waitlist. the waitstaff is friendly and accomodating. i have no complaints here. the ramen is good, but i wouldn't say it's amazing ramen. i hate the space because it is dimly lit and the bar area is stuffy and uncomfortable to sit in. if the restaurant space wasn't so uncomfortable in terms of seating arrangements and wait time, i just might frequent this place more often.

I've been coming to Daikokuya for years and haven't had ramen of this caliber anywhere else. The only issue I have is the WAIT. At any given time of day there seems to be at LEAST at 30 minute line, upwards to an hour and a half. In my opinion it's worth it. (Take a walk down the street and visit some of the markets and shops to kill time!). Ok, maybe the heat is an issue too. It feels like it's 100 degrees inside and even if it's raining outside I'll be sweating the moment I walk through the door. Basically they have one time of ramen: pork. They use a very specific pork that melts in your mouth and sends you straight to heaven. Another nice feature is the EPIC portions. I can barely finish half a bowl and I am swiftly propelled into a wonderful, bloated, tasty food coma. But as good as the ramen is, my favorite thing is the KATSUDON. It's perfection. All other Japanese restaurants that make this dish are put to SHAME by Daikokuya. So much so that this is now the only place I'll bother ordering it from. They take the same pork from the ramen and bread/fry it, sauté some onions, throw both over a bed of rice and add a mirin/soy sauce mix, then crack and steam and egg over top. Their portions are incredibly big so typically when I go a friend orders ramen and we'll get the ramen/katsu don combo. (Combo sized katsu don is smaller than regular while the ramen is normal size). One final note: Get the Kirin. I believe it's 3.25 a pint now? An ice cold kirin goes divinely with hot ramen (and atmosphere!)

We were wondering around Little Tokyo after a Garth Brooks concert at Staples (don't ask!) and saw a long line outside this Ramen and Rice bowl joint - so obviously we tried it.  It was a 40 minute wait, but well worth it!  I got the house ramen and pork katsu bowl combo.  The ramen is the best I have in all of Los Angeles - the broth is absolutely fantastic!  The katsu rice bowl was good, nothing extrodinary like the ramen, but good.  Will definitely come back again, but probably around 2-3 to avoid long waits!

Best Ramien! I don't know why I never heard about  the place. I just happened to be in the area with the wife we saw a small line and thought we would try it (glad we did). I tried the Daikokuya Ramien w/koiterri and the wife got shredded pork bowl we loved both. The bill was about $20, service was great, the food was amazing, and the wait to be seated well, a few months ago on a Friday night at 6:30 was about 15min., but the crowds grew as soon as we got seated and continued to grow as the night went on. So get early there if you want good ramein and a casual atmosphere.

The friend that brought me here said it's the best ramen ever... but I wasn't really knocked out of my socks.  Don't get me wrong, the ramen is tasty, but I think the yelpers are going a little overboard on this one. I liked Ippudo in NY better, but then again, Daikokuya is half the price (and probably half the wait too) so it's a better deal.

What an awesome noodle joint. I come here even when the weathers hot and dry! Try the kotteri ramen for extra kurobuta pork fatty goodness or my personal favorite, the new kichi men. It's a spicier and more vinegary version of the ramen but with the soup, noodles and meat separated. The quality of the noodles are like no other. Perfectly chewy and not sticky, even when it's dry. And for the appetizer the gyoza is a must try. They're rectangular and filled with happy little bits of delicious pork. Service is fast, waiters are nice, noodles are orgasmically good...what more can you ask for?

Had the Daikoku Ramen and small chicken terriyaki bowl combination order.  The chicken terriyaki bowl wasn't that great because the chicken was fatty.  It had a slight crispiness to it, which was a nice surprise.  However, the Daikoku Ramen was the best ramen I have ever tasted.  The noodles had a great texture, not too soft nor too hard.  But the taste of the creamy ramen soup base was absolutely heavenly.  BUT be very careful if you don't like salty things because I can see the soup as being too salty for most people.  I'm fine with it.  If I'm not mistaken, I saw a video of them making the prized soup base and they actually pour milk in it.  You even get your daily calcium!  Will definitely need to come back much more often and only get the ramen next time.  The bowl is HUGE, so don't worry about not being filled up.

FINALLY!!!!! Every time we go to Little Tokyo for dinner, the wait for this place is hella long and we end up eating someplace else. Was around town on a week day and we got seated right away. Ordered their specialty item Daikoku Ramen and it did not disappoint. I had to pause after the first bite and realize that dis was some hella good ramen. I felt like Naruto eating at the Ichiraku Ramen Shop in Leaf Village. I slurped that stuff down and wouldn't have minded another if I wasn't lookin out for my figure. I didn't get a chance to try out their other dishes, but their Tsukemen and sliced roast pork appetizer are definitely next on my hit list. I am a big fan of cheap prices and large portions. If you enjoy ramen, gotta try this place out.

I am not going to comment about the wait because everyone else already has.  I just wanted to say that 6 people sitting at a table barely fit for four was tough.  But we made do and scrunched our arms together to eat.  We all shared combo platters because lets face it, we couldn't fit 6 large bowls of ramen on one table.  The food was super delish and I feel a little bad that I live so far away from the tastiness.  he ramen was cooked perfectly, the broth was something special I never tasted before, and although there wasn't much meat in the bowl, what was there was tender and yummy.  I will definitely try its sister restaurants but they have alot to live up to.

I must admit that this was my very first ramen experience. I was starving when we got here and since we had plans to eat at the Dodgers game we decided to split a bowl.

I think this is the best ramen you can get outside of Japan. It is authentic. Noodles are chewy. Broth is well flavored, kinda rich tasting like it has cream or milk in it. Having it in the winter is the best. I also ordered the gyoza, shoulda just skipped it.

I was kind of shaky on giving it a 2 or a 3.. But I figured that I should round down because of how disappointing Daikokuya was.  I came in with high expectations after reading such great reviews from http://rameniac.com and yelp. I had gyoza and tonkotsu ramen.  The gyoza came first and was pretty good compared to Shin-Sen-Gumi's bite sized and overpriced mini mini gyoza.  However, there was just way too much green onion on top.  I had some of my bf's oyako don and that was only average. The ramen was the most disappointing.. the noodles were way thick (I prefer thinner noodles), kind of stale, and had NO flavor at all.  In the end, I just drank the soup and ate 1/4 of the noodles.  The soup wasn't what I expected either.  I was expecting a nice and rich pork flavor, but it was bland and green oniony.  The green onion flavor was too overpowering that I could not taste much of the soup. I prefer Shin-Sen -Gumi and Asa Ramen over this place.  After having 2 bad experiences at ramen shops http://rameniac.com recommends.. I don't know if I should trust him anymore.. Nissin instant ramen beats Daikokuya

i LOVE Japanese ramen houses! If I could get paid for trying every single ramen house I would do it! So prior to leaving for the road trip, I researched for the best ramen houses in LA and Daikokuya had awesome reviews! We got there around 11:30am, they open at 11:00am, and the place was lined up out the door by 11:45am! We got the Daikoku Raumen and gyoza. The fatty pork, known as kurobuta or black pork, was so flavorful! One thing they use excessively was green onions, we loved it!

i finally tried something different and ordered their tsukemen (dipping ramen). and it was a complete bull cr_p. all they did was separate the noodles and ingredients from their regular soup. trust me, that's not what a tsukemen's supposed to be. i guess i can say they at least made the noodles cold. but then again, that really didn't work with the warm soup they provided. it just made the whole thing über-lukewarm. gross. tsukemen should come with a cold but concentrated dipping sauce, so that there's enough flavor when you dip cold noodles into it then right into your mouth. and if you're really into it, you should be able to ask the chef to bring you some warm soup to add to the dipping sauce, so that you can drink a little flavorful soup at the very end. still, their regular ramen is quite good, so i'll leave the 3 stars for now. but please don't be misled by what they call their tsukemen.

my holy church of all that is tender pork loins and brothy egg with raw yolk centers. my absolute FAVORITE place for ramen! the only thing i have against this place is that it takes you literally a lifetime and a half to get seated on the peak hours! but once you're in, it's like the huge pot of broth is glowing with all that is wonderful in the world. the only downside is that there is literally ONE ramen bowl to order. but it is fudging BOMB!! you can probably add fudge to it and it'll still taste bomb! (i'm actually gonna try that next time... open that egg right up and add some melted fudge!!) the pork here is the most tender of all the places i've tried. the egg is cooked so the yolk is raw and moist and melty all over the noodles (um YUMM) and the broth is thick thick YUM thickTHICK the only downside is that you have to pay for freaking PARKING for dinnar. what the hark is that?!! that deng structure nearby is $10 flat rate manggg

Maybe I'm easy to please...or I just enjoy quick service and a savory meal. I went in on a Monday, full house -- around 2pm! There were two groups waiting, so I put my name down. I waited no more than 5 minutes to hear my name called and snagged a spot at the bar before both groups. I guess there's an upside to dining solo!  ;) The waitress was very attentive and took my order immediately -- Daikoku ramen. It was nearly 78 degrees outside but that didn't stop me from ordering the hot dish, even though their Tsukemen (cold dish) sounded quite appealing too. I was thinking I would be forgotten about, considering how busy it was (and I could see all the orders coming out), but the waitress came and refilled my water when I least expected it. The soup wasn't too salty (as is the case with most ramen places), the fatty pork was extremely tasty (it melts in your mouth, literally), bamboo was yummy but couldn't get enough (I think they use real!), egg, and bean sprouts were average, and the noodles had a nice bite. Oh, and lots and lots of green onions (my fav!)...If you're not a fan of green onions, you might want to tell them to go easy on it when ordering. Overall, reasonably priced and tasty ramen delivered by attentive wait staff in "Little Tokyo". A good once-every-two-weeks kind of meal. :)

Went here on a Sunday morning at 10.45am and there were already 10 people in front of us.  The place is cozy and I've heard so many great things about how they have the best ramen and friend rice cooked in pork fat.  I've got to say, this place was just okay.  The ramen was good, but not great.  I did like the egg in the ramen though, but I must say I'm more of a shoyu ramen fan.  My favorite place is Minca in the east village and Ippudo is good as well, but I'm new here and can't wait to try more spots.  NYC still has better Ramen, but LA has better Pho and Mexican food.

I've been to Daikokuya three times, and my conclusion is that it is mediocre.  The broth that so many rave about is pretty bland.  I detect very little actual taste in it.  The noodles are nothing to write home about either.   It's still better than many ramen places in LA, though not even close to even a 2 star ramen place in Japan.  Much better off going to the reliable Kouraku for your Little Tokyo ramen fix.  I do love the gyoza here though, and the interior is nice.  But it seemed liked they had recently installed these crazy bright lights that make you feel like you're at a photoshoot.  Not good for a ramen place. Why all the wait, all the time?  I blame Jonathan Gold.  How much does he know about ramen anyway? By the way, the last time I was there, the restaurant's health rating was a "C".  That disgusted me a little.  I think I saw little rats running up and down the kitchen floor, chasing after cockroaches.  Or maybe not, but the "C" rating made me nervous about seeing such things.

So me and my friends went down to Little Tokyo for ramen and karaoke to celebrate the end of second term. My friend was talking about this GREAT ramen place (it was apparently so good, that he only could eat pork from this place). So we get down to Daikokuya by way of train and feet. We're all really hungry and so we put our name in. The wait turns out to be something like 20-30 minutes for a party of 7, but I didn't mind...as hungry as I know I was. I order the ramen, some sake, and iced green tea. This ramen so far is pretty hyped up and I haven't even tasted it yet! So the wait wasn't bad for our food to come by even though the place was pretty packed, which is awesome. Finally, our food is here! I just dig in. The pork...absolutely lives up to the hype! It was tender, full of flavor, and a beautiful cut. Sadly, it only came with 2 slices! The noodles were pretty hard and really not that great in terms of texture and flavor (I'm just a huge fan of soft noodles). The broth was ok...I've had better. It just wasn't strong enough...the broth and noodles should have been the star of the bowl, not the pork (as great as the pork was). I really wasn't impressed, and it quite honestly didn't live up to the hype. Even hype aside, it just wasn't a great bowl of ramen. Daikokuya needs to get its priority strait when it comes to ramen. The noodles and the broth should be kicking ass, not just the pork.

If your only concept of ramen is a cheap, dry brick of noodles you pour water over, this place will spoil you forever. This is by far the best ramen house in Los Angeles. The secret is the rich, meaty broth that hugs you like a warm down jacket. They slow-boil pork bones for over 24 hours to pull all the meaty goodness from the marrow. The result is unlike anything you've ever had before. I always start off with an appetizer of little sausages sauteed with onions and mustard-- Yum! Be prepared to wait for a seat, however. This place is too popular for its own good!

The Daikokuya ramen has a beautiful kotteri broth that clouded and melted into the noodles but never seemed to over power the wheat flavor of the noodle. Kurobuta pork, dark, thinly sliced and marbled with fat, comes simmering in the broth (rather than topping it) as well as on the side. With plenty of green onions topping, this made for a tasty bowl of ramen.

YO! SO YUMMY! Even though I had to travel an hour or so to get here and despite waiting 2 hours to even get a seat at this restaurant, I still loved it! It was well worth the wait, but then again, I do love my ramen! I usually eat at Santouka which is also very very good! But, Daiokokuya's ramen was of a different type. The broth is much lighter than your average ramen shop, and the noodles were, of course, very well made. This is a very small restaurant so I can forgive them for the wait because there was simply so much business! Besides, the surrounding area is little tokyo, so there are plenty of shops to satisfy you as you wait for your seat. I wasn't bored at all, and loved shopping around in little tokyo The price for the ramen combo is very very reasonable for the amount of food you get. Ramen can be a little expensive, but at Daikokuya you definitely get your fill of food. The combo comes with a ramen, of course, a salad, and a bowl of rice with a topping of your choice! This place is great and I would love to come back, prepared for the wait!

Even though I don't live in LA, having a daikokuya in LA would make me move here.  I've only been here twice, and in my soul I know I could eat here everyday without growing tired of it.   for those of you in Sac who love Shoki, you should try daikokuya.  The food speaks for itself, and this place will most likely to change your standards of proper, well executed ramen!  It's worth the trip!  For the locals that have yet to come here, Please, support this amazing establishment!  be ready to wait roughly 45min if you don't show early, and there's no call-in to go.  It's worth the trip and the wait!  No matter where you reside, try this place out!!

If you want ramen, look no further, this is the best ramen place in LA (down town to the pier at least).  When ever we crave ramen, we come here.  There's always a line, so you'll just have to deal with it.  There's always parking around... We usually park at a meter a couple blocks away.  Enjoy it and get there early to wait in line!

Omg so freaken delicious!  At first I was skeptical about this place.  What's so special about ramen? It's just packaged noodles you can buy at the supermarket and cook at home for more than half the price.  Boy was I wrong! This is like special ramen made with special noodles and soup or something cause it's the best noodles I ever ate!  Everything about it was perfect: the noodles, the soup, the taste *drools* Oh, and the shredded pork bowl! *drools more* So so so so yummy! I literally wanted to go back the next day for it.  The meat was nice and tender and the flavors of the vegetables mixed with the rice, oh man! So sad I'm so far away.  I wonder if they do long distance delivery...

The best ramen place in LA!  No one else comes close to this place.  They take their ramen so seriously that they actually close up shop if they run out of noodles, even though they serve many other tasty dishes.  One of their best non-ramen dishes is the Unagi-don.  The eel just melts in your mouth and is never too salty, a common problem with other places.  All of their rice bowls come with a salad which has an amazing house dressing on it.  A must visit for any tourist!

This is THE best ramen place I have EVER been.  And I've been to the "best ramen" in San Francisco, Mountain View, and several other ramen places in LA.  I go here allllll the time and wish I still lived close by! It is a small location so you will most likely have to wait depending on what time you go.  They are open pretty late, but this place is popular and usually has a crowd of people waiting to eat.  I've waited as long as 45 minutes before (I was craving it! Had to get my fix!), but no more than 5-10 minutes when I got there at a less crowded time (maybe once or twice was seated immediately).  For best results, go in a small group (2 people?), so you can sit at the bar for a shorter wait.   I always get the ramen combination with sashimi or teriyaki chicken.  It comes with a small salad, and the house dressing is so good!  The combinations have too much food (the ramen alone makes you leaving feeling bloated full with ramen goodness), but I get them for the salad and usually take the side home with me.  I've also had their gyoza appetizer, and it is tasty as well.   Many drinks have free refills, and the service for drink refills is really good (you will be offered a refill rather promptly).  They also have iced oolong (not in a can), which is my favorite to get.

This is one of my top ramen places. The broth is rich and flavorful and most importantly, not too salty. The noodles are chewy and have a good consistency. If the egg was soft boiled this place would move a bit higher on my list. Overall though it's good eats! I also tried their donburi options but they are just average for me.

One of the best ramen places I've been to in LA.  In the Summer time they have the cold noodles w/ chicken and some veggies mixed with their own sauces and I'd have to say IMO that taste better than the soupy ramen.  I wonder if the the reason their ramen blows others out of the water is due to the rumored rat problems in their kitchen.  If so I guess rats do really know how to cook!  Ratatouille, Japanese style anyone?

friend:  "Hey, there are already ppl standing in line"   me:  Lol, wtf, stop messing w/ me.   friend:  " No, really, there are ppl there" me:  WTF, why are we still in the hotel room! So, I hurried my ass down, threw my shit in the whip, and hustled across the street so I wouldn't have to wait for an hour to eat. 20min. past and my friends finally came and being that I am "samart" I told the chick that we have 6 ppl but we will split up and sit separately.  Zing, she smile and said ok. Just like a sushi bar, I like to sit at the bar and watch them expertly prepare the meals ppl order. 2 chefs , 1 was on ramen duty and his hand was the measuring unit.  I love it, 1 handful of ramen in th strainer, 1 handful of sprouts, 1 handful of Scallions (my fav.)  what can be better? the other chef was strictly on other dish duty. This place is tiny and the booths match the size.  Booths should only sit 4 ppl tops and even w/ 4 ppl, the guy between the wall and the other person doesn't have enough arm room. Food: Menu - didn't really notice - I didn't look past the ramen section I got the Koterri Flavor ( back fat flavor)  Wth, why not, ya only live once. It came in a good size bowl, the Ramen was perfectly cooked (al dente) the broth was heaven and the slices of the pork belly was Orgasmic!  I threw in the extra ginger and pureed garlic and some spice.  Heaven! Oh, the egg that came w/ the ramen was expertly cooked, the yoke in the center was not fully cooked .... they are on top of their game. I wish I had more of the pork but ... I would've never finish everything because I also ordered the Gyoza. Gyoza was fantastic, prob. the best I've ever had!  They cooked it and flattened it, threw a handful of scallions on top and it came w/ a killer ponzu sauce.  to friggin die for. I use to think Santa Ramen in San Mateo was the best, but I believe this place has edge it out.  I don't feel bloated and sleepy after I left Daikokuya but I do feel that way after leaving santa ramen ...and Santa Ramen leaves a weird after taste.

This was not love at first bite. Let me explain. My sister has this annoying tendency to overhype the hell out of everything so naturally I was underwhelmed when my bowl of ramen wasn't shooting off fireworks and gleaming of gold. In addition to the fact that I had this silly expection of ramen to be served in a quality and caliber of the deliciousness I had fallen in love with at Santoka. Waiting for over an hour in the pouring rain did not make matters any better. Now that I am an older and wiser ramen lover, I have had much better experiences at Daikokuya. I have learned to be more patient and just walk across the street to shop around Little Tokyo during the hour or so wait. I have accepted that I cannot have my ramen cooked to my particular specifications as I can at Shinsengumi but that by not doing so, I can still enjoy their great ramen. I have never bothered to try any of their chains besides their Little Tokyo location because of all the negative reviews I have heard about the one in Hacienda Heights and elsewhere despite their closer proximity. Apparently they are all nothing compared to the original. I have also made SURE to order the fattier version and an egg with my ramen, and no where else, or else I shall be severely disappointed by a hard boiled egg. The real gem at Daikokuya are their perfectly cooked eggs. I kid you not, they are the star of the dish. Daikokuya has somehow managed to figure out that perfect doneness in between a soft and hard boiled egg that has soaked up that yummy tonkotsu broth. If you would like, the fried rice is also an adequate substitute for the takana fried rice I usually order with my ramen at Shinsengumi. As are most Japanese places, this place is frikken TINY. I heard from someone that Japanese businesses like to take over small spaces so the rent is cheaper but I think it's because it causes a line out the door if their food is good enough. This in turn makes people passing by wonder why that place is worth waiting for and increases their patronage. Good luck with parking, that's all I have to say! I distinctly recall that the last time I was standing outside waiting, a tour group for food? was passing by and the tour guide was showing them Daikokuya as THE restaurant to try. Gotta love LA! Long story short: From a ramen snob to you, Daikokuya most certainly and obviously makes the cut as an amazing place to have ramen if you can't quite justify buying a plane ticket straight to Japan for your lunch break!

This is the best Ramen place I have eaten in California thus far. The only other one that might come close is Orenchi Ramen located in the Bay Area. Our party arrived right before they were open so we were seated immediately. We all ordered the Daikokuya Ramen and it was everything I thought it would be. Flavorful broth, chewy noodles, and they actually give a lot of meats and vegetables to go with it. Another plus is the prices they charge. They could easily charge $2 more than they do for their ramen and would still have a line out the door. I would definitely recommend this place if you're a ramen lover. Just be sure to come in soon after they have opened. There is usually a high demand for their bowls of goodness.

Previously I thought that the special Daikoku ramen was "just okay," but after trying it a second time, I have changed my mind!  It's so effing amazing that I sat through a hot and sweaty ramen session a few afternoons ago for this stuff.  The last time I went was at night, during winter (granted it's winter in LA... but still...) so I didn't remember that the one fan in the place blew on one table haha.  BUT, even though I felt disgusting afterwards, I think I'd go back again in 90+ degree heat for that delicious broth!!

2 people, saturday night, 6pm.  sure, you will have to wait about 15 minutes to get seated.  trust me, it's worth it. I hail from the land of not so good ramen (SF), but every time i'm remotely near here, i am just drawn to japantown. get the ramen.  get it kotteri (rich with bits of pig BACK FAT), and get the combo with the shredded pork bowl.  OMFG that is by far the meal that i will eat the night before i am electrocuted to death. if only that could be my daily meal, then i would truly be "living the dream"

My friend compared this place to in-n-out for ramen... not a lot of selection but solid for what it offers. There's only one type of ramen, but it's dayum good. I personally like having a spicy broth and chicken karaage but don't get me wrong I still thing the ramen here is dayum good. You have to get here early and they don't do take-out. This place opens at 12 on weekends and we had a friend waiting in line at 11:45 and we got the last seats so get here early! Seriously, the way people were lined up for this place you would swear it was like crack, MSG crack, perhaps. We also had the fried spicy tuna which was tuna wrapped in basil w/panko and deep fried. This dish also came with a dipping salt which I'm 99% sure is just MSG because nothing else tastes so dayum good. The noodles are "al dente" and the pork in the ramen was cooked to perfection. Super tender and flavorful!

YUM. This is the best ramen I have had outside of Japan. Delicious broth, great noodle consistency, and rich, fatty pork that melts in your mouth. Customers and servers were speaking Japanese. The only downside was the wait-time. The two of us waited an hour to be seated, and we arrived at 3 PM on a Saturday, which we thought would be an off-time. Apparently, it's ALWAYS ramen time. Next time, we'll go on a weekday.

I love this place because the broth for their ramen is really good, not too overpowering for whatever you order, and great flavour to boot. It's a pity their prices for certain items shot up considerably while their portions became drastically smaller (from a large bento box to a small bowl you can fit in your hand, for example), and of course, there's always a wait to be seated and served.

1. Go there. 2. Order the ramen. 3. Experience happiness. This ramen is amazing. I don't have a ton of experience with ramen, but my Japanese boyfriend says it's the best ramen he's had outside of Tokyo. The first thing you notice about the ramen is the broth. We're not talking about some wimpy oversalted thin broth. They must boil the bones for hours with magic because it is thick and rich and tastes exactly like what you want tonkotsu broth to taste like. It's totally cloudy and doesn't look like much until it you taste it and you realize why you can't see through it. I didn't order the kotteri flavor, but it honestly didn't need it. The regular broth is so rich you don't feel like you're missing anything. The pork is delicious - not tough at all, and no extra fat. The noodles were perfectly cooked, not mushy at all. There was a hard boiled egg, which I didn't eat (no room), but my boyfriend claims they cook it well. It does get super busy - I managed to walk right in at noon on a Saturday and get a stool at the bar, but I was by myself. When I left there was probably a dozen people outside. But you get more than enough to eat for a really decent price. I felt really awesome when I left. Then I explored little Tokyo before getting my mochi gelato on at Mikawaya with what little room was left in my stomach.

The ramen here is pretty good and tastes just like the ramen I had when I was in Tokyo, which is always a good sign! (on a side note some people say that $7.50 for a bowl of ramen is a good deal, I tend to disagree. Even in Tokyo you can get a bowl of ramen of similar quality for 750 yen, which is about $6.40 with today's exchange rates, and that includes tax and tip). Anyhow, since there has already been so many reviews for this place, I can't say much that hasn't already been said. The ramen was good; the broth was a bit too salty for my tastes but still good. I'd suggest not ordering a drink since they charge you $1.75 for a can of coke and glass with ice in it. Instead, order the ramen combo with a side of katsu don or fried rice or whatever. Of course, get there early or be prepared for a wait.

Don't be ashamed, it's ok to have your head halfway in your bowl, slurping up the delicious ramen, basking in the simple sumptuousness of the broth, and ignoring your company. It happens to everyone here, the ramen is just that good. There's really not much to add that hasn't been said: be ready for a long wait (even at midnight), get the ramen with kotteri, bring cash, try not to over-order (just the ramen is enough for most, though I do love the shredded pork bowl combo), and try to remember to talk to your friends. This is one place you don't need to lower your expectations of before going. They're so consistently good it's criminal.

Wow I can't believe I didn't review this place! Great ramen, just the right texture with the perfect broth. Service can be a bit meh sometimes but I'm a little more forgiving when it comes to hole in the wall joints. The wait is ridiculous sometimes, and now that street parking lasts until 8pm ($2/hr, bring plenty of quarters or make sure to park on a meter that accepts cards), your meal will be a little more expensive than you originally anticipated. Just carpool and head on over.

The average wait time for this little hole in the wall is usually anywhere from 45 mins to over an hour and half for me, but it has always been worth the wait! This is the best ramen I have ever had... It has the most amazing homemade pork stock, perfectly cooked noodles, and my personal favorite, hard boiled egg. I usually order an extra egg, in fact. Boyfriend is  obsessed with the Kichi-men, which is also very good - all of the components of the house ramen are sliced for easy dipping into a pungent, slightly sour, slightly spicy broth. Delicious! And everything tastes better with a bit of Sriracha :) Also recommended are the gyoza and fried tuna appetizers. LOVE sitting at the bar and watching the cooks. If you can find the patience to endure the wait time, Daikokuya is one of the best places in LA to find a solid bowl of legitimate ramen.

Love, love, love the unagi bowl. The salad is awesome. The dressing is so delish... has an oniony flavor, sweet and tangy... makes you want more than the small bowl they give you! The soup is flavorful with a  comforting touch... I I normally just get the unagi bowl there. It just melts in your mouth. unagi is so tender and flavorful.. hmm.... I can still taste it in my mouth =)  Its a small place so you have to come early and expect to wait a while. However, It's worth the wait. After we eat there, I love walking around the shopping center and browse. Can't leave without getting any fresh mochi!

My favorite ramen place in LA. Haven't found anywhere else with such a tasty tonkotsu broth and well cooked ramen. Since there's already a shitload of reviews here, I just want to add that the owner opened another restaurant in Little Tokyo on 2nd St called Ebisu and I've been trying to figure why the hell they don't serve the ramen there. I've asked the waiter a couple times but he just says, "Sorry, no ramen here". The wait at Daikokuya is ridiculous and Ebisu is 5 times the size and empty everytime I've walked by there. C'mon, open your eyes, owner-san.

Delicious pork ramen and gyoza.  Pork is moist and fatty, ramen is al dente, and the soup is rich & hot with plenty of bamboo shoots and green onions.  Fast service.  I'd say Daikokuya is the only thing that made jury service in downtown LA bearable....at least you can look forward to lunch!!!

some friends of mine from school introduced this place to me about 3 years ago, and i've been a fan since! i've tried to introduce this place to as many people as possible. i even got my boyfriend hooked, and for awhile, we were eating there at least once a week! the place is tiny and the average wait is about 45 minutes, but most people don't seem to mind. (though i wouldn't advise going there if you're completely starving, cause the wait could drive you mad.) and because of the small space, smaller parties would most likely end up sitting at the "bar", which is fine, but because i don't like putting my bag on the floor i end up wearing it and it's a tad annoying while eating. i always get the kotteri (sp?) style ramen, the one with extra (pork) back-fat! it makes a huge difference. since going with my boyfriend, we've made it a habit to order a side of gyoza and a plate of fried rice. the gyoza is really good and the fried rice has a really nice taste to it... probably the back-fat as well. the ramen consists of bamboo shoots, which i like, savory pork meat, onions, and their egg. OMG, the egg. i LOVE eggs, and their egg is perfect. the taste of the soup is stewed in, and the yolk isn't fully cooked--not raw, but still orange and a little soft. in other words, perfection. i've tried other ramen places but none have compared to this, although rumor has it that shinsengumi in rosemead is way better! i'll be the judge of that. this place is probably intended for smaller groups, 5 people at the most. their booths seat about 4 and they can bring around an extra chair, but most of the larger groups get separated. definitely a place to stop by if you're ever in la!

Seems like every other ramen place I've been to, but the atmosphere and decor makes it feel a little more authentic. The restaurant itself is extremely small and stuffy; and there was a long wait outside for seating. : ( I would not suggest sitting at the bar because the "kitchen area" will definitely raise the temperature of the space and make it much more difficult to carry a conversation The combo meal, which includes a bowl of ramen and a side-dish of your choice, is well worth the money if you're looking for good eats for a good price. The soup is pretty flavorful, and it goes well with the noodles and egg especially. Although there was a little too much vegetables and shredded meat for my taste, the dish as a whole was tasty.

Can this place get any cooler???  Everything about this place keeps me coming back. The food, the service, the people in line and yes, even the section of Los Angeles that it resides in. While in line a few of us started talking about how long we would wait to get in this place. A newbe chimed in and said I was "crazy in the nut,your crazy in the coconut". Well, that best describes me alright. She later told me that was from a song by the group Avalanche called "Frontier Psychiatrist". Looked them up and found they were a pretty cool band. Thanks mystery girl!!! As I wrote before,yes you will wait. But you will love this place. Daikokuya, I love you man!

I really wanted some GOOD RAMEN when I was in LA and this was our last stop before we flew back. We got here at 12:05 they open at 12:00 and there was already a wait.. 8 parties in front of us. We waited about 40 minutes in the crazy heat. Even though we were eating ramen in a 90 degree weather, it was still enjoyable the soup was really good much better than the ramens in SF.

I'm not sure why I'm even yelping this, given the number of reviews already posted for this restaurant, but here goes. I don't care if the parking situation is terrible, and that the wait could be anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour -  this place is worth the wait. The broth is extremely rich (liquid meat as my friend likes to call it) and the noodles are cooked to perfection. I can't eat this everyday as I'm sure it will clog my arteries, but I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the need for some good comfort food! LOVED IT!

A friend recommended this ramen house for a cold winter evening and it turned out to be a perfect choice.  I ordered the Daikokuya Ramen (their specialty and only ramen, served with pork, broiled egg, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts and green onions) Combo with a small teriyaki eel bowl (three pieces of eel over rice).  The broth was dense and full of flavors (you can read their website for a brief description of the process of making the broth, pretty interesting).  The noodle was firm and chewy, unlike the instance noodle-style served in many ramen restaurants.  For the first time, I saw a full egg (as opposed to half-egg) served in a ramen bowl.  It was cooked to just the right amount to be solid outside with semi-liquid yoke in the inside.  The teriyaki eel bowl was also impressive with tender and tasty eel over sticky and chewy rice.  Overall, it was as if they knew exactly what I like of a ramen noodle soup.  I felt very fulfilled and all of that for only about $13 + tax & tip.   Note that this place is very small and popular.  If you show up during high traffic hour, expect a wait of 30 minutes to over an hour.

Came here on a sunday around 5PM and got seated an hour later. I always see lines in front of this place and figured that the wait was pretty normal. Most of us got the combo...I got the ramen and unagi bowl combo. The ramen is satisfactory and the unagi was tender and well cooked. Definitely worth the wait and the combo didn't really hurt the wallet. One small note...try to get seated further into the restaurant because there are usually tons of hungry people still waiting by the door staring at you eating your every bite. It was kind of awkward we sat in the booth near the door...it wasn't like we were done eating and just lounging around taking up the table and making other people wait. During my meal I would just be eating normally and some couple would just stare at me...like mid-bite I'd catch them...and they wouldn't stop starig! Probably a rare case, but strange nonetheless.

see those 4 stars up there? if you've met me and you've heard me talk about daikokuya, you're probably wondering where the 5th star went because i tell anyone who'll listen that daikokuya has the best ramen in all the land. and they do...the ramen is top-effing-notch. from the abundance of green onions to the whole hardboiled egg to the giant slabs of pork...it's perfection in a bowl. it's the kind of perfection you're willing to ignore the C rating and endure the 45 minute wait for...yeah, it's that good. so just where is that 5th star? it's in the broke-ass toilet that's in the stank-ass ladies' room, that's where. come on, daikokuya...how about you fix that toilet and bring a mop and some disinfectant by every once in awhile? you fix the bathroom situation and i'm yours forever.

Came here on a Wednesday night because my sister told me how great this ramen place was! I had the Daikoku ramen--the broth, noodles, and pork was delicious, although my egg was a little bit cold on the inside. Not sure if that's how it's supposed to be? :/ I can't give this place 5 stars because my experience was less than perfect. For one, we were skipped over on the list which made our wait even longer than it already was. Secondly, I was randomly sucker-punched by a bum who was clearly on drugs. No one from the restaurant did anything, except for a really kind man waiting outside wearing a fedora. Didn't catch his name, but he got me a towel and ice, and even paid for our meal! What an outstanding citizen. You made my experience better after such an awful night. Would I ever return again? Sure, but next time, I'll be wearing a football helmet! :P hah

One word for this place: yummy!!!! I haven't had anything there that wasn't superb. The ramen of course is the star, but I've also had the tempura, sushi, and fried rice. It's definitely hard to put down the spoon and chopsticks even when I'm full. I just wished that they did takeout.

The ramen is awesome, that's their specialty.  But there other dishes are just as good from the gyoza to the fried rice and bbq pork bowl.  OMG they know how to prepare pork belly to it's yummiest existence.

After hearing all the rave about this place, I decided to try it out one day. My friend and I got there around 5:30ish and had to wait about 30 minutes to get seated. Although the waitress said the AC was on, it was definitely like a steam tank in there and people didn't have the decency or the sense to keep the door closed. One tip is don't ever sit at the bar stands in front of the kitchen!! It's literally like a sauna there! Nonetheless the food was good. My friend got the regular ramen and I got the kichimen ramen which is a sour/spicier version of the regular. The regular broth for me tastes better than the kichimen broth. They were both good but not the best ramen I've ever had because I honestly prefer spicy miso (which they do not have) I'd still recommend coming here for the experience!

there's a reason the line is always retardedly long. the ramen noodles are firm, both the kotteri(extra rich made with backfat) and regular broth are rich and so gratifying, and the pork is soooo delicious. Broth is on the saltier side, but I LOVE SALT and retaining water doesn't bother me. my mouth is watering as i'm writing this...on a hot day, i usually get the broth separate from the noodles. also, spicy tuna wrapped shiso tempura is a yummy appetizer, but i go there specifically for pork ramen. YUM.

Hands down, one of the best Ramen joint in LA. I've been wanting to eat here for a while and yesterday was the day. One tip, make sure to get there early. The door opens at 11am and there's already a big group of people outside (Sat). But once you are in, the service is good and fast. Pros: - They start you off with a nice and refreshing side salad. - Easy Menu, there's only 1 ramen broth choice. Meaning that they focused their time and energy perfecting their broth. - Broth/Soup was amazing, really nice beefy flavor without the extreme saltiness you get from Santouka or Shin Sen Gumi. You can really taste the creamy beef flavor. - Tokotsu was cooked perfectly, very moist and falling apart good. - Noodle was cooked just the way I like them, aldente. Regular style noodles, no thin style noodles like Shin Sen Gumi. Which I prefer. - Big Portion. For $8.50, you get a bowl bigger than most Ramen Places. I was literally full at finishing my Bowl and did not even finish my side dish (Shredded pork bowl) - I like the ambience, I know the shop feels old and run down, but it has that classic hole in the wall japanese restaurant feel. - Service was fantastic, the servers where quick to get our drinks and order. Quick to refill our drinks also which is a big plus. Cons: - Not really a con, but I wish that they would cut their seasoned hard boiled egg in half. - Presentation, could be better. Luckily I was really hungry and didn't even care.   - I wish they had topping options. It was good without them, but I really like bamboo shoots and toasted garlic on my ramen :( Overall, it was a great experience. The food was excellent, the staff was great and I will definitely eat here again when I visit Little Tokyo. I give this place my Ramen Stamp of Approval.

The ramen rocks.  No doubt.  Have not been here in years but it is just as I remember.  The noodles have just the right flavor and texture.  The broth is pretty amazing.  My friend said I should get the fried rice side and it was  the right choice.  as for portions, I was pretty stuffed.  It is far better to get there early (like before 7) because it gets crowded really fast.  Not much in the way of decor but service is ok and good bang for your buck.

Thought we were brilliant to come on a night of torrential rain. Not. The wait was still ~ 60 mins. It's the most just-right al dente ramen noodles I've had. Soup base a tad on the salty side.

The ramen was superb, the broth is boiled through out the night so you really get a good flavor.

Great. Ramen. Make sure to get it if you go, that's what it's known for and for very good reason - it's delicious.  The broth and noodles are mad flavorful, you get a pile of scallions to mix in, really tender meat, bean sprouts, and an egg that's perfectly cooked with a yolk that isn't entirely done. It's fantastic, filling, and pretty cheap for the amount you get. The shredded pork bowl and pork cutlet bowl are pretty good, if you get the combo ramen with a bowl, you're probably not finish the bowl and have something to take home and microwave for a meal the next day that'll still taste pretty dang good.  There's a salad at the beginning of the meal also that has this great sauce that's like an asian version of thousand island dressing. great place that you seriously need to go to. if you were checking reviews to decide, stop checking. just go.

I've gone here numerous times and everytime I leave very satisfied. However, despite the amazing food, the wait is what gets me the most. I once waited for over an hour with a party of 4 on a Saturday night. Holy Moly. We were hungry enough to go kill and eat some wild racoons in the alley. Thankfully, they called us just in time. But remember to be prepared for a wait. Anyways, staff is super friendly and the food is just awesome. If you live in Los Angeles, you should definitely try Daikokuya! ;)

Oh Daikokuya, how I love thee. You get the honor of being my first review after three years of Yelping :] My love affair with ramen started back in 7th grade, with my visit to the Shin-Yokohama Ramen Museum in Japan. Since that time, I've been obsessed with ramen, travelling all around the Bay Area in search of the perfect bowl. Sadly, I could not find the taste I was looking for in Norcal (until Orenchi came along). I though I was stuck going back to Japan every year to get my authentic ramen fix. And for a while, that's actually what occurred. Flashforward to my freshman year at USC. I kept hearing people rave about Daikokuya in Little Tokyo, but I must admit I was skeptical, after being disappointed so many times. Plus, having no car meant it would be troublesome getting there. Luckily, one random evening, my friends and I decided to take an adventure, and called a taxi to take us over to Daikokuya. After the first bite: OMG. Finally, the taste I was waiting for. I couldn't believe it so I took another bite. Yep, it was true. My search was over. The noodles had great consistency, the pork was delicious, and the broth was flavorful. Plus, I love their boiled egg. The price is decent, and with the combo, I always feel like I'm getting my money's worth Say what you want about the absurd wait times (my record: 2 hours), stuffy interior (seriously, its like a sauna), and sometimes (regrettably) wavering quality. To me, this is still by far the best ramen I've had this side of the Pacific Ocean (and yes, I've been to Santouka and Shinsengumi).

This place is as close to Japan as it gets. The delicious pork broth with noodles and then you top it with their freshly minced garlic, makes my mouth water just thinking about it . To be safe, be sure whomever you go with eats the minced garlic too. I religiously order the combination with Ramen and Katsudon, all for only 13 bucks. You know a place is good when you have to wait an hour for 2 people and every restaurant around them are dead.

Extra pork fat you say?  Quit playing with my emotions.  In a world thats gone bonkers with organic this or health food that, its a blessing in disguise when you can openly ask for extra fat in your ramen without people looking at you like a leper holding a sparkler.  It's a small place with street parking but as others have mentioned, be prepared to wait for a table.  Sometimes it takes awhile but tonight wasn't so bad.  10-15 min.  Ordered their famous Daikoku Ramen with the extra fat.  Mmmm Mmmm so good.  Added a lil chili oil and some pureed garlic and I was in heaven.  The downside?  You can't order this to go.

I always eat here everytime I go Little Tokyo or just in downtown period! It always amazes me how their ramen is always fresh when served. The only thing I can say is the waiting list will really make you wait. Best time to go would be at lunch time on weekdays. I also like their Eel bowl as I always choose it as my side bowl order when you get the Ramen combo, only cost about 15 bucks which is pretty enough for two. but ofcourse, I always come hungry and able to finish it all. lol. will be back for some more ramens!

What a great Japanese ramen place!  Whenever I got sick of studying for exams at my school library, I took a trip down to Little Tokyo and enjoyed this succulent dish.  The broth is on the heavy side, so if you are looking for something light, this is not a good dish for you.  But the depth of the flavor from the broth is just so satisfying.

My sis in NY told me to try this place when she heard I was going to LA.  She told it was even better than our fav ramen place, Santa Ramen, in the SF Bay Area...and better than the best in NY!  Well, OK, then!  I was sceptical but as she does try all the NY restaurants and has the same taste buds as me, I thought I'd better give it a try. She was right!  This place was AMAZING!  The ramen was superb and for an extra $3.50 (bringing meal to $11), I got the combo with the shredded pork rice bowl someone on yelp recommended.  You know what?  "Shredded pork rice bowl" doesn't sound too exciting but it was, perhaps, even better than the superb ramen itself!  It's not diet food but the pork was little diced pieces of heaven - part of it was butter soft and the other part had a crunch to it.  All topped with a sweet sauce.  My 12 year old son asked to try it and he ate it all!!!!  I had to order up another combo meal so I could get my share of the food.  Needless to say, my 10/12 year old kids loved this place just as much as me. We went early around 4:30 on a weekday and we only waited 10 minutes or so.  Go after 5:00 and you'll be waiting for a while. After an excellent meal, the kids enjoyed the Japanese toy shop next door and we also did a stroll around Little Toykyo with the cute little outdoor mall/shops just across the street. I'll be making a stop here everytime I go to LA!

Some of the best noodles I've rated in all of Los Angeles. I would give it 5 stars, but you do more often than not have to wait to get in. The place feels a bit weathered, but that could be part of its charm. This is a great place to chow down after visiting MOCA.

PERIOD. -yes, agreed small & compacted & THEY NEED A BIGGER RESTAURANT LOCATION in Little Tokyo !! -it's like 8- 10 bucks & they have cheap curry here & teriyaki bowls, so worth it, come as fast as you can ASAP -the soup was amazing !! -oh yea the parking wise, prepare for a big bill or park on the streets :D

This place is the best ramen place! The portion is big and I can't even finish the entire bowl. The soup is yummy and there are a good portion of other ingredients in the bowl, such as the pork and beansprouts. This is my must-go-to place whenever I go to L.A. Although I have to always wait for seating, but it's totally worth the wait :) Plus, I can go around Little Tokyo when I'm waiting, which is always entertaining.

I went to the Daikokuya in Hacienda Heights. The ramen was alright, but I thought it wasn't salty enough. I did a 1/2 ramen 1/2 teriyaki chicken bowl. I didn't find the chicken bowl too extraordinary. Ehh, maybe my taste buds are catered to NorCal japanese food.

They only really have one ramen, the Tonkotsu, but they have mastered making it. The ramen is delicious, you could order it kotteri style for a richer broth. The portions are pretty large for the price and is very filling. Overall the ramen is excellent, the only downside from this place getting 5 stars was it took me 2 hours to get a seat.

I waited almost an hour and a half for ramen and I was completely satisfied. My friends and I walked around Little Tokyo to keep ourselves busy. If you go and it's poppin, sign in & ask the waiter when you should come back. It's worth it to explore the small shops while waiting for good ramen. Really. I believe so. Simple & delicious. :)

I love ramen and have been to my share of ramen places and daikokuya is my favorite. the ramen soup base is one simple base so you can't order different styles like miso or shoyu.  the problem is that it's usually crowded so you've got to wait cuz that place is small. something ppl don't know is that it was shut down like 2 years ago cuz of bad santitation. but that didn't stop me from going there. ramen is a must and try the shredded pork bowl.

Been hearing about this place from various friends so I thought I would finally check the place out.  Ordered the Daikoku Tsukemen since I thought I would be adventurous over the regular ramen.  The noodles were GREAT, so yummy as ramen noodles should be. The broth was good not quite like Satouka in that I saw no layer of good ole fat as it cooled. Would definitely come back.

When it is cold and raining, the perfect thing to do is get some soup.  I love the cute decor of this place.  It gives me a feeling of being in a small quaint noodle house in Tokyo.  It is here I discovered Tsukemen Ramen, which is having all the ramen elements put on a plate and then I can dip in the ingredients into the soup.  I also like that you can sit at the counter and watch the cooks prep your soup.  The noodles taste fresh.  It can get very crowded, so it is good to come early.  I only gave this spot 4 stars because the last time I went there, the soup was a tad bit salty, but the pork is yummy, yummy.

My friend from LA told me this place gets really packed and crowded for lunch and dinner and it is supposedly the best ramen place in Japan town so I wanted to check it out.  When we got there, there were alot of pepole waiting outside.  It is a small little restaurant and we got the special Daikokuya ramen which was pretty good.  I'm not a really big fan of ramen in general but the broth was really good and the gyoza that we ordered on the side was also good.  Personally, I'd rather get a good bowl of pho instead of ramen but it was pretty good for my first time eating Japanese ramen.  Apparently, people think this place is good because even when we were leaving, there were a group of people waiting outside.

Delicious! just like the other reviews said. Be prepared for a long wait! The place is small, so there are not many tables, but the service is quick.  Their portions are really large.  The ramen + small rice bowl combo + salad was wayyyyyy too much food for me.  I had to take the entire rice bowl home, and half the ramen home...and ramen doesn't usually make good leftovers.  The gyoza is pretty good too! I think one combo + gyoza is a good amount of food for two people.

This place and Orrochon are two of my favorite ramen places in the Japan town area.  I usually head to Orrochon only when this place is too packed or I have a craving for some spicy ramen.  Daikokuya is honestly the best Tonkatsu Ramen I have ever had.  And the great thing about this place is they give you the pork, bean sprouts and dyed egg, unlike other ramen places where you have to add items and pay for them individually.

Shmen 1 N 1, I couldn't care less about the swine flu if that means I can still eat at this homage to our snouted friends.  I ordered the hot ramen, and it was literally a religious experience - I had no idea pork could be so succulent, so tender, so explosive.  The thin slices of the Berkshire pork seemed to melt into everything - the broth, the ramen, my mouth!  The broth was truly divine - I swear I saw the Virgin of Guadalupe in the swirling oil slick and floating green onions.  The dish was incredibly well balanced in terms of flavor and texture - I especially enjoyed the pickled veggies at the bottom of the bowl.  I was worried that the heaping pile of green onions they threw on top would be overwhelming, but it really wasn't - it in fact really helped to enhance the overall texture.  And the ambiance was nice too - I call it crowded chic - as in, the place was so crowded, and we were sitting so bunched together at the kitchen-side barstools, that it had to have looked really trendy from a certain perspective. But I'm going to keep coming back to the pork.  Despite what John Mccain might think, I never want to cut this pork (or the luscious fat marbled throughout) out of my spending bill.

The first time I went to this place I fell in love with their ramen and for some reason it wasn't too crowded.  The second time the line was pretty long but I know it's worth the wait.  It all changed when I had to use the restroom. Yikes!!! That's when I lost my appetite. I value a clean restroom. If the toilet bowl doesn't flush then you're in trouble.  It was really dirty.  I started noticing everything from the table, the floor, etc. It is good but u question if what you're eating is clean. I'm sorry I was really turned off after I used their restroom.  My husband still likes this place though. I prefer Orochan.

Crowded places even on a weeknight is always fun.  I mean, going to an empty restaurant just makes you feel sad.  But onto the food. We got the Fried rice and Ramen set as suggested by another couple in line who also gave us tips on other cool places to go in LA. The food here is good, and even better with my Green Apple Shochu. Hehee. But, like so many other places with a rich broth and generous toppings at no extra charge, the noodles still do not compare to Shin-Sen-Gumi.

Best ramen ever. In little Tokyo, if you get here late just follow the crowd underneath that yellow overhang. It's the only place that has a line outside. You'll probably have to wait and you'll end up smelling like ramen but that's not really a bad thing. I also like the pork slices... melt in your mouth tender. But it's simple, come here and get your ramen. Eat it, enjoy it, drive home in your car and enjoy the smell of ramen from your clothes. Burp and get a second meal.

This place is just okay for me. I've been here multiple times but EVERY TIME the line is just way too long, (min. 40 minutes ish) the restaurant is too dingy, service isn't that great, and parking costs almost as much as the meal. I like their ramen, but it's nothing stellar, I can however appreciate their eel bowls. Those are yum.

My first attempt at ramen was at Mitsuwa market and it left me with a feeling of never wanting to try the flavorless, boring meal again. So naturally when the idea of eating ramen came up, I was hesitant to try, much less pay $9 for something that wouldn't taste as good as shinramen. When the bowl of ramen came, I hesitantly picked up my chopsticks and spoon and went at it. The broth was warm, flavorful, meaty, fatty and so inviting while the noodles have a chewy, al dente style texture that are surprisingly flavorful on their own. As I was eating it, I couldn't believe this was ramen. Where has this been all my life? In between "mmmm" and "this is so good," the pieces of pork and the perfectly marinated egg started to disappear from my bowl. Daikokuya lives up to their reputation. Well worth the 1+ hour wait if your stomach doesn't beat you up first.

A great place to eat some great ramen... the long wait is worth it if your craving their great pork broth. Ive had many of the side meals like shredded pork, chicken and egg, etc. The shredded pork is by far the best in my opinion. The atmosphere is very authentic and it definitely gets hot in there. This is the best ramen i've had. (not very experienced though)

When the wait is no less than 30 minutes everyday all day, you KNOW that something good is waiting for you inside.  Daikokuya is definitely one of those places...BEST RAMEN IN LA! The best thing about this place is the ramen.  If you don't order the ramen then why are you even standing in line?? I don't understand anyone who comes here just to order some tempura and miso... and trust me I've seen it.  The pork ramen is sooo delicious.  It comes with slices of tasty pork, an hefty sized egg, scallions, and probably some other spices/garnishes.  All these combined with their broth and noodles make the perfect meal.  And did I mention their portions are HUGE.  Every time I visit Daikokuya I get the Ramen combination with teriyaki eel bowl or with the shredded pork bowl. The eel is cooked perfectly and the shredded pork is just tasty, especially when you add some red ginger to the mix.  This also comes with a salad of shredded lettuce and some mayonnaise based dressed.  The dressing is a little on the sweet side so I would probably ask for it on the side next time.  A combination ranges from $11.50 to $12.50.  Not a bad price when your ramen bowl is twice the size of your head.  Everything else on the menu is definitely worth the price and I am on a mission to try everything on that menu!  I will always have leftovers when I leave here, and that's not something I would complain about.  Daikokuya in downtown and at home..SCORE! The service is awesome as well.  The ramen always comes out very quickly and piping hot. Just the way I like it!  The bowls take sometime but all come out in a reasonable time.  The waitresses are really nice and attentive.   The overall environment is kind of hectic but when you are enjoying a bowl of ramen it doesn't really matter.  People are waiting outside, waitresses are coming in and out of the kitchen, and Japanese is being heard all over the bar.  But it all adds to the overall ambiance which doesn't bother me at all.  There are several booths & seats at the bar.  I wouldn't come here with more than 4 people because then the wait would be unbearably long.  It took me and my bf about 30 minutes to get a seat at the bar at around 2 pm on a Wednesday with many people still waiting outside at around 3 pm.   The only downside to Daikokuya is the parking [at least in the downtown location].  Mostly all street parking is metered and other lots have rates.  The parking directly in front of the restaurant is metered at $2 an hour.  Talk about pricey, especially if you are waiting for 45 minutes.  The plus side for the meters is that you can pay with card! LOL Not a big plus.  I usually park a few blocks down where the meters are cheaper and walk.   All in all, if you are willing to make the drive to downtown LA then you should definitely, without ANY doubt visit DAIKOKUYA.  You will not be disappointed!!!

We just came back from a grueling Six Flags Magic Mountain adventure and we were dying of hunger since we refused to eat at the ridiculously high price SFMM food. I even forced myself to played DDR before we left and I brought disgrace to the Chinese race. Anyway,  one of my good friends recommend we eat the at the best ramen shop in LA. We had to wait almost an hour to eat there. As the wait was over, me and my brother had the Daikokuya Ramen and we both shared a Cold Ramen. The Cold Ramen was a little disappointing since I thought it would be soba noodles but I was mislead by the wording. It's the same ramen noodles but served like a salad. We chose the peanut/sesame dressing? and that changed the dislike to awesome. I am not really a ramen fan to begin with but this ramen was an exception. It was served in a big bowl filled with about 4 pieces of fatty pork, 1 whole egg, been sprouts, green onions, and some root vegetable that I forgot. The stock was most likely pork flavored. The noodles weren't chewy which I dislike because I am spoiled by chewy soba or udon noodles. The pork fat was fattening but I needed to replenish my fat and cholesterol levels to normal and I was able to restore my glycogen after doing so many flips and twists at Six Flags.

yeah, i had to go back again.  had to, i tell ya.  the ramen, it's just so damned tasty.  and i had to solve the great kotteri broth mystery. arrived at 11:30am on sunday this time.  was seated at the bar in under three minutes even though there were five larger parties on the list ahead of me.  it's a matter of priorities i guess - do you go to a restaurant to eat or to socialize?  i go to eat.  and since you like talking to your three friends so much, you can socialize while you're waiting for a booth, suckas. specified NOT kotteri broth this time and the waiter did a double-take so there it is: i now firmly believe that kotteri has become the default broth unless otherwise requested.   and the kotteri is delightful, to be sure, but i actually preferred the "regular" broth.  why?  there is so very little difference in flavor to my taste but with the kotteri richness removed from the equation, i was finally able to taste and appreciate the thinly-sliced pork inside the soup which the broth had overwhelmed before.   went with another combo (bbq eel this time - not bad but the tuna sashimi is still my favorite pairing) just so i could get me some more of that awesome salad.  still can't winkle the dressing recipe from the staff.  if anyone who reads this ever does, please GIMME!

Not the best ramen I've ever had, my #1 spot still goes to Santouka. The broth was okay as i felt it was missing something. The pork was more on the fatty side as i got more fat than meat. The noodles were a bit undercooked as they were still crunched up together as if they were not boiled long enough. As for the fried rice, i've had better as it was lacking flavor. i wouldnt make the drive down here for the ramen,

INSANE wait. About an hour ....and this was on a week night. But the Ramen is probably the best I've ever had and I've had ramen in Japan. What makes this place especially good is that the pork basically melts in your mouth. Its that tender. The place feels authentic with the japanese waitresses and the small cramped space. Probably wouldn't eat here regularly because of the long wait, but definitely everyone should try this place at least once!

So came here with high expectations from all the hype of my friends and various yelp reviews. Perhaps it might be just me, but I thought the ramen was pretty mediocre. The highlight of the meal was the pork rice bowl that is extra. If I were to rate the meal on just that dish, then Daikokuya would get 5 stars.

am I eating what everyone else is eating? this was my FIRST ramen experience EVER and it was not good! I had the speciality daikoku ramen with kotteri flavor. the broth was too plain and eggy and the pork had a disturbing odor to it. the size is definitely big but I didn't even feel like finishing it. my friend from la boasted about this place and took me to try it but I still don't understand. maybe I'm just not a fan of this type of broth flavor. it was not good to me...and the odor from the pork was NOT normal. I don't plan on coming back.

pretty dang good ramen. and pretty cheap too. its just too bad its so far from the heart of the oc. best ramen on the west coast? thats a hard call to make. between the big three (daiko, shinsen, santouka), the title of #1 is best described as rotating depending on the climate, mood, and care for which ramen heaven is created that day. daiko is pretty dang good though. if i ever find myself on the drive home from an la event or just somehow manage to be lost on the 5 freeway, i would definitely stop in. of course, then i would probably be disappointed that my mini detour turned into a 2 hour distraction bc of the long wait that there most undoubtedly will always be, but dang, when you sit down, and start the slurp into ramen heaven..it just..might...be worth it....

Well well well, if it  isn't Daikokuya.. it's been so many months since I last had these amazeball noodles in my mouth and guess what? I can tell you exactly how good it tasted after this long. Sure, I had to wait an hour for noodles but it was the best hour spent (kill time doing karaoke on stage across the street at the plaza). I made sure to fit this place in on my next visit to LA this month. Hopefully, nothing has changed at Daikokuya!

i have NO idea what legit japanese ramen is supposed to taste like. that's why i went with my good friend who went to japan a while ago. he introduced me here. i am a fan. YES they have the MINI size. which was PERFECT for me. you don't need to get the full-size and try and take it home because honestly, who the hell wants swollen ramen? eat it while its good. the noodles are perfectly al-dente. the soup... ohmy gosh the soup. it IS a bit greasier. what do you expect when they are making a PORK broth. get a grip people. the egg is perfect. if you want a good, genuine soup with some perfectly cooked noodles.. this is your place to go. fried rice. effing. delicious. the wait... everyone knows about the wait. we waited from 8:20 to 10:00. to be honest... jtown aint that poppin. or fun. so.. waiting was annoying. we walked around doing.. nothing. i still have yet to figure out if its worth the close to 2 hour wait, but i have yet to experience more ramen places. how are japanese people so skinny.

As good as it gets authentic ramen. The place is tiny and you have to wait awhile before you get seated, but its well worth the wait. How come all the good authentic Japanese restaurants are always tiny? The soup broth was amazing. I feel like I'm at a restaurant in Japan when I sat at the counter waiting for my ramen. I have tried the Daikokuya in Monterey Park and that place was not as good as this Little Tokyo location. Its a must try if you're look for some good Japanese comfort food in LA

The Daikoku ramen is delicious, full of flavor (especially if you add the kotteri flavor) and very filling.  If you like yours spicy, ask for hot chili oil and chili powder to kick it up a notch.  The gyoza are small but tasty and the perfect size if you're eating the big bowl of ramen.  I tried a combo once with the ramen+salad+a small teriyaki eel bowl and it was really good but waaay too much food.  I really like that it's open late, too.  The only real downside to this place is that there is pretty much always a long line.  That's why I usually try to go at an off peak time or go to the one in Monterey Park. If only they had the tsukemono like this on does, though.

i dare any other ramen snob to find a single fault. perfect. as is the atmosphere. go early. go alone. sit @the bar facing the opaque grease and steam coated "window", which you will only be aware of until your ramen arrives..@which point your eyes lower and lock-on to the bowl...where, unless you're a tasteless a**hole, they will generally remain until the bowl is empty. going alone eliminates the need for unwanted conversational obligations and will generally get you in the door 10-15min faster. no need to drive all the way to torrance. the downside is that far too many la 'hipsters' choose this place for an inexpensive night-on-the-town, and sit there nibbling their ramen and chit-chatting for an hour....hence the long wait-time. my single suggestion would be to implement a highly enforced 30min maximum dining time. "here is your check. please leave now".

This place never fails.  Ramen combo with fried rice or eel bowl.  Dumplings appetizer is a must.  I came with 2 friends that only heard but never tried and now they are fans.  There's usually a line but it moves pretty quick.  We waited about 15 minutes when there was 5 ahead of us. The soup is a bit salty but thats Ramen.  Enjoy.

I am literally in love with this place. When I first went here a few years back, I literally had no idea what I was in for. I had no knowledge of types of ramen and I've never even heard of hakata-style ramen, but I was intrigued with how they literally simmer pork bones for broth for hours and hours. They also use kurobuta (black pork) which I've never heard before. I thought pork was just pork. So I tried their ramen and their chashu was so tender and fatty in the right way. Their ramen is amazing but sometimes I go their for their pork bowl. Same type of pork, but bbq'd. The first time I took a bite I was extremely amazed. the meat literally melted in my mouth and the flavors melding together. The best place if you want to satiate your appetite for pork. Not recommended for Muslims, dieters or vegetarians. Seriously, what kind of vegetarian would go to a ramen joint? Especially one that specializes in one type of pork?

Long wait which was a good sign.  Try the pork belly bowl.  Scrumptious and we tried the fried spicy tuna roll which was tasty.  The ramen was good.  We like the daikaku ramen and kichimen which was good but salty and had a nice sour spicy taste.  My wife thought it was too Korean tasting.  Portions were big similar to the Sawtelle noodle places.  Atchi Katchi on Vine is also good but also serves soba unlike here.  Service was good.  Also dress for heat.

Daikoku Ramen is made with very fresh and pure broth (you can taste the pure yet robust flavor, and you can taste the absence of MSG and artificial flavors most other places practice using). Best ramen broth in the area - full bodied flavor that adds to the ramen. The ramen noodles are typical ramen noodles, nothing too special. The takoyaki here is the best takoyaki around (presented beautifully, and full of tako, less on the flour).

This is probably the best ramen outside of Japan. As foodies, our family searched for the best of ramen when we were in Japan last summer so we are a big fan of this place.  Today , we finally ate at Little Tokyo and would you believer that even at 4:30 in the afternoon we still have to wait for 45 minutes! So we walked across the street and brought some Mochi and Ramune soda for my boys . Afterward we went for more shopping and brought some more cream puffs at the bakery and shopped at the Japanese grocery store . It was so much fun and remind us so much of our fabulous trip in Japan.

This is a great place to get Tokyo style ramen. My dad used to take me when he worked next door at the Japanese American museum, and I used to be all about the chauhan (fried rice). They obviously have great ramen, that is why the place is always packed, but who doesn't love all the Japanese cartoon masks. It feels like a Japanese vintage store almost, with the Japanese surfboard, old movie posters, and ancient advertisements. A long time ago when it didn't always take half an hour to get a seat, I was casually waiting with some ladies, and I was leaning on the table where a television rested upon, and BOOM! down goes table, down goes table! Yeah, broke the television too, but hey, whatever, not my fault. Anyways they are open pretty late I think, so it is always a great choice in Little Tokyo or Downtown.

I'm surprised that I didn't write a review for this place.  This review is several years old.  What is unique about this place is the black pork they use (kubota pork) for their stock.    The black pork gives a much more.... piggy taste to the ramen.   Highly recommended.

absolutely LOVE this place and the food!!! ive been here a few times (a few pretty late at night, and while coming home for a few days). the only part i hate about this place is the wait. but once you get sat and get some food on the table, its all worth it. you cant find ramen like this out in vegas, thats for sure!!! after being in vegas for a year, there was one spot (monta) that serves a pretty good ramen, but definitely not like daikokuya. thanks to my sisters recommendation, i alwayts order my ramen with koteri. the portions here are HUGE, but i always end up ordering a combo with the chicken and egg bowl, and an extra order of pork belly. i literally sit at home in vegas and think about driving out to cali just for places like this. * during the wait, we normally go across the street for yummy tajoyaki. and after, if its still open, yogurtland is the perfect dessert after ramen, if you have the room for it (then again, theres always room for dessert!).

my man and i have the fortune of living downtown and only 1 mile from Daikokuya!  i've already said before that the ramen is the main reason why people go to this place and after you try it, you'll know why.  we are no exception, which makes it so hard to try their other items on the menu.   this past weekend we took a leap and my boyfriend sacraficed his usual ramen for the bento box with tempura and teriyaki chicken and i ordered a new appetizer, the fried spicy tuna.  the verdict.... TRY THEIR OTHER MENU ITEMS!!!! they are just as genius with Japanese food other than ramen!  the tempura is clean and crisp, the chicken teriyaki isn't too sweet or sticky (which many teriyakis in the U.S. tend to be), the sauce is just the perfect balance between savory and sweet and the chicken, the chicken!  they use dark meat and keep it juicy while the skin is sooo crispy (almost like the kind of crisp u expect from a peking duck)!  oh and the best part, a two item bento box is only $10.95 and it comes with rice, miso soup, and a small salad.  can u say bargain!?!? almost forgot about the fried spicy tuna appetizer...how could i?  it was great!  let me first declare that i'm a sucker for good fried food, its one of my weaknesses (shhhh).  so this dish spoke to me, they wrapped little dumpling size amounts of minced spicy tuna with shiso leaves and deep fry them in tempura batter.  YUM!  a little spicy with the tender and meaty tuna that slightly cooks and is warmed thru with the frying plus the sharp distinct almost licorice flavor of the shiso leaf and the CRUNCH of the fried tempura batter....mmmmmmm.... the only down side of Daikokuya, is the wait....unfortunately this review will probably add to the lines...but i can't help it, i like to share ;-)

Definitely five stars. Even without any real frame of reference my taste buds tell me that I will not find another ramen joint better than this one. This place consistently delivers each time I go. Everything on the menu is great and prepared really well, even if the cooks in the back look like they're on parole. I usually order the combo set which comes with a bowl of crisp lettuce and onion salad (ask for the dressing on the side cause they drench it), a bowl of sushi rice with salmon egg on top, and a regular bowl of their other-worldly noodles. The broth is thick and delicious, noodles are cooked slightly past al-dente, and the pork just melts in your mouth. Even the green onions taste like they were cut seconds ago. Can't say enough good things about it.

The million dollar question concerning this place is: Is it worth waiting in line for the inevitable hour to eat this ramen?  Apparently, yes.  I don't eat pork, so I didn't try it, but my friends were super happy and slurped the precious bowl down like it smacked of the Fountain of Life.  I had the spicy tuna situation which was quite nice.  I suppose it has to be, being in J-Town.  If you like ramen, this place is supposed to be the shiznits, with their secret soup prepared in a secret location and all that.

I've been on a ramen kick ever since I got pregnant back in January of 2010.  It seems that I am constantly smelling and craving ramen at random times of the day.  There would be times I'm at the office and I catch a whiff or something and it would remind of ramen.  Is that weird?  Well, weird or not weird, I am now on a journey to taste all the fine ramen the world has to offer.  The ramen at Daikokuya is delicious.  The broth it comes with is full of flavor and just the right amount of salt.  The noodles have their own personality with their curls and flavor.  The pork is just wonderful.  At first glance, I always think that I wouldn't be able to finish my own bowl but 10 minutes later, I find myself swirling my spoon searching for more ramen.  Sure the wait is long and space is tight, but people, isn't the anticipation worth it for such delights?

Daikokuya is pretty good.  The portions are huge and I can hardly ever finish a whole daikokuya ramen unless I'm super hungry.  I always get the sliced pork on the side, too, because I like to eat it with the ramen.  Definitely not the best ramen I've ever tasted, but it's decent for the price.  And I think it's definitely a place I feel everyone should try at least once. Parking in Little Tokyo in general just sucks, it's always a hit or miss.  The line for Daikokuya is always pretty long, too, if you go during peak hours and you have to wait a minimum of 30 minutes because the place is tiny.  I always feel greasy and oily after I come out of here because it's so small, cramped, stuffy and oily from the kitchen.

I love the noodles.  The broth is ok.  Chashu was whatever.  The egg was annoying, how difficult is it to slice in half?  You chomp into an apple, you don't chomp into a boiled egg.  The menma tastes old school, not my favorite.  The gyoza was covered in a mountain of green onions, even though there are some inside already.  Didn't really see the point. The service was bad.  Considering how busy and small this place is, it's totally unacceptable.  The two people at midnight at Suehiro's do just fine with a way bigger space compared to the 3 people working the room at Daikokuya (woefully they do not understand the meaning of hustle). 1.  Why have customers write their name down on a list and then when you're ready to seat someone you call out a number?  Like anyone remembers what number they were.  Either call out their name or get one of those number dispenser thingeys like they have at a deli counter. 2.  Don't get riled up if customers want to sit at the table before you cleared it off.  We weren't trying to sit down after you told us we couldn't yet, we were trying to get out of the way of people coming in and out of that narrow passage. 3.  It's busy and you want to increase turnover, hence no one should have to ask for a check.  You should be getting that to the table as quick possible without seeming rude as a subtle hint to GET OUT.  We actually had to ask for the check and then it took forever to get it and get it processed.  I felt bad for the people waiting. 4.  When you're cleaning the table, you should already place the menus on the table, you already know how many people are going to be sitting there.  We had to wait to get our menus. 5.  When someone is leaving, wait till they get out the door before seating anyone else.  You have a very narrow entrance area.  There was alot of awkward, can't fit, excuse me, sorry let me step back action going on.   It's like they do EVERY SINGLE THING possible to slow down the process.  It's a ramen place, one should get in and get out quickly, no lingering over 5 courses or batting eyelashes at your date. Not worth the wait when there are so many other restaurants in the near vicinity.

I have to admit, despite my humble opinion that the taste of the ramen broth has decreased somewhat (though very slightly) in the past couple of years, I still *crave* this place and often make the long drive to Little Tokyo to fill my soul with hot pork goodness, rich noodles, crisp green onions -- and a tonkatsu to snack on at 1am.  The pork is melt-in-your-mouth tender.  I usually go with the ramen - tonkatsu combo but I've also enjoyed their tempura and *love* the salad.  Minus one star for the long wait and the two times where I've been mysteriously seated after people who signed the wait-list after me.  Mmm, perhaps a trip to 1st Street is in order.

better to come in a small group or you'll be waiting awhile (singletons have it easy) better bring something cold to drink while you wait since it feels like a 100 deg inside after sampling santouka, santa, katana ya, etc. the broth here does stand out -- very rich pork flavor since it's shoyu tonkatsu and the pork slices are huge and tasty (large fat stripe) also onion, sprouts, and bamboo (glad they don't have the canned flavor) it was worth the wait!

I reminisce about those wonderful chilly nights that I would stand outside shivering, waiting for a table. I didn't care, the wait was always worth it.

Perfect place on rainy Sunday afternoon. It was super crowded and most people seemed to wait 10-15 minutes. Luckily, I was flying solo having just gone to the Japanese American National Museum. So, I got a spot at the counter immediately. Lucky me! The DAIKOKU RAMEN are delicious. Also, the sliced pork appetizer is scrumptious. The Ramen soup is massive, and I could barely get through half of it. The broth is delicious and 'creamy' with the perfect amount of salt. The ramen noodles are al dente and the boiled egg and slices of pork are cooked perfectly. If you don't mind waiting and a bit of a hectic crowded atmosphere, then don't miss checking this place out if you're in Little Tokyo in LA.

so EVERYONE talks about daikokuya when i start askin ppl where to go for a nice ramen. and since EVERYONE told me that it was the BEST ramen in LA, i was so hyped up about it...... maybe its because ppl have said such good things that i had too high of an expectation for this place, but this place was so NOT good. actually, it was pretty bad. the wait was looooong (which was expected), the service was REALLY bad (just because you smile, doesn't mean your service is good), and the ramen itself....it was HORRIBLE. i can't believe i payed for sucha ramen. if you served that kind of ramen in japan, i think anyone would get mad and leave without paying. It was mainly because of the chewy goey noodles. come on, ramen noodels are not supposed to be so chewy. its supposed to have a lil of a raw-ness in the center of the noodle. i'm sorry everyone...but i think orochon has better ramen.

This is my favorite ramen place in LA.  I've been to Japan, and no the ramen isn't the same, but it's still very good in my opinion.  I can tell that they take pride in their tonkotsu soup, chasu, and marinated egg.  I've yet to find better ramen in the LA area and that includes Torrance.  The atmosphere sorta feels like the hole-in-the wall ramen joints you'll find in Japan, maybe a bit too contrived with the metal sign decorations and all, but I go there for the food.

I was in LA for less than 4 days, went here for lunch for 2 of them. I have never been to Japan, but am told this was the best ramen you can get in the US. The bento box was good as well.

One of my stops during my LA trip was to a local favorite for Ramen, called "Daikokuya". The wait was a bit long, but no problem for a true food lover.  The atmosphere was fun and packed with people.  Recommend to sit at the bar if you want to feel the vibe of this place.  The quality of their noodles was outstanding, and the taste of their Ramen did not disappoint.  Their gyoza was also very good.  Can't wait to compare against another highly-rated LA Ramen competitor during a future trip.

everything we ordered was delicious!  (we had the chow mein, the gyoza, and the shredded pork bowl combo which includes salad and a full sized bowl of ramen).  i am currently sitting with a giant rounded belly.  it hurts, seriously.   while the food is delicious, we waited an hour, which we would not do again.  it's definitely not worth that long of a wait. the noodles in both the chow mein and the ramen... this is my first time eating ramen that doesn't come from a grocery store, so i guess i was expecting something "more."  the noodles were basically the kind you get in the instant packages.  which is fine.  i love those noodles.   the broth in the ramen was grrrreat!  creamy, salty, rich in flavor.  BUT, the aftermath is too much.  it felt like during the drive home my tongue was shriveling due to dehydration.  i don't understand how so many people drink ALL of the broth!  there were empty bowls everywhere around us!  i had a few spoonfuls and i'm thirsty as all get-out.   the shredded pork bowl has no draw backs.  delicious!!   servers were nice, fast.  wish we had sat at a booth.  sitting at the counter was kind of uncomfortable.  it's really hot in the restaurant, so dress in layers so you can strip down to eat!

I like the murky broth and the melt-in-your-mouth cha su. I even liked the soft-boiled egg more than I like tea eggs, and that says a lot since I can eat tea eggs for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The noodles are wavy and texture-wise, Shin Sen Gumi has the upper hand. However, for all the other ingredients, I had a better overall experience with the heartier ramen at Daikokuya.

i have to say this is probably one of the best ramen places i've ever eaten at. i havn't gone back again so it might've just been a really good day for them but i'm willing to give it another try. i'm usually not a fan of crowded restaurants so when my friend took me there i was sort of disappointed because i was HUNGRY and they said there was a 45 minute wait. not wanting to be a party pooper i waited it out but it was definately worth it. i ordered to salt ramen and tuna bowl combo and requested my noodles to be extra firm. when they came out, the noodles were nice and springy, just the way i like it. the soup was also very heavy and delicious. this place would've gotten 5-stars however i really hated the wait. i wish they could move out to a bigger store or something but then again why change a formula that works. looking back i'm kinda wondering if it was the 45 minute wait that made it taste soooo good because i tried their other place in costa mesa and it was a pretty crappy experience

heard about this place from several people and of course after searching for a ramen place on yelp.  i finally got a chance to try it out after a dodger game and i was so glad i decided not to eat at dodger stadium.  i saved it up for some of the best ramen i've ever had.  i had the ramen specialty dish that they're famous for and good god... broth... good... noodles... good... pork... GOOOOOOOOD!  hehe.   people complain about the lines and the wait.  of course that sux but once you eat here you know why there are lines and you gotta wait.  good things come to those that wait... and most likely you will have to wait when you want to eat here.  even on a weekday at 11pm!

This place reminds me of a 1950's diner set on Japan!  The food is good, but I didn't think it was all that great.  Everything here is pork based (about 90% of the menu), and Ramen seems to be the hot item here. It's definitely worth trying out.  It gets crowded, so plan to wait!

Granted I've only had one item here - the signature Daikoku ramen. But this alone earns this place 5 stars. Quick friendly service and amazing ramen. Best I've had in LA. Just expect a bit of a wait if you go during peak hours. Try to go in groups of 1 or 2 for quicker seating.

We came here on a Saturday around 1 and we were starving.  BAD IDEA! The waiting list was pretty long but I heard so much about this place and we came from Santa Monica so we decided to wait.   After an hour I was about to pass out from starvation but after investing an hour of wait the was no turning back.  We finally got seated at the bar and ordered the Daikokuya combo before we were even seated.  The broth was was pretty good and the pork was better but it wasnt as good as everyone says.  I found it a bit on the salty side but the ramen was cooked well.  I highly recommend Santouka Ramen instead.

The ramen here is second to none around here. I have yet to find a better ramen place in Los Angeles. Their broth is thick and full of flavor... thinking about it makes me want to come here despite the long lines they have it. Another plus for this place is that they open relatively late. One bad thing is that during the summer, they don't have A/C. If you are eating at the bar right in front of the kitchen... it's like eating in front of an inferno. This place is not big... so bringing a group more than 4 is not recommended

My favorite Ramen joint in the world (out of Tokyo).  This place specializes in guess in what? yes that savory soup named Ramen.  The experts say that the secret of a great soup is mainly on the broth, and this is the speciality in this place, the broth OH MY!! is so tasty, they can even make it better by adding pork belly fat.  The classic version comes with marinated egg that honestly makes the difference.  This restaurant is packed with Asian people, not just Japanese, also a lot of chinese people, they dont take reservations, so be prepared to wait almost an hour.

I thought the ramen here was pretty good compared to most places, but I didn't think it was SUPER great that will make me want to come here more often. Always too long of a wait, unless you go a little bit after lunch hours.  I really like the combos, I've tried their Daikokuya with eel and pork strips.  They all very tasty. Definitely a place for ramen!

WOWZERS! What an AMAZING place! Totally not pretentious-even though there is always a line of eager eaters. When we arrived, we got there just before the wave of hunger people arrived. We placed our name on a list and already the place was packed and we were third in line. There is this yellowish curtain in front of the door -it's a little dirty, but don't let that dissuade you. Our waiter was this super nice guy who was just loving the on-coming wave of Daikokuya fans. He must make bank! Anyhow, it was my first time here so I ordered the Daikokuya ramen-it was so, so, very yum! A huge bowl of savory broth (the kind you can taste because it's been cooking all day!) served with lotus plant, sprouts, a hard boiled egg, ample green onion, and of course the stars of the show: wonderful ramen that was cooked to perfection! My friend had the cold noodles, which he loved. We also ordered a pitcher of beer (I forget the name of it, but it's a recognizable Japanese draft). My soup was $8.50 without tip or tax, his order was the same price, and the pitcher (which was large) was a very low $11. Seriously inexpensive, GOOOOOD tasting food made with love and served in a culturally rich Little Tokyo. I love me some Daikokuya Ramen. :)

Springy egg noodles in a rich both with tender pork and scallions is delicious.

OK - just to clear the air - I gave this place a 4 star instead of a 5 star because of the wait.I probably would have been more generous if my phone battery didn't die and i could have at least played a little bejeweled or babo crash. BUT the wait was so long that my cousin and i went down the street and explored the museum - came back - there were still 7 parties ahead of us. ugh! and this was on an odd time - a tuesday evening at 5:30. We were seated at 8PM.  YES I AM TELLING THE TRUTH! That was out of control. BUT even with the messed up wait time - they still get 4 stars. We had gyoza, I had the wonderful ramen, my cousin had the shredded pork bowl. It was all GREAT AND WONDERFUL AND DELICIOUS! The waiters were equally great and wonderful. We were able to watch the cooks make the ramen and the waiters were so warm and friendly and nice - it made the negatives disappear. YES, I will go back. YES, i will wait 2 or 3 hours. Next time, however - i will put my name in, make sure I bring my fully charged I-pad - then walk down to the Far East bar - play mahjong or bejeweled or something on the ipad with a friend - knock back a few beers - then go back in the line. That would make it much better =)

This is the best ramen I've ever eaten!  I took the first bite and the flavor just hit me, I was so surprised at how good it was, and my expectations were high. It's rich, flavorful, it has this milky/creamy consistency. I went on a Sunday around 11:30 a.m. and the wait wasn't too bad, maybe about 20 minutes (but it was only the two of us).  Get their Daikokuya ramen bowl, it's so worth it.  I'm coming back here again and again.

This is best the location among all Daikokuya locations. The ramen here is good but not worth the long wait. I ordered the kotteri ramen, and the fat is supposed to enhance the flavor, but I found it to be just okay. The noodles are a bit too soft for my preference. I think of Daikokuya as a decent place for ramen and probably the best ramen place in Little Tokyo, but I would only go back if I happen to be in the area (wouldn't head out there just for the ramen).

I live on the Westside and work in the South Bay and had yet to make it downtown to face the hustle and bustle of this tiny noodle shop. Thank god for jury duty! I walked down here a few times while contemplating witness testimony and physical evidence. Noodles have the perfect texture with just the right "give" when you chew. The broth is a milky magnificence. The pork and soy-steamed egg, sublime. A little heavy on the green onion but that shouldn't sway neither judge nor juror. Wash it all down with some iced green tea. The verdict: delicious!

The broth tasted great and didn't take long to come out.  There was no wait when we went during lunch time so we got lucky.  The portion was large, but I think I like Shin-Sen-Gumi  broth better.  The broth here was nice and light, but Shin-Sen-Gumi was richer tasting.  Still give it 4 stars.  It was cheap, tasted good, and was fast.

I'm salivating as we speak.  I'm just picturing my first slurp of the soup and I'm tempted to drive down to J-town to surpress my obsession.  The ramen here is sooo darn good!  Kenneth knew my love for soup noodles so he took me here after viewing the 400+ reviews of this tiny restaurant.  Sure, we had to wait for a table  but it was well worth it.  We sat right in front of the wok which was steaming hot.  As I look over the menu, I fell in love.  The daikoku ramen was exactly what I love in my bowl of noodles.  First off, there was a marinated boiled egg, a few slices of pork belly, bean sprouts, green onions and my all time favorite...BAMBOO SHOOTS!  I also added the kotteri flavor which increases the flavor of the soup.  I was not disappointed.  The soup, the noodles...just EVERYTHING was beyond my expectations.  We also ordered gyoza to top things off and that was yummy as well.  I love all the green onions that was placed on top of the gyoza.  It gave a great kick to the whole dish.   There is one thing that I need to complain about.  There was no air conditioning.  I was sitting right next to the kitchen and I'm eating a hot bowl of soup noodles and the A/C was nonexistent.  I never sweat but this time, I was sweating like I just finished the L.A. Marathon.  Nonetheless, I will return to this restaurant and munch on MY bowl of noodles.

This place has the best ramen. Granted I havn't had the authentic deal (from Japan), I can only compare it to Chinese-influenced ramen (ie Shin-Sen-Gumi in San Gabriel Valley which definitely loses in this round), but still. The noodles are really chewy and the soup/broth flavorful. They are kinda stingy on the pork, but it's got enough fat to make up for it (fat = flavor in this case). I also like the egg. It's not totally hard-boiled, but it's not runny either. I'd love to come here when winter rolls around to see if the experience is better. We also got the tuna sashimi bowl, which in my opinion was not worth the 10 bucks (even though it *was* tuna sashimi) - it was basically just sashimi + rice. It was good to try since I see it all the time on the Jap soaps, but I wouldn't get it again. PS: I came here just a little bit after 5 on a Wed night, thus beating the dinner rush. It started at around 520pm. PPS: Street parking can be a b*tch. Just make sure you read the signs carefully as parking is not allowed in some areas at certain times for who knows what reason. My friend got her car towed within 20 minutes.

Chicken teri bowl or teriyaki eel bowls are also good for if you need leftovers for dinner/the next day.  Don't walk three shops down because when you miss them call your name, the hostess will not recognize you if you return and sit inside to wait uselessly.  I usually don't like pork but the boiled egg and noodles are so good!  I always give the chashu away then fill up on bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, and green onions.  We liked it so much, my boyfriend and I were too busy eating to talk.

I hate to say it, but I found this place a little overrated.  The ramen was good, but it wasn't the best I've ever had.  I also found the restaurant to have poor air circulation which is important when eating a hot bowl of ramen.  Everyone raves about their fried rice, but I thought it was good but not the best ever.  Overall, I might come back here but only if my favorite J-Town restaurants were too packed.

Daikokuya is hands down one of the best ramen shops in L.A.  The broth is rich and has the right amount of saltiness, the noodles are chewy and not too soft, and the fatty kurobuta pork literally melts in your mouth.  The size of the ramen is fairly large, and all but those with the largest of appetites won't need anything else.  If I'm super hungry, I'll get the combination with the oyakodon, but then I'll invariably end up full beyond belief and have those mixed feelings of slight regret and total satiation that you get from overeating.  The wait time can be long, but if you can read Japanese, you can amuse yourself with some of the manga in the front, or you could watch the small TV they have in the front.  Along with Santouka, this is is one of my favorite ramen places in the region.

While in Downtown LA with my boyfriend, I realized that I had made a huge mistake and that the Art Walk was the next day. Fail. We started to just wander aimlessly and soon entered Little Tokyo. We were pretty hungry and when he looked across the street he remembered that his friend has recommended this place. We called to make sure then made our way in. The hostess was really nice and the place was super busy. We waited about 5 minutes for a table because luckily we missed the rush. Being that it was our first time there we ordered wayy too much. We ordered spicy tuna rolls, tempura and the combo thing. It comes with a salad, a side of your choice and the ramen. First the salad came and it was pretty delicious and then the sushi and tempura came. then my tub of ramen came. No seriously. My TUB. It was HUGE. I looked at him and said "WHY IS IT SO BIG?" I knew he was probably thinking "That's what she said" but he just said "I thought you knew". I ate my Ramen tub but I didn't finish my Shredded Beef Bowl (my side dish), so I took that home and it was super good too. Overall I was really satisfied. We paid a decent price for a really good meal, and all the servers were very nice. Needless to say, I'll be back. :)

I was never super bowled over by the ramen here. Everything about it was good *except* for the noodles! Pork was tender, eggs were golden, scallions were fresh, broth was savory, but the noodles just tasted off. They were too strong, too something, too jeri curl-looking. But then one day I turned the page PAST the ramen, to the Shredded Pork Bowl and was hit by magic. This I would happily wait 45 minutes in line for. A huge bowl of charred pork and scallions, soaking into a bottomless pit of sticky rice. *faints*

There's not much more I can say about this place that hasn't already said.  The portions are ginormous, but if you're eyes are bigger than your stomach (like me) they also have combos.  I tried to do a combo the other day and felt silly thinking I could eat all that food.  The salad that comes w/ the combo is literally just cabbage, but there's something about their dressing that is SO gooooooddd.  Oh man, writing about this has got me feening for it again like the ramen whore that I am.  Must....go...back....

I first noticed Daikokuya after driving by numerous times and seeing the line outside.  I finally made my way to Little Tokyo this past weekend to try it out. I had the combo (ramen + terriyaki chicken).  The ramen was good, but not the best I've ever had.  The broth tasted a little watered down compared to other ramen I've tried. After I added some garlic & chili powder, it tasted a little bit more to my liking.  The bowl is huge, but they only gave a couple thin slices of pork.  Like I said, it was good, but just didn't have the "wow" factor. Especially after waiting in line for 30+mins. Their gyoza is really good and I recommend ordering it as a starter.

The ramen here is good, but they don't have the best part anymore ... years ago I came and the egg they gave with each bowl of noodles still had a holden, semi-runny yolk and it was absolutely amazing. I thought about  it for like, three years, and then went back ... to a solidly cooked yolk. I've read they stopped undercooking the egg due to health complaints? Please ... it was the best part! But I love how they give you lots of green onions - I always have to ask for more at Shinsengumi.

Par for the course, a tongue-searing layer of oil traps heat in the bowl, and yet, Daikokuya distinguishes itself by burning that lard to create a punchy kogashi flavor. The oil is then scooped back out, leaving behind a surprisingly sappari shoyu tonkotsu soup rife with wafu dashi fish underpinnings and a burnt flavor that permeates the entire bowl. One might think the chef had fallen asleep at the stove, if only it didn't taste so sublime and so absolutely truthful - strong and deep, rich yet light like a Zen paradox, everything all at once. Noodles thick, partially risen, reduced kansui noodles are great in context. even if you're not a fan of the noodles in the asahikawa mode, i don't think it's possible to divorce the strands from the soup. it's all about how it works together, don't you think? gyoza one of the best! great place can't wait for the new location Hacienda Heights

I'm a bit of a ramen snob so I've tried alot of different ramen places in California...personally I feel like Daikokuya is the 2nd best ramen restaurant I've eaten at outside of Asia (Santa Ramen in Northern California is still the best)...The key to a good bowl of ramen is the broth and I absolutely love the broth here because it is thick, rich and saturated with pork flavor, you can definitely tell that they spent at least a day making it...the noodles and cha su meat are just okay, but the soup makes up for it...I really like the hard boiled egg that comes with your noodles because the yolk is still runny...If you are still hungry after downing a huge bowl of ramen here, I highly recommend the shredded pork bowl, which is grilled kurobata pork belly served over rice...The pork is extremely tender and flavorful and goes well with the ramen...

after reading all the raving reviews, i had to come with some friends mneeeeehhhhhhhhhh the wait is not worth the food// the ramen is however pretty good. but i also bought the same type of ramen from the japanese grocery store in the plaza for like 1/3 the price and they tasted almost similar... service is good, nice and friendly servers honestly, I don't get why this place is so popular.

so i finally FINALLY got to try this place out. having already been to orochon i was excited to try this place because a) everyone raves about this place b) yelpers love this place c) i love japanese ramen. sadly, i wasn't that hungry when i came, but hungry enough to eat. i have to say it looks like a pretty authentic japanese place. anyway i got a seat at the bar and saw how they put everything together. i ordered the original ramen and my first spoonful of the soup was good, very flavorful, but a little salty. i loved that there LOTSA LOTSA green onions :) the boiled egg was pretty good. the pork was soooo soft and tender. the noodles were al dente and i loved that they were still a little firm, and chewy. i know they pride themselves on their broth  because they boil it for a whole day--it pretty much makes the ramen. only bad thing is that it's a little salty. i was really thirsty after. conclusion: very different from orochon ramen. i like both. but i'm in the mood for miso ramen, i would go to orochon. plus, their noodles are thicker and extra chewy YUM :D

I wasn't even hungry the day I ate here but my friend recommended it so highly that I decided to try it. Before it was all about Shin-sen-gumi, but after I had their fatty broth ramen I had to change my pants. Brave the lines for this one - you'll feel the cosmos, Katamari style.

I've been to Daikokuya countless times. I guess having been living right around the corner helped too. I almost always order the ramen and sometimes the cold ramen in the summer, but the other food items on their menu are also very yummy. For all these years I've been going to Daikokuya, I noticed that the quality of their ramen isn't always consistent...sometimes the soup was a little too salty and sometimes the egg was over-cooked. However, I'm still a huge fan and think their ramen overall is the best ever.

Despite the over 1 hour wait for this place last Sunday night,,,I can't help but give this place high praise...the Ramen is spectacular and as long as you are prepared to wait for it your patience will be rewarded.  I've gone to Daikokuya several times over the years so the long lines are never a surprise...its a testament to the quality of the broth they make.  This time around also had their chashu appetizer and their spicy tuna roll, good and good!!  Will keep coming back for the wait again and again.  :-)

Checked out the place today.  we got there before noon and there was a line waiting outside.  by the time the waitress was going to seat us (2 adults, 1 toddler), the only seating left were at the 'bar' area.  the waitress kindly asked two young men at a booth if they'd mind moving to the bar.  the stupid ass college kid said no, he wanted his elbow room.  what a douche.  anyway, a group of 3 at an adjacent booth gave up their seats for us.   yah!  we made the first round cut.   Anyway, the ramen is good, but I don't think it's a place I'd wait 1/2 an hour for if I didn't make the cut.  the fried rice was pretty good as well.

Asa Ramen in gardena is better.

Yummy yummy ramen!!! The wait is ridiculously long, but once you're seated and food is ordered, it comes out almost immediately. The portions are the perfect size, but just a little too big for lunch.  Mmm.. The broth was amazing! Not too salty and definitely flavorful. I would love to go again!

Put my name down for 5 people at 7pm on a Sunday night, came back an hour later, my name was called already but they still gave us our table. They had us all share a regular sized booth so it was a bit crowded. We all ordered the ramen. I like the egg, pork, and noodles though the broth was too rich for me.

Dining Date: 1/24/10 The wait is roughly an hour for a booth but it's been a long time since I've had their ramen.  I don't like the ramen from the other nearby restaurants as much.  I order the ramen & fried rice combo ($11.50). I always order a side of fried rice even if I can't finish it.  Then I can take it home and eat it the next day.  It's a little greasy this time but I am still able to enjoy it.  I like all the ingredients in this dish: onions, green onions, egg, corn, chopped kurobuta pork stir-fried with rice served with red pickled radish on the side, love that stuff. The soup stock is simmered overnight with pork bones and joints off-site.  Their famous tonkotsu soup base is so concentrated, it will congeal if you refrigerate the broth.  They serve it steaming hot with chijire style egg noodles, slices of kurobuta pork belly chasu, marinated boiled egg, bamboo shoots, bean spouts, green onions and sprinkle of sesame seeds. The first thing I polish off is the kurobuta pork belly chasu.  I try to savor it and make it stretch through the meal but it's so tender, it practically melts into the soup.  I practice slurping.  You have to try it to get the full effect.  As you slurp, you also suck up air which cools off the broth a bit.  This allows you to eat ramen at a hotter temperature than other foods that you have to blow on the surface of the spoon which doesn't give you as much surface area.  Plus the back of your mouth can handle a hotter temperature, so it aids in not burning your tongue if your slurp has enough suction.  The steaming tonkotsu broth facial is part of the experience.  Slurping also gives you a very specific broth to noodle ratio as you inhale your food.  The taste changes when you try to eat the noodles and politely sip the soup spoon.  You end up chewing the noodles and swallowing the broth separately.

Yum!! I always get extra back fat and some sort of combo that includes even more pork. The worst part about this place is having to wait outside while smelling all the pork ramen goodness teasing your very soul. The kitchen is very fast pace and it's a wonder how much the chefs can get done in such a small area. Once you get in I promise you will ravage your ramen as soon as it lands on your table. Only reason I did not give this place a full five stars is the sometimes lengthy weight.

time to finish this review (started 9 months ago, yikes!) --- if you want Ramen, this is the place! that's pretty much it!  haha, jk.  sometimes there's quite a wait in front of this place, so try to get there early or for linner (between lunch/dinner).  parking is always a bit annoying in little tokyo, good luck finding street parking!  put your name on the list & hold tight!  it's totally worth it. i always get the ramen combo with fried rice. DeliiiSsh!  the ramen is a savory pork broth, noodles just right, topped with green onions & ginger (i opt out).  the fried rice is a must!  the gyoza's always a nice little treat.  Enjoy~

I think the Tsukemen tasted so good when I first ate it because I was starving by the time I got a seat inside the restaurant. I think it is the better option for those hot summer days than a hot bowl of Ramen. Love the noisy but cozy atmosphere of the restaurant. Recalling back that bowl of ramen was good, but not spectacular, and definitely loaded with too much MSG.

My favorite place to get ramen. I always get the ramen combination with extra pork soup flavor and shredded pork bowl. The salad they serve you with the combo is so good. Overall, it's a lot of food but the line is worth waiting. Expect a 30-60 minute (or longer) wait for lunch or dinner.

Again, I would've neglected reviewing this place if I hadn't seen Leslie C.'s review. Oh my goodness. Not really sure if the ramen was amazing or if I was hungry so I give it 5 stars. It could be both factors. The only problem is having to wait over 1.5 hrs to get a table. Thankfully there are interesting stores around Little Tokyo to check out, but they still couldn't satisfy my hunger for those painful 90+ minutes!! Wow, this is what I get for not reviewing Daikokuya right after I go there--I forget what I ordered. I definitely remember it was some kind of ramen with a side dish of sashimi and rice. YUM. I couldn't finish all the noodles, but I was absolutely bloated. Thus, the portions had to have been enormous if I was ravenous and still unable to finish it..

I love this place.  The lines are sh*tty (up to an hour on most nights) - and there is no air conditioning in the summer - but oh my if tasty goodness ever came in a bowl it comes in one here.  The Cabbage Salad and Gyoza are equally good.  I've had the Chicken Teriyaki and the Eel Bowl - but it's the Raman you should come here for and return again and again.  Couple of secrets for dealing with the long wait times - try to come when it is raining - almost never a line or mix it in with something else - i.e.  I often run in put my name down for a table then head over to Ralph's on 9th and do my food shopping - come back about an hour later and there's my table - just waiting for me...  I love this place (I said that already but it bares hearing me say it again).

I don't care what the haters say, I love Daikokuya. Daikokuya wins over Ajisen, Santouka, and any other ramen places I've tried. I appreciate that they only have one type of ramen, and they make it nomalicious. Dirt cheap for what you're getting too (~$9 for ramen, and ~$11 to $13 for ramen + rice bowl combo which is what I usually get). The ramen + rice bowl combo gives enough food to fill up any hungry belly. Yes the wait can be long, and I have waited before, but do what I do and get there before 6 pm on a weekday and you'll usually get seated right away.

Easily the best ramen in the history of the world.  this isn't your grade school cup-o-noodle experience. First the ramen, I have never experienced authentic ramen.  The broth is an elixir from heaven.  It is milky in appearance and comes with pork belly, green onions, bean sprouts and perfectly hard boiled egg.  I add garlic and pepper flakes and am whisked away to world of flavor wonderment. The other great things are these:  The sausages rock, made with korobuta and the gyoza are maybe the best out there! AMAZING!!! Only con:  Expect a line.

What can I say about this place? It's a regular hangout for us over-studied, hungover, work-a-holic USC students. Failed the organic chemistry midterm? Broke up with your gf/bf? Bored to pieces? Can't think past the pounding headache from a god awful night at the 9-0? Off to Daikokuya with you. I mean, the wait is usually really long. Anywhere from 20-75 minutes. It's faster if you go in pairs, then you can sit at the bar. But somehow we opt to go to this place even if we have a shit ton of work to do, you just get used to it I guess. Anyway, our usual orders are the Kichimen, Daikoku-ramen combo with pork bowl. The Kichimen is my favorite, I switched from the Daikoku ramen because I like dipping my noodles and the broth is more spicy and sour. The broth is tonkotsu style, so milky with chasu that's pretty buttery as far as chasu in the US goes. The shoyu egg is pretty darn tasty, especially the yoke and they give you plenty of green onions and shoots. The noodles have a great texture and good bite, and the broth is good enough to drink almost all the way. The pork bowl is awesome - but a little too oily for me to get the large version, I like the small size you get with the ramen. The pork is soft and fatty and well sauced, and there are lots of green onions that I adore. The service is rushed but good, they're all generally friendly, and if you sit at the bar you can see them cooking behind the glass -and that's usually entertaining -- although there isn't much elbow room... Parking is a little bit of a downer -- but recently they opened up a parking structure that's $4 flat rate, and if you split that among friends, it's not so bad. Parking in LA is just bad in general, I suggest don't skimp, because more often than not, you'll end up with a $45 parking ticket. You may also need kind of a tough stomach. Not sure why, but my brother got sick from the food - they also have a B health rating -- but I've never had a problem. Anyway, like I said, when all else fails, we go to Daikokuya. At least once in a few weeks, sometimes more than once a week. I mean, compared to Japan, obviously, it's not the best, but for the circumstances, it's pretty damn good.

The food was very good, but the restaurant was small and very warm inside. Luckily we got a table by the door so we were treated to an occasional breeze. I will be back, but not in the summer.

We got here before 6pm on a Friday knowing that this tiny restaurant will get super packed later.  The broth is delicious and the ramen is good however, I think this place is over hyped.  The ramen at Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi is better because you can customize to your own liking.  Anyway, the place is good but not as good as I thought it to be.

This is probably the best ramen place that I've eaten at in Los Angeles. It was a long wait to get a table, which always seems to be the case with Daikokuya. The other restaurants serving ramen on the same block as Daikokuya hardly receive much attention. You can easily walk in and get a seat immediately. However, there's a reason why people wait. The ramen is good. They give good portions and make excellent soup broth.

My friend introduced me to this place when she realized I was obsessed with noodles. The line is horrendous. It doesn't go very quickly, despite what you might hope for. You have to come here when you're at about 25-30% hungry so when you finally get seated, you'll be ready to eat. That said, the kotteri ramen is FANTASTIC. The broth is incredible, and the noodles are cooked absolutely perfectly. And when you pair it with a small bowl of pork with delicious sauce (that reminds me of the loco moco at animal sauce), scallions, and ginger, you'll want to write an ode to that tiny bowl. It is beyond compare - it might even be my favorite thing on the menu, which is crazy because they're known for their ramen. The only good thing is that the pork bowl is just as good when you get it to go as it is when you eat it there, so I like to split a bowl of ramen with a friend and have us both get our own bowls of pork and rice. I also enjoy reading the menu and descriptions of the food - it always makes me smile.

This place was awesome! My first visit to this particular Ramen spot, but in comparing to other Ramen places in the area, this definitely has the best broth. I had the combination with the Tuna and it was a lot of food, but very tasty. Two of my friends got the broth extra fatty and that is something I will do from now on because that kicked up the flavor a few notches! GO HERE!!

Favorite Ramen place in LA. The wait here can be long and discouraging, therefore, come either right when it opens at 11am or come for late lunch, or just come put down your name and take a stroll. We waited about a hour today and we were only 2 people; we sat on the barstools on the counter. The Daikoku Ramen is a must - add a small bowl to it and make it a combination if you're hungry. I recommend either the Teriyaki Eel or the Tuna Sashimi side bowls. Both were very meaty and fresh. Skip the sushi appetizers, you can get them better made at sushi bars around the corner. The pork broth for the ramen here is legendary - now, you can also get the "kotteri" flavor, meaning they add the back fat from the pork to the broth making it extra tasty and the taste extra strong. Very delicious. Like drinking liquid pork fat in a good way of course.

Okay, to be honest, I was never really a big ramen person. After all, the only experience I had had seeing people eating ramen was from those 99 cent packs that they sell at the grocery store & you just add water. Understandably, I was not sold on the idea of going to a ramen place when my friends suggested it. But, I decided to try it! When I finally tried the Daikokya ramen on my first visit, I was sold! It is seriously delicious! I've never been able to finish a whole bowl by myself, but I certainly always try! It's a place I've definitely gone back to time & time again, and it definitely changed my views on ramen! Side Notes: Parking can be terrible. If you go after a certain time, the meters are free. Make sure you check them, because it'll let you know when the free hours are & you can save some coins! If you can't find street parking, it can be anywhere from $3 - $8. Lame! The wait can also be long. Everytime I've gone to Daikokuya, we've always had to wait at least 40 minutes. But, there are shops and such nearby that you can browse as you wait for your turn. The place itself is super tiny! Only a handful of tables and a bar-type area where you can sit. That explains the long wait. You can order smaller sizes of the ramen. It's not listed on the menu, but it's about half as big as the normal portion & costs $5.95

I'm definitely a fan.  I have to say not the best ramen I've had, cuz I'm a super sticker for fresh noodles, not the curly kind.  The broth, however, was really really really good.  I had the shredded pork bowl too, which was pretty good, but had a ton of fat (not so yummy the next day when I microwaved it and the entire bottom was stiff because the fat had hardened in my refrigerator...yuck).  However, the wait is terrible (~1 hr on a monday night for four people), the service is fine though.  The other two people seemed to like their bento enough, but honestly it didn't look nearly as appetizing as the ramen or pork bowl.  large servings also, to keep in mind.

This place is pretty amazing. We got here at around 9pm on a saturday during carmageddon. there was about a 30 minute wait for a party of 2. We got the ramen and some fried rice. We were kind of hoping they had other meat choices other than pork, but the pork was pretty tasty to be honest. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good ramen place. the only negative was that the raspberry ice tea was way too sweet.

Yeah, this is the best ramen joint in LA.  The only thing for you to remember before showing up at this place is to expect a long wait no matter what time you're there.  Although the ramen itself tastes great and not to mention a great value, the fried rice here IS the best fried rice you can find (doesn't matter if you're into Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, Thai or Japanese fried rice).  The sake at $6 is also an excellent deal if you're into an alcoholic beverage with your meal.  Highly recommended.

Impossibly long waits during peak times, this no frills joint always reminded me of a neighborhood noodle shop in NYC.  Small and quaint, the emphasis here isn't style but substance.  Put your name down on the list, cross the street and kill time at the out door shops.  The ramen special (tuna sashimi; my favorite) is second to none.

Had a chance to check out this spot on a Monday afternoon because finally there was no wait. I ordered Daikoku ramen which 99% of the patrons order. I elected the extra fatty style based on the waitress recommendation and OMG i felt as if I was drinking a bowl of lard , no joke.. Ordered the pork / veggie dumplings which were superb, how the hell did they get them sooo crunchy and also have the juices inside, its a mystery i say! So after stuffing our faces the oil in soup really hit me.. So dont get that Kotteri flavor unless you want to drink 5 glasses of wheat grass and go on a crazy detox. So be prepared for some fatty goodness, cause the meat they use in the Ramen is straight up Bacon. I would love more Ramen next time and hold the fat - ya?

WoW!  The specialty ramen here is absolutely amazing.  I don't recommend the kotteri version of the soup, it's a little too thick for me.  I have eaten here over 10 times and I always get the ramen.  I can't get anything else.  The gyoza is also extremely tasty.  In the past 5 years of working in downtown LA, I have to say Daikokuya has the best ramen I have ever ate.  This coming from a guy who has been to Japan several times.  I don't know what they put it the soup (could it be crack sprinkles) but I am addicted to the tastiness.  The only bad part is that there usually a wait, but what did you expect from the best ramen shop in LA.  Go there and find out for yourselves.

after reading the great reviews, seeing big lines, and pushed by my bf...i finally decided to go here.....OH GOD WHAT DID I DO TO DESERVE THIS FOOD!!!! we went on monday evening. waited about 2 mins to be sat down at the counter. the waitress took our order right away. my bf had the house noodle, the normal one. i had the chicken teri bowl, which came with miso soup and a salad. the miso soup was ok, ive never had it. i didnt eat the salad.  when my bowl came it looked nice. i tasted the chicken and OH GOD!! thats when i started questioning him. i only ate the steamed rice. my bf on the other hand ate all his noodles lol. his plate came with a boiled egg, sprouts, the noodle, and pork beef.  he ate everything. he specially liked the egg. we also ordered two cokes.  we paid about $20 for everything. at the end he was happy and i was hungry. if you like noodles go here. if you are picky like me stay away i guess. i might give it another try just cuz he liked it but i would have to oder something else. any suggestions? what else is good here other than the noodle?

The ramen here is pretty fantastic.  The broth is tasty and the pork is tender and flavorful (I don't normally like pork).   I would give this place a 5 but there are a couple things that could make it better....  The wait takes FOR-EV-ER... Make sure you prepare to wait awhile.  The parking around there sucks, but it is downtown, what can you do?  And finally I like my ramen spicy, you don't really get that option here.  By the way, what is with the sign in the window that says No outside food or drink... Does anyone do this???

The long wait is true so be prepared and brown bag a few tall ones to get the hunger going.  For apps we got the sausage served with a side of French's mustard. They tasted like breakfast pork links and I like those things. Point. The bed of sliced onions was a nice touch. Another point. On to the ramen. Good chashu is to ramen as a rainbow is to Los Angeles. It's a rarity but when it's there it's special and you don't want to let it go. This was probably the best chashu I've had so far in my humble life. Another point. The broth was magical too. Noodles were okaay. Like someone said already, take the noodles from Hakata and join them with the broth and chashu of Daikokuya and your mouth will orgasm. 2x.

So my brother who is pretty familiar with the restaurants in Little Tokyo suggested that I eat here for ramen. I;ve heard about htis place before, and he kinda hyped it up a bit too much for me. It WAS good nonetheless, but not as good as i thought it would be. There's always a really long wait too, which is pretty annoying sometimes. Also, there aren't many selections on the menu, but the simple ones that they do offer are all delicious.

4 stars for the restaurant experience, but if i could rate the ramen separately it would get 5 stars for sure! best ramen in LA, i find myself trying to find reasons to trek downtown to eat here.   But be prepared for a long wait (esp. if you're in a group).  What i like to do is sign up, then head across the street and checkout the plaza shops, maybe pick up some chichi dango or try the new froyo place. Parking can also blow, but if you can have someone hop out and sign up while you lurch around for parking, you'll find something before your table gets called. I'm a ramen lover (whether it be at home, on sawtelle, or in little tokyo), but i wouldn't call myself a ramen snob.  Nevertheless, until someone presents something better to me, this place holds #1 for me

Had my first visit to famed Daikokuya today for lunch. I tried to go yesterday but the line was too long, did Mr. Ramen a few doors down instead which was very good (Chicken Bamboo Ramen, add spicy & garlic, mmmmmmm). Arrived at 11:30 and still waited almost 20 minutes for a single seat, no worries though. Got seated at the bar on the end next to the container they keep all the ramen spoons in. Order was taken pretty quick and food arrived less than 5 minutes later, nice! Upon slurping my first mouthful of noodles I was expecting ramen enlightenment...but it never came. The noodles were good and the broth was very tasty but it wasn't anything mind blowing. The meat clearly had been, as they say on the menu, cooking since the day before. It was super tender but remarkably fatty, like more fat than meat. And the broth, albeit tasty, didn't jump out at me. That, combined with being constantly reached over by waitresses getting spoons, didn't make for a shining experience. I'm assuming my yankee palate can't appreciate the full scale of Daikokuya since the line was incredibly long by the time I left. There was even a girl that arrived a few minutes after me that was still waiting to be seated by the time I walked back out. Oh well, to each his own.

after reading the reviews on here and being a ramen-fiend, I knew I had to try this place.  There is a bit of a wait, but be patient because it is totally worth it.  It was crowded at the time we came there so we had to sit at bar.  I enjoyed watching the chefs do what they do. The staff was prompt, attentive and nice. Considering how busy it was, our food came pretty fast. I ordered the fried rice and ramen combo thinking the soup would come as  a smaller portion. But I received it  in a huge bowl.  The broth is extremely flavorful.  I haven't tasted ramen that good since I left LA, and I can't wait to go back.

I like ramen but before Daikokuya, I had always enjoyed Sapporo Ichiban instant ramen with egg. Well this is definitely different and more flavorful as the pork broth has been stewed for some time. Nothing much to report except that it was very good. We went for a late lunch so not that much of a wait. Generally, though, come before the time you want to eat because you'll inevitably encounter a long wait. Street parking is usually full so try the Japanese Village Mall parking around the corner. I am putting four stars because it was good and all but I really have no basis to comment further because I'm not really a fan of it. I just like my ramen with egg and kimchi at home when I am too lazy to cook anything else so take what you will from this review.

I heart Daikokuya! I'm a huge hot ramen/ noodles fan and this is my favorite place. I think it's better than Santouka Ramen at Mitsuya. There IS always a wait no matter what time of the day you come here. It's great when you come by yourself because you'll get a table faster. There's always a seat for you at the bar. But the food is so good that I don't mind the wait at all. I normally come for the ramen... and that's all I eat. The ramen is good! I love the boiled egg, the thick flavorful broth with the noodles.

Did not like the food. First time here and I ordered the ramen and tempura rice bowl combo. First of all the noodles tasted like the instant noodles from the grocery store thatI can make at home. The broth was nothing special, and there weren't much veggies in it. Orochon is waaaay better. Their miso broth is superb, the flavor is just amazingly rich. the noodles are fresh, and there are lots of ingredients in the ramen. Bamboo shoots, black fungus, bean sprouts, pork, bell pepper. I would go to orochon instead.

this is my third time here in 2 months, i am currently living in the bay area, but when i go back home to san diego i always make a trip to la for some ramen. theres always going to be a wait during peak hours, but its still about less than an hour. don't bother talking to the people going up to you asking for money, their stories seem to be the same over and over asking for money. parking sucks, if you're lucky enough to find street parking otherwise park in the garage. the best ramen i've had in the states, best i've had is in japan. the soup is so tasty, i always finish everything and drink the soup after. its a good portion too, not too much not too little, very satisfying. hope they open up something good up here in the south bay, santouka in mitsuwa does not compare...

I don't understand the hype behind this restaurant.  Definitely not worth waiting more than 1 hour.  The noodles weren't bad, but it doesn't taste anymore different than other places.  I think this place just has too much hype from people waiting in line outside.   To be honest, the Daikokuya in City of Industry is just as good, dare I say better in service and taste?

Finally got to try this place out last week for dinner with some friends. I had the ramen. The broth was very flavorful with tons of green onions. If you aren't a green onions fan you should tell them to hold off on them. I added some garlic that they have on the table and it made the brother tastes more flavorful. The pork was really tender. I loved the egg the best. It's a hard-boiled egg but it was fully cooked. Next time I come back I need to try the cha-shu.

Can I get a Amen for some RAMEN. Hate the lines, but I love that sign up sheet..no cutters beeyatches! Their fried rice is soooo damn good, it'll make your momma crazy. Their noodles are so gumy..loves it. I usually order the hot stuff but last month I decided to order the cold noodles. I wont go that route ever again..haha. I love the egg, I believe this is marinated in soy sauce. I hate how this has a B rating.., I get so paranoid that I'm gonna get food poisoning..but I sike myself out. Parking is horendous, just pay $6 down the street, its well lit and you don't have to worry about your car being jacked.

Wow. This place has a lot of reviews. Okay, before I get on with the good stuff, let's get rid of the bad. Yes, there's a long wait. However, there's a nice shopping center across the street. Go kill some time by looking at the Japanese fare up for sale and then come back! But I'm reviewing the food and not the faults of the establishment, although I will concede it would be awesome if Daikokuya owned that whole block for their restaurant space. So let's start with my order, which was a small tuna sashimi bowl combo! I say it that way because it's my favorite hands down. I don't think I'll be ordering anything else. That said, let's start with the salad. The portion is good as not to spoil your appetite considering it's somewhat of an anti-salad as it's pretty unhealthy, but oh-so-effing delicious. It's a magical experience everything it hits the lips. Then, the waitress brings out a small bowl of tuna sashimi blanketing some of the best rice I've tasted in the sushi world. The rice is pleasantly sweet and balanced with a tart finish. The sashimi portions are generous and taste great! The fish isn't rubbery, mushy, nor bland. Now for the main event! The ramen. Echoing the many sentiments found throughout this page for Daikokuya, the best ramen I've had. I lived in Seattle, and currently live in O.C. Better than any ramen I've had in the international district in Seattle (Samurai Noodle) and better than Shin-sen-gumi & Men-tatsu in Costa Mesa. Did I mention that Daikokuya is better by far? Everything about it is so good. The broth is heavy I admit, but the flavor is all there. How else are you going to pack all that flavor in there?! It's very savory, complex, and meant to please; the noodles are fresh and of the perfect consistency; the egg offers a nice balance of texture along with the bamboo shoots. When everything is said and done, my bowls are empty. ALL OF THEM. It's a lot of food for the money by the way. So, it offers a one, two, three punch for the taste buds. T.K.O. My taste buds are knocked out and are now in heaven. Extras ordered - Diet coke. Pictures added! Look for the HK images logo. In summary... Service - 10/10 Taste - 10/10 Ambience - 8/10 Value - 10/10 Mind blasting factor - 10/10

probably ridiculous for me to add another review to this place, but as this is one of my three favorite restaurants in la, i feel compelled. ramen is amazing, closest to something you would find in japan. pork just melts in your mouth and the soy sauce egg is done to perfection. i will say this place seemed better a few years ago, but still hands down best ramen you can get in la. side dishes also awesome, like fried rice and unagi bowl.

Service is quick, which is good since it makes you forget that you waited 30+ minutes to sit in a small booth. Having only one type of ramen is sort of good and bad - on one hand it makes it easy to decide but I like the option of choosing different broths (like Miso) and being able to add more vegetables. Overall it was delicious and the minced garlic and radish on the side gave it a nice flavor.

I discovered this place while doing a food tour of Little Tokyo--unfortunately the tour didn't include a tasting here, but I made it a point to come back and try it out after a great recommendation from our guide.  Our guide said that there is always a crazy line out the door and that the owners do not mess around--they call your name once, and if you miss it, no ramen for you!  I returned a few weeks later around 4:45 hoping the line would be a bit shorter because of the odd time.  We still had to wait about 20 minutes, but it was worth it!  Best ramen I've had hands down--I ordered the Daikoku Ramen which is their specialty and consists of pork belly chashu, boiled egg, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, green onions and sesame seeds.  Highly recommend!

I've been coming to this spot almost every time I'm in LA. I love their ramyun here. You combo it up with another dish and it is pretty much as good as it gets for under $12. Went here last Friday with a group of friends, and got seated instantly which is freaking unheard of for most who come here. I guess I was just due. No matter how long you wait it is all to experience the best.

In the mood for some real ramen? Service  is spotty, decor is ok, but the ramen is great! Also if you like ikura, they have a good ikura rice bowl that doesn't skimp on the eggs. Might have to wait on line and parking sucks (gotta find street parking or a lot and none of it is free) but you'll forget about that when your slurping Dow tour noodles. TIP: regulars seem to like putting red Ginger in their ramen- tasty.

This place is okay. The ramen was good but I've had the same kind in San Francisco. I can say the tuna bowl was good and had a few thin slices of Tuna.

A solid 4 stars for this place.  The wait takes a really long time, and the last time I went was during the nisei festival and it took 1.5 hrs, but the ramen bowl never disappoints me.  I always get the regular with kotteri sauce for extra taste in the soup.

If I could eat only one soup for the rest of my life, it would be the Daikokuya ramen. And I love my mother's chicken soup a great deal. This ramen is consistently delicious. It has met my high expectations multiple times. And, like most ramen, it is so cheap and huge! I always split it. I cannot for the life of me understand why anyone would hate on this soup. Maybe you've had better in Japan or "in the valley," but that doesn't mean this soup is not good at all. Don't forget to add some crushed garlic and ginger (to taste). I've never waited in a long line because I always purposefully come at off hours. If you can't come at off hours, be prepared to wait for an hour or more.

I would give this place 5 stars but we had to wait about 1 - 1 1/2 hours to get in.  But the long line is testament to how delicious the food is.   Once we were seated the service was fast! I tried the famous Daikokuya ramen.  It was delish.  I wolfed it down.  Normally I don't eat meat, but my friends persuaded me.  So I ate the tender pork that was swimming in the noodles and didn't regret it.   You will be stuffed after eating here, the quantities are big.  They didn't charge us for hot tea either.   I ordered my husband one of the daikokuya ramen combos to go and when they brought the packages for me to take home it seemed like I had ordered 3 meals.  They made sure to keep the noodles and broth separate so that the flavor and consistency of the ramen would not be compromised.   The prices are great.  Definitely recommend this place!

Seating at the bar is just as good as the booths. The gyoza is made of pork meat, and the dipping sauce can be mixed with garlic for an authentic dipping sauce. The combination Ramen comes with a bowl of fried rice or your choice of meat, i had the sashimi and it was OK.  I mixed the rice with the wasabi and soy sauce once after i finished the sashimi and the rice actually tasted better. The Ramen is good, the noodles are much better than Orochon's noodles, and the broth is a rich pork broth. The toppings are all included; egg, green onions, and etc. where as Orochon charges per topping separately. The best part of the course is the pork belly strips they use in the Ramen, I couldn't believe the taste and texture, it just melts in your mouth and you wonder what kind of hog they butcher for such a wonderful taste. Overall this is the place to hit up if you have time to kill in line and your in the mood for authentic Ramen. 1 hr wait, but worth it!

I adore this place.  Parking is never easy and there is always a line but my very short term memory becomes even worse when I sit down with a hot bowl of their yummy ramen.  There is a reason why this place is known for their ramen though- once I ordered their tonkatsu and was completely underwhelmed.  After that, I stick to their ramen.  There is only one thing at Daikokuya that I love more than their ramen... their perfectly soft boiled egg that they add to all the ramen bowls... I try to replicate it at home but I fail every time... how do you do it, Daikokuya?  How??

I'll tell you what, we got lucky probably because its Christmas eve, park about half a block away and we waited less than 40 minutes before we got seated!!   My first time here and I have been waiting for months to try this place.  Finally the day has arrived!!!  I ordered the Daikokuya Ramen with Tuna Sashimi bowl and it came with salad also.  First off salad, wow, cut very thin which was very easy to chew and eat with the amazing dressing, better than all japanese restaurants I have ever been!!!  Second comes the Tuna Sashimi bowl with rice, again, this is amazing!!!  Finally the ramen, ahhh the ramen!!  Their ramen is to die for!!!  I literally inhaled the ramen and ate it so quick that I totally forgot my surroundings lol.  I downed my food with their hot sake which was very smooth and hot tea to finish my meal off.  Yeah I know, call me weird with my sake and tea, so sue me!!!  Well don't sue me, but trust me when I say, go try DaikoKuya.  I promise you will not be disappointed!!  ITADAKIMASU!!!

My cousin took me here a couple times when I came down to visit and said this was the best ramen place ever.  I never really had ramen before so didn't know how good ramen would be like.  There was always a wait and a long line out in front of the restaurant when we came so I would walk around to Japanese stores across the street and shop around while my cousin waits in line.  Place was small and always packed no matter what time you come.  Finally got seated and we got the sausage as appetizers.  About six finger sized sausages with some spicy mustard, tasted pretty good.  The ramen finally came out and I was anxious to dive in.  The bowls were huge and enough to keep you full and satisfied.  The soup as flavorful and the meat was tender and thinly sliced.  I liked the egg that went with it too, was boiled but the yolk was still a little runny at the same.  Great  first ramen experience!

Great ramen, it was yummy. Their chasiu is so tender, but I was even more impressed by the spicy tuna rolls. It was GOOD. The workers were very friendly as well. The only downside was that it was slightly pricey and the ramen serving size was a bit too much for me! I'd go back eventually for those spicy tuna rolls though.

I would like to give this restaurant one star so that other people will stop going there and I won't have to wait 40 minutes to be seated.  Having said that, it was well worth every one of those 40 long minutes. We went on a Monday night at 8.15.  There were 15 or so people on the list before us.  When we left at about 9.45 there were at least a dozen people outside waiting to get in. We sat at the counter which was good since I was able to talk to the person sitting next to me to find out what he'd ordered--the ramen noodle combo with the shredded pork.  Based on the size of his meal, my husband and I ordered one combo with the pork and a single bowl of the noodles.  It was still too much food and I ended up taking a good bit of my soup home. Service was extremely quick and friendly.  The pork in the ramen was amazingly tender.  The broth was so very flavorful.  My husband, who frequently travels through Tokyo on business said it was comparable to what he eats there.   I need to talk about the pork for a minute.  Because I would totally marry this pork and live happily ever after.  Little bits of braised pork belly that are served over rice with tons of green onions and some pickle.  A-MAZ-ING. It's loud.  It's extremely casual.  Expect a long wait.  FANTASTIC food.

A buddy hyped this place up like crazy so finally tried it on my LA visit.  It was ok, but didn't live up to the hype.  Ramen = 3.5 stars.  It was satisfying, noodles and soup were good, but Chaisu was average. eggs are below average hard boiled like I cooked them myself .  I give the spot an overall 4 for the pork rice bowl which was a 4.5.  Now that was the sheet  Ya gotta get it with the ramen.  Not trying to start a NorCal/SoCal ramen war, but seems like NorCal is better.  Chaisu, eggs and broth are so much better.  Ramen dojo still on the top spot.

I've been here twice.  The first time, there was no line and we cruised right in.  The second time, there were 4 people in line and it took 20 minutes to get in.  Eesh.  Overall, I really like this joint.  The door curtain gave a bad first impression because it's a bit dirty and you have to walk through it (gentlemen, hold it open for the ladies).  The gyoza is super fresh and I really like how all of them are fried into one mass that you have to break apart.  The first bite I had of the gyoza made me think "what the heck is that taste?" and then I realized that the taste was of a homemade made-from-scratch kind of taste reminiscent of mom's dumplings. The pork belly bowl was AWESOME.  And the ramen is by far the best I've tasted in Little Tokyo (I've tried 4 places).  It even tasted good after sitting in the fridge for 2 days!  I would have rounded up to 5 stars if the bathroom  and the ambiance was better.  In sum, if you come to Little Tokyo looking for above average ramen and a great gyoza, come here if the line isn't too long.

I went around 6:30 last night and there was no line! Surprise, surprise.  I recommend getting the combination because you get a rice bowl as well as their signature daikoku ramen.  Even though the portion for the rice bowl is smaller than their normal rice bowls, it is still a decent amount.  Why not pay an extra $3-4 when you can get it to go and save it for another meal?   Tried their gyoza for the first time.  Wasn't too impressed. If any of you are from USC, I recommend Soy's potstickers instead.  But overall, Daikokuya is one of my favorite ramen places in LA! :)

Well. Well....well. Daikokuya. Me and Daikokuya, we've always enjoyed each other's company. I've been coming here to eat ramen for 9 years, and throughout that whole time Daikokuya has been at the top of my list for ramen. Deep, savory rich broth; chewy noodles and melt-in-your-mouth pork. So good. Heaven. I haven't been by as often as I used to, but this last time marked a huge change. We swung by Monday at 11 am sharp to get a booth. My friend dropped me off out front while he parked. I went in, waited to be sat. There was no one ahead of me, everyone else had been sat, there was a booth and most of the counter open. I waited. I wrote my name down on the list, just in case. I waited some more. Waitresses came and went to the tables, taking orders and bringing food. My friend eventually showed up, having parked and walked over, and we waited some more. Maybe 12 minutes total of just standing there. They're not supposed to sit you unless you're whole party is there, but they didn't know that since they never approached me. Eventually someone wandered over and let us sit at the last booth. Not a good sign, but Daikokuya has spotty service sometimes, and I don't come for the service anyway. I come for the food. We ordered and said food came promptly. I got the fried rice/ramen combo, friend got the pork bowl/ramen. Salad and fried rice was tasty and just as good as it always has been, but my friend's pork was half-burnt. Still tasty, but half of it was pretty crispy black. Then our ramen came out. This is the source of my sadness. You can read the other reviews that attest to the deliciousness of Daikokuya's broth. What we got served wasn't it. The broth was thinner, tasteless. It tasted like salt water with some garlic thrown in. No depth, no hidden richness. Just murky salt liquid. The noodles tasted stale and old. They felt mealy and leaden, and there was no chew when you bit into them. They lay in the soup like dead worms. The bean sprouts were same as always, but I found maybe two pieces of bamboo total in the bowl. Sad. The pork was also reliably good, but we both only got two pieces per bowl. I'm pretty sure the serving size used to be bigger. I've always found the seasoned egg to be hit-and-miss too, and today it was a miss. Just the barest hint of taste, and the inside was dry, dry, dry. Sad. Also, the waitress completely forgot spoons, and it took a couple tries to get them. It's usually a struggle to polish off a whole bowl of the ramen, and though I normally don't make it to the end, I put up a valiant fight, polishing off all the noodles and hunting around for those last bits of pork and bamboo that hide out at the bottom of the bowl, drinking as much broth as I can handle. We all waddle out the door and groan about how full our bellies are. This visit, my friend and I both ate half-heartedly till we were full, pushed the bowls away, and got the check. I don't think I'll be back until someone tells me Daikokuya is back as well. Frankly, now that Ramen Jinya has added their tonkotsu black broth to the menu full-time, I don't think I'll even miss you, Daikokuya. I wish that made me sadder.

I went here 10 minutes before opening time on a weekday and there was no wait!  I have to say that their ramen was the best I've had in LA.  The noodles were cooked perfectly and the broth was not too salty.  The place started to fill up very quickly.

As a ramen foodie, and after trying the rest of the places in Little Tokyo, I can say that this is the best Ramen place in Little Tokyo. You don't have to let you impress for the B signal post on the door, I ate here many times and I have  never had a bad experience. The place only offers 2 kind of ramen, the regular one (with the pork,  soya sprouts, chive, bamboo and a boiled egg) and the same one but with the extra fat from the pork. The price is 8.50 for a large bowl so its quite reasonable. Besides the ramen you can also choose from  other interesting plates such a  sushi rolls, chicken or eel teriyaki bowls, etc. But to be honest the star plate here is the Ramen. Well, I almost forgot that they also have other kind the Ramen the one that it served with the noodle on the side, but I have never tasted it so  I am a classic ramen girl, jeje Soo in my Los Angeles Ramen scale I would say this place is the second one in my list just after the Santouka in Mar vista.

Hands down the best Ramen on earth:) but I am sure just about every review you read will state this. If you are looking for an alternative, try the shredded pork bowl. The pork is flavorful and juicy. Also I would suggest trying the japanese sausages.They come with raw onions and a hot mustard for dipping. Great appetizer! Trust me, it's well worth the wait.

This has got to be my favorite ramen house. Hell, I go to school in Philadelphia, but I fly home every break to go eat here.  Well, I actually fly home to see my family and friends, but you get the point. I like to order my noodles a little harder (al dente for you foodies), and extra pork.  If you're feeling adventurous, or want an early coronary, get a side of kotteri (seasoned fat) to throw into the ramen for some extra flavor. The line is long since there are few tables, but saddle up to the counter and meet your new neighbor if you don't want to wait as long. I'm not sure if they accept visa/mc/amex? But I assume you'll have $10 cash money on your person for some top-notch grub.  This place is so good that if you needed to decide whether to spend $10 on enough gas just to get home, or eat ramen, it'd probably be a toss-up.

the people that filled the list felt a form of collective anxiety as we waited for our number/name to be called out. please, please let us be next was all i could think as i was getting dizzily hungry. everything tastes amazing when you are a starving child. honestly  the ramen was ridiculously amazing regardless of the fact that my stomach was eating itself as i waited. she called everyone with a party of 2 before us. i would highly recommend not going on a friday night with a group larger than 2. i felt so bad for the group of 4 and 5 before us because they waited even longer! the group of 5 guys cheered once they got seated. i felt like doing so too once we got a booth, but i was too weak and hungry! this is because we (a group of 3) waited for literally 1 hour and 10 min. first off, once we got seated, so did 8 people at the counter and 3 other tables. spots are clear for what seems like forever and then they seat everyone at the same time. they were highly understaffed and that definitely contributed to the long wait. luckily, it didnt take too long to get our food once we were seated but honestly, i wasnt sure if it was worth it because i was feeling so faint. none of us had dinner, we got there around 9:20 pm and got seated at 10:30 and we were all feeling woozy. then again, the ramen was SOOOOOOO good. and its a huge bowl of tasty, cloudy yummi-ness. we all decided that nothing could be worth that long of a wait but just be prepared to wait if you go on a fri, sat night and all is well. we left with full, happy bellies in the end. and thats what matters. service is a luxury! 5 stars for the food

This is probably one of the few spots you should consider eating at whenever you are in Little Tokyo. You're only other alternatives would be chain stores which are rather bland, or probably too expensive for everyday eatery. It's good, it's cheap, and it's relatively fast. Relatively, because you might have to wait a little white before actually getting seated. Don't feel like ramen? The tonkatsu is pretty damn good, too. And so is the little salad they give you... this coming from someone who usually loathes salad.

Woooohoo! Winter is coming up with a quickness! and the weather is getting chilly outside....especially in the evening...When it'scold out, I start to crave a Big Bowl of Soup!  Not like a Chicken Noodle Soup..... Ramen! It's not the kind that you tear off the plastic and fill it up with hot water.  You haven't tried Ramen until you've tried Daikokuya located in Little Tokyo.  For not so big eaters, you can order the regular bowl, but for the heavy appetites.... You can order the Large Bowl which has twice the smoked black pork, twice the noodles....This Bowl is such a monstrousity, you'll end up hella full!  I have  yet to try to Ramen and side dish combo though.... you know like gyoza, side of fried rice, or even some katsu.  The place is good that their is always a waiting list unless you go right when it's open.  The average wait is 30 minutes.

Now, I am by no means a ramen connousieur.  Most of the time I think all ramen places taste the same, or pretty close to the same - even the ones that are supposed to be "best of".  But this place, even, naive little ol' me knows is different.  The broth is just so flavorful, hearty, and delicious, I couldn't get enough of it.  The noodles were the perfect mix between soft and chewy, and I loved all the veggies and what-not tossed in.  I had the Daikokuya Ramen which was fairly inexpensive and incredibly filling - i couldn't even finish it! One star off because as we walked out I noticed the great big "C" hanging in the window.  But as my friend said, "The lower the grade, the better tasting the food"!

This is a good place... but it's definitely not the be all end all of ramen.  Part of it is the mood and part of it is the food.  Honestly, it's just too crazy there for me to consider during regular eating hours.  I think the stardom has had an effect on the service and the food.  There have been a couple times where the salad had FAR too much dressing and the miso soup that comes with the meals came lukewarm rather than hot.  (lukewarm miso soup is pretty disgusting.)  Also, the ramen is okay... perfectly serviceable, and more than that if you like your ramen kotteri style.  Good. But the gyoza is still awesome.  Another awesome thing: the shredded pork rice bowl, which takes the awesome pork chashu used for the ramen and makes it somehow awesomer with grilled sweetness.  Those two will fill you (or two of you!) up for not that much.  Very worthwhile.

This place is a GEM!  If you want authentic japanese ramen -- Daikokuya is it.  The deep pork broth (probably simmered for hours) and the nicely done al dente noodles are reasons enough to check it out!  This ain't your mom's attempt in making top ramen at home for you -- these people don't mess around.  The only drawback is the long wait......but it's definitely well worth it.  A sign of a great restaurant is how long the wait is.

Really good ramen especially if you get it kotteri style. Their dumplings are also really good. And their chicken and egg bowl (reuniting mother and child as the menu calls it) is very tasty as well. Downside to this place is there is ALWAYS a wait and the wait is usually around 40 minutes. It's also fairly cramped inside and none of their tables seats more then 4 comfortably. You can squeeze 5 or 6 people at the table but it's pretty cramped at that point. I did a longer review here: http://twoguystastela.co…

Love their ramen, hate the wait. Went twice, once a year or two ago just by chance, & there was a 5-10 min wait. Second time was in January of this year on a Sunday afternoon, waited about an hour. Ridiculous! Love/hate yelp. I'll go back only on off days. Their ramen is so f"ing good. Their broth is creamy, so if you prefer a soy sauce type of broth, you might not love it. I love both. Parking can be a pain. Afterwards, I walk to Mitsuru cafe & get  imagawayaki, little warm pastry filled with red bean paste. Minus 1 star for the ridiculous wait.

This was a good find indeed.  Went on a Thursday afternoon 1:30p'ish, and got seated almost right away.  Had their featured ramen (tonkotsu) and thought it was good... a delicate balance of flavors.  Having been to Japan quite a few times and had true authentic ramen there, I had something to compare it with.  The broth was milky white, as expected, but it was actually thinner than I expected.  Because of that, it didn't feel as heavy, nor salty.  Perhaps I should go for the xtra flavor option next time.  But it was rich enough by the time I finished.  The egg was done just about right, and the pork melted in your mouth and was very flavorful....  not for the faint of heart because they're quite fatty but that's why they melt.  Had the combo shredded (i think) pork in rice, and that was stellar!  It had just the right amount of green onions and fixin's on top to not overpower it.  The gyozas were above average, delicate skin and flavoring.  Liked their bottomless refillable green ice tea.   In short, this is where I'll go from now on for ramen in LA.  Beware that most street parking there is 1hr limit.  Bring lots of quarters.

I saw great things about this place so I had high expectations--come on, I went all the way to LA to eat RAMEN. Happily for once I was NOT dissapointed. My girlfriends and I came here for lunch and at noon there was already a line of 5 parties waiting before us. Talk about POPULAR. We ordered 2 Daikokuya ramen bowls and the roasted pork belly. the bowls were HUGE. We waited 20 minutes (STARVING) and we still could not finish all the food. The ramen noodles were chewy and the broth was flavorful without being salty. The crushed garlic and pickled ginger added the extra zing.

A old friend took me to Daikokuya a couple years ago when i first moved to Los Angeles.  I was so excited since I heart noodles and they don't have ramen places like this at home in Maine. So of course I had to try the Daikokuya ramen, especially because that is what they are known for.  I couldn't believe how big the noodle bowl was!!  I ate and ate and can't seem to see the bottom of it.  The noodles was pretty good,   the broth was nice, not too salty and the pork was very tender as well.  It was much better than the place a couple doors down, which I can't remember the name of it at the moment.         I recommend that you go before you even feel hungry since there always seem to be a line no matter when you go, so be prepared to wait.  They don't take reservations, you just put your name on the broad and wait.  If you decided to sit at the bar, be sure to get a nice cold drink since they do the noodles cooking behind the bar so its always steamy and hot.   Overall, I'm a fan of this place and it a nice join to go when I want a bowl of ramen.

We got here at around 10pm and the wait was about 15 mins for party of 5. We ordered some appetizers, and the signature daikoku ramen. I ordered the half size since the bowls were huge. They messed up my order and brought me out a big bowl, so they gave me a big bowl for the price of a half size. I shared my portion with  my husband. The broth is very tasty filled with tons of flavor, the egg was cooked to perfection where the yolk was nicely soften inside. The slices of black pork was very tender and melts in your mouth. I was not too big on the appetizers, we ordered some tuna rolls and tuna sashimi. But again, this a ramen house so it still deserves my 4 stars rating.

Over rated place! The waitresses are pretty bitchy. They have poor customer service, and they are impatient when taking your order. They want to rush you in and rush you out; that's also why they won't seat your party until everyone has arrived. The place is small, uncomfortable, and hot. No Air conditioning. Limited menu. Ordered the house special ramen.. The broth is pretty bland. The noodles have a good texture, bounce off your teeth type noodles, but that's it. That's the only good part. Taste wise, it's standard. Nothing special. Same as everywhere else-typical curly egg noodle from the bag. Tried the ramen w/ Kotteri flavor as well, which is the one recommended for tonkatsu lovers. The broth was a bit tastier than the original, but the amount of fat shows in the broth. The oils float on top, shouting, "High cholesterol high cholsterol! Clogged arteries! Heart attack! Eat me eat me, and die a  gluttonous death! "   I don't see whats so great about this ramen place. The meat in the ramen is very tasty though, but there were literally only 2 slices. What a rip off. I'd want at least 4 slices for such a big bowl. Tried the shredded pork bowl, as well as the teri chicken bowl...pretty typical. The teri chicken has a nice crisp fried thick layer on the skin, which made it very crunchy. The shredded pork was just pork cubes-nothing impressive. All of us, however, loved the sauce on the salad they start you with when you order the combination, where it's the ramen + some small bowl. The sauce is delicious. Couldn't get enough of it! Still, I will most likely not come here again, based on poor service, lengthy wait time, poor atmosphere, and the food fails to live up to its hype. Plus, parking is a bitch. I'd rather go somewhere else where parking is offered and where my taste buds will thank me after I eat.

Dailkokuya serves the BEST ramen in Los Angeles.  Although we're always number 12 to 25 on the wait list, Daikokuya's Daikoku ramen and gzosas are absolutely worth the wait.  To pass the time, while waiting in line, we usually grab a drink at the Far Bar, located a few doors down (south), in what looks to be an alley or courtyard.  After we've had a drink, we make our way back to the restaurant and our table is ready.  As we are seated, I notice their unique Japanese music, which transports me to the 'It's a Small World' ride at Disneyland, and like the ride, I have a very pleasant and enjoyable experience.  At Daikokuya, you will consistently receive very friendly and quick service.  I've been here countless times and their ramen continues to be soothing and comforting.  Not too heavy, not too light - just right.

This place always has a line out the door and many of my friends rave about it. That being said, I don't see what's so special. Their specialty is the tonkotsu ramen, which is always just so-so for me. The oyako donburi is pretty tasty. A little pricey for just ramen; you should definitely go for one of the combos and take some home to make it worth your money.

not much to say that hasnt been said already. the density of the noodles is at the right place. the broth is thick and flavorful. there's also a neat collection of retro japanese advertisements that make you think, "wow that tweed jacket is pretty fresh." however, i'll have to say that it's not an ideal place for lunch on a hot day. the place is stuffy as it is already. and then you're scarfing down a steaming bowl of ramen. also, you're kinda jammed against other people. it kinda makes you feel a bit faint

Ive been here many times and it has become one of my favorite places to eat in LA, or anywhere for that matter. Get the pork fried rice and ramen bowl and you will not regret it. They give very, very large portions at a relatively small price. All the food I've tied has been excellent but I love my favorites here making it very hard to deviate. The ambiance is casual and fun. My only warning is be prepared to wait. Its a pretty small place that does a good turnaround but no matter what time you come you'll probably have to wait half an hour. Believe me, its worth it.

I LOVE Daikokuya. I'm Japanese so I know my RAMENs. It's really tasty, has a great flavor to the soup, and the noodle is aldente. The only thing about Daikokuya is that if you get there during the busy hour, you'll have to wait for a long time. Not only that, you are going to have to look for parking, because there is no parking lot reserved for Daikokuya. My pet peeve about Ramen is that, it should be scorching HOT(temperature HOT) when it comes out. I mean so HOT that you can't just mow it down, because your hungry. Daikokuya lacks this. It's usually room temperature and even if it has great flavor, it makes me feel like it was left out sitting on the counter....forgotten. I bet every RAMEN lover will continue to come back despite the long wait.

as a ramen lover this place is heaven. order the daiko with kotteri flavor but not more than once a week - your heart may not be able to take the rich broth. compared to my second favorite place a block away - Orochon -  Daiko has a much richer broth. Orochon just gives you salt, soy, or miso but Daiko must boil those pork hocks all day long to get the flavor so rich... I like Orochon's noodles much better and their pork as well. it melts in your mouth but damn....Daiko's broth is just... heaven. Warning: not everyone is a fan of the tonkotsu style broth so be warned. it's rich, it's probably hella fattening, and you must love pork.

Not for vegetarians, but the others couldn't get enough of the pork broth.   The lines suck and this type of food just isn't to my taste.  But all in all I would say at this price it is worth a try for the experience.

What else could possibly be said about the place that has about a billion five star reviews? Don't ask any questions. Just go. Get the Daiko ramen and the shredded pork bowl combo. And another tip: even though every ounce of your being will want to take another bite, stop when you're full! They have to-go containers and then the bliss that is Daikokuya can extend into the next day (and trust me, it stays delicious even after being reheated)!

One of the top ramen joints in LA. Their charsiu pork is melt in your mouth goodness. Also their fried rice is butter heaven. Expect a 30min wait but definitely well worth it.

The pork broth is the best I've ever had with my ramen. Daikokuya creates the best tonkotsu ramen period. You won't find any other place with so much flavor intensity in every bite. Expect a  long wait when you arrive, but the wait will definitely be worth it.  Service is quick and the staff is very friendly. I recommend getting the Ramen combo with the shredded pork  bowl! This bowl is probably the best bowl on the list. (Plus it one of the cheaper ones). I can never have too much pork in a meal.  For those who want more pork flavor in their broth, ask to have your ramen kotteri!

This is the best ramen place in Los Angeles! The ramen and broth are perfection. Rich, oily, and yummy, the broth is soo good. I also love the scallions and sesame seeds they add. I used to come here with friends when I went to USC. Since then, I've brought my family and they all love it. The restaurant is small, so tends to get busy during lunch and dinner. The best time is to go in between. There's also only street parking, or parking structures on the other side of Little Tokyo. Totally worth the 3 dollar parking though!

Daikokuya is one of those rare places that is worthy of the crazy amount of hype it receives.  Went here after seeing the sheer volume of people that reviewed, and damn, it did not disappoint.   The ramen is simply fantastic.  Great broth with rich pork flavor, tender slices of Berkshire pork belly, and noodles cooked to al dente perfection.  The noodles are actually my favorite part as most ramen places overcook their noodles (for my taste).  The minced garlic condiment is also a nice touch that adds even more flavor to the broth.   As great as the ramen is, some of the other dishes are even better.  What really gets me going at Daikokuya is the pork fried rice.  I have never had fried rice that tasted so good.  It's hard to describe since I've never even had fried rice that tasted anything like it.  The last time I went to Daikokuya I didn't even order any ramen, just a big plate of fried rice.  The nice thing is that you don't have to make a decision between the two, as Daikokuya offers a variety of combinations that include a full bowl of ramen and a side of another dish.  The shredded pork bowl, while a tad on the sweet side, is another strong dish, although not nearly as delectable as the fried rice.   The gyoza were really the only weak link.  They weren't bad, they just didn't match the sensational quality of everything else.  Daikokuya is straight up quality food.  No bells and frills.  Just good ass food.

From the Ramen places I have tried, Daikokuya is my favorite. The broth is very flavorful, the egg is soft and is marinated in some kind of soy sauce that makes it very tasty, and the noodles have a chewy consistency. Next time I am going to order it extra hot (temperature wise) because the lukewarmness was the only think i disliked.

Excellent noodles with great taste of pork fat.  Lots of food for price.  You can split several dishes and still come out under 20 bucks.  Small and you have to wait but the wait is short.  Great food.  Take the Goldline to Little Tokyo (one stop past Union Station) and when you get off keep walking as if you are going to the Japanese American Museum and continue.  You will see the tiny little place.

We stayed in a hotel right across this ramen store and always saw a long line there from 11am to 11pm almost everyday. That was why we decided to give it a try. The portion is good. The food is OK. The wait is INSANE - 1.5 hour total and that was Tuesday afternoon at 3:30pm. It was not worth the wait. I got so mad to myself for wasting the whole hour and half . I can tell the soup base is from the real pork bone but everything is way too salty. The meat is a bit too hard. The egg is overcooked. Overall, this ramen is just a bit above the average. I can easily point out at least 3 other ramen places that are as good as this one - or even better. Their services are not consistent either. They totally forgot to bring the check to another party of customers and they also had to wait 30min more just to get the credit card back. At meanwhile, they brought us our check right after we got our ramen. Seems like they tried to rush us out and it made me feel bad since I JUST SAT DOWN!!! I'll NEVER RETURN. Life is too precious to waste on a bowl of regular noodle. There are plenty of good Japanese restaurants around this area.

Everything they say about this place is true. Go now! Large portions for the price you pay. If you arrive by 10:45 AM, you'll be able to avoid the long lines that can be a turnoff for anyone who just wants a fast meal.  I never understood what the hype over ramen was about before visiting Daikokuya, but after tasting the flavorful broth with my firm noodles, I am now a firm believer of GOOD ramen places.

I just moved back to LA after living in New York for a few years. I was a ramen maniac while in the big city - Momofuku, Sapporo, Setagaya, Ippudo, Minca, Rai rai ken...you name it I ate it. I don't have any Japanese cred whatsoever, but I've eaten my fair share of ramen... and Daikokuya blew them all out of the water (except for maybe rai rai ken on 10th street with its Wong Kar Wai ambience). The wait was long, and we were crushed by the front door due to the pouring rain but I'm glad we waited because...quite possible the best ramen I've ever tasted. No joke! First the shredded cabbage salad with big mac sauce - perfect little teaser, perfect mix of healthy and heart attack. The tempura was crisp and fresh, and the ramen was flavorful, not insanely rich (I'm looking at you Ippudo!), the noodles bouncy and fresh, the egg perfectly cooked, and it comes in two sizes!! Who could ask for anything more?

I would just say that I'm a fan of this place.  My friend hyped it up a lot for me, to be honest, and it didn't change my life.  It had delicious food and prompt service, but definitely wasn't the best food of my life.  The ramen was just above average, but the spicy tuna appetizer was great.  it came with a special dipping salt that was delicious.  the prices are also a little high, since I ended up paying about $14 after splitting an appetizer with somebody.  All in all, though, great.  the wait also wasn't too long, and you can spend most of it at the square across the street anyways.

The salads are simple but the dressing is absolutely delish! A must try place for tourists and locals alike!!! Get the combo ramen and chicken egg bowl and split it with a friend.

This place has great ramen but be warned that it could be an hour wait. The broth is a little fatty but I love it that way. I love how authentic it is.

When its 12am and you you're craving something warm and big to hit the spot, this is the place to go. The place is small and you may have to wait a while, but its decorated with a bunch of japanese pop art which gives it a really vintage feel. The soup itself comes in a large bowl with a thicker than usual pork broth. So trust me you are NOT going to leave hungry. The broth itself is to die for, and the side dishes don't disappoint either. If you ask me this place definitely beats Orochan. My only complaint is that the restaurant is small and cramped, and if you end up getting the counter it can be uncomfortable. Other than that this place is uber dope.

pretty good. not as excellent as i thought it'd be cuz of all the great reviews. maybe cuz i'm not used to this kind of ramen yet. There isn't variety when it comes to ramen but i guess that's how they do it. the broth is a bit milky which was interesting. it kinda reminded my friend and me of a korean beef stock noodle soup (sullungtang).  I think i would've enjoyed the ramen more if the noodles were a little on the softer side. however, the portions are huge and we each got the combo. friend got donkatsu on rice and i got the chicken/egg on rice. we were so stuffed! we didn't finish half of our food. i liked the cabbage salad that came in the beginning of our meal. It's good food for cheap, and I love how they have Kirin on tap!   yummiest element were the silky smooth pork slices in the broth. i think it was pork..but it was so soft i'm not entirely sure. if so, i'm impressed. part of the experience involves sitting at the bar and watching the boys behind the counter work. i think they thought we were checking them out cuz my friend and i kept watching their every move cuz we were so intriqued by this whole ramen house concept. (nonexistent in chicago). everytime one of the guys turned around he caught our smiles and stares. prolly thought we were smiling at him but we were really just oogling the steamy broth being poured over the noodles. sorry dude.

Daikokuya is one of those places you can go if you've got a craving for Ramen at around 11:00pm.  Even then there is a queue! The Daikoku Ramen is their staple which includes the half cooked egg, green onions, sprouts, sliced pork and the hearty soup all prepared to your liking.  If you're tempted to clog your arteries, you can order it Koterri in which they add pork fat to the soup.  Mmmmm. Besides the ramen they also have a few other entries such as terriyaki chiken and eel rice bowl.  A number of combination sets gives you an order of the Daikoku Ramen with a small side. The walls are filled with old Japanese movie posters, advertisements and metal signs.  It certainly has a hole-in-the-wall feel. It does feel cramped especially with all the people waiting.  Service is good.  They kept my tea cup filled. Is it worth the wait? Absolutely!  And if you're use to dining around Little Tokyo, you should be quite use to it already.

best place for ramen east of japan and west of arizona. the pork melts in your mouth, the noodles are perfectly cooked; and if you strategically eat your meal, finish by cutting the egg in half and fill the yolk socket with the delicious broth. make it a combo with a rice bowl and you'll be breathing like you're in labor. the perfect meal after a hard day at the gym. if looking 'fat' is your thing, go to sleep after your meal and when you're done taming that food coma, i think you'll be quite happy with what you see in the mirror. side note:  this place HAD a 'C' rating and still had a line out the door.

In southern california, for ramen you can't go wrong with Daikokuya, Shinsengumi, or Santoku.  However, as a personal preference, I prefer Daikokuya over Shinsengum and Santoku.  They only have 3 different kind of ramen (standard, dry, and new "kinchi"), but they got all of the basic component perfect.  Hearty broth that is not too salty, soft-boiled egg( a rare treat for US ramen ), tender and fatty chasu pork, and noodle that is just a little bit undercooked, so that by the time you eat them they still retain the "Q"-ness.  The biggest problem with Dakikokuya, however, isn't the food, but limited seating.  It's packed all hours of the day.   Even at 3pm on a Tuesday week day, you should expect at least a 10~15min wait.  Be prepare to wait WAY much longer on normal dinner/lunch hours.

Daikokuya is the shit. doesn't compare to Orochon and trust me on this. If you want Orochon, just go open up a pack of shin ramen and your own veggies because that's what it comes down to. Get the combo deal here, it's so worth it and they give you a lot. I got the "munchies" at 11pm and still couldn't finish it...and that's crazy talk. Had to to-go the rest. Much better value than Orochon (across the street) and the broth is just too good...

This is one of the better ramen joints in los angeles.  The noodles have a strong consistency and texture which complements the broth nicely.  In the dead heat of summer what business does anyone have sipping hot soup in a poorly ventilated room you may ask?  Well if you can stand the ridiculous wait and cramped booths, you will enjoy a solid bowl of ramen.  The rice bowls are excellent as well, particularly the ones of the pork variety.  However it turned out to be quite a bit of food.  I recommend a large bowl of their kotteri with a healthy dollop of garlic mush and call it a night!

As long as you have good company to kick it with outside.   Had both the ramen and the cold ramen, same things. Just depends on how hot you wanna eat it. Salad/coleslaw has a great dressing and their gyoza are cooked well with a good amount of crisps. I have gone to the one in Montery Park its good because they have 1/2 sizes but for some reason it was just not the same as Little Tokyo.

other than the crazy wait to be seated ... you will be rewarded for the suffering! dress warm (if its cold out) and have good company. pretend you're going camping ... anyway, im in love with their ramen & shredded pork rice bowl combo. the yummy porkiness of the broth and the pork bowl is soo goood. the pork is nicely sauteed with teriyaki sauce and served with rice. the sauce saturates the rice so every bite just gets better. and the generous amount of green onion ... i am salivating just thinking about it. so hurry up and go!

My favorite ramen joint in LA. The broth is tasty, the pork belly tender, and the noodles are done just right. Add some garlic into the broth for an extra kick and get the ramen with combination bowls if you're hungry enough. I usually go with the "shredded pork bowl" which is actually made with the same black pork belly that they use in the ramen.

Been here several times and food is always on point.  The ramen combos are a steal and will def get you full.  I usually get the shredded pork or the chicken.  The salad is pretty good and that dressing is straight crack!  This place is usually poppin' and you will probably have to wait a while before you get seated.  Parking isn't that bad and there's a a nice little convenient store a couple stores down.

I used to like this place, but the past few times going, something is missing. Not sure if it's more bland or sour tasting.  They do have good side bowls, but wait is way too long. I rather go to Santouka, it's much better, at least the Salted Pork one. It's so yummy making me drool right now.

A slam dunk of a noodle bar.  The noodles were freshly prepared, perfectly textured and in great portions.  Solid menu and they do it well.  Presentation, service, freshness of the ingredients and the atmosphere made me feel like I was walking into a back alley brothy noodle altar out of Blade Runner.  Dig it.  It can get a little busy and there are clusters of people waiting at the front at times, but totally worth the wait.  Authentic, perfect, delicious bowls of heaven.  The broth is art.  And its close to my house.  Yay!

Not even sure the point of rating this place as there are more than a thousand already.  Either way, I'll just reiterate what everyone else has been saying: delicious ramen.  The portions are more than generous, and the broth is so damn good.  However, since the place is always major crowded and the broths emit crazy heat, it is a bit stuffy in there (but what you can expect at a Japanese ramen restaurant?).  Also, it's in the Little Tokyo, so just sign your name down on their list and check out the local shops while you wait for your table.  Good times to be had!

Best ramen in LA.  During my brief visit to LA, I have tried 5 ramen restaurants, including Daikokuya (Japantown and Monterey Park shops), Mr. Ramen, Orochon Ramen and Hakata Ramen.  To my taste, Daikokuya serves the best ramen.  Soup and noodle taste great.  It comes out with the right temperature.   Second is Hakata Ramen.  Their soup is very good, but I don't like thin noodles.  Not sure if they serve thick noodles.  I did not ask. Orochon Ramen is overhyped for its spicy noodle challenge.  Soup is only spicy and salty.  Not good at all.

I just found the best ramen shop in LA... all these years, i was only in love with Santouka.  But the Daikokuya ramen kotteri style I had there today was out of this world.   I will say noodles, pork, and soup base are VERY VERY VERY close in awesome to Santouka.   But what puts it over the top is the perfectly boiled egg.  The marinated egg has a soft yolk.  Not so soft that in runs, the yolk holds and has an awesome texture to it.   See my pictures of this perfectly boiled egg.   http://richmarphotograph… Go get a bowl now!!

After serious consideration, I had to give this place a 5.  The Ramen was THE BEST EVER, forget about just in L.A.!  I was very fortunate to have my first experience be a great one.  We walked in, and got a seat right away.  While eating our dinner, we got to see what everyone else was complaining about , as far as the wait times go.  There must have been about 15 people waiting, when we walked out.  I will definitely wait in line, the next time we go back, and I won't complain about it, because I know that only shows that the place is doing everything right!

Prepare for a longgg wait.  We (7) went in the middle of the afternoon (not even meal time) and waited a good while. The place has counter space and the rest are booths. So don't try to go there with more than 5 ppl. We had to split up. By the time we (the second group) got a table, the first group was almost done. The soup is better in NYC (I live in NY and visits my folks in LA regularly).  Wonder if the Monterey Park spot have more tables for large group and better soup base? For sure they have free parking!

I usually go to orochon for Japanese ramen, however last sunday my friend suggested that I try daikokuya. and he was right their ramen is reaaaaaaaalllyy good. they have only one kind, so you don't really get to choose, but it is worth your money! it is tonkotsu ramen but its not too "greasy" or it doesnt have that porky smell. it was really good and all that waiting in line was worth it. i would definately go back for more. oh and i like thier interior too.

The huge line in front of the restaurant all the time was what attracted me this place.  Something must be that good to have a line day in and day out.  So we walked in, signed up and sat in a crowded, dingy restaurant that seems to have been there for years.  Decor probably has not been changed or even repainted since they opened.  Not too impressed so far.   But the food was impressive.  We ordered the ramen with fried rice combo.  Yum!  Yes the ramen broth and cut pork is fatty but it is soooo good.  The fried rice with ramen broth was phenomenal.  I couldn't believe how fast I inhaled the food.  It could be that we did wait over an hour and was absolutely starving.   I only gave it a 4 stars because the decor and grease soaked walls seriously needs a make over.

absolutely yum!!!! after watching ramen girl last year(RIP brit) my cousin n i tried to look for the best ramen place n we stumbled in front of daikokuya! we were addicted the first time we went and we were so happy that we went for 3 days straight -_- it was during summer and sweating from the heat outside didnt phase us, just the fact that we needed extra tissue to wipe our sweat from both the heat n the soup was a lil extra work but it was way worth it!! went here 3weeks ago n we had the fried spicy tuna, i believe thats the name n oh man!! its was really different but oh so good, slightly crispy n just right... i think the best part of the ramen has to be the egg!! its not hard boiled to the max but the yellow part is like a medium well or so... once u eat that egg ull be stuffed!! haha i think its soy sauce marinated or something but its yumm!! my cousin gets his soup with all that extra back fat n he loves it but i just like it regular.. the noodles ar al dente n  perfecto n its just a real small joint that satisfies the ramen craving... this is prolly the closest im getting to ramen like in the ramen girl movie with the bar and all that but yes this place is my number 1!!! oh ps: make sure u write ur name down n ur whole party is there cuz they wont let u sit unless all of u are present ;]

I went there with my bf on Friday 6.30 pm. We were lucky to get a street parking spot a block away and paid $3 just to reach 8pm. If you were not so lucky, then there's a parking building across the street for $4 at night. We walked into the shop and found that you must write your name on the list yourself. The list was placed on a chair. Waiting was around 25 mins and we got 2 counter seats. Sitting there was great because we could see them cook. It's so exciting to see the chef cooking so fast almost like he was dancing! We can see boiling soup huge huge pot. I love when he was cooking fried rice, shaking the big pan up and down, and the rice was jumping beautifully. We ordered their signature ramen combo with shredded pork bowl to share. I read other review before and they said it would be enough for two. I was skeptical but it actually was enough...really enough. The salad came first, then the ramen with sharing bowl. The soup was thick and nice. We got extra pork (4 pieces for $2.50).  It's so soft with good amount of fat that melts in your mouth. Shredded pork bowl looked small but it's actually full of real good tender pork and sweet sauce. We ended up full and happy. The vibe is also what makes the place so unique. Their retro post-war japanese posters and signs are so cool. Your meal will be complimented with japanese waitress shouting the orders as the background music! We will go back again! This time with more friends and my foodie bro.

This is far better than the ramen place featured on Man vs Food.  Be prepared to wait.  We went on a Sunday around lunch and it was packed.  The wait was well worth it though.  The shredded pork bowl was amazing.  It reminds me of a dish my mother back in Indonesia used to make.  The Daikoku ramen was also very good.

Great ramen, reasonable price, long lines all the time. I have to admit the food at this place is awesome. The soup base of the ramen is so good. I also love their salad so much(the one that comes with the ramen in the combo), I don't know what secret they add to the dressing. Other food are okay too (like chicken/eel rice) but the ramen is unbeatable. With the fame of this place, I would say the price is reasonable. However, there's ALWAYS A LONG LINE and you ought to wait for at least 40+minutes...it's also hard to find a parking space near the restaurant because of the huge amount of people coming to this place... Anyways, i still love this place and I'm giving it a 4 star :)

How do you know when the noodles are good, by tasting the broth.  Its key, when it comes down to Ramen & this place sure do make a mean broth, better than the location in Hacienda Heights.  I prefer this original location, its ambience feels like your in Japan but not really haha. Hands down the best Ramen in town. If you come here during a chilly evening be sure to be patience bc some night there can be a line outside but all well worth it imo.

The wait for ramen is about 45 min to an hour usually, but no worries there, just put your name and walk about Little Tokyo. The food is well worth the wait. You will crave for the ramen broth for days to come, so beware. And the fried rice, omg, you will be speechless. You should do the ramen bowl with fried rice combo.

If I had to stand in the insane line that I saw every time I passed by, I would take a star out. But, since we walked in right when it opened, five stars. Literally, the moment our ass touch the seat, a line formed right away. And I could see why, like everyone said, the broth is perfect. Also, the place was as big as a Smart car. But, we had some kind of lunch special where you get a bowl of ramen and a mini bowl of beef katsu

Super long wait, but Super good Ramen. The broth is flavorful and not too greasy. I opted for the option of adding in more pork fat. GOOD Choice!! It was so large I couldn't finish it. I'm sure most guys would have no problem finishing it. The pork slices were thick, moist and flavorful, I couldn't help but slurp it up! Its unlike other places where the pork slices are dry and thin. I would wait in line for their ramen anytime!

I came here back in May with a few UCLA friends and tried their signature ramen as well as their pork belly over rice dish. Contrary to everything I've read and heard, the soup tasted rather bland to me and the pork belly tasted too salty. I have been to Japan 5 times and have also tried all of the highly recommended ramen restaurants in the SF and LA areas and this was the most mediocre of them. Definitely not BAD but also not WOW. Perhaps they were having an off day.. but my LA friends all said that it tasted typical of the restaurant. I will try Daikokuya again and update this review if I change my mind.

I ordered their special (ramen).  The ramen comes "al dente," not completely cooked all the way through, but slowly finishes cooking as you eat it.  Of course, the broth is what they're known for.  Amazing.  The best ever.  Worth the 2 hour wait for lunch on a Monday afternoon.  The only downside is space is extremely limited - just a few tables and a small bar to sit at.  You'll easily see the line out the door walking down 1st street for this restaurant.  You walk in, put your name on a list, and then they call the numbers sequentially.  Waiting ~25 numbers (#4 to #29) is about 2 hours.

(I went here about 2 months ago, but am still reminiscing about the broth and deep red color sashimi whenever I look at my pictures.) The broth is incredibly rich with flavor - deep pork flavor, that is. I'm not a huge fan of pork (but I LOVE bacon!) and although it was too porky for my liking, I appreciated the quality of the flavors and how it was prepared. The sashimi and the salad that also came with our set were both delicious. The reason I gave it a 4 stars and not a 5 is because of the fried spicy tuna appetizer we ordered. We each had 1 1/2 pieces and that was it. It was not tasty (maybe the fish was too dry? all the items together didn't make for a good tempura piece?) and there was too much other food to eat!

I love this place.   The first time I had it I think was actually the first time I've had Japanese style ramen, so I didn't really know what it was supposed to taste like.  It tasted a bit bland to me, but I ate it anyway. I've tried it at other places since then, and I have a better sense of what Japanese ramen is supposed to taste like.  I've been back, and the ramen at this place has been by far the best.  The broth, although a bit on the oily side, tastes so good with the noodles. Def worth the wait!

Went there on a Saturday evening around 530pm. Waited about 30 mins to get a booth. The wait is a lot shorter if you sit at the bar. Anyway, I ordered the ramen dish that they're known for and it did not disappoint. The pork broth was delicious. Not too oily at all. The noodles was just the right texture. I eat a lot and it was definitely filling. My girlfriend got the chicken teriyaki bowl and it was very good. The chicken skin was lightly glazed and fried, giving it a crispy crust and the chicken inside was nice and tender. The gyoza we had as an appetizer was okay. Nothing crazy about it. I will definitely be back. Worth the wait. Service was good also. Try to leave soon after you finish your meal. There are many others waiting to sit and eat. If you're just hanging out, be prepared to have eyes staring at you!

Update...its been 3 years since I was here last.  That's cuz I feel its morally unjustifiable to wait 40 minutes to get SEATED just to order ramen.  BS.  Behold the power of Jonathan Gold.  Ever since his review, this place seems to be a "must stop" for tourists visiting L.A. I got to beat the crowd when I decided to eat there at 5pm.  I only had to wait 15 minutes to get seated, and I felt like I won the lottery.  But I wasn't as wowed by the ramen as I once was.  Still pretty solid, and I originally wrote that it was better than Santouka on the west side.  I respectfully retract that statement.  Santouka is better.  Richer. I would still say Daikokuya is the best traditional pork ramen in lil tokyo.  Its hard to believe there is such a dearth of ramen places around there, at least places with traditional pork broths.  But there's no way its so good to warrant the lines.  Its just solid, but nothing more. If you wanna try some other ramen places, head over to chin-ma-ya in lil tokyo.  Really tasty, spicy ramen over there.  Or you can wait 40 minutes.

My wife and I never come to a new city without sampling a bowl of noodles. This place has excellent, rich broth, huge portions, and pretty good noodles. I'd suspect they buy the noodles, but it doesn't really matter as most ramen shops do. There was a line when our party of five got there, but it moved right along. I loved the decor and music. My four Japanese compadres were all humming along to fun, semi-dated J-hits playing in the background. And the antiquated ads and trinkets are well placed in this simple, unpretentious noodle heaven. Loved it.

The first time I had ramen here, my first reaction was that I could make the same thing with instant noodles! but then it got to me, this place give you a homie feeling sorta like kind feeling you get watching foreign Japanese movies. I would definitely recommend this Daikokuya in Lil. Tokyo, because its just not the same anywhere else!

Disclaimer: I didn't have the ramen, so this review is for what I did eat, the fried rice and the pork cutlet bowl. I came here for a late night meal after a drinks at Far Bar. I had ramen that afternoon so I was all ramen'd out (if that's possible). But I definitely wanted to eat here so I order the pork cutlet bowl. Who doesn't want fried goodness on rice after a night of drinking?! I was expecting crispy fried deliciousness on top a fluffy bowl of rice. But I was sadly surprised by the soggy mess I received. The pork was SOGGY and to top it off, they put an undercooked egg on it.  I love runny eggs, but this had runny egg whites! It was just gross. It turned me off to the whole dish. So I started to eat my bf's fried rice and I have to say, it was really really tasty. It hit the late night comfort food craving and the portions were big. I will definitely order this during my next visit. I say if you come here, stick to what they're famous for, the ramen. I can't wait to finally try it!

I've been going to Daikokuya since they've opened and I'm sad to say that the ramen there is no longer edible.   The broth is inconsistent, my last time there being too salty with absolutely no depth or complexity in the soup.   My hanjyuku tamago was alright, but my friends was completely cooked through.  The noodles were not cooked with care and few strands were clumped together, completely unacceptable.

I guess it depends on yer taste. Orochon is way better in my opinion but this place is okay. The egg and pork's a little gross but just don't put it in if you don't want it. Not bad.

I was here last summer on a weekday with the boyfriend and some friends. We were craving ramen and this place was top rated and had the most reviews on yelp. So we thought sure why not give it a try? When we got here of course there was a wait -- 30-45min I believe. The restaurant is pretty small and most people waiting were standing outside. Not sure if there was a hostess or not but we had to write our own names down on the waiting list. This place is awesome! The wait was totally worth it. I had the daikoku ramen and he had the daikoku ramen combination with the tuna sashimi bowl. Delicious!! Even though it got really busy, the server still tried to come by as much as they could to see if we needed anything. This place is definitely a must try if you're ever in the area! We can't wait to go back and stuff our face with ramen!!

Wow, this place has more than 3000 reviews by numerous yelpers. Here it is, their ramen is one of the best I've ever had in LA area because it's miso broth ramen tasty, noodle is not soggy, and pork, egg, bean sprout goes well with the broth whenever I order my ramen hete many times. plus, pork for ramen side menu melts in my mouth. Service here is not bad.The reason why I did not give five star is that this place does not accept credit card, it's cash ONLY.

I took a friend here for a late dinner after we volunteered for an event.  She never had ramen before (Top Ramen doesn't count) and since Little Tokyo was nearby, we took the opportunity.  While we wait in line for about an hour (it was about 11pm), we were looking at the menu to see what we can get.  To be honest, I was a little disappointed at first because of the ramen selection, or should I say "lack" of it.  I was expecting something similar to Ramenya where there are literally over 2 dozen kinds of ramen.  After all, they do call themselves the "original noodle & rice-bowl."  We both got the Daikoku Ramen (tonkotsu) and they were fabulous.  I can't compare them to Ramenya because their broths are like day and night.  The noodles were made to just right and the chashu pork was so soft, it practically melts in your mouth.  I was beyond satisfied after our meal.  As for my friend, well... she's been craving good ramen since then because Top Ramen has not tasted the same ever since.

it's true this place is awesome.  they only have one type of ramen, which i think is good - fast service and fast turnover.  i always get a small bowl of ramen and a side of katsudon. awesome. this place gets five stars because it is awesome, and it's crowded, but they do a good job of getting people in and out so you don't have to wait forever... most of the time.

Looking for the best ramen around town and heard from a few people that this place was one of them.  Yelped it, and read all the good and not-so good reviews. Unfortunately, this place falls on the not so good review  :(  This Ramen place is All hype and for me, Orochan Ramen is way better period. The ramen was meh -- broth was missing flavor, the noodles were so-so.  The place was small and it's seems to be always crowded so expect to wait at least 30 minutes or more. The service is mediocre, like the servers here don't even want to serve you at all. Rice bowls were okay but I don't think there's anything special about them.  Needless to say, we didn't even finish our food, which is unusual for us, didn't even bother with a to-go box. Not sure why this place is popular, maybe we had a bad batch of food or something but from looking at the table next to us, they didn't finish their food as well. I'm definitely not coming back here. For me, The food here is not worth waiting in line for. And for the curious folks, this place is cash only.

Hands down, my favorite ramen place.  No fancy menu, no customizations, no bajillion choices for broths, flavor, etc.  Just plain old good ramen.  Always a line for this place, even at midnight.  This was great for leaving a club or bar early and grabbing a midnight snack (they have half bowls!)  They'll seat you no matter what if you get there before 1am.  Consistent and never disappoints.

The ramen (don't get the crazy fatty one if it's your first time, it's a bit too rich) combo with fried rice. Cover the fried rice with sriracha and dip it in the broth while you're simultaneously eating all of the noodles and tender pork. And repeat. The wait is ridiculous, but that's to be expected. Just be wary of your call number and walk around the street a bit-- there's some cool shops on either side with fun things to look at or nice treats with which to ruin your appetite :)

I've been meaning to go here for so long, I was really excited that I finally got to try it out for lunch today. I ordered the combo with ramen and a small shredded pork bowl. It came with a little side salad that was awesome...I could have eaten just that and been totally satisfied. I don't know what I was expecting from the ramen, but it didn't really live up to everything I've heard. It was good, no doubt about that. I liked that the noodles were cooked a little firmer, but the flavor just didn't WOW my taste buds. The shredded pork bowl though? AMAZING!! It was sooo good. Grilled pork belly, shredded on top of rice with green onion, pickled ginger and a sweet sauce...I was in pork lover's heaven. I could eat that every day for the rest of my life and be happy. I wish I had gotten a large one as my entree. It ended up being soooo much food, I didn't really make a dent in my ramen. Next time, I'm ordering just a large shredded pork bowl.

Seriously?!  NO!  I'm not sure what ramen people have been eating to give this such a high review, but this was the biggest disappointment.  The wait for this place is ridiculous, I mean if it were amazing then fine I'm happy to wait upwards of an hour.  But no, it wasn't amazing, it wasn't even good in my opinion.  First the soup tasted watered down, not flavorful at all, the fried rice was soggy and lacked flavor as well, but the biggest no-no was that the egg in the ramen was so over cooked only a little bit of the center was runny....my husband and I basically got a hard boiled egg.  We ate about 10 bites of our ramen and decided to leave our stomach for something better.  Orenchi in Santa Clara is leaps and bounds better as are a couple of other places in San Mateo.  I think I saw a reviewer say this was the best ramen they've ever had, even in Japan...lies all lies.  I've had quite a few bowls of ramen in Japan and obviously these people have only been to the crappy ones.  Don't waste your time with this place!

We were going to the awesome "Art in the Streets" show at MOCA and were looking around for a place to have lunch.  We were drawn to Daikokuya because of the long line outside of the place.  After putting our name down we wandered around for about 30 minutes and got some excellent Pork Buns at Yamazaki nearby to tide us over.  Perfect timing to get back in time to be seated.   I always get a bit nervous when a restaurant has only a B health grade, but I also know that it could be some relatively small point and figured that they have such a huge turnover that whatever they have there wont kill me. Anyway, I am majorly into Ramen and I have to say that the broth for the Ramen here was amazingly good.  It was rich and complex (although it could have been a bit hotter).  The ramen noodles themselves were the right amount of chewy and springy.  Definitely a very good bowl.  Not so impressed with the pork that was included as it seemed it gave its all for the broth and was nothing more than a stingy bit of meat attached to a lot of fat.   We also got some Gyoza which were quite respectable and a nice assortment of pickled vegetables.   The place is hopping and the service is fast efficient and friendly.  Definitely a good place to go if you are in the neighborhood, but probably not worth the trip on its own merits.

Hands down, the best heavy ramen broth in the greater LA area.  Noodles and extras are excellent as well, but it's the broth that separates it from the rest.   Add a few dollars for the combo if you're feeling hungry (or want leftovers): you get salad and can choose among a variety of sides, such as the chicken/egg bowl, shredded pork, and fried rice, which are all good. There's almost always a line here, and on peak nights it can be a very long wait.  Parking is also sometimes a pain.  However, it's really worth it. Overall, highly recommended.  Even after making a ramen tour in Tokyo, I feel that Daikokuya holds its own.

Daikokuya - along with Santouka - tops my list of favorite ramen places in California. The sole choice at this joint is its Daikoku ramen. Not that it matters... even if they had other options, I'd probably still get this again and again. Every bite is incredibly flavorful, it should be illegal! You can choose to have it served assari or kotteri style soup broth, the latter making it extra rich and sinful. The noodles have a nice chewy texture as well. It comes with chasu, bamboo, green onions, and an egg. Chasu was excellent, very juicy and tender. The depth and flavor of the egg was incredible! The best thing to get at Daikokuya are the combination sets. It comes with a full size bowl of the Daikoku ramen plus your choice of a good sized side bowl - oyakodon, shredded pork bowl, ikura don, fried rice, unagi don, etc. I've tried the oyakodon, shredded pork bowl, and fried rice, and have enjoyed all of them. It's a great value, IMO! Absolutely love this place!

I've been to Daikokuya about 3 or 4 times and I'm coming back for more.  It is the best ramen I've tasted so far and it is probably the best ever.  Most of the time there is a long waiting list but I don't mind because I walk around the plaza then come back.  Lately though considering the weather, it's been really hot inside.  If you sit at the counter it would be hotter considering all the boiling pot, etc.  The service is decent, decor is interesting and the crowd is on the younger side.  The portions of pork is super tender and tasty (2 pieces).  The broth is just perfect and the ramen noodles just as good.  The ramen comes with egg, sprouts, and a lot of chopped green onions.  The bowl of ramen is definitely a masterpiece.  After being there, I would make it a routine to go back at least once or twice a month.  -Alfred

oh, it's good. the chewy/barely crunchy noodles immersed in a oily broth. topped with a slice of pork and eggs. and then laced with crack. it's really good crack. there's always a waiting list but i think it makes the food better as it heightens my anticipation and it doesn't let down. in the meantime, you can stand outside and watch all the white people walk by for their weekend dosage of "culture night" and later go tell their friends they went to little tokyo and ate "really good japanese food" when in reality they just had some teriyaki chicken because "raw fish smells funny." anyways, food is good and i feel heavy afterwards, but not the chinese food kind of heavy. i think it's called contentment as opposed to overindulgence.

Hands down the best ramen place in Los Angeles. The broth is rich, noodles are fresh and never overcooked. The Gyoza is also some of the best Japanese style Gyoza ive ever had (i usually prefer Shanghai style dumplings). The only problem is the wait- no matter how many people i bring, i always have to wait for a table. But, as long as you flag down a server, the service is  fast.

Hands down best ramen ever! I've tried many many MANY ramen places, not just in socal either, but also in Seattle, Shanghai (China), and Japan! They definitely have the best ramen I've ever tasted. Of course, I didn't have the best ramen that Japan has to offer, so I can't compare it to those. The menu's not huge. The prefer to excel at the dishes they offer instead of offering everything mediocre. The ramen soup is soo creamy. They definitely don't skimp on the quality. And it's topped with a lot of green onions, adding to the flavor. Though, I think the reason why it's so creamy is cuz there's more fat in the soup base so I wouldn't have it quite as often as I would like. Maybe on a day when I feel like splurging or satisfying an intense hunger. The interior is a bit small and cramped. And old. But if they made the restaurant any bigger, I'm afraid the quality of the food might go down so I'd rather it remain the way it is.

My friend recommended this place as one of the must-try's.  I was going to be in the area that night, so I decided to try it. I'm sure it was probably really good ramen, although I didn't get a chance to try it - my boyfriend practically inhaled it! (Thanks!) So I probably picked a really bad day to go thus putting me in a bad mood, so I'll probably edit this later and bump it up a star the next time I go back to J-Town.  It was the day of the Prop 8 protests and all the streets were closed and I had to drive around for at least an extra 30 minutes (after an hour in traffic coming from Walnut). You have to park across the street at the mall's (or plaza's) lower-level parking. It was a pretty hot day, so I was hoping for air conditioning. Walked in on a Saturday around almost 2ish and had to wait 30 minutes.  When we finally got notified they asked us if booth was okay. I was starving, so I said yes, absolutely!  Bad idea - we sat right in front of the giant boiling pot of soup.  It just wasn't my day. So instead of being smart and ordering delicious ramen like my boyfriend and my other friends recommended, I went with the hot weather and ordered a nice, sashimi-style tuna rice bowl.  Tuna was absolutely fresh, but it was just a really big bowl of rice and tuna on top. Nothing special. If I'm ever in J-town again, I'll consider coming back here to try the delicious ramen my boyfriend inhaled. (Thanks again for not letting me try it, buddy.) Only if there's no protests/rallies, it's cold out, and I get a table next time.

I hate Daikokuya because they've ruined ramen for me forever.  I cannot go anywhere else for ramen b/c all I think is "what a poor substitute for Daikokuya."   I'm now a Daikokuya addict and whenever I have a craving for ramen I can only go there and have to drive the long ways and wait in that long line.  Or eat at some ungodly hour b/c I'm unwilling to wait.  Either way, it's totally worth it and hands down the best ramen I've ever had.

There are other Ramen shops along the same street in Little Tokyo but this ones has a queue, despite other shops being quite empty when we last visited. We waited 45mins to an hour for a table of 4 persons on a Sunday evening. You put down your name and no of people on a list yourself at the entrance. When there is table, they will go down the list and call you. I love the chewy noodle and the tasty rich collagen pork broth that is boiled for hours. We tried the Daikoku Ramen (soup version) & Tsukemen dry version, both is very good. The dry version has the soup and noodle toppings served separately. The boiled egg are done with the yolk runny like in Japaness shop. The appetizer were good too, we tried kurobuta  pork sausage, & tsukemono (pickle). The pickle is colour coordinated and arranged nicely. We also tried the Tempura rice bowl and Chicken Teriyaki which are tasty & well marinated. See photos for the actual items tried. Prices are reasonable for the portion served. Appetizer range from US$3 for cucumber roll to US$5.95 for gyoza. Ramen at US$8.50 for either the soup or dry version.  3 items for bento box is US$12.95. You can also have Daikuko Ramen with small combination rice bowl from US$10.95 ( fried rice) to US$12.95 (teriyaki eel bowl). Take note once the broth is sold out early, they will closed shop.

This is a cozy spot across the street from the village.  What I liked most was the broth is simmering on the stove right up front at the bar.  It reminds me of a story my grandfather told me when I was a kid. The ramen noodles were excellent.  Someone commented on the texture perfection, and I agree that it's texture is remarkable.  The difference between cooked too much and not enough can be measured in seconds, and these guys nail it every time.   The broth.  It's bland compared other asian broths, but authentically it was what it's supposed to be.  When I first took a sip of it, I felt like it was missing something.  Then the shredded pork showed up, that sealed the deal.  The combination of the more rich flavored rice bowl with ginger on top was like confetti on new years eve.   The people I know like to factor in service to a meal, and they go so far as making it the reason to go out.   I don't really mind that sort of thing, but within 10 seconds of deciding what I wanted to order, the waitress walked up and asked me if I've decided.  Moments later, my drink arrives, a few minuets later the Ramen, and the Shredded Pork arrived before I finished my second mouthful of noodles.  Came out to $14 for the combo and drink, left a $20.  The timing was so perfect, I could swear it was rehearsed. All in all, it was just a damn good bowl of Ramen, and a side of Shredded Pork was the exact amount of flavor.  An ordinary meal made extraordinary by talented people.  I just ate like an hour ago, and I'm already craving it again.

Daikokuya is the restaurant that I will make the drive from Eagle Rock to Little Tokyo for, on a work night when I've already spent an hour in traffic coming home. If I'm jonesing for the ramen, I will make it happen. I have to say though, this place gets BU-SY. Maybe 3 times out of 10 if I'm too hungry, or not in the mood for the up close and personal human contact, I won't wait and I'll head over to Koraku instead. Much more relaxed environment, more personal space, really good green iced tea too.

I am no expert at ramen.  That being said, every time I'm anywhere near little Tokyo in LA I have to find a noodle restaurant.  Daikokuya is a cool little place that is always crowded.  I usually go by myself so there's room at the bar where you also get an up close view of the cooks doing their magic.  I do have to recommend you get the salad with the ramen.  You will not be disappointed.  I really can't describe the flavors of the food but you will like all of it.  Try it out if you get a chance!

THE place to go for ramyun. Their fried rice is pretty dang good too so if you're super hungry I'd recommend the Ramyun + Fried rice combo. And to top that off you can also get a glass of Kirin beer for $2. I'm not sure if they upped the price on that but the last time I went it was for $2.

This place is disgusting. An absolute shit box. Sit at the bar beside the wall and you'll notice this old grease covered gas tank of some sort with the wall just underneath looking like its about to give birth to some alien creature...the wait! every time...Ive waited outside for 35 minutes at 11:15pm on a Wednesday for a spot for 1 at the bar!... ...I've been here 4 times and ordered the ramen every time...and every time, my insides are a mess for an entire day....with all this being said: I DON'T CARE!!!!! the broth that makes up the ramen is the most deliciously tasting item I have ever consumed. It is dense, thick, rich, creamy, salty...just gluttonous goodness...You can tell they really go to crazy lengths to make it taste so rich.... I dont know how people order more food than the ramen bowl. it is massive. but i see them do it. house salad, rice bowl and the ramen...the ramen is a monster. and you are left wanting to slurp up every last drop.... My next time back I will try something else off the menu...But the ramen is legitimately the most delicious liquid meal you can ever have...I'd go almost as far as saying anywhere on planet earth!

I tell you what I waited to be seated for about a hour or so,BUT you can make a reservation and walk around the Little Tokyo Plaza to kill some time. It was second time trying a ramen place so I ordered the ramen+fried rice combo CHEYEAHH. We could have went to the one in COSTA MESA which was MUCH CLOSER and BLAH BLAH but in the end it was well worth it to see the little tokyo plaza once again and to eat at a true LEGIT ramen place. lol but for the gas wise ima try to go to the costa mesa one .. not the one in LA. LOL overall 5 star for the taste and service. be prepared to wait in line on weekends!

This is the best ramen house in the world! I can't say enough good things about the yummy goodness that permeates from this small hole-in-the-wall establishment.   The only downfall is that you always have to wait 30-45 minutes for a seat.   I recommend the standard house ramen - so far it's the best thing there.  The pork fried rice isn't too bad either.

One of the best Ramen I've ever had. Tender Pork slices in a creamy broth, yum...those unforgettable tender pork pieces with just the right amount of fat. The hard-boiled egg in the soup was cooked perfectly, the yolk is almost like a paste and not solid dry. We got there at 3 pm today (Sunday) when there were only 3 groups ahead of us and we waited for  less than 20 min. The line is usually a lot longer during lunch or dinner hours on weekends.

I'll keep this short, since there's hundreds of reviews for Daikokuya. And I'm sure I'll be repeating what others have already said.. As a testament to how amazing Daikokuya Ramen is, a few years ago I visited three separate times over one week. That's extremely rare for me. Pros: broth, perfectly cooked noodles, berkshire pork, flavored egg.. (am I just listing the ingredients for ramen? lol..), fried rice is really tasty, gyoza is delicious, and the iced tea is very good. Additional Notes: + Huge crowds equal long wait. + Space is small, just a few tables and a bar. But it adds to the charm. + Plenty of things to do while you wait or after you eat, e.g. anime store next door, J-town plaza across the street, liquor store a few steps adjacent (where you can giggle staring at J-porn.) + Parking is structure, so it can be expensive to a certain extent (unless you find street metered parking.)

Love love love this place. Best Ramen in Los Angeles!!! I usually get their daikoku ramen with the richer kotteri flavor (the fatty one) option. The soup is excellent,  the ramen is chewy (in a good way) and the egg is perfectly cooked!! The fried rice was pretty good too. Love love love daikokuya. My only complain is their looooong line. It is at least a 30 min wait each time. Not only that...you have to wait there at all times. Otherwise if they call your name and you are not there, they cross out your name and you have to start over.   Daikokuya owners...you need to expand this place and provide more seats for people. ^____^

sugoi desu ne  (it is awesome)!  well porky-awesomeness to be exact! Being from Hawai'i  where saimin/ramen is almost finely crafted into an art, it's hard to find really good ramen in CA... but this place is THE BEST (and trust me, I've been looking). The noodles, soup, and pork is a masterful mix of flavors and textures.  if you like pork... this place is the place to go!  the shredded pork bowl is sweet, savory, delicious, with crispy/fatty pork pieces.  And the pork in the ramen, is like butter! However, since there is no reservations and the place has limited seating, you may be waiting for a while, but its so worth it.

I know my review is one of hundreds here, but as a Norcal-er who made a weekend trip down to visit friends and frequented some of the more famous food places in LA, this was definitely at the top and worth yelping about. (Little Tokyo, which is one street over and practically adjacent, is a nice place to check out too) Despite all the not-so-great things that might have dampened my experience, like waiting 1.5 hours to get seated, getting called while my friends and I were passing time in Little Tokyo and almost losing our spot on the waitlist, I really enjoyed my lunch there. I got ramen, and I loved it. Service was fast and efficient, which made up for the time spent waiting for a seat. And I have to say, I really loved the environment, aka the hustle and bustle, the aroma of the ramen while waiting for the food to come, and hearing familiar old school Japanese pop songs. I can't give more details; I don't even remember the name of the ramen I ordered, but I had a great experience here :)

Inexpensive, delicious, and totally worth the wait.  One of the best ramen places I've eaten at.  Noodles cooked to your liking (firm or soft), cha shu melts in your mouth, and the broth is SUPER tasty.  Health conscious people beware!!!  You can even request extra back fat to be added to your soup =).   Recommended Items: Daikokuya Ramen Sliced Roast Pork Pork Fried Rice

I am not so big on ramen, but the pork base here means I end up eating twice as much ramen as I have ever anywhere outside of Japan. My go-to is the katsu don. If you're not too hungry, one person can get the ramen set that comes with a small rice entree bowl and it's just enough for a meal. Definitely a steal for the $4 extra.

Despite the long wait, I thought it was worth it. We ordered the ramen with the pork fat which made the broth so much tastier and better than the ones I've tried in Japan. I never liked Ramen just because it always tasted like instant noodles to me. But so far, this place has proved me wrong! :)

They only lost a star because of the wait.   I brought my friend with me, and he HATES to wait for anything but decided to on my request.  He also always over-orders.   So, as usual we left the restaurant sick full...   The noodle soup is AMAZING and definitely worth the wait.  I recommend getting a combination just for the salad that comes with it.   Not because you need to get anything more to be full than the noodle soup. I went back with the same friend within a month.  So if he's willing to wait twice- the food must be that amazing.   The fact that it's relatively inexpensive is also a plus!

Who's the weenie that gave this place a 1 star?  Must be a tourist.  Anyways.  Hands down, THE BEST RAMEN HOUSE IN LA.  The Daikoku Ramen is to die for. I've never had pork that literally melt in your mouth until I ate here.  The broth is killer too.  Perfectly complements the noodle and all the ingredients.  Most broth are either too salty or too limp. Not here. And the portions exceed my expectations.  I am a customer for life.

usually the type of ramen I enjoy comes in a cup and I dress it up with ton of tapatio and lemon, so when my friend told me that we should hit up Daikokuya for some ramen I was skeptical at best. When we arrived there was a bit of a wait (about 15 minutes), I'm telling you this was well worth the wait, I ended up ordering the bowl of noodles and fell in love with it instantly! The egg, bacon and noodles all complimented each other perfectly. I would definitely be returning to this place again

Another entry my LA road trip food adventure. From Chicken and Waffles to Sushi. Its time for Ramen. My friend who's a big foodie recommended the place and told me to get there early for THE BEST Ramen he's ever had. That's coming from someone who travels alot. Sooo we arrive to a small building with a line that resembles a night club. Jolt our name on the list and kill time at the Anime shop, then listen to my friend trying to convince his girlfriend over the phone to wear one of the school girl outfits that he wants to buy. Unfortunately he failed, buttttt that killed enough time for us to get seated. We squeeze into the bar counter and order the Katsu combo. After a few minutes, it promptly arrives. all hot and steamy. I look over the murky dark broth, inhale the wonderful aroma and prepare for sample this ramen i've been waiting for 30 minutes for. I grab a spoonful of broth and take a sip....and wow that is awesome. This coming from a guy who will drink gravy. Its all rich, savory, and full of pork flavor. If they bottled this up, i would be the first to buy it. The noodles were spot on. It has the right amount of tenderness, shape and Constancy. Its definitely not like the time you let your 'Mama noodles' (Asian reference) sit too long. Pork slices were good, just a little fatty, but i like that. And tasted just like the broth.The pickled radishes and ginger were nice, as well as the condiments. But oh man, the broth...can't forget it. I made sure i didn't leave any behind. Using a straw to get it all outweighs the awkward looks from people Overall I highly recommend it. Many Thumbs up!

This is best place to go to in Los Angeles for ramen. Sadly there is always a wait to go inside. Make sure you set aside minimum 30 minutes to get seated. The place is small and can only accommodate a few people so there is almost always a wait. However, the wait is well-warranted because the food inside is amazing! Get the daikoku ramen + fried rice combo. It is only $12 bucks and you are guaranteed to leave satisfied and more than likely very, very full. 5 Stars!

After hearing this place did tonkotsu ramen, which apparently isn't nearly as popular in LA as it is in Kyushu, I was pretty excited to try Daikokuya. The wait was a bit too long, but the restaurant itself was encouraging and seemed pretty authentic. Sat down, ordered the ramen extra strong, and... meh. I've had a lot better. Luckily I later discovered that you can get something a lot closer to a proper bowl of tonkotsu ramen at Shinsengumi. I don't really get why people bother with tonkotsu if you're not going to go all out. I would have rated this higher, thinking that this is as good as it's going to get in LA, but luckily I was wrong. Maybe this would be a good introduction before trying the real thing?

The wait was long and if you are a ramen fan than it is definitely worth it.  I am not the biggest ramen fan, but I thought it was a lot of food for the price and I liked that I could get it deconstructed.

I read all of these reviews and knew I had to try it when I came to LA. It was definitely worth it, the salad was amazing followed by the extremely flavorful fried rice and daikoku ramen. Definitely have to try the japanese fried rice, much better than any other place I've tried. If you aren't hungry enough to eat a horse, I suggest not order the combination plates as you'll never be able to finish it. I could have swam in all the soup that I couldn't finish. The ramen was huge and tasty, I literally had mouthgasm. Be sure to avoid lunch/dinner rush hours or go on weekdays otherwise you'll will have a long wait.

Apparently, this is THE ramen place to go to in downtown LA.  I can't begin to tell you how many times I've attempted to come here, but the wait was too long.  Once with my mom, we were in the area and I said we should get some ramen, but line was way too long and my mom didn't want to wait so we settle for a place next door...terrible.  Then the end of last year I was on a loan for work to a building right down the street.  I walked to this place at odd hours during the day to try to catch a down time but..there was no down time.  EVER.  so it's been built up for awhile the anticipation for the ramen.  So I finally made it here over the weekend, and the wait was only 20 minutes.  Not too bad.  This place is small and dirty.  I guess they're not so concerned with their decor since they have already established their clientale. hm.  My BF commented on the cloth banner they hang over the door and you hold it back to walk it.  It was pretty dirty. haha.  Since the place is super small, we had a party of 6 and we had to squeeze into a booth for 4.  It was really squished and awkward.  Not a great place for groups.  4 or less! No more!  They have a pretty small menu, ordered their signature ramen (there isn't much else).. got my ramen, tasted it and...eh.  Not the fantasticness that I was expecting in my mouth.  I've had better ramen in Torrance.  This is what I've been anticipating?? pretty anti-climatic.  :( and then, my friend finds a strand of hair in his bowl of ramen.  double :(  guhhhhhhh.

went on a saturday around 2:30 with two of my children, and waited an hour.... not to bad considering there were 20 parties before us. i had noticed a "B" rating in the window after about 45 minutes of waiting, but didn't think much more about it because, come hell or high water, i was going to eat. the waiting area was small, but sufficed, and there was a cool manga library to suck up time. we were eventually seated in the back, near the restroom, which i only mention because there was a slope on the floor and it was slippery- probably a cross between steam and oil on the floor. About every five minutes someone would come sliding by like snaggle-puss....."exit, stage right"  much to my amusement. the service kicked ass, the ramen was great, and the whole vibe was really cool. i'm in.

This is a very casual hole-in-the-wall type ramen place that is always packed and always has a wait for lunch.  I've been here for lunch for only two occasions, 4 yrs apart, and the restaurant has stayed exactly the same!  I've had the kotteri broth ramen with chashu, and the broth is really flavorful and just well made.  The day I went recently with my friend, well... let's just say I sat there, completely sweating and marinating in my own juices like a chashu pork, my bangs completely matted down to my face and with no hope for cooling down, so I ordered the tsukemen.  This is better for a hot day because they don't really have AC, and its the same broth, but separate, like a deconstructed bowl of ramen.  The noodles, broth, egg, chashu, are all separate and you dip everything as you please. This probably also keeps you from drinking pork fat broth, ladies and gentlemen, so a little less jelly on your belly.  Either way, looove love love the ramen here!!!  Remember that the wait will be about 45 minutes, realistically.

I've heard great things about this place and decided to come here for linner after a Clipper game. And I've heard terrible things about the wait but I've also been told it's worth it. The place was still packed even at the odd hours of 4PM and we put our names down on the waiting list and ended up getting a table 40 minutes later. We had  table at the end, near where several people were waiting, and felt pressured to eat faster and leave. In addition, the crowded waiting space near our table was a bit suffocating and almost felt invasive, and I don't know about you, but I like my space and comfort when eating. Anyway, as for the food, I got the ramen combo with the fried rice side. Their cabbage salad is to die for. For all the different styles of Asian fried rice, my rankings are: Japanese - Chinese - Korean - Vietnamese. Their fried rice definitely reinforced that perspective; really delicious, especially with the ramen soup. Not the biggest fan of pork belly, their broth-infused meat was surprisingly good, and being a fan of green onions, the ample amount of which was quite satisfying. The soup was great, nothing like I've ever tasted before, but my main gripe was with the noodles. Nice texture, but ultimately tasteless and bland. My cousin, who I went with, found it strange as he claims that during his past visits, the soup was more well-seasoned and that the noodles actually had flavor. Perhaps it was a one-time occasion, but the bland noodles coupled with a compromised comfort zone elicit my 3 star rating (if I could, I'd give it 3 1/2 stars).

I grew up in Hawaii around Japanese culture and authentic noodle houses.  DK's as we like to call Daikokuya is some deep flavors of love.  It doesn't have that we just threw it together a few minutes ago taste.  All the ingredients stand out on their own.  The gyoza is super temp hot at first bite so let it sit in the sauce for a few minutes and pop in your mouth.  When the noodle bowl comes, and I usually order the house ramen, then after a quick taste of the soup it's time to load up the two spoons of garlic paste, spicy fixins, and get the party started.  Whew!  You've gotta have a solid relationship with your date, because your breath, no matter what you try, is gonna be DK fresh all night baby.  Don't have anything major planned afterward either, reminds me of the plate lunch place back home called Masa's who's motto was, "Eat til' you sleep!"

This is my favorite ramen place. Looks like an old back alley ramen shop you would find in japan. Tight spaced, dimly lighted, steamy windows and crowded.

Daikokuya Ramen is a place for fans only. The food is extremely fatty and is literaly made from pig fat, so if you eat healthy this place isn't for you. If you come here only come for the ramen with added koterri flavor. The rest of the food is pretty average. I simply love the food, but the restuarant is quite hot and stuffy. FYI on a Friday Night you may have to wait about 1-2 hours to get in, because they don't take reservations and you do have to wait.

the ramen was good the first time, but only ok the second. 1st time here: my friend and i waited for an hour, and were ravenous when we were finally seated. the decor is kind of kitschy, but i liked it. not the cleanest joint, but i think that's b/c the place is ALWAYS so packed that they have little time to clean; it's all about fast customer turnover, you gotta sympathize a little. i think that hour of waiting heightened our hunger, which made the pork ramen SO tasty. the soup was like butter--so creamy and rich and flavorful, and salty savory. my friend, who normally hates pork, got his arm twisted by me to come here, and he really loved the ramen. i liked the egg too---very creamy, i wish they put two of them in the ramen. we also had the gyoza, which were fresh and crispy on the ouside and juicy tender on the inside; the best gyoza i've had in the U.S. 2nd time here: although we waited for a good 40 minutes, and were hungry, the ramen was nowhere near as good as before. the broth was still rich, but was not exceptional---felt more oily than before, more clog your arteries fatty. the egg however was still excellent. i took away stars for the ridiculously long wait---this is definitely ramen you should try at least once, but no way i'm going to wait this long for ramen again---the somewhat unclean dining area, and the inconsistency of the ramen. i would go back here though (love that egg and gyoza), but only if i were sure that i wouldn't have to wait longer than 20 minutes to get in.

Love this place. Still my favorite goto Ramen joint since I don't live in the South Bay(I hear there's some great Ramen there). BUT,  I'm pretty sure they don't open at 9AM on Sundays as listed here on Yelp :).  Their website says 12am for sundays, just a heads up for those of you craving ramen early Sunday morning.  Great kurobata here, and the spicy tuna rolls are always fresh.  But the Ramen is the thing!

Daikokuya has the best ramen in LA. Although their menu has a few other things(tasty too) you go there for the ramen. It doesn't get old either, the month before i moved to Boston, i ate at Daikokuya 3 nights a week. $12 will get you a bowl of ramen too big to finish, a small salad with onion dressing, and delicious pork fried rice. That is my usual order, but their tonkatsu is better than at most places, and if the ramen bores you order the tsukemen (the ramen broth with chilled noodles and broiled pork on the side) The down side to Daikokuya is that it is really popular. A party of 2 will be seated in 15-20 minutes, but if your party is larger than 4 you will wait over an hour(happened to me 3 times...and i waited) My favorite part, OPEN LATE! If you are worried about sanitation, their grade bumped up to a B(i ate their a lot while they had a C and never got sick)

I come here atleast twice a month.  This is the best ramen restaurant so far.  Love their extra thick soup called "kotteri" with extra noodles. Pros:  Thick soup, the meat is tender Cons:  The waiting list can be an hour long, parking also sucks Overall:  It's worth the wait... :)

Went to this place last night. I was enjoying my noodles, until I found a fat fly in pork...yuck. I sent it back and requested to change my order to the fried rice, as I was eating my rice I bit into a piece of broken ceramic... it seemed like it was from the big ramen bowls they use... I'm not a complainer so I didn't send that back, I just won't ever go back.

went there with my sister because we heard it was popular. we waited there for ever a Saturday night. Seating was very poor. We  I had to sit at the counter. I had my coat and her purse on my lap while eating. That really sucks. I mean if you are out of capacity, dont let people in. What good does it do if you make money as a busines and then you go home and talk shit and never go back. That sucks.

There's a reason why this place always have long lines no matter which day of the week. This place by far is my favorite place for ramen, and by far, the best place for Ramen!  Ramen here is so good -- the portions are big and prices are cheap.  I look always look forward to summer because during the summer months, they have this special cold ramen that's like a salad.  It's so good!  Their signature ramen is also very good and always hits the spot on a cold day.  Definitely worth the wait in the line!

Full disclosure: this review applies only to the ramen because I can't imagine ever ordering anything else. You're deluded if you think you can make something this good at home. I don't live in LA anymore and have searched far and wide for broth that is as rich and delicious, pork that will melt in my mouth (seriously!) in the same way,  eggs that are as thoroughly brined (all the way to the creamy yolk!) and noodles that are as good at soaking up the ramen-y, pork-y goodness. So far I have yet to find it. I find other places go overboard on the seasonings to cover up the fact that their ramen isn't nearly as good. I'd rather add my own spice and revel in the pure flavor if I choose. Completely worth an hour wait. The main drawbacks are that the place is tiny, sometimes pretty hot (the ramen is cooking right there, what do you expect?), and the cravings that will ensue. Do not attempt if you do not live nearby!

I couldn't wait to get here after reading all of the ramen reviews. Can someone please tell me what on earth they were talking about? Though our wait was fairly short the soup was served lukewarm. The broth was ok at best. The shredded pork bowl was pretty good the gyoza were nothing to write home about and the fried rice was ok. What really ruined this for me was an ill-fated trip to the restroom. Come on people, how long does it take to clean a restroom. I am still not over it! It was one of the nastiest dirtiest restrooms I have ever been in, gas stations included....I  have felt nauseous ever since. I will NEVER go back.

I used to go to this restaurant often. But since they have raised the price, I stopped going there any more. I went to Daikokuya today for lunch because my friend wanted to go. The soup and noodle tasted good but their pork was very thinly sliced and was almost 80% fat. The waitresses were very rude to me. They thought I didn't understand their language but I did. I won't be back unless someone asks me to go with them again.

You know a restaurant is good when there is a line forming before it opens.  So my friends and I decide to here on a Saturday for lunch; we got there well before this place opened (knowing they are always crowded) and there was a line forming right in front of the place.  We insisted on waiting in line and eventually got in after the first patch of satisfying customers left.  I ordered an eel bowl instead of the ramen.  Although a bit pricey, it is worth every penny.  The eel bowl also came with the most delicious side salad ever, a bowl of shredded lettuce with perfectly complimenting concoction of dressing, sweet, tangy and creamy in every bite or veggies.  Now on to the eel bowl,  on top of a bed of rice, a mountain of eel in some eel sauce.  They made sure I got a bite of eel with every bite of rice.  For people who are not fond of seafood, there's Daikokuya's famous rich pork bone ramen, fried rice, and sashimi bowl.  Even though the food is good, the place is tin, packed, and HOT.  I guess they're trying to have this authentic Japanese steamy restaurant ramen atmosphere...BUT with good food, I don't think most people even notice these flaws. -Out of Five- Revisit value- 5 Taste-5 Satisfaction-4

Apparently, there is always a long wait to get into this joint.  It was no different the day I decided to eat at Daikokuya. The lunch hour crowd packed the place up. But let me just say, it was well worth the wait. The ramen was excellent!  The broth, noodles, the veggies, and egg that accompany the ramen is outstanding. The service was quick and efficient and our food came out nice and hot.  A great lunch place for sure and honestly, probably the best ramen I have ever had.

I've been here twice on different days of the week. Once on a Friday and once on a Thursday. The service on Friday was phenomenal... I got everything I ordered within 10min of my order.... it was perfect for Lunch. On the Thursday I went, I waited 25min to receive just my fried rice (bad day to go maybe??), the ramen came later... it was great. The ramen is plentiful and there really isn't a need to get "extra noodle" unless your just famished and feel a need to EAT the whole restaurant....it comes with flavored egg and pork and TONS of noodles! Their Fried rice is the BEST fried rice EVER.... nothing tops it. I ordered the combo, it was like 12 bucks or so... definitely wallet friendly. Their Ramen is very good, no complaints, it is probably the second best ramen I've ever had next to Hakata. Depends on noodle preference really... I am a white-boy so I don't speak the language at all and some of the stuff on the menu just looks plain intimidating, so I dare not order anything that I cant point to and go, "that one"...?? sometimes I just guess... I've been a home-cooked ramen guy (i've tried every dried packet ramen and prepared it every which way possible...) for 10 years and was recently introduced to Daikokuya and Hakta, I was blown away!! Daikokuya is my ramen of choice for LA, and Hakata for the OC. No question, the 2 best places out there.

Hands down best ramen I have ever had. I waited 45 minutes with 3 of my friends to get a table and we all agreed that it was well worth it. Their ramen menu is pretty simple. Get it with, or without the broth. You want it with the broth though, because it is so delicious. The portions of broth, noodle, and pork slices are so generous that its hard to even finish the entire bowl.  I was not much of a ramen fan until I ate here. I had a trip to NYC shortly after discovering this place and tried to find a ramen that could match it. I sampled 3 different places and they did not even come close. For the real deal....go for Daikokuiya!!!

Man is this place ever crowded. I've been coming here for a year now and I've never seen it let up. If the hour long waits aren't enough proof for you the ramen is definitely worth waiting for especially if you've never had it before. The ramen is seriously great. The broth is blissful and the pork is simply wonderful. It tastes like it can kill you and I mean that in the best way. With every bite I'm seriously feeding buying into my family's history of high blood pressure. It's definitely worth trying. Daikokuya earns anywhere from 3-4 stars for me. As great as I think their ramen is... it gets tiring rather quickly. It's sooooo very rich (a double edged sword if there ever was one) and that keeps me from coming back week after week like others I know. It just begins to taste so normal so quickly. A lot of people I know swear they can come back frequently, but I can't deal with it. It's great in moderation. Everything else on their menu is decent. I like the shredded pork bowl and their unagi's alright. I still need to get around to trying the rest of it. It's definitely worth a try.

I am not sure how to write to this review without coming off sounding like an overzealous ramen fanatic or perhaps even a ramen snob so let me apologize in advance.   First off I want to clarify that this review is strictly for the quality of the food.  The service was fine and the "experience" was not much different from any other ramen place I've been to aside from the 1 hour wait to get our food.   As for the food, I am simply bewildered by the reviews here.  Yes, the ramen is better than most ramen places in LA but I don't see how that, in and of itself, warrants anything higher than 3 stars.  The way I see it, they get a star for attempting to make tonkotsu (pork base) ramen and another star for making it less than $10.  They lose two stars for not sufficiently flavoring the base.  To be honest it really seemed like they didn't add any flavoring () at all.  They lose another star for using those ungodly thick noodles (sorry, I prefer Hakata style, thin noodles with tonkotsu ramen).  Then of course they lose another star for making me wait in line and getting my hopes up.  So actually, by my math, 2 stars is kind of generous and frankly even if there were no wait I still wouldn't recommend Daikokuya to anyone who's ever had good ramen.  I guess to survive in the ramen wasteland that is LA, it's probably better to not know what good ramen really tastes like.   Let me reference this by saying that I lived in Tokyo for a year and during that time had ramen about once or twice a week at more places than I can count so I know what authentic ramen is supposed to taste like and Daikokuya is definitely not it.  I don't think the restaurant would last more than a week in any major city in Japan.  Don't get me wrong, I had plenty of bad ramen in Japan as well, but nothing quite as far below par as Daikokuya.  My wife, who grew up in Japan, was equally disappointed and it is safe to say that we will not be returning.  Let me also reference this by saying we brought back with us packaged ramen which I would choose over Daikokuya hands down, every time.  In Daikokuya's defense however the packaged ramen is from my favorite chain in Japan and was actually quite good, but still.  Needless to say we'll be procuring a lot more of this ramen the next time we are in Japan.  Until then I am holding out for Ippudo in New York. Here is an entry for ramen which I thought was pretty good when I was in Tokyo found on the Japanese equivalent of yelp, tabelog: http://r.tabelog.com/tok… To justify my review let me add that most good ramen places on the site usually get around 3.5 stars to about 4.5 stars.  If I were to apply these same standards I think 2 stars would be borderline charity.  So keep in mind that 2 stars reflects LA food review inflation.

So i finally decided to come to this place after hearing about it many eons ago.  I decided to ask my friend Oscar out because i have ditched out of hanging with him many times.  Luckily today was nice and cold and was the right moment to have a nice bowl of hot ramen.  Even suffering to go to this place via public transportation was worth it.   I was expecting a line when i got there but luckily it was non existent today.  This was around 1pm.  I guess i got there after the lunch rush was dying down or simply luckily.  The inside of the restaurant was pretty small but gives it a small comfort food feeling type of establishment.  Music was playing in the background which i recognized as music from anime OP.   We got seated within 5 minutes and I immediately ordered a Saporro beer and I got the Daikokuya ramen with kotteri flavor. The ramen was very good.  Had plenty of noodles and the pork based soup matched well with the soup.  it was very flavorful and i certainly wasn't disappointed at all.  The only real complaint i can give is that the hard boiled egg was cold when i bit into it but it didn't really bother me too much.  Washing it down with a cold beer was also quite nice.  The service there was brief and quick and the workers there were quite efficient.  Overall, i will definitely be coming back here again and trying other things on the menu.

Hands down, best ramen I've ever had!! I went on a Saturday afternoon and surprisingly didn't have to wait at all. Granted, my group and I were lucky and got the last table. Atmosphere: the shop is pretty much what you expect from an authentic ramen place: musty, small and with the chefs speaking in Japanese. My friend and I got the Daikokuya Ramen - which is amazing. The broth is so flavorful and you know it's been cooked right. The noodles - perfect. The egg - awesome. I seriously couldn't stop talking about this ramen after I went. My other friend wasn't that hungry and only got a tuna roll. I had a try and was underwhelmed. But what do you expect from a place that specializes in ramen? Parking was a bit difficult to find. We had to pay around $4 to park in the structure - it was worth it though!

This is the Holy Grail.  Daikokuya is the best ramen in so-cal.  The noodles is made fresh and the pork so thin and tasty.  Add an egg and a helpful serving of green onions and you have perfection.  The place is small and you are going to wait at least 30 mins but service is good and fast.  There are other things on the menu but probably not as good.  I recommend sharing a bowl with your spouse/gf and getting an appetizer so you do not feel stuffed.  My helpful tip is to bring your own tobacco sauce.  It really brings out the taste in the ramen without overwhelming the flavors.  They only have the chili powder and chili sauce which I dont really care for that much.  Also do not go to the other daikokuyas because it will not compare to the one in little Tokyo.

I've heard so many good things about the ramen at Daikokuya but never stopped by because of the never ending long lines. Well, last week I just decided to go for it. Wait time was over an hour. I'm not sure if it was because it was cold out, but my bowl of ramen (with extra fat) surely hit the spot. Portion size was perfect because I was starving. The only down side is the long wait.

I know this is the billionth review of Daikokuya, but what the heck. Everybody knows they're the best standard Ramen place in Little Tokyo. It's also one of the only places open as late as it is that's worth going to, unless you feel like Deli food or Pink's. The wait sucks. Seems like every time I go back, it's longer. The food, well, it wouldn't be worth it if it weren't for the nightmare that taking the 110 down to Santouka is. But because it's so much easier to get to, I used to go a lot when I lived in LA, and I usually still end up when when visiting. The food is really inconsistent. When it's at it's best, their kotteri ramen is some of the best tonkotsu I've ever had, and I've spent about a total of a month in Japan, with all the ramen-eating that comes with it. When it sucks, it's not even worth finishing the bowl. It's not gross or anything, but a good 35% of the time, it's just bland and boring. Their menma (bamboo shoots) are always spectacular, though. One other thing I love is their fried rice, which gets a lot less talk than the ramen itself. It's my favorite chahan, especially with the little red bits of ginger that comes with it mixed in. The shredded lettuce salad they bring with their combos is really good too. Anyway, three stars because of the inconstancy and the wait. It seriously sucks to wait 90 minutes, sit down, find out they're out of kotteri, and then get served a bowl of what tastes like Campbell's soup with some stuff in it. On the other hand, it has its nights that are 5-worthy, and that's what keeps me coming back. That and the knowledge that it'll never be BAD, just disappointing, and it's open late.

This ain't your 10-cent Maruchan Top Ramen from the "international" aisle in the grocery store.  This is the serious, authentic ramen, the stuff that cheap packaged ramen is striving to be.  I've tried ramen at other places in L.A. but this is the best one; the others can't hold a candle to Daikokuya.  Perhaps the best ramen this side of the Pacific, it's comprable to the excellent ramen I've had in Japan.  The noodles are cooked to perfect firmness, the egg is soft-boiled so slightly runny in the middle, the little scallions add to the already wonderful broth which is pork flavored and cooked for hours and hours.  Excellent, excellent ramen.  I am drooling right now writing this review.  The wait can be insane because the place is small and, well, the food is so damn good, so I advise going right when they open or late at night.  I've come right at opening and was immediately seated at the bar, and I've come at 10:30 PM, and there were a few open booths.  Both times were weekdays.  Go to here right now and order the Daikokuya ramen!  Beware--it's huge.  Wear your stretchy pants.

We came to this place last weekend after seeing a musical and had high hopes of getting good food.  Well, Daikokuya didn't disappoint.  This place is located in Little Tokyo and has somewhat of an authentic presence.  We arrived close to 10pm and this place was crowded.  After being added to the 'wait list' the host continuously kept us abreast of how long our wait will be.  With the restaurant being small, we were seated at the counter, which was fine because we just wanted to eat.  The waitress was most friendly and suggestive.  Speaking of friendly, this waitress complimented my hat and told me it reminds her of the singer Ne-Yo.  Well, she was already in for a good tip.  The food was good, though I wasn't too thoroughly impressed with my teriyaki chicken because it was submerged with sauce.  Other than that, this place puts out some good hot food very fast.  The prices aren't expensive and the service is very good.  Our waitress and the host continuously made sure we were taken care of.  When we left, we were shocked that the cooks screamed out "thank you for coming!".  Once I learn how to properly say the name of this place, I'll invite others, as I plan to return.

3.5 if there's one thing i can eat ALL DAY/ALL NIGHT, it's definitely japanese food, hands down ... but seriously, daikokuya. what is wrong with you? i came in with so much expectations but it was fairly average... its good but not like OMG YOURE SOO GOOD...  i have to say one thing, however. the broth was much better than i had anticipated but it wasn't WHOA... soy saucey/porky flavored.  there's other japanese dishes from donburi, sushis and stuff but their signature dish are supposedly, their noodles, so you can't go wrong with that, and if anything, get one ramen and split it with whoever... half size is $6 and it's doable... noodles were cooked just the way i like it, so kudos to that... portion size, i must admit, another point for that...=) but not to the point of being 4 stars. but what REALLY blew me over the top was their yummy fried rice!! Mmmmm ...  but not worth $7, but def made me a fat happy camper! total family style, comfort food which is exactly what my tum tums was seeking...  just expect to be bumping elbows with your fellow people and an average of a 45 min wait, but hey now, that's the whole fun part of enjoying your experience, eh?

I'm not here to slam on this place BUT..  I was definitely not impressed with ALL the hype.  I was expecting MUCH MUCH BETTER.  The soup was way too bland and lacked flavor.  The noodles were really not that great.  Not saying that it was terrible but I've had better at either Santouka, or Hakata Ramen (in both Fountain Valley and Gardena).  Thy gyoza came as a square with a ridiculous mound of green onions on it.  That is not normal so please don't think that everywhere is like this.  And the portions were overwhelmingly HUGE.  GUYS IT'S ABOUT QUALITY NOT QUANTITY.  Maybe it was a bad day but the service there SUCKS.  My co-worker and I went there for lunch thinking that it might be a quick bite to eat but NOPE.  There was a group of 2 girls that came in after us but for some reason they were eating before I even got my salad (Sure they might have been cuter than me but still come on hahahaha)  And a lady came in after that and said I'm here just for the ramen and she got her's in a matter of MINUTES.  She was out before I even got my ramen.  They need to realize that they are NOT the BOMB.  And there are MUCH better ramen restaurants out there.   Granted there bathroom was very clean and smelled good but other than that not a fan and wouldn't go back unless my car breaks down in front of that restaurant and EVERY other restaurant is closed.

I don't get it.  Why were people lined up outside the door for this place?  I ordered the daikoku ramen and pork cutlet combo.  While the noodles had a nice and slightly chewy texture, the broth was disappointingly bland.  And what's up with that funky egg?  If I ever go back, I will stick to the pork cutlet bowl.  Also, they have a depressing selection of sake -- we only managed to finish two bottles, it was that bad.  Snobby Jim B. was only able to choke down a few sips.

i visited during the week around 1130am...the wait was short; about 10 mins for a seriously tattered booth. not a big deal, but with those fancy touch screen hand held order takers, you'd think they could afford to pretty the place up some. our server was friendly enough, but sooo soft spoken! maybe it's true that i'm losing my hearing in my old age, but in a restaurant so packed with people chit chatting away, i don't think i heard a thing she said; totally relied on my lunch companion to translate for me. i ordered the combo with a tuna sashimi bowl with sushi rice. this bowl was the star of the meal!! the fish was fresh and the rice was delish. perfect little serving size, too. the ramen itself, what i was looking forward to most, came shortly after the sashimi bowl. the broth wasn't piping hot...that was disappointing. i had to push my tuna to the side while i slurped up the soup before it got too cold. the pork was just ok, too! a little bit too fatty for me...the whole egg wasn't anything to rave about. it actually tasted nothing like an egg; sorta freaked me out. of course i built this place up in my head to be the be ramen messiah, so i was disappointed more than i should have been. while the broth was good, it was not as savory or nearly as flavorful as i yearned for it to be. it tasted rather watered down, in fact. thank goodness i didn't sit thru the hour + waits some people describe. i woulda been pi-hiiiisssed. i would come back here for that tuna bowl and their delightful little salad...and probably to try some of their other side dishes that i hear good things about...will pass on the ramen, though~!

Don't fall for the $7 bento box scam! It seems like a deal until you discover that the sushi rolls taste like they came from Ninjiya's refrigerator and were left out until room temperature, and that the tempura tastes like deep fried paper. The salad was ok, but the miso soup was salt city! So I'm guessing ramen is the way to go here. Paul mentioned that it wasn't as good as Santouka, but better than 10-cent Top Ramen (what the hell is oriental flavor anyway?). There was no wait when we showed up during lunch at around 12:15pm, but it got crowded quickly--so stuffy and gross! Um... so yeah, enjoy your visit to Daikokuya!

for all the hype this place has gotten, i expected a lot more.  the noodles were good, the entire boiled egg was a little awkward to eat, the gyoza was alright but not the way i prefer it.  the service was horribly slow, which, for a place with so much business, makes no sense.

Yeah I've been to this ramen house like 2 months ago spontaneously after roaming around Little Tokyo, and going to Olivera Street in Downtown for a good taqueria, and this I have to admit is really good, and almost equal to my OC ramen house I am boasting that is really damn good! Santouka (Santoka) in Costa Mesa California, but Daikoku-Ten has its own distinct taste and signature for ramen entree and the rice dishes are not bad for the price. Santoka is for OC, and for LA this is the spot to go. The shoyu will always be my favorite flavor, however Daikokuya has their own Kurobuta Pork flavor, and like I mentioned has its own distinct flavor that is good in a combination taste with the ramen noodles. I also tried the Tsukemen, and for this joint I prefer their Tsukemen better that the ramen entree. Oh yeah one more thing I had side of gyoza, and their gyoza did not appeal to me because the taste was not fresh at all. But Overall I give this 4 stars for Ramen category (That's good)

I been hearding about this place forever but never made any time to go taste it but after leaving for culinary school back east, my craving for asian food just want haywire when I came back to visit. I ate everything that I could get a hold of and I made a effort to drive up to little tokyo in LA just to try this place out. There were closer location in monteray park and one in costa mesa but I decided let try the place w.the most review. The place is very easy to found but parking is a nightmare. The place itself is very cozy and pretty pack w/people coming in and out. There is even a noodle bar and waiting is the norm. I order the ramein w/juicy pork, bamboo shoot, onion and a egg. The texture of the noodle was very good and the soup base was very flavorable but the downside was the broth was alittle cold. The waitress wasn't really nice but maybe it because of the communication. My friend order the shrimp and vegetable bowl and they add the ponzu sauce in so the tempura was very soggy. I also order the salmon eggs bowl and that was very good. So many tasty eggs. Overall I thought the meal was good but not the best ramein I ate so alittle disappointed.

-1 star for the wait.  Been there twice, first time 1 hr wait, second 2 hr wait (name at 9PM, dinner at 11PM, out at 11:20).  Food is good, I like the salad, ramen, pork rice.  I discovered I like the egg better with a little soy sauce on it.  For way less of a wait, and the ability to take out, try the one in Arcadia.  Best if you go with 2 or less persons, much easier.  Also, if you have a large party (more than 6), I'd advise you to split the group, you're going to have to anyways.

Has anybody eaten two dinners in one day? Has anybody eaten two ramen dinners in one day...seperated by let's say...a half hour? Well I am a proud member of this club. My friends and I wrote our name down on the long list of ramen deprived eaters and we waited....and waited...and waited. For goodness sakes, it was a Thursday! Our hungry bellies took over our brains and clouded our judgement and we headed off to some other ramen place down the street. Names not needed here. We ordered quickly and ate quickly too. Devoured our humungous bowls of mediocre ramen. But our bellies still remained unsatisfied. So, we head back to Daikokuya and look back at the list (which was still pretty long) and politely ask one of the waiters that our names had never been called. She promptly seats us. Ahahaha to the suckers who are still waiting! We do sort of a family style ordering, because frankly we were pretty full. But we manage to order a bowl of ramen, fried rice, shredded pork bowl, and some cold sake. Despite how ridiculously full we were...every bite was worth it. Mmm..who doesn't like pork fat melting in your mouth? Def coming back here again. Oh and psst...don't look at the rating on the front window.

I wasn't going to write a review on daikokuya - after all, it has 400+ reviews already, and my rating is not so different from the average.  Just want to say something in defense of what a lot of critics consider flaws in their ramen.  I love the egg.  Although many years ago when I first tried it, I was surprised that it was cold.  But after a few more tries (and realizing it wasn't a mistake), I came to like it a lot.  It's tasty and a cool contrast to the hot broth.  I think the amount of meat they give you is perfect - you'd still leave the place feeling sated, but not heavy.  I love fat, so I don't mind the meat being fattening.  The broth is what I come for.  Yes, it's inconsistent - some day it's better than others, but usually it's still pretty great.  The wait is annoying, so I usually go there for a late lunch or early dinner.  I wouldn't say it's the best ramen in town - there are so many that I haven't tried yet.  Besides, a Scorpio would hold out such hyperbole, always optimistic something better is around the corner.  Still, it keeps me coming back.

It has become a ritual for me and my boyfriend to get our grub on at Daikokuya everytime we come back from a Dodger's game or when we cruise around Little Tokyo. We like HAVE to go there! Since it's always packed and they don't take reservations, you should at least expect a 30-45min wait. Don't forget to sign in and try to be around the area or else they'll skip you if you don't respond the first call. The waiting sucks but once you get a taste of their Shredded Pork Bowl...good grecious! you're going to reconsider it was totally worth the wait.  Also, the salad that comes with any big meals are downright awesome! Not a big fan of their Ramen though...I don't know if it's the noodle or the soup, their Ramen just doesn't excite me. The joint looks pretty old school and a bit humid and dirty. You'll still be able to manage though. Definitely not a place to bring a date or celebrate. Just eat and go. Hands down on the Shredded Pork Bowl and salad :)  mmm-mm!

I been to Daikokuya three times within the last 2 weeks.  First time there - sat at a table, LOVED their gyoza, and their ramen wasn't bad either.  I especially liked the soup, it's flavorful but not salty, but I prefer Shin Sen Gumi's pork.  Second time - sat at a table, ordered the same thing, no complaints.  Don't you just love the tons of green onions they give you?  Third time - sat at the bar, ordered the same thing, watched the chef prepare it, and almost threw up.  The guy was sweating profusely so he would wipe the sweat off his forehead w/ his hands, and with those same bare hands grab the green onions to finish off our ramen, gyoza, and whatever else that required a sprinkle of it.  While he was cooking fried rice, I could see his sweat drizzle down his face and perhaps into the wok?  Yum!  Whoever ordered that must've thought the rice was incredibly flavorful.  So all you white folks, think twice before you go back, and my fellow asians...I know you don't care.

I came here on a Tuesday at 1 pm and only waited for 5-10 min for a party of four.  I got their signature Daikokuya Ramen and it was delicious.  The noodles weren't too hard or soggy.  The broth is what really makes it.  It is flavorful and not too salty.  It comes with pork, egg and veggies.  The fried rice is also amazing.  I would have to say this is my favorite ramen place in Little Tokyo.  It is cash only.

If you're looking for a more authentic ramen, here's the place. Daikokuya looks like an old traditional Japanese Mom & Pop shop with limited seating. This is the best ramen I ever had.  We, a party of 6, had to sit at separate tables, which was fine just as long as you had their ramen...all the frustration from waiting 1 hour to get seated goes away. If you have the time and patience, it is so worth the wait.

Okay ramen is just like relationships, I'm not gonna argue with anyone which's the best. I'm just gonna focus on their eggs. If you've had Daikokuya's ramen, you must have an egg with it. Their eggs are the gist of their peculiar character among all other ramen places. The yorks are soft, just about to melt in your mouth, with their warm juice coming out when you carefully bite just so you know it won't spill everywhere... You really taste the true essence of a soft boiled egg there. No gimmick, simple, primitive, an egg cooked just right in a bowl of noodles. It can get intense, seriously. The way they cook eggs is a representation of their culture of respect to details, in my opinion. It's just somehow a complete catch among all so many ramen places in L.A.! It's just like a man can pay $300 to take a girl to Water Grill for oysters from whichever ocean I don't even know, which is of course nice but when he actually gets up from bed like a spring, walks to the bathroom and hooks your brassiere on the back, it's even another level of dedication, if you know what I'm talking about. The yellow place's eggs rock!

The Daikokuya ramen hit the spot. If you want a good tonkotsu ramen and you're in the neighborhood, make sure you stop by. Try the gyoza too- it's a bit different than the usual kinds you would see at ramen shops in LA. I enjoyed the vibe of the restaurant- old japanese movie posters, japanese coke ads, and action figures from the 70's.

Excellent Ramen - the best I've found in LA so far.  The broth is tasty but not salty, the noodles are curly and firm (my favorite part of the meal) and the meat is tender.  They also have crushed garlic which adds nice flavor.  The fried rice was delicious, the shredded pork bowl was good too, but a tad sweet.  I would get the combination (ramen + rice bowl) and take away what you don't finish.  The only thing I wouldn't recommend are their gyozas.  On a Saturday night the wait was 30 min around 7pm.

So apparently you're not an official "Yelper" until you do a Daikokuya review....so here's mine.  I used to LOVE this place, I really did.  When the first few times you come here and you luckily DON'T HAVE TO WAIT more than 30 minutes, you HAVE TO LOVE IT!!  The broth is flavorful, the ramen cooked right, the pork oh so tender and fatty, and then you throw that seasoned boiled egg in there and my gawd if that ain't magic.... But then reality hit me and as I brought more people here and we're waiting 45 minutes, 1 hour 15 minutes, all this time telling my friends that it's sooo worth it.  It's gotta be if everyone else is waiting  right??  I guess so... but man, when you're hungry, Mr. Ramen can taste almost as good (EASY, EASY....I SAID ALMOST!!)  Look, read my other reviews, I don't like waiting!!  So, with that said, 4 STARS SOLID,  but I would -1/2 star for waiting 45 minutes and more and +1/2 for waiting less than 30 minutes and less.

I feel weird saying this but, overall, Santouka is better than Daikokuya. I came to this conclusion last night as I was slurping down underwhelming scoops of Daikokuya ramen. I thought Daikokuya was the best for a long time and didn't have another bowl of ramen that came close until I tried Santouka, so I initially thought Santouka was second best. I've eaten at Santouka a lot more times than Daikokuya because it is closer and more convenient for me, but man, after eating Daikokuya again last night year, my tastebuds must be spoiled now or Daikokuya has gone downhill. I've switched sides! Daikokuka has been my favorite ramen place for the past 3 years, but something about it has changed. The last two times I've eaten there I felt underwhelmed. The last time I went I just thought it was just a bad day for them, but I went there for dinner last night, ordered the ramen and shredded pork combo. Ramen noodles were the same, the broth was lacking heat (temperature), its usual salty, robust flavor, and my bowl didn't have a single strip of bamboo in it. The ramen here is still better than most places I've tried around Los Angeles, but certainly not worth the ridiculous wait or even the drive out to Little Toyko anymore. From now on when I get the urge for delicious fatty ramen, I am going to Santouka inside the Mitsuwa supermarkets in L.A. and Costa Mesa. Santouka ramen is served in a much smaller bowl, but the broth and pork is so rich and flavorful that I have no problem filling up. The only thing that Daikokuya still has over Santouka is the marinated egg. God, that egg is so good. But I always consistently leave Santouka with a full, satisfied belly and an hour of extra time!

truly a jem!! this place is famous for its ramen, and its for a good reason. the broth is very very good. other items to consider is the fried rice and the beef bowl. the portion is very well placed where you dont leave anything on your plate yet you wont be overly stuffed. only draw back is that the line is INSANE!!! dont go there during busy times because it can take up to 45 min to get a seat. but the good news is that you can put your name and walk around the area then comeback in there

this is now my fourth ramen restaurant that i've tried thanks to the tour and the advice of one of my japanese friends.  we had such a killer gigantic meal this past saturday night!  after our one hour wait we sat up on the counter, we had the sausage which was out of this world! followed by the gyoza again-big hit! i ordered the ramen/fried rice combo- the best fried rice i have ever eaten!! this was the first time i tried the hard boiled egg in the soup and it was sooo much better than i thought, the garlic i put in the broth was the hot tip.  overall the best ramen so far on the tour- i am so thankful to Yelp for teaching me about Ramen and how many great places we have here in LA for this!!! can't wait to hit #7!!!  and of course, coming back to Daikokuya!!!

This place can get pricy for a ramen house but there's enough food for two if you share an order.  I split the house ramen and small bowl of tuna over rice.  Tuna was cut a little too thin but the sushi rice was outstanding.  It was on the vinegary side, just the way I like it.  Oddly enough, the cole slaw went really well with the tuna donburi.  The ramen noodles were long and bouncy and the broth had great body although it was a bit salty.  Meat was super tender and the green onion and sprouts tied everything together.  The egg was a little weird.  Did they boil away the egg white part of it?  How is that even possible...  ANYHOO, don't forget to add the garlic-y paste condiment that's on the table.  It takes the soup to new heights!  Service was friendly and prompt.  What's with Japanese girls extending the last syllable of whatever they are saying at an incredibly shrill volume?  Wakes you up, it does.

Very flavorful ramen, add "fat" in it, it makes it extra buttery ! The pork bowl is also very good and their bento box comes with a lot of stuff with a reasonable price, the wait is usually about 30 mins to 1 hr. but so worth the wait, you should be there 20 mins early then what your meet up time is just so you have time to find parking. They dont have private parking street parking only. Oh and try to stand by the entrance so you can here them call your number because they call it out once and if you dont respond withing 3 secs its next in line.

Have only been once but was so pleased! Had gyoza and the ramen served separate from the soup.  Gyoza skin tasted amazing (do they make their own?) and much like the places in Alhambra that roll their own skin, except this one was very thin but still chewy.  They are a bit spare on the gyoza stuffing (this is an observation, not a criticism; it tasted tasted great).  The ramen had a terrific flavor (unidentifiable to me) that was a bit beyond ramen; the broth was full of flavor (and not salt -- thank you, Daikokuya!); but, the pork was a bit on the fatty side for my taste.  That they serve the ramen separate from the soup is awesome, too, since I sometimes don't finish and want to take it home, but doing so with ramen sitting in hot soup softens the noodles after all that soaking.  But, I shoulda known: it was so good, we slurped up every last bit of food!

Sure beats eating top ramen at home!  I'm not embarrassed to say that I have eaten here 2 nights in a row before.  Their ramen is that good.  This is a good spot to eat after late night drinking/clubbing since they are open late.  I give 4 stars because this place is tiny and you will always have to wait for a table.  It gets hot inside too, plus you'll be sweating from eating the hot noodles.  Parking sucks too.  Last time we had to park far and I had to walk what felt like an eternity in my 4-inch pumps.  My guy had to practically carry me the rest of the way. booooo

I should preface by saying that I really don't like ramen that much.  I tend to get dragged along by certain individuals (such as Matt P.) and his girlfriend Katie.  Anyways we tried to go here last week and I put up a big fight because I wanted Chinese (Phoenix Inn) and there was also a huge wait for a table and so a result the mission was aborted.  Now I have to admit that I felt bad for what I had done.  I decided that I would get over my negativity towards ramen and give this place a shot.  (I was also inspired by a guy at physical therapy who couldn't stop raving).  So myself and Infizzle went this Monday and let me tell you: I really liked it a lot.  It is different than normal ramen in that it is somewhat thicker and milkier.  The noodles were very soft and the pork was exceptional.  So overall I am impressed.  It might just be the one ramen place that I can tolerate.  Good work Matt!

After waiting for at least half an hour to be seated, I was completely famished.  So I didn't care if we got the bar stools instead of a table.  There is definitely a reason to justify all the people willing to wait for their raumen.  You can actually taste the unique pork bone flavors in the soup base.  The pork is marinated well which is a treat because most other ramen places don't take the time to do this right.  The raumen noodles are chewy and does not get soggy quickly soaking in the soup.  Try the Fried Spicy Tuna, it's a pretty good appetizer, served with lemon and coarse sea salt for added flavor.  Overall, Daikokuya is one of the better ramen places, but I can't say it's the cleanest.  The restroom was messy and the floor definitely is due for a major sweeping.  I would avoid sitting at the counter/bar area because it is SO HOT there!  Don't sit in front of the big pot of the the pork bone soup continuously heating what ever you do.  It's seat #7.  I was seated there, and I had to move because it was giving me a headache and deterred me from concentrating on enjoying my raumen.  The gals didn't seem to pleased with me moving and leaving an empty spot at the counter.  I know there are people waiting and they want to squeeze as many people in as possible, but we did ask the waiter/busboy if I can move to the left.  He even cleaned up the spot for me to move to.  Well, he got chewed out by one of the gals in Japanese... don't know what she said, but she was mean!  Minus one star because I've never seen such a rude Japanese.  The food is good, so 4 stars.

So I got hooked on ramen after going to Ippudo in NYC on a business trip:  it was like heroin, and like heroin I've been chasing that elusive high after my first "hit."  After traveling back to the West Coast (aka "Gotham City" aka "Home"), I've been on a ramen-hunt. While, in my opinion, Ippudo had better ramen (if there was a way to score it 6 stars on Yelp, I would), Daikokuya served up one of the best meals I've had on the West Coast, ramen or not.  The restaurant is tiny (they get the kvetching out of the way with an "apology we're so small" note on the front door) and the wait wasn't short (about 45 minutes, standing, mainly outdoors albeit in good LA weather), but very, very worth it.  The ramen was AWESOME, as was their fried rice; hell, even their salad was great...and I HATE salad like Han Solo hates stormtroopers.  Seriously.  Anywho, back to Daikokuya:  come, park, wait, eat, and you will not be disappointed (or your mattress is FREEE!), just bring a book or your iphone to watch something while you're waiting to be seated.

I know, I know, it's already been said... but Daikokuya is heaven.  Just thinking about it I'm tempted to go ride up there.  I've never walked in and gotten a table, but it's usually fine if one of us jumps out and puts our names in and the other drives around looking for parking.  Average wait?  Maybe 30 minutes or so.  Worth every second.  There is no other choice but to order the pork ramen, the house special.  It will BLOW YOUR MIND.   I have to be starving to eat the whole thing though so usually if I'm with someone else we'll just get the ramen combo with the pork ramen and a smaller bowl of something else (hooray chicken terriyaki) and some edamame.  I would try anything that they make, but it's impossible to not order ramen.  I can't wait to try the summer cold noodle version.  I like sitting out the counter and watching them make the ramen, except at the end of a meal here I normally need to sit back and relax, it's exhausting.  This place is way too small is the only problem, there is obviously a huge demand for the food it should be bigger.  The waiters are quick and polite, there are always so many people in line we never have to wait for a check.  I could easily rave about Daikokuya for a while longer, but I think I'm just going to stop and head up there.

it was crowded and when i wait for food i want to be flipping cartwheels off the table when i get it. it didn't even inspire me to golf clap . the soup was lukewarm and pork broth should not be lukewarm. the egg was undercooked the gyoza was mushy and leaky. i squirted my friend when i bit into it. the flavors were tepid and the presentation was like diarrhea in a bowl. it just made me regret battling through downtown to get to lil tokyo. i could have just stayed home and made my bad version of sapporo ichiban ramen. i will give that the service was impeccable. i was never without ginger or water. my tongue just had a much better time at orochon and hanaichimonme

I give it 2 stars...1 star for the large portion...and the other star for fast service since we were seated within 5 minutes on a Monday....close to noontime. We ordered the Daikokuya kotteri and it was just bland. Also, the thick layer of fat that floated on top scared me. I tasted it but it was just bland and flavorless. The bean sprouts in ther made everything even more bland....and the ramen does not seem authentic. I bet they just go to Canton Foods Co located around there and buy big bags of it.  I don't know what others are talking about here. Even though the portion size is huge, it left us feeling very unsatitised. If you really want a good place for ramen, please go to Santouka Ramen located on 3760 S Centinela Ave. Even though the portions are a bit smaller, the flavor there will leave you very happy!

Ate a late lunch here this weekend and was seated at the bar within about 30 minutes. It's a very small, hole-in-the wall place, good for a casual lunch with friends or dining solo. Service was fast and friendly. Ordered the fried rice and ramen combo, which came with a shredded cabbage salad with a mayo-based dressing. The salad was bland but not bad. Ramen came out next, and fearing the extra fatty kotteri, I stuck with the regular. I thought it was a rich enough broth, not hugely flavorful, and wished for some garlic oil on top (I'm used to this from eating ramen elsewhere). The noodles were a nice al dente (sadly not home-made though) and the whole egg was a perfect medium-hard and comprised my favorite bites. There was also lots of scallion, only a couple of slivers of bamboo shoot, and a small quantity of very thinly sliced pork (chashu), which I didn't find to be tasty/substantial (it was mostly fat not meat). The menu also promised bean sprout and sesame seeds, but I witnessed none in my bowl. Overall, good ramen, not the best I've ever had, but would recommend trying. The fried rice came out a few minutes after the ramen and it was flavorful, but way too pork-laden/greasy for my taste - would not order it again. When I was about done with my meal, I saw that the party seated next me ordered a half-size ramen soup, which I didn't know about, but would consider ordering next time so I can try the gyoza, which looked really good in the menu photo. Saw that a lot of people ordered the bento boxes too, which were huge.

my friends had been raving about this place before i had visited, and i'm sad to say it wasn't as great as they had made it out to be.  i'll be honest, i like ramen, and i like ramen a lot.  a huge, huge plus is that their noodles have and amazing texture (just the right bit of firmness).  their broth is thick and creamy, yo...if that's your thing.  i guess what bothered me was that i'm not a huge fan of pork fat just swirling around in my soup (and yeah, i know that's where the flavor's at).  and the prices start at like $9!  what kind of ramen noodles are that expensive?  once i got over thinking about how many calories the broth might contain and about my shrinking wallet vs. the economy, i could actually enjoy the place.  if anything, this place belongs in its own special category of good, yet expensive ramen.

My friends and I came here yesterday for some ramen, reminiscence of our trip to Japan. We came around 1:30pm-ish, hoping to beat the lunch rush. I was wrong. It was very crowded, so we had to wait outside in the windy cold. We waited for about 1.5 hours before being seated. By that time, we were all quite starved. So come early, before you plan to get hungry. My friends and I were quite greedy. I got the combo meal with their famous ramen and tempura rice which I split with my friend in exchange for half of her teriyaki eel. It was a pretty great price, considering I was so stuffed, I could barely move after eating all of the food. The broth was flavorful without being overly salty. The noodles was also good texture. The tempura wasn't great though since it was moist and not crunchy by the time it was served. The eel was also very delicious. Overall, very tasty. The wait is worth it if you have some source of entertainment or the wait may drive you crazy.

After my recent intro to Tonkatsu Ramen greatness,  I made it my personal mission to hit the infamous Daikokuya while I was in town.  This place is always "daaaaaamn" busy even in the late hours but you should already know (infamous hello).  Daikoku Ramen.  It's good...real good but not waiting for no hour good (keeping it real yo).  Izakaya Sozai, which is in the Bay (yay for me, sorry my LA peeps) popped my cherry too freaking good and cannot be beat.  At least not with the broth and even the noodles (wait unfortunately is just as bad).  Daikokuya pork belly, I concede, was way better though (step it up Izakaya).   The 411 on the other star here is the fried rice.  Typically I'm not a fan of the fried, what can I say I'm a purist so it's got to be steamed.  The only exception to that would be garlic fried rice (Filipino I be) but decided to see what was up.  What the...holy friedness...screw being a purist!  We also ordered the sliced roast pork and with that rice...that combo...I got to stop.  Seriously, I'm literally salivating and damnit Daikokuya...you make me want to move back down south *smh*

We passed by this place a couple of times and always noticed a line outside. Today we decided to walk around the area to decide where to eat. We even passed on Koji. We saw the place packed and lots of locals waiting to be called. Put our name on the list and read the menu and reviews on Yelp. I was quite excited seeing 900+ reviews on this place. After 15 minutes we got called and got seated. The place is small but the atmosphere of an authentic Japanese noodle shop. I like the ambience and the crowd seemed to be enjoying their food. We ordered the roasted pork and daikoku ramen. We were worried we weren't going to finish the soup so we decided to share and make this a combo with a small plate of fried rice. The food was delivered fast. The broth was a little salty but excellent. There was so much goodness with the way the egg, the veggies, the noodles, the pork, all blended together. That roasted pork looked like strips of bacon and practically melted in your mouth. The fried rice was really good too. I could barely walk from being so full. I over ate which is rare. I simply over indulged because I truly enjoyed our meal and the food was delicious. Satomi made small talk with us and really made sure we were happy with our meal. Now we know what the fuss is all about. This place is a gem. King of Ramen in my book....

oh snappity snap snap...this place is popular..banco popular! we got there 30 minutes before the restaurant opened and there was already a line down the block. when we got in, we sat at the bar and ordered up the ramenss. the boo got the daikoku ramen while i ordered the deconstructed ramen soup which i liked better since you can really taste the ramen. i believe they make their own ramen and boy does it taste yummy. the broth was miso based i think and that was particularly tasty. i will definitely be back!

The cooler weather is soon coming and I will be digging into a steaming ramen bowl at Daikokuya. It's within walking distance of the civic center, little tokyo, and the pig pen, a.k.a. parker ctr. in downtdown. It's perfectly located if you are planning an evening around the downtown area. Try it out on the way to your LA destination.  I was first taken to this humbled place by co-workers and have always left there satisfied ever since. I have ordered much of what they offer but for sure- get the Ramen Bowl (with rich sauce). The Egg and Chicken bowl is good and quite different for such simple ingredients. My only complaint is that it doesn't have enough seating for its demand. It has about 6 booths and some bar seating and that's all. The last few times going there I have had to wait about 25-30 minutes. Bar seating is always faster if you are pressed for time. The service is no frills and quick since the menu is limited. Daikokuya is well worth the wait. I can't wait until I go back and have another bowl.

Not sure what I can say that hasn't already been said in the other 498 reviews. The (kotteri-style) ramen was soooo fatty and soooo rich, but soooooo good. I found the broth a little salty, but I also didn't see the condiments on the side of the table until I'd already finished eating (d'oh!)

So as the list for Rameniac's Top 10 Ramen Shops in LA draws to a close and my friends and I spending several months trying out the list, here's my thought on no.10, this ramen shop in Little Tokyo that always seems to be popular, Daikokuya: http://www.rameniac.com/… w00t!!11!! Yay,  I'm done with Rameniac's Top 10 list (and probably ramen in general for a while XD) So after seeing that this has dropped from being no. 8 on the previous Top 10 list to dead last this year I have to wonder what happened. Every time I come to Little Tokyo I see the group of trendy hipsters hanging out in the front of this place, (like moths to the fire or twitter users to the Kogi truck XD),  waiting for their group leader's name to be called out in broken Engrish, so they can experience that apparently awesome food know as Daikoku ramen that their flamboyant hipster friends brag about and then, once they're done with their meal, push up their black horn rim fake glasses, reapply the guyliner, scratch that face stubble, whip out their iTouch/Blackberry gizmo from their ass...er I mean, skin tight jeans they stole from their kid sister and rave about it on their blogs, telling their buddies this is the greatest ramen shop on earth and how they have the cute animu store next door with the frilly dresses(that they would wear if they could wear if they dropped those 10lb from their already anorexic lookin frame), further infesting this place with the vermin known as hipster. Yeah, I think I've established my hatred towards hipsters XD So anyway, the few times I have come here, I usually go after the peak hours, like late afternoon on a weekday to avoid the long wait and feeling out of place with the trendy freaks converging by the front. Though on my most recent visit, I came here on a Friday night around 6pm and was surprised that wasn't a line and we got a seat a few minutes after entering. Its a small restaurant, with various Japanese posters covering the walls, a bookshelf full of manga to the right of the doorway when you enter and a old tv with fuzzy reception showing whatever is on (but drowned out by the music blaring from the stereo system) to the left. There's a few booths and a counter facing an open kitchen. Oh, and the place is stuffy and not very well vented, so expect to sweat and feel uncomfortably warm during your dining experience. My first time here I had I had the katsu don which was really good.On my most recent trip here, I had the kotteri ramen combination meal with small fried rice and salad with a mayo based dressing, while Pablo and Noel had the Daikoku ramen, with Noel making it a combination meal by choosing a pork bowl.   Now I assume the main reason people come here for is the ramen but honestly I don't see what's so special about it.  It was a very large bowl of thin wavy noodles some chashu slivers, green onions and a bolied egg in a bland milky broth, supposedly "enhanced" by the pork fat  when requested (making it Kotteri.rather than the regular Daikoku Ramen).It actually reminded me of the miso ramen I had at the less popular San Sui Tei just a few doors down from here, but slightly gritty due to the pork fat used. Of course in both cases it was pretty bland and pouring in almost half a bottle of shichimi togarashi made little difference. Even the package of Ajisen instant ramen I bought at 99 Ranch Market tasted better. I had trouble finishing the ramen and even after forcing myself to attempt to finish the soup itself I just couldn't do it.   The fried rice was ok, even though it was kind of burned and not very flavorful, but Noel's pork bowl was probably the best dish among the food we had on our recent visit, filled with lots of sweet shredded pork pieces with green onion and pickled ginger. Even Rameniac has mentioned that its overhyped and along with with their expansion efforts, that "the chefs began fussing with the recipe in an effort to accommodate the influx of new customers." (i.e. those damn trendies) meaning the ramen quality is inconsistent, ruining what supposedly was once pretty decent rament. Overall, Its decent enough to come back during the downtime if I was starving and couldn't think of anywhere else to eat at,  but I'd probably just have the pork bowl, eel bowl, katsu don or their other items over that overated ramen that so many people creamed their jeans over. Even Chin-Ma-Ya or Orochon 2 blocks away would better than Daikokuya. I'd even gladly make a trip on the 405 S in traffic over to Santouka, Asa or even Gardena Ramen for better quality ramen. A small bowl of excellent ramen at those places is better than a huge piping bowl of over hyped crap from Daikokuya.

This place is pretty good overall based on food alone.  I got the basic tonkatsu ramen with gyoza and kirin draft beer.  I should have ordered more exotic dishes and beer, but nobody else was in my party and so I didn't want to be the odd one out.   Broth was very tasty from what I remember.  The only downside to this place is the INSANE wait time.  When we arrived to the joint around 7:30pm, it was well over 45 minute wait for a party of 5.  I must've walked around like  a window shopper in that japanese collectible store next door towards the left of the place multiple times to escape the agony.   Would I say this place is worth the wait?  I don't think it's worth waiting apx 1 hr or more if all you are going to get is something simple and basic.   If you are still planning to go thru with the painful wait process, make sure you bring lots of mo-NAY so you can pig out and create an ultimate feast for the eyes even if you are by yourself.   Only then, I would say going here is worth it.

I've been here a few times, only tried the Daikokuya ramen so far, extra pork- it melts in your mouth. I ask for softer noodles since theirs is a bit firm. Really flavorful soup, so you might not like it if you can't stand eating salty food (but then you probably shouldn't be eating ramen anyway). It pretty much doesn't lack anything. Only disadvantage is waiting at least an hour, so I like to browse around the shops across the street to kill time. And I don't take off stars for that cuz it's all about the FOOD!  But, I'll never go with a group of more than 2 or 3. I love my friends, but ain't nobody making me wait even longer for my ramen! =p

I absolutely LOVE their ramen with extra pork flavoring. The broth is incredibly flavorful and rich, and their pork is tender and succulent. The egg tastes just right with a bite of chewy noodles or when you break the yolk up and mix it with the broth a little.

Good, but awesome? I beg to differ. We came here on a Wednesday night and we had to wait 45 minutes. WHAT!?!?! meh we had some time to kill so whatever. My group ordered 3 bowls of ramen and gyoza and fried rice to share. The gyoza came out first and I do not know if it was an off night, but the gyoza were most definitely not mind-blowing, they were kinda meh... The meat inside was slightly gummy, the skins weren't as crisp as I was expecting and overall they were just ok. The fried rice was pretty good especially when I mixed in the ginger to add just a little spice into the rice (hey that rhymed, but I digress...) the bits of pork add a really nice savoriness to the rice so though it looked like regular fried rice, it was definitely different thanks to the pork and a brothy undertone to the rice. The ramen is definitely solid with a creamy porky rich broth and the eggs were good that night, not completely cooked through with an orange soft yolk. The noodles were a bit overdone, slightly past cooked to partially soft, but I was hungry after the 45 minute wait so slurp away. The pork was extremely soft and perfectly done, but after all the food, I still felt like Santouka rules my heart. Sorry guys...

The last time I ate at Daikokuya it was on a warm sunny day, the outside temperature is 79 degrees. It is really too warm for ramen but the Daikoku Ramen (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) is calling my name. We arrive at Daikokuya at precisely 11:01 AM. We finally scored a booth. The restaurant opens at 11 AM and it is already a quarter full when we sat down. Five minutes later the all the booths were taken. By 11:15 there was a waiting list of six people. This place always has a line. Daikokuya only has one ramen on its menu. Oh what wonderful ramen it is. I will say that this is the best ramen that I have ever eaten. Their booth process starts the day before by "boiling pork bones and joints in a large cauldron all throughout the night". This wonderful process is what creates the perfect base for your meal. By the time we left, the people on the waiting list were overflowing out the door with 12 people waiting outside for a chance at a taste of this delicious ninja certified meal.

I love this place.  There's always a waiting list with lots of people but I think it's worth the wait (with the amount of people it seemed like they thought the same).  I usually get their specialty, their daikoku ramen, in combination with something else just to have some sort of variety for around $11. By itself the Daikoku Ramen was around $8. Today I tried it with the eel and a bit of the tuna sashimi, both were great, and the rice was perfect... Yum..

Went down to san diego then to LA for some food and fun. My friend Tiff had suggested we should try ramen in LA and Daikokuya was recommended. We got there around 7:40pm and put ourselves on the list there were six of us. There was a long wait and we didn't sit until 8:45pm, which was past their closing time (8pm). They honor anyone who listed their party before 8pm, which I think is nice of them and reasonable. It was going to be a long wait but that was fine since across the street there are a handful of small stores you can browse through to pass the time. The place actually didn't have a table that seated 6 people so four of us fit into the booth seats and they brought out two chairs for the two sitting at the edge. The service was quick (since the broth and all the ingredients are already prepared anyways - just needs to be put together.) Four of us had the extra-ordinary soup which essentially had additional pork fat/flavor added to it. My sister and I had the regular broth in the ramen ; p, which is just as delicious. I'm not a big ramen fan but this was good not great since I'm a fan of that shin-ramen spicy noodles LOL! The fresh noodle and brewed broth is probably what gets people to try ramen but when I dine out I tend to not think of ramen. The broth had a clean meaty flavor not too salty or bland. I like the green onions on top as well as the brisket/flank like meat.

Came here on a Saturday with my friend and cousin. Because there was some traffic on the way here, we ended up arriving at the restaurant at 2 PM, a time when most people should be finished with their lunch so we didn't expect a huge line. We were so wrong. We had to wait approx. 30~40 more minutes to get seated! The place is quite small and with the huge amount of business that it gets, it's understandable. All of us got the Daikoku ramen and I quite liked it. You can choose to get it in large or half size and choose the firmness of the noodles. The half size was just enough to fill me up comfortably. The broth was so good and I loved that there's so many toppings included (bamboo, egg, pork, green onion, sesame) - at other ramen places I've been to, they charged you extra if you wanted more toppings. And the egg was cooked perfectly - yolk not completely dried out - so I appreciated that. The rice was good too (my friend got it as a combo with his ramen). I would definitely come back with friends or if I'm in the area!

So severely overated. With almost 2000 reviews, I was expecting a lot. But I honestly couldn't really tell the difference between this ramen, and the ramen shop two doors away.

Ok I was brought here because of the hype and I just have to say... really? The ramen wasn't as great as everybody said and the rice wasn't either. The noodles were ok and so was the broth but it wasn't "the best ramen I ever had" as everybody says. The place was crazy overcrowded and I just didn't see what the fuss was about. I probably would have liked it more if it wasn't for the hype. It just kinda ruined it for me since I was expecting so much more. The only thing stopping me from coming back is the wait for ok ramen.

I lived on ramen during my Tokyo visit because it was so affordable and hard to replicate outside of Japan.  Needless to say, after having been utterly disappointed by the much-hyped Asahi Ramen on Sawtelle, I didn't have much hope for LA ramen.  But I had a hankering for some ramen and was in the downtown area so I decided to give Daikokuya a shot.  First, I scored free, easy parking right in front of the restaurant so I was already in a good mood.  Then, we walked in and we had JUST beat the rush (we arrived at 6).  We snagged a table and literally one minute later there was a bunch of people in the waiting area.  The ramen came out QUICK, as did the pork cutlet bowl.  I am a pork cutlet aficionado and I didn't know this one would have egg one top.  I usually like my cutlets with nothing on top so as to keep the panko crust nice and crispy.  The egg on top makes it soggy, which defeats the purpose of eating something fried.  Anyway, the ramen was delicious and the broth was yummers too.  And you know, you gotta eat ramen Japanese style - SLURP it.  It tastes better when you eat it that way.

The best Ramen...EVER! yum. A big hearty bowl of soup with the most amazing broth...EVER! The noodles are cooked perfectly and are piping hot. The soup has pork, egg, green onions and bean sprouts. On the menu is an extensive literature on the process of making the broth! They also have combination where you can pair your soup with various rice bowls. I like the shredded pork rice bowl the best. It is pork and crispy pork belly over rice and green onions. The combination also comes with a small salad. The salad is similar to a coleslaw, but 10x yummier! The dressing is amazing.  The only set-back is the wait. It is a very small place in little tokyo and the wait can get pretty long....but it is so worth it in the end! I say that Daikokuya buys out all the other ramen places on the block so that they have more room for all the peeps. This place is a must. Drop everything that your have and GO NOW! YUM

havent had ramen too much but when i do have it again, i dont think itll compare to this. we waited awhile because there was a line. we waited or about 20 minutes but it was worth it. try the gyoza, its really good and fresh and of course the ramen. the portions are huge. the food comes really quick so its makes up for the wait to get seated. there was a cute japanese cook. lol. extra .5 star i guess for eye candy! when in socal, ill definitely come back!

went there with my cosin because we heard it was popular. we waited there for about 35mins on a Sunday night. Seating was very uncomfortable, although I guess this is the "authentic ramen place style", am I right? My cousin and I had to sit at the counter. I had my coat and my purse on my lap while eating. The customer next to me keep "elbowing" me by accident (I didn't blame him, the place was just too small)... It was a cold night but it's hot and stuffy in the restaurant. I really think they need better air conditioner or better fan system. The place was packed and was noisy that my cousin and I couldn't talk much. Ramen soup taste good but very oily. Please expect to be super thirsty after your meal. I also had a small bowl of Tuna Sashimi Rice. The fish was not that fresh but the rice is good. My cousin's eel rice bowl looked delicious, I didn't try it though. Overall, I think it worth a try because of it's popularity. But, again, I really don't like having my clothes and hair smell like kitchen after eating there.

Yea im one of those guys u see outside like an idiot waiting for a bowl of ramen..ramen is spot on..no complaints there..this lunch day i ordered the ramen and also the regular size shredded pork bowl..so i was eating my ramen and the rice bowl together..and i noticed the bottom inside of my rice bowl was kinda like sweating..i thought ohh maybe cuz its hot..then i started to scoop all the water out of the shredded pork bowl..and it was oil! hundred percent lard ass oil!! I scooped 6 scoops of lard oil..mind you not this is not the normal spoon you get at Dennys..its the Japanese spoon!! so i figure not to eat this no more..take it home and put the left over in my fridge..the next morning the whole to go box was frozen lard..oh man..i microwaved it and it all turned into oil!! the rice and pork magically disappeared..poured it into my sink..the next day it was clogged!..oh well..dam and this was my favorite dish too...

love love LOVE this place!!  there is always a long wait (and for good reason) but i keep coming back again and again.  this is one of those places that truly makes you glad that you live in los angeles.  if i ever move away, i swear i'd have one of those daikokuya cravings that would make me book a redeye flight just to have a taste of that delicious ramen soup.  i love that i can make it two meals in one if i order the combination of the pork ramen with a side of fried rice.  did i tell you i LOVE this place??

What's one more five star review for this place, right? Tall Mexican and I ate here last week early in the night, so we only had to wait about 10 minutes which definitely contributed to this high of a review (I can't stand long waits for anything, good food included).  We sat down at the bar and each ordered the Daikokuya ramen, one of which was a combo with the fried rice.  The rice was good, but this place is all about the ramen! I was hesitant about coming here because I never considered myself a fan of ramen, but Daikokuya proved me wrong! The broth is a perfect combination of salt, special pork juices and crack. The noodles were the perfect texture, although I read that you can order them more al dente if you wish.  My favorite part? The egg! I'm not a huge meat fan so I traded my pork (a little chewy for my taste)  for Tall Mexican's egg.  Yummm.  The price is around $8.50 for the massive bowl of ramen, and well worth it, considering I battled to get halfway through mine before giving up.  We'll definitely be back - as long as it is before or after rush hour.

The original Daikokuya is fantastic. I'm more of a rice person myself but the noodle was great. I had it with the kotteri sauce, why not right, more fat and oil to make it taste even better. I also had a pork rice dish, not fried rice and it was delicious. The rice was soft and everything was moist. You have to eat the meal with the condiments on the table for those of you lucky to sit at a table and not at the bar. Use the red pepper, eat the red ginger, and spread the chopped garlic all over the rice dishes to take them to another level. Be prepared to wait in line but its worth it and save room for dessert. Your in Little Tokyo.

if i could give a 0.5 star, i would give this place 4.5 stars... the line starts forming early and if you are not there in time, the wait can be quite long so i would recommend getting there early.  i always get the ramen combo with the ikura bowl... so tasty.  i still have to give the edge to hakata ramen in gardena... but, if you are in the la area, this is definitely the best ramen in the area....

This is renowned as one of the top Ramen places in LA. Every time I pass by Little Tokyo for any reason, even if at odd hours, I would check whether the line is short in front of Daikokuya, so I can have a bowl of Ramen here.   Not because I liked the Ramen here so much, but because it would have made a super lucky day. The Japanese are very particular and serious about Ramen.  They even have national rankings of Ramen places.  I once had the pleasure of eating at the #4 place (I forgot whether it was #4 in Tokyo or #4 Nationally).  My friends brought me there long after lunch time, and we still had to wait for a long time for our Ramen --- then we couldn't even eat at the same table, because we had to enter separately, and eat at different single-person places.   This makes another important reason for me to eat at Daikokuya, because it reproduces the authentic Japanese Ramen experience, and brings back fond memories of my friends in Japan. Now, when it comes to the taste of Daikokuya Ramen itself, I must say I cannot appreciate it very well, although I like Ramen very much.   Perhaps the sensitivity of my palate had been destroyed completely during my growing-up days in the Communist China --- I found the entire set of Ramen at Daikokuya somewhat bland.  I had the feeling that the thickness and creaminess of the broth came mostly from egg yolks, instead of the combination of meat bone and fish which I imagine should have been the true source of thickness.  Therefore I found the taste of the broth not as profound as I had liked.  In fact, the combination of the soup with green onion gave a similar smell as egg fried rice, which smelled a somewhat wrong to me.  I liked the fact that the boiled egg was half cooked, but again, I would have preferred it they marinated it a little more.  I also would have preferred thicker and more chewy noodles.

Place from outside seems unassuming - just a lil space with banner outside.  Coworker and I went there for lunch, got there around 11:30ish  to beat the lunch crowd.  We waited for about 5 mins, not bad considering there was a sizeable crowd signing the wait list after we sat down.  It's a pretty small place with about 12 4-seat booths or so and this counter area with booths around the kitchen.  Heard place gets packed in the evenings especially on weekends.  Menu is pretty small - few appetizer plates and wet noodles or dry noodles.  EVERYONE that I walked by ordered the large sized ramen.  Coworker and I ordered the half size with gyoza.  Noodle broth was yum and very rich  in flavor.   Apparently it was lacking this fatty paste which we added later on and boy was it yummy?!  This is the first real ramen house I've been to.  I had a good experience and would recommend it.  Get the half size unless you're super duper hungry!  If anything I could have sworn I saw them taking the ramen from a bag and then dipping in hot water to cook it, does that mean it's not freshly made?

Best Ramen in LA.  I thought this place was all hype but after finally going, I fell in love with this place.  It's too bad it doesn't get cold and rainy much in LA because that would be the perfect day for some Daikokuya ramen.  You should expect a pretty decent wait (20-50 mins) but you can put your name on the clipboard and walk around Little Tokyo to kill some time.  I would recommend ordering the Ramen and fried rice combo.  Both really good.

hands down, one of the best ramen joints in LA and little tokyo.  came reviewed by my brother and it was definitely worth the one hour drive from west LA.  the soup base is wonderful and the noodles are of perfect consistency.  you can see them make your ramen in front of you and it's like dinner and a show..only the show's alright and the dinner's amazing.  the gyoza come looking kind of strange but they're marvelously yummy.  my roommate got the fried rice (you also see them cook it in front of you) and i was sold after a few bites (and i don't even like fried rice that much).  all in all, come hungry because you're definitely going to leave full and nobody likes soggy leftover ramen.  but be weary of the wait as it's a small place and there are tons of hungry diners!

Alright, here is the shibangbang... This place is located in Downtown LA in Little Japan. So right off the get go I knew parking would be a problem. Aside from getting there in LA traffic on the 110, 10 meet, the area wasn't crazy full of people - but it had a good amount of pedestrian traffic for a Thursday night. The wait was long, luckily one of my friends had reserved a name for us, so we ended up getting seated around 50 minutes after putting our name down. The place is really tiny, not much seating, so I could see why it took so long. This place is definitely not good for a group of 5 and above. But once seated, the staff/service was good. We had fried rice, ramen, and dumplings. I felt the pricing and food were good - so I could see why this place was so busy. But it feels like you can't sit and eat for that long, because so many people are waiting and there is so little table/seating space. It kinda forced us out. All in all, I like the food, but the location, parking, and wait are not worth it - unless you are a die hard ramen lover.

the broth here is PERFECT!  \(^_^)/ i just order the classic daikokuya ramen with pork slices and hard boiled egg in it.  it's the best way to go, especially if you haven't been here before.   added tip:  a great way to go is to order the ramen with a side.  the best side is the eel on rice.  YUM.  the sauce isn't too sweet (like eel sauce can tend to get) and it's a decent portion, so you can share it.   this place is consistently good- every time i've gone i've walked away satisfied.   the only downer is that it's not a big place, so it's better to go with just one other person, not a group, or else it's hard to get seated.  :(

I never considered eating ramen at a restaurant until last year.  Afterall, I could just make some instant ramen at home and it's the same thing right?  Well, a friend introduced me to Daikokuya and I was blown away.  I can't count how many times I've been here since then.  The wait is a long and can vary from 30 minutes to 2 hours.  It's best to arrive there just 5 or 10 minutes before 6pm because that's when the parking meters are free.  Parking is difficult to find and you may have to park a couple of blocks away.  I've tried several other places that claim to be better or just as good, but nothing beats Daikokuya.  Their ramen is amazing, the noodles have just the right amount of chewyness, and the pork strips melt in your mouth.  The other items on the menu are very good too.  You definitely need to try this place.

It's okay.  I guess I am not a ramen type of person.  I visited this place after I heard reviews from newspaper, Yelp, and other sources.  I guess my expectation of the food exceeded my experience.  Don't get me wrong, its not a bad tasting noodle soup.  It's just doesn't create a wow factor as I am eating it.  I don't think I will be going back soon.  It is kind of expensive ($8.50) for a bowl of noodles.

my initial search for ramen in J-Town yielded several results via the yelp app, but at the top of the list was Daiko-kuya with four stars, which i later learned was a chain with several locations in socal. after a 45 minute wait, we ordered promptly and even faster our food was there. she had the classic ramen dish that they are known for and loved it, but i ordered the eel teriyaki bowl and it was to die for. eating the leftovers i had just now prompted me to write a review right away! the eel was so tasty and tender, i just cant wait to go back! it was relatively cheap at around $10 a plate, and the service was super fast although the 45 minute wait was a bit too long at midnight on a wednesday. go and try it, its a pretty safe bet if you like "ramen and rice bowls"

god, if the lines weren't so ridiculous, i would've given this location five stars.  sometimes it can be a 2 hour wait!  i recommend going to the daikokuya in hacienda heights--it's basically the same menu but the restaurant is cleaner and less crowded.  but, if you want to feel like you're eating at a hole in the wall, stick to the little tokyo location.  anyway, aside from the wait, the ramen is ridiculously good.  unless you're a big fan of kotteri, don't try it... it's way too fatty, and it can distract from the flavor of the broth. of course you have to get the daikoku ramen.  the pork cutlets melt in your mouth...  as for the appetizers, get the fried spicy tuna!

anytime i'm downtown, i make it a point to hit up this place for ramen. these are probably one of the best ramen noodles i've had ... and i'm guessing that's the consensus of the rest of LA which is why there's sometimes more than an hr wait! they offer great combo options that allow you to order an extra dish on the side (plus a salad .. which is the reason alone that my friend chooses the combo option instead of just ramen alone) but only order if you're really hungry, because the ramen portion itself is pretty huge. i also LOVE the egg they include in your ramen ... ask for an extra one for just $1 more!

This is one of the better ramen restaurant in the area, but I had better. I think this place is over rated. Food is good, but I think when you pay 9 to 10 bucks for a bowl of ramen. They should put more chashu or things inside. The only thing they put alot of is a mountain of green onions. I would prefer the soup to be less greasier and have more vegetables inside. You can always pay to add more ingredients inside your noodles. At the end, I will always pay more than 12-14 bucks per noodles. If I share an appetizer with a friend, the bill always come out to be at least 30 something. The line there is also rediculous. Waiting time is always a hour, because the restaurant is small. They have been around for a while now and they have many restaurants in the area. How come they cannot open a bigger restaurant in the area? I walked out of the waiting line more than once already in the past, because I believe having a bowl of noodles shouldn't take this long to wait. I will give them an extra star if they can shorten the waiting time :)

i heart the egg that comes with the ramen at daikokuya. price is pretty high for ramen, sometimes i also go to mr. ramen! but you can taste the quality and effort of hardwork going into your bowl of ramen. the stock is super special, tastes like bamboo shoots among other typical ramen flavors. theres green onions, and pork. the pork is so tender it melts in your soup sometimes. the noodles are very good, got a little texture... not like orochon... those noodles are weird. the wait, as many probably have heard of is bad. but if youre a party of 2, it aint too bad. A+ for decor. i love the vintage feel of the artwork around the restaurant.

after waiting for an hour slinging down drinks next door at the cool hidden alley bar we finally got a table. when we finally got our ramen and started slurping the noodles we looked at each other and said: "really? this is what we waited an hour for?" don't get me wrong, it's pretty good. but sankoku i think is better and you don't have to wait at all... unless there's something out of this world on the menu that i didn't order...

Came here with a friend of mine. Parking is a real hassle as you must street park or pay for parking on the downtown parking slots for 6 dollars! Also, expect to wait in line for about an hour. After all the parking trouble and waiting, we finally got in and ordered our food. I got the their specialty ramen (the ramen's not the spicy type by the way) with a small fried pork cutlet rice bowl as combination. I must say it was really, really good and I was surprised. The food came out real quick and they give you a decent amount of portion. Also, the price isn't that bad either. I left with my stomach full after eating everything clean, even all the ramen broth and I felt very satisfied. If you want some tasty ramen and rice bowls, look no further and come here. The place is also very lively. I recommend this place over Orochon anyday.

SO awesome!  I love this place but the parking and the wait situation are huge deterrents for me.  There are seriously long waits-- the enormous line outside doesn't even include a lot of the people who are roaming the streets killing time while they wait, so don't get mad when people show up out of no where and get seated before you.  I always order the ramen, the gyoza, and a beer.  Beer is cheap, gyoza is perfect-- soft and crispy, and ramen is satisfying.  the broth is a tad too salty for me yet really delicious, the pork is so soft and melts in your mouth. and the egg is perfect and gooey.  You probably will think this place is just ok the first time you come here, but soon you will develop a craving!!  I've turned many friends into fans of this place.  Can get hot inside during the summer.

Daikoku Ramen Kotteri aji choudai... Kotteri is the extracted pork fat that goes into your soup and we all know that Fat turns food into gold. Well, not really but it really gives the soup a lot of flavor and a punch. But Kotteri usually gets sold out so if you get the Regular Daikoku Ramen, then it's 4/5 stars for me.

I had the exact same experience as Liz D. from her review below. There is a reason why Daikokuya has a "B" rating. It has a very funky smell. I noticed that the floor is extremely dirty leading toward the bathroom. I wouldn't be surprised to find some less-than-stringent conditions in the prep kitchen. I found the soup to be way too salty. The pork fat wasn't entirely rendered in my dish. My girlfriend and I were both sick later that night.

This place provides one of the BEST RAMEN BOWLS EVER!!!!  Each sip of the broth brings you to heaven. The cha shu is moist, tender, and rich with goodness...if i hadn't known any better I'd think I was eating butter. The bamboo and sprouts give the ramen bowl a perfect texture. The noodles also have the perfect texture. Add a little ginger and an egg and you have yourself a meal to die for.  I may be biased since RAMEN and PIZZA go hand and hand for me. You must also try the shredded pork bowl! I mean jesus can it get any better? The perfect amount of rice with a sweet glaze; small condiments as onions and ginger; and lets not forget the infamous kurbota pork. Like seriously this is food at its finest. Couple things to note that may spoil your experience. The wait is such a bitch. I waited over an hour on Sunday! No to go orders! I think that sums it up. If you have the time to wait you must try this place.

We took the Gold Line to Little Tokyo last Saturday and discovered a fantastic noodle house (Ramen) with a huge line waiting to get inside - Daikokuya.  The restaurant is tiny and decorated with vintage japanese ads and signs.  I actually did not have the famous Ramen dish but had instead California rolls and Teriyaki Chicken.  As is traditional, I first got with a very nice salad with a superb dressing and miso soup which was pretty nice - but not the best miso I have had.  The salad dressing was totally fantastic, with a nutty flavor. The Teriyaki chicken was crunchy and perfectly cooked with a thick teriyaki sauce on top.  I loved it.  The California rolls also were fantastic.  We sat at the bar so it only took 30 minutes to get a table, not so bad considering the line.  My partner had the Daikokuya Ramon and it was excellent .  Also we shared some tempura with very large shrimps and veggies.  I highly recommend this place - it is totally worth the wait and the small price.

3 stars seem like too little. 4 stars seem like too much. I guess i'll be nice and give it 4 stars. I have been to Diakokuya multiple times now and i think a little bit of it has to do with hype. The place is SO ridiculously small that there will always be a long line outside which makes it look like Diakokuya is the place to be at! Kind of like how they make you wait in line at clubs just to build hype haha.   I'm gonna admit, the ingredients are pretty fresh, esp. in their rice bowls and sometimes those noodles just hit the spot. My guy friends only order the shredded pork bowl (they say it gets a little greasy at the end).  I do wish though that we could ask for the noodles to be somewhat spicy instead of one flavor.   Don't go during peak time or during a HOT day. They have very poor ventilation. The place does have a very authentic Japanese feel to it which is nice. So to wrap it up, its a good place to visit if you've never tried.

A heart attack!  Cause that's what you will get if you have this broth.  It's super rich, fatty, full, with a tons of MSG.  Tastes amazing!  Shinsengumi has better noodles than this place, but if you really enjoy a full broth I would say to come here.  Their serving sizes are huge so be sure to share with someone.  All in all it was a great experience.  Expect to wait there at least an hour.  It's always super packed here.

My BF and I have wanted to try this place for a long time.  Whenever we came, the waiting lines were very long, so we went elsewhere.  We came back on a weekday and it was still crowded at around 1:00 pm, but there were only 5 ahead of us.   We each ordered the Daikokuya Ramen Bowl,, with a whole egg, pork belly, beansprouts and bamboo.  The broth was very good, tho tasting a bit oily at the end.  I ordered the extra rich broth, which I would recommend as it is more robust and has more flavor than the standard broth.  The noodles were cooked just right and the prk belly just melts in your mouth and full of flavor.  My BF didn't like it so much and said it wasn't worth the wait.  Also, there are no beef dishes, in case you don't want pork, chicken or seafood.  The gyoza appetizer was crispy, but only 5 small pcs and the were rolled flat, not the dumpling style and had pork and veggies...not worth it.

First time at daikokuya and the ramen was so so, but the soup base was one of the best I have had. I am from the bay area and the broth at this place was way better than the other ramen places I have had in norcal. The best part was the pork, but they only give you a few pieces making it seem exceptionally good. The wait was relatively long even at 3oclock, but overall worth the wait and not too expensive for a quality ramen.

This place has the most soul-satisfying bowl of soupy noodles outside of my grandmother's kitchen. The broth, especially with kotteri flavor, is thick and demonstrates a depth of flavor. The pork is super fatty and it's all topped with a ton of green onions and an egg. The Kirin at this place is cheap and refreshing, and despite the restaurant's insane popularity, the wait staff is always calm and polite. Four stars because the waiting situation can really get out of hand, even if you go at odd hours, and the other items on the menu are better than average, but pale in comparison to the ramen.

I've only been to Daikokuya twice and both times I had to wait a pretty long time (up to 2 hours). If you have a party bigger than 4, its pretty much going to be a while. The restaurant itself is pretty tiny, which explains the long lines, but oh boy is it worth it! Both times I've gone, I ordered the miso ramen with unagi rice combo. All I can say is DELICIOUSSSS!! Even after starving after that 2 hour wait, it was still too much food for me to finish. Portion sizes are very generous (especially if you combo it up) and I actually resorted to taking my unagi rice to go. I would totally recommend this place if you have a couple of hours to kill and you are craving a hot bowl of noodles.

Daikokuya is definitely a place with great ramen, but be warned the wait is ridiculous at times. BUT what kind of place with this great of a reputation on yelp doesn't have a ridiculous wait??? I personally really enjoyed my ramen, but the amount of hunger I had to endure to get that great tasting ramen was almost unbearable (waited from 7 to 9:30) Be sure to have something to snack on while you wait for the steamy deliciousness that Daikokuya has to offer. Also if you decide to wait, there is a plaza across the street for you to explore and kill some time at, GO THERE or the wait will only seem even more unbearably long. At the end of the day, I'd wait again for Daikokuya.

Not the best place on a hot summers day when I went but it was still good. The place is small and often crowded so it can get kind of loud at times. The ramen is more important.

Daikokuya is the benchmark for comparing all ramen places.  Even the feel of the restaurant is great.  Only bad side is the LONG wait.  If the wait wasn't that bad i'd be there more often.  Ramen comes complete w/ a whole perfectly cooked egg, cha sui, bamboo shoots, bean sprout and a crap load of green onion.  The broth is so tasty and the noodles are cooked perfectly.  They have other non ramen stuff on the menu but the only thing i would recommend is the fried rice, it's pretty greasy but tastes oh so good....

Past weekend, we went to LA for a short trip. This is one of the Ramen places that we wanted to try several times but didn't have luck until this time. The line was so long but it definitely worths the wait. We had been waiting for almost an hour for a table. The Ramen is perfectly cooked, the pork is really really tender, the soup is well balanced with the flavors. We also ordered a side dish of Gyozas which was excellent. So different from other japanese restaurants... pretty unique. But the portion of the Ramen is pretty big to me, so I suggest sharing it with someone if you can. We also ordered a Ramen Set which comes with the Pork Cutlet over Rice... it was also pretty good... We will definitely go back there next time... Remember, this place is also full of local Japanese ppl... it's definitely worth to give a try.

oh, my god. i actually made an account on this darned thing, JUST so i could comment on here! i've had real japanese ramen before, and when i came to the u.s., i thought i'd never have that same forgetfully full feeling that only real, hearty ramen can bring. i've had kouraku ramen, and it was... below decent. i'd lost faith in the ramen here until my cousin decided she was craving daiko, and proceeded to drag me there. the wait was ridiculous, though, let me tell you! it was a friday night and my god, it took us (literally) about 2 and half hours to find seats. that's my one con for that place... BUT. i glanced at the menu and snorted. they only had two kinds of ramen- the pork-based one and the other with the noodles separated from the broth! and so i ordered it, and just shrugged. i thought this place was ridiculous, overrated, and that i would definitely not come back. ...but that was all until the bowl was placed before me. oh, my god. straight up, it looked sooooo good! the broth was nice and creamy, like i knew back home. the pork was SO FREAKING delicious! there might have been an excess in green onions, but any complaint i had went right through the window. it was the best ramen i'd had, ever! so, to keep this short (ha) i recommend you go HERE ONLY. please, save yourself some time. to be honest, i could never go back to any other ramen house besides this one. true story!

BEST RAMEN EVER!  Most likely there will be a line when you go, but it is totally worth the wait.  The ramen noodles are great, but the broth is to die for.  The ramen prices are pretty decent and the portions are large.  I wish I could clone this place for the Westside.

BEST RAMEN EVER!!! this is the closest you will have to authentic Japanese ramen straight from Japan. i've been to a lot of ramen houses all over the US and in Canada and nothing compares to this. this is proven by the enormous line outside the restaurant no matter what time or day it is. try it and you wont regret it!!

not worth the wait.  The noodles are good but the soup could be a lot better.  it's not the place if you enjoy a lot of rich spices in your soup.

loved their special ramen. i'm not an expert on ramen so may not have the most discerning taste, but it was rich, full of other lovely goodness, and perhaps the perfect meal at the end of a night. the broth on top of whatever alcohol one may have in his or her system is like alchemy... a little serotonin tickle what?  i have no idea what i'm writing either.  but it was good. and it's the perfect late night snack, even more than pizza or burrito, and that's saying something!

My bf and I decided to have lunch here before catching our flight home..We are huge Ramen fans and we heard this was the best in L.A.. It was pouring and cold out and the line was out the door (good sign) we waited about 45 mins and we both order combs the ramen bowl was huge my bf and I could have shared it. The Ramen was good but I wouldnt say the best Ive ever had. All the combs looked yummy , I can see why this place is so popular..we left full and happy!

Best ramen in L.A., but still just not quite worth the ridiculous wait.  Go with friends if you really want ramen and you're willing to dedicate the night to it.  The sides you can get with the bowl are surprisingly good as well, if your stomach can take hold it all.

the best ramen ive ever had. the soup is really good, the noodles are prefectly cooked, the pork melts in your mouth, the vegetables in it give it that nice crunch ,gives it good texture. i usually get the combo with chicken teriyaki bowl . the cabbage salad is freaking good and the teriyaki chicken is really good too. they make it a little crispy. and best but not least its inexpensive. the combo with a drink is like $15 and its alot of food. ive never finished everything and i can tear it up when im eating something good. cons parking sucks its small you might get lucky and get seated with in 20min but always expect to wait an hour. its freakin hot in there

The biggest mystery to me: the wait at Daikokuya. I mean, it's good, but not "wait 2 hours" good. I only go here at like 11PM on weekdays and I still wait like 20 minutes. To be completely honest, the ramen is alright. It's nothing to kill for. Sure, it tastes great on a chilly autumn evening but it's definitely overhyped. If I were to rate this place based on just its ramen, I would give it 3 stars. However, the service is really nice here and so is the pork bowl. So I gave it 4.

Daikokuya STRIKES AGAIN! Man o man what a place. This is my favorite hole in the wall for the rest of the century! Went there for lunch yesterday and let me tell ya, it was just as good as last time.  I had the CA role, which all beit the bunny hill of sushi is still a great pleasure when done right, and they do it righ baby! Then I had the pork belly bowl. Now let me tell you something... this thing is a pork lovers dream. You have a nice bed of warm sushi rice on the bottom, then you have paper thin sliced pork belly that has been cooked up nice and crispy. THEN they finish it off with that wonderful sauce you get with your eel at your favorite sushi joint, mine being Katsu-ya. On top of that you have a nice pile of green onion to finish off the taste profile. I was sitting at the bar and when this stuff hit the counter the whole world just melted away and I was suddenly transported to a field in the middle of the Swiss Alpes and none other than Julie Andrews was spinning next to me singing her little heart out. If this place does not move you, pull out all your teeth and start eating baby food, because you don't deserve to eat real food anymore. OH, and don't get me started on the Gyoza, but that is for another time.

I've come here once every couple months for a couple years now.  The line is always super long unless you come for lunch.  The ramen itself is so so, but the BROTH is the richest in town, so people all always rank this place as the top Ramen joint in Little Tokyo.  I'm writing this review now because I just overcame the worst bout of FOOD POISONING I've ever had in my life.  I ordered the Daikoku-Ramen combo with tuna sashimi bowl.  My girlfriend got the Ramen Kotteri (extra pork fat) style.  This last time I went to Daikokuya it was the first meal I had all day, and after waiting over an hour and finally eating at 8pm last Friday I was super excited for my Ramen.  I noticed for the first time that Daikokuya had this garlic paste in little canisters set out in addition to the chilli pepper and soy sauce.  So I'm not sure whether it was the garlic that sits out or whether it was the sashimi (I don't think it was the Ramen since my girlfriend was fine), but I spent the next 48 hours dreadfully ill with a fever and "stomach issues."  I want to go back, but I just don't think it's possible.  I'm writing this review so someone at Daikokuya does the safe thing and throws away their sashimi and garlic stock before more people get sick.

Not much else needs to be said.  Nearly 3000 reviews, 4 stars.  But I have to again state that I love this ramen.  The kotteri is the best broth I've ever had, here or in Japan.  All the times I've been to Japan, all my ex fed me was katsu and ramen (leading to scurvy), so I've been all over all of the districts eating ramen.  This ramen is better than what I had in Japan.  When it gets a little chilly, ramen is the answer.  I've tried all the ones in DT, including Shinsengumi, Manten, etc., and all the ones on Sawtelle.  They are all average to gross (Sawtelle is the grossest).  This is the best.  Best full-flavored broth.  The noodles have just the right koshi and the pork falls apart!  Plus, grated garlic to make your breath extra nice.  I know, the wait sucks, but if you have no job, like the 99% who camped up the street for a couple months, you can wait it out for the best ramen in the world.

visited this place on my vacay away from norcal. we waited about 40 minutes, we wrote our name down and ran across the street to visit the sanrio store :X luckily we made it back right before they called our number. i had their famous ramen, it was good, i was actually surprised at the thickness of the broth, i've never had it that way but it was very flavorful! their fried rice had thick cut pork with buttery fat was perfect! i'll come back when i'm in town again... :] their service was great, fast and they were friendly!

Came to LA for visiting. We stayed across the street form Daikokuya at Miyako hotel.  Every day & night we look out on the street of where this ramen place was, it's always packed! People surrounding the front entrance waiting for a table.  My husband and I wanted to try this place but hate to wait for that long. One night we were walking around Little Tokyo, looking for a place to eat for dinner. We past by Daikokuya and decided to try it and see why it's sooo popular.  It was about 830pm. We write our names on the clipboard for 4 people.  We went into another sushi restaurant next door for a drink while waiting, we'd assume it would be about 45min to an hour wait. Half an hour past by, we went to check on our table, they had already called our name! So I told the waiter that the name they checked and called out was me, he was very kind and said, no problem, you'll be next.  I was surprised.  This place is actually quite small. They only had 4-5 tables that fit 4 people. The rest where small tables.  Now back to the food, they had combos, that's what I liked about this place.  A bowl of ramen with chashu plus you can choose a side of sashimi over rice, pork belly over rice, & some other stuff over rice-from $11-$14! The 4 of us ordered 2 of this combo and a place of chicken fried rice. All was delicious! Ramen noodle was perfect, not too hard and not too soft. Soup was amazing, I didn't feel thirsty afterwards. Oh, and the pork belly over rice was my favorite! The waiters were all so nice and courteous, and boy were they fast! We were in and out of there withing the hour! Love this place. The only thing is that they do not allow you to order To Go's. weird......

wish i could give this place 4.5 stars. everything about it is right. possibly one of the best ramens i've tasted outside of japan.  granted, theres only one type of ramen served here but when its that good, you know they are doing something right. i took .5 off b/c they're a little inefficient in terms of seating people. the past coupel of times i've come, they wait until 2 or 3 tables clear out to subsequently cleam them. who knows why they do it that way.

some of my guy friends took me here on my actual birthday last week. how could i pass up daikokuya? it was about 8PM and we waited maybe 30 minutes for a party of 4. we almost didnt get seated when our party was called because one person was missing, but good thing he was parking at that moment. i think a party of 4 is the most you should ever go in there with, maybe 5 but thats stretching it. there just isnt any room for more. anyway, we got one of the booths near the front. and immediately knew what we were all going to order. we got a pitcher of kirin and a bottle of nigori sake to drink. the three guys each got the daikokuya ramen, i got the 1/2 order. its not on the menu but its about $2 cheaper and perfect if you get a bunch of side orders to share. or if you feel like the regular size is way too much to waste. anyway, we got an order of gyoza, two orders of sliced pork, and fried rice. they usually get the sliced pork but this was the first time i had had it. it was like the pork they put in the ramen, but grilled with teriyaki sauce on top. i didnt really care for it though. it was really dry and tough. i guess it was better after soaking in the ramen broth. the fried rice was good. and of course the gyoza was really good. the waitress and waiters were still nice and attentive even though we were rowdy and even after the guys sang a drunk happy birthday to me with cupcakes they snuck in under their jacket! :)

I write this review with a heavy hand after eating at this establishment for over a year and waiting countless hours for a proper booth.  I found myself downtown one evening last week and got a parking spot right in front of Daikokuya.  I hadn't been in the area for a while so I decided that it must be a sign that I was due for a delicious bowl of ramen.  It was rather early (5:30pm) so getting a single seat at the counter was quite easy.  I did notice something unusual- plastered on every square inch of the walls were handwritten signs that said "cash only."  Perhaps their registers were down that evening or management has decided they don't want to deal with credit and debit cards, but I found that a bit annoying.  I ordered the usual ramen kateri style and was sorely disappointed- the broth was tasteless, the hardboiled egg was mushy and runny, there was no wild mushrooms to be found in the bowl, and the kateri meat had been brutally butchered by an unskilled chef.  I asked the waiter if the restaurant was under new management and he replied "no" in broken english.  After taking a few more bites I realized that it was totally inedible and called the waiter back over to complain which caused a stir among my fellow diners.  He offered a lame apology and left with leaving a tip.  Perhaps I had my fill of ramen and Daikokuya will remain a fond memory that no longer exists.  There is a new ramen restaurant which has opened around the corner in the strip mall with Starbucks and Yogurt Land which boasts a very clean decor, friendly service and NO LINES.  Goodbye, Daikokuya.  You had a good run but don't expect my repeat business.

very weird concept in their disassembled ramen. apparently its supposed to be eaten when its HOT so it was freaken hot on sunday night, night before the record breaking heat in LA. amazingly this place does not have AC yet there's AC vents all over the ceiling.....-_______- i guess for show. so here is the problem. this disassembled ramen would have worked out if the broth or "dipping sauce" as they called it was COLD!!!!! what was the point if haveing cold noodled and cold everything if the broth that we are supposed to dip the meat or noodles in is HOT?! might as well have gotten the hot ramen. concept fail.

we just got back from daikokuya and all i have to say is. well, i don't know yet. i grew up eating fresh ramen [ at restuaurants + at home ] and although the broth is pretty good, i don't think it's like ZOMG the-best-thing-i've-ever-eaten. we got street parking which was awesome, but if we had to pay for parking on top of waiting about 50 minutes on a tuesday night at 8:30PM, i might have been a little bummed. we split an order of gyoza [ yummy but could have been fried a little bit longer because only 2 out of the 5 were actually crispy all around ] + 2 orders of the daikokuya ramen + beer. i didn't think the noodles were all that special [ they tasted like the " fresh " ramen noodles you buy at  grocery store ] and the broth was ok on the first sip but got better once i added some garlic paste. BUT still not like i'm-gonna-shit-my-pants delicious or anything. the roundeye bf loved it though and thought it was like the best thing ever ! maybe it's because i grew up on it + ate stuff like this about 348902482903849023843 times. i don't know. anyway, it's good, food came out super quick, servers were attentive + we will come back once in a while when we have a ramen craving. cheap beer $2.50 - $3 a mug. $31 for 2 people before tip. but i can probably make this at home with homemade gyoza for way less + spend the rest on beeeeeer lol.

the only reason why i give this place a 4 star is because the wait is so long. i came on a saturday evening and the wait was over 1.5 hours. whats neat is that you can shop around local shops while youre waiting. i didnt mind the wait because the ramen is so tasty. the service is quick which is a nice plus.

SUDAMUSEHHH!!! Thats the sound of all of the Japanese attendents who greet you at the door once you enter the golden noodle palace of Ramen paradise. You notice that each and everyone has their face down in a GIANT bowl of noodle soup arranged beautifully with a wide array of tender meat, crisp green onions, suculant broth, perfectly sliced oval eggs, and freshly made noodles made from the ravishing hands of a Ramen Samurai. You wait at your table consumed by the ora of the sounds of each and every individual slurping away at their bowl of noodles. Once your entree has arrived your face falls flat into the bowl like your bobbing for apples in the wonder years of your everylasting taste bud discovery. After your final bite you can finally take your first breath as you raise your headup from the most overwhelming Ramen facial you have ever experienced in your life. You then look at your friends who sit across the table and everyone bursts out in laughter , "HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!" Why? because you all look like MOCHI faces after eating such a SPECTACULAR BOWL OF RAMEN!...and you then realize that no one has said a word from the moment that you all stepped foot into "DAIKOKUYA!"

Coming to LA for the weekend, I knew that I had to stop by and try Daikokuya after reading all of it's Yelp! reviews.  Plane landed at LAX at 10:30am  and arrived at Daikokuya around 11:45, followed by a ~45 minute wait (keep in mind this is a Wednesday lunch, so the 45 min. wait on a random Wednesday is a true testament to how popular this place is).  Upon reading Yelp! reviews, I knew this place was  famous for their Ramen but I opted to get the pork cutlet bowl (katsu-don) instead.  My cousin ordered the ramen and I got to see just how HUGE the portions were.  My katsu-don was delicious: pork breaded in panko crumbs and served with onion and egg over rice , it also came with very generous side orders of miso soup and salad.  My only complaint is that my salad had way too much dressing  in it and basically drenched the entire thing.  Other than that, I really enjoyed this place and would definitely come back!
